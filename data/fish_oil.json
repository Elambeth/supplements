      "abstract": "PURPOSE: Despite standardized surgical techniques, delayed gastric emptying (DGE) remains a major complication after Roux-en-Y reconstruction in gastric cancer patients. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of ω-3 fish oil fat emulsion in reducing DGE incidence and improving postoperative outcomes. METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, 210 patients undergoing radical gastrectomy with Roux-en-Y reconstruction (Nanjing Drum Tower Hospital, 2018-2020) were stratified into two groups: the intervention group (n=139) received parenteral nutrition (PN) with ω-3 fish oil emulsion (0.2g/kg/day), while controls (n=71) received standard PN. DGE diagnosis required persistent symptoms (>72h postoperatively) and objective evidence of impaired motility (CT contrast retention ≥50% at 4h or scintigraphic T½ >90min), excluding mechanical obstructions (luminal stenosis <8mm). RESULTS: The ω-3 group exhibited significantly lower DGE incidence (4.3% vs. 15.5%, P=0.005) and shorter median postoperative hospital stay (10 vs. 13 days, P<0.001). Multivariate analysis identified ω-3 supplementation as an independent protective factor against DGE (OR=0.32, 95% CI:0.11-0.96, P=0.042). Symptom severity (Gastroparesis Cardinal Symptom Index) showed progressive improvement in the ω-3 cohort, with significant reductions in nausea and vomiting scores by week 4 (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: Perioperative ω-3 fish oil fat emulsion supplementation reduces DGE risk by 71%, accelerates recovery, and improves surgical outcomes in gastric cancer patients undergoing Roux-en-Y reconstruction. These findings support its integration into enhanced recovery protocols, particularly in high-risk populations."

      "abstract": "It has been demonstrated that fish oil (FO), a source of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFA), offers partial protection to mice from the adverse effects of a high-fat diet (HFD) by altering the expression of genes involved in adipogenesis and adipocyte metabolism. Histone 3 lysine 27 (H3K27) modifiers, namely Ezh2, Kdm6a, Kdm6b, Crebbp and Ep300, are vital for the appropriate differentiation and metabolism of adipocytes, as they can either silence or activate transcription. The expansion of perirenal adipose tissue (AT) in obesity is associated with a number of complications, including hypertension and kidney disease. The aim of this study was to assess the expression of H3K27 modifiers and genes involved in adipogenesis and adipocyte metabolism in perirenal AT of HFD-fed and FO-treated (5DHA:1EPA) mice using real-time PCR. This study demonstrates, for the first time, that a high-fat diet (HFD) increases the expression of Kdm6b (H3K27 demethylase) in perirenal AT, and that treatment with FO can completely reverse this effect. Conversely, the expression of the Acly gene, which encodes an enzyme that provides a substrate for histone acetylases, was found to be reduced in HFD-fed mice and this was not reversed by FO treatment. Additionally, transcription factor genes, such as Tbx1, exhibited diminished expression in perirenal AT of mice fed an HFD. These observations suggest that a HFD affects the expression of chromatin modifiers, transcription factors, and metabolic genes in perirenal AT, and that FO can reverse some of these effects, offering a promising avenue for the treatment of obesity."

Methods: Searches in Medline, Embase, and Web of Science (any date to 10 October 2024) were screened, data were extracted, and the quality of the studies was assessed by two independent researchers. Meta-analyses were performed, with outcomes included in random effects models, and heterogeneity for clinical outcomes was explored via subgroup analyses and meta-regression. Pharmacoeconomic analyses used data from the current meta-analysis. Results: In this study, 29 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were included, with intervention and control groups given FO-PN and NF-PN, respectively, as part of PN covering ≥70% energy provision. Compared to NF-PN, FO-PN was associated with a 37% lower relative risk (RR) of infection (19 RCTs; RR 0.63, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.50-0.78; p < 0.0001), 2.03 days shorter length of hospital stay (18 RCTs; 95% CI 1.23-2.84; p < 0.00001), and a 51% reduction in the risk of sepsis (10 RCTs; RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.32-0.74; p = 0.0009). There was a non-significant 54% reduction in the 30-day mortality rate (11 RCTs; RR 0.46, 95% CI 0.20-1.08; p = 0.07) for FO-PN. FO-PN was associated with better clinical outcomes and financial savings (i.e., dominance) compared to NF-PN in all five countries studied. Conclusions: FO-PN is a cost-effective option compared to NF-PN for adult patients hospitalized in a general ward across a range of healthcare systems.",

METHODS: In this randomized study, 57 adults diagnosed with MDD were allocated to receive krill-oil (520 mg EPA + DHA), fish-oil (600 mg EPA + DHA), or a placebo (soybean-oil) daily for 8 weeks. Anthropometric measurements, depression anxiety stress-21 (DASS-21) scale, and Hamilton depression rating scale (HDRS) were performed at baseline and 4 and 8 weeks. In addition, venous blood samples were collected at baseline and post-intervention to evaluate lipid and glycemic profiles, including fasting glucose, HbA1c, cholesterol, triglycerides, LDL-c, and HDL-c levels.SPSS and R Studio software programs were used for statistical analysis. RESULTS: A total of 50 participants completed the study, with 17 in each intervention group and 16 in the placebo. The mean HDRS scores decreased significantly in both the krill-oil (8.5 ± 1.2) and fish-oil groups (10.0 ± 1.2) compared to the placebo (p < 0.001), indicating clinical symptom improvement. Furthermore, the interaction effect of group-by-time was found to be statistically significant (η2p = 0.273;ptime×group < 0.001). Anxiety and distress scores decreased to similar levels after the post-intervention compared to baseline in krill- and fish-oil groups. Krill- and fish-oil supplementation increased plasma HDL-c and uric acid levels, but the group-by-time interaction effect was only observed at the HDL-c level (η2p = 0.238;ptime×group = 0.002). The mean HbA1c rates and plasma triglyceride levels of krill-oil recipients were lower after the post-intervention. CONCLUSION: Krill- and fish-oil could be considered as a safe and effective adjuvant treatments for depression. However, there was no evidence of apparent superiority over each other.",

In order to assess the effects of fish oil supplements and oily fish, at a level achievable in the diet, on EV numbers, composition and procoagulant activity in healthy human volunteers, forty-two healthy subjects were assigned to one of three treatment groups: (i) fish oil supplements plus white fish meals, (ii) control supplements plus oily fish meals or (iii) control supplements plus white fish meals for 12 weeks in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel trial; circulating EV were enumerated and their procoagulant activity assessed using thrombin generation and fibrinolysis assays. Our results showed that fish oil supplements decreased circulating EV numbers and reduced EV-stimulated thrombin generation, but the consumption of oily fish at half the dose of EPA had no effect on either EV number or thrombogenic capacity. Consumption of both oily fish and fish oil supplements increased the EPA and DHA contents of EV, and the proportion of EPA in circulating EV was strongly associated with EV-stimulated thrombin generation. This study revealed that the additional 1 g/d EPA delivered in the fish oil supplements is required to decrease the numbers and thrombogenic capacity of EV, since oily fish at a level achievable in the diet had no effect. Increasing EPA intake beyond current guidelines for oily fish consumption may therefore be required for cardiovascular benefits relating to EV."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Unhealthy dietary habits have been recognized as key contributors to the increasing incidence of non-communicable diseases. Among the healthy nutrients studied, omega-3 fatty acids, especially eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), have received considerable attention for their benefits in cardiovascular health and inflammation management. Their synthesis is regulated by enzymes encoded by FADS1 and ELOVL2 genes. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within these genes can modify the efficiency of fatty acid conversion, thereby influencing the Omega-3 Index, which reflects omega-3 status, particularly EPA and DHA. This study aimed to assess the impact of FADS1 (rs174537) and ELOVL2 (rs953413) polymorphisms on the effects on fatty acids profiles of fish oil supplementation in healthy individuals. METHODS: Eighty-six healthy adults aged 20-70 participated in a quasi-experimental intervention involving a 4-week fish oil supplementation rich in EPA and DHA. Dried-blood spots (DBS) were collected before and after the intervention to evaluate lipid profiles. Genotyping for FADS1 and ELOVL2 SNPs was performed using high-resolution melting analysis. RESULTS: Post-supplementation, the percentage of EPA and DHA increased significantly (p < 0.001), leading to an improved Omega-3 Index. Baseline omega-3 percentages did not differ significantly between FADS1 and ELOVL2 genotypes. However, individuals with the ELOVL2 minor allele (GA + AA) genotype benefited more from the fish oil supplementation with increased EPA and DBS Omega-3 Index, indicating a more favorable metabolic response. CONCLUSIONS: Genetic variability may influence the metabolic response to fish oil supplementation. These findings underscore the importance of personalized nutrition strategies to optimize health outcomes and prevent non-communicable diseases.",

      "abstract": "An 8-week feeding trial was conducted to investigate the effects of replacing dietary fish oil (FO) with black soldier fly larval oil (BSFO) on growth performance, antioxidant and immune response, lipid metabolism and mitochondrial function of the juvenile mud crab. A total of 160 mud crabs (18.58 ± 0.02 g) were randomly distributed into five treatments spread across 160 aquaria. There were 4 replicates per treatment and 8 crabs per replicate. The basal diet (Control) contained 3% fish oil and fish oil was replaced with BSFO at 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100% in the remaining four treatments. The results showed that when the proportion of BSFO replacing FO was less than 50%, there were no significant differences in percent weight gain (PWG), specific growth rate (SGR) and feed efficiency (FE) between the experimental and the control groups (P > 0.05); however, PWG and SGR decreased as the percentage of substitution increased from 50% to 100% (P < 0.01). When the percentage of substitution was less than 50%, the expression levels of genes related to lipid synthesis and catabolism were significantly up-regulated and down-regulated, respectively (P < 0.05). When 25% and 50% FO were replaced with BSFO, the antioxidant and immune responses enhanced (P < 0.05), and antioxidant and immune-related enzyme activities and metabolite concentrations in the hemolymph and hepatopancreas significantly increased (P < 0.05), and the concentrations of malondialdehyde (MDA) and protein carbonyl (PC), and the apoptosis index in the hepatopancreas significantly decreased (P < 0.05). Moreover, mitochondrial function indexes in the hepatopancreas, such as mitochondrial DNA copy number and expression levels of energy metabolism-related genes were significantly up-regulated (P < 0.05). Hepatopancreas mitochondria were more abundant in crabs fed diets with 25% and 50% replacement of FO with BSFO, while adenosine triphosphate content was the highest in 25% FO replacement group (P = 0.003). In summary, the results of the present study demonstrated that the replacement of FO with BSFO at less than 50% (i.e. in-feed BSFO level of 1.5%) did not negatively affect the growth performance of mud crabs, and could improve the antioxidant capacity, immune response, and enhance mitochondrial function."

      "abstract": "Cancer is a leading cause of mortality and morbidity worldwide and conventional chemotherapy frequently induce irreversible adverse effects in patients. Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is a common adverse effect of both paclitaxel (PTX) and oxaliplatin (OXA) chemotherapies, affecting approximately 30-50% of patients. As cancer survival rates have improved, the efforts of scientific community to develop new strategies for preventing CIPN are also growing. This study presents the effects of omega-3 (ω-3)-enriched fish oil supplementation on the hypersensitivity induced by PTX or OXA in mice. GC-MS analysis of the fish oil revealed an amount of EPA and DHA corresponding to 55.2% and 37.4% of total oil composition, respectively. The thirty-day supplementation with the fish oil prevented the cold hypersensitivity induced by the acute OXA injection protocol, with reduction of spinal cord microglia activation, as well as decreased levels of cytokines and BDNF in the spinal cord and brain. A similar effect was observed with the chronic OXA administration, reducing both mechanical and thermal hypersensitivity. The fish oil also prevented PTX-induced neuropathy, accompanied by a reduction in cytokine levels. It is important to mention that biochemical parameters such as total cholesterol, triglycerides and glucose were also normalised. The fish oil supplementation prevented the development of hypersensitivity in both OXA and PTX models, with reduced neuroinflammation likely being the main mechanism behind this effect. The fish oil supplementation, either before or during chemotherapy, could be an important ally to prevent and treat CIPN, improving the patients' quality of life post-cancer treatment.",

The effects of the pretreatment on enzymatic hydrolysis were assessed by measuring the degree of hydrolysis (DH), protein yield, and molecular weight distribution.

Emulsions stabilized with US-pretreated Trypsin hydrolysates presented the smallest droplet sizes (0.626 μm). Primary and volatile secondary oxidation products were measured during storage. However, none of the hydrolysate-stabilized emulsions exhibited greater oxidative stability than sodium caseinate, the reference protein.

      "abstract": "Background/Objectives: Menopause induces substantial metabolic changes, including a reduction in metabolic rate and an elevated risk of developing metabolic diseases. Fish oil (FO) supplementation has been shown to ameliorate menopause-associated metabolic risks. Hyperthermia treatment (HT) has recently gained attention for its potential to improve metabolic and immune health. However, it remains to be determined whether HT can confer metabolic benefits comparable to those of FO supplementation or enhance the metabolic benefits of FO supplementation. This study aims to delineate the distinctive and collaborative effects of HT and FO supplementation in mitigating menopause-associated metabolic dysfunction. Methods: Female C57BL/6 ovariectomized (OVX) mice were randomly assigned to four groups (n = 12/group) to evaluate the individual and combined effects of FO supplementation (5% w/w) and HT treatment. For HT, whole-body heat exposure was conducted at 40-41 °C for 30 min, 5 days per week. After 12 weeks, animals were used to evaluate the changes in glucose and lipid metabolism, obesity outcome, and inflammatory markers. The gut microbiome analysis was conducted from cecal content by 16S rRNA sequencing. Acute inflammation was induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) injection to evaluate inflammatory responses. Results: HT alone distinctively reduced weight gain, lowered core body temperature, and attenuated insulin resistance comparable to FO supplement in OVX mice. The collaborative effect of FO and HT was not evident in metabolic parameters but more prominent in attenuating proinflammatory responses and microbiota modulation. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that the combined treatment of FO supplementation and HT may serve as an effective strategy to mitigate menopause-associated immune susceptibility and metabolic dysfunction. These benefits are likely mediated, at least in part, through the reduction in inflammation and modulation of the gut microbiota.",

      "abstract": "Metabolic dysfunction associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) is a chronic condition with hepatic fat accumulation. The intergenerational effect of obesity has predominantly focused on mothers, with limited studies on paternal obesity. Nutritional intervention with fish oil (FO) has beneficial effects in reducing markers of obesity. We hypothesized that supplementing obese fathers with FO before conception could enhance the metabolic health of their offspring liver. Male mice were assigned to low-fat (LF), high fat (HF), or HF supplemented with FO for 10 weeks. Subsequently, these males were mated with females on a chow diet. Offspring were sacrificed at 8 weeks, and liver tissues were analyzed for gene expression and histology. Offspring body weight was not significantly impacted by paternal diet. However, male offspring of HF fathers had higher levels of markers of inflammation and fatty acid synthesis compared to offspring of LF fed fathers. Paternal FO supplementation significantly reduced fatty acid synthesis and glucose metabolism, while increasing fatty acid oxidation in male offspring, with a less pronounced effect in female offspring. These findings suggest that FO supplementation in obese fathers prior to conception attenuates the development of MAFLD in male offspring. This data underscores the significance of paternal nutritional intervention in promoting offspring health.",

Rumen-protected technologies aim to prevent the ruminal biohydrogenation of VLC n-3 FA. To test the effects of these technologies on circulating FA and phospholipid concentrations, and milk FA concentrations, six mid-lactation, multiparous, pregnant Holstein dairy cows (mean ± SD: 155 ± 19 days in milk; 3.0 ± 0.5 body condition score; 3.2 ± 1.1 lactations; 644 ± 23 kg BW) were randomly assigned to treatments in a study with a replicated 3 × 3 Latin Square design. Cows were unsupplemented (control) or supplemented with a single esophageal bolus of a gelatin capsule containing a fish oil product coated in palm oil triglycerides or modified starch (TAG and STR, respectively). The provision of either fish oil product provided 10 g equivalent of VLC n-3 FA including 20:5 n-3 and 22:6 n-3. Cows were fed a total mixed ration to meet or exceed nutrient requirements and were milked thrice daily. Blood was sampled at 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 16, 18, 20, 24, and 36 h, relative to bolus administration. A 7-d washout period was utilized between each bolus delivery. Extracted plasma was analyzed for individual FA and phospholipid concentrations using gas chromatography and mass spectrometry. Separated milk fat was analyzed for individual milk FA using gas-liquid chromatography and a flame-ionization detector. Data were analyzed under a mixed model with the random effect of cow, and the fixed effects of treatment, hour, and period. Plasma concentrations of 20:5 n-3 and 22:6 n-3 increased over time by TAG and STR, relative to control. Plasma concentrations of lysophophatidylcholine-20:5, -22:5 and -22:6, and phosphatidylcholine (PC)-38:5 and -38:6 were higher in TAG and STR by h 10, relative to control. Plasma PC-40:5 and -40:6 concentrations were greater in cows administered STR by h 10, relative to TAG. Total milk n-3 increased over time in treated cows compared to control. We conclude that triglyceride- or starch-encapsulated fish oil increases the plasma and milk concentrations of VLC n-3 FA and phospholipids containing these acyl chains in lactating cows.",

Fish oil, for the first time, was considered as a nutritional agent for the mitigation of acrylamide (AA) and Nε-(carboxymethyl)lysine (CML). The addition of fish oil at 30 μL/g significantly reduces the formation of AA, free CML, and bound CML by 39.2 %, 27.3 %, and 14.9 %, respectively, during thermal processing at 160 °C for 20-30 min in air-based thermal processed potato chips.

Seventy mice were divided into 10 groups, including controls and those receiving FO either orally or topically, with or without the carcinogenesis protocol. Warts were morphologically analyzed. Anatomopathological analysis, qRT-PCR of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-қB) subunits' gene expression, and evaluation of oxidative parameters were conducted. Anatomopathological analysis revealed a presence of invasive squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) in DMBA group. Both oral (500 mg/kg/day) and topical FO treatment showed no signs of cancer, while oral administration at 50 mg/kg/day had no therapeutic effect, and 250 mg/kg/day resulted in low-grade malignancy. Both oral (250 and 500 mg/kg/day) and topical FO significantly reduced NF-кB1 gene expression, alleviated oxidative stress markers, and restored antioxidant enzyme activities compared to the DMBA group. FO shows dose-dependent chemopreventive effects, with oral administration potentially as effective as topical application when using an appropriate dosage. The development of SCC is linked to the stress status and the upregulation of the canonical NF-κB pathway, while FO's chemoprotective effects likely result from its downregulation.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: There is a close correlation between bone loss, depression, and antidepressants. N-3 PUFA supplementation has been considered an effective add-on therapeutic approach in ameliorating bone loss and relieving depression. However, the adjunctive effect of n-3 PUFA on bone metabolism in participants with depression is still unknown. This is a pilot study to investigate the dynamics of bone metabolism in depression and evaluate the efficacy of fish oil on bone loss in depression. METHODS: In this study, we focused on the change of bone turnover markers in depression, the effect of n-3 PUFA supplementation on bone turnover markers, and its association with clinical characteristics. A case-control study and a secondary analysis of a previously published randomized clinical trial (NCT03295708) that evaluates the efficacy of n-3 PUFA supplementation in venlafaxine-treated depressed participants have been included. RESULTS: The levels of PINP (z = -2.233, p = 0.026) in depressed participants were significantly increased compared with healthy controls at baseline. The secondary analysis has shown significant differences exited on CTX (χ 2 = 4.848, p = 0.028) and OSTEOC (χ 2 = 6.178, p = 0.013) between n-3 PUFA and placebo group. The levels of CTX and OSTEOC (p < 0.05) significantly decreased in the placebo group, which indicates that venlafaxine treatment reduces both bone formation and resorption markers. While the levels of OSTEOC and PINP were increased in the n-3 PUFA group (p < 0.05). Moreover, the change in bone turnover markers showed consistency with clinical symptomatic outcomes. CONCLUSION: Participants with first-diagnosed, drug-naïve depression show active bone formation. Venlafaxine decreases bone remodeling, while n-3 PUFA increases bone formation, bringing light to preventing and treating bone loss in depression.

      "abstract": "In obesity, C-C chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2) plays a critical role in recruiting macrophages to white adipose tissue (WAT), contributing to chronic inflammation. In this study, we sought to explore the effects of fish oil (FO) on CCL2 expression and histone (H3K27)-modifying enzymes in both human model of preadipocytes and primary adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs). Present findings in preadipocytes lineage evidenced that lipopolysaccharide (LPS) increased TNF-alpha (∼5.8-fold) and CCL2 (∼3.8-fold) expression, modulating H3K27 modifying enzymes expression, including KDM6B and EP300. FO, in turn, significantly attenuated LPS-induced CCL2 expression and secretion and downregulated KDM6B and EP300, elucidating an important mechanism of action involved in the anti-inflammatory role of FO. We next isolated mature hypertrophied adipocytes from patient with overweight and exposed to LPS, resulting in increased CCL2/MCP-1 (∼3.8-fold) and TNF-alpha (∼4.5-fold) expression, effects significantly attenuated by FO. We also generated adipocyte-conditioned medium (ACM) and exposed ASCs to LPS or ACM for up to 72 h to assess CCL2/MCP-1 secretion. ACM from hypertrophied adipocytes stimulated increased CCL2/MCP-1 expression, which was partially reduced by FO. LPS treatment of primary ASCs led to a marked increase in CCL2 secretion, which was completely abolished by FO after 6 h, highlighting its potent anti-inflammatory effect. After 72 h, FO consistently maintained lower levels of CCL2, even during sustained inflammatory stimulation, underscoring its ability to modulate chronic inflammation. Additionally, the inhibition of NF-κB with JSH-23 mimicked the effects of FO on CCL2 expression, further suggesting that the anti-inflammatory actions of FO may involve NF-κB signaling. In conclusion, FO attenuates CCL2 expression and secretion in both preadipocytes and ASCs, providing evidence of its potential in modulating inflammation in WAT progenitor cells by modulating histone-modifying enzymes and inflammatory pathways."

Ninety healthy swimming crabs (initial body weight 34.28 ± 0.59 g) were randomly assigned to 90 plastic baskets. Three isonitrogenous and isolipidic diets (450 g/kg protein and 120 g/kg lipid) were formulated replacing FO with CSO at 0%, 50% and 100% (CSO-0, CSO-50, and CSO-100), respectively. Each diet was randomly allocated to three replicates, each consisting of 10 crabs. Results indicated that crabs fed with CSO-100 diet had the lowest the percent weight gain (PWG), specific growth rate (SGR) and survival among all treatments (P < 0.05). Albumin (ALB), glucose (GLU), triglyceride (TAG), total cholesterol (T-CHO), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), non-esterified fatty acid (NEFA) contents and alkaline phosphatase (ALP), alanine amino transferase (ALT) activity in hemolymph were significantly affected by dietary substitution of FO with CSO (P < 0.05). The contents of total saturated fatty acids (SFA), total mono-unsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) and total long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFA) in the hepatopancreas and muscle were negatively correlated with the substitution level, whereas total n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-6 PUFA) and linoleic acid (18:2n-6) contents increased significantly with increasing levels of dietary substitution of FO with CSO (P < 0.05). Dietary substitution of FO with CSO resulted in changes in the composition of volatile substances in muscle, with 16 volatile substances in muscle significantly affected (P < 0.05). The relative expression of genes related to lipid synthesis such as fatty acid synthase (fas), acetyl-CoA carboxylase (acc) and glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase 1 (gpat1) in the hepatopancreas were significantly up-regulated in the CSO-50 group compared to other treatment groups (P < 0.05). The relative expression of fatty acid anabolism-related genes fatty acyl desaturase 2 (fads2) and elongase 4 (elovl4) were significantly down-regulated with the increase of dietary substitution of FO with CSO (P < 0.05). In conclusion, 50% substitution with CSO had no negative effects on growth performance, promoted lipid synthesis and metabolism, facilitated lipid accumulation. However, complete substitution of FO with CSO inhibited fatty acid synthesis and metabolism, resulting in a lower tissue LC-PUFA content and an altered composition of muscle volatiles."

We sought to determine whether a high omega-3, low omega-6 fatty acid diet with fish oil capsules (D + FO) decreases proliferation (Ki-67) in prostate biopsies in men with prostate cancer on AS over a 1-year time period. METHODS: In this phase II, prospective randomized trial, men (N = 100) with grade group 1 or 2 prostate cancer who elected AS were randomly assigned to the D + FO or a control group. Same-site prostate biopsies were obtained at baseline and 1 year. The primary end point was the change in Ki-67 index from baseline to 1 year from same-site biopsies compared between the groups. RESULTS: The Ki-67 index decreased in the D + FO group by approximately 15% from baseline to 1 year (1.34% at baseline, 1.14% at 1 year) and increased in the control group by approximately 24% from baseline to 1 year (1.23% at baseline, 1.52% at 1 year), resulting in a statistically significant difference in the change of Ki-67 index between the groups (95% CI, 2% to 52%, P = .043). There was no significant difference in the secondary outcomes grade group, tumor length, Decipher genomic score, or prostate-specific antigen between the two groups. Four patients in the D + FO group were withdrawn from the trial because of adverse events related to the FO. CONCLUSION: A high omega-3, low omega-6 diet with FO for 1 year resulted in a significant reduction in Ki-67 index, a biomarker for prostate cancer progression, metastasis, and death. These findings support future phase III trials incorporating this intervention in men on AS.",

Current surgical and non-surgical treatment options are invasive, expensive, and typically administered for prolonged periods, potentially leading to side effects. To address these challenges, we developed a novel fish oil-encapsulated, poloxamer-based nanoemulsion gel with omega-3 (ω3) as the primary active component (NE-ω3 gel; N3G). This formulation can be injected during surgery, reducing the need for prolonged administration of medications and minimizing associated side effects. N3G was prepared through a two-step process involving the emulsification of fish oil followed by gelation with poloxamer to create a thermoreversible gel. Dynamic light-scattering analysis confirmed a uniform distribution of nanoemulsion particles, which had a mean diameter of 287 ± 8.599 nm and a PDI of 0.29 ± 0.047. FTIR and DSC analyses validated the encapsulation of fish oil within poloxamer micelles. Drug-release analysis demonstrated that more than 96% of fish oil was released within 10 h. In in vivo experiments, rats (n = 30) were divided into three groups: a negative control group (G1), a positive control group receiving fish oil (G2), and an experimental group with implants coated with N3G (G3). G3 exhibited a 21.2% reduction in capsular thickness compared to G1 and a 5.6% reduction compared to G2. In addition, significant decreases in fibrosis and myofibroblast counts were observed in G3. These results, supported by histological and gene expression analyses, highlight the effectiveness of N3G in reducing inflammation and fibrosis. This study underscores the therapeutic potential of N3G for capsular contracture, based on its persistence, thermoreversibility, and improved dosing and storage characteristics.",

The relationship between stabilization mechanism and lipid digestion was revealed, considering the protein conformation and interfacial characteristics. The results showed that pH-ultrasonic-induced myofibrillar proteins (MPs) at pH 7.0 had higher interfacial adsorption capacity and surface hydrophobicity as well as more stable secondary structures, which lowered the particle size and enhanced the interfacial stability. In the stomach, the particle size increased along with the decrease in electrostatic repulsion, and β-sheets significantly increased, which promoted aggregation and flocculation. In the small intestine, the reduction of β-sheets favored the interfacial replacement and facilitated the lipid digestion. Therefore, pH-ultrasonic-modified method improved the structure and function of MPs, facilitated the interfacial stability and intestinal digestion.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to investigate the effects of fish oil-derived omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (omega-3 PUFAs) on gut microbiota and serum lipid metabolites in T2DM. METHODS: In a three-month, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 110 T2DM patients received either fish oil (n = 55) or corn oil (n = 55) capsules daily. Serum lipids, glycemic parameters, gut microbiota diversity, and lipidomics were assessed. RESULTS: This study found that fish oil-derived omega-3 PUFAs intervention did not significantly lower the fasting plasma glucose levels when compared with the baseline level (p > 0.05). However, serum fasting blood glucose (p = 0.039), glycosylated hemoglobin levels (p = 0.048), HOMA-IR (p = 0.022), total cholesterol (p < 0.001), triglyceride (p = 0.034), LDL cholesterol (p = 0.048), and non-HDL levels (p = 0.046) were significantly lower in the fish oil group compared with the corn oil group after three months of intervention. Also, it altered glycerophospholipid metabolism and gut microbiota. After three months, the fish oil group showed a significantly lower abundance of Desulfobacterota compared with the corn oil control group (p = 0.003), with reduced levels of Colidextribacter (p = 0.002), Ralstonia (p = 0.021), and Klebsiella (p = 0.013). Conversely, the abundance of Limosilactobacillus (p = 0.017), Lactobacillus (p = 0.011), and Haemophilus (p = 0.018) increased significantly. In addition, relevant glycolipid metabolism indicators showed significant correlations with the altered profiles of serum lipid metabolites, intestinal bacteria, and fungi. CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the impact of fish oil-derived omega-3 PUFAs on intestinal microbiota structure and function in patients with type 2 diabetes. The observed decrease in pathogenic bacterial species and the enhancement of beneficial species may have significant implications for gut health and systemic inflammation, both of which are pivotal in managing diabetes. Further research is warranted to comprehensively elucidate the long-term benefits and underlying mechanisms of these microbiota alterations.",

      "abstract": "Brain injury is one of the most important causes of infant mortality and chronic neurological disabilities. Hypoxia is an acute brain injury which led to various cognitive, behavioral, and memory disorders throughout life. Previous studies reported neuroprotective possibilities for fish oil (FO) in brain-injured situations. In this study, we evaluated the effect of the FO diet during the lactation period on seizure activity, behavioral performance, histomorphometry, and inflammatory changes in the brains of hypoxia rats. Male Wistar rats were randomly divided in to 4 groups: Sham (intact rats), hypoxia, FO and FO+hypoxia groups. Hypoxia was induced by keeping neonate rats at PND12 in a hypoxic chamber (7 % oxygen and 93 % nitrogen intensity) for 15 minutes. In the FO groups, rats received oral FO (1 ml/day) for 12 days during the lactation period. Seizure activity was assessed by measuring the number of tonic-clonic seizures and seizure thresholds. Novel object recognition tests (NORT), rotarod, and open field tests were used to measure behavioral performances. A Histological study was performed to evaluate histomorphometric changes in the hippocampus and cerebellum. The gene expression of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-1β (IL-1β) was measured using RT-PCR. Findings showed that the number of tonic-clonic seizures, atrophy, and cell death in the hippocampus and cerebellum, the gene expression of TNF-α and IL-1β in the hippocampus, and behavioral disorders were significantly increased in the hypoxia rats compared to the sham group. Administration of FO in the hypoxia groups significantly decreased the gene expression of TNF-α and IL-1β, the number of tonic-clonic seizures, and neuronal cell death in the hippocampus and cerebellum compared to the hypoxia groups. Furthermore, it can improve behavioral tasks and cognitions."

      "abstract": "Background: Following injury, older adults exhibit slow recovery of muscle function. Age-related impairment of sarcolemmal membrane repair may contribute to myocyte death, increasing the need for myogenesis and prolonging recovery. Dietary fish oil (FO) is a common nutritional supplement that may alter plasma membrane composition to enhance the response to membrane injury. Methods: We assessed effects of an 8-week dietary intervention on muscle contractile recovery in aged (22 mo.) rats on control (n = 5) or FO (control + 33 g/kg FO (45% eicosapentaenoic acid; 10% docosahexaenoic acid); n = 5) diets 1-week after contusion injury, as well as adult (8 mo., n = 8) rats on the control diet. Results: Recovery was reduced in aged rats on the control diet vs. adults (63 vs. 80%; p = 0.042), while those on the FO diet recovered similarly to (78%) adults. To directly assess sarcolemma injury, C2C12 cells were cultured in media with and without FO (1, 10, and 100 μg/mL; 24 or 48 h) and injured with an infrared laser in medium containing FM4-64 dye as a marker of sarcolemmal injury. FO reduced the area under the FM4-64 fluorescence-time curve at all concentrations after both 24 and 48 h supplementation. Conclusions: These preliminary data suggest FO might aid recovery of muscle function following injury in older adults by enhancing membrane resealing and repair.",

METHODS: In this study, the protective effects of dietary supplementation with krill oil (KO), fish oil (FO), and astaxanthin (ASX) on an ethanol-induced gastric ulcer model were compared during biochemical and histological observations. Sprague-Dawley (n = 64) rats randomly divided into four groups-normal control (vehicle), KO, FO, and ASX groups-received the supplements via the orogastric route at a rate of 2.5% (v/w) of their daily feed consumption for 4 weeks. Then, ulcer induction was performed with ethanol. RESULTS: The ulcer group showed increased levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), chemiluminescence (CL), and myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity and decreased levels of glutathione in the gastric tissues. While KO, FO, and ASX supplementation decreased chemiluminescence levels in the ulcer group, only ASX supplementation decreased MDA levels and MPO activity. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, supplementation with KO or FO has a similar protective effect against ethanol-induced ulcer damage, as it inhibits ROS formation and reduces lipid peroxidation. However, ASX supplementation has a higher protective effect than KO or FO supplementations against experimental ethanol-induced gastric lesions in rats, as it inhibits ROS formation and reduces neutrophil infiltration and lipid peroxidation.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Preeclampsia is a type of hypertension disorder characterized by symptoms of damage to other organs. The effect of omega-3 supplementation and fish oil on preeclampsia has been studied several times over the years. Therefore, due to the importance of the subject and the inconsistency of the results of the studies, the present research aimed to estimate the effect of omega-3 supplementation and fish oil on preeclampsia by systematic review and meta-analysis. METHODS: The present systematic review and meta-analysis was performed according to PRISMA guidelines from 1990 to February 2022. A systematic literature review was conducted in MagIran, SID, PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science (WoS) databases and Google Scholar motor engine using related MeSH/Emtree terms, which were combined with free text word. The heterogeneity of the studies was addressed using I2 index and publication bias was assessed using Egger's regression intercept. RESULTS: The initial systematic literature search retrieved 12095 studies, of which 16 articles with a sample size of 8004 subjects in the intervention group and 8233 in the control group were finally included in the meta-analysis after excluding irrelevant studies. As a result of combining primary studies, the risk ratio of the frequency of total preeclampsia (mild and severe) was obtained (RR: 0.63; 95 % CI, 0.41-0.95, P = 0.027) in the intervention group compared to the control group and risk ratio of the frequency of severe preeclampsia was calculated (RR: 0.45; 95 % CI, 0.24-0.83, P = 0.011) in the intervention group compared to the control group. CONCLUSION: Based on the results of the present study, the consumption of omega-3 supplementation and fish oil significantly reduces the risk of developing preeclampsia. Therefore, it seems that omega-3 supplementation and fish oil can be considered in preventing preeclampsia.",

Results showed that LF-EGCG had stronger antioxidant activity, higher thermal stability, and better surface wettability than LF + EGCG. Meanwhile, the complexes showed no cytotoxicity within the tested concentration range (12.5-200 μg/mL). The HIPPEs stabilized with LF-EGCG possessed smaller droplet size, higher ζ-potential, and more uniform oil/water proton distribution. Covalent treatment also enhanced the storage, thermal, freeze-thaw and physical stability of LF HIPPEs. Furthermore, due to the higher antioxidant activity and denser microstructure, LF-EGCG HIPPE can more effectively inhibit the oxidation of fish oil."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Intravenous lipids are critical to the care of extremely premature and other high-risk infants. OBJECTIVES: This study evaluated safety and efficacy of parenteral nutrition (PN) with composite intravenous lipid emulsion (CO-ILE) with fish oil compared with pure soybean oil lipid emulsion (SOLE). METHODS: Randomized, controlled, double-blind, multicenter study (NCT02579265) in neonates/infants anticipated to require ≥28 d of PN due to gastrointestinal malformations or injury. Duration of the initial and extended treatment phase was 28 d and 84 d, respectively (for patients with PN indication after day 28). RESULTS: Eighty-three patients (mean postnatal age 11.4 d, 54 preterm) received CO-ILE and 78 patients received SOLE (mean postnatal age 8.3 d, 59 preterm). Thirty-three patients per group completed 28 d of treatment. Risk of having conjugated bilirubin values >2 mg/dL confirmed by a second sample 7 d after the first during the initial treatment phase (primary outcome) was 2.4% (2 of 83) with CO-ILE and 3.8% (3 of 78) with SOLE (risk ratio: 0.59; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.09, 3.76). Between days 29 and 84, the number of patients with confirmed conjugated bilirubin values >2 mg/dL did not increase in the CO-ILE group (n = 2) and increased in the SOLE group (n = 9). At the end of the initial treatment phase, conjugated bilirubin concentrations were 45.6% lower under CO-ILE than under SOLE (P = 0.006). There was no clinical or laboratory evidence of essential fatty acid deficiency in patients in the CO-ILE group. Median time to discharge alive was 56.7 d and 66.4 d with CO-ILE and SOLE, respectively (hazard ratio: 1.16; 95% CI: 0.81, 1.68). CONCLUSIONS: CO-ILE was associated with a possible lower risk of cholestasis and significantly lower conjugated bilirubin concentration at the end of the initial treatment phase in high-risk neonates and infants as compared with patients treated with SOLE. In summary, these data indicate that CO-ILE can be considered safe and may be preferable over SOLE in high-risk neonates. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT02579265.",

Limited nutritional supplements are conducive to lung cancer patients, whereas the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. In this study, we used a murine cancer cachexia model to investigate the effects of a nutritional formula (NuF) rich in fish oil and selenium yeast as an adjuvant to enhance the drug efficacy of an EGFR inhibitor (Tarceva). In contrast to the healthy control, tumor-bearing mice exhibited severe cachexia symptoms, including tissue wasting, hypoalbuminemia, and a lower food efficiency ratio. Experimentally, Tarceva reduced pEGFR and HIF-1α expression. NuF decreased the expression of pEGFR and HIF-2α, suggesting that Tarceva and NuF act differently in prohibiting tumor growth and subsequent metastasis. NuF blocked LLC tumor-induced PTHrP and expression of thermogenic factor UCP1 and lipolytic enzymes (ATGL and HSL) in WAT. NuF attenuated tumor progression, inhibited PTHrP-induced adipose tissue browning, and maintained adipose tissue integrity by modulating heat shock protein (HSP) 72. Added together, Tarceva in synergy with NuF favorably improves cancer cachexia as well as drug efficacy.",

      "abstract": "This study was performed to determine the influence of fish oil, an omega-3 fatty acids source, supplemented to diets of goats throughout all stages of gestation on the growth and milk production of weaned female kids. Eighty German Fawn (75%) x Hair (25%) crossbred goats were randomly assigned to treatment (fish oil, FiO group) and control (Rumen protected fat, RPF group) groups during the first half of pregnancy. Subsequently, the FiO group was further allocated into FiO-FiO and FiO-RPF subgroups and RPF group was further divided into RPF-FiO and RPF-RPF subgroups containing 20 goats in each during the second half of pregnancy. The growth and feed intake of 41 female kids (aged 75.1 ± 6.73 days, with a mean live weight of 11.6 ± 3.00 kg) were recorded for a 98 day post-weaning, In the continuation of the study, live weight changes, milk yield and composition of young female goats from mating to the second month of lactation and the growth of female kids until weaning were studied for a total of 210 days. Maternal nutrition slightly influenced the live weight gain of female kids over a 98-day investigation period (p = 0.070). When growth performance was considered, a higher feed conversion efficiency of female offspring was determined in RPF-FiO (5.52) treatment group compare to female kids in other treatment groups (p = 0.086). However, the maternal feeding system significantly affected live weight in the RPF-FiO treatment group during the mating period (P = 0.054). Concerning the feed intake, maternal nutrition significantly affected the feed intake of female kids (p < 0.01) with the highest feed consumption in the FiO-RPF group. The findings of this study have shown that fish oil enriched diet given to goats during gestation improved daily live weight changes and total live weight gain of female kids despite the initial disadvantage after weaning. At mating time, the live weight of young female goats in the RPF-FiO treatment group, which exhibited the highest feed conversion ratio during the 98-day study, was higher than the remaining treatment groups. Maternal nutrition had no effect on milk yield or milk components in young goats during lactation. Young female goats born to dams in the FiO-RPF group showed better performance than the other groups regarding live weight performance of their offspring on 56th day postpartum.",

      "abstract": "Chronic wounds are becoming an increasing burden on healthcare services, as they have extended healing times and are susceptible to infection, with many failing to heal, which can lead ultimately to amputation. Due to the additional rise in antimicrobial resistance and emergence of difficult-to-treat Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacter spp. (ESKAPE pathogens), novel treatments will soon be required asides from traditional antibiotics. Many natural substances have been identified as having the potential to aid in both preventing infection and increasing the speed of wound closure processes. Manuka honey is already in some cases used as a topical treatment in the form of ointments, which in conjunction with dressings and fish skin grafts are an existing US Food and Drug Administration-approved treatment option. These existing treatment options indicate that fatty acids from fish oil and manuka honey are well tolerated by the body, and if the active components of the treatments were better understood, they could make valuable additions to topical treatment options. This review considers two prominent natural substances with established manufacturing and global distribution-marine based fatty acids (including their metabolites) and manuka honey-their function as antimicrobials and how they can aid in wound repair, two important aspects leading to resolution of chronic wounds."

      "abstract": "IMPORTANCE: Eicosanoids have a pathophysiological role in atopic dermatitis (AD), but it is unknown whether this is affected by prenatal ω-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid (n-3 LCPUFA; ie, fish oil) supplementation and genetic variations in the cyclooxygenase-1 (COX1) pathway. OBJECTIVE: To explore the association of n-3 LCPUFA supplementation during pregnancy with risk of childhood AD overall and by maternal COX1 genotype. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This prespecified secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial included mother-child pairs from the Danish Copenhagen Prospective Studies on Asthma in Childhood 2010 birth cohort, with prospective follow-up until children were aged 10 years. In the trial, maternal and child COX1 genotypes were determined, and urinary eicosanoids were quantified when the child was 1 year of age. The present study was conducted from January 2019 to December 2021, and data were analyzed from January to September 2023. INTERVENTION: A total of 736 pregnant women at 24 weeks' gestation were randomized 1:1 to 2.4 g of n-3 LCPUFA (fish oil) or placebo (olive oil) per day until 1 week post partum. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Risk of childhood AD until age 10 years overall and by maternal COX1 genotype. RESULTS: At age 10 years, 635 children (91%; 363 [57%] female) completed the clinical follow-up, and these mother-child pairs were included in this study; 321 (51%) were in the intervention group and 314 (49%) in the control group. Pregnancy n-3 LCPUFA supplementation was associated with lower urinary thromboxane A2 metabolites at age 1 year (β, -0.46; 95% CI, -0.80 to -0.13; P = .006), which was also associated with COX1 rs1330344 genotype (β per C allele, 0.47; 95% CI, 0.20-0.73; P = .001). Although neither n-3 LCPUFA supplementation (hazard ratio [HR], 1.00; 95% CI, 0.76-1.33; P = .97) nor maternal COX1 genotype (HR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.74-1.19; P = .60) was associated with risk of childhood AD until age 10 years, there was evidence of an interaction between these variables (P < .001 for interaction). Among mothers with the TT genotype, risk of AD was reduced in the n-3 LCPUFA group compared with the placebo group (390 mother-child pairs [61%]; HR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.50-0.98; P = .04); there was no association for mothers with the CT genotype (209 [33%]; HR, 1.29; 95% CI, 0.79-2.10; P = .31), and risk was increased among offspring of mothers with the CC genotype (37 [6%]; HR, 5.77; 95% CI, 1.63-20.47; P = .007). There was a significant interaction between n-3 LCPUFA supplementation and child COX1 genotype and development of AD (P = .002 for interaction). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial, the association of prenatal n-3 LCPUFA supplementation with risk of childhood AD varied by maternal COX1 genotype. The findings could be used to inform a personalized prevention strategy of providing supplementation only to pregnant individuals with the TT genotype.

      "abstract": "Formaldehyde (FA) as a common organic compound has been shown to cause placental dysfunction and fetal defects. The potential benefits of fish oil (FOil) in protecting placental structures are attributed to its antioxidant properties. This study aimed to explore the preventive role of FOil in mitigating the adverse effects of FA in pregnant rats. Thirty pregnant Wistar rats were randomly categorized into five groups of control, sham (Normal saline; Orally and intraperitoneally), FOil (0.5 ml/day; Orally), FA (5 mg/kg/bw; intraperitoneally), FA+FOil. The treatment period was from day 0-20 of pregnancy. On the 20th day of pregnancy, placental morphometric parameters were measured. The histological and histochemical analyses were performed using H&E and PAS staining, respectively. Also, the placenta tissue was analyzed for oxidative stress biomarkers, p-53 protein levels, and the expression of caspase-3 gene. The administration of FA led to a significant decrease in the weight, diameter, and thickness of the placenta, as well as a decrease in the thickness of the decidua layer, junctional and labyrinth zone, and the number of trophoblast giant cells in rat placentas. FA led to a significant increase in placental p-53 protein levels, caspase-3 expression, and oxidative stress biomarkers. Administration of FOil to pregnant rats treated with FA led to a significant decrease in morphometric and histological changes, oxidative stress, and the expression of genes associated with apoptosis. The findings suggest that the administration of FOil to FA-treated pregnant rats can protect placental histopathological changes by enhancing the activity of the antioxidant enzymes.",

      "abstract": "In this study, we designed the noncovalent binding of sodium caseinate (SC) to tannic acid (TA) to stabilize high internal phase emulsions (HIPEs) used as fish oil delivery systems. Hydrogen bonding was the dominant binding force, followed by weak hydrophobic interaction and weak van der Waals forces, as demonstrated by FTIR, fluorescence spectroscopy, and molecular docking experiments, with a binding constant of 3.25 × 106, a binding site of 1.2, and a static quenching of the binding. Increasing SC:TA from SC to 2:1 decreased the particle size from 107.37 ± 10.66 to 76.07 ± 2.77 nm and the zeta potential from -6.99 ± 2.71 to -22 ± 2.42 mV. TA increased the interfacial tension of SC, decreased the surface hydrophobicity from 1.3 × 104 to 1.6 × 103 and improved the oxidation resistance of SC. The particle size of high internal phase emulsions stabilized by complexes with different mass ratios (SC:TA from 1:0 to 2:1) increased from 4.9 ± 0.02 to 12.9 μm, the potential increased from -32.37 ± 2.7 to -35.07 ± 2.58 mV, and the instability index decreased from 0.75 to 0.02. Thicker interfacial layers could be observed by laser confocal microscopy, and an increase in the storage modulus indicated a formation of a stronger gel network. SC:TA of 1:0 showed emulsion breakage after 14 d of storage at room temperature. SC:TA of 2:1 showed the lowest degree of oil-water separation after freeze-thaw treatment. Especially, the most stable high endo-phase emulsion (at SC:TA of 2:1) prepared at each mass ratio was selected for further stability exploration. The emulsion particle size increased only from 15.63 ± 0.06 to 22.27 ± 0.35 μm at salt ion concentrations of 50-200 mM and to 249.33 ± 31.79 μm at 300 mM. The instability index and storage modulus of the high endo-phase emulsions increased gradually with increasing salt ion concentrations. At different heating temperatures (55-85 °C), the instability index of the high internal phase emulsion gradually decreased and the storage modulus gradually increased. Meanwhile, at 50 °C for 15 d of accelerated oxidation, the content of hydroperoxide decreased from 53.32 ± 0.18 to 37.48 ± 0.77 nmol/g, about 29.7 %, and the thiobarbituric acid value decreased from 1.06 × 103 to 0.8 × 103, about 24.5 %, in the high endo-phase emulsions prepared by 2:1 SC:TA compared to the fish oils, and the SC-stabilized high endo-phase only emulsion broke at the sixth day of oxidation. From the above findings, it was concluded that the high internal phase emulsion prepared with SC:TA of 2:1 can be used as a good delivery system for fish oil.",

The investigation focused on elucidating the impact of FO on epigenetic modifications in white adipose tissue (WAT) and the involvement of adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs). C57BL/6j mice were divided into two groups: control diet and HFD for 16 weeks. In the last 8 weeks, the HFD group was subdivided into HFD and HFD + FO (treated with FO). WAT was removed for RNA and protein extraction, while ASCs were isolated, cultured, and treated with leptin. All samples were analyzed using functional genomics tools, including PCR-array, RT-PCR, and Western Blot assays. Mice receiving an HFD displayed increased body mass, fat accumulation, and altered gene expression associated with WAT inflammation and dysfunction. FO supplementation attenuated these effects, a potential protective role against HFD-induced obesity. Analysis of H3K27 revealed HFD-induced changes in histone, which were partially reversed by FO treatment. This study further explored leptin signaling in ASCs, suggesting a potential mechanism for ASC dysfunction in the obesity-rich leptin environment of WAT. Overall, FO supplementation demonstrated efficacy in mitigating HFD-induced obesity, influencing epigenetic and molecular pathways, and shedding light on the role of ASCs and leptin signaling in WAT dysfunction associated with obesity."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Previous studies have linked sports-related concussions and repeated subconcussive head impacts in contact sport athletes to elevated brain injury biomarkers. Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), the primary omega-3 (n-3) highly unsaturated fatty acid (HUFA) in the brain, has shown neuroprotective effects in animal models after brain injury, but clinical research has shown mixed results. METHODS: We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study on 29 Division 1 collegiate American football players, exploring the impact of DHA (2.5 g) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) (1.0 g) supplied as ethyl esters, on levels of plasma lipids shown to cross the blood-brain barrier. Dietary intake data was collected using food frequency questionnaires (FFQ). Complex lipids and unesterified fatty acids were isolated from plasma, separated via reversed-phase liquid chromatography and analyzed by targeted lipidomics analysis. RESULTS: FFQ results indicated that participants had low dietary n-3 HUFA intake and high omega-6 (n-6):n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) and HUFA ratios at baseline. After DHA + EPA supplementation, plasma lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) containing DHA and EPA significantly increased at all timepoints (weeks 17, 21, and 26; p < 0.0001), surpassing placebo at Weeks 17 (p < 0.05) and 21 (p < 0.05). Phosphatidylcholine (PC) molecular species containing DHA or EPA, PC38:6 PC36:6, PC38:7, PC40:6, and PC40:8, increased significantly in the DHA + EPA treatment group at Weeks 17 (and 21. Plasma concentrations of non-esterified DHA and EPA rose post-supplementation in Weeks 17 and 21. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that n-3 HUFA supplementation, in the form of ethyl esters, increased the DHA and EPA containing plasma lipid pools the have the capacity to enrich brain lipids and the potential to mitigate the effects of sports-related concussions and repeated subconcussive head impacts.

Substantial evidence shows that fish oil supplements promote human immune function, suggesting they may lessen susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection and suppress viral replication by inducing interferon. Fish oil was subjected to partition chromatography and separated into two compounds (EP01 and DH01). Isolated compounds were purified and characterized using UV, FTIR, NMR, and mass spectrometry to confirm their identity. Molecular docking was studied on the SARS CoV-2 variants of concern; SARS CoV-2 WT (PDB: 6VXX), SARS CoV-2 Alpha variant (PDB: 7LWS), SARS CoV-2 Delta variant (PDB: 7TOU), SARS CoV-2 Gamma variant (PDB: 7V78), SARS CoV-2 Kappa variant (PDB: 7VX9), and SARS CoV-2 Omicron variant (PDB: 7QO7) and TMPRSS2 (PDB: 7Y0E). Further selected protein-ligand complexes were subjected to 100 ns MD simulations to predict their biological potential in the SARS-CoV-2 treatment. In-vitro biological studies were carried out to support in-silico findings. Isolated compounds EP01 and DH01 were identified as 5-Tridecyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one and 5-Heptadecyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, respectively. The compound EP01 significantly reduced (93.24 %) the viral RNA copy number with an IC50 of ~8.661 μM. EP01 proved to be a potent antiviral by in-vitro method against the SARS-CoV-2 clinical isolate, making it a promising antiviral candidate, with a single dose capable of preventing viral replication.",

However, it remains unclear whether the increase in n-3 PUFA availability could enhance the ability of nursery pigs to resist invasion by E. coli. LPS. Twenty-four 21-day-old female piglets, each two of them from the same sow fed the beef tallow (BT) or fish oil (FO) diets, were allocated into four treatment groups: BT-CON, piglets from the BT-fed sows and intraperitoneally injected with saline (9 g/L); BT-LPS, piglets from the BT-fed sows and injected with LPS (100 μg/kg body weight); FO-CON, piglets from the FO-fed sows and injected with saline; FO-LPS, piglets from the FO-fed sows and injected with LPS. Following 2 h of LPS challenge, the magnitudes of increase in body temperature approached to a marked (p < 0.01) difference between the BT-CON and BT-LPS piglets, whereas the dramatic (p < 0.01) difference between the FO-CON and FO-LPS piglets was only observed at 4 h post LPS challenge. The body temperature averaged across the time points evaluated was about 0.2°C lower (p < 0.05) in the FO group than in the BT group. The FO group had lower (p < 0.05) mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration, lower increase in serum interleukin (IL)-1β (p < 0.10) and IL-8 (p < 0.05) levels, higher (p < 0.01) serum albumin concentration, and higher (p = 0.10) ratios of jejunum villus height to crypt depth than the BT group. The FO group had much higher (p < 0.0001) ileal content of C20:5n3, C24:0, and C22:6n3, which were 2-4 times the content of the BT group. LPS challenge resulted in decreased (p < 0.05) intestinal C20:1 and C20:5n3 content, and the decrease (p < 0.05) in intestinal C20:3n6 and C24:1 content was observed in the BT-LPS piglets rather than in the FO-LPS piglets. Taken together, this study indicated that maternal consumption of fish oil protected breast-fed piglets against E. coli LPS-induced damage through reshaping of intestinal fatty acids profile, which sheds new light on the development of nutritional strategies to enhance the ability of young pigs to resist E. coli invasion."

      "abstract": "This study aimed to evaluate and analyze the effects of a flushing diet containing Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) from Lemuru (Sardinella sp) fish oil on the reproductive performance parameters of Garut ewes. Forty (n = 40) primiparous Garut ewes aged 12-14 months with an average body weight of 28.92 ± 4.94 kg were assigned into four experimental treatment groups. The experimental diets contained roughage: concentrate (30:70%) designated as control concentrate (CNT), flushing concentrate with 6% palm oil (PO), flushing concentrate with 3% palm oil mixed with 3% lemuru oil as DHA and EPA sources (PFO), and flushing concentrate with the addition of 6% lemuru oil (FO). Treatment animals were fed two weeks before and after conception and parturition (8 weeks of total flushing treatment). The addition of fish oil at either 3% (PFO) or 6% (FO) resulted in significantly higher reproductive performance of ewes by increasing the litter size, as reflected by the birth of multiple kids (P < 0.05) compared to CNT and PO. Adding fish oil (PFO and FO) also maintains gestation, resulting in increased lamb yield, especially in the FO treatment, which yields the highest lamb yield (0% single lamb birth). The lamb male ratio was also higher with fish oil supplementation (PFO and PO) (P < 0.05). This research revealed a positive effect of 6% Lemuru oil on decreasing embryo loss and increasing the proportion of twin births. These findings thus support the hypothesis that ration flushing with double the required DHA and EPA from 6% Lemuru fish oil (FO) resulted in significantly higher reproductive performance in Garut sheep.",

Hens were fed six diets as follows: 1) control diet; 2) 7.5%WFS+1.5%FO; 3) 7.5%WFS+1.5%FO+175 mg/kg vitamin E (VE); 4) 7.5%WFS+1.5%FO+175 mg/kg VE + inorganic sources of Se, Zn, and Fe (ISeZnFe); 5) 7.5%WFS+1.5%FO+175 mg/kg VE + organic sources of Se, Zn, and Fe (OSeZnFe); 6) 7.5%WFS+1.5%FO+175 mg/kg VE + nano-source of Se, Zn, and Fe (NSeZnFe) from 40-50 weeks of age. Laying hens fed 7.5% WFS, 1.5% FO, and different sources of trace elements in their diets had no negative effects on laying rate, egg weight, egg mass, feed intake, feed conversion ratio, body weight change, or survival rate compared to that of hens fed the control diet. Dietary treatments did not negatively affect the external and internal egg characteristics or egg sensory attributes. Feeding 7.5%WFS+1.5%FO+VE+ISeZnFe positively influenced yolk color in fresh eggs. Dietary treatments had a significant impact on egg nutritional composition, with the highest levels of macronutrients found in eggs from hens fed the 7.5%WFS+1.5%FO+VE+NSeZnFe treatment. The highest plasma globulin concentrations were observed in hens fed organic and nano-source trace elements. The same diets reduced plasma uric acid levels. Based on these findings, the inclusion of organic or nano-source trace minerals in diets containing WFS and FO positively affected egg quality and hen protein metabolites."

Although fish oil (FO) is renowned for its abundant n-3 PUFA content, combining FO with other natural products is considered as a viable option to support the sustainable development of FO products. This review aims to provide comprehensive insights into the advanced effects of combining FO or its components of DHA and EPA with natural products on protecting cognitive function. In two double-blind random control trials, no advanced effects were observed for adding curcumin to FO on cerebral function protection. However, 16 week's treatment of FO combined with vitamin E did not yield any advanced effects in cognitive factor scores. Several preclinical studies have demonstrated that combinations of FO with natural products can exhibit advanced effects in addressing pathological components in cognitive impairment, including neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and neuronal survival. In conclusion, evidence from clinical trials for beneficial use of FO and natural ingredients combination is lacking. Greater cohesion is needed between preclinical and clinical data to substantiate the efficacy of FO and natural product combinations in preventing or slowing the progression of cognitive decline."

      "abstract": "A twelve-week feeding experiment was undertaken to explore the impact of substituting dietary fish meal (FM) and fish oil (FO) with complex protein (CP) and canola oil (CO) in the diet of triploid rainbow trout on the quality of their fillets. The control diet (F100) contained FM (60%) and FO (18.6%) as the main protein and lipid sources. Based on this, 50% and 100% of FM and FO were substituted by CP and CO and they were named as F50 and F0, respectively. The results showed that there were no significant differences in the specific growth rates, condition factors, gutted yields, fillet yields and yellowness values as the substitution levels increased (p > 0.05). The F50 treatment obtained the highest values of fillet springiness and chewiness, improved the umami and bitter taste of the fillets by increasing the contents of inosine-5'-monophosphate and histidine, and increased lipid, protein, C18: 1n-9 and C18: 2n-6 contents (p < 0.05). The F0 treatment obtained the highest values of fillet hardness and pH, attenuated the sweet taste of the fillets by decreasing the content of glycine, and decreased the contents of EPA and DHA (p < 0.05). Both F50 and F0 treatments could increase the redness value, decrease the lightness and hue values of fillets, and increase the odor intensity, resulting in the typical fillet odors of green, fatty, orange and fishy (p < 0.05). In general, 50% and 100% of FM and FO substitution did not affect the growth of trout, but it did affect quality. Compared to the F100 treatment, the fillet quality of the F0 treatment was similar to the F50 treatment and could improve the appearance and odor intensity of the fillets. However, the difference was that the F50 treatment increased the springiness, umami, bitterness and lipid nutritional value of the fillets, but the F0 treatment increased the hardness, decreased the sweetness, and decreased the lipid, EPA and DHA contents of the fillets."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Intestinal failure-associated liver disease (IFALD) is a complication of long-term PN use, attributed to the use of ω-6 injectable lipid emulsions (ILE). Fish oil (FO) ILE have been successful in reversing liver injury in neonates. Evidence for pure FO ILE use in adult patients is limited. METHODS: Case series of the use of FO lipid emulsions in adults with IFALD from the University of Chicago PN registry. Analysis of medical charts and PN formulations was performed. RESULTS: Three cases of IFALD treated with FO ILE were identified. The first case was a 30-year-old man with short bowel syndrome (SBS), hyperbilirubinemia, and biopsy-proven IFALD. Following a change from a soy lipid emulsion to FO lipid emulsion, his liver tests rapidly improved and remained stable over 202 weeks of use. The second case was a 76-year-old woman with intestinal failure (IF) due to a frozen bowel. A change from a soy ILE to a composite lipid and later to a pure FO ILE did not result in improvement in her liver tests. The third case was a 28-year-old man with SBS and biopsy-proven IFALD. Change to a composite ILE and subsequently FO lipid emulsion resulted in a gradual improvement in liver tests. No clinical essential fatty acid (EFA) deficiencies were identified during treatment. CONCLUSION: FO ILE may be effective in the treatment of adult patients with cholestatic IFALD. Use is safe with no EFA deficiencies detected in up to 4 years of use.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to provide preliminary data on the effect of a long chain monounsaturated oil rich in cetoleic acid on the omega-3 index, a validated measure of EPA and DHA in blood cells, as well as a potential effect of the oil on skin quality. DESIGN: Two intervention studies were performed, each as double blinded, placebo controlled, randomised nutritional trials. The CetoIndex study (N = 55) measured omega-3 index using a blood spot collection kit (Omegaquant). The Optihud study (N = 28) measured skin quality parameters in healthy women using the VISIA system. The cetoleic-rich-oil (CRO) was an oil derived from North Atlantic fish with a predominance of long chain mono-unsaturated fatty acids including cetoleic acid (C22:1 n-11) and gondoic acid (C20:1 n-9). RESULTS: In a placebo-controlled study, the omega-3 index in healthy volunteers was increased similar to that seen with an oil with higher levels of omega-3 fatty acids. In a separate placebo-controlled study, the CRO reduced erythema in skin, which is a marker of inflammation. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this pilot study suggest that the use of a CRO increases the omega-3 index more than expected from the levels of EPA and DHA in the oil. The CRO may potentially have benefits on skin inflammation. SUMMARY: Long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFA), particularly eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), are commonly taken as dietary supplements for a range of health benefits. Other marine fatty acids may also provide health benefits and it is of interest to understand their activity. Long chain mono-unsaturated fatty acids (LCMUFA) have shown biological activity in studies of metabolic health in animal models. Here, we report two intervention studies using a fish oil with a high LCMUFA content where cetoleic acid is the predominant fatty acid (Cetoleic rich oil: CRO). In CetoIndex, a placebo-controlled study in 55 healthy volunteers, the omega-3 index increased similarly to that seen with an oil containing higher levels of omega-3 fatty acids. In Optihud, a placebo-controlled study in 28 female volunteers, the CRO reduced erythema in skin, which is a marker of inflammation. The results of this pilot study support the use of a CRO for increasing the omega-3 index with potential benefits on skin inflammation.",

The pharmacokinetics (PKs), such as the area under the plot of plasma concentration (AUC), and the peak blood concentration (Cmax) of the different FA metabolites including HDHAs, HETEs, HEPEs, RvD1, RvD5, RvE1, and RvE2, were determined over a total period of 24 h. Blood concentrations of EPA (26,920.0 ± 10,021.0 ng/mL·h) were significantly higher with respect to AUC0-24 following LMF treatment vs STD and ENT; when measured incrementally, blood concentrations of total n-3 FAs (EPA/DHA/DPA3) up to 11 times higher were observed for LMF vs STD (iAUC 0-24: 16,150.0 ± 5454.0 vs 1498.9 ± 443.0; p ≤ 0.0001). Significant differences in n-3 metabolites including oxylipins were found between STD and LMF with respect to 12-HEPE, 9-HEPE, 12-HETE, and RvD1; 9-HEPE levels were significantly higher following the STD vs. ENT treatment. Furthermore, within the scope of this study, changes in blood lipid levels (i.e., cholesterol, triglycerides, LDL, and HDL) were monitored in participants for up to 120 h post-treatment; a significant decrease in serum triglycerides was detected in participants (~20%) following the LMF treatment; no significant deviations from the baseline were detected for all the other lipid biomarkers in any of the treatment groups. Despite a lower administered dose, LMF provided higher blood concentrations of n-3 FAs and certain anti-inflammatory n-3 metabolites in human participants-potentially leading to better health outcomes."

      "abstract": "CONTEXT: Menhaden fish oil (FO) is widely recognized for inhibiting neuroinflammatory responses and preserving brain function. Nevertheless, the mechanisms of FO influencing brain cognitive function in diabetic states remain unclear. OBJECTIVE: This study examines the potential role of FO in suppressing LPS-induced neuroinflammation and cognitive impairment in diabetic animals (DA). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty male Wistar rats were divided into 5 groups: i) DA received LPS induction (DA-LPS); ii) DA received LPS induction and 1 g/kg FO (DA-LPS-1FO); iii) DA received LPS induction and 3 g/kg FO (DA-LPS-3FO); iv) animals received normal saline and 3 g/kg FO (NS-3FO) and v) control animals received normal saline (CTRL). Y-maze test was used to measure cognitive performance, while brain samples were collected for inflammatory markers and morphological analysis. RESULTS: DA received LPS induction, and 1 or 3 g/kg FO significantly inhibited hyperglycaemia and brain inflammation, as evidenced by lowered levels of pro-inflammatory mediators. Additionally, both DA-LPS-1FO and DA-LPS-3FO groups exhibited a notable reduction in neuronal damage and glial cell migration compared to the other groups. These results were correlated with the increasing number of entries and time spent in the novel arm of the Y-maze test. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: This study indicates that supplementation of menhaden FO inhibits the LPS signaling pathway and protects against neuroinflammation, consequently maintaining cognitive performance in diabetic animals. Thus, the current study suggested that fish oil may be effective as a supporting therapy option for diabetes to avoid diabetes-cognitive impairment.",

At day 29 and 30 of age, each piglet was orally inoculated with 6.7 × 108 and 3.96 × 108 CFU of F4 and F18 E. coli, respectively. Blood was sampled from all piglets on day 28 before E. coli challenge and on day 35 of age to investigate immunological and oxidative stress markers in plasma. One week after weaning and exposure to E. coli, a general reduction in the α-tocopherol concentration and activity of GPX1 was obtained. Vitamin E supplementation lowered the extent of lipid peroxidation and improved the antioxidative status and immune responses after E. coli challenge. Hemp oil had the greatest effect on antioxidant enzyme activity. Provision of hemp oil and vitamin E to suckling piglets may reduce the incidence of post-weaning diarrhea.",

Although analyses of the substances have identified different components within them, it is not fully understood how these components interact and contribute to the observed effect. With the increase in multi-drug resistant strains of bacteria found in infections, new treatment options are needed. This study aimed to assess the antimicrobial abilities of fish oil components, including docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), and derived resolvins (RvE1, RvD2, and RvD3), as well as two varieties of manuka honey, against a panel of medically relevant microorganisms and antimicrobial resistant organisms, such as Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and carbapenem-resistant Escherichia coli. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBC) were identified; further minimum biofilm eradication concentrations (MBEC) were investigated for responsive organisms, including S. aureus, E. coli, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Concurrent with the existing literature, manuka honey was found to be a broad-spectrum antimicrobial with varied potency according to methylglyoxal content. DHA and EPA were both effective against Gram-positive and negative bacteria, but some drug-resistant strains or pathogens were not protected by a capsule. Only E. coli was inhibited by the resolvins."

      "abstract": "Obesity is a fast-growing epidemic affecting more than 40% of the US population and leads to co-morbidities such as type 2 diabetes and cancer. More importantly, there is a rapid increase in childhood obesity associated with obesity in parents. Further, offspring are encoded with approximately half of their genetic information from the paternal side. Obesity in fathers at the preconceptional period likely influences the intergenerational development of obesity. This study focuses on the role of fish oil supplementation as a non-pharmacological intervention in fathers and its impact on childhood obesity using animal models. Male mice were fed a low-fat diet or high-fat diet with or without fish oil for 10 weeks and mated with female mice on a chow diet. Offspring were then continued on a chow diet until 8 or 16 weeks. In vivo insulin tolerance was tested to assess the metabolic health of offspring. Further, adipose tissue was harvested upon sacrifice, and genetic markers of inflammation and lipid metabolism in the tissue were analyzed. Offspring of males supplemented with fish oil showed lower body weight, improved insulin tolerance, and altered inflammatory markers. Markers of fatty acid oxidation were higher, while markers of fatty acid synthesis were lower in offspring of fathers fed fish oil. This supports fish oil as an accessible intervention to improve offspring metabolic health.",

      "abstract": "The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of the incremental levels of n-3 fatty acids (FA) in starter feed (SF) on growth and metabolic performance of milk-fed calves. From day 3 of age, 30 female calves (39.4 ± 3.1 kg of body weight) were randomly assigned to one of three dietary treatments: (1) SF supplemented with 3.3% palm fatty acids (PO), (2) SF supplemented with 1.7% of PO and 1.9% fish oil (PFO), or (3) SF supplemented with 3.9% fish oil (FO). Chopped straw (7.5% of DM) was included in the SF of all treatments as total mixed ration (TMR). Diets had similar energy and protein contents. Total n-3 FA (% of total FA) and n-6/n-3 of PO, PFO, and FO were 1.90, 6.80, and 11.8 and 15.5, 4.50, and 2.70, respectively. The BW was greater for calves receiving FO (60.2 ± 0.3 kg) compared with PFO (58.7 ± 0.3 kg; p = 0.007) and tended to be greater for calves receiving FO vs. PO (59.0 ± 0.3 kg; p = 0.050). Because there was no interaction effect between diet × week of experiment, the greater BW of FO could not be attributed to the dietary treatment. Accordingly, average daily gain, total dry matter intake (DMI), starter DMI, and gain to intake ratio (G:FI) did not differ among dietary treatments during the entire period of the study (p > 0.05). Dietary treatments did not impact body size parameters such as body length, body girth, withers height, heart girth, hip height, and width (p > 0.05). Neither ruminal fermentation parameters nor blood variables were influenced by supplementing the types of oil at different time points. Calves' behavioral parameters, such as standing, lying, eating, and ruminating, were not influenced by different dietary treatments (p > 0.05). The number of days with abnormal fecal score was not different among dietary groups (p > 0.05). Overall, our findings suggest that changing the n-6/n-3 ratio in starter feed by incremental replacement of palm fatty acid with fish oil at a moderate supplemental level of ~3% of DM may not affect the growth and metabolic performance of young calves under non-challenged conditions."

OBJECTIVES: Here, we report follow-up at age 10 y including assessment of metabolic health. METHODS: This is a follow-up analysis of a randomized clinical trial conducted among 736 pregnant females and their offspring participating in the Copenhagen Prospective Studies on Asthma in Childhood mother-child cohort. The intervention was 2.4 g n-3 (ω-3) Long-Chain PolyUnsaturated Fatty Acid (n-3 LCPUFA) or control daily from pregnancy week 24 until 1 wk after birth. Outcomes were anthropometric measurements, body composition from Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis, blood pressure, concentrations of triglycerides, cholesterol, glucose, and C-peptide from fasting blood samples, and a metabolic syndrome score was calculated. Anthropometric measurements and body composition were prespecified secondary endpoints of the n-3 LCPUFA trial, and others were exploratory. RESULTS: Children in the n-3 LCPUFA group had a higher mean BMI at age 10 year compared to the control group: 17.4 (SD: 2.44) compared with 16.9 (2.28); P = 0.020 and a higher odds ratio of having overweight (odds ratio: 1.53; 95% CI: 1.01, 2.33; P = 0.047). This corresponded to differences in body composition in terms of increased lean mass (0.49 kg; 95% CI: -0.20, 1.14; P = 0.17), fat mass (0.49 kg; 95% CI: -0.03, 1.01; P = 0.06), and fat percent (0.74%; 95% CI: -0.01, 1.49; P = 0.053) compared to the control group. Children in the n-3 LCPUFA group had a higher metabolic syndrome score compared to the control (mean difference: 0.19; 95% CI: -0.02, 0.39; P = 0.053). CONCLUSIONS: In this randomized clinical trial, children of mothers receiving n-3 LCPUFA supplementation had increased BMI at age 10 y, increased risk of being overweight, and a tendency of increased fat percentage and higher metabolic syndrome score. These findings suggest potential adverse health effects from n-3 LCPUFA supplementation during pregnancy and need to be replicated in future independent studies. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT00798226.",

Delta-like ligand (DLL)-4/Notch inhibits angiogenesis, while Jagged-1/Notch promotes angiogenesis. We tested the hypothesis that early supplementation with antioxidants and/or fish oil curtails severe OIR by inducing DLL-4/Notch and reducing Jagged-1/Notch. Newborn rats were exposed to brief intermittent hypoxia (IH) during hyperoxia, during which they received daily oral supplements of (1) fish oil, (2) coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) in olive oil (OO), (3) glutathione nanoparticles (nGSH), (4) fish oil + CoQ10, or (5) OO (controls) from birth (P0) to P14. At P14, the pups were placed in room air (RA) until P21, with no further treatment. Oxidative stress, apoptosis, ocular histopathology, and Notch signaling were assessed. Neonatal IH resulted in severe retinal damage consistent with retinopathy of prematurity (ROP). Retinal damage was associated with induced oxidative stress and Jagged-1/Notch signaling, as well as reduced DLL-4/Notch signaling. All treatments reversed these outcomes, but nGSH produced the most beneficial outcomes. Severe OIR promoted the induction of Jagged-1/Notch and curtailed DLL-4/Notch, which was an effect that could be reversed with nGSH supplementation. These findings may indicate a potential alternate pathway for ROP treatment and/or prevention."

Purpose/Objectives: The overall objectives of this evaluation are to assess the need for a fish oil deprescribing process, to analyze the role of student pharmacists in deprescribing, and to evaluate the effectiveness of a fish oil deprescribing service. Methods: This project integrated three doctor of pharmacy students in their third year of pharmacy school who were enrolled in a yearlong class about improving healthcare for rural populations and the quality improvement research process. Four primary care clinic patient panels who were prescribed fish oil were assessed. Chart reviews were conducted, and patients were contacted to deprescribe their fish oil by the student and offer statin or lipid therapy modifications, if applicable. Results: A generated report identified 106 patients who had active prescriptions for fish oil. After application of exclusion criteria, 68 patients were included in the evaluation. A total of 76.2% of patients accepted at least one therapy modification offered by the pharmacy student. Conclusion: This evaluation demonstrates the positive impact of the integration of student pharmacists for deprescribing in a primary care setting. Opportunities exist to further explore student pharmacist roles within ambulatory care clinic models."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Middle-aged women with obesity are at increased risk of iron overload and iron disorder is known to disrupt n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid homeostasis. We evaluated relationships between pretreatment hemoglobin and n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid levels, and tested whether pretreatment hemoglobin contributed to inter-individual variability in weight loss with special focus on changes in body weight, iron and n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid profiles. STUDY DESIGN: 117 middle and older aged women with obesity and more than two metabolic abnormalities were randomized to a 12-week hypocaloric diet without or with fish oil supplementation. Blood iron biomarker and erythrocyte membrane phospholipid profiles were evaluated. MAIN OUTCOME: The absolute change from baseline to week 12 in serum iron and erythrocyte n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid levels according to pretreatment hemoglobin tertiles and fish oil supplementation. RESULTS: A Pearson correlation analysis showed that pretreatment hemoglobin levels were negatively correlated with linoleic acid (r = -0.231), α-linoleic acid (r = -0.279), and n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (r = -0.217) (all p < 0.05). Dietary weight loss markedly enhanced erythrocyte membrane lipids of linoleic acid, α-linoleic acid, and n-6 and n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid only in those women with the highest pretreatment hemoglobin levels (tertile 3) (all p < 0.05). Fish oil supplementation increased bioavailable iron in women with moderate pretreatment hemoglobin levels (tertile 2) (p < 0.05) and, to a lesser extent, prevented a reduction in circulating iron in those with the lowest hemoglobin levels (tertile 1). CONCLUSION: Dietary weight loss is an effective treatment program to manage obesity-related iron and n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid disorders, particularly for middle-aged women with obesity and iron overload.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Montelukast is a well-known leukotriene receptor antagonist commonly used in treating allergic rhinitis and asthma. Omega-3 fatty acid is also known as an antiallergic and immunomodulator molecule. This study aimed to elucidate the efficacy of systemic montelukast and omega-3 fatty acid treatment in allergic rhinitis models in Wistar Hannover rats. METHODS: This research was conducted on 28 healthy Wistar Hannover rats weighing 250-350 g. After establishing the allergic rhinitis model, nasal symptoms were observed and scored, and the nasal mucosa of all rats was investigated histologically. Light microscopy was utilized to evaluate the degree of ciliary loss, goblet cell hyperplasia, vascular congestion, vascular proliferation, inflammatory cell infiltration, eosinophil infiltration, and hypertrophy in chondrocytes. RESULTS: As a result of the analysis of the data obtained from the study, it was determined that typical allergic rhinitis symptoms such as nasal scratching and sneezing were significantly reduced in the rats in the montelukast and omega-3 treated group, and these symptoms did not increase after repeated intranasal OVA-protease applications. Histological examinations after fish oil treatment did not reveal typical inflammatory changes in allergic rhinitis. None of the rats in the montelukast and omega-3 groups had any increase in goblet cells, whereas 14.3% of the rats in the control group and 28.6% of the rats in the allergic rhinitis group had mild increase. Last but not least, 71.4% of rats in the allergic rhinitis group had a moderate increase. The difference between the groups was statistically significant (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Regarding the outcomes of this research, it was observed that w-3 fatty acids had antiallergic effects, both histopathological and clinical, in the allergic rhinitis model. We believe that further randomized controlled trials incorporating larger cohorts are warranted to verify the use of omega-3 fatty acids in treating allergic rhinitis.

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: A high-fat/high-sucrose diet leads to adverse metabolic changes that affect insulin sensitivity, function, and secretion. The source of fat in the diet might inhibit or increase this adverse effect. Fish oil and cocoa butter are a significant part of our diets. Yet comparisons of these commonly used fat sources with high sucrose on pancreas morphology and function are not made. This study investigated the comparative effects of a fish oil-based high-fat/high-sucrose diet (Fish-HFDS) versus a cocoa butter-based high-fat/high-sucrose diet (Cocoa-HFDS) on endocrine pancreas morphology and function in mice. METHODS: C57BL/6 male mice (n=12) were randomly assigned to dietary intervention either Fish-HFDS (n=6) or Cocoa-HFDS (n=6) for 22 weeks. Intraperitoneal glucose and insulin tolerance tests (IP-GTT and IP-ITT) were performed after 20-21 weeks of dietary intervention. Plasma concentrations of c-peptide, insulin, glucagon, GLP-1, and leptin were measured by Milliplex kit. Pancreatic tissues were collected for immunohistochemistry to measure islet number and composition. Tissues were multi-labelled with antibodies against insulin and glucagon, also including expression on Pdx1-positive cells. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Fish-HFDS-fed mice showed significantly reduced food intake and body weight gain compared to Cocoa-HFDS-fed mice. Fish-HFDS group had lower fasting blood glucose concentration and area under the curve (AUC) for both GTT and ITT. Plasma c-peptide, insulin, glucagon, and GLP-1 concentrations were increased in the Fish-HFDS group. Interestingly, mice fed the Fish-HFDS diet displayed higher plasma leptin concentration. Histochemical analysis revealed a significant increase in endocrine pancreas β-cells and islet numbers in mice fed Fish-HFDS compared to the Cocoa-HFDS group. Taken together, these findings suggest that in a high-fat/high-sucrose dietary setting, the source of the fat, especially fish oil, can ameliorate the effect of sucrose on glucose homeostasis and endocrine pancreas morphology and function.",

Fish with an average initial body weight of 14.29 g were selected for the feeding experiment. FM accounting for 0%, 5%, and 10% of the diet was replaced by PBM. For each grade of FM replacement, 5% FO or MO was used as added oil. The six experimental diets were designated as FO-FM, MO-FM, FO-5PBM, MO-5PBM, FO-10PBM, and MO-10PBM, respectively. Each treatment was performed in triplicate with 30 fish per replicate. The feeding period was 45 days. There was no significant difference in growth performance among the groups. Dietary supplementation of both PBM and MO had marginal effects on whole-fish proximate composition, except that dietary MO supplementation significantly increased the liver moisture content. In serum, there were no significant differences in contents of triglyceride, total cholesterol, total bile acid, and protein carbonyl among groups, but the malondialdehyde content was reduced by MO. The fatty acid composition in fish mirrored those in the diets, but the omega-3 sparing effects of saturated and monounsaturated fatty acid in MO can still be observed. Dietary PBM and MO had marginal effects on free amino acid composition and texture of fish muscle, but exerted complicated effects on the muscle volatile flavor compound composition. In conclusion, combined fishmeal (10% of the diet) and fish oil (5% of the diet) replacement with poultry byproduct and mixed oil (poultry oil + coconut oil) had no adverse effects on the growth performance and body proximate composition of farmed tiger puffer. However, these replacements changed the muscle flavor compound profile."

A commercial oil called EPAX® Evolve 05 with an up-concentration of VLCFAs of approximately 10 times, has been developed as a dietary supplement by Epax Norway AS. A series of toxicological studies were performed using mice and rats to determine the safety and toxicity of repeat dosing with a gavage administered VLCFA formulation. The results suggest transient lipid accumulation in kidneys and liver. Lipid accumulation was seen with the test item and with the soya control but was not dose related. Liver and kidney lipid accumulation, whilst present in 14- day repeat dose study, was absent in a 90-day rat study. No treatment-effect was seen in urine analysis in any of the studies. No treatment-related effects were seen with a functional observation battery, ophthalmological examination, haematology, urine analysis, oestrus cycle, thyroid hormones, organ weight, or histopathology. In the 90-day study the liver enzymes ALP, AST and ALT were statistically significantly increased with test item but within control values. There were no associated histological findings in the liver suggesting there was no toxic effect and the normalisation of values for all liver enzymes in the recovery groups suggests an adaptive response rather than a prevailing toxic response. The no-observed-adverse-effect level (NOAEL) was determined as 1200 mg VLCFA/kg b.w./day.",

The technological and biological properties of plant-based substrates, especially protein hydrolysates, have increased their use as functional ingredients for food matrices. The present study evaluates the physical and oxidative stabilities of 50 g kg-1 fish oil-in-water emulsions where protein hydrolysates from olive and sunflower seeds were incorporated at 20 g kg-1 protein as natural emulsifiers. The goal was to investigate the effect of protein source (i.e. olive and sunflower seeds), enzyme (i.e. subtilisin and trypsin) and degree of hydrolysis (5%, 8% and 11%) on the ability of the hydrolysate to stabilize the emulsion and retard lipid oxidation over a 7-day storage period. RESULTS: The plant protein hydrolysates displayed different emulsifying and antioxidant capacities when incorporated into the fish oil-in-water emulsions. The hydrolysates with degrees of hydrolysis (DH) of 5%, especially those from sunflower seed meal, provided higher physical stability, regardless of the enzymatic treatment. For example, the average D [2, 3] values for the emulsions containing sunflower subtilisin hydrolysates at DH 5% only slightly increased from 1.21 ± 0.02 μm (day 0) to 2.01 ± 0.04 μm (day 7). Moreover, the emulsions stabilized with sunflower or olive seed hydrolysates at DH 5% were stable against lipid oxidation throughout the storage experiment, with no significant variation in the oxidation indices between days 0 and 4. CONCLUSION: The results of the present study support the use of sunflower seed hydrolysates at DH 5% as natural emulsifiers for fish oil-in-water emulsions, providing both physical and chemical stability against lipid oxidation. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.",

Results showed that HPM treatment (especially 80 MPa) significantly changed the secondary structure of CS, and 80 MPa-PCS-EGCG had the best emulsifying and antioxidant activities. In addition, after HPM treatment and EGCG bonding, CS formed a thicker interface layer on the surface of oil droplets, which could better protect the fish oil from the influence by oxygen, temperature and ion concentration. Moreover, the fish oil emulsion stabilized by PCS-EGCG complex significantly delayed the release of free fatty acids subjected to in vitro digestion. Conclusively, HPM-treated CS-EGCG complex could be a potential emulsifier to improve the stability of fish oil emulsions.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: During fetal development, the proper development of neural and visual systems relies on the maternal supplementation of omega-3 fatty acids through placental transfer. Pregnant women are strongly advised to augment their diet with additional sources of omega-3, such as fish oil (FO). This supplementation has been linked to a reduced risk of preterm birth, pre-eclampsia, and perinatal depression. Recently, higher doses of omega-3 supplementation have been recommended for pregnant women. Considering that omega-3 fatty acids, particularly docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), play a crucial role in maintaining the delicate homeostasis required for the proper functioning of the retina and photoreceptors the effects of high-dose fish oil (FO) supplementation during pregnancy and lactation on the retina and retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE) in healthy offspring warrant better understanding. METHODS: The fatty acid content and the changes in the expression of the genes regulating cholesterol homeostasis and DHA transport in the retina and RPE were evaluated following the high-dose FO supplementation. RESULTS: Our study demonstrated that despite the high-dose FO treatment during pregnancy and lactation, the rigorous DHA homeostasis in the retina and RPE of the two-month-old offspring remained balanced. Another significant finding of this study is the increase in the expression levels of major facilitator superfamily domain-containing protein (Mfsd2a), a primary DHA transporter. Mfsd2a also serves as a major regulator of transcytosis during development, and a reduction in Mfsd2a levels poses a major risk for the development of leaky blood vessels. CONCLUSION: Impairment of the blood-retinal barrier (BRB) is associated with the development of numerous ocular diseases, and a better understanding of how to manipulate transcytosis in the BRB during development can enhance drug delivery through the BRB or contribute to the repair of central nervous system (CNS) barriers."

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this systematic review was to analyze the effects of fish-oil-capsule supplementation on the glycemic and lipid profiles of pregnant women. DATA SOURCES: A systematic search was conducted of the MEDLINE (by PubMed), Embase, Cochrane Library (CENTRAL) databases and gray literature, including preprints for all relevant studies published in English, with no date restrictions. DATA EXTRACTION: The estimated pooled results were analyzed using a random-effects model and represented by mean differences (MDs) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs). The analyses were performed with R software, version 4.2.1, using the \"Meta\" packages, versions 6.0-0. DATA ANALYSIS: Fifteen eligible studies were included after screening. In a pooled analysis, overall fish-oil supplementation had no effect on parameters compared with placebo. In the subgroup analysis, fish-oil supplementation may be beneficial in insulin (MD: -2.11 IU/mL; 95% CI: -3.86, -0.36) and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) (MD: -0.71; 95% CI: -1.14, -0.29) indices, with heterogeneity (I2 =0%) among pregnant women with diabetes mellitus. In the subgroup with doses of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) below 200 mg, there was a reduction in HOMA-IR in the intervention group (MD: -0.60; 95% CI: -1.14, -0.06). CONCLUSION: Pregnant women taking fish-oil capsules showed significant beneficial changes in the subgroups of type 2 diabetes and EPA dosages below 200 mg for insulin and HOMA-IR.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Oxaliplatin-induced peripheral neuropathy (OIPN) in general and painful OIPN in particular is a debilitating late effect that severely affects cancer survivors' quality of life and causes premature cessation of potentially lifesaving treatment. No preventive treatments and no effective treatment for chronic OIPN exist despite many attempts. One of several suggested mechanisms includes neuroinflammation as a contributing factor to OIPN. Fish oil containing long-chain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 LCPUFAs) are precursors to specialized proresolving mediators that mediate the resolution of inflammation. Our primary hypothesis is that a high supplementation of n-3 LCPUFAs will lower the prevalence and severity of OIPN. METHODS: The OxaNeuro project is an investigator-initiated, multicenter, double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical study. We will include 120 patients eligible to receive adjuvant oxaliplatin after colorectal cancer surgery. Patients will receive fish oil capsules containing n-3 LCPUFAs or corn oil daily for 8 months. The primary endpoint is the prevalence of OIPN at 8 months defined as relevant symptoms, including one of the following: abnormal nerve conduction screening, abnormal vibration threshold test, abnormal skin biopsy, or abnormal pinprick test. Additional endpoints include the intensity and severity of OIPN-related neuropathic pain, patient-reported OIPN symptoms, quality of life, mental health symptoms, body composition, and cognitive evaluation. Furthermore, we will evaluate inflammatory biomarkers in blood samples and skin biopsies, including the potential OIPN biomarker neurofilament light protein (NfL) which will be measured before each cycle of chemotherapy. DISCUSSION: If readily available fish oil supplementation alleviates OIPN prevalence and severity, it will significantly improve the lives of both cancer survivors and palliative cancer patients receiving oxaliplatin; it will improve their quality of life, optimize chemotherapeutic treatment plans by lowering the need for dose reduction or premature cessation, and potentially increase survival.

However, they have rarely been tested in combination. The aim of our study was to test the short-term effect of a combined nutraceutical including red yeast rice and PUFAs on plasma lipids, jigh-sensitive C-reactive protein (hsCRP), and endothelial function in healthy subjects. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We carried out a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial with parallel groups testing the effect of 8 weeks of supplementation with softgels containing red yeast rice (2.8 mg monacolins) and PUFAs (588 mg of fish oil, standardized in PUFAs: 350 EPA, 45 mg DHA) versus placebo. A full lipid panel, hsCRP, and endothelial reactivity were measured at the baseline and after 8 weeks of treatment. RESULTS: The tested combined nutraceutical was very well tolerated, and after 8 weeks of supplementation it was associated with a 17.3 ±3.4% reduction of lipid-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C), a 12.1 ±2.2% reduction of total cholesterol (TC), a 22.3 ±4.3% reduction of apoB, and a -14.9 ±1.8% reduction of hsCRP, as well as a significant improvement of pulse volume change by 5.0 ±0.9%. CONCLUSIONS: The tested combined dietary supplement containing red yeast rice and PUFAs was very well tolerated and significantly improved LDL-C, TC, apoB, hsCRP and endothelial function in healthy subjects with suboptimal LDL-cholesterolaemia."

This is an experimental model that included 16 male BALB/c mice (Mus musculus) divided into three groups (G1 (standard commercial chow and 0.9% saline solution), G2 (hypercholesterolemic diet and 0.9% saline solution) and G3 (hypercholesterolemic diet and fish oil)) for 8 weeks. There was no significant difference in the treatment with omega-3-rich fish oil in the lipid profile (p > 0.05). In the histological analysis, group G2 detected the presence of hepatitis and liver tissue necrosis, but this was not observed in group G3. As for the morphometry in the light area of the vessel, the G1 group had a higher score (2.62 ± 0.36 mm2) when compared to G2 (2.10 ± 0.16 mm2) and G3 (2.26 ± 0.25 mm2) (p < 0.05). The vessel wall thickness did not differ between the groups (p > 0.05). It is concluded that supplementation with fish oil rich in omega-3 carried out in this study may have a protective effect on liver tissue, but it has not yet improved the lipid and morphometric profile. Despite this research being preliminary, it is a relevant study with future prospects for improving the doses of EPA and DHA in order to better elucidate the benefits of fish oil in models of dyslipidemia."

Furthermore, EPA is an FDA-approved treatment of patients with high risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD); however, the cardioprotective mechanisms are unclear. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to determine if fish oil supplementation is cardioprotective due to beneficial modifications in HDL particles. METHODS: Seven fish oil naïve subjects without a history of CVD were recruited to take a regimen of fish oil (1125 mg EPA and 875 mg DHA daily) for 30 d, followed by a 30-d washout period wherein no fish oil supplements were taken. HDL isolated from fasting whole blood at each time point via 2-step ultracentrifugation (ucHDL) was assessed for proteome, lipidome, cholesterol efflux capacity (CEC), and anti-inflammatory capacity. RESULTS: Following fish oil supplementation, the HDL-associated proteins immunoglobulin heavy constant γ1, immunoglobulin heavy constant α1, apolipoprotein D, and phospholipid transfer protein decreased compared to baseline (P < 0.05). The HDL-associated phospholipid families sphingomyelins, phosphatidylcholines, and phosphatidylserines increased after fish oil supplementation relative to baseline (P < 0.05). Compared to baseline, fish oil supplementation increased serum HDL's CEC (P = 0.002). Fish oil-induced changes (Post compared with Baseline) in serum HDL's CEC positively correlated with plasma EPA levels (R2 = 0.7256; P = 0.015). Similarly, fish oil-induced changes in ucHDL's CEC positively correlated with ucHDL's ability to reduce interleukin 10 (R2 = 0.7353; P = 0.014) and interleukin 6 mRNA expression (R2 = 0.6322; P =0.033) in a human macrophage cell line. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, fish oil supplementation improved HDL's sterol efflux capacity through comprehensive modifications to its proteome and lipidome.",

Omega-3 polyunsaturated essential fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs) are associated with a reduced risk of CV events and death in non-dialysis patients and in patients with established CV disease but n-3 PUFAs have not been evaluated in the high risk KFRT patient population. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This multicentre randomised, placebo controlled, parallel pragmatic clinical trial tests the hypothesis that oral supplementation with n-3 PUFA, when added to usual care, leads to a reduction in the rate of serious CV events in haemodialysis patients when compared with usual care plus matching placebo. A target sample size of 1100 KFRT patients will be recruited from 26 dialysis units in Canada and Australia and randomised to n-3 PUFA or matched placebo in a 1:1 ratio with an expected intervention period of at least 3.5 years. The primary outcome to be analysed and compared between intervention groups is the rate of all, not just the first, serious CV events which include sudden and non-sudden cardiac death, fatal and non-fatal myocardial infarction, stroke, and peripheral vascular disease events.

Fish oil (FO) has several benefits in reducing obesity, but its intergenerational role in reducing the effects of paternal obesity has not been established. Hence, we hypothesized that FO supplementation to an obese father during the pre-conceptional period could improve the metabolic health of the offspring, specifically in the liver. Three groups of male mice were fed with a low-fat (LF), high-fat (HF), or high-fat diet supplemented with FO (HF-FO) for 10 weeks and were then allowed to mate with female mice fed a chow diet. Offspring were sacrificed at 16 weeks. The liver tissue was harvested for genomic and histological analyses. The offspring of HF and HF-FO fathers were heavier compared to that of the LF mice during 9-16 weeks. The glucose tolerance of the offspring of HF-FO fathers were significantly improved as compared to the offspring of HF fathers. Paternal FO supplementation significantly lowered inflammation and fatty acid synthesis biomarkers and increased fatty acid oxidation biomarkers in the offspring liver. In summary, FO supplementation in fathers shows the potential to reduce metabolic and cardiovascular diseases through genetic means in offspring.",

      "abstract": "The primary aim of this research was to assess the impact of supplementing fish oil into the diet of pregnant Awassi ewes on various aspects of the dam's productive performance, offspring birth weight, colostrum yield and quality, milk production and composition, postpartum offspring performance, and the composition of fatty acids in milk. In this study, two different fat sources, namely palm oil (PO) and fish oil (FO), were utilized, with both being included at a rate of 2.4% of dietary dry matter (DM) during the initial 65 days of gestation (early gestation stage), and then at 2.1% DM from day 65 of gestation until lambing (late gestation stage). The study subjects were Awassi ewes with a body weight (BW) averaging 57 ± 1.5 kg and an age of 3.5 ± 1.2 years. These ewes were randomly assigned to one of four dietary treatments: (i) a diet containing only palm oil from day 0 to day 150 of pregnancy (PO, n = 15); (ii) a diet containing palm oil from day 0 to day 65 of pregnancy, followed by a diet containing fish oil from day 66 to day 150 of pregnancy (POFO, n = 16); (iii) a diet containing fish oil from day 0 to day 65 of pregnancy, followed by a diet containing palm oil from day 66 to day 150 of pregnancy (FOPO, n = 16); (iv) a diet containing only fish oil from day 0 to day 150 of pregnancy (FO, n = 16). Within each treatment, ewes were housed in three replicates, with each replicate further divided into three subgroups. The first two subgroups each contained eight ewes, while the third subgroup contained nine ewes. In addition, each treatment contained 10 primiparous and 15 multiparous ewes. The results indicated that the POFO treatment led to significant increases (p < 0.05) in birth weight, gestation length, and colostrum IgG concentration. However, it also resulted in a decrease (p < 0.001) in colostrum production and a reduction (p < 0.001) in the percentage of milk fat and milk protein. Furthermore, the milk from the POFO treatment exhibited higher levels of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) (p < 0.001) compared to the PO and FOPO treatments, while the milk saturated fatty acids (SFA) were lower (p < 0.001). In conclusion, the addition of fish oil at a rate of 2.1% DM during the late pregnancy period showed promise for enhancing birth weight, colostrum IgG concentration, and the PUFA content in the milk."

      "abstract": "Very-long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (VLCPUFAs; C24-38) constitute a unique class of PUFA that have important biological roles, but the lack of a suitable dietary source has limited research in this field. We produced an n-3 C24-28-rich VLCPUFA-oil concentrated from fish oil to study its bioavailability and physiological functions in C57BL/6J mice. The serum and retinal C24:5 levels increased significantly compared to control after a single-dose gavage, and VLCPUFAs were incorporated into the liver, brain, and eyes after 8-week supplementation. Dietary VLCPUFAs resulted in favorable cardiometabolic changes, and improved electroretinography responses and visual performance. VLCPUFA supplementation changed the expression of genes involved in PPAR signaling pathways. Further in vitro studies demonstrated that the VLCPUFA-oil and chemically synthesized C24:5 are potent agonists for PPARs. The multiple potential beneficial effects of fish oil-derived VLCPUFAs on cardiometabolic risk and eye health in mice support future efforts to develop VLCPUFA-oil into a supplemental therapy."

      "abstract": "Fish oil has been known for its antioxidant, cardioprotective, anti-inflammatory, and neuroprotective characteristics due to the presence of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) that are essential for optimal brain function and mental health. The present study investigated the effect of Carcharhinus Bleekeri (Shark Fish) oil on learning and memory functions in scopolamine-induced amnesia in rats. Locomotor and memory-enhancing activity in scopolamine-induced amnesic rats was investigated by assessing the open field and passive avoidance paradigm. Forty male Albino mice were divided into 4 equal groups (n = 10) as bellow: 1 - control (received 0.9% saline), 2 - SCOP (received scopolamine 2 mg/kg for 21 days), 3 - SCOP + SFO (received scopolamine and fish oil 5 mg/kg/ day for 21 days), 4 - SCOP + Donepezil groups (received 3 mg/kg/day for 21 days). SFO produced significant (P < 0.01) locomotor and memory-enhancing activities in open-field and passive avoidance paradigm models. Additionally, SFO restored the Acetylcholine (ACh) concentration in the hippocampus (p < 0.05) and remarkably prevented the degradation of monoamines. Histology of brain tissue showed marked cellular distortion in the scopolamine-treated group, while the SFO treatment restored distortion in the brain's hippocampus region. These results suggest that the SFO significantly ameliorates scopolamine-induced spatial memory impairment by attenuating the ACh and monoamine concentrations in the rat's hippocampus.",

While fish oil (FO) has garnered great attention for its health-enhancing properties, its potential for enhancing cardiometabolic health in this demographic remains to be established. The purpose of this study was to determine the clinical efficacy of an 8 wk administration of FO combined with programmed resistance exercise training (RET) on physical function and risk factors associated with cardiometabolic health in healthy older women. Twenty, healthy, older women were randomly assigned to one of the two experimental groups: resistance training with placebo (RET-PL) or RET with fish oil (RET-FO). Physical function, blood pressure (BP), triglyceride (TG), and systemic inflammation and oxidative stress biomarkers were assessed before and after the intervention. Statistical significance was set at p ≤ 0.05. Physical function was greatly enhanced in both RET and RET-FO. Handgrip strength substantially increased only in RET-FO. RET-FO exhibited significant decreases in BP, TG, inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α and IL-6), and oxidative stress (MDA and 8-OHdG) levels, while no detectable changes were found in RET-PL. Our findings indicate that FO administration during 8 wks of RET appears to enhance muscle function and lower risk factors linked to cardiometabolic disorders in postmenopausal women.",

This study aims to investigate whether HO-1 is involved in the repair of oxidative damage induced by oxidized fish oil (OFO) in Litopenaeus vannamei by sulforaphane (SFN). The oxidative stress model of L. vannamei was established by feeding OFO feed (OFO accounts for 6%), and they were divided into the following four groups: control group (injected with dsRNA-EGFP and fed with common feed), dsRNA-HO-1 group (dsRNA-HO-1, common feed), dsRNA-HO-1 + SFN group (dsRNA-HO-1, supplement 50 mg kg-1 SFN feed), and SFN group (dsRNA-EGFP, supplement 50 mg kg-1 SFN feed). The results showed that the expression level of HO-1 in the dsRNA-HO-1 + SFN group was significantly increased compared with the dsRNA-HO-1 group (p < 0.05). The activities of SOD in muscle and GPX in hepatopancreas and serum of the dsRNA-HO-1 group were significantly lower than those of the control group, and MDA content in the dsRNA-HO-1 group was the highest among the four groups. However, SFN treatment increased the activities of GPX and SOD in hepatopancreas, muscle, and serum and significantly reduced the content of MDA (p < 0.05). SFN activated HO-1, upregulated the expression of antioxidant-related genes (CAT, SOD, GST, GPX, Trx, HIF-1α, Nrf2, prx 2, Hsp 70), and autophagy genes (ATG 3, ATG 5), and stabilized the expression of apoptosis genes (caspase 2, caspase 3) in the hepatopancreas (p < 0.05). In addition, knocking down HO-1 aggravated the vacuolation of hepatopancreas and increased the apoptosis of hepatopancreas, while the supplement of SFN could repair the vacuolation of hepatopancreas and reduce the apoptosis signal. In summary, HO-1 is involved in the repair of the oxidative damage induced by OFO in L. vannamei by SFN.",

      "abstract": "Every year, thousands of children, particularly those under 5 years old, die because of cerebral malaria (CM). Following conventional treatment, approximately 25% of surviving individuals have lifelong severe neurocognitive sequelae. Therefore, improved conventional therapies or effective alternative therapies that prevent the severe infection are crucial. Omega-3 (Ω-3) polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are known to have antioxidative and anti-inflammatory effects and protect against diverse neurological disorders, including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. However, little is known regarding the effects of Ω-3 PUFAs against parasitic infections. In this study, C57BL/6 mice received supplemental treatment of a fish oil rich in the Ω-3 PUFA, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), which was started 15 days prior to infection with Plasmodium berghei ANKA and was maintained until the end of the study. Animals treated with the highest doses of DHA, 3.0 and 6.0 g/kg body weight, had 60 and 80% chance of survival, respectively, while all nontreated mice died by the 7th day postinfection due to CM. Furthermore, the parasite load during the critical period for CM development (5th to 11th day postinfection) was controlled in treated mice. However, after this period all animals developed high levels of parasitemia until the 20th day of infection. DHA treatment also effectively reduced blood-brain barrier (BBB) damage and brain edema and completely prevented brain hemorrhage and vascular occlusion. A strong anti-inflammatory profile was observed in the brains of DHA-treated mice, as well as, an increased number of neutrophil and reduced number of CD8+ T leukocytes in the spleen. Thus, this is the first study to demonstrate that the prophylactic use of DHA-rich fish oil exerts protective effects against experimental CM, reducing the mechanical and immunological events caused by the P. berghei ANKA infection.",

      "abstract": "The prevalence of depression is increasing, and geriatric depression, in particular, is difficult to recognize and treat. Depression in older adults is often accompanied by neuroinflammation in the central nervous system (CNS). Neuroinflammation affects the brain's physiological and immune functions through several pathways and induces depressive symptoms. This study investigated the relationship among depression, neuroinflammation, and fish oil supplementation. Thirty-six male Sprague-Dawley rats were used in an aging-related depression animal model to simulate geriatric depression. Cognitive function, depressive-like symptoms, peripheral nervous system and CNS inflammation status, and the tryptophan-related metabolic pathway were analyzed. The geriatric depression animal model was associated with depressive-like behaviors and cognitive impairment. The integrity of the blood-brain barrier was compromised, resulting in increased expression of ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 1 and the glial fibrillary acidic protein in the brain, indicating increased neuroinflammation. Tryptophan metabolism was also negatively affected. The geriatric-depressive-like rats had high levels of neurotoxic 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid and kynurenine in their hippocampus. Fish oil intake improved depressive-like symptoms and cognitive impairment, reduced proinflammatory cytokine expression, activated the brain's glial cells, and increased the interleukin-10 level in the prefrontal cortex. Thus, fish oil intervention could ameliorate abnormal neurobehaviors and neuroinflammation and elevate the serotonin level in the hippocampus.",

Twelve 3-month-old puppies were included, blocked by breed and randomly distributed into two groups: the Control Group (CG), without supplementation, and the Experimental Group (EG), supplemented with 40 mg DHA/kg BW/day. The object discrimination test was used, with a normal stage (NS) and a reverse stage (RS), and blood samples were collected to evaluate the serum polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) concentration and total antioxidant capacity (TAC) before (T0) and 30 (T1), 60 (T2) and 90 (T3) days after beginning the study. For the NS, there were effects of treatment (p = 0.0039) and time (p < 0.0001), in which the correct answer frequency in the EG was higher than the CG. The serum eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) + HA concentrations at T1, T2 and T3 were higher than at T0 for the EG (p = 0.0159), in addition, EG showed higher serum EPA + DHA concentrations than CG at T2 (p = 0.0245). The TAC values were similar between the groups (p = 0.3211). It was concluded that the cognitive function of puppies can be enhanced with DHA-concentrated fish oil supplementation without increasing the serum lipid oxidation."

METHODS: FA composition was determined using gas chromatography coupled to a flame ionization detector (GC-FID). Nine enteral nutrition formulas were evaluated and the results obtained were compared with those reported on the formulas labels. RESULTS: The sample with the highest percentage of added fish oil according to the label information had the lowest total amounts of eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid (EPA + DHA) (p < 0.05). In the evaluation of the total amount of polyunsaturated fatty acids/saturated fatty acids (ΣPUFA/ΣSFA) ratio, five samples were not within the values recommended by Brazilan and international health regulatory agencies. Regarding the n-6/n-3 fatty acids ratio, five samples showed values higher than the recommended ratio. It was observed that EPA + DHA content was positively correlated with the cost of the diet. Importantly, we also found that there was a significant difference between the results of our analysis and the descriptions found on the labels for fatty acids n-6, n-3, EPA, DHA, SFA, PUFA and MUFA. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the discrepancies for fatty acids between the values obtained in the analyses and the values reported on the labels highlight the need for more rigorous inspection when public hospitals purchase enteral nutrition formulas with added fish oil, since the administration of formulas with inadequate levels of FA in hospitalized patients can compromise clinical results during the hospitalization period.",

N-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFA) may modulate the concentration of microRNAs (miRNAs) and fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-21, which have been identified as non-invasive markers of liver fibrosis. The present study aims to evaluate whether n-3 PUFA supplementation can modulate miRNA-122 and FGF-21 and improve liver fibrosis and steatosis, measured by transient hepatic elastography (THE), in individuals with NAFLD. METHODS: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial will be conducted to evaluate the effect of 4 g/day supplementation of fish oil (2100 mg EPA and 924 mg DHA) in patients with NAFLD over a 6-month period. Fifty-two patients aged >19 years will be randomly assigned to either a placebo (olive oil) or treatment (fish oil) group. Anthropometric data, food intake, physical activity, body composition, resting energy expenditure (evaluated using indirect calorimetry), liver enzymes, platelets, lipids and glucose profile, inflammatory markers (such as C-reactive protein, neutrophil/lymphocyte, platelet/lymphocyte, and monocyte/lymphocyte ratios), miRNA-122 and FGF-21 concentration, and incorporation of fatty acids into the erythrocyte membrane (analyzed using gas chromatography) as well as the degree of liver fibrosis and steatosis assessed using THE (Fibroscan® Touch 502, Paris, France) and liver biomarkers Steato-Brazilian Longitudinal Study of Adult Health, Fatty Liver Index, NAFLD Fibrosis Score, Fibrosis-4 score, and FibroScan-AST score will be evaluated at the beginning and end of the treatment. Continuous variables with normal distribution will be compared between placebo and intervention groups using Student's T test for independent samples; continuous non-parametric variables will be compared using Dunn or Mann-Whitney test. Associations between categorical variables will be analyzed using the chi-square test, and within-group differences will be evaluated using the Wilcoxon signed-ranks test. The criterion for determining significance will be set at 5%. CONCLUSION: The present study protocol will investigate the supplementation of EPA-rich fish oil as an alternative treatment for NAFLD and its feasibility in affecting the concentration of miRNA-122 and FGF-21 markers. Its findings will offer valuable contributions to the literature. REGISTRATION: ReBEC number RBR-8dp876.",

      "abstract": "Hypercholesterolaemia is a major risk factor for CVD. Fish intake is associated with lower risk of CVD, whereas supplementation with n-3 long-chain PUFA (LC-PUFA) has little effect on the cholesterol concentration. We therefore investigated if cetoleic acid (CA), a long-chain MUFA (LC-MUFA) found especially in pelagic fish species, could lower the circulating total cholesterol (TC) concentration in rodents. A systematic literature search was performed using the databases PubMed, Web of Science and Embase, structured around the population (rodents), intervention (CA-rich fish oils or concentrates), comparator (diets not containing CA) and the primary outcome (circulating TC). Articles were assessed for risk of bias using the SYRCLE's tool. A meta-analysis was conducted in Review Manager v. 5.4.1 (the Cochrane Collaboration) to determine the effectiveness of consuming diets containing CA-rich fish oils or concentrates on the circulating TC concentration. Twelve articles were included in the systematic review and meta-analysis, with data from 288 rodents. Consumption of CA-rich fish oils and concentrates resulted in a significantly lower circulating TC concentration relative to comparator groups (mean difference -0·65 mmol/l, 95 % CI (-0·93, -0·37), P < 0·00001), with high statistical heterogeneity (I2 = 87 %). The risk of bias is unclear since few of the entries in the SYRCLE's tool were addressed. To conclude, intake of CA-rich fish oils and concentrates prevents high cholesterol concentration in rodents and should be further investigated as functional dietary ingredients or supplements to reduce the risk for developing CVD in humans.",

However, its protective ability against insulin resistance and pancreatic islet alteration remains unclear and controversial. AIM: To investigate the beneficial effects of fish oil consumption on the progression of insulin resistance and pancreatic islet dysfunction in a rat model of diabetes. METHODS: Diabetic rats model (n = 30) were divided into five groups and received; 1) NS injection + NS oral (normal control); 2) NS injection + 3 g/kg fish oil (fish oil control); 3) streptozotocin (STZ) injection + NS oral [diabetes control (DC)]; 4) STZ injection + 1 g/kg fish oil (DFO1); and 5) STZ injection + 3 g/kg fish oil (DFO3). Fasting blood insulin was analyzed by commercial rat insulin enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; meanwhile, the determination of insulin sensitivity was calculated by homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and homeostatic model assessment of beta-cell function. A histological study was conducted on pancreas tissue using H and E staining. RESULTS: Fish oil supplementation reduced hyperglycemia and ameliorated HOMA-IR in STZ-induced animal models indicating that fish oil supplementation improved insulin sensitivity. Furthermore, animals treated with fish oil at a dose of 3 g/kg (DFO3) showed an enhancement in pancreatic islets, which was displayed by less abnormal structures than DC animals. This could imply that the administration of fish oil, especially rich in bioactive omega-3 fatty acids effectively inhibits insulin resistance and restore islet of Langerhans alteration in rats injected with STZ. CONCLUSION: Thus, the current study suggested that fish oil supplementation could support the treatment of diabetes but should not be considered as an alternative therapy.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: We recently conducted a double-blinded randomised controlled trial showing that fish-oil supplementation during pregnancy reduced the risk of persistent wheeze or asthma in the child by 30%. Here, we explore the mechanisms of the intervention. METHODS: 736 pregnant women were given either placebo or n-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFAs) in the third trimester in a randomised controlled trial. Deep clinical follow-up of the 695 children in the trial was done at 12 visits until age 6 years, including assessment of genotype at the fatty acid desaturase (FADS) locus, plasma fatty acids, airway DNA methylation, gene expression, microbiome and metabolomics. RESULTS: Supplementation with n-3 LCPUFA reduced the overall risk of non-atopic asthma by 73% at age 6 (relative risk (RR) 0.27 (95% CI 0.06 to 0.85), p=0.042). In contrast, there was no overall effect on asthma with atopic traits (RR 1.42 (95% CI 0.63 to 3.38), p=0.40), but this was significantly modified by maternal FADS genotype and LCPUFA blood levels (interaction p<0.05), and supplementation did reduce the risk of atopic asthma in the subgroup of mothers with FADS risk variants and/or low blood levels of n-3 LCPUFA before the intervention (RR 0.31 (95% CI 0.11 to 0.75), p=0.016). Furthermore, n-3 LCPUFA significantly reduced the number of infections (croup, gastroenteritis, tonsillitis, otitis media and pneumonia) by 16% (incidence rate ratio 0.84 (95% CI 0.74 to 0.96), p=0.009). CONCLUSIONS: n-3 LCPUFA supplementation in pregnancy showed protective effects on non-atopic asthma and infections. Protective effects on atopic asthma depended on maternal FADS genotype and n-3 LCPUFA levels. This indicates that the fatty acid pathway is involved in multiple mechanisms affecting the risk of asthma subtypes and infections. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT00798226.",

      "abstract": "The implication of inflammation in the pathophysiology of several types of cancers has been under intense investigation. Conjugated fatty acids can modulate inflammation and present anticancer effects, promoting cancer cell death. In this paper, we evaluated the efficacy of new conjugated fatty acids isolated from marine Opisthopterus tardoore (Tapra fish) in human breast cancer cell lines MCF-7. Linoelaidic acid, a marine fish (O. tardoore) derived unsaturated fatty acids, showed effective anticancer activity against MCF-7. Cell viability (MTT) assay revealed a dose-dependent decline in cancer cell viability. It was noteworthy that 5 µM linoelaidic acid decreased the MCF-7 cell viability by 81.82%. Besides that, linoelaidic acid significantly (P< 0.05) increased the level of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra) studied by ELISA. Not only that, linoelaidic acid significantly decreased the reduced glutathione level and increased the oxidized glutathione level in MCF-7 cells indicating the oxidative stress inside the cell. Two different cell staining methods with acridine orange-ethidium bromide and DAPI confirmed that the linoelaidic acid rendered their detrimental effect on cancer cells. To decipher the mode of apoptosis Western blotting was performed in which the expression pattern of several proteins (p53, IL-10, and IL-1ra) established the apoptosis in the studied cell lines after linoelaidic acid exposure. Hence it may be conferred that linoelaidic acid has prompt anticancer activity. Therefore this drug can be used further for the treatment of cancer.",

Pregnant women with overweight/obesity were allocated into intervention groups with fish oil + placebo, probiotics + placebo, fish oil + probiotics or placebo + placebo in early pregnancy (fish oil: 1·9 g DHA and 0·22 g EPA, probiotics: Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus HN001 and Bifidobacterium animalis ssp. lactis 420, 1010 CFU, each daily). Blood samples were collected in early (n 431) and late pregnancy (n 361) for analysis of fatty acids in serum phosphatidylcholine (PC), cholesteryl esters (CE), TAG and NEFA with GC and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein and GlycA by immunoassay and NMR spectroscopy, respectively. GDM was diagnosed according to 2 h 75 g oral glucose tolerance test. EPA in PC, CE and TAG and DHA in PC, CE, TAG and NEFA were higher in fish oil and fish oil + probiotics groups compared with placebo. EPA in serum NEFA was lower in women receiving probiotics compared with women not receiving. Low-grade inflammation was inversely associated with n-3 LC-PUFA, which were related to an increased risk of GDM. Fish oil and fish oil + probiotics consumption increase serum n-3 LC-PUFA in pregnant women with overweight/obesity. Although these fatty acids were inversely related to inflammatory markers, n-3 LC-PUFA were linked with an increased risk for GDM.",

Omega-3 fatty acids, possessing anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, have shown potent neuroprotective effects in several diseases. The present study investigated whether omega-3 fatty acids could exert a neuroprotective role against POD in aged mice. A mouse model of POD was established to explore the role of omega-3 fatty acids in laparotomy-induced delirium-like behavior by evaluating systemic inflammatory changes, neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and behavior at different time points in aged mice. Oral gavage with omega-3 fatty acids (300 mg/kg) for 3 weeks before surgery significantly attenuated anesthesia/surgery-induced POD-like behavior and the accumulation of proinflammatory cytokines from the peripheral blood in aged mice. Moreover, it also remarkably mitigated neuroinflammation and the oxidative stress response (malondialdehyde [MDA] and superoxide dismutase [SOD]) in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus of surgical mice. Our findings provided evidence that pretreatment with omega-3 fatty acids may play a vital role in the treatment of POD through mechanisms involving its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects, which may be a promising prevention strategy for POD in aged patients.",

In Trial 1, four multiparous ruminally fistulated Holstein cows were randomly assigned to one of four dietary treatments sequences in a 4 × 4 Latin square design. Treatments consisted of (1) Control with no capsules, (2) Control plus 200 untreated capsules per cow/day, mixed with the TMR, (3) Control plus 200 treated capsules per cow/day placed directly into the rumen, (4) Control plus 200 treated capsules per cow/day, mixed with the TMR. In Trial 2, three fistulated Holstein and three fistulated Jersey multiparous cows were randomly assigned to three dietary treatments sequences in a replicated 3 × 3 Latin square design. Treatments consisted of (1) Control with no capsules fed to the cows, (2) Control plus 180 untreated capsules per cow/day, (3) Control plus 180 treated capsules per cow/day. Compared to control, feeding fish oil capsules significantly (Trial 1) or numerically (Trial 2) reduced milk fat concentration and yield. Furthermore, in both trials, the feeding of untreated or treated capsules had no effect on animal performance or milk composition. In both trials, compared to controls, supplementing the diet with fish oil capsules consistently increased total trans C18:1 isomers and DHA concentration in the rumen and milk fat. However, for both trials, capsule protection treatment had a minimal effect on the concentration of any of the reported rumen and milk fatty acids. When assessed under laboratory control conditions, due to water absorption, the treated capsule weight was increased by 40% while resistance to pressure decreased by 84% after 2 h of incubation in water. The results of this study suggest that due to a reduction in the capsule shell's resistance to abrasion, treated capsules marginally prevented the release of fish oil in the rumen."

But their effects remain controversial. We aimed to study the effects of fish oil and probiotics separately or in combination from early pregnancy onwards to lower the risk of allergic diseases in the infants. METHODS: In this double-blind trial, women (n = 439) in early pregnancies were randomized into four intervention groups: fish oil + placebo, probiotics + placebo, fish oil + probiotics, and placebo + placebo. Fish oil (1.9 g docosahexaenoic acid and 0.22 g eicosapentaenoic acid) and probiotic (Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus HN001 and Bifidobacterium animalis ssp. lactis 420, 1010 colony-forming units each) supplements were provided for daily consumption from randomization up to 6 months postpartum. All analyses were adjusted with pet ownership. RESULTS: No difference between the infants in the four intervention groups were found regarding physician-diagnosed food allergy, atopic eczema, or atopy at the age of 12 or 24 months (all p > .05). The probiotic intervention was associated with lower odds of recurrent wheezing at 24 months (OR 0.39, 95% CI 0.18-0.84, p = .017), but not at 12 months. CONCLUSIONS: The use of fish oil and/or probiotics from early pregnancy onwards did not lower the odds of childhood allergic diseases or atopy, with the exception of the probiotic intervention which decreased the risk of recurrent wheezing when the infants were two years old. This suggests that the incidence of asthma could also decrease later in childhood and thus these outcomes need to be clarified in further investigations.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Clinical trials suggest that long-chain omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs) (fish oil) may reduce depressive symptoms in adults with major depressive disorder. Therefore, n-3 PUFAs may be a potential treatment for depression in youth. METHODS: Participants were 15- to-25 year-old individuals with major depressive disorder who sought care in one of three government-funded mental health services for young people in metropolitan Melbourne, Perth, or Sydney, Australia. Participants were randomly assigned in a double-blind, parallel-arm design to receive either fish oil (840 mg of eicosapentaenoic acid and 560 mg of docosahexaenoic acid) or placebo capsules as adjunct to cognitive behavioral case management. All participants were offered 50-minute cognitive behavioral case management sessions every 2 weeks delivered by qualified therapists (treatment as usual) at the study sites during the intervention period. The primary outcome was change in the interviewer-rated Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology, Adolescent Version, score at 12 weeks. Erythrocyte n-3 PUFA levels were assessed pre-post intervention. RESULTS: A total of 233 young people were randomized to the treatment arms: 115 participants to the n-3 PUFA group and 118 to the placebo group. Mean change from baseline in the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology score was -5.8 in the n-3 PUFA group and -5.6 in the placebo group (mean difference, 0.2; 95% CI, -1.1 to 1.5; p = .75). Erythrocyte PUFA levels were not associated with depression severity at any time point. The incidence and severity of adverse events were similar in the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: This placebo-controlled trial and biomarker analysis found no evidence to support the use of fish oil for treatment in young people with major depressive disorder.",

Here, we evaluated how fish oil and/or probiotics supplementation modify concentrations of colostrum immune mediators and their associations with perinatal clinical factors on mothers with overweight/obesity. METHODS AND RESULTS: Pregnant women were randomized in a double-blind manner into four intervention groups, and the supplements were consumed daily from early pregnancy onwards. Colostrum samples were collected from 187 mothers, and 16 immune mediators were measured using bead-based immunoassays. Interventions modified colostrum composition; the fish oil+probiotics group had higher concentrations of IL-12p70 than probiotics+placebo and higher FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 ligand (FLT-3L) than fish oil+placebo and probiotics+placebo (one-way analysis of variance, post-hoc Tukey's test). Although the fish oil+probiotics group had higher levels of IFNα2 compared to the fish oil+placebo group, these differences were not statistically significant after correction for multiple testing. Multivariate linear model revealed significant associations between several immune mediators and the perinatal use of medication. CONCLUSION: Fish oil/probiotics intervention exerted a minor effect on concentrations of colostrum immune mediators. However, medication during the perinatal period modulated the immune mediators. These changes in colostrum's composition may contribute to immune system development in the infant.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: There is evidence that both omega-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) (eicosapentaenoic acid [EPA] and docosahexaenoic acid [DHA]) and cocoa flavanols can improve cognitive performance in both healthy individuals and in those with memory complaints. However, their combined effect is unknown. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the combined effect of EPA/DHA and cocoa flavanols (OM3FLAV) on cognitive performance and brain structures in older adults with memory complaints. METHODS: A randomized placebo-controlled trial of DHA-rich fish oil (providing 1.1 g/d DHA and 0.4 g/d EPA) and a flavanol-rich dark chocolate (providing 500 mg/d flavan-3-ols) was conducted in 259 older adults with either subjective cognitive impairment or mild cognitive impairment. Participants underwent assessment at baseline, 3 mo, and 12 mo. The primary outcome was the number of false-positives on a picture recognition task from the Cognitive Drug Research computerized assessment battery. Secondary outcomes included other cognition and mood outcomes, plasma lipids, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and glucose levels. A subset of 110 participants underwent structural neuroimaging at baseline and at 12 mo. RESULTS: 197 participants completed the study. The combined intervention had no significant effect on any cognitive outcomes, with the exception of reaction time variability (P = 0.007), alertness (P < 0.001), and executive function (P < 0.001), with a decline in function observed in the OM3FLAV group (118.6 [SD 25.3] at baseline versus 113.3 [SD 25.4] at 12 mo for executive function) relative to the control, and an associated decrease in cortical volume (P = 0.039). Compared with the control group, OM3FLAV increased plasma HDL, total cholesterol ratio (P < 0.001), and glucose (P = 0.008) and reduced TG concentrations (P < 0.001) by 3 mo, which were sustained to 12 mo, with no effect on BDNF. Changes in plasma EPA and DHA and urinary flavonoid metabolite concentrations confirmed compliance to the intervention. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that cosupplementation with ω-3 PUFAs and cocoa flavanols for 12 mo does not improve cognitive outcomes in those with cognitive impairment. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT02525198.",

We tested the hypothesis that early supplementation with fish oil and/or antioxidants in rats exposed to neonatal IH improves expression of lung biomarkers of alveolarization and microvascular maturation, and reduces IH-induced lung injury. STUDY DESIGN/METHODS: From birth (P0) to P14, rat pups were exposed to room air (RA) or neonatal IH during which they received daily oral supplementation with either: (1) olive oil (OO) (control); (2) Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) in OO; (3) fish oil; (4) glutathione nanoparticles (nGSH); or (5) fish oil +CoQ10. At P14 pups were placed in RA until P21 with no further treatment. RA controls were similarly treated. Lung growth and alveolarization, histopathology, apoptosis, oxidative stress and biomarkers of alveolarization and microvascular maturation were determined. RESULTS: Neonatal IH was associated with reduced lung weights and severe histopathological outcomes. These effects were curtailed with fish oil and nGSH. nGSH was also protective against apoptosis, while CoQ10 prevented IH-induced ROS production. Of all treatments, nGSH and CoQ10 + fish oil-induced vascular endothelial growth factor165 and CD31 (Platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1), which are associated with angiogenesis. CoQ10 + fish oil improved alveolarization in RA and IH despite evidence of hemorrhage. CONCLUSIONS: The benefits of nGSH and CoQ10 + fish oil suggest an antioxidant effect which may be required to curtail IH-induced lung injury. Further clinical assessment of the effectiveness of nGSH is warranted.",

      "abstract": "Aims: Studies demonstrated that oxidized fish oil (OFO) promoted oxidative stress and induced mitochondrial dysfunction and lipotoxicity, which attenuated beneficial effects of fish oil supplements in the treatment of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). The current study was performed on yellow catfish, a good model to study NAFLD, and its hepatocytes to explore whether selenium (Se) could alleviate OFO-induced lipotoxicity via the inhibition of oxidative stress and determine its potential mechanism. Results: The analysis of triglycerides content, oxidative stress parameters, and histological and transmission electronic microscopy observation showed that high dietary Se supplementation alleviated OFO-induced lipotoxicity, oxidative stress, and mitochondrial injury and dysfunction. RNA-sequencing and immunoblotting analysis indicated that high dietary Se reduced OFO-induced decline of peroxisome-proliferator-activated receptor alpha (Pparα) and ubiquitin-specific protease 4 (Usp4) protein expression. High Se supplementation also alleviated OFO-induced reduction of thioredoxin reductase 2 (txnrd2) messenger RNA (mRNA) expression level and activity. The txnrd2 knockdown experiments revealed that txnrd2 mediated Se- and oxidized eicosapentaenoic acid (oxEPA)-induced changes of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS) and further altered Usp4 mediated-deubiquitination and stabilization of Pparα, which, in turn, modulated mitochondrial fatty acid β-oxidation and metabolism. Mechanistically, Usp4 deubiquitinated Pparα and ubiquitin-proteasome-mediated Pparα degradation contributed to oxidative stress-induced mitochondrial dysfunction. Innovation: These findings uncovered a previously unknown mechanism by which Se and OFO interacted to affect lipid metabolism via the Txnrd2-mtROS-Usp4-Pparα pathway, which provides the new target for NAFLD prevention and treatment. Conclusion: Se ameliorated OFO-induced lipotoxicity via the inhibition of mitochondrial oxidative stress, remodeling of Usp4-mediated deubiquitination, and stabilization of Pparα. Antioxid.

Epidemiological studies report that one in five children have a mental disorder and about 50% of mental health problems exacerbate in childhood and adolescence. Moreover, the antidepressant efficacy in children and adolescents is poorly demonstrated and can cause severe behavioral adverse events such as suicidal ideation. (2) Methods: This systematic literature review examined oral supplementations (Omega-3, fish oil, Vitamin D3) to treat depressed children, preadolescents, and adolescents. MEDLINE, Scopus, Embase, and PsycInfo were searched for articles published in the last five years. Six studies met the eligibility criteria. The inclusion criteria encompassed children, preadolescents, and adolescents, a diagnosis of depression, and an intervention of oral supplementations such as Omega-3, fish oil, and Vitamin D3. (3) Results: Most of the studies demonstrated that dietary intervention provides positive outcomes in terms of depression symptoms. (4) Conclusions: Overall, the results demonstrate a positive effect for oral supplementation suggesting an increase intake of Omega-3, fish oil, and Vitamin D3. However, only a few studies assess the effectiveness of diet recommendations, as a monotherapy or combined treatment, for the management of depression at developmental ages. Thus, there is still a need to further investigate these aspects and to look more specifically at adolescents and preadolescents.",

      "abstract": "In some developing countries in Africa, Asia, and Latin America, rapid population growth is a complicated problem, and thus, it is necessary to raise the efficiency of foodstuff production to preserve human life. Therefore, this study was designed to investigate the effect of fish oil supplementation on male rabbits' productivity, as well as their biochemical and physiological characteristics. This experiment was conducted in the Animal House of the College of Veterinary Medicine, University of Baghdad (Baghdad, Iraq) for eight weeks. Twenty-four local male rabbits were randomly divided into three groups (each containing eight rabbits) as follows: the control group that was fed with a basal diet only, the first treated group in which each animal received fish oil orally at a dose of 0.75 ml every day, and another treated group in which each animal received fish oil orally at a dose of 1.5 ml every day. Both treated groups received the treatment for 60 days. Blood samples were collected from cardiac veins by cardiac puncture at the beginning of the experiment (Zero time). On day 60 of the experiment, samples were collected again to analyze potential changes in blood characteristics, including white blood cells count, hemoglobin, and red blood cells count. These blood samples recorded a significant decrease in cholesterol in the two treatment groups, compared to the control. In conclusion, the current findings recommend daily oral administration of fish oil at a dose of 0.75 mg/ml or 1.5 mg/ml to rabbits for 60 days before conception to improve performance trials, as well as biochemical and hematological results. These alterations, however, have a small impact on these features, compared to higher doses administered to rabbits.",

      "abstract": "Objectives: The aim of this study was to investigate whether a combination of nutrients designed to promote gut and brain health also lowers psychological distress. The hypothesis is that a probiotic with fish oil, and glutamine supplement will reduce psychological distress. Design: A multiple baseline design was used to collect data from seven naturopathic patients in private naturopathic clinics in Australia. Patients were between 18 and 65 years of age, and had a Kessler-10 (K10) score between 16 and 30 and symptoms associated with mild gastrointestinal discomfort experienced several times most weeks for 3 months. They were randomized into one of three pathways to stagger the introduction of the intervention. Interventions: Participants received either a supplement incorporating a probiotic formulation (including Lactobacillus rhamnosus), a glutamine powder formulation, and fish oil, or matched placebos. The primary outcome measure was psychological distress as measured by the K10 scale of psychological distress. Results: The data showed a general trend toward lower K10 scores during the active phase compared with the baseline phase, with a marked reduction in the variances between phases. After controlling for time and baseline values, no significant difference between the phases for the K10 and the Perceived Stress Scale was found, but there was still a significant reduction in symptoms on the Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale. Conclusions: A combination of a probiotic formulation, a glutamine powder formulation, and fish oil did not affect psychological distress and perceived stress, but had a significant beneficial effect on gastrointestinal symptoms in patients with high distress and concurrent gut symptomology.

      "abstract": "Breast cancer is the most common malignant tumor and one of the leading causes of cancer-related death in women throughout the world. This study is a parallel, randomized, double-blind, controlled, 12-week supplementation trial, investigating the anti-inflammatory effects of dietary intake of fish oil and evening primrose oil (EPO), in patients with breast cancer undergoing chemotherapy. The primary outcomes were changes in the nutritional status and inflammatory cytokines of patients during the study. The secondary outcomes were changes in hematological and biochemical parameters and fatty acid profile. Of the 32 eligible patients, half of them is randomly assigned to a treatment arm with fish oil and EPO (n = 16), or a control arm (n = 16) with mineral oil as a placebo. The intervention group was taking 2 gel capsules of fish oil and 3 gel capsules of EPO (400 mg eicosapentaenoic acid, 600 mg docosahexaenoic acid, and 351 mg gamma-linolenic acid) fish oil and evening primrose oil for 12 weeks, during their chemotherapy. The control/placebo group was taking 5 gel capsules of 1g of mineral oil. One of the patients dropped out due to discontinuation of the treatment (in the placebo group) and two did not show up at the post-treatment measurements (in the intervention group), thus, 29 women completed the study. The results showed an increase in plasma levels of docosapentaenoic acid (22:5n-3), docosahexaenoic acid (22:6n-3), total n-3PUFA, vaccenic acid (18:1n-7), and a decrease in n-6/n-3 PUFA ratio in the intervention group. An increase in the plasma level of dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid (20:3n-6) was observed in the placebo group. There was no difference in plasma levels of interleukin (IL) IL-8, IL-10, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha, while the level of IL-6 decreased in both groups and was significantly lower in the intervention group at the end of the study. In conclusion, this supplementation improved the PUFA status and decreased the level of IL-6 in breast cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy. Consequently, this treatment may help reduce cancer complications resulting from impaired lipid metabolism and inflammation. ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03516253.

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Nutritional support is potentially considered an essential step to prevent muscle loss and enhance physical function in older adults. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to assess the role of potential nutritional strategies, i.e., fish oil-derived ω-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), wheat oligopeptide and their combined intervention, in preventing and reversing sarcopenia in aging process. METHODS: One hundred 25-month-old Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into 10 groups, and 10 newly purchased 6-month-old rats were included in young control group (n = 10). Fish oil (200, 400 or 800 mg/kg body weight), wheat oligopeptide (100, 200 or 400 mg/kg body weight), fish oil + wheat oligopeptide (800 + 100, 400 + 200 or 200 + 400 mg/kg body weight) or the equal volume of solvent were administered daily by gavage for 10 weeks. The effects of these interventions on natural aging rats were evaluated. RESULTS: All intervention groups had a significant increase in muscle mass and grip strength and reduction in perirenal fat weight when compared to the aged control group (P < 0.05). The results of biochemical parameters, magnetic resonance imaging, proteomics and western blot suggested that the combination of wheat oligopeptide and fish oil-derived ω-3 PUFA, especially group WFM 2 (400 + 200 mg/kg body weight fish oil + wheat oligopeptide), was found to be more effective against aging-associated muscle loss than single intervention. Additionally, the interventions ameliorated fatty infiltration, muscle atrophy, and congestion in the intercellular matrix, and inflammatory cell infiltration in muscle tissue. The interventions also improved oxidative stress, anabolism, hormone levels, and inflammatory levels of skeletal muscle. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of fish oil-derived ω-3 PUFA and wheat oligopeptide was found to be a promising nutritional support to prevent and reverse sarcopenia. The potential mechanism involved the promotion of protein synthesis and muscle regeneration, as well as the enhancement of muscle strength.",

      "abstract": "Glaucoma is the leading cause of irreversible vision loss worldwide, and multiple risk factors influence its pathogenesis and progression, including age, increased intraocular pressure (IOP), low-grade inflammation, oxidative stress, and ocular blood flow deficits. IOP-lowering therapy is currently the most effective way to control glaucoma progression; however, due to insufficient response and persistent retinal neural degeneration, the result may not always be satisfactory. In recent decades, fish oil, an omega-3 dietary supplement, is reported to be beneficial to glaucoma patients, but its efficiency and underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Intriguingly, glaucoma patients have lower omega-3 fatty acid blood levels, especially docosahexaenoic acid and eicosapentaenoic acid. Dietary omega-3 supplementation in patients may normalize levels of fatty acid and, thereby, enhance their effects. Therefore, fish oil may serve as an area of new focus for glaucoma treatment studies. In this review, the study summarizes the roles of active ingredients in fish oil in delaying glaucoma development, including lowering IOP, regulating blood supply, alleviating inflammation, and diminishing oxidative stress, with a view to promoting the development of the clinical management of glaucoma.",

      "abstract": "In this study, we analyzed the eicosapentaenoic acid/docosahexaenoic acid (EPA/DHA) lipid composition of fish oil obtained through enzymatic treatment, fractional distillation and silica gel column purification, and further assessed EPA/DHA bioavailability. Lipid subclass composition information was obtained through ultra-performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-ESI-MS/MS), and bioavailability tests were performed using the Caco-2 cell monolayer model. Results showed that enzymatic treatment improved the incorporation of EPA/DHA as diacylglycerol (DG) while silica gel column chromatography enriched the content of EPA/DHA as phosphatidylglycerol (PG) (12.58%) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) (4.99%). Furthermore, increasing the purity of EPA/DHA could improve its bioavailability and after 24 incubation, binding forms of triglyceride (TG) was superior to ethyl ester (EE) (p < 0.05) at the same purity level. Those findings are helpful to provide research basis for exploring the bioactivity of fish oil."

      "abstract": "Extremely low gestational-age neonates requiring supplemental oxygen experience intermittent hypoxia (IH) episodes, which predispose them to oxidative stress and retinopathy of prematurity. We tested the hypothesis that early supplementation with fish oil or CoQ10 confers benefits reducing the severity of IH-induced retinopathy. At birth, rat pups were exposed to two clinically relevant neonatal IH paradigms with recovery in either hyperoxia (50% O2) or room air (RA) between episodes for 14 days, during which they received daily oral fish oil, coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) in olive oil (OO), or OO only (vehicle). At postnatal day 14 (P14), pups were allowed to recover in RA with no further treatment until P21. Retinas were examined at P14 and at P21. Both IH paradigms resulted in severe ocular oxidative stress and retinopathy regardless of recovery in hyperoxia or RA in the vehicle groups. Although early supplementation with fish oil was beneficial, CoQ10 provided superior benefits for reducing IH-induced oxidative stress and retinopathy. These effects were associated with lower retinal antioxidants and biomarkers of angiogenesis. The therapeutic benefits of CoQ10 suggest a potential treatment for IH-induced retinopathies. Further studies are needed to establish appropriate, safe, and effective doses for use in preterm infants."
