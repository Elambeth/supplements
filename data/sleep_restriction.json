      "abstract": "Chronic sleep restriction (SR) impairs the glymphatic clearance of macromolecular toxic metabolites, which is associated with the loss of perivascular polarization of aquaporin-4 (AQP4). Melatonin (Mel) has been shown to maintain the circadian rhythm of AQP4 polarization. However, the role of AQP4 polarization in Mel's protective effects against SR-induced brain dysfunction remains unclear. In the present study, using a modified rotating rod SR mouse model, we demonstrated the time-dependent effect of SR on short-term memory deficits and AQP4 mislocalization in the hippocampus. Subsequent experiments characterized the dose-dependent pattern of Mel ameliorating SR-induced impairments of cognitive function and AQP4 polarity. Mel's treatment enhanced glymphatic transport in SR mice, as revealed by cerebrospinal tracer experiments, and reduced hippocampal amyloid-beta and phosphorylated tau levels. Additionally, Mel significantly decreased glial cell activation, pro-inflammatory cytokine production, and synaptic protein loss in the hippocampus of SR mice. However, in AQP4 knockout mice, Mel's protective effects against SR-induced pathophysiological alterations described above were largely abolished. Mechanistically, Mel activated the vitamin D receptor and then upregulated expression of DTNA (Dystrobrevin Alpha), a key component of the dystrophin-associated complex, which in turn restored AQP4 polarization during chronic SR conditions. This finding indicates that AQP4-mediated lymphatic clearance is necessary for Mel to combat chronic SR-induced brain impairment."

      "abstract": "STUDY OBJECTIVES: Insomnia disorder, affecting 10% of the population, poses a significant public health concern and is a risk-factor for many health issues. Cognitive behavioral therapy is first-choice treatment, but the key component - sleep restriction therapy - presents with side effects and adherence challenges. Sleep compression therapy, suggested as a potentially gentler alternative, has never been directly compared to sleep restriction therapy. METHODS: Single-blind trial at the Internet psychiatry clinic in Stockholm, Sweden. Patients with insomnia disorder randomized 1:1 to evaluate non-inferiority of sleep compression therapy to sleep restriction therapy in improving insomnia, and to compare important clinical aspects. Primary outcome: self-reported Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), assessed pre-treatment, week 1-5, and week ten. Non-inferiority analysis based on intent-to-treat analyses with multiple imputation and mixed effects models. RESULTS: Adults with insomnia (n=234; mean age 44.3 (SD 13.7) years, 173 (73.4%) female) received treatment as a ten-week highly structured, therapist-guided online program, to strengthen experimental integrity and treatment fidelity. Both treatments improved insomnia severity with large effects. Sleep compression therapy failed to show non-inferiority with a conservative limit of 1.6 ISI-points (CI-95% -0.01 - 1.70), gave statistically significantly smaller improvements (p = .006) and was associated with slower improvements despite better adherence and somewhat less side effects. CONCLUSIONS: This direct comparison and well-controlled trial provide empirically based support for clinicians to prioritize sleep restriction therapy over sleep compression therapy, while the latter can be a valid alternative when sleep restriction therapy cannot be used."

      "abstract": "Inadequate sleep during pregnancy can have profound effects on offspring neurodevelopment, particularly on learning and memory abilities. This study explored whether prenatal sleep restriction (SR) induces learning and memory impairment in offspring by affecting neural plasticity in the hippocampus using four groups of pregnant mice: short-sleep-restriction (S-SR, 4 h), mid-sleep-restriction (M-SR, 10 h), long-sleep-restriction (L-SR, 18 h), and a control group without SR. SR was implemented from gestation day 8 until delivery. Changes in adult offspring and fetal hippocampal synapse structures were observed and synapse-synthesis-related protein (BDNF and Syt7) levels were measured to establish changes indicative of neurodevelopmental impairment. Offspring learning and memory abilities were further evaluated using Morris water maze test, passive avoidance test, and open field test from postnatal day 35. The findings revealed significant declines in spatial learning and memory across all SR groups. Additionally, adult offspring exhibited reduced hippocampal synapse numbers, thinner postsynaptic densities in S-SR and M-SR groups, and widened synaptic clefts in the L-SR group. Synapse-synthesis-related proteins, including brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and synaptotagmin-7 (Syt7), showed decreased expression in the hippocampus of offspring mice in all SR groups, with BDNF expression also reduced in fetal hippocampi. Moreover, BDNF methylation levels indicated significant decreases in BDNF_3 and increases in BDNF_5 specifically in the S-SR group. Notably, prenatal S-SR induced more pronounced impairments in offspring learning and memory compared to L-SR. These findings underscore how prenatal SR disrupts fetal neurodevelopment, emphasizing hippocampal synaptic plasticity as a critical mechanism contributing to impaired cognitive function in offspring. This can help with risk identification and early intervention."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Insomnia is common, but access to its first-line treatment, cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I), is limited. To explore a scalable alternative, we investigated the efficacy of sleep restriction therapy (SRT), a core component of CBT-I, delivered via telephone. METHODS: In a randomized controlled trial, 147 adults with insomnia were allocated to 6 weeks of telephone-guided SRT (n = 76) or a sleep diary control group (n = 71). The SRT group received weekly supporting phone calls lasting 10-15 min. At baseline and posttest, we measured insomnia severity (primary outcome), sleep diary measures, anxiety symptoms, depressive symptoms, presleep arousal, sleep-safety behaviors, daytime sleepiness, and dysfunctional sleep-related cognitions (secondary outcomes). The SRT group repeated these measures at 3- and 6-month follow-ups. RESULTS: Telephone-guided SRT showed large between-group effects on insomnia severity at posttest relative to the sleep diary control group (d = 1.52; p < 0.001). Based on intention-to-treat, 36 (47%) participants randomized to SRT achieved clinical improvement, and 23 (30%) achieved insomnia remission. We found medium-to-large between-group effects at posttest (d = 0.53-1.18) for all secondary outcomes except daytime sleepiness and total sleep time. At 3- and 6-month follow-ups, the primary and all secondary outcomes, including daytime sleepiness and total sleep time, improved relative to baseline within the SRT group (d = 0.50-1.93). CONCLUSION: This trial shows that telephone-guided SRT is an effective insomnia treatment requiring minimal therapist guidance. If direct comparisons with CBT-I corroborate these findings, SRT could be an interesting scalable alternative to CBT-I as a first-line insomnia treatment. TRIAL REGISTRY: NCT05548907."

      "abstract": "Sleep is crucial for maintaining homeostasis and is conserved across the animal kingdom. Sleep restriction has emerged as a significant health concern, particularly in adolescents and adults. In infants and children, it is linked to disrupted brain development, impaired social-emotional growth, deficits in executive function, and increased anxiety and depression. However, the precise biological mechanisms remain unclear. This study aimed to investigate the effects of sleep restriction on parvalbumin (PV)-expressing inhibitory interneurons, which mature postnatally, and to clarify some of the developmental consequences of sleep restriction on brain function. Three hours of sleep restriction was induced daily from postnatal day (P) 10 until P14, P21, and P28. Behavioural abnormalities were assessed on P21, followed by brain histology and behavioural recovery analysis after sleep restoration. Our results showed that sleep restriction did not alter the development of PV-positive neurons in the somatosensory cortex or amygdala but significantly reduced PV-positive neurons in the prefrontal cortex. Moreover, sleep-restricted mice exhibited increased anxiety-like behaviour at P21. Upon sleep restoration, adult mice showed reduced activity in the open field test, indicating a persistent effect of early-life sleep restriction. These findings suggest that sleep restriction during postnatal development selectively affects certain brain regions, with potential long-lasting consequences. Early intervention to mitigate sleep restriction's impact on brain development may be crucial for reducing neurodevelopmental deficits.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Sleep deprivation significantly impairs cognitive function, which disrupts daily life. However, sex differences in these impairments are not well understood, as most preclinical studies primarily use male animals, neglecting potential differences between sexes. This study aims to investigate sex-specific differences in cognitive function under sleep deprivation using reward-based operant conditioning tasks. RESULTS: Sprague-Dawley rats were pre-trained on a lever-press task and subsequently divided into control and chronic sleep restriction (CSR) groups. The CSR group underwent 14 days of sleep restriction. After CSR modeling, rats were assessed using the open field test, retraining on the lever-pressing task, signal discrimination task, and extinction task to evaluate motor abilities, memory formation, learning, and cognitive flexibility. CSR significantly impaired task performance in both sexes, with rats requiring more time and exhibiting lower accuracy. In the signal discrimination task, male rats showed longer feeding latency and lower accuracy compared to females. CSR also specifically increased the frequency of operant responses in male rats. In the extinction task, CSR enhanced exploration time and frequency in both sexes, with females exhibiting significantly higher exploration frequencies than males. Biochemically, CSR induced sex-specific alterations, including elevated serum MDA and MAO levels in males and increased serotonin, dopamine, and epinephrine in both sexes. Although activation was observed in metabolites of the tryptophan-kynurenine pathway, sex differences were evident in the kynurenic acid metabolism levels in the prefrontal cortex. CONCLUSIONS: CSR impairs cognitive function in both male and female rats, with significant sex differences observed. Male CSR rats exhibited impaired signal discrimination, while CSR impaired extinction learning in female rats. These impairments are accompanied by CSR-induced oxidative stress, neurotransmitter dysregulation, and disturbances in the tryptophan metabolic pathway. These findings underscore the importance of considering sex differences in understanding the effects of sleep deprivation on cognitive function and developing targeted intervention strategies.",

      "abstract": "Sleep Restriction Therapy (SRT) is a core component of cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia (CBT-I). Yet, adherence to SRT can be a major challenge for patients. As this challenge is evident in conventional face-to-face therapy, it raises the question of adherence to SRT in internet-delivered therapy. This qualitative study investigates adherence to SRT in internet-delivered CBT-I and aims to identify candidate variables that can guide treatment decisions. Participants diagnosed with insomnia who participated in an internet-delivered CBT-I as part of a stepped-care model were interviewed. Data from interviews with 23 participants were included in this study. A qualitative content analysis was employed. Hindering and facilitating individual, intervention-related, and e-coaching-related factors were examined. Moreover, the consequences of SRT (e.g., negative effects and attrition) were examined. Eleven participants consistently implemented SRT, two rejected it from the beginning, eight discontinued, and two showed inconsistent adherence. Docility, low levels of frustration tolerance, and previous negative experiences with SRT emerged as hindering individual factors. In contrast, a high level of insomnia-related burden, social support, perceived individual fit with the program, and being satisfied with the therapeutic guidance appeared to foster adherence. Based on the results of this study, a treatment path model is introduced, postulating candidate predictors for the indication for SRT within internet-delivered CBT-I (e.g., docility and previous negative experiences with SRT), candidate predictors for engagement (e.g., level of commitment and social support), and potential variables for process monitoring (e.g., negative effects and satisfaction with and need for therapeutic guidance)."

A comprehensive review of case studies, observational studies, randomized controlled trials, systematic reviews, and meta-analyses was conducted using PubMed, Cochrane Library, and Google Scholar up to July 2024. Sleep plays a crucial role in the overall well-being and performance of athletes, yet sleep issues are highly prevalent due to factors such as competition schedules, psychological stress, and travel across time zones. Inadequate sleep negatively affects physical strength, endurance, cognitive function, and injury risk. Sleep tracking is highlighted as both a diagnostic and therapeutic tool, with interventions such as extending sleep duration, adopting sleep hygiene practices, and, when necessary, pharmacological approaches proving effective. The review concludes that tailored sleep strategies are essential to optimize athletic performance, recovery, and overall well-being."

      "abstract": "Sleep insufficiency is a significant health problem worldwide and can induce multiple neurodevelopmental disorders in the central nervous system (CNS). Sleep deprivation (SD), especially chronic SD, leads to cognition and memory loss and worsens neurodegenerative disease liability. Microglia are the main inflammation-dominant glia and play a crucial role in SD-induced neurological impairments. Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) is a redox reaction coenzyme that exerts anti-inflammatory and mitochondria-protective effects in microglia. Whether NAD+ mitigated SD-induced neurological disorders by regulating microglial functions is still unknown. In the current study, we designed an in vivo and in vitro model to evaluate the neuroprotective effect of NAD+ on chronic sleep restriction (CSR) and further investigate the underlying mechanisms. Behavioral tests and immunofluorescence staining were applied to investigate the cognition impairments and microglial activation. Biochemical experiments were tested to analyze the oxidative status and possible mechanism. In vitro data were used to verify the in vivo data. Our results displayed that NAD+ supplement mitigated CSR-induced cognitive decline and microglial activation response by suppressing the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines in vivo. NAD+ administration also decreased oxidative stress and mitochondrial impairments in microglia. In vitro results showed that NAD+ treatment inhibited ROS production and prompted M1 conversion to M2 phenotype. cGAS-STING/NF-κB pathways were significantly activated but down-regulated by NAD+ administration. H151, a STING antagonist, was applied to validate that NAD+ treatment alleviates neuroinflammation partially by regulating cGAS-STING pathways in microglia. Our findings suggest that NAD+ supplement is a promising therapy for sleep disorders-induced neurological problems, and cGAS-STING pathway may act as a critical regulator in microglial proinflammation.",

We investigated whether 6 wk of mild sleep restriction (SR) alters levels of free thyroxine (FT4), thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), and fibroblast growth factor-21 (FGF-21), a modulator of FT4, in adults with adequate habitual sleep (AS; 7-9 h/night). METHODS: Healthy adults participated in one of two randomized, crossover studies with identical 6-wk intervention phases: AS and SR (1.5 h/night < AS). Fasted blood samples were collected at baseline and endpoint of each phase. Outcomes were concentrations of FT4, TSH, and FGF-21 (women only). Linear mixed models tested the effects of SR vs AS on the outcomes, adjusting for baseline levels, week, sex, and sex-by-condition interaction. RESULTS: Thirty participants (20 women; 73% racial/ethnic minority; age 21-64 y [M±SD = 36.2 ± 12.8 y]) were included. In the full sample, no effects of SR on FT4 (β±SE = 0.02 ± 0.04, p = 0.654) or TSH (β±SE = -0.02 ± 0.04, p = 0.650) were observed; however, there were sex-by-condition interactions for both FT4 (p-interaction = 0.056) and TSH (p-interaction = 0.049). In sex-stratified analyses, TSH was reduced in SR vs. AS in women (β±SE = -0.11 ± 0.04, p = 0.011, Cohen's f2 = 0.55) but not men (β±SE = 0.09 ± 0.08, p = 0.261). Among women (n = 17), FGF-21 was not significantly different between conditions (β±SE = 8.51 ± 17.70, p = 0.638). CONCLUSION: Prolonged mild SR reduces TSH in women, whereas FT4 and FGF-21 remain unaffected compared with AS. If sustained, disruptions to the thyrotropic axis in women may contribute to their more pronounced cardiometabolic risk in response to SR compared with men.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Insomnia is a prevalent and distressing sleep disorder. Multicomponent cognitive-behavioural therapy is the recommended first-line treatment, but access remains extremely limited, particularly in primary care where insomnia is managed. One principal component of cognitive-behavioural therapy is a behavioural treatment called sleep restriction therapy, which could potentially be delivered as a brief single-component intervention by generalists in primary care. OBJECTIVES: The primary objective of the Health-professional Administered Brief Insomnia Therapy trial was to establish whether nurse-delivered sleep restriction therapy in primary care improves insomnia relative to sleep hygiene. Secondary objectives were to establish whether nurse-delivered sleep restriction therapy was cost-effective, and to undertake a process evaluation to understand intervention delivery, fidelity and acceptability. DESIGN: Pragmatic, multicentre, individually randomised, parallel-group, superiority trial with embedded process evaluation. SETTING: National Health Service general practice in three regions of England. PARTICIPANTS: Adults aged ≥ 18 years with insomnia disorder were randomised using a validated web-based randomisation programme. INTERVENTIONS: Participants in the intervention group were offered a brief four-session nurse-delivered behavioural treatment involving two in-person sessions and two by phone. Participants were supported to follow a prescribed sleep schedule with the aim of restricting and standardising time in bed. Participants were also provided with a sleep hygiene leaflet. The control group received the same sleep hygiene leaflet by e-mail or post. There was no restriction on usual care. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Outcomes were assessed at 3, 6 and 12 months. Participants were included in the primary analysis if they contributed at least one post-randomisation outcome. The primary end point was self-reported insomnia severity with the Insomnia Severity Index at 6 months. Secondary outcomes were health-related and sleep-related quality of life, depressive symptoms, work productivity and activity impairment, self-reported and actigraphy-defined sleep, and hypnotic medication use. Cost-effectiveness was evaluated using the incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year. For the process evaluation, semistructured interviews were carried out with participants, nurses and practice managers or general practitioners. Due to the nature of the intervention, both participants and nurses were aware of group allocation. RESULTS: We recruited 642 participants (n = 321 for sleep restriction therapy; n = 321 for sleep hygiene) between 29 August 2018 and 23 March 2020. Five hundred and eighty participants (90.3%) provided data at a minimum of one follow-up time point; 257 (80.1%) participants in the sleep restriction therapy arm and 291 (90.7%) participants in the sleep hygiene arm provided primary outcome data at 6 months. The estimated adjusted mean difference on the Insomnia Severity Index was -3.05 (95% confidence interval -3.83 to -2.28; p < 0.001, Cohen's d = -0.74), indicating that participants in the sleep restriction therapy arm [mean (standard deviation) Insomnia Severity Index = 10.9 (5.5)] reported lower insomnia severity compared to sleep hygiene [mean (standard deviation) Insomnia Severity Index = 13.9 (5.2)]. Large treatment effects were also found at 3 (d = -0.95) and 12 months (d = -0.72). Superiority of sleep restriction therapy over sleep hygiene was evident at 3, 6 and 12 months for self-reported sleep, mental health-related quality of life, depressive symptoms, work productivity impairment and sleep-related quality of life. Eight participants in each group experienced serious adverse events but none were judged to be related to the intervention. The incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year gained was £2075.71, giving a 95.3% probability that the intervention is cost-effective at a cost-effectiveness threshold of £20,000. The process evaluation found that sleep restriction therapy was acceptable to both nurses and patients, and delivered with high fidelity. LIMITATIONS: While we recruited a clinical sample, 97% were of white ethnic background and 50% had a university degree, which may limit generalisability to the insomnia population in England. CONCLUSIONS: Brief nurse-delivered sleep restriction therapy in primary care is clinically effective for insomnia disorder, safe, and likely to be cost-effective. FUTURE WORK: Future work should examine the place of sleep restriction therapy in the insomnia treatment pathway, assess generalisability across diverse primary care patients with insomnia, and consider additional methods to enhance patient engagement with treatment.

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Insomnia is a prevalent sleep disorder that negatively impacts daytime functioning and quality of life. Breast cancer patients report higher rates of insomnia and more circadian disruption than other cancer groups. Approximately 50% of patients experience acute insomnia following breast cancer diagnosis, which often persists during cancer treatment and rehabilitation. Sleep Restriction Therapy (SRT) is a clinically effective and tolerable treatment for persistent insomnia in breast cancer survivors. However, SRT has never been tested on patients with early signs of sleep disturbance who are undergoing cancer treatment. The aim of this pilot randomised controlled trial is to explore the feasibility and preliminary effectiveness of nurse delivered SRT for newly diagnosed breast cancer patients with acute insomnia. The trial has been registered on ClinicalTrials.gov (identifier: NCT06294041). METHODS: The INVEST (INvestigating the Value of Early Sleep Therapy) trial will recruit 50 newly diagnosed breast cancer patients who meet criteria for acute insomnia. Patients will be recruited from breast cancer results clinics within two Scottish health boards (NHS Grampian and NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde) and will be block randomised (1:1) to receive nurse delivered SRT or Sleep Hygiene Education (SHE). SRT will be delivered over 4 weekly sessions comprising two face-to-face meetings (either in person or online) and two telephone calls, whereas SHE will be administered in booklet form. Outcomes will be collected at baseline, 6 weeks, and 12 weeks post-randomisation. Primary outcomes in this trial relate to the feasibility of SRT for newly diagnosed breast cancer patients with acute insomnia. Specifically, we will explore (i) rates of patient recruitment and retention, (ii) intervention fidelity, (iii) data collection procedures and outcome measure completion, (iv) intervention acceptability. Secondary outcomes will focus on preliminary evaluation of patient responses to SRT, including insomnia severity, rest-activity rhythms, and mental health. DISSEMINATION: Our dissemination plan comprises publishing trial outcomes in high-impact, peer-reviewed journals and on breast cancer charity websites and other patient resources. The outcomes from this pilot trial will also inform the development of a full-scale, multicentre RCT of SRT for acute insomnia in newly diagnosed breast cancer patients. University of Strathclyde is the sponsor (reference: UEC23/52). Protocol version v1.2 4 October 2023. STRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS OF THIS STUDY: This trial is the first to explore the value of sleep prehabilitation for newly diagnosed breast cancer patients.This will be the first trial to assess the feasibility of delivering SRT during breast cancer treatment, providing valuable insight into its tolerability and preliminary effectiveness.An embedded process evaluation will assess the acceptability of SRT, providing insight into potential optimisation of the intervention and recommendations for enhancing its future scalability and translation within cancer care.Due to the nature of the SRT intervention, nurse therapists and patients cannot be blinded to treatment allocation, increasing the risk of bias.",

      "abstract": "Sleep insufficiency is a significant health problem worldwide, and adolescent sleep restriction (SR) could induce multiple neurodevelopmental disorders in the central nervous system (CNS). Microglial-mediated neuroinflammation plays a vital role in multiple neurological diseases, and recent research showed the regulation effect of immunoproteasome on microglia functions. Geraniol (GER), an important ingredient in many essential oils, possesses diverse pharmacological properties like anti-inflammatory and antioxidant. The present study was designed to evaluate the neuroprotective effect of GER on SR in adolescent mice and further investigate the underlying mechanisms. Our results displayed that 14 days of chronic sleep restriction (CSR) induced cognitive decline, and anxiety-like and attention-deficit behaviors, which were mitigated by GER pretreatment. GER administration also reversed microglial pro-inflammatory response under CSR stimulation in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) regions by reducing the expression and secretion of cytokines like IL-1β and TNF-α. Mechanism research showed that LMP7 mRNA was selectively up-regulated under CSR treatment but down-regulated by GER administration. Proteasome activity and protein expression of LMP7 were consistent with mRNA data. ONX-0914 was applied to inhibit LMP7 selectively, and data validated that GER might alleviate CSR-induced neuroinflammation by regulating LMP7. Our study provides evidence that LMP7 is a critical regulator of CSR-induced proinflammation, and geraniol might be a promising therapy against CSR-induced neurodevelopmental disorders.",

      "abstract": "Habitual short sleep durations are associated with several cardiovascular diseases. Experimental research generally supports these findings as metrics of arterial function are impaired after complete deprivation of sleep and after longer periods of partial sleep restriction. The acute influence of a single instance of partial sleep restriction (PSR), however, has not been defined. We evaluated arterial structure and function among 32 university-aged participants on two occasions: once after normal habitual sleep (NS), and again the morning after an acute partial sleep restriction (PSR) intervention involving only 3 h of sleep for a single night. Endothelial function was measured using ultrasonography at the brachial artery via flow-mediated dilatation (FMD), and a ramp peak oxygen uptake test was used to evaluate cardiorespiratory fitness. Blood samples were collected from a subset of participants to investigate the influence of circulatory factors on cellular mechanisms implicated in endothelial function. Sleep duration was lower after a night of PSR compared to NS (P < 0.001); however, there were no appreciable differences in any haemodynamic outcome between conditions. FMD was not different between NS and PSR (NS: 6.5 ± 2.9%; PSR: 6.3 ± 2.9%; P = 0.668), and cardiorespiratory fitness did not moderate the haemodynamic response to PSR (all P > 0.05). Ex vivo cell culture results aligned with in vivo data, showing that acute PSR does not alter intracellular processes involved in endothelial function. No differences in arterial structure or function were observed between NS and acute PSR in healthy and young participants, and cardiorespiratory fitness does not modulate the arterial response to acute sleep restriction.",

As the population of people with IR increases and sleep restriction (SR) due to staying up late becomes the \"new normal\", it is necessary to investigate the effects and molecular pathogenesis of chronic SR on cognitive function in insulin resistance. In this study, 4-week-old mice were fed a high-fat diet (HFD) for 8 weeks to establish IR model, and then the mice were subjected to SR for 21 days, and related indicators were assessed, including cognitive capacity, apoptosis, oxidative stress, glial cell activation, inflammation, blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability and adiponectin levels, for exploring the potential regulatory mechanisms. Compared with control group, IR mice showed impaired cognitive capacity, meanwhile, SR not only promoted Bax/Bcl2-induced hippocampal neuronal cell apoptosis and Nrf2/HO1- induced oxidative stress, but also increased microglia activation and inflammatory factor levels and BBB permeability, thus aggravating the cognitive impairment in IR mice. Consequently, changing bad living habits and ensuring sufficient sleep are important intervention strategies to moderate the aggravation of IR-induced cognitive impairment.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUNDS: Sleep restriction is considered a stressful condition itself, causing a wide variety of physiological alterations, from cognitive and hormonal to immunological status. In addition, it is established that stress in mother rats can modify milk ejection, milk composition, and maternal care of the pups. Also, sleep disturbances during the early stages of motherhood are a common feature of all studied species. In this context, while the impacts of sleep disruption in non-lactating animals were extensively investigated, its repercussions during the initial phases of motherhood have been poorly explored. Therefore, we wonder if maternal behavior, milk ejection and its macronutrient composition would be disrupted when mother rats are subjected to an additional acute or chronic sleep restriction to the already existing sleep disturbances. METHODS: Lactating rats were implanted with unilateral electrodes for polysomnographic recordings and for deep brain electrical stimulation into mesopontine waking-promoting area (for sleep deprivation). During the early postpartum period (postpartum day 5-9), mother rats were randomly assigned into one of three groups: chronic sleep restriction group (CSR; 6 h of sleep deprivation/day for five consecutive days), acute sleep restriction group (ASR; 6 h of sleep deprivation only for one day), or undisturbed group (control group). Active maternal behaviors (retrievals of the pups into the nest, mouthing, lickings [corporal and anogenital] and sniffing the pups) and passive maternal behaviors (kyphotic and supine nursing postures) were evaluated during a 30 min period without sleep restriction immediately after the sleep restriction or control period. The litter weight gain was assessed every day, and on the last experimental session mothers were milked for posterior macronutrients analysis (protein, carbohydrates and fat). RESULTS: When compared to control group, CSR decreased the amount of milk ejected in the middle days of the sleep restriction period, while ASR did not affect this parameter. Moreover, ASR reduced milk protein content compared to control and CSR groups. Finally, compared to the control group, CSR reduced active maternal behaviors towards the end of the treatment days. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated that not only acute but also chronic sleep restriction impacts on the postpartum period, each one affecting different aspects of maternal behavior and lactation. Our results suggest the existence of a homeostatic recovery mechanism in breastfeeding during CSR, possibly ensuring the survival of the litter, while the decline in active maternal behaviors appears to be cumulative.",

This review aimed to synthesise and evaluate the impact of single-component sleep restriction therapy on depressive symptoms relative to a control intervention. We searched electronic databases and sleep-related journals for randomised controlled trials and uncontrolled clinical trials, published from 1 January 1986 until 19 August 2023, that delivered sleep restriction therapy to adults with insomnia. Random-effects meta-analysis of standardised mean differences and Cochrane risk of bias assessment were performed on randomised controlled trials, while uncontrolled clinical trials were discussed narratively. The meta-analysis was pre-registered on PROSPERO (ID: CRD42020191803). We identified seven randomised controlled trials (N = 1102) and two uncontrolled clinical trials (N = 22). Findings suggest that sleep restriction therapy is associated with a medium effect for improvement in depressive symptoms at post-treatment (Nc = 6, g = -0.45 [95% confidence interval = -0.70 to -0.21], p < 0.001) and a small effect at follow-up (Nc = 4, g = -0.31 [95% confidence interval = -0.45 to -0.16], p < 0.001). Five of the seven included randomised controlled trials were judged to have a high risk of bias. Standalone sleep restriction therapy appears to be efficacious for improving depressive symptoms at post-treatment and follow-up. However, conclusions are tentative due to the small number of trials and because none of the trials was performed in a population with clinically defined depression. Large-scale trials are needed to test the effect of sleep restriction therapy in patients experiencing depression and insomnia. Findings also highlight the need to improve the standardisation and reporting of sleep restriction therapy procedures, and to design studies with more rigorous control arms to reduce potential bias.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE/BACKGROUND: Experimental studies suggest that sleep loss affects psychological outcomes. However, most studies focus on acute severe in-laboratory sleep restriction, with limited ecological validity. This study examines the impact of sustained mild sleep restriction (SR) on stress and distress among healthy adults in a naturalistic home environment. PATIENTS/METHODS: We analyzed data from two randomized crossover studies. Individuals who regularly slept 7-9 h/night completed two 6-wk intervention phases separated by a 6-wk washout: habitual sleep (HS: maintenance of habitual bed and wake times) and SR (delayed bedtime by 1.5 h/night and maintenance of habitual wake time). Adherence to sleep duration requirements was verified with wrist actigraphy and daily sleep diaries during each intervention phase. Measures of perceived stress, subjective anxiety, subjective depression, rumination, and cortisol were collected at baseline and endpoint of each intervention phase. RESULTS: Sixty-two participants (age 36.4 ± 14.0 y, 85.5 % women, 63.3 % racial/ethnic minority) were included in our analyses. Mean total sleep time was 7.4 ± 0.4 h/night during HS and 6.2 ± 0.4 h/night during SR (p < 0.001). Higher perceived stress (3.6 ± 1.0, p = 0.0007) and subjective anxiety (1.1 ± 0.5, p = 0.039) were observed after SR compared to HS. No effect of sleep condition was observed on subjective depression, rumination, and cortisol. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that prolonged mildly insufficient sleep, similar to what commonly experienced in the real world, can lead to increased perceived stress and subjective anxiety in healthy adults. Addressing sleep loss, even if mild, should be a key component of interventions aimed at promoting mental health in the general population.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Considerable researches have directed toward metabolic disorders caused by sleep restriction (SR). SR-induced disruption of circadian metabolic rhythmicity is identified as an important pathophysiological mechanism. The flavonoid pterostilbene (PTE) is abundant in the traditional Chinese medicine dragon's blood with protective efficacy against obesity-related metabolic dysfunctions. Our previous study found that PTE ameliorates exercise intolerance and clock gene oscillation in the skeletal muscles subjected to SR. PURPOSE: This study aimed to explore whether PTE improves SR-induced metabolic disorders and delineate the relationship between PTE and the circadian clock. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Two hundred male C57/B6J mice were kept awake for 20 h/d over five consecutive days and concurrently gavaged with 50, 100, or 200 mg/kg·bw/d PTE. Food consumption and body weight were monitored, and the metabolic status of the mice was evaluated by performing OGTT and ITT, measuring the serum lipid profiles and liver histopathology in response to SR. Daily behavior was analyzed by Clocklab™. The circadian rhythms of the liver clock genes and metabolic output genes were evaluated by cosine analysis. Binding between PTE and RORα/γ or NR1D1/2 was investigated by molecular docking. A luciferase reporter assay was used to determine the impact of PTE on Bmal1 transcription in SR-exposed mice co-transfected with Ad-BMAL1-LUC plus Ad-RORγ-mCherry or Ad-NR1D1-EGFP. RESULTS: PTE significantly ameliorated abnormal glucose and lipid metabolism (p < 0.05) in SR-exposed mice. PTE improved circadian behavior (p < 0.05) and rescued the circadian rhythm oscillation of the liver clock (p < 0.05) and metabolic output genes (p < 0.05) under SR condition. Molecular docking disclosed that PTE might interact with RORs, and PTE was found to increase Bmal1 promoter luciferase activity with RORE elements in the presence of Ad-RORγ-mCherry (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: PTE may protect against SR-induced metabolic disorders by directly modulating RORγ to maintain circadian metabolic rhythm. The findings provide valuable insights into the potential use of PTE in the treatment of metabolic disorders associated with disruptions in the circadian rhythm.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Sleep restriction therapy (SRT) is a behavioural therapy for insomnia. AIM: To conduct a process evaluation of a randomised controlled trial comparing SRT delivered by primary care nurses plus a sleep hygiene booklet with the sleep hygiene booklet only for adults with insomnia disorder. DESIGN AND SETTING: A mixed-methods process evaluation in a general practice setting. METHOD: Semi-structured interviews were conducted in a purposive sample of patients receiving SRT, the practice nurses who delivered the therapy, and also GPs or practice managers at the participating practices. Qualitative data were explored using framework analysis, and integrated with nurse comments and quantitative data, including baseline Insomnia Severity Index score and serial sleep efficiency outcomes to investigate the relationships between these. RESULTS: In total, 16 patients, 13 nurses, six practice managers, and one GP were interviewed. Patients had no previous experience of behavioural therapy, needed flexible appointment times, and preferred face-to-face consultations; nurses felt prepared to deliver SRT, accommodating patient concerns, tailoring therapy, and negotiating sleep timings despite treatment complexity and delays between training and intervention delivery. How the intervention produced change was explored, including patient and nurse interactions and patient responses to SRT. Difficulties maintaining SRT, negative attitudes towards treatment, and low self-efficacy were highlighted. Contextual factors, including freeing GP time, time constraints, and conflicting priorities for nurses, with suggestions for alternative delivery options, were raised. Participants who found SRT a positive process showed improvements in sleep efficiency, whereas those who struggled did not. CONCLUSION: SRT was successfully delivered by practice nurses and was generally well received by patients, despite some difficulties delivering and applying the intervention in practice.",

      "abstract": "Chronic sleep restriction, common in today's 24/7 society, causes cumulative neurobehavioural impairment, but the dynamics of the build-up and dissipation of this impairment have not been fully elucidated. We addressed this knowledge gap in a laboratory study involving two, 5-day periods of sleep restriction to 4 hr per day, separated by a 1-day dose-response intervention sleep opportunity. We measured sleep physiological and waking neurobehavioural responses in 70 healthy adults, each randomized to one of seven dose-response intervention sleep doses ranging from 0 to 12 hr, or a non-sleep-restricted control group. As anticipated, sleep physiological markers showed homeostatic dynamics throughout the study, and waking neurobehavioural impairment accumulated across the two sleep restriction periods. Unexpectedly, there was only a slight and short-lived effect of the 1-day dose-response intervention sleep opportunity. Whether the dose-response intervention sleep opportunity involved extension, further restriction or total deprivation of sleep, neurobehavioural functioning during the subsequent second sleep restriction period was dominated by prior sleep-wake history. Our findings revealed a profound and enduring influence of long-term sleep-wake history as a fundamental aspect of the dynamic regulation of the neurobehavioural response to sleep loss.",

In this study, we tested the hypothesis that sleep restriction during abstinence from oxycodone self-administration would increase drug seeking during extinction and footshock reinstatement tests. We also performed behavioral phenotyping to determine if individual variation in responses to stressors and/or pain are associated with oxycodone seeking during abstinence, as stress, pain and sleep disturbance are often co-occurring phenomena. Sleep restriction during abstinence did not have selective effects on oxycodone seeking for either sex in extinction and footshock reinstatement tests. Some phenotypes were associated with drug seeking; these associations differed by sex and type of drug seeking assessment. In female rats, pain-related phenotypes were related to high levels of drug seeking during the initial extinction session. In male rats, lower anxiety-like behavior in the open field was associated with greater drug seeking, although this effect was lost when correcting for oxycodone intake. Adrenal sensitivity prior to oxycodone exposure was positively associated with footshock reinstatement in females. This work identifies sex-dependent relationships between HPA axis function and opioid seeking, indicating that HPA axis function could be a therapeutic target for the treatment of opioid use disorder, with tailored approaches based on sex. Sleep disturbance during abstinence did not appear to be a major contributing factor to opioid seeking.",

      "abstract": "Rapid eye movement sleep fragmentation is hypothesised to be a reliable feature of insomnia, which may contribute to emotion dysregulation. Sleep restriction therapy, an effective intervention for insomnia, has the potential to reduce rapid eye movement sleep fragmentation through its manipulation of basic sleep-wake processes. We performed secondary data analysis of a randomised controlled trial to examine whether sleep restriction therapy reduces rapid eye movement sleep fragmentation in comparison to a matched control arm. Participants (n = 56; 39 female, mean age = 40.78 ± 9.08 years) were randomly allocated to 4 weeks of sleep restriction therapy or 4 weeks of time in bed regularisation. Ambulatory polysomnographic recordings were performed at baseline, week 1 and week 4. Arousals during rapid eye movement and non-rapid eye movement sleep were scored blind to group allocation. The following rapid eye movement sleep fragmentation index was the primary outcome: index 1 = (rapid eye movement arousals + rapid eye movement awakenings + non-rapid eye movement intrusions)/rapid eye movement duration in hours. Secondary outcomes were two further indices of rapid eye movement sleep fragmentation: index 2 = (rapid eye movement arousals + rapid eye movement awakenings)/rapid eye movement duration in hours; and index 3 = rapid eye movement arousals/rapid eye movement duration in hours. A non-rapid eye movement fragmentation index was also calculated (non-rapid eye movement arousals/non-rapid eye movement duration in hours). Linear-mixed models were fitted to assess between-group differences. There was no significant group difference for the primary rapid eye movement fragmentation index at week 1 (p = 0.097, d = -0.31) or week 4 (p = 0.741, d = -0.06). There was some indication that secondary indices of rapid eye movement fragmentation decreased more in the sleep restriction therapy group relative to control at week 1 (index 2: p = 0.023, d = -0.46; index 3: p = 0.051, d = -0.39), but not at week 4 (d ≤ 0.13). No group effects were found for arousals during non-rapid eye movement sleep. We did not find clear evidence that sleep restriction therapy modifies rapid eye movement sleep fragmentation. Small-to-medium effect sizes in the hypothesised direction, across several indices of rapid eye movement fragmentation during early treatment, demand further investigation in future studies.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Insomnia is prevalent and distressing but access to the first-line treatment, cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), is extremely limited. We aimed to assess the clinical and cost-effectiveness of sleep restriction therapy, a key component of CBT, which has the potential to be widely implemented. METHODS: We did a pragmatic, superiority, open-label, randomised controlled trial of sleep restriction therapy versus sleep hygiene. Adults with insomnia disorder were recruited from 35 general practices across England and randomly assigned (1:1) using a web-based randomisation programme to either four sessions of nurse-delivered sleep restriction therapy plus a sleep hygiene booklet or a sleep hygiene booklet only. There was no restriction on usual care for either group. Outcomes were assessed at 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months. The primary endpoint was self-reported insomnia severity at 6 months measured with the insomnia severity index (ISI). The primary analysis included participants according to their allocated group and who contributed at least one outcome measurement. Cost-effectiveness was evaluated from the UK National Health Service and personal social services perspective and expressed in terms of incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. The trial was prospectively registered (ISRCTN42499563). FINDINGS: Between Aug 29, 2018, and March 23, 2020 we randomly assigned 642 participants to sleep restriction therapy (n=321) or sleep hygiene (n=321). Mean age was 55·4 years (range 19-88), with 489 (76·2%) participants being female and 153 (23·8%) being male. 580 (90·3%) participants provided data for at least one outcome measurement. At 6 months, mean ISI score was 10·9 (SD 5·5) for sleep restriction therapy and 13·9 (5·2) for sleep hygiene (adjusted mean difference -3·05, 95% CI -3·83 to -2·28; p<0·0001; Cohen's d -0·74), indicating that participants in the sleep restriction therapy group reported lower insomnia severity than the sleep hygiene group. The incremental cost per QALY gained was £2076, giving a 95·3% probability that treatment was cost-effective at a cost-effectiveness threshold of £20 000. Eight participants in each group had serious adverse events, none of which were judged to be related to intervention. INTERPRETATION: Brief nurse-delivered sleep restriction therapy in primary care reduces insomnia symptoms, is likely to be cost-effective, and has the potential to be widely implemented as a first-line treatment for insomnia disorder.

      "abstract": "Mood state and alertness are negatively affected by sleep loss, and can be positively influenced by exercise. However, the potential mitigating effects of exercise on sleep-loss-induced changes in mood state and alertness have not been studied comprehensively. Twenty-four healthy young males were matched into one of three, 5-night sleep interventions: normal sleep (NS; total sleep time (TST) per night = 449 ± 22 min), sleep restriction (SR; TST = 230 ± 5 min), or sleep restriction and exercise (SR + EX; TST = 235 ± 5 min, plus three sessions of high-intensity interval exercise (HIIE)). Mood state was assessed using the profile of mood states (POMS) and a daily well-being questionnaire. Alertness was assessed using psychomotor vigilance testing (PVT). Following the intervention, POMS total mood disturbance scores significantly increased for both the SR and SR + EX groups, and were greater than the NS group (SR vs NS; 31.0 ± 10.7 A.U., [4.4-57.7 A.U.], p = 0.020; SR + EX vs NS; 38.6 ± 14.9 A.U., [11.1-66.1 A.U.], p = 0.004). The PVT reaction times increased in the SR (p = 0.049) and SR + EX groups (p = 0.033) and the daily well-being questionnaire revealed increased levels of fatigue in both groups (SR; p = 0.041, SR + EX; p = 0.026) during the intervention. Despite previously demonstrated physiological benefits of performing three sessions of HIIE during five nights of sleep restriction, the detriments to mood, wellness, and alertness were not mitigated by exercise in this study. Whether alternatively timed exercise sessions or other exercise protocols could promote more positive outcomes on these factors during sleep restriction requires further research.",

      "abstract": "Sleep restriction, a key element of cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia, involves considerable behavioural changes in patients' lives, leading to side-effects like increased daytime sleepiness. Studies on sleep restriction rarely report adherence, and when assessed it is often limited to the average number of therapy sessions attended. This study aims to systematically evaluate different measures of adherence to cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia and their relationship with treatment outcome. This is a secondary analysis of data from a randomized controlled trial investigating cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia (Johann et al. (2020) Journal of Sleep Research, 29, e13102). The sample included 23 patients diagnosed with insomnia according to DSM-5 criteria who underwent 8 weeks of cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia. The following adherence measures based on sleep diary data were used: number of sessions completed; deviations from agreed time in bed; average percentage of patients deviating from bedtime by 15, 30 or 60 min; variability of bedtime and wake-up time; change in time in bed from pre- to post-assessment. Treatment outcome was assessed using the Insomnia Severity Index. Multiple regression models were employed, and insomnia severity was controlled for. Results showed that none of the adherence measures predict insomnia severity. Baseline insomnia severity, dysfunctional thoughts and attitudes about sleep, depression or perfectionism did not predict adherence. The limited variance in the outcome parameter due to most patients benefiting from treatment and the small sample size may explain these findings. Additionally, using objective measures like actigraphy could provide a better understanding of adherence behaviour. Lastly, the presence of perfectionism in patients with insomnia may have mitigated adherence problems in this study.",

Twenty male subjects (40.6 ± 7.5 years old) underwent overnight polysomnography during 2 weeks, each week containing one undisturbed baseline night, one intervention night (either sleep restriction with 5 h of sleep or sleep fragmentation with awakening every hour) and two undisturbed recovery nights. Parameters of heart rate variability (HRV) were used to assess cardiac autonomic modulation during the nights. Sleep restriction showed significant higher heart rate (p = 0.018) and lower HRV-pNN50 (p = 0.012) during sleep stage N1 and lower HRV-SDNN (p = 0.009) during wakefulness compared to the respective baseline. For HR and SDNN there were recovery effects. There was no significant difference comparing fragmentation night and its baseline. Comparing both intervention nights, sleep restriction had lower HRV high frequency (HF) components in stage N1 (p = 0.018) and stage N2 (p = 0.012), lower HRV low frequency (LF) (p = 0.007) regarding the entire night and lower SDNN (p = 0.033) during WASO during sleep. Sleep restriction increases sympathetic tone and decreases vagal tone during night causing increased autonomic stress, while fragmented sleep does not affect cardiac autonomic parameters in our sample.",

      "abstract": "Insufficient sleep affects cognitive function, but the underlying mechanism and potential protective ways are yet to be fully understood. This study aimed to explore the influence of chronic sleep restriction (CSR) on the insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) signaling pathway, and whether down-regulating IGF-1 signaling pathway would modulate amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides metabolism and its cortical deposition after CSR. Methods 8-week IGF-1R+/- mice and wild-type (WT) C57BL/6 (C57) mice were divided into four groups: IGF-1R+/- CSR (MUSR), IGF-1R+/- control (MUCO), C57 CSR (C57SR) and C57 control (C57CO). CSR model was established by application of slowly rotating drum for 2 months. Body weight and Lee's index were measured. The level of IGF-1 in plasma was measured by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Aβ accumulation was detected by immunofluorescence. The expressions of amyloid precursor protein (APP), β-site amyloid precursor protein-cleaving enzyme-1 (BACE-1) and C99 were detected using western-blot (WB). Results Two-way ANOVA showed genotypic effect was significant on body weight and Lee's index. Neither treatment effect nor interaction reached significant difference on body weight and Lee's index. The level of IGF-1 in plasma was significantly decreased in C57SR compared with C57CO. Besides, compared with C57CO, Aβ was markedly accumulated in frontal cortex, in parallel with increased expressions of BACE-1 and C99, and with no difference of APP in C57SR group. Further, no significant changes of Aβ, BACE-1, C99 and APP were detected in MUSR compared with MUCO. Conclusions This study showed that CSR could induce the decrease of circulating IGF-1 in mice. By using the IGF-1R+/- mice, we found that down-regulating IGF-1R could reduce Aβ deposition in mice frontal cortex after CSR via inhibiting BACE-1 protein expression and activity, which were independent of the changes of body weight and Lee's index. These findings indicate that the blockage of IGF-1 signaling pathway might be a protection mechanism for alleviating the impact of CSR.",

      "abstract": "Sleep restriction therapy is a central component of cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia, but can lead to excessive sleepiness, which may impede treatment adherence. Sleep compression therapy has been suggested as a possibly gentler alternative. The aim of this study was to compare the effects of sleep restriction therapy and sleep compression therapy on objective measures of sleep, with a focus on magnitude and timing of effects. From a larger study of participants with insomnia, a sub-sample of 36 underwent polysomnographic recordings, before being randomised to either sleep restriction (n = 19) or sleep compression (n = 17) and receiving online treatment for 10 weeks. Assessments with polysomnography were also carried out after 2, 5, and 10 weeks of treatment. Data were analysed with multilevel linear mixed effect modelling. As per treatment instructions, participants in sleep restriction initially spent shorter time in bed compared with sleep compression. Participants in sleep restriction also showed an initial decrease of total sleep time, which was not seen in the sleep compression group. Both treatments led to improvements in sleep continuity variables, with a tendency for the improvements to come earlier during treatment in sleep restriction. No substantial differences were found between the two treatments 10 weeks after the treatment start. The results indicate that homeostatic sleep pressure may not be as important as a mechanism in sleep compression therapy as in sleep restriction therapy, and an investigation of other mechanisms is needed. In conclusion, the treatments led to similar changes in objective sleep at a somewhat different pace, and possibly through different mechanisms.",

This study investigated the effects of short-term sleep restriction followed by a recovery phase on subjective health status, inflammation, and lipid metabolism in different types of CH. A total of 118 healthy adults aged 35 to 44 years without sleep disturbances were enrolled. Participants underwent 4-hour sleep restrictions per day for 3 days at a hospital and then returned to their daily lives for 4 days of rest. CH was assessed using a structured questionnaire with eight characteristic symptoms. A questionnaire and blood tests were administered baseline, after sleep restriction, and follow-up to assess cortisol, lipid profiles, and self-reported stress and quality of life (QOL). Participants were divided into CH (44.1%) and non-CH (55.9%) groups. The CH group showed increased stress, impaired QOL, and decreased low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) levels compared to the non-CH group after sleep restriction. The variance for QOL (effect size = 0.07), subjective stress (effect size = 0.053), and LDL-C (effect size = 0.029) among time points depended on the group. Short-term sleep restriction was associated with deterioration of subjective health and reduced lipid metabolism; such changes were more evident in the CH group.

      "abstract": "Sleep restriction therapy (SRT) is an effective stand-alone behavioural intervention for insomnia disorder. However, its daytime side effects, particularly sleepiness, may be troubling for patients and/or may be a necessary part of the patient's treatment journey. This pilot trial aims to explore the potential benefit of armodafinil, a wakefulness promoter. Patients were treated with SRT with open label adjunctive armodafinil (150 mg/day). Thirty-three patients from previous studies that have undergone exactly the same SRT intervention acted as controls. The primary outcome measure was the insomnia severity index (ISI), and secondary outcomes were the Epworth sleepiness scale, sleep restriction adherence scale (SRAS), and safety from baseline through to 12 weeks. We recruited 25 patients into the trial. Data for the primary end point (ISI at 12 weeks) was available for 20 of the participants. The baseline insomnia severity index was 20.2 (SD 3.3) and decreased to 9.1 (SE 1.1), with no change, to 10.2 and 11.2 at weeks 6 and 12 respectively (all p > 0.05 compared with baseline). The insomnia severity index values for armodafinil patients were statistically inferior to historical controls at the primary time point of 12 weeks (11.2 vs. 6.7, p < 0.01). Sleep restriction therapy plus armodafinil treatment was associated with frequent minor side effects but was generally safe and acceptable to patients. Sleep restriction therapy was associated with a robust clinical response in the insomnia severity index values for insomnia patients. Based upon historical control data, armodafinil does not appear to have beneficial adjunctive effects in addition to sleep restriction therapy alone.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Inadequate sleep is associated with many detrimental health effects, including increased risk of developing insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. These effects have been associated with changes to the skeletal muscle transcriptome, although this has not been characterised in response to a period of sleep restriction. Exercise induces a beneficial transcriptional response within skeletal muscle that may counteract some of the negative effects associated with sleep restriction. We hypothesised that sleep restriction would down-regulate transcriptional pathways associated with glucose metabolism, but that performing exercise would mitigate these effects. METHODS: 20 healthy young males were allocated to one of three experimental groups: a Normal Sleep (NS) group (8 h time in bed per night (TIB), for five nights (11 pm - 7 am)), a Sleep Restriction (SR) group (4 h TIB, for five nights (3 am - 7 am)), and a Sleep Restriction and Exercise group (SR+EX) (4 h TIB, for five nights (3 am - 7 am) and three high-intensity interval exercise (HIIE) sessions (performed at 10 am)). RNA sequencing was performed on muscle samples collected pre- and post-intervention. Our data was then compared to skeletal muscle transcriptomic data previously reported following sleep deprivation (24 h without sleep). RESULTS: Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) indicated there was an increased enrichment of inflammatory and immune response related pathways in the SR group post-intervention. However, in the SR+EX group the direction of enrichment in these same pathways occurred in the opposite directions. Despite this, there were no significant changes at the individual gene level from pre- to post-intervention. A set of genes previously shown to be decreased with sleep deprivation was also decreased in the SR group, but increased in the SR+EX group. CONCLUSION: The alterations to inflammatory and immune related pathways in skeletal muscle, following five nights of sleep restriction, provide insight regarding the transcriptional changes that underpin the detrimental effects associated with sleep loss. Performing three sessions of HIIE during sleep restriction attenuated some of these transcriptional changes. Overall, the transcriptional alterations observed with a moderate period of sleep restriction were less evident than previously reported changes following a period of sleep deprivation.",

Circadian processes control sleep, but little is known about how sleep affects the circadian system. Therefore, we performed a 28-day sleep restriction (SR) treatment in mice. Sleep restriction disrupted the clock genes' circadian rhythm. The circadian rhythms of the Cry1 and Per1/2/3 genes disappeared. The acrophase of the clock genes (Bmal1, Clock, Rev-erbα, and Rorβ) that still had a circadian rhythm was advanced, while the acrophase of negative clock gene Cry2 was delayed. Clock genes' upstream signals ERK and EIFs also had circadian rhythm disorders. Accompanied by changes in the central oscillator, the plasma output signal (melatonin, corticosterone, IL-6, and TNF-α) had an advanced acrophase. While the melatonin mesor was decreased, the corticosterone, IL-6, and TNF-α mesor was increased. Our results indicated that chronic sleep loss could disrupt the circadian rhythm of the central clock through ERK and EIFs and affect the output signal downstream of the core biological clock."

      "abstract": "Sleep restriction therapies likely drive improvement in insomnia in middle childhood via increases in homeostatic sleep pressure (e.g., evening sleepiness). Increased evening sleepiness may also dampen comorbid anxiety symptoms; and reduced wakefulness in bed may reduce worry. However, sleep restriction therapies have never been evaluated as a standalone intervention in this population. The mechanism of action needs testing, as do effects on anxiety, and cognitive performance and parasomnias (possible contraindications). This randomised controlled trial evaluated the efficacy of two \"doses\" of sleep restriction therapy (sleep restriction therapy, bedtime restriction therapy), compared to a control condition (time in bed regularisation). A total of 61 children (mean [SD, range] age 9.1 [2.1, 6-14] years; 54% female) with chronic insomnia disorder received two weekly 60-min treatment sessions with a psychologist. Sleep, sleepiness, anxiety, worry, cognitive performance, and parasomnias were measured pre-treatment, across treatment, and at 4-weeks post-treatment. Both the sleep and bedtime restriction groups experienced reductions in total sleep time (d = 1.38-2.27) and increases in evening sleepiness (d = 1.01-1.47) during the 2-week treatment, and improvements in insomnia (i.e., sleep onset latency; d = 1.10-1.21), relative to the control group. All groups reported improved anxiety and worry, yet there were no differences between the control and restriction groups (all p > 0.658). Time in bed increased at the 1-month follow-up, and benefits to sleep and insomnia were maintained. There were no adverse effects on cognitive functioning (all p > 0.259), nor parasomnia occurrence (all p > 0.740). These results suggest that sleep restriction therapies are brief, yet effective, standalone interventions for insomnia in middle childhood, and improvements are likely due to increased sleepiness, not sleep regularisation.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Physiologic and psychologic stress slow healing from experimental wounds by impairing immune function. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to determine whether supplemental protein and multinutrient supplementation improved wound healing markers after acute stress induced by acute sleep restriction. METHODS: In this single-blind, crossover study in generally healthy young adults (18 males/2 females; mean ± SD age: 19.7 ± 2.30 y), experimental wounds were created by removing the top layer of forearm blisters induced via suction after 48 h of 72-h sleep restriction (2-h nightly sleep), a protocol previously shown to delay wound healing. Skin barrier restoration (measured by transepidermal water loss) assessed wound healing ≤10 d postblistering, and local immune responses were evaluated by serial measurement of cytokine concentrations in fluid collected at wound sites for 48 h postblistering. Participants consumed controlled, isocaloric diets with either 0.900 g · kg-1 · d-1 protein plus placebo (PLA) or 1.50 g · kg-1 · d-1 protein plus multinutrient beverage [l-arginine: 20.0 g/d; l-glutamine: 30.0 g/d; omega-3 (n-3) fatty acids: 1.00 g/d; zinc sulfate: 24.0 mg/d; cholecalciferol: 800 IU/d; and vitamin C: 400 mg/d] (NUT) during sleep restriction and for 4 d afterwards. RESULTS: Skin barrier restoration (primary outcome) was shorter for NUT (median: 3.98 d; IQR: 1.17 d) than for PLA (median: 5.25 d; IQR: 1.05 d) (P = 0.001). Cytokines from wound fluid (secondary outcome) increased over time (main effect of time P ≤ 0.001), except IL-13 (P = 0.07); however, no effects of treatment were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Supplemental nutrition may promote wound healing after sleep restriction in healthy adults including military personnel, the latter of which also have a high incidence of wounds and infection.This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT03525184.",

      "abstract": "Chronic sleep restriction (CSR) has been associated with adverse effects including cognitive impairment and increased risk of diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Yet, sleep restriction therapy is an essential component of most behavioral treatments for insomnia. Moreover, little is known about the impact of CSR on sleep continuity and structure in healthy people whose need for sleep is satiated. We investigated the impact of CSR on sleep continuity and structure in nine healthy participants. They had 4 nights of sleep extension, 2 nights of post-extension sleep, 21 nights of CSR (5/5.6-hour time-in-bed), and 9 nights of recovery sleep. Compared to postextension sleep, during CSR sleep duration was reduced by 95.4 ± 21.2 min per night, Slow-Wave Activity was significantly increased, and sleep was more consolidated. During recovery, sleep duration was increased by 103.3 ± 23.8 min compared to CSR, and the CSR-induced increase in Slow-Wave Activity persisted, particularly after the 5-hour exposure. Yet, we found that sustained vigilant attention was not fully recovered even after nine nights of recovery sleep. Our results suggest that CSR improves traditional metrics of sleep quality and may have a persistent impact on sleep depth, which is consistent with the reported benefits on sleep continuity and structure of sleep restriction therapy. However, these improvements in traditional metrics of sleep quality were associated with deterioration rather than improvement in neurobehavioral performance, demonstrating that sleep duration should be included in assessments of sleep quality. These results have implications for the long-term use of sleep restriction in the behavioral treatment of insomnia.

      "abstract": "STUDY OBJECTIVES: Sleep restriction therapy (SRT) effectively treats insomnia but mechanisms are poorly understood. Theoretical models suggest that potentiation of sleep pressure and reduction of arousal are key mechanisms of action. To our knowledge, this has never been directly tested. We designed a randomized controlled trial with embedded mechanistic measurement to investigate if SRT causally modifies multidimensional assessments of sleep pressure and arousal. METHODS: Participants aged 25-55 who met DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for insomnia disorder were randomized to four weeks of SRT or time in bed regularization (TBR), a control intervention that involves prescription of a regular but not reduced time in bed. Sleep pressure was assessed through daily diary appraisal of morning and evening sleepiness, weekly Epworth sleepiness scale (ESS) scores, psychomotor vigilance, and non-rapid eye movement (NREM) delta power (0.75-4.5 Hz) from ambulatory polysomnographic recordings. Arousal was assessed through daily diary appraisal of cognitive arousal, the pre-sleep arousal scale (PSAS), and NREM beta power (15-32 Hz). Outcomes were assessed at baseline (2-week period prior to randomization), during the intervention phase (1-4 weeks post-randomization), and at 12-week follow-up. We performed intention-to-treat analyses using linear mixed models. For continuous daily measures, the treatment period was split into early (weeks 1-2) and late (weeks 3-4) treatment. RESULTS: Fifty-six participants (39 females, mean age = 40.78 ± 9.08) were assigned to SRT (n = 27) or TBR (n = 29). The SRT group showed enhanced sleep pressure relative to TBR, reflected in (1) enhanced sleepiness in the evening during early (d = 1.17) and late treatment (d = 0.92), and in the morning during early treatment (d = 0.47); (2) higher daytime sleepiness on the ESS at weeks-1 and -2 (d = 0.54, d = 0.45); and (3) reduced psychomotor vigilance at week-1 (d = 0.34). The SRT group also showed reduced arousal relative to TBR, reflected in lower levels of daily-monitored cognitive arousal during early treatment (d = 0.53) and decreased PSAS total score at week-4 and week-12 (ds ≥ 0.39). Power spectral analysis of all night NREM sleep revealed an increase in relative, but not absolute, EEG delta power at week-1 and week-4 (ds ≥ 0.52) and a decrease of relative EEG beta power at week-4 (d = 0.11). CONCLUSION: For the first time, we show that SRT increases sleep pressure and decreases arousal during acute implementation, providing support for mechanism-of-action.",

      "abstract": "CONTEXT: Sleep loss in men increases cortisol and decreases testosterone, and sleep restriction by 3 to 4 hours/night induces insulin resistance. OBJECTIVE: We clamped cortisol and testosterone and determined the effect on insulin resistance. METHODS: This was a randomized double-blind, in-laboratory crossover study in which 34 healthy young men underwent 4 nights of sleep restriction of 4 hours/night under 2 treatment conditions in random order: dual hormone clamp (cortisol and testosterone fixed), or matching placebo (cortisol and testosterone not fixed). Fasting blood samples, and an additional 23 samples for a 3-hour oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), were collected before and after sleep restriction under both treatment conditions. Cytokines and hormones were measured from the fasting samples. Overall insulin sensitivity was determined from the OGTT by combining complementary measures: homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance of the fasting state; Matsuda index of the absorptive state; and minimal model of both fasting and absorptive states. RESULTS: Sleep restriction alone induced hyperinsulinemia, hyperglycemia, and overall insulin resistance (P < 0.001 for each). Clamping cortisol and testosterone alleviated the development of overall insulin resistance (P = 0.046) and hyperinsulinemia (P = 0.014) by 50%. Interleukin-6, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, peptide YY, and ghrelin did not change, whereas tumor necrosis factor-α and leptin changed in directions that would have mitigated insulin resistance with sleep restriction alone. CONCLUSION: Fixing cortisol-testosterone exposure mitigates the development of insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia, but not hyperglycemia, from sustained sleep restriction in men. The interplay between cortisol and testosterone may be important as a mechanism by which sleep restriction impairs metabolic health.",

      "abstract": "Sleep restriction therapy (SRT) is an established treatment for insomnia that has been used in clinical practise for over 30 y. It is commonly delivered as part of multicomponent cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT-I) but has also been linked to beneficial effects as a standalone intervention. In order to quantify the efficacy of SRT we performed a comprehensive meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing SRT to minimally active or non-active control groups. Primary outcomes were self-reported insomnia severity and sleep diary metrics at post-treatment. Weighted effect sizes were calculated with Hedges' g and risk of bias was assessed by two independent raters with the Cochrane tool. Our search yielded eight RCTs meeting inclusion/exclusion criteria. Random effects models revealed large treatment effects in favour of SRT versus control for insomnia severity measured with the insomnia severity index (g = -0.93; 95% CI = -1.15, -0.71), sleep efficiency (g = 0.91; 95% CI = 0.52, 1.31), sleep onset latency (g = -0.62; 95% CI = -0.84, -0.40), and wake-time after sleep onset (g = -0.83; 95% CI = -1.11, -0.55). No effects were found for total sleep time (g = 0.02; 95% CI = -0.29, 0.34). Results should be interpreted in the context of the small number of comparisons (≤6 per outcome), high risk of bias (6 out of 8 studies met criteria for high risk), and heterogeneity in study design and SRT administration. Only a small number of studies provided outcomes at follow-up (n ≤ 3), hindering assessment of long-term effects. Sleep restriction therapy effectively improves insomnia severity and sleep continuity in the short term; more studies are needed to assess if effects are sustained at long-term follow-up (>3 m). Post-treatment effect sizes appear as large as multicomponent CBT-I. To reduce risk of bias, future studies should consider testing the effects of SRT against control groups that are matched for non-specific treatment effects. Large-scale pragmatic trials are also needed to test if SRT is effective in clinical practise and to quantify effects on daytime functioning and quality of life.",

      "abstract": "Clinical studies suggest that sleep impairment is a barrier to successful treatment in alcohol use disorder (AUD) patients, with sleep disruption associated with relapse to alcohol taking. To date, no preclinical study has evaluated the relationship between impaired sleep and alcohol relapse. In the present study, we used a self-administration model to investigate the effects of sleep restriction on reinstatement induced by alcohol-paired environmental cues. Using a sucrose fading protocol, male Wistar rats (N = 8) were trained to self-administer alcohol under a fixed-ratio 2 schedule of alcohol delivery such that completion of every second response resulted in the delivery of the alcohol solution and activation of the alcohol-paired cue light. Once self-administration was stable, behavior was extinguished by omitting delivery of the alcohol solution and the alcohol-paired cues. When responding reached low, stable levels, alcohol seeking was induced by re-presentation of the alcohol-paired cues but with no alcohol solution available for self-administration. To evaluate the effects of sleep restriction on cue-induced alcohol seeking, reinstatement tests were conducted after 6-h of total (slow wave + rapid eye movement [REM]) sleep restriction using the gentle handling method or after 6-h of REM sleep-only restriction using the flower pot method. Relevant control conditions also were evaluated. The results showed that acute restriction of total sleep, but not REM sleep primarily, significantly augmented cue-induced reinstatement of alcohol seeking. This increase was specific to total sleep restriction conditions and cannot be attributed to differences in alcohol intake, responding, or days to extinction. Our findings imply that acute slow wave sleep restriction is necessary and/or sufficient for the enhancement of cue-induced alcohol seeking and, further, suggest that decreased slow wave sleep in AUD patients places individuals at a unique risk for relapse.",

METHODS: Overweight or obese adults were randomized into an 8-week calorie restriction intervention alone (CR, n = 12; 75% female; body mass index = 31.4 ± 2.9 kg/m2) or combined with sleep restriction (CR+SR, n = 16; 75% female; body mass index = 34.5 ± 3.1 kg/m2). Participants in both groups were given the same instructions to reduce calorie intake. Those in the CR+SR group were instructed to reduce their habitual time-in-bed by 30-90 minutes 5 days each week with 2 ad libitum sleep days. Fasting venous blood samples were collected at pre- and post-intervention. RESULTS: Differential changes were found between the two groups (p = 0.028 for group × time interaction) in glucagon concentration, which decreased in the CR group (p = 0.016) but did not change in CR+SR group. Although changes in mean HDL particle (HDL-P) size and visfatin concentration were not statistically different between groups (p = 0.066 and 0.066 for group×time interaction, respectively), mean HDL-P size decreased only in the CR+SR group (Cohen's d = 0.50, p = 0.022); visfatin concentrations did not change significantly in either group but appeared to decrease in the CR group (Cohen's d = 0.67, p = 0.170) but not in the CR+SR group (Cohen's d = 0.43, p = 0.225). CONCLUSION: These results suggest that moderate sleep restriction, despite the presence of periodic ad libitum sleep, influences lipoprotein subclass particles and glucose regulation in individuals undergoing calorie restriction.Clinical trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02413866, Weight Outlooks by Restriction of Diet and Sleep)."

      "abstract": "Sleep-restriction therapy (SRT) has been shown to improve insomnia symptoms by restricting sleep opportunity. Curtailment of time in bed affects the duration and consolidation of sleep, but also its timing. While recent work suggests that people with insomnia are characterised by misalignment between circadian and behavioural timing of sleep, no study has investigated if SRT modifies this relationship. The primary aim of the present study was to examine change in phase angle after 2 weeks of SRT. As a secondary aim, we also sought to assess the effect of SRT on psychomotor vigilance. Following a 1-week baseline phase, participants implemented SRT for 2 consecutive weeks. Phase angle was derived from the difference between the decimal clock time of dim light melatonin onset (DLMO) and attempted sleep time. Secondary outcomes included vigilance (assessed via hourly measurement during the DLMO laboratory protocol), sleep continuity (assessed via sleep diary and actigraphy), and insomnia severity. Eighteen participants meeting insomnia criteria (mean [SD] age 37.06 [8.99] years) took part in the study. Consistent with previous research, participants showed robust improvements in subjective and objective sleep continuity, as well as reductions in insomnia severity. The primary outcome (phase angle) was measurable in 15 participants and revealed an increase of 34.8 min (~0.58 hr; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.01-1.15) from baseline to post-treatment (mean [SD] 2.27 [0.94] versus 2.85 [1.25] hr). DLMO remained relatively stable (20:49 versus 21:01 hours), while attempted sleep was 46.8 min later (~0.78 hr; 95%CI 0.41-1.15; 23:05 versus 23:52 hours). For psychomotor vigilance, reaction time was delayed (by 52.71 ms, 95% CI 34.44-70.97) and number of lapses increased (by 5.84, 95% CI 3.93-7.75) after SRT. We show that SRT increases phase angle during treatment, principally by delaying the timing of sleep attempt. Future studies are needed to test if an increase in phase angle is linked to clinical improvement. Finally, reduction in vigilance after SRT appears to be of similar magnitude to normal sleepers undergoing experimental sleep restriction, reinforcing the importance of appropriate safety advice during implementation.",

The spleens of mice exposed to chronic and repeated psychological stress serve as a reservoir of inflammatory myeloid cells that are released into the blood and brain following secondary acute stress. Here, we tested whether chronic and repeated short-term sleep restriction (CRSR) would exacerbate lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced neuroinflammation, cognitive deficits, and anxiety-like behavior in a spleen-dependent manner. LPS was administered to aged mice 14 days after exposure to CRSR consisting of three cycles of 7 days of sleep restriction with 7-day intervals in between. CRSR increased plasma proinflammatory cytokine levels, blood-brain barrier permeability, hippocampal proinflammatory cytokine levels, and transition of microglia to the M1 phenotype 24 h after LPS treatment. This in turn led to cognitive deficits and anxiety-like behavior. Interestingly, removal of the spleen 14 days prior to CRSR abrogated the enhancement of LPS-induced increases in systemic inflammation, neuroinflammation, cognitive deficits, and anxiety-like behavior. These data indicate that the spleen was essential for CRSR-induced exacerbation of LPS-induced brain damage.",

We studied microglia responses to CSR using a rat model featuring slowly rotating wheels (3 h on/1 h off), which was previously shown to induce both homeostatic and adaptive responses in sleep and attention. Adult male rats were sleep restricted for 27 or 99 h. Control rats were housed in locked wheels. After 27 and/or 99 h of CSR, the number of cells immunoreactive for the microglia marker ionized calcium-binding adaptor molecule-1 (Iba1) and the density of Iba1 immunoreactivity were increased in 4/10 brain regions involved in sleep/wake regulation and cognition, including the prelimbic cortex, central amygdala, perifornical lateral hypothalamic area, and dorsal raphe nucleus. CSR neither induced mitosis in microglia (assessed with bromodeoxyuridine) nor impaired blood-brain barrier permeability (assessed with Evans Blue). Microglia appeared ramified in all treatment groups and, when examined quantitatively in the prelimbic cortex, their morphology was not affected by CSR. After 27 h, but not 99 h, of CSR, mRNA levels of the anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-10 were increased in the frontal cortex. Pro-inflammatory cytokine mRNA levels (tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-1β, and interleukin-6) were unchanged. Furthermore, cortical microglia were not immunoreactive for several pro- and anti-inflammatory markers tested, but were immunoreactive for the purinergic P2Y12 receptor. These results suggest that microglia respond to CSR while remaining in a physiological state and may contribute to the previously reported homeostatic and adaptive responses to CSR.",

Restriction of time in bed (TIB) is assumed to be the central mechanism through which SRT improves sleep consolidation and reduces insomnia symptoms. This hypothesis has never been directly tested. We designed a randomized, controlled, dismantling trial in order to isolate the role of TIB restriction in driving both clinical and polysomnographic sleep outcomes. METHODS: Participants aged 25-55 who met diagnostic criteria for insomnia disorder were block-randomized (1:1) to 4 weeks of SRT or time in bed regularization (TBR), a treatment that involves the prescription of a regular but not reduced TIB. The primary outcome was assessed with the insomnia severity index (ISI) at baseline, 4-, and 12-weeks post-randomization. Secondary outcomes included sleep continuity (assessed via polysomnography, actigraphy, and diary) and quality of life. We performed intention-to-treat analyses using linear mixed models. RESULTS: Fifty-six participants (39 females, mean age = 40.78 ± 9.08) were assigned to SRT (n = 27) or TBR (n = 29). Daily monitoring of sleep via diaries and actigraphy confirmed large group differences in TIB (d range = 1.63-1.98). At 4-weeks post-randomization, the adjusted mean difference for the ISI was -4.49 (d = -1.40) and -4.35 at 12 weeks (d = -1.36), indicating that the SRT group reported reduced insomnia severity relative to TBR. Robust treatment effects in favor of SRT were also found for objective and self-reported sleep continuity variables (d range = 0.40-0.92) and sleep-related quality of life (d = 1.29). CONCLUSIONS: For the first time, we demonstrate that TIB restriction is superior to the regularization of TIB on its own. Our results underscore the centrality of the restriction component in reducing insomnia symptoms and consolidating sleep.",

However, most people, including middle-aged adults of reproductive age, show a marked reduction in their sleep duration. Thus, sleep is a major issue that should be addressed in health management. We investigated the effects of short-term sleep restriction on subjective parameters (sleepiness, stress, fatigue) and physiological parameters (cortisol, thyrotropin [TSH], thyroxine [T4], triiodothyronine [T3], C-reactive protein [CRP]) in middle-aged adults, the recovery of these parameters after rest, and the associations between parameters. METHODS: A total of 118 healthy adults (59 men, 59 women), aged 35-44 years, and without sleep problems, were enrolled. Participants underwent a 4-h sleep restriction per day for 3 day at a hospital, and then returned to their daily lives to take four days of rest. A questionnaire and blood test were administered before and after sleep restriction, and after the recovery period, to assess subjective and physiological parameters. RESULTS: After sleep restriction, sleepiness, fatigue, and stress significantly increased compared to baseline. Cortisol and TSH were elevated after sleep restriction, while T4, T3, and CRP were reduced compared to baseline. After the recovery phase, all parameters were restored to levels similar to baseline levels. Changes in each parameter were mutually associated; fatigue and sleepiness had the strongest association. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that even a short period of sleep restriction can have an adverse impact on psychological and physiological stress parameters in middle-aged adults, and that adequate rest and sleep are needed to restore them to normal levels.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Insomnia is a prevalent sleep disorder that negatively affects quality of life. Multicomponent cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) is the recommended treatment but access remains limited, particularly in primary care. Sleep restriction therapy (SRT) is one of the principal active components of CBT and could be delivered by generalist staff in primary care. The aim of this randomised controlled trial is to establish whether nurse-delivered SRT for insomnia disorder is clinically and cost-effective compared with sleep hygiene advice. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: In the HABIT (Health-professional Administered Brief Insomnia Therapy) trial, 588 participants meeting criteria for insomnia disorder will be recruited from primary care in England and randomised (1:1) to either nurse-delivered SRT (plus sleep hygiene booklet) or sleep hygiene booklet on its own. SRT will be delivered over 4 weekly sessions; total therapy time is approximately 1 hour. Outcomes will be collected at baseline, 3, 6 and 12 months post-randomisation. The primary outcome is self-reported insomnia severity using the Insomnia Severity Index at 6 months. Secondary outcomes include health-related and sleep-related quality of life, depressive symptoms, use of prescribed sleep medication, diary and actigraphy-recorded sleep parameters, and work productivity. Analyses will be intention-to-treat. Moderation and mediation analyses will be conducted and a cost-utility analysis and process evaluation will be performed. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval was granted by the Yorkshire and the Humber - Bradford Leeds Research Ethics Committee (reference: 18/YH/0153). We will publish our primary findings in high-impact, peer-reviewed journals. There will be further outputs in relation to process evaluation and secondary analyses focussed on moderation and mediation. Trial results could make the case for the introduction of nurse-delivered sleep therapy in primary care, increasing access to evidence-based treatment for people with insomnia disorder.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Studies assessing the impact of sleep restriction (SR) on blood pressure (BP) are limited by short study length, extreme SR (<4 hours a night), and lack of attention to psychological distress as a possible mediator. METHODS: A community-based cohort was assembled with 237 women (age 34.1 ± 13.5 years; body mass index 25.4 ± 5.4 kg/m2), and a randomized, crossover, intervention study was conducted in 41 women (24 completed: age 30.2 ± 6.5 years; body mass index 24.3 ± 2.8 kg/m2) to determine the causal effect of SR on BP. Sleep was maintained as usual (HS) or reduced by 1.5 hours a night (SR) for 6 weeks. In the cohort, associations between sleep and psychosocial factors were evaluated using multivariable models adjusted for demographic and clinical confounders. In the intervention study, in-office BP was measured weekly; ambulatory BP was measured at end point. Psychological factors were assessed at baseline and end point. Mixed-model analyses with total sleep time (TST, main predictor), week and fraction of time spent in physical activity (covariates), and subject (random effect) were performed. RESULTS: Among the community cohort, higher perceived stress, stressful events and distress, and lower resilience were associated with shorter sleep, worse sleep quality, and greater insomnia symptoms (P < .05). In the intervention, systolic BP increased as TST decreased (TST × week interaction, [coefficient ± standard error] -0.0097 ± 0.0046, P = .036). Wake ambulatory diastolic blood pressure (-0.059 ± 0.022, P = .021) and mean arterial pressure (-0.067 ± 0.023, P = .018) were higher after SR versus HS. Psychological distress variables were not affected by TST and did not mediate the effects of SR on BP. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that SR influences CVD risk in women via mechanisms independent of psychological stressors.",

It is also unknown whether prior sleep buffers the impact of sleep restriction on anxiety symptoms. Thus, the present study examined the relations between inhibition and repetitive negative thinking (RNT), obsessions, and other OCD symptoms following sleep restriction and the moderating role of prior night's sleep efficiency. Healthy sleeping adults (n = 73) completed measures of inhibition, anxiety symptoms, and sleep before and after one night of sleep restriction (4 h between 4:00am and 8:00am). Results indicate significant associations between decreased post-sleep restriction inhibition and increased post-sleep restriction RNT and obsessions. Prior night's subjective and objective sleep efficiency significantly moderated these relations, such that the highest post-sleep restriction anxiety symptoms were reported by those with the lowest post-sleep restriction inhibition and the lowest pre-sleep restriction sleep efficiency. These findings suggest decreased inhibition may be one mechanism by which sleep loss affects anxiety, and those with worse sleep prior to acute sleep loss may be particularly vulnerable. The implications for the prevention and treatment of anxiety-related disorders characterized by intrusive cognition are discussed.",

In this study, mice were subjected to 60 min of cerebral ischemia followed by reperfusion. The SR protocol was accomplished by depriving mice of sleep for 20 h/day for 14 days starting at 14 days post-ischemia. We found that SR increased CD169+ macrophages infiltration into the ischemic brain parenchyma and inhibited neurogenesis and functional recovery. SR decreased CD169+ macrophages infiltration into the choroid plexus (CP) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), accompanied by increased expression of Chemokine C-X3-C-Motif Ligand 1 (CX3CL1) and intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM-1) via IFN-γ/IFN-γR signaling in the CP. When splenic CD169+ macrophages sorted from Kaede transgenic mice were administered into CSF of C57BL/6 mice, they homed to the ischemic brain parenchyma. Moreover, blockade of IFN-γ/IFN-γR signaling, CX3CL1 or ICAM-1 decreased CD169+ macrophages infiltration into the CP, CSF and ischemic brain parenchyma, as well as decreasing neurogenesis and functional recovery after SR. The promoting roles of infiltrated CD169+ macrophages in post-stroke neurogenesis were due to increasing regulatory T cells (Tregs) in the ischemic brain parenchyma. Furthermore, dexmedetomidine treatment during SR increased CD169+ macrophages infiltration into the CP, CSF and ischemic brain parenchyma, and promoted neurogenesis and functional recovery. Taken together, our results showed that SR during stroke recovery decreased Tregs in the ischemic brain parenchyma by decreasing CD169+ macrophages infiltration to the ischemic brain parenchyma across the CP, which inhibited neurogenesis and functional recovery.",

      "abstract": "KEY POINTS: Sleep restriction has previously been associated with the loss of muscle mass in both human and animal models. The rate of myofibrillar protein synthesis (MyoPS) is a key variable in regulating skeletal muscle mass and can be increased by performing high-intensity interval exercise (HIIE), although the effect of sleep restriction on MyoPS is unknown. In the present study, we demonstrate that participants undergoing a sleep restriction protocol (five nights, with 4 h in bed each night) had lower rates of skeletal muscle MyoPS; however, rates of MyoPS were maintained at control levels by performing HIIE during this period. Our data suggest that the lower rates of MyoPS in the sleep restriction group may contribute to the detrimental effects of sleep loss on muscle mass and that HIIE may be used as an intervention to counteract these effects. ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to investigate the effect of sleep restriction, with or without high-intensity interval exercise (HIIE), on the potential mechanisms underpinning previously-reported sleep-loss-induced reductions to muscle mass. Twenty-four healthy, young men underwent a protocol consisting of two nights of controlled baseline sleep and a five-night intervention period. Participants were allocated into one of three parallel groups, matched for age, V̇O2peak , body mass index and habitual sleep duration; a normal sleep (NS) group [8 h time in bed (TIB) each night], a sleep restriction (SR) group (4 h TIB each night), and a sleep restriction and exercise group (SR+EX, 4 h TIB each night, with three sessions of HIIE). Deuterium oxide was ingested prior to commencing the study and muscle biopsies obtained pre- and post-intervention were used to assess myofibrillar protein synthesis (MyoPS) and molecular markers of protein synthesis and degradation signalling pathways. MyoPS was lower in the SR group [fractional synthetic rate (% day-1 ), mean ± SD, 1.24 ± 0.21] compared to both the NS (1.53 ± 0.09) and SR+EX groups (1.61 ± 0.14) (P < 0.05). However, there were no changes in the purported regulators of protein synthesis (i.e. p-AKTser473 and p-mTORser2448 ) and degradation (i.e. Foxo1/3 mRNA and LC3 protein) in any group. These data suggest that MyoPS is acutely reduced by sleep restriction, although MyoPS can be maintained by performing HIIE. These findings may explain the sleep-loss-induced reductions in muscle mass previously reported and also highlight the potential therapeutic benefit of HIIE to maintain myofibrillar remodelling in this context.",

      "abstract": "STUDY OBJECTIVES: Sleep restriction therapy (SRT) has been shown to be comparably effective relative to cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I), but with lower requirements for patient contact. As such, SRT appears to be a viable alternate treatment for those who cannot complete a full course of CBT-I. However, it is unclear whether SRT-a treatment solely focusing on restricting time in bed-increases risk for sleepiness comparably to CBT-I. The current study tested objective sleepiness as an outcome in a randomized controlled trial comparing SRT, CBT-I, and attention control in a sample of postmenopausal women in whom insomnia was diagnosed according to criteria of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition. METHODS: Single-site, randomized controlled trial. A total of 150 postmenopausal women (56.44 ± 5.64 years) with perimenopausal or postmenopausal onset of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition insomnia disorder were randomized to 3 treatment conditions: sleep education control (6 sessions); SRT (2 sessions with interim phone contact); and CBT-I (6 sessions). Blinded assessments were performed at pretreatment and posttreatment. Risk of excessive sleepiness was evaluated using a symmetry analysis of sleepiness measured through the Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT). RESULTS: The odds ratios (ORs) of being excessively sleepy versus nonsleepy were not different than 1.0 for both SRT (OR = 0.94, 95% confidence interval [0.13-6.96]) and CBT-I (OR = 0.62, 95% confidence interval [0.09-4.46]), indicating that the odds of becoming excessively sleepy following treatment was not different from the odds of being nonsleepy. This suggests that excessive sleepiness is not of unique concern following SRT relative to CBT-I or sleep education. CONCLUSIONS: SRT appears to have a comparable risk profile for excessive sleepiness as CBT-I, and thus may be considered a safe alternative to CBT-I. Future research should characterize objective measures of excessive sleepiness immediately following sleep restriction.

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: Sleep deprivation is present not only in sleep disorders but also in numerous high demanding jobs and negatively affects cognition, performance and health. We developed a study design to distinguish the effects and need for recovery of two short-term disturbances - intermittent sleep fragmentation and partial sleep restriction. METHODS: The randomized within-subjects design contained two weeks each with a baseline night, an intervention night of either sleep deprivation (5 h) or sleep fragmentation (light on every hour) and two undisturbed recovery nights. Twenty healthy male participants (mean age: 39.9 ± 7.4 years, mean BMI: 25.5 ± 2.2 kg/m²) underwent polysomnography, a psychomotor vigilance task (PVT), and subjective questions on well-being and sleep efficiency. RESULTS: Percentage-wise, the restriction night had significant less wake times, less light sleep (stage 1), less REM sleep, but more deep sleep (stage 3) than the fragmentation night. The restriction week displayed a significant recovery effect regarding these sleep stages. The sleep fragmentation week presented a significant recovery effect regarding sleep onset times. PVT performance showed only a slight recovery effect after sleep restriction. Subjective sleep quality was reduced after both interventions with a significant recovery effect during restriction week only. CONCLUSIONS: Short-term sleep restriction presented as a stronger sleep disturbance than short-term intermittent sleep fragmentation, including a stronger need for recovery. Already a one night sleep deprivation had an effect beyond two recovery days. The PVT was not sensitive enough to reveal significant changes. Next, autonomic parameters as possible biomarkers will be investigated.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Internet-based cognitive behavioral treatment (iCBT-I) for insomnia comprising different sleep-related cognitive and behavioral interventional components has shown some promise. However, it is not known which components are necessary for a good treatment outcome. METHOD: People suffering from insomnia (N = 104) without any other comorbid psychiatric disorders were randomized (2:2:1) to two guided internet-based self-help interventions for insomnia [multi-component cognitive behavioral self-help intervention (MCT); sleep restriction intervention for insomnia (SRT)], and care as usual [CAU]. In all three conditions, additional care or treatment was allowed. The primary outcome was insomnia severity measured with the insomnia severity index (ISI) at eight weeks. Furthermore, the two active conditions were compared regarding sleep efficacy from daily diary data over the eight weeks, and other measures from the daily protocols. Secondary outcomes included sleep quality, depressive symptoms, dysfunctional beliefs, and quality of life at post-treatment (eight weeks) and follow-up (six months after randomization). RESULTS: Both conditions were more effective than CAU at post-treatment, with medium to large between-group effect sizes on the primary outcome (ISI; MCT: Cohen's d = -1.15; SRT: d = -0.68) and small to medium between-group effect sizes for secondary outcomes. Treatment gains were maintained at six-month follow-up. Active conditions did not differ from each other on all measures from pre to post, except for dysfunctional beliefs about sleep, and sleep protocol data throughout the intervention. Participants in MCT were significantly more satisfied with the intervention than participants in SRT. CONCLUSIONS: Results of the present study indicate that CAU + MCT and CAU + SRT are both effective compared to CAU. There were no statistical differences regarding efficacy between the two active conditions, but participants in MCT reported to be more satisfied with the intervention.",

      "abstract": "UNLABELLED: We describe the time course of bone formation marker (P1NP) decline in men exposed to ~ 3 weeks of sleep restriction with concurrent circadian disruption. P1NP declined within 10 days and remained lower with ongoing exposure. These data suggest even brief exposure to sleep and circadian disruptions may disrupt bone metabolism. INTRODUCTION: A serum bone formation marker (procollagen type 1 N-terminal, P1NP) was lower after ~ 3 weeks of sleep restriction combined with circadian disruption. We now describe the time course of decline. METHODS: The ~ 3-week protocol included two segments: \"baseline,\" ≥ 10-h sleep opportunity/day × 5 days; \"forced desynchrony\" (FD), recurring 28 h day (circadian disruption) with sleep restriction (~ 5.6-h sleep per 24 h). Fasted plasma P1NP was measured throughout the protocol in nine men (20-59 years old). We tested the hypothesis that PINP would steadily decline across the FD intervention because the magnitude of sleep loss and circadian misalignment accrued as the protocol progressed. A piecewise linear regression model was used to estimate the slope (β) as ΔP1NP per 24 h with a change point mid-protocol to estimate the initial vs. prolonged effects of FD exposure. RESULTS: Plasma P1NP levels declined significantly within the first 10 days of FD ([Formula: see text] = - 1.33 μg/L per 24 h, p < 0.0001) and remained lower than baseline with prolonged exposure out to 3 weeks ([Formula: see text] = - 0.18 μg/L per 24 h, p = 0.67). As previously reported, levels of a bone resorption marker (C-telopeptide (CTX)) were unchanged. CONCLUSION: Sleep restriction with concurrent circadian disruption induced a relatively rapid decline in P1NP (despite no change in CTX) and levels remained lower with ongoing exposure. These data suggest (1) even brief sleep restriction and circadian disruption can adversely affect bone metabolism, and (2) there is no P1NP recovery with ongoing exposure that, taken together, could lead to lower bone density over time.",

      "abstract": "STUDY OBJECTIVES: Insomnia is a chief complaint among postmenopausal women, and insomnia impairs daytime functioning and reduces quality of life. Recent evidence supports the efficacy of cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBTI) for menopausal insomnia, but it remains unclear whether treating insomnia improves daytime function in this population. This study evaluated whether CBTI improves daytime fatigue, energy, self-reported sleepiness, work productivity, and quality of life in postmenopausal women with insomnia, and whether sleep restriction therapy (SRT)-a single component of CBTI-is equally efficacious. METHODS: Single-site, randomized control trial. One hundred fifty postmenopausal women (56.44 ± 5.64 years) with perimenopausal or postmenopausal onset or exacerbation of chronic insomnia were randomized to 3 treatment conditions: sleep hygiene education control (SHE), SRT, and CBTI. Blinded assessments were performed at pretreatment, posttreatment, and 6-month follow-up. RESULTS: CBTI and SRT produced moderate-to-large improvements in fatigue, energy, sleepiness, and work function at posttreatment and 6 months later. The CBTI group reported better quality of life as indicated by substantial improvements in emotional wellbeing and resiliency to physical and emotional problems, whereas the SRT and SHE groups only showed improvements in resiliency to physical problems. Pain complaints decreased as sleep improved but were not associated with specific treatment conditions. Similarly, insomnia remitters reported fewer daytime and nighttime hot flashes, although reductions were not associated with any specific treatment. CONCLUSIONS: CBTI and SRT are efficacious options for postmenopausal women with chronic insomnia. Both interventions improve daytime function, quality of life, and work performance, although CBTI produces superior results including the added benefit of improved emotional health.

Eleven elite cyclists obtained a one-week baseline of habitual sleep then restricted sleep to 4 h/night (SR) for three nights assessed through self-report and actigraphy. Pre and post-intervention measures were a box drop maximal vertical jump with 3D motion capture to assess physical performance and biomechanical changes, and Psychomotor Vigilance Task (PVT) assessed changes in response time. Associations between biomechanical, physical, and cognitive performance measures were assessed. Participants restricted reported sleep from 7.4 ± 0.5 h/night at baseline to 4.0 ± 0.2 h/night and actigraphy indicated 6.7 ± 0.7 to 3.7 ± 0.2 h/night. Following SR, jump height decreased (0.44 ± 0.09 vs. 0.42 ± 0.10 m, p = 0.02, g = 0.21). Hip sagittal/knee frontal (Δ15.5°, p = 0.04, g = 0.40) and hip frontal/knee frontal (Δ11.0°, p < 0.01, g = 0.44) plane coordination variability increased after SR. Hip sagittal/knee frontal plane coordination variability after SR was associated with increasingly slower PVT response time (r = 0.63, p = 0.03). These findings suggest SR for three days decreased maximal jump performance. SR increased joint coordination variability and was associated with greater impairment in response time. SR leads to deviations from preferred movement patterns, which may have implications for decrements in athlete performance and increased injury risk.",

Intentional emotional regulation after sleep restriction has, however, never been studied using brain imaging. We aimed here to investigate the effect of partial sleep restriction on emotional regulation through cognitive reappraisal. Forty-seven young (age 20-30) and 33 older (age 65-75) participants (38/23 with complete data and successful sleep intervention) performed a cognitive reappraisal task during fMRI after a night of normal sleep and after restricted sleep (3 h). Emotional downregulation was associated with significantly increased activity in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (p FWE < 0.05) and lateral orbital cortex (p FWE < 0.05) in young, but not in older subjects. Sleep restriction was associated with a decrease in self-reported regulation success to negative stimuli (p < 0.01) and a trend towards perceiving all stimuli as less negative (p = 0.07) in young participants. No effects of sleep restriction on brain activity nor connectivity were found in either age group. In conclusion, our data do not support the idea of a prefrontal-amygdala disconnect after sleep restriction, and neural mechanisms underlying behavioural effects on emotional regulation after insufficient sleep require further investigation."

A systematic search was conducted in six electronic databases from inception to January 2018. We identified 41 randomized controlled trials using sleep restriction intervention. The outcomes included: subjective hunger, appetite-regulating hormones, changes in brain activity, energy intake and expenditure, weight change, insulin sensitivity or resistance. Sleep restriction resulted in a significant increase in subjective hunger on a 100 mm scale (mean difference = 13.4, p < 0.001). Participants consumed 252.8 more kcal/d (p = 0.011) under sleep restriction than under normal sleep. Partial sleep restriction resulted in a 0.34 kg weight gain (p = 0.003). Sleep restriction also decreased insulin sensitivity (standardized mean difference = -0.70, p < 0.01). Significant changes in brain activity in response to food stimuli were observed under sleep restriction, particularly regions related to cognitive control and reward. Overall, we did not find strong evidence supporting the significant impact of sleep restriction on mean leptin or ghrelin levels or energy expenditure. Findings from this review enhanced our knowledge about the detrimental effects of sleep restriction on metabolism and provided novel directions in preventing metabolic diseases including obesity and diabetes.",

      "abstract": "Insomnia is the most common sleep disorder among adults, especially affecting individuals of advanced age or with neurodegenerative disease. Insomnia is also a common comorbidity across psychiatric disorders. Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) is the first-line treatment for insomnia; a key component of this intervention is restriction of sleep opportunity, which optimizes matching of sleep ability and opportunity, leading to enhanced sleep drive. Despite the well-documented efficacy of CBT-I, little is known regarding how CBT-I works at a cellular and molecular level to improve sleep, due in large part to an absence of experimentally-tractable animals models of this intervention. Here, guided by human behavioral sleep therapies, we developed a Drosophila model for sleep restriction therapy (SRT) of insomnia. We demonstrate that restriction of sleep opportunity through manipulation of environmental cues improves sleep efficiency in multiple short-sleeping Drosophila mutants. The response to sleep opportunity restriction requires ongoing environmental inputs, but is independent of the molecular circadian clock. We apply this sleep opportunity restriction paradigm to aging and Alzheimer's disease fly models, and find that sleep impairments in these models are reversible with sleep restriction, with associated improvement in reproductive fitness and extended lifespan. This work establishes a model to investigate the neurobiological basis of CBT-I, and provides a platform that can be exploited toward novel treatment targets for insomnia.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Depression increases during menopause, and subclinical depressive symptoms increase risk for major depression. Insomnia is common among postmenopausal women and increases depression-risk in this already-vulnerable population. Recent evidence supports the efficacy of cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBTI) to treat menopausal insomnia, but it remains unclear whether treating insomnia also alleviates co-occurring depressive symptoms and depressogenic features. This trial tested whether CBTI improves depressive symptoms, maladaptive thinking, and somatic hyperarousal in postmenopausal women with insomnia; as well as whether sleep restriction therapy (SRT)-a single component of CBTI-is equally efficacious. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Single-site, randomized controlled trial. 117 postmenopausal women (56.34 ± 5.41 years) with peri-or-postmenopausal onset of chronic insomnia were randomized to three treatment conditions: sleep hygiene education control (SHE), SRT, and CBTI. Blinded assessments were performed at baseline, posttreatment, and six-month follow-up. RESULTS: CBTI produced moderate-to-large reductions in depressive symptoms, whereas SRT produced moderate reductions but not until six months posttreatment. Treatment effects on maladaptive thinking were mixed. CBTI and SRT both produced large improvements in dysfunctional beliefs about sleep, but weaker influences on presleep cognitive arousal, rumination, and worry. Presleep somatic arousal greatly improved in the CBTI group and moderately improved in the SRT group. Improvements in depression, maladaptive thinking, and hyperarousal were linked to improved sleep. SHE produced no durable treatment effects. CONCLUSIONS: CBTI and SRT reduce depressive symptoms, dysfunctional beliefs about sleep, and presleep somatic hyperarousal in postmenopausal women, with CBTI producing superior results. Despite its cognitive emphasis, cognitive arousal did not respond strongly or durably to CBTI. NAME: Behavioral Treatment of Menopausal Insomnia: Sleep and Daytime Outcomes. URL: clinicaltrials.gov.

Total and partial acute sleep restriction may be useful paradigms for elucidating these effects. We examined the impact of acute sleep restriction on cerebral glucose metabolism during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep in individuals with primary insomnia (n = 17) and good sleep (n = 19). METHODS: Participants underwent [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography scans during baseline and recovery NREM sleep following one night of partial or total sleep restriction. We compared group differences in baseline-recovery changes, as well as main effects of group and condition (baseline vs. recovery NREM sleep), for relative regional cerebral metabolic rate for glucose (rCMRglc), whole-brain glucose metabolism, and sleep quality. RESULTS: Relative rCMRglc was significantly lower during recovery NREM sleep compared to baseline in the left frontoparietal cortex, medial frontal cortex, posterior cingulate cortex, and thalamus, with no significant group differences. Good sleepers, but not insomnia patients, had lower whole-brain glucose metabolism during recovery NREM sleep compared to baseline. Acute sleep restriction improved sleep quality in individual with insomnia. Subgroup analyses including only participants who underwent partial sleep restriction yielded the same pattern of findings. CONCLUSION: Individuals with insomnia and good sleepers showed similar relative rCMRglc responses to acute sleep restriction. Brain regions showing the greatest baseline-recovery changes in both groups included regions previously shown to have smaller sleep-wake differences in patients with primary insomnia. Acute sleep restriction, and by extension sleep restriction therapy, may impact regional metabolic alterations that characterize insomnia.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Although poor sleep is often reported in adolescents with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), prior studies have been correlational. This study investigated whether sleep duration is causally linked to sleepiness, inattention, and behavioral functioning in adolescents with ADHD. METHOD: A total of 72 adolescents (aged 14-17 years) entered a 3-week sleep protocol using an experimental crossover design. The protocol included a phase stabilization week, followed in randomized counterbalanced order by 1 week of sleep restriction (6.5 hours) and 1 week of sleep extension (9.5 hours). Sleep was monitored with actigraphy and daily sleep diaries, with laboratory visits at the end of each week. Analyses included 48 adolescents who had complete actigraphy data and successfully completed the sleep protocol (defined a priori as obtaining ≥1 hour actigraphy-measured sleep duration during extension compared to restriction). Parent and adolescent ratings of daytime sleepiness, ADHD symptoms, sluggish cognitive tempo (SCT), and oppositional behaviors were the primary measures. The A-X Continuous Performance Test (CPT) was a secondary measure. RESULTS: Compared to the extended sleep week, parents reported more inattentive and oppositional symptoms during the restricted sleep week. Both parents and adolescents reported more SCT symptoms and greater daytime sleepiness during restriction compared to extension. Adolescents reported less hyperactivity-impulsivity during sleep restriction than extension. No effects were found for parent-reported hyperactivity-impulsivity, adolescent-reported ADHD inattention, or CPT performance. CONCLUSION: This study provides the first evidence that sleep duration is a causal contributor to daytime behaviors in adolescents with ADHD. Sleep may be an important target for intervention in adolescents with ADHD.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Overconsumption of energy-dense foods and sleep restriction are both associated with the development of metabolic and cardiovascular diseases, but their combined effects remain poorly evaluated. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess whether sleep restriction potentiates the effects of a short-term overfeeding on intrahepatocellular lipid (IHCL) concentrations and on glucose homeostasis. DESIGN: Ten healthy subjects were exposed to a 6-d overfeeding period (130% daily energy needs, with 15% extra energy as sucrose and 15% as fat), with normal sleep (8 h sleep opportunity time) or sleep restriction (4 h sleep opportunity time), according to a randomized, crossover design. At baseline and after intervention, IHCL concentrations were measured by proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and a dual intravenous [6,6-2H2]-, oral 13C-labeled glucose tolerance test and a polysomnographic recording were performed. RESULTS: Overfeeding significantly increased IHCL concentrations (Poverfeeding < 0.001; overfeeding + normal sleep: +53% ± 16%). During the oral glucose tolerance test, overfeeding significantly increased endogenous glucose production (Poverfeeding = 0.034) and the oxidation of 13C-labeled glucose load (Poverfeeding = 0.038). Sleep restriction significantly decreased total sleep time, and the duration of stages 1 and 2 and rapid eye movement sleep (all P < 0.001), whereas slow-wave sleep duration was preserved (Poverfeeding × sleep = 0.809). Compared with overfeeding, overfeeding + sleep restriction did not change IHCL concentrations (Poverfeeding × sleep = 0.541; +83% ± 33%), endogenous glucose production (Poverfeeding × sleep = 0.567), or exogenous glucose oxidation (Poverfeeding × sleep = 0.118). Sleep restriction did not significantly alter blood pressure, heart rate, or plasma cortisol concentrations (all Poverfeeding × sleep = NS). CONCLUSIONS: Six days of a high-sucrose, high-fat overfeeding diet significantly increased IHCL concentrations and increased endogenous glucose production, suggesting hepatic insulin resistance. These effects of overfeeding were not altered by sleep restriction. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT02075723. Other study ID numbers: SleepDep 02/14.",

      "abstract": "STUDY OBJECTIVES: Insomnia is a leading cause of disability in postmenopausal women. Multicomponent cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBTI) is a first-line treatment for chronic insomnia, but support for its efficacy in treating menopause-related insomnia is scarce. The present study evaluated whether CBTI is an efficacious treatment for menopause-related chronic insomnia, and whether sleep restriction therapy (SRT)-a single component of CBTI-is equally efficacious compared with CBTI. METHODS: In a single-site, randomized controlled trial, 150 postmenopausal women (56.44 ± 5.64 years) with chronic DSM-5 insomnia disorder related to menopause were randomized to three treatment conditions: sleep hygiene education (SHE), SRT, or CBTI. Blinded assessments were performed at baseline, posttreatment, and 6 months after treatment. The Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) and sleep diaries served as primary outcomes. RESULTS: From baseline to posttreatment, ISI decreased 7.70 points in the CBTI group (p < .001), 6.56 points in the SRT group (p < .001), and 1.12 in the SHE group (p = .01). Although average sleep duration increased in all groups by 6 month follow-up, CBTI patients obtained 40-43 more minutes of nightly sleep than those who received SHE or SRT. Remission rates in the CBTI (54%-84%) and SRT (38%-57%) groups were higher than SHE patients (4%-33%) at posttreatment and 6 month follow-up. CBTI patients were generally more likely to remit than SRT patients. CONCLUSIONS: CBTI and SRT effectively treat menopause-related insomnia disorder and are superior to SHE. Response to CBTI and SRT is similar, but CBTI outperforms SRT in improving sleep maintenance, which may increase likelihood of remission.

      "abstract": "For over 30 y sleep restriction therapy (SRT) has been used to treat insomnia but we know very little about how this therapy exerts its effects. When SRT was first described, it was hypothesised to treat insomnia by addressing four key factors: strengthening homeostatic sleep pressure, inhibiting perpetuating practices (excessive time in bed), attenuating hyperarousal and tightening regulatory control of sleep by the endogenous circadian pacemaker. We conducted a systematic literature review in search of evidence for these putative mechanisms-of-action. A total of 15 randomised and non-randomised studies investigating SRT met inclusion criteria. For each study, we extracted all variables associated with the proposed mechanisms and assessed study quality using a structured appraisal tool. The extracted variables were: time in bed (TIB), napping, variability in sleep, markers of circadian rhythmicity, measurements of sleep pressure/sleepiness, and assessments of arousal. Overall study quality was poor as indicated by a mean quality score of 17 (out of a possible range of 0-31). No study indicated, or indeed was designed to test, whether changes in the proposed mechanisms act as mediators of treatment outcomes. Of all reviewed studies, most reported a reduction in TIB (10/10) and/or revealed a decrease in sleep onset latency (10/14), indexing increased sleep pressure. However, such changes were most often reported at the end of treatment, reflecting an outcome and not a mechanism of SRT per se. Evidence for reduction in arousal (4/4) and night-to-night sleep variability (2/2) was found in only a small number of uncontrolled studies while there was no evidence for change in circadian phase or periodicity (0/1). Our review suggests that SRT targets some of the hypothesised processes but specifically-designed mechanistic evaluations are needed. We introduce a new testable model of SRT mechanism-of-action (Triple-R) and set out a research agenda aimed at stimulating prospective investigations.",

      "abstract": "Sleep is regulated by a homeostatic process which in the two-process model of human sleep regulation is represented by electroencephalogram slow-wave activity (SWA). Many studies of acute manipulation of wake duration have confirmed the precise homeostatic regulation of SWA in rodents and humans. However, some chronic sleep restriction studies in rodents show that the sleep homeostatic response, as indexed by SWA, is absent or diminishes suggesting adaptation occurs. Here, we investigate the response to 7 days of sleep restriction (6 hr time in bed) and extension (10 hr time in bed) as well as the response to subsequent total sleep deprivation in 35 healthy participants in a cross-over design. The homeostatic response was quantified by analyzing sleep structure and SWA measures. Sleep restriction resulted primarily in a reduction of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. SWA and accumulated SWA (slow-wave energy, SWE) were not much affected by sleep extension/restriction. The SWA responses did not diminish significantly in the course of the intervention and did not deviate significantly from the predictions of the two-process model. The response to total sleep deprivation consisted of an increase in SWA and rise rate of SWA and SWE and did not differ between the two conditions. The data show that changes in sleep duration within an ecologically relevant range have a marked effect on REM sleep and that SWA responds in accordance with predictions based on a saturating exponential increase during wake and an exponential decline in sleep of homeostatic sleep pressure during both chronic sleep restriction and extension.",

To date, the evidence for contraindications for SRT is limited to very few studies. The present study investigated the objective and subjective daytime consequences during the acute phase of SRT for adults diagnosed with Chronic Insomnia Disorder. METHODS: Sixteen adults (age = 36.3 ± 13.4 yrs, 12 females, 4 males) underwent SRT for their insomnia over a two week period based on recommendations by Miller and colleagues (2014) [6]. Participants completed sleep diaries, self-reported daytime sleepiness (Epworth Sleepiness Scale [ESS]), as well as objective measures of reaction time/inhibition (Go/NoGo task) and driving performance (AusEd driving simulator) at pre-, mid- (ie, after one week of SRT) and post-SRT (after two weeks of SRT). RESULTS: Sleep diary outcomes indicated participants complied with the restriction of time in bed, and that a similar amount of total sleep time (TST) was maintained from pre-to-post-treatment. There was no significant change in daytime sleepiness, and similarly no significant changes observed in objective performance on the Go/NoGo task and AusEd driving simulator. CONCLUSIONS: These preliminary results suggest SRT during the acute phase does not appear to place insomnia patients at risk of significant impairments in sleepiness and reaction times. We note these findings can only be translated into clinical practice when sleep duration remains relatively unchanged. Future studies using objective measures of sleep and a control group are recommended.",

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Male rats were randomly submitted to nine groups, including distilled water, CUR (100 mg/kg/day), olive oil, CSR plus distilled water, CSR plus CUR, CSR plus olive oil, grid-floor plus distilled water, grid-floor plus CUR, and grid-floor plus olive oil groups. Sleep deficiency was imposed using the multi-platform box containing water for 18 h/day. In 21 days, animal's brains were prepared for stereological studies. RESULTS: The mean dendrite length in CA1 neurons was reduced by 39% (p < 0.05) while the density of stubby, thin, and mushroom spines reduced by 38%, 33% and 32%, respectively (p < 0.01), in the CSR + distilled water group compared to the distilled water group. Yet, CUR treatment in CSR-rats was found to protect the declined dendritic length as well as loss of stubby and mushroom but not thin spines. CONCLUSION: The estimated dendritic length using the virtual space-ball method revealed that chronic sleep restriction for 18 h/day over 21 days could induce shortening and shedding of the CA1 dendritic trees which could notably be protected by CUR.",

      "abstract": "CONTEXT: Sleep abnormalities are associated with low bone mineral density. Underlying mechanisms are unknown. OBJECTIVE: Investigate the impact of sleep restriction with circadian disruption on bone biomarkers. DESIGN: Intervention study. PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS: Four bone biomarkers [C-terminal cross-linked telopeptide of type I collagen (CTX) = bone resorption, N-terminal propeptide of type I procollagen (P1NP) = bone formation, sclerostin and fibroblast growth factor 23 = osteocyte function] were measured in bihourly serum samples over 24 hours at baseline and after ∼3 weeks of sleep restriction (5.6 hours sleep/24 hours) with concurrent circadian disruption (recurring 28-hour \"day\" in dim light) in 10 men (age groups: 20 to 27 years, n = 6; 55 to 65 years, n = 4). The effects of sleep/circadian disruption and age on bone biomarker levels were evaluated using maximum likelihood estimation in a mixed model for repeated measures. RESULTS: P1NP levels were lower after intervention compared with baseline (P < 0.001); the decrease in P1NP was greater for younger compared with older men (28.0% vs 18.2%, P < 0.001). There was no change in CTX (Δ = 0.03 ± 0.02 ng/mL, P = 0.10). Sclerostin levels were higher postintervention in the younger men only (Δ = 22.9% or 5.64 ± 1.10 pmol/L, P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that 3 weeks of circadian disruption with concurrent sleep restriction can lead to an uncoupling of bone turnover wherein bone formation is decreased but bone resorption is unchanged. Circadian disruption and sleep restriction may be most detrimental to bone in early adulthood.",

Neuropeptide S (NPS), an endogenous neuropeptide that improves short term memory, activates arousal and decreases anxiety is likely to counteract the SR-induced impairment of STM. The objective of the present study was to find common cerebral pathways in sleep restriction and NPS action in order to ultimately antagonize SR effect on memory. The STM was assessed using a spontaneous spatial alternation task in a T-maze. C57-Bl/6J male mice were distributed in 4 groups according to treatment (0.1nmol of NPS or vehicle intracerebroventricular injection) and to 20h-SR. Immediately after behavioural testing, regional c-fos immunohistochemistry was performed and used as a neural activation marker for spatial short term memory (prefrontal cortex, dorsal hippocampus) and emotional reactivity (basolateral amygdala and ventral hippocampus). Anxiety-like behaviour was assessed using elevated-plus maze task. Results showed that SR impaired short term memory performance and decreased neuronal activation in cingular cortex.NPS injection overcame SR-induced STM deficits and increased neuronal activation in infralimbic cortex. SR spared anxiety-like behavior in the elevated-plus maze. Neural activation in basolateral nucleus of amygdala and ventral hippocampus were not changed after SR.In conclusion, the present study shows that NPS overcomes SR-induced STM deficits by increasing prefrontal cortex activation independently of anxiety-like behaviour.",

      "abstract": "Systemic immune function is impaired by sleep restriction. However, the impact of sleep restriction on local immune responses and to what extent any impairment can be mitigated by nutritional supplementation is unknown. We assessed the effect of 72-h sleep restriction (2-h nightly sleep) on local immune function and skin barrier restoration of an experimental wound, and determined the influence of habitual protein intake (1.5 g·kg-1·day-1) supplemented with arginine, glutamine, zinc sulfate, vitamin C, vitamin D3, and omega-3 fatty acids compared with lower protein intake (0.8 g·kg-1·day-1) without supplemental nutrients on these outcomes. Wounds were created in healthy adults by removing the top layer of less than or equal to eight forearm blisters induced via suction, after adequate sleep (AS) or 48 h of a 72-h sleep restriction period (SR; 2-h nightly sleep). A subset of participants undergoing sleep restriction received supplemental nutrients during and after sleep restriction (SR+). Wound fluid was serially sampled 48 h postblistering to assess local cytokine responses. The IL-8 response of wound fluid was higher for AS compared with SR [area-under-the-curve (log10), 5.1 ± 0.2 and 4.9 ± 0.2 pg/ml, respectively; P = 0.03]; and both IL-6 and IL-8 concentrations were higher for SR+ compared with SR ( P < 0.0001), suggestive of a potentially enhanced early wound healing response. Skin barrier recovery was shorter for AS (4.2 ± 0.9 days) compared with SR (5.0 ± 0.9 days) ( P = 0.02) but did not differ between SR and SR+ ( P = 0.18). Relatively modest sleep disruption delays wound healing. Supplemental nutrition may mitigate some decrements in local immune responses, without detectable effects on wound healing rate. NEW & NOTEWORTHY The data herein characterizes immune function in response to sleep restriction in healthy volunteers with and without nutrition supplementation. We used a unique skin wound model to show that sleep restriction delays skin barrier recovery, and nutrition supplementation attenuates decrements in local immune responses produced by sleep restriction. These findings support the beneficial effects of adequate sleep on immune function. Additional studies are necessary to characterize practical implications for populations where sleep restriction is unavoidable.",

Sleep debt is associated with maladaptive physiological changes that can lead to cardiometabolic and neuropsychiatric pathologies. Recent literature has shown the effects of sleep restriction (SR) on systemic metabolic profiles in biofluids, implying that tissue-specific metabolomes are impacted by SR. To test this hypothesis, we assessed hepatic metabolic profiles of rats after 5days of SR using UPLC-MS based metabolomics analysis and gene expression analysis. Our data suggests distinctive effects of SR on the liver metabolic profile of rats compared to forced-activity control animals. We observed specific impacts of SR on NAD metabolism through NAD accumulation and upregulation of Nampt, the rate determining step of NAD salvage. Additional multi-omic changes were observed in methionine metabolism, with an elevated SAM:SAH ratio under SR. This effect on one carbon metabolism is indicative of increased methylation potential. Changes in TCA cycle intermediates and ATP-citrate lyase (Acly) gene expression were observed that may be related to altered circulatory lipid profiles previously reported documenting the chrono-metabolic connection. Taken together with previous investigations, these observations are consistent with a model of decreased TCA activity with concomitant increase in lipogenesis induced by SR. These tissue-specific mechanistic insights into metabolic effects of SR provide a springboard to future metabolic intervention studies.",

AD patients exhibit sleep problems and alterations in the regulation of circadian rhythms; conversely, poor quality of sleep increases the risk of development of AD. The aim of the current study was to determine whether chronic sleep restriction potentiates the brain impact of amyloid-β oligomers (AβOs), toxins that build up in AD brains and are thought to underlie synapse damage and memory impairment. We further investigated whether alterations in levels of pro-inflammatory mediators could play a role in memory impairment in sleep-restricted mice. We found that a single intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) infusion of AβOs disturbed sleep pattern in mice. Conversely, chronically sleep-restricted mice exhibited higher brain expression of pro-inflammatory mediators, reductions in levels of pre- and post-synaptic marker proteins, and exhibited increased susceptibility to the impact of i.c.v. infusion of a sub-toxic dose of AβOs (1pmol) on performance in the novel object recognition memory task. Sleep-restricted mice further exhibited an increase in brain TNF-α levels in response to AβOs. Interestingly, memory impairment in sleep-restricted AβO-infused mice was prevented by treatment with the TNF-α neutralizing monoclonal antibody, infliximab. Results substantiate the notion of a dual relationship between sleep and AD, whereby AβOs disrupt sleep/wake patterns and chronic sleep restriction increases brain vulnerability to AβOs, and point to a key role of brain inflammation in increased susceptibility to AβOs in sleep-restricted mice.",

      "abstract": "Chronic sleep curtailment in humans has been related to impairment of glucose metabolism. To better understand the underlying mechanisms, the purpose of the present study was to investigate the effect of acute sleep deprivation on glucose tolerance in rats. A group of rats was challenged by 4-h sleep deprivation in the early rest period, leading to prolonged (16 h) wakefulness. Another group of rats was allowed to sleep during the first 4 h of the light period and sleep deprived in the next 4 h. During treatment, food was withdrawn to avoid a postmeal rise in plasma glucose. An intravenous glucose tolerance test (IVGTT) was performed immediately after the sleep deprivation period. Sleep deprivation at both times of the day similarly impaired glucose tolerance and reduced the early-phase insulin responses to a glucose challenge. Basal concentrations of plasma glucose, insulin, and corticosterone remained unchanged after sleep deprivation. Throughout IVGTTs, plasma corticosterone concentrations were not different between the control and sleep-deprived group. Together, these results demonstrate that independent of time of day and sleep pressure, short sleep deprivation during the resting phase favors glucose intolerance in rats by attenuating the first-phase insulin response to a glucose load. In conclusion, this study highlights the acute adverse effects of only a short sleep restriction on glucose homeostasis.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Short sleep duration is highly prevalent in adolescence, and it prospectively predicts problems with emotional adjustment and psychiatric health. To move beyond epidemiological associations and inform models of developmental psychopathology, we experimentally restricted sleep to observe impacts on affective functioning. Based on the importance of social contexts to adolescent emotional experiences, we also examined the impact of restricted sleep on socioaffective functioning in an ecologically valid peer interaction task. METHODS: In Study 1, adolescents (ages 11.5-15.0, n = 48) were randomly assigned to two nights of polysomnography-monitored sleep restriction (4 hr in bed) or extension (10 hr in bed). One week later, they completed the other sleep manipulation. Affective functioning was assessed by self-report and pupil response to standardized affective sounds. Study 2 used a similar protocol and invited adolescents (ages 12-15.0, n = 16) to the sleep laboratory along with 2-4 friends to observe affective behavior in a social context primed for peer conflict. Mixed effects models were used to evaluate the effect of sleep condition on affective outcomes. RESULTS: Study 1 demonstrated increased negative affect following sleep restriction, relative to extension, on self-report (p = .02) and pupil measures (p = .01). Study 2 replicated these effects (both p = .04) and demonstrated greater negative affective behavior in a peer social context (p = .01). Exploratory analyses for positive affect showed reductions as assessed by self-report (p = .005), but not pupil (p = .81), in Study 1; and no significant effects in Study 2 (self-report, p = .14; pupil, p = .29; positive affective behavior, p = .43). CONCLUSIONS: Experimental sleep restriction in adolescence impacts negative affective functioning as evidenced by self-report and pupil reactivity, as well as observed behavior in a social context primed for peer conflict. Implications for the impact of short sleep on developmental trajectories of emotional adjustment and psychiatric health, and opportunities for early intervention, are briefly discussed.",

Therefore, we investigated the efficacy of \"PA counseling combined with sleep restriction (SR) therapy (PASR)\" vs only SR in the patients with chronic insomnia. METHODS: Seventy-one outpatients were assigned to either PASR (n=35), consisting of four weekly PA counseling sessions based on 5A model (assess, advise, agree, assist, and arrange) + SR, or SR (n=36), consisting of four weekly SR. International Physical Activity Questionnaire (Chinese version) and pedometer-based daily steps were evaluated as the primary endpoints. Insomnia Severity Index, Epworth Sleepiness Scale, Fatigue Scale-14, and Sleep Diary were evaluated as the secondary endpoints. RESULTS: The results showed that the patients in the PASR group gained more benefits than the SR group in terms of PA level and pedometer-based daily steps (all P<0.05). Better improvements of the study group were also shown in Epworth Sleepiness Scale, Fatigue Scale-14, and Sleep efficiency (all P<0.05). CONCLUSION: We conclude that PA counseling based on 5A model combined with SR cannot only effectively increase the PA levels but also improve the sleep quality for patients with chronic insomnia."

Cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) is effective but requires more time than is available in the general practice consultation. Sleep restriction is one behavioural component of CBT-I. AIM: To assess whether simplified sleep restriction (SSR) can be effective in improving sleep in primary insomnia. DESIGN AND SETTING: Randomised controlled trial of patients in urban general practice settings in Auckland, New Zealand. METHOD: Adults with persistent primary insomnia and no mental health or significant comorbidity were eligible. Intervention patients received SSR instructions and sleep hygiene advice. Control patients received sleep hygiene advice alone. Primary outcomes included change in sleep quality at 6 months measured by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), and sleep efficiency (SE%). The proportion of participants reaching a predefined 'insomnia remission' treatment response was calculated. RESULTS: Ninety-seven patients were randomised and 94 (97%) completed the study. At 6-month follow-up, SSR participants had improved PSQI scores (6.2 versus 8.4, P<0.001), ISI scores (8.6 versus 11.1, P = 0.001), actigraphy-assessed SE% (difference 2.2%, P = 0.006), and reduced fatigue (difference -2.3 units, P = 0.04), compared with controls. SSR produced higher rates of treatment response (67% [28 out of 42] versus 41% [20 out of 49]); number needed to treat = 4 (95% CI = 2.0 to 19.0). Controlling for age, sex, and severity of insomnia, the adjusted odds ratio for insomnia remission was 2.7 (95% CI = 1.1 to 6.5). There were no significant differences in other outcomes or adverse effects. CONCLUSION: SSR is an effective brief intervention in adults with primary insomnia and no comorbidities, suitable for use in general practice.",

The current study determined whether experimental sleep restriction had an effect on experimentally induced pain and pain-elicited electroencephalographic (EEG) responses. DESIGN: A paired crossover study. INTERVENTION: Pain testing was performed after 2 nights of 50% SR and after 2 nights with habitual sleep (HS). SETTING: Laboratory experiment at research center. PARTICIPANTS: Self-reported healthy volunteers (n = 21, age range: 18-31 y). MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Brief high-density electrical stimuli to the forearm skin produced pinprick-like pain. Subjective pain ratings increased after SR, but only in response to the highest stimulus intensity (P = 0.018). SR increased the magnitude of the pain-elicited EEG response analyzed in the time-frequency domain (P = 0.021). Habituation across blocks did not differ between HS and SR. Event-related desynchronization (ERD) was reduced after SR (P = 0.039). Pressure pain threshold of the trapezius muscle region also decreased after SR (P = 0.017). CONCLUSION: Sleep restriction (SR) increased the sensitivity to pressure pain and to electrically induced pain of moderate, but not low, intensity. The increased electrical pain could not be explained by a difference in habituation. Increased response magnitude is possibly related to reduced processing within the somatosensory cortex after partial SR.",

However, how sleep restriction affects exertional heat strain and the nature of the coping strategy involved in this phenomenon remain unclear. METHODS: Fourteen healthy subjects were studied on four occasions: after a night of normal sleep (NS, 7-8 h) and after a night of partial sleep restriction (PSR, 4 h), each with or without taking a daytime nap during the subsequent experimental day. The laboratory test consisted of two 40 min periods of moderate walking in a hot room in the morning and the afternoon. RESULTS: The increase in rectal temperature during walking was significantly greater in PSR than in NS in the afternoon. The rating scores for physical and psychological fatigue and sleepiness were significantly greater in PSR than in NS, both in the morning and in the afternoon. The reaction times and lapses in the psychomotor vigilance task (PVT) after walking were significantly worse in PSR than in NS in the morning and after lunch. The nap intervention attenuated significantly the scores for fatigue and sleepiness in PSR. Furthermore, the decreased PVT response in PSR was significantly reversed by the nap. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that PSR augments physiological and psychological strain and reduces vigilance in the heat. Taking a nap seemed to be effective in reducing psychological strain and inhibiting the decrease in vigilance.",

Since its original description, sleep restriction therapy has been applied in several different ways, potentially limiting understanding of key therapeutic ingredients, mode of action, evidence synthesis, and clinical implementation. We sought to examine the quality of reporting and variability in the application of sleep restriction therapy within the context of insomnia intervention trials. Systematic literature searches revealed 88 trials of cognitive-behavioural therapy/sleep restriction therapy that met pre-defined inclusion/exclusion criteria. All papers were coded in relation to their description of sleep restriction therapy procedures. Findings indicate that a large proportion of papers (39%) do not report any details regarding sleep restriction therapy parameters and, for those papers that do, variability in implementation is present at every level (sleep window generation, minimum time-in-bed, sleep efficiency titration criteria, and positioning of sleep window). Only 7% of papers reported all parameters of sleep restriction treatment. Poor reporting and variability in the application of sleep restriction therapy may hinder progress in relation to evidence synthesis, specification of mechanistic components, and refinement of therapeutic procedures for patient benefit. We set out guidelines for the reporting of sleep restriction therapy as well as a research agenda aimed at advancing understanding of sleep restriction therapy.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Acutely restricting sleep worsens insulin sensitivity in healthy individuals whose usual sleep is normal in duration and pattern. The effect of recovery or weekend 'catch-up' sleep on insulin sensitivity and metabolically active hormones in individuals with chronic sleep restriction who regularly 'catch-up' on sleep at weekends is as yet unstudied. DESIGN: 19 men (mean ± SEM age 28·6 ± 2·0 years, BMI 26·0 ± 0·8 kg/m(2) ) with at least 6 months' history (5·1 ± 0·9 years) of lifestyle-driven, restricted sleep during the working week (373 ± 6·6 min/night) with regular weekend 'catch-up' sleep (weekend sleep extension 37·4 ± 2·3%) completed an in-laboratory, randomized, crossover study comprising two of three conditions, stratified by age. Conditions were 3 weekend nights of 10 hours, 6 hours or 10 hours time-in-bed with slow wave sleep (SWS) suppression using targeted acoustic stimuli. MEASUREMENTS: Insulin sensitivity was measured in the morning following the 3rd intervention night by minimal modelling of 19 samples collected during a 2-h oral glucose tolerance test. Glucose, insulin, c-peptide, leptin, peptide YY (PYY), ghrelin, cortisol, testosterone and luteinizing hormone (LH) were measured from daily fasting blood samples; HOMA-IR, HOMA-β and QUICKI were calculated. RESULTS: Insulin sensitivity was higher following three nights of sleep extension compared to sustained sleep restriction. Fasting insulin, c-peptide, HOMA-IR, HOMA-β, leptin and PYY decreased with 'catch-up' sleep, QUICKI and testosterone increased, while morning cortisol and LH did not change. Targeted acoustic stimuli reduced SWS by 23%, but did not alter insulin sensitivity. CONCLUSIONS: Three nights of 'catch-up' sleep improved insulin sensitivity in men with chronic, repetitive sleep restriction. Methods to improve metabolic health by optimizing sleep are plausible.",

OBJECTIVES: Despite a well-known beneficial effect of napping on alertness, its effects on neuroendocrine stress and immune responses after sleep restriction are largely unknown. DESIGN: This study was a strictly controlled (sleep-wake status, light environment, caloric intake), crossover, randomized design in continuously polysomnography-monitored subjects. SETTING: The study was conducted in a laboratory-based study. PARTICIPANTS: The subjects were 11 healthy young men. INTERVENTION: We investigated the effects on neuroendocrine and immune biomarkers of a night of sleep restricted to 2 h followed by a day without naps or with 30 minute morning and afternoon naps, both conditions followed by an ad libitum recovery night starting at 20:00. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Salivary interleukin-6 and urinary catecholamines were assessed throughout the daytime study periods. RESULTS: The increase in norepinephrine values seen at the end of the afternoon after the sleep-restricted night was not present when the subjects had the opportunity to take naps. Interleukin-6 changes observed after sleep deprivation were also normalized after napping. During the recovery day in the no-nap condition, there were increased levels of afternoon epinephrine and dopamine, which was not the case in the nap condition. A recovery night after napping was associated with a reduced amount of slow-wave sleep compared to after the no-nap condition.

Napping could be easily applied in real settings as a countermeasure to the detrimental health consequences of sleep debt.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Sleep restriction seems to change our experience of pain and reduce laser evoked potential (LEP) amplitudes. However, although LEP-habituation abnormalities have been described in painful conditions with comorbid sleep impairment, no study has previously measured the effect of sleep restriction on LEP-habituation, pain thresholds, and suprathreshold pain. METHOD: Sixteen males and seventeen females (aged 18-31years) were randomly assigned to either two nights of delayed bedtime and four hours sleep (partial sleep deprivation) or nine hours sleep. The study subjects slept at home, and the sleep was measured with actigraphy both nights and polysomnography the last night. LEP, thermal thresholds and suprathreshold pain ratings were obtained the day before and the day after intervention. The investigator was blinded. ANOVA was used to evaluate the interaction between sleep restriction and day for each pain-related variable. RESULTS: LEP-amplitude decreased after sleep restriction (interaction p=0.02) compared to subjects randomized to nine hours sleep. LEP-habituation was similar in both groups. Thenar cold pain threshold decreased after sleep restriction (interaction p=0.009). Supra-threshold heat pain rating increased temporarily 10s after stimulus onset after sleep restriction (interaction p=0.01), while it did not change after nine hours sleep. CONCLUSION: Sleep restriction reduced the CNS response to pain, while some of the subjective pain measures indicated hyperalgesia. SIGNIFICANCE: Since LEP-amplitude is known to reflect both CNS-pain-specific processing and cognitive attentive processing, our results suggest that hyperalgesia after sleep restriction might partly be caused by a reduction in cortical cognitive or perceptual mechanisms, rather than sensory amplification.",

The current study investigates whether sleep extension under real-life conditions is a feasible intervention with a beneficial impact on glucose metabolism in healthy adults who are chronically sleep restricted. DESIGN: Intervention study. PARTICIPANTS: Sixteen healthy non-obese volunteers (25 [23, 27.8] years old, 3 men). INTERVENTIONS: Two weeks of habitual time in bed followed by 6 weeks during which participants were instructed to increase their time in bed by one hour per day. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Continuous actigraphy monitoring and daily sleep logs during the entire study. Glucose and insulin were assayed on a single morning blood sample at the end of habitual time in bed and at the end of sleep extension. Home polysomnography was performed during one weekday of habitual time in bed and after 40 days of sleep extension. Sleep time during weekdays increased (mean actigraphic data: +44 ± 34 minutes, P < 0.0001; polysomnographic data: +49 ± 68 minutes, P = 0.014), without any significant change during weekends. Changes from habitual time in bed to the end of the intervention in total sleep time correlated with changes in glucose (r = +0.53, P = 0.041) and insulin levels (r = -0.60, P = 0.025), as well as with indices of insulin sensitivity (r = +0.76, P = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS: In healthy adults who are chronically sleep restricted, a simple low cost intervention such as sleep extension is feasible and is associated with improvements in fasting insulin sensitivity.",

However, the efficacy for sleep restriction therapy as a standalone intervention has yet to be comprehensively reviewed. This review evaluates the evidence for the use of sleep restriction therapy in the treatment of chronic insomnia. The literature was searched using web-based databases, finding 1344 studies. Twenty-one were accessed in full (1323 were deemed irrelevant to this review). Nine were considered relevant and evaluated in relation to study design using a standardized study checklist and levels of evidence. Four trials met adequate methodological strength to examine the efficacy of therapy for chronic insomnia. Weighted effect sizes for self-reported sleep diary measures of sleep onset latency, wake time after sleep onset, and sleep efficiency were moderate-to-large after therapy. Total sleep time indicated a small improvement. Standalone sleep restriction therapy is efficacious for the treatment of chronic insomnia for sleep diary continuity variables. Studies are insufficient to evaluate the full impact on objective sleep variables. Measures of daytime functioning in response to therapy are lacking. Variability in the sleep restriction therapy implementation methods precludes any strong conclusions regarding the true impact of therapy. A future research agenda is outlined.",

      "abstract": "STUDY OBJECTIVES: To investigate whether sleep restriction therapy (SRT) is associated with reduced objective total sleep time (TST), increased daytime somnolence, and impaired vigilance. DESIGN: Within-subject, noncontrolled treatment investigation. SETTING: Sleep research laboratory. PARTICIPANTS: Sixteen patients [10 female, mean age = 47.1 (10.8) y] with well-defined psychophysiological insomnia (PI), reporting TST ≤ 6 h. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were treated with single-component SRT over a 4-w protocol, sleeping in the laboratory for 2 nights prior to treatment initiation and for 3 nights (SRT night 1, 8, 22) during the acute interventional phase. The psychomotor vigilance task (PVT) was completed at seven defined time points [day 0 (baseline), day 1,7,8,21,22 (acute treatment) and day 84 (3 mo)]. The Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) was completed at baseline, w 1-4, and 3 mo. MEASUREMENT AND RESULTS: Subjective sleep outcomes and global insomnia severity significantly improved before and after SRT. There was, however, a robust decrease in PSG-defined TST during acute implementation of SRT, by an average of 91 min on night 1, 78 min on night 8, and 69 min on night 22, relative to baseline (P < 0.001; effect size range = 1.60-1.80). During SRT, PVT lapses were significantly increased from baseline (at three of five assessment points, all P < 0.05; effect size range = 0.69-0.78), returning to baseline levels by 3 mo (P = 0.43). A similar pattern was observed for RT, with RTs slowing during acute treatment (at four of five assessment points, all P < 0.05; effect size range = 0.57-0.89) and returning to pretreatment levels at 3 mo (P = 0.78). ESS scores were increased at w 1, 2, and 3 (relative to baseline; all P < 0.05); by 3 mo, sleepiness had returned to baseline (normative) levels (P = 0.65). CONCLUSION: For the first time we show that acute sleep restriction therapy is associated with reduced objective total sleep time, increased daytime sleepiness, and objective performance impairment. Our data have important implications for implementation guidelines around the safe and effective delivery of cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia.",

Sleep of five participants suffering from insomnia was assessed throughout the experimentation by sleep diaries and actigraphy. Ten nights of polysomnography were conducted over five occasions. The first two-night assessment served to screen for sleep disorders and to establish a baseline for dependent measures. Three assessments were undertaken across the treatment interval, with the fifth and last one coming at follow-up. Daily cortisol assays were obtained. Sleep restriction therapy was applied in-lab for the first two nights of treatment and was subsequently supervised weekly. Interrupted time series analyses were computed on sleep diary data and showed a significantly decreased wake time, increased sleep efficiency, and decreased total sleep time. Sleepiness at night seems positively related to sleep variables, polysomnography data suggest objective changes mainly for stage 2, and power spectral analysis shows a decrease in beta-1 and -2 powers for the second night of treatment. Cortisol levels seem to be lower during treatment. These preliminary results confirm part of the proposed physiological mechanisms and suggest that sleep restriction contributes to a rapid decrease in hyperarousal insomnia."

Because of drug complications and side effects such as drug dependency and resistance and decrease of sleep depth in long-term intake of sleep medication, cognitive-behavior therapy including sleep restriction therapy which does not cause these problems is more considered. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a quasi-experimental study on 38 elderly who were members of jahandidegan canter in Shiraz. The subjects were selected according to the inclusion criteria and were divided into experimental and control groups. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) was used for evaluation of sleep quality. A 4 week sleep restriction therapy was implemented for experimental group and finally both groups were compared. The data were analyzed by Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, independent and dependent t-tests in significance level of 0.05. RESULTS: Mean sleep quality decreased from 14.21 to 11.26 after the intervention in the experimental group while it was 13 before intervention and decreased to 12.78 after the intervention in the control group. Independent t-test showed a significant difference after the intervention (P = 0.038). Mean of sleep medication intake and daytime dysfunction after intervention were 0.947, 1.94 in experimental group and 0.894, 1.63 in control group respectively, which showed no significant difference (P = 0.903, P = 0.272). CONCLUSIONS: This study indicated that sleep restriction therapy can improve quality of sleep, but the amount of sleep medication intake and daytime dysfunction did not show a significant difference after intervention."

Eleven healthy adults (6M/5F; mean [SD] age: 26 [3]years; BMI 23.5 [2.3]kg/m(2)) with parental history of type 2 diabetes participated in a two-condition, two-period randomized crossover study at the Clinical Resource Center at an academic hospital. Each participant completed two 8-night inpatient sessions with restricted (5.5-h time-in-bed) vs. adequate (8.5-h time-in-bed) sleep opportunity while daily food intake and physical activity were carefully controlled. A combination of two UHPLC/MS/MS platforms and one GC/MS platform was used to measure 362 biochemicals in fasting plasma samples collected from study participants the morning after each 8-night sleep treatment. Relative concentrations of 12 amino acids and related metabolites were increased when sleep was curtailed. Sleep restriction also induced elevations in several fatty acid, bile acid, steroid hormone, and tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates. In contrast, circulating levels of glucose, some monosaccharides, gluconate, and five-carbon sugar alcohols tended to decline when sleep was reduced. Recurrent sleep curtailment affected multiple pathways of intermediary metabolism in adults at risk for type 2 diabetes. An elevation in plasma amino acids and related biochemicals was the most pronounced metabolic signature seen in response to 8 nights of sleep restriction.",

      "abstract": "Epidemiologic studies have consistently shown that sleeping <7 h and ≥8 h is associated with increased mortality and morbidity. The risks of short sleep may be consistent with results from experimental sleep deprivation studies. However, there has been little study of chronic moderate sleep restriction and little evaluation of older adults who might be more vulnerable to negative effects of sleep restriction, given their age-related morbidities. Moreover, the risks of long sleep have scarcely been examined experimentally. Moderate sleep restriction might benefit older long sleepers who often spend excessive time in bed (TIB) in contrast to older adults with average sleep patterns. Our aims are: (1) to examine the ability of older long sleepers and older average sleepers to adhere to 60 min TIB restriction; and (2) to contrast effects of chronic TIB restriction in older long vs. average sleepers. Older adults (n = 100) (60-80 years) who sleep 8-9 h per night and 100 older adults who sleep 6-7.25 h per night will be examined at 4 sites over 5 years. Following a 2-week baseline, participants will be randomized to one of two 12-week treatments: (1) a sleep restriction involving a fixed sleep-wake schedule, in which TIB is reduced 60 min below each participant's baseline TIB; and (2) a control treatment involving no sleep restriction, but a fixed sleep schedule. Sleep will be assessed with actigraphy and a diary. Measures will include glucose tolerance, sleepiness, depressive symptoms, quality of life, cognitive performance, incidence of illness or accident, and inflammation.",

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine whether there is a neural system that is preferentially activated in response to unhealthy compared with healthy foods. PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-five normal-weight individuals, who normally slept 7-9 h per night, completed both phases of this randomized controlled study. INTERVENTION: Each participant was tested after a period of five nights of either 4 or 9 h in bed. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was performed in the fasted state, presenting healthy and unhealthy food stimuli and objects in a block design. Neuronal responses to unhealthy, relative to healthy food stimuli after each sleep period were assessed and compared. RESULTS: After a period of restricted sleep, viewing unhealthy foods led to greater activation in the superior and middle temporal gyri, middle and superior frontal gyri, left inferior parietal lobule, orbitofrontal cortex, and right insula compared with healthy foods. These same stimuli presented after a period of habitual sleep did not produce marked activity patterns specific to unhealthy foods. Further, food intake during restricted sleep increased in association with a relative decrease in brain oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) activity observed in the right insula. CONCLUSION: This inverse relationship between insula activity and food intake and enhanced activation in brain reward and food-sensitive centers in response to unhealthy foods provides a model of neuronal mechanisms relating short sleep duration to obesity.",

      "abstract": "Substance abuse and sleep deprivation are major problems in our society. Clinical studies suggest that measures of poor sleep quality effectively predict relapse to substance abuse. Previously, our laboratory has shown that acute sleep deprivation increases the rate and efficiency (i.e., the goal-directed nature of responding) of cocaine self-administration using a progressive ratio (PR) schedule of reinforcement. However, the problem of sleep deprivation in our nation is largely one of chronicity. Therefore, the current study used a rodent model of chronic sleep restriction more akin to that experienced by humans (approximately 25% reduction in baseline sleep over the course of 8 days) to assess the impact of chronic sleep deprivation on cocaine-seeking and cocaine-taking behaviors in rats early during acquisition of self-administration. While low drug-taking rats were unaffected by chronic sleep restriction, high drug-takers in the chronic sleep restriction (CSR) group exhibited enhanced fixed ratio (FR) responding by the fourth day of FR training and significantly higher PR breakpoints than their non-sleep restriction (NSR) counterparts. This study is the first to directly assess the impact of chronic sleep deprivation on drug self-administration. These results show that chronic sleep deprivation early during acquisition of self-administration has a significant effect on the perceived incentive reward value of cocaine in high drug-takers, as indicated by both increased FR responding and an increased willingness to work for drug. Thus, it is important to be mindful of such factors in clinical settings designed for treatment of addiction and relapse prevention.",

      "abstract": "This study profiles changes in self-reported daytime functioning during sleep restriction therapy (SRT) for insomnia. Ecological momentary assessment (EMA) captured point-in-time symptomatology to map the time-course of symptoms. We hypothesized a deterioration (week 1) followed by improvements at week 3 of therapy relative to baseline. Nine patients with psychophysiological insomnia completed the Daytime Insomnia Symptom Scale (DISS) at rise-time, 12:00 hours, 18:00 hours and bedtime for 1 week before and 3 weeks during SRT. Four validated factors from the DISS were analyzed (alert cognition, positive mood, negative mood and sleepiness/fatigue) across 28 days yielding 17 170 data points. Factors evaluated week (baseline versus weeks 1 and 3) and time of day symptomatology. Insomnia Severity Index scores decreased significantly pre-to-post treatment (mean 18 versus 7). Reflecting acute effects of SRT, significant differences were found for all factors, except negative mood, between baseline and week 1 of SRT, suggesting adverse effects. By week 3, sleepiness/fatigue and negative mood decreased significantly compared to baseline, and positive mood showed a trend towards improvement (P = 0.06). Sleepiness/fatigue displayed a significant week × time of day interaction, explained by a reduction in sleepiness/fatigue at every daytime assessment point (except bedtime, which remained high). A significant interaction for alert cognition was associated with reduction in alertness at bedtime by week 3 and an increase in alertness at rise-time, suggesting that SRT not only improves sleep, but moderates alertness and sleepiness in therapeutic ways. Initial SRT is associated with an increase in sleepiness/fatigue and a decrease in alert cognition.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Insufficient sleep increases the risk for insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, and obesity, suggesting that sleep restriction may impair peripheral metabolic pathways. Yet, a direct link between sleep restriction and alterations in molecular metabolic pathways in any peripheral human tissue has not been shown. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether sleep restriction results in reduced insulin sensitivity in subcutaneous fat, a peripheral tissue that plays a pivotal role in energy metabolism and balance. DESIGN: Randomized, 2-period, 2-condition, crossover clinical study. SETTING: University of Chicago Clinical Resource Center. PARTICIPANTS: Seven healthy adults (1 woman, 6 men) with a mean age of 23.7 years (SD, 3.8) and mean body mass index of 22.8 kg/m(2) (SD, 1.6). INTERVENTION: Four days of 4.5 hours in bed or 8.5 hours in bed under controlled conditions of caloric intake and physical activity. MEASUREMENTS: Adipocytes collected from subcutaneous fat biopsy samples after normal and restricted sleep conditions were exposed to incremental insulin concentrations. The ability of insulin to increase levels of phosphorylated Akt (pAkt), a crucial step in the insulin-signaling pathway, was assessed. Total Akt (tAkt) served as a loading control. The insulin concentration for the half-maximal stimulation of the pAkt-tAkt ratio was used as a measure of cellular insulin sensitivity. Total body insulin sensitivity was assessed using a frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test. RESULTS: The insulin concentration for the half-maximal pAkt-tAkt response was nearly 3-fold higher (mean, 0.71 nM [SD, 0.27] vs. 0.24 nM [SD, 0.24]; P = 0.01; mean difference, 0.47 nM [SD, 0.33]; P = 0.01), and the total area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve of the pAkt-tAkt response was 30% lower (P = 0.01) during sleep restriction than during normal sleep. A reduction in total body insulin sensitivity (P = 0.02) paralleled this impaired cellular insulin sensitivity. LIMITATION: This was a single-center study with a small sample size. CONCLUSION: Sleep restriction results in an insulin-resistant state in human adipocytes. Sleep may be an important regulator of energy metabolism in peripheral tissues.

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Evidence for a causal relationship between sleep-loss and metabolism is derived primarily from short-term sleep deprivation studies in the laboratory. The objective of this study was to investigate whether small changes in sleep duration over a three week period while participants are living in their normal environment lead to changes in insulin sensitivity and other metabolic parameters. METHODS: Nineteen healthy, young, normal-weight men were randomised to either sleep restriction (habitual bedtime minus 1.5h) or a control condition (habitual bedtime) for three weeks. Weekly assessments of insulin sensitivity by hyperinsulinaemic-euglycaemic clamp, anthropometry, vascular function, leptin and adiponectin were made. Sleep was assessed continuously using actigraphy and diaries. RESULTS: Assessment of sleep by actigraphy confirmed that the intervention reduced daily sleep duration by 01:19 ± 00:15 (SE; p<0.001). Sleep restriction led to changes in insulin sensitivity, body weight and plasma concentrations of leptin which varied during the three week period. There was no effect on plasma adiponectin or vascular function. CONCLUSIONS: Even minor reductions in sleep duration lead to changes in insulin sensitivity, body weight and other metabolic parameters which vary during the exposure period. Larger and longer longitudinal studies of sleep restriction and sleep extension are warranted.",

      "abstract": "Insufficient sleep is associated with changes in glucose tolerance, insulin secretion, and insulin action. Despite widespread use of weight-loss diets for metabolic risk reduction, the effects of insufficient sleep on glucose regulation in overweight dieters are not known. To examine the consequences of recurrent sleep restriction on 24-h blood glucose control during diet-induced weight loss, 10 overweight and obese adults (3F/7M; mean (s.d.) age 41 (5) years; BMI 27.4 (2.0) kg/m(2)) completed two 14-day treatments with hypocaloric diet and 8.5- or 5.5-h nighttime sleep opportunity in random order 7 (3) months apart. Oral and intravenous glucose tolerance test (IVGTT) data, fasting lipids and free fatty acids (FFA), 24-h blood glucose, insulin, C-peptide, and counter-regulatory hormone measurements were collected after each treatment. Participants had comparable weight loss (1.0 (0.3) BMI units) during each treatment. Bedtime restriction reduced sleep by 131 (30) min/day. Recurrent sleep curtailment decreased 24-h serum insulin concentrations (i.e., enhanced 24-h insulin economy) without changes in oral glucose tolerance and 24-h glucose control. This was accompanied by a decline in fasting blood glucose, increased fasting FFA, which suppressed normally following glucose ingestion, and lower total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations. Sleep-loss-related changes in counter-regulatory hormone secretion during the IVGTT limited the utility of the test in this study. In conclusion, sleep restriction enhanced 24-h insulin economy without compromising glucose homeostasis in overweight individuals placed on a balanced hypocaloric diet. The changes in fasting blood glucose, insulin, lipid and FFA concentrations in sleep-restricted dieters resembled the pattern of human metabolic adaptation to reduced carbohydrate availability.",
