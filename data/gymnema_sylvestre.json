      "abstract": "This study evaluates the antimicrobial activity of the glycolic extract of G. sylvestre against anaerobic pathogens, along with its cytotoxicity, genotoxicity, anti-inflammatory activity, antioxidant effects, and phytochemical composition. Phytochemical analysis was conducted using high-performance liquid chromatography and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, while the antioxidant effect was assessed through a DPPH assay. Antimicrobial action was tested on planktonic cultures and biofilms of Porphyromonas gingivalis, Porphyromonas endodontalis, Parvimonas micra, and Fusobacterium nucleatum. Cytotoxicity was evaluated using mouse macrophages (RAW 264.7), rat fibroblasts (L929), and human keratinocytes (HaCaT). Anti-inflammatory effects were measured by an immunoenzymatic assay (ELISA) on RAW 264.7 cells. Statistical analysis was performed using a one-way ANOVA and Tukey's test. Phytochemical analysis revealed the presence of phenolic compounds and flavonoids. The extract demonstrated a reduction of over 95% in biofilms of P. gingivalis, P. micra, and F. nucleatum within 5 min of treatment. Cell viability (HaCaT) remained above 80%. Antioxidant activity showed an EC50 of 353.43 µg/mL, achieving a 50% reduction in free radicals. A significant decrease in TNF-α (a pro-inflammatory cytokine) and an increase in IL-10 (an anti-inflammatory cytokine) were observed. In conclusion, the extract of G. sylvestre exhibits promising potential as a therapeutic agent for treating anaerobic infections, inflammation, and oxidative stress."

This randomised crossover study aimed to investigate whether supplemental GS use can reduce sugar cravings, sweet food desire and consumption among adults that identify as high sweet food consumers (having a 'sweet tooth'). Participants were told three different mints were trialled to avoid bias. On day zero, 32 healthy participants underwent baseline sensory testing for sweet taste perception using the placebo mint (PLAC). Participants were then randomised into the two intervention groups. On day 15 and 30, participants underwent further sensory testing using the GS mints, before embarking on each 14-day intervention using the GS mints, using either a systematic (at 3 specified times/day; SYS) or ad libitum (up to 6 mints/day at times of their choosing; AD-LIB) regimen, as assigned. On day 30, participants swapped over to the other intervention (using the other regimen), completing final data collection in day 45. At all visits participants completed questionnaires (food frequency questionnaire, beverage questionnaire and cravings questionnaire), anthropometric measures, and sensory testing. Sensory testing was not required for day 45. The AD-LIB condition reduced daily sugar-sweetened beverages (SSB) intake by 42% relative to PLAC (p = 0.015) and reduced overall sugar cravings by 28% relative to PLAC (p = 0.045). Both AD-LIB and SYS reduced pleasantness ratings (p < 0.005) and desire (p = 0.005) for more chocolate. Using GS with an ad libitum regimen reduced sugar cravings and changed sweet food desire and consumption in people identifying as having a sweet tooth.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) derived from natural sources have garnered significant attention due to their unique properties and eco-friendly production methods. With lung cancer remaining a major global health issue, there is a continuous need for novel and effective therapeutic approaches beyond conventional treatments such as chemotherapy, immunotherapy, and targeted therapies. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to synthesize AgNPs using plant extracts from Gymnema sylvestre, Moringa oleifera, and Azadirachta indica and to evaluate their anticancer activity, particularly their effects on gene expression in A549 lung cancer cells. METHODS: AgNPs were synthesized using green chemistry techniques and characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). Gene expression studies were performed to assess the impact of AgNPs on cancer-related genes such as VEGF and CYCLIN-D1. Cytotoxicity assays were conducted on A549 cells to determine the anticancer potential of the synthesized AgNPs compared to plant extracts alone. RESULTS: XRD confirmed the formation of crystalline AgNPs, while FTIR indicated the presence of bioactive compounds interacting with the nanoparticles. Gene expression analysis revealed significant downregulation of VEGF and CYCLIN-D1, suggesting inhibitory effects on angiogenesis and cell cycle progression. The synthesized AgNPs exhibited potent cytotoxic activity against A549 cells, with enhanced efficacy compared to the leaf extracts alone. CONCLUSION: The study highlights the potential of AgNPs synthesized from medicinal plant extracts as promising candidates for lung cancer therapy. Their environmentally sustainable production, combined with their ability to target key cancer pathways, positions them as innovative and affordable therapeutic agents in the field of nanomedicine.",

      "abstract": "The study comprehensively investigated the therapeutic potential of Gymnema sylvestre triterpenoid saponin extract (GST), encompassing its hepatoprotective, immunomodulatory, and anticancer activities. The study employed a Prednisolone (PRD)-induced immunosuppressed rat model to assess the hepatoprotective and immunomodulatory effects of GST. Using this model, GST was found to modulate haematopoiesis, improving RBC, platelet, and WBC counts, underscoring its potential in hematopoietic homeostasis. Organ atrophy, a hallmark of immunosuppression in spleen, thymus, liver, and kidneys, was reversed with GST treatment, reinforcing its hepatotrophic and organotropic capabilities. Elevated hepatic biomarkers, including alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and lipid peroxidase (LPO), indicative of hepatocellular injury and oxidative stress, were reduced with GST, underscoring its hepatoprotective and antioxidative effects. Additionally, GST restored depleted antioxidants glutathione (GSH) and superoxide dismutase (SOD), highlighting its strong antioxidative capabilities. Molecular insights revealed a downregulation of interleukin-2 (IL-2) and interleukin-4 (IL-4) mRNA in the spleen of immunosuppressed rats, while GST treatment significantly upregulated IL-2 and IL-4 mRNA expression, showcasing its immunomodulatory potential. Increased levels of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) associated with immune dysregulation were effectively decreased by GST, underscoring its role in modulating inflammatory responses and restoring immune balance. Molecular docking studies indicated strong inhibition of TNF-α by GST compounds. In terms of anticancer activity, GST demonstrated significant cytotoxicity against MCF-7, and MDA-MB-231 (breast cancer cell lines). Notably, GST demonstrated biocompatibility with normal CHO (Chinese hamster ovary cell line) and HUVEC (Human umbilical vein endothelial cells) cell lines. Molecular docking studies indicated strong inhibition of breast cancer proteins HER1 and HER2 (human epidermal growth factor receptors) by GST compounds. Additionally, pharmacokinetics, bioavailability, drug-likeness, and toxicity risk predictions suggest that GST compounds are pharmacologically favourable with no adverse effects."

      "abstract": "A study on 81 individuals (18-75 years old) with mildly impaired fasting blood glucose (FBG) concentrations (98-125 mg/dL) was undertaken to investigate the tolerability of a food supplement (FS) based on Zea mays and Gymnema sylvestre extracts, zinc, and chromium and its efficacy on glucose and lipid metabolism. The subjects were randomized into three groups (27 in each group) and supplemented with one or two tablet(s)/day of FS (groups 1 and 2, respectively), or two tablets/day of placebo (group 3). Blood sampling was carried out at baseline (t0) and after a 3-month treatment (t1), and biochemical parameters associated with glucose and lipid metabolism and kidney and liver toxicity were evaluated. Compared to the placebo, FBG and glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) were significantly (p < 0.001) reduced in group 1 subjects. In contrast, at the doses of one and two tablet(s)/day, the FS exerted no effect on the other parameters examined. We conclude that in subjects with slightly impaired FBG, ingestion of a FS based on Z. mays and G. sylvestre extracts, zinc, and chromium over 3 months lowers FBG and modulates glucose homeostasis by improving glucose metabolism. These beneficial effects occur in the absence of biochemical evidence of kidney and liver toxicity.",

Although their anti-obesogenic and antidiabetic properties have been widely studied, comparative research on their impact on the gene expression of adipokines, such as resistin (Res), omentin (Ome), visfatin (Vis) and apelin (Ap), has not been reported. METHODOLOGY: We performed a comparative study in 50 adult Mexican patients with obesity treated with GS or BBR for 3 months. The baseline and final biochemical parameters, body composition, blood pressure, gene expression of Res, Ome, Vis, and Ap, and safety parameters were evaluated. RESULTS: BBR significantly decreased (p < 0.05) body weight, blood pressure and Vis and Ap gene expression and increased Ome, while GS decreased fasting glucose and Res gene expression (p < 0.05). A comparative analysis of the final measurements revealed a lower gene expression of Ap and Vis (p < 0.05) in patients treated with BBR than in those treated with GS. The most frequent adverse effects in both groups were gastrointestinal symptoms, which attenuated during the first month of treatment. CONCLUSION: In patients with obesity, BBR has a better effect on body composition, blood pressure, and the gene expression of adipokines related to metabolic risk, while GS has a better effect on fasting glucose and adipokines related to insulin resistance, with minimal side effects.",

      "abstract": "The increasing incidence of breast cancer and bacterial biofilm in medical devices significantly heightens global mortality and morbidity, challenging synthetic drugs. Consequently, greener-synthesized nanomaterials have emerged as a versatile alternative for various biomedical applications, offering new therapeutic avenues. This study explores the synthesis of biocompatible zinc oxide (ZnONPs) nanoparticles using Gymnema sylvestre and its antibacterial, antibiofilm, and cytotoxic properties. Characterization of ZnONPs inferred that UV-Vis spectra exhibited a sharp peak at 370 nm. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopical analysis revealed the presence of active functional groups such as aldehyde, alkyne, cyclic alkene, sulfate, alkyl aryl ether, and Zn-O bonds. X-ray diffraction analysis results confirmed the crystalline nature of the nanoparticle. Scanning electron microscope analysis evidenced hexagonal morphology, and energy-dispersive X-ray analysis confirmed zinc content. High-resolution transmission electron microscope analysis showed hexagonal and rod-shaped ZnONPs with a size of 5 nm. Zeta potential results affirmed the stability of nanoparticles. The ZnONPs effectively inhibited gram-positive (18-20 mm) than gram-negative (12-18 mm) bacterial pathogens with lower bacteriostatic and higher bactericidal values. Biofilm inhibitory property inferred ZnONPs were more effective against gram-positive (38-94%) than gram-negative bacteria (27-86%). The concentration of ZnONPs to exert 50% biofilm-inhibitory is lower against gram-positive bacteria (179.26-203.95 μg/mL) than gram-negative bacteria (201.46-236.19 μg/mL). Microscopic visualization inferred that at 250 μg/mL, ZnONPs strongly disrupted biofilm formation, as evidenced by decreased biofilm density and altered architecture. The cytotoxicity of ZnONPs against breast cancer cells showed a dose-dependent reduction in cell viability with an IC50 value of 19.4 µg/mL. AO/EB staining indicated early and late apoptotic cell death of breast cancer cells under fluorescence microscopy. The results of hemolytic activity validated the biocompatibility of the ZnONPs. Thus, the unique properties of the green-synthesized ZnONPs suggest their potential as effective drug carriers for targeted delivery in cancer therapy and the treatment of biofilm-related infections.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Folk medicines are attractive therapeutic agents for treating type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Most plant extracts that have been suggested to restore β-cells function were tested in vivo. Some only have been tested in vitro to determine whether they have a direct effect on β-cells islets of Langerhans. Currently, there are no defined criteria for screening of β-cell-directed plant-based remedies as potential antidiabetic agents. SUMMARY: In this review, we have identified certain criteria/characteristics that can be used to generate a \"screening portfolio\" to identify plant extracts as potential β-cell-directed agents for the treatment of T2DM. To validate our screening method, we studied the potential therapeutic efficacy of a Gymnema sylvestre (GS) extract using the screening criteria detailed in the review. Six criteria have been identified and validated using OSA®, a GS extract. By using this screening method, we show that OSA® fulfilled most of the criteria identified for an effective β-cell-directed antidiabetic therapy, being an effective insulin-releasing agent at nontoxic concentrations; maintaining β-cell insulin content by stimulating a concomitant increase in insulin gene transcription; maintaining β-cell mass by protecting against apoptosis; and being effective at maintaining normoglycemia in vivo in a mouse model and a human cohort with T2DM. KEY MESSAGES: The present review has highlighted the importance of having a screening portfolio for plant extracts that have potential antidiabetic effects in the treatment of T2DM. We propose that this screening method should be adopted for future studies to identify new β-cell-directed antidiabetic plant derived agents.",

      "abstract": "The cotton mealybug, Phenacoccus solenopsis Tinsley and papaya mealybug, Paracoccus marginatus Williams and Granara de Willink (Hemiptera: Pseudococcidae) are becoming major threats to the production of Gymnema sylvestre R. Br. (Asclepiadaceae) in India. Management mainly depends on chemical insecticides which cause a serious problem of pesticide residue and insecticide resistance. The use of biorational insecticides such as biopesticides, botanicals, insect growth regulators, and microbial insecticides is important components of an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) program for successful management. We evaluated the bio-efficacy of twelve biorational insecticides, including entomopathogenic fungi (EPF), using the leaf spray method in laboratory conditions at 25 ± 1 °C, 70 % ± 5 % RH. The results revealed that the highest percent mortality was recorded by acetamiprid 20 % SP (100.00 %), followed by azadirachtin (98.27 %), Lecanicillium muscarium (2 × 109 spores/mL) (85.70 %) and Ocimum sanctum leaf extract (76.87 %) at 120 h after treatment (HAT) in P. solenopsis. In P. marginatus, 100.00 %, 96.39 % and 85.67 % and 74.90 % mortalities were achieved by acetamiprid 20 % SP, azadirachtin, L. muscarium (2 × 109 spores/mL) and O. sanctum leaf extract, respectively, at 120 HAT during the first spray. Various biorational insecticides showed a more or less similar trend of percent mortality in both species during the second spray. In both species, the lowest percent mortality was recorded by Andrographis paniculata leaf extract (46.29, 44.54) and (41.03, 46.39) at 120 Hours after treatment in the first and second spray, respectively. It was concluded that all the prescribed treatments are more effective than the control. Overall, azadirachtin recorded the highest percent mortality after acetamiprid and had the shortest LT50 (12.52 h) and (13.87 h) values in P. solenopsis and P. marginatus, respectively. Our study emphasizes that biopesticides like Azadirachtin 1 % EC (10000 ppm), L. muscarium (2 × 109 spores/mL) (5 mL/L) and O. sanctum leaf extract (5 %) may be recommended as alternatives to synthetic insecticides. Botanicals and EPF would be the most effective approach for sustainable integrated management of P. solenopsis and P. marginatus in the G. sylvestre ecosystem."

      "abstract": "Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is characterized by high blood glucose levels and lipid alterations. Besides pharmacological treatment, lifestyle modifications and nutraceuticals can be used to manage glucose and lipid profiles, which is crucial for preventing, or avoiding, serious consequences associated with the condition. This randomized controlled clinical trial on 75 patients with T2DM evaluated the effects of a combination of myo-inositol and d-chiro-inositol (40:1), α-lactalbumin, Gymnema sylvestre, and zinc on glucose and lipid profile. The intention-to-treat analysis displayed no significant differences in glucose parameters between the groups; however, the study group displayed reduced levels of total cholesterol (p = 0.01) and LDL (p = 0.03) after 3 months of supplementation. A subgroup analysis involving patients who did not modify their antidiabetic therapy, after 6 months displayed improved levels of total cholesterol (p = 0.03) and LDL (p = 0.04) in the study group versus placebo, along with a greater body weight reduction (p = 0.03) after 3 months. Furthermore, within the study group, levels of HDL (p = 0.03) and triglycerides (p = 0.04) improved after 3 months. These findings support supplementation with myo-inositol and d-chiro-inositol (40:1), α-lactalbumin, Gymnema sylvestre, and zinc as an adjuvant and safe strategy to manage the lipid profiles of patients with T2DM."

      "abstract": "The primary control of dysmetabolic patients is extremely challenging worldwide, with inadequate dietary habits and sporadic physical activity among the key risk factors for metabolic syndrome onset. Nowadays, there is no exclusive treatment for this condition, and considering that preventive measures usually fail, new therapeutic approaches need to be proposed and investigated. This present pilot study compared the effects of diet alone and in association with a combination of myo-inositol and d-chiro-inositol in their 40:1 ratio, α-lactalbumin, and Gymnema sylvestre on different metabolic parameters in obese dysmetabolic patients. To this purpose, 37 patients with BMI between 30 and 40 and fasting blood glucose between 100 and 125 mg/dL were divided into two groups: (i) the control group followed a hypocaloric Mediterranean diet, (ii) while the study group was also supplemented with a daily dosage of two sachets, each one containing 1950 mg myo-inositol, 50 mg d-chiro-inositol, 50 mg α-lactalbumin, and 250 mg Gymnema Sylvestre. After a 6-month treatment, all parameters improved in both groups. Nevertheless, the treated group experienced a greater improvement, especially concerning the variation from the baseline of HOMA index, triglycerides, BMI, body weight, and waist circumference. These findings support the supplementation with myo-inositol and d-chiro-inositol in the 40:1 ratio, α-lactalbumin, and Gymnema sylvestre as a therapeutical strategy to potentiate the beneficial effects induced via dietary programs in dysmetabolic patients.",

      "abstract": "Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) have gained importance in the field of biomedical research and diagnostics due to their unique physicochemical properties. This study aimed to synthesize AuNPs using Aloe vera extract, honey, and Gymnema sylvestre leaf extract. Physicochemical parameters for the optimal synthesis of AuNPs were determined using 0.5, 1, 2, and 3 mM of gold salt at varying temperatures from 20 to 50 °C. X-ray diffraction was used to evaluate the crystal structure of AuNPs, which came out to be a face-centered cubic structure. Scanning electron microscopy and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy analysis confirmed the size and shape of AuNPs between 20 and 50 nm from the Aloe vera, honey, and Gymnema sylvestre, as well as large-sized nanocubes in the case of honey, with 21-34 wt % of gold content. Furthermore, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy confirmed the presence of a broadband of amine (N-H) and alcohol groups (O-H) on the surface of the synthesized AuNPs that prevents them from agglomeration and provides stability. Broad and weak bands of aliphatic ether (C-O), alkane (C-H), and other functional groups were also found on these AuNPs. DPPH antioxidant activity assay showed a high free radical scavenging potential. The most suited source was selected for further conjugation with three anticancer drugs including 4-hydroxy Tamoxifen, HIF1 alpha inhibitor, and the soluble Guanylyl Cyclase Inhibitor 1 H-[1,2,4] oxadiazolo [4,3-alpha]quinoxalin-1-one (ODQ). Evidence of the pegylated drug conjugation with AuNPs was reinforced by ultraviolet/visible spectroscopy. These drug-conjugated nanoparticles were further checked on MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 cells for their cytotoxicity. These AuNP-conjugated drugs can be a good candidate for breast cancer treatment that will lead toward safe, economical, biocompatible, and targeted drug delivery systems."

GS has been used as a medicinal plant with potential anti-microbial, anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant properties. This study was conceptualized to evaluate the cytotoxicity potential of Gymnema sylvestre saponin rich fraction (GSSRF) on breast cancer cell lines (MCF-7 and MDA-MB-468) by SRB assay. The anti-tumor activity of GSSRF was assessed in tumor-bearing Elrich ascites carcinoma (EAC) and Dalton's lymphoma ascites (DLA) mouse models. The anti-oxidant potential of GSSRF was assessed by DPPH radical scavenging assay. The acute toxicity of GSSRF was carried out according to OECD guideline 425. The yield of GSSRF was around 1.4% and the presence of saponin content in GSSRF was confirmed by qualitative and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopic (FTIR) analysis. The in vitro cytotoxic effects of GSSRF on breast cancer cell lines were promising and found to be dose-dependent. An acute toxicity study of GSSRF was found to be safe at 2000 mg/kg body weight. GSSRF treatment has shown a significant increase in the body weight and the life span of EAC-bearing mice in a dose-dependent manner when compared with the control group. In the solid tumor model, the doses of 100 and 200 mg/kg body weight per day have shown about 46.70% and 60.80% reduction in tumor weight and controlled the tumor weight until the 30th day when compared with the control group. The activity of GSSRF in both models was similar to the cisplatin, a standard anticancer agent used in the study. Together, these results open the door for detailed investigations of anti-tumor potentials of GSSRF in specific tumor models, mechanistic studies and clinical trials leading to promising novel therapeutics for cancer therapy."

      "abstract": "Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is one of the major causes of mortality in COVID-19 patients, due to limited therapeutic options. This prompted us to explore natural sources to mitigate this condition. Gymnema Sylvestre (GS) is an ancient medicinal plant known to have various therapeutic effects. This investigation examined the therapeutic effect of hydroalcoholic extract of Gymnema Sylvestre (HAEGS) against lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced lung injury and ARDS in in vitro and in vivo models. UHPLC-HRMS/GC-MS was employed for characterizing the HAEGS and identified several active derivatives including gymnemic acid, gymnemasaponins, gymnemoside, gymnemasin, quercetin, and long fatty acids. Gene expression by RT-qPCR and DCFDA analysis by flow cytometry revealed that several inflammatory cytokine/chemokine, cell injury markers, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels were highly upregulated in LPS control and were significantly reduced upon HAEGS treatment. Consistent with the in vitro studies, we found that in LPS-induced ARDS model, pre-treatment with HAEGS significantly suppressed the LPS-induced elevation of inflammatory cell infiltrations, cytokine/chemokine marker expression, ROS levels, and lung injury in a dose-dependent manner. Further mechanistic studies demonstrated that HAEGS suppressed oxidative stress by modulating the NRF2 pathway and ameliorated the ARDS through the NF-κB/MAPK signalling pathway. Additional fractionation results revealed that fraction 6 which has the exclusive composition of gymnemic acid derivatives showed better anti-inflammatory effects (inhibition of IL-6 and IL-1β) at lower concentrations compared to HAEGS. Overall, HAEGS significantly mitigated LPS-induced lung injury and ARDS by targeting the NF-κB/MAPK signalling pathway. Thus, our work unravels the protective role of HAEGS for the first time in managing ARDS.",

      "abstract": "Gymnemic-acids (GA) block lingual sweet taste receptors, thereby reducing pleasantness and intake of sweet food. Objective: To examine whether a 14-day gymnema-based intervention can reduce sweet foods and discretionary sugar intake in free-living adults. Healthy adults (n = 58) were randomly allocated to either the intervention group (INT) or control group (CON). The intervention comprised of consuming 4 mg of Gymnema sylvestre containing 75% gymnema acids, a fibre and vitamin supplement, and an associated healthy-eating guide for 14 days; participants in the CON group followed the same protocol, replacing the GA with a placebo mint. Amount of chocolate bars eaten and sensory testing were conducted before and after the 14-day intervention (post-GA or placebo dosing on days zero and 15, respectively). Food frequency questionnaires were conducted on days zero, 15 and after a 28-day maintenance period to examine any changes in intake of sweet foods. A range of statistical procedures were used to analyse the data including Chi square, t-test and two-way analysis of variance. Post dosing, INT consumed fewer chocolates (2.65 ± 0.21 bars) at day zero than CON (3.15 ± 0.24 bars; p = 0.02); there were no differences between groups at day 15 (INT = 2.77 ± 0.22 bars; CON = 2.78 ± 0.22 bars; p = 0.81). At both visits, a small substantive effect (r < 0.3) was observed in the change in pleasantness and desire ratings, with INT showing a slight increase while CON showed a small decrease over the 14-day period. No differences were found in the intake of 9 food categories between groups at any timepoint. There were no differences in consumption of low sugar healthy foods between visits, or by group. The 14-day behavioural intervention reduced pleasantness and intake of chocolate in a laboratory setting. There was no habituation to the mint over the 14-day period. This study is the first to investigate the effect of longer-term gymnema acid consumption on sweet food consumption outside of a laboratory setting; further research is needed to assess how long the effect of the 14-day intervention persists.",

The current therapy is associated with the drawbacks of addiction and repeated administration. METHOD: The sustained release PNPs were developed and evaluated for toxicity. PNPs of GYM were prepared by double emulsion solvent evaporation technique utilising Taguchi model and evaluated for physicochemical properties (particle size, zeta potential, entrapment efficiency), in vitro drug release, compatibility, and stability. Further, the bioavailability and in vivo nephrotoxicity studies in diabetic rat model were also carried out. RESULT: The developed optimised nanoparticles were 205.7 ± 1.20 nm in size, -40.68 mV zeta potential, compatible, and stable in nature with improved entrapment efficiency (67.1 ± 0.2%) and sustained release. Moreover, nanoparticles were found to lower the blood glucose level in single as well as multiple doses. Results of in vivo study indicated that GYM-NPs increased the phosphorylase activity and thus enhanced insulin secretion. Furthermore, the nanoparticles were free from toxicity, which was confirmed by the estimation of kidney biomarker. CONCLUSION: The nanoparticles increased the bioavailability of GYM extract and have a great potential for the treatment of diabetes in reduced dose, and so these can be potential candidates for treating diabetes.",

      "abstract": "UNLABELLED: Diabetes is a metabolic disorder which is characterised by high levels of blood glucose. Most of the oral drugs available today for the treatment of diabetes are associated with various side-effects. Herbal medicines are considered relatively safer alternatives and Gymnema sylvestre (GS) is one such known traditional medicinal plant widely used for the treatment of diabetes. In our previous work, we isolated active triterpene glycosides (TG) from Gymnema sylvestre (GS) and screened for yeast α-glucosidase inhibitory activity in vitro. The present study aims to use in silico techniques to understand and predict the inhibitory role of the isolated triterpene glycosides (TG); Gymnemic acid I, IV, VII and gymnemagenin against disaccharidase enzymes. enzyme kinetic analysis using Lineweaver-Burk plot indicated that TG competitively inhibited yeast α-glucosidase at IC50 concentration with Ki 0.0028 μM. TG also exhibited significant inhibitory activity against mammalian sucrase and maltase respectively, compared to control. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: The molecular docking simulation reveals that TG is capable of docking well with crystallographic structures of the selected enzyme targets. Inhibition of α-glucosidases could delay the absorption of glucose in the blood during post-meal digestion. Thus the current study highlights the dietary intervention of TG towards the selected enzyme targets, thus making TG a potential nutraceutical candidate towards management of blood glucose."

To discover the potential bioactive composition of G. sylvestre, a chemical investigation was thus performed. In this research, four new C21 steroidal glycosides sylvepregosides A-D (1-4) were isolated along with four known compounds, gymnepregoside H (5), deacetylkidjoladinin (6), gymnepregoside G (7) and gymnepregoside I (8), from the ethyl acetate fraction of G. sylvestre. The structures of the new compounds were established by extensive 1D and 2D nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra with mass spectroscopy data. Compounds 1-6 promoted glucose uptake by the range of 1.10- to 2.37-fold, respectively. Compound 1 showed the most potent glucose uptake, with 1.37-fold enhancement. Further study showed that compounds 1 and 5 could promote GLUT-4 fusion with the plasma membrane in L6 cells. The result attained in this study indicated that the separation and characterization of these compounds play an important role in the research and development of new anti-diabetic drugs and pharmaceutical industry.",

The present study aimed to investigate the potential vascular protective effect of gymnemic acid (GM) by assessing the morphological changes of microvasculature, along with VEGFA and angiopoietin-1 (Ang-1) protein expression in the brains of diabetic rats. Rats were divided into five groups, including control, gymnemic control rats (CGM), rats that were rendered diabetic by single injection of 60 mg/kg streptozotocin (STZ), diabetic rats treated with 400 mg/kg GM (STZ + GM) and diabetic rats treated with 4 mg/kg glibenclamide (GL; STZ + GL). After 8 weeks, brain tissues were collected to examine the three-dimensional morphology of the anterior cerebral arteries by vascular corrosion casting. Western blotting was performed to determine VEGFA and Ang-1 expression. Cerebral arteries, arterioles and capillaries were depicted the diameter, thickness and collagen accumulation of the wall, and the results demonstrated narrow diameters, thickened walls and collagen accumulation in the STZ group. After receiving GM, the histopathological changes were similar to that of the control group. Through vascular corrosion casting and microscopy, signs of vessel restoration and improvement were exhibited by increased diameters, and healthy and nourished arterioles and capillaries following treatment with GM. Furthermore, VEGF expression and Ang-1 secretion decreased in the STZ + GM group compared with STZ rats. The results of the present study revealed that GM treatment decreased blood vessel damage in the brain, suggesting that it may be used as a therapeutic target for the treatment of diabetes."

Novel natural molecules and phyto-extracts have been proposed as adjuvants to sensitise the response to Temozolomide (TMZ). In this study, we investigated the effect of GS extract on human glioblastoma cells U87Mg. According to the IC50-values, GS extract displayed a significant cytotoxicity. This was confirmed by cell growth inhibition and alteration in metabolic activity evaluated by cell count and MTT assay. GS induced reduction in Pro-caspase 9, 3, but not PARP cleavage nor DNA fragmentation. Thus, in GS-induced cytotoxicity, cell death is not associated with apoptosis. In this context, short-term treatment of U87Mg cells with GS extract (1 mg/mL) reduced the phosphorylation levels of mTOR and of its downstream target P70 S6 kinase, highlighting the role of GS extract into autophagy induction. The activation of autophagic flux by GS extract was confirmed by Western blot analysis, which revealed the reduction in p62 and the concomitant increase in LC3B II/I ratio. Immunofluorescence evidenced the accumulation of LC3B puncta in U87Mg cells pretreated with autophagy inhibitor Bafilomycin A1. Furthermore, as main key regulators of type II programmed cell death, p53, p21 and CDK4 were also investigated and were inhibited by GS treatment. In conclusion, GS extract could be considered as an autophagy inducer in glioblastoma cells U87Mg."

      "abstract": "This systematic review and meta-analysis aims to find the effect of Gymnema sylvestre (GS) supplementation on glycemic control in type-2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). PubMed, Cochrane library, Google Scholar, and Science Direct were searched from inception to June 2020 to identify the studies that reported GS supplementation on glycemic parameters. Standardized mean difference (SMD) was calculated by comparing the post-intervention data with baseline data. SMDs with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were pooled using a random-effects model. Our meta-analysis consisting of 10 studies with a total of 419 participants showed that GS supplementation significantly reduces fasting blood glucose (FBG) (SMD 1.57 mg/dl, 95% CI 2.22 to -0.93, p < .0001, I2 90%), postprandial blood glucose (PPBG) (SMD 1.04 mg/dl, 95% CI 1.53 to -0.54, p < .0001, I2 80%), and glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) (SMD 3.91, 95% CI 7.35 to -0.16%, p < .0001, I2 99%) compared to baseline. Further, our study also found that GS significantly reduces triglycerides (SMD 1.81 mg/dl, 95% CI 2.95 to -0.66, p < .0001, I2 : 96%), and total cholesterol (SMD 4.10 mg/dl, 95% CI 7.21 to -0.99, p < .0001, I2 : 98%) compared to baseline. Our study shows that GS supplementation is effective in improving glycemic control and reducing lipid levels in T2DM patients and suggests that such supplementation might be used as an effective therapy for the management of T2DM and its associated complications to an extent.",

Diabetes was induced by i.p. injection of alloxan monohydrate (140 mg/kg body weight) to albino Wistar rats. Six groups of rats (n=9) were used. Group 1 was the normal control; group 2 was diabetic control. After induction of diabetes metformin (150mg/kg), CBSKE (400mg/kg), GSLE (400 mg/kg) and CBSKE+GSLE (400mg/kg) were administered to diabetic rat groups 3, 4, 5 and 6 respectively for a period of 28 days. Diabetic rats exhibited an increase in serum blood glucose, liver function markers and lipid profile. Treatment of diabetic rats with metformin, CBSKE, GSLE and CBSKE+GSLE for 4 weeks significantly produced hepatoprotective and hypolipidemic effect via amelioration of raised serum glucose, liver profile, and lipid profile. The outcomes of this study suggest that G. sylvestre leaves and C. bonduc seed kernels have hepatoprotective and hypolipidemic potential which possibly help in managing diabetes-induced liver injury and hyperlipidemia.",

The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of G. sylvestre administration on glycemic control, insulin secretion, and insulin sensitivity in patients with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT). A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial was conducted in 30 patients with IGT. Fifteen patients randomly received G. sylvestre in doses of 300 mg b.i.d. and the other 15 received placebo in the same way. Before and after the intervention, anthropometric and metabolic measurements were taken, including 2-h oral glucose tolerance test (2-h OGTT), fasting plasma glucose, glycated hemoglobin A1c (A1C), and the lipid profile panel. Areas under the curve of glucose and insulin were calculated, as well as the insulinogenic, Stumvoll, and Matsuda indices. Wilcoxon, Mann-Whitney U, and chi-square or Fisher's exact tests were performed, and a P-value ≤.05 was considered statistically significant. There was a significant reduction in 2-h OGTT (9.1 ± 1.2 vs. 7.8 ± 1.7 mmol/L, P = .003), A1C (5.8 ± 0.3% vs. 5.4 ± 0.4%, P = .025), body weight, body mass index, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels in the G. sylvestre group, with an increment in the Matsuda index (1.8 ± 0.8 vs. 2.4 ± 1.2, P = .008). At the end of the intervention, 46.7% of the patients obtained normal values in A1C. In conclusion, G. sylvestre administration in patients with IGT decreased 2-h OGTT and A1C, increasing insulin sensitivity. There were also improvements in anthropometric measures and the lipid profile.",

In this study, a targeted, biosynthesis-inspired approach using UHPLC-qTOF/MS was implemented to elucidate the whole chemical profile of this plant for the standardization of the Vietnamese G. sylvestre variety. The known compounds were first determined to identify the building blocks of the biosynthetic intermediates and the construction rules for synthesizing oleanane triterpenoids in the plant. These blocks were recombined to build a virtual library of all reasonable compounds consistent with the deduced construction rules. Various techniques, including relative mass defect filtering, multiple key ion analysis, mass fragmentation analysis, and comparison with standard references, were applied to determine the presence of these predicted compounds. Conventional isolation and structure elucidation of six of the new compounds were carried out to identify the new building blocks and validate the assignments. Consequently, 119 peaks were quickly assigned to oleanane triterpenoids, and among them, 77 peaks were predicted to be new compounds based on their molecular formulas and mass fragmentation patterns. All the identified metabolites were then classified into different layers to analyze their logical relationships, and a multilayered chemical profile of the oleanane triterpenoids was constructed. This new approach is expected to be practical for characterizing structures of modular secondary metabolites, such as triterpenoid saponins, and for proposing biosynthetic relationships among compounds of the same class of metabolites in medicinal plants.",

Morphological and anatomical descriptions, ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 DNA sequencing, and acid hydrolysis analyses showed that G. sylvestre samples from Vietnam are distinguishable from those of Indian origin and thus suggest a dissimilarity among G. sylvestre samples with different geographic distributions. An LC-MS-guided strategy targeting 3β-glucuronide oleane-triterpenes in the Vietnamese G. sylvestre variety led to the isolation of four known compounds and nine previously undescribed compounds, named gymnemosides ND1-ND9. None of the isolated compounds were reported in the Indian sample, further supporting the geo-diversity of G. sylvestre. Three compounds, gymnemosides ND7-9, exerted significant stimulatory effects on the uptake of 2-NBDG in 3T3-L1 adipocyte cells and thus have potential as lead molecules for anti-diabetes agents.",

OBJECTIVES: Development of cost-effective marker system for the selection of high gymnemic acid yielding accessions of G. sylvestre. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Presoaked seeds of Brassica campestris treated with different dilutions of gymnemagenin and 10% leaf extract of twenty different accessions of G. sylvestre. Root tips of germinated seeds were fixed, and chromosomal studies were made by root tip bioassay method. RESULTS: Exposure of seeds to treatment solutions promotes various types of chromosomal anomalies in root meristem, and surprisingly, direct correlation between the percentage of chromosomal fragmentation and the percentage of gymnemic acid shared by treatment solution were observed. CONCLUSION: Later finding may be explored for the development of a novel methodology or marker system for the selection of high active principle yielding accessions of G. sylvestre. SUMMARY: An experiment was carried out using root tip bioassay method for the study of effect of different dilutions of standard gymnemic acid and 10% leaf extract of twenty different accessions of Gymnema sylvestre on root tip meristem of Brassica campestris. Various types of chromosomal anomalies were observed. Of which, percentage of chromosomal fragmentation was showed a direct (∞) relationship with the percentage of gymnemic acid shared by treatment solution.

The aim of the present study was to evaluate in vivo pharmacokinetic (PK) interaction between allopathic drugs tolbutamide (TOLBU), amlodipine (AMLO), and phenacetin (PHENA) at low (L) and high (H) doses with ethanolic extract (EL) from GS. EL was extracted and subjected to TLC, total triterpenoid content (19.76 ± 0.02 W/W) and sterol content (0.1837 ± 0.0046 W/W) estimation followed by identification of phytoconstituents using HRLC-MS and GC-MS. PK interaction study with CYP2C9, CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 enzymes were assessed using TOLBU, AMLO and PHENA respectively to index cytochrome (CYP) mediated interaction in rats after concomitant administration of EL extract (400 mg/kg) from GS for 7 days. The rats were divided into four groups for each PK study where, group I and II were positive control for low and high dose of test drugs (CYP substrates) while group II and IV were orally administered EL. The PK study result of PHENA indicated that area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC0-24) was significantly (P < 0.0001) increased by 1.4 (L) and 1.3-fold (H), plasma concentration (Cmax) was significantly (P < 0.001) increased by 1.6 (L) and 1.4-fold (H). Whereas for TOLBU; clearance rate (CL) was significantly (P < 0.0001) decreased by 2.4 (L) and 2.3-fold (H), Cmax, was significantly (P < 0.001) decreased by 26.5% (L) and 50.4% (H) and AUC0-24 was significantly (P < 0.0001) decreased by 59.8% (L) and 57.5% (H). Thus, EL is seen to be interacting with CYP1A2 by inhibiting its metabolic activity. HRLC-MS and GC-MS helped identify the presence of gymnemic acid (GA), triterpenoids and steroids in EL which could be the reason for PK interaction of CYP1A2 and CYP2C9. Also, in silico structure based site of metabolism study showed Fe accessibility and intrinsic activity for GA-IV, GA-VI, GA-VII and GA-X with CYP2C9. PK parameters of AMLO were not significantly affected by pre-treatment of EL. Thereby our findings indicate that co-administration of GS with drugs that are metabolized by CYP2C9 and CYP1A2 could lead to potential HDI.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Hyperlipidaemia is a well known risk factor for cardiovascular diseases. Lifestyle modification can be the initial step to reduce cholesterol levels. There are various drugs which are used to control dyslipidaemia. Treatment of lipid abnormalities is a lifelong battle. Moreover, the safety and effectiveness of long term lipid lowering treatment are questionable. Gymnema Sylvestre (GS) is a well known herb with various medicinal properties. AIM: To explore the hypolipidaemic activity of GS leaves extract. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Adult healthy female wistar rats, 30 in number, divided into five groups, weighing 150- 200 g were used. Dyslipidaemia was induced in rats by feeding them on high fat diet for four weeks. For the next four weeks GS extract was used as test drug while Atorvastatin was used as standard drug. Blood sample was collected for estimation of lipid profile on day 0, week 4 and week 8. Data was recorded as mean±SEM (Standard error of mean). Paired t-test and one way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) followed by Dunnett's post hoc test was used for comparison. A p-value <0.05 was considered statistically significant. SPSS Statistics 20 (IBM software) was used for the analysis. RESULTS: Feeding rats with high fat diet for four weeks led to obesity and dyslipidaemia in rats. GS at both the doses (100mg/kg and 200mg/kg) significantly improved the lipid profile. Total Cholesterol (TC), Triglycerides (TG), Very Low Density Lipoprotein (VLDL) and Low Density Lipoprotein (LDL) values reduced significantly while that of High Density Lipoprotein (HDL) increased significantly. GS 200 mg/kg was found more effective than GS 100 mg/kg. GS improved the value of lipid profile significantly but the effect was found inferior to Atorvastatin. CONCLUSION: From the present study it can be concluded that GS possess an effective hypolipidaemic effect. Hence it can be included as an add on therapy in dyslipidaemia after further confirmatory studies."

Statistical analysis was performed using Wilcoxon signed-rank, Mann-Whitney U, and chi-square tests; P ≤ .05 was considered statistically significant. After G. sylvestre administration, significant decreases in BWt (81.3 ± 10.6 kg vs. 77.9 ± 8.4 kg, P = .02), BMI (31.2 ± 2.5 kg/m2 vs. 30.4 ± 2.2 kg/m2, P = .02), and VLDL levels (0.45 ± 0.15 mmol/dL vs. 0.35 ± 0.15 mmol/dL, P = .05) were observed, without modifying the components of MetS, insulin secretion, and insulin sensitivity. In conclusion, G. sylvestre administration decreased BWt, BMI, and VLDL levels in subjects with MetS, without changes in insulin secretion and insulin sensitivity.",

The focus on pharmacological studies pertaining to diabetes has seen a remarkable shift from conventional medicines to therapeutics employing bioactive phytomolecules from natural sources. The prospective effectiveness of natural products together with their low cost and minimal side effects has revolutionized the entire concept of drug discovery and management programs. One such beneficial herb is Gymnema sylvestre, possessing remarkable hypoglycemic properties and forms the platform of diabetes therapeutics in the traditional system of medication. The present article discusses the significance of G. sylvestre in diabetes management, the herbal-formulations from the herb together with its standardization and clinical trials on animal models, and why Peroxisome Proliferator Activated Receptor gamma (PPARγ) may serve as a prospective molecular target for Gymnemic acid analogs. Such studies would define the molecular basis of bioactive molecules which would aid in the development of natural product based therapeutics in the treatment of diabetes.",

It is popularly called as \"Gur-mar\" for its distinctive property of temporarily destroying the taste of sweetness and is used in the treatment of diabetes. The leaves of gymnema possess antidiabetic, antimicrobial, anti-hypercholesterolemic, anti-sweetener, anti-inflammatory, and hepatoprotective properties and have traditional uses in the treatment of asthma, eye complaints, and snake bite. The leaves contain triterpene saponins such as gymnemic acid which is an active ingredient of Gymnema. Since the cultivation of G. sylvestre is a very slow process and the content of gymnemic acid depends on the environmental factors, cell suspension culture is sought as an alternative means for the production of Gymnema biomass and to enhance the gymnemic acid content. In this chapter, the methods employed for the induction of callus and subsequent establishment of cell suspension cultures for the production of biomass and analysis of gymnemic acid using high performance liquid chromatography are described.",

The aim of the present study was to investigate the potential ameliorative effect of Gymnema sylvestre (Gs) in a rat model of DN. Diabetes was induced via a single intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin (STZ; 60 mg/kg). Treatment with Gs extract (50 or 100 mg/kg/day) began two weeks following the administration of STZ and was continued for five weeks. Pain threshold behavior tests were performed subsequent to the five-week Gs treatment period. In addition, the serum levels of glucose, insulin and proinflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-6, were determined. Furthermore, the sciatic tissue levels of nitric oxide, thiobarbituric acid reactive substances and reduced glutathione were determined, as well as the activity levels of superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase and glutathione reductase. Levels of insulin-like growth factor (IGF), nerve growth factor (NGF), TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6 were also assessed in the sciatic tissue. In addition, the sciatic nerve tissue samples were analyzed for histopathological alterations. The diabetic rats exhibited apparent reductions in the paw-withdrawal (31%; P<0.01) and tail-flick latencies (38%; P<0.05). Furthermore, the diabetic rats demonstrated an evident elevation in serum and sciatic levels of proinflammatory cytokines. Measured oxidative stress biomarkers were significantly altered in the sciatic nerve tissue of the diabetic rats. Treatment with Gs attenuated diabetes-induced modifications with regard to the levels of serum glucose, insulin and proinflammatory cytokines. In the sciatic nerve tissue, the diabetes-induced alterations in IL levels and oxidative stress biomarkers were significantly improved in the Gs-treated rats. Furthermore, the reduction in the sciatic tissue expression levels of IGF and NGF was also ameliorated by Gs treatment. Histological analysis indicated that Gs corrected the sciatic tissue in the diabetic rats. Therefore, the results demonstrated that the neuroprotective effect of Gs may be associated with the inhibitory effect on the excessive activation of inflammatory molecules and oxidative stress mediators."

Therefore, the present study was planned to investigate the effect of water- soluble fraction of Gymnema sylvestre ethanol extract on biochemical and molecular alterations in obese diabetic rats. Diabetes was induced by single i.v. injection of streptozotocin (45 mg/kg) via tail vein. Obesity was induced by oral feeding of high fat diet for a period of 28 days in diabetic rats. Body weight gain, food intake, water intake, hemodynamic parameters (systolic, diastolic, mean arterial blood pressures and heart rate), serum biochemical parameters (leptin, insulin, lipid levels, apolipoprotein B and glucose), cardiomyocyte apoptosis (cardiac caspase-3, Na(+)/K(+) ATPase activity and DNA fragmentation) organs and visceral fat pad weight and oxidative stress parameters were measured. Oral treatment with water soluble fraction of Gymnema sylvestre ethanol extracts (120 mg/kg/p.o.) for a period of 21 days, resulted in significant reduction in heart rate, mean arterial pressure, serum leptin, insulin, apolipoprotein B, lipids, glucose, cardiac caspase-3 levels, Na(+)/K(+) ATPase activity and DNA laddering, visceral fat pad and organ's weight and improved the antioxidant enzymes levels in the high fat diet induced obesity in diabetic rats. The results of present study reveal that water soluble fraction of Gymnema sylvestre ethanol extract could be useful intervention in the treatment of obesity and type-2 diabetes mellitus."

The present study was carried out to analyze the anti-stress, anti-allergic, and antiulcer activity of the bioactive compounds present in Gymnema sylvestre leaves. METHODS: The preliminary phytochemical screening for bioactive compounds from aqueous extracts revealed the presence of alkaloids, triterpenes, flavonoids, steroids, and saponins. The antioxidant activities were investigated using DPPH radical scavenging method. The characterization of the extract was carried out using standard compound by High Performance Thin Layer Chromatography (HPTLC) and phytochemical analysis in terms of total phenol, total flavonoids, reducing power and antioxidant potentials, etc. The in vivo studies on albino mice proved the purified fraction has anti-stress/anti-allergic activity against milk induced leucocytosis/eosinophilia and able to inhibit the aspirin induced gastric ulcers. RESULTS: The quantitative estimation for aqueous extract exhibited total antioxidant (9.13 ± 0.04 μg/g), flavonoids (125.62 ± 26.84 μg/g), tannin (111.53 ± 15.13 μg/g), total phenol content (285.23 ± 1.11 μg/g) and free radical scavenging (52.14 ± 0.32%). Further the aqueous extract was consecutively purified by TLC and silica column chromatography. The purified fractions were characterized by HPTLC and GC-MS and the component was identified as gymnemic acid. The potency of the antimicrobial activity of the extract was studied with bacteria. Pharmacological experiments clearly demonstrated that the extracts of all plants given orally showed significant gastric protection against the asprin-induced gastric ulcer model in mice. Furthermore, healing effects were also confirmed through histopathological examination. CONCLUSIONS: The aqueous extracts of the leaves of Gymnema sylvestre possess anti ulcerogenic, Anti allergic, Anti stress, properties that may be due to cytoprotective mechanism. These results support the ethno medical uses of the plant in the treatment of gastric ulcer.",

Gymnema sylvestre (GS) leaves extract is distinguished for its anti-diabetic, antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. Present study is designed to evaluate the preventative activities of GS against acetic acid (AA)-induced ulcerative colitis in Wistar rats. METHODS: Experimentally ulcerative colitis (UC) was induced by AA in animals pretreated with three different doses of GS leaves extract (50, 100, 200 mg/kg/day) and a single dose of mesalazine (MES, 300 mg/kg/day) for seven days. Twenty four hours later, animals were sacrificed and the colonic tissues were collected. Colonic mucus content was determined using Alcian blue dye binding technique. Levels of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), total glutathione sulfhydryl group (T-GSH) and non-protein sulfhydryl group (NPSH) as well as the activity of the antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) were estimated in colon tissues. Colonic nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) and total protein (TP) concentrations were also determined. Levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines including interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) as well as prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and nitric oxide (NO) were estimated in colonic tissues. The histopathological changes of the colonic tissues were also observed. RESULTS: In AA administered group TBARS levels were increased, while colonic mucus content, T-GSH and NP-SH, SOD and CAT were reduced in colon. Pretreatment with GS inhibited TBARS elevation as well as mucus content, T-GSH and NP-SH reduction. Enzymatic activities of SOD and CAT were brought back to their normal levels in GS pretreated group. A significant reduction in DNA, RNA and TP levels was seen following AA administration and this inhibition was significantly eliminated by GS treatment. GS pretreatment also inhibited AA-induced elevation of pro-inflammatory cytokines, PGE2 and NO levels in colon. The apparent UC protection was further confirmed by the histopathological screening. CONCLUSION: The GS leaves extract showed significant amelioration of experimentally induced colitis, which may be attributed to its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant property.",

The present study was designed to investigate the antioxidant activities of Ethanolic extract of A. bilimbi, G. sylvestre and C. frutescens. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The antioxidant activity of the extracts were evaluated using total phenolic and flavonoid contents, ferric reducing power and the free radical scavenging activity against 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH). RESULTS: Total phenolic and flavonoid contents were higher in G. sylvestre (53.63636 ± 0.454545 mg/g gallic acid equivalent) and C. frutescens (26.66667 ± 2.081666 mg/g quercetin equivalent) respectively. Reducing power of the crude ethanol extracts increased with the concentrations of the extracts and all the extracts showed moderate free radical scavenging activity against DPPH. The plant extract displayed moderate phenolic and flavonoid contents compared to gallic acid and quercetin equivalent respectively, whereas also exhibited significant scavenging of DPPH radical and reducing power compared with ascorbic acid as standard. CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that G. sylvestre has significant antioxidant activity. The antioxidant compound of this plant might be a therapeutic candidate against oxidative stress related diseases. Different sub-fraction of A. bilimbi and C. frutescens should be studied further to assess the effect. Further study is necessary for isolation and characterization of the active antioxidant agents for better treatment."

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), by 2030, 87 and 439 million people will be affected in India and the world, respectively. Today, herbal medicines are gaining interest in the treatment of obesity and diabetes, because of their minimal side effects. Gymnemic acid - an active component isolated from Gymnema sylvestre - has anti-obesity and antidiabetic properties, decreases body weight and also inhibits glucose absorption. Several components extracted from Gymnema prevent the accumulation of triglycerides in muscle and liver, and also decrease fatty acid accumulation in the circulation. In this paper, an attempt has been made to review the effects of various extracts from Gymnema sylvestre in the regulation of carbohydrate and lipid metabolism in both animal and clinical studies.",

OBJECTIVES: Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors are the emerging class of anti-diabetic agents. However, only few compounds are commercially available. Therefore, in the present study we tried to explore the naturally occurring PM, EJ and GS semi-standardized extracts for their potential DPP-4 inhibition in vitro and in vivo. MATERIALS AND METHODS: DPP-4 inhibition was evaluated by in vitro inhibitory assay, and enzyme kinetics were calculated using one-phase exponential decay equation. Glucose load (2 g/kg) was administered to control and diabetic rats 30 min following extract administration (100, 200 and 400 mg/kg) orally once, and blood samples were withdrawn at 0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2 and 3 h to measure plasma active glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) levels. RESULTS: PM and EJ inhibit DPP-4 potently with IC50 values of 273.73 ± 2.96 and 278.94 ± 6.73 µg/mL, respectively, compared to GS (773.22 ± 9.21 µg/mL). PM, EJ and GS exhibit long duration of action with enzyme inhibitory half-lives of 462.3, 317.2 and 153.8 min, respectively. Extracts significantly increase GLP-1 levels compared to negative control groups and peak GLP-1 level was observed at 2 h for PM and EJ, whereas for GS it was at 1.5 h DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Taken together, results suggest the extracts may have potent DPP-4 inhibitory action, and their hypoglycemic action attributed through an increase in plasma active GLP-1 levels.",

Study was performed in high fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity in murine model. Obesity was induced by oral feeding of HFD for 28 days. The anti obesity effect of water soluble fraction of Gymnema sylvestre extract (120 mg/kg, p.o. for 21 days) in HFD fed rats was evaluated by the measurement of body weight gain, food intake, hemodynamic changes (systolic, diastolic, mean blood pressure and heart rate), serum lipid profiles (triglycerides, total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol), leptin, insulin, glucose, apolipoproteins A1 and B, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and antioxidant enzymes such as reduced glutathione (GSH), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), glutathione reductase (GR), glutathione-S transferase (GST), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) levels in liver tissues. Organs and visceral fat pad weight were measured. Histopathological studies were also carried out. Water soluble fraction of G. sylvestre ethanolic extract and rimonabant significantly reduced serum lipids, leptin, insulin, glucose, apolipoprotein B and LDH levels while it significantly increased the HDL-cholesterol, apolipoprotein A1 and antioxidant enzymes levels in liver tissue as compared to the HFD fed rats. Histopathological studies of tissues showed no pathological changes. The results of this study show that water soluble fraction of G. sylvestre extract possess antiobesity effect.",

The present study was done to assess the effect of Gymnema sylvestre extract (GSE) in the high fat diet (HFD)-induced cellular obesity and cardiac damage in Wistar rats. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Adult male Wistar rats (150-200 g body weight) were used in this study. HFD was used to induce obesity. Body mass index, hemodynamic parameters, serum leptin, insulin, glucose, lipids, apolipoprotein levels, myocardial apoptosis, and antioxidant enzymes were assessed. Organ and visceral fat pad weights and histopathological studies were also carried out. RESULTS: Oral feeding of HFD (20 g/day) for a period of 28 days resulted in a significant increase in body mass index, organ weights, visceral fat pad weight, cardiac caspase-3, cardiac DNA laddering (indicating apoptotic inter-nucleosomal DNA fragment), and lipid peroxide levels of cardiac tissues of rats. Further, mean arterial blood pressure, heart rate, serum leptin, insulin, LDH, LDL-C, total cholesterol, triglycerides, and apolipoprotein-B levels were enhanced significantly, whereas serum HDL-C, apoliporotein-A1 levels, and cardiac Na(+) K(+) ATPase, antioxidant enzymes levels were significantly decreased. Furthermore, treatment with standardized ethanolic GSE (200 m/kg/p.o.) for a period of 28 days resulted in significant reversal of above mentioned changes in the obese Wistar rats. CONCLUSION: The present study has demonstrated the significant antiobesity potential of GSE in murine model of obesity.",

(Gymnema) (Asclepiadaceae) has been used from ancient times as a folk medicine for the treatment of diabetes, obesity, urinary disorder, and stomach stimulation. OBJECTIVE: The present study was designed to investigate the effects of G. sylvestre leaves ethanol extract on gastric mucosal injury in rats. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Gastric mucosal damage was induced by 80% ethanol in 36 h fasted rats. The effect of G. sylvestre on gastric secretions induced in Shay rats was estimated. In stomach, wall mucus, non-protein sulfhydryl groups (NP-SH), malondialdehyde (MDA), total proteins and nucleic acids levels were estimated. Histopathological changes were observed. RESULTS: G. sylvestre pretreatment at doses of 100, 200 and 400 mg/kg provided 27, 49, and 63% protection against the ulcerogenic effect of ethanol, respectively. Pylorus ligation accumulated 10.24 mL gastric secretions with 66.56 mEq of acidity in control rats. Pretreatment with G. sylvestre significantly inhibited the secretions volume and acidity in dose-dependent manner. Ethanol caused significant depletion in stomach-wall mucus (p < 0.001), total proteins (p < 0.01), nucleic acids (p < 0.001), and NP-SH (p < 0.001) levels. Pretreatment with G. sylvestre showed protection against these depleted levels in dose-dependent manner. The MDA levels increased from 19.02 to 29.22 nmol/g by ethanol ingestion and decreased with G. sylvestre pretreatments in dose-dependent manner. CONCLUSION: The protective effect of G. sylvestre observed in the present study is attributed to its effect on mucus production, increase in nucleic acid and NP-SH levels, which appears to be mediated through its free radical scavenging ability and/or possible cytoprotective properties.",

Extracts of Gymnema sylvestre (GS) have anti-diabetic activities and have been used as a folk medicine in India for centuries. We have investigated the effects of a novel high molecular weight GS extract termed OSA® on glucose tolerance in insulin-resistant ob/ob mice, and on insulin secretion and synthesis by isolated mouse islets. Single administration of OSA® (500 mg/kg) to ob/ob mice 30 min before an intraperitoneal glucose load improved their abnormal glucose tolerance. In vitro studies indicated that OSA® (0.25 mg/ml) initiated rapid and reversible increases in insulin secretion from isolated mouse islets at substimulatory (2 mM) and stimulatory (20 mM) glucose concentrations. In addition, prolonged treatment (24-48 h) of mouse islets with OSA® elevated the expression of preproinsulin mRNA and maintained the total insulin content of mouse islets in the presence of stimulated insulin secretion. These effects of OSA® are consistent with its potential use as a therapy for the hyperglycemia associated with obesity-related T2DM.",

Due to their immense medicinal value, production of saponins in suspension cultures has been attempted by many researchers. Gymnema sylvestre is a rich source of gymnemic acids (saponins) that find application in the treatment of diabetes. The present study is an attempt to evaluate the effect of various metal salts (cadmium chloride, mercuric chloride, silver nitrate, cupric chloride, cobaltous chloride and calcium chloride) in eliciting the response from G. sylvestre suspension cultures. The maximum gymnemic acid production in the suspensions was achieved on day 12 of culture, though the maximum biomass was obtained on day 16. Among the different salts, CdCl(2) gave maximum response (59.97 mg/gDCW) at 2 mM concentration after a 24 h time period, while, AgNO(3) gave the least response (18.35 mg/gDCW) on incubation of 48 h at 1 mM concentration, in terms of gymnemic acid accumulation. The accumulation of gymnemic acid was found to be dependent on treatment time and concentration of the elicitor. The enhanced gymnemic acid production shown by the suspensions in response to the metal salts indicates their role in evoking the plant defense mechanisms. These elicitation studies help in providing a platform for improved commercial supply of bioactive gymnemic acids.",

Moreover, >800 plants have been traditionally used for the treatment of diabetes. Despite this widespread use, only few were supported by rigorous clinical evidence. Gymnema sylvestre, also known as gurmar (sugar destroyer in Hindi), is a plant considered to be with potent antidiabetic effects and, hence, widely used in folk, ayurvedic and homeopathic systems in medicine. The authors were unable to find previous reports associating G sylvestre to liver injury. Herein, the authors report a case of DILI in a patient who was treated with G sylvestre for diabetes mellitus and review the literature to suggest possible mechanisms that led to this acute condition.",

Extracts of Gymnema sylvestre (GS) have been used for the treatment of T2DM in India for centuries. The effects of a novel high molecular weight GS extract, Om Santal Adivasi, (OSA(R)) on plasma insulin, C-peptide and glucose in a small cohort of patients with T2DM are reported here. Oral administration of OSA(R) (1 g/day, 60 days) induced significant increases in circulating insulin and C-peptide, which were associated with significant reductions in fasting and post-prandial blood glucose. In vitro measurements using isolated human islets of Langerhans demonstrated direct stimulatory effects of OSA(R) on insulin secretion from human ß-cells, consistent with an in vivo mode of action through enhancing insulin secretion. These in vivo and in vitro observations suggest that OSA(R) may provide a potential alternative therapy for the hyperglycemia associated with T2DM.",

The present study was carried out to isolate and identify the putative antidiabetic compound based on bioassay-guided fractionation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An active compound dihydroxy gymnemic triacetate has been isolated from Gymnema sylvestre acetone extract and its optimum dose has been determined and patented. An optimum dose of dihydroxy gymnemic triacetate (20mg/kg body weight) was orally administered for 45 days to streptozotocin diabetic rats for the assessment of plasma glucose, insulin, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), tissue glycogen, lipid parameters such as triglycerides, total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol and activities of hepatic marker enzymes, such as aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and acid phosphatase (ACP) in normal and streptozotocin diabetic rats. RESULTS: Dihydroxy gymnemic triacetate at 20mg dose produced significant effects on all biochemical parameters studied compared to diabetic control group. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that dihydroxy gymnemic triacetate, the compound from Gymnema sylvestre, possessed hypoglycemic and hypolipidemic activity in long-term treatment and hence it could be used as a drug for treating diabetes.",

Gymnemic acid (C(43)H(68)O(14)), a pentacyclic triterpenoid isolated from the leaves of Gymnema sylvestre, exhibits potent inhibitory effect on diabetes. The gymnemic acid content is determined by chromatographic methods: Camag HPTLC system equipped with a sample applicator Linomat IV and TLC scanner and integration software CAT 4.0. In HPLC C(18) (ODS) reverse phase column; water 486 UV detector; mobile phase, water/methanol (35:65, HPLC grade) + 0.1% acetic acid are used. Sample (20 microL) is applied with a flow rate of 1 mL/min and read at 230 nm with UV detector. The production of gymnemic acid is significantly higher in callus treated with 2,4-dichloro phenoxy acetic acid (2,4-D) and kinetin (KN). The blue light increases gymnemic acid accumulation upto 4.4-fold as compared with fluorescent light treatment and out of which 2.8 is found in leaves. Gymnemic acid is isolated from callus, grown under stress conditions followed by preparative TLC, simple and reproducible character based on HPTLC and high performance liquid chromatography.",

We have now examined the effects of a novel GS extract (termed OSA) on insulin secretion from the MIN6 beta-cell line and isolated human islets of Langerhans. Insulin secretion from MIN6 cells was stimulated by OSA in a concentration-dependent manner, with low concentrations (0.06-0.25 mg/ml) having no deleterious effects on MIN6 cell viability, while higher concentrations (> or = 0.5 mg/ml) caused increased Trypan blue uptake. OSA increased beta-cell Ca2+ levels, an effect that was mediated by Ca2+ influx through voltage-operated calcium channels. OSA also reversibly stimulated insulin secretion from isolated human islets and its insulin secretagogue effects in MIN6 cells and human islets were partially dependent on the presence of extracellular Ca2+. These data indicate that low concentrations of the GS isolate OSA stimulate insulin secretion in vitro, at least in part as a consequence of Ca2+ influx, without compromising beta-cell viability. Identification of the component of the OSA extract that stimulates regulated insulin exocytosis, and further investigation of its mode(s) of action, may provide promising lead targets for Type 2 diabetes therapy.",

Loose leaf Gymnema sylvestre can be prepared as a tea and will impair the ability to taste sugar by blocking sweet receptors on the tongue. This report describes a laboratory exercise easily applied to an undergraduate neuroscience course that can be used to illustrate the principles of gustatory sensation. Combined with a preceding lecture on the primary taste sensations, students experience and appreciate how the primary tastes are combined to produce overall taste. In addition, the exercises outlined here expand upon previously published demonstrations employing Gymnema sylvestre to include illustrations of the different sensory transduction mechanisms associated with each of the four or five primary taste modalities. Students compare their qualitative primary taste experiences to salt, sugar, aspartame, chocolate, and sweet-sour candy prior to and following exposure to Gymnema sylvestre. The herb's impairment of sweet sensation is profound and dramatically alters the perception of sweetness in sugar, chocolate, and candy without altering the perception of the other primary tastes. The exercise has an indelible effect on students because the herb's intense effect compels students to rely on their unique personal experiences to highlight the principles of gustatory sensation."

GS4 stimulated insulin release from HIT-T15, MIN6 and RINm5F beta-cells and from islets in the absence of any other stimulus, and GS4-stimulated insulin secretion was inhibited in the presence of 1 mM EGTA. Blockade of voltage-operated Ca(2+) channels with 10 microM isradipine did not significantly affect GS4-induced secretion, and insulin release in response to GS4 was independent of incubation temperature. Examination of islet and beta-cell integrity after exposure to GS4, by trypan blue exclusion, indicated that concentrations of GS4 that stimulated insulin secretion also caused increased uptake of dye. Two gymnemic acid-enriched fractions of GS4, obtained by size exclusion and silica gel chromatography, also caused increases in insulin secretion concomitant with increased trypan blue uptake. These results confirm the stimulatory effects of G. sylvestre on insulin release, but indicate that GS4 acts by increasing cell permeability, rather than by stimulating exocytosis by regulated pathways. Thus the suitability of GS4 as a potential novel treatment for NIDDM can not be assessed by direct measurements of beta-cell function in vitro.",

To test this hypothesis, the effects of Seishin-renshi-in (Chinese medicine) and Gymnema sylvestre (Indian medicine) on the insulin resistance of streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats was studied by the glucose clamp technique. Oral administration of Seishin-renshi-in (800 mg/kg/day) with injections of a minimum dose of Ultralente insulin decreased urine volume and urinary glucose excretion during a 7-day treatment period and improved the insulin stimulated glucose uptake in peripheral tissues, as well as improving the insulin suppressed hepatic glucose output during glucose clamp. However, G. sylvestre (120 mg/kg/day) treatment did not improve insulin resistance. We conclude that Seishin-renshi-in, with a small dose of insulin, improved insulin resistance in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats, but Gymnema sylvestre did not.",

      "abstract": "Two water soluble extracts, GS3 and GS4, obtained from the leaves of Gymnema sylvestre, were tested in streptozotocin treated rats for their effects on blood glucose homeostasis and pancreatic endocrine tissue. In the diabetic rats, fasting blood glucose levels returned to normal after 60 days of GS3 and after 20 days of GS4 oral administration. Blood collected during the conduct of oral glucose tolerance tests was used to assay for serum insulin. GS3 and GS4 therapy led to a rise in serum insulin to levels closer to normal fasting levels. In diabetic rat pancreas, both GS3 and GS4 were able to double the islet number and beta cell number. This herbal therapy appears to bring about blood glucose homeostasis through increased serum insulin levels provided by repair/regeneration of the endocrine pancreas.",

      "abstract": "Effect of Gymnema sylvestre, R.Br. (G. sylvestre; GS4) on glucose homeostasis was studied in rats. In the first set of experiments, the acute effect of GS4 was examined in both non-diabetic and streptozocin (30 mg/kg)-induced mildly diabetic rats. Administration of 1 g/kg body weight of GS4 to 18-h fasted non-diabetic rats significantly attenuated the serum glucose response to oral administration of 1 g/kg glucose. The immunoreactive insulin (IRI) response in GS4-administered rats was lower, but not significantly, than that in control rats. In mildly diabetic rats, a 60 min increment in serum glucose concentrations was significantly reduced by GS4 administration. No IRI response was observed in these diabetic rats irrespective of GS4 administration. In the second set of experiments, the chronic effect of GS4 was examined in mildly diabetic rats. Two weeks after the induction of diabetes, the rats were divided into two groups that had similar impairment of glucose tolerance assessed by an oral glucose loading test. The rats were fed for 32-35 days with either a control diet or a diet supplemented with GS4. After 4 weeks, GS4 showed a tendency to reduce the serum glucose concentrations in the fed state and to improve the glucose tolerance. Gain in body weight, food intake, pancreas weight and the pancreatic contents of IRI, protein, amylase and trypsinogen were unaltered in the GS4-treated group compared with the control. These results suggest the usefulness of G. sylvestre in the treatment of certain classes of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.",

G. sylvestre therapy not only produced blood glucose homeostasis but also increased the activities of the enzymes affording the utilisation of glucose by insulin dependent pathways: it controlled phosphorylase levels, gluconeogenic enzymes and sorbitol dehydrogenase. The uptake and incorporation of [14C] glucose into the glycogen and protein are increased in the liver, kidney and muscle in G. sylvestre administered diabetic animals when compared to the untreated diabetic animals. Pathological changes initiated in the liver during the hyperglycemic phase are reversed by controlling hyperglycemia by G. sylvestre. G. sylvestre, a herb used for the control of diabetes mellitus in several parts of India, appears to correct the metabolic derangements in diabetic rabbit liver, kidney and muscle.",
