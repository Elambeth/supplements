      "abstract": "Aim: Halitosis is the unpleasant odor emitted from the oral cavity during exhalation and phonation. Using oral care products containing specific probiotics and paraprobiotics, combined with lifestyle changes, this study is aimed at resolving the patient's altered breath odor. Case Report: A 49-year-old male patient suffered from retronasal discharge, bacterial plaque on the back of his tongue, and bad breath. He underwent a professional oral hygiene session, received instructions in proper home oral hygiene techniques, and was advised on appropriate lifestyle changes. The use of oral care products based on probiotics and paraprobiotics was recommended. Sixty days later, the patient was reevaluated and was satisfied with the results, as his tongue had improved significantly, and he no longer experienced any bad sensations in his mouth. Conclusion: Systematic removal of bacterial biofilm and the use of probiotics and paraprobiotics can be useful in the prevention and treatment of halitosis."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The microbial-gut-brain axis has received much attention in recent years, and regulating intestinal flora can effectively improve sleep disorders, which hints the potential effects of probiotics on sleep disorders, but lack of research evidence for meta-analysis. Therefore, this study aims to quantitatively evaluate the influence of probiotics on sleep disorders and sub-healthy sleep conditions. METHODS: Up to 2023, online databases including Pubmed, Embase, Cochrane library, Web of science have been searched for studies involving adults who consume probiotics or paraprobiotics in controlled trials, during which, changes in subjective and/or objective sleep parameters and contributing factors in sleeping quality are examined. We conduct a meta-analysis of 11 clinical randomized controlled studies. RESULTS: Probiotic supplementation improves sleep states to some extent in adults with sleep disorders and healthy adults with condition-induced sleep disorders (-0.34 [-0.56 to -0.13]; I 2 = 42.6%; p = 0.001). Meanwhile, subgroup analysis shows that the effect of probiotics on improving sleep disorders is influenced by other factors such as the health states of the subjects, the duration of the intervention, the type of strain, and the test criteria. CONCLUSION: Probiotics and paraprobiotics have a significant positive effect on the sleep quality of adults with sleep disorders or sub-healthy sleep conditions. However, the therapeutic effects of probiotics on sleep problems need future additional trials. SYSTEMATIC REVIEW REGISTRATION: https://inplasy.com/inplasy-2022-12-0066/, identifier 2022120066."

      "abstract": "Gingival-derived mesenchymal stem cells (GMSCs) stand for a unique source of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) isolated from a neural crest origin with potential application in regenerative medicine. However, there are some limitations to the usage of these cells in clinical cell therapy such as reduced cell number and undesirable differentiation of the cell throughout frequent passages. Nowadays, studies have applied manipulation strategies to improve MSCs' effectiveness in clinical therapy. Among all of the materials used for this purpose, there is a growing trend for the use of biomaterials such as probiotic extracts or their conditioned media due to their lower toxicity. In the present study, we utilized extracts from Lactobacillus reuteri and Lactobacillus rhamnosus to assess their potential to enhance the function of GMSCs. We compared the effectiveness of these bacterial extracts to determine their relative efficacy. Bacterial extracts of two lactic acid bacteria were prepared using an ultrasonic homogenizing device. The impact of these bacterial extracts on GMSCs was evaluated through Alizarin Red and Oil Red O staining, cell counting by Trypan Blue staining, and real-time polymerase chain reaction. The findings of our study indicate that the administration of 50 μg/mL L. rhamnosus extract resulted in a greater enhancement of stemness marker expression, osteogenic differentiation, and proliferation of GMSCs compared with an equivalent concentration of L. reuteri extract. Neither of these bacterial extracts revealed any effect on the differentiation of the GMSCs into the adipogenic lineage. These findings suggest that L. rhamnosus extract could be more effective at promoting GMSCs' efficacy in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: After the enormous health burden during the acute stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, we are now facing another important challenge, that is, long-COVID, a clinical condition with often disabling signs and symptoms of the neuropsychiatric, gastrointestinal, respiratory, cardiovascular, and immune systems. While the pathogenesis of this syndrome is still poorly understood, alterations of immune function and the gut microbiota seem to play important roles. Because affected individuals are frequently unable to work for prolonged periods and suffer numerous health compromises, effective treatments represent a major unmet medical need. Multiple potential therapies have been tried, but none is approved yet. Approaches that are able to influence the immune system and gut microbiota such as probiotics and paraprobiotics, i.e., nonviable probiotics, seem promising candidates. We, therefore, evaluated the clinical and immunologic effects of paraprobiotics in a small pilot study. METHODS: A total of 6 patients with long-COVID were followed systematically for more than 12 months after disease onset using standardized validated questionnaires, a smartphone app, and wearable sensors to assess neurocognitive function, fatigue, depressiveness, autonomic nervous system alterations, and quality of life. We then offered patients defined paraprobiotics for 4 weeks and evaluated them at the end of the treatment period using the same questionnaires, smartphone app, and wearable sensors. In addition, a comprehensive immunophenotyping and gut microbiota analysis was performed before and after treatment. RESULTS: Improvements in several of the neurologic symptoms such as dysautonomia, fatigue, and depression were documented using both patient-reported outcomes and data from the smartphone app and wearable sensors. Of interest, the expression of activation markers on some immune cell populations such as B cells and nonclassical monocytes and the expression of toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) on T cells were reduced after paraprobiotics treatment. DISCUSSION: Our results suggest that paraprobiotics might exert positive effects in patients with long-COVID most likely by modulating immune cell activation and expression of TLR2 on T cells. Further studies with paraprobiotics should confirm the promising observations of this small pilot study and hopefully not only improve the outcome of long-COVID but also unravel the pathomechanisms of this condition. CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE: This study provides Class IV evidence that paraprobiotics increase the probability of favorable changes of clinical and immunologic markers in patients with long-COVID.",

Different inactivation rates were obtained, up to 8.18 after 10 min at 90 °C, 2.07 after 15 min at a voltage gradient of 20 V/cm, 6.62 after 10 min at 600 MPa and 3.6 after ultrasound treatment for 10 min at 100 % amplitude. The experimental data were fitted to Weibullian model proposed by Peleg, allowing to estimate the inactivation rate coefficient (b) and the shape of the inactivation curves (n). At lower concentration, the samples showed both cytocompatibility and antiproliferative effect, stimulating the cell proliferation on both murine fibroblast and human colorectal adenocarcinoma cell lines."

      "abstract": "Neuropsychiatric disorders are clinical conditions that affect cognitive function and emotional stability, often resulting from damage or disease in the central nervous system (CNS). These disorders are a worldwide concern, impacting approximately 12.5% of the global population. The gut microbiota has been linked to neurological development and function, implicating its involvement in neuropsychiatric conditions. Due to their interaction with gut microbial communities, probiotics offer a natural alternative to traditional treatments such as therapeutic drugs and interventions for alleviating neuropsychiatric symptoms. Introduced by Metchnikoff in the early 1900s, probiotics are live microorganisms that provide various health benefits, including improved digestion, enhanced sleep quality, and reduced mental problems. However, concerns about their safety, particularly in immunocompromised patients, warrant further investigation; this has led to the concept of \"paraprobiotics\", inactivated forms of beneficial microorganisms that offer a safer alternative. This review begins by exploring different methods of inactivation, each targeting specific cellular components like DNA or proteins. The choice of inactivation method is crucial, as the health benefits may vary depending on the conditions employed for inactivation. The subsequent sections focus on the potential mechanisms of action and specific applications of probiotics and paraprobiotics in neuropsychiatric therapy. Probiotics and paraprobiotics interact with gut microbes, modulating the gut microbial composition and alleviating gut dysbiosis. The resulting neuropsychiatric benefits primarily stem from the gut-brain axis, a bidirectional communication channel involving various pathways discussed in the review. While further research is needed, probiotics and paraprobiotics are promising therapeutic agents for the management of neuropsychiatric disorders.",

However, treatment success may be reduced by the emergency of dose-limiting side effects, such as intestinal mucositis and diarrhea. Mucositis and diarrhea management is symptomatic, and there is no preventive therapy. Bacterial and fungal-based compounds have been suggested as an alternative for preventing the development of diarrhea in cancer patients. Using probiotics is safe and effective in immunocompetent individuals, but concerns remain during immunosuppressive conditions. Paraprobiotics, formulations composed of non-viable microorganisms, have been proposed to overcome such limitation.

      "abstract": "Neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, are major age-related concerns in elderly people. Since no drug fully addresses the progression of neurodegenerative diseases, advance treatment strategies are urgently needed. Several studies have noted the senescence of immune system and the perturbation of gut microbiota in the aged population. In recent years, the role of gut microbiota has been increasingly studied in the manifestation of age-related CNS disorders. In this context, prebiotics, probiotics, and paraprobiotics are reported to improve the behavioural and neurobiological abnormalities in elderly patients. As live microbiota, prescribed in the form of probiotics, shows some adverse effects like sepsis, translocation, and horizontal gene transfer, paraprobiotics could be a possible alternative strategy in designing microbiome-based therapeutics.

In this study, 336 one-day-old COBB 500 chicks were randomly allotted to eight treatment groups and replicated six times with seven birds per replicate. The treatment included T1 (Negative control) = Basal diet, T2 (Positive control) = Basal diet + 0.01% oxytetracycline, T3 = Basal diet + 0.2% postbiotic TL1, T4 = Basal diet + 0.2% postbiotic RS5, T5 = Basal diet + 0.2% paraprobiotic RG11, T6 = Basal diet + 0.2% postbiotic RI11, T7 = Basal diet + 0.2% paraprobiotic RG14, and T8 = Basal diet + 0.2% paraprobiotic RI11. There were reported changes in the bacterial community using 16S rRNA sequencing of the colon mucosa. The results of the sequencing of 16S rRNA genes in the colon mucosa samples indicated that compared to birds fed the negative control diet, birds fed paraprobiotic RI11 diets were recorded to have a lower relative abundance of Proteobacteria, while those fed the positive control were recorded to have a higher proportion of Firmicutes. Also, lower Enterococcus was reported in paraprobiotic RI11, while the most abundant genus was Bacteroides in postbiotic TL1. This study revealed that supplementation of postbiotics and paraprobiotics in the diets of broilers demonstrated positive effects on the microbiota by supporting the increase of beneficial microbes like the Firmicutes while decreasing harmful microbes like the Proteobacteria. Therefore, this study has provided knowledge on the modification of chicken mucosa microbiota through the feeding of postbiotics and paraprobiotics."

Methods: The experiment followed a completely randomized design (CRD) in which eight treatments were replicated six times with seven birds per replicate. A total of 336, one-day-old (COBB 500) chicks were fed with the eight treatment diets, which include T1 = negative control (Basal diet), T2 = positive control (Basal diet + 0.01% (w/w) Oxytetracycline), T3 = Basal diet + 0.2% (v/w) postbiotic TL1, T4 = Basal diet + 0.2% (v/w) postbiotic RS5, T5 = Basal diet + 0.2% (v/w) paraprobiotic RG11, T6 = Basal diet + 0.2% (v/w) postbiotic RI11, T7 = Basal diet + 0.2% (v/w) paraprobiotic RG14, T8 = Basal diet + 0.2% (v/w) paraprobiotic RI11, for 35 days in a closed house system. Results: The growth performance indicators (final body weight, cumulative weight gain, and feed conversion ratio) were not significantly (p > 0.05) affected by the dietary treatments. However, feed intake recorded a significant (p < 0.05) change in the starter and finisher phases across the dietary treatments. Paraprobiotic RG14 had significantly (p < 0.05) lower abdominal fat and intestines. Villi heights were significantly (p < 0.05) increased, while the crypt depth decreased significantly due to dietary treatments. The dietary treatments significantly influenced colon mucosa sIgA (p < 0.05). Similarly, plasma immunoglobulin IgM level recorded significant (p < 0.05) changes at the finisher phase. In this current study, the hepatic GHR and IGF-1 expressions were significantly (p < 0.05) increased by postbiotics and paraprobiotics supplementation. Conclusions: Therefore, it was concluded that postbiotics and paraprobiotics differ in their effect on broiler chickens. However, they can replace antibiotics without compromising the growth performance, carcass yield, and immune status of broiler chickens."

The use of the experimental products resulted in a significant reduction of most of the clinical indices assessed, which occurred at a major degree with respect to the conventional chlorhexidine considered as control. Additionally, after 6 months of use, the abovementioned products significantly decreased the percentage of pathological bacteria and the counts of those bacteria constituting the \"Red Complex\", more related to the periodontal disease. Accordingly, the paraprobiotics-based products tested in this study seem to represent a valid support to SRP with a benefit on both clinical indices and on specific periodontopathogens."

      "abstract": "Probiotics consumption has been associated with various health promoting benefits, including disease prevention and even treatment by modulating gut microbiota. Contrary to this, probiotics may also overstimulate the immune system, trigger systemic infections, harmful metabolic activities, and promote gene transfer. In children, the fragile immune system and impaired intestinal barrier may boost the occurrence of adverse effects following probiotics' consumption. To overcome these health challenges, the key focus has been shifted toward non-viable probiotics, also called paraprobiotics. Cell wall polysaccharides, peptidoglycans, surface proteins and teichoic acid present on cell's surface are involved in the interaction of paraprobiotics with the host, ultimately providing health benefits. Among other benefits, paraprobiotics possess the ability to regulate innate and adaptive immunity, exert anti-adhesion, anti-biofilm, anti-hypertensive, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, anti-proliferative, and antagonistic effects against pathogens, while also enhance clinical impact and general safety when administered in children in comparison to probiotics. Clinical evidence have underlined the paraprobiotics impact in children and young infants against atopic dermatitis, respiratory and gastrointestinal infections, in addition to be useful for immunocompromised individuals. Therefore, this review focuses on probiotics-related issues in children's health and also discusses the Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium spp. qualities for qualifying as paraprobiotics and their role in promoting the children's health.",

OH at different electric field magnitudes (4, 8, and 12 V/cm at 60 Hz) and conventional heat treatment (CONV) were performed to determine the most adequate condition for the obtainment of paraprobiotics. Analysis of culturability, flow cytometry (FC), and Scanning electron microscope (SEM) was carried out. The complete inactivation by CONV was achieved only in the following conditions: LA - 95 °C/5 min, LC and BA - 95 °C/7 min. The same temperature profile was used in OH treatments to study the OH electrical effects. The OH treatment (8 V/cm) caused lower damage to the cell membrane integrity compared to the CONV treatment (p < 0.05). The OH showed to be adequate technology for the efficient production of paraprobiotics.",

Given the seriousness of the problem, therapeutic alternatives have been sought as a means to ameliorate, prevent, and treat this condition. Among the alternatives available to address this side effect of treatment with 5-FU, the most promising has been the use of probiotics, prebiotics, synbiotics, and paraprobiotics. This review addresses the administration of these \"biotics\" as a therapeutic alternative for intestinal mucositis caused by 5-FU. It describes the effects and benefits related to their use as well as their potential for patient care."

      "abstract": "Inadequate sleep (i.e., duration and/or quality) is becoming increasingly recognized as a global public health issue. Interaction via the gut-brain axis suggests that modification of the gut microbial environment via supplementation with live microorganisms (probiotics) or nonviable microorganisms/microbial cell fractions (paraprobiotics) may improve sleep health. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to clarify the effect of consuming probiotics/paraprobiotics on subjective and objective sleep metrics. Online databases were searched from 1980 to October 2019 for studies involving adults who consumed probiotics or paraprobiotics in controlled trials, during which, changes in subjective and/or objective sleep parameters were examined. A total of 14 studies (20 trials) were included in meta-analysis. Random effects meta-analyses indicated that probiotics/paraprobiotics supplementation significantly reduced Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score (i.e., improved sleep quality) relative to baseline (-0.78-points, 95% confidence interval: 0.395-1.166; p < 0.001). No significant effect was found for changes on other subjective sleep scales, nor objective parameters of sleep (efficiency/latency) measured using polysomnography or actigraphy. Subgroup analysis for PSQI data suggested that the magnitude of the effect was greater (although not statistically) in healthy participants than those with a medical condition, when treatment contained a single (rather than multiple) strain of probiotic bacteria, and when the duration of treatment was ≥8 weeks. Probiotics/paraprobiotics supplementation may have some efficacy in improving perceived sleep health, measured using the PSQI. While current evidence does not support a benefit of consuming probiotics/paraprobiotics when measured by other subjective sleep scales, nor objective measures of sleep; more studies using well-controlled, within-subject experimental designs are needed.",

      "abstract": "Current evidence supports the use of probiotics in preterm neonates for prevention of necrotizing enterocolitis, mortality and late onset sepsis. Despite the strong evidence, the uptake of this intervention has not been universal due to concerns including probiotic sepsis, pro-inflammatory response and transmission of antibiotic resistance. Critically ill extremely preterm neonates with potentially compromised gut integrity are at higher risk of probiotic sepsis due to translocation. In most countries, probiotics are sold as food supplements with poor quality control. The traditional definition of probiotics as &ldquo;live microorganisms&rdquo; has been challenged as many experts have questioned the importance of viability in the context of the beneficial effects of probiotics. Paraprobiotics (ghost probiotics), are defined as non-viable microbial cells (intact or broken) or crude cell extracts (i.e., with complex chemical composition), which, when administered (orally or topically) in adequate amounts, confer a benefit on the human or animal consumer. Current evidence indicates that paraprobiotics could be safe alternatives to probiotics in preterm neonates. High-quality pre-clinical and clinical studies including adequately powered randomised controlled trials (RCTs) are warranted in preterm neonates to explore this new frontier.",

      "abstract": "Recently, the risk of viral infection has dramatically increased owing to changes in human ecology such as global warming and an increased geographical movement of people and goods. However, the efficacy of vaccines and remedies for infectious diseases is limited by the high mutation rates of viruses, especially, RNA viruses. Here, we comprehensively review the effectiveness of several probiotics and paraprobiotics (sterilized probiotics) for the prevention or treatment of virally-induced infectious diseases. We discuss the unique roles of these agents in modulating the cross-talk between commensal bacteria and the mucosal immune system. In addition, we provide an overview of the unique mechanism by which viruses are eliminated through the stimulation of type 1 interferon production by probiotics and paraprobiotics via the activation of dendritic cells. Although further detailed research is necessary in the future, probiotics and/or paraprobiotics are expected to be among the rational adjunctive options for the treatment of various viral diseases.",

      "abstract": "Live yeast probiotics and yeast cell wall components (paraprobiotics) may serve as an alternative to the use of antibiotics in prevention and treatment of infections caused by pathogenic bacteria. Probiotics and paraprobiotics can bind directly to pathogens, which limits binding of the pathogens to the intestinal cells and also facilitates removal from the host. However, knowledge of bacterial binding, specificity, and/or capability is limited with regard to probiotics or paraprobiotics. The goal of this study was to characterize the qualitative and quantitative nature of two Saccharomyces cerevisiae probiotics and three S. cerevisiae paraprobiotics to adhere to thirteen different pathogenic bacteria using scanning electron miscroscopy and filtration assays. On average, the yeast probiotics (LYA and LYB) exhibited overall greater (P < 0.05) adhesion to the pathogenic bacteria tested (41% and 34%) in comparison to paraprobiotics (23%, 21%, and 22%), though variations were observed between pathogens tested. The ability of Salmonella and Listeria to utilize components of the yeast as a nutrient source was also tested. Bacteria were cultured in media with limited carbon and supplemented with cell free extracts of the probiotics and paraprobiotics. Salmonella exhibited growth, indicating these pathogens could utilize the yeast lysates as a carbon source. Listeria monocytogenes had limited growth in only one of the lysates tested. Together, these data indicate that the interaction between probiotics and paraprobiotics occurs in a strain dependent mechanism. Administration of probiotics and paraprobiotics as therapeutics therefore needs to be specific against the bacterial pathogen target."
