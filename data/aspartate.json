      "abstract": "Cadmium (Cd) is a widespread toxic heavy metal, and exposure to Cd is a growing environmental health concern. The molecular mechanism of Cd cytotoxicity is complicated and still not well understood, and treatment options for Cd cytotoxicity are lacking. Currently, only a limited number of Cd-targeted proteins have been identified. Here, we used Cd-immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography (Cd-IMAC) coupled with LC-MS/MS technique to detect putative Cd-binding proteins in human cells, and nucleophosmin (NPM1) was identified as the top Cd-binding protein. We found that Cd bound exclusively to the methionine/aspartate (M/D)-rich region (MEDSMDMDM) of NPM1, and NPM1 was essential for Cd-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, Cd could trigger intracellular nucleolar stress by causing nucleoplasmic translocation of NPM1 and decreasing pre-rRNA levels through binding to the M/D-rich region of NPM1. Interestingly, we discovered that a short peptide containing only the M/D-rich region of NPM1 could effectively mitigate Cd toxicity, both in vitro and in vivo. Specifically, the synthetic M/D-rich peptide demonstrated significant protection against Cd toxicity, particularly in the liver. It significantly reduced Cd concentration, suppressed the upregulation of blood ALT and AST levels, and alleviated liver inflammation in Cd-exposed BALB/c mice. This study reveals a novel mechanism of Cd cytotoxicity through NPM1-regulated nucleolar stress and apoptosis. Additionally, it identifies a short peptide with strong clinical potential to counteract Cd toxicity."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Kilohertz high-frequency electrical stimulation (KHES), an avant-garde neuromodulation strategy, is progressively emerging in the field of neuropathic pain management, showing its unique therapeutic potential. This study delves into the mechanisms by which KHES exerts therapeutic effects on neuropathic pain induced by chronic constriction injury (CCI) in mice through modulation of the calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII)/N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor 2B (NMDAR2B) signaling pathway. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this study, mice were randomly assigned to groups and received intrathecal injections of CaMKII activator BayK8644, CaMKII inhibitor KN93, and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA). Subsequently, mice underwent a week-long KHES treatment, with each session lasting 30 minutes. The impact of KHES on mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia in mice was assessed through paw withdrawal threshold and thermal withdrawal latency measurements, respectively. In addition, anxiety and depressive-like behaviors in mice were evaluated using pole climbing, open field, and forced swim tests. Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, Western blot, and immunofluorescence techniques were used to detect the expression levels of CaMKII, phosphorylated CaMKII (p-CaMKII), and NMDAR2B in the spinal cord. RESULTS: Results indicated that KHES not only significantly reduced mechanical allodynia in CCI mice, with a sustained analgesic effect lasting up to six hours, but also somewhat alleviated anxiety and depressive-like symptoms. KHES inhibited the expression of p-CaMKII and NMDAR2B in the spinal cord. This inhibitory effect was reversed in the presence of BayK8644 and NMDA, suggesting that activation of CaMKII and NMDAR2B may contribute to the maintenance of neuropathic pain. Conversely, KN93 enhanced the analgesic effect of KHES by reducing mechanical allodynia and downregulating p-CaMKII and NMDAR2B expression, further confirming the significance of the CaMKII/NMDAR2B signaling pathway in KHES-mediated neuropathic pain relief. CONCLUSION: This study not only unveils the potential therapeutic value of KHES in treating neuropathic pain induced by CCI in mice but also provides insights into its molecular mechanisms of action through inhibition of the CaMKII/NMDAR2B signaling pathway."

      "abstract": "The effective treatment of neurological diseases, particularly Alzheimer's disease (AD), is a significant source of frustration for drug discovery scientists. The lengthy process of drug discovery further makes this task exceedingly challenging. To enable a rapid stride in drug discovery, we focused on the drug repurposing strategy to identify new N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) inhibitors from the pool of 1827 approved USFDA drugs. The high throughput virtual screening (HTVS) followed by molecular docking and molecular mechanics studies enabled us to identify two drugs, Ertugliflozin (Dock Score: -9.43 kcal/mol, MMGBSA: -104.50 kcal/mol) and Selpercatinib (Dock Score: 8.11 kcal/mol, MMGBSA: 83.62 kcal/mol), with a high affinity towards the NMDAR. The molecular dynamics analysis on these identified drugs led us to choose Ertugliflozin for its better stability as a lead for further studies. The corroboration of in silico findings led us to deduce that Ertugliflozin can inhibit NMDAR with an IC50 of 613.19 nM. These results were confirmed by the anti-NMDAR ELISA-based analysis, which was further deduced via western blotting. The work is further supported by strong literature evidence that concludes the impact of antidiabetic molecules on AD progression, along with the evidence that Ertugliflozin possesses efficacy against AD with unequivocal evidence on the biological target and the mechanism. Further work, however, is required to establish this association in the in vivo or suitable model that could mimic the AD microenvironment as a part of future research."

      "abstract": "Gastrointestinal (GI) dysfunction emerges years before motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease (PD), implicating the enteric nervous system (ENS) in early disease progression. However, the mechanisms linking the PD hallmark protein, α-synuclein (α-syn), to ENS dysfunction - and whether these mechanisms are influenced by inflammation - remains elusive. Using iPSC-derived enteric neural lineages from patients with α-syn triplications, we reveal that TNF-α increases mitochondrial-α-syn interactions, disrupts the malate-aspartate shuttle, and forces a metabolic shift toward glutamine oxidation. These alterations drive mitochondrial dysfunction, characterizing metabolic impairment under cytokine stress. Interestingly, targeting glutamate metabolism with Chicago Sky Blue 6B restores mitochondrial function, reversing TNF-α-driven metabolic disruption. Our findings position the ENS as a central player in PD pathogenesis, establishing a direct link between cytokines, α-syn accumulation, metabolic stress and mitochondrial dysfunction. By uncovering a previously unrecognized metabolic vulnerability in the ENS, we highlight its potential as a therapeutic target for early PD intervention."

      "abstract": "Rice is one of the major sources of human exposure to arsenic (As), and its contamination is a critical issue for crop productivity and human health. Herein, we investigated how nano-calcium L-aspartate (nano-Ca) nanoparticles alleviate As-induced toxicity in rice (Oryzae sativa L.) seedlings. The results showed that As stress restricted rice growth and increased the concentration of As in roots and shoots. Application of nano-Ca markedly improved seedling growth, including biomass, photosynthetic pigment content, and antioxidant enzyme activity. As a result, Nano-Ca decreased As concentrations in shoots and roots by 67.04 % and 22.78 %, respectively, primarily due to the increasing accumulation of As in pectin and hemicellulose. Furthermore, nano-Ca elevated the activity of nitrogen-metabolizing enzymes. The treatment also promoted demethylation of pectin, which enhanced its As-binding capability. Additionally, nano-Ca enhanced proline metabolism, also provided antioxidant defenses, and regulated calcium homeostasis, which help mitigate oxidative damage characteristics like malondialdehyde and hydrogen peroxidation. As these findings demonstrated, nano-Ca could be an efficient, friendly means of alleviating As toxicity in rice, offering an environmentally sustainable option for agricultural strategies in the arsenic-contaminated areas."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Cognitive dysfunction may be a sequelae of N-Methyl-D-Aspartate receptor encephalitis (NMDAR encephalitis) with working memory commonly affected. This study examined cognitive outcomes in patients treated for NMDAR encephalitis using a neurocognitive test battery and a working memory paradigm, compared with healthy controls & patients with schizophrenia. METHODS: Adult patients previously treated for NMDAR encephalitis were assessed using the Cambridge Automated Neuropsychological Test Battery (CANTAB) for working memory & episodic memory. Patients completed the N-back task during functional MRI (fMRI) scanning. Results were compared to patients with schizophrenia and healthy controls from a prior study. RESULTS: Twelve patients were recruited [11 women; mean (SD) age 37(12) years; Mean (SD) duration until immunotherapy treatment 7.09 (2.43) weeks]. Data were compared to 14 patients with schizophrenia [10 women; mean (SD) age 39 (12) years] and 14 healthy controls [7 women; mean (SD) age 30 (6) years]. Significant differences in letter number sequencing, spatial working memory, logical memory I, 1-back, and 2-back performance were observed (Cohen's d = 0.766 to 1.254, p< 0.05), driven by poorer performance by patients with schizophrenia. While patients with NMDAR encephalitis exhibited slightly lower performance compared with healthy controls, none of these differences were statistically significant. No significant differences in neural activation during 1-back or 2-back performance were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Study findings suggest cognitive performance in patients treated for NMDAR encephalitis approaches normal over time. Prompt treatment with immunotherapy is associated with improved cognitive outcomes. Psychiatric services should be aware of the clinical features of autoimmune encephalitis.",

Surgical removal of these teratomas, combined with immunotherapy, results in rapid improvement in about half of patients. However, the remaining patients exhibit slower improvement and are at risk of severe complications. Additional surgeries may be considered for these patients. Since even microscopic teratomas can contribute to treatment resistance, complete removal of the remaining ovaries is often selected as a surgical approach. However, this approach results in loss of fertility. We report the case of a 28-year-old woman with bilateral ovarian teratomas and a refractory clinical course after initial treatment, including left salpingo-oophorectomy and right cystectomy. She underwent two additional surgeries, one for a residual teratoma and the other for a recurrent teratoma, both involving cystectomies aimed at preserving fertility. She was discharged home a year after admission and gave birth to a baby two years later. Our case is unique in that three surgeries were performed for an anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis patient with teratomas without loss of fertility, and it documents the reproductive outcome of the patient."

Here, we present a unique case of a 27-year-old female patient diagnosed with anti-NMDAR encephalitis, where Lyme disease emerges as a plausible yet underrecognized trigger. The patient initially presented to the emergency department (ED) with acute psychosis and was later found to have positive Borrelia burgdorferi immunoglobulin G (IgG) titers, antibodies against the NR1 subunit of NMDA, and subacute thyroiditis. A detailed investigation ruled out other paraneoplastic or infectious causes, pointing to Lyme disease as the most likely precipitant. Notably, her exposure to B. burgdorferi preceded the onset of encephalitis by two years. Treatment with immunotherapy and antibiotics resulted in significant clinical improvement. This case highlights the importance of a thorough evaluation of potential triggers of anti-NMDAR encephalitis, emphasizing that it should not be presumed idiopathic without exhaustive investigation. Awareness of Lyme disease as a possible etiological factor may facilitate more targeted management, reduce prolonged hospital stays, and mitigate the burden of extensive diagnostic workups. By addressing the root cause, clinicians can improve patient outcomes and prevent disease recurrence or complications associated with empiric treatment alone."

At presentation, she was able to engage in conversation and follow instructions, but exhibited slight fever, sensory abnormalities, and non-stereotypical seizures. Over the course of two weeks, she fell into a catatonic stupor. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis revealed only mild pleocytosis with CSF-restricted oligoclonal bands. Electroencephalogram, which was unremarkable at presentation, subsequently showed an extreme delta brush pattern. NMDAR antibodies were detected in CSF with two independent assays, confirming the diagnosis of anti-NMDAR encephalitis. First-line immunotherapy with steroids, plasma exchange, and immunoglobulins was ineffective, but second-line immunotherapy with cyclophosphamide led to improvement. This case underscores the importance of considering anti-NMDAR encephalitis in patients with PNES-mimicking episodes, which can be misleading and delay appropriate diagnosis and treatment."

      "abstract": "N-Methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) is gaining increasing interest as a pharmacological target for the development of fast-acting antidepressants. (S)-Methadone (esmethadone), has recently shown promising efficacy for the treatment of major depressive disorder. However, methods for its enantiopure preparation still rely on complex and expensive resolution procedures. In addition, enantiopure methadone metabolites have never been evaluated for their NMDAR activity. Here, we report the development of a novel chiral pool approach, based on cyclic sulfamidate ring-opening reaction, for the asymmetric synthesis of (R)- and (S)-methadone, and the application of this methodology to the stereodivergent synthesis of 20 enantiopure methadone metabolites. The compounds were evaluated for their NMDAR antagonism and for their affinity toward a series of relevant CNS receptors. Strikingly, N-demethylated (6R)-methadol metabolites retain the higher NMDAR uncompetitive antagonism of (R)-methadone, while presenting lower opioid receptor affinity compared to (S)-methadone. These compounds could represent novel candidates for drug development in CNS disorders.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Electroporation (EP) leverages electric pulses to permeabilize cell membranes, enabling the delivery of therapeutic agents like calcium in cancer treatment. Calcium electroporation (CaEP) induces a rapid influx of calcium ions, disrupting cellular calcium homeostasis and triggering cell death pathways. This study aims to compare the cellular responses between microsecond (µsEP) and nanosecond (nsEP) electroporation, particularly in terms of oxidative stress, immune response activation, and cancer stem cell (CSC) viability in drug-resistant (LoVo Dx) and non-resistant (LoVo) colorectal cancer cell lines. RESULTS: Both µsEP and nsEP, particularly when combined with Ca2+, significantly reduced the viability of cancer cells, with nsEP showing greater efficacy. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels increased 5-fold in malignant cells following nsEP, correlating with decreased ATP production and mitochondrial dysfunction. Nanosecond CaEP (nsCaEP) also induced significant expression of aspartate-β-hydroxylase (ASPH), a protein linked to calcium homeostasis and tumor progression. Moreover, nsEP led to heightened expression of heat shock proteins (HSP27/70), indicating potential immune activation. Interestingly, nsEP without calcium drastically reduced the expression of CD133, a marker for CSCs, while the addition of Ca2+ preserved CD133 expression. The expression of death effector domain-containing DNA binding protein (DEDD), associated with apoptosis, was significantly elevated in treated cancer cells, especially in the nucleus after nsCaEP. CONCLUSIONS: The study confirms that nsEP is more effective than µsEP in disrupting cancer cell viability, enhancing oxidative stress, and triggering immune responses, likely through HSP overexpression and ROS generation. nsEP also appears to reduce CSC viability, offering a promising therapeutic approach. However, preserving CD133 expression in the presence of calcium suggests complex interactions that require further investigation. These findings highlight the potential of nsCaEP as an innovative strategy for targeting both cancer cells and CSCs, potentially improving treatment outcomes in colorectal cancer. Further studies are needed to explore the exact cell death mechanisms and optimize protocols for clinical applications.",

STUDY DESIGN: Analytical study. Place and Duration of the Study: The Second Hospital of Shandong University, Jian, China, and Weifang People's Hospital, China, from January 2016 to 2024. METHODOLOGY: A total of 166 patients with hepatitis B-related decompensated cirrhosis without antiviral treatment were included. All patients were observed for a minimum of 18 months. The main result is recompensation, defined as the latest Baveno VII restitution standard. The predictive value of the APRI was assessed by using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and logistics regression model. RESULTS: In the group with baseline aspartate aminotransferase (AST) ≤40 U/L, APRI was identified as an independent predictor of recompensation in patients with hepatitis B-related decompensated cirrhosis (OR 0.04, 95% CI: 0.002 - 0.686, p = 0.026). For patients treated with nucleos(t)ide analogues (NAs), lower APRI was related to the higher rate of recompensation (OR 0.466, 95% CI: 0.291 - 0.747, p = 0.002). In the baseline AST ≤40 group and in the data one year after antiviral treatment, the AUROCs for APRI diagnosis of liver cirrhosis were 0.813 and 0.723, respectively. CONCLUSION: APRI may be used as an independent predictor of recompensation in patients with hepatitis B-related decompensated cirrhosis, particularly in patients undergoing NAs therapy and with low AST levels.

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: This study aimed to investigate the association between the aspartate aminotransferase-to-alanine aminotransferase (AST/ALT) ratio and metabolic syndrome (MetS) among HIV-infected patients on dolutegravir-based antiretroviral therapy (ART). PATIENTS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted on 377 adults on dolutegravir-based ART for at least one year. Data were collected from July 1 to August 15, 2024. Participants were systematically sampled, data were collected using a pre-tested questionnaire, anthropometric measurements were taken, and blood samples were collected for biochemical analysis. A low AST/ALT ratio was defined as ≤ 1 and MetS as the presence of at least three of the following: central obesity, fasting hyperglycemia, elevated triglycerides, low HDL-C, and hypertension (International Diabetes Federation (IDF) Consensus worldwide definition, 2006). Logistic regression was used to assess the association between low AST/ALT ratio and MetS, and receiver operating curve (ROC) analysis was conducted to evaluate its predictive performance. RESULTS: The median age of the participants was 44 years (interquartile range (IQR): 30-59), with 56.2% being female. The prevalence of MetS was 35.3% (133/377, 95%CI: 30.6-40.3). A significant association was found between low AST/ALT ratio and MetS (aOR: 2.19, 95% CI: 1.28-3.73, p = 0.004). Female gender (adjusted odds ratio (aOR): 3.68, 95% CI: 2.07-6.55, p < 0.001) and smoking (aOR: 3.96, 95% CI: 1.77-8.86, p < 0.001) were also significantly associated with MetS. The ALT/AST ratio had a significant predictive power for MetS (AUC = 0.583, 95% CI: 0.523-0.643). CONCLUSION: The prevalence of MetS is high. A low AST/ALT ratio is significantly associated with MetS, making it a potential biomarker among HIV patients on ART."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Biliary atresia (BA) is a severe paediatric liver disease causing cirrhosis without prompt treatment. Aspartate aminotransferase-to-platelet ratio index (APRi), a non-invasive biomarker, shows promise in assessing fibrosis and cirrhosis severity, offering an alternative to liver biopsy. However, standardised criteria and research on APRi accuracy in paediatric BA, especially across diverse populations, remain limited. OBJECTIVES: To assess the correlation between APRi values, liver fibrosis and cirrhosis severity in children with BA, evaluate APRi's diagnostic accuracy and clinical utility, and identify appropriate cut-off values for significant fibrosis and cirrhosis. METHODS: This systematic review and meta-analysis, conducted per PRISMA guidelines, evaluated non-invasive biomarkers for liver fibrosis in BA patients. Data were managed using REDCap and analysed with R software. Heterogeneity was assessed with the Cochrane Q test and I2 values. RESULTS: Fourteen studies (retrospective, prospective, and one cross-sectional) examined APRi and liver fibrosis in BA. APRi cut-off values for diagnosing fibrosis and cirrhosis ranged from 0.7 to 2.26 for advanced fibrosis (F3). The meta-analysis provided pooled means and 95% confidence intervals for APRi, assessing its diagnostic performance. Significant heterogeneity was noted in studies with favourable histology, while none was observed in those with unfavourable histology, highlighting variability in APRi values. CONCLUSION: Limited patient numbers and significant heterogeneity across studies impeded the establishment of a definitive threshold for identifying unfavourable histology in BA. Consequently, APRi's clinical utility remains unclear. Further research is required to determine its precise role as a biopsy surrogate and in clinical decision-making during BA diagnosis.

Rats that underwent NMDA receptor blockade during the neonatal period have been validated as models of schizophrenia. Social facilitation, a phenomenon where an individual's performance is promoted in the presence of others, reflects the ability to regulate behavior depending on social situations and is likely to be disrupted in schizophrenia. This study investigated the effects of neonatal treatment with MK-801, an NMDA receptor antagonist, on the social facilitation of feeding behavior in adult rats. Under noncompetitive conditions, SAL-treated control rats showed increased food intake when feeding with another rat, whereas MK-801-treated rats did not. Under competitive conditions, SAL-treated rats tended to feed more in the presence of a competitor compared to feeding alone. In contrast, MK-801-treated rats exhibited a significant reduction in food intake in the presence of a competitor. Thus, MK-801-treated rats demonstrated a lack of social facilitation under noncompetitive conditions and social inhibition under competitive conditions. These findings suggest that neonatal NMDA receptor blockade disrupts the ability of rats to regulate their behavior depending on their social situation. Our findings may provide new insights into the social deficits associated with schizophrenia and their underlying mechanisms.",

      "abstract": "Aspartate (Asp) metabolism-mediated antioxidant functions have important implications for neonatal growth and intestinal health; however, the antioxidant mechanisms through which Asp regulates the gut microbiota and influences RIP activation remain elusive. This study reports that chronic oxidative stress disrupts gut microbiota and metabolite balance and that such imbalance is intricately tied to the perturbation of Asp metabolism. Under normal conditions, in vivo and in vitro studies reveal that exogenous Asp improves intestinal health by regulating epithelial cell proliferation, nutrient uptake, and apoptosis. During oxidative stress, Asp reduces Megasphaera abundance while increasing Ruminococcaceae. This reversal effect depends on the enhanced production of the antioxidant eicosapentaenoic acid mediated through Asp metabolism and microbiota. Mechanistically, the application of exogenous Asp orchestrates the antioxidant responses in enterocytes via the modulation of the RIP3-MLKL and RIP1-Nrf2-NF-κB pathways to eliminate excessive reactive oxygen species and maintain mitochondrial functionality and cellular survival. These results demonstrate that Asp signaling alleviates oxidative stress by dynamically modulating the gut microbiota and RIP-dependent mitochondrial function, providing a potential therapeutic strategy for oxidative stress disease treatment.",

This study aims to spot a routinely tested parameter with discriminative, predictive and prognostic value to enhance CURB-65's prognostic accuracy in CAP patients with T2DM. METHODS: We retrospectively studied consecutive CAP patients from 2020 to 2021, comparing laboratory parameters between patients with and without T2DM. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, univariate and multivariate logistic regression were used to identify key parameters. The area under the ROC curve (AUC), Fagan's nomogram, net reclassification improvement (NRI), and integrated discrimination improvement (IDI) evaluated the added predictive accuracy. RESULTS: A total of 720 patients were included, comprising 180 diabetic CAP patients and 540 non-diabetic controls after matching for age, gender, and comorbidities through propensity score matching. In diabetic CAP patients, the aspartate aminotransferase/alanine aminotransferase (AST/ALT) ratio showed the highest AUC (0.676, 95% CI, 0.575-0.776) among laboratory parameters with different distributions between the groups. AST/ALT was also identified as an independent predictor of poor treatment outcome (OR = 3.672, 95% CI, 1.455-9.268, p = 0.006). Adding AST/ALT to CURB-65 slightly increased the AUC, but remarkably enhanced NRI and IDI (AUC, 0.756 vs. 0.782, p = 0.017; continuous NRI, 0.635, 95% CI, 0.304-0.966, p < 0.001; categorical NRI, 0.175, 95% CI, 0.044-0.307, p = 0.009; IDI, 0.043, 95% CI, 0.006-0.080, p = 0.021). An AST/ALT ratio of ≥ 1.625 conferred a 74% post-test probability of poor treatment outcome, while < 1.625 predicted 21%. AST/ALT also predicted outcomes for all the CAP patients enrolled (OR = 1.771, 95% CI, 1.231-2.549, p = 0.002). Predictive accuracy improved after incorporating AST/ALP into CURB-65 in these population (AUC, 0.615 vs. 0.645, p = 0.038; continuous NRI, 0.357, 95% CI, 0.196-0.517, p < 0.001; categorical NRI, 0.264, 95% CI, 0.151-0.376, p < 0.001; IDI, 0.019, 95% CI, 0.008-0.029, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: AST/ALT was identified as a discriminative, predictive and prognostic factor for CAP patients with T2DM. The integration of AST/ALT into CURB-65 enhanced outcome prediction for both diabetic and non-diabetic CAP patients.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor encephalitis (anti-NMDARE) is a prevalent type of autoimmune encephalitis caused by antibodies targeting the NMDAR's GluN1 subunit. While significant progress has been made in elucidating the pathophysiology of autoimmune diseases, the immunological mechanisms underlying anti-NMDARE remain elusive. This study aimed to characterize immune cell interactions and dysregulation in anti-NMDARE by leveraging single-cell multi-omics sequencing technologies. METHODS: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from patients in the acute phase of anti-NMDARE and healthy controls were sequenced using single-cell joint profiling of transcriptome and chromatin accessibility. Differential gene expression analysis, transcription factor activity profiling, and cell-cell communication modeling were performed to elucidate the immune mechanisms underlying the disease. In parallel, single-cell B cell receptor sequencing (scBCR-seq) and repertoire analysis were conducted to assess antigen-driven clonal expansion within the B cell population. RESULTS: The study revealed a significant clonal expansion of B cells, particularly plasma cells, in anti-NMDARE patients. The novel finding of type I interferon (IFN-I) pathway activation suggests a regulatory mechanism that may drive this expansion and enhance antibody secretion. Additionally, activation of Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) in myeloid cells was noted, which may connect to tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) secretion. This cytokine may contribute to the activation of B and T cells, thereby perpetuating immune dysregulation. CONCLUSIONS: This study presents a comprehensive single-cell multi-omics characterization of immune dysregulation in anti-NMDARE, highlighting the expansion of B cell and the activation of the IFN-I and TLR2 pathways. These findings provide deeper insights into the molecular mechanism driving the pathogenesis of anti-NMDARE and offer promising targets for future therapeutic intervention. KEY POINTS: Significant B cell clonal expansion, particularly in plasma cells, driven by antigen recognition. IFN-I pathway activation in plasma cells boosts their antibody production and potentially exacerbates immune dysregulation. TLR2 pathway activation in myeloid cells contributes to TNF-α secretion and could influence adaptive immune responses.",

      "abstract": "Objective: To establish a mouse model of anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) encephalitis and assess the potential therapeutic benefits of D-serine supplementation in mitigating synaptic plasticity impairments induced by anti-NMDAR antibodies. Methods: Anti-NMDAR antibodies were purified from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples of patients diagnosed with anti-NMDAR encephalitis and verified using a cell-based assay. CSF from patients with non-inflammatory neurological diseases served as the control. These antibodies were then injected intraventricularly into C57BL/6 mice. Forty-eight hours following the injection, mice were administered either D-serine (500 mg/kg) or sterile saline intraperitoneally for three consecutive days. Subsequent analyses included Western blotting, immunofluorescence, electrophysiological studies, and a series of behavioral tests to assess pathological changes caused by anti-NMDAR antibodies. Results: Mice injected with anti-NMDAR antibodies exhibited a significant reduction in hippocampal long-term potentiation compared to controls, which was notably ameliorated by D-serine treatment. Additionally, these mice displayed decreased levels of hippocampal membrane NMDAR1 protein and postsynaptic NMDAR1 density. However, D-serine administration did not significantly alter these conditions. Notably, no significant behavioral differences were observed between mice injected with anti-NMDAR antibodies and controls in open fields, elevated plus maze, novel object recognition, or Morris water maze tests. Conclusions: Our findings indicate that exogenous D-serine can improve hippocampal plasticity impairments caused by anti-NMDAR antibodies but does not reverse the decreased expression of NMDAR. Furthermore, a single intraventricular injection of patients' antibodies was insufficient to induce anti-NMDAR encephalitis-related behaviors in mice."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: This study aimed to assess the diagnosis of macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) at the onset of active childhood-onset systemic lupus erythematosus (cSLE), which is under-researched, and to compare the characteristics of cSLE with and without MAS, hypothesizing the existence of possible predictors of MAS in active cSLE. METHODS: This study enrolled 157 patients diagnosed with cSLE, with or without MAS, from Nanjing Medical University between January 2018 and May 2023. Data analysis was performed using an independent samples t-test or the Mann-Whitney U-test, the χ 2 test, the Youden index to determine the optimal cutoff values for diagnosis, and binary logistic regression analysis to determine the predicted probability. RESULTS: Fifteen patients (9%) had MAS in the active phase, with an SLE disease activity index of 16.6 (range, 6-32). Bone marrow aspirations revealed hemophagocytosis in 8/15 cases (53%). Fever was the most common feature of MAS patients. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and ferritin levels were elevated in the patients. Lower leukocyte, neutrophil, and platelet counts, including serum sodium and fibrinogen, and increased alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), ferritin, triglyceride, and D-dimer levels occurred in MAS patients, unlike those without MAS. Optimal cutoff values for ferritin (≥607.35 ng/ml), LDH (≥424 U/L), and AST (≥61 U/L) were predictors of MAS occurrence in cSLE. No MAS patients experienced recurrence during an 18-month mean follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the narrow scope of the study, elevated levels of ferritin, LDH, and AST may represent indicators of cSLE complicated by MAS. Early diagnosis and treatment may improve outcomes."

      "abstract": "Gastrointestinal dysfunction is a severe and common complication in diabetic patients. Some evidence shows that gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and glutamate contribute to diabetic gastrointestinal abnormalities. Therefore, we examined the impact of prolonged treatment with insulin and magnesium supplements on the expression pattern of GABA type A (GABA-A), GABA-B, and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) glutamate receptors as well as nitric oxide synthase 1 (NOS-1) in the stomach of type 2 diabetic rats. Twenty-four male Wistar rats were randomized to four groups (six rats each): 1) control, 2) type 2 diabetes: rats fed with a high-fat diet for three months + a low dose of streptozotocin (35 mg/kg), 3) type 2 diabetes + magnesium, and 4) type 2 diabetes + insulin. The expression of NOS-1, GABA-A, GABA-B, and NMDA receptors was detected using western blotting. The NOS-1 expression was substantially diminished (P<0.01), while the expression of GABA-A (P<0.001), GABA-B (P<0.001), and NMDA (P<0.001) receptors was enhanced in the stomach of diabetic rats relative to control. Treatment with magnesium and insulin improved NOS-1 expression in diabetic rats, although this effect was greater in magnesium treatment alone. Magnesium also restored the expression of GABA-A and GABA-B receptors in diabetic rats to control values. Moreover, insulin treatment improved GABA-A receptor expression in diabetic rats (P<0.05). No considerable alterations were detected in NMDA receptor levels in the treatment groups. The results suggest a significant role of magnesium and insulin in improving gastric motility and secretory disorders associated with diabetes through modifying the expression of GABAergic receptors.",

We report the case of a 24-year-old female with no significant medical history, who developed severe anxiety, memory deficits, and confusion over a two-week period. Neurological examination revealed cognitive dysfunction, asymmetric limb movements, and psychosis. MRI showed bilateral medial temporal lobe hyperintensities, more pronounced on the left, and CSF analysis confirmed elevated protein levels and positive anti-NMDA receptor antibodies. Treatment with high-dose corticosteroids and intravenous immunoglobulin led to significant improvement within three weeks, with a follow-up MRI showing a reduction in lesion size. This case underscores the importance of early diagnosis, particularly when atypical presentations, such as asymmetric temporal lobe involvement, are observed. Awareness of this condition, especially in young women, is critical for timely intervention and management, given its potential association with ovarian teratomas."

Patients frequently present with psychiatric symptoms or cognitive impairments such as speech disturbances, decreased level of consciousness, autonomic dysfunction, as well as seizures, dyskinesias, and catatonia due to overactivation of extrasynaptic NMDA receptors. To date, there is no gold standard for the diagnosis of catatonia; however, a few rating scales exist to measure this phenomenon, with the Bush Francis Catatonia Rating Scale being the most commonly used due to its validity, reliability, and ease of application. In this case, we present a 19-year-old female who experienced onset symptoms including fluctuating headaches, dysthymia, tinnitus, and prosopagnosia. Eventually, she experienced spatial disorientation and hypoesthesia in the left hemiface, along with insomnia. Subsequently, she reported alterations in perception, accompanied by urinary and fecal incontinence. Upon admission, the patient presented as catatonic. The lumbar puncture revealed normal cell counts, proteins, and glucose levels, along with the presence of reactive anti-NMDAR antibodies in serum and electroencephalogram findings indicating generalized dysfunction, meeting Graus criteria for probable encephalitis. A CT scan revealed a left adnexal mass consistent with an ovarian teratoma. Management commenced with methylprednisolone boluses and plasma exchanges. This case underlines the importance of ongoing research and collaboration in refining treatment strategies for autoimmune encephalitis patients to improve outcomes and quality of life."

      "abstract": "Schizophrenia (SCZ) is a severe psychotic disorder characterized by a disruption in glutamatergic NMDA receptor (NMDAR)-mediated neurotransmission. Compelling evidence has revealed that NMDAR activation is not limited to L-glutamate, L-aspartate, and glycine since other free amino acids (AAs) in the atypical D-configuration, such as D-aspartate and D-serine, also modulate this class of glutamatergic receptors. Although dysregulation of AAs modulating NMDARs has been previously reported in SCZ, it remains unclear whether distinct variations of these biomolecules occur during illness progression from at-risk premorbid to clinically manifest stage. To probe this issue, we used High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) to measure serum levels of D- and L-AAs that stimulate NMDARs across four groups of individuals diagnosed with (a) At-Risk Mental State (ARMS) for psychosis, (b) First Episode of Psychosis (FEP), (c) full-blown SCZ and (d) Healthy Donors (HD). We examined how diagnosis, demographic features, and antipsychotic treatment influence the variation of AA levels throughout psychosis progression. Finally, we explored the potential association between AA blood concentrations and clinical and cognitive measures related to psychosis. Our findings identified inter-group differences in serum AA composition, highlighting that the upregulation of D-serine/total serine and D-aspartate/total aspartate ratios represent a peculiar blood biochemical signature of early stages of psychosis progression, while increased L-glutamate, L-aspartate and glycine associate with chronic SCZ diagnosis. The present findings provide direct evidence for early dysregulation of D-AA metabolism and have potential implications for the identification of biomarkers for the early detection and staging of psychosis."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To investigate the prognostic value of albumin (ALB), aspartate aminotransferase/alanine aminotransferase ratio (AST/ALT) in patients with acute liver failure (ALF) in hyperacute phase of sepsis which provided the basis for clinical evaluation and prognostic judgment and corresponding treatment options. METHODS: A multicenter retrospective cohort study was conducted. Patients with ALF in hyperacute phase of sepsis admitted to Zhoupu Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Health College, Shanghai Pudong New Area People's Hospital, and Shanghai Oriental Hospital from January 2019 to February 2024 were enrolled. General data such as gender and age of the patients were collected. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), liver function indexes [total bilirubin (TBIL), direct bilirubin (DBIL), AST, ALT, AST/ALT, ALB, total protein (TP), globulin (GLB), ALB/GLB ratio (A/G), blood amine, γ-glutamyl transpeptidase (γ-GT)], platelet count (PLT), creatinine, activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), severity of illness scores [acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II (APACHE II), sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA)], serum procalcitonin (PCT), N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), arterial blood lactic acid (Lac) within 24 hours after admission, and whether to use mechanical ventilation, whether to use vasoactive drugs, whether to use artificial liver treatment and prognosis during hospitalization also were collected. The differences of clinical data between patients with different prognosis were compared. The variables with statistically significant differences in univariate analysis were included in multivariate Logistic regression analysis to determine the independent risk factors for death of patients with ALF in hyperacute phase of sepsis during hospitalization. The receiver operator characteristic curve (ROC curve) was drawn to evaluate the predictive value of ALB and AST/ALT for death of patients with ALF in hyperacute phase of sepsis during hospitalization. RESULTS: A total of 73 patients with ALF in hyperacute phase of sepsis were included, with 22 survived and 51 died during hospitalization and the mortality of 69.86%. Compared with the survival group, the patients in the death group had lower ALB, γ-GT within 24 hours after admission and proportion of artificial liver treatment, and higher AST/ALT, SOFA score, LDH and proportion of use of vasoactive drugs. The differences were statistically significant. Multivariate Logistic regression analysis showed that ALB and AST/ALT were the independent risk factors for death in patients with ALF in hyperacute phase of sepsis during hospitalization [ALB: odds ratio (OR) = 0.856, 95% confidence interval (95%CI) was 0.736-0.996, P = 0.044; AST/ALT: OR = 2.018, 95%CI was 1.137-3.580, P = 0.016]. ROC curve analysis showed that the area under the curve (AUC) of ALB for predicting in-hospital death in patients with ALF in hyperacute phase of sepsis was 0.760 (95%CI was 0.637-0.884, P < 0.001). When ALB ≤ 29.05 g/L, the sensitivity was 68.2%, and the specificity was 76.5%. The AUC of AST/ALT for predicting in-hospital death in patients with ALF in hyperacute phase of sepsis was 0.764 (95%CI was 0.639-0.888, P < 0.001). When AST/ALT ≥ 1.26, the sensitivity was 59.1%, and the specificity was 90.2%. CONCLUSIONS: The lower the ALB level, and the higher the AST/ALT within 24 hours after admission, the worse the prognosis of patients with ALF in hyperacute phase of sepsis. ALB and AST/ALT can be used as clinical indicators to evaluate the severity and prognosis of patients with ALF in hyperacute phase of sepsis.",

Treatment typically involves immunotherapy and tumor removal to mitigate the autoimmune response. Timely diagnosis and treatment are critical to prevent severe neurological impairment or death. Memantine, an NMDA receptor antagonist, has shown variable effectiveness in treating NMDARE according to several case reports, yet comprehensive analyses remain scarce. This mini review draws on five literature sources and eight case studies from databases including PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library, and Web of Science, highlighting both the potential and risks of memantine as an adjunct therapy. We explore how memantine may reduce symptoms by blocking excessive NMDA receptor (NMDAR) antibody binding, while potentially worsening symptoms by reducing extracellular NMDAR availability, thus impairing neuronal communication. This dual effect calls for further investigation into the optimal use and duration of memantine treatment in NMDARE management."

      "abstract": "Plasmepsin II (PlmII) belongs to the aspartate proteases and is involved in hemoglobin degradation in Plasmodium falciparum. Due to its critical role in the survival of the Plasmodium, PlmII is considered as a potent drug target for antimalarial therapy. We have done recombinant protein production of pro-plasmepsin II (Pro-plmII). Pro-PlmII was further activated to mature form (mPlmII) and its activity was confirmed by enzyme kinetics studies. The fluorescence spectroscopic and isothermal titration calorimetric studies show that fluoroquinolone-based antibiotic drugs norfloxacin, ciprofloxacin, and sparfloxacin bind with mPlmII. Molecular docking results show that only norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin are able to bind at the active site of mPlmII via hydrogen binding and hydrophobic interactions. Enzyme kinetics analysis reveals that norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin effectively inhibit mPlmII activity, while sparfloxacin does not exhibit any inhibitory effect on the enzyme's catalytic function. The two methyl groups on the 3rd and 5th carbon atoms of the piperazine ring make sparfloxacin unable to go inside mPlmII and bind at its active site. Overall, the results here suggested that fluoroquinolone-based antibiotic drugs norfloxacin, and ciprofloxacin, can be repurposed as antimalarial inhibitors targeting aspartic proteases. These findings contribute to pave the way for potential therapeutic interventions targeted at malaria.",

N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor is primarily seen in young females. Although this disease can be treated, it can relapse in rare cases. Relapsing typically occurs within the early years following the initial episode and is exceedingly rare after 5 years. CASE PRESENTATION: In this case study, we report on a 16-year-old Iranian female experiencing a relapse of anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor encephalitis 8 years after her initial diagnosis. She was admitted to the hospital with dysphasia (a speech disorder) and dyslexia (reading and writing impairment). A thorough clinical evaluation revealed the presence of anti-glutamate receptor type N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antibodies in her serum and cerebrospinal fluid, confirming the diagnosis. Following treatment with immunotherapy and plasmapheresis, she made a complete recovery. CONCLUSION: This case of relapsing anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor encephalitis, occurring more than 5 years after the initial episode, is exceptionally rare. This late relapse underscores the importance of long-term follow-up for patients with this condition.",

      "abstract": "Integrins, an important superfamily of cell adhesion receptors, play an essential role in cancer progression, metastasis, and angiogenesis, establishing them as prime targets for both diagnostic and therapeutic applications. Despite their significant potential, integrin-targeted therapies have faced substantial challenges in clinical trials, including variable efficacy and unmet high expectations. Nevertheless, the consistent expression of integrins on tumor and stromal cells underscores their ongoing relevance and potential. Traditional RGD-based imaging and therapeutic agents have faced limitations, such as inconsistent target expression and rapid systemic clearance, which have reduced their effectiveness. To overcome these challenges, recent research has focused on advancing RGD-based strategies and exploring innovative solutions. This review offers a thorough analysis of the latest developments in the RGD-integrin field, with a particular focus on addressing previous limitations. It delves into new dual-targeting approaches and cutting-edge RGD-based agents designed to improve both tumor diagnosis and therapeutic outcomes. By examining these advancements, this review illuminates new pathways for enhancing the specificity and efficacy of integrin-targeted therapies, paving the way for more effective cancer diagnosis and treatment strategies."

      "abstract": "Osmotic shock is the first step of high salt or drought action that involves biochemical and molecular changes during plant response to these unfavorable conditions. Indole-3-acetyl-aspartate (IAA-aspartate, IAA-Asp) is the main amide conjugate of auxin in pea (Pisum sativum L.) tissues. Although the exact molecular mechanism of the IAA-Asp action is unknown, this conjugate's indole-3-acetic acid (IAA)-independent biological activity has been observed during physiological and stress conditions. In this work, we investigated the effect of IAA-Asp alone, as well as in combination with NaCl or polyethylene glycol (PEG) (osmotic shock) on reduced/oxidized glutathione (GSH/GSSG) ratio, activities of enzymes modulating glutathione concentration, protein S-glutathionylation, and IAA homeostasis. We did not observe the hydrolysis of IAA-Asp to IAA in pea seedlings, which, together with other results, suggests that IAA-Asp modulates plant response to abiotic stimuli independently of IAA. Moreover, despite the effect of IAA-Asp on the enzymes responsible for IAA conjugation, no changes in this phytohormone level were visible. Furthermore, 3h plant treatment with IAA-Asp increased the activity of glutathione reductase (GR), which correlates with an elevated GSH/GSSG ratio. On the contrary, more extended (48h) incubation with IAA-Asp diminished the GSH/GSSG ratio and increased the activity of glutathione peroxidase (GPX). IAA-Asp reduced GR activity during salt treatment but did not affect the GSH/GSSG ratio. Similarly, under plant incubation with PEG, IAA-Asp did not change the GSH/GSSG ratio but increased glutathione S-transferase (GST) activity. We also analyzed the effect of IAA-Asp on pea protein S-glutathionylation. Increased S-glutathionylation of heat shock 70 kDa protein (HSP70) was observed after plant treatment with IAA-Asp, PEG, or IAA-Asp combined with PEG. The proteomic analysis also revealed that IAA-Asp diminished S-glutathionylation of lipoxygenase during plant incubation with PEG. Thus, we suggest that IAA-Asp modulates redox status in pea during oxidative stress and under normal physiological conditions.",

Taking into consideration their anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, anti-oxidant and antimicrobial properties, the present study has been designed to analyse the effect of zinc aspartate and zinc citrate treatment at therapeutic dose level on disease severity index, haematological, serological, antimicrobial and radiological markers of rheumatoid arthritis in Wistar rats. Bactericidal potential of the two organic zinc compounds was analysed in vitro in clinically isolated Escherichia coli. Arthritis was induced in male Wistar rats by intradermal injection of an emulsion containing collagen type II and Complete Freund's Adjuvant (CFA) containing 1 mg mL-1 Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Ra. Zinc aspartate and zinc citrate were orally administered after the onset of the disease for 4 weeks. Ameliorative effect of zinc aspartate and zinc citrate was evaluated by analysing indices of severity and disease activity markers of rheumatoid arthritis. The liver and kidney function tests were performed to evaluate any possible adverse effect of compounds. Antimicrobial activity of the zinc compounds was assessed in clinically isolated E. coli by MTT assay. Zinc aspartate and zinc citrate equivalent to a therapeutic dose of 50 mg/day of elemental zinc attenuated the clinical characteristic of rheumatoid arthritis in the animal model of arthritis, collagen-induced arthritis (CIA). Both zinc salts also exhibited antimicrobial effects against E. coli. The selected dose of zinc aspartate and zinc citrate showed no adverse effects in treated rats. This study highlights the potentiality of zinc compounds as antiarthritic agents and also point to its preventive effects on microbial growth that has been observed in rheumatoid arthritis patients due to their increased sensitivity for bacterial infection."

      "abstract": "AIMS: Obesity always leads to profound perturbation of metabolome. Metabolome studies enrich the knowledge on associations between endogenous metabolites and obesity, potentially providing innovative strategies for the development of novel anti-obesity pharmacotherapy. This study aims to identify an endogenous metabolite that regulates energy expenditure and to explore its application for obesity treatment. MATERIALS AND METHODS: C57BL/6 mice were fed with a high-fat and high-cholesterol (HFC) diet, comprising 60% fat and 1.2% cholesterol, for 12 weeks to induce obesity. Significant metabolites were identified in the livers of both health and obese mice through comparative hepatic metabolomics analysis. Correlation between serum or adipose L-aspartate level and body weight in obese mice, as well as human body mass index (BMI), was evaluated. In addition, saline or 200 mg/kg L-aspartate was orally administrated to HFC diet mice and HFC diet-induced obese mice for 6-7 weeks. Body weight, adipose tissue weight, glucose tolerance and liver damage were assessed to evaluate the effect on obesity prevention and treatment. Comprehensive lab animal monitoring system (CLAMS) and seahorse assay were employed to investigate the regulatory effect of L-aspartate on energy metabolism in vivo and in vitro, respectively. 3T3-L1 preadipocytes and murine white adipose tissue (WAT) were utilized to examine the impact of L-aspartate on adipocyte adipogenesis and lipogenesis and cellular signalling pathway in vitro and in vivo. RESULTS: L-aspartate, an approved drug for liver injury and chronic fatigue, was identified as an endogenous inducer of energy expenditure. Serum or adipose L-aspartate levels were found to be negatively correlated with the severity of obesity in both humans and mice. Administration of L-aspartate to HFC diet mice led to a significant reduction in body weight, with decreases of 14.5% in HFC diet mice and 8.5% in HFC diet-induced obese mice, respectively. In addition, the treatment improved related metabolic syndrome (Figure 2 and Figure S3). These therapeutics were associated with enhancements in whole-body energy expenditure and suppression of adipocyte adipogenesis along with activation of Adenosine 5'-monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signalling pathway. CONCLUSION: L-aspartate may serve as a novel endogenous inducer of energy expenditure and suppressor of adipogenesis and lipogenesis along with activation of AMPK, thereby offering a promising therapeutic strategy for obesity prevention and treatment.",

The primary aim is to highlight the importance of considering NMDAR encephalitis in the differential diagnosis of young female patients presenting with acute or subacute neuropsychiatric symptoms, especially when accompanied by ovarian teratomas. CASE DESCRIPTION: This case report and literature review detail the presentation, diagnosis, and treatment of a 35-year-old G4P3 Indigenous woman who initially presented with neuropsychiatric symptoms and fever, having a history of extensive drug and alcohol use. Misdiagnosed initially, the patient's lack of response to standard treatments led to further investigations, revealing paraneoplastic anti-NMDAR encephalitis secondary to a left ovarian teratoma. The report examines the treatment regimen followed, including prednisolone, intravenous immunoglobulin, rituximab injections, and laparoscopic bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. CONCLUSIONS: This case underscores the critical need for increased clinical vigilance for anti-NMDAR encephalitis in patients, particularly young females, presenting with neuropsychiatric symptoms and potential ovarian teratomas. The literature review accompanying the case report provides valuable insights into the presentation, diagnosis, and management of this complex condition. Lastly, this study emphasised the diagnostic challenges inherent in paraneoplastic neuropsychiatric syndromes, advocating for a multidisciplinary approach in similar clinical scenarios."

      "abstract": "Growth hormone (GH) is an essential factor in enhancing the productivity of animals. In ruminants, L-aspartate (L-Asp) stimulates the secretion of GH; however, the effect of D-Asp on GH remains unknown. Here, we examined the effect of D-Asp on GH secretion in wethers. Blood GH, insulin, adrenaline, noradrenaline, non-esterified fatty acid (NEFA), and glucose concentrations were evaluated in response to the intravenous infusion of a high-dose (0.1 mmol/kg/min) of D-Asp for 20 min. Further, concentrations of these biomolecules were evaluated when a low-dose (0.05 mmol/kg/min) of D-Asp was continuously infused intravenously for 20 min. Finally, the direct effect of D-Asp on GH secretion was determined using cultured sections of the anterior pituitary tissue from wethers. Infusion of the high-dose of D-Asp markedly increased blood GH concentrations (P < 0.05), resulting in an increase in the area under the curve (AUC). Plasma GH concentrations and AUC also increased in response to infusion of a low D-Asp dose. Infusion of a high and low D-Asp dose caused a prolonged reduction in plasma insulin concentrations, and the AUC was lower (P < 0.05). Plasma NEFA concentrations gradually increased after the end of D-Asp infusion, with a low D-Asp dose infusion resulting in significantly higher concentrations at 90 min (P < 0.05). Plasma adrenaline, noradrenaline, and glucose concentrations did not show significant changes despite differences in the dose of D-Asp. Although D-Asp treatments stimulated GH secretion in the cultured sections of pituitary tissues, the effect was not significant. These results suggest that D-Asp stimulates the secretion of GH in wethers through not only a direct action on the pituitary gland but also through another pathway of GH stimulation.",

Here, we hypothesize that higher levels of NMDAR antibody (Ab) may contribute to the sensory gating deficits in schizophrenia. STUDY DESIGN: We enrolled 72 non-smoking inpatients with first-episode schizophrenia (FES), most of them with only a relatively short duration of exposure to antipsychotic medications, and 51 non-smoking healthy controls (HC). Sensory gating was measured by P50 evoked potentials ratio and the difference between the two stimuli in an auditory paired-stimuli paradigm and serum NMDAR Ab levels were quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. STUDY RESULTS: The FES group showed higher serum NMDAR Ab levels [(9.23 ± 4.15) ng/mL vs. (7.08 ± 2.83) ng/mL; P = .002], higher P50 ratio (P = .002), and less P50 difference (P = .001) than HC. In partial correlation analysis, serum NMDAR Ab levels were positively correlated with the P50 ratio (r = 0.36, P = .003) and negatively with the P50 difference (r = -0.39, P = .001) in the FES group. The NMDAR Ab levels mediated the diagnosis of schizophrenia and P50 sensory gating deficits (P50 ratio and P50 difference). CONCLUSIONS: Autoimmunity targeting NMDAR is a crucial intermediate mechanism in impaired sensory gating in patients with schizophrenia. The findings support early intervention targeting NMDAR for patients with schizophrenia."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis has not been reported in anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor-antibody encephalitis in the absence of an underlying thrombotic state while rituximab induced cerebral venous sinus thrombosis is rarely reported. We report a patient with anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor-antibody encephalitis without a prothrombotic state who developed cerebral venous sinus thrombosis following rituximab treatment. CASE PRESENTATION: A 15-year-old Sri Lankan girl who had been in remission following an episode of anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor-antibody encephalitis 2 years ago, presented with a relapse of anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor-antibody encephalitis characterized by recurrent seizures, mutism, and cognitive abnormalities. Since response was inadequate to first-line immunotherapy, she was administered four doses of rituximab at weekly intervals. Two days after the fourth dose, she developed increasing headaches, and her cranial magnetic resonance venogram confirmed the development of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis. Screening for prothrombotic states were negative. She made an unremarkable recovery following anticoagulation. CONCLUSION: This case highlights the occurrence of the rare but serious complication of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis following rituximab in the context of anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor-antibody encephalitis and informs the clinician to be wary of new onset headache in patients with anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor-antibody encephalitis treated with immunotherapy.",

The compounds were synthesized under controlled conditions by the reaction of the substituted anilines with sodium nitrite, followed by the reaction with cyanoacetamide, substituted urea, ethanol, and water. The final compounds (5a-d; 6a-d) were tested for antiepileptic activity by in-silico screening targeting N-Methyl D-Aspartate glutamate receptor (PDB ID:5IPV). The screened compounds are also evaluated by in vivo test (MES) by taking phenytoin as a standard drug. The results of the whole study were satisfactory with the yield of the compounds in the range of 88 % to 96 %. The results of in- silico, screening showed that compounds 6a and 6c have far more binding energy compared with standard phenytoin (6a -7.5 Kcal/mol. ; 6c -7.6 Kcal/mol. and Phenytoin -6.5 Kcal/mol.). The TD50 values of synthesized compounds (6a-6d) are observed to be significantly higher than those of standard phenytoin. The PI values of several synthetic compounds (6a and 6c) were found to be higher (55.8 % and 58.0 %) than the current antiepileptic medicine phenytoin (55.6 %), demonstrating the synthesized compound's safety potential.",

There currently are no effective evidence-based therapies available for treating neurologic PCC. OBJECTIVE: To assess the effects of lithium aspartate therapy on PCC fatigue and cognitive dysfunction. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (RCT) enrolling participants in a neurology clinic from November 28, 2022, to June 29, 2023, with 3 weeks of follow-up, was conducted. Subsequently, an open-label lithium dose-finding study with 6 weeks of follow-up was performed among the same participants enrolled in the RCT. Eligible individuals needed to report new, bothersome fatigue or cognitive dysfunction persisting for more than 4 weeks after a self-reported positive test for COVID-19, Fatigue Severity Scale-7 (FSS-7) or Brain Fog Severity Scale (BFSS) score of 28 or greater, Beck Depression Inventory-II score less than 24, and no history of a condition known to cause fatigue or cognitive dysfunction. All participants in the RCT were eligible for the dose-finding study, except for those who responded to the placebo. Intention-to-treat analysis was used. INTERVENTION: Lithium aspartate, 10 to 15 mg/d, or identically appearing placebo for 3 weeks followed by open-label lithium aspartate, 10 to 15 mg/d, for 2 weeks. In the subsequent dose-finding study, open-label lithium aspartate dosages up to 45 mg/d for 6 weeks were given. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Change in sum of FSS-7 and BFSS scores. The scores for each measure range from 7 to 49, with higher scores indicating more severe symptoms. Secondary outcomes included changes from baseline in the scores of additional questionnaires. RESULTS: Fifty-two participants were enrolled (30 [58%] males; mean [SD] age, 58.54 [14.34] years) and 26 were randomized to treatment with lithium aspartate (10 females) and 26 to placebo (12 female). Two participants assigned to lithium aspartate were lost to follow-up and none withdrew. No adverse events were attributable to lithium therapy. There were no significant intergroup differences for the primary outcome (-3.6; 95% CI, -16.6 to 9.5; P = .59) or any secondary outcomes. Among 3 patients completing a subsequent dose-finding study, open-label lithium aspartate, 40 to 45 mg/d, was associated with numerically greater reductions in fatigue and cognitive dysfunction scores than 15 mg/d, particularly in 2 patients with serum lithium levels of 0.18 and 0.49 mEq/L compared with 1 patient with a level of 0.10 mEq/L. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this RCT, therapy with lithium aspartate, 10 to 15 mg/d, was ineffective for neurologic PCC fatigue and cognitive dysfunction. Another RCT is required to assess the potential benefits of higher lithium dosages for treating neurologic PCC. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT05618587 and NCT06108297.",

METHODS: Eighteen pediatric patients with NMDAR encephalitis treated with rituximab after failure of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and methylprednisolone treatment were analyzed retrospectively in terms of their medical history, clinical features, laboratory examination results, and treatments. The modified Rankin scale (mRS) score, peripheral blood CD19+ B cells, recurrence, and adverse events were used to evaluate the efficacy and safety of rituximab. RESULTS: The patients were treated with rituximab 3.2 ± 1.0 days after the end of IVIG and methylprednisolone treatment. After initial rituximab treatment for four weeks, the mRS score and number of CD19+ B cells in all patients were significantly lower than those before treatment (P < 0.05). At the last follow-up (44.1 months, 17.7 S.D.), all patients had recovered well (mRS ≤2), 14 patients (77.8%) recovered completely (mRS = 0), three patients had recurrent seizures, and one patient had mental and language impairment. Two patients had transient mild adverse events during infusion, and none of the other patients experienced severe adverse events during hospitalization or follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Rituximab appears safe and may be effective for the treatment of anti-NMDAR encephalitis without tumor in children refractory to first-line agents.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Epilepsy, a prevalent neurological disorder characterized by recurrent seizures, presents significant challenges in treatment and management. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of tropisetron, a selective 5-HT3 receptor antagonist on pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) - induced seizure in mice by exploring the potential role of the NMDA receptor and inflammatory responses. METHODS: For this purpose, seizures were induced by intravenous PTZ infusion. Tropisetron at 1-, 2-, 3-, 5-, 10- mg/kg were administered intraperitoneally 30 minutes before PTZ. To evaluate probable role of NMDA signaling, selective NMDAR antagonists, ketamine and MK-801, were injected 15 minutes before tropisetron. Also, TNF-α level of hippocampus were measured following administration of mentioned drugs in mice. RESULTS: Our results demonstrate that tropisetron displayed a dose-dependent impact on seizure threshold, with certain doses (5 and 10 mg/kg) exhibiting anticonvulsant properties. In addition, the noncompetitive NMDAR antagonists, ketamine (1 mg/kg) and MK-801 (0.5 mg/kg), at doses that had no effect on seizure threshold, augmented the anticonvulsant effect of tropisetron (3 mg/kg). Also, tropisetron led to a reduction in hippocampal TNF-α levels, indicating its anti-inflammatory potential independent of 5-HT receptor activity. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, we demonstrated that the anticonvulsant effect of tropisetron is mediated by the inhibition of NMDA receptors and a decline in hippocampal TNF-α level. These findings highlight a potential connection between 5-HT3 and NMDA receptors in the pharmacological treatment of inflammatory diseases, such as seizure, warranting further investigation into their combined therapeutic effects.",

MTX treatment can be limited by CNS toxicity. Dextromethorphan is used to treat MTX neurotoxicity, with most data derived from pediatric case series. In this report, we profile 4 adult patients who developed intrathecal (IT) MTX neurotoxicity to better characterize their response to dextromethorphan treatment. METHODS: A case series of 4 patients who developed neurologic symptoms attributed to IT MTX neurotoxicity subsequently treated with dextromethorphan was devised. Demographic data, clinical characteristics, electroencephalography results, magnetic resonance imaging, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) characteristics, and dextromethorphan treatment outcomes were described. RESULTS: Of the 4 patients developing MTX neurotoxicity, neurologic symptoms developed over a timeframe of 2 to 14 days from the precedent MTX exposure. Radiologic phenotypes included subcortical white matter diffusion-restricting lesions, bi-hemispheric subcortical white matter T2-FLAIR hyperintensities, as well as other findings described in the report. Time elapsed from initiation of dextromethorphan to neurologic symptom resolution ranged from 1 to 2 days. CONCLUSIONS: The profiles of 4 adult patients developing suspected IT MTX neurotoxicity syndromes with subsequent response to Dextromethorphan add further data to guide the management of such patients."

      "abstract": "ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Anti-NMDAR encephalitis is one of the most common types of autoimmune encephalitis, primarily presenting with prodromal symptoms, such as fever and headache, followed by a range of neurological and psychiatric symptoms. Chaihu Guizhi Decoction (CGD), a traditional Chinese medicine formulated by Zhang Zhongjing in the Eastern Han Dynasty, has been effectively used in clinical practice to treat the symptoms of Taiyang and Shaoyang disorders, including fever, headache, and psychiatric disorders. AIM OF THE STUDY: To demonstrate the protective effects of CGD in an animal model of anti-NMDAR encephalitis and explore the potential mechanisms involved. MATERIALS AND METHODS: UHPLC-HRMS was used to identify CGD's chemical components and serum metabolomic profiles. Network pharmacology and molecular docking were performed to predict potential targets of CGD for the treatment of anti-NMDAR encephalitis. The effect of CGD on anti-NMDAR encephalitis was evaluated using a mouse model induced by patients' antibodies. Behavioral tests were performed to assess cognitive impairment and schizophrenia-like behaviors. The effect of CGD on the cell-surface NMDAR GluN1 subunit in cultured neurons treated with patient antibodies was detected by immunofluorescence. Golgi staining was used to observe morphological changes in hippocampal dendrites. The expression of NMDAR-interacting proteins and various neuroreceptors in the hippocampus were examined to validate the targets predicted using network pharmacology and molecular docking. RESULTS: CGD alleviated cognitive, memory, and sensorimotor gating deficits in mice treated with anti-NMDAR encephalitis patients' antibodies. Further experiments demonstrated the effect of CGD in preventing NMDAR reduction both in vitro and in vivo. Meanwhile, CGD regulated NMDAR-interacting proteins and dopamine receptors but did not affect hippocampal dendritic morphology and synaptic density. Additionally, CGD modifies metabolic pathways associated with anti-NMDAR encephalitis and other neurological and psychiatric disorders. CONCLUSIONS: CGD exhibited protective effects against anti-NMDAR encephalitis by mitigating the antibody-induced reduction in NMDAR and NMDAR-interacting proteins.",

Benzodiazepines may be contraindicated such as when delirium co-exists. This review discusses the utility of NMDA receptor antagonists as alternatives to benzodiazepines in the treatment of catatonia in adults. METHODS: A PubMed search adhering to PRISMA guidelines was conducted for articles on NMDA receptor antagonists in catatonia treatment. RESULTS: Thirty-seven articles, including case reports and case series were identified. Amantadine (27 cases in 13 articles) and memantine (20 cases in 14 articles) were the most commonly reported agents. Amantadine, typically used as monotherapy or adjunctive therapy with benzodiazepines, showed quick responses. Memantine, used alone or with lorazepam, demonstrated rapid responses. A small number of cases (5 cases in 4 articles) reported successful use of ketamine and esketamine, highlighting their potential role in catatonia treatment. CONCLUSION: Despite limitations, NMDA receptor antagonists may be viable options when the patient is partially or not responsive to benzodiazepine, ECT is not available or may not be well tolerated, there is a concern for co-morbid delirium where benzodiazepines may be contraindicated. Further research is needed.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Intractable epilepsy in children is a prevalent neurological disorder that can pose serious risks. The involvement of the autoimmune system is a significant factor in the pathogenesis of the disease. The N-methyl-D-aspartate-receptor (NMDAR) is a glutamate receptor and ion channel present in neurons and is associated with the mechanism of autoimmune etiology in epilepsy. This study aims to compare the levels of NMDAR auto antibodies in children with intractable and non-intractable epilepsy. METHODS: A prospective analytic study was conducted from June to September 2022. The study sample consisted of patients aged 1 month to 18 years diagnosed with epilepsy and receiving anti-seizure medication (ASM) therapy at Dr. Soetomo General Academic Hospital, Surabaya. The patients were divided into two groups, namely intractable epilepsy and non-intractable epilepsy. The NMDAR autoantibody levels were determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Statistical analysis employed the chi-squared and Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney tests. RESULTS: Seventy-five subjects were included in the study. Of these patients, 41.3 % with intractable epilepsy and 33.4 % with non-intractable epilepsy presented NMDAR auto antibodies. Analysis of the patient characteristics revealed a correlation between seizure frequency and NMDAR autoantibody positivity (P = 0.002) but not between the number of ASM and NMDAR autoantibody positivity (P > 0.05). The NMDAR autoantibody levels were not significantly different in children with intractable and non-intractable epilepsy (P = 0.157). CONCLUSION: The NMDAR autoantibody levels were numerically higher in children with intractable epilepsy compared with children with non-intractable epilepsy."

This study aims to investigate if serum NSE concentration is related to the clinical features of anti-NMDAR encephalitis. METHODS: Serum NSE levels were detected in 58 anti-NMDAR encephalitis cases, 58 matched healthy controls and 58 matched disease controls. Demographic features, clinical symptoms, cerebrospinal fluid parameters and brain MRI indexes of the cases were evaluated. RESULTS: Serum NSE concentrations were significant higher in case group than those in healthy controls and disease controls (both p < 0.001). Serum NSE concentrations in patients with mRS≥3 one year after onset were obviously higher than in those with mRS<3 (p < 0.001). Patients with status epilepticus or central hypoventilation had higher serum NSE levels than those without (p = 0.003 and p = 0.006). Serum NSE concentrations in cases with brain lesions or brain atrophy were significant higher than in those without (p = 0.001 and p < 0.001, respectively). Serum NSE concentrations were found to be significant higher in cases with limited response to treatment compared to those with favourable therapy outcomes (p < 0.001). Spearman's correlation analysis showed a significant positive association between serum NSE concentration and mRS score at the most critical time (max mRS) (r = 0.575, p < 0.001) and one year after onset (r = 0.705, p < 0.001). Cox regression results reflected that high serum NSE level was an independent predictor of poor prognosis in anti-NMDAR encephalitis group (p = 0.001), and the ROC curve threshold value was 15.72 ng/ml. CONCLUSIONS: Serum NSE concentrations in anti-NMDAR encephalitis cases are higher than those in controls. It can be used to predict the brain damage degree and prognosis of anti-NMDAR encephalitis cases.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: N-methyl-D-aspartate-receptor (NMDAR) encephalitis is a rare neurological autoimmune disease with severe neuropsychiatric symptoms during the acute phase. Despite good functional neurological recovery, most patients continue to experience cognitive, psychiatric, psychological, and social impairments years after the acute phase. However, the precise nature and evolving patterns over time of these long-term consequences remain unclear, and their implications for the well-being and quality of life of predominantly young patients have yet to be thoroughly examined. METHODS: SAPIENCE is a European multi-center (n = 3) prospective observational cohort study studying the long-term cognitive, psychiatric, psychological, and social outcome in patients with NMDAR encephalitis. The study consists of three interconnected levels. Level 1 comprises a qualitative interview and focus groups with patients and their caregivers. Level 2 consists of a condensed form of the interview, standardized questionnaires, and a detailed neuropsychological examination of patients. Level 3 involves an online survey that will be open to patients world-wide and explores patient-reported outcomes (PROMs), and patient-reported experiences (PREMs) in association with clinical and cognitive outcomes. Levels 1 to 3 will progressively contribute developing of structured interviews, survey questions, and treatment guidelines by informing one another. DISCUSSION: SAPIENCE is an in-depth study of the long-term effects of NMDAR encephalitis and bridges the gap between standardized assessments and individual patient experiences, intending to improve patient care and to increase awareness of the psychosocial long-term consequences of the disease. Through collaboration of experts in clinical neurology and social and health psychology across Europe, SAPIENCE aims to create online assessment tools and formulate guidelines for patient-centered post-acute care that will help enhance the quality of life for patients and caregivers.",

Thus, they need to be aware of clinical features, differential diagnoses, and treatment options for this condition. In this study, we aimed to investigate the familiarity of Romanian psychiatrists with anti-NMDAR encephalitis. METHODS: We recruited psychiatrists from Romania and conducted a cross-sectional observational study by using a web-based survey. RESULTS: The survey was completed by 111 psychiatrists, of whom 47 (42.34%) were specialists, while 64 (57.66%) were trainees. The median length of training for specialists was ten years (interquartile range - IQR 9.5), while for trainees it was 2.5 years (IQR 3). In total, 31 (27.93%) psychiatrists encountered a case of anti-NMDAR encephalitis, with no significant difference between specialists and trainees. 31 (27.93%) psychiatrists were either unaware of the disorder or only knew its name, while 77 (69.37%) had knowledge of an outline of it. Only 3 (2.7%) psychiatrists had comprehensive knowledge of the disorder. Respondents with a higher awareness level had undergone significantly longer training (p=0.014). Unsurprisingly, having encountered a case significantly influenced awareness levels (p<0.001). There were no significant differences between specialists and trainees regarding specific knowledge about anti-NMDAR encephalitis. However, higher awareness levels and having encountered a case significantly influenced answer accuracy for questions regarding psychiatric presentation and epidemiological features. CONCLUSIONS: Our study indicates that Romanian psychiatrists have suboptimal knowledge of anti-NMDAR encephalitis, highlighting the need for improved awareness of this disorder."

In order to suggest the use of the commercially available L-Ornithine-L-Aspartate (LOLA) for treating PAD, we induced hind limb ischemia (HLI) by unilaterally ligating the femoral artery in a rat model. The rats were randomly divided into three groups, with seven rats assigned to each group: group 1 (control), group 2 (sorbitol), and group 3 (LOLA). Intraperitoneal injections were administered five times on post-operative days (PODs) 3, 5, 7, 10, and 12. Perfusion imaging was conducted on PODs 7 and 14 and compared to pre-operative perfusion imaging. Immunohistochemistry staining and Western blotting were performed after the final perfusion imaging. Group 3 showed a significant increase in perfusion, high CD31-positive capillary lumen density, and substantial overexpression of VEGF in the ischemic limb during the subacute phase of HLI. In conclusion, this study provides the first documented evidence of angiogenesis and perfusion recovery in the subacute phase of the HLI model following the administration of LOLA. With LOLA readily available on the commercial market, the implementation of LOLA treatment for PAD in humans can be expedited compared to other therapies still in the developmental stage."

Comprehensive mNGS and neuronal antibody testing are essential for timely diagnosis. Moreover, IVIG monotherapy can serve as an effective treatment for NMDARE induced by HSV2, providing a viable alternative, particularly when steroid therapy is contraindicated.",

      "abstract": "Traumatic brain injury leads to glutamate release, which overstimulates N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors, leading to neurotoxicity and cytotoxic edema. NMDA receptor antagonists may offer neuroprotection by blocking this pathway. The objective of this systematic review is to assess the efficacy of NMDA receptor antagonists for traumatic brain injury-induced brain edema in rodent models. This systematic review followed Cochrane Handbook guidelines and registered its protocol in PROSPERO (ID: CRD42023440934). Here, we included controlled rodent animal models comparing NMDA antagonist use with a placebo treatment. Outcome measures included the reduction of cerebral edema, Neurobehavioral Severity Scale, and adverse effects. The search strategy used Medical Subject Headings terms related to traumatic brain injury and NMDA receptor antagonists. The Collaborative Approach to Meta Analysis and Review of Animal Experimental Studies (CAMARADES) checklist and Systematic Review Centre for Laboratory Animal Experimentation's (SYRCLE's) tools were used to measure the quality and bias of included studies. The synthesis of results was presented in a meta-analysis of standard mean difference. Sixteen studies were included, with the predominant drugs being ifenprodil, MK-801, magnesium, and HU-211. The subjects consisted of Sprague-Dawley or Sabra rats. The analysis showed a significant reduction in brain edema with NMDA antagonist treatment (Standardized mean difference [SMD] - 1.17, 95% confidence interval [CI] - 1.59 to - 0.74, p < 0.01), despite high heterogeneity (I2 = 72%). Neurobehavioral Severity Scale also significantly improved (mean difference - 3.32, 95% CI - 4.36 to - 2.28, p < 0.01) in animals receiving NMDA antagonists. Administration within 1 h after injury showed a modest enhancement in reducing brain edema compared with the baseline (SMD - 1.23, 95% CI - 1.69 to - 0.77, p < 0.01). Studies met standards for animal welfare and model appropriateness. Although baseline comparability and selective reporting bias were generally addressed, key biases such as randomization, allocation concealment, and blinding were often unreported. Overall, NMDA antagonists exhibit promising efficacy in the treatment of traumatic brain injury. Notably, our systematic review consistently demonstrated a significant reduction in brain edema with compounds including HU-211 and NPS 150.",

The objective of this study was to ascertain the factors that forecast short-term prognosis in patients with anti-NMDAR encephalitis, develop a prognostic prediction model, and authenticate its efficacy in an external validation cohort. Further, all patients were followed-up long-term to assess the factors of long-term outcome and relapses. METHODS: A prospective enrollment of patients diagnosed with anti-NMDAR encephalitis was conducted across five clinical centers in China from June 2014 to Mar 2022. The enrolled patients were divided into the derivation and validation sets based on enrollment time. The short-term prognostic model was visualized using a nomogram. Further, all patients were followed-up long-term to assess the factors of long-term outcome. RESULTS: This study found that poor short-term prognosis was a risk factor for poor long-term outcome (6-month prognosis, OR 29.792, 95%CI 6.507-136.398, p < 0.001; 12-month prognosis, OR 15.756, 95%CI 3.384-73.075, p < 0.001; 24-month prognosis, OR 5.500, 95%CI 1.045-28.955, p = 0.044). Abnormal behavior or cognitive dysfunction (OR 8.57, 95%CI 1.48-49.79, p = 0.017), consciousness impairment (OR19.32, 95%CI 3.03-123.09, p = 0.002), autonomic dysfunction or central hypoventilation (OR 5.66, 95%CI 1.25-25.75, p = 0.025), CSF pleocytosis (OR 4.33, 95%CI 1.48-12.65, p = 0.007), abnormal EEG (OR 5.48, 95% CI 1.09-27.54, p = 0.039) were independent predictors for a poor short-term prognosis after first-line immunotherapy. A nomogram that incorporated those factors showed good discrimination and calibration abilities. The area under the curve (AUC) for the prognostic model were 0.866 (95%CI: 0.798-0.934) with a sensitivity of 0.761 and specificity of 0.869. CONCLUSION: We established and validated a prognostic model that can provide individual prediction of short-term prognosis after first-line immunotherapy for patients with anti-NMDAR encephalitis. This practical prognostic model may help neurologists to predict the short-term prognosis early and potentially assist in adjusting appropriate treatment timely.",

In this review we provide an overview of biosynthetic pathways that produce aspartate endogenously during proliferation. We discuss conditions that favor aspartate uptake as well as possible sources of exogenous aspartate in the microenvironment of tumors and bone marrow, where most available data have been generated.

We previously reported that DGAT1 inhibition increased plasma alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) activities in corn oil-loaded rats via protein kinase C (PKC) activation. In the present study, we investigated the mechanism with respect to the morphology and permeability of the small intestine, focusing on PKC function, and found that shortening of the intestinal villi and a decrease in the number of tdT-mediated dUTP-biotin nick-end labeling-positive cells in the tips of the villi were observed in the jejunum of DGAT1 inhibitor-treated rats loaded with corn oil. These results suggested that the tips of the villi were shed into the intestinal lumen. Next, fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran, 110 kDa (FD-110) was administered intraduodenally to DGAT1 inhibitor-treated rats loaded with corn oil and we found that plasma FD-110 concentrations increased, indicating that the intestinal permeability to molecules with a molecular weight of approximately 110,000 (e.g., ALT and AST) increased. Taken together, the present results suggested that DGAT1 inhibitor-treatment in combination with corn oil causes ALT and AST to leak from the enterocytes into the blood by shedding the tips of the intestinal villi and increasing intestinal permeability.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Schizophrenia (SCZ) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are neurodevelopmental diseases characterized by different psychopathological manifestations and divergent clinical trajectories. Various alterations at glutamatergic synapses have been reported in both disorders, including abnormal NMDA and metabotropic receptor signaling. METHODS: We conducted a bicentric study to assess the blood serum levels of NMDA receptors-related glutamatergic amino acids and their precursors, including L-glutamate, L-glutamine, D-aspartate, L-aspartate, L-asparagine, D-serine, L-serine and glycine, in ASD, SCZ patients and their respective control subjects. Specifically, the SCZ patients were subdivided into treatment-resistant and non-treatment-resistant SCZ patients, based on their responsivity to conventional antipsychotics. RESULTS: D-serine and D-aspartate serum reductions were found in SCZ patients compared to controls. Conversely, no significant differences between cases and controls were found in amino acid concentrations in the two ASD cohorts analyzed. DISCUSSION: This result further encourages future research to evaluate the predictive role of selected D-amino acids as peripheral markers for SCZ pathophysiology and diagnosis."

This study seeks to elucidate how bright light exposure mitigates cognitive deficits associated with schizophrenia by examining its impact on hippocampal neurogenesis and its potential to alleviate sub-chronic MK-801-induced cognitive impairments in mice. Following three weeks of juvenile bright light exposure (5-8 weeks old), significant increases in proliferating neurons (BrdU+) and immature neurons (DCX+ cells) were observed in the dentate gyrus (DG) and lateral ventricle of MK-801-treated mice. Long-term bright light treatment further promoted the differentiation of BrdU+ cells into immature neurons (BrdU+ DCX+ cells), mature neurons (BrdU+ NeuN+ cells), or astrocytes (BrdU+ GFAP+ cells) in the hippocampal DG. This augmented neurogenesis correlated with the attenuation of sub-chronic MK- 801-induced cognitive deficits, as evidenced by enhancements in Y-maze, novel object recognition (NOR), novel location recognition (NLR), and Morris water maze (MWM) test performances. These findings suggest a promising noninvasive clinical approach for alleviating cognitive impairments associated with neuropsychiatric disorders.",

If a pediatric patient presents with suspected viral encephalitis, autoimmune etiology must be excluded via cerebrospinal fluid antibody assay to guide appropriate immunosuppressive therapy, and improve patient outcomes. ABSTRACT: Autoimmune encephalitis particularly involving the n-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) is recognized as a rare cause of acute encephalopathy in pediatric patients. The following case is of a 14-year-old female diagnosed with anti-NMDAR encephalitis who initially presented with fever, episodic convulsions, and loss of consciousness. She subsequently developed right-sided body weakness, expressive aphasia, and visual hallucinations. Clinical examination revealed prominent neuropsychiatric manifestations such as altered sensorium, motor deficits, hallucinations, and visual disturbances. Cerebello-bulbar signs were not appreciable in this particular case. She was treated for viral encephalitis but showed no improvement. Laboratory investigations revealed the presence of NMDAR antibodies in the cerebrospinal fluid confirming the diagnosis of autoimmune etiology. The patient demonstrated notable improvement following immunosuppressive treatment."

      "abstract": "It is known that the inflammation process leading to oxidative stress and thyroid hormone metabolism dysfunction is highly altered in metabolic dysfunction associated with steatotic liver disease (MASLD). This study aims to address the effect of ornithine aspartate (LOLA) and vitamin E (VitE) in improving these processes. Adult Sprague-Dawley rats were assigned to five groups and treated for 28 weeks: controls (n = 10) received a standard diet (for 28 weeks) plus gavage with distilled water (DW) from weeks 16 to 28. MASLD groups received a high-fat and choline-deficient diet for 28 weeks (MASLD group) and daily gavage with 200 mg/kg/day of LOLA, or twice a week with 150 mg of VitE from weeks 16-28. LOLA diminished collagen deposition (p = 0.006). The same treatment diminished carbonyl, TBARS, and sulfhydryl levels and GPx activity (p < 0.001). Type 3 deiodinase increased in the MASLD group, downregulating T3-controlled genes, which was corrected in the presence of LOLA. LOLA also promoted a near-normalization of complex II, SDH, and GDH activities (p < 0.001) and improved reticulum stress, with a reduction in GRP78 and HSPA9/GRP75 protein levels (p < 0.05). The enhanced energy production and metabolism of thyroid hormones, probably because of GSH replenishment provided by the L-glutamate portion of LOLA, opens a new therapeutic approach for MASLD.",

      "abstract": "Liver fibrosis is a determinant-stage process of many chronic liver diseases and affected over 7.9 billion populations worldwide with increasing demands of ideal therapeutic agents. Discovery of active molecules with anti-hepatic fibrosis efficacies presents the most attacking filed. Here, we revealed that hepatic L-aspartate levels were decreased in CCl4-induced fibrotic mice. Instead, supplementation of L-aspartate orally alleviated typical manifestations of liver injury and fibrosis. These therapeutic efficacies were alongside improvements of mitochondrial adaptive oxidation. Notably, treatment with L-aspartate rebalanced hepatic cholesterol-steroid metabolism and reduced the levels of liver-impairing metabolites, including corticosterone (CORT). Mechanistically, L-aspartate treatment efficiently reversed CORT-mediated glucocorticoid receptor β (GRβ) signaling activation and subsequent transcriptional suppression of the mitochondrial genome by directly binding to the mitochondrial genome. Knockout of GRβ ameliorated corticosterone-mediated mitochondrial dysfunction and hepatocyte damage which also weakened the improvements of L-aspartate in suppressing GRβ signaling. These data suggest that L-aspartate ameliorates hepatic fibrosis by suppressing GRβ signaling via rebalancing cholesterol-steroid metabolism, would be an ideal candidate for clinical liver fibrosis treatment.",

Dalzanemdor (SAGE-718) is a novel, investigational NMDAR PAM being evaluated for the potential treatment of cognitive impairment in these disorders. We report first-in-human, phase I, double-blind, dose-finding studies to assess the safety, tolerability, and clinical pharmacology of dalzanemdor. A single-ascending dose study (dalzanemdor 0.35, 0.75, 1.5, or 3.0 mg vs. placebo) was conducted in healthy participants and included food effects. A multiple-ascending dose study (14 days) was conducted in healthy participants (dalzanemdor 0.5 or 1.0 mg vs. placebo) and HD participants (open-label dalzanemdor 1.0 mg) and included exploratory pharmacodynamics on cognitive performance. Dalzanemdor was generally well tolerated with no adverse events leading to discontinuation. Dalzanemdor exhibited pharmacokinetic parameters appropriate for once-daily dosing. Following single and multiple doses in healthy participants, median terminal half-life was 8-118 h, and the median time to reach maximum plasma concentration was 4-7 h. Exposures were dose-proportional after single dose (6-46 ng/mL) and more than dose-proportional after multiple doses (6-41 ng/mL). With multiple dosing, a steady state was achieved after 11 days in healthy participants and 13 days in HD participants. Dalzanemdor exposure decreased slightly with food. In HD participants, results suggest that dalzanemdor may improve cognitive performance on tests of executive function. These results support continued clinical development of dalzanemdor for the potential treatment of cognitive impairment in disorders of NMDAR hypofunction.",

      "abstract": "Temporomandibular joint osteoarthritis (TMJOA) is a severe form of temporomandibular joint disorders (TMD), and orofacial inflammatory allodynia is one of its common symptoms which lacks effective treatment. N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR), particularly its subtypes GluN2A and GluN2B, along with gap junctions (GJs), are key players in the mediation of inflammatory pain. However, the precise regulatory mechanisms of GluN2A, GluN2B, and GJs in orofacial inflammatory allodynia during TMJ inflammation still remain unclear. Here, we established the TMJ inflammation model by injecting Complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) into the TMJ and used Cre/loxp site-specific recombination system to conditionally knock out (CKO) GluN2A and GluN2B in the trigeminal ganglion (TG). Von-frey test results indicated that CFA-induced mechanical allodynia in the TMJ region was relieved in GluN2A and GluN2B deficient mice. In vivo, CFA significantly up-regulated the expression of GluN2A and GluN2B, Gjb1, Gjb2, Gjc2 and Panx3 in the TG, and GluN2A and GluN2B CKO played different roles in mediating the expression of Gjb1, Gjb2, Gjc2 and Panx3. In vitro, NMDA up-regulated the expression of Gjb1, Gjb2, Gjc2 and Panx3 in satellite glial cells (SGCs) as well as promoted the intercellular communication between SGCs, and GluN2A and GluN2B knocking down (KD) altered the expression and function differently. NMDAR regulated Gjb1 and Panx3 through ERK1/2 pathway, and mediated Gjb2 and Gjc2 through MAPK, PKA, and PKC intracellular signaling pathways. These findings shed light on the distinct functions of GluN2A and GluN2B in mediating peripheral sensitization induced by TMJ inflammation in the TG, offering potential therapeutic targets for managing orofacial inflammatory allodynia.",

AUD not only destroys families but also causes economic losses due to reduced productivity, absenteeism, and healthcare expenses. Statistics revealing the sustained number of individuals affected by AUD over the years underscore the need for further understanding of the underlying pathophysiology to advance novel therapeutic strategies. Previous research has implicated the limbic brain regions N-methyl-D-aspartate glutamate receptors (NMDAR) in the emotional and behavioral effects of AUD. Given that aerobic exercise can modulate NMDAR activity and sensitivity to alcohol, this review presents a summary of clinical and basic science studies on NMDAR levels induced by alcohol consumption, as well as acute and protracted withdrawal, highlighting the potential role of aerobic exercise as an adjunctive therapy for AUD. Based on our findings, the utility of exercise in the modulation of reward-linked receptors and AUD may be mediated by its effects on NMDA signaling. These data support further consideration of the potential of aerobic exercise as a promising adjunctive therapy for AUD."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: A proportion of head and neck carcinomas (HNSCCs) are induced by high-risk human papillomaviruses (HPVs) and are associated with better patient outcomes compared to patients with HNSCCs related to tobacco and alcohol abuse. In the microenvironment of solid tumors, including HNSCCs, oxygen levels are often reduced, and a hypoxic state is induced. This can lead to a poor treatment response and a worse patient prognosis. One of the hypoxia-responsive genes is aspartate-β-hydroxylase (ASPH), whose activity promotes the growth, invasiveness, and metastasis of many types of solid tumors. METHODS: In our study, HNSCC samples were analyzed for the expression of ASPH and selected endogenous hypoxia markers by real-time PCR and/or multiplex fluorescence immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Except for the EPAS1 gene, which had higher mRNA expression in the HPV-negative group of HNSCC (p < 0.05), we found no other differences in the expression of the tested genes that were related to HPV status. On the contrary, a statistically significantly higher number of cells producing ASPH (p < 0.0001), HIF1A (p < 0.0001), GLUT1 (p < 0.0001), and MMP13 (p < 0.05) proteins were detected in the HPV-positive tumor group than in the HPV-negative sample group. All the evaluated markers, except for MMP9/13, were more abundant in the tumor parenchyma than in the tumor stroma. The Cox proportional hazard models showed that increased numbers of cells with GLUT1 and HIF1A protein expression were positive prognostic markers for overall and disease-specific survival in patients independent of HPV tumor status. CONCLUSION: The study examined HNSCC samples and found that elevated ASPH and hypoxia marker proteins, typically associated with poor prognosis, may actually indicate active HPV infection, the strongest prognostic factor in HNSCC patients. In cases where HPV status is uncertain, increased expression of HIF1A and GLUT1 can serve as positive prognostic factors."

Surrounding the antidepressant mechanisms of ketamine, there is ample evidence supporting an NMDAR-antagonism-based hypothesis. However, alternative arguments also exist, mostly derived from the controversial clinical results of other NMDAR inhibitors. In this article, we first summarize the historical development of the NMDAR-centred hypothesis of rapid antidepressants. We then classify different NMDAR inhibitors based on their mechanisms of inhibition and evaluate preclinical as well as clinical evidence of their antidepressant effects. Finally, we critically analyse controversies and arguments surrounding ketamine's NMDAR-dependent and NMDAR-independent antidepressant action. A better understanding of ketamine's molecular targets and antidepressant mechanisms should shed light on the future development of better treatment for depression. This article is part of a discussion meeting issue 'Long-term potentiation: 50 years on'.",

Studies suggest ornithine aspartate (LOLA) as drug therapy. AIM: To analyze the influence of LOLA intake on gut microbiota using a nutritional model of MASLD. METHODS: Adult male Sprague Dawley rats were randomized into three groups: Control (10 rats fed with a standard diet), MASLD (10 rats fed with a high-fat and choline-deficient diet), and LOLA (10 rats receiving 200 mg/kg/d LOLA, after the 16th week receiving high-fat and choline-deficient diet). After 28 wk of the experiment, animals were euthanized, and feces present in the intestine were collected. Following fecal DNA extraction, the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene was amplified followed by sequencing in an Ion S5™ system. RESULTS: Alpha and beta diversity metrics were comparable between MASLD and LOLA. 3 OTUs were differentially abundant between MASLD and LOLA, which belong to the species Helicobacter rodentium, Parabacteroides goldsteinii, and Parabacteroides distasonis. The functional prediction provided two different metabolic profiles between MASLD and LOLA. The 9 pathways differentially abundant in MASLD are related to a change in energy source, adenosine/purine nucleotides degradation as well as guanosine and adenosine deoxyribonucleotides biosynthesis. The 14 pathways differentially abundant in LOLA are associated with four major metabolic functions primarily influenced by L-aspartate, including tricarboxylic acid cycle pathways, purine/guanosine nucleotides biosynthesis, pyrimidine ribonucleotides biosynthesis and salvage as well as lipid IVA biosynthesis. CONCLUSION: Although LOLA had no influence on alpha and beta diversity in this nutritional model of MASLD, it was associated with changes in specific gut microbes and their related metabolic pathways."

Approximately 20% of pediatric and 50% of adult T-ALL patients have refractory disease or relapse and die from the disease. To improve patient outcome new therapeutics are needed. With the aim to identify new therapeutic targets, we combined the analysis of T-ALL gene expression and metabolism to identify the metabolic adaptations that T-ALL cells exhibit. We found that glutamine uptake is essential for T-ALL proliferation. Isotope tracing experiments showed that glutamine fuels aspartate synthesis through the tricarboxylic acid cycle and that glutamine and glutamine-derived aspartate together supply three nitrogen atoms in purines and all but one atom in pyrimidine rings. We show that the glutamate-aspartate transporter EAAT1 (SLC1A3), which is normally expressed in the central nervous system, is crucial for glutamine conversion to aspartate and nucleotides and that T-ALL cell proliferation depends on EAAT1 function. Through this work, we identify EAAT1 as a novel therapeutic target for T-ALL treatment.",

METHODS: A total of 231 patients who underwent transurethral tumor resection between 2016 and 2022 were retrospectively analyzed. Preoperative test results, including AST, ALT, platelet, and lymphocyte counts, were used to calculate the PLR and De Ritis ratio. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify the predictive factors associated with recurrence and progression. RESULTS: Based on the ROC curve, 1.19 and 1.21 were identified as the optimal cut-off values of the De Ritis ratio for recurrence and progression, respectively. Furthermore, PLR cut-off values for recurrence and progression were 114 and 118, respectively. There is a significant difference in recurrence-free survival (RFS) and progression-free survival (PFS) between the groups of patients with high and low De Ritis ratios (p = 0.028 and p = 0.021, respectively). In multivariate analysis, De Ritis ratio ≥ 1.19 and European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) high recurrence risk were determined to be significant predictors of tumor recurrence. Multivariate analysis also determined that T1 pathological stage, high tumor grade, European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) high progression risk, and De Ritis ratio ≥ 1.21 were risk factors for tumor progression. CONCLUSION: In our study, the preoperative De Ritis ratio represented an independent predictive factor for recurrence and progression in non-muscle invasive bladder cancer. The use of this biomarker in combination with other diagnostic/predictive tools might help urologists improve the clinical decision-making process in the future."

Methods: Demographic and clinical manifeatations, immunotherapy and prognosis data of 9 children with refractory NMDA receptor antibody encephalitis who received tocilizumab in the Department of Pediatrics Neurology, XiangYa Hospital of Central South University from August 2021 to September 2023 were collected retrospectively. Prognosis was evaluated using the modified Rankin scale at initial diagnosis, at the initiation of tocilizumab treatment, and at the last follow-up. Treatment related complications, neuroimaging, and electroencephalography data were analyzed. Results: Among the 9 children, 6 were male and 3 were female, with an onset age of 4.2 (2.8, 8.7) years. At the onset of the disease, 9 children had a modified Rankin scale score of 5. When tocilizumab treatment was initiated, 7 children had a score of 5, and 2 children had a score of 4. The interval between the onset and initiation of tocilizumab treatment was 12 (5, 27) months, and the treatment frequency was 8 (5, 13) times. The follow-up time was 2.8 (1.5, 3.7) years. At the last follow-up, the symptoms of 9 children, including movement disorder, sleep disorder, consciousness disorder, silence and autonomic dysfunction, were improved to varying degrees, and none of them had seizures. At the last follow-up, 4 cases with a modified Rankin scale score of 0, 1 case with a score of 1, 2 cases with a score of 3, 1 case with a score of 4 and 1 case with a score of 5. The modified Rankin scale at the last follow-up was significantly different from that at the start of tocilizumab (Z=-2.56, P=0.014). All children had no serious adverse reactions during the treatment. Conclusions: After treatment with tocilizumab, the symptoms in patients with refractory NMDA receptor antibody encephalitis, including movement disorder, sleep disorder, consciousness disorder, silence and autonomic dysfunction were improved, and none of them had seizures. The modified Rankin scale were improved, and the safety was good.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is characterized by high invasion rates, rapid progression, and poor prognoses. Thus, identifying SCLC patients at high risk of progression and death is critical to improve long-term survival. In this study, the aspartate transaminase-to-albumin ratio (ATAR) was examined as a prognostic factor for SCLC patients. METHODS: We screened 196 SCLC patients from December 2013 to September 2022 at the Sichuan Cancer Hospital. The data was collected from patients' medical information as well as from their blood results during diagnosis. Using the Youden index as a cutoff value, patients were divided into high-risk（> 0.54) and low-risk (≤ 0.54) ATAR groups. We analyzed the prognostic factors for overall survival (OS) using the Kaplan-Meier method, univariate and multivariate analyses, Cox regression, and the C-index. RESULTS: There were 109 (55.6%) smokers among the patients, and the median OS was 17.55 months. The Kaplan-Meier analysis indicated that patients with high-risk ATAR had significantly lower OS (p < 0.0001). A multivariate analysis demonstrated that elevated ATAR is an independent adverse predictor of OS (p < 0.001, HR = 1.907). Our study found that ATAR is an independent predictor of survival outcomes in SCLC, which was superior to ALB, PNI, and SII in predicting outcomes in low-risk and high-risk groups (all p < 0.05). Models combining ATAR with ALB, PNI, and SII showed more powerful prognostic value than their corresponding original models. Moreover, the prognostic indicator ATAR can significantly stratify stage I - II and III - IV SCLC patients (p ＜ 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Peripheral blood ATAR prognostic index can be used as an independent predictor of SCLC patients before treatment.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Canavan disease is a devastating neurometabolic disorder caused by accumulation of N acetylaspartate in brain and body fluids due to genetic defects in the aspartoacylase gene (ASPA). New gene therapies are on the horizon but will require early presymptomatic diagnosis to be fully effective. METHODS: We therefore developed a fast and highly sensitive liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS)-based method for quantification of N-acetylaspartate in dried blood spots and established reference ranges for neonates and older controls. With this test, we investigated 45 samples of 25 Canavan patients including 8 with a neonatal sample. RESULTS: Measuring N-acetylaspartate concentration in dried blood with this novel test, all Canavan patients (with variable severity) were well separated from the control group (median; range: 5.7; 1.6-13.6 μmol/L [n = 45] vs 0.44; 0.24-0.99 μmol/L [n = 59] (p < 0.05)). There was also no overlap when comparing neonatal samples of Canavan patients (7.3; 5.1-9.9 μmol/L [n = 8]) and neonatal controls (0.93; 0.4-1.8 μmol/L [n = 784]) (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: We have developed a new LC-MS/MS-based screening test for early postnatal diagnosis of Canavan disease that should be further evaluated in a population-based study once a promising treatment becomes available. The method meets the general requirements of newborn screening and should be appropriate for multiplexing with other screening approaches that combine chromatographic and mass spectrometry techniques.",

Regular laboratory assessments are recommended throughout the treatment period to detect any potential complications. Objectives This study aims to present the alterations in laboratory parameters throughout the course of isotretinoin therapy and identify required diagnostic testing. Methods This study involved 136 patients undergoing isotretinoin treatment at doses of 0.3-0.5 mg/kg/day, with ages ranging from 18 to 41 years. A retrospective evaluation was conducted on biomarkers including aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT), creatine kinase (CK), triglycerides, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), hemoglobin, white blood cells, and thrombocytes. Levels of these parameters were analyzed prior to treatment and at the third month of treatment from the records of patients and the data were compared statistically. Moreover, the parameters of ALT, AST, CK, and GGT were graded objectively, and any alterations were noted in the patients. Results The levels of ALT, AST and GGT, along with triglycerides, total cholesterol, LDL-C, and thrombocyte levels showed significant elevation (p=0.001, p<0.001, p<0.001, p=0.001, p<0.001, p<0.001, and p=0.003, respectively). A significant decrease in HDL-C with hemoglobin was also noted (p=0.022, p=0.006, respectively). One patient (0.73%) exhibited grade 1 elevations in ALT, AST, and CK. One patient (0.73%) displayed grade 1 elevations in ALT and AST. One patient (0.73%) exhibited grade 1 elevations in AST and CK, while another patient (0.73%) had grade 1 elevation in AST and grade 3 elevation in CK. Furthermore, one patient (0.73%) had a grade 1 elevation exclusively in ALT, two patients (1.47%) had a grade 1 elevation exclusively in AST, and six patients (4.41%) exhibited a grade 1 elevation in CK only. No grade changes were observed in the GGT levels in the patients. Conclusion During isotretinoin treatment, changes in ALT and AST levels were more frequently associated with the muscle enzyme CK, while GGT levels remained unaffected. Therefore, GGT can be considered a reliable parameter for evaluating liver function in patients undergoing isotretinoin treatment."

      "abstract": "Burn injury is trauma with several metabolic reactions including hepatocytes that can cause apoptosis and necrosis. Proliferation occurs to compensate for this reaction but complicates with the loss of protein of the injury. The aim of this study is to describe the level of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) in burn injury. This study was a descriptive retrospective design using secondary data from medical records of patients at the Burns Unit of Dr. Hasan Sadikin Hospital Bandung (RSHS) in the period August 2017 to July 2019. Total samples in this study were 116 people. Normal level of AST and ALT was found in 23 people (19.8%), elevation of AST in 31 people (26.7%), elevation of ALT in 5 people (4.3%) and elevation of both AST and ALT in 57 people (41.3%). Increased levels of AST and ALT mostly occurred in men (51%), aged 45 years (56%), with injury due to electricity (26%), 20-29% burn area (32%), and occurred in the first week of wound onset. Most cases of burn injury showed increasing levels of AST and ALT. This might be due to the metabolism of hepatocytes in burn cases. Elevation of AST and ALT was mainly found in burn injury cases at RSHS notably in the first week of onset. Further research is needed to verify the relation of this condition. Elevated levels of AST and ALT should be the consideration of clinicians in giving therapy."

      "abstract": "l-Ornithine- l-aspartate (LOLA) reduces toxic ammonium (NH3) plasma levels in hepatic encephalopathy. NH3 detoxification/excretion is achieved by its incorporation into urea and glutamine via activation of carbamoyl phosphate synthetase 1 (CSP1) by l-ornithine and stimulation of arginase by l-aspartate. We aimed at identifying additional molecular targets of LOLA as a potential treatment option for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). In primary hepatocytes from NAFLD patients, urea cycle enzymes CSP1 and ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC) increase, while the catabolism of branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) decreases with disease severity. In contrast, LOLA increased the expression rates of the BCAA enzyme transcripts bcat2, bckdha, and bckdk. In untreated HepG2 hepatoblastoma cells and HepG2-based models of steatosis, insulin resistance, and metabolic syndrome (the latter for the first time established herein), LOLA reduced the release of NH3; beneficially modulated the expression of genes related to fatty acid import/transport (cd36, cpt1), synthesis (fasn, scd1, ACC1), and regulation (srbf1); reduced cellular ATP and acetyl-CoA; and favorably modulated the expression of master regulators/genes of energy balance/mitochondrial biogenesis (AMPK-α, pgc1α). Moreover, LOLA reconstituted the depolarized mitochondrial membrane potential, while retaining mitochondrial integrity and avoiding induction of superoxide production. Most effects were concentration-dependent at ≤40 mM LOLA. We demonstrate for l-ornithine-l-aspartate a broad range of reconstituting effects on metabolic carriers and targets of catabolism/energy metabolism impaired in NAFLD. These findings strongly advocate further investigations to establish LOLA as a safe, efficacious, and cost-effective basic medication for preventing and/or alleviating NAFLD."

      "abstract": "It is crucial to regulate N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) function bivalently depending on the central nervous system (CNS) conditions. CNS disorders with NMDA hyperfunction are involved in the pathogenesis of neurotoxic and/or neurodegenerative disorders with elevated D-serine, one of the NMDA receptor co-agonists. On the contrary, NMDA-enhancing agents have been demonstrated to improve psychotic symptoms and cognition in CNS disorders with NMDA hypofunction. Serine racemase (SR), the enzyme regulating both D- and L-serine levels through both racemization (catalysis from L-serine to D-serine) and β-elimination (degradation of both D- and L-serine), emerges as a promising target for bidirectional regulation of NMDA function. In this study, we explored using dimethyl malonate (DMM), a pro-drug of the SR inhibitor malonate, to modulate NMDA activity in C57BL/6J male mice via intravenous administration. Unexpectedly, 400 mg/kg DMM significantly elevated, rather than decreased (as a racemization inhibitor), D-serine levels in the cerebral cortex and plasma. This outcome prompted us to investigate the regulatory effects of dodecagalloyl-α-D-xylose (α12G), a synthesized tannic acid analog, on SR activity. Our findings showed that α12G enhanced the racemization activity of human SR by about 8-fold. The simulated and fluorescent assay of binding affinity suggested a noncooperative binding close to the catalytic residues, Lys56 and Ser84. Moreover, α12G treatment can improve behaviors associated with major CNS disorders with NMDA hypofunction including hyperactivity, prepulse inhibition deficit, and memory impairment in animal models of positive symptoms and cognitive impairment of psychosis. In sum, our findings suggested α12G is a potential therapeutic for treating CNS disorders with NMDA hypofunction."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: In recent years, simultaneous or sequential occurrence of MOG antibody disease and anti-NMDAR encephalitis in the same patient has been reported with increasing frequency. Scholars refer to the overlapping occurrence of these two disorders as MOG antibody disease and anti-NMDAR encephalitis overlap syndrome (MNOS). Cortical T2-weighted fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) -hyperintense lesions in anti-MOG-associated encephalitis with seizures (FLAMES) is a rare clinical phenotype of MOGAD in which cortical FLAIR high-signal lesions are unilateral, with little spread to the cortex and meninges bilaterally. Although cases of FLAMES have been consistently reported. However, to our knowledge, such cases of FLAMES combined with NMDARE are rare. CASE PRESENTATION: Here, we describe a case of FLAMES combined with anti-NMDARE. The patient was a young male, 29 years old, admitted to our hospital with isolated seizures, whose MRI showed unilateral thalamic and bilateral frontal and parietal leptomeningeal involvement. Since we were unaware of the possibility of bilateral meningo-cortical MOGAD manifestations, the case was initially diagnosed as viral encephalitis and was given antiviral therapy. The diagnosis was not clarified until anti-NMDAR-IgG and MOG-IgG positivity was detected in the cerebrospinal fluid and serum. The patient was then treated with high-dose corticosteroids and his symptoms responded well to the steroids. Therefore, this case expands the clinical spectrum of MNOS overlap syndrome. In addition, we describe the clinical features of MNOS by summarizing the existing literature and exploring the possible mechanisms of its immune response. CONCLUSIONS: Our case serves as a reminder to clinicians that when patients present with atypical clinical manifestations such as seizures, consideration should be given to MNOS and conduct testing for various relevant autoantibodies (including MOG abs) and viruses in both serum and cerebrospinal fluid, as it is easy to misdiagnose the disease as other CNS diseases, such as viral meningoencephalitis. This syndrome exhibits a high responsiveness to steroids, highlighting the critical importance of recognizing the clinical and neuroimaging features of this overlap syndrome for prompt diagnosis and treatment. Furthermore, it enriches the disease spectrum of MNOS.",

In addition to traditional treatment methods, herbal treatments from complementary and alternative medicine are actively followed. Naturally derived from plants, thymoquinone (TQ) has drawn a lot of attention in the field of cancer treatment. MK-801, an N-methyl-D-aspartate agonist, is used to improve memory and plasticity, but it has also lately been explored as a potential cancer treatment. This study aimed to determine the roles of N-Methyl-D-Aspartate agonists and Thymoquinone on mitochondria and apoptosis. HT-29 cells were treated with different TQ and MK-801 concentrations. We analyzed cell viability, apoptosis, and alteration of mitochondria. Cell viability significantly decreased depending on doses of TQ and MK-801. Apoptosis and mitochondrial dysfunctions induced by low and high doses of TQ and MK-801. Our study emphasizes the need for further safety evaluation of MK-801 due to the potential toxicity risk of TQ and MK-801. Optimal and toxic doses of TQ and MK-801 were determined for the treatment of colon cancer. It should be considered as a possibility that colon cancer can be treated with TQ and MK-801.",

A potent transition state analog of human ATCase (PALA) has previously been assessed in clinical trials for the treatment of cancer, but was ultimately unsuccessful. Additionally, inhibition of this pathway has been proposed to be a target to suppress cell proliferation in E. coli, the malarial parasite and tuberculosis. In this manuscript we screened a 70-member library of ATC inhibitors developed against the malarial and tubercular ATCases for inhibitors of the human ATC. Four compounds showed low nanomolar inhibition (IC50 30-120 nM) in an in vitro activity assay. These compounds significantly outperform PALA, which has a triphasic inhibition response under identical conditions, in which significant activity remains at PALA concentrations above 10 μM. Evidence for a druggable allosteric pocket in human ATC is provided by both in vitro enzyme kinetic, homology modeling and in silico docking. These compounds also suppress the proliferation of U2OS osteoblastoma cells by promoting cell cycle arrest in G0/G1 phase. This report provides the first evidence for an allosteric pocket in human ATC, which greatly enhances its druggability and demonstrates the potential of this series in cancer therapy.",

      "abstract": "Aspartate kinase (AK), an enzyme from the Wolbachia endosymbiont of Brugia malayi (WBm), plays a pivotal role in the bacterial cell wall and amino acid biosynthesis, rendering it an attractive candidate for therapeutic intervention. Allosteric inhibition of aspartate kinase is a prevalent mode of regulation across microorganisms and plants, often modulated by end products such as lysine, threonine, methionine, or meso-diaminopimelate. The intricate and diverse nature of microbial allosteric regulation underscores the need for rigorous investigation. This study employs a combined experimental and computational approach to decipher the allosteric regulation of WBmAK. Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations elucidate that ATP (cofactor) and ASP (substrate) binding induce a closed conformation, promoting enzymatic activity. In contrast, the binding of lysine (allosteric inhibitor) leads to enzyme inactivation and an open conformation. The enzymatic assay demonstrates the optimal activity of WBmAK at 28 °C and a pH of 8.0. Notably, the allosteric inhibition study highlights lysine as a more potent inhibitor compared to threonine. Importantly, this investigation sheds light on the allosteric mechanism governing WBmAK and imparts novel insights into structure-based drug discovery, paving the way for the development of effective inhibitors against filarial pathogens.",

Sixty-two studies were meta-analyzed using a random-effect model for each brain region.

We highlighted a gap of knowledge regarding NAA levels in first episode of depression patients. Sensitivity analyses indicated that antidepressant treatment may reverse NAA alterations in the frontal lobe. We highlighted field strength and correction for voxel grey matter as moderators of NAA levels detection.

      "abstract": "N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) antibody encephalitis is an autoimmune syndrome with potentially fatal sequelae causing profound dysregulation of neurotransmission. Patients most often present with a constellation of neuropsychiatric signs and symptoms, including behavioral changes, motor disturbances, and seizures. Frequently, the development of anti-NMDAR antibodies has been linked to specific malignancies, although the exact event that triggers the production of these antibodies remains unknown. We present a case of a 25-year-old female who came into the emergency room with behavioral changes and fever. The patient had non-convulsive seizures, catatonia, and orofacial dyskinesias during the course of the admission and was treated as a case of autoimmune anti-NMDAR encephalitis. Cranial and abdominal MRI with contrast initially showed negative results, while the serum and cerebrospinal fluid studies were positive for anti-NMDAR antibodies. The patient was noted to have significant clinical improvement after being treated with high-dose intravenous steroid therapy followed by intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) and rituximab infusion. She was discharged stable with the resolution of neurologic symptoms four months after the diagnosis. On follow-up with her neurologist two years later, an abdominal CT scan was done and showed mature cystic teratoma. This is one of the few documented cases of anti-NMDAR encephalitis with a good response to medical treatment but had a delayed diagnosis of ovarian teratoma seen on surveillance work-up years after the diagnosis. A high index of suspicion is warranted for the diagnosis, and treatment should be started early as soon as there is clinical suspicion of the disease. Also, surveillance pelvic or abdominal imaging is important in patients who have negative initial screening but have high risks for teratomas."
