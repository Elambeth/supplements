      "abstract": "Paprika, obtained from dried red pepper (C. annuum), is valued for its characteristic colour and flavour. Its carotenoid content, which is important for both sensory and nutritional quality, varies depending on several factors (agronomic conditions and technological treatment with special attention to the drying methods) that influence the colour and antioxidant capacity of the samples. This study investigated the effect of an accelerated thermal treatment (80 °C for 8 h) applied to evaluate the oxidative stability of the carotenoids and the colour of ground paprika depending on its origin (Peru or China). Changes in quality parameters (ASTA index and CIELAB colour), carotenoid content and profile (HPLC-DAD) and lipophilic antioxidant capacity (FRAP and ABTS•+ methods) were evaluated. Untreated Chinese samples had 30% more total carotenoids than Peruvian samples, but this was not reflected in ASTA units, indicating that at least a 50% carotenoid variation is required for significant differences. Treatment resulted in a carotenoid loss of 70% in Peruvian and 30% in Chinese samples, with changes in total carotenoids correlating positively with antioxidant capacity. Both origins had similar carotenoid profiles, with β-carotene being the predominant carotenoid, while distinct contents were observed between the origins. The higher content of esterified carotenoids in Chinese peppers resulted in better thermal stability. The results highlight the necessity for tailored production processes to maintain nutritional integrity and antioxidant capacity."

In this study, egg yolk phospholipids (EPL) and sunflower oil were utilized in making chili oil, and proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy was employed to quantify the concentrations of fatty acyl groups, carotenoids, capsaicinoids in chili oil according to their specific signals in the spectra. The results showed that the changes in the concentrations of fatty acyl groups in the control samples were greater than those in the EPL-treated samples at the same frying temperature, while the contents of carotenoids and capsaicinoids were significantly lower than those of the EPL-treated samples when fried at 150 °C (p < 0.05). Two-way ANOVA indicated that frying temperature and EPL treatment, as well as their interaction had significant impacts on the thermal-oxidative stability of chili oil (p < 0.05). The results suggest that EPL may act as antioxidants during frying, and EPL can improve the thermal-oxidative stability of chili oil.",

      "abstract": "Chili pepper is a prominent cultivated horticultural crop that is traditionally used for food seasoning and is applied for the treatment and prevention of multiple diseases. Its beneficial health properties are due to its abundance and variety of bioactive components, such as carotenoids, capsaicinoids, and vitamins. In particular, carotenoids have important nutraceutical properties, and several studies have focused on their potential in the prevention and treatment of human diseases. In this article, we reviewed the state of knowledge of general aspects of chili pepper carotenoids (biosynthesis pathway, types and content in Capsicum spp., and the effects of processing on carotenoid content) and recent findings on the effects of carotenoid nutraceuticals, such as antioxidant, cancer preventive, anti-inflammatory, cardiovascular disorder preventive, and anti-obesity effects.",

We found that pre-treatment with RPE, CST and BCT protected WB cells from H2O2-induced inhibition of GJIC. RPE, CST and BCT not only recovered connexin 43 (Cx43) mRNA expression but also prevented phosphorylation of Cx43 protein by H2O2 treatment. RPE attenuated the phosphorylation of ERK, p38 and JNK, whereas pre-treatment with CST and BCT only attenuated the phosphorylation of ERK and p38 and did not affect JNK in H2O2-treated WB cells. RPE, CST and BCT significantly suppressed the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in H2O2-treated cells compared to untreated WB cells. These results suggest that dietary intake of red paprika might be helpful for lowering the risk of diseases caused by oxidative stress.",

Globular-tubular chromoplasts of sapote contained numerous lipid globules and tubules embodying unique provitamin A keto-carotenoids in a lipid-dissolved and presumably liquid-crystalline form, respectively. Bioaccessibility of sapotexanthin and cryptocapsin was compared to that of structurally related keto-carotenoids from red bell pepper and salmon. Capsanthin from bell pepper was the most bioaccessible pigment, followed by sapotexanthin and cryptocapsin esters from mamey sapote. In contrast, astaxanthin from salmon was the least bioaccessible keto-carotenoid. Thermal treatment and fat addition consistently enhanced bioaccessibility, except for astaxanthin from naturally lipid-rich salmon, which remained unaffected. Although the provitamin A keto-carotenoids from sapote were highly bioaccessible, their qualitative and quantitative in vivo bioavailability and their conversion to vitamin A remains to be confirmed.",

Phenolic extracts inhibited mycelial growth of A.alternata by 38.46%, and significantly reduced conidial germination on the fifth day after treatment to 92% in relation to control. No significant changes were observed in the inhibition of mycelial growth in Fusarium oxysporum; however, the number of germinated conidia was reduced, showing 85% inhibition five days after treatment in relation to control. Moreover, carotenoid extracts showed 38.5% inhibition of mycelial growth and 85.3% inhibition of conidial germination of A.alternata, five days after treatment. Carotenoid extracts showed less inhibition of mycelial growth (20.3%) in F.oxysporum, with respect to A.alternata; while there was greater inhibition of conidial germination (96%) on the fifth day after treatment. Phenolic and carotenoid extracts from chiltepin may be a promising alternative as a natural fungicide against fungi of agricultural importance.",

      "abstract": "This study investigated the effects of carotenoid and capsaicin constituents of Capsicum on intestinal immune responses in mice. Peyer's patch (PP) cells were isolated from mice orally administered with capsaicin, or one of three carotenoids (beta-carotene, beta-cryptoxanthin, or lycopene), at 5 mg/kg/day for 7 consecutive days. Collagenase-separated PP cells were then cultured in the presence or absence of concanavalin A (Con A). PP cells from mice treated with capsaicin, beta-carotene, or beta-cryptoxanthin all showed significantly enhanced interleukin (IL)-2 and interferon (IFN)-gamma production when costimulated with 5 microg/mL Con A, with capsaicin having the greatest effect (approximately two times greater than in normal mice). No increase in the production of IL-2 or IL-4 was observed when PP cells from mice were cultured without Con A. We further tested the combined efficacy of carotenoids and capsaicin on intestinal T-cell cytokine production. Oral administration of capsaicin with beta-carotene, both at 5 mg/kg/day for 7 days, increased IFN-gamma and IL-2 production in cultured PP cells costimulated with Con A. In contrast, oral administration of beta-cryptoxanthin counteracted the stimulatory effect of capsaicin treatment on T-helper cytokine production. Flow cytometric analysis revealed that the population of IFN-gamma(+) and IL-4(+) cells in PPs from mice administered capsaicin and/or carotenoids did not change, which suggested that the effects of carotenoids and capsaicin on cytokine production were not due to changes in the lymphoid population in PPs. These results indicate that carotenoids and capsaicin, which are common components of foods such as Capsicum, mutually modulate T-cell immune responses to exogenous or endogenous inducers such as antigens in PPs, without changing the lymphoid population. Carotenoids modulate the potentiality of cytokine production in T cells or indirectly activate T cells but have no triggering effect such as Con A.",

Furthermore, extraction yields above 96% for carotenoids and 85% for capsaicinoids as separate fractions can be achieved using a sequential and selective two-stage extraction. Evidence is presented demonstrating that the content and extraction yield depend directly on the extent of the enzymatic hydrolysis of chili cell walls, and higher yields are obtained when the sample is completely hydrolyzed. The enzymatic treatment described here is a promising alternative to current industrial practices, and it improves the extraction of carotenoids and capsaicinoids from chili fruits.",

Two compounds of the first set were tentatively identified as 9,10,11,12,13,14,19,20-octanor-capsorubin (compound II) and 9,10,11,12,13,14,19,20-octanor-5,6-epoxide-capsanthin (compound IV), after isolation by semipreparative HPLC and analysis by EI-MS. Compounds VII, VIII, and IX from set 2 were assigned as 9,10,11,12,13,14,19,20-octanor-capsanthin and isomers, respectively. As these compounds were the major products formed in the thermal process, it was possible to apply derivatization techniques (hydrogenation and silylation) to analyze them by EI-MS, before and after chemical derivatization. Taking into account structures of the degradation products, the cyclization of polyolefins could be considered as the general reaction pathway in thermally induced reactions, yielding in the present study xylene as byproduct and the corresponding nor-carotenoids.",
