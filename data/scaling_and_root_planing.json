In each patient, the quadrants were divided into two sides (left and right); one side (2 quadrants) was randomly assigned to group 1: SRP (control) and the other side (2 quadrants) was assigned to group 2: SRP + a-PDT (test). The clinical and biochemical parameters were measured at baseline and 3 months. Independent t test and paired t test were used to compare between and within groups respectively. At 3rd month, group 2 showed significant improvement (p ≤ 0.05) in terms of clinical (PI, GI, PPD) and biochemical parameters (TAOC, TOS, OSI) than group 1. However, there was no significant difference in terms of CAL (p > 0.05). a-PDT, when used as an adjunct to SRP can positively influence periodontal parameters and oxidative stress biomarkers, thereby restoring the oxidative and antioxidant balance in periodontal tissues nurturing it from disease to health."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Periodontitis is a chronic inflammatory disease that damages the supporting structures of the teeth, primarily caused by dental plaque containing Gram-negative bacteria. These bacteria trigger an inflammatory host response leading to tissue destruction. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 84 patients with moderate to severe chronic periodontitis were randomly assigned to either a test group receiving 500 mg of hesperidin daily or a control group receiving a placebo both alongside scaling and root planing (SRP). Clinical parameters including the gingival index (GI), sulcus bleeding index (SBI), probing depth (PD), and clinical attachment level (CAL) were evaluated at baseline, 3 weeks, and 6 weeks. Serum C-reactive protein (CRP) levels were measured at baseline and 3 weeks to assess systemic inflammation. RESULTS: Of the 84 patients, 80 completed the study, with 60 males and 20 females. The test group showed significant reduction in serum CRP levels from baseline to 3 weeks (mean difference: 1.6300, P < 0.001), while the control group also showed a significant decrease (mean difference: -1.2730, P = 0.001). However, no statistically significant differences were found in clinical parameters (GI, SBI, PD, CAL) between the test and control groups at any time point. Intragroup analysis showed significant improvements in these parameters over time within both groups, indicating the effectiveness of SRP in managing clinical symptoms of periodontitis. CONCLUSION: Hesperidin significantly reduced serum CRP levels, indicating an anti-inflammatory effect, but did not result in significant improvements in clinical parameters compared to placebo."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: In order to assess the effectiveness of a laser-assisted new attachment method (LANAP) employing a diode in treating moderate to deep periodontal pockets, a split-mouth randomized controlled trial was carried out. METHODS: Ten participants, aged 18-65, with moderate to deep periodontal pockets were included in the research. The subjects were split into two groups, control and test, each with ten sites. Scaling and root planing (SRP) was applied to the control sites using a universal curette, whereas SRP and a diode laser were used on the test sites. At six and twenty-four weeks, the subjects were summoned back for a post-operative assessment. The clinical parameters, including the clinical attachment level (CAL), periodontal pocket depth (PPD), gingival index (GI), and plaque index (PI) for both groups were noted, and the information gathered was statistically examined. RESULTS: PPD and CAL in the test groups showed a clinically significant decline, and the values of the test and control groups at six and twenty-four weeks differed statistically significantly. CONCLUSION: Based on the study's findings, moderate-to-deep periodontal pockets may benefit from LANAP treatment before scaling."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Comprehensive mechanical debridement, like scaling and root planing (SRP), combined with proper plaque control, is the primary nonsurgical approach for managing periodontitis. However, it may not always eliminate infection due to inadequate debridement or inaccessible areas. For this, various chemotherapeutic allopathic and herbal local drug delivery (LDD) agents as adjuvants have been used with SRP for management of chronic periodontitis. METHODOLOGY: A randomized controlled clinical trial was conducted, comprising 60 sites from 20 patients. Each patient received three treatment modalities assigned to different quadrants: SRP with normal saline irrigation, SRP with LDD of tetracycline fibers, and SRP with LDD of 100% pure aloe vera gel. Clinical parameters were assessed at baseline, day 7, and 3 months postoperatively. RESULTS: The addition of 100% pure aloe vera gel and tetracycline fibers (Periodontal Plus ABTM) with SRP significantly improved the probing pocket depth (P < 0.05) compared to SRP with saline irrigation. Additionally, the tetracycline group showed significant reductions in plaque index (P < 0.05) and highly significant reductions in modified sulcular bleeding index (P < 0.001) compared to the saline group. CONCLUSION: Aloe vera gel with SRP shows comparable effectiveness to tetracycline fibers in managing chronic periodontitis, suggesting it as a cost-effective herbal alternative."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred and twenty patients with chronic periodontitis were included in this study and assigned into three groups. In Group I, Group II, and Group III, SRP was done followed by subgingival application of ozonated olive oil, plain olive oil, and chlorhexidine gel in Group I, II, and III, respectively, at baseline 7, 14, and 21 days. Recordings of clinical parameters (gingival index [GI], probing pocket depth [PPD], clinical attachment level [CAL]) were done at baseline and one month. RESULTS: The mean GI, PPD, and CAL scores at baseline for Group I was 2.78 ± 0.42, 2.78 ± 0.42, and 2.66 ± 0.38; for Group II was 2.64 ± 0.39, 6.40 ± 0.50, and 6.40 ± 0.50; and for Group III was 6.00 ± 0.00, 6.40 ± 0.50, and 6.40 ± 0.50, and the scores after one month for Group I was 1.10 ± 0.38, 0.21 ± 0.07, and 0.07 ± 0.05; for Group II was 0.05 ± 0.05, 5.40 ± 0.50, and 5.75 ± 0.44; and for Group III was 5.00 ± 0.00, 5.75 ± 0.44, and 5.28 ± 0.45, with the level of significance being (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: The ozonated olive oil and chlorhexidine gel have shown significant improvement in periodontal health compared to plain olive oil. Ozonated olive oil can be used as local drug delivery (LDD), an adjunct to SRP in chronic periodontitis which is safe and well accepted by patients without any noticeable side effects."

      "abstract": "Periodontitis constitutes the primary cause of tooth loss among adults in China. The disease is characterized by the high morbidity, which significantly impairs both oral and systemic health. As the key insights of initial periodontal therapy, subgingival scaling and root planing (SRP) have been considered as simple, effective, and cost-efficient treatment approaches for managing periodontal inflammation. Substantial published evidences indicated that the majority of patients diagnosed with periodontitis could achieve lifelong retention of their natural teeth through standardized initial periodontal therapy, rigorous plaque control, and long-term supportive periodontal treatment. However, the proficiency in periodontal diagnosis and treatment among general dental practitioners in China is heterogeneous, with a notable scarcity of periodontists and a suboptimal level of SRP standardization. Drawing upon over four decades of clinical expertise from Peking University School and Hospital of Stomatology as well as comprehensive literature reviews, this paper meticulously outlines the standardized procedures for SRP, aiming at guiding clinicians to perform standardized SRP step by step, and thereby enhancing clinical efficacy of periodontal treatment, promoting periodontal health, and ultimately improving patients' quality of life.",

Ten weeks before the experiment, 48 female rats were ovariectomized. On day 0, a ligature was installed in the lower first molar to induce EP. From day 0 to day 42, half of the rats were treated with vehicle (VEH), while the other half were treated with 100μg/Kg of zoledronate (ZOL). On day 14, the rats were allocated into the following groups: VEH-NLT, VEH-SRP, VEH-SRP-GPlnp, ZOL-NLT, ZOL-SRP, and ZOL-SRP-GPlnp. VEH-NLT and ZOL-NLT received no local treatment. VEH-SRP and ZOL-SRP received SRP and irrigation with physiological saline solution. VEH-SRP-GPlnp and ZOL-SRP-GPlnp received SRP and irrigation with GPlnp. A single SRP session was carried out, and four irrigation sessions were conducted (on days 14, 16, 18, and 20). On day 42, all animals were euthanized. The hemimandibles were processed for histological, histometric (percentage of total bone tissue (PTBT) and non-vital bone tissue (PNVBT)) and immunohistochemical (TNFα, IL-1β, and TRAP) analysis. VEH-SRP-GPlnp showed better tissue repair, higher PTBT, and lower immunolabeling for TNFα and IL-1β compared to the groups treated with VEH. ZOL-SRP-GPlnp showed a favorable tissue repair, with lower PNVBT, less local inflammation, and lower immunolabeling for TNFα and IL-1β compared to the groups treated with ZOL. Irrigation with GPlnp proved to be effective as an adjuvant therapy to SRP in treating EP in ovariectomized rats treated with zoledronate.",

MATERIALS AND METHODS:  The patients underwent periodontal therapy in two sessions. At the beginning of the first session, quadrants I and IV and II and III were randomly assigned to GBT or SRP treatment. Periodontal parameters were collected at baseline, 6 weeks (T1), and 3 months (T2) after therapy. The primary outcome was the number of experimental sites (pocket probing depth [PPD] >4 and <10 mm) becoming closed pockets (PPD ≤ 4 mm bleeding on probing [BOP] negative) at T1 and T2. Secondary outcomes were PPD, recession, clinical attachment level, BOP, and plaque index variations at the experimental sites and treatment time. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS:  A 10% difference in the primary outcome between the two protocols was set as the threshold to define inferiority/noninferiority of the test treatment. The primary outcome was modeled using a generalized estimating equation model to account for intrapatient measurement correlation. The estimates are reported as differences between groups' percentages (treatments or time points) and corresponding 95% confidence interval (95% CI). All analyses assumed a significance level of 5%. RESULTS:  A total of 32 patients were selected. Mean PPD (mm) reduced from 6.23 (6.06-6.40) to 3.33 (3.06-3.61) at T2 for GBT, and from 6.21 (6.04-6.38) to 3.32 (3.11-3.53) at T2 for SRP. Both treatments reached a comparable percentage of closed pockets at T1 (77.9% for GBT vs. 80.1% for SRP, p = 0.235) and T2 (84.1% for GBT vs. 84.4% for SRP, p = 0.878), with no statistically or clinically significant difference. GBT and traditional SRP with ultrasonic and hand instruments reach satisfactory clinical results in the active treatment of patients with stages III and IV periodontitis, with comparable rates of closed pockets and treatment time. CONCLUSION:  GBT is a suitable option in the active phase of periodontitis management in patients with stages III and IV periodontitis."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A split-mouth randomized controlled trial was designed on 25 systemically healthy participants with 50 sites having chronic periodontitis. Two sites were selected for each patient and were randomly allocated into two groups. A total of 50 sites were selected and divided into two groups with 25 test sites in group I (Test group) and 25 control sites in group II (Control group). Group I received scaling and root planing (SRP) followed by placement of BlueM oral gel, while group II received SRP alone. Probing pocket depth (PPD), clinical attachment level (CAL), gingival index (GI), and bleeding on probing (BOP) were recorded at baseline and after 6 weeks and were compared accordingly. RESULTS: The results revealed a reduction in PPD, CAL, GI, and BOP in both groups. However, the test group showed a statistically significant reduction when compared with the control group in the above-mentioned clinical parameters. CONCLUSION: The results suggested that the use of oxygen-releasing gel with SRP provided additional benefits in the management of chronic periodontitis by promoting greater reductions in the clinical parameters. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: BlueM oral gel, i.e. the oxygen-releasing gel as a local drug delivery, may be an excellent adjunct to SRP in treating chronic periodontitis.

This study aimed to compare the clinical effectiveness of subgingivally delivered 0.5% azithromycin gel and 1% chlorhexidine gel as adjuncts to SRP in the management of chronic periodontitis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A comparative clinical evaluation was conducted involving 60 participants diagnosed with chronic periodontitis. They were randomly assigned to two groups: Group A received subgingival application of 0.5% azithromycin gel after SRP, whereas Group B received 1% chlorhexidine gel in a similar manner. Clinical parameters including probing pocket depth (PPD), clinical attachment level (CAL), and gingival index (GI) were recorded at baseline and 3-month follow-up. RESULTS: Both groups demonstrated significant improvements in clinical parameters after treatment. However, Group A exhibited a greater reduction in PPD (mean decrease of 2.5 mm) compared with Group B (mean decrease of 1.8 mm). Similarly, Group A showed a higher gain in CAL (mean gain of 2.3 mm) compared with Group B (mean gain of 1.5 mm). In addition, a significant reduction in GI was observed in both groups, with Group A showing slightly better outcomes. CONCLUSION: Subgingivally delivered 0.5% azithromycin gel demonstrated superior clinical efficacy as an adjunct to SRP in the treatment of chronic periodontitis compared with 1% chlorhexidine gel. The findings suggest that azithromycin gel may serve as a promising therapeutic option in managing periodontal disease."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Periodontal disease is a host-mediated inflammation caused due to microbial challenge. Hence, mechanisms involving the control of host-associated mediators can be a potential target. The conventional nonsurgical periodontal treatment modality includes scaling and root planing (SRP), which is often combined with adjunctive chemical plaque control agents for effective disease control. Chlorhexidine (CHX) is the most common chemical plaque control agent used. Recent research is now being focused on exploring other medicinal substitutes that may benefit control of inflammation and tissue healing. Folic acid is an important nutrient that increases the ability of oral epithelial cells to resist local irritants and inflammation if supplemented either systemically or locally. AIM: The current study aimed to evaluate the effect of folic acid and CHX mouthwash as an adjunct to scaling and root planing for treating patients with chronic periodontitis. METHODOLOGY: In this study, 30 patients with chronic periodontitis were included and assigned to either of the two groups: Group A (receiving folic acid-containing mouthrinse) and Group B (receiving CHX mouthrinse). Periodontal measurements, including plaque index, probing pocket depth, gingival index, and healing index, were evaluated at baseline and again four weeks after scaling and root planing. RESULTS: Significant reduction was detected in all clinical parameters (plaque index, gingival index, probing pocket depth, healing index) for both groups (p<0.05) when evaluated from baseline to four weeks. CONCLUSION: Both mouthrinses were effective when used as an adjunct to scaling and root planing in the treatment of periodontitis. Hence, folic acid-containing mouthrinse can be used in patients with chronic periodontitis."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: To demonstrate the potential application of mixed reality (MR) holographic imaging technology in subgingival scaling and root planing (SRP) for patient with advanced periodontitis. METHODS: This case series comprised the analysis of 1566 sites from 261 teeth of 10 patients with advanced periodontitis. Digital CBCT scans and intraoral scans of the patients were digitally acquired preoperatively and aligned to create a three-dimensional periodontal visualization model. Through rendering, interactive holographic images were displayed using MR. The surgeon first used MR images to communicate with the patients, and then facilitated SRP under their guidance. Probing pocket depth (PPD), clinical attachment loss (CAL), Plaque index (PI), and bleeding on probing (BOP) parameters were recorded at baseline and at 8-week postoperatively. Patient-reported outcome indicator questionnaires on self-efficacy were also collected. RESULTS: PPD, CAL, PI, and BOP significantly decreased at 8-week following MR hologram-assisted SRP (p<0.001). For sites with PPD≥4 mm, PPD and CAL declined by 2.33±1.23 mm and 0.69±1.07 mm, respectively. PI significantly decreased from 1.94±0.61 to 0.82±0.58 (p < 0.001) and BOP sites decreased significantly from 84.11% to 40.25%. After receiving MR holograms for condition communication, most patients had a better perception of the effectiveness of SRP treatment and the benefits it brings. 80% of the subjects expressed their willingness to undergo MR-assisted periodontal treatment in the future. CONCLUSION: These results provide preliminary support for MR hologram-assisted digital SRP. With this technology, images of the gingiva and alveolar bone can be displayed in real time, accurately and three-dimensionally. This improves SRP effectiveness, diminishes complications, and enhances patients' confidence in the treatment. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: MR holographic imaging-based digital SRP is a clinically feasible and promising adjunctive periodontal treatment option. It may contribute to improved non-surgical treatment efficacy in patients with severe periodontitis.",

METHODS: Twelve patients with periodontitis were enrolled in this split-mouth, randomized clinical trial. A total of 24 shallow periodontal pockets (4-6 mm) were treated by either ScRp alone (control) or PRF (test). Clinical attachment loss (CAL), probing pocket depth (PPD), bleeding on probing (BOP), and plaque index (PLI), as well as platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB) by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) were measured at baseline and at 1- and 3-month follow-up visits. RESULTS: At 1- and 3-month follow-up visits, greater CAL gains (2.6 ± 0.25 mm and 3.26 ± 0.31 mm, respectively) and PPD reductions (2.58 ± 0.38 and 3.31 ± 0.39 mm, respectively) were observed in the test group compared to those in controls (CAL gain of 1.01 ± 0.49 mm and 1.43 ± 0.48 mm; PPD reduction of 1.1 ± 0.55 and 1.37 ± 0.49 mm, respectively). In addition, the increase in PDGF-BB in GCF in the test group (724.5 ± 186.09 pg/μl and 1957.5 ± 472.9 pg/μl) was significantly greater than that in controls (109.3 ± 24.07 and 614.64 ± 209.3 pg/μl) at 1- and 3-month follow-up visits, respectively.

      "abstract": "Scaling and root planing (SRP) removes bacterial plaque, calculus, and associated microorganisms from the surface of the tooth and the surrounding soft tissue. While complete eradication of pathogenic microbes is impossible, gross removal can lower the microbial load, which in turn reduces inflammation and contributes to positive clinical outcomes. Instrumentation in limited-access anatomic areas like furcation, grooves, deep pockets, concavities, and distal molar areas is technically demanding with traditional mechanical debridement. However, emerging advanced systems such as lasers with bactericidal and detoxification effects offer the benefit of reaching limited-access areas that traditional SRP cannot reach. A digitized search was done on PubMed, Embase, Medline, and Google Scholar using the keywords \"lasers\", \"periodontal therapy\", \"scaling\", and \"root planing\". Upon screening and reviewing, the shortlisted articles comprised narrative reviews, systematic reviews, randomized controlled trials, comparative studies, split-mouth studies, case series, and reports of non-surgical laser therapy and lasers as an adjunct to SRP. This review presents a comprehensive comparative evaluation of different laser modalities utilized in non-surgical periodontal treatment in contrast to standard SRP, rather than an exhaustive article review. It delves into the history and development of lasers, highlighting key advancements made in the realm of periodontics and dental care. This review includes an elucidation of the theory behind laser operation, along with an exploration of its intrinsic characteristics and breakdown of the various types of lasers that are currently available, and an examination of existing literature in both present and historical contexts regarding the comparison of various types of lasers with traditional periodontal treatment."

      "abstract": "Background Chronic localized periodontitis is a prevalent and persistent inflammatory condition in which there is the gradual degradation of the gingiva, periodontal ligament fibers, and alveolar bone loss. The objectives of periodontal therapy encompass not solely the elimination of local factors from the periodontal pocket but also the eradication of the dysbiotic microbial milieu to restore periodontal health. The present study aimed to compare the efficacy of scaling and root planing (SRP) with and without the placement of placental extract gel in the therapeutic management of chronic localized periodontitis under magnification. Materials and methods The present investigation encompassed 40 sites in 20 systemically healthy patients with chronic localized periodontitis. The allocation of the sites was done randomly, resulting in two distinct groups: group I (test site) and group II (control site). Group I was subjected to SRP, followed by the placement of placental extract gel, while group II solely received SRP. Clinical evaluations of pocket probing depth, plaque index, relative attachment level (RAL), gingival index (GI), and bleeding on probing (BoP) were performed at each site at baseline, six weeks, and three months. Results Placental extract gel as an accompaniment to SRP showed significant improvement in clinical parameters like pocket probing depth, RAL, GI, and BoP. Conclusion Placental extract gel may significantly act as a local drug delivery agent in the treatment of localized periodontal pockets."

      "abstract": "Background Periodontitis, characterized by chronic inflammation and tissue destruction, remains a significant public health concern. Conventional treatment like scaling and root planing (SRP) is effective but often augmented with adjunctive therapies to improve outcomes. Local drug delivery (LDD) systems containing pharmacological agents offer targeted treatment with reduced systemic side effects. Rosuvastatin (RSV), known for its anti-inflammatory and tissue regenerative properties, has shown promise in periodontal therapy. This prospective clinical trial assessed the effectiveness of 1.2% RSV hydrogel as an adjunct to SRP in managing generalized chronic periodontitis. Methods Thirty patients were grouped into Group A (SRP alone) and Group B (SRP + 1.2% RSV hydrogel). Clinical measurements, such as the modified sulcular bleeding index (mSBI), probing pocket depth (PPD), and clinical attachment level (CAL), were documented both at the beginning of the study and after three months. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS software. A p-value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results Participants in Group B showed significant improvements in mSBI (from 2.34 ± 0.59 to 1.01 ± 0.29), PPD (from 7.36 ± 1.12 mm to 4.63 ± 0.88 mm), and CAL (from 8.56 ± 1.22 mm to 5.90 ± 1.24 mm) compared to Group A at the three-month follow-up. The mean values of these parameters decreased significantly in both groups from baseline to three months. However, the reductions were more substantial in Group B, indicating the beneficial effect of RSV hydrogel adjunctive therapy. Conclusion The study demonstrates the efficacy of 1.2% RSV hydrogel employed as a localized drug in enhancing the outcomes of SRP for generalized chronic periodontitis. The adjunctive use of RSV hydrogel led to noteworthy enhancements in clinical parameters, highlighting its potential in periodontal therapy."

METHODS: Seventeen patients were included in this split-mouth randomized clinical trial. Sites with probing pocket depth (PPD) ≥5 mm in combination with bleeding on probing in different quadrants were randomized into the control group, the group with a single PDT application right after SRP, and the group with three repeated PDT applications 1 week after SRP. The subgingival plaque was collected for 16S rRNA gene sequencing at baseline, Week 2, and Week 8. RESULTS: Seventeen patients with 60 sites completed this 8-week follow-up, and 157 subgingival plaques were successfully analyzed by sequencing. Significant improvements were observed in two primary outcomes: PPD at Week 8 and subgingival microbial composition. Compared to the control group, the repeated-PDT group showed a notable improvement in PPD, substantial alterations in the microbial profile, including a reduction in α-diversity and anaerobic bacteria, and an increase in aerobic bacteria at Week 2. Secondary outcomes, such as clinical attachment level and sulcus bleeding index, also showed improvement at Week 8. Furthermore, both the single- and repeated-PDT groups exhibited a decrease in periodontopathogens and an increase in beneficial bacteria compared with baseline. CONCLUSION: PDT promotes changes in the microbial composition of periodontitis patients' subgingival plaque in a direction favorable to periodontal health, and repeated PDT is a promising adjunctive therapy for periodontal treatment.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION:  The primary goal of periodontal therapy is to arrest the inﬂammatory disease process which is done by non-surgical and surgical therapies in order to reduce the microorganisms. The outcome of periodontal therapy may not reveal the desired results owing to inaccessible areas for instrumentation, pathogenicity, resistance of the microorganisms, or even due to compromised host response to the treatment. Thus, adjunctive laser therapy has been proposed as a novel treatment modality in the treatment of periodontal disease.  Aim: The aim of this study was to clinically evaluate the effect of a 980 nm diode laser (DEN10B; Wuhan Gigaa Optronics Technology Co., Ltd., Wuhan, China) therapy as an adjunct to scaling and root planing in patients with chronic periodontitis and type II diabetes. METHODS: Twenty patients were divided into two groups in a split-mouth study design. Group I (Control) comprised mechanical debridement alone and Group II (test) comprised mechanical debridement followed by adjunctive laser therapy. The clinical parameters were recorded at baseline, six weeks, and three months, and the results were analyzed. RESULTS: There was a significant improvement in gingival and plaque index in the test group. Though there was no significant improvement in probing pocket depth and clinical attachment, the results in the test group were superior relative to the control group. CONCLUSION: Non-surgical periodontal therapy with adjunctive use of diode laser is effective in the management of generalized chronic periodontitis in patients with type II diabetes which led to a significant reduction in plaque score, gingival index score, probing pocket depth, and gain in clinical attachment level."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This randomized controlled split-mouth study included 60 patients who scored 9 or above on the dental anxiety scale (DAS) and required SRP in at least two quadrants with at least five teeth and two sites with a probing depth of ≥4 mm. Randomly chosen quadrants were treated using virtual reality glasses, and other quadrants were treated without glasses at the same visit. During VRD, a video of nature scenes was projected onto the screen in front of the patient's eyes. DAS and a visual analogue scale about patient feelings were applied at the end of the procedure. RESULTS: With VRD, the scale value of pain and discomfort level (VASP) was significantly reduced (p = 0.01, d = 0.57). Starting treatment without glasses significantly decreased VASP in both control and test sides (p = 0.00, d = 0.85; p = 0.00, d = 0.80, respectively) and increased the sensation of immersion and realism (p = 0.03, d = 0.45; p = 0.02, d = 0.46, respectively). Intraoperative and postoperative DAS values were significantly lower in patients who started treatment without VRD (p = 0.04, d = 0.34; p = 0.02, d = 0.44, respectively). Of the patients, 63.3% preferred VRD in the subsequent treatment. While patient preference did not correlate with sex, it correlated with age (r = -0.48, p = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The VRD and initiating SRP procedure with VRD affected the pain and discomfort level in anxious periodontitis patients. In addition, the anxiety level was also affected by starting the procedure with glasses.",

Curcumin, one of the main components of Curcumin longa, has been well known to possess antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, and even anticarcinogenic properties. This systematic review assessed the impact of local application of curcumin in the pocket on the clinical and microbiologic parameters as an adjunct to scaling and root planing in periodontitis patients. METHODS: The electronic literature search retrieved 61 studies from PubMed, MEDLINE, and ScienceDirect. After screening titles, abstracts, and keywords and reading through these articles, we identified 9 articles meeting all inclusion criteria, which were included for systematic review. RESULTS: There was a significant difference in both clinical parameters in a short duration of a month after curcumin chips were placed as an adjunct to scaling and root planing as compared to the control. Local application of curcumin also results in slight to significant reduction in the red complex microorganisms. CONCLUSION: This review suggested that local application of curcumin can be considered as a viable adjunct to mechanical debridement in periodontitis. However, further studies need to be conducted to establish its optimum dose, delivery method, and frequency in achieving the best clinical outcomes.",

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-two patients were split into Nd:YAG group (n = 11) and SRP group (n = 11). Patients in the Nd:YAG group received SRP and auxiliary Nd:YAG laser treatment; patients in the SRP group received SRP treatment only. Periodontal tissue inflammation and glycemic control were assessed and analyzed during the treatment period and the changes of subgingival microbiome were analyzed by full-length 16S rRNA sequencing. RESULTS: After 3 months of treatment, PD and CAL values improved significantly in the Nd:YAG group compared to the SRP group. BOP in both groups improved significantly after treatment. FPG levels in the Nd:YAG group were significantly reduced after treatment. Porphyromonas and Porphyromonadaceae were enriched in the Nd:YAG group at baseline, and Fusobacteriota, Fusobacteriia, Fusobacteriales, Leptotrichiaceae, and Leptotrichia were enriched after treatment. CONCLUSION: Nd:YAG laser-assisted SRP therapy has additional benefits in improving periodontal tissue inflammation and blood glucose control in periodontitis patients with T2DM compared with SRP therapy alone and there was a trend towards a decrease in disease-associated taxa and an increase in health-associated taxa following auxiliary Nd:YAG laser treatment. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The effects of Nd:YAG laser-assisted SRP treatment on inflammation, glucose control, and subgingival microbiome in periodontitis patients with T2DM were elucidated, and new ideas for the treatment of T2DM periodontitis were provided.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The main feature of periodontitis is the development of periodontal pockets as a secondary consequence, which is mainly caused by an excessive immune response to the dental biofilm. The prime factor in the pathogenesis of periodontitis is an increase in oxidative stress. Numerous clinical studies have demonstrated that antioxidant supplementation can reduce endogenous antioxidant depletion and the oxidative damage that goes along with it. Hence, antioxidant therapy in the treatment of periodontal disease may prove to be a promising tool. OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study is to compare the efficiency of three different antioxidants as oral supplements. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eighty patients with chronic periodontitis were randomly split into four groups. The control group received scaling and root planning (SRP), and the test group received oral supplements for 30 days with SRP. Pocket depth (PD), clinical attachment level (CAL), oral hygiene index-simplified (OHI-S), and sulcus bleeding index (SBI) were evaluated at baseline and 30 days. The analysis of the data was done with ANOVA, Kruskal-Wallis, and post hoc tests. The significance level was set at p<0.05 and p<0.001. RESULTS: All groups resulted in a statistically significant reduction in all parameters from baseline to one month. The treatment groups revealed a statistically significant reduction in PD and CAL (p<0.00) but no reduction in OHI-S and SBI (p>0.05) scores. A highly statistically significant reduction was observed in PD with green coffee bean extract when compared with other groups. CONCLUSION: Green coffee bean extract oral supplements may prove to be a promising appendage in therapeutic and prophylactic fashion, along with SRP, in the treatment of stage III grade B periodontitis patients."

This study is aimed to examine the changes in LXA4 levels in gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) after scaling and root planing (SRP) and to determine the relationship between LXA4 levels and treatment outcomes and periodontal pathogens in severe periodontitis. METHODS: A total of 74 GCF samples were collected from 21 severe periodontitis participants at the deepest affected sites. These sites were re-sampled at 1, 3, and 6 months after SRP. Besides, GCF samples were also collected from 25 periodontally healthy participants. Clinical parameters including probing depth (PD) and clinical attachment level (CAL) in periodontitis group were recorded. LXA4 levels and periodontal pathogens in the GCF were analyzed by ELISA and PCR, respectively. Correlations between GCF LXA4 levels and treatment effect and periodontal pathogens were assessed. RESULTS: LXA4 levels in GCF significantly increased after SRP (p < 0.05), but remained lower than those observed in healthy individuals (p < 0.05). Sites with lower baseline LXA4 concentrations were more likely to experience greater improvements in PD at 6 months post-SRP (area under the curve [AUC] = 0.792), and the improvements were positively correlated with the increase of LXA4 at these sites post-treatment (p < 0.05). Furthermore, more elevated LXA4 levels were observed in sites that became negative for Prevotella intermedia or Tannerella forsythia after SRP. CONCLUSION: Baseline LXA4 in GCF has the potential to predict the site-specific response of severe periodontal lesions to SRP. The increase of LXA4 levels after treatment was positively correlated with clinical improvements and negatively correlated with the presence of Prevotella intermedia or Tannerella forsythia.",

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a randomized, examiner-blind, parallel-design, 24-week clinical study. Eligible subjects were 18-75 years of age with Stage I or II periodontitis. All subjects received scaling and root planing (SRP) within 28 days of enrollment. Thereafter, subjects were randomized to twice daily at-home use of either a powered toothbrush (PTB) or a manual toothbrush (MTB). Randomization was balanced for gender and periodontitis stage. No other oral hygiene aids were permitted. Subjects were evaluated every 4 weeks for the following measures: bleeding on probing (BOP), surface plaque (MPI), probing pocket depth (PPD) and clinical attachment level until Week 24. RESULTS: Of 328 randomized subjects, 299 subjects completed the study. For BOP at Week 24, the Least Squares (LS) Mean, standard error (SE) reduction from baseline was 0.24 (0.01) for the PTB group and 0.02 (0.01) for the MTB group, resulting in a statistically significant treatment difference of 0.22 (0.01), p-value < 0.0001. There were also concomitant reductions in MPI and PPD at Week 24, resulting in statistically significant (p-value < 0.0001) LS Mean (SE) treatment differences of 0.86 (0.04) and 0.24 (0.01), for MPI and PPD, respectively. CONCLUSION: When combined with SRP, daily home oral hygiene maintenance including a powered toothbrush significantly reduced clinical symptoms of periodontitis and surface plaque levels compared to a manual toothbrush in a Stage I/II periodontitis population.

      "abstract": "Background Periodontitis, a chronic inflammatory disease, is triggered by the plaque biofilm culminating in periodontal attachment loss, bone loss, and tooth loss. Diabetes, a globally prevalent disease, causes an increased inflammatory response to the microflora associated with periodontitis. It has been observed that the link between these two diseases is bidirectional. Tissue repair is impaired in diabetic patients with periodontitis. Local drug delivery systems selectively target the inflamed sites contrary to systemic antibiotics which lead to resistance and many other adverse effects. Probiotics aid in the growth of beneficial microorganisms and have immunomodulatory effects on the host. Tetracyclines have anti-collagenase properties and reduce the bacterial load, curbing the progression of periodontitis. Interleukin (IL) 1β, a strong marker of periodontal tissue destruction, plays a pivotal role in inflammation, immune regulation, and bone resorption in periodontitis. This study evaluated and compared the benefits of probiotics and tetracycline fibers when used as adjunctive tools after scaling and root planing (SRP) on IL1β levels in type 2 diabetic patients with periodontitis. Methodology A total of 36 patients participated in this study. Group I included 12 patients with periodontitis and uncontrolled diabetes (HbA1c levels >7). After SRP, six patients received tetracycline fibers (IA), and six patients received probiotics (1B) as locally delivered agents. Group II included 12 patients with periodontitis and diabetes under control (HbA1c levels 6-7%). After SRP, six patients received tetracycline fibers (IIA), and six patients received probiotics (IIB) as locally delivered drugs (test groups). Group III, the control group, included 12 patients with periodontitis only, wherein a placebo was used as a local drug delivery (LDD) after SRP. The clinical parameters, such as plaque index, gingival index, and probing pocket depth, were recorded preoperatively and at eight and 12 weeks after non-surgical periodontal therapy. IL1β levels were assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay at baseline and six weeks after SRP. Results On intra and intergroup comparison, all groups showed improvement in both the clinical and biochemical parameters but significant results were seen in Group IIA (p < 0.01) when compared to the other groups. Conclusions Group II (well-controlled diabetics) performed significantly better than the other groups, which was followed by Group III. The use of LDDs as adjunctive tools after SRP was not beneficial in Group I (uncontrolled diabetics)."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Periodontal disease is a common infectious disease that leads to the destruction of tooth-supporting structures. Current treatments, such as scaling and root planing (SRP), have limitations in deep and complex pockets, and antibiotic use carries the risk of resistance. Sterify Gel, a medical device composed of polyvinyl polymers, hydroxytyrosol, nisin, and magnesium ascorbyl phosphate, offers a new approach to periodontal care. This study aims to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Sterify Gel as an adjunctive treatment to SRP in promoting the healing of periodontal pockets. METHODS: The study includes 34 patients with moderate to advanced chronic periodontal disease. Randomization assigned one site for SRP alone (control) and the other site for SRP with Sterify Gel (treatment). Periodontal parameters were evaluated at baseline, 1, 2, and 3 months after treatment bacterial contamination was assessed through quantitative PCR at baseline and 3 months after treatment. Statistical analysis was conducted using ANOVA and Wilcoxon test. RESULTS: Treatment with Sterify Gel and SRP demonstrated significant improvements in pocket depth, gingival recession, and clinical attachment level compared with SRP alone. Bleeding and plaque indexes, pain perception, tooth mobility, and furcations showed no significant differences between the two groups. The treatment group showed a reduction in bacterial contamination at 3 months. CONCLUSIONS: Sterify Gel in combination with SRP shows the potential for improving periodontal health by promoting healing and reducing periodontal pockets. It may offer benefits in preventing bacterial recolonization and reducing reliance on antibiotics."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To assess the effects of amoxicillin and metronidazole with scaling and root planing (SRP) on periodontal parameters and glycemic control in patients with severe periodontitis and diabetes mellitus. BACKGROUND: Adjunctive antibiotics use is advantageous for treating periodontitis in patients with severe periodontitis and diabetes. However, the effects of adjunctive antibiotic use on hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels remain unclear. METHODS: This short-term, randomized controlled trial enrolled patients with severe periodontitis and type 2 diabetes. The patients were randomly allocated to SPR only (i.e., control) or SPR + antibiotics (500 mg of amoxicillin and 200 mg of metronidazole, three times daily for 7 days) groups. Periodontal and hematological parameters were assessed at baseline and 3 months after treatment. Inter- and intra-group analyses were performed using Student's t-tests, Mann-Whitney U tests, and the binary logistic regression models. p-values of <.05 were considered statistically significant. RESULTS: This study enrolled 49 patients, with 23 and 26 patients in the SRP-only and SRP + antibiotics groups, respectively. The periodontal parameters improved significantly and similarly in both groups after treatment (p < .05). The SRP + antibiotics group had more sites of improvement than the SRP-only group when the initial probing depth was >6 mm. (698 [78.96%] vs. 545 [73.35%], p = .008). The HbA1c levels decreased in the SRP-only and SRP + antibiotics groups after treatment (0.39% and 0.53%, respectively). The multivariable binary logistic regression model demonstrated that antibiotics administration and a high baseline HbA1c level were associated with a greater reduction in the HbA1c level (odds ratio = 4.551, 95% confidence interval: 1.012-20.463; odds ratio = 7.162, 95% confidence interval: 1.359-37.753, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: SRP and SRP plus systemic antibiotics were beneficial for glycemic control. Adjunctive antibiotic use slightly improved the outcome for patients with severe periodontitis and poorly controlled diabetes.",

AIM: The aim of this randomized controlled open clinical study was to evaluate the early clinical and immunological effects of the long-course azithromycin as an adjunct to scaling and root planing in periodontitis. METHODS: 50 patients (with stage I-III, grade A/B periodontitis) and 22 periodontally healthy volunteers as the reference group were recruited. Following scaling and root planing (SRP), the patients were randomly assigned to one of two treatment modalities: SRP only (n = 25) and adjunct azithromycin (Az) treatment (n = 25). The patients were monitored at baseline, and 30 ± 5 days after therapy. Clinical attachment loss (CAL), periodontal probing depth (PPD) and bleeding on probing (BoP) were evaluated. Secondary outcome measures included mean changes in single-positive CD68 + and CD163 + macrophages (Mφs) density and ratio, evaluated by immunohistochemistry, and IL1-β, IL-6, IL-10, TGF-β levels, detected by ELISA. RESULTS: At 1 month both groups showed significant improvements of CAL, PPD and BoP, without significant added benefit in terms of CAL, PPD and BoP of Az. But Az increased the density of CD68 + and CD163 + Mφs (P < 0.0001), decreased the CD68+/CD163 + ratio (P = 0.043), decreased IL-1β (P < 0.01), IL-6 (P < 0.001) levels, and increased IL-10 (P < 0.0001) and TGF-β (P < 0.001) levels compared to SRP and periodontitis at baseline. CONCLUSION: The long course of Az demonstrated modulation of CD68 + and CD163 + Mφs towards M2 polarization, which may play a significant role in achieving favorable long-term treatment outcomes.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: seventy patients were selected from the Department of Oral Medicine and Periodontology, Faculty of Dentistry, Mansoura University, and sixteen patients were excluded. Patients in groups II and III included stage II grade A periodontitis. The participants were classified into three groups: group I as a negative control group (individuals with healthy gingiva), group II (SRP) were treated with SRP, and group III (curcumin gel) which was applied weekly for four weeks after SRP. Clinical indices (plaque index (PI), gingival index (GI), clinical attachment level (CAL), and probing depth (PD)) and saliva samples for procalcitonin (PCT) assessment using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) test were collected and measured at both baselines and after six weeks. RESULTS: This randomized controlled clinical trial registered on ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT05667376) and first posted at 28/12/2022 included Fifty-four patients (20 male; 34 female). Regarding the age and sex distribution, there was no statistically significant difference between the three studied groups (p > 0.05). There was no significant statistical difference regarding PI, GI, PPD, and CAL between group II and group III at baseline p (> 0.05). However, there was a significant statistical difference regarding the clinical parameters at baseline of both group II and group III as compared to group I (p ≤ 0.05). At six weeks after treatment, group III showed greater improvement in the PI, PD, and CAL as opposed to group II (p ≤ 0.05). Regarding PCT values, at baseline, there wasn't a statistically significant difference between group II and group III (p > 0.05). However, there was a significant statistical difference between group II, group III, and group I (p ≤ 0.05). At six weeks after treatment, there was a statistically significant decrease in PCT levels of both group II and III (p ≤ 0.05). CONCLUSION: The application of curcumin gel was found to have a significant effect on all clinical indices as opposed to SRP.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND:  Type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) and periodontitis have a bidirectional relationship that is well documented in many reviews and epidemiological studies. Periodontitis has been referred to as the sixth complication of diabetes mellitus. Various studies showed improvement in Interleukin-6 levels as well as metabolic parameters after non-surgical periodontal therapy in chronic periodontitis patients with type 2 DM.  Objective: To evaluate the effect of scaling and root planing (SRP) on salivary levels of IL-6 and assessment of clinical parameters in CP patients with and without T2DM. METHODS: We included 50 CP patients with well-controlled T2DM (Group I), and 50 CP patients without T2DM as controls (Group II) with evident clinical inflammation, ≥ 5mm probing depth (PD) and a relative attachment level (RAL) of ≥ 5mm. Following a brief medical and dental history plaque index (PI), gingival index (GI), gingival bleeding index (BI), PD, and RAL were recorded, and an unstimulated saliva was collected. Following SRP therapy, the clinical parameters and IL-6 levels were measured after seven days, 14 days, and 30 days. Intragroup and intergroup comparisons were carried out using a paired t-test and an independent t-test. The statistical significance was set at P < 0.05. Data were analyzed using computer software, Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) v. 22.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY). RESULTS: Intergroup comparisons of IL-6 levels at different intervals showed a significantly higher reduction in Group II than in Group I (p=0.000). While the mean difference in the GI scores from baseline to 30 days was significantly higher in Group I patients (p=0.000), the difference in the mean PI (p=0.004), mean BI (p=0.000), mean PD (p=0.000) and mean RAL scores (p=0.000) were significantly higher in Group II patients. CONCLUSION: This study indicates that scaling and root planing is effective in glycemic control and also has a role to play in the level of salivary IL-6 in periodontal health and T2DM with chronic periodontitis. Elevated salivary IL-6 levels indicate periodontal inflammation which is further increased in T2DM patients. Hence, elevated IL-6 can be considered a marker of periodontal destruction."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: This randomized controlled trial was aimed to evaluate the combined efficacy of injectable platelet-rich fibrin (i-PRF) and scaling and root planing (SRP) in type 2 diabetes mellitus subjects having periodontitis. METHODS: Twenty-six Stage III, grade C periodontitis subjects (HbA1c > 7) were recruited in this split-mouth study. Following SRP, the test sites received subgingival application of i-PRF, while the control sites received saline. Plaque index, bleeding on probing, modified gingival index, probing pocket depth (PPD) and clinical attachment level (CAL) were measured at baseline, 3 and 6 months. RESULTS: Twenty-three participants completed the course of research. The Friedman test followed by Dunn's post hoc test, revealed significant improvement in all the clinical parameters from baseline to 3 and 6 months in both the study groups (p ≤ 0.05). The mean PPD and CAL decreased from 6.30 ± 1.25 and 7.48 ± 1.75 at baseline to 3.48 ± 1.34 and 4.39 ± 1.67 at 6 months in control sites and from 6.57 ± 1.56 and 7.61 ± 1.69 to 3.39 ± 1.23 and 4.26 ± 1.81 at 6 months in test sites (p ≤ 0.0001). Intergroup analysis found no statistical significant differences in the evaluated parameters across all time intervals (p > 0.05) CONCLUSION: The results indicated that the adjunctive application of i-PRF to SRP provided similar benefits as saline and SRP in diabetes mellitus subjects. KEY POINTS: Question: To find the combined efficacy of injectable platelet-rich fibrin (i-PRF) along with scaling and root planing (SRP) in the management of periodontal pockets of Stage III and Grade C periodontitis patients having Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM). FINDING: All of the treated sites showed satisfactory healing. Both the treatment modalities (i-PRF + SRP and Saline + SRP) were effective in the treatment of periodontal pockets. At 3 and 6 months, there were no significant differences in periodontal parameters between groups. Meaning: The application of i-PRF as an adjunct to SRP provided similar benefits as saline and SRP in improving clinical parameters in subjects with stage III and grade C periodontitis patients having T2DM (HbA1C > 7).",

AIM: To evaluate the clinical efficacy of 940 nm diode laser and propolis gel in adjunct to Scaling and root planing (SRP) in the treatment of CP. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Randomized clinical trial was conducted among 30 CP patients with a probing depth of ≥5 mm was allocated randomly into Group 1 (SRP), Group 2 (SRP + diode laser), and Group 3 (SRP + propolis gel). Plaque index, gingival index, pocket probing depth, and clinical attachment level were assessed at baseline, one and three months. Data analysis was performed using SPSS version 17 for windows, and statistical techniques employed were repeated measures by using One-way ANOVA, Tukey's HSD, independent t-test, and paired t-test. RESULTS: Post-treatment sites among all the three groups showed statistically significant reduction in Periodontal index (PI), Probing pocket depth (PPD), and Clinical attachment level (CAL), whereas gingival inflammation was significantly reduced in groups 2 and 3 from baseline to one and three months. On comparison, at baseline, all clinical parameters were statistically insignificant. At one month, the mean difference of PI, Gingival index (GI) was statistically significant between group 1 and 2 whereas the mean difference of CAL and PPD were statistically significant from group 1 to groups 2 and 3. CONCLUSIONS: Lasers with SRP were greatly effective in reducing gingival inflammation, PPD, and CAL. Propolis gel also offered encouraging and promising clinical results but still needs further long-term studies to establish its precise role in the treatment of CP."

The trial was conducted to determine whether periodontal therapy affected blood sugar regulation as a result of this finding. METHODS: A total of 60 people with type 2 diabetes (diabetes mellitus not caused by insulin deficiency) were split into three groups. Group I (control group) consists of patients who are only taking an oral anti-diabetic medication. Patients on an oral anti-diabetic drug plus scaling and root planing make up group II. Patients on an oral anti-diabetic drug, scaling, root planing, and doxycycline constitute Group III. The patients were re-evaluated for glycated hemoglobin levels and periodontal status using the clinical parameters of gingival index by Loe and Silness and clinical attachment level at baseline, 30th, 60th, and 90th day. RESULTS: Compared with group II, the findings showed a statistically significant decrease in glycated hemoglobin values (p =0.001) and improvements in clinical attachment level (p =0.022, 0.05) and gingival index (p = 0.009.,01) in group III. In the control group (group I), no such finding was made. The average gingival index, however, increased statistically significantly (p = 0.032, 0.05). CONCLUSION: Various studies have been showing the benefits of non-surgical periodontal therapy as a benefit for improving the overall glycemic status of the patient. Non-surgical mechanical periodontal therapy combined with systemic administration of antimicrobials such as doxycycline enhances the metabolic status of type 2 diabetes mellitus patients better than non-surgical mechanical periodontal therapy alone."

Inflammatory circumstances result in higher sCD44 levels. The most typical inflammatory disorder connected to periodontal tissue is called periodontitis. Therefore, the purpose \"of the current study was to compare the levels of sCD44 in patients with chronic periodontitis before and after scaling and root planing. OBJECTIVES: 1) Determining CD44 concentrations in healthy individuals' spit. 2) To quantify CD44 levels in the saliva of individuals with persistent periodontitis. The third objective is to compare the levels of CD44 that can be dissolved in saliva between those with healthy gums and those with active periodontitis. 4) Assessing CD44 levels in saliva after \"scaling and root planing in patients with chronic periodontitis.\" MATERIALS AND METHODS: Half of the study participants were classified as having chronic periodontitis, while the other half had healthy gums. Participants with healthy gums and those with chronic periodontitis had their plaque levels, gingival status, and testing depths measured. All the same, data were calculated in persons with chronic periodontitis one month after they had \"scaling and root planing done. Clinical attachment levels were evaluated before scaling and root planing was performed on patients with chronic periodontitis and again one month afterwards. Patients with chronic periodontitis,\" those whose condition had not improved following scaling and root planing (SRP), and healthy individuals all had spit tests conducted after a month. The concentration of sCD44 in the saliva was determined with a chemically coupled immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: Salivary sCD44 levels were substantially greater in people with chronic periodontitis than in people without the condition. After one month of scaling and root planing in patients with chronic periodontitis, sCD44 levels drastically dropped (p < 0.0001). CONCLUSION: Chronic periodontitis is linked to elevated levels of salivary sCD44. sCD44 can be employed as a possible salivary biomarker for chronic Periodontitis."

The present study aimed to explore differential responses of periodontitis to PG in perimenopausal women who did or did not undergo scaling and root planing (SRP). METHODS: A total of 129 perimenopausal women with mild-to-moderate periodontitis were enrolled and underwent treatment as follows: SRP (n = 35); SRP + PG (n = 34); PG (n = 31); and no treatment (s) (n = 29). Pocket probing depth (PPD), clinical attachment level (CAL), sulcus bleeding index (SBI), and bleeding on probing (BOP) were measured using periodontal probes. Three inflammatory markers, including C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin (IL)-6, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) in gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) were measured using ELISA techniques. RESULTS: PPD, CAL, SBI, BOP, and levels of inflammatory factors in GCF were all significantly decreased in perimenopausal women with periodontitis after SRP. In patients who did not undergo SRP, 6 months of PG treatment significantly elevated PPD, SBI, BOP, and GCF levels of CRP, IL-6, and TNF-α. In contrast, PG exhibited inhibitory effects on periodontal inflammation in patients who underwent SRP, evidenced by significantly decreased BOP and IL-6, and slightly decreased SBI, CRP, and TNF-α. PG-induced changes dissipated 6 months after withdrawal of PG (at 12 months). CONCLUSIONS: Among perimenopausal women with periodontitis, PG enhanced periodontal inflammation in the absence of SRP but inhibited periodontal inflammation in those who underwent SRP.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: The primary aim was to assess the pain during intraseptal anesthesia (ISA) administration, as well as during and after scaling and root planing (SRP). The secondary aims pertained to comparing the pain in different jaw regions and evaluating the factors affecting pain during ISA administration, during and after SRP. MATERIAL AND METHODS: ISA was obtained with three different doses of 4% articaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine (4%Ar + Ep) in 360 patients. The pain levels were measured using the visual analogue scales (VAS) for pain intensity during ISA administration (VASa), during SRP (VASi), and after SRP (VASp). These findings were then correlated with periodontal parameters. Regression analysis was performed for pain during ISA, during and after SRP. RESULTS: Anesthesia administration was painful in 80.8% of cases. VASa negatively correlated with pocket depth (PPD). VASi showed no dose-dependency, except in mandibular premolars. VASi negatively correlated with the clinical attachment level (CAL). VASp positively correlated with PPD and CAL. Positive bleeding on probing reduced the chance of pain during ISA administration. Longer anesthesia duration and wider anesthetic field (orally) increased the prospects of painless SRP. CONCLUSIONS: No dose-dependent differences were found regarding patient discomfort and pain intensity of ISA delivery of 4%Ar + Ep for SRP. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The pain during ISA administration was mild and well tolerated regardless of the anesthetic dose. A lower intensity of pain during SRP can be expected in patients with greater CAL. Post-treatment pain can be anticipated after SRP in the regions with greater PPD and CAL.

Although there are a number of therapeutic options available, mechanical debridement continues to be the gold standard. Scaling and root planing is the gold standard therapy for periodontitis, but this research aims to examine the efficacy of tetracycline fibers and simvastatin gel as local drug delivery methods. We evaluated 60 sites, splitting them into three groups: 20 sites received just scaling and root planing; 20 sites received scaling and root planing plus simvastatin gel; and 20 sites received scaling and root planing plus tetracycline fibers. Clinical indicators such as the gingival index, the modified sulcular bleeding index, and the probing depth were measured at the start of the study, after one week, after one month, after three months, and after six months. After six months, the simvastatin group reduced the gingival index and modified sulcular bleeding index more than the tetracycline group, whereas the tetracycline group reduced probing depth more than the simvastatin group."

Distribution of approaches was compared across various task components in this procedure, practice experience of dental hygienists and patient compliance. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Survey of graduates from and students in a baccalaureate dental hygiene program. RESULTS: Paternalism (tell then do) and informed consent (give choices and reasons and ask for permission) were more common than shared decision-making (discuss alternatives, solicit patient input and arrive at a mutual decision) and disengagement (patient refusing offered service or avoiding further involvement) by a ratio of 4 to 1 for the first 2 compared with the latter 2. This relationship was held across selecting treatment, procedural adjuncts, homecare instructions and financial arrangements. Dental hygienists exhibited a range of personal preferences for engagement approaches. No-show rate, patient disengagement outside the office, was high (20%). CONCLUSION: Dental hygienists reported using 'more controlled' approaches to engaging patients in decisions regarding treatment. Patients may prefer to engage in more shared decisions and choose this approach by staying away from the office. This may underestimate patients' decisions to stay away from treatment, for example by not showing for completion of the treatment or disregarding homecare routines.",

      "abstract": "Background and Objectives: The most common treatment procedure for periodontitis and gingivitis is scaling and root planing, which is perceived as a painful dental treatment. The current study aimed to assess pain perception and analgesics consumption after scaling and root planing (SRP) in patients with stage II and stage III periodontitis. Materials and Methods: Before starting the SRP, all the periodontal parameters, such as probing depth (PD), bleeding on probing (BOP), and clinical attachment level (CAL), were measured. The anxiety level of the patients was also assessed using the modified dental anxiety scale (MDAS) questionnaire. Pain perception of the patients was recorded with the visual analog scale (VAS) after performing the SRP. Patients were asked to mark their pain level on the VAS sheet after two hours, four hours, eight hours, 24 h, and 48 h after the periodontal treatment. The following cut-off points were used for the pain intensity in the VAS: 0 = no pain, 1-4 = mild pain, 4-6 = moderate pain, and 7-10 = severe pain. Patients were advised to take analgesics if the pain was intolerable. Multivariate logistic regression was performed to conduct the association of all dependent variables and the pain perception of patients. A nonparametric Friedman test was conducted to assess pain perception at different times. Results: A total of 52 patients including 32 males and 20 females participated in the current study, with a mean age of 43.10 ± 12.33 years. Multivariate analyses showed that MDAS and analgesic consumption is significantly associated with pain perception. Other clinical variables are not associated with pain perception. The Friedman test exhibited that pain perception is significantly associated (p < 0.05) with time. Conclusions: Analgesic consumption and anxiety level are significantly associated with pain perception after SRP treatment.",

Molecular biological determinations of bacterial markers through the polymerase chain reaction (real-time PCR) method with standard PET tests (species-specific DNA probes at a time) were used for the quantification of three of the most important periodontal pathogens (Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, and Treponema denticola). Both nonsurgical periodontal therapies were proven effective in patients with chronic periodontal disease; however, LANAP was associated with a greater reduction in pocket depth and improved clinical outcomes, associated with a significant decrease in the amount of Porphyromonas gingivalis. The clinical results included a decrease in periodontal pocket depth, bleeding on probing, and dental plaque, with LANAP having better overall outcomes than SRP alone. The use of Nd:YAG lasers in LANAP therapy is a safe and effective procedure that is well accepted by patients."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The purpose of this randomized, controlled split-mouth study was to evaluate a videoscope as a visual adjunct to scaling and root planing when utilized in combination with minimally invasive surgery. METHODS: Twenty-five pairs (89 interproximal surfaces) of periodontally hopeless teeth planned for extraction were scaled and root planed with minimal surgical access using surgical loupes (control) or adjunctive use of a videoscope (test). Teeth were extracted with minimal trauma, stained with methylene blue, and photographed with a digital microscope for analysis. The primary outcome of residual calculus was calculated as a percentage of the total interproximal area of interest. Secondary outcomes included treatment time, as well as residual calculus according to probing depth, tooth location, and treatment date. Data were analyzed using Student's paired t-tests, two-way analyses of variance, and Spearman's correlation tests. RESULTS: Residual calculus area was 2.61% on control and 2.71% on test surfaces with no significant difference between groups. Subgroup analysis showed no difference in residual calculus between groups at moderate or deep sites. Treatment time per surface was significantly longer in the test group compared to the control group. Treatment order, tooth location, and operator experience did not significantly affect the primary outcome. CONCLUSIONS: Though the videoscope provided excellent visual access, it did not improve the efficacy of root planing for flat interproximal surfaces during minimally invasive periodontal surgery. Small amounts of calculus remain after instrumentation even with minimal surgical access and when root surfaces appear visually clean and tactilely smooth.",

Analyses were conducted using the Review Manager 5.2 software, while the quality of randomised controlled trials was assessed with the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool. In total, 19 studies were included in the meta-analysis. Pooled results revealed that the adjuvant use of probiotics in the treatment of patients with periodontal disease was largely associated with good clinical efficacy. Resulting in statistically significant improvements in plaque index (P<0.05), periodontal probing depth (P<0.05), clinical attachment level (P<0.05), gingival index (P<0.05), bleeding on probing (P<0.05), deep probing depth (P<0.05), and levels of subgingival microbes (P<0.05) following probiotic supplementation. In summary, the results of this meta-analysis suggest that the administration of probiotics together with scaling and root planing can somewhat improve CP patient clinical outcomes and reduce levels of periodontal pathogens. However, more comprehensive experiments are needed to standardise probiotics and maximise their adjuvant therapy.",

OBJECTIVE: To assess possible heterogeneity by chlorhexidine use in randomized clinical trials (RCTs) evaluating the effect of periodontal treatment (ie, scaling and root planing [SRP]) vs no treatment on birth outcomes. DATA SOURCES: Cochrane Oral Health's Trials Register, Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth's Trials Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE Ovid, Embase Ovid, LILACS BIREME Virtual Health Library (Latin American and Caribbean Health Science Information database), US National Institutes of Health Ongoing Trials Register (ClinicalTrials.gov), and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform were searched through March 2022. STUDY SELECTION: RCTs were included if they were conducted among pregnant individuals with periodontitis, used interventions consisting of SRP vs no periodontal treatment, and assessed birth outcomes. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Data were abstracted with consensus of 2 reviewers using Rayyan and assessed for bias with the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2 tool before random effects subgroup meta-analyses. Analyses were conducted following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses reporting guideline. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Outcomes of interest were preterm birth (ie, <37 weeks' gestation) and low birth weight (ie, <2500 g). RESULTS: There were 12 studies with a total of 5735 participants evaluating preterm birth. Control group participants did not receive any treatment or use chlorhexidine during pregnancy. All intervention group participants received SRP; in 5 of these studies (with 2570 participants), pregnant participants in the treatment group either received chlorhexidine mouthwash or advice to use it, but participants in the remaining 7 studies (with 3183 participants) did not. There were 8 studies with a total of 3510 participants evaluating low birth weight, including 3 studies with SRP plus chlorhexidine (with 594 participants) and 6 studies with SRP only (with 2916 participants). The SRP plus chlorhexidine groups had lower risk of preterm birth (relative risk [RR], 0.56; 95% CI, 0.34-0.93) and low birth weight (RR, 0.47; 95% CI, 0.32-0.68) but not the SRP-only groups (preterm birth: RR, 1.03; 95% CI, 0.82-1.29; low birth weight: RR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.62-1.08). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: These findings suggest that treating maternal periodontitis with chlorhexidine mouthwash plus SRP was associated with reduced risk of preterm and low birth weight. Well-conducted RCTs are needed to test this hypothesis.",

Its progressive form can be identified by the loss and destruction of the periodontal ligament and the alveolar bone, respectively. Periodontal disease, one of the most prevalent oral cavity diseases, is responsible for tooth loss. Scaling and root planing (SCRP) is a standard, non-invasive periodontal therapy for treating patients with periodontitis. However, there have also been connections to disputed results. According to reports, SCRP alone is ineffective in removing pathogenic microorganisms and their by-products from periodontal pockets. In light of this, our current study aims to determine if using manual or ultrasonic instruments for SCRP in patients with a clinical diagnosis of chronic periodontitis is preferable. This systematic evaluation compares the effectiveness of manual and ultrasonic devices for SCRP, a line of therapy for individuals with a clinical diagnosis of chronic periodontitis. The databases searched were Prospero, PubMed, MEDLINE, CENTRAL, ClinicalTrials.gov, and Cochrane Library, which exclusively included English-language papers. The articles were also manually searched for any information missed during the search process."

Then, the effects of non-surgical periodontal therapy on levels of salivary arginase and uric acid were also investigated. METHODS: A total of 60 subjects were divided into three groups based on periodontal health: group I comprised 20 healthy individuals; group II comprised 20 subjects who had generalized gingivitis; group III comprised 20 subjects who had generalized periodontitis. On day 0, the clinical examination of periodontal status was recorded, following which saliva samples were collected. Group II and group III subjects underwent non-surgical periodontal therapy. These patients were recalled on day 30 to collect saliva samples. The periodontal parameters were reassessed on day 90, and saliva samples were collected for analysis of salivary arginase and uric acid levels. RESULTS: Group II and group III showed improvement in clinical parameters following non-surgical periodontal therapy on the 90th day. The MGI score, PPD, and CAL showed improvement. On day 0, at baseline, salivary arginase levels in group III and group II were higher than those in healthy subjects, whereas on day 0, salivary uric acid levels in group III and group II were lower than those in healthy subjects. Both on day 0 and day 90, the salivary arginase level showed a positive correlation with the periodontal parameters, whereas the salivary uric acid level was positively correlated with the periodontal parameters on day 90. CONCLUSION: the level of salivary arginase was a pro-inflammatory marker and a raised level of salivary uric acid was an anti-inflammatory marker following periodontal therapy, suggesting their pivotal role in assessing periodontal status and evaluation of treatment outcome."

The clinical parameters plaque, gingival and bleeding indices, Pocket Probing Depth (PPD), and clinical attachment level (CAL) were evaluated at baseline, 1 and 3 months. Microbiological parameters were evaluated at baseline and 1 month. RESULTS: The results showed reduction in PPD and gain in CAL in both smokers and nonsmokers at the end of 3rd month. The improvements in the test sites were statistically significant when compared with that of control sites. The microbiological analysis showed a significant reduction in Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and Porphyromonas gingivalis at the test sites when compared to the controls in both the groups. CONCLUSION: The findings in both groups suggest that the use of locally delivered 0.8% HA gel may be valuable as an adjunct to SRP in the treatment of chronic periodontitis."

The articles are reviewed with a focus on the finding of inadequate calculus removal at the decision points and how that finding impacts treatment outcomes. METHODS: A narrative review of the literature discussing the influence of calculus on inflammation was performed and the effects of inadequate removal of calculus during periodontal therapy were analyzed in light of the 2018 classification of periodontal disease, the decision points of periodontal therapy, and the guidelines of periodontal therapy. RESULTS: The published literature supports that calculus is a major risk factor for periodontal inflammation. Recent studies indicate that the pathologic risk of calculus goes beyond the retention of biofilm and may represent a different pathophysiologic pathway for periodontal disease separate from the direct action of biofilm. The inadequate removal of calculus is a factor in the failure of periodontal therapy. CONCLUSIONS: The inadequate removal of calculus plays an important role in the frequent failure of non-surgical periodontal therapy to eliminate inflammation."

      "abstract": "AIM: To assess the effects of scaling and root planing (SRP) on the dynamics of gene expression by the host and the microbiome in subgingival plaque samples. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fourteen periodontitis patients were closely monitored in the absence of periodontal treatment for 12 months. During this period, comprehensive periodontal examination and subgingival biofilm sample collection were performed bi-monthly. After 12 months, clinical attachment level (CAL) data were compiled and analysed using linear mixed models (LMM) fitted to longitudinal CAL measurements for each tooth site. LMM classified the sites as stable (S), progressing (P), or fluctuating (F). After the 12-month visit, subjects received SRP, and at 15 months they received comprehensive examination and supportive periodontal therapy. Those procedures were repeated at the 18-month visit, when patients were also sampled. Each patient contributed with one S, one P, and one F site collected at the 12- and 18-month visits. Samples were analysed using Dual RNA-Sequencing to capture host and bacterial transcriptomes simultaneously. RESULTS: Microbiome and host response behaviour were specific to the site's progression classification (i.e., S, P, or F). Microbial profiles of pre- and post-treatment samples exhibited specific microbiome changes, with progressing sites showing the most significant changes. Among them, Porphyromonas gingivalis was reduced after treatment, while Fusobacterium nucleatum showed an increase in proportion. Transcriptome analysis of the host response showed that interleukin (IL)-17, TNF signalling pathways, and neutrophil extracellular trap formation were the primary immune response activities impacted by periodontal treatment. CONCLUSIONS: SRP resulted in a significant \"rewiring\" of host and microbial activities in the progressing sites, while restructuring of the microbiome was minor in stable and fluctuating sites.",

However, the association of FM-SRP and AZM with periodontitis and HbA1c in patients with diabetes is largely unknown. This study investigated periodontitis and HbA1c in patients with diabetes after receiving FM-SRP and AZM to evaluate which clinical parameters most reflect the diabetic condition. Fifty-one periodontal patients with diabetes mellitus were included in this study. In total, 25 patients were assigned to the FM-SRP group in which patients were treated with FM-SRP in combination with AZM, and 26 patients were assigned to the control group in which only supragingival calculus removal was performed along with the provision of oral hygiene instructions. We evaluated periodontal parameters (probing pocket depth, periodontal inflamed surface area (PISA), bleeding on probing), and periodontal bacteria and biochemical parameters (HbA1c, high-sensitive C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1)) at baseline (BL) and 1, 3, 6, and 9 months after treatment. Compared with BL values, the FM-SRP group showed improved clinical parameters, reduced periodontal pathogens, and significantly lower HbA1c. Inflammatory cytokines (hs-CRP, TNF-α, IL-6) were significantly reduced one month after treatment and remained low thereafter. MCP-1 did not change significantly during the experimental period. PISA showed a strong correlation with HbA1c, hs-CRP, and TNF-α. FM-SRP, in combination with AZM, produced clinical, microbiological, and HbA1c improvements in periodontal patients with previously diagnosed diabetes mellitus. Additionally, PISA was shown to be a useful index for assessing the diabetic status of patients with periodontal disease."

This study compared the effect of SRP without and with adjuvant aPDT on periodontal status and WS leptin and adiponectin levels (LAL) in obese patients with periodontitis. METHODS: Groups 1 and 2 entailed obese patients without and with periodontitis. Groups 3 and 4 had normal weight individuals without and with periodontitis. Therapeutically, individuals with periodontitis were categorized into test- (SRP+aPDT) and control- (SRP alone) subgroups. All patients without periodontitis underwent routine dental prophylaxis. Clinical attachment loss (AL), gingival and plaque index (GI and PI), probing depth (PD), missing teeth (MT) and WS LAL were measured at baseline and at three months of follow-up. P<5% were graded statistically significant. RESULTS: At baseline, clinicoradiographic variables were significantly higher among patients in test- and control-groups in groups 1 (P<0.01) and 3 (P<0.01) versus 2 and 4. In group 2 and 3, LL were significantly high at baseline compared with follow-up (P<0.01). There was no difference in periodontal parameters and WS adiponectin and LL in the test and control-groups at of follow-up. No correlation existed between salivary LAL and clinical periodontal parameters (PI, GI, PD and clinical AL). No correlation existed between age, gender and BMI and WS LAL. CONCLUSION: In the short-term, SRP with or without aPDT is ineffective in the treatment of periodontitis in obese patients with periodontitis.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: This study was conducted to elucidate the link of site-specific, tooth-related, and patient-associated factors with bleeding on pocket probing (BOPP) and the impact of scaling and root planing over these factors. METHOD AND MATERIALS: This cross-sectional study comprised of 50 untreated periodontitis patients and 50 periodontitis patients who had received scaling and root planing in the last 6 to 12 months and were on supportive periodontal therapy. Multilevel modeling was applied to data, with BOPP being the dichotomous outcome variable. Variables that revealed a significant association with BOPP in multilevel modeling were analyzed further to find the influence of the treatment group (untreated periodontitis and treated periodontitis) on the association between predictor variables and BOPP. RESULTS: Odds ratio (OR) for BOPP in untreated periodontitis versus treated periodontitis was 1.493, and in molars versus anterior teeth this was 1.439. Untreated periodontitis had an OR of 3.500 compared to treated periodontitis, in anterior teeth with Plaque Index 0. This was 2.795 and 7.734 in treated periodontitis and 5.106 and 12.762 in untreated periodontitis at Plaque Index 1 and 2, respectively. Bleeding on marginal probing had an OR of 6.984 for BOPP. Bleeding on marginal probing negative sites had higher OR in untreated periodontitis irrespective of the probing pocket depth. CONCLUSION: Plaque control is more effective in controlling periodontal inflammation after scaling and root planing. The probability of BOPP in the absence of bleeding on marginal probing is higher in untreated patients. The scope of influence of marginal inflammation on periodontal inflammation in shallow pockets is more in untreated periodontitis as compared to treated periodontitis; however, the trend reverses in deep pockets.",

Patients suffering from chronic periodontitis with a probing pocket depth of ≥5 mm in different quadrants of the oral cavity with radiographic evidence of bone loss were included in the present randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled clinical trial. The subjects were instructed to take one capsule of coenzyme Q10 or a placebo every day for 30 days following SRP. Clinical parameters, i.e., plaque index (PI), gingival index (GI), bleeding on probing (BOP), clinical attachment level (CAL), and probing pocket depth (PPD), were recorded at baseline and four weeks after treatment by two masked and calibrated examiners. The study results were reported as (mean ± standard deviations) and frequencies (percentages). RESULTS: One month after the intervention, PPD, CAL, BOP, and PI indices in the intervention group were significantly lower than those in the control group. One month after the intervention, the GI was similar in both groups. A significant decrease was observed in the GI in both groups after the intervention. CONCLUSION: The results of the present study showed that Q10 orally with scaling and root planing in patients with controlled diabetes with chronic periodontitis might accelerate the treatment process and significantly reduce the pocket depth."

Similarly, there was significant reduction in mean CFU scores for all periodontal pathogens from baseline to 1st and 3rd month follow-ups in both the 2% lemongrass gel and 10% doxycycline gel groups (p < 0.05). Conclusions: It could be concluded that the local delivery of 2% lemongrass gel as an adjunct to scaling and root planing is effective and comparable to 10% doxycycline gel in the treatment of chronic periodontitis."

MATERIALS AND METHOD: In this split-mouth, double-blind, randomized controlled trial, we compared a-PDT versus Er,Cr:YSGG as an adjunct to scaling and root planning (SRP) with SRP alone in Supportive periodontal therapy. A total of 36 subjected were enrolled. In each patient, two quadrants constituted the control group (Group I - Scaling and root planing SRP alone), one site in other quadrant constituted the test group 1 (Group II - SRP followed by application of Er, Cr: YSGG laser), and another site in different quadrant constituted the test group 2 (Group III - SRP followed by antimicrobial Photodynamic therapy using diode laser). The diode laser was operated at a peak power of 70 mW using a 0.6 mm diameter fiber-optic tip. Each site was irradiated with a power density of 28 mW/cm2, for 10 s, thus delivering a total energy of 16.72 J/cm2 per tooth. Whereas, the Er,Cr:YSGG laser's parameters were set to 1 W of power, 10% air, and 15% water. The same procedure was repeated at 1st, 2nd and 3rd week for both the laser therapies. Plaque index (PI), Gingival index (GI), Probing depth (PD,) and Clinical attachment level (CAL) were measured by a single examiner at baseline and 3 months follow up. Inter group analysis of the parameters were done using One-way ANOVA and pairwise comparison was carried out by Tukey's post hoc test. Intra group analysis was performed using Students's paired t test. Statistical significance was set to p < 0.05. RESULTS: There were no significant differences between participants for clinical parameters at baseline. PI, GI PD, and CAL significantly improved at 3 months follow up compared to baseline in both the study groups (Group II - SRP + Er,Cr:YSGG, Group III - SRP + a-PDT) with P < 0.05. Adjunctive use of Er,Cr:YSGG laser with SRP showed better clinical outcomes than a-PDT with SRP. CONCLUSION: Nonsurgical periodontal therapy of chronic periodontitis using Er, Cr: YSGG, and a-PDT as an adjunct to SRP was significantly more effective than SRP alone in reducing PD, CAL, GI, and PI at 3 months follow up. Adjunctive use of Er,Cr:YSGG laser with SRP showed better clinical outcomes than a-PDT with SRP. However, the long-term positive benefits of the laser therapies are yet unknown and more research with longer follow-ups are required.",

In this split-mouth randomized controlled clinical trial, 17 participants with at least one periodontally involved tooth in each quadrant received oral hygiene instruction and full-mouth SRP. At baseline, probing pocket depth (PPD), clinical attachment level (CAL), bleeding on probing (BOP), and full-mouth plaque index (FMPI) were measured, and gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) sampling was performed. Next, one random quadrant in each participant received 940 nm diode laser (1 W, continuous-wave), and another quadrant received 2780 nm Er,Cr:YSGG laser (1.5 W, 30 Hz) irradiation. The GCF levels of interleukin (IL)-10 and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-13 were measured at baseline, and after 2 and 6 months using ELISA. The clinical parameters were also measured. Data were analyzed by repeated measures ANOVA. Significant clinical improvement was noted in all groups (P < 0.05). CAL in the control group was higher at 6 months than 2 months. The increase in IL-10 in erbium group was significantly greater than that in other groups (P < 0.001). The MMP-13 level was significantly lower in laser groups with greater reduction in erbium group (P < 0.001). Application of 940 nm diode and 2780 nm Er,Cr:YSGG lasers as an adjunct to SRP significantly decreased the GCF level of MMP-13, with no significant clinical advantage over SRP monotherapy. Application of 2780 nm Er,Cr:YSGG laser in addition to SRP increased the GCF level of IL-10.Trial registration numbers: IRCT20140318017053N11 and IRCT20140318017053N9.",

This study aimed to compare and correlate salivary and serum PAI-1 and alpha 2-macroglobulin (α2MG) in patients with periodontitis with and without type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and also appraise the consequence of periodontal treatment on these biomarkers. METHODS: Sixty subjects enlisted were split into two groups; Group 1 consisted of 30 systemically healthy subjects with Stage II and III, generalized, Grade B, C periodontitis while Group 2 consisted of 30 patients with periodontitis and well-controlled T2DM (PDM). Salivary and serum PAI-1 and α2MG levels were estimated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and allied with clinical parameters before and 3 months post non-surgical periodontal therapy (NSPT). Data were statistically analyzed using student t-test and Spearman correlation. RESULTS: Analogous improvements in clinical periodontal markers were experienced in both groups after initial periodontal treatment. Estimates of salivary and serum PAI-1 and α2MG were higher among the PDM group compared with periodontitis alone at baseline. Significant diminution in estimates of biomarkers was noted 3 months after NSPT. In the PDM group, there was also an improvement in glycemic control. CONCLUSIONS: NSPT positively impacted both groups. Noteworthy expression of salivary and serum PAI-1 in patients with periodontitis and diabetes insinuates a possible role of the adipokine in periodontal inflammation and glucose level regulation. Salivary PAI-1 could thus be used as a diagnostic biomarker to detect disease activity and to track periodontal therapy response.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The etiological factors of periodontal diseases are the habitation of dysbiotic bacteria, absence of beneficial bacteria, and susceptibility of the host. Irresolute pattern in the periodontal diseases pathogenesis leads to the evolution of novel antimicrobial therapy. OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study is to assess and compare the competency of locally delivered probiotic paste with chlorhexidine gel as a supplement to scaling and root planing (SRP) in chronic periodontitis patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A split-mouth randomized controlled trial was designed on 10 systemically healthy participants having chronic periodontitis at three distinct quadrants with 5-6-mm pocket depth. The sites in each participant were randomly selected for Group A (negative control), Group B (positive control), and Group C (test). In Group A, only SRP, Group B - SRP + chlorhexidine local drug delivery (LDD), Group C - SRP + probiotic LDD were done, respectively. Gingival index (GI) and bleeding index (BI) were determined at baseline, 3rd, 6th, and 9th weeks, whereas probing pocket depth (PPD), Russell's periodontal index, and clinical attachment level were checked at baseline and after 9 weeks. RESULTS: It shows a significant reduction in GI, BI, PPD, and gain of CAL in probiotic LDD group. CONCLUSION: Nowadays, since microbes are rapidly developing resistance to antibiotics, the development of probiotics is a boon for the treatment of periodontal diseases. Diseases of the periodontium are not restricted to the oral cavity alone but also have strong systemic effects. Hence, probiotics give a natural and promising choice of therapy to establish both good oral and systemic health."

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: This study evaluated the efficacy of treating periodontitis using subgingival nano-hydroxyapatite powder with an air abrasion device (NHAPA) combined with scaling and root planing (SRP). METHODS: A total of 28 patients with stage III periodontitis (grade B) were included in this study, although 1 was lost during follow-up and 3 used antibiotics. The patients were divided into a test group and a control group. All patients first received whole-mouth SRP using hand instruments, and a split-mouth approach was used for the second treatment. In the test group, the teeth were treated with NHAPA for 15 seconds at 70% power per pocket. Subgingival plaque samples were obtained from the 2 deepest pockets at the test and control sites before treatment (baseline) and 3 months after treatment. The full-mouth plaque index (PI), gingival index (GI), papillary bleeding index (PBI), bleeding on probing (BOP), probing depth (PD) and clinical attachment level (CAL) were recorded at baseline and at 1- and 3-month post-treatment. Real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to determine the colonisation of Treponema denticola (Td), Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg), and Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans in the subgingival plaque. RESULTS: From baseline to the first month, the test group showed significantly larger changes in BOP and CAL (43.705%±27.495% and 1.160±0.747 mm, respectively) than the control group (36.311%±27.599% and 0.947±0.635 mm, respectively). Periodontal parameters had improved in both groups at 3 months. The reductions of PI, GI, BOP, PD, and CAL in the test group at 3 months were greater and statistically significant. The total bacterial count and Td and Pg species had decreased significantly by the third month in both groups (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Applying NHAPA in addition to SRP improves clinical periodontal parameters more than SRP alone. Subgingival NHAPA may encourage clot adhesion to tooth surfaces by increasing surface wettability."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-four systemically healthy, stage III grade C periodontitis patients were recruited for this clinical trial. In this split-mouth study, the quadrants were randomly allocated to either SRP with combined air polishing (erythritol/chlorhexidine powder) and Nd:YAG laser (2 W, 200 mJ/pulse, 10 Hz) therapy (test group) or SRP alone (control group). A masked examiner recorded clinical parameters such as plaque index (PI), gingival index (GI), bleeding on probing (%) (BOP %), probing depth (PD), and clinical attachment level (CAL) on periodontal charts at baseline, 1 month and 3 months after treatment. RESULTS: The clinical parameters had significantly reduced 1 and 3 months after treatment compared to baseline for both study groups (p < 0.05). Considering PI, GI, and BOP (%) parameters, there were no significant differences between the study groups at any time points (p > 0.05). While PD and CAL reductions were similar in study groups for moderately deep pockets (5 to 6 mm) (p > 0.05), PD and CAL reductions were significantly greater in test group compared to control group for deep pockets (PD ≥ 7 mm) (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The present clinical trial demonstrated that SRP with combined application of air polishing and Nd:YAG laser may be advantageous in sites where mechanical debridement alone cannot access, such as deep pockets in the short term. Long-term, well-designed future studies including clinical, biochemical, and microbiological analyses are needed to determine the effectiveness of this procedure. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: SRP with combined application of air polishing and Nd:YAG laser provided more reductions in probing depth and clinical attachment level parameters in deep pockets compared to SRP alone.",

METHODS: Patients diagnosed with periodontitis were included. Information regarding age and gender was recorded using a questionnaire. All patients underwent full mouth non-surgical SRP and the following parameters were assessed at baseline: (a) marginal bone loss (MBL); (b) probing depth (PD) (c) clinical attachment loss (CAL); and (d) presence of supra-and subgingival bleeding and plaque (GI and PI). Identification of A. actinomycetemcomitans and P. gingivalis was performed using polymerase chain reaction. For aPDT (test-group), methylene-blue (MB) (0.005%) was used as photosensitizer and it was applied over and inside the buccal pockets of teeth. Using a Diode laser at 660 nm and 150 mW, irradiation was performed All clinical parameters except for MBL and microbiological evaluations were re-assessed at 3-months of follow-up. Level of significance was set at P<0.05. RESULTS: At 3-months of follow-up A. actinomycetemcomitans and P. gingivalis were identified in significantly lower number of patients in groups 1 and 2 compared with their respective baseline values. Number of patients in whom A. actinomycetemcomitans and P. gingivalis were identified at 3-months of follow-up were similar in both groups. At baseline, there was no statistically significant difference in PI, GI, PD, CAL and MBL among patients in groups 1 and 2. In groups 1 and 2, scores of PI (P<0.001), GI (P<0.001) and PD (P<0.001) were significantly higher at baseline compared with their respective 3-months' follow-up scores. CONCLUSION: One application of aPDT with non-surgical SRP is ineffective in managing periodontal inflammation and presence of P. gingivalis and A. actinomycetemcomitans in periodontitis patients.",

Plaque index (PI), gingival index (GI), and probing pocket depth (PPD) were assessed at baseline, on the 15th day, and on the 30th day. Microbial analysis for the colony-forming unit (CFU) was done at baseline and on the 30th day. RESULTS: Statistically significant reduction was observed in PI, GI, PPD, and CFU counts from baseline to 30 days in both the groups. On intergroup comparison, the group received irrigation with chlorhexidine showed slightly better results; however, this difference was statistically nonsignificant compared to the group that received irrigation with propolis.

Periodontal therapy has been shown to decrease the levels of calprotectin in body fluids. Hence, the present study was aimed at assessing salivary calprotectin levels in periodontitis associated with diabetes mellitus after low-level laser therapy (LLLT) as an adjunct to scaling and root planing (SRP). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixty-four participants were divided into Groups A (periodontitis) and B (periodontitis associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus [T2DM]) based on probing depth of ≥5 mm, clinical attachment level (CAL) of >2 mm, and history of T2DM. Based on assigned treatments, the groups were subdivided into A1, A2, B1, and B2 where A1 and B1 were subjected to SRP alone and A2 and B2 received LLLT as an adjunct to SRP, respectively. The parameters assessed included probing pocket depth, CAL, bleeding on probing (BOP), plaque index (PI), and salivary calprotectin. All the values were subjected for comparison at baseline and 8 weeks. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS USED: Multiple group comparisons were done using analysis of variance; intragroup comparisons were made using t-test. The level of significance was assessed at P < 0.05 for all tests. RESULTS: All parameters showed a significant difference within the groups from baseline to 8 weeks. Intergroup comparison of PI, BOP, and salivary calprotectin showed a significant difference (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Reduction in calprotectin levels was noticed with LLLT when used as an adjunct to SRP. Calprotectin may be used as a prognostic marker for periodontitis."

METHODS: Forty-two patients with GAgP were randomly assigned into groups as Q-SRP, FM-SRP or FMD with chlorhexidine. Clinical parameters were recorded, and gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) and subgingival plaque samples were collected at baseline, 3 and 6 months after treatment. GCF levels of interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-17 were analysed using ELISA. Quantities of six bacterial species were determined using qPCR. RESULTS: Clinical parameters improved significantly in all groups at 3 and 6 months (p < 0.05). Percentage of sites with probing depth >6 mm was lower in the FMD than Q-SRP group at 3 and 6 months (p < 0.05). FMD showed significantly higher percentage of pocket closure compared with Q-SRP and FM-SRP at both 3 and 6 months after treatment (p < 0.05).

The present study used the new classification of periodontitis and validated questionnaires to assess the relationship among dental fear, SRP pain and periodontal status. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 120 periodontitis patients were enrolled and staging according to the new classification of periodontitis. SRP was performed, and the visual analog scale (VAS) to assess pain was used with every patient after treatment. Questionnaires, including Corah's Dental Anxiety Scale (DAS), Dental Fear Survey (DFS), and short-form Dental Anxiety Inventory (S-DAI) were implemented from the first attendance and subsequent visits after 6 months. The patients were grouped by DAS scores. The statistical analysis was performed using T-test, chi-square, Pearson and Spearman correlative analysis. RESULTS: Compared to pre-SRP treatment, the dental fear level on DFS was decreased in the posttreatment period for all periodontitis stages. There were no statistically significant differences in S-DAI and DAS between pretreatment and posttreatment periods in stage I and II; meanwhile, there were statistically differences in stage III and IV. The correlation among periodontitis stages, VAS and dental fear level was significant. The proportion of high periodontitis stages was increased in high dental fear group. CONCLUSION: SRP can reduce dental fear levels in all periodontitis stages, especially in stage III and IV. Correlations exist among periodontal status, dental fear and SRP pain. High dental fear is associated with poor periodontal status."

METHODS: A total of 40 systemically healthy, patients with Stage III periodontitis were included in this randomized controlled study. Participants were randomly divided into two groups as SRP + diode laser (L) (0.80W power, 940 nm wavelength and 0.80J/s energy level) and only SRP group. Recording of periodontal parameters and collecting GCF samples were performed at baseline, first and 3rd months. Biomarker levels in GCF were measured with ELISA RESULTS: At baseline, no significant difference was detected between groups in terms of both clinical and biochemical parameters. All biochemical parameters (except for IL-10 in control group), presented a statistically significant difference for 3 months study period in both groups. When laser and control groups were compared, significant differences were not observed, except the lower GCF IL-17 levels (P = 0.025), bleeding on probing (P = 0.028), and clinical attachment level (CAL) (P = 0.0002) values in laser group at third, first, and third months, respectively.

      "abstract": "AIMS: Sclerostin is an inhibitor of bone formation, and laser irradiation enhances osteoblast proliferation. The objective of this study was to assess and compare the gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) sclerostin level and clinical parameters of chronic periodontitis patients following the application of diode laser (810 nm) as an adjunct to scaling and root planing (SRP). SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Fifteen systemically healthy chronic periodontitis patients (age 35-55 years) with probing pocket depth ≥5mm were included in this split-mouth study. SRP and pocket irradiation with diode laser were done in the test group and SRP alone in the control group at baseline. Low-level laser therapy application and saline irrigation were done in both the groups, respectively, in the 2nd and 3rd visits. Two microliters of GCF samples was collected from both the groups at baseline before treatment and on the 90th day for the assessment of sclerostin concentration. RESULTS: This study showed a statistically significant reduction of clinical parameters in the test and control groups at the end of 3 months. Both the groups showed a statistically significant reduction of sclerostin levels in GCF after 3 months, in which the test group (125.80 ± 28.21 to 82.80 ± 9.31) showed a highly significant reduction (P = 0.000). CONCLUSIONS: The adjunctive use of laser had shown a beneficial effect in terms of clinical parameters and osteoblast proliferation by the reduction in the levels of sclerostin in GCF. From the observations of this study, it can be concluded that the therapeutic effectiveness of diode laser as an adjunct to SRP is having a beneficial effect and sclerostin can be used as a potent biomarker."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eighteen extracted single-rooted human teeth were used in the study. Briefly, the anatomical crowns were removed; roots were sectioned and preserved in antiseptic solution. The sections were divided into three groups: (i) scaling and root planing (SRP), (ii) SRP followed by diode laser exposure and (iii) untreated control group. All the sections were inoculated with NIH 3T3 mouse fibroblast cell lines and cell attachment was confirmed by scanning electron microscopy analysis and growth was quantitatively assessed by MTT assay after days 1, 3 and 5. RESULTS: On intragroup analysis, there was significant cell proliferation seen on day 1 and day 5. However, no significant differences were observed between the treatment groups at the various time points. CONCLUSION: 970-nm diode laser exposure had a positive effect in enhancing the fibroblast reattachment to root surfaces. However, to ascertain the role of laser treatment in enhancing the rapid cell growth compared to SRP, further quantitative studies with more sample numbers are required."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: A number of studies in patients with periodontitis have compared scaling and root planning (SRP) combined with an adjunctive treatment to SRP alone. Within that literature, an array of studies with overlapping investigators has consistently yielded substantially greater effects of adjunctive treatments than had been previously noted. This report investigates discrepancies between that cluster of research and the most recent American Dental Association (ADA) systematic review. METHODS: This review was preregistered at https://osf.io/4meyd/. A search using the Scopus platform identified 32 articles published from 2010 to 2017 by investigators affiliated with the Government Dental College and Research Institute (GDCRI) in Bangalore, India. The primary outcome used in this meta-analysis was the change in clinical attachment level (CAL) after 6 mo. Effect sizes were estimated using Comprehensive Meta-Analysis software after categorizing agents into groups based on pharmacologic similarity. RESULTS: The search identified 32 studies encompassing 5 sets of adjunctive agents. Across the GDCRI studies, the CAL averaged 1.67 mm (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.43-1.91 mm), substantially exceeding values reported in the ADA review (mean: 0.39 mm, 95% CI: 0.27-0.51 mm). For categories of studies in which comparable subgroup estimates were available, the evaluations yielded overlapping estimates of SRP alone, but CAL estimates were discrepant for both locally delivered antimicrobials (GDCRI studies: mean: 1.45 mm, 95% CI: 0.63-2.27 mm; ADA review: mean: 0.38 mm, 95% CI: 0.16 -0.60 mm) and systemic antibiotics (GDCRI studies: mean: 1.35 mm, 95% CI: 0.97-1.73 mm; ADA review: mean: 0.39 mm, 95% CI: 0.21-0.57 mm). CONCLUSION: In the literature on adjunctive agents supplementing SRP, findings from investigators linked to GDCRI stand out as having significantly more favorable estimated effects. Meanwhile, some agents studied by GDCRI-linked investigators have not been investigated by other researchers. In the absence of a clear explanation for discrepant results, it is recommended that unusually favorable reported effects of adjunctive agents be viewed with caution. KNOWLEDGE TRANSFER STATEMENT: The present meta-analysis observed an unusually large effect size of adjunctive agents to scaling and root planning in studies conducted by the same research group. These results were not consistent with trials on adjunctive agents and previous reports. As this research group has exclusively tested most of the agents, their results must be viewed with caution until other independent groups replicate the studies and reproduce the effect size.",

MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred fifty patients were randomly assigned to three treatment groups: group 1 (SRP), group 2﻿ (SRP+PDT) and group 3 (SRP+AV). Four clinical parameters - plaque index (PI), bleeding on probing (BoP), periodontal (PD) pocket depth and clinical attachment level (CAL) - were evaluated at baseline and 3 and 6 months post treatment. Additionally, the amount of three inflammatory - cytokines IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-α - in gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) was identified using an enzyme-linked immune-sorbent assay (ELISA). RESULT: S﻿tatistically significant improvement was observed for all clinical parameters in group 3 at follow-up in comparison to groups 1 and 2. Individuals treated with adjunct PDT showed statistically significant reduction in moderate (4-5 mm) and deep (≥6 mm) PD pockets at the 3-month follow-up. Group-2 and -3 patients displayed statistically significant reductions in cytokines IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-α at the 3-month follow-up in comparison to group 1 patients. This reduction in cytokines was maintained at the 6-month follow-up. CONCLUSION: Adjunct treatment regimens PDT and AV gel statistically significantly contributed to decreasing inflammation in periodontal tissue. AV /gel showed potential to decrease BoP, whereas PDT can facilitate increasing the clinical attachment level.",

Eight electronic databases were searched up to January 2021. Probing pocket depth (PPD), clinical attachment loss (CAL), bleeding on probing (BOP), plaque index (PI), and gingival index (GI) were assessed at short-term (4-6 weeks), 3-month, and 6-month follow-ups. Based on DL usage mode, studies were divided into three groups: inside, outside pocket, and combined modes. As for application regimen, studies in each group were further subdivided into single- and multiple-session subgroups. Thirty randomized controlled trials with 825 participants were included. For inside mode, single-session DL showed significant improvements for PPD (short-term, and 3-month, p < 0.05), CAL (short-term, and 3-month, p < 0.05), PI (3- and 6-month, p < 0.05), and GI (short-term, 3-month, and 6-month, p < 0.05). For outside mode, multiple-session DL showed notable improvements for most clinical outcomes (p < 0.05). The effect of combined mode was still uncertain. Adjunctive DL had additional clinical benefits in the treatment of periodontitis. One session laser treatment is suggested when DL is applied inside pocket in future clinical practice. Meanwhile, more than one session laser treatment presents better outcomes when DL is used outside pocket. PROSPERO: CRD42020156162.",

Type 2 moderately controlled diabetic patients with HbA1c values within the range of 6%-8% were selected. The parameters recorded were gingival index, plaque index, sulcus bleeding index, probing pocket depth, clinical attachment level, and HbA1c. The recordings were done at baseline and 6 months after SRP procedures. RESULTS: Reductions in all the clinical parameters were observed and were found to be statistically significant (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: SRP resulted in a statistically significant reduction in the clinical parameters and HbA1c. Hence, periodontal treatment should be included in the management of diabetic patients."

Clinical studies have proved the relationship between plaque and periodontal disease. AIM: This study compares the anti-plaque efficacy and anti-inflammatory potential of turmeric gel with 0.2% chlorhexidine gel along with scaling and root planing (SRP). MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred and fifty individuals were selected and divided into three groups for the study. Group A was instructed to use 0.2% chlorhexidine gel, whereas Group B used turmeric gel along with SRP. Participants were assessed for plaque and gingivitis on the 14th and 21st days. Subjective and objective criteria were assessed. The clinical data were recorded and used for statistical analysis to obtain results. RESULTS: The percentage reduction of plaque index (PI) between the chlorhexidine and turmeric gel on 21st day were 74.85 and 65.91 respectively. similarly, the percentage reduction of gingival index (GI) between the chlorhexidine and turmeric gel on 21st day were 58.49 and 62.46 respectively. CONCLUSION: Turmeric gel shows a slightly lower anti-plaque property in comparison to chlorhexidine gel. Their effect on a reduction of gingival inflammation was equal. It was also noted that turmeric gel showed better acceptability and biocompatibility by the participants."

METHODS: In 2013, se-SRP was offered to all available subjects from the original cohort of 480 males initially established in 1970. From a total of 75 attending the previous examination in 2010 (baseline), 27 consented to receive the intervention while 18 declined and served as controls. Clinical data were recorded again in 2014 (follow-up) similarly to the previous surveys (1970 to 2010). RESULTS: Subjects' mean age in 2010 was 62.5 (± 3.6, test) and 61.9 (± 3.8, control) years. At follow-up, both groups presented with elevated tooth loss of 1.2 (from 15.5 ± 9.0, test) and 1.5 (from 17.9 ± 6.6, control) resulting in 1,392 (test) and 1,061 (control) sites available for further analysis. In both groups, clinical attachment level (CAL) loss and probing depths (PD) deteriorated. PD increase of 0.22 mm (± 1.70) in the test group was significantly higher compared with the control group (0.08 mm ± 1.30) (P <0.0001) demonstrating unaffected PDP. Computed estimates of further PDP revealed CAL and PD reductions in subjects aged ≥40 years. Specifically, the latter was positively correlated with tooth loss in subjects aged ≥40 years (P = 0.69, P = 0.0012) and ≥50 years (r = 0.62, P <0.0001). CONCLUSION: se-SRP in previously untreated periodontitis subjects aged ≥50 years may be ineffective in reducing PDP thus demanding advanced preventive measures, treatment in the first half of life, and sustained access to supportive care.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: To investigate the microbial shift after periodontitis being treated by scaling and root planing (SRP) with or without adjunctive antibiotics, and to assess the relationship between oral microbiota and systemic factors. METHODS: A 6-month pilot randomized controlled trial recruited 14 subjects with severe periodontitis, divided into test group and control group to receive full-mouth SRP with or without amoxicillin (500 mg) and metronidazole (200 mg) (three times a day for 7 days). Clinical examination, collection of subgingival plaque and saliva, and blood tests were performed at baseline pre-treatment, 3 months, and 6 months post-treatment. The V3V4 region of 16S DNA was sequenced; taxonomic assignment was based on the Human Oral Microbiome Database. RESULTS: The periodontal condition significantly improved in both groups; the test group showed a greater improvement in plaque index, probing depth, and bleeding index than the control group. The test group demonstrated significantly lower microbial richness and diversity, and less abundant Porphyromonas than the control group at 3 months for both subgingival microbiome and salivary microbiome. However, the microbial differences narrowed within 6 months. The subgingival and salivary microbiota shifted synergistically. Glucose was positively related to subgingival Porphyromonas; mean platelet volume was positively related to subgingival Leptotrichia. CONCLUSIONS: Systemic administration of amoxicillin and metronidazole along with SRP had an advantage over SRP alone in clinical improvement and infection control in both the subgingival region and saliva 3 months post-treatment. Microbial advantage nearly disappeared at 6 months; however, the clinical advantage lasted longer. The use of antibiotics also has potential benefits for systemic inflammation and glucose.",

      "abstract": "The human oral microbial community has been considered a reservoir of antibiotic resistance. Currently, the effects of periodontitis and the scaling and root planing (SRP) treatment on the performance of antibiotic-resistant genes (ARGs) and metal-resistant genes (MRGs) in the dental plaque microbiota are not well characterized. To explore this issue, we selected 48 healthy-state (HS), 40 periodontitis-state (PS; before treatment), and 24 resolved-state (RS; after SRP treatment) metagenomic data of dental plaque samples from the Sequence Read Archive (SRA) database. NetShift analysis identified Fretibacterium fastidiosum, Tannerella forsythia, and Campylobacter rectus as key drivers during dental plaque microbiota alteration in the progression of periodontitis. Periodontitis and SRP treatment resulted in an increase in the number of ARGs and MRGs in dental plaque and significantly altered the composition of ARG and MRG profiles. Bacitracin, beta-lactam, macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin (MLS), tetracycline, and multidrug resistance genes were the main classes of ARGs with high relative abundance, whereas multimetal, iron, chromium, and copper resistance genes were the primary types of MRGs in dental plaque microbiota. The cooccurrence of ARGs, MRGs, and mobile genetic elements (MGEs) indicated that a coselection phenomenon exists in the resistomes of dental plaque microbiota. Overall, our data provide new insights into the standing of the distribution of ARGs and MRGs in oral microbiota of periodontitis patients, and it was possible to contribute to the understanding of the complicated correlations among microorganisms, resistomes, and MGEs. IMPORTANCE The emergence and development of resistance to antibiotics in periodontal pathogens have affected the success rate of treatment for periodontitis. The development of new antibacterial strategies is urgently needed to help control and treat periodontal disease, and dental plaque microbiome studies offer a promising new angle of attack. In this study, we investigated the dental plaque microbiota and resistomes in periodontal health and disease states and their changes after SRP therapy. This is the first analysis of the profile of the microbial community and antibiotic and metal resistance genes in dental plaque by the metagenomic approach, to the best of our knowledge. Monitoring the profile of these resistomes has huge potential to provide reference levels for proper antibiotics use and the development of new antimicrobial strategies in periodontitis therapy and thereby improve actual efficacy of the treatment regimens.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: This randomized, controlled clinical trial aimed to compare the differences in periodontal clinical outcomes, duration of the procedure, and patient's experience between conventional scaling and root planing and erbium-doped: yttrium-aluminum-garnet (Er:YAG) in the treatment of generalized moderate to severe chronic periodontitis or generalized Stages II or III, and Grade B periodontitis based on the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), American Academy of Periodontology (AAP), and European Federation of Periodontology (EFP) definitions. METHODS: Thirty subjects were initially recruited. In a split-mouth fashion, right and left sides were randomly allocated into two treatment arms: conventional scaling and root planing (C-SRP) versus laser-assisted scaling and root planing (L-SRP). A blinded examiner recorded clinical measurements at baseline and 3 months. Duration of the procedure was also recorded for each visit, and the patient's experience was assessed with a questionnaire at baseline, 1, and 3 months. RESULTS: The final sample consisted of 26 subjects. Both treatments resulted in overall improvement, but no significant differences were found between modalities for clinical attachment gain or probing depth reduction. The duration of the procedure was approximately half for L-SRP, and postoperative sensitivity was greater in C-SRP. CONCLUSIONS: The low-energy protocol with Er:YAG (50 mJ) used for the non-surgical treatment of moderate-severe chronic or Stage II-III, Grade B periodontitis performed in this study population was a treatment modality that yielded similar clinical improvements when compared to conventional scaling and root planing.",

We searched PubMed, EMbase, Cochrane Library, and ClinicalTrials.gov from inception to February 18, 2021 and identified studies with relevant randomized controlled trials (RCTs) using curcumin or chlorhexidine as an adjunct to SRP. Nine RCTs involving 420 patients/sites were included. A meta-analysis with a random-effects model revealed that curcumin and chlorhexidine, as an adjunct to SRP, reduced probing pocket depth (PPD) at similar levels during a 3-, 4-, 6-, and 12-week follow-up. No significant differences were observed in reducing clinical attachment loss (CAL) between curcumin and chlorhexidine as an adjunct to SRP at 4 weeks and 6 weeks. Furthermore, gingival index (GI) and plaque index (PI) were similar using curcumin versus chlorhexidine as an adjunct to SRP at the 4-week-, 6-week-, and 12-week follow-up. Based on the available evidence in RCTs, compared with chlorhexidine as an adjunct to SRP, curcumin has a similar effect on reducing PPD, CAL, GI, and PI. The quality of evidence is low, limited by the number of studies and their limitations. Further studies are needed to firmly establish the clinical efficacy of curcumin.",

METHOD AND MATERIALS: The study was conducted in 15 patients suffering from ﻿stage II to ﻿III with grade B to C periodontitis with bilateral periodontal pockets (≥ 5 mm) on a minimum of two teeth without degree II or III of furcation involvement or tooth mobility. The evaluated clinical parameters were: Plaque Index (PI), bleeding on probing (BOP), probing pocket depth (PPD), clinical attachment level (CAL), and gingival recession at baseline and after 3 months. After full-mouth supra- and subgingival SRP, the sites were randomly divided into test sites receiving the subgingival application of i-PRF and controls treated with saline. The Wilcoxon test and Mann-Whitney U test were used for intra- and inter-group comparisons, respectively. RESULTS: In total, 726 sites were treated (388 test group and 338 control group) with no uneventful healing effects. Statistically significant decreases in PI (P = .001), BOP (P = .001 for both groups), PPD (P = .001 and P = .000 for test and control groups, respectively), CAL (P = .015 and P = .001 for test and control group﻿s, respectively) between pretreatment and 3 months posttreatment were noted in both test and control groups. For inter-group comparisons, there was no statistically significant difference in all clinical indices (P > .05). CONCLUSION: In this study, both groups were clinically effective as nonsurgical periodontal treatments, without any clinical benefits of using i-PRF.",

It has been recently acknowledged as an anti-inflammatory marker for periodontal disease. This study aimed to compare and correlate salivary and serum fetuin-A levels in health and patients with stages II-III periodontitis along with evaluating the effect of non-surgical periodontal therapy (NSPT) on the same. METHODS: Group 1 comprised of 30 healthy subjects. Group 2 embodied 30 patients with stages II-III periodontitis. Clinical periodontal parameters were recorded. Saliva and serum samples were assembled. Periodontitis patients received non-surgical periodontal treatment. They were recalled after 6 months, and collection of samples and recording of clinical parameters were reiterated. Fetuin-A levels were analyzed using ELISA. RESULTS: Salivary and serum fetuin-A levels were significantly lower in periodontitis patients when compared with the healthy subjects (P < 0.001) at baseline. Their concentrations significantly upregulated 6 months after active periodontal therapy (P < 0.001). Salivary fetuin-A levels revealed a significant positive correlation with their serum levels in Group 1 at baseline (P < 0.001). They also displayed a positive correlation in Group 2 at baseline and 6 months post periodontal therapy, nevertheless failed to establish a statistically significant association. CONCLUSION(S): Our study concluded that salivary and serum fetuin-A levels diminished with increasing severity of periodontal inflammation, and NSPT remarkably improved their levels. They also displayed a significant positive correlation in health, and a non-significant, yet positive correlation in patients with periodontitis.",

However, the evidence to maintain this improvement beyond four months is insufficient. Hence, this trial was conducted to assess clinical efficacy of NSPT on glycemic control in T2DM patients. METHODS: This three-arm randomized controlled trial recruited 150 known T2DM participants (35-65 years), suffering from moderate to severe periodontitis, having HbA1c level ≥ 6.5% at baseline. Participants were followed up at 3 and 6 months. Intervention for test group-1 included scaling and root planing (SRP) with metronidazole (MET) and oral hygiene instructions (OHI). Test group-2 was intervened with SRP + OHI and control group with OHI only. Stata v. 14 was used to observe inter and intragroup mean changes in glycemic [glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), fasting blood glucose (FBG)] and periodontal variables [bleeding on probing (BOP), periodontal pocket depth (PPD), clinical attachment loss (CAL)] using ANOVA and RMANOVA. Proportion of change in outcome variable (HbA1c) was assessed between treatment groups using chi-square test. Change was considered significant at p-value ≤ 0.05. RESULTS: A significant reduction was observed in BOP, PPD, CAL, HbA1c and FBG over time [p < 0.05]. Significant reductions were observed in same variables in both test groups in comparison to control arm [p < 0.05]. No change between the two test groups was observed [p > 0.05]. CONCLUSION: Scaling and root planing improves glycemic control of T2DM patients independently of the use of MET. Therefore, SRP after every 6 months may be suggested and included as a part of overall diabetes management for patients suffering from T2DM.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixty patients in the age group of 20-60 years were recruited employing inclusion and exclusion criteria. Study population was randomly divided into two groups. Group A-test group was instructed to use twice daily the experimental curcumin gel after initial SRP. Group B-control group received only SRP. Parameters recorded were plaque index (PI), gingival index (GI) and sulcus bleeding index (SBI) on day 0 (baseline), days 7, 14, and 21 along with subjective assessment of any reported untoward side effect. Data was analyzed statistically. RESULTS: The PI, GI and SBI decreased in both the test group and control group from day 0 to day 21 consecutively. Intergroup comparison shows that all the parameters were statistically significant in Group A (P < 0.001) as compared to Group B. CONCLUSION: Curcumin gel has significant antiplaque and anti-inflammatory effect in the treatment of gingivitis and can be effectively employed as an adjunct to SRP."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: In a double-blind randomized parallel-arm placebo-controlled trial, 40 stage III/IV periodontitis patients received steps 1 and 2 of periodontal treatment in two sessions within 7 days. Patients then received systemic antibiotic therapy (n = 20; AZI 500 mg/day, 3 days) or placebo (n = 20). Additional instrumentation of residual diseased sites (DS) - sites with PD ≥ 5 mm and BOP - was performed at the 3-, 6- and 9-month follow-ups. The primary outcome variable was the number of DS at the 12-month re-evaluation. Using a multivariate multilevel logistic regression model, the effects of gender, age, antibiotic therapy, presence of Porphyromonas gingivalis or Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, smoking, tooth being a molar and interdental location were evaluated. RESULTS: The number of DS after 12 months was similar in the test (median (Me) = 4, interquartile range (IQR) = 0-6) and control (Me = 3, IQR = 1-6.5) groups. Both groups showed substantial but equivalent improvements in periodontal parameters, with no intergroup differences at initially shallow or deep sites. The logistic regression showed a lower odds ratio (OR) for the healing of DS on molars (OR = 0.29; p < 0.001) and in smokers (OR = 0.36; p = 0.048). CONCLUSION: Stage III/IV periodontitis patients showed significant but comparable improvements in periodontal parameters and the number of residual DS at the 12-month revaluation regardless of treatment type. This may have been the result of the additional instrumentation received by patients at residual DS in both treatment groups. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Treatment with AZI + SRP provided no additional benefits after 12 months in terms of periodontal parameters or the number of persisting sites with PD ≥ 5 mm + BOP as compared to SRP plus placebo.

METHOD AND MATERIALS: Seventeen patients were included. A split-mouth design randomly assigned one side as the test side (SRP + PVP-I) and the other side as the control side (SRP + NaCl). After full-mouth SRP, the control side received subgingival irrigation with 10 mL 0.9% NaCl solution. The test side received 10 mL of PVP-I 10%. Plaque Index (PI), bleeding on probing (BOP), probing pocket depth (PPD), and clinical attachment level (CAL) parameters were assessed at baseline and after 3 and 6 months. During recall visits (3 and 6 months), residual deep periodontal pockets of ≥ 6 mm were cleaned with the same protocol and randomization. RESULTS: PI, BOP, PPD, and CAL were improved in both sides after 6 months. No significant differences were seen between control and test sides for the all clinical parameters after 6 months. CONCLUSION: Multiple subgingival irrigations of 10% PVP-I or 0/9% NaCl combined to one-stage full mouth SRP in patients with chronic periodontitis showed a reduction of all clinical parameters until 6 months.

This commentary will address the importance of subgingival calculus in the progression and treatment of periodontitis and addresses factors that make the execution of a \"definitive\" SRP a critical part of therapy. METHODS: A search for articles, using keywords relevant to the subject , (e.g., periodontitis, dental scaling, root planing, dental calculus, biofilm, inflammation) was conducted using PubMed, Ovid Medline, Cochrane Reviews and the ADA Center for Evidence Based Dentistry data bases. Additionally, references cited in relevant articles were also considered. RESULTS: Surfaces of subgingival calculus are covered with a biofilm of metabolically active bacteria. Periodontal inflammation is clearly related to the presence of calculus and biofilm. The primary goal of SRP is removal of subgingival calculus and biofilm deposits to create a biologically compatible root surface and reduce the inflammatory burden. Current evidence suggests that inflammation associated with periodontal infections affects both the immediate oral environment and the patient's systemic health. CONCLUSION: SRP is still critical to the treatment of periodontitis. SRP involving deep probing depths (≥ 5 mm) and root surfaces with anatomical and surface irregularities, regardless of the type of instrumentation, requires time, exceptional skill and perseverance, and patient compliance with periodontal maintenance. Sites with persistent nonresponding probing depths and signs of inflammation following a definitive SRP, should be considered for surgical intervention.",

AIM: This study aims to investigate effect of extracts from pomegranate in a chip and gel form on periodontitis following scaling and root planing in adult periodontitis patients. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: An in vivo prospective study. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty patients of adult periodontitis with initial pocket depth ≥4 mm were enrolled into the research and divided randomly into three groups, (10 in every group). After baseline examination, scaling root planing of tooth was achieved. Then subgingival application of medicated chips in Group 1, gel in Group 2, and placebo in Group 3 was done. Plaque index, gingival index, probing pocket depth, and relative attachment ranges were recorded at baseline, 21 days and 45 days. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS USED: Analysis of variance test. RESULTS: The study confirmed significant improvements of plaque index ratings in Group 1 at day 21. It showed significant improvements of gingival index scores, probing pocket depth, and clinical attachment at day 21 and 45. Gingival index rankings and probing pocket depth were extensively elevated altogether in three groups at day 21 and 45. Relative attachment degree was extensively raised in Group 1 and Group 2 at day 21 and day 45 and in Group 3 at day 45. The relative attachment degrees confirmed significance at day 21 between Group 1 and Group 2, and Group 1 and Group 3.
