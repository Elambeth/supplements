      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Chemotherapy treatments for breast cancer often entail side effects and drug resistance. Arcangelisia flava root extract (AFRE) shows potential as an anti-cancer agent, but understanding its compounds and mechanisms against breast cancer remains limited. This study aims to identify potential compounds in AFRE and shed light on its actions against breast cancer. METHODS: Compounds in AFRE were identified via LC-MS/MS. ADMET software evaluated absorption and bioavailability. Molecular anti-cancer mechanisms were predicted using network pharmacology with tools like Cytoscape, GeneCards, Disgenet, STRING, GO, KEGG pathways, and SRplot. Interaction between oxo berberine and key breast cancer receptors was analyzed through molecular docking with PyRx Autodock Vina and Biovia Discovery Studio. Cytotoxicity was assessed using the MTT method on T47D cells, and flow cytometry evaluated the potential to inhibit the cell cycle and induce apoptosis. RESULT: A total of 16 active compounds were identified through LC-MS/MS, with oxo berberine being the most abundant at 41.43%. Importantly, it exhibited anti-cancer properties by interacting with 84 genes and affecting 13 signaling pathways related to breast cancer. We found that oxo berberine had a stronger negative binding affinity with PI3KCA, TP53, BCL2, CDK1, EGFR, and MAPK14 than the native ligand, which was supported by molecular docking results. In vitro validation supported these results even more, showing that AFRE treatment caused more T47D cells to die (36.6%) than the control and doxorubicin, as well as more cells to gather in the G1 phase. CONCLUSION: In summary, this evidence highlights the potent anti-cancer effects of oxo berberine in AFRE against breast cancer.",

      "abstract": "Infection with influenza A virus (IAV) may trigger excessive inflammatory responses, leading to severe viral pneumonia and accelerating disease progression. Therefore, controlling these excessive inflammatory responses is crucial for the prevention and treatment of pneumonia caused by IAV. Berberine (BBR), an isoquinoline alkaloid extracted from traditional Chinese medicine, possesses extensive pharmacological activities. However, its immunoregulatory effects and molecular mechanisms in the context of IAV infection require further investigation. This study explored the impact of BBR on macrophage pyroptosis and inflammatory responses induced by IAV infection. Our findings revealed that BBR effectively inhibits the release of IL-1β and TNF-α induced by IAV infection and suppresses gasdermin D (GSDMD)-mediated pyroptosis in a dose-dependent manner. Further research indicates that BBR alleviates macrophage pyroptosis and inflammatory responses in IAV-infected cells by reducing the release of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS), inhibiting mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS) expression and blocking the activation of the NOD-like receptor family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome. Experiments using siRNA to knockdown MAVS further confirmed the pivotal role of MAVS in BBR's inhibition of IAV-induced macrophage pyroptosis. This study provides a scientific basis for the application of BBR as an anti-inflammatory drug in the treatment of inflammatory diseases caused by IAV infection and directs future research endeavors.",

      "abstract": "Background/Objectives: Berberine is a naturally occurring compound found in several plants and has been traditionally used for its various health benefits. However, its poor bioavailability limits its therapeutic potential. Berberine LipoMicel® is a novel micellar formulation of berberine, microencapsulated within an emulsified matrix, designed to enhance bioavailability and bioactivity. This study aims to evaluate its safety, ensuring that improved bioavailability does not introduce new safety concerns. Methods: To assess its safety, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study with a minimum 4-week washout period was conducted in 19 healthy participants over 30 days. The participants received 1000 mg of the treatment daily (i.e., 2 capsules/d), and their capillary blood was analyzed every week to monitor for changes in established safety markers related to liver and kidney function, including aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), total bilirubin (TB), creatinine, fasting glucose (GLU), HbA1c, and various electrolytes. Additionally, potential side effects were recorded through the collection of weekly health questionnaires to determine treatment tolerability. Results: Compared to placebo, no statistically significant changes in any of the safety markers related to liver or kidney health were detected. Within-group analysis revealed a significant reduction of total cholesterol (TC) in females after 30 days of Berberine LipoMicel® treatment. Although not significant, both male and female participants showed a noticeable improvement in the mean AST, potentially signaling a hepatoprotective effect. As for tolerability, no adverse events were reported by any of the participants. Conclusions: Based on these findings, despite higher bioavailability of berberine in a newly formulated delivery system (LipoMicel®), the treatment was found to be safe and well tolerated by human participants, with no significant deviations in blood chemistry that would indicate safety concerns over a period of 30 days."

This study aims to explore the anti-IgE effect of berberine (BBR) and possible mechanisms using human tonsil cells. Tonsil cells were treated with BBR at different doses following stimulation with anti-CD40/IL4 alone or in combination with poly I:C and Pam3CSK4 for 10 or 4 days. IgE and IgG levels were determined by ELISA and cell viability by trypan blue exclusion. Gene expression was analyzed by qRT-PCR and affinity binding assay was performed by chromatin immunoprecipitation assay (ChIP). BBR showed dose-dependent inhibition of IgE production following anti-CD40/IL4 stimulation without affecting cell viability and IgG levels. BBR (10 µg/mL) completely inhibited IgE production by B cells stimulated with anti-CD40/IL4 in combination with vaccine adjuvants-poly I:C and Pam3CSK4 without affecting IgG levels and cell viability. BBR inhibited IgE heavy chain (IgEh), epsilon germline-transcript (εGLT), STAT6, and NFκB1 and enhanced IFN-γ, NFκB1A, and BCL6 gene expression. ChIP assay showed that BBR inhibited STAT6 binding in the IgEh promoter region by enhancing BCL6 binding. This study shows BBR regulates IgE in human tonsil cells by inhibiting STAT6 binding through BCL6 at the IgEh promoter showing its potential for treating IgE-mediated allergies.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Berberine is an isoquinoline alkaloid isolated from Chinese herb coptis chinensis and other berberis plants which can be used to treat a wide range of chronic diseases. However, the current research evidence on the therapeutic effects of berberine has not been summarized. We aimed to synthesize the current evidence on the systematic review (SRs) of berberine for the treatment of diverse conditions. METHODS: A comprehensive search of the Cochrane Library, PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, CNKI, Wanfang, VIP, and SinoMed was performed from the database inception to April 11, 2024. SRs on berberine were included and evaluated. The methodological quality and the reporting quality of each SR were assessed using the AMSTAR-2 tool and PRISMA checklist, respectively. The quality of evidence was appraised based on the GRADE. RESULTS: Fifty-four SRs were included and analyzed. Overall, associations were found between berberine and 70 health outcomes concerned with 9 diseases. Berberine has improved most outcomes of these diseases: 78% (25/32) cardiovascular disease outcomes, 92.59% (25/27) type 2 diabetes mellitus outcomes, 94.74% (18/19) gastrointestinal disorders outcomes, 72.22% (13/18) polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) outcomes, 86.67% (13/15) non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) outcomes, 92.31% (12/13) schizophrenia outcomes, 90.91% (10/11) metabolic syndrome outcomes, 57.14% (4/7) obesity outcomes, and 100.00% (6/6) dyslipidemia outcomes. There was a high overlap of primary studies (CCA > 15%) in the SRs of PCOS, NAFLD, obesity, and schizophrenia. Only one SR was rated as high quality while eight SRs were rated as low quality and forty-five SRs as very low quality according to AMSTAR-2. Regarding the reporting quality, Item 14, 15, 21, and 22 were poorly reported for the included SRs in terms of PRSMA assessment. For GRADE, eight outcomes were rated as high quality evidence, twenty-two outcomes were rated as moderate quality, and 110 outcomes were rated as low quality. CONCLUSION: Current evidence suggests that berberine has beneficial effects on a range of health outcomes for people with chronic diseases. Specifically, berberine significantly improves type 2 diabetes, gastrointestinal disorders, schizophrenia, metabolic syndrome, and dyslipidemia outcomes. However, caution is needed considering the shortcomings in the quality of the relevant system reviews included.",

      "abstract": "Osteoarthritis (OA) is a degenerative joint disease that significantly contributes to functional disability, primarily due to inflammation and cell apoptosis. Berberine (BBR) has demonstrated notable anti-inflammatory and antiapoptotic effects in the treatment of OA. However, despite its promising pharmacological properties, the naturally occurring hydrophobic properties and limited solubility in water restrict the efficacy of BBR. Therefore, excipients are required to modify BBR. Oligomeric proanthocyanidins (OPAs) are dimers, trimers, and tetramers of proanthocyanidins (PAs). The unique interface properties of the OPAs underscore their potential as drug carriers. OPAs as natural carriers enhance medication effectiveness and significantly reduce the incidence of side effects. Herein, we developed natural self-assembled nanoparticles between BBR and the OPAs (BBR-OPAs NPs). By adopting the unification of medicines and excipients, the OPAs-based drug delivery system serves as an effective carrier and exerts therapeutic effects in OA treatment. The formation of BBR-OPAs NPs has been core-shell structure, as confirmed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), 2D NOESY spectroscopy, and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. The BBR-OPAs NPs exhibited good long-acting release capability due to their strong noncovalent interactions, making them competitive candidates for treating OA. Microcomputed tomography (micro-CT) scanning and histological evaluation further confirmed the efficacy of BBR-OPAs NPs in treating OA. In vivo assessments demonstrated that BBR-OPAs NPs inhibited inflammation and apoptosis, thereby preventing the progression of OA. Furthermore, treatment with BBR-OPAs NPs can inhibit synovial inflammation and protect chondrocytes. OPAs show broad prospects as drug delivery carriers and exhibit great potential in the treatment of OA."

In this study, we investigated the effects of sub-effective doses of these derivatives in double and triple combination forms on PAH in rats. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty nine rats were divided into seven groups (n=7): 1) control, 2) monocrotaline (MCT), 3) MCT+vehicle (veh), 4) MCT+BP, 5) MCT+PQ, 6) MCT+BQ, and 7) MCT+BPQ. After three weeks of PAH induction with MCT (60 mg/kg), either vehicle (ethanol 5% in saline) or one of the above combinations (dose of 20 mg/kg for B, and doses of 20 and 10 mg/ kg for P and Q in vehicle) was administered for three weeks. Right ventricular (RV) pressure, contractility indices, lung pathology, miR-204 expression, oxidative stress markers, inflammation and apoptosis were assayed. RESULTS: MCT increased RV systolic pressure and hypertrophy, and lung arteriole wall thickness, fibrosis and leukocyte infiltration in the MCT group compared to the CTL group. All treatments improved these effects significantly. Furthermore, MCT reduced antioxidant factors, Bax, P21 and miR-204 expression and increased Tumor Necrosis Factor alpha (TNF-α), Interleukin 6 (IL-6) and Bcl-2. All of these effects were recovered by combination treatments. CONCLUSION: The results showed that combination therapy with sub-effective/ineffective doses of these compounds had ameliorative effects against PAH."

      "abstract": "Extensive peritoneal metastasis and malignant ascites continue to pose substantial challenges in achieving favorable treatment outcomes for ovarian cancer. Berberine (BBR), an active component of numerous traditional Chinese herbs, has demonstrated potent anti - tumor effects across various malignancies, including ovarian cancer. In this study, we comprehensively evaluated the impact of BBR on the growth and metastasis of ovarian cancer both in vitro and in vivo. RNA - sequencing was employed to elucidate the underlying mechanisms. Specifically, we investigated lipid metabolism and mitochondrial function in ovarian cancer cells and mice, comparing BBR - treated and untreated groups. Additionally, CIBERSORT analysis and immunohistochemical (IHC) staining were utilized to confirm BBR's ability to enhance the infiltration of tumor-infiltrating immune cells into adipose tissue and improve the inflammatory tumor microenvironment. Our findings indicate that BBR significantly inhibits the growth and metastasis of ovarian cancer in vitro and in vivo. The effects can be attributed to two key processes. Firstly, BBR suppresses the lipid metabolism by downregulating lipid uptake related receptor CD36, lipid metabolic enzyme and mitochondrial function. Secondly, BBR alleviates the aging of adipose tissue and adipose derived stem cells (ADSCs), thereby decreasing the secretion of senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). These ultimately lead to the increasing the improvement of tumor infiltrating immune cells, such as CD4⁺ helper T cells (CD3⁺CD4⁺) and cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CD3⁺CD8⁺), and inflammation in ovarian cancer tissue. Collectively, these findings suggested a potential therapeutic effect of BBR in the treatment of advanced ovarian cancer, particularly cases complicated by peritoneal metastasis and malignant ascites."

      "abstract": "Wound infections are a primary cause of delayed wound healing, and film dressings have garnered significant attention in wound management. However, the development of biologically sourced and green-synthesized film dressings with rapid antimicrobial functionality remains an urgent technological breakthrough. In this study, we successfully developed gelatin sodium alginate/sea sheath molecularly modified berberine hydrochloride film (GS/CB). The incorporation of sea sheath powder significantly enhances the mechanical properties of the gelatin‑sodium alginate film.The calcium ions (Ca2+) provided by the sea sheath create a cross-linking effect within the sodium alginate-gelatin network, resulting in tensile properties of the GS/CB films that are 2.6 times greater than those of the control films. This enhancement allows the films to meet the requirements for wound applications. In in vitro antimicrobial experiments, the films incorporated with sodium oleate-modified berberine hydrochloride showed good antimicrobial effects, with an inhibition rate of 97.79 % against Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) and 98.57 % against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). In in vivo wound healing experiments, the film effectively eliminated MRSA from the wound, achieving a bacterial clearance rate of 98.5 %. Compared to transparent film dressings, the GS/CB film demonstrated superior wound care efficacy and significantly accelerated wound healing. Furthermore, both in vivo and in vitro tests indicated that the film possesses excellent biocompatibility. Therefore, the GS/CB film holds great potential and application value as a new wound dressing for the treatment of infectious wounds."

      "abstract": "Pulmonary fibrosis (PF) is a progressive and irreversible lung disease. Previous studies have shown that berberine (BBR) ameliorates PF; however, the mechanism of BBR regulating PF remains unclear. mRNA expression of thrombospondin 2 (THBS2) was analyzed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Protein expression level was detected by western blotting assay or immunohistochemistry assay. Cell function was analyzed using cell counting kit-8 assay, 5Ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine assay, transwell invasion assay, wound-healing assay, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, and colorimetric assay. PF mouse model was established using bleomycin (BLM) to analyze the effect of BBR on PF. The results showed that THBS2 expression was upregulated in the lung tissues of BLM-induced PF mice and transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1)-induced HLF cells. BBR ameliorated BLM-induced PF in vivo. TGF-β1 treatment induced HLF cell proliferation, invasion, migration, inflammation response, and oxidative stress, accompanied by increases in collagen I, fibronectin, and α-SMA protein expression; however, these effects were attenuated after THBS2 silencing. In addition, BBR attenuated TGF-β1-induced pro-fibrotic phenotypes of HLF cells and BLM-induced PF through the inactivation of the THBS2/Smad2/3 pathway. Thus, BBR inhibited BLM-induced PF by inactivating the THBS2/Smad2/3 pathway, providing a theoretical basis for PF treatment with BBR.",

In this study, we aimed to explore new berberine derivatives with pro-osteogenic activity and molecular mechanisms. Our results demonstrated that compound 13 is the most effective among the tested compounds. Compound 13 significantly enhanced BMP4-induced alkaline phosphatase (ALP) staining and increased the transcriptional activity of osteogenic markers such as ALP, Runt-related gene 2 (Runx2), and Osterix at both the mRNA and protein levels. Furthermore, we found that the Akt and PKC signaling pathways play crucial roles in compound 13-induced osteogenesis via treatment with specific inhibitors. The molecular docking results supported the potential interaction between compound 13 and these kinases. These findings highlighted the regulatory role of compound 13 in osteoblast differentiation via the Akt and PKC signaling pathways. Overall, our study provides compelling evidence that compound 13 is a promising therapeutic candidate for the treatment of osteoporosis, with the potential for further development and optimization to improve bone health and strength.",

This study explored the role of BBR in chronic atrophic gastritis (CAG). MATERIALS AND METHODS: The 1-methyl-3-nitro-1-nitrosoguanidine and an irregular diet were used to establish the CAG model. Chronic atrophic gastritis rats were administered BBR at different doses via gavage, and teprenone (TEP) served as the positive control drug. We monitored and measured changes in body weight and food intake, pepsin activity, and gastric acid levels in the rats. Hematoxylin and eosin staining was utilized to scan the pathological condition in the gastric mucosal tissue of rats, while enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was utilized to analyze alterations in serum inflammatory factors and hormone levels. Western blot was employed to evaluate protein expression. Additionally, 16S rRNA was conducted to assess changes in the intestinal flora of CAG rats. RESULTS: Berberine increased body weight and food intake, improved gastric atrophy, and enhanced pepsin activity and total acidity of gastric juice in CAG rats. BBR treatment led to decreased levels of inflammation factors and motilin, while gastrin and somatostatin levels were elevated in CAG rats. Additionally, BBR inhibited the NF-κB and MAPK pathway in these rats. Berberine treatment also regulated the composition and abundance of intestinal flora. These microbiome alterations suggest a possible role in modulating gut inflammation associated with CAG. CONCLUSION: Berberine may alleviate CAG injury by reducing inflammation and regulating intestinal flora, which may be closely associated with the NF-κB and MAPK pathways."

Abnormal autophagy is a key factor in the development of AS. The importance of berberine (BBR) in AS has been well established. However, its exact role in regulating autophagy and alleviating atherosclerotic inflammation remains unclear. PURPOSE: This study was aimed at exploring the role and mechanism of BBR in alleviating AS by activating autophagy and alleviating inflammation. STUDY DESIGN: Network pharmacology predicts the potential mechanism of BBR in regulating AS and verifies this mechanism through in vivo and in vitro experiments, thereby providing new thinking for clinical treatment. METHODS: The potential mechanism through which BBR regulates AS was predicted by network pharmacology. Total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and high-density lipoprotein (HDL-C) were measured by administering BBR (100 mg/kg) via the stomach. Hematoxylin and eosin (HE) and oil red O staining were used for histological analysis. Expression levels of the RAGE and p-NF-κB pathways and autophagy-associated proteins were evaluated by immunofluorescence. The ApoE-/- mouse model was established with a high-fat diet (HFD) to verify the effect and mechanism of BBR in vivo. RESULTS: Functional and pathway enrichment analysis demonstrated that BBR significantly modulated the inflammation-related signaling pathways of AS. Additionally, in vivo experiments indicated that BBR reduced aortic lipid deposition and reduced the atherosclerotic plaque area. BBR decreased the expression levels of RAGE, p-NF-κB, TNF-α, and P62 in the aorta, and upregulated the expression levels of IL-10, CD31, VEGF, LC3B, and Beclin1. Similar results were obtained in vitro experiments, further supporting the in vivo findings. Notably, NF-κΒ activator 1 attenuated the effect of BBR. CONCLUSION: In summary, BBR alleviated the disease progression of AS by regulating the expression of RAGE and p-NF-κB and activating autophagy."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Heart failure (HF) with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) accounts for approximately half of cases of HF and is frequently clinically underdiagnosed. Although new therapies continue to emerge, determining optimal treatment strategies persists as a key clinical dilemma. Berberine(BBR), an isoquinoline alkaloid, is known to attenuate HF with reduced ejection fraction. PURPOSE: In this study, we explored the cardiovascular benefits of BBR in diastolic dysfunction associated with HFpEF, both in vitro and in vivo. METHODS: In vivo, adult male mice were fed with chow or a high-fat diet (60 % calories from lard) with L-NAME (0.5 g/L in drinking water) for 15 weeks. During the last 4 weeks, BBR (100 mg/Kg/d and 200 mg/Kg/d) was administered orally. Rat cardiac myoblast H9C2 cells were pretreated with BBR for 2 h, followed by exposure to palmitic acid (PA, 100 μM) for 24 h. RESULTS: Exposure to a high-fat stimulation led to p-AMPK and PGC-1α downregulation, apoptotic cascade activation, elevated mt-ROS production, and disruption of mitochondrial homeostasis both in vivo and in vitro. Notably, BBR intervention elevated the expressions of p-AMPK and PGC-1α, inhibited apoptotic reaction, reduced mt-ROS, ameliorated TFAM/NRF1-mediated mitochondrial biogenesis disorder, alleviated mitochondrial impairment, and improved cardiac function. On the other hand, AMPK knockdown abolished the beneficial impact of BBR. Collectively, our findings underscored the cardioprotective role of BBR in maintaining mitochondrial homeostasis and preventing apoptosis, achieved through the modulation of the AMPK/PGC-1α pathway. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, BBR possesses protective activity against cardiac insufficiency in HFpEF by maintaining mitochondrial homeostasis and inhibiting apoptosis.",

Berberine (BBR) has been widely used clinically to treat diarrhea in China for a long time. Although recent studies have revealed its therapeutic potential in comorbidities of AGA, there are few reports on its regulatory effects on hair growth. PURPOSE: To explore the effects of BBR on hair loss and its mechanism. METHODS: Human dermal papilla cells (hDPCs), normal and miniaturized hair follicles (HFs) were employed to evaluate the impact of BBR on hair growth in vitro. Depilation-induced hair growth mouse model was used to find the optimum concentration of BBR in vivo. Network pharmacology, RNA sequencing, cell transfection and reporter gene assay, immunohistochemistry, and molecular docking verification were used to explore the molecular mechanisms. RESULTS: These models revealed that BBR enhanced the proliferation of hDPCs, increased the length of both normal and miniaturized HFs, and prolonged the anagen phase. In the depilation-induced hair growth mouse model and histological staining, BBR treatment significantly accelerated hair growth, facilitated the transition to the anagen phase, and prolonged its duration. Mechanistic studies confirmed that BBR promoted hair growth through regulating cell cycle, mediated by targeting Axin and activating the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. Importantly, knockdown of Axin2 reduced BBR's ability to enhance hDPCs proliferation. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggested that BBR promotes hair growth by targeting Axin2 and activating Wnt/β-catenin pathway, presenting a promising therapeutic avenue for hair loss treatment.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by amyloid beta (Aβ) deposition, phosphorylated Tau protein aggregation, inflammation, and neuronal damage. Neuronal autophagy plays an important role in ameliorating central nervous system diseases such as AD. As an emerging form of iron-dependent cell death, ferroptosis has attracted great attention in the field of neurodegenerative diseases. Berberine (BBR), a natural alkaloid, has demonstrated excellent in inflammation reduction, inhibition of Aβ production, and neuroprotection, making it a potential candidate for AD treatment. However, the mechanisms of autophagy and ferroptosis in BBR treatment of AD have not been elucidated. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to investigate the potential of BBR in alleviating AD and evaluate its molecular mechanism through a combination of network pharmacology and biological experiments. METHODS: We assessed alterations in Aβ plaques, neurons, neuroinflammation, and autophagy-related markers in the mice brain using immunofluorescence staining. Network pharmacology and molecular docking were used to analyze the potential targets and signaling pathways of BBR in the treatment of AD. Morris Water Maze (MWM) and new object recognition (NOR) experiments were used to test the spatial memory ability of mice. In addition, we validated the relationship between JNK-P38MAPK, autophagy, ferroptosis, and BBR treatment in 5xFAD mice and A β-induced SH-SY5Y cell models. RESULTS: The results of immunofluorescence staining showed that BBR effectively mitigated Aβ plaque deposition, ameliorated neuronal damage and neuroinflammation. The autophagy-related markers Beclin1 and LC3B were upregulated and P62 was downregulated after BBR treatment. The expression levels of ROS and lipid peroxide MDA decreased significantly after BBR treatment. qPCR results showed that the expression levels of ferroptosis-related genes TFR1, ASCL4, DMT1, and IREB2 were decreased, while the expression levels of FTH1 and SLC7A11 increased after BBR treatment. Behavioral experiments showed that BBR treatment enhanced spatial memory impairment in 5xFAD mice. Network pharmacological and in vitro analyses demonstrated that BBR activated autophagy and inhibited ferroptosis by inhibiting the JNK-P38MAPK signaling pathway. Following treatment with an autophagy inhibitor on SH-SY5Y cells, autophagy was markedly suppressed, and ferroptosis was induced. CONCLUSION: In summary, we found that BBR alleviates AD by inhibiting the JNK-P38MAPK pathway to enhance autophagy and inhibit ferroptosis, further reducing Aβ plaque deposition, inhibiting inflammatory response, and improving neuronal damage.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Preventing oral microbiome dysbiosis is crucial for averting the onset and progression of periodontal diseases. Phellodendron bark extract (PBE) and its active component berberine exhibit antibacterial properties against periodontal pathogenic bacteria. Although they inhibit Porphyromonas gingivalis (P. gingivalis)-induced dysbiosis in vitro in multiple species of saliva-derived planktonic cultures, their effects on microcosm biofilm models remain unclear. In this study, we aimed to elucidate the dysbiosis-suppressive effects of PBE and berberine chloride (BC) on biofilm formation. DESIGN: PBE or BC was added during the formation of in vitro microcosm biofilms containing saliva and P. gingivalis, which were anaerobically cultured for one week. Next-generation sequencing was performed to assess microbiota composition, while quantitative real-time PCR was used to measure bacterial concentrations. Additionally, the butyrate concentration in the culture supernatant was assessed as biofilm pathogenicity. RESULTS: PBE and BC treatments reduced the relative abundance of periodontal pathogenic bacteria, including P. gingivalis, and significantly increased the relative abundance of the genus Streptococcus and nitrate-reducing bacteria, including the genera of Neisseria and Haemophilus. Moreover, the treatment groups exhibited significantly decreased butyrate concentrations. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that PBE and BC could suppress dysbiosis triggered by P. gingivalis in microcosm biofilms in vitro by decreasing the relative abundance and amount of periodontal pathogenic bacteria and enhancing those of nitrate-reducing bacteria that have a high relative abundance in orally healthy individuals. In summary, PBE and BC may contribute to the prevention of periodontal disease through their dysbiosis-suppressive and anti-inflammatory effects."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Alopecia is defined by a loss of hair density and is often considered a symptom of multiple illnesses, such as infection and inflammation. OBJECTIVE: The molecular mechanisms underlying the hair-promoting effects include inhibition of 5α-reductase activity, reducing the binding affinity of Dihydrotestosterone (DHT) to androgen receptors, and decreasing/down-regulating TGF-β2 activity, which have a suggestive role in androgenetic alopecia. Finasteride and minoxidil are the approved non-surgical treatment alternatives for hair loss, but they cause side effects in patients. Therefore, bioactive phytoconstituents with multiple targets can be used to find novel, secure, and efficacious hair-promoting medicinal products. METHODS: This study has carried out the in silico evaluation of berberine using various software. To find possible interactions between the 5α-reductase enzyme and Transforming Growth Factor-- beta 2 (TGF-β2), a critical protein involved in the human hair development cycle, computer-aided drug discovery was employed. RESULTS: According to in silico studies, berberine has been found to bind well to the 4K7a and 6M2N binding sites. The drug has been found to adhere to Lipinski's rule of five, and its pharmacokinetic characteristics were noteworthy. Drug-likeness and Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion, and Toxicity (ADMET) properties showed appreciable results. Furthermore, berberine showed docking scores of -8.4 (5α-reductase) and -7.1 (TGF-β2), which were significantly better than minoxidil (-4.8, -3.2). In general, the drug exhibited improved binding interactions, and the possible toxicity investigations provided very little basis for risk prediction. CONCLUSION: The current protocol has offered experimental support for berberine's possible therapeutic use in reducing male pattern baldness. Therefore, it can be a possible target for the therapy of androgenetic alopecia through the regulation of TGF-β2 and 5α-reductase activity.",

Nevertheless, the underlying anti-tumor mechanisms of BBR in NSCLC remain poorly understood. METHODS: NSCLC cells were cultured and treated with various doses (0, 15, 30, and 45 μM) of BBR for 48 h. Cell viability, proliferation, apoptosis, migration, and invasion were detected using 3-(4, 5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2, 5-diphenyl-2-H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT), 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine (EdU), flow cytometry, transwell, and wound healing assays. Cell division cycle-associated protein 5 (CDCA5) and Cyclin A2 (CCNA2) mRNA level and protein level were measured using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and western blot assays. After STRING databases prediction, the possible interaction between CDCA5 and CCNA2 was identified using Co-Immunoprecipitation (IP) assays. The biological role of BBR treatment on NSCLC tumor growth was assessed using the xenograft tumor model in vivo. RESULTS: BBR treatment blocked NSCLC cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and promoted apoptosis. CDCA5 and CCNA2 levels were increased in NSCLC tissues, whereas their expression was decreased in BBR-induced NSCLC cells. CDCA5 or CCNA2 overexpression might attenuate the inhibitory role of BBR on NSCLC cell malignant behaviors. CDCA5 interacted with CCNA2 to regulate its expression in NSCLC cells. BBR administration blocked NSCLC xenograft growth in vivo. CONCLUSION: BBR hindered NSCLC cell malignant progression partly by modulating CDCA5 and CCNA2, providing a promising therapeutic target for NSCLC treatment."

Ginsenoside Rb1 (Rb1) and berberine (BBR), the main bioactive compounds of Panax ginseng and Coptis chinensis, respectively, are known for their hypoglycemic effects. Nevertheless, the synergistic effects and underlying mechanism of Rb1 and BBR on T2DM remain unclear. In this study, we utilized a leptin receptor-deficient (db/db) mouse model to investigate the protective effects of their combination treatment. Our findings demonstrated that the combined use of Rb1 and BBR at a 1:4 ratio had more pronounced effects than the first-line anti-diabetic drug metformin on reducing the weight ratio of white adipose tissue, ameliorating insulin resistance, and improving glucose and lipid metabolism. Using spatial transcriptomics, we revealed that metformin treatment improved gluconeogenesis and lipogenesis only in the periportal zone, while the combination treatment induced improvements throughout the liver lobule, with distinct key targets across different zones, thus underscoring a more comprehensive modulation of hepatic metabolism. This may be the key reason why this combination therapy demonstrated superior protective effects against T2DM. Additionally, the reversed expression of the key callback gene hepcidin (HAMP) and its regulator growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF15) following the combination therapy across all zones, along with validation experiments, further suggested that GDF15/HAMP pathway might be a key mechanism underlying the beneficial effects of Rb1 and BBR against T2DM. This study also indicates a path toward innovative drug cocktails for treating T2DM, offering a holistic approach to regulate the entire liver lobule metabolism.",

      "abstract": "This study is aimed at exploring the therapeutic potential of berberine (BBR) in mitigating metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) and at elucidating its mechanisms of action, with a focus on the modulation of glucose and lipid metabolism via the PI3K/Akt and STING signaling pathways. Male C57BL/6 J mice were fed a high-fat diet (HFD) to induce MASLD and subsequently treated with BBR or metformin. HepG2 cells were cultured in vitro, and palmitic acid (PA) was used to construct the cell model. Comprehensive analyses, including network pharmacology, transcriptome sequencing, and Western blotting, were conducted to identify critical pathways and molecular targets. Biochemical, histological, and molecular assays were performed to evaluate metabolic and inflammatory responses. BBR significantly attenuated HFD-induced hepatic steatosis, inflammation, and glucose intolerance. It effectively reduced lipid accumulation, enhanced insulin sensitivity, and modulated the expression of genes involved in lipid metabolism. Network pharmacology and transcriptome analysis highlighted the involvement of the PI3K/Akt and STING pathways. BBR activated PI3K/Akt signaling while suppressing the STING pathway, thereby reducing lipid accumulation in both in vivo and in vitro models. The inhibition of AKT negated the beneficial effects of BBR, underscoring the pivotal role of PI3K/Akt in regulating STING signaling. BBR ameliorates MASLD by activating the PI3K/Akt pathway and inhibiting the STING pathway, leading to improved glucose and lipid metabolism. These findings position BBR as a promising therapeutic candidate for the treatment of MASLD."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Berberine (BBR) enhances the production of levodopa in gut microbes, which is converted to dopamine in the brain of Parkinson's disease (PD). However, limited research has explored the effects of BBR on non-motor symptoms, such as depression and gastrointestinal (GI) dysfunction in PD. METHODS: 6-hydroxydopamine-induced (6-OHDA) PD rats were utilized in this study, and depression-like behaviors were detected via the sucrose preference test and open field test. KEY RESULTS: The 6-OHDA rats exhibited depression-like behaviors, delayed GI transit, decreased colonic motility, and increased mucosal permeability. BBR gavage effectively improved depression-like behaviors, increased dopamine and 5-HT content in the midbrain and orexin A (OXA) content in the hypothalamus, but decreased corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) content in the hypothalamus of 6-OHDA rats. Moreover, BBR treatment shortened whole GI transit time, enhanced distal colonic motility, and restored colonic mucosal permeability in 6-OHDA rats. Furthermore, expression of neuronal nitric oxide synthase protein, choline acetyltransferase mRNA levels, intensity of glial fibrillary acidic protein-positive enteric glial cells (EGCs), glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor protein, and goblet cell numbers were increased in the distal colon of 6-OHDA rats after BBR treatment. CONCLUSIONS AND INFERENCES: These findings suggested that BBR ameliorated the colonic dysfunction in 6-OHDA rats and modulated changes in enteric neurotransmitters and EGCs. Moreover, BBR regulated monoamines in the midbrain and OXA and CRF in the hypothalamus, which are associated with depression-like behaviors in 6-OHDA rats. This study provides a theoretical and experimental foundation for the potential application of BBR in treating non-motor symptoms of PD."

      "abstract": "Background and Objectives: Hind limb ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury is a serious clinical condition that requires urgent treatment and develops as a result of a sudden decrease in blood flow in the extremity. Antioxidant combinations are frequently used in diseases today. This study aimed to investigate and compare the effectiveness of ellagic acid (EA) and berberine (BER), which are important antioxidants, and the combination on hind limb I/R injury to evaluate their therapeutic power. Materials and Methods: Thirty-five male Sprague Dawley rats were randomly divided into five groups: sham, I/R, EA+I/R, BER+I/R, and EA/BER+I/R. In the I/R procedure, the infrarenal abdominal aorta was clamped and reperfused for 2 h. EA (100 mg/kg, ip) and BER (200 mg/kg, ip) were administered in the 75th minute of ischemia. Oxidative stress markers (MDA, GSH, SOD, and CAT) and TNF-α were measured. Apoptosis (Bax, Bcl-2, and Cleaved caspase-3) and pyroptosis (Nrf2, NLRP3, and Gasdermin D) pathways were evaluated via Western blot. Muscle tissue was examined histopathologically by hematoxylin eosin staining. One-way ANOVA and post hoc LSD tests were applied for statistical analyses (p < 0.05). Results: Bax levels increased in the ischemia group and decreased with EA and BER (p < 0.05). Bcl-2 levels decreased in the ischemia group but increased with EA and BER (p < 0.05). The highest level of the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio was in the I/R group (p < 0.05). Cleaved caspase 3 was higher in the other groups compared to the sham group (p < 0.05). While Nrf2 decreased in the I/R group, NLRP3 and Gasdermin D increased; EA and BER normalized these levels (p < 0.05). In the histopathological analysis, a combination of EA and BER reduced damage (p < 0.05). TNF-α levels were similar between groups (p > 0.05). MDA levels were reduced by EA and BER, but GSH, SOD, and CAT levels were increased (p < 0.05). Conclusions: It was concluded that TNF-α levels depend on the degree and duration of inflammation and that no difference was found in relation to duration in this study. As a result, EA, BER, and their combination could be potential treatment agents on hind limb I/R injury with these positive effects.",

It has been reported to play a crucial role in multiple metabolic diseases and cancers. Programmed cell death-1 (PD-L1) is known as the immune checkpoint; immunotherapy targeting PD1/PD-L1 axis can effectively block its pro-tumor activity. However, the effect of the combined use of BBR and anti-PD-L1 on hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has not been reported. METHODS: Hep-3B and HCCLM3 cells were chosen as the experimental objects. To determine the potential anti-cancer activity of the combination of BBR and anti-PD-L1, we first treated v cells with BBR. The cell viability of Hep-3B and HCCLM3 with BBR treatment was measured by Cell Count Kit 8 assay. Cytometry by time-of-flight was performed to analyze tumor tissues after treatment with BBR and/or anti-PD-L1. Proliferation-, migration-, and invasion-related markers were measured by western blotting and immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: The results showed that BBR significantly inhibited the proliferation of Hep-3B and HCCLM3.The combination treatment of BBR and anti-PD-L1 had a prominent inhibitory effect on HCC tumorigenesis. Cytometry by time-of-flight analysis indicated that BBR affects the immune subsets in the tumors. Besides, BBR and anti-PD-L1 inhibited the migration and invasion of HCC by inactivating the phosphorylation of Erk. CONCLUSION: Our study proposed that the combination treatment of BBR and anti-PD-L1 markedly inhibited the tumorigenesis of HCC by Erk signaling pathway. We hope our research can provide a new strategy for the potential of BBR as a therapeutic agent in the treatment of HCC."

Berberine (BBR), extracted from Coptis chinensis Franch., Phellodendron bark, Berberis vulgaris, and Berberis petiolaris, could be a potential multi-target drug for depression. To summarize the effects of BBR on depression in terms of in vitro or in vivo experiments, we searched electronic databases, such as PubMed, Web of Science, Google Scholar, Wanfang Database, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure, from inception until May 2024. Then, we summarize that BBR has indirect antidepressant properties to improve depressive symptoms, manifesting in modulating the gut microbial community, strengthening the intestinal barrier, increasing the abundance of short-chain fatty acid-producing bacteria, and regulating tryptophan metabolism. BBR also exerts antidepressant-like effects via remodulating nuclear factor-erythroid 2-related factor 2/antioxidant response element pathway, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, and peroxisome proliferators-activated receptor-delta. Nevertheless, further clinical trials and more high-quality animal studies are needed to show the actual clinical value of BBR for depression.",

      "abstract": "Endometrial cancer remains a significant therapeutic challenge due to drug resistance and heterogeneity. This study leverages the synergistic potential of curcumin (CUR) and berberine (BBR) co-crystals encapsulated in a nanohydrogel to address these challenges through a pharmacokinetically and pharmacodynamically targeted therapeutic strategy. The nanohydrogel formulation significantly improves the solubility, stability, and bioavailability of CUR/BBR co-crystals, optimizing their therapeutic delivery and sustained release under physiological and tumor microenvironment conditions. On the other hand, the dual inhibitory mechanism of CUR and BBR, with CUR covalently binding to the active site of caspase-3 and BBR non-covalently targeting the allosteric site, achieves enhanced apoptotic activity by disrupting both the catalytic and conformational functions of caspase-3. In vitro cytotoxicity assays demonstrate remarkable efficacy of the CUR/BBR nanohydrogel, achieving an IC50 of 12.36 μg/mL against HEC-59 endometrial cancer cells, significantly outperforming the individual components and the standard drug Camptothecin (IC50: 17.27 μg/mL). Caspase-3/7 assays confirm enhanced apoptosis induction for the nanohydrogel formulation compared to co-crystals alone and Camptothecin. Molecular dynamics simulations and binding free energy analyses further validate the synergistic interaction of CUR and BBR in their dual binding mode. This study introduces a novel therapeutic approach by enhancing drug delivery and dual targeting mechanisms, demonstrating the potential of CUR-BBR nanohydrogel as a robust therapy for EC. This strategy offers a promising platform for addressing drug resistance and improving outcomes in endometrial cancer therapy.",

      "abstract": "Liver fibrosis, caused by chronic hepatic injury, is a major threat to human health worldwide, as there are no specific drugs available for its treatment. Natural compounds, such as berberine (BBR) and quercetin (QR), have shown the ability to regulate energy metabolism and protect the liver without significant adverse effects. Additionally, combination therapy (the cocktail therapy approach), using multiple drugs, has shown promise in treating complicated conditions, including liver injury. In this study, we prepared a salt formulation of BBR and QR (BQS) to enhance their combined effect on liver fibrosis. The formation of BQS was confirmed using various analytical techniques, including nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), powder X-ray diffractometry (PXRD), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The results demonstrated that the dissolution efficiency and bioavailability of QR significantly increased in the BQS form, aligning with that of BBR, compared to the physically mixed (BQP) form. Moreover, BQS exhibited a superior inhibitory effect on fibrosis compared to BQP in the human hepatic stellate cell line LX-2 by modulating lipid accumulation, inflammation, apoptosis, and the cell cycle. Furthermore, in a mouse model of hepatic fibrosis induced by methionine and choline-deficient (MCD) diets, BQS demonstrated enhanced anti-fibrotic activities compared to BQP. These findings suggest that BQS holds promise as a potential alternative treatment for liver fibrosis. Importantly, this study provides novel insights into achieving a cocktail effect through the salt formation of two or more drugs. The results highlight the potential of salt formulations in enhancing the therapeutic efficacy and consistent biological processes of drug combinations.",

Recent studies have demonstrated that berberine possesses a broad spectrum of pharmacological activities, including not only antioxidant properties but also the ability to lower blood glucose, modulate lipid profiles, and mitigate inflammation. These findings suggest that berberine holds significant potential as a therapeutic agent for renal diseases, highlighting its substantial research value. Moreover, when administered orally, berberine has been shown to exhibit a wide therapeutic safety margin. Several studies have identified berberine's renoprotective effects across a range of kidney disorders, including diabetic nephropathy, renal fibrosis, renal aging, kidney toxicity induced by chemotherapy and antibiotics. These properties underscore berberine's evolving therapeutic potential for both acute kidney injury (AKI) and chronic kidney disease (CKD). In summary, the research discussed in this article provides a comprehensive overview of the renoprotective effects of BBR and elucidates the molecular mechanisms underlying its therapeutic potential in the treatment of various renal disease.

Conventional therapies relieve early PD symptoms, but they do not repair dopaminergic neurons. Berberine (BBR) and caffeine (CAF), both natural alkaloids, exhibited neuroprotective effects in many neurodegenerative disorders. Consequently, we hypothesized that the combination of BBR and CAF therapies would offer protection against PD-related impairments in the rotenone (ROT)-induced rat model when compared to the commercial drug, metformin (MTF). Our results showed that the combined administration of BBR (25 mg/kg/day) and CAF (2.5 mg/kg/day) for four weeks prevented motor deficits, weight reduction, dopamine (DA) depletion, and monoamine oxidase (MAO) activity in ROT-induced rats in comparison with monotherapy of BBR and CAF along with MTF. This combination produced a notable neuroprotective effect by reducing tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and interleukin-16 (IL-6) in midbrain of rats. BBR and CAF combinations markedly normalized tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) levels and decreased total α-syn and α-syn-pser129 aggregation and increased protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) levels. Histological analysis indicated that damaged neurons exhibited significant amelioration with the co-administration of BBR and CAF. The molecular docking results indicated that both BBR and CAF had notable binding affinity for the protein pocket surrounding the α-syn, PP2A, and TH in comparison to MTF. They are predicted to serve as effective inhibitors of enzyme-mediated phosphorylation of α-syn-pser129. Conclusively, combined BBR and CAF administration presents a novel strategy for neuroprotection by blocking the initial events in PD incidence, demonstrating considerable anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory benefits relative to MTF.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) is a global concern. The gut microbiota and hepatic fatty acid beta-oxidation have been shown to be important factors in the development of MAFLD. Independently, exercise and berberine can significantly ameliorate symptoms of MAFLD, although the specific mechanism is not clear; moreover, it is not known whether the combination of exercise and berberine produces a better therapeutic effect. METHODS: Over an experimental period of 17 weeks, the effects of exercise, berberine, and a combined (exercise/berberine) intervention on the composition of the gut microbiota and the expression of hepatic fatty acid beta-oxidation related proteins were examined. The mice were divided into five treatment groups: CON (control group, n = 10), HFD (high-fat diet, n = 10), HFE (high-fat diet + exercise, n = 10), HFB (high-fat diet + berberine, n = 10), and HBE (high-fat-diet + exercise + berberine, n = 10). The dose of BBR administered for oral gavage was 300 mg/kg, once per day, for 8 weeks. Mice were subjected to treadmill exercise, 5 days per week for 8 weeks, and the intensity was increased gradually. RESULTS: Serological and histopathological results showed that exercise, berberine and a combined (exercise/berberine) intervention effectively improved liver lipid accumulation caused by a high-fat diet. Analysis of 16S rRNA showed that the three interventions restored the species and number of gut microbiota in MAFLD mice. The functional prediction of gut microbiota revealed significant differences in beta-oxidation-related units among groups. Simultaneously, exercise and berberine intervention regulated the expression of hepatic fatty acid beta-oxidation-related proteins ACOX1, HMGCS2, and CPT-1α, with the combined intervention having a more significant effect than each intervention alone. CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that exercise and berberine ameliorate MAFLD by regulating the gut microbiota and hepatic fatty acid beta-oxidation, suggesting that their combination may be a potential therapy for MALFD."

Berberine supplements are readily available over-the-counter in the United States. It has recently gained popularity on social media and is increasingly being used as complementary and alternative medicine. Berberine possesses a broad spectrum of pharmacological properties, which may be a result of its potent antioxidant properties and its regulatory effects on the gut microbiome. Acne, atopic dermatitis, pigmentary disorders, hidradenitis suppurativa, psoriasis, and skin aging are complex disorders, often requiring multifaceted treatment strategies. Berberine's broad mechanisms of action make it a promising candidate for the management of these conditions. This review explores the mechanisms of action of berberine and its clinical relevance in the management of dermatologic diseases. J Drugs Dermatol. 2025;24(3):298-301 doi:10.36849/JDD.8899.",

      "abstract": "IMPORTANCE: Few of the available therapies for type 2 diabetes (T2D) comprehensively address disease burden beyond glycemic control. Examining whether berberine ursodeoxycholate (HTD1801), a first-in-class gut-liver anti-inflammatory metabolic modulator, has the potential to treat the core aspects of metabolic disease is important. OBJECTIVE: To assess the safety and efficacy of HTD1801 in patients with T2D that is inadequately controlled with diet and exercise. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This phase 2 double-blind, placebo-controlled, 12-week randomized clinical trial, conducted in China between March 2022 and January 2023, included patients with T2D who underwent 8 or more weeks of diet and exercise, had a hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) level of 7.0% to 10.5%, and had a fasting plasma glucose (FPG) level less than 250.5 mg/dL. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomized 1:1:1 to placebo (n = 38), HTD1801 500 mg twice daily (n = 37), and HTD1801 1000 mg twice daily (n = 38). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary end point was the HbA1c level change from baseline to week 12. Secondary end points included glycemic, hepatic, and cardiometabolic parameters. The primary end point was analyzed using a mixed-effects model for repeated measures, with the HbA1c level change from baseline as the dependent variable. Treatment group, measurement time point, and interaction between treatment group and measurement time point were independent variables. RESULTS: The study included 113 patients with T2D (mean [SD] age, 54.3 [10.6] years; 72 male [63.7%]) who were randomized. Among these patients, the mean (SD) HbA1c level was 8.2% (0.8%); body mass index, 25.5 (3.7), calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared; and FPG level, 160.7 (38.3) mg/dL. Baseline disease severity was balanced across treatment groups. The primary end point was achieved with significant dose-dependent reductions in the HbA1c level in both HTD1801 groups compared with the placebo group. The least-squares mean difference in the HbA1c level at week 12 was -0.4% (95% CI, -0.79% to -0.03%; P = .04) for the 500-mg group and -0.7% (95% CI, -1.10% to -0.35%; P < .001) for the 1000-mg group compared with the placebo group. HbA1c level reductions were paralleled with mean (SD) improvements in the FPG level in both the 500-mg group (-13.0 [38.2] mg/dL) and the 1000-mg group (-18.4 [21.8] mg/dL) groups. Reductions were observed in lipids and markers of liver injury in the 1000-mg group. HTD1801 was safe and well tolerated, with 110 patients (97.3%) completing the study. Treatment-emergent adverse events, generally mild, occurred in 59 patients (52.2%) overall. One patient (in the 500-mg group) experienced a serious adverse event of retinal hemorrhage, which was unlikely related to treatment. No patients discontinued due to an adverse event. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial, treatment with HTD1801 resulted in significant reductions in the HbA1c level and improvements in key cardiometabolic and liver parameters. HTD1801 was safe and well tolerated. These findings are being confirmed in ongoing phase 3 studies. The effects demonstrated by HTD1801 support an oral treatment option for T2D and its comorbidities.

In this study, we developed berberine liposome-modified bone cement specifically aimed at treating osteomyelitis induced by Staphylococcus aureus. We characterized the physical properties of this modified bone cement, conducted in vitro antibacterial assays to evaluate its efficacy in eradicating Staphylococcus aureus biofilm, established an in vivo rat model of osteomyelitis, and performed histopathological assessments alongside micro-CT analysis of bone parameters. The results indicated that the berberine liposome-modified bone cement exhibited favorable biodegradability and sustained-release characteristics, with a drug release rate of more than 90% within 14 days, while effectively eliminating bacterial biofilm with a biofilm eradication rate of up to 80% and facilitating bone repair with a bone volume fraction of 80%. This innovative treatment demonstrated both safety and efficacy in addressing tibial osteomyelitis in rats, thereby offering novel insights and methodologies for clinical interventions against osteomyelitis."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury is a major contributor to myocardial dysfunction and tissue damage. A natural alkaloid-Berberine having a wide range of pharmacological properties, has garnered interest for its potential cardioprotective properties. This study aimed to investigate the protective effects of berberine on myocardial tissue in a rat model of myocardial ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury. Additionally, the study explored the role of the miR-184/NOTCH1 signaling pathway in mediating these effects. METHODS: Male Wistar rats were randomly assigned to five groups: sham-operated control, I/R injury, I/R treated with berberine, I/R treated with inhibitor NC and I/R treated with a miR-184 inhibitor. The I/R injury was induced by ligating the left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery for 30 minutes, followed by 2 hours of reperfusion. Berberine was administered orally at 100 mg/kg/day for 2 weeks, and the miR-184 inhibitor was administered via intraperitoneal injection. Hemodynamic parameters were recorded using a pressure sensor connected to a catheter inserted into the left ventricle. Myocardial infarct size was assessed using TTC staining, while histological and molecular changes were evaluated through H&E staining, TUNEL assay, and Western blotting. The expression levels of target genes were analyzed using quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). RESULTS: Berberine significantly reduced myocardial infarct size and improved hemodynamic parameters compared to the untreated I/R group. Additionally, berberine treatment attenuated apoptosis as evidenced by decreased TUNEL-positive cells. The miR-184 inhibitor also demonstrated protective effects by modulating key signaling pathways involved in myocardial injury. Western blot analysis revealed downregulation of NOTCH1 and HES1 expression in treated groups, indicating a potential mechanism for the observed cardio protection. CONCLUSION: Berberine and miR-184 inhibition offer significant protection against myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury. These findings suggest that targeting miR-184 and associated pathways may be a promising therapeutic strategy for reducing cardiac damage following ischemia-reperfusion."

A lack of memory, cognition, and other forms of cognitive dissonance characterizes AD, which affects approximately 50 million people worldwide. This study aimed to identify the neuroprotective effects of berberine chloride (BC) against aluminium chloride (AlCl3)-induced AD in zebrafish larvae by inhibiting oxidative stress and neuroinflammation. BC toxicity was assessed by evaluating survival rates, malformations, and heart rates in zebrafish larvae following treatment with varying concentrations of BC. This study elucidates the mechanisms of BC through an extensive range of biochemical assays, behavioral testing, and molecular docking analysis. The developmental toxicity assessment of BC indicated that doses up to 40 μM did not cause any developmental abnormalities until 96 h post fertilization. The LC50 value of BC in zebrafish larvae was found to be 50.16 μM. The biochemical and behavioral changes induced by AlCl3 in zebrafish larvae were significantly mitigated by BC treatment. Our findings demonstrate that BC can reduce total cholesterol and triglyceride levels in AlCl3-induced AD zebrafish larvae. Our molecular docking results indicated that BC significantly interacted with the ABCA1 protein, suggesting that BC may act as an ABCA1 agonist. Based on our results, it can be concluded that BC may serve as an effective therapeutic agent for mitigating oxidative stress by altering cholesterol metabolism in AlCl3-induced AD."

In response, the antibacterial properties of natural products derived from traditional plants are being investigated as potential treatments for multidrug resistance. This study demonstrates the potent antibacterialimoact of Berberine (BBR), a compound derived from traditional Chinese medicine, against the community-associated MRSA (CA-MRSA) strain USA300 LAC. Through a comprehensive series of in vitro antibacterial experiments and gene-level investigations, we discovered that BBR compromises the integrity of the USA300 LAC cell wall structure. This mechanism of action is likely attributed to the inhibition of the tarO gene, which encodes a critical enzyme in the initial stage of wall teichoic acid (WTA) biosynthesis, thereby suppressing WTA synthesis, an essential component of the cell wall. Additionally, BBR upregulates the expression of lytic enzymes LytM and SsaA, resulting in accelerated hydrolysis of peptidoglycan, a major structural element of the cell wall. This disruption ultimately leads to the destruction of the USA300 LAC cell wall. Moreover, combined antibacterial assays reveal that BBR synergistically enhances the antibacterial effect of Oxacillin against USA300 LAC. Overall, our findings elucidate the antibacterial mechanism of BBR, a traditional Chinese medicine monomer, against MRSA and highlight its promising potential for clinical application in the treatment of MRSA.",

      "abstract": "This study aimed to explore the protective effects of berberine against rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and clarify the role of activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3) in the mechanism of action of berberine, using a lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated SW982 human synovial cell line. Berberine treatment resulted in a concentration-dependent reduction in LPS-induced proinflammatory cytokines and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) in SW982 cells. These inhibitory effects were associated with increased ATF3 expression, reduced nuclear translocation of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), and diminished phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). In contrast, ATF3 knockdown reversed the suppressive effects of berberine on proinflammatory cytokines and MMP production, leading to enhanced MAPK phosphorylation; however, it had minimal impact on adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) phosphorylation. Furthermore, AMPK knockdown negated the protective effects of berberine and reduced ATF3 levels, whereas treatment with 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide, an AMPK activator, replicated the beneficial effects of berberine. In an in vivo collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) mouse model, intraperitoneal administration of berberine significantly reduced paw edema and arthritis severity, accompanied by ATF3 induction and increased AMPK phosphorylation in the synovial tissue. These findings highlighted the pivotal role of ATF3 in mediating the protective effects of berberine in RA- and LPS-activated synoviocytes, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic agent for RA management.",

      "abstract": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the common deadliest cancers worldwide. In Malaysia, the numbers of new CRC cases were horrific and worrisome. Telomerase is both prognostic indicator and predictor of carcinogenesis in CRC patients. Berberine, a telomerase inhibitor, was used in clinical trials and metabolomic studies; however, the association of telomerase with metabolites and metabolic pathways was not fully understood. Colorectal cancer cell line HCT 116 was cultured and treated with 10.54 µg/mL berberine. The cells were harvested at different time points to conduct subsequent analyses. The methods used in this research were real time-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to assess RNA expressions; Western blot to determine protein levels; TELOTAGGG Telomerase PCR ELISA to determine relative telomerase activity (RTA); 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) staining to determine percentage of nuclei damage; fluorescence microscopy for cell area; spectrophotometric potassium iodide assay for intracellular hydrogen peroxide concentration [H2O2]; as well as liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LCMS) and tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) to investigate the intracellular metabolites. Partial least square-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) score plot exhibited an improved separation compared to principal component analysis (PCA) when metabolomic data analysis of HCT 116 at various berberine treatment durations was conducted. Time and berberine treatment had an impact on RTA in HCT 116. RTA was discovered to be positively and negatively correlated to 14 and 2 metabolites, respectively. Glutamic acid was consistently found correlated to RTA. Other four metabolites, i.e., MG(14:0), [3-[hydroxy(phosphonooxy)phosphoryl]oxyphenyl] phosphono hydrogen phosphate), (3S,6S)-6-[[(3S,6R)-6-[(2S,3S,5S)-2,5-diiodo-4-methoxy-6-methyloxan-3-yl]oxy-3,4,5-trihydroxyoxan-2-yl]methoxy]-3,4,5-trihydroxyoxane-2-carboxylic acid, and 1-[5-O-(5'-adenylyloxyphosphonyl)-beta-D-ribofuranosyl]-5-amino-1H-imidazole-4-carboxamide, were newly discovered to be connected to RTA in HCT 116. Four metabolic pathways that majorly affected shared glutamic acid and glutamine. Nitrogen metabolism, D-glutamine and D-glutamate metabolism, glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism, and aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis have been identified to be associated with RTA. Network analyses hinted that glutamic acid was also associated with oxidative stress mechanism. The multiple roles glutamic acid acted in diverse metabolic pathways and interaction networks emphasized the importance of glutamic acid in HCT 116 regarding RTA. This research establishes the association between RTA and several chosen RNAs, proteins, metabolites, and oxidative stress mechanisms, consequential in morphological alteration in HCT 116, to expand the knowledge of the intricate biological relationships and telomerase mechanism in CRC."

      "abstract": "Ostreid herpesvirus 1 (OsHV-1) infection is the primary viral disease responsible for large-scale mortality in bivalve mollusks worldwide, and effective strategies to control the outbreaks of this disease are still lacking. Berberine (BBR), a plant-derived alkaloid, has demonstrated antiviral activity against various vertebrate viruses, while its potential antiviral effects on molluscan herpesviruses remain to be fully elucidated. Therefore, the present study sought to investigate the potential of berberine hydrochloride (BBH) against OsHV-1 infection in blood clams (Anadara broughtonii). The most optimal BBH concentration was figured out according to virus replication and mortality rates during in vivo experimental infection. Quantitative PCR and reverse transcription quantitative PCR were utilized to monitor the OsHV-1 genomic copy numbers and viral gene transcription levels during the development of OsHV-1 infection in the BBH-treated and control groups. The results demonstrated that a 3 mg/L BBH bath immersion significantly suppressed OsHV-1 replication in blood clams. During the early stage of infection (24 h), BBH treatment significantly reduced the expression of OsHV-1 open reading frames (ORFs) related to early enzymes, putative membrane proteins, and nucleocapsid proteins. At 96 h post-infection, all untreated blood clams died, whereas the survival rate of BBH-treated individuals increased to 46.67%. This study provides preliminary evidence for the inhibitory effects of BBH on OsHV-1, paving the way for the development of pharmacological control technologies for OsHV-1 infections.",

This natural compound promotes the growth of beneficial bacteria such as Bacteroides, Bifidobacterium, and Lactobacillus while reducing harmful bacteria such as Escherichia coli. Clinical and preclinical studies demonstrate that Berberine helps regulate T2D and metabolic disorders, improves blood glucose levels during T2D, and reduces lipid profile and chronic inflammation, especially when combined with probiotics. Berberine represents a promising adjuvant therapy for inflammatory diseases, particularly intestinal disorders, due to its multifaceted actions of inhibiting proinflammatory cytokines and pathways during IBS, IBD, and UC and its modulation of gut microbiota and/or enhancement of the integrity of the intestinal epithelial barrier. This review establishes the basis for future treatment protocols with berberine and fully elucidates its mechanisms."

Among the symptoms caused by S. suis, including septicemia, pneumonia, endo-carditis, arthritis, and meningitis, the latter is the most overlooked. In the present study, we explored the mechanism of action of berberine against S. suis meningitis by obtaining berberine-related action targets, porcine S. suis meningitis targets, and human S. suis meningitis targets from open databases. We constructed a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network by using the STRING database and employed Cytoscape 3.8.0 to screen for core targets. We performed Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analyses through DAVID. We identified 31 potential targets of berberine, of which Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), fibronectin 1 (FN1), superoxide dismutase (SOD1), and catalase (CAT) were the four most critical targets. GO analysis revealed the enrichment of terms related to the response to oxidative stress and the inflammatory response. KEGG analysis revealed the enrichment of the interleukin 17 (IL-17), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-Akt, TLR, tumor necrosis factor (TNF), and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways. In addition, the admetSAR results showed that berberine can cross the blood-brain barrier. The molecular docking results indicated key binding activity between TLR4-berberine and FN1-berberine. In summary, berberine protects against Streptococcus suis meningitis by regulating inflammatory response and oxidative stress in humans and pigs. Our study updates the current knowledge of the targets of S. suis meningitis to exploit new drugs in humans and pigs, to develop environmentally friendly and antibiotic-free animal-derived food products, and to improve the farming industry and economic development."

Methods: In the present study, five experimental diets, a control diet (Con), a high-lipid diet (HL), and high-lipid·diets·supplemented with an antibiotic cocktail (HLA), berberine (HLB), or both (HLAB) were fed to zebrafish (Danio rerio) for 30 days. Results: The HLB group showed significantly greater weight gain and feed intake than the HLA and other groups, respectively (p < 0.05). Hepatic triglyceride (TG) and total cholesterol (TC) levels, lipogenesis, and proinflammatory cytokine gene expression were significantly upregulated by the high-lipid diet, but significantly downregulated by berberine supplementation. Conversely, the expression levels of intestinal and/or hepatic farnesoid X receptor (fxr), Takeda G protein-coupled receptor 5 (tgr5), lipolysis genes, and zonula occludens 1 (zo1) exhibited the opposite trend. Compared with the HLB group, the HLAB group displayed significantly greater hepatic TG content and proinflammatory cytokine expression, but significantly lower intestinal bile salt hydrolase (BSH) activity and intestinal and/or hepatic fxr and tgr5 expression levels. The HL treatment decreased the abundance of certain probiotic bacteria (e.g., Microbacterium, Cetobacterium, and Gemmobacter) and significantly increased the pathways involved in cytochrome P450, p53 signaling, and ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters. The HLB group increased some probiotic bacteria abundance, particularly BSH-producing bacteria (e.g., Escherichia Shigella). Compared with the HLB group, the abundance of BSH-producing bacteria (e.g., Bifidobacterium and Enterococcus) and pathways related to Notch signaling and Wnt signaling were reduced in the HLAB group. Conclusions: This study revealed that berberine's lipid-lowering and intestine-protective effects are closely related to the intestinal microbiota, especially BSH-producing bacteria."

Berberine (BBR), a natural pentacyclic isoquinoline alkaloid, has been used as a cost-effective treatment for intestinal infections in Asia for many years. However, the effect of BBR on rCDI is not clear. The efficacy and underlying mechanisms of BBR were evaluated in a vancomycin-dependent rCDI mouse model and an intestinal organoids model. The study findings showed that BBR treatment alleviated the severity of infection and increased survival rate in rCDI mice. Mechanistically, BBR alleviated intestinal epithelial damage with higher Occludin expression, suppressed some inflammatory pathways and reduced the level of inflammatory factors in both the caecum and serum. Moreover, 16S rRNA sequencing analysis indicated that BBR reshaped the gut microbiota by increasing the abundance of Firmicutes and reducing the abundance of Proteobacteria. At genus level, BBR treatment increased levels of Blautia and Bilophila, and reduced levels of Proteus. In addition, acetic acid, one of the short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), was also increased after BBR treatment in rCDI mice. Collectively, BBR exerted a protective effect in rCDI via multiple underlying mechanisms and is a potential drug candidate for alleviating rCDI, but further research is needed in this area.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE: Berberine, a naturally occurring alkaloid, has shown promise as a neuroprotective agent in preclinical models of ischemic stroke. This systematic review aims to comprehensively evaluate the neuroprotective effects of berberine in animal models of cerebral ischemia and elucidate its potential mechanisms of action. METHODS: A systematic search was conducted across nine databases, including PubMed, Embase, Cochrane CENTRAL, Web of Science, Scopus, ScienceDirect, Europe PMC, DOAJ, and Google Scholar, from inception to June 30, 2024. Controlled in vivo studies investigating the neuroprotective effects of berberine in animal models of focal cerebral ischemia were included. Two independent reviewers screened studies, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias using the SYRCLE tool. RESULTS: Eighteen studies met the inclusion criteria, encompassing various animal models of ischemic stroke. Berberine treatment consistently resulted in significant reductions in infarct volume and improvements in neurological function compared to control groups. Specifically, berberine doses ranging from 10 mg/kg to 300 mg/kg significantly decreased infarct sizes (p < 0.05). Berberine also exhibited anti-inflammatory effects by reducing pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6, and downregulating the TLR4/NF-κB signaling pathway (p < 0.05). Antioxidant effects were evidenced by decreased malondialdehyde levels and increased antioxidant enzymes like superoxide dismutase and glutathione (p < 0.05). Additional findings from studies with smaller sample sizes indicated that berberine reduced apoptotic cell death by decreasing TUNEL-positive cells and modulating apoptosis-related proteins, including increasing Bcl-2 and decreasing cleaved caspase-3 levels (p < 0.05). Berberine also promoted neurogenesis and synaptic plasticity by increasing the expression of BDNF, TrkB, and synaptic proteins SYP and PSD95 (p < 0.05), and enhanced autophagic flux by modulating key autophagy markers (p < 0.05). The risk of bias varied among studies, with some lacking detailed reporting on randomization and blinding procedures. CONCLUSION: Berberine demonstrates significant neuroprotective effects in preclinical models of ischemic stroke through multiple mechanisms, including anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, anti-apoptotic, and neuroregenerative actions. These findings support the potential of berberine as a multifaceted therapeutic agent for ischemic stroke. Further well-designed clinical trials are warranted to confirm its efficacy and safety in human patients.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: This study aims to investigate the effects and potential mechanisms of berberine in conjunction with Jianpi Yishen Huazhuo formulation (JPYSHZF) on obese rats that serve as a model for polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). METHODS: Letrozole combined with high-fat diet (HFD) was used to establish an overweight PCOS rat model. After successful modeling, each intervention group was monitored for 28 d. An oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) is performed to assess glucose metabolism. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to determine the levels of sex hormones and serum levels of gastrointestinal hormones in rats. Biochemical analyzers were used to assess blood lipid levels. The protein expression levels of p38, PI3K, GLUT4, and AKT in ovarian tissue were demonstrated using Western Blotting (WB). Real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) was used to measure the mRNA expression levels of p38, PI3K, GLUT4 and AKT in the same tissue. The morphological changes of ovarian tissue were observed using Hematoxylin-eosin (HE). RESULTS: Treatment with berberine in conjunction with JPYSHZF has been shown to reduce serum testosterone T and luteinizing hormone (LH) levels while increasing serum follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and E2 levels. This combination therapy also decreases the LH/FSH ratio and ameliorates polycystic ovary-like pathological changes in the ovaries of rats with PCOS. Additionally, this treatment decreases serum TC, TG, and LDL-c levels while increasing HDL-c levels. It also reduces levels of GLU and Ghrelin while enhancing levels of CCK, PYY, and GLP-1. Furthermore, the relative 6 of PI3K and AKT proteins, as well as the mRNA levels of PI3K, GLUT4, and AKT, were found to be increased. CONCLUSIONS: Berberine combined with JPYSHZF can improve the sex hormone levels, ovarian function, glucose and lipid metabolism levels, and gastrointestinal hormone levels in obese PCOS rats by activating the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, thereby playing a role in treating obese PCOS.",

Clinical studies suggest that combination therapy holds significant therapeutic potential to enhance SOR's efficacy. Berberine (BBR), a multiple-targeted agent, shows great promise in combination therapy. This study aims to investigate whether BBR can enhance SOR's effect in vitro and in vivo, and to elucidate the underlying mechanisms. We selected BEL-7402 cells and Huh7 cells for our investigation and explored the effect of BBR on the sensitivity of SOR using the cell counting kit-8 assay, cell cycle analysis, reactive oxygen species (ROS) detection assay, Annexin V/PI staining, western blotting, and the construction of tumor xenograft models. Our findings demonstrate that BBR not only enhances the proliferation-inhibitory effects, apoptosis, and ROS generation induced by SOR, but also sensitizes tumor xenograft models to SOR. Notably, this synergistic effect is found to depend on AMPK activation and the inhibition of the mTOR signaling pathway, a mechanism coincident with that of metformin (MET). Furthermore, our results reveal that BBR exhibits a stronger synergistic effect with SOR compared to MET. These results may contribute to developing innovative combination strategies for the treatment of advanced HCC.",

Currently, no specific treatment options are available for HAdV infections. This study used a green fluorescence protein-based, high-throughput screening (HTS) assay on a botanical drug library containing 3697 botanical compounds to identify agents that could inhibit HAdV. Four compounds with anti-HAdV-C5 activity in the low-micromolar range were identified and inhibited other wild-type HAdVs known to cause SARIs. Among these compounds, 13-methylberberine chloride presented the highest select index values. Berberine is a commercially available natural product-derived isoquinoline alkaloid with multiple pharmacological effects and is widely used in Asian countries. We systematically evaluated the anti-HAdV activity of six berberine-derived compounds in vitro and performed a time-of-drug-addition assay to explore their antiviral modes of action. Mechanistic studies revealed that berberine and its analogs inhibit HAdV replication by downregulating the MAPK signaling pathway, particularly ERK activation, which is crucial for viral replication and progeny production. Our findings suggest that berberine is a promising candidate for the development of anti-HAdV therapies.",

Addressing this urgent need, our study focuses on developing a berberine (BBR)-loaded nanoliposome (NL) as a targeted drug delivery system to combat GBM. Synthesized using the thin film hydration method and characterized through advanced physical and spectroscopic techniques, these NLs demonstrate promising potential in enhancing BBR's therapeutic efficacy. The NL formulation achieved an impressive loading efficiency of 65.71 ± 1.31% with a particle size of 83 ± 12 nm, ensuring optimal delivery. Sustained release experiments revealed that 82.65 ± 1.75% of the encapsulated BBR was consistently released over 48 h, highlighting its controlled release capabilities.In vitroassays, including cell viability, TUNEL, and western blot analysis, confirmed the potent anti-cancer effects of NL-BBR. The formulation significantly disrupted the metabolism of U-87 glioblastoma cells, inducing enhanced autophagy and apoptosis, ultimately leading to cell death via intrinsic apoptotic pathways. Additionally, western blot results demonstrated that NL-BBR effectively suppressed the mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway, a critical driver of GBM progression. This study underscores the transformative potential of incorporating BBR into NLs, which not only enhances its solubility and bioavailability but also significantly amplifies its therapeutic impact. These findings pave the way for advanced nano-based interventions in GBM treatment, offering a glimmer of hope for improved outcomes in this challenging cancer landscape.",

Through target fishing, molecular docking, and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) analyses, combined with cellular and molecular experiments, we further identified 6 targets of berberine. These findings provide a comprehensive summary of berberine's direct molecular targets, offering a theoretical foundation for further exploration of its diverse pharmacological activities."

Methods: Sixty adult female rats divided into six groups: control, sham ovariectomized, ovariectomized, and three BBR treated ovariectomized groups (50, 100, and 200 mg/kg/day, for eight weeks). Measurements included serum oestradiol, glucose, HOMA-IR, lipid profile , tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), oxidative stress markers , osteocalcin (OC), bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (ALP), cross-linked Carboxy-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen (CTX-I), and bone tissue analysis. Results: Ovariectomized rats exhibited significant metabolic and bone deterioration, such as increased glucose, insulin, HOMA IR, total cholestrol (TC), LDL-C, TNF-α, OC, ALP, CTX-I, and MDA levels, alongside decreased oestradiol, HDL-C, and GSH levels, and DNA fragmentation (P < 0.001). BBR treatment showed dose-dependent improvements in all parameters. Conclusion: BBR demonstrates significant ameliorative effects on metabolic and bone health in ovariectomized rats, highlighting its potential therapeutic benefits for postmenopausal conditions."

This study investigates whether Berberine(BBR) protects mice from obese skeletal muscle atrophy and the underlying molecular mechanism. Twenty C57BL/6 mice were fed a high-fat diet until they weighed more than 20% of the average body weight of the control group. The mice were then divided into two groups and gavaged with BBR or vehicle for 8 weeks. 10 mice were used as controls. Fasting blood glucose was measured, an oral glucose tolerance test was performed, and the mice were measured for grip strength and exercise capacity. H&E and Oil Red O staining were used to observe the pathological changes of skeletal muscle. MURF1, FBXO32, BAX, BCL2, P62, LC3 and mitophagy receptor FUNDC1 were observed in mice. BBR was intervened in C2C12 myotubes. The role of FUNDC1 was verified by RNA interference. We found that BBR treatment increased grip strength and improved muscle function. BBR not only reduced weight gain, excessive lipid accumulation and hyperlipidemia, but also ameliorated obesity-induced skeletal muscle atrophy and apoptosis. BBR promoted autophagy and increased FUNDC1 protein expression. The same positive effects were observed after BBR intervening on C2C12 myotubes, whereas FUNDC1 RNA interference attenuated the anti-skeletal muscle atrophy effect of BBR. These results suggest that BBR ameliorated obesity-induced skeletal muscle atrophy in mice by modulating the skeletal muscle mitophagy receptor FUNDC1, which may be a potential therapeutic target for obesity-induced skeletal muscle atrophy.",

      "abstract": "Invasive fungal infection is usually caused by Candida albicans infection, which has a high incidence rate and mortality in critically ill patients. New drugs are needed to combat this pathogen since the limited treatment options currently available and increasing resistance to existing drugs. Berberine (BBR) is an active compound in Coptis chinensis, Phellodendron chinense and Radix berberidis, which is clinically used to treat inflammatory bowel disease, but its inhibitory effect on drug-resistant fungi has not been clarified. In this study, based on the evidence of BBR inhibiting the expression of azole-resistance genes, reducing cell adhesion and disrupting biofilm formation, transcriptome analysis revealed that the disruption of iron acquisition pathway may be the core link in BBR inhibiting drug-resistant fungi. Combined with the subsequent experimental results, including the reduction of intracellular ferrous ion content, the weakening of iron reductase activity and the overall downregulation of the coding gene of the high-affinity iron reduction system, it is speculated that the fungal growth defect under BBR treatment is the result of the interruption of the high-affinity iron acquisition pathway. Ftr1 plays a central role in the drug targeting of this transport system. Meanwhile, due to the iron deficiency within the cell, the biological function of mitochondria is impaired, ultimately leading to fungal death. This study not only reflects the application value of BBR in the clinical treatment of fungal infections, but also provides a potential strategy to address the current drug-resistance dilemma.",

This study aimed to elucidate the antibacterial mode of action of combinations of berberine (Ber) or curcumin (Cur) with selected antibiotics (Ber-Ab or Cur-Ab) under blue light irradiation (420 nm) against Staphylococcus aureus, including methicillin-resistant (MRSA) and methicillin-susceptible (MSSA) strains. Multiple physiological parameters were assessed using complementary assays (fluorometry, epifluorescence microscopy, flame emission and atomic absorption spectroscopy, zeta potential, flow cytometry, and the plate agar method) to examine the effect on ROS production, membrane integrity, DNA damage, motility and virulence factors of S. aureus. Results indicated that blue light photoactivated Ber-Ab and Cur-Ab combinations led to substantial ROS generation, even at low concentrations, causing oxidative stress that severely impacted bacterial membrane integrity (approximately 90 % in MRSA and 40 % in MSSA). Membrane destabilization was further confirmed by elevated intercellular potassium release (≈ 2.00 and 2.40 µg/mL in MRSA and MSSA, respectively). Furthermore, significant DNA damage was observed in both strains (≈ 50 %). aPDI treatment with blue light also reduced S. aureus pathogenicity by impairing motility and inhibiting key virulence factors such as proteases, lipases, and gelatinases, all of which play key roles in the infectious process. Overall, Ber-Ab combinations demonstrated the highest efficacy across all parameters tested, highlighting for the first time the multi-target therapeutic potential of this phytochemical-based aPDI strategy to combat antibiotic-resistant S. aureus infections and improve wound infection treatment outcomes.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Diabetic nephropathy (DN) stands as one of the most severe complications of diabetes. Podocytes injury, particularly its attachment to the lateral glomerular basement membrane, serves as a crucial indicator of DN. Growing evidence suggests that berberine (BBR) can mitigate the onset and progression of DN. However, the molecular mechanisms through which BBR exerts its beneficial effects in the treatment of DN remain incompletely elucidated. PURPOSE: To explore the underlying mechanisms by which BBR exerts its therapeutic effects in DN. METHODS: High-throughput lncRNA sequencing on the renal cortex of both the DN model group and the normal SD group was performed to dig for differentially expressed lncRNAs. The expression of LOC102549726 was evaluated using qPCR. The biological functions of LOC102549726 were analyzed in podocyets and DN rats. The bioinformatics techniques, qPCR and WB were used to explore the potential molecular mechanisms. RESULTS: We found that lncRNA LOC102549726 was highly expressed in renal cortex of DN rats and podocytes subjected to high glucose conditions. Silencing LOC102549726 inhibited migration and apoptosis of podocytes. Mechanistically, LOC102549726 was identified as a facilitator of the expression of EGF and forkhead box O1 (FOXO1). BBR, a known therapeutic agent for DN, exhibited the ability to diminish the level of LOC102549726, EGF and FOXO1 in both DN rats and podocytes. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggested that BBR suppresses migration and apoptosis of podocytes in DN through targeting the LOC102549726/EGF/FOXO1 axis. This sheds light on a potential therapeutic avenue for mitigating the impact of DN on podocyte function.",

AIMS: This study aimed to investigate the protective effect of BBR on acute epileptic seizures induced by kainic acid (KA) in mice and further explore its mechanism of action in the aspect of analysis of gut microbiota. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The protective effect of BBR against acute epileptic seizures was assessed via Racine score and Nissl training. Alterations of gut microbiota and metabolites in seizure mice after BBR treatment were analyzed through 16S sequencing and lipidomics, respectively. RESULTS: Our results showed that the BBR remarkably alleviated acute epileptic seizures and hippocampal neuron damage in KA-induced mice. The analysis of gut microbiota indicated that BBR reduced the acute epileptic seizures in KA-induced mice by increasing the abundance of Bacteroidetes and Alloprevotella, regulating short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs). Results of lipidomics also identified 21 candidate metabolites in the colon and hippocampus possibly involved in the protective effect of BBR against acute seizures. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that BBR exerts neuroprotection against KA-induced epileptic seizures through remodeling gut microbiota-associated lipid metabolism in the colon and hippocampus.

Through network pharmacology analysis, two main potential target genes, β-amyloid precursor protein (APP) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARG), of BBR for AD therapy were screened out. Further experiments demonstrated that BV2 and C8-D1A treated with BBR were decreased in the mRNA and protein expression of APP and presenilin 1 while PPARG was increased with a reduction in the NF-κB pathway. A similar result was shown in vivo. Through a network pharmacology study, this study supported that BBR played a protective role in the AD mice model via blocking APP processing and amyloid plaque formation. It also promotes PPARG expression to blockage of NF-κB pathway-mediated inflammatory response and neuroinflammation."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Breast cancer (BC) is a health concern worldwide and is often accompanied by depressive symptoms in patients. In BC, elevated interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels contribute to an inflammatory signature linked to cancer stem cell (CSC) stemness and depressive behaviors. Bioactive food components, such as berberine (BBR), have preventative effects against BC by targeting CSCs. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to investigate the effects of BBR on breast CSC proliferation, on levels of specific micro (mi)RNAs and IL-6 in vitro and in vivo, and in alleviating depressive-like behaviors in mice with BC. METHODS: Mammosphere formation assays were conducted by treating murine 4T1 and human MDA-MB-231 BC cell lines with BBR. qPCR analysis of miRNAs miR-let-7c and miR-34a-5p was performed on 4T1 CSCs exposed to BBR. BBR was administered orally to female BALB/c, followed by injection with mammary carcinoma cells to induce BC. Behavioral tests were conducted to assess depressive-like behaviors. Tumor tissues were collected for ex vivo mammosphere assays, miRNA expression analysis, and IL-6 detection by ELISA. Serum was also collected for IL-6 analysis. RESULTS: BBR treatment inhibited mammosphere formation and proliferation of CSCs derived from 4T1 and MDA-MB-231 cell lines. Quantification of mammosphere formation showed a significant decrease in both cell lines at 75 μM BBR (4T1: P < 0.001; MDA-MB-231: P < 0.0001). BBR upregulated the expression of miRNAs miR-let-7c and miR-34a in both cell lines, with miR-34a showing a significant increase (P < 0.001) and let-7c showing a significant increase (P < 0.05) in expression. In vivo, oral administration of BBR reduced mammosphere formation in breast tumor tissues (P < 0.0001) and elevated expression of miR-145 and miR-34a, with both showing significant upregulation (P < 0.0001), indicating its potential tumor-suppressive effects. BBR treatment resulted in a significant decrease in serum IL-6 levels (P < 0.05), suggesting anti-inflammatory properties, while the IL-6 in tumor tissue did not show significant changes (P > 0.05). However, no significant differences were observed in depressive-like behaviors between control and treatment groups. CONCLUSIONS: BBR may have the potential to be used as an \"Epi-Natural Compound\" to prevent cancer by reducing inflammation and affecting epigenetics."

However, the pharmacological mechanism of action of BBR in anti-chronic atrophic gastritis (CAG) remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate the mechanism of action of BBR in CAG by integration of molecular biology and multi-omics studies strategy. METHODS: The CAG model was established by alternating drinking water of 0.1% ammonia and 20 mmol/L sodium deoxycholate, accompanied by an irregular diet. Serum biochemical indices including PGI, PGII, GAS-17, IL-6, IL-1β, and TNF-α were analyzed. HE and AB-PAS staining were employed to assess pathological damage in gastric tissue. The underlying molecular mechanism of BBR in CAG treatment was explored via the integration of network pharmacology, transcriptomics, widely targeted metabolomics and intestinal flora analysis. Finally, relevant key targets and pathway were verified. RESULTS: The results showed that BBR exerted therapeutic effects in improving CAG via alleviating inflammation response, maintaining the gastric mucosal barrier's integrity and repairing gastric mucosal tissues. Network pharmacology showed that the treatment of CAG by BBR mainly involved in inflammatory response, apoptosis, angiogenesis and metabolic processes. Furthermore, 234 different expression genes were identified in the gastric tissue transcriptome, which were mainly involved in biological processes such as cell adhesion, angiogenesis, apoptosis, cell migration and lipids metabolism by regulating the MAPK signaling pathway. Metabolomics results showed that 125 differential metabolites were also identified, while the pathways were mainly involved in D-glutamine and D-glutamate metabolism, and tyrosine metabolism, etc. Integrating transcriptomics and metabolomics analyses indicated that BBR directly regulated Carnitine C3:0, LPC (0:0/20:3), L-Glutamic Acid and FFA (15:0) by acting on SLC25A20, PNLIPRP1, PLA2G4C, GSR, GFPT2, GCLM, CTPS1, ACSL1, ACOT4 and ACOT2. 16S rRNA sequencing revealed that BBR could restore the balance of gut microbiota dysbiosis by significantly regulating the relative abundance of unclassified_Muribaculaceae and Lactobacillus_johnsonii. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that BBR alleviates CAG through the regulation of the MAPK signaling pathway, metabolic disorders and gut microbiota dysbiosis, thereby revealing the complex mechanism of BBR in relation to alleviating CAG from multiple levels and perspectives."

      "abstract": "The accumulation of aging cells significantly contributes to chronic inflammatory diseases such as atherosclerosis. Human carotid artery single-cell sequencing has shown that large numbers of aging foam cells are present in the plaques of human patients. Berberine (BBR) has been shown to inhibit cell senescence, however, the mechanisms involved in its treatment of atherosclerotic senescence have not yet been determined. Changes in plaque morphology and blood chemistry were observed in ApoE[Formula: see text] mice fed with a high-fat diet before and after BBR treatment. Inflammatory proteins linked to the senescence-associated secretory phenotypes (SASP) were detected in RAW264.7 and peritoneal macrophage-derived foam cells. Smart-seq analysis was used to explore the pathways associated with BBR therapy for atherosclerosis. Finally, the effect of lentivirus-mediated knockdown of RXRα in macrophages in plaques on atherosclerosis treatment with BBR was determined. We found that BBR reduced inflammation linked to SASP in atherosclerosis through the RXRα/PPARγ/NEDD4 signaling pathway. BBR increased GATA4 binding to p62, promoted ubiquitination, and inhibited SASP-associated protein production in RAW264.7 and peritoneal macrophage-derived foam cells. Mechanistically, according to the Smart-seq results, BBR activated RXRα and PPARγ, synergistically increased NEDD4 transcription levels, and promoted ubiquitination-mediated degradation of the GATA4/p62 complex. Additionally, the anti-aging impact of BBR on atherosclerosis was negated when macrophage-specific RXRα was knocked down using lentivirus (pLVCD68-shRNA RXRα) in ApoE[Formula: see text] mice. BBR activated PPARγ through RXRα-PPARγ immune complex in macrophage-derived foam cells, increased NEDD4 transcriptional activity, promoted ubiquitination of GATA4-p62 complex, and inhibited SASP-related inflammation. These findings suggest the potential of BBR as a novel approach to addressing SASP-associated inflammation in atherosclerosis.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: To explore the role of berberine (BBR) in ameliorating coronary endothelial cell injury in Kawasaki disease (KD) by regulating the complement and coagulation cascade. METHODS: Human coronary artery endothelial cells (HCAEC) were divided into a healthy control group, a KD group, and a BBR treatment group (n=3 for each group). The healthy control group and KD group were supplemented with 15% serum from healthy children and KD patients, respectively, while the BBR treatment group received 15% serum from KD patients followed by the addition of 20 mmol/L BBR. Differential protein expression was analyzed and identified using isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation technology and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, followed by GO functional enrichment analysis and KEGG signaling pathway enrichment analysis of the differential proteins. Western blot was used to detect differential protein expression. RESULTS: A total of 518 differential proteins were identified between the KD group and the healthy control group (300 upregulated proteins and 218 downregulated proteins). A total of 422 differential proteins were identified between the BBR treatment group and the KD group (221 upregulated proteins and 201 downregulated proteins). Bioinformatics analysis showed that compared to the healthy control group, the differential proteins in the KD group were enriched in the complement and coagulation cascade and ribosome biogenesis in eukaryotes. Compared to the KD group, the differential proteins in the BBR treatment group were also enriched in the complement and coagulation cascade and ribosome biogenesis in eukaryotes. Western blot results indicated that compared to the healthy control group, the expression of complement C1q subcomponent subunit C (C1QC), kininogen-1 (KNG1), complement C1s subcomponent (C1S), and C4b-binding protein alpha chain (C4BPA) was increased in the KD group (P<0.05). Compared to the KD group, the expression of KNG1, C1S, C1QC, and C4BPA was decreased in the BBR treatment group (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The complement and coagulation cascade may be involved in the regulation of BBR treatment for coronary injury in KD, and C1QC, KNG1, C1S, and C4BPA may serve as biomarkers for this treatment.",

The ligand and complex were characterized by elemental analysis, FTIR and NMR (1H and 13C) spectroscopy, and conductivity measurements. The cytotoxic effect was analyzed by using the CCK-8 viability assay in cancer MDA-MB-231 VIM RFP and non-cancer MCF-10A cell lines.

The co-treatment group significantly increased the number of cells in G2 phase, indicating the growth arrest of cancer cells. Moreover, the combination group showed induction of both intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways. There was also a study on the effect of the combination treatment on receptor-interacting serine/threonine-protein kinase 3 (RIPK3) and mixed lineage kinase domain-like pseudokinase (MLKL) as biomarkers of necroptosis.

The regulation of tumor cell homeostasis and metabolism is greatly influenced by Hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α). This research aims to elucidate whether BBR inhibits the progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) by modulating HIF-1α expression. Simulating the tumor hypoxic microenvironment in vitro by CoCl2 addition to induce the HIF-1α expression. The optimal concentration of BBR and CoCl2 were screened by CCK-8 assay. Clone formation, wound healing, EDU staining, Transwell assay and flow cytometry evaluated the malignant biological behavior of HepG2 cells. RT-qPCR and Western blot assessed HIF-1α and glycolysis-related protein levels. Finally, the influence of BBR in vivo was investigated by a xenograft tumor model in nude mice. After exposure to 100μmol/L BBR, the proliferation, migration and invasion of HepG2 cells were reduced, along with apoptosis was increased, while the levels of glycolysis-related proteins were decreased (P<0.05). 100 μmol/L CoCl2 treatment increased the level of HIF-1α, promoted the malignant progression of HCC and attenuated the anti-tumor effect of BBR. Additionally, BBR inhibited tumor growth in nude mice. In conclusion, BBR exerts antitumor effects through upregulating HIF-1α and could be used as a therapeutic agent for HCC.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND AIM: Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is a complex neurological disorder in individuals with liver diseases, necessitating effective neuroprotective interventions to alleviate its adverse outcomes. Berberine (BBR), a natural compound with well-established anti-fibrotic and neuroprotective properties, has not been extensively studied in the context of glial activation under hyperammonaemic conditions. This study evaluates the neuroprotective potential of BBR in a thioacetamide (TAA)-induced HE rat model, focusing on its effects on glial activation and NLRP3 inflammasome signalling. METHODS: Neurological impairments were assessed using open field tests and sensory analysis. Western blotting was performed to evaluate the expression of glial and neuronal markers, tight junction proteins and NLRP3 inflammasome components in the cortex and hippocampus. Histopathological and molecular changes were further examined using H&E, immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence staining. KEY RESULTS: BBR treatment significantly improved behavioural abnormalities and reduced systemic ammonia levels in TAA-exposed rats. It restored blood-brain barrier integrity, as evidenced by reduced tight junction protein degradation. BBR inhibited the expression of NLRP3 inflammasome markers, including caspase-1, IL-1β, ASC, and NF-κB, while reducing glial cell activation (IBA-1 and GFAP). Notably, BBR diminished NLRP3 expression in glial cells, indicating its potent anti-inflammatory effects. Additionally, BBR preserved neuronal integrity, as demonstrated by the maintained expression of MAP-2 and NeuN and reduced cleaved Gasdermin D levels. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that BBR alleviates behavioural and molecular abnormalities in HE through NLRP3 inflammasome inhibition, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic agent for managing HE.",

      "abstract": "UNLABELLED: Globally, there is an increase in the prevalence of metabolic illnesses, including diabetes mellitus. However, current therapies for diabetes and other metabolic illnesses are not well understood. Pharmacological treatment of type 2 diabetes is challenging, moreover, the majority of antidiabetic medications are incompatible with individuals who have cardiac disease, renal illness, or liver damage. Despite the ongoing development of innovative medicines, the quest for an optimal treatment that serves both as a hypoglycaemic agent and mitigates diabetes-related problems remains unattained. Recent research demonstrates that berberine has significant promise in the treatment of diabetes. Berberine influences glucose metabolism by enhancing insulin secretion, promoting glycolysis, decreasing adipogenesis, disrupting the function of the mitochondria, stimulating the 5' adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathway, thereby augmenting glucokinase activity. In this study, we virtually designed and synthesized 5 berberine derivatives (data not yet published) to study their impact on the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathway through molecular docking and dynamic simulation study. Activation of AMPK plays an important role by enhancing glucose uptake in cells. Berberine and its derivatives showed potential for allosteric activation of the AMPK pathway. The allosteric activation of AMPK α- & β-subunit involves complex interactions with standard activators like A-769662. Berberine and its derivatives showed potential binding affinity at the allosteric site of AMPK α- & β-subunit, forming similar interactions to A-769662. Molecular dynamic simulations indicated stability of these complexes. However, interactions of these derivatives with the AMPK γ-subunit were less stable, suggesting limited potential for allosteric activation at this site. Further studies are required to assess the long-term stability and efficacy of berberine and its derivatives as allosteric AMPK activators. Additionally, ADMET predictions suggest these derivatives to be safe, warranting further experimental and preclinical investigations as potential antidiabetic agents.

NSCLC cells (A549 and H1299) were treated with BBR. CCK8 assay, colony formation assay, flow cytometry, TUNEL staining and transwell assay were used to examine cell proliferation, apoptosis and invasion. The levels of spindle pole body component 25 (SPC25) and NDC80 kinetochore complex component (NUF2) were detected by qRT-PCR or western blot. The interaction between SPC25 and NUF2 was confirmed by Co-IP assay and FISH assay. Xenograft tumors were constructed to assess the anti-tumor role of BBR in vivo. BBR inhibited NSCLC cell growth, invasion and glycolysis. SPC25 was upregulated in NSCLC tissues, and BBR could reduce SPC25 expression in NSCLC cells. SPC25 knockdown repressed NSCLC cell growth, invasion and glycolysis, and its overexpression also reversed the anti-tumor effect of BBR. SPC25 could interact with NUF2, and NUF2 overexpression abolished the inhibitory effect of SPC25 knockdown or BBR on NSCLC cell behaviors. In animal experiments, BBR could suppress NSCLC tumor growth by inhibiting SPC25/NUF2 axis in vivo. BBR mainly played an anti-NSCLC role by targeting SPC25/NUF2 axis, which provided a new idea for NSCLC treatment."

Ber@MVs-CA demonstrates resistance to gastric acid and controlled drug release in the colonic pH environment, while actively targeting sites of ulcerative colitis injury. pH-responsive release of Ber in Ber@MVs-CA was confirmed through in vitro release experiments. The results indicated a total of 19.35 ± 1.61 % of Ber was cumulatively released from Ber@MVs-CA in SGF and SIF at 4 h, and approximately 87.14 ± 2.33 % release in simulated colonic fluid (pH 7.4) after 24 h. The targeting ability of Ber@MVs-CA was confirmed using laser confocal microscopy (CLSM), Transwell™ system, and in vivo imaging. Results demonstrated effective targeting of inflammatory macrophages and sustained retention in the colon. In vitro and in vivo (mice) assessments via immunofluorescence, ELISA kit, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) assays demonstrated that Ber@MVs-CA effectively attenuated inflammatory responses, modulated macrophage polarization, and inhibited oxidative stress. Additionally, we evaluated the therapeutic efficacy of Ber@MVs-CA in a Clostridium perfringens-induced enteritis model in chickens, demonstrating its effectiveness in alleviating enteritis. Consequently, Ber@MVs-CA exhibits great potential as an oral nano-formulation for the treatment of enteritis.

Both in vitro and in vivo experiments indicated that the combined treatment of BER-MPDA with near-infrared laser irradiation resulted in superior tumor inhibition compared to monotherapy.

Berberine (BBR), a natural alkaloid, has demonstrated its ability to promote the delayed healing of skin wounds. However, the impact of BBR on AGEs-induced ferroptosis in skin cells and the underlying molecular mechanisms remains unexplored. This study investigated the involvement of ferroptosis in AGEs-induced keratinocyte death, and the impact of BBR on ferroptosis in a db/db mouse model with long-term hyperglycemia was elucidated. A remarkable reduction in cell viability was observed along with increased malondialdehyde (MDA) production in AGEs-induced HaCaT cells. Intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and iron levels were elevated in cells exposed to AGEs. Meanwhile, the protein expression of glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) and ferritin light chain (FTL) was significantly decreased in AGEs-treated cells. However, pretreatment with BBR markedly protected cell viability and inhibited MDA levels, attenuating the intracellular ROS and iron levels and increased expression of GPX4 and FTL in vitro. Significantly diminished antiferroptotic effects of BBR on AGEs-treated keratinocytes were observed upon the knockdown of the nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (NRF2) gene. In vivo, GPX4, FTL, and FTH expression in the epidermis of diabetic mice was significantly reduced, accompanied by enhanced lipid peroxidation. Treatment with BBR effectively rescued lipid peroxidation accumulation and upregulated GPX4, FTL, FTH, and NRF2 levels in diabetic skin. Collectively, the findings indicate that ferroptosis may play a significant role in AGEs-induced keratinocyte death. BBR protects diabetic keratinocytes against ferroptosis, partly by activating NRF2.",

      "abstract": "AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is the master regulator of cellular energy which gets activated during energy stress and restores tissue homeostasis. AMPK is widely expressed in the pancreas and is involved in protein synthesis. In cerulein-induced acute pancreatitis (AP), diminished AMPK activity in the pancreatic tissue may be associated with pancreatic inflammation and oxidative stress. Our results demonstrated that berberine (BR) treatment produced significant decrease in plasma amylase and lipase levels and improved histopathological features in AP mice model. Myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity indicated that BR suppressed the infiltration of neutrophils in pancreas. BR treatment markedly decreased the levels of proinflammatory cytokines including interleukins (IL)-6, IL-1β, and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) via inhibition of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase 2 (NOX2) expression. In addition, BR activates the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) signaling and inhibits cerulein-induced oxidative-nitrosative stress. Mechanistically, we found inhibition of AMPK activity in cerulein-induced AP, while BR-treated animals showed marked increase in the AMPK expression. Together, our study indicated that BR-mediated AMPK activation in pancreatic tissues demonstrated attenuation of cerulein-induced oxidative stress and inflammation. Based on our observations, further exploration of this promising natural product against AP and associated complications may lead to promising therapeutic options.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) influenced by multiple factors. Berberine, an isoquinoline alkaloid derived from the root and bark of Coptis chinensis Franch., has shown promise in managing UC, but its underlying mechanisms remain unclear. METHODS: To elucidate the relationship between berberine, ulcerative colitis (UC), and the organism's metabolome, we established a dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced UC model in rats. Colonic tissue was collected for histopathological examination, while plasma samples were analyzed using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) with dynamic Multiple Reaction Monitoring (dMRM). This approach, characterized by its short analysis time of 20 min per sample, excellent reproducibility, and straightforward data processing, allowed for the comprehensive detection of a wide array of metabolites, including amino acids, lipids, and organic acids, many of which are implicated in the pathophysiology of UC. RESULTS: Our results showed that berberine modulated the metabolic disturbances of 33 compounds in the plasma of UC rats, primarily including amino acids, pyrimidines, organic phosphoric acids, fatty acyls, and organonitrogen compounds. These altered metabolites were associated with various pathways, such as amino acid metabolism, glutathione metabolism, nicotinate and nicotinamide metabolism, taurine and hypotaurine metabolism, pyrimidine metabolism, glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism, and the citrate cycle (TCA cycle). Notably, 3-hydroxyproline, homocysteic acid, L-threonine, L-lysine, carbamoyl phosphate, O-phosphoethanolamine, taurine, leucine, and phosphorylcholine exhibited significant differences between the Treatment and Model groups, with levels reverting to those of the Control group (p < 0.001). These findings suggested that these compounds may serve as potential plasma biomarkers for UC. CONCLUSION: This study provided valuable insights into the mechanism by which berberine exerted its therapeutic effects on UC through metabolomics. Our results highlighted berberine's potential to modulate key metabolic pathways and restore the levels of several metabolites, suggesting its utility as a therapeutic agent for UC. These findings underscored the importance of metabolomics in understanding the pathophysiology and treatment of UC."

      "abstract": "Promoting tumor cell senescence arrests the cell cycle of tumor cells and activates the immune system to eliminate these senescent cells, thereby suppressing tumor growth. Nevertheless, PD-L1 positive senescent tumor cells resist immune clearance and possess the ability to secret various cytokines and inflammatory factors that stimulate the growth of tumor cells. Consequently, drugs capable of both triggering senescence in tumor cells and concurrently diminishing the expression of PD-L1 to counteract immune evasion are urgently needed. Here, a berberine derivative B68 is developed, which specifically induces tumor cell senescence by targeting BMI1. B68 also involves the degradation of PD-L1 by targeting CSN5, thereby disrupting the immunosuppressive PD-1/PD-L1 interaction and enabling rapid clearance of senescent tumor cells. This approach simultaneously inhibits tumor progression and activates T cell immunity, as evidenced by the robust antitumor response following B68-induced immunization of senescent cancer cells. Moreover, the synergistic effect of B68 with anti-CTLA4 therapy further enhances antitumor immunity, and its ability to induce senescence in cancer cells triggers a strong protective response by dendritic and CD8+ T cells. These findings provide a scientific basis for developing a new tumor treatment strategy based on senescence induction and lay the foundation for further preclinical research.",

      "abstract": "Pyroptosis is a programmed cell death (PCD) mainly mediated by the Gasdermin family of proteins, among which Gasdermin E (GSDME) is considered a tumor suppressor gene. GSDME can recruit immune cells to the tumor microenvironment (TME) and promote their effects. Activating and enhancing adaptive immunity through GSDME is a potential solution for anti-tumor therapy. Here we reported that berberine (BBR), a small molecule from traditional Chinese medicine, as a GSDME activator, induced caspase-3 (C-3)/GSDME pathway-mediated pyroptosis through the mitochondrial pathway, improved the immunosuppressive state of the tumor microenvironment, and thus promoted anti-tumor immunity. We determined the induction of pyroptosis of 4 T1 cells by BBR through various experiments, and investigated the immune activation effect of BBR by co-culture in vitro, which induced DCs maturation and macrophage polarization. Zebrafish embryo toxicity experiments were used to evaluate the in vivo safety of berberine. Furthermore, the in vivo antitumor and immune activation effects of BBR were investigated using 4 T1 orthotopic model mice, and the results showed that BBR could eliminate orthotopic tumor cells by activating local and systemic immunity. Moreover, we observed that BBR significantly inhibited breast cancer lung metastasis. In summary, our results showd the role of BBR as a GSDME activator stimulated both local and systemic antitumor immune responses by inducing pyroptosis, effectively preventing tumor development and metastasis.",

      "abstract": "Atherosclerosis (AS) and Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) are chronic metabolic disorders with high prevalence and significant health impacts. Both conditions share common pathophysiological pathways including abnormal lipid metabolism and inflammation. Berberine (BBR), an isoquinoline alkaloid, is known for its beneficial effects on various metabolic and cardiovascular disorders. This study investigates BBR's impact on AS and NAFLD through bioinformatics analysis and experimental models. This study utilized various bioinformatics methods, including transcriptome analysis, weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA), machine learning, and molecular docking, to identify key genes and pathways involved in AS and NAFLD. Subsequently an animal model of AS combined with NAFLD was established using ApoE-/- mice fed a high-fat diet. The efficacy and mechanism of action of BBR were verified using methods such as hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining, Oil Red O staining, and real-time quantitative PCR (RTqPCR). Through transcriptome analysis, WGCNA, and machine learning, this study identified 48 key genes involved in both AS and NAFLD. Function analysis revealed that the implicated genes were significantly involved in pathways like cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, chemokine signaling, and IL-17 signaling pathway, suggesting their role in inflammation and immune responses. Single cell validation identified six key genes: dual specificity phosphatase 6 (DUSP6), chemokine ligand 3 (CCL3), complement component 5a receptor 1 (C5AR1), formyl peptide receptor 1 (FPR1), myeloid nuclear differentiation antigen (MNDA), and proviral integration site of murine 2(PIM2). Finally, molecular docking and animal experiments showed that BBR significantly reduced lipid deposits and inflammatory markers in liver and aortic tissues. In conclusion, BBR can improve AS combined with NAFLD by regulating genes like MNDA, PIM2, DUSP6, CCL3, C5AR1, and FPR1, with the mechanism related to inflammation control. The findings suggest potential clinical benefits of BBR in reducing the progression of both AS and NAFLD, warranting further investigation.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Esophageal achalasia, a primary disorder impacting the lower esophageal sphincter (LES), presents symptoms such as dysphagia, regurgitation, chest pain, and weight loss. Traditional treatments, including calcium channel blockers and nitrates, offer limited relief, prompting exploration into alternative therapies. This study examines the efficacy of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), focusing on Coptis chinensis (C. chinensis) and its principal component, berberine, for modulating LES relaxation, offering a new perspective on treatment possibilities. METHODS: This research evaluated the impact of C. chinensis extract and berberine on the relaxation of LES contraction pre-induced by carbachol, observing the effects across different concentrations. We employed a series of inhibitors, including tetrodotoxin, ω-conotoxin GVIA, rolipram, vardenafil, KT5823, KT5720, NG-nitro-L-arginine, tetraethylammonium (TEA), apamine, iberiotoxin, and glibenclamide, to investigate the underlying mechanisms of berberine-induced LES relaxation. RESULTS: Both C. chinensis extract and berberine induced significant, concentration-dependent relaxation of the LES. The relaxation effect of berberine was significantly reduced by TEA, indicating the involvement of potassium channels in this process. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that C. chinensis and berberine significantly promote LES relaxation, primarily through potassium channel activation. These findings provide a foundation for further investigation of these compounds' potential therapeutic applications in esophageal motility disorders, such as achalasia.",

      "abstract": "Berberine (BBR), an isoquinoline alkaloid found in medicinal plants such as Coptidis rhizoma, Berberis sp., and Hydrastis canadensis, is a distinctive compound known for its dual ability to exhibit broad-spectrum antifungal activity while offering beneficial effects to the host. These attributes make it a highly valuable candidate for antifungal therapy and as an antibiotic adjuvant. This review provides a comprehensive evaluation of BBR's antifungal properties, focusing on its in vitro and in vivo activity, underlying mechanisms, and its influence on fungal pathogenicity, including virulence, biofilm formation, and resistance. Additionally, the antifungal potential of BBR extracts, derivatives, and nanoformulations is examined in detail. BBR demonstrates fungicidal effects through multiple mechanisms. It targets critical fungal components such as mitochondria, cell membranes, and cell walls, while also inhibiting enzymatic activity and transcription processes. Furthermore, it suppresses the expression of virulence factors, effectively diminishing fungal pathogenicity. Beyond its direct antifungal activity, BBR exerts beneficial effects on the host by modulating gut microbiota, thereby bolstering host defenses against fungal infections and reducing potential adverse effects. BBR's interaction with conventional antifungal drugs presents a unique complexity, particularly in the context of resistance mechanisms. When used in combination therapies, conventional antifungal drugs enhance the intracellular accumulation of BBR, thereby amplifying its antifungal potency as the primary active agent. These synergistic effects position BBR as a promising candidate for combination strategies, especially in addressing drug-resistant fungal infections and persistent biofilms. As antifungal resistance and biofilm-associated infections continue to rise, the multifaceted properties of BBR and its advanced formulations highlight their significant therapeutic potential. However, the scarcity of robust in vivo and clinical studies limits a full understanding of its efficacy and safety profile. To bridge this gap, future investigations should prioritize well-designed in vivo and clinical trials to thoroughly evaluate the therapeutic effectiveness and safety of BBR in diverse clinical settings. This approach could pave the way for its broader application in combating fungal infections.",

N-ethyl-maleimide sensitive factor (NSF) is considered as a major ATPase to reactivate soluble NSF attachment protein receptors (SNAREs), which directly mediate autophagosome-lysosome fusion. However, NSF was dramatically inactivated by ischemia to hamper membrane-membrane fusion, leading to autophagic/lysosomal dysfunction in neurons. This study was to investigate whether BBR-ameliorated autophagic flux was exerted by reinforcing NSF activity, which subsequently boosted autophagosome-lysosome fusion in ischemic neurons. Rat model of ischemic stroke and neuronal ischemia model of HT22 cells were prepared by middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) and oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD), respectively. BBR was intraperitoneally administrated with 100 mg/Kg/d for 3 days before MCAO and was treated with 90 μM in HT22 neurons for 12 h, respectively. The results illustrated that NSF activity was markedly reinforced to facilitate autophagosome-lysosome fusion in penumbral cells and OGD HT22 neurons by BBR treatment. Consequently, the ischemia-created autophagic/lysosomal dysfunction was greatly restored to alleviate ischemic injury. Thereafter, NSF activity in OGD HT22 neurons was altered by transfection with NSF-overexpressing lentiviruses and siRNA-mediated knockdown, respectively. The data showed that BBR-enhanced autophagic flux and it-induced neuroprotection were greatly counteracted by NSF knockdown. By contrast, NSF overexpression synergistically boosted autophagosome-lysosome fusion and further attenuated neuronal death upon BBR treatment. Therefore, our study indicates that BBR-conferred neuroprotection against ischemic stroke is induced through facilitating autophagosome-lysosome fusion, by which enhancing autophagic flux in ischemic neurons.",

Understanding the interaction between ligands and G-quadruplexes is crucial for the development of novel anticancer agents. In this study, we designed a novel platinum(II) complex (Pt1), with a berberine derivative (L) serving as a bioactive ligand. The structures of both ligand L and Pt1 were fully characterized using NMR, ESI-MS, and IR. UV-visible spectroscopy, fluorescence spectroscopy, circular dichroism spectroscopy, electrostatic surface potential, frontier molecular orbital and molecular docking experiments were employed to investigate the interaction between Pt1 and G-quadruplexes. The results suggested that Pt1 interacted favorably with G-quadruplex DNA over double-stranded DNA (DS26). Among them, Pt1 interacts with the bcl-2 G-quadruplex with a binding affinity of 17.9 μM and did not induce conformational changes in the topology of the bcl-2 G-quadruplex. Moreover, we evaluated its antiproliferative activities on tumor cells (HeLa, A549 and T24), which demonstrated that Pt1 inhibited tumor cell proliferation and induced HeLa cell apoptosis.

Treatment with Berberine (Berb) upregulated Klotho gene expression, enhancing autophagy as indicated by elevated protein levels of pS486-AMPK, pS638-ULK1, and Beclin-1, accompanied by a decrease in pS248-mTOR protein expression. Also, Berb mitigated oxidative stress by reducing elevated MDA levels and boosting SOD activity, which in turn suppressed inflammation by down-regulating HMGB1 and RAGE gene expression, as well as reducing pS536-NF-κB and IL-6 protein contents. Additionally, Berb reduced apoptosis by increasing Bcl-2 and decreasing Bax. This coordinated action preserved kidney function, evidenced by reductions in early injury markers (cystatin C, KIM-1, NGAL) and late markers (creatinine, BUN), along with attenuation of histopathological alterations. The use 3-MA, autophagy inhibitor, nullified these protective effects, highlighting Berb's role in promoting autophagy, reducing oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis, and preserving renal health in Cisp-induced AKI.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is a type of lung cancer, the incidence and mortality rate have been high, and the use of monotherapy is easy to make patients develop tolerance. Atmospheric pressure plasma (APP) is an emerging technology for killing cancer cells in recent years, and combination of berberine (BBR) mechanism has not been fully elucidated for NSCLC. The article's primary goal is to investigate the effect of combination on NSCLC and its associated characterization. METHODS AND RESULTS: Antiproliferative effects were detected by cell viability assay and colony formation, and flow cytometry analysis of apoptosis and cycling showed that the combination synergistically induced apoptosis. Then, extracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS)levels and DCFH-DA-based kits examined intracellular ROS levels, and their effects on mitochondrial membrane potential were measured. Study reveals that co-induced apoptosis is associated with ROS accumulation. Subsequently, Western blotting (WB) detected the expression of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), and the important signaling pathway proteins Ras/ERK and AKT/mTOR. Results showed that it could downregulation of EGFR protein expression and inhibit of activation of ERK/AKT signaling pathways. Simultaneous wound healing assay and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) marker detection were performed for the assessment of migration and EMT ability of NSCLC cells. Combination therapy inhibited migration and EMT of NSCLC cells. CONCLUSION: The results of this study show that the combination can synergistically induce apoptosis of NSCLC by regulating ROS production. EGFR downregulation and AKT/ERK signaling pathway inhibition are linked to the synergistic effect.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Despite the availability of multiple therapies for Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), challenges remain due to side effects and efficacy limitations. Berberine (BBR) has shown broad anti-diabetic effects, prompting a systematic assessment of its efficacy and safety through a meta-analysis. METHODS: A comprehensive search was conducted across eight database and search engines from inception until 06/09/2024. Only randomized controlled trials (RCTs) meeting inclusion criteria were analyzed. The Cochrane risk of bias assessment tool and Jadad scale were used to evaluate study quality. Meta-analysis was performed using RevMan v5.3 and Stata/SE v15.1. RESULTS: Fifty studies involving 4,150 participants were included. BBR alone significantly reduced fasting plasma glucose (FPG) (MD = -0.59 mmol/L, p = 0.048), 2-h postprandial blood glucose (2hPBG) (MD = -1.57 mmol/L, p < 0.01), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) (MD = -0.30 mmol/L, p < 0.01), total cholesterol (TC) (MD = -0.30 mmol/L, p = 0.034), and triglycerides (TG) (MD = -0.35 mmol/L, p < 0.01). When combined with hypoglycemic drugs, BBR significantly improved FPG (MD = -0.99 mmol/L, p < 0.01), 2hPBG (MD = -1.07 mmol/L, p < 0.01), glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) (MD = -0.69%, p < 0.01), and other metabolic markers, including fasting insulin (Fins), homeostasis model assessment index for assessing insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), lipid profiles and inflammatory markers. The most common BBR dosage was 0.9-1.5 g/d, with treatment cycles typically lasting 1-3 months. CONCLUSION: Current evidence suggests that BBR alone or in combination has significant potential for treating type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Future research should encompass a broader scope, including not just the beneficial effects of BBR in head-to-head studies, but more crucially, delving into its mechanisms of action with hypoglycemic drugs to optimize T2DM treatment strategies."

Berberine (BBR) from Coptidis Rhizoma has potent hypoglycemic effects, however, the specific proteins targeted by berberine that contribute to its hypoglycemic action remain to be elucidated. In this work, TIGAR (TP53-induced glycolysis and apoptosis regulator) was identified as a direct target protein for berberine using activity-based protein profiling (ABPP) and other chemical proteomics techniques with active photoaffinity probes as chemical tools. In addition, the study revealed that berberine-targeted TIGAR attenuated the conversion of fructose-2, 6-bisphosphate to fructose-6-phosphate. This study demonstrated an innovative mechanism by which berberine directly targets TIGAR and its hypoglycemic effects. Therefore, TIGAR emerges as a novel target for the treatment of diabetes mellitus, with TIGAR inhibitors offering a new and promising therapeutic strategy for managing the disease.",

      "abstract": "Application of liposomes is a critical strategy in drug delivery and increase cellular uptake of drugs having low water solubility. Berberine (BBR) is a bioactive compound found in several plants, including Goldenseal, Barberry, and Oregon grape. It has garnered attention for its various health benefits, particularly in metabolic health and antimicrobial activity. However, one of the challenges associated with BBR is its water solubility. Moreover, BBR has photosensitizing potential via absorbance of light and generation of free radicals. Hence, to improve water solubility and bioavailability, one of the important strategies employed is using lipid-based carriers to enhance solubility. In this study we employed liposomes to deliver BBR in A549 lung cancer spheroid cells to enhance photodynamic therapy efficacies. Results from the EDS and UV-Vis spectroscopy revealed that the BBR had been loaded onto liposomes, with three peaks appearing between 250 and 450 nm. Morphology of Lipo@BBR nanocomplex was in wavy crest shape and the size was 56.99 ± 3.74 nm in SEM and TEM analysis, respectively. FTIR data illustrated that Lipo@BBR has four significant peaks at 1250, 1459, 1736, and 2907 cm-1. DLS data showed that Lipo@BBR has a negative surface charge with a -10.7 Zeta Potential (mV). Additionally, based on Zetasizer measurements, the size of Lipo@BBR complex was 82.7 ± 6.5. Cytotoxicity assay investigation with MTT assay presented that IC50 of Lipo@BBR in PDT was 10 ± 0.5 μg/mL that led to a volume reduction of the A549 spheroids after five sessions of PDT fractionation (total light dose was set at 25 J/cm2). qPCR and immunofluorescence results demonstrated that Lipo@BBR increases the BAX/BCL2 ratio in A549 spheroid cells, hence improving PDT efficiency. In conclusion, our results illustrated that safe dose of Lipo@BBR (10 ± 0.5 μg/mL) in PDT fractionation protocol can be one of the strategies to suppress the tumor volume and cell death proliferation. Authors recommend using Lipo@BBR nanocomplex in PDT fractionation as well as more in vivo investigation is warranted."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), a persistent gastrointestinal disease, is featured with impaired gut immunity. Previous studies have demonstrated that tuft cells can regulate the intestinal type 2 immune response by activating downstream ILC2 and Th2 cells and repair gut barrier upon invasion of parasitic helminths, bacteria, protozoans, and enteritis through different chemo-sensing receptors, such as bitter taste receptors. Berberine is a widely used in the treatment of diarrhea in clinic, however the mechanism underlying this effect is not clear. In this study, we aim to explore the relationship between berberine and tuft cells in dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) -induced colitis. RESULTS: Our data showed that berberine significantly ameliorated DSS-induced colitis and regulating type 2 innate immune lymphocytes (ILC2) and Th2 immune cells via tuft cells in the gut. Furthermore, the effect of berberine on colitis was partially abolished by U73122, a bitter taste receptor inhibitor, suggesting that bitter taste signalling pathway played an important role in the effect of berberine on relieving colitis. CONCLUSIONS: Berberine ameliorates dextran sulfate sodium -induced colitis through tuft cells and bitter taste signalling. Our study reveals the unique pharmacological mechanisms of berberine in the context of colitis, laying the foundation for further clinical applications of this compound.",

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: To explore the in vitro killing effect of water-soluble berberine and lipid-soluble niclosamide against ocular Demodex folliculorum. METHODS: Demodex with good vigor were collected from patients' eyelashes. These mites were randomly distributed into different groups with 20 mites in each group. Saline, Double Distilled Water (DDW), Polysorbate 80 (TWEEN 80), Polyethylene glycol 300 (PEG 300) and Castor Oil were used to screen solvents and cosolvents. 20 % Tea Tree Oil (TTO) and Anhydrous Ethanol (EtOH) were used as positive controls. 0.2 % Berberine, 0.25 % Niclosamide and 0.5 % Niclosamide, were designated as experimental groups. Following treatment, the analysis of Kaplan-Meier survival curves and survival time of mites and safety of drugs were then performed. RESULTS: The survival of Demodex in vitro in Saline and DDW, was not significant different. Therefore, DDW, which was more conducive to the dissolution of berberine, was chosen as the solvent for berberine. 0.2 % Berberine significantly inhibited the survival distribution and survival time (P < 0.001) of Demodex in vitro compared with the DDW group. Through the evaluation of several cosolvents, PEG300 had milder effects on Demodex. Hence, the proportion of PEG300 in the niclosamide solvent group was increased to reduce the irritability of the vehicle. Furthermore, niclosamide could significantly inhibit the survival of Demodex compared with the vehicle group, and the effect of 0.5 % Niclosamide was more obvious (P < 0.001), and was better than 20 %TTO (P < 0.001). In addition, after niclosamide administration, Demodex bodies exhibited gradual distortion along with increased transparency and the presence of blurred dark particles compared to those in the vehicle group. Moreover, both drugs showed good subjective tolerability and safety in a mouse model. CONCLUSION: 0.2 % berberine and 0.5 % niclosamide effectively inhibited Demodex survival in vitro, with 0.5 % niclosamide superior to 20 % TTO. These two drugs, with anti-Demodex, anti-bacterial, and anti-inflammatory properties, may offer alternative treatment for Demodex blepharitis.",

Traditional Chinese Medicine offers complementary and integrative approaches in the management of rheumatoid arthritis, potentially providing additional options that may help address treatment challenges and enhance overall patient care. This paper explores the mechanism of action of berberine from the perspective of cellular exosomes by mediating exosomal contents and thus treating RA. Methods: With the help of flow cytometry and confocal laser scanning microscope, it was determined that berberine promotes apoptosis in RA-FLS cells, and then lipid metabolomics technology was applied to screen and characterize the exosomes of RA-FLS cells to identify lipid core biomarkers closely related to RA, which were then projected into various databases for comprehensive analysis. Results: The data analysis showed that berberine could call back 11 lipid core biomarkers closely associated with RA, and interactive visualization of the database revealed that these markers were mainly focused on lipid metabolism aspects such as fatty acid elongation, degradation, and biosynthesis, as well as the biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids or PPARA activation of gene expression, PPARα's role in lipid metabolism regulation, glycerophospholipid metabolism, mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation disorders, and organelle biogenesis and maintenance. Conclusions: Berberine exerts its therapeutic effect on RA by mediating exosomal contents and thus regulating multiple lipid-related biological pathways, affecting the PPARγ-NF-κB complex binding rate, CREB and EGR-1 expression, cellular phagocytosis, and other aspects needed to inhibit proliferation and inflammatory responses in RA-FLS. This study offers a research foundation for exploring the mechanism of action of berberine in the treatment of RA."

The liposomes were prepared by ethanol-injection method and optimized following a 32 full-factorial design. Size, morphology, zeta potential, ex-vivo permeation, and in-vitro release were estimated. The surface of optimized liposome was modified with ascorbic acid. The size of surface-modified liposomes was bigger (191.4 nm) than the unmodified liposomes (171 nm). Surface-modified liposomes were embedded in in-situ gel using poloxamer and Carbopol 934P. Liposomal in-situ gel showed higher permeation (71.94%) in contrast to the plain gel (46.64%). In-vivo pharmacokinetic examination of payload from liposomal in-situ gel displayed higher concentration in brain (Cmax of 93.50 ng/mL). The liposomal in-situ nasal gel had a higher drug targeting efficiency (138.43%) and a higher drug targeting potential (27.77%) confirming improved brain targeting. In male Wistar rats, the pharmacodynamic parameters (path length and escape latency) were evaluated with trimethyl tin-induced neurodegeneration. Animals treated with BER-loaded in-situ gel significantly decreased escape latency and path length in comparison to the control group. Histopathological assessment showed that the formulated gel was safe for intranasal administration. The developed formulation has the potential to effectively enhance the efficacy of BER in Alzheimer's disease management."

Previous studies have demonstrated the beneficial therapeutic effect of berberine (BBR) on SCM; however, the underlying mechanisms of action remain unclear. The objective of this is to elucidate how BBR alleviates SCM. METHODS: Septic cardiomyopathy rat model was established by performing cecal ligation and puncture (CLP), while a cardiomyocyte injury model was provoked in H9C2 cells using lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Cardiac function was assessed through echocardiography, and myocardial histopathology was examined with hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining. Cardiomyocyte viability was determined through Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK8) assay, and measurement of ATP levels was done with an ATP assay kit. Mitochondrial ultrastructure was observed using transmission electron microscopy. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Western blotting were employed to analyze the expression of Notch1 signaling pathway components and downstream molecules in myocardial tissues and cells. RESULT: In vivo, BBR markedly improved symptoms and cardiac function in SCM rats, leading to enhanced ATP content, and ameliorated mitochondrial structure. Additionally, BBR increased Notch1 protein expression in myocardial tissue of the rats. In vitro, BBR elevated the survival rates of H9C2 cell, improved mitochondrial morphology, and raised ATP levels. The mRNA expression of Notch1, Hes1, and Hes2, and Notch1 protein expression was upregulated by BBR. While these effects were reversed upon inhibiting the Notch1 signaling pathway. CONCLUSION: BBR improves septic cardiomyopathy by modulating Notch1 signaling to protect myocardial mitochondria."

      "abstract": "Lung cancer is the most fatal cancer worldwide. The etiology of lung cancer has yet to be fully characterized. Smoking and air pollution are several risk factors for lung cancer. Berberine, an isoquinoline alkaloid, is an antihyperglycemic, antidepressant, antioxidative, anti-inflammatory, and anticancer compound. Evidence substantiates that berberine has antitumor effects, exerting its effects by targeting a variety of cellular and molecular processes, such as apoptosis, autophagy, cell cycle arrest, migration, and metastasis. Although the beneficial effects of berberine have been reported, some limitations including low bioavailability and absorption as well as poor aqueous solubility have hindered its clinical application. Nanotechnology and nanodelivery bioformulation approaches may bypass these limitations. In addition, the combination of berberine with other therapies has been shown to result in greater treatment efficacy for lung cancer. Herein, we summarize cellular and molecular pathways that are affected by berberine, its clinical efficacy upon various combinations, and the potential for nanotechnology in lung cancer therapy."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a chronic condition of the digestive tract with limited therapeutic options. Bitter taste receptors (TAS2Rs) and transient receptor potential vanilloid-1 (TRPV1) are implicated in modulating inflammatory responses. Berberine (BBR) and evodiamine (EVO) are known to activate TAS2Rs and TRPV1, respectively. However, whether BBR and EVO can ameliorate GERD by targeting TAS2Rs and TRPV1 remains uncertain. PURPOSE: This study aims to determine whether BBR and EVO mitigate esophageal injury by targeting TAS2R38 and TRPV1 and to elucidate their underlying molecular mechanisms. METHODS: A GERD rat model was developed using esophagogastric anastomosis, while GERD in human esophageal epithelial cells (HEECs) was induced via bile acid (BA) exposure. Esophageal pathology was analyzed through hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). mRNA and protein levels were measured via qRT-PCR, immunofluorescence, immunohistochemistry and Western blot analysis. Small interfering RNA was used to silence TAS2R38 and TRPV1 in HEECs. The activation of TAS2R38 and TRPV1 by BBR and EVO was assessed through Ca2+ mobilization assays. Finally, in vivo validation was conducted using U73122 to inhibit TAS2Rs and resiniferatoxin (RTX) to ablate TRPV1. RESULTS: BBR and EVO treatments significantly improved esophageal pathology in GERD rats and reduced BA-induced inflammation in HEECs. Additionally, BBR and EVO suppressed proinflammatory factors expression, upregulated barrier proteins such as E-cadherin and claudin-1, and inhibited the phosphorylation of p65, JNK, and ERK in the MAPK/NF-κB signaling pathways in both in vivo and in vitro models. Furthermore, BBR and EVO, whether individually or in combination, reduced dilated intercellular spaces (DIS), increased desmosome numbers, and modulated macrophage polarization in GERD rats. Knockdown of TAS2R38 and TRPV1 in HEECs notably diminished the stimulatory effects of BBR and EVO. Moreover, the regulation of barrier function and MAPK/NF-κB pathway proteins by BBR and EVO in BA-induced HEECs was abrogated upon TAS2R38 and TRPV1 knockdown. Similarly, U73122 and RTX reversed the effects of BBR and EVO on macrophage polarization and MAPK/NF-κB signaling pathways in vivo. CONCLUSION: We firstly demonstrate that BBR and EVO alleviate GERD, with enhanced synergistic efficacy observed when used in combination. Mechanistically, BBR and EVO activate the TAS2R38 and TRPV1, respectively, leading to downregulation of phosphorylation in MAPK/NF-κB signaling pathways and modulation of macrophage polarization. These findings offer a novel foundation for the clinical application of BBR and EVO in GERD treatment.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Hepatic metastasis is the primary cause of colorectal cancer (CRC)-induced death. Our previous results showed the anti-metastatic effects of Coptidis rhizoma using in vitro model. AIM: The present study aimed to investigate whether berberine, the main active compound of C. rhizoma, inhibits colon-liver metastasis in an animal model, and to elucidate the underlying mechanisms. METHODS: Murine colon carcinoma (CT26) tumor tissue was implanted into the cecum of balb/c mice with/without oral administration of berberine (100 mg/kg) for 21 days, after which liver metastasis was evaluated. In addition, the pharmacological actions of berberine were explored using 5-fluorouracil-resistant human colon cancer cells (HCT116/R). RESULT: The administration of berberine significantly decreased the number of tumor nodules in the liver, while significant activation of E-cadherin (an epithelial marker), and suppression of vimentin, Snail and TGF-β (mesenchymal markers) were observed in primary colon tumor tissues. Berberine treatment also notably lowered the levels of inflammatory cytokines (TGF-β, TNF- α, IL-6 and IL-1β) in the blood. In HCT116/R cells, berberine significantly inhibited migration and invasion and modulated the expression of TGF-β and representative molecules related to its pathway. The results obtained with a TGF-β inhibitor (SB431542) and a TGF-β siRNA, strongly suggest that the mechanism of action of berberine is linked to TGF-β signaling. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, berberine evidently possess an anti-colon-liver metastatic effect, and its underlying mechanisms involve the inhibition of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) through the TGF-β signaling pathway. Thus, we cautiously propose the pharmacological potential of berberine in drug research studies targeting hepatic metastasis from CRC.",

      "abstract": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) stands as the third most widespread cancer globally with poor prognosis. Berberine (Ber), as one herbal phytochemical, showed promise in CRC therapy, but its exact mechanism is unclear. Small molecule traditional drugs face challenges in quick metabolism and low bio-availability after systemic administration. Nanodrug deliver system, with their unique properties, has the advantages of protecting drugs, improving drug bio-availability, and reducing toxic and side effects, which exhibited huge drug delivery potential. Herein, the PEG-PLGA nanocarrier was used for encapsulated Ber according to nanoprecipitation and obtained nanomedicine, denoted as NPBer. In vitro, the flow cytometry test and CCK8 assays indicated that NPBer was more easily taken up by HCT116 CRC cells, and had stronger inhibition on cell proliferation with the increase of drug concentration. In addition, RNA-Seq was employed to explore the alterations in the transcriptomes of cancer cells subsequent to treatment with Free Ber or NPBer.The sequencing results indicate that Free Ber could activate cellular aging mechanisms, intensified the iron death pathway, optimized oxidative phosphorylation efficiency, exacerbated apoptosis, accelerated programmed cell death, and negatively modulated key signaling pathways in CRC cells including Wnt, TGF-beta, Hippo, and mTOR signaling pathways. Based on PEG-PLGA nanocarriers, NPBer can improve the in vivo delivery efficiency of Ber, thereby enhancing its antitumor efficacy in vivo, enhancing apoptosis by enhancing the mitochondrial autophagy and autophagy activities of CRC cells, negatively regulating the inflammatory mediator to regulate TRP channels, and inhibiting the activation of Notch signaling pathway. In vivo, NPBer can significantly improve its accumulation and durable drug targeting in tumor site, resulting in induce maximum cell apoptosis and effectively inhibit the proliferation of HCT116 tumor. This strategy provided a promising antitumor therapeutic strategy using Ber-based drugs."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Berberine is widely used in clinical treatment because of its wide antibacterial spectrum and low toxic side effects. However, its abuse could lead to bacterial resistance and several other adverse effects. In addition, measuring the content of berberine in environmental water samples helps to monitor its accumulation and metabolism in ecosystems. Traditional detection methods usually need to be carried out in the laboratory, involving complex processing procedures, which are not only time-consuming, but also unfavorable for rapid response and decision-making. Therefore, it is necessary to develop portable instruments to provide reasonable guidance on the addition and intake of berberine to reduce the harm caused by its abuse. RESULTS: In this work, an accurate synchronous transport signal hand-held sensing platform (STSHSP) with a low-cost, easy-to-manufacture, independent use was developed by using photoelectric conversion technology, Bluetooth technology, remote synchronous signal technology, electrical technology, and 3D printing technology. To verify the performance of STSHSP, a 5-oxo-2,3-dihydro-5H-thiazolo [3,2-a] pyridine-3,7-dicarboxylic acid (TPDCA) with ultra-high quantum yield was designed and synthesized as a probe. TPDCA exhibited bright blue fluorescence under the ultraviolet light of 365 nm which could be quenched by berberine through the inner filter effect. In the range of 0.1-80 μg/mL, the voltage displayed by the prepared STSHSP has a good linearity with the berberine concentration (R2 = 0.9997) with a detection limit of 28.32 ng/mL. The portable sensor demonstrated good stability, accuracy, and reliability in detecting actual river water, urine, traditional Chinese medicine, and its preparation samples. SIGNIFICANCE: The sensor with its compact structure, portability, and simple operation was suitable for in-situ detection with accurate, reliable, and feasible results, which is beneficial for improving drug quality and ensuring human health. Fortunately, the device could transmit the information to the control center and/or a third-party supervision institution in real-time, which could effectively eliminate the trust crisis. The sensor has broad application prospects in the field of environmental water quality detection and drug safety.",

      "abstract": "Berberine hydrochloride (BH) extracted from Coptis chinensis (CC) and Matrine (MT) separated from Sophora flavescens (SF) are alkaloids with potent anti-bacterial, anti-inflammatory, and anti-tumor effects. Motivated by the clinical practice of using CC and SF together, we aimed to demonstrate that the synergistic application of the natural compounds BH and MT could enhance therapeutic effects and minimize side effects. Two types of liposomes, liposomes containing only BH (BH-LP) and liposomes containing both BH and MT (BH-MT-LP), were successfully prepared via the reverse evaporation method. The liposome preparation process was optimized by single-factor screening and the Box-Behnken experimental design method. The results showed that the liposomes had particle sizes in the range of 222.7 to 235.4 nm, polydispersity indicated in the range of 11.8% to 23.3%, and zeta potentials in the range of -35.9 to -31.1 mv. BH-MT-LP showed superior anti-tumor activity against MDA-MB-231, HepG-2, and HGC-27 cells in vitro. The incorporation of MT effectively promoted the anti-tumor effect of BH, while the controlled release from liposomes further enhanced the therapeutic efficacy of BH. Furthermore, based on the flow cytometry results, we speculated that BH-MT-LP might promote apoptosis by blocking the G1 phase of cells and inducing cell death. In conclusion, BH-MT-LP provides evidence for the combined use of natural compounds as a stable, safe, and practical drug delivery system for the treatment of potential cancers. Meanwhile, the successful preparation for BH-MT-LP also provides a new approach to the combined use of traditional Chinese medicine ingredients.",
