      "abstract": "Irinotecan (CPT11)-induced diarrhea affects 80-90% of cancer patients due to β-glucuronidase (GUS) converting 7-ethyl-10-hydroxycamptothecin glucuronide (SN38G) to 7-ethyl-10-hydroxycamptothecin (SN38). It remains unclear whether SN38 impacts the homeostasis between gut microbiota and mucosal stem cell niche. This study explores the crosstalk between gut microbiota and intestinal stem cells (ISCs) in intestinal mucositis triggered by CPT11 chemotherapy. CPT11-treated mice exhibited significant colon shortening, inflammatory infiltration, intestinal barrier dysfunction, and ISC impairment, which correlated with gut dysbiosis, enrichment of GUS-expressing bacteria, and intraluminal SN38 accumulation. In contrast, antidiarrheal (Xianglian pill) treatment alleviated SN38-induced enterotoxicity and reduced GUS-expressing bacterial populations. Microbiome profiling of clinical patients and mucositis mice revealed a strong correlation between CPT11/SN38 enterotoxicity and GUS-expressing bacteria, particularly Lactobacillus reuteri. PLS-PM modeling further linked L. reuteri to impaired epithelial regeneration, which is validated using a 3D intestinal organoid model. L. reuteri hindered ISC differentiation into secretory lineages within the organoids. Furthermore, L. reuteri colonization in mice exacerbated mucositis and disrupted epithelial differentiation, while its elimination ameliorated colitis symptoms and preserved crypt cell stemness. These findings suggest that selectively targeting GUS-expressing bacteria, particularly L. reuteri, to protect the regenerative epithelial stem/progenitor pool may serve as an effective strategy for mitigating CPT11-induced enterotoxicity."

      "abstract": "Canine atopic dermatitis (AD) is a T-cell-driven inflammatory skin disease, characterized by an imbalance between the Th1 and Th2 immune responses. Probiotics (live bacteria) and postbiotics (inactivated, killed bacteria) have garnered attention for the management of AD in humans and dogs. Both probiotics and postbiotics possess immunomodulating properties that could be beneficial for allergic patients. This study aims to evaluate the immunomodulating effects of Tyndallized (heat-killed) postbiotics of Lactobacillus rhamnosus and Lactobacillus reuteri, which are active components of the Linkskin products (Nextmune, Palazzo Pignano, Cremona, Italy). Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from healthy dogs and incubated separately with each postbiotic. The cytokine levels in the supernatants were measured before and after 12, 24, 48, and 72 h of incubation. Both Tyndallized lactobacilli significantly increased the levels of IL-12 and IFN-γ (Th1 cytokines) and IL-10 (associated with T regulatory cells), while the levels of the Th2 cytokine IL-4 remained stable. Overall, these two Lactobacillus postbiotics stimulated canine PBMCs to produce a cytokine profile typically associated with an anti-allergic response. Further studies are needed to evaluate the benefit of these postbiotics as an adjuvant for the reactive treatment or for the prevention of relapses of allergic flares in atopic dogs."

This study was aimed at investigating the in vitro inhibitory effects of Lactobacillus reuteri (L. reuteri) strain I300 against H. pylori. The inhibitory effects of live L. reuteri I300 and its different formulations I300L, I300G, and I300T were examined on H. pylori adhesion and invasion to AGS cells. Auto-aggregation and co-aggregation assays and also scanning electron microscopy were performed, evaluating L. reuteri capacity to auto-aggregate and co-aggregate with H. pylori. RT-qPCR and ELISA were used to investigate the expression, and production level of inflammation-related cytokines TNF-α, IL-8, and IL-10. E-cadherin expression level was also measured, determining L. reuteri potential effect on AGS cells integrity. L. reuteri presented a time-dependent capacity to auto-aggregate and co-aggregate with H. pylori. Live L. reuteri and its formulations significantly reduced H. pylori adhesion and invasion of AGS cells. H. pylori treatment with L. reuteri reduced proinflammatory cytokines TNF-α and IL-8 production while increasing anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 production. L. reuteri promoted the epithelial cell-cell contact by upregulating E-cadherin expression. This study indicated L. reuteri I300 as a potential probiotic strain with co-aggregation capacity and inhibitory effects against H. pylori adhesion, invasion, and inflammation."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Wound healing is a complex physiological process essential for restoring tissue integrity following various injuries, ranging from minor, everyday incidents to post-surgical complications. Emerging studies have demonstrated that lactic acid bacteria (LAB) can offer benefits beyond gut health, extending their positive effects on skin health. This study investigated the potential of Lactobacillus reuteri NCHBL-005, a honeybee-derived probiotic strain, to enhance fibroblast-mediated wound healing. METHOD: L929 cells and mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were utilized as models to specifically target fibroblasts. To assess the wound healing potential in vitro, a scratch assay was performed, providing insights into wound closure. Additionally, we created wound models in mice to evaluate the in vivo effects of the treatment. RESULTS: Our results showed that L. reuteri NCHBL-005 significantly accelerated wound closure in L929 fibroblast compared to other lactobacilli and exhibited superior efficacy in activating the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. Through MAPK inhibition assays, we confirmed that the wound healing effects of L. reuteri NCHBL-005 were MAPK-dependent, promoting fibroblast proliferation and differentiation. Notably, L. reuteri NCHBL-005 treatment did not facilitate wound healing in MEF cells derived from Toll-like-receptor 2 knockout (TLR2-/-) mice, highlighting the critical role of TLR2 in this mechanism. In vivo studies further corroborated these findings, in which topical administration of L. reuteri NCHBL-005 enhanced wound healing and stimulated fibroblast proliferation and activation, as confirmed by histopathological analysis. CONCLUSION: These findings revealed that L. reuteri NCHBL-005 activates fibroblasts through TLR2 stimulation and subsequent MAPK pathway activation, suggesting its potential as a promising therapeutic candidate for wound management."

      "abstract": "Increasing evidence has underscored the significance of post-stroke alterations along gut-brain axis, while its role in pathogenesis and treatment of ischemic stroke (IS) remains largely unexplored. This study aimed to elucidate the therapeutic effects and action targets of Panax notoginseng saponins (PNS) on IS and explore a novel pathogenesis and treatment strategy of IS via profiling the microbial community and metabolic characteristics along gut-brain axis. Our findings revealed for the first time that the therapeutic effect of PNS on IS was microbiota-dependent. Ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) modeling significantly down-regulated Lactobacilli in rats, and PNS markedly recovered Lactobacilli, particularly Lactobacillus reuteri (L.Reu). Metabolomics showed a significant reduction in serum histidine (HIS) in clinical obsolete IS patients and rehabilitation period I/R rats. Meanwhile, the L.Reu colonization in I/R rats exhibited significant neuroprotective activity and greatly increased HIS in serum, gut microbiota, and brain. Moreover, exogenous HIS demonstrated indirect neuroprotective effects through metabolizing to histamine. Notably, vagus nerve severance in I/R rats was performed to investigate HIS's neuroprotective mechanism. The results innovatively revealed that PNS could promote HIS synthesis in gut by enhancing L.Reu proportion, thereby increasing intracerebral HIS through peripheral pathway. Consequently, our data provided novel insights into HIS metabolism mediated by L.Reu in the pathogenesis and treatment of IS."

There are many adjuvants therapeutic strategies for treatment, including probiotics, however, their efficacy is still debated. OBJECTIVES: To assess the efficacy of the strain Lactobacillus reuteri DSM 17938 adjunct to oral rehydration therapy (ORT) in the treatment of children with AGE. METHODS: Randomized, controlled, double-blind, clinical trial conducted in a pediatric emergency department (PED) from October 2021 to January 2023. Children between 1 and 60 months of age with AGE, absence of or mild to moderate dehydration, were included. Clinical and management characteristics were recorded. RESULTS: Sixty-two patients in L. reuteri (group 1) and seventy patients in the placebo group (group 2) were included. Group 1 had less duration of diarrhea (2.77 ± 0.6 vs. 3.10 ± 1.1 days; p = 0.036). The mean frequencies of watery diarrhea in group 1 versus 2 on Days 2, 3, 4, and 5 were less in group 1. Watery diarrhea persisted in 58.6% in group 2 and in 19.4% of group 1 at 5 days of treatment. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that L. reuteri DSM 17938 is effective in decreasing frequency and consistency of stools; and is safe at high doses in patients from 1 month to 5 years of age, in emergency management. It is a low-risk and easy-to-administer intervention, which could reduce complications associated with losses due to AGE."

Probiotics, such as Lactobacillus reuteri, offer potential benefits in periodontal therapy due to their antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties. This study aimed to evaluate the clinical and microbiological efficacy of locally administered biodegradable fibers containing L. reuteri as an adjunct to scaling and root planing (SRP) in managing chronic periodontitis. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A single-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-arm, randomized clinical trial was conducted with 30 patients aged 30-60 years diagnosed with chronic periodontitis were randomized into test (SRP + probiotic fiber) and control (SRP + placebo fiber) groups. Clinical parameters, including plaque index (PI), bleeding index (BI), probing pocket depth (PPD), clinical attachment level (CAL), and microbial load (Porphyromonas gingivalis via quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR)) were assessed at baseline and three months post-treatment. Quantification of P. gingivalis was conducted using real-time quantitative PCR. The Shapiro-Wilk test assessed normality, and the Mann-Whitney U and Wilcoxon tests were used for inter- and intra-group comparisons. RESULTS: Both groups showed significant improvements in clinical parameters (p<0.05). The test group achieved a 45.66% reduction in PI, 57.83% reduction in BI, and significant improvements in PPD (43.06%) and CAL (43.06%). Microbial load decreased more in the test group (63.00%) than in the control group (26.08%). CONCLUSIONS: Adjunctive use of L. reuteri in biodegradable fiber form improves clinical outcomes, highlighting its potential as a non-invasive adjunctive treatment for chronic periodontitis. Further studies are warranted to validate long-term efficacy."

      "abstract": "Weaning stress in piglets can induce intestinal damage, resulting in impaired growth performance. Probiotics have emerged as significant contributors to enhancing gut health in piglets. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of Lactobacillus reuteri (L. reuteri) supplementation on growth performance, intestinal immunity, and intestinal barrier integrity in weaned piglets. In this investigation, fourteen healthy weaned piglets of similar age and weight, were randomly assigned to two groups (n = 7), receiving either normal saline (Control group) or L. reuteri (L-treatment group) over a 16-day period. The findings revealed no significant impact of L. reuteri on growth performance compared to controls. However, it lowered serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels (P < 0.05) and elevated serum concentrations of Immunoglobulin A (IgA), immunoglobulin G (IgG), and secretory immunoglobulin A (sIgA) (P < 0.05). Additionally, L. reuteri notably enhanced the villus height-to-crypt depth ratio in the ileum (P < 0.05) and increased mRNA expression of zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1), Claudin-1, and ZO-1 in ileal tissue (P < 0.05). Furthermore, L. reuteri reduced mRNA expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) (P < 0.05) in the jejunum and colon while enhancing the expression of the anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-10 (IL-10) (P < 0.05) in both the ileum and colon. This study demonstrates that L. reuteri isolated from Ningxiang pigs can improve the intestinal health of weaned piglets by modulating gut barrier function and cytokine levels.",

      "abstract": "Oral diseases, particularly dental caries and periodontal disease, pose significant global health challenges. The imbalance of the oral microbiota plays a key role in the occurrence of these diseases, prompting researchers to seek new strategies to restore oral ecological balance. Lactobacillus reuteri is a Gram-positive rod-shaped bacterium that exists in various body parts of humans, including the gastrointestinal tract, urinary tract, skin, and so on. This species has a potentially positive impact on oral health and plays an important role in maintaining systemic health. Recent studies have explored the application of Lactobacillus reuteri in the prevention and treatment of oral diseases, and its impact on systemic health has also been preliminarily revealed. The current review summarizes the role of Lactobacillus reuteri in oral health and systemic health and outlines its potential applications in the future. Lactobacillus reuteri has shown promising prospects in treating non-communicable biofilm-dependent oral diseases, but its mechanism of action and efficacy still need further research. In addition, Lactobacillus reuteri has also displayed some potential benefits in promoting overall health. Future research should focus on revealing the specific pathways of action of Lactobacillus reuteri, screening for the most beneficial strains, determining the most effective drug delivery strategies, developing oral and systemic health products based on Lactobacillus reuteri, and ensuring their safety in clinical applications."

In the present study, the effects of dietary supplementation of Lactobacillus reuteri postbiotics on the growth performance, intestinal flora structure and plasma metabolome of weaned piglets were investigated. A total of 816 healthy male piglets with uniform weight were divided into two treatment groups: piglets in the control (CTR) group were fed with a basic diet, and the ones in the LAC group were fed with the basic diet supplemented with 500 mg/kg Lactobacillus reuteri postbiotics. There were six replicates in each group and 68 piglets in each replicate. The animal trial lasted for 30 days. The feces and blood of piglets were collected for investigation, and the growth performance during the trial was counted. Our outcomes show that dietary supplementation with Lactobacillus reuteri postbiotics had no effect on the growth performance of piglets; however, it reduced the mortality rate of piglets by 6.37%. The levels of total superoxide dismutase in the serum, propionic acid and butyric acid in the feces were elevated, and the content of malondialdehyde in the serum was decreased with Lactobacillus reuteri postbiotics-treated piglets (p < 0.05). The fecal flora sequencing results show that the relative abundance of Firmicutes and monoglobus was upregulated, and the relative abundance of Bacteroides was downregulated with Lactobacillus reuteri postbiotics-treated piglets (p < 0.05). In addition, the levels of propionic acid and butyric acid in the feces were positively correlated with the relative abundance of Firmicutes and negatively correlated with the relative abundance of Bacteroides (p < 0.05). The plasma metabolome results show that dietary supplementation with Lactobacillus reuteri postbiotics raised the level of coenzyme Q10 in the serum, and the abundance of coenzyme Q10 was positively correlated with the relative abundance of Firmicutes and the level of total superoxide dismutase in the serum. In conclusion, dietary supplementation with Lactobacillus reuteri postbiotics contributed to improving the antioxidant function and reducing the mortality of piglets by regulating the structure of intestinal flora and upregulating the content of coenzyme Q10 in serum."

      "abstract": "Programmed death protein-ligand 1 (PD-L1) inhibitors demonstrate significant antitumor efficacy by modulating T-cell activity and inhibiting the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway, thus enhancing immune responses. Despite their robust effects, systemic administration of these inhibitors is linked to severe immune toxicity. To address this issue, we engineered a strain, REP, which releases PD-L1 nanoantibodies (PD-L1nb) to treat breast cancer and attenuate immunotherapy-related side effects. REP selectively targets tumors and periodically releases PD-L1nb within tumors via a quorum-sensing lysis system. Administration of 108 colony-forming units (CFU) of REP led to a substantial 52% reduction in tumor growth, achieved through the sustained release of PD-L1nb. Importantly, there were no detectable lesions in other organs, with the exception of mild intestinal damage. Further, we explored the potential of a combined treatment using Lactobacillus reuteri (LR) and REP to alleviate intestinal inflammation. LR modulates the expression of inflammatory markers IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-10 through the JNK pathway, reducing intestinal inflammation without compromising REP's antitumor efficacy. Consequently, we formulated a dual strategy employing an engineered strain and probiotics to reduce the adverse effects of immunotherapy in cancer treatment.",

Little is known about the regulatory effect of lung Lactobacillus and its mechanism in BPD. This study explored the effect of L. reuteri on hyperoxia-induced mice lung injuries and examined whether L. reuteri played a role via the IL-22/STAT3 pathway. We found that the intranasal administration of L. reuteri and its tryptophan metabolite indole-3-aldehyde (3-IAld) ameliorated hyperoxia-induced mice lung BPD-like changes, deceased proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α), and increased the levels of surfactant-associated protein C (SPC), aquaporin 5 (AQP5), and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2, also known as FLK-1). Furthermore, L. reuteri and 3-IAld increased the expression of IL-22. IL-22 was also confirmed to ameliorate hyperoxia-induced mice lung pathological changes, and the protective effects of L. reuteri could be inhibited by anti-IL-22 neutralizing antibody. Finally, we confirmed STAT3 activation by IL-22 in MLE-12 cells. In summary, our study confirmed L. reuteri alleviated hyperoxia-induced lung BPD-like changes in mice by activating the IL-22/STAT3 signaling pathway via IL-22 production. Probiotics Lactobacillus is a potential treatment for hyperoxia-induced lung injury in newborns.",

      "abstract": "Lactobacillus reuteri is a well-known probiotic with beneficial effects, such as anti-insulin resistance, anti-inflammatory, and improvement of the intestinal barrier. However, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we found that gavage of L. reuteri improved the intestinal barrier and glucose homeostasis in HFD-fed mice. Analysis of lipid metabolomics reveals a significant increase in eicosatrienoic acid (ETA) levels in mouse feces after L. reuteri gavage. We found that ETA maintain intestinal barrier integrity and improve glucose homeostasis by promoting GLP-1 secretion. Mechanistically, by using CD36 inhibitor in vivo and CD36 knockdown STC-1 cells in vitro, we elucidate that ETA activates intestinal CD36-activated PLC/IP3R/Ca2+ signaling to promote GLP-1 secretion. In vivo administration of GLP-1R inhibitor and in vitro intestinal organoid experiments demonstrate that GLP-1 upregulates the PI3K/AKT/HIF-1α pathway by GLP-1R and increases intestinal tight junction protein expressions, which in turn enhance the intestinal barrier integrity, reduce serum LPS level, attenuate inflammation in white adipose tissue (WAT), and ultimately improve glucose homeostasis in HFD and db/db mice. Our study elucidates for the first time the mechanism by which L. reuteri and its enriched metabolite ETA inhibit WAT inflammation by ameliorating the intestinal barrier, ultimately improving glucose homeostasis, and provides a new treatment strategy for T2D.",

In a rat model of ASD induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) injection during pregnancy, we evaluated the effects of these probiotics on offspring. Administration of L. reuteri or LGG for three weeks post-birth improved social deficits and reduced anxiety in LPS-exposed rats. Additionally, probiotics significantly modified short-chain fatty acid profiles, increasing butyric acid levels and decreasing propionic acid levels. They also enhanced colonic barrier integrity by upregulating tight junction proteins, including ZO-1, Occludin, and Claudin4. RNA sequencing identified differential gene expression in pathways related to inflammation, the HPA axis, and reactive oxygen species metabolism, with NADPH oxidase 1 (NOX1) emerging as a crucial gene. Validation studies confirmed that Lactobacillus strains reduced inflammatory cytokines, inhibited corticosterone secretion, increased antioxidant levels, and suppressed the NF-κB/NOX1 pathway. In an H2O2-induced oxidative stress model using Caco-2 cells, pre-treatment with L. reuteri, LGG, or NF-κB inhibitors enhanced cellular antioxidants, inhibited NF-κB/NOX1 activation, and improved barrier function. Overall, L. reuteri and LGG administration improved social behavior, bolstered colonic barrier function, and mitigated HPA axis overactivation in LPS-exposed rats, while also alleviating oxidative stress in the colon and Caco-2 cells. These findings suggest that L. reuteri and LGG have substantial clinical potential for ASD treatment by targeting multiple pathophysiological mechanisms, including inflammation, HPA axis dysregulation, and oxidative stress, thereby presenting a promising adjunctive therapeutic strategy for enhancing social behavior and gut health in ASD.",

METHODS: A rat model of T2D was established by a combination of a high-fat diet and streptozotocin. The diabetic rats were treated daily with L. reuteri TISTR 2736 (2 × 108 CFU/day) for 30 days. Biochemical, histopathological, and molecular analyses were carried out to determine insulin signaling, carbohydrate metabolism, oxidative stress, and inflammation. RESULTS: The results demonstrated that treatment with L. reuteri TISTR 2736 significantly ameliorated fasting blood glucose and glucose intolerance, and improved insulin sensitivity indices in the diabetic rats. The hepatic histopathology was improved with L. reuteri TISTR 2736 treatment, which was correlated with a reduction of hepatic lipid profiles. L. reuteri TISTR 2736 significantly reduced glycogen content, fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase activity, and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase 1 protein expression, and enhanced hexokinase activity in the diabetic liver. The downregulation of IRS1 and phosphorylated IRS1Ser307 and upregulation of PI3K and phosphorylated AKTSer473 proteins in the liver were found in the L. reuteri TISTR 2736-treated diabetic group. Furthermore, it was able to suppress oxidative stress and inflammation in the diabetic rats, as demonstrated by decreased malondialdehyde and protein levels of NF-κB, IL-6 and TNF-α, but increased antioxidant enzyme activities of superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase. CONCLUSION: By inhibiting oxidative and inflammatory stress, L. reuteri TISTR 2736 alleviated hyperglycemia and improved carbohydrate metabolism through activating IRS1/PI3K/AKT pathway in the T2D rats.",

REUTERI: LY2-2 was orally administered to mice with dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis. 5-Aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) treatment was used as the drug control. RESULTS: The results showed that the disease severity of colitis mice was significantly alleviated. The intestinal inflammation was restricted by synergistically reducing pro-inflammatory cytokines, inhibiting TLR4-NF-κB signaling, restoring the abnormal immune response, and enhancing intestinal barrier function. Of note, L.reuteri LY2-2 showed great potential in modulating macrophages polarization in colonic tissues. Moreover, the gut dysbiosis was improved. The potentially pro-inflammatory pathogenic bacteria such as Helicobacter and Romboutsia decreased and the probiotics including L.rhamnosus and L.plantarum increased. Interestingly, the above pathological indexes in the L.reuteri LY2-2 group were better than those in the 5-ASA group. CONCLUSION: L.reuteri LY2-2 had a better protective effect on DSS-induced colitis via its anti-inflammatory and microbiota-balancing properties, which supports the potential value of this probiotic against colitis. These results contribute to product development of functional probiotics for colitis and provide valuable insights for their mechanisms of biological function to affect human health status.",

Test subjects with abnormal levels of aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and UA were recruited and randomly allocated into six groups. Eighty-two participants successfully completed the 60-day intervention without any dropouts or occurrence of adverse events. The serum AST, ALT, and UA levels were significantly reduced in all treatment groups (P < 0.05). The fecal microbiota analysis revealed the intervention led to an increase in the population of commensal bacteria and a decrease in pathobiont bacteria, especially Bilophila wadsworthia. The in vitro study indicated the probiotic treatments reduced lipid accumulation and inflammatory factor expressions in HepG2 cells, and also promoted UA excretion in Caco-2 cells. The supplementation of multi-strain probiotics (TSF331, TSR332, and TSP05) together can improve liver function and UA management and may have good potential in treating asymptomatic MAFLD.

Probiotic supplementation is a potential therapeutic approach to modify gut microbiota and improve CF management through the gut-lung axis. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of Lactobacillus reuteri supplementation on pulmonary function test, respiratory symptoms and growth in CF patients. METHODS: A randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial was carried out on 40 children with CF aged from 6 to 20 years. Participants were designated to receive either L. reuteri or placebo daily for 4 months. Pulmonary function tests, weight, height and body mass index (BMI) z-scores were measured pre and post treatment. RESULTS: The median baseline BMI of the patients was 16.28 kg m-2. A significant change in the probiotic group's BMI z-score after the study period was observed (P = 0.034) but not for weight and height z-scores (P > 0.05). After treatment, Pseudomonas aeruginosa grew in sputum cultures of seven in the placebo and one patient in the intervention group (P = 0.03) while at baseline it grew in the sputum of four patients in each group. There was no significant difference in forced expiratory volume in the first second, forced expiratory flow at 25-75% or forced vital capacity change between the two groups after the treatment period (P > 0.05). Additionally, no significant differences were found in pulmonary exacerbations, hospitalization frequencies or COVID-19 infection between the two groups during the study (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: The results suggest that L. reuteri supplementation may impact the growth of severely malnourished CF patients. Furthermore, it may be concluded that this strain might reduce P. aeruginosa in the sputum culture of CF patients. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Given the growing problem of antibiotic resistance, it is crucial to improve Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) treatment interventions or provide adjunctive therapy. The objective of this meta-analysis was to evaluate whether Lactobacillus reuteri (L. reuteri) could improve H. pylori eradication rate, reduce the incidence of adverse events (AEs), and alleviate gastrointestinal symptoms. DESIGN: A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing L. reuteri supplementation therapy with placebo was conducted. SOURCES AND METHODS: We retrieved relevant studies from PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library. The primary outcome was H. pylori eradication rate, and the scores on the Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale and AEs were secondary outcomes. RESULTS: Eight RCTs including 1087 patients were included in this analysis. The L. reuteri supplementation group showed significantly higher H. pylori eradication rates in both intention-to-treat (ITT) and per-protocol (PP) analysis [ITT: 80.0% versus 72.6%; p = 0.005, relative risk (RR): 1.10; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.03-1.17; number needed to treat (NNT) = 14; PP: 81.8% versus 75.0%; p = 0.006, RR: 1.09; 95% CI: 1.03-1.16; NNT = 15]. Patients treated with L. reuteri showed greater improvements in gastrointestinal symptoms (pooled mean difference: -2.43, 95% CI: -4.56 to -0.29, p = 0.03). The incidence of AEs was significantly reduced in the L. reuteri supplementation group based on ITT and PP analysis (ITT: p < 0.00001, RR: 0.72, 95% CI: 0.67-0.78; PP: p < 0.00001, RR: 0.70, 95% CI: 0.65-0.77). CONCLUSION: The present meta-analysis demonstrated that supplementation with L. reuteri was beneficial for improving the eradication rate of H. pylori, reducing the overall incidence of side effects, and relieving gastrointestinal symptoms in patients during treatment. The findings provide new insights into clinical decision-making. TRIAL REGISTRATION PROSPERO: CRD42023424052."

      "abstract": "Acrylamide (AA) is a toxic food contaminant that has been reported to cause glucose metabolism disorders (GMD) at high doses. However, it is unclear whether chronic low-dose AA can induce GMD and whether probiotics can alleviate AA-induced GMD. Here, C57BL/6N mice were orally administered with 5 mg per kg bw AA for 10 weeks, followed by another 3 weeks of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analogue (dulaglutide) treatment. Chronic low-dose AA exposure increased the blood glucose level and decreased serum insulin and GLP-1 levels, whereas dulaglutide treatment decreased the blood glucose level and increased the serum insulin level in AA-exposed mice. Then, mice were administered with AA or AA + INT-777 (Takeda G-protein-coupled receptor 5 (TGR5) agonist) for 10 weeks. INT-777 treatment reversed AA-induced downregulation of ileal TGR5 and proglucagon (PG) gene expression and decreased the serum GLP-1 level. These findings indicated that chronic low-dose AA induced GMD via inhibiting the TGR5-GLP-1 axis. Finally, mice were administered with AA for 10 weeks, followed by another 3 weeks of Lactobacillus reuteri JCM 1112 supplementation. L. reuteri supplementation significantly increased serum glucose, insulin and GLP-1 levels, upregulated ileal TGR5 and PG gene expression, and effectively restored the imbalance of bile acid (BA) metabolism in AA-exposed mice, demonstrating that L. reuteri ameliorates chronic AA-induced GMD via the BA-TGR5-GLP-1 axis. In addition, L. reuteri significantly enhanced ileal superoxide dismutase and catalase activities and total antioxidant capacity, thereby preventing chronic AA-induced oxidative stress. Our research provides new insights into the GMD toxicity of chronic low-dose AA and confirms the role of probiotics in alleviating AA-induced GMD.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Leukemia remains a global health challenge, requiring the exploration of alternative therapies with reduced side effects. Probiotics, particularly Lactobacillus species, have gained attention because of their potential anticancer properties. This study investigated the anticancer and cytotoxic effects of postbiotic mediators (PMs) derived from Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) and Lactobacillus reuteri (LR) on acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cells and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). MATERIALS AND METHODS: The PMs were prepared by culturing LGG and LR strains and isolating the supernatant. The MTT assay assessed cell viability on ALL Jurkat cells and PBMCs, and apoptosis analysis was conducted using flow cytometry. Quantitative real-time PCR was also performed to analyze BAX, BCL-2, BCLX, FAS, and p27 gene expression levels. RESULTS: The results showed that PMs derived from LGG and LR significantly reduced cell viability in Jurkat cells (P0.05) but not PBMCs (P0.05). Apoptosis analysis revealed an increase in apoptotic cells after PMs treatment. Nevertheless, gene expression analysis revealed no statistically significant difference between the treated and untreated groups in BAX, BCL-2, BCLX, FAS, and p27 gene expression levels (P0.05). CONCLUSION: Findings suggest that specific PMs derived from LGG and LR possess anticancer properties against ALL cells. This research highlighted the promise of PMs as a cutting-edge and less toxic adjuvant therapeutic strategy in cancer treatment."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer (CRC) incidence is increasing in recent years due to intestinal flora imbalance, making oral probiotics a hotspot for research. However, numerous studies related to intestinal flora regulation ignore its internal mechanisms without in-depth research. RESULTS: Here, we developed a probiotic microgel delivery system (L.r@(SA-CS)2) through the layer-by-layer encapsulation technology of alginate (SA) and chitosan (CS) to improve gut microbiota dysbiosis and enhance anti-tumor therapeutic effect. Short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) produced by L.r have direct anti-tumor effects. Additionally, it reduces harmful bacteria such as Proteobacteria and Fusobacteriota, and through bacteria mutualophy increases beneficial bacteria such as Bacteroidota and Firmicutes which produce butyric acid. By binding to the G protein-coupled receptor 109A (GPR109A) on the surface of colonic epithelial cells, butyric acid can induce apoptosis in abnormal cells. Due to the low expression of GPR109A in colon cancer cells, MK-6892 (MK) can be used to stimulate GPR109A. With increased production of butyrate, activated GPR109A is able to bind more butyrate, which further promotes apoptosis of cancer cells and triggers an antitumor response. CONCLUSION: It appears that the oral administration of L.r@(SA-CS)2 microgels may provide a treatment option for CRC by modifying the gut microbiota.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Human herpes virus type 1 (HSV-1) is a neurotropic pathogen that is infected more than 70% of the world population. The increasing of viral resistance to antiviral drugs and the emergence of side effects has motivated researchers to study the use of probiotics as new antiviral agents. The aim of the present study was to study for the first time the potential antiviral activity of Lactobacillus reuteri (L. reuteri) supernatant against HSV-1. MATERIALS AND METHODS: After measuring the cytotoxicity of L. reuteri supernatant by MTT assay, 1:16 dilution of it was added to HeLa cells before and after HSV-1 infection, after 1.5 hours incubation with HSV-1, and simultaneously with HSV-1 infection. After 48 hours of incubation at 37°C, the viral titer and expression levels of UL54, UL52 and UL27 genes were measured by tissue culture infectious dose 50 (TCID50 ) and Real-Time PCR methods, respectively. RESULTS: HSV-1 titer in the treatment conditions before infection, incubation with HSV-1, simultaneously with infection and after infection was reduced by 0.42, 3.42, 1.83, and 0.83 log 10 TCID50/ml, respectively. When the bacterial supernatant was first incubated with the virus and then added to the cell, or when it was added simultaneously with the virus, the expression of the UL27, UL52, and UL54 genes decreased significantly (p<0.05). When the bacterial supernatant is added to the cell before or after virus infection, the expression of UL52 and UL54 genes does not change significantly (P>0.05). CONCLUSION: The study findings indicated that the supernatant of L. reuteri has a potent anti-HSV-1 effect especially if it is incubated with the virus before inoculation into the cell. Its possible antiviral mechanism is to inhibit the virus by binding to it or changing the surface structure of the virus. Metabolites of L. reuteri can be considered as a novel inhibitor of HSV-1 infection."

METHODS: Mice in the I/R groups were orally administered low and high doses of L.reuteri (L.reuteri-low and L. reuteri-hi; 1 × 1010 CFU/d and 1 × 1011 CFU/d), for 4 weeks prior to surgery. Following this, mice in the model group were treated with an Nrf2 inhibitor (ML-385), palmitoylcarnitine, or a combination of both. RESULTS: After treatment with L. reuteri, mice exhibited reduced levels of serum aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity, as well as a lower Suzuki score and apoptosis rate. L. reuteri effectively reversed the I/R-induced decrease in Bcl2 expression, and the significant increases in the levels of Bax, cleaved-Caspase3, p-p65/p65, p-IκB/IκB, p-p38/p38, p-JNK/JNK, and p-ERK/ERK. Furthermore, the administration of L. reuteri markedly reduced the inflammatory response and oxidative stress triggered by I/R. This treatment also facilitated the activation of the Nrf2/HO-1 pathway. L. reuteri effectively counteracted the decrease in levels of beneficial gut microbiota species (such as Blautia, Lachnospiraceae NK4A136, and Muribaculum) and metabolites (including palmitoylcarnitine) induced by I/R. Likewise, the introduction of exogenous palmitoylcarnitine demonstrated a beneficial impact in mitigating hepatic injury induced by I/R. However, when ML-385 was administered prior to palmitoylcarnitine treatment, the previously observed effects were reversed. CONCLUSION: L. reuteri exerts protective effects against I/R-induced hepatic injury, and its mechanism may be related to the promotion of probiotic enrichment, differential metabolite homeostasis, and the Nrf2/HO-1 pathway, laying the foundation for future clinical applications.",

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Scopus, PubMed, and Web of Science databases were searched according to specific inclusion and exclusion criteria in October 2022. Randomized control trials that evaluated the effects of Lactobacillus reuteri in patients with periodontitis were included. The primary outcome was pocket depth and clinical attachment levels, while the secondary outcome considered was bleeding on probing, microbial levels, and gingival index score. Study quality was assessed based on the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions and the ROB2 tool. RESULTS: A total of eleven studies that examined 369 subjects were included in the review. Adults in the age group of 18-70 years of age suffering from chronic periodontitis were evaluated. Eight out of the eleven studies reported statistically significant improvement in the intergroup pocket depths, whereas seven studies showed a statistically significant reduction in the clinical attachment levels in the probiotic group. Three studies showed no significant improvement in the pocket depth levels in the probiotic group as compared to the controls. Four studies showed no significant reduction in clinical attachment levels between the two groups. The overall risk of bias was high in four studies, while seven studies reported some concerns about the risk of bias. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the limited evidence available, the adjunctive use of Lactobacillus reuteri to scaling and root planing may provide some additional benefit in improving periodontal parameters.",

      "abstract": "The gut microbiome has emerged as a potential target for the treatment of cardiovascular disease. Ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) after myocardial infarction is a serious complication and whether certain gut bacteria can serve as a treatment option remains unclear. Lactobacillus reuteri (L. reuteri) is a well-studied probiotic that can colonize mammals including humans with known cholesterol-lowering properties and anti-inflammatory effects. Here, the prophylactic cardioprotective effects of L. reuteri or its metabolite γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) against acute ischemic cardiac injury caused by I/R surgery are demonstrated. The prophylactic gavage of L. reuteri or GABA confers cardioprotection mainly by suppressing cardiac inflammation upon I/R. Mechanistically, GABA gavage results in a decreased number of proinflammatory macrophages in I/R hearts and GABA gavage no longer confers any cardioprotection in I/R hearts upon the clearance of macrophages. In vitro studies with LPS-stimulated bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM) further reveal that GABA inhibits the polarization of macrophages toward the proinflammatory M1 phenotype by inhibiting lysosomal leakage and NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Together, this study demonstrates that the prophylactic oral administration of L. reuteri or its metabolite GABA attenuates macrophage-mediated cardiac inflammation and therefore alleviates cardiac dysfunction after I/R, thus providing a new prophylactic strategy to mitigate acute ischemic cardiac injury.",

      "abstract": "Infantile functional gastrointestinal disorders, such as colic, constipation, diarrhea, and gastroesophageal reflux (regurgitation), often occur in early infancy and, representing one of the causes of significant parental anxiety, lead to a significant strain on the healthcare resources. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the effects of Lactobacillus reuteri drops (L. reuteri NCIMB 30351) on the symptoms of infantile colic, constipation, diarrhea, and gastroesophageal reflux, as well as on the levels of intestinal microbiota in full-term newborns during the first months of life. A randomized, placebo-controlled, single-masked (blinded), post-marketing clinical study was conducted in two clinical units-Children's City Clinical Hospital of Moscow and Medical Center \"St. Andrew's Hospitals-NEBOLIT\" from March 2020 to May 2022 in 90 infants aged from 1 to 4 months (mean age (± SD) 12.3 ± 5.09 weeks; 53.3% females, 46.7% males). Patients with colic, regurgitation (single symptom or combination of several symptoms), and constipation or diarrhea were randomly allocated in two parallel arms to receive either 5 drops (2 × 108 colony forming unit) of L. reuteri NCIMB 30351 (n = 60) or masked placebo (n = 30) for 25 consecutive days. Two treatment arms had equal numbers of patients with constipation and diarrhea (n = 30 each). Daily crying times and their duration, evacuations, and regurgitations were recorded in a structured diary. The levels of gut microbiota were analyzed by deep sequencing of bacterial 16S rRNA gene. Infants with colic receiving supplementary L. reuteri NCIMB 30351 for 25 days had significant reduction in the numbers of colic (change from baseline - 6.3 (7.34) vs - 3.0 (7.29) in placebo, P < 0.05) and numbers of crying cases and mean duration of crying (decrease from baseline - 144 (70.7) minutes, lower in the diarrhea subgroup than in constipation infants, compared with - 80 (58.9) in placebo, P < 0.0001), as well as regurgitation numbers (decreased by - 4.8 (2.49) with L. reuteri vs - 3 (7.74) with placebo). We also observed increased numbers of evacuations in infants with constipation (L. reuteri 2.2 (2.4) vs 0.9 (1.06) in placebo, P < 0.05). There was a remarkable reduction of evacuations in infants with diarrhea, while not statistically significant. The analysis of bacterial 16S rRNA gene in the collected samples showed that L. reuteri positively influences the proportions of prevalent species, while it negatively affects both conditionally pathogenic and commensal microbes. Additional in vitro test for formation of Clostridium colonies in the presence of the probiotic demonstrated that L. reuteri effectively inhibits the growth of pathogenic Clostridium species. No adverse events were reported in this study.   Conclusion: The uptake of L. reuteri NCIMB 30351 leads to a significant reduction in the number of regurgitations, feeding-induced constipations, and diarrhea as well as mean daily numbers of crying and crying duration in infants during the first months of life. Our results suggest that L. reuteri NCIMB 30351 represents a safe and effective treatment for colic in newborns.  Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov : NCT04262648. What is Known: • Infantile functional gastrointestinal disorders, such as colic, constipation, diarrhea, and gastroesophageal reflux (regurgitation), often occur in early infancy and, represent one of the causes of significant parental anxiety. • A number of studies have shown that both the composition and diversity of the intestinal microbiota play important roles in the development and function of the gastrointestinal tract. What is New: • The uptake of L. reuteri NCIMB 30351 leads to a significant reduction in the number of regurgitations, feeding-induced constipations, and diarrhea as well as mean daily numbers of crying and crying duration in infants during the first months of life. • L. reuteri positively influences the proportions of prevalent species, while it negatively affects both conditionally pathogenic and commensal microbes in gut microbiota.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The current study aimed to investigate the role of probiotic Lactobacillus reuteri for the treatment and prevention of breast cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Breast cancer was induced by using Cadmium Chloride (Cd) (2 mg/kg) in group II. Tamoxifen was administered to group III. Group IV was treated with Lactobacillus reuteri. Group V was treated with Cd for one month and divided into three subgroups including VA, VB, and VC which were treated with tamoxifen, Lactobacillus reuteri, and tamoxifen + Lactobacillus reuteri, respectively. RESULTS: Significantly higher levels of TNF-α (40.9 ± 4.2 pg/mL), IL-6 (28.0 ± 1.5 pg/mL), IL-10 (60.2 ± 2.0 pg/mL), IFN-γ (60.2 ± 2.0 pg/mL), ALAT (167.2 ± 6.2 U/l), ASAT (451.6 ± 13.9 U/l), and MDA (553.8 ± 19.6 U/l) was observed in Cd group. In comparison, significantly lower levels of TNF-α (18.0 ± 1.1 pg/mL), IL-6 (9.4 ± 0.4 pg/mL), IL-10 (20.8 ± 1.1 pg/mL), IFN-γ (20.8 ± 1.1 pg/mL), ALAT (85.2 ± 3.6 U/l), ASAT (185 ± 6.9 U/l), and MDA (246.0 ± 7.5 U/l) were observed in group Cd + Tam + LR. Liver histopathology of the Cd group showed hemorrhage and ductal aberrations. However, mild inflammation and healthier branched ducts were observed in treatment groups. Furthermore, the renal control group showed normal glomerular tufts, chronic inflammation from the Cd group, and relatively healthier glomerulus with mild inflammation in treatment groups. CONCLUSION: Hence, the preventive and anticancerous role of probiotic Lactobacillus reuteri is endorsed by the findings of the current study.",

      "abstract": "Diarrhea is a prevalent health issue in farm animals and poses a significant challenge to the progress of animal husbandry. Recent evidence suggested that probiotics can alleviate diarrhea by maintaining gut microbial balance and enhancing the integrity of the intestinal barrier. However, there is a scarcity of studies investigating the efficacy of equine Lactobacillus reuteri in relieving E. coli-induced diarrhea. Hence, this study aimed to examine the potential of equine-derived Lactobacillus reuteri in alleviating E. coli diarrhea from the perspective of gut microbiota. Results demonstrated that supplementation of Lactobacillus reuteri had the potential to alleviate diarrhea induced by E. coli infection and restore the decline of tight junction genes, such as Claudin-1 and ZO-1. Additionally, Lactobacillus reuteri supplementation can restore the expression of inflammatory factors (IL-6, IL-10, TNF-α, and IFN-γ) and reduce colon inflammatory damage. Diversity analysis, based on amplicon sequencing, revealed a significant reduction in the diversity of gut microbiota during E. coli-induced diarrhea. Moreover, there were notable statistical differences in the composition and structure of gut microbiota among the different treatment groups. E. coli could induce gut microbial dysbiosis by decreasing the abundance of beneficial bacteria, including Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, Ligilactobacillus, Enterorhabdus, and Lachnospiraceae_UCG_001, in comparison to the control group. Conversely, supplementation with Lactobacillus reuteri could restore the abundance of beneficial bacteria and increase the diversity of the gut microbiota, thereby reshaping gut microbiota. Additionally, we also observed that supplementation with Lactobacillus reuteri alone improved the gut microbial composition and structure. In summary, the findings suggest that Lactobacillus reuteri can alleviate E. coli-induced diarrhea by preserving the integrity of the intestinal barrier and modulating the composition of the gut microbiota. These results not only contribute to understanding of the mechanism underlying the beneficial effects of Lactobacillus reuteri in relieving diarrhea, but also provide valuable insights for the development of probiotic products aimed at alleviating diarrheal diseases.",

      "abstract": "Periodontitis is an oral infectious disease caused by various pathogenic bacteria, such as Porphyromonas gingivalis. Although probiotics and their cellular components have demonstrated positive effects on periodontitis, the beneficial impact of peptidoglycan (PGN) from probiotic Lactobacillus remains unclear. Therefore, our study sought to investigate the inhibitory effect of PGN isolated from L. reuteri (LrPGN) on P. gingivalis-induced inflammatory responses. Pretreatment with LrPGN significantly inhibited the production of interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, and CCL20 in RAW 264.7 cells induced by P. gingivalis lipopolysaccharide (LPS). LrPGN reduced the phosphorylation of PI3K/Akt and MAPKs, as well as NF-κB activation, which were induced by P. gingivalis LPS. Furthermore, LrPGN dose-dependently reduced the expression of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), indicating that LrPGN inhibits periodontal inflammation by regulating cellular signaling cascades through TLR4 suppression. Notably, LrPGN exhibited stronger inhibition of P. gingivalis LPS-induced production of inflammatory mediators compared to insoluble LrPGN and proteinase K-treated LrPGN. Moreover, MDP, a minimal bioactive PGN motif, also dose-dependently inhibited P. gingivalis LPS-induced inflammatory mediators, suggesting that MDP-like molecules present in the LrPGN structure may play a crucial role in the inhibition of inflammatory responses. Collectively, these findings suggest that LrPGN can mitigate periodontal inflammation and could be a useful agent for the prevention and treatment of periodontitis.",

      "abstract": "Mastitis is the most frequent disease of cows and has well-recognized detrimental effects on animal wellbeing and dairy farm profitability. With the advent of the postantibiotic era, alternative antibiotic agents, especially probiotics, have received increasing attention in the treatment of mastitis. Based on research showing that Lactobacillus reuteri (L. reuteri) has anti-inflammatory effects, this study explored the protective effects and mechanisms of L. reuteri against mastitis induced by Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) in mice. First, mice with S. aureus-induced mastitis were orally administered L. reuteri, and the inflammatory response in the mammary gland was observed. The results showed that L. reuteri significantly inhibited S. aureus-induced mastitis. Moreover, the concentration of oxytocin (OT) and protein expression of oxytocin receptor (OTR) were measured, and inhibition of OTR or vagotomy reversed the protective effect of L. reuteri or its culture supernatant (LCS) on S. aureus-induced mastitis. In addition, in mouse mammary epithelial cells (MMECs), OT inhibited the inflammation induced by S. aureus by inhibiting the protein expression of OTR. It was suggested that L. reuteri protected against S. aureus-induced mastitis by releasing OT. Furthermore, microbiological analysis showed that the composition of the microbiota was altered, and the relative abundance of Lactobacillus was significantly increased in gut and mammary gland after treatment with L. reuteri or LCS. In conclusion, our study found the L. reuteri inhibited the mastitis-induced by S. aureus via promoting the release of OT, and treatment with L. reuteri increased the abundance of Lactobacillus in both gut and mammary gland.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The present study aimed to evaluate the effects of reuterin, a bioactive isolated from the probiotic Lactobacillus reuteri (L. reuteri) on periodontal tissue regeneration, and provide a new strategy for periodontitis treatment in the future. BACKGROUND: Data discussing the present state of the field: Probiotics are essential for maintaining oral microecological balance. Our previous study confirmed that probiotic L. reuteri extracts could rescue the function of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and promote soft tissue wound healing by neutralizing inflammatory Porphyromonas gingivalis-LPS. Periodontitis is a chronic inflammatory disease caused by bacteria seriously leading to tooth loss. In this study, we isolated and purified reuterin from an extract of L. reuteri to characterize from the extracts of L. reuteri to characterize its role in promoting periodontal tissue regeneration and controlling inflammation in periodontitis. METHODS: Chromatographic analysis was used to isolate and purify reuterin from an extract of L. reuteri, and HNMR was used to characterize its structure. The inflammatory cytokine TNFα was used to simulate the inflammatory environment. Periodontal ligament stem cells (PDLSCs) were treated with TNFα and reuterin after which their effects were characterized using scratch wound cell migration assays to determine the concentration of reuterin, an experimental periodontitis model in rats was used to investigate the function of reuterin in periodontal regeneration and inflammation control in vivo. Real-time PCR, dye transfer experiments, image analysis, alkaline phosphatase activity, Alizarin red staining, cell proliferation, RNA-sequencing and Western Blot assays were used to detect the function of PDLSCs. RESULTS: In vivo, local injection of reuterin promoted periodontal tissue regeneration of experimental periodontitis in rats and reduced local inflammatory response. Moreover, we found that TNFα stimulation caused endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in PDLSCs, which resulted in decreased osteogenic differentiation. Treatment with reuterin inhibited the ER stress state of PDLSCs caused by the inflammatory environment and restored the osteogenic differentiation and cell proliferation functions of inflammatory PDLSCs. Mechanistically, we found that reuterin restored the functions of inflammatory PDLSCs by inhibiting the intercellular transmission of ER stress mediated by Cx43 in inflammatory PDLSCs and regulated osteogenic differentiation capacity. CONCLUSION: Our findings identified reuterin isolated from extracts of the probiotic L. reuteri, which improves tissue regeneration and controls inflammation, thus providing a new therapeutic method for treating periodontitis.",

The Lactobacillus reuteri probiotic as an adjunctive therapy in the treatment of P associated with T2DM was evaluated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty diabetic participants diagnosed with P (stage III and IV, grade B) were randomized into SI + Placebo (n = 20): subgingival instrumentation plus placebo lozenges and SI + Probi (n = 20): subgingival instrumentation plus probiotics. Probing depth (PD), gingival recession (GR), clinical attachment level (CAL), plaque index (PI), bleeding on probing (BoP), and PISA index were performed at baseline and 30, 90, and 180 days. Cytokine concentration in the gingival crevicular fluid, subgingival biofilm sample, and LDL and HDL subfractions were evaluated. RESULTS: In the deep pockets, PD in SI + Probi showed increased values (p = 0.02) compared to SI + Placebo at 90 days. For CAL, SI + Probi showed increased values compared to SI + Placebo, with a significant difference at 30 days (p = 0.03), 90 days (p = 0.02), and 180 days (p = 0.04). At #PD ≥ 7 mm, SI + Probi had a more frequent number of sites (p = 0.03) compared to SI + Placebo only at baseline. For the PISA, SI + Probi showed a significant difference (p = 0.04) compared to SI + Placebo at 90 days. For cytokines, SI + Probi showed higher quantification than SI + Placebo for IL-10 (p < 0.001) at 90 days, IL-12 (p = 0.010) at 90 days, IL-1β (p = 0.035) at 90 days, and IL-8 (p = 0.003) at baseline. SI + Placebo showed higher quantification of IL-1β (p = 0.041) compared to SI + Probi only at 30 days. There was a reduction in all microbial complexes. SI + Probi improved LDL size (246.7 nm vs 260.4 nm; p < 0.001), while large HDL subfractions were reduced aft 180 days of treatment (24.0% vs 20.3%; p = 0.022) when compared with SI + Placebo; this response was dependent of probiotics (1.0 mg/dL vs - 6.2 mg/dL; p = 0.002). CONCLUSION: Subgingival instrumentation improved the clinical periodontal parameters in patients with T2DM. The use of L. reuteri probiotics had no additional effects compared with the placebo; however, there was a positive effect on the lipoprotein subfraction. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Scientific rationale for study: subgingival instrumentation with probiotics may be a proposal for the treatment of periodontitis (P), especially for patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: the use of L. reuteri probiotics had no additional effects compared with the placebo; however, there was a positive effect on the lipoprotein subfraction.  Practical implications: L. reuteri as an adjunct to subgingival instrumentation may have significant therapeutic implications in dyslipidemia.",

We have previously demonstrated that chronic subcutaneous GC treatment in mice leads to gut barrier dysfunction and trabecular bone loss. We further showed that treating with probiotics or barrier enhancers improves gut barrier function and prevents GIO. The overall goal of this study was to test if probiotics could prevent GC-induced gut barrier dysfunction and bone loss in a clinically relevant oral-GC model of GIO. Eight-week-old male CD-1 mice were treated with vehicle or corticosterone in the drinking water for 4 weeks and administered probiotics Lactobacillus reuteri ATCC 6475 (LR 6475) or VSL#3 thrice weekly via oral gavage. As expected, GC treatment led to significant gut barrier dysfunction (assessed by measuring serum endotoxin levels) and bone loss after 4 weeks. Serum endotoxin levels significantly and negatively correlated with bone volume. Importantly, LR 6475 treatment effectively prevented both GC-induced increase in serum endotoxin and trabecular bone loss. VSL#3 had intermediate results, not differing from either control or GC-treated animals. GC-induced reductions in femur length, cortical thickness, and cortical area were not affected by probiotic treatment. Taken together, these results are the first to demonstrate that LR 6475 effectively prevents the detrimental effects of GC treatment on gut barrier, which correlates with enhanced trabecular bone health in an oral mouse model of GIO. © 2023 The Authors.

This model was established via valproic acid injection into pregnant females. Post-weaning, male progeny received daily synbiotic treatment, a combination of Lactobacillus reuteri (L. reuteri) and inulin, for four weeks. Results indicated that the synbiotic rectified social impairments and attenuated inflammatory cytokine expressions in the brain. Moreover, synbiotic intervention protected gut barrier integrity and altered the gut microbiota composition, enhancing the butyrate-producing Bifidobacterium abundance. The synbiotic elevated metabolites such as butyrate and 3-hydroxybutyric acid (3-HB), alongside upregulated genes associated with 3-HB synthesis in the colon and liver, and brain receptors. Conclusively, the synbiotic combination of L. reuteri and inulin mitigated ASD-related social impairments, partially via their regulatory effect on the gut-brain axis.",

      "abstract": "Mental health is influenced by the gut-brain axis; for example, gut dysbiosis has been observed in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD). Gut microbial changes by fecal microbiota transplantation or probiotics treatment reportedly modulates depressive symptoms. However, it remains unclear how gut dysbiosis contributes to mental dysfunction, and how correction of the gut microbiota alleviates neuropsychiatric disorders. Our previous study showed that chronic consumption of Lactobacillus reuteri ATG-F4 (F4) induced neurometabolic alterations in healthy mice. Here, we investigated whether F4 exerted therapeutic effects on depressive-like behavior by influencing the central nervous system. Using chronic unpredictable stress (CUS) to induce anhedonia, a key symptom of MDD, we found that chronic F4 consumption alleviated CUS-induced anhedonic behaviors, accompanied by biochemical changes in the gut, serum, and brain. Serum and brain metabolite concentrations involved in tryptophan metabolism were regulated by CUS and F4. F4 consumption reduced the elevated levels of serotonin (5-HT) in the brain observed in the CUS group. Additionally, the increased expression of Htr1a, a subtype of the 5-HT receptor, in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) of stressed mice was restored to levels observed in stress-naïve mice following F4 supplementation. We further demonstrated the role of Htr1a using AAV-shRNA to downregulate Htr1a in the mPFC of CUS mice, effectively reversing CUS-induced anhedonic behavior. Together, our findings suggest F4 as a potential therapeutic approach for relieving some depressive symptoms and highlight the involvement of the tryptophan metabolism in mitigating CUS-induced depressive-like behaviors through the action of this bacterium."

      "abstract": "A radiation-induced brain injury (RIBI) is a major adverse event following radiotherapy of malignant tumors. RIBI would affect cognitive function, leading to a series of complications and even death. However, the pathogenesis of RIBI is still unclear, and it still lacks specific therapeutic drugs. The gut-brain bidirectional communication may be mediated by various microbiota and metabolites in the gastrointestinal tract. Probiotics are closely related to physiological health. The theory of the gut-brain axis provides us with a new idea to improve the gut microenvironment by supplementing probiotics against RIBI. Here, Lactobacillus reuteri microcapsules (LMCs) were prepared, which were predominantly irregular spheres with a rough surface under a scanning electron microscope and a narrow size distribution ranging from 20 to 700 μm. The transmission electron microscopy images showed that the structure of microcapsules containing Lactobacillus reuteri (L. reuteri) was a core and shell structure. The survival of L. reuteri in microcapsules was significantly more than that of free L. reuteri in the simulated stomach environment of pH 1.2. 16S rDNA sequencing showed that LMCs observably increased the relative abundance of Lactobacillus in RIBI mice. More importantly, compared with the RIBI model mice, the behavior of RIBI mice treated with LMCs was significantly improved. In addition, LMCs greatly alleviated the pathological damage of the hippocampus and intestines in the mice after irradiation and reduced the level of TNF-α and IL-6 in vivo. Generally, LMCs are a promising oral preparation, which provide new ideas and methods for the treatment of RIBI.",

However, the mechanisms underlying the ECR processing are not elucidated. PURPOSE: Coptidis Rhizoma (CR) regulates the gut microbiota in the treatment of gastrointestinal diseases. This study explored the mechanism of action of ECR before and after processing in UC in view of the regulation of gut microecology. STUDY DESIGN: A preclinical experimental investigation was performed using a mouse model of UC to examine the regulatory effect of ECR and its mechanisms through gut microbiota analysis and metabolomic assays. METHODS: Mice received 4% dextran sulfate sodium to establish a UC model and treated with ECR and CR. Colonic histopathology and inflammatory changes were observed. Gut microbiota was analyzed using 16 s rRNA sequencing. Transplants of Lactobacillus reuteri were used to explore the correlation between ECR processing and the gut microbiota. The expression of mucin-2, Lgr5, and PCNA in colonic epithelial cells was measured using immunofluorescence. Wnt3a and β-catenin levels were detected by western blotting. The metabolites in the colon tissue were analyzed using a targeted energy metabolomic assay. The effect of energy metabolite α-ketoglutarate (α-KG) on L. reuteri growth and UC were verified in mice. RESULTS: ECR improved the effects on UC in mice compared to CR, including alleviating colonic injury and inflammation, and modulating gut microbiota by increasing L. reuteri level. L. reuteri dose-dependently alleviated colonic injury, increased mucin-2 level, and promoted colonic epithelial regeneration by increasing Lgr5 and PCNA expression. This was consistent with the results before and after ECR processing. L. reuteri promoted epithelial regeneration by upregulating Wnt/β-catenin pathway. Moreover, ECR increased metabolites levels (especially α-KG) to promote energy metabolism in the colon tissue compared to CR. α-KG treatment increased L. reuteri level and alleviated mucosal damage in UC mice. It promoted L. reuteri growth by increasing the energy metabolic status by enhancing α-KG dehydrogenase activity. CONCLUSION: ECR processing improves the therapeutic effects of UC via the α-KG-L. reuteri-epithelial regeneration axis.",

The present study aimed to investigate the simultaneous effects of calcium fluoride nanoparticles (CaF2 NPs) and lactobacillus reuteri ATCC PTA 6475 (L. reuteri) against osteoporosis in an ovariectomized rat model (OVX). METHODS: In this study, 18 matured Wistar female rats were randomly assigned into 6 groups, including control, OVX, sham, OVX + L. reuteri, OVX + CaF2 NPs, and OVX + L. reuteri + CaF2 NPs. We used OVX rats to simulate post-menopausal osteoporosis, and the treatments were begun two weeks before OVX and continued for four weeks. All groups' blood samples were collected, and serum biomarkers (estrogen, calcium, vitamin D3, and alkaline phosphatase (ALP)) were measured. The tibia and Femur lengths of all groups were measured. Histopathological slides of tibia, kidney, and liver tissues were analyzed using the Hematoxylin and Eosin staining method. RESULTS: Our results revealed that dietary supplementation of L. reuteri and CaF2 NPs in low doses for 6 weeks did not show adverse effects in kidney and liver tissues. The tibial and femoral lengths of OVX rats as well as the population of osteoblasts and osteocytes and newly generated osteoid in the tibia remarkably increased in the combination therapy group. Moreover, there was a significant increase in serum estrogen levels and a significant decrease in serum calcium and alkaline phosphatase levels in combination treatment groups compared to the OVX groups not receiving the diet. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest the favorable effects of the simultaneous supplementation of L. reuteri and CaF2 NP to reduce post-menopausal bone loss.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Digestive system diseases have evolved into a growing global burden without sufficient therapeutic measures. Lactobacillus reuteri (L. reuteri) is considered as a new potential economical therapy for its probiotic effects in the gastrointestinal system. We have provided an overview of the researches supporting various L. reuteri strains' application in treating common digestive system diseases, including infantile colic, diarrhea, constipation, functional abdominal pain, Helicobacter pylori infection, inflammatory bowel disease, diverticulitis, colorectal cancer and liver diseases. METHODS: The summarized literature in this review was derived from databases including PubMed, Web of Science, and Google Scholar. RESULTS: The therapeutic effects of L. reuteri in digestive system diseases may depend on various direct and indirect mechanisms, including metabolite production as well as modulation of the intestinal microbiome, preservation of the gut barrier function, and regulation of the host immune system. These actions are largely strain-specific and depend on the activation or inhibition of various certain signal pathways. It is well evidenced that L. reuteri can be effective both as a prophylactic measure and as a preferred therapy for infantile colic, and it can also be recommended as an adjuvant strategy to diarrhea, constipation, Helicobacter pylori infection in therapeutic settings. While preclinical studies have shown the probiotic potential of L. reuteri in the management of functional abdominal pain, inflammatory bowel disease, diverticulitis, colorectal cancer and liver diseases, its application in these disease settings still needs further study. CONCLUSION: This review focuses on the probiotic effects of L. reuteri on gut homeostasis via certain signaling pathways, and emphasizes the importance of these probiotics as a prospective treatment against several digestive system diseases.",

One method of controlling cancer cell growth is targeting apoptosis. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to induce apoptosis in breast cancer cells by purifying L-asparaginase from human breast milk Lactobacillus reuteri isolates via inhibition of Caspases 8 and 9. METHODS: The best L. reuteri isolates producing L-asparagine with the highest enzyme activity were identified from human breast milk and chosen for L-asparaginase purification. The MTT cell viability assay used for measure the toxicity of the enzyme. Breast cancer cell line was used to study the effect of the enzyme on the caspase 8 and caspase 9 gene expression. RESULTS: The MTT cell viability assay showed the inhibition rates ranged between 30% and 80%, of cell death, occurred when 3.125, 6.25, 12.5, 25, 50, and 100 μg/ml of the enzyme used and IC50 was 4.305 μg/ml. The breast cell lines were treated with the enzyme at a concentration of IC50 value. The Cas8 and Cas9 genes expression in L-asparagine treated breast cancer cell line at a concentration of IC50 value were upregulated (the fold of gene expression are 2.071 and 1.197 respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Breast milk L. reuteri L-asparaginase induces apoptosis via Cas8 and Cas9 upregulation in the breast cancer cell line. L. reuteri L-asparaginase treatment may be the hopeful approach for the management of breast cancer. Furthermore, the results may highlight the fact that the presence of L-asparaginase-producing L. reuteri isolates in human breast milk may aid in breast cancer improvement or even prevention.",

Adding Lactobacillus reuteri probiotic as an adjunct treatment has shown some promising results. This study aims to investigate the efficacy of Lactobacillus reuteri DSM 17648 in H. pylori eradication and its effect in ameliorating gastrointestinal symptoms and adverse treatment effects. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial involved treatment-naïve H. pylori-positive patients. Ninety patients received standard triple therapy for 2 weeks before receiving either a probiotic or placebo for 4 weeks. The posttreatment eradication rate was assessed via a 14 C urea breath test in Week 8. The Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale (GSRS) questionnaire and an interview on treatment adverse effects were conducted during this study. RESULTS: The eradication rate was higher in the probiotic group than in the placebo group, with a 22.2% difference in the intention-to-treat analysis (91.1% vs. 68.9%; p = 0.007) and 24.3% difference in the per-protocol analysis (93.2% vs. 68.9%; p = 0.007). The probiotic group showed significant pre- to post-treatment reductions in indigestion, constipation, abdominal pain, and total GSRS scores. The probiotic group showed significantly greater reductions in GSRS scores than the placebo group: indigestion (4.34 ± 5.00 vs. 1.78 ± 5.64; p = 0.026), abdominal pain (2.64 ± 2.88 vs. 0.89 ± 3.11; p = 0.007), constipation (2.34 ± 3.91 vs. 0.64 ± 2.92; p = 0.023), and total score (12.41 ± 12.19 vs. 4.24 ± 13.72; p = 0.004). The probiotic group reported significantly fewer adverse headache (0% vs. 15.6%; p = 0.012) and abdominal pain (0% vs. 13.3%; p = 0.026) effects. CONCLUSIONS: There was a significant increase in H. pylori eradication rate and attenuation of symptoms and adverse treatment effects when L. reuteri was given as an adjunct treatment.",

Rats were separated into six groups after adaptation and were then fed a normal control (NC), a high-cholesterol diet (HC), or a HC supplemented with simvastatin 15 mg/kg body weight (positive control [PC]), LRC 1 × 109 colony-forming units (CFU)/rat/day, LRC 4 × 109 CFU/rat/day, or LRC 1 × 1010 CFU/rat/day (1 × 109, 4 × 109, or 1 × 1010). The rats were dissected to study the effects of LRC on cholesterol metabolism and intestinal excretion at the end of experimental period. We discovered that LRC mainly participated in the restraint of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, the uptake of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol into tissues, partially in the transport of cholesteryl esters into high density lipoprotein for maturation, and intestinal excretion of cholesterol. These results are supported by the expression of transcription factors and enzymes such as HMG-CoA reductase, SREBP2, CYP7A1, CETP, and LCAT in both messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein levels in serum and hepatic tissue. Furthermore, the LRC treatment in HepG2 significantly reduced the mRNA expression of HMG-CoA reductase, SREBP2, and CEPT and significantly increased the mRNA expression of LDL-receptor, LCAT, and CYP7A1 at all doses. Hence, we suggest that LRC supplementation could alleviate the serum cholesterol level by inhibiting the intracellular cholesterol synthesis, and augmenting excretion of intestinal cholesterol.",

      "abstract": "It was assumed that dietary inclusion of Lactobacillus reuteri SL001 isolated from the gastric contents of rabbits could act as an alternative to feed antibiotics to improve the growth performance of broiler chickens. We randomly assigned 360 one-day-old AA white-feathered chicks in three treatments: basal diet (control), basal diet plus zinc bacitracin (antibiotic), and basal diet plus L. reuteri SL001 (SL001) treatment. The results showed the total BW gain and average daily gain (ADG) of broilers in SL001 treatment increased significantly (p < 0.05, respectively) compared with the control group from day 0 to 42. Moreover, we observed higher levels of immune globulins in both the SL001 group and the antibiotic group. Total antioxidant capacity and levels of antioxidant factors were also significantly increased (p ≤ 0.05, respectively) in the SL001 treatment group, while the interleukin 6, interleukin 4, creatinine, uric acid, total cholesterol, triglyceride, VLDL, LDL and malondialdehyde were remarkably decreased (p < 0.05, respectively). In the ileum of SL001 treatment broilers, the height of villi and the ratio of villi height to crypt depth were significantly increased (p < 0.05). Meanwhile, the crypt depth reduced (p < 0.01) and the ratio of villi height to crypt depth increased (p < 0.05) in the jejunum compared to the control. The abundance of microbiota increased in the gut of broilers supplemented with SL001. Dietary SL001 significantly increased the relative abundance of Actinobacteria in the cecal contents of broilers (p < 0.01) at the phylum level. In conclusion, L. reuteri SL001 supplementation promotes the growth performance of broiler chickens and exhibits the potential application value in the industry of broiler feeding."

      "abstract": "The recent reports have revealed that increase in amount of α-1,6 linkages by modification of potato starch with enzyme (glycosyltransferases) treatment gains slowly digestible properties to the starch; however, the formation of new α-1,6-glycosidic linkages diminish the thermal resistance of the starch granules. In this study, a putative GtfB-E81, (a 4,6-α-glucanotransferase-4,6-αGT) from L. reuteri E81 was firstly used to produce a short length of α-1,6 linkages. NMR results revealed that external short chains mostly comprised of 1-6 glucosyl units were newly produced in potato starch, and the α-1,6 linkage ratio was significantly increased from 2.9 % to 36.8 %, suggesting that this novel GtfB-E81 might have potentially an efficient transferase activity. In our study, native and GtfB-E81 modified starches showed fundamental similarities with respect to their molecular properties and treatment of native potato starch with GtfB-E81 did not remarkably change thermal stability of the potato starch, which seems to be very prominent for the food industry given the significantly decreased thermal stability results obtained for the enzyme modified starches reported in the literature. Therefore, the results of this study should open up emerging perspectives for regulating slowly digestible characteristics of potato starch in future studies without a significant change in the molecular, thermal, and crystallographic properties.",

      "abstract": "Many synbiotics are effective for the prevention and treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). In the treatment of T2DM, synbiotics often regulate the composition of intestinal flora, which autoinducer-2 (AI-2) may play an important role. Whether the changes of intestinal flora are related to AI-2 during synbiotics treatment of T2DM is a topic worth studying. We elucidated the effects of synbiotic composed of mangiferin and Lactobacillus reuteri 1-12 (SML) on T2DM rats. Male Spraque-Dawley rats were injected intraperitoneally with streptozotocin (STZ) and randomly grouped. After that, biochemical parameters, intestinal flora, fecal AI-2, and intestinal colonization of L. reuteri were detected. The results showed that SML had a hypoglycemic effect and mitigated the organ lesions of the liver and pancreas. Also, SML regulated biochemical parameters such as short chain fatty acids (SCFAs), lipopolysaccharides (LPS), intercellular cell adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α). On the other hand, the proportion of probiotics, such as Lactobacillus acidophilus, L. reuteri, Bifidobacterium pseudolongum, Lactobacillus murinus, and Lactobacillus johnsonii, were elevated by the treatment of SML. In addition, SML promoted the colonization and proliferation of L. reuteri in the gut. Another thing to consider was that AI-2 was positively correlated with the total number of OTUs sequences and SML boosted AI-2 in the gut. Taken together, these results supported that SML may modulate intestinal flora through AI-2 to treat T2DM. This study provided a novel alternative strategy for the treatment of T2DM in future."

METHODS: Search for randomized controlled trials of Lactobacillus reuteri for the treatment and prevention of diarrhea in the Pubmed, Web of science, Medline, and Cochrane databases. Data such as the number of diarrhea patients, time, length of stay, clinical symptoms and effect of diarrhea prevention were extracted for meta-analysis. Relative risk and confidence interval (RR and 95% CI) were used as outcome indicators. RESULTS: 963 participants in the 9 RCTs came from multiple countries/regions. Compared with placebo/no intervention, the number of diarrhea patients in the Lactobacillus reuteri group was significantly reduced on the day 1 (RR = 0.87, 95%CI: 0.78-0.97) and day 2 (RR = 0.61, 95%CI: 0.44-0.83). Cumulative statistics analysis showed that the effect was stable and significant starting on the 4th day after treatment. A few studies have shown that Lactobacillus reuteri can reduce the time of diarrhea, the number of days with watery stools, and days of hospital stay. However, it has no effect on the occurrence of nosocomial diarrhea (RR = 1.11, 95%CI: 0.68-1.83), rotavirus diarrhea (RR = 1.46, 95%CI: 0.78-2.72), antibiotic-related diarrhea (RR = 1.76, 95%CI: 0.77-4.05), and diarrhea (RR = 1.35, 95%CI: 0.95-1.92). CONCLUSION: Addition of Lactobacillus reuteri in the treatment plan has a significant effect on reducing the number of diarrhea and reducing the symptoms of diarrhea, but has no obvious effect on the prevention of diarrhea. Combining probiotics and improving the ability of probiotics to respond is the focus of attention.",

Probiotics are a preventive strategy for obesity and a novel treatment for depression symptoms. However, the ameliorative or therapeutic effect of potential probiotic candidate Lactobacillus reuteri (L. reuteri) on obesity and depression comorbidity still remains unclear. We investigated the effects of chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) in high-fat diet-fed mice and the effects of Lactobacillus reuteri strain 8008 on various disease indicators of obesity and depression comorbidity disease. Methods: Forty male C57BL/6 mice were randomized into 2 groups: the normal control (NC) group (n = 10) and the high-fat diet (HFD) group (n = 30), being fed with normal diet (ND) or high-fat diet (HFD) for 8 weeks, respectively. Then the obese mice fed with HFD were randomly allocated into 3 sub-groups: the HFD group (n = 10); the HFD + CUMS group (n = 10); the HFD + CUMS + L.r group (n = 10). The latter 2 subgroups underwent CUMS for 4 weeks to build the obesity and depression comorbidity mice model. During the duration of treatment, mice were gavaged with 0.5 mL PBS solution or L. reuteri (2 × 109 CFU/mL) once a day, respectively. The body weight, food intake, organ weight, behavioral indicators, histology, blood lipids, levels of inflammatory cytokines and tight junction proteins and abundance of colonic contents bacteria were measured. Results: The obesity and depression comorbidity mice model was successfully established after HFD feeding and chronic stress. The comorbid mice demonstrated inflammatory responses increase in liver and adipose tissues, worsened damage to the intestinal barrier as well as gut microbiota disorder. Gavaged with L. reuteri attenuated depressive-like behavior, improved blood lipids and insulin resistance, reduced inflammation in liver and adipose tissues, improved intestinal tight junctions as well as the microbiome dysbiosis in obesity and depression comorbidity mice. Conclusion: Lactobacillus reuteri strain 8008 could alleviate depressive-like behaviors and related indicators of obesity disorders by regulating the gut microbiota in obesity and depression comorbid mice."

Here, we elucidate a critical microbial-host crosstalk between probiotic-released aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) agonist indole-3-aldehyde (I3A) and CD8 T cells within the tumor microenvironment that potently enhances antitumor immunity and facilitates ICI in preclinical melanoma. Our study reveals that probiotic Lactobacillus reuteri (Lr) translocates to, colonizes, and persists within melanoma, where via its released dietary tryptophan catabolite I3A, it locally promotes interferon-γ-producing CD8 T cells, thereby bolstering ICI. Moreover, Lr-secreted I3A was both necessary and sufficient to drive antitumor immunity, and loss of AhR signaling within CD8 T cells abrogated Lr's antitumor effects. Further, a tryptophan-enriched diet potentiated both Lr- and ICI-induced antitumor immunity, dependent on CD8 T cell AhR signaling. Finally, we provide evidence for a potential role of I3A in promoting ICI efficacy and survival in advanced melanoma patients.",

      "abstract": "Lactobacillus reuteri is a probiotic with bacteriostatic effects, which can effectively inhibit the activity of pathogens. However, the molecular mechanism underlying the inhibition of pathogens by L. reuteri in intestinal cells remains unclear. Using the porcine intestinal cell line IPEC-J2 as a model, we combined RNA-seq and ATAC-seq methods to delineate the porcine genome-wide changes in biological processes and chromatin accessibility in IPEC-J2 cells stimulated by Salmonella enterica BNCC186354, as well as L. reuteri ATCC 53608. Overall, we found that many porcine transcripts were altered after S. enterica BNCC186354 treatment, while L. reuteri ATCC 53608 treatment partially restored this alteration, such as salmonella infection and PI3K/AKT and MAPK pathways. Combined analysis of these two datasets revealed that 26 genes with similar trends overlapped between gene expression and chromatin accessibility. In addition, we identified potential host functional transcription factors (TFs), such as GATA1, TAL1, TBP, RUNX1, Gmeb1, Gfi1b, RARA, and RXRG, in IPEC-J2 cells that might play a critical role and are targeted by L. reuteri ATCC 53608. Moreover, we verified that PI3K/AKT, MAPK, and apoptosis pathways are potentially regulated by S. enterica BNCC186354 but restored by L. reuteri ATCC 53608. The PI3K/AKT pathway was activated by L. reuteri ATCC 53608, thereby potentially inhibiting S. enterica BNCC186354 infection. In conclusion, our data provide new insights into the expression pattern of functional genes and the epigenetic alterations in IPEC-J2 cells underlying the bacteriostatic action of L. reuteri ATCC 53608.",

In the present study, we examined the efficacy of reuterin derived from probiotic bacteria, Lactobacillus reuteri on the biofilms of major endodontic pathogens using ex vivo model of root canal infections. METHODS: Biofilms of major endodontic pathogens namely Enteoroccus faecalis, Fusobacterim nucleatum, Porphyromonas gingivalis, and Candida albicans were formed on root canals of 60 human premolar tooth samples accordingly a standard protocol. Thereafter, teeth were treated with either 2.5 % NaOCl (positive control), various concentrations of reuterin (test-group) or sterilized-distilled water (negative control) in a time-dependent assay. The efficacy of irrigation was evaluated by a time-dependent assay at 5 min and 30 min after irrigation by colony-forming units assay. The findings were further confirmed by species-specific real-time PCR. Data were statistically analysed using one way ANOVA with a significance level of P < 0.05. RESULTS: Reuterin isolated from L. reuteri was effective against E. faecalis, C. albicans, F. nucleatum, and P. gingivalis biofilms, with a concentration of 100 µg/mL being the most effective compared to the negative control (P < 0.05) and also showed similar efficacy when compared with NaOCl. CONCLUSION: Reuterin isolated from L. reuteri has ability to inhibit in vitro and ex-vivo biofilms of endodontic pathogens, namely E. faecalis, F. nucleatum, P. gingivalis, and C. albicans. Reuterin has potential as a root canal irrigating solution due to its antibiofilm activity. Further research is warranted to determine the potential of probiotic bacteriotherapy in root canal systems."

As a probiotic, Lactobacillus reuteri has been used to inhibit E. coli in clinical applications; however, its integrative interactions with hosts remain unclear, especially in pigs. Here, we found that L. reuteri effectively inhibited E. coli F18ac adhering to porcine IPEC-J2 cells, and explored the genome-wide transcription and chromatin accessibility landscapes of IPEC-J2 cells by RNA-seq and ATAC-seq. The results showed that some key signal transduction pathways, such as PI3K-AKT and MAPK signaling pathways, were enriched in the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between E. coli F18ac treatment with and without L. reuteri groups. However, we found less overlap between RNA-seq and ATAC-seq datasets; we speculated that this might be caused by histones modification through ChIP-qPCR detection. Furthermore, we identified the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton pathway and a number of candidate genes (ARHGEF12, EGFR, and DIAPH3) that might be associated with the inhibition of E. coli F18ac adherence to IPEC-J2 cells by L. reuteri. In conclusion, we provide a valuable dataset that can be used to seek potential porcine molecular markers of E. coli F18ac pathogenesis and L. reuteri antibacterial activity, and to guide the antibacterial application of L. reuteri."

The administration of L. reuteri MG5346 (2×108 CFU/day) for 8 wks significantly improved furcation involvement, but no difference was observed in alveolar bone loss in ligature-induced experimental periodontitis rats. The elevated RANKL/ osteoprotegerin ratio, the biomarker of periodontitis, was significantly lowered in the gingival tissue by administration of L. reuteri MG5346 (p<0.05). L. reuteri MG5346 showed excellent stability in simulated stomach and intestinal fluids and did not have antibiotic resistance.

      "abstract": "The potentially beneficial effects of probiotics in the treatment of obesity have been generally demonstrated. In the present study, a new strain of Lactobacillus reuteri SY523 (L. reuteri SY523) with an anti-obesity effect was isolated from the fecal microbiota of diet-induced obese mice. Untargeted metabolomics analysis of mice serum showed that the significantly differential metabolite indole-3-carboxaldehyde (3-IAId) was markedly elevated in the L. reuteri SY523-treated group, and interestingly, the abundance of 3-IAId was significantly negatively associated with obesity-related indicators. As expected, in the HepG2 cell induced by free fatty acids, the potential activity of 3-IAId in restraining lipid deposition was verified. Further, we found that 3-IAId was involved in the anti-obesity effect of L. reuteri SY523 mainly via regulating the cGMP/cAMP signaling pathway. The highlight of this study lies in clarifying the pivotal role of metabolite 3-IAId in the anti-obesity effect induced by L. reuteri SY523, which is conducive to the development of probiotics for anti-obesity agents."

      "abstract": "AIMS: Inflammatory bowel disease is a complex, refractory disorder characterised by chronic gastrointestinal inflammation. Studies have reported that Lactobacillus reuteri alleviates gastrointestinal inflammation and strengthens the intestinal barrier. However, further biochemical and genetic studies are required to correctly understand the therapeutic potential of L. reuteri. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study sought to further understand the anti-colitis effect of L. reuteri isolated from faecal samples of healthy locals by focusing on biochemical (immunological, mechanical, chemical and biological barriers) and genetic studies. KEY FINDINGS: In this study, we assessed and compared the benefits and efficacy of L. reuteri FYNDL13 and FCQHC8L in the treatment of colitis and found strain FYNDL13 to be superior to FCQHC8L in this regard. Compared with FCQHC8L, FYNDL13 was associated with more diverse and powerful regulatory pathways. Meanwhile, it encouraged butyric acid formation, upregulated antimicrobial peptide-coding gene transcription and prevented hyperimmune reactions on the intestinal periphery and within the intestine. Moreover, it enhanced the abundance of beneficial bacteria (Bifidobacterium, Akkermansia, Blautia and Oscillospira), thereby limiting the relative abundance of harmful bacteria (Bacteroides and Sutterella). Furthermore, the advantage might be attributed to metabolism- and defence system-related genomic characteristics. SIGNIFICANCE: Taken together, our study compares and summarizes a pathway paradigm of these two L. reuteri strains in reinforcing the intestinal barrier against colitis and identifies candidate genes responsible for microbiota-immune axis balance.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Probiotic bacterial supplementation has shown promising results in the treatment of periodontitis and the maintenance of periodontal health. The purpose of this investigation was to evaluate the influence of Lactobacillus reuteri or Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis supplementation with and without prebiotic inulin on biofilm composition using an ex vivo biofilm model. METHODS: Subgingival plaque specimens from three periodontitis-affected human donors were used to grow biofilms on hydroxyapatite disks in media supplemented with varying combinations of prebiotic inulin, Lactobacillus reuteri, and Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis. Relative abundances of bacterial genera present in mature biofilms were evaluated using 16S rRNA next-generation sequencing. Diversity metrics of microbial communities were evaluated using a next-generation microbiome bioinformatics platform. RESULTS: Inulin supplementation produced statistically significant dose-dependent increases in relative abundances of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium species (p < 0.001) with concomitant decreases in relative abundances of Streptococcus, Veillonella, Fusobacterium, Parvimonas, and Prevotella species (p < 0.001). Inoculation with L. reuteri or B. animalis subsp. lactis increased the relative abundance of only the supplemented probiotic genera (p < 0.05). Supplemental inulin led to a statistically significant decrease in biofilm alpha diversity (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The described ex vivo model appears suitable for investigating the effects of probiotic bacteria, prebiotic oligosaccharides, and combinations thereof on biofilm composition and complexity. Within the limitations imposed by this model, results from the present study underscore the potential for prebiotic inulin to modify biofilm composition favorably. Additional research further elucidating biologic rationale and controlled clinical research defining therapeutic benefits is warranted.",

RESULTS: Single-stranded intermediate of pTE15 DNA was not detected in L. reuteri, indicating that this plasmid does not replicate via a rolling circle mechanism. The replicon of pTE15 did not display the structural organization typical of rolling-circle plasmids, nor were they similar to known rolling-circle plasmids. We further provided evidence that this plasmid applied a new mode of theta-type replication mechanism: (1) the size of this plasmid was > 10-kb; (2) the minireplicon consisted of AT-rich (directed repeat, iteron) and DnaA sequences; (3) the minireplicon did not contain double-strand origin (DSO) and essential rep genes, and it also showed no single-strand origin (SSO) structure; (4) the intermediate single-stranded DNA products were not observed for pTE15 replication; (5) the minireplicon did not contain a typical essential replication protein, Rep, (6) its copy number was decreased by chloramphenicol treatment, and (7) genes in pTE15 replication region encoded truncated RepA (TRepA), RepB and RepC, which were replication-associated proteins, but they were not essential for pTE15 replication.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a common neurodevelopmental disease, characterized by deficits in social communication, restricted and repetitive behaviours, and impaired fear memory processing. Severe gastrointestinal dysfunction and altered gut microbiome have been reported in ASD patients and animal models. Contactin associated protein-like 4 (CNTNAP4) has been suggested to be a novel risk gene, though its role in ASD remains unelucidated. METHODS: Cntnap4-/- mice were generated to explore its role in ASD-related behavioural abnormalities. Electrophysiological recording was employed to examine GABAergic transmission in the basolateral amygdala (BLA) and prefrontal cortex. RNA-sequencing was performed to assess underlying mechanisms. 16S rDNA analysis was performed to explore changes in faecal microbial composition. Male Cntnap4-/- mice were fed with Lactobacillus reuteri (L. reuteri) or faecal microbiota to evaluate the effects of microbiota supplementation on the impaired fear conditioning mediated by Cntnap4 deficiency. FINDINGS: Male Cntnap4-/- mice manifested deficiency in social behaviours and tone-cue fear conditioning. Notably, reduced GABAergic transmission and GABA receptor expression were found in the BLA but not the prefrontal cortex. In addition, gut Lactobacillus were less abundant in male Cntnap4-/- mice, and L. reuteri treatment or faecal microbiota transplantation rescued abnormal tone-cued fear memory and improved local GABAergic transmission in the BLA of male Cntnap4-/- mice. INTERPRETATION: Cntnap4 shapes GABAergic transmission of amygdala and fear conditioning, and microbial intervention represents a promising therapy in ASD intervention.

      "abstract": "Recent studies have shown that probiotic supplementation has beneficial effects on bone metabolism. In a randomized controlled trial (RCT) we demonstrated that supplementation of Lactobacillus reuteri ATCC PTA 6475 reduced bone loss in older women with low bone mineral density. To investigate the mechanisms underlying the effect of L. reuteri ATCC PTA 6475 on bone metabolism, 20 women with the highest changes (good responders) and the lowest changes (poor responders) in tibia total volumetric BMD after one-year supplementation were selected from our previous RCT. In the current study we characterized the gut microbiome composition and function as well as serum metabolome in good responders and poor responders to the probiotic treatment as a secondary analysis. Although there were no significant differences in the microbial composition at high taxonomic levels, gene richness of the gut microbiota was significantly higher (P < 0.01 by the Wilcoxon rank-sum test) and inflammatory state was improved (P < 0.05 by the Wilcoxon signed-rank test) in the good responders at the end of the 12-month daily supplementation. Moreover, detrimental changes including the enrichment of E. coli (adjusted P < 0.05 by DESeq2) and its biofilm formation (P < 0.05 by GSA) observed in the poor responders were alleviated in the good responders by the treatment. Our results indicate that L. reuteri ATCC PTA 6475 supplementation has the potential to prevent a deterioration of the gut microbiota and inflammatory status in elderly women with low bone mineral density, which might have beneficial effects on bone metabolism.",

The probiotic strain Lactobacillus reuteri S5 was used to construct an animal model of S. enteritidis infected broilers. A high-throughput sequencing technology was used to analyze the regulatory effects of L. reuteri S5 on the structure of the intestinal microbiota of broilers infected with S. enteritidis; and to examine the possible defense mechanism they used. Our results showed that the administration of L. reuteri S5 reduced colonization of S. enteritidis (p < 0.05), decreased intestinal permeability (p < 0.05), and reduced the bacterial displacement likely due by S. enteritidis colonization (p < 0.05), suggesting some enhancement of the intestinal barrier function. Furthermore, L. reuteri S5 increased the number of operational taxonomic units (OTUs) in the chicken cecal microflora and the relative abundance of Lactobacillaceae and decreased the relative abundance of Enterobacteriaceae. These results suggest that the lactic acid bacterium L. reuteri S5 protected the intestinal microbiota of chickens against S. enteritidis infection."

Previous studies suggested that Lactobacillus reuteri (L. reuteri) ameliorates ALD, but the exact mechanisms are not fully known. This study created an ALD model in mice, and the results showed L. reuteri significantly alleviating lipid accumulation in the mice. Transcriptome sequencing showed the L. reuteri treatment group had the most enriched metabolic pathway genes. We then studied the farnesoid X receptor (FXR) metabolic pathway in the mice liver tissue. Western blot analysis showed that FXR and carbohydrate response element binding protein (ChREBP) were upregulated and sterol regulatory element binding transcription factor 1 (Srebf1) and Cluster of differentiation (CD36) were downregulated in the L. reuteri-treated group. Subsequently, we administered FXR inhibitor glycine-β-muricholic acid (Gly-β-MCA) to mice, and the results show that Gly-β-MCA could reduce the therapeutic effect of L. ruteri. In conclusion, our study shows L. reuteri improved liver lipid accumulation in mice via the FXR signaling regulatory axis and may be a viable treatment option for ALD.",

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Fifty-four male adult Wistar rats were included. EP was induced and maintained for 7 days. Subsequently, the ligature was removed and the animals were allocated into three different experimental groups (n = 18/group): EP - no local treatment, the animals received four systemic saline solution (SS) administrations; SRP+SS, the animals underwent SRP treatment, followed by SS administration; and SRP+PRO, the animals received SRP treatment, followed by the systemic administration of PROs (Lactobacillus reuteri ; 0.16 ml/day). Six animals from each group were euthanised at 7, 15 and 30 days. Histological and histometric analyses of alveolar bone loss (BL) and immunohistochemical analyses for TRAP, RANKL, OPG, OCN, and PCNA were performed. Shapiro-Wilk, ANOVA, post-hoc Tukey, Kruskal-Wallis, Student-Newman Keuls were performed. RESULTS: The SRP+PRO group presented a reduction in inflammation. At 15 days, a lower BL was observed in the SRP+SS and SRP+PRO groups. Greater immunolabeling was noticed for PCNA at 15 days in the SRP+PRO group than in the SRP +SS group. The SRP+PRO group demonstrated a higher OCN immunolabeling pattern than the EP group at 15 and 30 days. CONCLUSION: The use of Lactobacillus reuteri as an adjuvant to SRP for the treatment of EP showed promising results in the control of local inflammatory responses, and enhanced the periodontal tissue repair process according to the employed concentration."

The objective of the present study was to investigate the neuroprotective mechanisms of Lactobacillus reuteri GMNL-263 in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats. In this study, three different groups, namely control group, STZ-induced (55 mg/kg streptozotocin intraperitoneally) diabetic rats (DM), and DM rats treated with Lactobacillus reuteri GMNL-263 (1 × 109 CFU/rat/day), were utilized to study the protective effect of GMNL-263 in the hippocampus of STZ-induced diabetic rats. The results demonstrated that GMNL-263 attenuated diabetes-induced hippocampal damage by enhancing the cell survival pathways and repressing both inflammatory and apoptotic pathways. Histopathological analysis revealed that GMNL-263 prevented structural changes in the hippocampus in the DM group and decreased the level of inflammation and apoptosis in the hippocampus of DM rats. The IGF1R cell survival signaling pathway also improved after GMNL-263 treatment. These results indicate that probiotic GMNL-263 exerts beneficial effects in the brain of diabetic rats and has potential ability for clinical application.",

      "abstract": "Intestinal epithelial barrier injury disrupts immune homeostasis and leads to many intestinal disorders. Lactobacillus reuteri (L. reuteri) strains can influence immune system development and intestinal function. However, the underlying mechanisms of L. reuteri LR1 that regulate inflammatory response and intestinal integrity are still unknown. The present study aimed to determine the effects of LR1 on the ETEC K88-induced intestinal epithelial injury on the inflammatory response, intestinal epithelial barrier function, and the MLCK signal pathway and its underlying mechanism. Here, we showed that the 1 × 109 cfu/ml LR1 treatment for 4 h dramatically decreased interleukin-8 (IL-8) and IL-6 expression. Then, the data indicated that the 1 × 108 cfu/ml ETEC K88 treatment for 4 h dramatically enhanced IL-8, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) expression. Furthermore, scanning electron microscope (SEM) data indicated that pretreatment with LR1 inhibited the ETEC K88 that adhered on IPEC-J2 and alleviated the scratch injury of IPEC J2 cells. Moreover, LR1 pretreatment significantly reversed the declined transepithelial electrical resistance (TER) and tight junction protein level, and enhanced the induction by ETEC K88 treatment. Additionally, LR1 pretreatment dramatically declined IL-8, IL-17A, IL-6, and TNF-α levels compared with the ETEC K88 group. Then, ETEC K88-treated IPEC-J2 cells had a higher level of myosin light-chain kinase (MLCK), higher MLC levels, and a lower Rho-associated kinase (ROCK) level than the control group, while LR1 pretreatment significantly declined the MLCK and MLC expression and enhanced ROCK level in the ETEC K88-challenged IPEC-J2 cells. Mechanistically, depletion of MLCK significantly declined MLC expression in IPEC-J2 challenged with ETEC K88 compared to the si NC+ETEC K88 group. On the other hand, the TER of the si MLCK+ETEC K88 group was higher and the FD4 flux in the si MLCK+ETEC K88 group was lower compared with the si NC+ETEC K88 group. In addition, depletion of MLCK significantly enhanced Claudin-1 level and declined IL-8 and TNF-α levels in IPEC-J2 pretreated with LR1 followed by challenging with ETEC K88. In conclusion, our work indicated that L. reuteri LR1 can decline inflammatory response and improve intestinal epithelial barrier function through suppressing the MLCK signal pathway in the ETEC K88-challenged IPEC-J2.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Probiotic supplementation to antibiotic regimens against Helicobacter pylori infection has been proposed to improve eradication rate and to decrease detrimental effects on gut microbiota. AIMS: To evaluate microbiota modifications due to a low-dose quadruple therapy with bismuth or Lactobacillus reuteri. METHODS: Forty-six patients infected with H. pylori were prospectively enrolled in a single-centre, randomized controlled trial to receive b.i.d. with meals for 10 days low-dose quadruple therapy consisting of rabeprazole 20 mg and bismuth (two capsules of Pylera® plus 250 mg each of tetracycline and metronidazole), or the same dose of rabeprazole and antibiotics plus Gastrus® (L. reuteri), one tablet twice-a-day for 27 days. Stool samples were collected at the enrolment, at the end and 30-40 days after the treatment. Gut microbiota composition was investigated with 16S rRNA gene sequencing. RESULTS: Eradication rate was by ITT 78% in both groups, and by PP analysis 85.7% and 95.5% for Gastrus® and bismuth group, respectively. Alpha and beta diversity decreased at the end of treatment and was associated with a reduction of bacterial genera beneficial for gut homeostasis, which was rescued 30-40 days later in both groups, suggesting a similar impact of the two regimens in challenging bacterial community complexity. CONCLUSIONS: Low-dose bismuth quadruple therapy proved to be effective with lower costs and amount of antibiotics and bismuth. Gastrus® might be an option for patients with contraindications to bismuth. L. reuteri was unable to significantly counteract dysbiosis induced by antibiotics. How to administer probiotics to prevent gut microbiota alterations remains an open question.",

      "abstract": "Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (S. typhimurium) is one of the most important foodborne pathogens that causes colitis in humans. In this study, we compared the effects of a therapeutic treatment using a phage cocktail (Pc) in combination or not with Lactobacillus reuteri (L. reuteri) in an S. typhimurium-induced colitis murine model. An oral administration of 4 × 108 CFU per mouse of S. typhimurium resulted in intestinal barrier disruption and severe inflammatory symptoms. S. typhimurium in the colon of the mice treated with the Pc and L. reuteri (PcLR) combination were completely removed compared to those in the single Pc or single L. reuteri treatment groups. Furthermore, compared with the infected group, the intestinal barrier and colonic pathological damage were significantly improved in the PcLR-treated group. Additionally, the short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) levels in the feces of the mice in the PcLR treatment group were significantly increased compared to those in the feces of the mice in the infected group. In addition, the combination of Pc with acetate and reuterin released by L. reuteri (PcReAc) can also achieve the same effect as PcLR treatment. Thus, these results indicated that the acetate and reuterin released by L. reuteri play an important role in the treatment. The extraordinary therapeutic effects of PcLR and PcReAc depend on the specific bactericidal activity of Pc and the broad-spectrum bactericidal activity and immunomodulation of L. reuteri (or acetate and reuterin) in the host. This study provides a new concept for the treatment of inflammatory diseases caused by intestinal pathogens.",

A total of 144 weaned pigs (Duroc × Landrace × Yorkshire, 21 days of age) were randomly assigned to the control group (CON, fed with a basal diet), the antibiotic group (AO, fed with basal diet plus 100 mg/kg olaquindox and 75 mg/kg aureomycin), and the L. reuteri group (LR, fed with the basal diet + 5 × 1010 CFU/kg L. reuteri LR1) throughout the 164-d experiment. A total of 45 cecal content samples (5 samples per group) from different periods (14th, 42th, and 164th days) were collected for 16S rRNA gene amplification. The results revealed that although LR and AO did not change the diversity of cecal microbiota in pigs, the abundance of some bacteria at the genus level was changed with age. The proportion of Lactobacillus was increased by LR in early life, whereas it was decreased by AO compared with the control group. The relative abundance of Ruminococcaceae was increased along with age. In addition, the gas chromatography results showed that age, not AO or LR, has significant effects on the concentrations of SCFAs in the cecum of pigs (P < 0.05). However, the mRNA expression of tight junction proteins zonula occluden-1 (ZO-1) and occludin were increased by AO in the cecum of pigs on day 14, while LR increased the mRNA expression of intestinal barrier-related proteins ZO-1, occludin, mucin-1, mucin-2, PG1-5, and pBD2 in the cecum of pigs on days 14 and 164 (P < 0.05). In conclusion, LR and AO have different effects on the intestinal barrier function of the cecum, and neither LR nor AO damaged the intestinal barrier function of pig cecum. In addition, LR and AO have little effects on cecal microflora in different stages of the pigs. The microflora and their metabolite SCFAs were significantly changed along with age. These findings provide important information to understand the homeostasis of the cecum of pigs after antibiotic or probiotic treatment."

This study incorporated two types of lactic acid bacteria in shrimp feed through spraying. The shrimps were grouped according to the type and concentration of effective bacteria incorporated into their feed. This research was separated into 3 individual feeding treatment as control, L. reuteri (Lr groups) and P. acidilactici (Pa groups). The shrimp was feeding with 103, 105, and 107 cfu/feed (g) L. reuteri namely as Lr3, Lr5, and Lr7. The shrimp was feeding with 103, 105, and 107 cfu/feed (g) P. acidilactici were named Pa3, Pa5, and Pa7, respectively. Through 8 weeks of feeding, the results revealed that the use of shrimp feed incorporated with lactic acid bacteria did not cause negative effects on water quality. The testing items include ammonia-nitrogen concentration, nitrite-nitrogen concentration, and total vibrio count in the water. In addition, the lactic acid bacteria concentration in the water were in the range of 1.33 ± 0.58 × 101 to 9.77 ± 1.34 × 102 cfu/mL. Observations of the growth performance of the white shrimps after 8 weeks of feeding revealed that both bacteria were beneficial to shrimp growth. In particular, group Lr7 had the highest percentage weight gain (107.99 ± 3.92%), special growth rate (1.93 ± 0.07%), feed conversion ratio (3.34 ± 0.05), and survival rate (97.22 ± 4.81%). Furthermore, observations of the nonspecific immunity reactions of the white shrimps after 4 weeks of feeding indicated that on day 4, the total number of haemocyte in shrimps in groups Lr5, Lr7, Pa3, and Pa5 significantly increased. On days 1 and 4, the phenoloxidase activity and superoxide axion production rates of the Lr group and Ls group increased. This phenomenon was the most significant in group Lr7, and the effect continued until day 28. After day 7, the phagocytic rate of groups Lr5 and Lr7 significantly increased. In addition, Lr and Pa groups exhibited significant increases in the phagocytic index after days 4 and 14, respectively. This phenomenon was also the most significant in group Lr7.",

      "abstract": "Obesity is closely related to metabolic syndromes such as hyperlipidemia and diabetes and has become a global public health problem. Probiotics are now used as a treatment for obesity, but the mechanism by which probiotics treat obesity remains unclear. Herein, we investigated the effects of Lactobacillus reuteri J1 ( L. reuteri J1) on obese mice with the strain being administered at 1010, 109 and 108 CFU mL-1 and explored the possible underlying molecular mechanism. The results revealed that L. reuteri J1 prevented weight gain, lowered fat mass and relieved dyslipidemia, and improved glucose homeostasis and insulin sensitivity. Moreover, the effect of obesity reversal exhibited dose-dependence to some extent. More importantly, mice treated with L. reuteri J1 altered the gut microbiota and bile acid (BA) composition. Analysis of the gut microbiome showed that L. reuteri J1 increased the relative abundances of Lactobacillus, Akkermansia and Clostridium, which strongly correlated with ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) and lithocholic acid (LCA). UDCA and LCA are thought to inhibit farnesoid X receptor (FXR) and activate transmembrane G protein-coupled receptor 5 (TGR5) expression, respectively. Consistent with the increase in the BA pool, L. reuteri J1 treatment inhibited the ileum FXR/FGF15 signaling pathway but activated the hepatic FXR/SHP signaling pathway, resulting in reduced hepatic triglyceride accumulation. In addition, L. reuteri J1 treatment promoted adipose browning by upregulating the expression of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1), which was mainly due to the BA receptor TGR5. These results demonstrated that L. reuteri J1 could treat obesity by inhibiting the FXR signaling pathways and remodeling white adipose tissue, linked with UDCA and LCA which are affected by intestinal microbiota.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: We aimed to explore whether Lactobacillus reuteri could have a positive role in reducing inflammation and bacterial translocation in rats with acute liver failure. METHODS: Lactobacillus reuteri were gavaged to Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats at a dose of 1 × 109 CFU/mL once a day for 14 d. D-galactosamine was injected intraperitoneally to induce acute liver failure for 24 h on the 15th day. Liver function, liver and ileum histology, intestinal cytokines, intestinal tight junction proteins, lipopolysaccharide binding protein, apoptosis molecules, and nuclear factor erythroid-derived 2 (Nrf-2) / heme oxygenase (HO-1) molecules were assessed. RESULTS: The results showed that L. reuteri alleviated liver injury and intestinal inflammation induced by D-galactosamine. L. reuteri also improved the expression of intestinal tight junction proteins and maintained the integrity of the intestinal barrier by inhibiting apoptosis of intestinal epithelial cells. L reuteri induced an increase in Nrf-2 nuclear translocation and elevated induction of HO-1. L. reuteri treatment significantly enhanced the expression of phosphoinositide 3-kinase/protein kinase B (PI3 K/Akt), protein kinase C (PKC), and their phosphorylated forms but not mitogen-activated protein kinase. The nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) pathway was inhibited after L. reuteri treatment. Interleukin (IL)-17A produced by Th17 cells and γδT17 cells may not contribute to an improved function of the intestinal barrier in L. reuteri-treated SD rats. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, our study indicated that L. reuteri-induced expression of intestinal tight junction proteins is mediated by the PI3 K/Akt-Nrf-2/HO-1-NF-κB and PKC-Nrf-2/HO-1-NF-κB pathways, which leads to inhibition of the apoptosis of intestinal epithelial cells, thus maintaining the integrity of the damaged intestinal barrier.",

      "abstract": "Repetitive mild traumatic brain injury (rmTBI) is associated with a range of neural changes which is characterized by axonal injury and neuroinflammation. Ketogenic diet (KD) is regarded as a potential therapy for facilitating recovery after moderate-severe traumatic brain injury (TBI). However, its effect on rmTBI has not been fully studied. In this study, we evaluated the anti-neuroinflammation effects of KD after rmTBI in adolescent mice and explored the potential mechanisms. Experimentally, specific pathogen-free (SPF) adolescent male C57BL/6 mice received a sham surgery or repetitive mild controlled cortical impacts consecutively for 7 days. The uninjured mice received the standard diet, and the mice with rmTBI were fed either the standard diet or KD for 7 days. One week later, all mice were subjected to behavioral tests and experimental analysis. Results suggest that KD significantly increased blood beta-hydroxybutyrate (β-HB) levels and improved neurological function. KD also reduced white matter damage, microgliosis, and astrogliosis induced by rmTBI. Aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) signaling pathway, which was mediated by indole-3-acetic acid (3-IAA) from Lactobacillus reuteri (L. reuteri) in gut and activated in microglia and astrocytes after rmTBI, was inhibited by KD. The expression level of the toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)/myeloid differentiation primary response 88 (MyD88) in inflammatory cells, which mediates the NF-κB pathway, was also attenuated by KD. Taken together, our results indicated that KD can promote recovery following rmTBI in adolescent mice. KD may modulate neuroinflammation by altering L. reuteri in gut and its metabolites. The inhibition of indole/AHR pathway and the downregulation of TLR4/MyD88 may play a role in the beneficial effect of KD against neuroinflammation in rmTBI mice.",

METHODS: Saliva samples were collected prior to consumption and 14th-day post probiotic lozenges consumption (n=40, age 18-23). Oral hygiene index-score (OHI-S) and papilla bleeding index (PBI) were recorded. The salivary microbiome was profiled by next-generation sequencing using the V3-V4 region of 16S-rRNA. Microbial composition, diversity and taxonomic biomarkers were analysed in comparison to probiotic intervention and the clinical characteristics of the cohort using standard bioinformatics tools. RESULTS: The diversity and bacterial community structures did not change significantly in salivary microbiome of periodontally healthy subjects during short-term probiotic intervention. Probiotic consumption correlated with reduction of OHI and PBI scores (50% reduction of scores, P<0.001). The reduction of clinical indices was evident in conjunction with significantly reduced abundance of oral pathogens, such as Porphyromonas pasteri, Treponema sp., Fretibacterium fastidiosum, Kingella oralis and Propionibacterium acnes. CONCLUSION: Short-term probiotic intervention helped maintaining good oral health in patients undergoing fixed orthodontic therapy. Although overall oral microbiome structure remained largely unchanged, a significant alteration in the abundance of health and disease-associated species highlighted the beneficial effect of probiotic."

      "abstract": "The coexistence of allergic rhinitis (AR) and asthma reinforces the concept of \"one airway, one disease,\" which has prompted the exploration for a single intervention to treat both diseases. Lactobacillus reuteri CCFM1040 (CCFM1040) was found to be an inhibitor of the common pathogenesis of AR and asthma in our previous studies. This study presented a randomized, placebo-controlled trial to investigate the clinical effects of CCFM1040 on both diseases. The total symptom score (TSS), the quality of life (QoL), and the modulation in the gut microbiota of patients with AR, the Asthma Control and Test (ACT) of patients with asthma, and the safety of both AR and asthma were measured. In patients with AR, CCFM1040 numerically decreased TSS, Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality of Life Questionnaire (RQLQ), 3 nasal scores in TSS (nasal congestion, watery eyes, and rhinorrhea), and sleep and significantly improved (P = 0.014) non-nose/eye symptoms. The ACT score was numerically increased in patients with asthma (from partially controlled to well-controlled). Significant microbial (from class level to genus level) and metabolic differences (P < 0.05) were found in patients with AR. No adverse reactions were observed. No effect on the blood and urine routine indexes. CCFM1040 has a potential benefit on both diseases. Further studies based on these findings will help to optimize the management of AR and asthma."

      "abstract": "Oral administration (gavage) of a second-generation probiotic, Lactobacillus reuteri (L. reuteri), that releases interleukin-22 (LR-IL-22) at 24 h after total-body irradiation (TBI) mitigates damage to the intestine. We determined that LR-IL-22 also mitigates partial-body irradiation (PBI) and whole-abdomen irradiation (WAI). Irradiation can be an effective treatment for ovarian cancer, but its use is limited by intestinal toxicity. Strategies to mitigate toxicity are important and can revitalize this modality to treat ovarian cancer. In the present studies, we evaluated whether LR-IL-22 facilitates fractionated WAI in female C57BL/6 mice with disseminated ovarian cancer given a single fraction of either 15.75 Gy or 19.75 Gy or 4 daily fractions of 6 Gy or 6.5 Gy. Mice receiving single or multiple administrations of LR-IL-22 during WAI showed improved intestinal barrier integrity (P = 0.0167), reduced levels of radiation-induced intestinal cytokines including KC/CXCL1 (P = 0.002) and IFN-γ (P = 0.0024), and reduced levels of plasma, Eotaxin/CCL11 (P = 0.0088). LR-IL-22 significantly preserved the numbers of Lgr5+GFP+ intestinal stem cells (P = 0.0010) and improved survival (P < 0.0343). Female C57BL/6MUC-1 mice with widespread abdominal syngeneic 2F8cis ovarian cancer that received LR-IL-22 during 6.5 Gy WAI in 4 fractions had reduced tumor burden, less intestinal toxicity, and improved 30-day survival. Furthermore, LR-IL-22 facilitated WAI when added to Paclitaxel and Carboplatin chemotherapy and further increased survival. Oral administration (gavage) of LR-IL-22 is a potentially valuable intestinal radioprotector, which can facilitate therapeutic WAI for widespread intra-abdominal ovarian cancer.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The study aim was to determine if rapid enteric diagnostics followed by the provision of targeted antibiotic therapy ('test-and-treat') and/or Lactobacillus reuteri DSM 17938 would improve outcomes in children hospitalised in Botswana with acute gastroenteritis. METHODS: This was a multicentre, randomised, factorial, controlled, trial. Children aged 2-60 months admitted for acute non-bloody diarrhoea to four hospitals in southern Botswana were eligible. Participants were assigned to treatment groups by web-based block randomisation. Test-and-treat results were not blinded, but participants and research staff were blinded to L. reuteri/placebo assignment; this was dosed as 1×108 cfu/mL by mouth daily and continued for 60 days. The primary outcome was 60-day age-standardised height (HAZ) adjusted for baseline HAZ. All analyses were by intention to treat. The trial was registered at Clinicaltrials.gov. RESULTS: Recruitment began on 12 June 2016 and continued until 24 October 2018. There were 66 participants randomised to the test-and-treat plus L. reuteri group, 68 randomised to the test-and-treat plus placebo group, 69 to the standard care plus L. reuteri group and 69 to the standard care plus placebo group. There was no demonstrable impact of the test-and-treat intervention (mean increase of 0.01 SD, 95% CI -0.14 to 0.16 SD) or the L. reuteri intervention (mean decrease of 0.07 SD, 95% CI -0.22 to 0.08 SD) on adjusted HAZ at 60 days. CONCLUSIONS: In children hospitalised for acute gastroenteritis in Botswana, neither a test-and-treat algorithm targeting enteropathogens, nor a 60-day course of L. reuteri DSM 17938, were found to markedly impact linear growth or other important outcomes. We cannot exclude the possibility that test-and-treat will improve the care of children with significant enteropathogens (such as Shigella) in their stool. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT02803827.",

This study aims to explore the role and mechanism of Fn041 in preventing hypercholesterolemia caused by a high-fat diet in mice. METHODS: C57BL/6N mice were fed a low-fat diet or a high-fat diet and gavage with Fn041 and Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) for 8 weeks. RESULTS: Both Fn041 and LGG prevented the occurrence of hypercholesterolemia, liver and testicular fat accumulation. In addition, a high-fat diet causes intestinal dysbiosis and mucosal barrier damage, which is associated with hypercholesterolemia. Fn041 prevented the high-fat diet-induced reduction in alpha diversity of intestinal microbiota and intestinal mucosal barrier damage. Fn041 treatment significantly increased fecal total cholesterol and total bile acids. CONCLUSIONS: Fn041 prevented hypercholesterolemia by enhancing cholesterol excretion and mucosal barrier function."

Atherosclerosis is the main cause of cardiovascular disease, and hypercholesterolaemia and hyperlipidaemia are the main risk factors for the development of atherosclerosis. Decreasing serum cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations is considered to be an effective strategy to prevent atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Previous studies have shown that many diseases are related to gut microbiota dysbiosis. The positive regulation of the gut microbiota by probiotics may prevent or treat certain diseases. In this study, Lactobacillus reuteri CCFM8631 treatment was shown to decrease plasma total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol, aspartate transaminase, alanine transaminase and trimethylamine N-oxide concentrations, decrease liver TC and malondialdehyde concentrations and recover liver superoxide dismutase concentrations in mice fed a Paigen atherogenic diet. In addition, L. reuteri increased the faecal short-chain fatty acid content (acetate, propionate and butyrate), which was accompanied by an increase in the relative abundance of faecal Deferribacteres, Lachnospiraceae NK4A136 group, Lactobacillus and Dubosiella; a decrease in the relative abundance of Erysipelatoclostridium and Romboutsia and the activation of butanoate and vitamin B6 metabolism, leading to the alleviation of hypercholesterolaemia.",

RESULTS: This study was a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial. And, eradication of H. pylori was reported comparing quadruple therapy include of PPI (proton pomp inhibitor), bismuth subcitrate, clarithromycin, and amoxicillin versus quadruple therapy supplemented with S. boulardii and L. reuteri DSMZ 17648. For this aim, a total of 156 patients were included in the current study; and patients positive for H. pylori infection (n = 156) were randomly assigned to 3 groups: 52 patients (Group P) received conventional quadruple therapy plus L. reuteri, 52 patients (Group S) received conventional quadruple therapy plus S. boulardii daily, for 2 weeks, and 52 patients were in the control group (Group C). At the end of the treatment period, all the subjects continued to take proton pump inhibitor (PPI) alone for 14 days, and then, no medication was given for 2 weeks again. During follow-up, gastrointestinal symptoms were assessed using an evaluation scale (Glasgow dyspepsia questionnaire [GDQ]), and AEs were assessed at 7, 14, 21, and 28 days. As a result, all patients completed the treatment protocol in all groups by the end of the study. Additionally, eradication therapy was effective for 94.2% of subjects in Group S, 92.3% of subjects in Group P, and 86.5% of subjects in the control group, with no differences between treatment arms. In Group S, the chance of developing symptoms of nausea (OR = 2.74), diarrhea (OR = 3.01), headache (OR = 10.51), abdominal pain (OR = 3.21), and anxiety (OR = 3.58) was significantly lower than in the control group (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: S. boulardii could significantly reduce some AEs of H. pylori eradication therapy, but effectiveness of Lactobacillus reuteri on these cases was not significant. It is recommended to conduct the future research with larger sample size in order to investigate the effect. TRIAL REGISTRATION: IRCT20200106046021N1, this trial was registered on Jan 14, 2020.",

Scientists are therefore searching for novel natural alternatives to antibiotics. In this study Lactobacillus reuteri and a combination of reuterin and microcin J25 (RJ) were evaluated as promoters of growth and modulators of the cecal microbiota and metabolite profiles in broiler chickens. One-day-old Cobb 500 male broilers were distributed to 8 treatments: negative control (without antibiotic), positive control (bacitracin), three concentrations of RJ and three doses of L. reuteri plus glycerol. The birds (2176, 34 per pen, 8 pens per treatment) were reared for 35 d. RESULTS: The body weight of the bacitracin and 5 mmol/L reuterin combined with 0.08 μmol/L microcin J25 (10RJ) treatment group was significantly higher than that of the negative control group (P < 0.05). L. reuteri had no significant effect on broiler growth. MiSeq high-throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA showed clustering of cecal microbial operational taxonomic unit diversity according to treatment. The influence of bacitracin and 10RJ on bacterial community overall structure was similar. They promoted Ruminococcaceae, Lachnospiraceae and Lactobacillaceae, increased the relative abundance of Faecalibacterium and decreased the abundance of Bacteroides and Alistipes, while the negative control condition favored Bacteroidaceae and Rikenellaceae. Furthermore, 10RJ increased the concentration of short-chain fatty acid in the cecum and changed the metabolome overall. CONCLUSIONS: These overall suggest that 10RJ can promote a host-friendly gut environment by changing the cecal microbiome and metabolome. This combination of natural antimicrobial agents in the drinking water had a positive effect on broiler growth and may be suitable as an alternative to antibiotic growth promoters."

      "abstract": "Microalgae are natural sources of valuable bioactive compounds, such as polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), that show antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anticancer and antimicrobial activities. The marine microalga Isochrysis galbana (I. galbana) is extremely rich in ω3 PUFAs, mainly eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). Probiotics are currently suggested as adjuvant therapy in the management of diseases associated with gut dysbiosis. The Lactobacillus reuteri (L. reuteri), one of the most widely used probiotics, has been shown to produce multiple beneficial effects on host health. The present study aimed to present an innovative method for growing the probiotic L. reuteri in the raw seaweed extracts from I. galbana as an alternative to the conventional medium, under conditions of oxygen deprivation (anaerobiosis). As a result, the microalga I. galbana was shown for the first time to be an excellent culture medium for growing L. reuteri. Furthermore, the gas-chromatography mass-spectrometry analysis showed that the microalga-derived ω3 PUFAs were still available after the fermentation by L. reuteri. Accordingly, the fermented compound (FC), obtained from the growth of L. reuteri in I. galbana in anaerobiosis, was able to significantly reduce the adhesiveness and invasiveness of the harmful adherent-invasive Escherichia coli to intestinal epithelial cells, due to a cooperative effect between L. reuteri and microalgae-released ω3 PUFAs. These findings open new perspectives in the use of unicellular microalgae as growth medium for probiotics and in the production of biofunctional compounds.",

Depression is thought to be caused by a combination of genetic, environmental and psychological factors. However, the pathophysiology of depression remains unclear. In the present study, we found that Dcf1 knockout (KO) mice had depression-like symptoms and disruptive changes in gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) concentration and GABA receptor expression were found in the hippocampus of Dcf1 KO and WT mice. Furthermore, the gut microbiota composition of Dcf1 KO mice was significantly different from that of wildtype (WT) mice and Dcf1 KO mice showed lower Firmicutes and Lactobacillus content compared to WT mice. In addition, the depression-like behavior of Dcf1 KO mice was alleviated by the administration of microbiota. More surprisingly, after treatment with Lactobacillus murine and Lactobacillus reuteri, two Lactobacillus species with proportionally greater differences in content between the WT and KO groups, KO mice showed similar GABA content, as well as restored GABA-related receptor expression, as the WT group. Our data elucidated a possible mechanism of depression induction by gut microbiota in Dcf1 KO mice and provide a new avenue to explore the treatment of depression by gut microbiota.",

      "abstract": "Non-typhoidal Salmonella (NTS) can cause infection in poultry, livestock, and humans. Although the use of antimicrobials as feed additives is prohibited, the previous indiscriminate use and poor regulatory oversight in some parts of the world have resulted in increased bacterial resistance to antimicrobials, including cephalosporins and fluoroquinolones, which are among the limited treatment options available against NTS. This study aimed to isolate potential probiotic lactic acid bacteria (LAB) strains from the poultry gut to inhibit fluoroquinolone and cephalosporin resistant MDR Salmonella Typhimurium and S. Enteritidis. The safety profile of the LAB isolates was evaluated for the hemolytic activity, DNase activity, and antibiotic resistance. Based on the safety results, three possible probiotic LAB candidates for in vitro Salmonella control were chosen. Candidate LAB isolates were identified by 16S rDNA sequencing as Lactobacillus reuteri PFS4, Enterococcus faecium PFS13, and Enterococcus faecium PFS14. These strains demonstrated a good tolerance to gastrointestinal-related stresses, including gastric acid, bile, lysozyme, and phenol. In addition, the isolates that were able to auto aggregate had the ability to co-aggregate with MDR S. Typhimurium and S. Enteritidis. Furthermore, LAB strains competitively reduced the adhesion of pathogens to porcine mucin Type III in co-culture studies. The probiotic combination of the selected LAB isolates inhibited the biofilm formation of S. Typhimurium FML15 and S. Enteritidis FML18 by 90% and 92%, respectively. In addition, the cell-free supernatant (CFS) of the LAB culture significantly reduced the growth of Salmonella in vitro. Thus, L. reuteri PFS4, E. faecium PFS13, and E. faecium PFS 14 are potential probiotics that could be used to control MDR S. Typhimurium and S. Enteritidis in poultry. Future investigations are required to elucidate the in vivo potential of these probiotic candidates as Salmonella control agents in poultry and animal feed."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Psoriasis is a chronic autoinflammatory skin disease, and its aetiology remains incompletely understood. Recently, gut microbial dysbiosis is found to be tightly associated with psoriasis. OBJECTIVE: We sought to reveal the causal role of gut microbiota dysbiosis in psoriasis pathogenesis and investigate the protective effect of healthy commensal bacteria against imiquimod -induced psoriasis-like skin response. METHODS: By using fecal microbial transplantation (FMT), 16S rRNA gene-based taxonomic profiling and Lactobacillus supplement, we have assessed the effect of FMT from healthy individuals on psoriasis-like skin inflammation and associated immune disorders in imiquimod-induced psoriasis mice. RESULTS: Here, by using psoriasis mice humanized with the stools from healthy donors and psoriasis patients, the imiquimod-induced psoriasis in mice with psoriasis patient stool was found to be significantly aggravated as compared to the mice with healthy donor stools. Further analysis showed fecal microbiota of healthy individuals protected against Treg/Th17 imbalance in psoriasis. Moreover, we found the gut and skin microbiome in mice receipted with gut microbiota of healthy individuals (HD) differed from those of mice receipted with gut microbiota of psoriasis patients (PSD). 16S rRNA sequencing revealed that Lactobacillus reuteri was greatly enriched in fecal and cutaneous microbiome of HD mice as compared to PSD mice. Intriguingly, supplement with Lactobacillus reuteri was sufficient to increase the expression of anti-inflammatory gene IL-10, reduce Th17 cells counts and confer resistance to imiquimod-induced inflammation on the mice with gut microbiota dysbiosis. CONCLUSION: Our results suggested that the gut microbiota dysbiosis is the potential causal factor for psoriasis and the gut microbiota may serve as promising therapy target for psoriasis patients."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) remains a significant surgical emergency in neonates. We have demonstrated the efficacy of Lactobacillus reuteri (Lr) in protecting against experimental NEC when administered as a biofilm by incubation with maltose loaded dextranomer microspheres. Lr possesses antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties. We developed mutant strains of Lr to examine the importance of its antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties in protecting the intestines from NEC. METHODS: Premature rat pups were exposed to hypoxia/hypothermia/hypertonic feeds to induce NEC. To examine the importance of antimicrobial reuterin and anti-inflammatory histamine, pups received either native or mutant forms of Lr, in either its planktonic or biofilm states, prior to induction of NEC. Intestinal histology was examined upon sacrifice. RESULTS: Compared to no treatment, administration of a single dose of Lr in its biofilm state significantly decreased the incidence of NEC (67% vs. 18%, p < 0.0001), whereas Lr in its planktonic state had no significant effect. Administration of reuterin-deficient or histamine-deficient forms of Lr, in either planktonic or biofilm states, resulted in significant loss of efficacy. CONCLUSION: Antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory effects of Lr contribute to its beneficial effects against NEC. This suggests that both infectious and inflammatory components contribute to the etiology of NEC.",

This study aimed to evaluate the effects of non-viable Lactobacillus reuteri DSM17648 combining with 14-day standard triple therapy on H. pylori eradication. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two hundred treatment-naive H. pylori-positive adult patients were randomized equally to receive non-viable L. reuteri DSM17648 (LR group) or placebo for 4 weeks, with the latter 2 weeks treated together with triple therapy. The Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale (GSRS) was completed before and after treatment. Stool samples were collected for 16S rRNA gene sequencing at week0, week2, and week8. RESULTS: Eradication rates in the LR group and the placebo group were 81.8% and 83.7% in ITT analysis (p = 0.730), 86.2% and 87.2% in PP analysis (p = 0.830), respectively. After treatment, the mean GSRS score decreased significantly in the LR group as compared with the placebo group (1.9 ± 0.2 vs. 2.7 ± 0.3; p = 0.030). Significantly less patients in the LR group as compared with the placebo group reported abdominal distention (5.1% vs. 16.3%; p = 0.010) and diarrhea (11.1% vs. 23.5%; p = 0.022). The relative abundance of Proteobacteria phylum and Escherichia-Shigella genus in the placebo group was about 4.0-fold and 8.1-fold of that in the LR group at wk2, respectively. Significant changes of diversity and enhancements of Fusicatenibacter, Subdoligranulum, and Faecalibacterium were observed in the LR group compared with the placebo group. CONCLUSIONS: Supplementation of non-viable L. reuteri DSM17648 with triple therapy did not improve the eradication rate of H. pylori, but it helped to build up a beneficial microbial profile and reduced the frequencies of abdominal distention, diarrhea, and the GSRS score.",

METHODS: The study was conducted according to the PRISMA protocol. The databases used for acquiring data were PubMed and Web of Science, applying MeSH terms and free terms. Meta-analysis was conducted using Stata ™ 12.0. The risk of bias was evaluated by the Review Manager (RevMan) 5.3 tool, and the strength of evidence was assessed by the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE). RESULTS: Ten clinical trials were included in the review. The administration of L. reuteri (DSM 17938 or ATCC55730) was tested in infants (n = 248) versus the control/placebo group (n = 229). Eight articles were included in the meta-analysis. There was a significant response in reducing crying time (minutes/day) and treatment effectiveness (reduction ≥ 50% in average daily crying time) in the first week (p = 0.001 and p = 0.003, respectively). These results were similar in the second, third weeks (p < 0.001 for both outcomes) and fourth weeks (p<0.001 and p = 0.002, respectively). The risk of bias was low for the majority of the studies. Confidence in evidence was considered very low for crying time and low for effectiveness treatment. CONCLUSIONS: The evidence shows that the administration of Lactobacillus reuteri to babies fed with breast milk reduces the crying time in babies diagnosed with colic. But our confidence in the effect estimate is limited.",

METHODS: This RCT was conducted on 28 young adults who were undergoing orthodontic treatment. The short-term prospective clinical trial lasted for three weeks. The test group rinsed daily with drops containing two Lactobacillus reuteri strains diluted in water, while the placebo group used drops without probiotics. The subjects were enrolled eight months since the beginning of orthodontic treatment. Plaque-pH, saliva and dental biofilm samples were obtained at baseline, one week and three weeks post intervention. RESULTS: Twenty-seven subjects successfully completed the trial period, only one drop out in the test group. No side effects were reported. A statistically significant increase in plaque pH at three weeks post-intervention was found for the test group (p < 0.05), while insignificant changes in the pH value were found for the placebo group in comparison to baseline (p > 0.05). In addition, the AUC7.0 showed a significant difference at three weeks between the test and placebo (p = 0.00002). The three-week samples of stimulated whole saliva showed a statistically insignificant difference in the number of S. mutans and lactobacilli between the two groups (p > 0.05). The qPCR analysis showed the ability of the two strains to get colonized in the dental biofilm without a significant effect on the microbial counts. CONCLUSION/CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: A mixture of Lactobacillus reuteri has the ability to reduce the pH fall at the three-week follow-up. However, the short-term use of probiotics does not appear to have an effect on the number of salivary Streptococcus mutans and lactobacilli in saliva and on the dental biofilm.

Probiotics intervention can regulate the gut microbiota and relieve the systemic and chronic low-grade inflammation, which is an alternative to relieving metabolic syndrome. The aim of this work was to explore the alleviation of two different Lactobacillusreuteri strains on metabolic syndrome. Between the two L. reuteri strains, FYNLJ109L1 had a better improvement effect on blood glucose, blood lipid, liver tissue damage and other related indexes than NCIMB 30242. In particular, FYNLJ109L1 reduced weight gain, food intake and fat accumulation. Additionally, it can regulate the gut microbiota, increase IL-10, and reduce IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), as well as liver injury, and further reduce insulin resistance and regulate lipid metabolism disorders. In addition, it could modulate the gut microbiota, particularly a decreased Romboutsia and Clostridium sensu stricto-1, and an increased Acetatifactor. The results indicated that FYNLJ109L1 could improve metabolic syndrome significantly via alleviating inflammation and gut microbiota modulation."

Probiotics may be considered as a natural alternative therapy. We investigated antagonistic and immunomodulatory potential of intravaginally administered probiotic Lactobacillus reuteri-MT180537 against vaginal colonization by Enterococcus faecalis-MW051601 in mice. In vitro antimicrobial potential of lactic acid bacteria was determined against major pathogens of aerobic vaginitis. Moreover, in vivo prophylactic efficacy of L. reuteri-MT180537 against E. faecalis-MW051601 induced AV, in β-estradiol immunosuppressed mice was determined for the first time. Lactic acid bacteria displayed antibacterial activity against pathogens with zone of inhibition (11.33-20.00 mm) and co-aggregation (40-67%). Animals receiving L. reuteri-MT180537 followed by E. faecalis-MW051601 challenge exhibited significant reduction in clinical index, vaginal bacterial load, and histopathological changes in vaginal tissues compared to animals receiving E. faecalis-MW051601 only. L. reuteri-MT180537 upregulated expression of anti-inflammatory (Foxp3, IFN-γ) cytokines and resulted in controlling E. faecalis-MW051601 induced over expression of pro-inflammatory (IL-6, IL-1β) cytokines. Altogether, L. reuteri-MT180537 displayed antagonistic properties in vitro and prevented aerobic vaginitis by inhibiting the growth of E. faecalis-MW051601 and regulating expression of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines in mice.",

The present study aimed to investigate whether supplementation of Lactobacillus reuteri and Clostridium butyricum (LCs) had a protective effect on cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity through reconstruction of gut microbiota. Wistar rats were given different treatments: control, cisplatin (Cis), cisplatin + C. butyricum and L. reuteri (Cis+LCs), and C. butyricum and L. reuteri (LCs). We observed that cisplatin-treated rats supplemented with LCs exhibited significantly decreased renal inflammation (KIM-1, F4/80, and MPO), oxidative stress, fibrosis (collagen IV, fibronectin, and a-SMA), apoptosis, concentration of blood endotoxin and indoxyl sulfate, and increased fecal butyric acid production compared with those without supplementation. In addition, LCs improved the cisplatin-induced microbiome dysbiosis by maintaining a healthy gut microbiota structure and diversity; depleting Escherichia-Shigella and the Enterobacteriaceae family; and enriching probiotic Bifidobacterium, Ruminococcaceae, Ruminiclostridium_9, and Oscillibacter. Moreover, the LCs intervention alleviated the cisplatin-induced intestinal epithelial barrier impairment. This study indicated LCs probiotic serves as a mediator of the gut-kidney axis in cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity to restore the intestinal microbiota composition, thereby suppressing uremic toxin production and enhancing butyrate production. Furthermore, the renoprotective effect of LCs is partially mediated by increasing the anti-inflammatory effects and maintaining the integrity of the intestinal barrier.",

The aim of the present study is to assess the effect of probiotics on peri-implantitis microflora, by determining the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of Lactobacillus reuteri, that can be effectively administered as an antimicrobial agent on specific peri-implantitis pathogens. Hence, this study will be helpful in finding the MIC of L. Reuteri that can be effectively administered as an antimicrobial agent on specific peri-implantitis pathogens. METHODS: This experimental research was conducted on patients visiting the periodontology department in M. A. Rangoonwala college of dental sciences and research centre. Sub-gingival plaque samples were collected from peri-implantitis patients to identify various peri-implantitis microorganisms. The identified microorganisms were compared to each other and Chi-Square test was used to calculate statistical significance. The isolated microorganisms were subjected to the effect of probiotic Lactobacillus reuteri in-vitro. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was assessed using serial dilution method. RESULTS: The research results showed the presence of Porphyromonas gingivalis, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Prevotella intermedia, Streptococcus salivaris and Staphylococcus aureus in the subgingival samples from peri-implantitis patients. Statistically, significantly higher proportion of samples had Porphyromonas gingivalis. When subjected to the effect of L. reuteri, all the microorganisms were affected by L.reuteri except Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. CONCLUSION: This study provides the various MIC value for each isolated pathogen against L.reuteri. The authors recommend to avoid using standard guidelines for probiotic dose in the treatment of peri-implant infections as the antimicrobial profile is different for each periodontal pathogen.",

      "abstract": "Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a devastating disease affecting premature newborns with no known cure. Up to half of survivors subsequently exhibit cognitive impairment and neurodevelopmental defects. We created a novel probiotics delivery system in which the probiotic Lactobacillus reuteri (Lr) was induced to form a biofilm [Lr (biofilm)] by incubation with dextranomer microspheres loaded with maltose (Lr-DM-maltose). We have previously demonstrated that a single dose of the probiotic Lr administered in its biofilm state significantly reduces the incidence of NEC and decreases inflammatory cytokine production in an animal model of the disease. The aim of our current study was to determine whether a single dose of the probiotic Lr administered in its biofilm state protects the brain after experimental NEC. We found that rat pups exposed to NEC reached developmental milestones significantly slower than breast fed pups, with mild improvement with Lr (biofilm) treatment. Exposure to NEC had a negative effect on cognitive behavior, which was prevented by Lr (biofilm) treatment. Lr administration also reduced anxiety-like behavior in NEC-exposed rats. The behavioral effects of NEC were associated with increased numbers of activated microglia, decreased myelin basic protein (MBP), and decreased neurotrophic gene expression, which were prevented by administration of Lr (biofilm). Our data indicate early enteral treatment with Lr in its biofilm state prevented the deleterious effects of NEC on developmental impairments."
