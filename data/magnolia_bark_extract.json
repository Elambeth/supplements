      "abstract": "The effect of magnolia bark extract (MBE) on different variables related to caries and gingivitis administered daily through a sugar-free chewing gum was evaluated. The study was performed with healthy adult volunteers at high risk for caries as a randomized double-blind interventional study. 120 subjects with a salivary mutans streptococci (MS) concentration ≥10(5) CFU/ml and presence of bleeding on probing >25% were enrolled and divided into three groups: magnolia, xylitol and control. The study design included examinations at baseline, after 7 days, after 30 days of gum use and 7 days after the end of gum use. Plaque pH was assessed using the strip method following a sucrose challenge. Area under the curve (AUC(5.7) and AUC(6.2)) was recorded. Whole saliva was collected and the number of salivary MS (CFU/ml) was counted. Bleeding on probing was recorded as a proxy of dental plaque. Data were analyzed using ANOVA repeated measures. Magnolia gum significantly reduced plaque acidogenicity, MS salivary concentration and gingival bleeding compared to xylitol and control gums. Subjects from the magnolia and xylitol groups showed both MS concentration (p = 0.01 and 0.06, respectively) and AUC(5.7) (p = 0.01 and 0.04, respectively) to be significantly lower compared to baseline. Thirty-day use of a chewing gum containing MBE showed beneficial effects on oral health, including reduction of salivary MS, plaque acidogenicity and bleeding on probing.",

      "abstract": "Magnolia bark extract (MBE) has been used historically in traditional Chinese and Japanese medicines, and more recently as a component of dietary supplements and cosmetic products. The genotoxic potential of MBE was studied in two in vitro chromosomal aberration assays. In Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, exposure for 3 h to MBE at concentrations of 0-30 microg/ml in the absence of a metabolic activation system (S9) and 0-7 microg/ml with S9 did not induce chromosomal aberrations, whereas higher concentrations were cytotoxic and did not allow for analysis of aberrations. Extended exposure for 18 h without metabolic activation at concentrations up to 15 microg/ml also resulted in a negative response. In V79 cells derived from Chinese hamster lung tissue, treatment for 6h with concentrations up to 52 and 59 microg/ml in the absence and presence of S9, respectively, did not increase the incidence of chromosomal aberrations compared to negative controls. Furthermore, MBE exposure for 24 h without metabolic activation did not induce aberrations. The results of these studies demonstrate that MBE is not genotoxic under the conditions of the in vitro chromosomal aberration assays in CHO and V79 cells, and support the safety of MBE.",

      "abstract": "Flavors and natural botanic extracts are often used in chewing gum and compressed mints for breath freshening and relief of oral malodor. The oral malodor is a result of bacterial putrification of proteinaceous materials from food or saliva. In this study, magnolia bark extract (MBE) and its two main components, magnolol and honokiol, were evaluated by the minimum inhibition concentration (MIC) test. The inhibitory effect of MBE mint was further evaluated by a kill-time assay study. In addition, an in vivo study was performed on nine healthy volunteers postlunch. Saliva samples were taken before and after subjects consumed mints and gum, with and without MBE. Listerine mouthwash was included as a positive control. The testing results indicated that MBE and its two main constituents demonstrated a strong germ-kill effect against bacteria responsible for halitosis and also Streptococcus mutans, bacteria involved in dental caries formation. The MIC of magnolol, honokiol, and MBE on Porphyromonas gingivalis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and S. mutans ranged from 8 to 31 microg/mL. Kill-time assay results indicated that mints containing 0.2% MBE reduced more than 99.9% of three oral bacteria within 5 min of treatment. The in vivo study demonstrated that MBE containing mints reduced total salivary bacteria by 61.6% at 30 min and 33.8% at 60 min postconsumption. In comparison, the flavorless mint reduced total salivary bacteria by 3.6% at 30 min and increased total bacteria by 47.9% at 60 min. The MBE containing chewing gum reduced total salivary bacteria by 43.0% at 40 min, while placebo gum reduced total salivary bacteria by 18.0%. In conclusion, MBE demonstrated a significant antibacterial activity against organisms responsible for oral malodor and can be incorporated in compressed mints and chewing gum for improved breath-freshening benefits.",

      "abstract": "Magnolia bark has been traditionally used in Chinese and Japanese medicines, and its extract is a constituent of currently marketed dietary supplements and cosmetic products. The safety of magnolia bark extract (MBE) was assessed in short-term and subchronic studies. In a 21-day pilot study, rats were administered MBE at levels of 0, 60, 120, 240 or 480 mg/kg body weight (bw)/day in the diet. There were no treatment-related effects in clinical observations, macroscopic or microscopic findings, hematological, clinical chemistry, urinalysis, or organ weight measurements, and there were no deaths or significant differences in body weight and weight gain. In the 90-day study, rats were administered 0, 60, 120 or 240 mg MBE/kg bw/day in the diet. No mortality, ophthalmic abnormalities or treatment-related findings in clinical observations, hematology, coagulation or organ weight measurements were observed. There were no treatment-related macroscopic or microscopic findings. Differences between treated and control groups in body weight, weight gain, food consumption and utilization, clinical chemistry and urinalysis parameters were not considered toxicologically significant as they were not dose-related and/or because values remained within historical control ranges. These results support the safety of MBE for oral consumption.",

      "abstract": "AIM: Affective and behavioural disorders possibly concomitant to the vasomotor menopausal symptoms worsen quality of life. A rational formulation containing soy isoflavones (60 mg), lactobacilli (500 millions spores), calcium (141 mg) and vitamin D3 (5 microg) was added of Magnolia bark extract (60 mg) and magnesium (50 mg) (Estromineral serena, ES). The Magnolia extract active principles interact with GABA system and exhibit a sedative central action. Magnesium intervenes in enzymatic reactions of the energetic metabolism and protects the bone integrity. Aim of this controlled study was to compare the clinical activity and safety of ES versus calcium+vitamin D3 (Ca+D) in menopause. METHODS: A controlled, randomised, multicentre study was carried out in symptomatic menopausal women with sleep or mood alterations. Women received 1 tablet/day of ES or Ca+D for 24 weeks. Symptoms during the treatment and final judgements on efficacy and acceptability were evaluated. RESULTS: Eighty-nine women (44 ES and 45 Ca+D, mean age 53.8 years, in menopause since 56.6 months) participated to the study. Flushing, nocturnal sweating, palpitations, insomnia, asthenia, anxiety, mood depression, irritability, vaginal dryness, dyspareunia, and libido loss, significantly decreased in severity and frequency during ES versus Ca+D treatment even since the fourth week. Woman wellbeing (good/very good 66.7% vs 20%) judgement on efficacy (72.7% vs 17.1%) and acceptability (93.9% vs 31.4%) were significantly better for ES. CONCLUSIONS: The controlled study showed the efficacy of Magnolia extract and magnesium on psycho-affective and sleep disturbances in menopause, in addition to the effects of isoflavones on vasomotor symptoms. A global natural approach to menopause with ES evidenced its therapeutic usefulness and safety.",
