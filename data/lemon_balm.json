      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The collagen receptor Endo180 participates in extracellular matrix remodeling by clearing the pericellular environment and recognizing and internalizing collagen degradation products. In photoaged skin, Endo180 expression in fibroblasts is decreased, and collagen fragments accumulate in the pericellular environment, leading to a decrease in type I collagen production and an increase in matrix metalloproteinase 1 production. This suggests that a decrease in Endo180 production may promote wrinkle formation by decreasing the dermal collagen fibril volume. Therefore, this study aimed to identify materials that promote Endo180 production in vitro and investigate whether promoting Endo180 production could prevent and improve wrinkles in vivo. METHODS: Endo180 gene expression and protein production in fibroblasts were evaluated after screening 71 natural extracts. The conditioned medium of UVB-irradiated keratinocytes and Endo180 production-promoting extract were added to fibroblasts, and Endo180 and type I collagen production were evaluated. In a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study, a cream formulated with an Endo180 production-promoting extract or placebo was topically administered to each side of the face of 20 healthy women twice daily for 8 weeks. RESULTS: Screening results showed that 50 μg/mL of lemon balm (Melissa officinalis L.) leaf extract (MOLE) resulted in the highest levels of both Endo180 mRNA and protein at 178.1% and 127.4%, respectively. Its major component rosmarinic acid also promoted Endo180 production by 143.9% at a concentration of 20 μg/mL. MOLE at 200 μg/mL almost completely inhibited the decrease in Endo180 and type I collagen production in UVB-irradiated keratinocyte-conditioned medium. Furthermore, eye-corner wrinkles were reduced by treatment with the MOLE formulation compared to that in response to the placebo formulation. CONCLUSIONS: MOLE may act as an antiwrinkle agent that inhibits the decline in collagen levels by promoting Endo180 production.",

      "abstract": "Lemon balm (Melissa officinalis L.) is a valuable medicinal plant, but its growth can be significantly impacted by drought stress. This study aimed to mitigate the adverse effects of water deficit stress on lemon balm biomass by integrating poultry manure compost, poultry manure biochar, NPK fertilizer, Trichoderma harzianum, Thiobacillus thioparus, and elemental sulfur as soil amendments. The experiment was conducted in a greenhouse using a completely randomized design with a factorial arrangement, consisting of three replicates. It included a water deficit stress factor at three levels (95-100%, 75-80%, and 55-60% of field capacity) and a soil amendment treatment factor with eleven different fertilizer levels. Treatments included control (no amendment), NPK fertilizer, poultry manure compost, poultry manure biochar, and combinations of these with T. harzianum, T. thioparus, and elemental sulfur under various water deficit levels. Water deficit stress significantly reduced photosynthetic pigments, gas exchange parameters, chlorophyll fluorescence, relative water content, and antioxidant enzyme activity, while increasing membrane permeability and lipid peroxidation in lemon balm plants. However, the integrated application of organic, biological, and chemical amendments mitigated these negative impacts. The combined treatment of poultry manure compost, poultry manure biochar, NPK fertilizer, T. harzianum, T. thioparus, and elemental sulfur was the most effective in improving the morpho-physiological properties (1.97-60%) and biomass (2.31-2.76 times) of lemon balm under water deficit stress. The results demonstrate the potential of this holistic approach to enhance the resilience of lemon balm cultivation in water-scarce environments. The integration of organic, biological, and chemical amendments can contribute to sustainable agricultural practices by improving plant morphological and physiological properties and plant performance under drought conditions.",

The experiment followed a completely randomized block design with 9 treatments and 3 replications. The treatments consisted of (i) applying 100% N as the recommended fertilizer rate (RFR), (ii) applying 85% N as RFR, (iii) applying 70% N as RFR, (iv) applying 55% N as RFR, (v) the treatment ii combined with N-PNSB, (vi) the treatment iii combined with N-PNSB, (vii) the treatment iv combined with N-PNSB, (viii) 0% as RFR combined with N-PNSB, and (ix) 0% N as RFR. The results showed that applying N-PNSB increased the plant height, and the number of primary branches in both seasons. In addition, the treatment without N fertilizer combined with N-PNSB increased stem leaf biomass by 41.2 and 50.3% in both seasons as compared with the treatment without neither N fertilizer nor N-PNSB. For soil properties, among treatments without N fertilizer, the treatment with N-PNSB increased concentrations of NH4+, soluble P, and exchangeable K+ by 41.3, 41.4, and 26.8%, respectively, as compared with the treatment without N-PNSB at the end of the second season. Applying 85% N as RFR combined with N-PNSB had a greater yield by 5.78-11.8% as compared with the treatment with 100% N as RFR, and a greater EO content by 23% as compared with the treatment with 85% N as RFR.",

      "abstract": "ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Among the fewest drugs discovered are those belonging to the class of anxiolytics. Although some drug targets for anxiety disorders are established, it is hard to modify and selectively choose the active principle for those targets. Thus, the ethnomedical approach to treating anxiety disorders remains one of the most prevalent ways for (self)managing the symptoms. Melissa officinalis L. (lemon balm) has been extensively used as an ethnomedicinal remedy for the treatment of different psyche-related symptoms, especially dose related to restlessness. AIM OF THE STUDY: This work aimed to evaluate the anxiolytic activity, in several in vivo models, of the essential oil extracted from Melissa officinalis (MO) and its main constituent citronellal, a widespread plant utilized for managing anxiety. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In the present study several animal models were used to assess MO anxiolytic potential in mice. The effect of the MO essential oil applied in doses ranging from 12.5 to 100 mg/kg was estimated in light/dark, hole board, and marble burying tests. In parallel doses of citronellal corresponding to the ones in the MO essential oil were applied to animals to determine if this is the activity carrier. RESULTS: The results indicate that the MO essential oil exerts anxiolytic potential in all three experimental settings by significantly altering the traced parameters. The effects of citronellal are somewhat inconclusive and should not be interpreted only as anxiolytic but rather as a combination of anti-anxiety and motor-inhibiting effects. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, we could say that the results of the present study provide a base for future mechanistic studies that would evaluate the activity of M. officinalis essential oil on various neurotransmitter systems involved in the generation, propagation, and maintenance of anxiety.",

      "abstract": "The medicinal herb, lemon balm (Melissa officinalis L.), which is high in rosmarinic acid (RA), has well-known therapeutic value. The goals of this study were to investigate the effects of methyl jasmonate (MeJA) on RA content, total phenolic content (TPC), and total flavonoid content (TFC), as well as changes in expression of their biosynthesis-related key genes (MoPAL, Mo4CL, and MoRAS) in Iranian lemon balm ecotypes, as first reported. Our results revealed that MeJA doses significantly increase the RA content, TPC, and TFC in both ecotypes compared with the control samples. Additionally, the higher expression levels of MoPAL, Mo4CL, and MoRAS following treatment were linked to RA accumulation in all treatments for both Iranian lemon balm ecotypes. After 24 h of exposure to 150 µM MeJA concentration, HPLC analysis showed that MeJA significantly increased RA content in Esfahan and Ilam ecotypes, which was about 4.18- and 7.43-fold higher than untreated plants. Our findings suggested that MeJA has a considerable influence on RA, TPC, and TFC accumulation in MeJA-treated Iranian M. officinalis, which might be the result of gene activation from the phenylpropanoid pathway. As a result of our findings, we now have a better understanding of the molecular processes behind RA production in lemon balm plants.",

      "abstract": "This study was conducted to enhance the viability and alleviate the oxidative stress response using MO for sea bass during live transport. Six experimental groups were designed, and the effects of the physiological responses of MO were evaluated in comparison with MS-222 and eugenol. The physiological stress levels, proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK-9), antioxidant enzyme activities, and kidney parameters of blood serum were determined. It was found that cortisol level, glucose (Glu), lactic acid (LD), heat shock proteins (HSPs), catalase (CAT), myeloperoxidase (MPO), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), uric acid (UA), and urea nitrogen (BUN) in the MO-treated samples were lower than that of the control (133.72 ng/L); however, the total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC) was higher after 72 h of the simulated live transport. The ability to resist oxidative stress increased along with the increase in the MO concentration in the water during live transport, which was similar to the results of MS-222 and eugenol treatment. In conclusion, MO, acting as a kind of novel sedative and anesthetic, can be used to improve the oxidative system and survival rate during live transport. The results of this study provide a reference for enhancing animal welfare and anti-oxidative stress ability, reducing mortality and the stress response during live fish transport."

We utilized the in vitro and in vivo models of epilepsy to probe the anticonvulsant potentials of essential oil from M. officinalis (MO) to gain insight into the scientific basis for its applications in traditional medicine for the management of convulsive disorders. MO was evaluated for effects on maximal electroshock (MES) and pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) -induced seizures in mice, on 4-aminopyridine (4-AP)-brain slice model of epilepsy and sustained repetitive firing of current clamped neurons; and its ameliorative effects were examined on seizure severity, anxiety, depression, cognitive dysfunction, oxidative stress and neuronal cell loss in PTZ-kindled rats. MO reversibly blocked spontaneous ictal-like discharges in the 4-AP-brain slice model of epilepsy and secondary spikes from sustained repetitive firing, suggesting anticonvulsant effects and voltage-gated sodium channel blockade. MO protected mice from PTZ- and MES-induced seizures and mortality, and ameliorated seizure severity, fear-avoidance, depressive-like behavior, cognitive deficits, oxidative stress and neuronal cell loss in PTZ-kindled rats. The findings warrant further study for the potential use of MO and/or its constituent(s) as adjunctive therapy for epileptic patients."

      "abstract": "ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Besides psyche-related symptoms, patients with anxiety disorders can have a large number of somatic symptoms as well. Although the treatment of these disorders is mainly focused on resolving their mental component, one cannot neglect the need for the treatment of accompanying somatic symptoms. Melissa officinalis L. (lemon balm), in various formulations, has been extensively used as an ethnomedicinal remedy for the treatment of different psyche-related symptoms, and its use is considered relatively safe. AIM OF THE STUDY: In the present study, the activity of M. officinalis (MO) essential oil was evaluated in several in vitro and in vivo models mimicking or involving anxiety-related somatic symptoms. MATERIALS AND METHODS: To address the effect of MO essential oil on the gastrointestinal and heart-related symptoms accompanying anxiety disorders, in vitro models were utilized that follow the function of the isolated mouse ileum and atria tissues, respectively, after exposure to MO essential oil. Effects of MO essential oil on BALB/c mice motor activity was estimated using the open field, rota-rod, and horizontal wire tests. Additionally, the essential oil was assayed for its potential in inhibiting acetylcholinesterase activity. RESULTS: The performance of mice treated with 25 mg/kg of the oil showed a statistically significant decrease in the motor impairment arising from acute anxiety (open field test), while there was a prolonged latency and a reduction of the frequency of falling from a rotating rod and/or a horizontal wire (signs of muscle weakness/spasms). Concentrations of the essential oil higher than 1 μg/mL were found to inhibit both spontaneous and induced ileum contractions. Moreover, the essential oil and citronellal were found to decrease isolated mouse atria contraction frequency, as well as contraction force. However, the oil was found to be a very weak acetylcholinesterase inhibitor. CONCLUSION: The modulation of anxiety-related symptoms by the oil was found not to be mediated through the inhibition of the acetylcholinesterase, nonetheless, the mechanistic studies involving the ileum and cardiac tissues, revealed that the activity of MO and citronellal might be related to the modification of either voltage-gated Ca2+ channels or muscarinic receptors. Mice locomotion, balance, and muscle strength were not impacted by the essential oil; however, its main constituent, citronellal, was found to exert a certain degree of muscle function inhibition. All these results suggest that the activity of MO essential oil arises from synergistic and/or antagonistic interactions of its constituents, and is not completely dependent on the oil's main constituent.",

METHODS: We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Fifty-three adult intensive care unit (ICU) patients (according to ICU Confusion Assessment Method scores) who were treated for delirium received quetiapine and Neurogol syrup (a combination of valerian and lemon balm) or placebo 5 mL every 12 hours for five consecutive days. Improvement in agitation according to the Richmond Sedation and Restlessness Scale was considered the main outcome. RESULTS: The trial was completed for 53 patients (27 in the treatment group and 26 in the placebo group). The baseline characteristics between the groups were similar. In the treatment group, the number of agitated patients was significantly reduced and the difference was statistically significant (p = 0.000). Compared with the placebo group, the length of ICU stay in the treatment group was significantly reduced (p = 0.001). The Glasgow Coma Scale improved significantly at the end of day 5 (p = 0.04). There was no statistical difference in the improvement of delirium between the study groups (p = 0.14). Neurogol syrup was well tolerated. CONCLUSION: The addition of Neurogol to quetiapine (a combination of valerian and lemon balm) can reduce agitation and shorten the length of stay in the ICU without adverse effects. Clearly, more research is still needed to investigate the role of herbal medicines in ICUs and their efficacy and safety. HOW TO CITE THIS ARTICLE: Alikiaie B, Shahmoradi E, Yekdaneh A, Mousavi S.

However, the effects of MO intake have not yet been systematically reviewed. Therefore, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to evaluate the effect of MO intake and focused on several cardiometabolic outcomes. MEDLINE, Scopus, EMBASE, Web of Science and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched for MO-RCTs evaluating cardiometabolic outcomes. Random-effects meta-analyses estimated the pooled standardized mean differences (SMD) between intervention and control groups. Risk of bias was assessed with the Cochrane Collaboration's tool for assessing the risk of bias in RCTs. Seven RCTs were finally deemed eligible. MO intake was associated with a reduced total cholesterol (TC) (SMD: -0.26; 95% CI: -0.52, -0.01; I2 = 13.7%; k = 6) and a reduced systolic blood pressure (SBP) (SMD: -0.56; 95% CI: -0.85, -0.27; I2 = 00.0%; k = 3). MO intake was not associated with statistically significant changes in triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein, diastolic blood pressure, high sensitivity c-reactive protein levels, fasting blood sugar, HbA1c, insulin or high-density lipoprotein levels. No serious adverse events were reported. The risk of bias was high in a considerable amount of studies. Our study suggests that MO is a safe supplement with beneficial effects on TC and SBP. However, the findings of our study must be seen in the light of major limitations such as a low number of included studies and a serious risk of bias. High-quality RCTs are needed for firm conclusions concerning the effects of MO on cardiometabolic outcomes.",

      "abstract": "We investigated the effect of a 2:1 (w/w) mixture of lemon balm and dandelion extracts (LD) on ethanol (EtOH)-mediated liver injury and explored the underlying mechanisms. Administration of LD synergistically reduced relative liver weight and decreased the levels of serum biomarkers of hepatic injury. Histopathological and biochemical analyses indicated that LD synergistically attenuated hepatic accumulation of triacylglycerides (TGs) and restored the levels of mRNAs related to fatty acid metabolism. In addition, LD significantly reduced EtOH-induced hepatic oxidative stress by attenuating the reduction in levels of nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) mRNA and enhancing antioxidant activity. Moreover, LD decreased the EtOH-mediated increase in levels of hepatic tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) mRNA. In vitro, LD significantly scavenged free radicals, increased cell viability against tert-butylhydroperoxide (tBHP), and transactivated Nrf2 target genes in HepG2 cells. Furthermore, LD decreased levels of pro-inflammatory mediators in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated Raw264.7 cells. Therefore, LD shows promise for preventing EtOH-mediated liver injury. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: There were no approved therapeutic agents for preventing and/or treating alcoholic liver diseases. In this study, a 2:1 (w/w) mixture of lemon balm and dandelion leaf extract (DL) synergistically ameliorated EtOH-induced hepatic injury by inhibiting lipid accumulation, oxidative stress, and inflammation. Our findings will enable the development of a novel food supplement for the prevention or treatment of alcohol-mediated liver injury.",

      "abstract": "Stress is an increasing problem that can result in various psychiatric and somatoform symptoms. Among others, benzodiazepines and valerian preparations are used to treat stress symptoms. The aim of this study was to investigate whether the prescription of a fixed herbal extract combination of valerian, lemon balm, passionflower, and butterbur (Ze 185) changes the prescription pattern of benzodiazepines in hospitalized psychiatric patients. In a retrospective case-control study, anonymized medical record data from 3,252 psychiatric in-house patients were analysed over a 3.5-year period. Cases (n = 1,548) with a prescription of Ze 185 and controls (n = 1,704) were matched by age, gender, hospitalization interval, and main International Classification of Diseases, Version 10 F-diagnoses. The primary objective was to investigate the effect of Ze 185 on the prescription pattern of benzodiazepines. Secondary objectives investigated the prescriptions of concomitant drugs and effectiveness of the hospital stay. Distribution of drug classes was analysed using the WHO's anatomic-therapeutic-chemical code. Data showed that both treatment modalities had a comparable clinical effectiveness but with significantly less prescriptions of benzodiazepines in the Ze 185 group (p = .006). This is of clinical importance because suitable alternatives to benzodiazepines are desirable. To obtain more support for this hypothesis, a dedicated randomized, controlled clinical trial monitoring drug safety is required.",

Salicylic acid (SA) is an important signaling molecule which confers tolerance to metal toxicities but little is known about the mechanisms of SA-mediated alleviation of Hg stress. Here, physiochemical and molecular responses of Hg-stressed lemon balm (Melissa officinalis L.) to exogenous SA were investigated to reveal SA-induced tolerance mechanisms. The CHLG gene of lemon balm which encodes chlorophyll synthase was also partly isolated and sequenced for the first time. Hg stress markedly decreased growth, relative water content (RWC) and photosynthetic pigments of the plant. However, exogenous SA significantly mitigated the toxic effects of mercury on the growth and RWC and enabled plant to maintain chlorophylls to the similar levels of unstressed plants. Hg-induced oxidative damage was also reduced following treatment with SA and treated plants showed the lower extent of lipid peroxidation which was accompanied with the higher free proline and phenolics contents and elevation of the antioxidant capacity as evidenced by DPPH radical scavenging and FRAP assays. Moreover, SA treatment resulted in up-regulation of CHLG and phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) genes as key components of chlorophyll and phenylpropanoid routes, respectively. Our results collectively indicate the ameliorative effects of exogenous SA in mercury toxicity through coordinated alternations in plant metabolic processes which provide insights to better understand mechanisms of Hg tolerance in lemon balm plant.",

Drought stress is one of the major threats to plants which reduces the global agricultural productions. Here we demonstrated that light emitting diodes (LEDs)-driven tolerant to drought stress in lemon balm plantlets was highly correlated with priming with these lighting sources. Plantlets of the two genotypes of M. officinalis L. were first grown in 4 incubators with different LED lamps, including white LEDs (380-760 nm), blue LEDs (460 nm), red LEDs (650 nm) and red + blue LEDs (70%:30%), in a greenhouse for 4 weeks. The potted plants were then subjected to drought stress. Under drought stress, LED-primed plants maintained significantly higher fresh and dry weight, relative water content (RWC), concentration of soluble sugars, antioxidant activity and higher content of proline, H2O2, abscisic acid (ABA) and rosmarinic acid than non-primed plants. The results of Real-Time RT-PCR confirmed that LED pretreatment up-regulated the expression levels of respiratory burst oxidase homologues (RBOHs) or NADPH oxidase, 9-cis epoxy carotenoid dioxygenase (NCED), and rosmarinic acid synthase (RAS), while down-regulated that of ABA 8'-hydroxylase (ABA8Ox). These findings suggest, for the first time, that pre-treatment of plants with red + blue LEDs could improve their growth and quality under drought stress.",

This study addressed limitations in the literature to evaluate and compare effectiveness of Lavender and Lemon Balm essential oils on the agitated behaviour of older people with and without dementia living in residential aged care facilities [RACFs]. METHODS: Forty-nine nursing home residents with dementia (n=39) and without dementia (n=10) exhibiting agitation participated in this study. Participants were randomised to a counterbalanced, repeated measures design experiment that tests the treatments Lavender, Lemon Balm, and Placebo (Sunflower oil). Treatments were administered once daily for two-weeks followed by a two-week washout period before commencing the subsequent treatment. All participants trialed all three treatments over a 10-week period. Data were collected on the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) and Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory (CMAI). RESULTS: A significant difference was shown when essential oils effect were compared between the cognitive groups. Post hoc analysis reports Lemon Balm more effective in reducing NPI agitation (p = .04) and CMAI physical non-aggressive behaviour (PNAB) (p = .02) in residents without dementia. Lemon Balm less effective in reducing NPI irritability (p = 0.01) and Lavender more effective in reducing CMAI PNAB (p = 0.04) in dementia. CONCLUSION: The findings support an opposing effect of Lemon Balm and Lavender in reducing agitated behaviour between the participant cognitive groups. There was no reduction in agitation with treatments when compared to placebo independent of cognitive groups.",

In Persian Medicine (PM), the weakness of the main organs (heart, brain and liver) is one of the important causes of lack of sexual desire; hence, their strengthening is a priority during treatment. Melissa officinalis is one of the medicinal plants with tonic characteristics for the main organs in PM and was used for treatment in this study. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of M. officinalis in the improvement of HSDD in women. Eighty nine (89) eligible women suffering from decreased sexual desire were randomly assigned to groups. The participants received medication (500 mg of aqueous extract of M. officinalis) or placebo 2 times a day for 4 weeks. Changes in scores of desire, arousal, lubrication, orgasm, satisfaction and pain were evaluated at the end of 4 weeks of treatment using the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) questionnaire in the two groups. Forty three participants completed the study. The increase in desire (P < 0.001), arousal (P < 0.001), lubrication (P < 0.005), orgasm (P < 0.001), satisfaction (P < 0.001), pain (P < 0.002) and FSFI total score (P < 0.001) in the M. officinalis group was significantly more than that of the placebo group. The willingness to continue treatment was significantly higher in the M. officinalis as compared to the placebo group (P < 0.001). M. officinalis may be a safe and effective herbal medicine for the improvement of HSDD in women."

For three months water supply of 70% (control) and 40% (stress) of soil water capacity treatments have been adjusted in a pot experiment. Considering the morphological data, the different genetic potentials of cultivars were manifested only under optimum water regimes while under drought they merged into one homogeneous basic population representing the species. The biomass data decreased for all cultivars under drought stress, but the degree of loss was genotype specific. Genotype dependence of the change in essential oil accumulation was clearly proved by the data. Three of the cultivars ('Gold Leaf', 'Lorelei' and 'Quedlinburger Niederliegende') showed the same essential oil content both in control and stress treatments. Under drought stress the cultivar 'Lemona' produced only 35% of its essential oil content, however cv. 'Soroksár' reacted with 58% increase of essential oil accumulation to drought treatment. Considering the non-volatile bioactive compounds a unique response of the investigated accessions to drought stress was demonstrated. Cultivar 'Lorelei' showed an increased accumulation of total hydroxicinnamic acid derivatives content while cv. 'Gold Leaf' and 'Soroksár' clearly reacted with higher accumulation of total flavonoid fraction. In the case of cv. 'Quedlinburger Niederliegende' the remarkable decline in total flavonoid content is the most obvious stress reaction. The rosmarinic acid content of all genotypes showed lower accumulation level in consequence of lower water supply.",

Since visceral adipose tissue (VAT) is associated with development and progression of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), we hypothesized that angiogenesis inhibition would attenuate obesity-induced NAFLD. We fed C57BL/6J mice a low-fat diet (LFD, chow 10% kcal fat), a high-fat diet (HFD, 45% kcal fat) or HFD supplemented with the lemon-balm extract ALS-L1023 (HFD-ALS) for 15 weeks. ALS-L1023 reduced endothelial cell-tube formation in vitro. HFD increased VAT angiogenesis and induced weight gains including body weight, VAT mass and visceral adipocyte size compared with LFD. However, HFD-ALS led to weight reductions without affecting calorie intake compared with HFD. HFD-ALS also reduced serum ALT and AST levels and improved lipid metabolism. HFD-ALS suppressed steatosis, infiltration of inflammatory cells, and accumulation of collagen in livers. HFD-ALS modulated hepatic expression of genes involved in lipid metabolism, inflammation, fibrosis, antioxidation, and apoptosis. Concomitantly, analysis of VAT function revealed that HFD-ALS led to fewer CD68-positive macrophage numbers and lower expression of inflammatory cytokines compared with HFD. Our findings show that the anti-angiogenic herbal extract ALS-L1023 attenuates NAFLD by targeting VAT during obesity, suggesting that angiogenesis inhibitors could aid in the treatment and prevention of obesity-induced human NAFLD.",

The analyses were done on 0, 4, 7, 9, and 11 d of storage. Both LB and LD extracts proved effective in reducing most biogenic amines, with histamine reduced by 3-fold compared to control. The calculated biogenic amine index showed that LB extract was the most effective in inhibiting the biogenic amine formation. The reduction in total viable count was low and the bacterial contamination reached more than 7 log cfu/g at the end of the storage period for all the samples. Moreover, the reduction in fecal coliform and lactic acid bacterial count by LB and LD extracts was below 1 log cfu/g. Treatment of European anchovy with LB and LD extracts proved to be a very effective preservation technique to reduce the biogenic amine formation and lower the risk of histamine fish poisoning but is not effective in reduction of bacterial load. Consequently, LB and LD extracts could be used to reduce the biogenic amine formation which provides additional safety prior to spoilage for histamine sensitive fish species.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Melissa officinalis is a perennial herb from the Lamiaceae family which has shown to have modulating effects on serum lipid profile. The aim of the current study is to explore the effects of M. officinalis supplementation on serum biochemical parameters of patients with borderline hyperlipidemia. METHODS: 58 hyperlipidemic patients were allocated randomly to 2 groups: first group received capsules containing 1000mg M. officinalis leaf powder (MO group), and the second group received placebo capsules (P group) 3 times per day for 2 months. Fasting blood glucose (FBG), HDL, LDL, Triglyceride, Creatinine and liver function enzymes including AST and ALT were evaluated before and after study. RESULTS: The mean of LDL in MO group significantly decreased compared with P group after the supplementation (P=0.02). Although the level of Cholesterol, FBG, HDL, Triglyceride, Creatinine and ALT did not show significant difference between two groups after 2 months (P≥0.05), the level of AST exhibited a significant difference between two groups (P=0.009). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrated that M. officinalis supplementation as a rich source of antioxidants and bioactive compounds can be effective in remission of LDL and AST levels in patients with borderline hyperlipidemia.",

      "abstract": "AIM: The herbal preparation STW 5 contains fresh plant extracts from bitter candytuft whole plant, extracts from greater celandine herb, angelica root, lemon balm leaves, peppermint leaves, caraway fruit, liquorice root, chamomile flower and milk thistle fruit. We recently reported that STW 5 increased intestinal chloride secretion and proposed that this action may be involved in its clinical efficacy in the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome. The aim of this study was to identify the extracts responsible for the secretory action in order to provide the basis to develop novel target oriented herbal combinations. METHODS: We used the Ussing chamber voltage clamp technique to study the effects of individual extracts of STW 5 on short circuit current (Isc, reflecting electrogenic ion transport across epithelial cells) in mucosal/submucosal preparations of human small or large intestinal specimens and the human epithelial cell line T84. RESULTS: STW 5 at concentrations of 512 µg/ml and 5120 µg/ml evoked an increase in Isc. The increase at the lower concentration was due to pro-secretory effects of angelica which were nerve mediated. The increase at the higher concentration was additionally mimicked by peppermint and lemon balm. The remaining extracts did not influence ISC in the large intestine. The results were similar in T84 cells except that angelica had no effect while chamomile induced secretion. These pro-secretory effects were reduced by adenylate cyclase inhibitor MDL-12330A, cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) inhibitor CFTRinh-172 and calcium activated chloride channels blocker 4-acetamido-4-isothiocyanatostilbene-2,2-disulphonic acid (SITS). Liquorice decreased ISC only in small intestine which was reversed by the epithelial sodium channel blocker amiloride. CONCLUSIONS: Results suggested that the pro-secretory action of STW 5 is mainly due to angelica with lesser contribution of peppermint and lemon balm. Their effects involve activation of cAMP- and Ca(++)-activated Cl(-) channels. We suggest that peppermint, lemon balm and in particular angelica may be the basis to develop novel herbal preparations to specifically treat secretory disorder based on impaired epithelial secretion, such as constipation.",

We now examined whether treatment with a fixed combination of both may also improve concentration, hyperactivity and impulsiveness. METHODS: 169 primary school children suffering from hyperactivity and concentration difficulties but not meeting ADHS criteria were treated in an observational study by 27 office based pediatricians with a recommended daily dose of 640 mg valerian root extract WS(®) 1014 and 320 mg lemon balm extract WS(®) 1303 (Sandrin(®)), and evaluated by pediatricians and parents using standardized questionnaires at baseline, weeks 2 and 7. RESULTS: The fraction of children having strong/very strong symptoms of poor ability to focus decreased from 75% to 14%, hyperactivity from 61% to 13%, and impulsiveness from 59% to 22%. Parent rated social behavior, sleep and symptom burden showed highly significant improvements. Only in two children mild transient adverse drug reactions were observed. CONCLUSION: In primary school children with restlessness, concentration difficulties and impulsiveness treatment with WS(®) 1014 and WS(®) 1303 (Sandrin(®)) provides a viable option in addition to counseling and education.",

Lemon balm extract (LBE) showed the highest amount of total polyphenol (801.00 mg TAE/g DW) and flavonoids (65.05 mg RA/g DW). The IC50 value of DPPH hydroxyl scavenging of LBE was 132 μg/mL. The hamburger patties were prepared by 0% (N), 0.1% (L1), 0.5% (L2), and 1.0% (L3) of the lemon balm powder. The addition of lemon balm powder increased the chewiness value, but did not affect the hardness, cohesiveness, and springiness values. Lemon balm powder had positive effects on sensory evaluation of patties. The pH of all patties decreased with longer storage period. 2-Thiobarbituric acid value, volatile basic nitrogen content, and the total microbial counts of hamburger patties in the L3 group were lower, compared to those of the normal (N group). In conclusion, the L3 group had significantly delayed lipid peroxidation compared to other treatment groups. However, the addition of lemon balm powder into patties showed no significantly influence on proximate composition, calorie contents, water holding capacity and cooking loss of patties. Therefore, lemon balm might be a useful natural antioxidant additive in meat products."

Efficient strategies for prevention and treatment include dietary intervention and the development of validated nutraceuticals. Safe extracts of edible plants provide a resource of structurally diverse molecules that can effectively interfere with multifactorial diseases. In this study, we describe the application of ethanolic lemon balm (Melissa officinalis) leaves extract for the treatment of insulin-resistance and dyslipidemia in mice. We show that lemon balm extract (LBE) activates the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs), which have key roles in the regulation of whole body glucose and lipid metabolism. Application of LBE (0.6 mg/mL) to human primary adipocytes resulted in specific peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor target gene expression. LBE treatment of insulin-resistant high-fat diet-fed C57BL/6 mice (200 mg/kg/day) for 6 weeks considerably reduced hyperglycemia and insulin resistance, plasma triacylglycerol, nonesterified fatty acids and LDL/VLDL cholesterol levels. Taken together, ethanolic lemon balm extract can potentially be used to prevent or concomitantly treat type 2 diabetes and associated disorders such as dyslipidemia and hypercholesterolemia.",

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The behavioral effects of an acute or subacute (10-day course) orally administered M. officinalis (MO; 0, 30, 100 or 300 mg/kg) ethanol extract were evaluated in male and female Wistar rats in elevated plus-maze (EPM), forced swimming (FS) and open field (OF) tests. The effects of diazepam (DZP; 1 mg/kg) and fluoxetine (FXT; 10 mg/kg) were also assessed. RESULTS: In the EPM test, the percentage of open arm entries and open arm times of both males and females given the subacute M. officinalis ethanol extract were significantly higher than those of the vehicle-treated animals but were at levels similar to those observed in the DZP group, regardless of the treatment length. In the FS test, immobility duration was significantly lower in both males and females treated with the plant extract when compared to vehicle-treated counterparts. A 10-day treatment with FXT induced the same antidepressant response, regardless of gender, and was more effective than the M. officinalis extract. Male and female rats demonstrated distinct gender profiles, and treatment × gender interactions were observed. Locomotion in the EPM and OF tests was not significantly altered by treatments. CONCLUSION: The potential psychoactive properties of M. officinalis may provide a unique pharmacological alternative for certain psychiatric disorders; however, the efficacy appears to be dependent on both gender and administration length."

The anti-glycative activity of Lemon balm extract was evaluated in the bovine serum albumin (BSA)/glucose system. The level of glycation, conformational alterations and protein binding to RAGE receptors were assessed by specific fluorescence, Congo red binding assay, circular dichroism, ligand and Western blotting. Ethanol fractions of Melissa leaf exhibited the highest inhibitory effects on the formation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) and the late stage of glycation process. Significant alteration in the secondary structure of albumin was observed upon glycation, which was mitigated by applying the herb extract. Moreover, upon treatment with balm extract, glycated albumin adopts a secondary structure impeding its detection by RAGE receptors of microglial cells. Our results represent the anti-glycative properties of Melissa extract and its application for possible treatment of AGE-associated diseases."

(MOE) on cell proliferation and neuroblast differentiation in the hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) of middle-aged mice (12 months of age) using Ki67 and doublecortin (DCX), respectively. We also observed changes in corticosterone, GAD67 and GABA-transaminase (GABA-T) to check their possible mechanisms related to neurogenesis. We administered 50 or 200 mg/kg MOE to the animals once a day for 3 weeks. For labeling of newly generated cells, we also administered 5-bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) twice a day for 3 days from the day of the first MOE treatment. Administration of 50 or 200 mg/kg MOE dose-dependently increased Ki67 positive nuclei to 244.1 and 763.9% of the vehicle-treated group, respectively. In addition, 50 or 200 mg/kg MOE significantly increased DCX positive neuroblasts with well-developed (tertiary) dendrites. Furthermore, MOE administration significantly increased BrdU/calbindin D-28 k double labeled cells (integrated neurons into granule cells in the DG) to 245.2% of the vehicle-treated group. On the other hand, administration of MOE reduced corticosterone levels in serum and decreased GABA-T levels in the DG homogenates. These results suggest that MOE increases cell proliferation, neuroblast differentiation and integration into granule cells by decreasing serum corticosterone levels as well as by increasing GABA levels in the mouse DG.",

      "abstract": "The present study examined the antinociceptive effect of the ethanolic extract from Melissa officinalis L. and of the rosmarinic acid in chemical behavioral models of nociception and investigates some of the mechanisms underlying this effect. The extract (3-1000 mg/kg), given orally (p.o.) 1 h prior to testing, produced dose-dependent inhibition of acetic acid-induced visceral pain, with ID50 value of 241.9 mg/kg. In the formalin test, the extract (30-1000 mg/kg, p.o.) also caused significant inhibition of both, the early (neurogenic pain) and the late (inflammatory pain), phases of formalin-induced licking. The extract (10-1000 mg/kg, p.o.) also caused significant and dose-dependent inhibition of glutamate-induced pain, with ID50 value of 198.5 mg/kg. Furthermore, the rosmarinic acid (0.3-3 mg/kg), given p.o. 1 h prior, produced dose-related inhibition of glutamate-induced pain, with ID50 value of 2.64 mg/kg. The antinociception caused by the extract (100 mg/kg, p.o.) in the glutamate test was significantly attenuated by intraperitoneal (i.p.) treatment of mice with atropine (1 mg/kg), mecamylamine (2 mg/kg) or l-arginine (40 mg/kg). In contrast, the extract (100 mg/kg, p.o.) antinociception was not affected by i.p. treatment with naloxone (1 mg/kg) or D-arginine (40 mg/kg). It was also not associated with non-specific effects, such as muscle relaxation or sedation. Collectively, the present results suggest that the extract produced dose-related antinociception in several models of chemical pain through mechanisms that involved cholinergic systems (i.e. through muscarinic and nicotinic acetylcholine receptors) and the L-arginine-nitric oxide pathway. In addition, the rosmarinic acid contained in this plant appears to contribute for the antinociceptive property of the extract. Moreover, the antinociceptive action demonstrated in the present study supports, at least partly, the ethnomedical uses of this plant.",

Lemon balm has traditionally been used as an herbal remedy in the treatment of many medical conditions, including anxiety. Luteolin is a major component of the essential oil lemon balm. We divided 55 rats into 5 groups: (1) control (negative control), (2) luteolin, (3) midazolam (positive control), (4) flumazenil and luteolin, and (5) midazolam and luteolin. The behavioral component of anxiety was examined by using the elevated plus-maze (open arm time/total time) and motor movements. Data analyses were performed using a 2-tailed multivariate analysis of variance and Sheffé post hoc test. Our data suggest that luteolin does not produce anxiolysis by modulation of the GABAA receptor; however, luteolin may modulate motor movements and locomotion.",

The methanol extract was identified as a potent in vitro inhibitor of rat brain GABA transaminase (GABA-T), an enzyme target in the therapy of anxiety, epilepsy and related neurological disorders. Bioassay-guided fractionation led to the identification and isolation of rosmarinic acid (RA) and the triterpenoids, ursolic acid (UA) and oleanolic acid (OA) as active principles. Phytochemical characterization of the crude extract determined RA as the major compound responsible for activity (40% inhibition at 100 microg/mL) since it represented approximately 1.5% of the dry mass of the leaves. Synergistic effects may also play a role.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Aqueous extracts from leaves of well known species of the Lamiaceae family were examined for their potency to inhibit infection by human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). RESULTS: Extracts from lemon balm (Melissa officinalis L.), peppermint (Mentha x piperita L.), and sage (Salvia officinalis L.) exhibited a high and concentration-dependent activity against the infection of HIV-1 in T-cell lines, primary macrophages, and in ex vivo tonsil histocultures with 50% inhibitory concentrations as low as 0.004%. The aqueous Lamiaceae extracts did not or only at very high concentrations interfere with cell viability. Mechanistically, extract exposure of free virions potently and rapidly inhibited infection, while exposure of surface-bound virions or target cells alone had virtually no antiviral effect. In line with this observation, a virion-fusion assay demonstrated that HIV-1 entry was drastically impaired following treatment of particles with Lamiaceae extracts, and the magnitude of this effect at the early stage of infection correlated with the inhibitory potency on HIV-1 replication. Extracts were active against virions carrying diverse envelopes (X4 and R5 HIV-1, vesicular stomatitis virus, ecotropic murine leukemia virus), but not against a non-enveloped adenovirus. Following exposure to Lamiaceae extracts, the stability of virions as well as virion-associated levels of envelope glycoprotein and processed Gag protein were unaffected, while, surprisingly, sucrose-density equilibrium gradient analyses disclosed a marked increase of virion density. CONCLUSION: Aqueous extracts from Lamiaceae can drastically and rapidly reduce the infectivity of HIV-1 virions at non-cytotoxic concentrations. An extract-induced enhancement of the virion's density prior to its surface engagement appears to be the most likely mode of action. By harbouring also a strong activity against herpes simplex virus type 2, these extracts may provide a basis for the development of novel virucidal topical microbicides.",

Patients were dosed individually by the investigators. In total, 918 children were evaluated for therapeutic efficacy and tolerability. A distinct and convincing reduction in severity was found for all symptoms in the investigators' and parents' ratings. The core symptoms dyssomnia and restlessness were reduced from \"moderate/severe\" to \"mild\" or \"absent\" in most of the patients. In total, 80.9% of the patients who suffered from dyssomnia experienced an improvement for this symptom and 70.4% of the patients with restlessness improved clearly. For the other listed symptoms the total improvement was 37.8% on average. Both, parents and investigators assessed efficacy as to be \"very good\" or \"good\" (60.5% and 67.7%, respectively). The tolerability of Euvegal forte was considered as \"good\" (in 96.7% of the patients it was judged to be \"very good\" or \"good\"). No study medication-related adverse events occurred. In conclusion, Euvegal forte was effective in the treatment of younger children with restlessness and dyssomnia and it was very well tolerated.",

      "abstract": "Melissa officinalis (Lemon balm) is a herbal medicine that has traditionally been attributed with memory-enhancing properties, but which is currently more widely used as a mild sedative and sleep aid. In a previous study it was demonstrated that a commercial Melissa extract led to dose-specific increases in calmness, and dose-dependent decrements in timed memory task performance. However, the extract utilized in that study did not exhibit in vitro cholinergic receptor-binding properties. The current study involved an initial screening of samples of M. officinalis for human acetylcholinesterase inhibition and cholinergic receptor-binding properties. The cognitive and mood effects of single doses of the most cholinergically active dried leaf were then assessed in a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, balanced crossover study. Following the in vitro analysis, 20 healthy, young participants received single doses of 600, 1000, and 1600 mg of encapsulated dried leaf, or a matching placebo, at 7-day intervals. Cognitive performance and mood were assessed predose and at 1, 3, and 6 h postdose using the Cognitive Drug Research computerized assessment battery and Bond-Lader visual analog scales, respectively. In vitro analysis of the chosen extract established IC(50) concentrations of 0.18 and 3.47 mg ml(-1), respectively, for the displacement of [(3)H]-(N)-nicotine and [(3)H]-(N)-scopolamine from nicotinic and muscarinic receptors in the human cerebral cortex tissue. However, no cholinesterase inhibitory properties were detected. The most notable cognitive and mood effects were improved memory performance and increased 'calmness' at all postdose time points for the highest (1600 mg) dose. However, while the profile of results was overwhelmingly favorable for the highest dose, decrements in the speed of timed memory task performance and on a rapid visual information-processing task increased with decreasing dose. These results suggest that doses of Melissa officinalis at or above the maximum employed here can improve cognitive performance and mood and may therefore be a valuable adjunct in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. The results also suggest that different preparations derived from the same plant species may exhibit different properties depending on the process used for the sample preparation.",
