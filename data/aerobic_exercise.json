      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to examine the effectiveness of brief aerobic exercise on patients diagnosed with hyperlipidemia. METHODS: Seventy patients diagnosed with hyperlipidemia were enrolled from community health centers between May 2023 and October 2023. They were randomly assigned into two groups: test and control group, each consisting of 35 patients. The test group received personalized exercise recommendations along with routine medication, while the control group only received routine medication. The effectiveness of the intervention was assessed after 3 months. Various indicators including blood pressure, lipid levels, changes in cardiopulmonary function, 6-minute walk distance (6MWD) test results, the percentage of 6MWD relative to the predicted value (6MWD%Pred), copeptin (CPP), and fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) were compared, before and after the intervention within each group and between the two groups. RESULTS: After 3 months of personalized exercise, the test group showed significantly higher levels in three indicators compared to the control group. Specifically, the test group exhibited higher metabolic equivalent (MET) values [(  x ¯    ± SD, 4.6 ± 0.27 METs) vs. (  x ¯    ± SD, 3.8 ± 1.06 METs); P < 0.05], longer 6-minute walk distance (6MWD) [(  x ¯    ± SD, 488.08 ± 40.59 meters) vs. (  x ¯    ± SD, 366.76 ± 160.49 meters); P < 0.05], and a higher percentage of 6MWD relative to the predicted value (6MWD %Pred) [(  x ¯    ± SD, 92.8 ± 14.05) vs. (  x ¯    ± SD, 71.3 ± 30.69); P < 0.05]. Additionally, within the test group, there was a significant increase in MET, 6MWD, and 6MWD%Pred compared to baseline (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Short-term aerobic exercise shows significant improvement in the cardiopulmonary function of patients with hyperlipidemia. However, it did not exhibit significant efficacy in managing hyperlipidemia."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Individuals with spinal cord injury (SCI) face heightened cardiovascular disease (CVD) risks. While general exercise guidelines are promoted for SCI individuals, when and how to incorporate exercise during the subacute phase post-SCI remains unclear. Consequently, early aerobic exercise to reduce CVD risks is not standard practice in subacute SCI care, potentially missing an opportunity for optimal cardiovascular rehabilitation, especially given observed reductions in cardiac structure and function within the first year post-SCI. Addressing this gap could improve long-term cardiovascular health and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) for individuals with SCI. Early intervention might prevent worsening cardiovascular function and establish beneficial exercise habits. However, few studies have evaluated the effectiveness of early exercise interventions in this population. This study aims to provide insight into the impact of moderate-intensity arm-crank exercise training (ACET) on cardiometabolic, HRQOL, functional and fitness parameters in individuals with subacute (<12 months postinjury) SCI. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We will conduct a single-centre, two-group, single-blind randomised controlled trial with 42 participants who have sustained a cervical or thoracic SCI within the past year. The non-intervention group will receive hospital standard of care (control group) while the intervention group will receive hospital standard of care plus moderate-intensity ACET for 10 weeks in line with the SCI-specific exercise guidelines to improve cardiometabolic health. The primary outcome measure will be central arterial stiffness (carotid-to-femoral pulse wave velocity). Secondary outcomes include assessments of (1) blood biomarkers linked to CVD, (2) cardiac structure and function, (3) extracranial vasculature, (4) HRQOL, (5) cognitive function, (6) physical activity level, (7) cardiorespiratory fitness, (8) motor function and (9) feasibility outcomes. Assessments will occur at baseline (rehabilitation centre admission, -2 weeks), preintervention (0 weeks), postintervention (10 weeks) and follow-up (6 months after postintervention), for HRQOL outcomes only. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval was obtained from the Wales Research Ethics Committee (HREC 22/WA/0329). Outcome data will be presented at international conferences, patient advocacy groups, health professional networks and community health events. Findings will be published in peer-reviewed journals and widely disseminated through strategic channels to reach researchers, healthcare providers, patients and the public.

      "abstract": "Objective: This study aimed to evaluate the effects of eight weeks of aerobic exercise and spirulina supplementation on liver enzymes, body composition, and cardiorespiratory fitness in overweight and obese women. Methods: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted involving 36 overweight and obese adult women (body mass index [BMI] ≥ 25 kg/m2, aged 25-40 years) randomly assigned to four groups: placebo with aerobic exercise, spirulina with aerobic exercise, spirulina-only, and placebo-only. Interventions included aerobic training three times per week (40-50 minutes/session) and a twice-daily dose (each 500 mg) of Spirulina or placebo for eight weeks. Outcomes were assessed at baseline and post-intervention, including liver enzyme levels (alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP), body composition (BMI, body fat percentage, waist-to-hip ratio (WHR)), and VO2max using validated protocols. Results: Significant within-group improvements in ALT, AST, body weight, BMI, WHR, and VO2max were observed in the aerobic training and spirulina groups, either alone or combined (p < .001). The aerobic training + placebo group demonstrated the greatest reduction in body weight and BMI, while spirulina-alone showed significant ALT and AST reductions. VO2max improved in all intervention groups, but post hoc analysis revealed no significant between-group differences. Conclusion: Aerobic exercise and spirulina supplementation independently and synergistically improve liver function, body composition, and cardiorespiratory fitness in overweight and obese women. Combining these interventions may offer a holistic approach to managing obesity-related health risks. Further research is essential to elucidate the underlying mechanisms and optimize intervention strategies for diverse populations."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease which significantly and negatively affects families and society. Aerobic exercise serves as a non-pharmacological strategy, potentially safeguarding against cognitive decline and lowering the risk of AD. However, how aerobic exercise ameliorates AD remains unknown. This study investigated the effects of two types of aerobic exercise, including aerobic interval training (AIT) and aerobic continuous training (ACT), on cognitive and exploratory function, brain histopathology, and hepatic amyloid beta (Aβ) clearance in amyloid precursor protein/presenilin-1 double transgenic (APP/PS1) transgenic mice. METHODS: Twenty-four six-month-old male APP/PS1 transgenic mice (body weight: 20-22 g) were used to establish the AD model. APP/PS1 transgenic mice were randomly assigned to one of the three groups: rest (AD group, n = 8), aerobic interval training (AIT group, n = 8), and aerobic continuous training (ACT group, n = 8). The exploration ability and anxiety of AD mice were measured using the open-field test. Learning and memory of AD mice were detected using the novel object recognition test, Y-maze test, and Morris water maze test. Neuronal damage was analyzed using hematoxylin and eosin staining and Nissl staining. Aβ deposition in the brain was detected using a thioflavin-S fluorescence assay and immunofluorescence. The mechanisms underlying hepatic Aβ clearance were investigated using an immunofluorescence assay and western blotting. Data were analyzed using one-way ANOVA with Tukey's post hoc test, and p < 0.05 was deemed statistically significant. RESULTS: The results revealed that both AIT and ACT improved the recognition memory and exploration ability of mice after 8 weeks of intervention. Additionally, both forms of aerobic exercise significantly mitigated neuronal damage and Aβ deposition in the brain and improved the hepatic clearance of Aβ. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicated that AIT and ACT can improve cognitive deficits in APP/PS1 mice, potentially by increasing the hepatic phagocytic capacity of Aβ. Hepatic clearance of Aβ may serve as a supplementary mechanism by which aerobic exercise can improve AD.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Physiological and metabolic processes are influenced by biological rhythms. However, whether exercising in the morning or evening is more beneficial, given that these periods are two key time windows to incorporate exercise, has remained unclear. This study aimed to investigate the effects of morning versus evening exercise on weight loss, morphometric indicators, and physical fitness among Chinese college students with overweight and obesity. METHODS: A total of 31 students with overweight and obesity (18-22 years old) were randomly assigned to exercise in the morning (7 am to 10 am, n = 16) or evening (6 pm to 9 pm, n = 15). The morning exercise group had an average age of 19.69 ± 1.01 years and a body mass index (BMI) of 27.13 ± 2.66 kg/m². The evening group had an average age of 19.47 ± 0.99 years and a BMI of 27.91 ± 3.40 kg/m². In the morning group, 87.5% of participants were male, while 73.3% were male in the evening group. The intervention was aerobic running exercise for 60 min, five times a week for 10 weeks. Measurements were taken before and after the 10-week intervention. RESULTS: The BMI values of male and female college students were significantly and positively associated with vital capacity (p < 0.001) and significantly and negatively associated with vital capacity weight index, 50-meter, 800-/1,000-meter, standing long jump, and chin-ups and sit-ups test performances (p < 0.001). Participants who trained in the morning showed significant reductions in minimum waist circumference (MWC) (p = 0.043, d = 0.77), scapular skinfold thickness (ST) (p = 0.002, d = 1.30) and upper arm ST (p = 0.006, d = 1.05) compared with those who trained in the evening. CONCLUSIONS: Exercise in the morning, compared with that in the evening, has superior beneficial effects on weight loss and improving body shape in Chinese college students living with overweight and obesity.

The burgeoning therapeutic potential of aerobic exercise has gained prominence as a leading non-pharmacological strategy, with evidence supporting its effectiveness in alleviating anxiety across diverse conditions. This review synthesizes current research to clarify the molecular mechanisms through which aerobic exercise ameliorates anxiety in terms of the effects of exercise on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, the hepatic-brain axis and epigenetics; electroencephalographic alterations; inflammatory pathways; the balance between oxidative and nitrogenous stress; various substances, such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), and opioid peptides; and the 5-HT2C receptor and cannabinoid receptor type-1 (CB1R), among others, reflecting the positive modulatory effects of aerobic exercise on anxiety. As a non-pharmacological intervention, aerobic exercise has been demonstrated to be useful in a variety of medical applications and has considerable potential for ameliorating symptoms of anxiety."

Exercise could provide a healthy alternative treatment for insomnia, particularly if it could be shown to have comparable efficacy to sleeping pills. Objective  The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of acute exercise versus zolpidem on chronic insomnia. Methods  Seventeen participants with chronic insomnia (recruited from advertisements) participated in a parallel randomized controlled trial (exercise, n  = 9; zolpidem, n  = 8). Participants in the exercise treatment performed treadmill exercise for 50 minutes, at 50% of heart rate reserve, between 11 am and 2 pm . Participants in the zolpidem treatment received a 10 mg dose of zolpidem immediately before bedtime. Following baseline and following the treatment, sleep measures included sleep diary, polysomnography, and actigraphy. Treatments were compared with non-inferiority analysis, ANOVA, and effect sizes. Results  Non-inferiority of exercise relative to zolpidem was observed for polysomnographic measurement of sleep latency. For all other comparisons, the non-inferiority was inconclusive. Significant treatment-by-time interactions were observed for N3 sleep ( p  = 0.04) and REM sleep ( p  = 0.03). No other significant treatment-by-time effects were observed. Subjective sleep duration and sleep efficiency, and polysomnographic measurement of sleep efficiency were significantly increased after zolpidem and exercise. The effect size between groups was small for these variables. Conclusion  Exercise impacted sleep in a similar way to zolpidem in participants with chronic insomnia. Considering the far superior health benefits of exercise, further research addressing this question is warranted."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Obesity threatens human health, and interventions to reduce obesity may have important effects on the gut microbiota. This study investigated alterations in gut microbial composition in response to aerobic exercise (AE) and intermittent fasting (IF). METHODS: We randomly divided mice into four groups of seven mice each: normal, obesity, exercise, and fasting. The normal group was fed a Chow Diet, whereas the other three groups were fed a High Fat Diet (HFD). After 13 weeks, the exercise group was subjected to aerobic treadmill running, and the fasting group started IF for 8 weeks. We then analyzed the composition of the fecal microbiome in all mice at the end of 21 weeks. RESULTS: Our investigation revealed that the HFD significantly influenced species (s)_Romboutsia ilealis, genus (g)_Dubosiella, and g_Blautia. AE predominantly affected family (f)_Rhizobiaceae and g_Rikenella, indicating its impact on enhancing microbial taxa associated with improved metabolic health profiles. On the other hand, IF prominently altered the abundance of s_Lactobacillus johnsonii and g_Colidextribacter, which are known for their roles in enhancing glucolipid metabolism and anti-inflammatory activity. Furthermore, the exercise group displayed increased diversity within f_Rhizobiaceae, potentially associated with anti-inflammatory benefits. The IF intervention was particularly effective in enriching s_Lactobacillus johnsonii, suggesting its pivotal role in regulating metabolic responses influenced by fasting. CONCLUSION: The results demonstrated significant beneficial alterations in microbial composition following AE and IF interventions, which supports the use of personalized approaches for obesity management and overall health.",

      "abstract": "Objective: Prolonged microgravity environments impair skeletal muscle homeostasis by triggering fiber-type transitions and metabolic dysregulation. Although exercise and nutritional interventions may alleviate disuse atrophy, their synergistic effects under microgravity conditions remain poorly characterized. This study investigated the effects of an 8-week ketogenic diet combined with aerobic exercise in hindlimb-unloaded mice on muscle fiber remodeling and metabolic adaptation. Methods: Seven-week-old male C57BL/6J mice were randomly divided into six groups: normal diet control (NC), normal diet with hindlimb unloading (NH), normal diet with hindlimb unloading and exercise (NHE), ketogenic diet control (KC), ketogenic diet with hindlimb unloading (KH), and ketogenic diet with hindlimb unloading and exercise (KHE). During the last two weeks of intervention, hindlimb unloading was applied to simulate microgravity. Aerobic exercise groups performed moderate-intensity treadmill running (12 m/min, 60 min/day, and 6 days/week) for 8 weeks. Body weight, blood ketone, and glucose levels were measured weekly. Post-intervention assessments included the respiratory exchange ratio (RER), exhaustive exercise performance tests, and biochemical analyses of blood metabolic parameters. The skeletal muscle fiber-type composition was evaluated via immunofluorescence staining, lipid deposition was assessed using Oil Red O staining, glycogen content was analyzed by Periodic Acid-Schiff (PAS) staining, and gene expression was quantified using quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR). Results: Hindlimb unloading significantly decreased body weight, induced muscle atrophy, and reduced exercise endurance in mice. However, the combination of KD and aerobic exercise significantly attenuated these adverse effects, as evidenced by increased proportions of oxidative muscle fibers (MyHC-I) and decreased proportions of glycolytic fibers (MyHC-IIb). Additionally, this combined intervention upregulated the expression of lipid metabolism-associated genes, including CPT-1b, HADH, PGC-1α, and FGF21, enhancing lipid metabolism and ketone utilization. These metabolic adaptations corresponded with improved exercise performance, demonstrated by the increased time to exhaustion in the KHE group compared to other hindlimb unloading groups. Conclusions: The combination of a ketogenic diet and aerobic exercise effectively ameliorates simulated microgravity-induced skeletal muscle atrophy and endurance impairment, primarily by promoting a fiber-type transition from MyHC-IIb to MyHC-I and enhancing lipid metabolism gene expression (CPT-1b, HADH, and PGC-1α). These findings underscore the potential therapeutic value of combined dietary and exercise interventions for mitigating muscle atrophy under simulated microgravity conditions."

To investigate the relationship between exercise and CRC progression, we conducted a prospective cohort study to analyze the impact of acute aerobic exercise on serum protein profiles in CRC patients. METHODS: Serum samples from 10 CRC patients were collected and analyzed using proteomics following either no exercise or acute aerobic exercise. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was employed to identify protein modules associated with exercise. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) analysis was further conducted to pinpoint key proteins influenced by exercise. Western blotting was used to validate the expression changes of identified proteins. RESULTS: WGCNA revealed that the blue module exhibited the highest correlation with 42 serum protein, 27 of which showed significant changes post-exercise compared with pre-exercise. PPI analysis identified ARF6, ARF5, and RAB11A as the core proteins. Western blotting further confirmed that their expression levels were significantly reduced in the post-exercise group, making them key targets in current clinical treatment protocols. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that acute aerobic exercise alters the serum protein profile in CRC patients, with significant reductions in ARF6, ARF5, and RAB11A representing the most meaningful changes. These findings provide strong evidence supporting the use of acute aerobic exercise as a therapeutic intervention for CRC."

However, there is a large inter-individual variation in muscle fiber hypertrophy following resistance exercise training. It has been hypothesized that a less than optimal muscle fiber capillarization and perfusion capacity may compromise muscle hypertrophy during resistance exercise training in older adults. OBJECTIVE: We assessed whether 8 weeks of aerobic exercise preconditioning, to improve muscle fiber capillarization and perfusion capacity, augments the gains in muscle mass and strength during subsequent resistance exercise training in older adults. METHODS: In total, 34 healthy older males and females (71 years standard deviation (SD) ± 5 years) participated in 12 weeks of progressive resistance exercise training, preceded by either 8 weeks of aerobic preconditioning (AER, n = 17) through cycle-ergometer endurance training, or a no exercise control condition (CON, n = 17). Muscle strength (one repetition maximum (1RM)) and muscle fiber characteristics (histochemistry) were assessed at baseline, following 8 weeks of AER or CON, and after 12 weeks of resistance exercise training. Femoral artery blood flow and vastus lateralis muscle microvascular perfusion kinetics were assessed at baseline and following 8 weeks of AER or CON intervention. Thigh muscle volume (magnetic resonance imaging scan) was assessed before and after the 12 weeks of resistance exercise training. RESULTS: Aerobic exercise preconditioning increased type I (+ 19 ± 19%, P < 0.05) and type II (+ 35 ± 37%, P < 0.05) muscle capillary-to-fiber ratio, with no changes in the CON group (type I: + 0 ± 17%; type II: - 3 ± 26%). Muscle microvascular perfusion following a submaximal resistance exercise stimulus was reduced following aerobic exercise preconditioning, whereas no changes were observed in the CON group (interaction effect, P = 0.051). Resistance exercise training increased leg press 1RM (+ 16 ± 10% versus + 12 ± 8%, respectively, P < 0.001) and thigh muscle volume (+ 0.42 ± 0.69 versus + 0.31 ± 0.62 L, respectively, P < 0.001) in both the AER and CON groups, with no differences between the groups. No differences were observed in type I and type II muscle fiber hypertrophy in response to the entire intervention program between groups (interaction effect, P > 0.5). CONCLUSIONS: Aerobic exercise preconditioning increases type I and type II muscle fiber capillarization in healthy older adults. Aerobic exercise preconditioning does not further increase muscle hypertrophy during subsequent resistance exercise training in healthy older adults. Both structural and functional microvascular characteristics do not seem to restrict the skeletal muscle adaptive response to resistance-type exercise training in healthy older adults."

      "abstract": "Better social, emotional, and financial functioning are associated with improved health outcomes in older adults. While the literature supports a positive relationship between physical activity and increased functional ability in older adulthood, the intensity of physical activity necessary to achieve these gains remains uncertain. To address this gap, the current analysis uses data collected as part of a larger randomized controlled trial to examine the effects of a supervised exercise intervention on measures of social, emotional, and financial functioning. Healthy older adults (n = 211) completed baseline assessments including cardiovascular fitness and health and functioning measures and were randomly assigned to 16 weeks of either: (1) low intensity continuous training (LICT); or (2) moderate intensity continuous training + interval training (MICT + IT). Participants across exercise conditions reported a significant decrease from baseline to post-intervention in depression [F(1, 158) = 22.17, p < .001] and instrumental risk taking [F(1, 157) = 6.72, p < .05]. Further, participants assigned to the MICT + IT condition showed significantly greater improvements in loneliness relative to those in the LICT condition [F(1, 157) = 5.99, p < .05]. By and large, healthy older adults experienced some improvements in functional ability after 16 weeks of exercise. Though most changes were not related to the intensity of exercise condition, associations between increased cardiovascular fitness and both depression and anxiety suggest that exercising at an intensity that improves fitness may confer greater benefits in some domains.Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02068612."

      "abstract": "Cognitive dysfunction is a common and debilitating complication following ischemic stroke, significantly impairing the quality of life of patients. In recent years, aerobic exercise has emerged as a promising non-pharmacological intervention to mitigate post-stroke cognitive impairment (PSCI). This review synthesizes current evidence on the efficacy and mechanisms of aerobic exercise in enhancing cognitive recovery after ischemic stroke. Key mechanisms include improved cerebral hemodynamics through enhanced cerebral blood flow (CBF), promotion of neuroplasticity via brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)-mediated pathways, suppression of neuroinflammation (e.g., NLRP3 inflammasome inhibition), and attenuation of oxidative stress. Preclinical and clinical studies demonstrate that aerobic exercise modalities such as gait training, cycling, and aquatic therapy enhance cognitive domains including memory, executive function, and attention, with optimal benefits observed at moderate-to-high intensity and a frequency of ≥3 sessions per week. Despite robust evidence, challenges remain in standardizing exercise protocols and addressing individual variability in treatment response. Future research should prioritize large-scale randomized controlled trials to validate long-term cognitive benefits and identify biomarkers for personalized rehabilitation strategies. This review underscores the imperative to integrate aerobic exercise into post-stroke rehabilitation paradigms, offering a dual therapeutic approach to improve both physical and cognitive outcomes."

This study aims to investigate whether aerobic exercise videos on the YouTube platform are an excellent source for lung cancer patients. METHODS: The keywords, \"lung cancer and exercise,\" \"lung cancer and physical activity,\" and \"lung cancer and rehabilitation\" were used to identify videos on YouTube on 27 to 28 May 2023. We recorded the characteristics of the videos, including the number of views, duration, days since upload, and the number of likes and dislikes. The Global Quality Scale and the modified DISCERN questionnaire were used to assess the quality and reliability of videos. RESULTS: 150 videos were evaluated. 12 of 150 videos met the eligibility criteria. Lung cancer and aerobic exercise in rehabilitation videos were most commonly uploaded by health organizations and patients. Videos had a median of 3300 views. We assessed videos for user-focused video quality using the DISCERN instrument and found that the average total score was 3 (range 2-5). Inter-observer agreement was 0.89 and 0.91 for DISCERN and GQS scored, respectively. SIGNIFICANCE OF RESULTS: The results show that YouTube can be a preferred, easy, and inexpensive way to access aerobic exercise modalities, which are the basic rehabilitation steps for lung cancer patients. Experts recommend increasing the number of high-quality videos explaining the exercises. To fill this gap, healthcare professionals and organizations can take an active role in planning, producing, or ensuring reliable content. Collaborations with medical institutions and physiotherapists could further ensure that patients have access to accurate and effective exercise guidance, ultimately improving rehabilitation outcomes.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To assess sex differences in behavior and motivation of adolescent athletes with sport-related concussion (SRC) versus controls during a 2-week individualized aerobic exercise intervention. SETTING: Academic center research laboratory. PARTICIPANTS: Participants were enrolled within 10 days of SRC (n = 32; 15.6 ± 1.4 years, 33% female, 6.18 ± 2.21 days from injury). Twenty-eight control participants (16.0 ± 1.6 years, 33% female) were recruited. DESIGN: Randomized control trial with a 1:1 block randomization scheme stratified by participant sex. MAIN MEASURES: Clinical recovery time as determined by the study physician, heart rate threshold (HRt) on the Buffalo Concussion Treadmill Test, adherence rates (calculated as exercise volume completed/exercise volume prescribed), and behavioral assessments including the perceived competence scale (PCS) and the treatment self-regulation questionnaire (TSRQ). RESULTS: Females achieved higher initial HRts (P = .007), ie, the maximum HR during exercise testing. Males and females with a concussion showed minimal differences in motivation and perceived competence. Although it did not reach statistical significance (P = .058), females in the low-volume group appeared to recover faster than the high-volume group. This trend was not seen in males. Seven (88%) of exercise-intolerant females had to stop an exercise bout early on 1 or more days due to more-than-mild symptom exacerbation versus 3 (17%) of exercise-intolerant males (P = .002). CONCLUSION: Females with a concussion prescribed a high volume of aerobic exercise treatment appeared to take longer to recover than females with a concussion who were prescribed a lower volume, which was not seen in males. Increased training heart rate prescriptions due to higher initial HRts and symptom exacerbation during at-home exercise may have affected female exercise behavior. Although aerobic exercise benefits SRC recovery, this study highlights the need for future research to optimize exercise treatment prescriptions for females after SRC."

Aerobic exercise (AE) is a viable adjunct therapy, providing significant benefits for individuals dealing with both T2DM and MD. This review consolidates evidence on AE's role in alleviating the physiological and psychological effects of these comorbid conditions. It delves into the pathophysiological connections between T2DM and various MD, including depression, schizophrenia, anxiety, and bipolar disorder-emphasizing their reciprocal exacerbation. Key neurophysiological mechanisms through which AE confers benefits are explored, including neuroinflammation modulation, brain structure and neuroplasticity enhancement, growth factor expression regulation, and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA)/microbiota-gut-brain (MGB) axis normalization. Clinical results indicate that AE significantly improves both metabolic and psychological parameters in patients with T2DM and MD, providing a substantial argument for integrating AE into comprehensive treatment plans. Future research should aim to establish detailed, personalized exercise prescriptions and explore the long-term benefits of AE in this population. This review underscores the potential of AE to complement existing therapeutic modalities and enhance the management of patients with T2DM and MD.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: A definitive treatment for radiation-induced pulmonary fibrosis (RIPF), a common side effect of radiation therapy for thoracic cancer, remains to be established. Pulmonary rehabilitation programs, including regular aerobic exercise, may ameliorate RIPF. However, a scientific basis supporting the protective effect of exercise against RIPF is lacking. METHODS: Seven-week-old Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly allocated to the control (CON), training without irradiation (T), irradiation only (IR), and irradiation with training (IR + T) groups. Irradiation of the right lung was commenced at 40 Gy over five consecutive days, followed by regular aerobic exercise training using a treadmill for 7 weeks. The variables were assessed before and after irradiation. Pulmonary fibrosis was assessed using Masson's trichrome (MT) staining and hydroxyproline (HYP) assay. Behavioral tests were conducted to evaluate functional changes. In addition, potential molecular mechanisms were explored. RESULTS: The body weights of the rats in the IR and IR + T groups were lower than those in the other two groups. The Rota-rod test revealed significantly higher exercise capacity in the IR + T group compared to that in the IR group, which was closer to that in the CON group. MT staining and HYP assay revealed that the amount of fibrosis in the IR + T group was significantly lower than that in the IR group (collagen area (%): IR, 28.00 ± 7.51, n = 7; IR + T, 24.03 ± 6.93, n = 9; HYP concentration (μg/mg): IR, 0.80 ± 0.09, n = 7; IR + T, 0.47 ± 0.14, n = 9; p < 0.05). Superoxide dismutase activity in the IR + T group was higher than that in the IR group (IR, 84.02 ± 12.56, n = 7; IR + T, 100.55 ± 11.18, n = 9; p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Regular aerobic exercise ameliorated RIPF in rats, suggesting its potential utility in pulmonary rehabilitation programs for patients undergoing thoracic radiation therapy."

METHODS: Twenty-eight hypertensive patients (aged 61 ± 7 years) were randomly assigned to IMST (n = 14) and AE (n = 14) groups. The IMST performed 30 breaths/session at 75% of maximal inspiratory pressure (PImax), totaling about 8 minutes, 5 days/week. The AE group exercised at 70% of heart rate reserve for 30 minutes/session, 5 days/week. Both supervised interventions lasted 8 weeks, followed by a 4-week detraining period. Brachial and central systolic blood pressure (SBP) were taken at baseline, 8-week post-intervention, and post-detraining. RESULTS: The mean (standard deviation) change in brachial SBP from baseline to 8 week post-intervention significantly decreased in both the IMST group [-9.1 (12.1) mmHg, P = 0.01] and the AE group [-6.2 (7.2) mmHg, P = 0.01], with no significant difference between groups (P = 0.46). Central SBP also significantly reduced in the IMST group [-9.0 (11.9) mmHg, P = 0.01] and in the AE group [-5.7 (6.2) mmHg, P = 0.01], with no significant difference between groups (P = 0.37). However, the IMST group did not show significant persistence in SBP reduction, whereas the AE group did. CONCLUSIONS: Both IMST and AE effectively reduced brachial and central BP after 8-week interventions in hypertensive patients. While IMST presents a time-efficient adjunctive option to AE, its long-term effectiveness remains uncertain."

We conducted a 10-week exercise program with MPTP-treated mice to determine whether neuroinflammation can be addressed by aerobic exercise and elucidate its underlying regulatory mechanisms. Ten weeks of exercise significantly reduced PD-related pathology and enhanced AHN and memory. These changes were linked to a reduction in neuronal apoptosis, microglial inflammation, and NLRP3 inflammasome activation. In cultured microglia, fibril α-synuclein reduced FNDC5/irisin protein levels and induced NLRP3 inflammasome formation and IL-1β production, which could be diminished by recombinant irisin treatment. Interestingly, \"runner serum\" isolated from exercising rodents enhanced FNDC5/irisin expression and reduced NLRP3 inflammasome components and IL-1β secretion in α-synuclein-treated microglia. These effects could be diminished by blocking irisin signaling with cyclo RGDyk or NLRP3 agonist, nigericin sodium salt. Exercise-induced neuroprotective effects were weakened by treatment of MPTP-treated mice with cyclo RGDyk. In contrast, systematic administration of irisin partially replicated the beneficial effects of exercise on PD pathology, AHN, and memory function. As a nonpharmacological strategy, aerobic exercise effectively addresses PD pathology and preserves adult neurogenesis and cognition by mitigating microglial inflammation via mediating irisin/NLRP3 inflammasome pathways."

Exercise and physical activity reduce the progression of aging complications. Therefore, we examined the effect of proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation techniques compared to aerobic exercise on balance, fear of falling, and quality of life in older adults living in nursing homes. METHODS: Fifty-two older adults aged over 60 (31 males, 21 females) living in nursing homes were included. After initial evaluation, individuals were randomly assigned to two treatment groups (PNF techniques and aerobic exercise). Both treatment groups received 12 treatment sessions over 4 weeks. Balance, fear of falling, and quality of life were assessed at baseline and after a 4-week intervention. Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) and paired samples t-test were utilized to between and within-group changes of variables. RESULTS: The results showed no significant differences in balance, fear of falling, and quality of life between groups after the intervention (P > 0.05). In the within-group comparison, only the PNF techniques group showed significant improvement in the Berg Balance Scale (BBS) after the intervention (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The findings suggest that PNF techniques compared with aerobic exercise could not contribute to improved balance, fear of falling, and quality of life. Therefore, more clinical trial studies with a control group are needed to determine the exact effects of these techniques.

We estimated physical activity energy expenditure (PAEE) and time spent in sedentary behaviour and light and moderate or vigorous physical activity over 7 days at three time points (before, during and immediately after the intervention) with individually calibrated combined heart rate and movement sensing. RESULTS: Of 100 randomised participants (44% female, aged 67-76 years), 96% completed follow-up. Midway through the intervention, neither overall PAEE nor time spent at different intensities were different between groups. However, on the 3 days of the week that the structured exercise sessions occurred (Monday, Wednesday, Friday), the exercise group had a 9.1 kJ kg-1 day-1 ((2.5, 15.7), p=0.007) increase in PAEE, a reduction in sedentary time and increased time spent at light and moderate or vigorous physical activity, compared with the control group. CONCLUSIONS: Three 1-hour bouts per week of structured aerobic exercise increased daily physical activity on the days they occurred, but not overall physical activity across the whole week. Population-wide strategies such as better cycling and walking infrastructure may increase physical activity in healthy older adults more effectively than treatment with structured exercise programmes.

      "abstract": "Aerobic exercise (AE) and cognitive remediation (CR) have both shown promising effects on cognition in schizophrenia. However, the efficacy of combining these interventions has not been thoroughly evaluated. We conducted a randomized controlled trial to test the 3-month effects of AE, CR, and their combination on cognition and functioning in patients with schizophrenia. A total of 59 patients were randomized into three groups: AE alone (n = 19), CR alone (n = 19), or a combination of both (n = 21). The intervention consisted of a combination of individual and group AEs and a computer-assisted CR. The overall retention rate was 91.53 %. The primary outcome was the change in cognition from baseline, assessed using the Brief Assessment of Cognition in Schizophrenia (BACS). Significant improvements from baseline to post-treatment were observed in the combined AE and CR group compared to the AE alone group for verbal memory, executive function, and the composite score on the BACS. Similarly, greater improvements were found in the combined AE and CR group than in the CR group alone in verbal memory, working memory, attention, executive function, and the composite BACS score, with effect sizes ranging from moderate to large. No significant differences were found in functional level changes from baseline to post-treatment in the pairwise comparisons between groups, as assessed using the modified Global Assessment of Functioning for social functioning Scale. Our results indicate that patients with schizophrenia in the combined AE and CR group achieved greater cognitive improvement than those in the AE or CR alone group."

In turn, some work has reported that music listening imparts a similar EF benefit and increases CBF. In the present work, we examined whether music listening provides an EF benefit comparable to aerobic exercise and whether combined music listening and aerobic exercise supports an additive benefit. To that end, healthy young adults (N = 22, 14 female, 19-28 years) completed 10-min single bouts of: (1) music listening (ML), (2) light intensity aerobic exercise (AE), (3) combined ML and AE (ML + AE), and (4) a non-AE and non-ML control condition. For all conditions, pre- and post-intervention EF was assessed via the antisaccade task (i.e., saccade mirror-symmetrical to a target) and transcranial Doppler ultrasound measured middle cerebral artery velocity (MCAv) to estimate CBF. Results showed that ML, AE and ML + AE conditions increased MCAv; however, only the latter two conditions produced a pre- to post-intervention reduction in antisaccade RTs and the benefit was not linked to a MCAv change. Moreover, frequentist and Bayesian statistics indicated that the reduction in antisaccade RTs was equivalent across AE and ML + AE conditions. Accordingly, a single bout of exercise - and not a single bout of music listening - supports a non-additive post-intervention EF benefit that is not related to an exercise-based increase in CBF. Such findings suggest that exercise serves as a simple and cost-effective tool that can \"boost\" EF in advance of occupational- or educational-demanding tasks.",

METHODS: We analyzed a nationwide prospective population database from the Korean National Health Insurance System. We included 8,225 patients with diabetes who had undergone PCI and documented their aerobic exercise habits before and after the procedure (mean interval: 2.0 years). The patients were categorized into four groups: persistent non-exercisers, new exercisers, exercise discontinuers, and exercise maintainers. The primary outcome was major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), a composite of all-cause death, myocardial infarction, revascularization, and heart failure. We assessed the risk of clinical events using inverse probability-weighted Cox proportional hazards models. RESULTS: During a mean follow-up of 4.9 years, exercise maintainers, discontinuers, and new exercisers were associated with a significantly lower risk of MACE compared to non-exercisers. The lowest risk was observed in exercise maintainers (maintainers: aHR, 0.78; 95%CI, 0.71-0.86; discontinuers: aHR, 0.88; 95%CI, 0.79-0.98; new exercisers: aHR 0.89; 95%CI, 0.80-1.00). A J-curve relationship between the amount of aerobic exercise and adverse clinical outcomes was observed, with the lowest risk identified at 1,000-1,499 MET-min/week. Benefits diminished with exercise intensity ≥1500 MET-min/week. CONCLUSION: Aerobic exercise maintenance after PCI was associated with a reduced risk of cardiovascular events in patients with diabetes, with a moderate amount of exercise providing maximal benefit. Therefore, aerobic exercise is advisable for patients with diabetes undergoing PCI, and the optimal exercise dosage warrants further research."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: This study investigates the effects of acute aerobic exercise on the encoding and consolidation processes of emotional memory in individuals with methamphetamine use disorder (MUD). METHODS: A within-subject cross-over design was utilized for both experiments. In Experiment 1, thirty-two participants engaged in 30 min of moderate-to-high intensity (70 %-80 % of predicted HRmax) aerobic exercise and a sedentary task before completing a learning task. Following a 50-min interval, participants completed a recognition task. In Experiment 2, thirty-six participants first completed the learning task, then engaged in a 30-min session of moderate-to-high intensity aerobic exercise or a sedentary task. After a 20-min interval, participants undertook the recognition task. The recognition task assessed participants' accuracy in identifying old and new images, reaction times for recognition judgments, and confidence ratings. RESULTS: In Experiment 1, participants in the aerobic exercise condition exhibited significantly higher discrimination index d' for neutral emotion images compared to those in the sedentary condition. Additionally, they demonstrated a significantly lower response bias index β for positive and neutral emotion images. Furthermore, participants in the aerobic exercise condition displayed significantly longer reaction times for both METH-related and negative images compared to those in the sedentary condition. In Experiment 2, no significant differences were observed in discrimination index d', response bias index β, and reaction times between the two task conditions. CONCLUSION: This study reveals a significant impact of acute aerobic exercise on specific phases of emotional memory in individuals with MUD, particularly in enhancing encoding abilities. As a non-pharmacological intervention, exercise demonstrates the potential to alleviate addiction-related cognitive deficits and reduce the risk of relapse. The research further supports the prospect of integrating physical exercise into the treatment of substance use disorders, highlighting its critical role in promoting cognitive function recovery and overall therapeutic outcomes."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Although growing evidence suggests that aerobic exercise has beneficial effects on motor symptoms in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), it remains unclear which specific aerobic exercise regimen optimizes improvement in these symptoms. This study aimed to investigate the difference in the effects of aerobic exercise on motor function in patients with PD according to exercise intervention protocols. METHODS: Through 28 qualified studies with randomized controlled trials, we assessed motor function using either the Unified PD Rating Scale (UPDRS) III or Movement Disorder Society-UPDRS III as an outcome measure. We employed random effects meta-analysis models to obtain standardized mean differences and 95 % confidence intervals (CIs). Moderator variable analyses were conducted based on exercise type (aerobic exercise vs. aerobic-based combined exercise), duration (<60 min vs. ≥60 min per session), frequency (<four vs. ≥four sessions per week), period (<12 weeks vs. ≥12 weeks), and intensity (low-to-moderate vs. moderate-to-high). RESULTS: Aerobic exercise interventions demonstrated significant improvements in overall motor function. Although all categories were significantly effective in improving motor function, aerobic-based combined exercise had a greater effect size on motor symptoms compared to aerobic exercise alone. Additionally, ≥60 min per session showed a significantly increased effect size compared to <60 min per session. The impact of aerobic exercise did not differ based on exercise frequency, period, or intensity. CONCLUSIONS: Our observations suggest that aerobic-based combined exercise and exercise sessions lasting 60 min or longer may be associated with greater improvements in motor symptoms in patients with PD.",

OBJECTIVES: The authors aimed to investigate the association between BA and mortality among individuals with HFrEF and assess whether AET modifies the association. METHODS: Including participants in HF-ACTION (Heart Failure: A Controlled Trial Investigating Outcomes of Exercise Training), BA acceleration was constructed by the Klemera-Doubal method, using the residual of a linear model of BA and chronological age. The associations between BA and all-cause mortality, cardiovascular death, and all-cause hospitalization were investigated by treating BA acceleration into continuous and quintiles in the overall cohort. RESULTS: Among the 1,732 individuals, during a median of 31.5 (IQR: 20.7-43.1) months of follow-up, 301 deaths were observed. A 1-SD increase in BA acceleration was associated with a 31% higher risk of all-cause mortality (HR: 1.31; 95% CI: 1.13-1.51), a 31% higher risk of cardiovascular mortality (HR: 1.31; 95% CI: 1.12-1.54), and a 9% higher risk of all-cause hospitalization (HR: 1.09; 95% CI: 1.01-1.17). The association of all-cause mortality was significantly different between treatment arms (P interaction = 0.024). BA acceleration was associated with a 53% higher risk of all-cause mortality in usual care (HR: 1.53; 95% CI: 1.25-1.89), but the association was not significant in AET (HR: 1.10; 95% CI: 0.89-1.36). CONCLUSIONS: Among individuals with HFrEF, BA has a good prediction value in HFrEF endpoints. AET may be associated with a reduction in all-cause mortality driven by aging."

This study aimed to investigate the effects of aerobic exercise, stevia, and garlic extract on leptin and ghrelin receptor mRNA, as well as the interactions between insulin and glucose in relation to these genes. METHODS: A total of 50 male Wistar rats were split into two groups: one group was fed regular rodent food, while the other was fed a high-fat diet for 12 weeks to induce obesity. The obese rats were then divided into six groups of five (N = 5) based on Lee's index: an obese control group (OC), obese treated with garlic, stevia (OGS), obese aerobic exercise (OE), obese garlic and aerobic exercise (OGE), Obese stevia and aerobic exercise (OSE), and a Normal weight group (NC). The exercise groups participated in a gradually increasing aerobic walking program, whereas the stevia and garlic groups received daily oral doses of their respective extracts. The expression of leptin and ghrelin receptor genes in the hypothalamus was measured using real-time PCR, and insulin resistance was calculated using the HOMA/IR formula. Statistical analysis was conducted using ANOVA, with a significance level set at P < 0.05. RESULTS: The obese (O) rats experienced a significant increase in body weight compared with the control (C) rats (p = 0.013), whereas the treated rats showed no significant changes in weight. Leptin receptor mRNA levels were significantly lower in O rats than in C rats (p = 0.00), but increased significantly in the OS (p = 0.000) and OSE (p = 0.034) groups compared with obese rats. Ghrelin receptor mRNA levels were significantly higher in the O group than in the C group (p = 0.035), but decreased in all treatment groups, with the OE (p = 0.001), OGE (p = 0.001), and OSE (p = 0.004) groups showing the greatest reductions. Insulin resistance increased slightly in the O group compared with the C group (p = 0.112), but was lowest in the OS group among all groups (p = 0.018). CONCLUSIONS: Stevia significantly improved leptin and ghrelin receptor mRNA expression, glucose levels, and insulin resistance in obese rats, showing its potential as an effective dietary intervention for managing obesity.",

Six weeks of treadmill training was employed as an aerobic exercise intervention. The mRNA and protein levels of fibronectin type III domain-containing protein 5 (Fndc5/irisin), MuRF1, and Atrogin-1 in gastrocnemius muscles were analyzed using qRT-PCR and Western blot. Oxidative stress was assessed using relevant detection kits. Skeletal muscle function was evaluated through the four-paw hanging test, rotarod test, grip strength assay, and measurements of quadriceps, tibialis anterior, and gastrocnemius muscle mass. RESULTS: Aerobic exercise interventions enhanced skeletal muscle function by increasing hanging time, maximum speed, grip strength, and increased quadriceps, gastrocnemius, and tibialis anterior muscle mass. On the other hand, aerobic exercise reduced MuRF1 and Atrogin-1 expression in the gastrocnemius muscles of sarcopenia mice, along with lower malondialdehyde levels, and higher superoxide dismutase activity, T-ATPase, and glutathione peroxidase activity. A decline in Fndc5/irisin expression was further detected in the gastrocnemius muscles with aging. In Fndc5-knockout aged mice, aerobic exercise failed to improve skeletal muscle function compared to wild-type aged mice, as evaluated by hanging time, grip strength, maximum speed, and quadriceps, gastrocnemius, and tibialis anterior muscle mass, further validating the involvement of Fndc5 in the improvement of aging-associated sarcopenia. CONCLUSION: Aerobic exercise improves aging-associated sarcopenia in mice, with Fndc5/irisin playing a role in this process."

METHODS: A longitudinal study design was adopted, involving 48 male college students with internet addiction who were randomly assigned to either a control group or an experimental group. Participants in the experimental group engaged in 40 min aerobic cycling sessions three times per week for 12 weeks, while the control group maintained their usual physical activity levels without any intervention. A 3 × 2 × 3 mixed-factorial design was utilized, incorporating three time points (pre-experiment, 6 and 12 weeks), two groups (control and experimental), and three electrode sites (Fz, F3, F4). This design enabled the examination of the effects of aerobic exercise on reactive inhibitory control and its temporal dynamics in college students with internet addiction. RESULTS: A significant main effect of group was observed. Specifically, the experimental group demonstrated a significantly higher Nogo accuracy rate compared to the control group at both the mid-test (P < 0.01) and post-test (P < 0.001). Within the experimental group, the Nogo accuracy rate at the mid-test and post-test was significantly higher than at the pre-test (P < 0.001), with the post-test accuracy rate also significantly higher than the mid-test (P < 0.05). Time-frequency analysis revealed that, under the Nogo task, the energy values in the beta frequency band during the early (100-500 ms) and late (600-750 ms) time windows were significantly higher at the mid-test and post-test compared to the pre-test (P < 0.05), with the post-test values significantly exceeding those at the mid-test (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: (1) Moderate-intensity aerobic exercise significantly improves reactive inhibitory control in college students with internet addiction, with the magnitude of improvement increasing over the duration of the intervention. (2) Increased beta band energy during the early (100-500 ms) and late (600-750 ms) time windows serve as a key neurophysiological indicator of this enhancement."

Therefore, this study aims to investigate the impact of aerobic exercise on Notch1 pathways in the hepatic tissue of obese mice and its role in controlling hepatic metabolism. METHODS: Therefore, we conducted a cross-sectional study utilising liver biopsies from lean and obese humans, as well as an intervention study involving mice subjected to a high-fat diet. The obese-trained mice group underwent a treadmill-running protocol for 4 weeks. RESULTS: Our findings revealed that obese individuals exhibited increased NOTCH1 mRNA levels compared to lean subjects. The detrimental effects of Notch1 signalling were confirmed by Notch1-overexpressed HepG2 cell lines. Obese mice with higher hepatic Notch1 signalling demonstrated a reduction in this pathway when subjected to a 4-week treadmill running. Another benefit noticed in this trained group was the amelioration of insulin resistance, as well as a reduction in pyruvate intolerance and gluconeogenic enzymes. Additionally, we observed that these protective findings were accompanied by a decrease in mTORC1 pathway activity and lipid accumulation in the liver. Pharmacological inhibition of Notch1 in obese mice led to an increase in mitochondrial respiration in the liver. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that Notch1 signalling may be a potentially useful therapeutic target in obesity, while aerobic exercise training suppresses the Notch1 pathway in the liver, contributing to the regulation of hepatic glucose and lipid metabolism in obese mice.",

      "abstract": "To explore the molecular mechanism of aerobic exercise to improve heart failure and to provide a theoretical basis and experimental reference for the treatment of heart failure. Nine-week-old male mice were used to establish a left ventricular pressure overload-induced heart failure model by transverse aortic constriction (TAC). The mice were randomly divided into four groups: a sham group (SHAM), heart failure group (HF), heart failure + SKQ1 group (HS) and heart failure + aerobic exercise group (HE). The mice in the HE group were subjected to moderate-intensity aerobic exercise interventions. The mitochondrion-targeting antioxidant (SKQ1) contains the lipophilic cation TPP, which targets scavenging mitochondrial ROS. The HS group was subjected to SKQ1 (100 nmol/kg/d) interventions, which were initiated 1 week after the surgery, and the interventions lasted 8 weeks. Cardiac function was assessed by ultrasound, cardiomyocyte size by H&E and WGA staining, myocardial fibrosis by Masson's staining, and myocardial tissue oxidative stress and apoptosis by DHE and TUNEL fluorescence staining, respectively. Western blotting was used to detect the expression of mitochondrial quality control, inflammation, and apoptosis-related proteins. In the cellular level, an in vitro cellular model was established by isolating primary cardiomyocytes from neonatal mice (2-3 days) and intervening with Ang II (1 μM) to mimic heart failure. Oxidative stress and mitochondrial membrane potential were determined in the cardiomyocytes of each group by DHE and JC-1 staining, respectively. Myocardial fibrosis was increased significantly and cardiac function was reduced significantly in the heart failure mice. Aerobic exercise and SKQ1 intervention improved cardiac function and reduced myocardial hypertrophy and myocardial fibrosis in the heart failure mice significantly. Meanwhile, aerobic exercise and SKQ1 intervention reduced the number of DHE-positive particles (p < 0.01) and inhibited myocardial oxidative stress in the heart failure mice significantly. Aerobic exercise also reduced DRP1, Parkin, and BNIP3 protein expression (p < 0.05, p < 0.01), and increased OPA1 and PINK1 protein expression (p < 0.05, p < 0.01) significantly. Moreover, aerobic exercise and SKQ1 intervention decreased the number of TUNEL-positive particles and the expression of inflammation- and apoptosis-related proteins NLRP3, TXNIP, Caspase-1, IL-1β, BAX, BAK, and p53 significantly (p < 0.05, p < 0.01). In addition, the AMPK agonist AICAR and the mitochondria-targeted ROS scavenger (SKQ1) ameliorated AngII-induced mitochondrial fragmentation and decreased mitochondrial membrane potential in cardiomyocytes significantly. It was shown that inhibition of mitochondrial ROS by aerobic exercise, which in turn inhibits mitochondrial damage, improves mitochondrial quality control, and reduces myocardial inflammatory and apoptosis, may be an important molecular mechanism by which aerobic exercise exerts endogenous antioxidant protective effects to improve cardiac function.",

Aerobic exercise has the potential to aid in recovery after traumatic brain injury. This systematic review aims to investigate the effects of independent aerobic exercise on concussion-related symptoms, define the appropriate timing and optimal treatment parameters, and provide future recommendations for future research. METHODS: 'PubMed, SCOPUS, CINAHL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Web of Science' databases were searched from inception to February 15, 2024. The methodological quality of the studies included was judged using the 'Cochrane Collaboration tool.' RESULTS: In total, nine randomized controlled trials (n = 346), with 45% of participants being females, were involved in this analysis. Seven studies were classified as having 'high' quality, and two were categorized as 'moderate' quality according to the 'Cochrane Collaboration tool.' High-to-moderate-intensity aerobic exercise may improve concussion-related symptoms, especially if administered early in the acute stage of concussion. CONCLUSIONS: The evidence supporting aerobic exercise for concussion-related symptoms is promising. Starting aerobic exercise when patients are medically stable might improve concussion-related symptoms. Regular supervised 20-minute high-to-moderate-intensity aerobic exercise sessions, 3-5 times a week in a safe and controlled environment, may alleviate concussion-related symptoms."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Intervention adherence is crucial to ensure cognitive benefits in trials designed to prevent cognitive decline. During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the Japan-Multimodal Intervention Trial for the Prevention of Dementia offered live online exercise sessions to older adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). OBJECTIVES: To assess adherence and aerobic exercise intensity through live online exercise sessions in older adults with MCI. DESIGN: Posthoc analysis of the 18-month, multi-center, randomized controlled trial. SETTING: The study was conducted across five institutions in Japan. PARTICIPANTS: Older adults aged 65-85 years who were assigned to the intervention group and completed the intervention. Participants were stratified by region (Aichi and Tokyo), where the state of emergency duration due to COVID-19 varied. INTERVENTIONS: The intervention group participated in multidomain interventions, including 90-minute group-based physical exercise sessions held weekly for 78 sessions. During the state of emergency, live online sessions were conducted via video conferencing. MEASUREMENTS: Attendance rates and aerobic exercise intensity (based on heart rates) during online and onsite sessions were compared using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. RESULTS: A total of 207 participants were analyzed. Over 18 months, 78 exercise sessions were conducted, including live online sessions. In the Aichi region, 2 online sessions were held, while in the Tokyo region, 24 online sessions were conducted. In the Tokyo region, adherence was higher in online sessions compared to onsite sessions (92 % vs. 86 %, p = 0.046), while exercise intensity showed no significant difference (49 % vs. 52 %, p = 0.279). No adverse events were reported. CONCLUSIONS: Live online exercise sessions were safe, feasible, and demonstrated adherence and intensity comparable to onsite sessions. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The trial was registered at the University Hospital Medical Information Network Clinical Trials Registry (UMIN-CTR) on November 24, 2019 (UMIN000038671) (https://center6.umin.ac.jp/cgi-open-bin/ctr_e/ctr_view.cgi?recptno=R000044075)."

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: Women receiving aromatase inhibitors (AIs) for breast cancer frequently experience musculoskeletal symptoms (AIMS) including joint pain, stiffness, and muscle weakness. Aerobic exercise may reduce AIMS, but the evidence is inconclusive. This investigation examined whether aerobic exercise reduces pain in women with breast cancer. METHODS: Pain was a secondary outcome of a randomized controlled trial where postmenopausal women with breast cancer receiving AIs (N = 136) with or without pain were randomized to 6 months of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise (n = 70) or usual care (n = 66). The primary (Brief Pain Inventory severity, interference and worst pain) and secondary (SF-36 Bodily Pain and Breast Cancer Prevention Trial Symptom Checklist Musculoskeletal Pain) pain outcomes were assessed at pre-randomization (T1) and post-intervention (T2). Linear mixed modeling with linear contrasts was used to examine the effect of group assignment on outcomes. RESULTS: Participants were a median = 4.7 months post-breast cancer diagnosis at T1. Group-by-time interactions were observed for pain severity ( x ¯  = 0.848, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.233-1.464), pain interference ( x ¯  = 0.997, 95% CI = 0.448-1.547), and worst pain ( x ¯  = 1.371, 95% CI = 0.273-2.461) with significant increases in pain severity, interference, and worst pain in controls, small effect sizes, and no significant changes in the exercise group. We also found that a greater percentage of women in the control group had a clinically significant increase (≥ 2 points) in worst pain (p = 0.024) and pain severity (p = 0.029). CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that aerobic exercise prevents pain increase and may reduce pain prevalence when initiated early in AI therapy. The trial was registered at Clinical Trials.gov (NCT02793921) on May 20, 2016. KEY FINDINGS: Moderate-intensity aerobic exercise may prevent increases in pain and reduce pain when initiated early in AI therapy in postmenopausal women with breast cancer. Lack of exercise may be associated with increased over-the-counter pain medication use.",

      "abstract": "Acute exercise is suggested to elicit benefits for cool executive function, but the sensitivity of its hot components, such as risky decision making, to exercise remains unclear. However, improvements in risky decision making are relevant due to its predictive value for engagement in unhealthy behaviors in young adults in particular. We investigated the acute effects of aerobic exercise on risky decision making, its underlying neurocognitive processes (i.e., reward processing) and response inhibition. 33 female and 27 male participants (aged 24.0 ± 2.9 years) were randomly allocated to an intervention group, who performed 20 min of moderately-intense running on a treadmill, and a control group, who watched a video. Before and after these sessions, a Go/NoGo task and an Iowa Gambling task were administered. The feedback-related negativity (FRN) and P300 elicited by wins and losses during gambling were recorded with electroencephalography. We found no group differences in pre- to posttest changes in performance on the Go/NoGo task and Iowa Gambling task. However, there was a greater increase in the bias for infrequent losses in the intervention compared to the control group, accompanied by a change towards higher P300 amplitude and lower negativity of the FRN. In conclusion, an exercise session did not affect performance on cool and hot executive function tasks but altered the strategic approach in decision making. Exercise led to a better anticipation of outcomes of decisions and a higher maintenance of the feedback significance, which both contributed to a change towards choices that yield less frequent, larger losses.",

      "abstract": "Cardiac ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) induces systemic oxidative stress, which in turn gives rise to the development of multiple organ abnormalities, including brain injury. The paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus is a cardiovascular regulatory center. Aerobic exercise is an effective intervention to protect the heart against I/R injury. However, the effect of aerobic exercise on cardiac I/R-induced neuronal injury in the PVN has not been fully elucidated. The aim of this study is to investigate whether aerobic exercise can up-regulate fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) and alleviate neuronal oxidative stress and ferroptosis in the PVN caused by cardiac I/R. In vivo, after six weeks of aerobic exercise, the cardiac I/R model was established by ligating the left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery for 30 min, followed by 2 h of reperfusion. Cardiac function and heart rate variability (HRV) were measured. Morphological changes, oxidative stress, expression of FGF21 and its downstream signaling molecules, as well as ferroptosis-related indicators in the PVN, were evaluated. In vitro, HT22 cells were exposed to oxygen-glucose deprivation and reoxygenation (OGD/R) and treated with recombinant human FGF21 (rhFGF21) and compound C to elucidate the potential mechanism. Cardiac I/R induced iron deposition, elevated expression of lipid peroxidation drivers, and impaired antioxidant capacity in the PVN, which collectively contributed to neuronal ferroptosis. Aerobic exercise up-regulated the expression of FGF21, FGFR1, and PGC-1α, maintained the phosphorylation of AMPKα, enhanced antioxidant capacity, reduced ROS and lipid peroxidation, regulated iron homeostasis, and effectively attenuated neuronal ferroptosis induced by cardiac I/R. In addition, rhFGF21 protected HT22 cells against OGD/R-induced oxidative stress and ferroptosis, which was blocked by AMPK inhibition. FGF21 plays a pivotal role in regulating neuronal oxidative stress and ferroptosis. Aerobic exercise could increase the expression of FGF21, FGFR1, and PGC-1α, maintain the phosphorylation of AMPKα, and alleviate cardiac I/R-induced neuronal oxidative stress and ferroptosis. These results confirm the protective effect of aerobic exercise against cardiac I/R-induced brain injury and provide an experimental basis for studying the relationship between exercise and the \"heart-brain axis.\""

A meta-analysis was conducted to determine the standardized mean difference (SMD) and 95% confidence interval. Nineteen studies met the inclusion criteria. AE significantly improved blood lipids in people with overweight or obesity (TG: SMD = -0.54; p < 0.00001; TC: SMD = -0.24; p = 0.003; HDL: SMD = 0.33; p = 0.003; LDL: SMD = -0.42; p = 0.0005). Both moderate-intensity and vigorous-intensity AE demonstrated significant impacts in reducing TC, TG, and LDL, whereas only moderate-intensity exercise significantly elevated HDL. Additionally, AE significantly optimized blood lipids in those with overweight, with TG being the only parameter showing improvement in individuals with obesity. Moreover, continuous AE notably improved HDL and TG, while interval AE significantly reduced TG, TC, and LDL. Lastly, a clear positive correlation emerged between the duration of the intervention and the decrease in LDL, and a distinct negative correlation was observed between session duration and the reduction of LDL."

All participants attended regular physical education classes as usual, while the exercise group participated in an 8 week aerobic exercise program. Before and after the intervention, the inhibition, updating, and switching sub-functions of executive function were assessed. RESULTS: (1) Active procrastinators and passive procrastinators showed significant differences in their inhibition scores, inhibition accuracy, updating scores, and updating accuracy (p < 0.05). Non-procrastinators exhibited a significantly higher inhibition accuracy than passive procrastinators (p < 0.05), while active procrastinators had a significantly higher updating accuracy than non-procrastinators (p < 0.05). As can be seen, there were significant differences in inhibition and updating functions between active procrastinators and passive procrastinators, with passive procrastinators showing obvious deficiencies in their inhibition accuracy. (2) After the intervention, the aerobic exercise group of non-procrastinators showed a significant reduction in their inhibition reaction time and updating reaction time (p < 0.05). The passive procrastination in the exercise group showed significant improvements in switching accuracy and inhibition accuracy (p < 0.05). The active procrastination in the exercise group showed a significant reduction in updating reaction time (p < 0.05). From the above findings, it is clear that the eight-week aerobic exercise intervention has shown improvement effects on the executive function of college students with different procrastination types, and the extent of the improvement in each sub-function of executive function varies depending on the type of procrastination. CONCLUSION: This study reveals the relationship between exercise and the development of the sub-functions of executive function in college students with procrastination, further validating the effectiveness and feasibility of implementing exercise interventions in real-world school settings."

      "abstract": "Aerobic exercise has been proved to reduce the risk of major depression in subthreshold depression (StD) individuals effectively, yet previous studies ignored the different functions of amygdala subregions. In this study, 44 StD individuals and 34 healthy controls (HCs) underwent resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging before and after eight weeks of aerobic exercise respectively. Transverse and longitudinal analyses were conducted based on the seed-based functional connectivity (FC) analysis between amygdala subregions and the whole brain of the two groups. The transverse analyses showed that compared to HCs, StD individuals showed abnormal FC between the right dorsal amygdala (DA) and right superior frontal gyrus, the left medial amygdala (MA) and left gyrus rectus, right caudate, as well as the right ventrolateral amygdala (VA) and right angular gyrus before the exercise intervention, while increased FC between the right DA and left supramarginal gyrus after the exercise intervention. The longitudinal analysis showed decreased FC between the left DA and left caudate, left middle frontal gyrus, while increased FC between the right MA and posterior central gyrus in StD individuals after exercise intervention. As for HCs, the DA showed FC differences with the insula, frontal lobe, parietal lobe, temporal lobe and thalamus. The MA showed FC differences with the central posterior gyrus, occipital lobe and thalamus. The VA showed FC differences with the calcarine cortex and parietal lobe. The findings demonstrated the alleviative effect of aerobic exercise on depression from the perspective of brain function.",

      "abstract": "AIMS: Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is an increasingly prevalent cardiovascular disease, which is often accompanied by kidney dysfunction. Exercise has been recognized as a feasible strategy to improve renal function. The aim of this study was to investigate whether aerobic exercise (AE) could ameliorate HFpEF-induced renal injury by regulating the expression of acyl-coenzyme A: lysocardiolipin acyltransferase-1 (ALCAT1). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eight-week-old C57BL/6 and Alcat1 knockout mice were used to establish a HFpEF induced kidney injury model. Mice in the exercise-intervention group were performed a six-week of AE training. Cardiac function and blood pressure were assessed using echocardiography and a non-invasive intelligent blood pressure monitor. Renal morphology and function were detected by HE, Masson, and PAS staining, as well as biochemical assays using commercial kits. Oxidative stress, inflammation, apoptosis, and renal fibrosis-related proteins were detected by Western Blotting. KEY FINDINGS: In the HFpEF induced kidney injury model, ALCAT1 protein expression was upregulated, accompanied by cardiac and renal dysfunction. These pathological changes were reversed by AE. In addition, Alcat1 knockout significantly alleviated HFpEF-induced oxidative stress, inflammation, apoptosis, and fibrosis in the kidneys. Furthermore, Alcat1 knockout further enhanced the protective effects of exercise, ameliorating renal injury and improving renal function in HFpEF mice. SIGNIFICANCE: AE significantly improved renal function by alleviating oxidative stress, inflammation, apoptosis, and fibrosis in HFpEF mice. These beneficial effects were further enhanced in the lack of ALCAT1. Thus, ALCAT1 might represent a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of HFpEF-induced kidney injury.",

Here, we tested whether reducing blood glucose with a low-carbohydrate/high-fat \"ketogenic\" diet could restore aerobic exercise adaptation in a mouse model of hyperglycemia. Hyperglycemia was induced by streptozotocin (STZ) and mice were stratified to standard chow (STZ-CHOW), or a ketogenic diet (STZ-KETO), which rapidly normalized blood glucose. After aerobic exercise training, improvements in VO2peak were blunted in STZ-CHOW, but exercise response was restored in STZ-KETO. Improved VO2peak in STZ-KETO was associated with enhanced aerobic remodeling of skeletal muscle, including a more oxidative fiber-type and increased capillary density, along with restoration of circulating angiogenic markers. Moreover, KETO induced exercise-independent effects on muscle mitochondrial remodeling and mitochondrial dynamics, significantly increasing fatty acid oxidation. Our results identify a ketogenic diet as a potential therapy to improve aerobic exercise response in the growing population with hyperglycemia due to diabetes and other metabolic conditions."

      "abstract": "UNLABELLED: Exercise as a medical intervention is effective to help prevent and manage many chronic and complex diseases, including dementia. There is evidence to suggest that regular aerobic exercise protects against age-related brain atrophy and reduces the risk of cognitive decline. The mechanisms by which exercise infers a neuroprotective effect remain to be established but may be related to a maintenance of brain volume and neuronal survival, improved cerebrovascular density and function, and/or increased synaptic plasticity. In addition, there is growing evidence to suggest the beneficial effects of exercise on brain health and cognitive function are, at least in part, mediated by factors released by skeletal muscle during contraction. The fact that the brain responds to exercise suggests that muscle-derived peripheral factors, or \"myokines,\" may play a key role in muscle-brain crosstalk and exercise neuroprotection. However, the most effective \"dose\" of aerobic exercise to promote beneficial changes in these myokine pathways is currently unknown. Specifically, most of the evidence to date is from studies that have used moderate-intensity exercise, and research investigating the merit of high-intensity exercise is scarce. Considering the well-established role of high-intensity interval training in protecting against numerous medical conditions, more research is needed to identify the most effective \"dose\" of exercise to improve the beneficial effects of these myokines. HIGHLIGHTS: Neuroprotection through exercise: Regular aerobic exercise mitigates age-related brain atrophy and cognitive decline via multiple mechanisms, including brain volume maintenance, improved cerebrovascular function, and synaptic plasticity. Myokines as mediators: Muscle-derived factors (myokines) play a crucial role in muscle-brain crosstalk, significantly contributing to the neuroprotective effects of exercise. Intensity matters: The review underscores the necessity to define and study exercise intensity, revealing high-intensity exercise may be as effective, if not more, in promoting neuroprotective myokine levels compared to moderate-intensity exercise. Future research directions: This review emphasizes the need for well-controlled studies to explore the optimal exercise dose for enhancing myokine pathways and their implications for neurodegenerative disease prevention."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Aerobic exercise training can promote the recovery of learning and memory ability in Alzheimer's disease (AD), but the specific mechanism is still unclear. Previous studies have suggested that aquaporin-4 (AQP4)-mediated glymphatic system is an important way to clear β-amyloid (Aβ) in the brain, which is closely related to learning and memory impairment in AD. However, it remains unclear whether AQP4 regulates glymphatic clearance of Aβ which contributes to the beneficial effects of aerobic exercise in AD patients. Here, the goal of this study was to investigate the mechanisms about aerobic exercise whether AQP4 could modulate glymphatic system using APP/PS1 mice. METHODS: In this study, APP/PS1 AD model mice were treated with aerobic exercise intervention through swimming exercise training for 4 weeks, and the two groups of mice were injected with AQP4 inhibition virus and empty virus, respectively. Their learning and memory abilities were assessed using behavioral tests, such as the Barnes maze and Morris water maze tests. Hippocampus was obtained from sacrificed mice and used for histological analysis. Tracer imaging of the cerebellar medullary pool was used to observed the CSF-ISF exchange, immunohistochemistry was used to detect the level of Aβ plaques in the hippocampus of mice in each group; immunoblotting was used to detect the expression of AQP4 protein; immunofluorescence co-labeling was used to detect the polarization distribution of AQP4; qRT-PCR was used to detect the transcription levels of AQP4 and its anchoring proteins. RESULTS: The funding showed that APP/PS1 mice have learning and memory impairment, and the glymphatic system is dysfunction. Swimming training can improve the ability of the glymphatic system to clear Aβ deposition in the hippocampus by up-regulating the transcription levels of Lama1 and Dp71 in the hippocampus, reducing the depolarization distribution of AQP4 in the hippocampus, and enhancing the exchange of CSF-ISF. Thus, improves learning and memory impairment in APP/PS1 mice. CONCLUSIONS: Swimming training can rescue the function of the glymphatic system, increase the CSF-ISF exchange, promote the polarization distribution of AQP4, and reduce the deposition of Aβ in the hippocampus, thereby improving the learning and memory ability of APP/PS1 mice.",

METHODS: A study was conducted on 200 patients with gestational hypertension treated from May 2023 to May 2024. Patients were assigned to an observation group (n=110), which received aerobic exercise and systematic nursing care, or a control group (n=90), which received standard care. Both groups were monitored until delivery. Pre- and post-intervention comparisons included scores for negative emotions, blood pressure, pregnancy outcomes, neonatal weight, Apgar scores, delivery methods, and patient satisfaction with nursing care. The systolic-to-diastolic peak (S/D) ratio in umbilical blood flow and heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) levels were analyzed, with ROC analysis used to evaluate their predictive value for adverse pregnancy outcomes. Logistic regression was employed to identify independent risk factors for low Apgar scores in neonates. RESULTS: Following the intervention, the observation group showed significantly better blood pressure control and greater reductions in negative emotions compared to the control group (both P<0.05). The incidence of adverse pregnancy outcomes was significantly lower, and the rate of vaginal delivery was higher in the observation group (both P<0.05). Patients with adverse outcomes had significantly elevated S/D ratios and serum HSP70 levels (both P<0.05). The area under the ROC curve (AUC) for predicting pregnancy outcomes was 0.733 for the S/D ratio, 0.817 for HSP70, and 0.916 when combined, indicating strong predictive value. Neonates in the observation group had higher birth weights and Apgar scores (both P<0.05). Patient satisfaction with nursing care was also significantly higher in the observation group (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: Combining aerobic exercise with systematic nursing care is effective in improving psychological health, pregnancy outcomes, quality of life, and patient satisfaction in patients with gestational hypertension."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Aerobic exercise (AE) training has been shown to enhance aerobic fitness in people with schizophrenia. Traditionally, such training has been administered in person at gyms or other communal exercise spaces. However, following the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic, many clinics transitioned their services to telehealth-based delivery. Yet, at present, there is scarce information about the feasibility, safety, and efficacy of telehealth-based AE in this population. OBJECTIVE: To examine the feasibility, safety, and efficacy of trainer-led, at-home, telehealth-based AE in individuals with schizophrenia. METHODS: We analyzed data from the AE arm (n=37) of a single-blind, randomized clinical trial examining the impact of a 12-week AE intervention in people with schizophrenia. Following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the AE trial intervention transitioned from in-person to at-home, telehealth-based delivery of AE, with the training frequency and duration remaining identical. We compared the feasibility, safety, and efficacy of the delivery of trainer-led AE training among participants undergoing in-person (pre-COVID-19; n=23) versus at-home telehealth AE (post-COVID-19; n=14). RESULTS: The telehealth and in-person participants attended a similar number of exercise sessions across the 12-week interventions (26.8, SD 10.2 vs 26.1, SD 9.7, respectively; P=.84) and had similar number of weeks with at least 1 exercise session (10.4, SD 3.4 vs 10.6, SD 3.1, respectively; P=.79). The telehealth-based AE was associated with a significantly lower drop-out rate (telehealth: 0/14, 0%; in-person: 7/23, 30.4%; P=.04). There were no significant group differences in total time spent exercising (telehealth: 1246, SD 686 min; in-person: 1494, SD 580 min; P=.28); however, over the 12-week intervention, the telehealth group had a significantly lower proportion of session-time exercising at or above target intensity (telehealth: 33.3%, SD 21.4%; in-person: 63.5%, SD 16.3%; P<.001). There were no AE-related serious adverse events associated with either AE delivery format. Similarly, there were no significant differences in the percentage of participants experiencing minor or moderate adverse events, such as muscle soreness, joint pain, blisters, or dyspnea (telehealth: 3/14, 21%; in-person: 5/19, 26%; P>.99) or in the percentage of weeks per participant with at least 1 exercise-related adverse event (telehealth: 31%, SD 33%; in-person: 40%, SD 33%; P=.44). There were no significant differences between the telehealth versus in-person groups regarding changes in aerobic fitness as indexed by maximum oxygen consumption (VO2max; P=.27). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provide preliminary support for the delivery of telehealth-based AE for individuals with schizophrenia. Our results indicate that in-home telehealth-based AE is feasible and safe in this population, although when available, in-person AE appears preferable given the opportunity for social interactions and the higher intensity of exercises. We discuss the findings' clinical implications, specifically within the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as review potential challenges for the implementation of telehealth-based AE among people with schizophrenia.",

Participants with an SRC completed the Buffalo Concussion Bike Test to determine the heart rate threshold (HRt) associated with symptom exacerbation and/or voluntary exhaustion. On a separate day, SRC participants - and healthy controls (HC group) - completed 20-min of aerobic exercise at 80% HRt while middle cerebral artery velocity (MCAv) was measured to estimate CBF. The antisaccade task (i.e. saccade mirror-symmetrical to target) was completed pre- and postexercise to evaluate EF. SRC and HC groups showed a comparable exercise-mediated increase in CBF (ps < .001), and both groups elicited a postexercise EF benefit (ps < .001); however, the benefit was unrelated to the magnitude of the MCAv change. Moreover, SRC symptomology was not increased when assessed immediately postexercise and showed a 24 h follow-up benefit. Accordingly, persons with an SRC demonstrated an EF benefit following a single bout of sub-symptom threshold aerobic exercise. Moreover, the exercise intervention did not result in symptom exacerbation and thus demonstrates that a tailored aerobic exercise program may support cognitive and symptom recovery following an SRC.",

METHODS: Thirty obese middle-aged women (body mass index [BMI] ≥ 25 kg/m2, body fat ≥ 30%) were randomly divided into three groups: HIAE, MIAE, or control groups (n = 10 per group). The exercise groups performed aerobic exercise three times per week for 8 weeks at an intensity of 80-85% (HIAE) and 60-65% (MIAE) of VO2max. Body composition, Aβ levels, metabolic markers, and blood lipid profiles were measured before and after the intervention. A two-way repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) was applied to analyze the data and determine interaction effects. RESULTS: Both the HIAE and MIAE groups showed notable reductions in body weight, body fat percentage, BMI, Aβ, glucose, insulin, HOMA-IR, and all blood lipid variables over time compared to the control group (p &lt; 0.001). Significant time-by-group interaction effects were observed for each variable, with HIAE resulting in greater reductions in TC, TG, and LDL-C, and greater increases in HDL-C. Post hoc analyses showed a substantial rise in HDL-C levels for the HIAE group compared to the control group (p = 0.000), with a trend toward greater increases than in MIAE (p = 0.058). CONCLUSION: HIAE and MIAE interventions effectively improved metabolic and cognitive health markers in middle-aged women with obesity. These findings emphasize the dose-response effects of exercise intensity, with HIAE offering greater benefits for lipid control and Aβ reduction."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Evidence on the effectiveness of combined exercise over aerobic exercise alone in lowering blood pressure (BP) remains limited. This study compared the effectiveness of combined aerobic plus resistance training versus aerobic training alone, with both interventions matched for exercise duration. METHODS: This randomized controlled trial included thirty-one female participants eligible for final analysis. Participants were randomly assigned to two groups: 15 to the Control (C) group, which underwent 8 weeks of aerobics, and 16 to the Combined Training (CT) group, which underwent 8 weeks of combined training. Outcome measures included weight, height, Body Mass Index (BMI), systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP and DBP), heart rate (HR), mean arterial pressure (MAP), pulse pressure (PP), hand grip strength (HGS), and performance on the 30-second Chair Stand Test (30-s CST). These variables were assessed at baseline and at the end of week 8. Two-way ANOVA followed Tukey post-hoc was applied to analyze changes within and between groups over time. The effect size was calculated using partial eta squared (η<inf>p</inf>2). RESULTS: Baseline characteristics were similar across groups, except for heart rate. Both groups showed significant reductions in SBP and DBP after the intervention ([C: SBP decreased by -7.4±2.2, P=0.00; DBP decreased by -5.1±2.4, P=0.00] [CT: SBP decreased by -6.1±2.1, P<0.01, and DBP decreased by -6.9±2.0, P<0.01]). The reduction in SBP was more pronounced in the C than in the CT (P=0.04), while the reduction in DBP was greater in the CT group (P=0.04). An improvement in the outcome variable is caused by the \"group\" or \"time\" effect but not by the effect of \"group × time.\" CONCLUSIONS: Adding resistance training to aerobic exercise enhances the reduction in diastolic blood pressure compared to aerobic exercise alone in prehypertension middle-aged women.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: We sought to examine a potential neural mechanism of reduced depressive symptoms in response to aerobic treadmill walking exercise training in people with multiple sclerosis (MS). This includes a secondary analysis of depressive symptom and MRI data from an original randomized controlled trial (RCT) on exercise effects on learning and memory impairment in people with MS. METHODS: Ten fully ambulatory people with MS were randomly assigned into either a 12-week aerobic treadmill walking condition or active control condition (ie, stretching and range-of-motion activities). All participants completed the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale for measurement of depressive symptoms as well as a resting-state functional MRI (fMRI) before and after the 12-week study period. RESULTS: There were no between-condition differences in depressive symptoms at baseline. Participants who were randomly assigned to the intervention condition demonstrated reductions in depressive symptoms compared with minimal changes for those who underwent the control condition. This corresponded with significant changes in resting-state functional connectivity within the default-mode network (DMN). CONCLUSIONS: The overall pattern of results suggests that resting-state functional connectivity within the DMN may represent a potential neural mechanism underlying the beneficial effects of exercise on depressive symptoms in people with MS. Such results warrant future consideration in the design and conduct of future RCTs that aim to treat MS-related depression with aerobic exercise training in people with MS who have been prescreened for clinical depression."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Engaging in physical exercise is recommended to enhance cardiovascular health and manage blood sugar levels in people with type 1 diabetes (T1D). HYPOTHESIS: The impact of high-intensity interval exercise with elastic bands (EB-HIIE) versus continuous moderate-intensity aerobic exercise (CONT) on glycemic control is different in men with T1D. STUDY DESIGN: Crossover study design. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level 3. METHODS: Participants (39 men with T1D) underwent either an EB-HIIE or a CONT session in randomized order, with a separation of ≥72 hours to avoid carry-over effects. Changes in glucose values during exercise were measured simultaneously from venous blood (YSI) and interstitial fluid (Dexcom G6 glucose sensor). Subsequent 24-hour glucose was monitored using the glucose sensor. RESULTS: Blood glucose was lower in CONT vs EB-HIIE (P < .01). Post hoc analysis revealed clinically relevant differences during exercise (-35.1 mg/dl; P = .02), at its end (-49.5 mg/dl; P < .01), and at 10 and 20 minutes after completion (-51.2 mg/dl; P < .01 and -45.9 mg/dl; P < .01, respectively). Time-in-range 24 hours after exercise completion was significantly higher with EB-HIIE than with CONT (66.5% vs 59.3%), although both were significantly better than the previous 24 hours before exercise (50%). CONCLUSION: Results suggest that EB-HIIE is a safe training method for male adults with diabetes, resulting in euglycemia during and immediately after exercise and improving glucose outcomes in the subsequent 24 hours. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: This study provides new evidence and practical information on how to implement safe physical activity in daily life of patients with diabetes. EB-HIIT exhibited lower hypoglycemia risk during exercise and better glycemic control in the subsequent 24 hours. In contrast, practicing CONT exercise is associated with higher risk of hypoglycemia. Healthcare providers should take this information into account when prescribing exercise."

      "abstract": "Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a chronic and recurrent disorder characterized by gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms and psychological disorders. Individuals with an external locus of control (LoC), a personality trait influencing one's actions and outcomes, are more vulnerable to IBS. Physical activity can deal with GI symptoms, preserving mental and physical health. In this context, our study aimed to investigate differences in symptom and psychological profiles among IBS patients classified by internal or external LoC when patients engaged in an aerobic exercise program (AEP). Each IBS patient was administered the International Physical Activity Questionnaire-Short Form (IPAQ-SF) before treatment, and the Physical Capacity Assessment Tests were applied before and after treatment. Participants filled out a GI symptom questionnaire before and after the intervention and some validated psychological tests to evaluate the changes induced by AEP. The AEP consisted of 180 min of moderate-intensity aerobic walking activity a week. Fifty-four IBS patients completed the 12-week study; 37 belonged to the internal LoC group and 17 to the external one. The internal LoC subgroup had a higher percentage of physically active subjects and a better physical capacity at baseline than those with external LoC. Only patients with an internal LoC achieved a statistically significant increase in physical capacity as the effect of the AEP. However, there was no statistically significant difference when Delta was considered. The somatic and psychological health status of IBS patients in the external LoC group was poorer than that of the internal LoC group at the baseline, particularly abdominal pain, psychosocial functioning, and emotional distress. After AEP, patients showed significant improvement in scores on the IBS-related and psychological scales, regardless of whether they belonged to the external or internal LoC. The present study confirmed the importance of considering both the GI symptoms and the psychological profile when dealing with IBS. AEP organized in walking groups has shown significant improvements for all IBS patients. Since external LoC was associated with poorer health status, individually tailored interventions should be planned to increase patients' self-motivation to treatment.Trial registration: registration number NCT05453084.

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Aerobic exercise has been confirmed to alleviate primary dysmenorrhea (PD) in adolescents and young women. However, the effect of the aerobic exercise type and dosage on PD alleviation was unclear. This research aims to assess the effect of aerobic exercise on PD and investigate the dose-response relationships. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Systematic literature searches of Web of Science, Embass, Cochrane Library, PubMed, PsycNET, CINAHL, CNKI, Baidu Scholar, Google Scholar, and other Complimentary Medicine Database. PICOS standards were adopted in this research: participants were nonathlete women with PD; intervention was aerobic exercise of at least one menstruation cycle; comparator was any comparator; outcomes were pain intensity or pain duration; and study type was randomized controlled trials. The Cochrane Collaboration risk of bias tool was used to assess the quality of the research. Random-effect meta-analysis was conducted for pain intensity and pain duration, with prespecified subgroup analyses based on aerobic exercise components. The strength of the evidence was assessed using GRADE. This systematic review and meta-analysis was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42024533544). RESULTS: The study identified 16 eligible studies, with 15 involving adolescents, totaling 918 participants aged 15 to 43, with an average age of 21.26 ± 13.15. The results confirmed that aerobic exercise can alleviate PD's pain intensity (standard mean difference (SMD) = -1.728 (p = 0.00), 95% CI [-2.26 to -1.31]) and pain duration (weighted mean difference (WMD) = -12.53 h, p = 0.01, 95% CI: -21.38 to -3.68). However, the heterogeneity of these two results was high. Subgroup analysis showed that Pilates (SMD = -3.17, 95% CI [-4.26 to -2.07]), low intensity (SMD = -1.64, 95% CI [-2.10 to -1.19]), 31-45 min duration (SMD = -3.05, 95% CI [-5.36 to -0.75]), ≤2 times per week frequency (SMD = -2.24, 95% CI [-3.36 to -1.12]), and a period cycle of 2 menstrual cycles (SMD = -2.21, 95% CI [-3.13 to -1.28]) had the maximum effect size. CONCLUSIONS: Aerobic exercise was able to alleviate pain intensity and pain duration in adolescents and young women with PD. Moderate-quality evidence indicates that Pilates, low intensity, 46-60 min, ≤two times per week, or two menstrual cycles showed more efficiency in alleviating PD. Due to the limited data, future research should prioritize conducting randomized controlled trials of aerobic exercise interventions in younger age groups to develop personalized treatment strategies for adolescents.",

While exercise has been demonstrated to alleviate these cognitive deficits, the precise neural mechanisms underlying these effects remain poorly understood. This study examines the effects of exercise on attentional control in individuals with high trait anxiety, based on attentional control theory, which suggests that such individuals have reduced top-down attention. Thirty-eight participants were randomly assigned to either an exercise group or a reading group. The exercise group engaged in 30 min of moderate-intensity cycling, while the reading group spent 30 min reading quietly. In Experiment 1, goal-directed attention was assessed using a cue-object paradigm, and in Experiment 2, inhibitory control was evaluated through a visual search task. EEG data indicated that the exercise group exhibited significantly larger Pd components in both experiments, suggesting enhanced attentional focus and improved inhibition of distractors. These findings suggest that aerobic exercise enhances top-down attentional processes, particularly goal-directed attention and distractor inhibition, offering potential as an intervention for individuals with high trait anxiety.",

      "abstract": "Renal osteodystrophy is commonly seen in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) due to disrupted mineral homeostasis. Given the impaired renal function in these patients, common antiresorptive agents, including bisphosphonates, must be used with caution or even contraindicated. Therefore, an alternative therapy without renal burden to combat renal osteodystrophy is urgently needed. Here, we report that clinically relevant aerobic exercise significantly prevents high-turnover renal osteodystrophy in CKD mice and patients with CKD without compromising renal function. Mechanistically, 4-week aerobic exercise in CKD mice increased expression of skeletal muscle PPARγ coactivator-1α (PGC-1α) and circulating irisin. Both exercise and irisin administration significantly activated osteoblasts, but not osteoclasts, via integrin αvβ5, thereby conferring bone quality benefits. Removal of irisin-influenced thermogenic adipose tissues or genetic ablation of uncoupling protein 1 did not alter the irisin-conferred antiosteodystrophy effect. Importantly, in a pilot clinical study, 12-week aerobic exercise in patients with high-grade CKD significantly increased circulating irisin and prevented osteodystrophy progression, without detectable renal burden. The combination of irisin and current antiresorptive agents effectively rescued renal osteodystrophy in mice. Our work provides mechanistic insights into the role of exercise and irisin in renal osteodystrophy, and it highlights a clinically relevant, low-cost, kidney-friendly therapy for patients with this devastating disease.",

There are some problems with current clinical treatment methods, and exercise is an alternative to chronotherapy. Therefore, we aimed to study the effects of two different exercise methods, aerobic and resistance, on sleep, melatonin, inflammatory factors and mood in college students with DSWPD. METHODS: Male college students aged 18-28 years with DSWPD and no regular exercise habits were recruited to participate in a randomized crossover trial. Three-day moderate-intensity aerobic and resistance exercises were conducted. Sleep quality, urine melatonin concentration, blood inflammatory factors, and mood changes were evaluated. RESULTS: Resistance exercise (RE) improved five sleep indicators (P < 0.05),including sleep onset time, sleep onset latency, total sleep time, wake after sleep onset and sleep efficiency, whereas aerobic exercise (AE) only improved sleep onset time and sleep efficiency (P < 0.05). In addition, RE and AE increased urine aMT6s, IL-10 and decreased IL-6. But RE was more effective in improving sleep onset time, sleep efficiency and urine aMT6s, IL-6. In terms of mood indicators, aerobic and resistance reduced self-rating anxiety scale, but AE also had an improvement effect on self-rating depression scale. CONCLUSION: Aerobic and resistance exercises can cause male college students with DSWPD to fall asleep earlier, improve sleep quality, increase melatonin concentration, reduce body inflammation, promote the synthesis of anti-inflammatory cytokines, and improve mood. Of the two exercise intervention methods, the effect of RE was more significant.",

DESIGN: In this experimental study, an intervention and control group were pair-matched by age, sex and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity. METHOD: 114 participants either completed a 20 min moderately-intense exercise bout on a cycling ergometer or watched a 20 min video. Prior to and after these conditions, a computer-based Stroop task was administered. During the cognitive task, heart rate variability (HRV) was measured using electrocardiography. RESULTS: Path-analyses did not support an association between group and posttest accuracy on the Stroop task, while controlling for pretest scores. However, the intervention group had lower time-domain based HRV at posttest. The examination of mediation models revealed a moderation by sex, as the relation of lower time-domain based HRV with higher accuracy on both congruent and incongruent trials of the Stroop task was observed in girls only. CONCLUSION: A single aerobic exercise session does not necessarily improve inhibitory control in preadolescent children. However, the manipulation of the autonomic state towards a parasympathetic withdrawal has the potential to alter inhibitory control in girls in particular.",

      "abstract": "Aims/Background A novel exercise protocol for cardiac rehabilitation aerobic (CRA) has been developed by Hebei Sport University, demonstrating efficacy in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD). The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of CRA on precise cardiac rehabilitation (CR) for CHD patients presenting with stable angina pectoris. Methods The study cohort comprised patients with stable angina who were categorized into three groups: the CRA group (n = 35), the power bicycles (PB) group (n = 34), and the control group (n = 43). In addition to standard treatment, the CRA group underwent a 12-week CRA-based CR intervention, while the PB group participated in a similar program centered on PB exercise, and the control group received only standard treatment. Results At the end of the 12-week intervention, significant differences were observed among the groups in several physiological parameters, including systolic blood pressure (SBP), fasting blood glucose (FBG), triglycerides (TG), total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), Glycated Haemoglobin (Hb-A1c), peak oxygen uptake (Peak VO2), anaerobic threshold (AT), and Peak VO2/heart rate (HR) (p < 0.05). Both the CRA and PB groups showed significant reductions in SBP, FBG, TG, TC, LDL, and Hb-A1c compared to the control group (p < 0.05). Additionally, both groups exhibited significant improvements in Peak VO2, AT, and Peak VO2/HR (p < 0.05). Intra-group analysis revealed that the CRA group showed significant improvements from baseline to post-intervention in SBP, diastolic blood pressure (DBP), FBG, TG, TC, high-density lipoprotein (HDL), LDL, Hb-A1c, Peak VO2, AT, and Peak VO2/HR (p < 0.05). Similarly, the PB group demonstrated significant improvements across these parameters (p < 0.05). Conclusion Both CRA and PB exercises are safe and effective for achieving precise CR in patients with CHD. A 12-week CRA intervention, conducted three times per week for 30 minutes per session, significantly improves cardiopulmonary function and biochemical makers in patients with stable angina. These improvements are comparable to those achieved through PB exercise in precise CR.",

      "abstract": "Prediabetes, a state between normoglycemia and diabetes, is increasingly affecting population health; thus, it should not be overlooked. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to explore the efficacy of aerobic exercise on blood glucose indicators among those with prediabetes. Five databases, including PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and CINAHL, were searched up to September 2024 to identify randomized controlled trials measuring the effect of aerobic exercise on blood glucose levels among individuals with prediabetes. Data on fasting blood glucose (FBG), 2-h postprandial plasma glucose (2hPG), and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) were extracted. Subgroup analyses were conducted based on intervention duration, weekly exercise duration, and volume. In total, 2518 relevant records were initially retrieved, and 16 studies were included in this systematic review, with 14 providing sufficient data for meta-analysis. Compared to the control group, the weighted mean difference (MD) for FBG, 2hPG, and HbA1c was -1.33 (95%CI: -1.87, -0.89), -1.00 (95%CI: -1.60, -0.39), and -1.05 (95%CI: -1.49, -0.61), respectively. Subgroup analysis showed that pooled effect size for FBG, 2hPG, and HbA1c was greater in the subgroup subjected to ≥48 weeks of intervention compared to the subgroup subjected to ≤24 weeks of intervention, although only the difference in FBG was significant (p < 0.05). Weekly exercise longer than 180 min/week led to greater reductions in FBG, 2hPG, and HbA1c compared to weekly exercise shorter than 150 min/week, and only differences in 2hPG were not significant (p > 0.05). Total weekly exercise of 1314-1323 MET·min/week led to greater reductions in FBG and HbA1c levels compared to 975-1080 MET·min/week (p > 0.05). Aerobic exercise effectively decreases FBG, 2hPG, and HbA1c and controls blood glucose levels. The volume and duration of aerobic exercise are important factors affecting the reduction in blood glucose levels, exhibiting a positive correlation within a specific range. Aerobic exercise can serve as a viable therapeutic approach for reducing the risk of diabetes among individuals with prediabetes."

      "abstract": "Backgrounds and Objectives: Obesity presents a significant global public health challenge and is associated with declines in both general and food-related inhibitory control, crucial for maintaining a healthy weight and preventing obesity progression. An increasing body of research suggests that acute aerobic exercise may improve inhibitory function. However, the effects and underlying mechanisms of acute aerobic exercise on both general and food-related inhibition in obese adults remain unclear. This study aimed to explore the potential impacts and underlying neuroelectronic mechanisms of a single session of aerobic exercise at varying intensities on general and food-related inhibitory functions among young adult males with obesity. Design: A within-subject design comprising three sessions (control, low-intensity exercise, moderate-intensity exercise) × three picture types (high-calorie food, low-calorie food, neutral picture) was employed. Methods: Eighteen young adult males with obesity [body mass index (BMI): 34.60 ± 4.21 kg/m2, aged 24.50 ± 5.13 years (Mean ± SD)] were recruited. They participated in three intervention sessions: acute aerobic exercise at low [40-50% maximal Heart Rate (HRmax)], moderate (65-70% HRmax), and a control session (sitting rest), separated by five-day intervals in a counterbalanced order. Following each session, participants performed a food-related Go/No-go task, and EEG recordings (N2 and P3 components) were conducted within 15 min. Results: Moderate-intensity exercise elicited larger N2 amplitudes compared to the control session across different picture types and task conditions. However, there was no significant effect on behavioral indicators or P3 amplitude across sessions. Additionally, food stimuli (both high- and low-calorie) resulted in lower No-go accuracy and smaller N2 amplitudes compared to neutral stimuli. Conclusions: Acute moderate-intensity exercise might influence general and food-related inhibitory function in obese individuals at the neuroelectric stage, potentially by enhancing attentional resources for managing cognitive control and conflict detection. Moreover, reduced N2 amplitudes and No-go accuracy in response to food stimuli compared to non-food stimuli indicate a diminished ability to allocate attentional and neural resources to manage food-related conflicts. However, due to the relatively small sample size, caution is advised when generalizing these findings to the broader population. The pilot test indicated that obese participants had difficulty sustaining high-intensity exercise at 80-90% of their maximum heart rate for a continuous or 20 min period, highlighting potential challenges in exercise adherence at high intensities within this population. Future research is needed to utilize interdisciplinary approaches and multimodal technologies to clarify how exercise influences food-related cognition, appetite regulation, and brain mechanisms in obesity, aiming to better contribute to the prevention and treatment of obesity."

OBJECTIVES: To ascertain the efficacy of exercise (AE) for activity and participation (AP) level in people with HAND. METHOD: This is a randomised controlled trial that is parallel-group in nature, with intention-to-treat analysis and disguised allocation. Seventy-three people with HAND in total were randomised at random to the AE and control groups. Three 20-60-min sessions of moderate-intensity AE training on a cycle ergometer were included of the 12-week intervention. Individual tolerability served as the basis for progression. Three months after the intervention, at the conclusion of the intervention, and at the baseline, outcomes were measured. The AP constitutes the main outcome variable. To investigate the impact of AE on AP level, rank analysis of covariance was performed after log-transformation. RESULTS: When comparing the AE to the control group, there were significant increases in social wellbeing AP (Cohen d = 0.550; p = 0.021), emotion AP (Cohen d = 0.641; p = 0.007) and overall AP level (Cohen d = 0.896; p < 0.001). There was no discernible variation in AP across the groups three months following AE (Cohen d = 0.437; p = 0.067). CONCLUSION: AE induces a small increase in AP among individuals with HAND. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: For people with HAND, regular AE is a good way to manage AP restriction. Increasing AE participation may improve AP restriction."

      "abstract": "Aphasia, a communication disorder caused primarily by left-hemisphere stroke, affects millions of individuals worldwide, with up to 70% experiencing significant reading impairments. These deficits negatively impact independence and quality of life, highlighting the need for effective treatments that target the cognitive and neural processes essential to reading recovery. This Randomized Clinical Trial (RCT) aims to test the efficacy of a combined intervention incorporating aerobic exercise training (AET) and phono-motor treatment (PMT) to enhance reading recovery in individuals with post-stroke aphasia. AET, known for its positive impact on cerebral blood flow (CBF) and oxygenation, is hypothesized to facilitate neuroplasticity when administered before PMT, an intensive therapy aimed at strengthening phonological processing. While most existing treatments focus on spoken language production, this study builds on evidence that PMT can also improve reading skills. The study is structured as a Phase I/II clinical trial and compares the effects of AET plus PMT to a control condition of stretching plus PMT on reading and other language outcomes including naming, auditory comprehension, and spontaneous speech. Additionally, it investigates the immediate and sustained impacts of the intervention on CBF, functional connectivity, and task-evoked brain activity. The central hypothesis posits that AET will increase CBF and, when combined with PMT, will lead to enhanced reading recovery, supporting treatment-induced plasticity. This trial represents one of the first large-scale interventions targeting post-stroke reading impairments and provides critical insights into the potential of combining AET with cognitive rehabilitation to improve language recovery in aphasia.",

      "abstract": "Infections of the nervous system, such as acute bacterial meningitis, pose serious health problems that require immediate intervention. In experimental animals, exposure to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is used to induce meningitis. Aside from drug intervention to reduce inflammation in meningitis, aerobic exercise helps to maintain the regulatory mechanisms of brain homeostasis through anti-inflammatory mechanisms. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of aerobic exercise on malondialdehyde (MDA), nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB), insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), apoptosis, and spatial memory. A four-week experimental study was conducted using 18 rats, which were randomly divided into three different groups (six rats per group): healthy rats as negative controls (non-meningitis), a treatment group treated with antibiotic treatment (meningitis group), and a third group (aerobic exercise group) treated with antibiotics and aerobic exercise following LPS-induced meningitis. Data were analyzed using a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) test, and the comparison between groups used the Bonferroni post-hoc test. The results showed that aerobic exercise significantly reduced MDA (p<0.001), NF-κB (p=0.035), and apoptosis (p=0.020) while increasing the serum levels of IGF-1 (p<0.001), eNOS (p=0.011), and BDNF (p=0.001) levels. Improvement in spatial memory was significant in the aerobic exercise group (p<0.001). This study suggested that aerobic exercise could be a promising adjunct therapy in meningitis management strategies, particularly due to its effect on improving spatial memory. Further clinical trials are needed to confirm these findings for clinical use.",

      "abstract": "Regular aerobic exercise has a significant impact on glucose metabolism and lipid profiles, contributing to overall health improvement. However, evidence for optimal exercise duration to achieve these effects is limited. This study aims to explore the effects of 4 and 8 weeks of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise on glucose metabolism, lipid profiles, and associated metabolic changes in young female students with insulin resistance and varying body mass, seeking to determine the optimal duration for physiological adaptations. Twenty-eight physically semi-active female students were randomly assigned to 4-week (G4, n = 13, age = 23.31 ± 5.19, BMI = 24.78 ± 5.87) and 8-week (G8, n = 15, age = 21.8 ± 2.56, BMI = 24.95 ± 4.81) training groups. The aerobic intervention maintained an intensity of 40-70% of maximum heart rate (HRmax). 6-min-walk test (6MWT), handgrip strength tests, insulin, HOMA-IR, lipid profiles, and metabolic profiles were assessed pre- and post-intervention. Following the intervention, G8, but not G4, exhibited a significant decrease in HOMA-IR (-14.59%, p = 0.047). The improvement in HOMA-IR was accompanied by notable improvements in 6-MWT (+ 38.18%, p < 0.001) and handgrip strength (+ 11.62, p = 0.027 and + 17.59%, p = 0.013), and increased levels of bilirubin degradation products, ribose, and glutarate. The elevated levels of bilirubin degradation products, known for their antioxidant properties, suggested a potential antioxidative response triggered by prolonged aerobic exercise. Additionally, an increase in ribose and glutarate indicated improved metabolic flexibility and enhanced utilization of alternative energy substrates. The 8-week aerobic exercise regimen demonstrated enhanced insulin sensitivity, upper body strength, and cardiovascular performance in young females compared to a 4-week regimen by triggering specific metabolic adaptations. These findings emphasize the complex relationship between exercise duration, metabolic adaptations, and overall well-being in young women, providing valuable insights for optimizing exercise prescriptions in promoting metabolic health.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Fibromyalgia is a condition characterised by disabling levels of pain of varying intensity. Aerobic exercise may play a role in reducing pain in these patients. The aim of this review is to assess the dose of aerobic exercise needed, based on the frequency, intensity, type, time, volume and progression (FITT-VP) model, to obtain clinically relevant reductions in pain. DATABASES AND DATA TREATMENT: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised clinical trials was conducted in the Web of Science (WoS), PEDro, PubMed and Scopus databases, the search having been conducted between July and October of 2023. Risk of bias was assessed with the Cochrane Risk of Bias assessment tool 2. RESULTS: Seventeen studies were included. The risk of bias varied, with six studies showing low risk; five, some concerns; and six, high risk. Aerobic exercise interventions were analysed using the FITT-VP model. Frequency ranged from 1 to 10 times per week, intensity varied from light to vigorous, and the types of exercise included music-based exercise, interval training, pool-based exercise, stationary cycling, swimming and walking. The intervention durations ranged from 3 to 24 weeks, with session lengths ranging from 10 to 45 min. Most of the studies presented significant differences, favouring aerobic exercise (MD -0.49; CI [-0.90, -0.08; p = 0.02]), with moderate to low heterogeneity in subgroup analyses. CONCLUSIONS: The study findings underscore the efficacy of aerobic exercise in alleviating pain among fibromyalgia patients, advocating for tailored exercise dosing to optimise adherence and outcomes. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Individuals with fibromyalgia should engage in aerobic exercises two to three times weekly, for twenty-five to forty minutes in each session, aiming for more than a hundred minutes per week. They should start at low intensity, gradually increasing to higher intensities over six to twelve weeks, for optimal pain management. Exercise types should be selected in collaboration with the patient and based on personal preferences and accessibility, such as walking, and swimming, to ensure long-term adherence to the regimen.",

There are also insufficient study reviews for specific workout and assessment tool types. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to systematically investigate the effects of aerobic exercise on the quality of life, cognitive performance and depressive symptoms in people with AD. DESIGN: Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool, systematic reviews and meta-analyses using random-effects modelling, and certainty of evidence using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation tool. DATA SOURCES: PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, Scopus, CINAHL and CNKI through 12 March 2024. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: The analysis includes all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that used aerobic exercise as an intervention for individuals with AD. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Two writers selected and searched for data using defined techniques. To investigate possible sources of heterogeneity between studies, meta-regression was carried out using Stata MP V.18.0 and V.14.0 software, standardised mean differences (SMDs) and 95% CIs were computed, and data were reviewed using Review Manager V.5.4 software, which was made available by the Cochrane Collaboration. Sensitivity analyses were employed to ascertain the stability and reliability of the results, and funnel plots and Egger's test were employed to check for publication bias. Correction and assessment of publication bias was done using Duval and Tweedie clipping methods. RESULTS: Aerobic exercise enhanced cognitive function. For the Minimum Mental State Examination (MMSE) (SMD=0.95, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.32, Z=5.06, p<0.00001), Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Section (ADAS-cog) (SMD=-0.67, 95% CI -1.15 to -0.2, Z=2.77, p=0.006) and quality of life (SMD=0.36, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.64, Z=2.51, p=0.01), but not statistically significant for depressive symptoms (SMD=-0.25, 95% CI -0.63 to 0.13, Z=1.27, p=0.21). Subgroup analysis showed that duration greater than 16 weeks and less than 50 min per intervention improved MMSE Scores. Duration greater than 16 weeks and more than 30 min per intervention improved ADAS-cog Scores in patients with AD. Aerobic exercise greater than 16 weeks, with more than three interventions per week and 30-50 min per intervention improves quality of life in patients with AD. CONCLUSION: The study revealed that aerobic exercise was conducive to the improvement of cognitive function and quality of life among patients with AD, yet it did not exert a significant impact on the amelioration of depressive symptoms. Nevertheless, given the high level of heterogeneity and the variations in the quality of the included studies, the conclusions require further verification through more scientifically objective RCTs.

METHODS: Employing the PRISMA and PERSiST guidelines, a comprehensive search across nine databases (Web of Science, PubMed, Scopus, PsycINFO, SportDiscus, CINAHL, Medline, Embase, and CNKI) yielded a total of 782 relevant studies. Following rigorous selection criteria, 26 eligible studies (comprising 22 different samples) were included in the analysis, featuring a combined sample size of 1308 participants. The meta-analysis was conducted via R. RESULTS: AE notably decreased depressive symptoms among youth [g = -0.92; 95% CI (-1.16, -0.69); p < 0.01]. Significant dose‒response relationships were observed across age groups [β = -0.06; 95% CI (-0.12, 0.00), p < 0.05], the intensity [β = -0.03; 95% CI (-0.06, 0.00); p < 0.05], and the duration ^ 2 [β = 0.001, 95% CI (0.001, 0.002), p < 0.05] of the AE intervention. CONCLUSIONS: Aerobic exercise interventions can effectively alleviate depressive symptoms in youth. A moderate-intensity AE program, lasting 25-40 min and conducted three times a week for 9-15 weeks, can increase alleviation of depression.",

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of aerobic exercise and resistance training on metabolic markers in postmenopausal women with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) by means of a systematic review and meta-analysis. METHODS: The searches were completed using EMBASE, MEDLINE/PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science databases. This study included non-blinded, single or double-blinded randomized control trials and postmenopausal women diagnosed with T2DM. The imposed intervention was aerobic exercise plus any training protocol to strengthen muscle groups for resistance intervention. The outcomes of interest were the blood glucose levels, insulin secretion, homeostasis model assessment-insulin resistance index (HOMA-IR) and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c). Risk of Bias tools and GRADE were obligatory. RESULTS: Three studies were included (83 participants). Exercise intervention ranged between two to four days per week. Compared to the control group, in the group submitted to aerobic exercise + resistance training, no significant change was noted for HbA1c (subtotal = mean difference - 0.35 [95% CI: -0.85, 0.15], p = .17, and heterogeneity = 0%) (GRADE: very low), nevertheless, HOMA-IR index was significantly improved (subtotal = mean difference -0.52 [95% CI: -0.99, -0.05], p = .03, and heterogeneity = 0%) (GRADE: very low). CONCLUSION: Despite the very low certainty found in the quality of evidences, our analysis showed that aerobic exercise along with strength exercise seems to improve some metabolic diabetes markers in postmenopausal women with T2DM. There is a need for further studies to support our preliminary findings.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Although guidelines support aerobic exercise in sub-acute mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI), evidence for adults with persisting post-concussive symptoms (PPCS) after mTBI is lacking. The objective was to evaluate the impact of a sub-symptom threshold aerobic exercise intervention on overall symptom burden and quality of life in adults with PPCS. METHODS: This prospective cohort study was nested within the ACTBI Trial (Aerobic Exercise for treatment of Chronic symptoms following mild Traumatic Brain Injury). A total of 50 adults with a diagnosis of mTBI, PPCS and exercise intolerance completed a 12-week sub-symptom threshold aerobic exercise intervention either immediately after enrollment (i-AEP group; n = 27) or following 6-weeks of stretching (d-AEP group; n = 23). Data from all participants (n = 50) were included in the combined AEP (c-AEP) group. The primary outcome was symptom burden on the Rivermead Post Concussion Symptoms Questionnaire (RPQ). Secondary outcomes included measures of quality of life and specific post-concussive symptoms (depressive and anxiety symptoms, functional impact of headache, fatigue, sleep, dizziness and exercise tolerance). Heart rate, blood pressure and heart rate variability were also assessed to understand autonomic function response to intervention. RESULTS: Participants were a mean (SD) of 42.6 (10.9) years old (74% female) and 25.1 (14.1) months post-mTBI. Following 12-weeks of intervention participants had a significant improvement in symptom burden on the RPQ (i-AEP: mean change = -9.415, p < 0.001; d-AEP: mean change = -3.478, p = 0.034; c-AEP: mean change = -6.446, p < 0.001). Participants also had significant improvement in quality of life (i-AEP: mean change = 9.879, p < 0.001; d-AEP: mean change = 7.994, p < 0.001, c-AEP: mean change = 8.937, p < 0.001), dizziness (i-AEP: mean change = -11.159, p = 0.001; d-AEP: mean change = -6.516, p = 0.019; c-AEP: -8.837, p < 0.001) and exercise tolerance (i-AEP: mean change = 5.987, p < 0.001; d-AEP: mean change = 3.421, p < 0.001; c-AEP: mean change = 4.703, p < 0.001). Headache (mean change = -5.522, p < 0.001) and depressive symptoms (mean change = -3.032, p = 0.001) improved in the i-AEP group. There was no change in measures of autonomic function. CONCLUSION: A 12-week aerobic exercise intervention improves overall symptom burden, quality of life and specific symptom domains in adults with PPCS. Clinicians should consider prescription of progressive, individualized, sub-symptom threshold aerobic exercise for adults with PPCS even if presenting with exercise intolerance and months-to-years of symptoms."

      "abstract": "Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a chronic metabolic disorder that increases the prevalence of cognitive impairment in the geriatric population. Aerobic exercise is an excellent non-pharmacological therapeutic strategy to prevent Alzheimer's disease, the most common form of dementia. The exact molecular mechanism of aerobic exercise (Exe) as an intervention to counter cognitive decline is far from clear. Metformin is a first-line agent against T2DM with neuroprotective properties. The present study assessed the role of treadmill exercise in combination with a low dose of metformin (Met; 70 mg/kg) in cognitive impairment and its associated molecular mechanism in T2DM rats. The experimental model of T2DM-associated cognitive decline was created by administration of a high-fat diet (HFD) with a low dose of streptozotocin (STZ; 35 mg/kg). Neurobehavioral assessments were performed to evaluate spatial recognition and fear-conditioned memory across the groups: control, HFD + STZ, HFD + STZ + Exe, and HFD + STZ + Exe + Met. In addition, we performed immunohistochemistry and western blotting on the rat hippocampal tissue from the above groups for protein expression studies. T2DM rats showed a significant cognitive decline compared to the control group, which improved in the long-term exercise and metformin co-administered animals. The level of neuroinflammation was significantly elevated in the hippocampal tissue of T2DM rats compared to the control and lowered after exercise and metformin treatment. T2DM reduced mature neurons and neurogenesis while increasing astrogliosis and microgliosis, ameliorated by exercise and metformin treatment. Moreover, T2DM impaired hippocampal neurogenesis by reducing the canonical Wnt/β-catenin pathway, which got upregulated in exercise and metformin-co-administered rats. Long-term aerobic exercise with metformin treatment ameliorated neuroinflammation and promoted adult hippocampal neurogenesis via upregulating the canonical Wnt/β-catenin pathway in T2DM rats.",

      "abstract": "Vascular cognitive impairment and dementia (VCID), resulting from chronic cerebral hypoperfusion, represent the second most prevalent form of dementia globally. Aerobic exercise is widely acknowledged as an effective intervention for various cognitive disorders. This study utilized a bilateral common carotid artery stenosis (BCAS) model to investigate whether aerobic exercise promotes cognitive recovery through the Annexin-A1 (ANXA1)/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) axis in BCAS mice. Our findings demonstrate that aerobic exercise improved spatial memory in BCAS mice by enhancing white matter (WM) integrity and hippocampal function. WM integrity was confirmed through Luxol Fast Blue (LFB) staining and protein assays. Additionally, aerobic exercise mitigated BCAS-induced long-term potentiation (LTP) decay and upregulated hippocampal expression of key synaptic proteins, including N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor subunits NR2B and NR1, vesicular glutamate transporter 1 (vGluT1), and the synaptic scaffolding protein postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD95). Furthermore, aerobic exercise enhanced the expression of the anti-inflammatory mediator ANXA1 through exosome secretion while simultaneously suppressing the MAPK signaling pathway. These molecular changes were associated with increased astrocyte proliferation and the polarization of astrocytes toward the A2 phenotype. These findings were further validated using an in vitro co-culture model of astrocytes (U251) and neurons (HT22). In summary, our study demonstrates that aerobic exercise improves WM integrity and hippocampal function by modulating the ANXA1/MAPK axis following astrocyte polarization. Thus, aerobic exercise emerges as a promising intervention for promoting functional recovery in VCID."

      "abstract": "Obesity can change the immune microenvironment of adipose tissue and induce inflammation. This study is dedicated to exploring the internal mechanism by which different intensities of exercise reprogram the immune microenvironment of epididymal adipose tissue in nutritionally obese mice. C57BL/6J male obese mouse models were constructed by high-fat diet, which were respectively obese control group (OC), moderate-intensity continuous exercise group (HF-M), high-intensity continuous exercise group (HF-H), and high-intensity intermittent exercise group (HF-T). The exercise group was subjected to aerobic exercise intervention for 8 wk, and samples of mice were collected at the fourth and eighth week, respectively. Mice blood, liver, and adipose tissue of the epididymis were collected for index detection and adipose tissue ordinary transcriptome sequencing. After exercise intervention, when compared with the OC group, the morphology and blood indexes of the exercise groups were significantly improved. The liver lipid content was decreased, adipose tissue inflammation was reduced, and the mRNA and protein expression levels of IL-1β, F4/80, and CD64 in adipose tissue were significantly decreased (P < 0.01). Among the three exercise groups, the effect of the HF-T group was more significant. When compared with the OC group, fibroblast-specific marker genes, neutrophil marker genes, macrophage marker genes, and immune-related signaling pathways were significantly downregulated in the HF-T group. Exercise can reshape the immune microenvironment of adipose tissue, and high-intensity intermittent aerobic exercise is the most effective.NEW & NOTEWORTHY The present study has revealed that obesity is capable of altering the immune microenvironment within adipose tissue, thereby giving rise to inflammation. It has been demonstrated that exercise holds the potential to reverse the onset of inflammatory responses, with high-intensity intermittent aerobic exercise emerging as the most efficacious approach.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Insulin resistance (IR) is central to the progression of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (MAFLD). While aerobic exercise reduces hepatic fat and enhances insulin sensitivity, the specific mechanisms-particularly those involving exosomal pathways-are not fully elucidated. METHOD: Exosomes were isolated from 15 MAFLD patients' plasma following the final session of a 12-week aerobic exercise intervention. Liver fat content was measured using MRI-PDFF, and metabolic parameters were assessed via OGTT, HOMA-IR, QUICKI, and VO2 max. Co-culture experiments evaluated the effects of exercise-derived exosomes on IR signaling pathways. miRNA microarray analysis identified miR-324, which was quantified in high-fat diet (HFD) mice with and without exercise and compared between athletes and sedentary controls. Functional assays assessed miR-324's role in glucose and lipid metabolism, while luciferase reporter and Western blot assays confirmed ROCK1 as its direct target. RESULT: Aerobic exercise significantly reduced liver fat and improved insulin sensitivity in both MAFLD patients and HFD mice. Notably, exosomal miR-324 levels were lower in athletes than sedentary controls, indicating an inverse association with insulin sensitivity. Post-exercise, precursor and mature miR-324 increased in adipose tissue and decreased in muscle, suggesting its adipose origin and inverse regulation. Functional assays demonstrated that miR-324 modulates insulin resistance by targeting ROCK1. CONCLUSION: Exercise-induced exosomal miR-324 from adipose tissue targets ROCK1, revealing a novel mechanism by which aerobic exercise confers hepatoprotection against insulin resistance in MAFLD. These findings enhance our understanding of how exercise influences metabolic health and may inform future therapeutic strategies for managing MAFLD and related conditions."

Symptoms appear gradually, and pathological brain changes may occur twenty years before the physical and psychological signs, pointing to the urgent development of preventive interventions. Physical activity has been investigated as a preventive tool to defeat the main biological features of AD: pathological amyloid protein plaques, tau tangles, myelin degeneration, and iron deposits in the brain. This work quantifies tau tangles, amyloid, iron, and ferroptosis in oligodendrocytes in the aged rat hippocampal formation and statistically correlates neuron-neuron, neuron-glia, and glia-glia crosstalk and the effect of physical exercise on it. Our results indicate that iron overload in the oligodendrocytes is an inducer of ferroptosis; physical exercise reduces inflammaging, and improves axon-myelin volume relations; tau, amyloid, iron, and hippocampal formation cells present statistical correlations. Our data suggest the beneficial effects of physical exercise in AD and a mathematical relationship between the hippocampal formation cells in sedentary and active individuals, which should be considered in human and animal studies as a guide to a better understanding of crosstalk physiology.",

      "abstract": "IMPORTANCE: Current guidance on the duration of aerobic exercise recommended in existing guidelines comes primarily from individual trials. Meta-analyses are lacking to examine the dose-response association of aerobic exercise with adiposity measures. OBJECTIVE: To clarify the dose-response association of aerobic exercise with adiposity measures. DATA SOURCES: PubMed, Scopus, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and gray literature sources (ProQuest and ClinicalTrials.gov) from inception to April 30, 2024. STUDY SELECTION: Randomized clinical trials with intervention durations of at least 8 weeks evaluating the effects of supervised aerobic training on adults with overweight or obesity. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: The PRISMA guidelines were followed to report the results of the meta-analysis. Data extraction was conducted by 2 teams of 2 reviewers each, working independently and in duplicate. Random-effects meta-analyses were performed to estimate mean differences and 95% CIs for each 30-minute per week aerobic exercise and to clarify the shape of the curvilinear associations. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Measures of body weight, waist circumference, body fat, adverse events, medication use reduction, and health-related quality of life score. The certainty of evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) tool, with a range from very low to high certainty. RESULTS: In total, 116 randomized clinical trials involving 6880 participants (4199 [61%] female; mean [SD] age, 46 [13] years) with overweight or obesity were included. Each 30 minutes per week of aerobic exercise was associated with reduced body weight by 0.52 kg (95% CI, -0.61 to -0.44 kg; n = 109 trials, GRADE = moderate), waist circumference by 0.56 cm (95% CI, -0.67 to -0.45 cm; n = 62 trials, GRADE = high), body fat percentage by 0.37% (95% CI, -0.43% to -0.31%; n = 65 trials, GRADE = moderate), as well as the areas of visceral (mean difference, -1.60 cm2 [95% CI, -2.12 to -1.07 cm2]; n = 26 trials, GRADE = high) and subcutaneous (mean difference, -1.37 cm2 [95% CI, -1.82 to -0.92 cm2]; n = 27 trials, GRADE = moderate) adipose tissues. Aerobic exercise was associated with modestly increased physical (standardized mean difference, 1.69 SD [95% CI, 1.18-2.20 SD]) and mental (standardized mean difference, 0.74 SD [95% CI, 0.29-1.19 SD]) aspects of quality of life (1 trial with 80 participants, GRADE = low). It was associated with modestly increased mild to moderate adverse events, which were mostly musculoskeletal symptoms (risk difference, 2 more events per 100 participants [95% CI, 1 to 2 more]; GRADE = low). Dose-response meta-analyses indicated that body weight, waist circumference, and body fat measures decreased linearly or monotonically in association with increasing duration of aerobic exercise to 300 minutes per week, with aerobic exercise lasting 150 minutes per week at moderate to vigorous intensities resulting in clinically important reductions in waist circumference and body fat. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials, engaging in 30 minutes of aerobic exercise per week was associated with modest reductions in body weight, waist circumference, and body fat measures among adults with overweight or obesity. However, aerobic training exceeding 150 minutes per week at moderate intensity or greater may be needed to achieve clinically important reductions.",

      "abstract": "Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) is a systemic vasculitis that can lead to persistent pain and fatigue, significantly impacting patients' quality of life. This study assessed the effects of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) combined with aerobic exercise as a non-pharmacological intervention for managing fatigue in GPA patients. Two patients were randomly assigned to receive either active tDCS or simulated tDCS stimulation (sham) during low-intensity aerobic exercise. The assessments included body mass index, fat and lean mass percentages, waist-to-hip ratio, C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and disease activity using the Birmingham Vasculitis Activity Score. Chronic fatigue was measured using the Modified Fatigue Impact Scale, the Fatigue Severity Scale, and the visual analog scale for fatigue. Sleep quality, activities of daily living, and functional capacity were evaluated through standardized tests. Results indicated that tDCS significantly reduced chronic fatigue by approximately 60%, nearly twice as much as the sham patient. Additionally, the tDCS patient showed improvements in physical activity levels, functional capacity, handgrip strength, daily activities, and sleep quality. In contrast, the sham patient showed declines in physical activity and minimal improvement in chronic fatigue. Overall, tDCS appears to be a promising intervention to enhance chronic fatigue and the quality of life in patients with GPA without causing disease reactivation or adverse effects."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular diseases are among the most common and clinically significant comorbidities of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Exercise has been shown to reduce the risk of cardiovascular diseases, and high-intensity inspiratory muscle training (H-IMT) has emerged as a promising intervention for improving arterial stiffness in individuals with COPD. Yet, there is limited evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) regarding the impact of H-IMT alone or in combination with exercise on reducing arterial stiffness in COPD. We designed a three-arm RCT to evaluate the effectiveness of H-IMT, both alone and in combination with exercise, in reducing brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV) in individuals with stable COPD within a community setting. METHODS: This is a three-arm, parallel-group, assessor-blinded, randomized controlled trial with an eight-week intervention period and a 24-week follow-up. The trial will recruit a total of at least 162 participants with stable COPD. All participants will undergo arterial stiffness assessment using an atherosclerosis detector. Eligible participants will then be randomized into either a control group or one of two intervention groups: an H-IMT group combined with aerobic and resistance trainin, or an H-IMT group alone. The primary outcome is the baPWV at eight weeks. Secondary outcomes include baPWV at 4, 16, and 32 weeks, along with self-reported lifestyle factors, sleep quality, mental health outcomes, self-efficacy, implicit health attitudes, quality of life, and clinical outcomes at 4, 8, 16, and 32 weeks. The main analysis will follow the intention-to-treat principle, with the difference in outcome between groups analyzed using multi-level regression at eight weeks. DISCUSSION: This study will provide evidence on the effects of H-IMT and combined exercise interventions for individuals with COPD in a community setting, offering insights into the use of integrated approaches to enhance cardiovascular health among community-dwelling residents.

Group A received PRE and AE, group B received AE, group C received PRE, and group D received traditional medical treatment only. The intervention was implemented three days/week for six months. BMD was measured by Dual Energy X-ray Absorptiometry, muscle strength was measured by an isokinetic device, exercise capacity was measured by 6-min walk test, and HRQoL was measured by short form 36(SF-36). Every outcome was assessed at baseline, six months, and nine months. RESULTS: There were statistically significant differences among the groups in knee muscle strength, exercise capacity, and HRQol after 6 months (p < 0.05) in favor of the combined group. BMD increased significantly in the combined and PRE groups compared to the AE and control groups (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: PRE combined with AE were more beneficial than either exercise alone in improving knee muscle strength, exercise capacity, and HRQoL."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Type 2 diabetes, characterized by hyperglycemia, is closely linked to obesity and low-grade inflammation. Acute cocoa flavanols (CF) intake has demonstrated benefits in vasoreactivity, cognitive functions, and antioxidant enzyme activity. However, the physiological mechanisms of CF concerning glucose uptake, inflammatory mediators, and their interplay with aerobic exercise remain unclear in populations with metabolic diseases. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to investigate the acute effects of CF, alone or combined with acute aerobic exercise on mechanisms involved in glucose uptake and inflammatory mediators in the liver, skeletal muscle, pancreas, and adipose tissue in insulin-resistant (IR) rats. METHODS: Sixty-four Wistar rats (250 ± 10g; 15 weeks age) were subjected to a regular chow (CON) or an obesity-associated insulin-resistant (IR) state induced by a high-fat diet and fructose-rich beverage for 30 days. Seventy-two hours after an incremental maximal treadmill running test, rats received a placebo solution or CF supplementation (45 mg·kg-1 of body weight). One hour later, they either rested or ran on a treadmill at 60 % of peak oxygen uptake (VO2peak) for 30 min. Euthanasia occurred 30 min post-experimental sessions. Inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines were assayed using ELISA in the liver, pancreas, gastrocnemius muscle, and epididymal adipose tissues. TRB3 and CPT1 mRNA were assessed by q-RTPCR in the liver and gastrocnemius muscle while Akt and AMPK phosphorylation were examined by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: CF attenuated hyperglycemia observed after submaximal aerobic exercise in IR rats (p < 0.001). In the liver, CF exhibited additive effects to aerobic exercise, enhancing Akt protein phosphorylation, potentially contributing to improved glucose uptake in IR rats. Submaximal aerobic exercise and CF increased AMPK protein phosphorylation in the liver (p < 0.001) and skeletal muscle (p < 0.001), reduced TRB3 gene expression (p < 0.01), elevated CPT-1a gene expression (p < 0.001), and ameliorated the inflammatory milieu in the pancreas, adipose tissue, liver, and gastrocnemius muscle. CONCLUSION: Acute intake, of CF combined with submaximal aerobic exercise activates key proteins and genes involved in glucose uptake and lipid metabolism, improving the inflammatory milieu. This synergistic effect may contribute to mitigating metabolic complications associated with insulin resistance.",

Obesity may worsen PMS, but the impact of caloric restriction and aerobic exercise on PMS in obese women is unclear. This study examines their effects on PMS, anthropometric, and hormonal parameters in obese females. METHODS: This randomized controlled trial involved 40 obese females with PMS. They were randomly divided into two groups of 20 each. The control group (A) received medical treatment in the form of Brufen 400 mg: one tablet daily for 5 days before menstruation and two tablets daily during menstruation for 12 weeks. The study group (B) received the same medical treatment and additionally engaged in a program of caloric restriction and aerobic exercise for 12 weeks. Outcome measures included the premenstrual syndrome scale (PMSS), weight, body mass index (BMI), waist and hip circumferences, waist-hip (W/H) ratio, and serum levels of progesterone and cortisol. RESULTS: At baseline, no significant between-group differences were observed in PMSS scores, anthropometric measures (weight, BMI, waist and hip circumferences, W/H ratio), or hormonal parameters (serum cortisol and progesterone). Post-treatment, the study group (B) demonstrated significantly greater improvements compared to the control group (A), including reductions in PMSS scores, weight, BMI, waist and hip circumferences, W/H ratio, and serum cortisol, along with significantly higher serum progesterone levels (p < 0.05). DISCUSSION: A 12-week program of caloric restriction and aerobic exercise resulted in substantial improvements in PMS symptoms, anthropometric parameters, cortisol levels, and progesterone levels in obese females with PMS.",

METHOD: Using a crossover design, 25 participants (M = 20.20year, SD=0.91) completed 20 min of interventions at 1) moderate intensity exercise, 2) moderate intensity exercise with high cognitive demand (high cognitive-demand exercise), 3) moderate intensity exercise with high physical demand (high physical-demand exercise), and 4) rest condition (low physical and cognitive demand) in a counterbalanced way. Flanker task was completed before and after each intervention to evaluate their inhibitory control ability. RESULTS: The four interventions significantly reduce reaction times for both congruent and incongruent trials with Flanker task (all P < 0.05). Compared to acute moderate intensity exercise, high physical-demand exercise induced a greater reduction in reaction times for both trial types, whereas high cognitive-demand exercise led to faster reaction times in incongruent trials. CONCLUSION: Although each intervention effectively enhanced inhibitory control, the exercise demanding high cognitive and physical effort contributed to a more pronounced improvement in inhibitory control performance. This indicates that both increased physical and cognitive engagement can significantly improve the level of inhibitory control in young adults.",

RESULTS: At baseline, plasma cortisol concentrations decreased significantly after DST in the entire group, a 54% suppression which was associated with basal glucose. Basal glucose levels and glucose AUC from the OGTT are associated with basal cortisol levels (r = 0.44 and r = 0.29, p < 0.05 respectively). The intervention resulted in significant weight loss (-8%) but no significant changes in basal cortisol or changes in cortisol from basal to DST were observed.

METHODS: Thirty APP/PS1 double transgenic AD mice were randomly divided into three groups: model group, short-term exercise group, and long-term exercise group, with 10 mice in each group. Male non-transgenic mice of the same age served as the control group. The groups underwent swimming training for 6 weeks and 12 weeks, respectively. After the intervention, cognitive abilities were assessed using the Morris water maze test. Hippocampal tissue samples were analyzed for changes in superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity and malondialdehyde (MDA) content. ROS expression was observed using dihydroethidium probe, and Keap1, Nrf2, HO-1, and GPX4 protein levels were detected by Western blot analysis. RESULTS: Aerobic exercise significantly reduced the escape latency and increased both the time spent in the target quadrant and the number crossing the platform compared to the model group (p < 0.05). In the hippocampus, aerobic exercise significantly reduced the MDA content, while significantly increased SOD activity (p < 0.05). The level of ROS in the hippocampal region was significantly reduced by aerobic exercise (p < 0.05), with decreased Keap1 protein expression of and increased Nrf2, HO-1, GPX4 protein expression (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Aerobic exercise enhances memory and learning abilities, improves cognitive function, and reduces the oxidative stress levels in the hippocampus of AD mice, which involves in the activation of Keap1/Nrf2/GPX4 pathway."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Ischemic heart disease (IHD) presents a significant global health challenge, with myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury (MIRI) being a major pathophysiological contributor and lacking effective interventions. While aerobic exercise training (AET) enhances cardiovascular health, its protective mechanism in MIRI remains elusive. This study aims to elucidate the protective effect of AET in MIRI and its underlying mechanism. METHODS: A mouse model of AET and MIRI was established to evaluate basic indices, cardiac ultrasound, and myocardial injury markers. Dot Blot, qRT-PCR, and Western blot were employed to assess m6A RNA methylation levels and related protein expression in myocardial tissue. In vitro, primary cardiomyocyte culture was utilized to mimic MIRI, evaluating cell viability, mitochondrial membrane potential, etc. Finally, myocardial tissues of MIRI mice were immunoprecipitated for m6A RNA methylation and sequenced to analyze related signaling pathways. KEY RESULTS: AET significantly improved cardiac function and mitigated myocardial injury and fibrosis. Moreover, AET protected myocardium from MIRI by reducing m6A RNA methylation levels and modulating METTL3 expression. In vitro experiments demonstrated that the decrease in m6A RNA methylation levels and METTL3 expression conferred resistance to hypoxia/reoxygenation-induced injury. Furthermore, sequencing results indicated elevated myocardial tissue m6A RNA methylation levels during MIRI, activation of the Nrf2-related signaling pathway, and AET-mediated regulation of the Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway, thereby attenuating MIRI through modulation of METTL3-related m6A methylation. CONCLUSION AND SIGNIFICANCE: AET attenuates MIRI by reducing the level of METTL3-related m6A RNA methylation in cardiomyocytes and activating the Nrf2/HO-1 antioxidant signaling pathway. This finding provides a novel insight and strategy for the prevention and treatment of IHD, holding significant clinical implications.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Emerging evidences suggests that the disrupted branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) homeostasis and elevated BCAAs promote obesity-related insulin resistance (IR). Exercise improves insulin sensitivity. However, whether BCAAs plays a role in the exercise-attenuated IR remains to be fully investigated. METHODS: In this study, male C57BL/6J mice were induced to become diet-induced obese (DIO) and served as subjects. The initial investigation focused on the impact of exercise on IR and BCAAs. The DIO mice were randomly assigned to either a sedentary group (CON, n = 16) or an exercise group (EX, n = 16). The EX group underwent a 12-week aerobic exercise regimen on a treadmill. After 12-week, plasma BCAAs and branched-chain keto acids (BCKAs) were measured by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, glucose tolerance test (GTT) and insulin tolerance test (ITT) were performed, and the expression and phosphorylation of BCAAs catabolic proteins, as well as AKT T308 in gastrocnemius muscle and liver tissues, were evaluated using western blotting. Subsequently, the study explored the role of BCAAs in enhancing IR through exercise. Mice were randomly allocated into 4 groups: sedentary group (CON, n = 8), sedentary with BCAAs supplementation group (CON+BCAA, n = 8), exercise group (EX, n = 16), and exercise with BCAAs supplementation group (EX+BCAA, n = 16). The exercise protocol was as above. Mice in the BCAAs supplemented groups received drinking water containing 2% BCAAs. After 12-week, plasma BCAAs and BCKAs were measured, GTT and ITT tests were performed, and the phosphorylation of AKT T308, as well as p70S6K T389 in gastrocnemius muscle and liver, were compared between the EX group and the EX+BCAA group. Additionally, the phosphorylation of AMPKα T172 in both tissues was measured across all four groups. RESULTS: 12-week aerobic exercise improved insulin sensitivity in DIO mice while inducing BCAAs catabolic protein expression in skeletal muscle and liver, and reducing the plasma BCAAs level. Importantly, BCAAs supplementation elevated the plasma level of BCAAs and counteracted the exercise-attenuated IR. In skeletal muscle and liver tissues, BCAAs supplementation impaired the exercise-improved insulin signaling without enhancing mammalian target of rapamycin activity. AMPK activity was enhanced by aerobic exercise, which was abolished by BCAAs supplementation. CONCLUSION: Aerobic exercise attenuated insulin resistance via restoring BCAAs homeostasis and AMPK activity. The impacts of BCAAs intake on the metabolic effects of exercise sheds light on the combined exercise and nutrition intervention strategy for diabetes management."

      "abstract": "Recovery is a critical factor in athletic performance, and accelerating this process is essential to enable athletes to perform more effectively in both training load and competitive performance. After exercise, immediate recovery is potentially helpful for investigating autonomic activity levels, as they are definable with heart rate variability (HRV). The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of ten sessions of HRV-Biofeedback (HRV-BF) training on recovery process parameters after the aerobic performance. In this study, twenty-four soccer players aged 18-24 volunteered to participate. The athletes who met the research criteria were divided into an experimental group (n = 12) and a control group (n = 12). Each participant's height, weight, BMI, body fat percentage, and aerobic capacity were measured before and after the 10-session intervention. The experimental group participated in a 10-session HRV-BF training and soccer training program, while the control group only participated in a 10-session soccer training program. Aerobic capacity tests were then applied again to experimental and control group participants. The effect of biofeedback on the three HRV parameters during the 5-minute acute recovery period after the test was investigated. The results showed that regularly applied HRV-BF training can significantly shorten the HRV recovery parameter after exercise. Specifically, the athletes who performed HRV-BF training demonstrated faster cardiovascular recovery after aerobic exercise. This suggests that implementing HRV-BF training for athletes can significantly accelerate their recovery processes during and after competitions. Given recent technological advancements, it is promising to consider adding HRV-BF training to stress management interventions, particularly in relation to physiological stress indicators.",

METHODS: Up to March 20, 2023, a total of 16 articles and 19 RCT studies were retrieved from Web of Science, PubMed, Springer, Science Direct, China Knowledge Network, Wanfang, and VIP. The Cochrane Risk of Bias Assessment Tool was used to assess the quality of the literature, and We used RevMan5.3and STATA 16.0 software to provide a systematic review of included studies. RESULTS: The overall effect of low- and moderate-intensity aerobic exercise interventions for sleep disorders in menopausal women had a moderate effect size (SMD = -0.52, P < 0.001), and the effect values between different intervention frequencies (I2 = 60%), intervention duration (I2 = 60), intervention periods (I2 = 70), exercise forms (I2 = 70), and practice methods (I2 = 70) had moderate heterogeneity. The most significant effect sizes were found for intervention frequency of 3 times/week (SMD = -0.57, P < 0.001); intervention duration of 70-90 min/session (SMD = -0.64, P = 0.004); intervention period of 8-10 weeks (SMD = -0.59, P = 0.35); and exercise form of static exercise ( SMD = -0.55, P = 0.003); and the practice mode was an individual exercise with the most significant effect size (SMD = -0.66, P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: Low- and medium-intensity aerobic exercise intervention for sleep disorders in menopausal women has a good effect, but it is affected by training factors such as intervention frequency, intervention time, intervention period, exercise form, and practice mode; the best effect is achieved by adopting the dosage of 3 times/week, 70-90 min/times, and lasting for 8-10 weeks; aerobic intervention in the form of static exercise is the most effective; the best intervention effect is achieved by adopting the mode of individual exercise; but a group exercise approach improved exercise persistence in menopausal women.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) has become the leading cause of competitive mortality in female breast cancer (BC). Regular aerobic exercise (AE) has been widely accepted as an effective intervention to reduce cardiovascular risk in a variety of different clinical conditions. This study is aimed at evaluating the efficacy and safety of AE on cardiovascular risk factors in female BC and assessing the quality of the synthesized evidence. METHODS: We searched five English databases (Cochrane Library, PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and Web of Science) from inception to January 2023. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and cohort trials studying the effects of AE intervention on cardiovascular disease risk in female breast cancer were included. We used Stata 16 for data synthesis, Risk of Bias 2, and the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale for methodological quality evaluation and assessed the certainty of the synthesized evidence in the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations (GRADE) approach. RESULTS: Forty RCTs and 6 cohort trials involving 44,877 BC patients showed AE reduced the incidence of CVD events by 29.4% [risk ratio (RR) = 0.706, 95% confidence interval (CI) (0.659, 0.757), low certainty] and coronary artery disease events by 36% [RR = 0.640, 95% CI (0.561, 0.729), low certainty]. AE improved LVEF, and reduced weight and hip circumference. The subgroup analysis results showed that nonlinear AE increased VO2max by 5.354 ml·kg·min-1 [mean difference (MD) = 5.354, 95% CI (2.645, 8.062), very low certainty] and reduced fat mass by 4.256 kg [MD = 4.256, 95% CI (-3.839, -0.094), very low certainty]. While linear AE reduced low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) by 8.534 mg/dL [MD = -8.534, 95% CI (-15.511, -1.557), low certainty]. The sensitivity analysis results showed that each trial did not affect the impact index of the highly heterogeneous outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Our study indicates that AE has a positive effect in reducing cardiovascular risk factors. The individualization principle of AE deserves more attention in the future. This will provide new ideas to reduce CVD events and improve the quality of life in female BC patients. However, further research on AE in female BC should take into account long-term and well-designed administration to draw definitive conclusions.",

      "abstract": "Hypertension increases the risk of cerebrovascular disease and death. In addition to aerobic exercise, which is currently recommended for its antihypertensive effects, recent studies have suggested that dynamic and isometric resistance exercises also have antihypertensive effects. However, the magnitude of the antihypertensive effect of such resistance exercises is not well known. To clarify the differences in these effects, we conducted an umbrella review of a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs). A systematic search was performed on the Ovid MEDLINE and Cochrane Library, covering the period from inception to August 1, 2023. Eligible studies were RCTs comparing the effects of exercise and non-exercise on office, home, or ambulatory blood pressure (BP) in hypertensive patients aged 18 years or older. A random effects model meta-analysis was performed to estimate the effect size across multiple studies. A sub-analysis determined outcomes by the type of exercise (aerobic exercise, dynamic resistance exercise, isometric resistance exercise, and combined exercise). Eighty-four RCTs with 5065 hypertensive patients were included in the study. All exercise significantly reduced systolic BP (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP) compared to non-exercise (SBP:-7.52 mmHg, 95% confidence interval [CI] -8.77 to -6.27, p < 0.001; DBP: -4.36 mmHg, 95% CI - 5.15 to -3.57, p < 0.001). There were no significant differences in the magnitude of the reduction in BP between the types of exercise (p for interaction = 0.815 for SBP, p = 0.417 for DBP). These data from 84 RCTs showed that exercise intervention significantly reduced BP and that resistance exercise has a similar antihypertensive effect to aerobic exercise in hypertensive patients. This meta-analysis showed that exercise significantly reduced blood pressure in hypertensive patients. There were no significant differences in the magnitude of this reduction in BP between the types of exercise.",

METHODS: Review of systematic reviews and meta-analyses related to RCTs. PubMed, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Embase, and Cochrane databases of systematic reviews were searched extensively between September 2009 and September 2023. An extensive search was conducted using MeSH terms, including ''depression'', ''depressive disorder'', ''depressive symptoms'', ''exercise'', ''aerobic exercise'', ''aerobic training'', ''walking'', ''running'', ''jogging'', ''bicycling'', ''physical activity'', ''adult (limiters 18-65 years)'', ''meta-analyses'' and ''systematic reviews''. RESULT: In the initial search of the titles and abstracts of reviews, 2345 articles were found. 46 full-text reviews were selected for carefully scrutinized. A total of seven reviews were included in the analysis, and two of them were meta-analyses, which included 42 RCTs. The results of four reviews evaluated the effectiveness of aerobic exercise on depression. Moreover, two reviews examined the efficacy of aerobic exercise as an add-on intervention for depression treatment, one of which was a subgroup analysis. According to two reviews, aerobic exercise improved CRF in people with depression and affected people with MDD from a neurobiological standpoint. CONCLUSION: This umbrella review systematically evaluated the efficacy of aerobic exercise in treating adult depression, revealing substantial evidence that supports its potential to alleviate depressive symptoms. The positive synthesis of findings advocates for integrating aerobic exercise as a non-pharmacological treatment option. Nevertheless, additional research is essential to confirm these benefits and optimize exercise protocols for depression management.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: A single bout of aerobic exercise is known to induce a temporary reduction in post-exercise blood pressure termed post-exercise hypotension (PEH). Meanwhile, an ischemic preconditioning (IPC), a series of short ischemia-reperfusion intervention, has also shown antihypertensive effects showing a potential nonpharmacologic intervention for hypertension. While the acute BP reduction effects of aerobic exercise and IPC are individually well-investigated, it remains unclear if combining both interventions has an additive effect on PEH. METHODS: A total of twelve pre- or hypertensive men (six prehypertension, six stage 1 hypertension) underwent either 30 min of aerobic exercise at 50% VO2peak (CON) or IPC before exercise, in a counterbalanced order. IPC involved inflating cuffs on both thighs to 200 mmHg for 5 min, alternating between right and left thighs for three cycles, totaling 30 min. Brachial BP was measured during exercise and 1-h post-exercise recovery whereas muscle oxygen saturation (SmO2) from the rectus femoris was monitored using NIRs during exercise and recovery. Heart rate variability (HRV) and baroreflex sensitivity (BRS) together with a head-up tilt test (at 0 and 50°) were measured at the pre-test, post-test, and 24-h post-test. After the completion of each experiment, 24-h ambulatory blood pressure (ABP) was monitored to assess post-exercise hypotension within a 24-h window. RESULTS: BP and heart rate responses during exercise and 1-h recovery did not differ between conditions while SmO2 was significantly elevated during exercise in IPC (p = 0.004). There was no difference in HRV and supine BRS. However, significantly reduced titled BRS after exercise was found in CON while IPC preserved BRS similar to pre-exercise value, extending to 24-h post period (p = 0.047). ABP monitoring revealed a significant reduction in systolic BP during sleep in IPC compared to CON (p = 0.046). CONCLUSION: The present findings suggest that IPC with a single session of aerobic exercise results in a notable decrease in systolic ABP, particularly during sleep, compared to aerobic exercise alone. This supplementary antihypertensive effect was associated with a sustained BRS, persisting up to 24 h in contrast to the significant decrease observed in CON. Future studies are warranted to investigate long-term adaptations to IPC."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury (MI/RI) significantly impacts the patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI), with the NLRP3-mediated necrosis exacerbates the pathological progression of myocardial infarction. Exercise, recognized as a crucial approach for both disease prevention and treatment, is widely utilized in clinical practice worldwide and has demonstrated broad effectiveness in cardiovascular disease (CVD) prevention. PURPOSE: To explore the cardio protective effect of exercise preconditioning and the mechanism by which exercise modulation of NLRP3 improves myocardial ischemia and reperfusion injury. METHODS AND RESULTS: In this study, C57BL/6 N mice were employed to establish an exercise preconditioning model and a MI/RI model. The exercise intervention involved moderate-intensity aerobic exercise on a treadmill (50-70% VO2max) for small animals. Our research findings indicate that moderate-intensity aerobic exercise intervention improved cardiac function, reduced myocardial injury and inflammatory response, decreased myocardial infarction area and degree of cell apoptosis in mice compared to those raised under conventional conditions. Additionally, the expression of NLRP3 in the myocardial tissue of mice with MI/RI was reduced after exercise intervention. Moreover, exercise inhibited the activation of apoptosis related proteins such as Caspase-1 and GSDMD, while reducing the levels of inflammatory factors such as IL-1β and IL-18. CONCLUSIONS: This study found that moderate-intensity aerobic exercise can reduce the inflammatory response, reduce the degree of cell pyroptosis, reduce myocardial ischemia and reperfusion injury, and achieve endogenous protective effects on the myocardium.",

A systematic review (SR) of randomized controlled trials was conducted. This SR was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42021231231). Searches were conducted in five electronic databases (MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, Cochrane and SCOPUS). Studies were selected if they included adults over 18 years old with neck pain. The primary outcomes were pain intensity and physical function. A meta-analysis was conducted when applicable. Cochrane RoB Tool-2 was used to determine the risk of bias of included studies, and the certainty of the evidence was determined using the GRADE approach. Out of 4669 initial records screened, six studies published in 12 articles were included. AE was not statistically different compared to no-treatment or other interventions (e.g., localized exercise or acupuncture) on pain intensity measured with a visual analogue scale (VAS) (mean difference (MD) [95%CI]: 5.16 mm [-6.38, 16.70]). Contrarily, strengthening exercise was better than AE for pain intensity (MD [95%CI]: -11.34 mm [-21.6, -1.09]) after treatment. However, when AE was combined with other therapy (strengthening exercises or acupuncture), the combined therapy was better than isolated treatments (MD [95%CI]: 7.71 mm [1.07, 14.35]). A high heterogeneity was observed between protocols, comparisons, and results (magnitudes and directions). In conclusion, AE had positive results only when combined with other therapies to reduce pain intensity and disability in patients with neck pain. However, the evidence is limited, low-quality, and heterogeneous."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The hippocampal formation represents a key region in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. Aerobic exercise poses a promising add-on treatment to potentially counteract structural impairments of the hippocampal formation and associated symptomatic burden. However, current evidence regarding exercise effects on the hippocampal formation in schizophrenia is largely heterogeneous. Therefore, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the impact of aerobic exercise on total hippocampal formation volume. Additionally, we used data from a recent multicenter randomized-controlled trial to examine the effects of aerobic exercise on hippocampal formation subfield volumes and their respective clinical implications. METHODS: The meta-analysis comprised six studies that investigated the influence of aerobic exercise on total hippocampal formation volume compared to a control condition with a total of 186 people with schizophrenia (100 male, 86 female), while original data from 29 patients (20 male, 9 female) was considered to explore effects of six months of aerobic exercise on hippocampal formation subfield volumes. RESULTS: Our meta-analysis did not demonstrate a significant effect of aerobic exercise on total hippocampal formation volume in people with schizophrenia (g = 0.33 [-0.12 to 0.77]), p = 0.15), but our original data suggested significant volume increases in certain hippocampal subfields, namely the cornu ammonis and dentate gyrus. CONCLUSIONS: Driven by the necessity of better understanding the pathophysiology of schizophrenia, the present work underlines the importance to focus on hippocampal formation subfields and to characterize subgroups of patients that show neuroplastic responses to aerobic exercise accompanied by corresponding clinical improvements."
