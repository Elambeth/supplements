      "abstract": "Bell's palsy, a unilateral peripheral facial nerve palsy, is one of the most common acute mononeuropathies. Chronic cases persisting beyond one year present significant challenges to conventional treatment methods. Standard treatment includes steroids and antiviral medications in the acute phase, and physical therapy, various supplements such as vitamin B12 and folic acid supplementation, and injections for chronic therapy. This case report describes the effect of a unique treatment, dextrose-based Lyftogt perineural injection therapy (LPIT), in a 22-year-old Filipino male with left-sided peripheral facial nerve palsy. His condition had persisted for a duration of 13 months and was refractory to standard management. LPIT was delivered at chronic constriction points and endpoints of the facial nerve in ten different sessions. The mechanism of LPIT involves addressing glycopenia in affected nerves, reducing neurogenic inflammation, and facilitating nerve repair by enhancing the flow of nerve growth factors. Following treatment, marked improvement was observed in the functional muscle strength of the left occipitofrontalis, zygomaticus, and buccinator muscles, progressing from weak functional to functional. This case underscores LPIT's potential as an adjunct therapy for chronic Bell's palsy, adding to the limited but a growing body of evidence supporting its role in managing neuropathic conditions."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The objective was to determine whether oral non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) affect the efficacy of dextrose prolotherapy (DPT) in patients with knee osteoarthritis, and if the combination of these treatments is safe and well-tolerated. METHODS: Five patients with symptomatic knee osteoarthritis were included in this prospective case series. Participants underwent a series of three DPT injections at four-week intervals in their symptomatic knee(s) and were immediately prescribed a seven-day course of Ibuprofen after each injection. The main outcome measures included changes in the Knee Injury in Osteoarthritis (KOOS) questionnaire subscales (pain, symptoms, quality of life, sports and recreation function, and activities of daily living) and the Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS). RESULTS: There was a statistically significant improvement in the KOOS subscales of pain (P < 0.0001), Symptoms (P = 0.01), and Quality of Life (P = 0.001) after 12 weeks. The KOOS subscales for Sports and Recreation function (P = 0.06) and Activities of Daily Living (P = 0.10) showed numerical improvement over time that fell short of statistical significance. There was a statistically significant improvement in the NPRS scores compared with baseline NPRS scores after 12 weeks (P < 0.0001). In addition, NPRS scores were significantly lower at one-week follow-up after each DPT injection (P = 0.01); (P = 0.025); (P < 0.0001). There were no reported adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: Concomitant use of NSAIDS with dextrose prolotherapy injections is safe and well-tolerated with no adverse events and results in improvements in pain, symptoms, and overall quality of life associated with chronic knee OA. Controlled trials of this treatment are warranted."

      "abstract": "Wrist pain is common among athletes, particularly weightlifters, who perform repetitive high-intensity movements like the snatch and clean and jerk. Conventional treatments, including NSAIDs, corticosteroids, and physical therapy, often provide only symptomatic relief. This case report highlights effective management of acute wrist pain in a competitive weightlifter using Tendon Traction Point (TTP)-focused dextrose injections. A 23-year-old weightlifter presented with wrist pain persisting for two weeks despite prior treatments. Tenosynovitis of the extensor digitorum communis (EDC) and extensor carpi radialis brevis (ECRB) tendons was confirmed by ultrasound. After four injections of 5% dextrose into identified TTPs, the patient's Visual Analog Scale (VAS) score improved from 7 to 1. The treatment relieved pain and enabled the athlete to return to competition. This report demonstrates that TTP-focused dextrose injections offer a rapid, effective, and non-invasive solution for athletes with tendon overuse pain, presenting a promising alternative to traditional therapies and supporting functional recovery."

METHODS: This is a prospective QI study using the Model for Improvement and planned sequential experimentation through three Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) cycles: pathway creation, EMR implementation, and dose increase. Data were analyzed using Shewhart P-charts and chi-square tests. RESULTS: Our interventions increased the percentage of at-risk infants with hypoglycemia who received DG from 67% to 98%. Implementing three doses of DG caused a special cause variation, reducing neonatal hypoglycemia admissions from 3.7% to 2.0% and IV dextrose fluid rates from 2.7% to 1.7% (46% and 37% reduction, respectively). CONCLUSION: Three doses of dextrose gel administered to at-risk infants with neonatal hypoglycemia reduced the need for additional intervention, suggesting the dose-related efficacy of dextrose gel in mitigating the consequences of neonatal hypoglycemia."

      "abstract": "Background: With emerging antibiotic resistance, many patients on peritoneal dialysis require newer antibiotic treatment such as daptomycin. Inadequate clinical information exists across different peritoneal dialysis solutions, including icodextrin, for the stability of intraperitoneal daptomycin. To guide the clinical practice of intraperitoneal daptomycin treatment, we need to establish the stability of daptomycin at dextrose concentration higher than 1.5% and icodextrin, as well as the duration of stability. Methods: We tested the stability of daptomycin in three types of peritoneal dialysis bags (UltraBag dextrose 2.5%, UltraBag icodextrin 7.5%, and Stay-Safe Balance 2.3%). Daptomycin was reconstituted with water for injection (50 mg/mL), followed by administration to peritoneal dialysis bags to obtain the final daptomycin concentrations of 70 μg/mL (equivalent to 140 mg/2L, the maintenance level) and 245 μg/mL (equivalent to 490 mg/2L, the loading level). The bags were then placed at ambient temperature (25°C) followed by withdrawing 5 mL samples at 0, 4, 8, 12, 24, and 48 h for UltraBag dextrose 2.5% and UltraBag icodextrin 7.5% and 0, 4, 8, 12, and 24 h for Stay-Safe Balance 2.3%. The concentrations of daptomycin in the collected samples were quantified by high-performance liquid chromatography with diode array detector (HPLC-DAD). Results: Under ambient condition, daptomycin was stable at maintenance level in UltraBag dextrose 2.5% for 48 h and in UltraBag icodextrin 7.5% or Stay-Safe Balance 2.3% for 24 h. For loading level, daptomycin was stable in UltraBag dextrose 2.5% and Stay-Safe Balance 2.3% for 12 h and in UltraBag icodextrin 7.5% for 48 h. Conclusions: Current stability results support and guide the use of intraperitoneal daptomycin in different dialysis solutions. Patients with peritonitis requiring icodextrin exchange and assisted preparation of daptomycin can benefit from nurses who provide daily home visit based on our stability results."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Knee osteoarthritis (OA) is a debilitating condition that manifests as knee pain and dysfunction. Clinicians prefer non-surgical options such as intra-articular injections for mild to moderate disease. Dextrose prolotherapy (DPTx) has been shown to have a beneficial effect on knee OA in the long-term. In this randomized controlled trial (RCT), we aimed to compare DPTx with intra-articular normal saline injection (IA-NS) to treat knee OA in terms of effectiveness and patient-reported outcomes. METHODS: The study was a double-blind RCT with an allocation ratio of 1:1. We used block randomization to assign patients to each treatment arm. Patients with a visual analog scale of at least 4 for pain, and a Kellgren-Lawrence scale of grade 2 or 3 (mild or moderate disease) were selected and assessed according to eligibility criteria. The participants received either 5 ml of 50% dextrose water or 5 ml of 0.9% sodium chloride. The patients were followed up at 2, 4, and 8 weeks. SPSS software was used for statistical analyses. All results were reported with a confidence interval of 95%, and a p-value of less than 0.05 was considered significant. RESULTS: Overall, 55 patients were included in the study, but 50 completed the study process (25 patients in each treatment arm). The mean age of patients with knee OA was 62.98 ± 5.37, ranging from 55 to 74 years. We observed significant improvement in both groups in terms of knee pain, function, and knee extension degree at all follow-up visits (p < 0.001). Although DPTx was associated with better results than IA-NS, the difference was not statistically significant (p > 0.05). The adverse events were limited to injection-site pain and ecchymosis, which resolved by week 4. CONCLUSION: Although we achieved slightly better results with DPTx, this treatment technique was not clinically or statistically superior to IA-NS in terms of knee pain and function in the short-term. Therefore, both DPTx and IA-NS are effective and well tolerated treatment options for knee OA. However, more RCTs are needed to confirm these claims.",

      "abstract": "Background: Interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (IC/BPS) is a debilitating chronic condition affecting millions globally. Dextrose prolotherapy, a minimally invasive and safe treatment, has emerged as a potential way to promote tissue healing in these patients. This study investigates how dextrose prolotherapy impacts the urinary microbiome, aiming to uncover the underlying mechanisms involved in its effectiveness. Methods: Midstream urine samples from healthy controls and IC/BPS patients were collected before and after administering intravesical 10% dextrose injections. Microbiome profiling was conducted using 16S rRNA gene sequencing to analyze bacterial composition. Results: Significant differences in urinary microbiome diversity were observed between healthy controls and IC/BPS patients. Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, and Bacteroidota were more abundant in IC/BPS patients. Importantly, dextrose prolotherapy led to a decrease in harmful bacteria (Subgroup_22, Chryseolinea, and Ureaplasma) while enriching beneficial species such as Luteolibacter, Lactococcus, and L. lactis, correlating with improved clinical symptoms. Conclusions: Dextrose prolotherapy (DP) not only reduces the presence of harmful bacteria but also fosters the growth of beneficial microbes in IC/BPS patients. These findings suggest that the modulation of the urinary microbiome may be a key factor in its therapeutic success.",

      "abstract": "The condition known as colibacillosis is still very common in Indonesia, which means that laying hens affected by it are unable to achieve their peak egg production phase. Instead, their egg production is delayed and more susceptible to infection by other diseases. The goal of this study is to determine if the mixture of citric acid and dextrose can inhibit the growth of Avian Pathogenic Escherichia coli (APEC) bacteria in laying hens, ultimately leading to the control of colibacillosis cases in Indonesia. A total of 240 laying hen heads in all were split up into 6 treatments, each with 40 replications.The group received the following treatments: T0 is a treatment for laying hens free of APEC infection and they are given no drink that contains any mixture of citric acid and dextrose. T0 (-) is a treatment for laying hens free of APEC infection but a drink mixture of citric acid and dextrose is administered at a dose of 1 g/2.5 L of drinking water. T0 (+) is a treatment for laying hens infected with APEC up to 2 mL/head orally (3 × 108 CFU/mL) and given a drink without the mixture of citric acid and dextrose. T1 is a treatment for laying hens infected with APEC up 2 mL/head orally (3 × 108 CFU/mL) and given a mixture of citric acid and dextrose at a dose of 1 g/1.25 L of drinking water. T2 is a treatment for laying hens infected with APEC up to 2 mL/head orally (3 × 108 CFU/mL) and given a mixture of citric acid and dextrose at a dose of 1 g/2.5 L of drinking water. T3 is a treatment for laying hens infected with APEC up to 2 mL/head orally (3 × 108 CFU/mL) and given a mixture of citric acid and dextrose at a dose of 1 g/3.75 L of drinking water. The results of this study stated that the mixture of citric acid and dextrose showed a significant decrease in the appearance of the intestinal villi of laying hens, because the results were actually less good compared to the treatment infected with APEC. It is suspected that the dose given may still be excessive in concentration. This can be seen from the dose with the highest concentration range (T1) to the lowest (T3) which showed an image of intestinal villi that had a tendency to improve. Therefore, further research and studies are needed regarding the use of a mixture of citric acid and dextrose in laying hens infected with APEC with a lower dose."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND AIMS: In children undergoing surgery, the stress responses of surgery can result in blood glucose elevation consequent to release of cortisol and catecholamines. The use of a regional block could attenuate the stress responses and lower the blood glucose levels. We compared the blood glucose values at specified time points during surgery with and without additional dextrose to evaluate the need for glucose supplementation as our primary outcome. Intraoperative hemodynamics and the need for any intervention for correction of blood sugars were noted secondarily. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Children aged between 6 months and 8 years undergoing elective major surgery were randomized to group D (received 1% dextrose in Ringer's lactate) or group P (received only Ringer's lactate). Blood sugars were measured half hourly for 2 h following intubation, and data was analyzed using Student's t-test and Chi-square test. RESULTS: Demographic variables and the duration of surgery were comparable. The baseline blood glucose value was lower in group D. Analysis of covariates test for a comparison of adjusted mean blood glucose (MBG) showed the values at 30, 60, and 90 min to be comparable. However, toward the end of surgery, the MBG value was significantly higher in group D (P = 0.019). Heart rate and mean arterial pressure were comparable at the same points of measurement. CONCLUSION: Dextrose supplementation is not needed for children receiving caudal analgesia for major surgeries of 2-3 h duration and may raise blood sugars at the end of surgery."

      "abstract": "Background/Objective: Little information is available on the stability and quality controls of compounded 40% dextrose gel required to ensure its safe use in the treatment and prevention of neonatal hypoglycemia. Whether its efficacy relies on buccal absorption also remains uncertain. This study investigates the stability, microbiological safety, rheological properties and dextrose diffusion of a compounded 40% oral dextrose gel, ensuring it can be widely compounded and stored for clinical use. Methods: A 40% dextrose gel compounded with anhydrous dextrose, carboxymethylcellulose, citric acid, sorbic acid and sterile water was subjected to quality control measures including a dextrose content assay, degradation product analysis, microbiological testing and preservative efficacy. Stability studies were conducted at refrigerated (4-8 °C) and ambient temperatures for 7 days and 3 months, respectively. Rheological properties were assessed, and dextrose permeation was measured through an artificial membrane model that mimics a biological membrane. Results: The compounded gel demonstrated stability for up to 7 days at ambient temperature and 90 days when refrigerated. The dextrose content remained within the acceptable range (90-110%) and microbiological tests confirmed compliance with safety standards. The gel exhibited the consistent rheological properties and shear-thinning behavior appropriate for oral mucosal administration. In vitro permeation studies showed no evidence of dextrose diffusion with a long lag time followed by a low steady-state permeation flux. Conclusions: This study validates the compounding process of a stable 40% oral dextrose gel formulation for neonatal hypoglycemia management, which meets quality control criteria and can be safely administered in clinical practice, offering a cost-effective and safe alternative for neonatal care."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: D-glucose (dextrose) is used as a 5000-25,000 mg% solution in the injection-based pain therapy known as dextrose prolotherapy (DPT). The number of peer-reviewed clinical trials supporting its use is growing. However, the mechanism of action is unknown, limiting further research. A commonly expressed theory is that hyperosmotic dextrose injection induces inflammation, initiating a healing-specific inflammatory cascade. In vitro study models have used continuous exposure to high concentration dextrose. But the rate of dextrose clearance after intra-articular injection, and, therefore, the duration of exposure of tissues to any particular dextrose concentration, remains unknown. We therefore determined the rate of dextrose concentration diminution in one human participant's knees after intra-articular dextrose knee injection. METHOD: In this pre-post N-of-1 study, the first author (KDR), a well 70-year-old male without knee-related pathology, injected his own knees with 30 mL of 12,500 mg% dextrose on three occasions; performed serial aspirations of 1.2 mL of intra-articular fluid from 7 to 360 min post-injection; and assessed synovial dextrose concentration. Dextrose clearance kinetics were determined using Minitab and GraphPad Prism software. RESULTS: Dextrose concentration dropped rapidly in all three trials, approximating an exponential or steep S curve. A third order chemical reaction pattern was found, suggesting factors other than dilution or glucose transporter activity, such as rapid diffusion of dextrose across the synovial membrane, may have contributed to the rapid drop in dextrose concentration. CONCLUSION: This pre-post N-of-1 study shows that, after intraarticular injection of 30 mL of 12,500 mg% dextrose injection into a well knee, the concentration of dextrose diminished rapidly, suggesting that intra-articular cells, tissue, and anatomic structures are exposed to an initially high dextrose concentration for a very short time. This likely affects the mechanism of action of DPT and should inform in vitro study methods."

While the dog was under general anesthesia, a blood glucose concentration of 3.8 mmol L-1 (70 mg dL-1) was noted. The anesthesia technician was instructed to give 0.5 mL kg-1 of 50% dextrose intravenously (IV) diluted 1:1 with saline as a slow bolus, but instead administered 5 mL kg -1 of 50% dextrose IV. This resulted in a blood glucose concentration exceeding 41.7 mmol/L (750 mg dL-1; upper threshold of glucometer). The supervising anesthetist and ophthalmologist were notified and treatment provided with 0.13 U kg-1 of regular insulin IV and a fluid bolus of Lactated Ringer's solution (5 mL kg-1 over 10 minutes). At the end of the procedure, a cardiac arrhythmia was noted, with audible arterial pulse deficits appreciated on the ultrasound Doppler unit. Repeat blood sample analysis showed hyperkalemia of 6.8 mmol L-1 and blood glucose concentration greater than 27.7 mmol L-1 (500 mg dL-1, upper limit of biochemistry panel). Electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring confirmed an underlying sinus rhythm with atrial bigeminy, which normalized upon improvement of hyperkalemia. The case was reviewed by team members and an incident report was submitted. Iatrogenic dextrose overdose can cause transient hyperkalemia due to intracellular potassium shifting to the extracellular compartment."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Heel pain is prevalent in foot and ankle practice, with plantar fasciitis being a common cause of chronic heel pain in adults. It is a degenerative condition of the plantar fascia, rendering the term fasciitis inaccurate. The condition has several alternative names, including painful heel syndrome and heel spur syndrome. It is found that a significant number of people suffer from plantar fasciitis at some stage of their lives; athletes and women between 40 and 60 years and adults aged more than 65 suffer the most. Patients typically report tenderness at the medial aspect of the heel, and pain is mostly under the surface of the heel, especially with initial morning steps. Plantar fasciitis is predominantly unilateral. Treatment options include prolotherapy and platelet-rich plasma (PRP), with this randomized controlled trial (RCT) aiming to evaluate the efficacy of PRP versus 25% dextrose prolotherapy in alleviating plantar fasciitis symptoms. AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to assess the comparative effectiveness of USG-guided 25% dextrose prolotherapy and autologous PRP injections on pain intensity, foot function, and ankle outcomes in plantar fasciitis cases. METHODOLOGY: The study took place at the Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (PMR), King George's Medical University (KGMU), Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh, India, with eligible patients evaluated. Group A received 25% dextrose prolotherapy, while Group B was administered autologous platelet-rich plasma. Outcome measures, including pain by Pain Intensity Scale (PIS) and assessment of disability by Foot Function Index (FFI) and Foot and Ankle Outcome Score (FAOS), were assessed at baseline and the third and sixth weeks after intervention. RESULTS: A total of 44 patients were randomized into two groups of 22. Group A received dextrose prolotherapy, while Group B was treated with PRP injections as per the study protocol. The average age of participants in our study was 36.10±10.0 years. Female participants were more affected than male participants in both groups. Overall, the male-female ratio was 38.6:61.4, while in Group A and Group B, this ratio was 45.5:54.5 and 31.8:68.2, respectively. The presentation of plantar fasciitis was bilateral (40.9%), on the right side (40.9%), and on the left side (18.2%). The right side was more frequently involved than the left side of the plantar fascia. There was a decrease in the average PIS score of Groups A and B at the baseline, which was 7.27±1.24 and 7.55±1.26, respectively, which was reduced to 3.18±1.30 and 2.50±0.67 after six weeks of follow-up. The average FFI score of Groups A and B at the baseline was 98.64±17.68 and 95.36±19.01, respectively, which was reduced to 79.77±12.77 and 63.77±18.50 after six weeks of follow-up. The average FAOS score of Groups A and B at the baseline was 71.36±13.95 and 74.86±28.72, respectively, which was reduced to 74.86±28.72 and 42.09±5.03 after six weeks of follow-up. CONCLUSION: Both 25% dextrose prolotherapy and PRP injections are effective treatments for plantar fasciitis. Both are minimally invasive and safe treatments for plantar fasciitis."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Lateral epicondylitis is caused by overuse and manifests as pain, weakness, and difficulty with object manipulation. Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) and dextrose injections have shown promise in reducing pain and improving function. HYPOTHESIS: PRP is more effective for force precision control of the extensor carpi radialis brevis (ECRB) muscle than dextrose injection for patients with chronic lateral epicondylitis (CLE). STUDY DESIGN: Randomized, double-blinded clinical trial. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level 1. METHODS: A total of 62 participants (25 healthy subjects and 37 CLE patients) were assigned randomly to either PRP (19) or dextrose (18) groups. Assessments included maximal voluntary contraction (MVC), wrist extension force, questionnaires, sonography, and electromyography assessments. RESULTS: PRP and dextrose had similar effects on clinical questionnaire scores. Compared with pre-test values, only PRP demonstrated a significant increase in MVC (PRP, 75.3 ± 107.7%; P < 0.01; dextrose, 34.0 ± 66.1%; P = 0.08), and greater reduction in force fluctuations (PRP, -27.4 ± 13.3%; P < 0.01; dextrose, -5.4 ± 33.2%; P = 0.22) during post-test wrist extension. After treatment, the PRP group experienced a roughly 41.7% increase in motor units (MUs) with recruitment thresholds (Rec_TH) (pre-test, 3.67 ± 6.15% MVC; post-test, 5.20 ± 8.02% MVC; P < 0.01). The dextrose group showed no significant change (-3.74%) in MU Rec_THs (pre-test, 3.48 ± 6.80% MVC; post-test, 3.35 ± 6.62% MVC; P = 0.75). PRP increased the MU discharge rate with Rec_THs at <30% MVC, whereas dextrose administration elevated MU discharge rate with Rec_THs >20% MVC. CONCLUSION: PRP may be more effective than dextrose in improving neuromuscular control of the ECRB muscle, particularly for enhancing the scaling of force during wrist extension, attributed to distinct MU activation strategies. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Detailed comparison and head-to-head analysis of PRP and dextrose injections offers more options for patients considering injections."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Entrapment neuropathies, marked by nerve compression at various anatomical sites, can be effectively managed using conservative approaches like injections. Dextrose 5 % water injection has emerged as a potential therapy by reducing inflammation and promoting tissue regeneration. We aimed to evaluate dextrose injection's efficacy in treating entrapment neuropathies in upper extremities. METHOD: We systematically searched EMBASE, Scopus, Web of Science, and PubMed. Our eligibility criteria included participants aged 18 and older who had peripheral upper limb nerve entrapment from non-metabolic and non-traumatic sources. These participants were treated with dextrose injection compared to those receiving other injectables, such as corticosteroids and non-corticosteroid medications. The primary outcome was pain, with secondary outcomes including function, ultrasonographic, and electrodiagnostic findings. The quality of the clinical trials was assessed using Cochrane tools. Random-effect model was employed for meta-analysis. RESULTS: Thirteen studies, involving 754 patients, were included, with only two showing serious bias risk. Initial findings indicate significant pain relief with dextrose injection within a short time (≤4 weeks) compared to normal saline (MD: -1.30, 95%CI: -2.12; -0.47). Dextrose also demonstrated a significant pain decrease compared to corticosteroids (MD: -0.81, 95 % CI: -1.40; -0.21) with low heterogeneity (I2 = 9 %, P = 0.36), and significantly improved function (MD = -0.46, 95 % CI: -0.76; -0.16) with low heterogeneity (I2 = 17 %, P = 0.31) in mid-term (one to six months). CONCLUSION: This meta-analysis suggests dextrose injection as an effective therapy for managing pain and restoring function in entrapment neuropathies. However, further high-quality studies are needed to confirm these findings and establish optimal dosing regimens and injection protocols. Healthcare providers should consider integrating dextrose injection into their treatment strategies for patients with entrapment neuropathies."

      "abstract": "RATIONALE & OBJECTIVE: Peritoneal dialysis (PD) solutions provide both clearance of uremic toxins and sodium and water. An intraperitoneal (IP) solution of icodextrin and glucose designed without the requirement for uremic toxin clearance could provide substantially greater sodium and water removal than PD solutions. STUDY DESIGN: We examined varying concentrations of icodextrin and dextrose IP solutions in rats. We evaluated a 30% icodextrin and 10% dextrose IP solution in animals and humans. PARTICIPANTS: Small and large animal models, and humans (N = 10) with kidney failure. EXPOSURE: 30% icodextrin and 10% dextrose IP solution. OUTCOMES: We evaluated ultrafiltration (UF), sodium removal, and peritoneal health in animals. We evaluated safety, tolerability, and efficacy in humans. RESULTS: In rats, increasing concentrations of icodextrin and dextrose IP solutions, up to 30% icodextrin and 10% dextrose, produced progressively greater UF (P < 0.001). In sheep treated with 30% icodextrin and 10% dextrose, the mean UF was ∼3.5-fold greater (1.77 ± 0.22 L vs 0.47 ± 0.34 L; P = 0.005) and the mean sodium removal was ∼4-fold greater (7.07 ± 0.72 g vs 1.78 ± 1.27 g; P = 0.003) compared with commercially available 7.5% icodextrin PD solution. Long-term exposure of mice (30 days) and sheep (30-45 days) to a 30% icodextrin and 10% dextrose IP solution resulted in no significant structural tissue changes compared with the control 4.25% commercially available PD solution. In humans, a 24-hour dwell of a 30% icodextrin and 10% dextrose IP solution resulted in median net UF of 2,498 mL (IQR, 2,249-2,768), and median sodium removal of 387 mmol (IQR, 372-434 mmol). No serious adverse events occurred. LIMITATIONS: The long-term safety with chronic therapy and the efficacy in patients without kidney failure were not established and require future studies. CONCLUSIONS: A 30% icodextrin and 10% dextrose IP solution provides more efficient UF and sodium removal than traditional PD solutions. The promising inhuman safety and efficacy results warrant future investigation as a sodium removal therapy in patients with edematous disorders such as heart failure. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT05780086. SUMMARY: We aimed to design a novel intraperitoneal solution designed for optimal sodium and water removal. A sodium-free 30% icodextrin and 10% dextrose intraperitoneal solution was evaluated in animal models and humans to determine the safety and efficacy. A 30% icodextrin and 10% dextrose solution provides more efficient sodium and water removal than traditional peritoneal dialysis solutions. The promising inhuman safety and efficacy results warrant future investigation as a sodium removal therapy in patients with edematous disorders such as heart failure."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Clinical metritis (CM) has significant costs to dairy producers. Current treatment strategy involves systemic antibiotics; however, there is increasing concern about judicious antibiotic use. The study objective was to evaluate the effects of a non-antibiotic treatment vs. systemic antibiotic therapy on the vaginal discharge microbiome of dairy cows diagnosed with CM at 7 ± 3 DIM (days in milk). We hypothesize that both treatment methods will have a similar impact on the reproductive microbiome due to broad-spectrum bactericidal activity; therefore, there will not be significant differences amongst the microbiota after the completion of therapy. METHODS: Cows from a central Pennsylvania dairy were screened for CM at 7 ± 3 days DIM using a Metricheck™ device (n = 351). Cows with red-brown watery discharge were diagnosed with CM and eligible for enrollment. Eligible cows (n = 77) were blocked by parity and randomly allocated to one of two treatments starting on the day of diagnosis: (1) Intrauterine dextrose (DEX, n = 38): 1 l of an intrauterine 50% dextrose solution for 3 days, and (2) Systemic ceftiofur (CONV, n = 39): two injections of ceftiofur (6.6 mg/Kg of BW; Excede, Zoetis Inc.) 72 h apart. Cows were evaluated for clinical cure rate at 7 ± 3 and 14 ± 3 days post-diagnosis. Vaginal discharge samples were collected using the Metricheck™ at enrollment day [study day (sd) 0, pre-treatment], sd 7, and sd 14 for a subset of enrolled cows (DEX = 13, CONV = 14). Vaginal discharge samples were analyzed with 16S rRNA sequencing to evaluate changes in the microbiome between treatments. RESULTS: After treatment, there were only minor differences within the microbiome between the two treatments indicating the potential suitability of dextrose as an antibiotic-alternative treatment. Alpha diversity did not differ (Welch's t-test) between the treatments at any of the time points. Beta diversity based on PERMANOVA analysis did differ between treatments at sd 0 (P = 0.014) and again at sd 14 (P = 0.028), but not at sd 7 (P = 0.261). DISCUSSION: While 16S rRNA analysis does not provide information on bacterial viability, the relative similarity of the microbiome between the two groups immediately following treatment might suggest that intrauterine dextrose could be utilized as an alternative treatment for CM."

METHODS: A systematic search was carried out in scientific databases including Web of Science, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, PUBMED and other sources, up until March 2024. We included clinical studies that used subcutaneous injections of dextrose in the treatment of individuals with musculoskeletal pain associated with tendinopathies, enthesopathy, osteoarthritis, ligament sprains, muscle strains or bursitis of various locations. RESULTS: Twenty studies that met the criteria were included in this review; of those, 13 were randomized clinical trials, one non-randomized comparative study and six were case series studies, comprising a total of 1226 patients. In all included studies, efficacy in pain reduction was reported in the groups treated with dextrose when comparing evaluations at baseline, short term and medium term. CONCLUSIONS: Subcutaneous injections of dextrose could be a beneficial treatment for reducing musculoskeletal pain; however, factors such as the high heterogeneity in the treatment schemes, uncertainty in the mechanisms of action and the level of evidence found, indicate that this technique is still under development.",

The Visual Analog Scale (VAS), Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC) and Oxford Knee Scale (OKS) questionnaires were filled at baseline, and four and eight weeks after first injection. RESULTS: At four and eight weeks, the VAS, OKS, and WOMAC scores improved from baseline in both groups. There was no significant difference in the WOMAC and OKS scores between two methods. The VAS scores showed superiority of intra-articular method (p<0.05). CONCLUSION: Both peri-articular and intra-articular DPT were effective in patients with KOA. There was no superiority in terms of functional improvement between two groups. However, intra-articular prolotherapy was more effective in decreasing pain in these patients."

The patients received one session of ultrasound-guided perineural injection therapy of 10 mL D5W or a corticosteroid solution (1 mL compound betamethasone [1 mL: betamethasone sodium phosphate 5 mg and betamethasone dipropionate 2 mg] mixed with 5 mL 2% lidocaine and 4 mL 0.9% saline).The primary outcomes were Visual Analog Scale (VAS) scores for MP (pain and paresthesia) and global quality of life. The secondary outcomes included self-reported successful clinical response and injection adverse effects. Evaluations were conducted at pretreatment and at one, 3, 4 and 6 months posttreatment. RESULTS: All patients completed the study. Compared with baseline, both groups exhibited reductions in VAS scores for MP and global quality of life at all follow-up time points, with statistical differences at 3, 4, and 6 months in the D5W group (P < 0.05), as well as those at one, 3, and 4 months in the steroid group (P < 0.05). The D5W group exhibited greater improvement than the steroid group in VAS scores for MP and global quality of life at 4 and 6 months (P < 0.05), and demostrated a more successful clinical response at 6 months (P < 0.05). No adverse effects were reported in the D5W group during the study period, while 6 patients in the steroid group reported an adverse effect. LIMITATIONS: A longer follow-up period is necessary; the exact mechanism of D5W is not clear. CONCLUSIONS: Ultrasound-guided perineural injection therapy of D5W is more beneficial than corticosteroid injection for MP at 4 to 6 months posttreatment. Additionally, D5W displays a better safety profile than corticosteroid. Thus, we suggest D5W as a more suitable injectate for patients with MP.",

If not recognized and managed, it can increase morbidity and mortality. This study aimed to estimate the incidence of hypoglycemia in hyperkalemic patients treated with 10 units of intravenous insulin, 50 ml of 50% dextrose, 10 ml of 10% calcium gluconate, and salbutamol nebulization. Additionally, the timing of hypoglycemia onset and its associated factors were studied. METHODS: This prospective observational study included hyperkalemic patients (serum potassium >5.5 mmol/L) who visited the emergency department between January 26, 2020, and August 26, 2021. The primary outcome was hypoglycemia (blood glucose <70 mg/dl) within 3 hours of receiving the standard treatment. Glucose levels were measured hourly for 3 hours. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression identified factors associated with hypoglycemia. RESULTS: Of 100 patients, 69% were male, and the median age was 46 years (IQR, 30-60 years). Hypoglycemia occurred in 44%, and 10% developed severe hypoglycemia (blood glucose <54 mg/dl). The median time for hypoglycemia onset was 2 hours (IQR, 1-2 hours). Low pretreatment blood glucose (<100 mg/dl) was significantly associated with hypoglycemia, according to both univariate and multivariate analyses. CONCLUSIONS: The study found a higher incidence of hypoglycemia in hyperkalemia treatment than reported in retrospective studies, suggesting the need for standardized management protocols with integrated glucose monitoring."

This study aimed to determine whether buccal dextrose gel in the delivery room (DR) would improve rates of early hypoglycaemia in this population. DESIGN: Randomised, blinded, placebo-controlled trial. SETTING: Four level-3 and one level-2 neonatal units. PATIENTS: Inborn infants≤32+0 weeks gestational age (GA). INTERVENTIONS: Infants were randomised to 40% dextrose or placebo gel in the DR (≤29+0 GA: 0.5 mL gel, ≥29+1 GA: 1 mL gel). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Hypoglycaemia (<1.8 mmol/L) measured at the time of first intravenous access at NICU admission. RESULTS: Between November 2020 and August 2022, the recruitment rate was slow (impacted by the requirement for antenatal consent). This fact, coupled with finite research resources, led to a decision to end recruitment early. Data analysis of 169 newborns (33% of target sample size) showed no significant difference in the frequency of the primary outcome between dextrose 24/84 (29%) and placebo 25/85 (29%) groups (OR 0.95; 95% CI 0.49 to 1.86; p=0.88). A post-hoc analysis indicated that the trial had a low (47% conditional power) chance of detecting a statistically significant benefit from the intervention (had the target sample been achieved). CONCLUSIONS: This study showed no evidence of benefit of 40% dextrose gel on rates of hypoglycaemia at NICU admission. Management of these vulnerable newborns should continue to focus on vascular access and commencement of dextrose-containing intravenous fluids as early as possible.

The effectiveness of dextrose prolotherapy is not fully known. This study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of dextrose prolotherapy in distal SM tendinopathy and to compare it with the effectiveness of steroid injections. METHODOLOGY:  The study included 12 patients who received ultrasound-guided steroid injections and 13 patients who received dextrose prolotherapy treatment with the diagnosis of distal SM tendinopathy. The patient's visual analog scale (VAS) and International Knee Documentation Committee Subjective Knee Assessment (IKDC) scores were analyzed before the procedure, as well as one week and four weeks afterward. RESULTS:  Pre-procedure VAS scores were similar in the dextrose and steroid groups (4.00 ± 0.70, 4.33 ± 0.88 P = 0.308), while they were significantly lower in the steroid group at week 1 (1.84 ± 0.55, 1.16 ± 0.93, P = 0.036). Fourth-week VAS scores were significantly lower in the dextrose group (0.61 ± 0.65, 1.33 ± 0.65, P = 0.011). IKDC scores were similar in the dextrose and steroid groups before the procedure (48.34 ± 6.01, 46.66 ± 3.34, P = 0.402). In the first week, it was observed to be similar in the dextrose and steroid groups (55.03 ± 8.52, 53.30 ± 1.56, P = 0.496) and higher in the dextrose group in the fourth week (62.50 ± 14.46, 53.13 ± 1.60, P = 0.036). CONCLUSIONS: It was observed that both dextrose prolotherapy and steroid injections were effective in reducing pain and improving functionality in the treatment of distal SM tendinopathy. Steroid injections showed better results in the first week, while dextrose prolotherapy yielded better outcomes by the fourth week."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Dextrose prolotherapy is one of the most promising minimally invasive interventions for temporomandibular disorder (TMD), particularly in refractory cases where other conservative treatments have failed. The purpose of this study was to demonstrate the efficacy of a new treatment, temporomandibular joint (TMJ) prolotherapy, in patients with TMD to alleviate symptoms. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted on TMD patients with chronic pain who did not respond to conventional treatments. TMJ prolotherapy was performed using hypertonic dextrose in the TMJ area, targeting the retrodiscal attachment tissue, anterior disc attachment tissue, lateral capsule, origin of the masseter muscle, and the stylomandibular ligament. Pain or discomfort intensity in the TMJ was evaluated using a numerical rating scale (NRS). Maximum mouth opening and subjective satisfaction were also analyzed. RESULTS: Nineteen patients (6 males, 13 females, average age 43 years) participated in this study. All patients experienced pain improvement with a maximum of three prolotherapy sessions. The initial mean NRS was 5.7, which ultimately decreased to a final mean TMJ discomfort score of 1.7 postintervention. The patients' maximum mouth opening increased from an initial 34.5 mm to 38.8 mm, and they reported positive satisfaction with the prolotherapy treatment. The clinical outcomes were positive regardless of main origin of TMD symptoms. CONCLUSION: Hypertonic TMJ prolotherapy is an effective minimally invasive intervention for TMJ disorders with chronic pain."

Maximal mouth opening (MMO), pain, and frequency of dislocations were analyzed. RESULTS: Eight RCTs were included. In comparison with placebo, dextrose prolotherapy was associated with significantly reduced pain and MMO. Comparison of dextrose with ABI revealed no significant difference in MMO. Qualitative analysis showed no significant difference in outcomes in patients who received dextrose prolotherapy and BTX. CONCLUSIONS: Low-quality evidence suggests that dextrose prolotherapy may reduce MMO and improve pain scores compared to placebo in patients with TMJ hypermobility. Low-quality evidence also suggests that there may be minimal difference in outcomes between dextrose vs ABI and BTX."

Patients were evaluated with visual analog scale (VAS) and Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ) scores before and after the procedure at week 1 Results: While VAS and RMDQ scores were similar in both groups before the procedure, VAS and RMDQ scores at week 1 were significantly lower in the dextrose group. CONCLUSION: Perineural dextrose injection appears to be a safe and effective alternative to steroid injections in the treatment of SCS neuropathy."

We present a case of grade IV KOA with co-morbid obesity who refused surgical management but got dextrose prolotherapy instead.

Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis (WOMAC score), Numerical Rating Scale (NRS), knee ROM, Barthel index, count test, and Timed Up and Go Test (TUG) were evaluated 1 day after each treatment and compared to each post-injection score. This patient is also comorbid of grade II obesity which is associated with mechanical loads on the knee joint causing inflammation and progression of KOA. After 5 months of prolotherapy treatment, strengthened quadricep muscle exercising and static cycle endurance exercising, she improved her pain, WOMAC score, and cardiorespiratory function.

It not only causes pain and physical limitations but also impacts mental health, sleep, work participation, and even mortality. Peri-articular dextrose prolotherapy has been shown to reduce knee osteoarthritis pain; however, the effect of injection sites on its effectiveness is not clear. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to investigate the effect of injection points on pain intensity, joint stiffness, and physical activity in patients with knee osteoarthritis who underwent peri-articular dextrose prolotherapy. METHODS: This double-blind clinical trial involved 26 patients with grade 2 and 3 bilateral knee osteoarthritis. Three times every one week, dextrose and lidocaine were injected as interventions. Injection sites were positioned within acupuncture points on one knee, but were relocated by 1.5 centimeters to the medial side of the same acupuncture points on the other knee. Pain intensity, joint stiffness, and physical activity were evaluated using the Visual Analog Pain Scale (VAS) and the Persian version of the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) before the intervention and at each follow-up visit at 1 and 2 months post-injection. RESULTS: Pain intensity score, joint stiffness, physical performance, and WOMAC were significantly decreased one and two months after the intervention in both groups (P = 0.0001). The improvement in the patients of both groups was similar, and the two study groups did not have a statistically significant difference in terms of study outcomes (P = 0.37). CONCLUSIONS: Prolotherapy with dextrose is an effective treatment for knee osteoarthritis."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Occlusal trauma has become a common phenomenon among individuals today. Its primary source is bruxism, which involves unusual activities such as clenching and grinding during the day or sleep. The hypothesis is that with 5% dextrose neuroprolotherapy, both the trigger points and affected nerves will be healed, and the muscle will be relieved by eliminating the pain. METHODS: This study aimed to compare the short-term ultrasonographic results of patients treated with occlusal splint and 5% dextrose neuroprolotherapy for bruxism. Patients were divided into two groups: the dextrose neuroprolotherapy group and the occlusal splint group. In the first group, patients were administered 5% dextrose three times at one-week intervals using the dextrose neuroprolotherapy method. Impressions for both jaws were made using a high-viscosity irreversible hydrocolloid impression material in the second group. An occlusal splint was tailored to fit the upper jaw. Patients were assessed for masseter muscle thickness and strain ratio using ultrasonography before and 3 months after the treatment. RESULTS: No statistically significant differences were found between the two groups for all measures. Statistically significant differences were observed in the strain ratio of the left musculus massetericus in the resting position and the thickness of the left musculus massetericus in the contracted position exclusively in the neuroprolotherapy group (p=0.001, p=0.011, respectively). Differences in the strain ratio of both sides of the contracted musculus massetericus were demonstrated in both groups (neuroprolotherapy group: right side p<0.001, left side p=0.007, splint group: right side p=0.005, left side p=0.012). CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that 5% dextrose neuroprolotherapy is an effective treatment comparable to an occlusal splint. Objectively visualizing changes in the masseter muscle through ultrasound provides clear results in the context of occlusal trauma and bruxism.",

Thirty patients aged between 18 and 62 years, diagnosed with Temporomandibular Disorders (TMDs) persisting for more than six months and unresponsive to other conservative treatments, were enrolled in the study. Over four subsequent visits, spaced six weeks apart, each patient received injections of 3 ml of 10% dextrose solution into the temporomandibular joint space. Parameters assessed included pain levels, frequency of luxations/dislocations, episodes of locking per month, maximal mouth opening, and clicking, evaluated every six weeks for a duration of three months. All patients exhibited improvements in Temporomandibular Disorders (TMDs), manifested as reduced pain, clicking sounds, locking episodes, and increased maximal mouth opening, following prolotherapy treatment. These improvements were found to be statistically significant (p-value < 0.05). Dextrose prolotherapy is a treatment method with broad applications and should be considered prior to resorting to long-term pharmacotherapy or surgical interventions. The use of 10% dextrose prolotherapy presents a promising treatment modality for temporomandibular joint disorders, as evidenced by its therapeutic benefits."

STUDY DESIGN: We retrospectively compared newborn infants at risk for hypoglycemia born during the intervention period (n = 3775) with historical controls (n = 655). We also compared the rates of the primary outcome (NICU admission) and secondary outcomes (exclusive breastfeeding and hospital costs) between the two periods. RESULTS: Following the implementation of ODG supplementation, the NICU admissions rates dropped from 4% to 2%, p < 0.05, for at-risk infants and from 15% to 7%, p < 0.05, for hypoglycemic infants in the baseline and intervention periods, respectively, with an adjusted OR (95% CI) of 0.39 (0.24-0.64), p < 0.001. Additionally, the ODG protocol sustained rates of exclusive breastfeeding in contrast to the institutional protocol. CONCLUSION: The adoption of an ODG protocol fosters a more nurturing and baby-friendly environment through reduced NICU transfers, support for exclusive breastfeeding, and decreased hospital costs."

Instead, a multimodal approach including an intra-articular (IA) injection of a combination of various agents was applied successfully. The pharmacological treatment resulted in minimal improvement. After experiencing failure with IA hyaluronic acid and platelet-rich plasma injections, an IA combination of fentanyl 50 mcg, dexamethasone 8 mg, clonidine 150 mcg, ropivacaine 7.5% 5 ml, dextrose 30% 5 ml, and normal saline 5 ml was applied. The treatment led to a two-year pain relief. The multimodal approach seems to offer satisfactory and encouraging results as the improvement in the quality of life led to favorable physical and psychological outcomes in the patient."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: to compare the combined effect of Prolotherapy and Deep Dry Needling (DDN) versus DDN effect on relieving the symptoms of Temporomandibular joint (TMJ) anterior disc displacement. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The clinical trial randomly allocated forty patients. The (control group) patients received four intraarticular and masseteric DDN sessions, while the (study group) patients were subjected to the exact technique followed by Prolosolution injection. The baseline preoperative measurements included Maximal interincisal opening (MIO), auscultation of the presence of clicking, and Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), which were repeated for postoperative measurements after one, two, five, and eight months. RESULTS: By the end of the study, all patients expressed apparent improvement in pain MIO and clicking. The inter- and intragroup comparison revealed that the pain score values of the control group after five and eight months were significantly higher than those of the study group. The study group demonstrated more significant MIO calibration than the control group, with insignificant differences between both groups regarding the presence of clicking at any time interval. The associations between clicking and VAS values, between clicking and MIO, and between VAS values and increased MIO were positive in the test group and negative in the control group. CONCLUSIONS: Dextrose Prolotherapy and DDN were beneficial. However, Prolotherapy demonstrated more significant, sustained, and correlated long-term alleviation of symptoms and increased MIO. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The study assesses the sole effect of dextrose prolotherapy on relieving the signs of TMJ anterior disc displacement apart from the impact of the penetrating needle.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Current protocols which include the administration of a single dextrose dose concomitantly with insulin are inadequate as hypoglycemia commonly occurs 60 min after insulin administration and may persist for up to two hours post-insulin administration. To prevent delayed hypoglycemic events, our institution revised our adult acute hyperkalemia order set to include hypoglycemic preventative measures not currently described in the literature. METHODS: The primary purpose of this retrospective study was to determine if the new adult acute hyperkalemia order set resulted in lower rates of hypoglycemia (glucose <70 mg/dL) compared to the old order set in patients with impaired renal clearance and lower pre-insulin glucose values. In addition to reducing the IV regular insulin dose from 10 to 5 units, the new order set recommends patients receive a 250 mL dextrose 10% solution over two hours in addition to a 50 mL dextrose 50% IV push concomitantly with IV regular insulin if their pre-insulin glucose is ≤250 mg/dL. Patients were included if they were adults, received IV regular insulin from the order set within six hours of presenting to the ED, had a pre-insulin potassium >5.5 mmol/L, had a pre-insulin glucose ≤250 mg/dL, and had impaired renal clearance [creatinine clearance (CrCl) < 30 mL/min or dialysis dependent]. RESULTS: 100 patients were included in each arm. The median pre-insulin potassium levels were 6.4 mmol/L and 6.3 mmol/L in the old and new groups, respectively (p = 0.133). The median pre-insulin glucose levels were 120 mg/dL and 107.5 mg/dL in the old and new groups, respectively (p = 0.013). Twenty (20%) patients in the old group developed hypoglycemia, whereas six (6%) patients in the new group developed hypoglycemia (p = 0.003). There was no significant difference between the two groups in number of patients who achieved a post-insulin potassium level ≤ 5.5 mmol/L. CONCLUSION: Our study found that our approach of additionally administering a 250 mL dextrose 10% solution upon therapy initiation is associated with significantly lower rates of hypoglycemia. Our findings indicate that hypoglycemia rates can be significantly reduced in vulnerable populations if additional preventative measures are employed.",

Current practices rely on analgesics, physical therapy, bracing, and assistive devices. Dextrose prolotherapy (DPT) is a regenerative injection modality used to treat chronic painful musculoskeletal conditions through stimulation of tissue proliferation. The effectiveness of DPT for the treatment of chronic shoulder pain in patients with hEDS/HSD has not been established in the literature. Three patients with hEDS or HSD presented with refractory shoulder pain due to microinstability. Patients were treated with 20% DPT injected in the glenohumeral joint and surrounding structures as indicated. Outcomes assessed were pain and clinical improvement in joint stability at 2- to 7-week follow-up intervals. All patients reported subjective improvement in their shoulder pain and function. Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) scores after DPT decreased from initial assessment in all patients. Patients reported a cumulative improvement in pain and joint stability with each injection. Regenerative treatment with DPT may help restore structural integrity of affected joints and serve as an adjunctive therapy for the management of chronic shoulder pain due to microinstability in patients with hEDS/HSD."

DATA SOURCES: A comprehensive systematic search was conducted across MEDLINE (PubMed), Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials on November 13, 2023. These were supplemented by manual searches using Google Scholar. STUDY SELECTION: Two independent authors reviewed the literature, resolving any discrepancies through detailed discussions and consultation with a third author. DATA EXTRACTION: Data on primary outcomes (pain assessment) and secondary outcomes (symptom severity and functional status using the Boston Carpal Tunnel Questionnaire, electrophysiologic measures, cross-sectional area, and adverse effects) were extracted independently by the 2 authors (M.W. and H.H.). DATA SYNTHESIS: The analysis included 4 randomized controlled trials and 1 quasi-experimental study, encompassing a total of 212 patients (220 hands) with mild to moderate CTS. RESULTS: Within 3 months, the D5W injections showed a statistically significant improvement in functional status compared to the corticosteroids with a standard mean difference of -0.34 (95% CI, -0.62 to -0.05). D5W was associated with fewer adverse incidents than corticosteroids (risk ratio, 0.13; 95% CI: 0.03-0.51). No difference was observed between the 2 treatments in other areas. CONCLUSIONS: For patients with mild to moderate CTS, D5W injections were more effective than corticosteroid injections in improving functional status and demonstrated fewer adverse effects. D5W injections also paralleled corticosteroids in pain reduction, symptom severity, electrodiagnostic measures, and cross-sectional area of nerve, recommending D5W as a preferred treatment for mild to moderate CTS.",

Recently, ultrasound-guided hydrodissection of the greater occipital nerve (GON) has emerged as a promising minimally invasive approach. OBJECTIVES: To describe two novel ultrasound-guided hydrodissections with 5% dextrose for GON and discuss their advantages, disadvantages, and considerations. METHODS: Two cases are reported. Case 1 describes a lateral decubitus approach for hydrodissecting the GON between the semispinalis capitis (SSC) and obliquus capitis inferior (OCI) muscles. Case 2 details a cranial-to-caudal approach for hydrodissecting the GON within the SSC and upper trapezius (UT) muscles when the GON passes through these two muscles. RESULTS: Both patients experienced significant and sustained pain relief with improvements in function. CONCLUSIONS: Ultrasound-guided GON hydrodissection using 5% dextrose is a promising treatment for occipital neuralgia. The lateral decubitus and cranial-caudal approaches provide additional options to address patient-specific anatomical considerations and preferences."

This case report describes a 49-year-old pastor who presented with a three-year history of chronic pain affecting multiple sites, including the neck, bilateral shoulders, thoracic region, lower back, and bilateral knees. Additionally, he experienced shortness of breath on mild exertion, which adversely affected his ability to converse and speak publicly. The patient had a rapid resting heart rate of 100-120 beats per minute, occasional palpitations, and a 24-hour electrocardiogram that confirmed 15% premature ventricular complexes with bigeminy and trigeminy. He complained of limited appetite with early satiety, intermittent nausea, and regurgitation. Despite consultations with multiple specialists, no underlying causes were identified in the cardiac, respiratory, gastrointestinal, or psychological domains. Ultrasound-guided bilateral vagus nerve hydrodissection using 5% dextrose without local anesthetics was administered three times at monthly intervals, resulting in remarkable pain relief within three months and the effects persisted at the nine-month follow-up. Tachycardia was no longer perceived, resting heart rate slowed to 70-80 beats per minute, shortness of breath improved, and public speaking ability was restored. The patient's early satiety, nausea, and reflux complaints were resolved. This case report highlights the potential effectiveness of this novel intervention for chronic pain. Further research is warranted to validate these findings and explore the mechanism of action."

Most of the studies and recommendations for the unconscious hypoglycemic adult advocate the use of 25 g of glucose as 50 mL of 50% dextrose solution intravenous or 1 mg of intramuscular glucagon. OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy and safety of 5 g boluses of 10%, 25% and 50% dextrose in the treatment of hypoglycemic patients presenting to our emergency department. METHODS: This was a randomized controlled single blinded study. Hypoglycemic patients in altered mental status were randomized into three treatment arms to be administered 10%, 25% or 50% dextrose. 5 g aliquots of intravenous 10%,25% or 50% dextrose were administered over 1 min. Time taken to achieve a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) of 15 and median total doses (g) were the primary outcomes. RESULTS: Data of 204 patients were analysed in the study. There was no difference in the median time to achieve a GCS of 15 in all three treatment arms (6 min). Total median dose administered in the 10% and 25% groups was lower than 50% (10 g vs 15 g). Proportion of patients who received the maximum dose of 25 g was higher in the 50% group as compared to 10% and 25% groups (12%, 3%, 4%). CONCLUSION: There was no difference in 10% dextrose and 25% dextrose as compared to 50% dextrose in achieving the baseline mental status (or GCS 15) in the treatment of hypoglycemia in the ED.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: One of the most prevalent illnesses of the shoulder is rotator cuff tendinosis, which is also a major contributor to shoulder discomfort and shoulder joint dysfunction. According to statistics, rotator cuff tendinosis occurs in 0.3-5.5% of cases and affects 0.5-7.4% of people annually. It will be necessary to conduct a meta-analysis to evaluate the efficacy of hypertonic glucose proliferation therapy in the treatment of rotator cuff problems. METHODS: The databases Cochrane PubMed, Library, Web of Science and EMbase, are retrieved by the computer. Individuals with rotator cuff lesions in the intervention group were treated with hypertonic dextrose proliferation therapy, whereas individuals in the control condition were treated with a placebo. Outcome markers for rotator cuff lesions patients; Pursuant to studies, the visual analogue scale (VAS) score, the shoulder pain & disability index (SPADI), & other metrics are used to evaluate the effects of hypertonic dextrose proliferation treatment on individuals with rotator cuff diseases. After carefully evaluating the calibre of the literature, data analysis was performed utilising the RevMan 5.3 programme. RESULTS: Meta-analysis finally contained 6 papers. In six investigations, the test & control group's VAS scores improved, with the test team's score considerably outperforming the control team [standardized mean difference (SMD): 1.10; 95% Cl: 0.37,1.83; P < 0.01], shoulder pain and disability index (SPADI) score (SMD:8.13; 95% Cl: 5.34,10.91; P < 0.01), Flexion (SMD:5.73; 95% Cl: 0.99,10.47; P < 0.05), Abduction (SMD:6.49; 95% Cl: 0.66,12.31; P < 0.05), Internal rotation (SMD:-1.74; 95% Cl: -4.25,0.78; P = 0.176) and External rotation (SMD:2.78; 95% Cl: -0.13,5.69; P = 0.062). CONCLUSION: The findings of this study suggest that individuals with rotator cuff injuries may benefit from hypertonic dextrose proliferation treatment based on the visual analogue scale (VAS) score, the Shoulder Pain and Disability Index (SPADI) score, Flexion, & Abduction. These results must, nevertheless, be supported by high-caliber follow-up research.",

METHODS: In this prospective randomized, double-blind controlled clinical trial study performed in the ophthalmology clinic of Shafa Hospital (referral hospital for eye disease), Kerman, Iran, 105 premature neonates with birth weight ≤2000 g and gestational age between 28 and 34 weeks were studied. Pain score measurement with Premature Infant Pain Profile-Revised (PIPP-R) during ROP examination in three intervention groups, acetaminophen group (15 mg/kg oral acetaminophen), dextrose group (one cc of oral dextrose 50%), and placebo group (one cc of distilled water), was done. RESULTS: Out of 105 infants, 33 infants received acetaminophen drops, 35 infants received dextrose drops, and 37 infants received placebo. The mean pain score of the group receiving acetaminophen was 11.39, dextrose 12.17, and placebo 11.54. The acetaminophen group had a lower average PIPP-R score. This difference was not significant between the three groups (P = 0.38). CONCLUSIONS: Acetaminophen and dextrose in comparison with distilled water did not show a significant difference in reducing neonatal pain during ROP examinations. However, the PIPP-R score in the acetaminophen group was lower compared to the other groups."

METHODS: A medical chart review was conducted to compare data between before (April 2018 to March 2019, epoch 1) and after (September 2020 to November 2021, epoch 2) 40% DG implementation. DG, prepared by the hospital pharmaceutical unit, was applied within 30-45 min after birth, and three additional doses could be repeated during the first 6 h of life in combination with early feeding. The primary outcome was the rate of intravenous dextrose administration. Secondary outcomes were the incidence of hypoglycemia, first capillary blood glucose concentrations, and the length of hospital stay. RESULTS: Six hundred forty-three at-risk newborns were included (320 before and 323 after implementation of DG). Maternal and neonatal baseline characteristics were not different between the two epochs. The incidence of hypoglycemia was not different (17.8% in before versus 14.6% in after implementation, p = 0.26). The rate of intravenous dextrose administration after DG implementation was significantly lower than that before DG implementation (3.4% versus 10.3%, p < 0.001, risk reduction ratio = 0.33, 95% CI = 0.17-0.64). The length of hospital stay was not different between the two epochs. CONCLUSIONS: Implementing a protocol for administration of hospital-based 40% DG can reduce the need of intravenous dextrose administration among IDM, LGA and macrosomic neonates.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Prolotherapy is a minimally invasive technique that aims to functionally restore or repair the soft and hard tissues of the TMJ by injecting a stimulant. The present study was conducted to compare the effectiveness of dextrose and autologous blood injection (ABI) as prolotherapy agents in the treatment of patients with chronic recurrent TMJ dislocation (CRTD). MATERIALS AND METHOD: Thirty-two patients were divided into two groups-ABI and dextrose (n = 16 each). The superior joint space was located by means of cantho-tragal line and lavage. Delivery of prolotherapy agent was performed by single-needle technique. An elastic bandage was applied for a week and rehabilitation was initiated three weeks after the treatment. Pain level, joint hypermobility, maximal mouth opening, and frequency of dislocations were recorded at various follow-up intervals up to one year post-treatment. RESULTS: No significant difference (p > 0.05) was seen for the values between both groups at all time intervals in the pain level. At the 6-month and annual follow-ups, the mouth opening of the patients treated with ABI was significantly lower (p < 0.01) as compared to those treated with dextrose. The patients treated with ABI therapy exhibited fewer dislocations (p < 0.05) within the following year. CONCLUSION: Prolotherapy is a relatively noninvasive, safer, and effective treatment modality with a high success rate for patients with CRTD. Both, ABI and dextrose, proved effective in reducing the pain and joint hypermobility associated with CTRDs within a week. ABI proved to be more efficient in reducing the mouth opening and limiting the dislocation of TMJ as compared to dextrose therapy."

METHODS: <p>Total of 92 wrists that were diagnosed as mild-to-moderate idiopathic CTS and completed their follow-up were included in our study. The severity of pain, symptom severity and functional status were asses&shy;sed by visual analog scale (VAS) and the Boston Carpal Tunnel Syndrome Questionnaire (BCTQ) scores for treatment effectiveness. Randomized wrists were administered PCIT or 5%PDIT accompanied by ultrasound guidance. VAS, BCTQ scores and the electro&shy;physiological study repeated before and after treatment at the 1st and 6th months after perineural injection therapies (PITs) were recorded.</p>. RESULTS: <p>Compared with baseline data, within groups there was significant improvement in VAS, BCTQ severity and function scores at 1st and 6th months follow-up (all p &lt; 0.001). Considerable advance were detected in the median sensory nerve conduction velocity (SNCV) when pretreatment values were compared with posttreatment first month in both groups (p = 0.01; p &lt; 0.001, respectively). No significant change occurred in median distal motor latency (DML) values between the 1st and 6th months in the groups (p = 0.095; p = 0.113, respectively). No significant difference was observed bet&shy;ween 5%PDIT and PCIT groups.</p>. CONCLUSION: <p>Clinical and electrophysiologic improvement in CTS began from 1st month after PCIT and 5%PDIT. At the 6th month follow-up of the patients, 5%PDIT and PCIT had similar therapeutic effects. As a result, we can consider the replacement of PCIT with 5%PDIT in mild-to-moderate CTS patients especially in those who are hesitant because of the corticosteroid&rsquo;s adverse effects.</p>.",

      "abstract": "The objectives of this study were to assess: 1) differences in the metabolic status, systemic inflammation, daily milk yield, and daily rumination time between Holstein dairy cows with different vaginal discharge scores (VDS) in the first 7±3 DIM, and 2) effects of intrauterine dextrose infusion on metabolic status, systemic inflammation, daily milk yield and daily rumination time in dairy cows with VDS4 and VDS5. Cows (n=641) from a farm located in central Pennsylvania were screened at 7±3 DIM (study d 0) to assess vaginal discharge scores. Vaginal discharge was scored using a five-point scale (i.e., 1- clear fluid, 2- <50% white purulent fluid, 3- >50% white purulent fluid, 4- red-brownish fluid without fetid smell, and 5- fetid red-brownish watery fluid). Cows with VDS4 and VDS5 were blocked by parity and randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups: 1) CONV (VDS4 n=15; VDS5 n= 23): two injections of ceftiofur (per label; 6.6 mg/Kg) 72 h apart; and 2) DEX (VDS4 n=15; VDS5 n=22): three intrauterine infusions of a 50% dextrose solution (1 L/cow) every 24 h. Cows that presented a VDS 1, 2, and 3 were categorized as normal vaginal discharge animals (NOMVDS; n=35) and were randomly selected and matched by parity to CONV and DEX cows. Daily milk yield and rumination time for the first 150 DIM were collected from on-farm computer records. Blood samples were collected to assess haptoglobin (HP) and β-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) concentrations at study d 0, d 7, and d 14 relative to enrollment. Subclinical ketosis was defined as having a BHB concentration >1.2 mmol/dL at any of the sampling points. The data were analyzed using the MIXED and GLIMMIX procedures of SAS as a randomized complete block design. When comparing cows with different VDS (i.e., NOMVDS, VDS4, VDS5) separately, cows with VDS5 had the highest concentration of HP at enrollment compared to cows with VDS4 and NOMVDS; however, cows with VDS4 had higher concentrations of HP compared to cows with NOMVDS. Cows with VDS4 or VDS5 had a higher incidence of subclinical ketosis compared to cows with NOMVDS (p=0.005; VDS4= 62.08±9.16%; VDS5=74.44±6.74%; NOMVDS=34.36±8.53%). Similarly, daily milk yield (p<.0001; VDS4=30.17±1.32 kg/d; VDS5=27.40±1.27 kg/d; NOMVDS=35.14±1.35 kg/d) and daily rumination time (p=0.001; VDS4=490.77±19.44 min; VDS5=465±16.67 min; NOMVDS=558.29±18.80 min) was lower for cows with VDS4 and VDS5 compared to cows with NOMVDS at 7±3 days in milk. When analyzing HP concentration between treatment groups in cows with VDS4 (p=0.70), VDS5 (p=0.25), or VDS4 and VDS5 combined (p=0.31), there was no difference in HP concentration by study d 14 between treatment groups. Interestingly, when only cows with VDS4 were considered for treatment, both treatments, DEX and CONV, increased the daily milk yield to the levels of NOMVDS cows by 14 days in milk. On the other hand, when only cows with VDS5 were considered for treatment, cows treated with DEX produced, on average, 4.48 kg/d less milk in the first 150 days in milk compared to cows treated with CONV or cows that had NOMVDS. Similarly, when cows with either VDS4 or VDS5 were considered for treatment, DEX treatment also impaired milk yield. These results suggest that cows with either VDS 4 or 5 have an altered inflammatory status, and decreased milk yield and rumination compared to cows with NOMVDS. Furthermore, DEX treatment may have similar effects on daily milk yield and metabolic status compared to CONV in cows with VDS4, while DEX is not recommended for cows with VDS5.",

METHODS: A randomised controlled trial was conducted in non-critically ill children aged 6 mo to 14 y, admitted between August 2021 and July 2022, requiring intravenous fluids. A sample size of 140 was estimated and randomised, with controls receiving 5% DNS and the intervention group receiving RLD5. Kidney function tests and blood gas analysis were done at admission, 24 h and 48 h after starting the maintenance IV fluid, and outcomes were analysed at 24 h and 48 h. Data was collected using a pre-designed data collection form that included demographic and clinical profile details, and outcomes were analysed using SPSS Version 20 software. RESULTS: Seventy-one children per group were enrolled. The mean chloride difference between the two groups at 24 and 48 h were 1.67 (p-value 0.03) and 2.78 (p-value 0.01), respectively. The incidence of AKI at 24 h and 48 h was 1.4% and 2.8% in the RLD5 group and 0% and 1.4% in the DNS group, respectively. At 24 h and 48 h, 2.8% and 2.8% of children had HCMA in the RLD5 group, and 14% and 4.2% had HCMA in the DNS group, respectively. There was no mortality in either group. CONCLUSIONS: Though clinically insignificant, there was a statistically significant difference in the serum chloride levels between the groups."

METHODS: We performed a case-control study aiming to elucidate the factors associated with false-positive GM results. Independent risk factors for false-positive GM were evaluated through a multivariable regression analysis. An interrupted time series analysis was used to evaluate the effectiveness of an intervention removing the identified factors. RESULTS: Among 568 patients tested, GM was positive in 130 patients of whom 97 had false-positive GM (cases). These were compared with 427 patients with true-negative GM (controls). Administration of dextrose-containing fluids within 6 days before GM testing was an independent predictor for false-positive GM results (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 18.60; 95% CI, 8.95-38.66. An analysis of GM presence in different dextrose-containing fluids revealed positivity in 34.8% (8 of 23) (manufacturer A) and 33.3% (5 of 15) (manufacturer B) of the samples. Investigation of the manufacturing process revealed that the saccharification process employed enzymes derived from Aspergillus niger. After identifying the root cause of false positivity, GM-containing dextrose fluid use was restricted. Interrupted time series analysis showed an immediate reduction of GM false-positivity (-6.5% per week, p = 0.045) and a declining trend (-0.33% per week, p = 0.005) postintervention. CONCLUSIONS: Administering dextrose-containing fluids was the primary factor causing false-positive serum Aspergillus antigen GM assay results. Our investigation led to a modification of the manufacturing process of the dextrose-containing fluids.",

      "abstract": "Porcine intestinal mucosal proteins are novel animal proteins that contain large amounts of free amino acids and peptides. Although porcine intestinal mucosal proteins are widely used in animal nutrition, the peptide bioactivities of their enzymatic products are not yet fully understood. In the present study, we investigated the effect of porcine intestinal mucosal peptides (PIMP) on the RAW264.7 cell model of LPS-induced inflammation. The mRNA expression of inflammatory factors (interleukin 6, tumor necrosis factor-α, and interleukin-1β) and nitrous oxide levels were all measured by quantitative real-time PCR and cyclooxygenase-2 protein expression measured by Western blot. To investigate the modulating effect of PIMP and to establish a model of dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis in mice, we examined the effects of hematoxylin-eosin staining, myeloperoxidase levels, pro-inflammatory factor mRNA content, tight junction protein expression, and changes in intestinal flora. Nuclear factor κB pathway protein levels were also assessed by Western blot. PIMP has been shown in vitro to control inflammatory responses and prevent the activation of key associated signaling pathways. PIMP at doses of 100 and 400 mg/kg/day also alleviated intestinal inflammatory responses, reduced tissue damage caused by DSS, and improved intestinal barrier function. In addition, PIMP at 400 mg/kg/day successfully repaired the dysregulated gut microbiota and increased short-chain fatty acid levels. These findings suggest that PIMP may positively influence inflammatory responses and alleviate colitis. This study is the first to demonstrate the potential of PIMP as a functional food for the prevention and treatment of colitis."

Our team conducted a case series to examine the effect of prolotherapy on functional measures and quality of life in patients with knee osteoarthritis. Methods Our case series included 15 total patients consisting of male and female patients aged 50-85 years old with a prior diagnosis of knee osteoarthritis and moderate pain. The patients completed baseline Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC) and EuroQol-5 Dimension (EQ5D) surveys and received an ultrasound-guided intra-articular prolotherapy injection. The patients were then followed up by Telehealth at one-, two-, and three-month post-procedure. Results Data points for 15 patients were recorded over the duration of the three months. Results revealed significantly improved functional scores from the baseline period (M = 0.60) to the one-month (M = 0.43), two-month (M = 0.48), and three-month (M = 0.46), observed power = 0.99. Participants reported significantly lower pain scores between the baseline period (M = 0.60) compared to the one-month (M = 0.34), two-month (M = 0.35) and three-month (M = 0.39) periods. There was no statistical significance across time in participants' EQ5D scores. The repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) revealed no statistically significant differences in participants scores between the baseline (M = 64.4), one-month (M = 68.93), two-month (M = 68.47), or three-month (M = 68.33), observed power = 0.31. There were no statistically significant differences in participants WOMAC stiffness scores between the baseline (M = 0.67), one-month (M = 0.46), two-month (M = 0.57), or three-month (M = 0.56) periods, observed power = 0.73. The results revealed no significant change in participants' EQ5D and WOMAC stiffness scores. The results support a statistically significant improvement in patients' self-reported functioning and pain scores between the baseline and one-month, two-month, and three-month periods. Discussion The significant improvement in function occurred between the baseline and one-month time periods and the pain reduction was sustained throughout the two-month and three-month periods. Our study supports prolotherapy as an effective treatment option to improve pain and function in knee osteoarthritis. The study could be repeated with a large sample size to further investigate the effects of prolotherapy on quality-of-life measures."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Neonatal hypoglycaemia is a common condition that can be associated with brain injury. Current practice usually includes early identification of at-risk infants (e.g. infants of diabetic mothers; preterm, small- or large-for-gestational-age infants), and prophylactic measures are advised. However, these measures often involve use of formula milk or admission to the neonatal unit. Dextrose gel is non-invasive, inexpensive and effective for treatment of neonatal hypoglycaemia. Prophylactic dextrose gel can reduce the incidence of neonatal hypoglycaemia, thus potentially reducing separation of mother and baby and supporting breastfeeding, as well as preventing brain injury. This is an update of a previous Cochrane Review published in 2021. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness and safety of oral dextrose gel in preventing hypoglycaemia before first hospital discharge and reducing long-term neurodevelopmental impairment in newborn infants at risk of hypoglycaemia. SEARCH METHODS: We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and Epistemonikos in April 2023. We also searched clinical trials databases and the reference lists of retrieved articles. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs comparing oral dextrose gel versus placebo, no intervention, or other therapies for the prevention of neonatal hypoglycaemia. We included newborn infants at risk of hypoglycaemia, including infants of mothers with diabetes (all types), high or low birthweight, and born preterm (< 37 weeks), age from birth to 24 hours, who had not yet been diagnosed with hypoglycaemia. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed the risk of bias. We contacted investigators to obtain additional information. We used fixed-effect meta-analyses. We used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of evidence. MAIN RESULTS: We included two studies conducted in high-income countries comparing oral dextrose gel versus placebo in 2548 infants at risk of neonatal hypoglycaemia. Both of these studies were included in the previous version of this review, but new follow-up data were available for both. We judged these two studies to be at low risk of bias in 13/14 domains, and that the evidence for most outcomes was of moderate certainty. Meta-analysis of the two studies showed that oral dextrose gel reduces the risk of hypoglycaemia (risk ratio (RR) 0.87, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.79 to 0.95; risk difference (RD) -0.06, 95% CI -0.10 to -0.02; 2548 infants; high-certainty evidence). Evidence from two studies showed that there may be little to no difference in the risk of major neurological disability at two years of age after oral dextrose gel (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.68; 1554 children; low-certainty evidence). Meta-analysis of the two studies showed that oral dextrose gel probably reduces the risk of receipt of treatment for hypoglycaemia during initial hospital stay (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.00; 2548 infants; moderate-certainty evidence) but probably makes little or no difference to the risk of receipt of intravenous treatment for hypoglycaemia (RR 1.01, 0.68 to 1.49; 2548 infants; moderate-certainty evidence). Oral dextrose gel may have little or no effect on the risk of separation from the mother for treatment of hypoglycaemia (RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.55; two studies, 2548 infants; low-certainty evidence). There is probably little or no difference in the risk of adverse effects in infants who receive oral dextrose gel compared to placebo gel (RR 1.22, 95% CI 0.64 to 2.33; two studies, 2510 infants; moderate-certainty evidence), but there are no studies comparing oral dextrose with other comparators such as no intervention or other therapies. No data were available on exclusive breastfeeding after discharge. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Prophylactic oral dextrose gel reduces the risk of neonatal hypoglycaemia in at-risk infants and probably reduces the risk of treatment for hypoglycaemia without adverse effects. It may make little to no difference to the risk of major neurological disability at two years, but the confidence intervals include the possibility of substantial benefit or harm. Evidence at six to seven years is limited to a single small study. In view of its limited short-term benefits, prophylactic oral dextrose gel should not be incorporated into routine practice until additional information is available about the balance of risks and harms for later neurological disability. Additional large follow-up studies at two years of age or older are required. Future research should also be undertaken in other high-income countries, low- and middle-income countries, preterm infants, using other dextrose gel preparations, and using comparators other than placebo gel. There are three studies awaiting classification and one ongoing study which may alter the conclusions of the review when published.",

      "abstract": "Ketosis in dairy animals originates from negative energy status, associated increased absorption, and production of ketone bodies exceeding their use by the ruminants as an energy source. The present therapeutic experiment was carried out in 29 herds of Chilika buffaloes in 16 villages of three adjoining districts of Chilika Lake, Puri, Khurda, and Ganjam. Twenty Chilika buffaloes, detected positive for subclinical ketosis, were randomly selected for the study and divided into 2 groups, groups II and III, and were treated with hypertonic dextrose solution intravenously or gluconeogenic precursors along with nicotinamide orally, along with other supportive drugs in both the groups. Ten lactating Chilika buffaloes with no signs of ketosis and detected negative on Rothera test were included in the study as healthy controls (group I). Blood and milk samples were collected from all the 30 recruited buffaloes on days 0 (pre-treatment), 7, 14, and 28 for haematological and biochemical analysis. The subclinical ketosis in Chilika buffaloes did not have overt clinical signs. However, close examination revealed gradual drop in milk yield (100%), inappetence (59%), debility (46%), and uncoordinated gait (10%) without excitatory nervous signs. On day 7 following treatment, blood glucose concentration increased significantly. The mean serum triglyceride concentration of group III, treated with gluconeogenic precursors with nicotinamide, continued to decline significantly on subsequent observations. The serum enzyme activity, indicating status of liver function, declined following treatment in both the therapeutic groups. The intravenous administration of hypertonic dextrose solution compared to use of oral gluconeogenic precursors along with nicotinamide efficiently restored recovery from the subclinical ketosis in Chilika buffaloes."

      "abstract": "The aim of the present study was to compare the efficacy of hypertonic dextrose prolotherapy (HDP) with conventional physiotherapy (CPT) in improving symptoms in females with knee osteoarthritis (OA). The present study included 60 patients with a diagnosis of knee OA. The patients were randomly assigned to the HDP (n=30) and CPT (n=30) groups. The patients in the HDP group were treated with a dextrose injection into the knee joint (25% dextrose) and around the knee (15% dextrose) in two sessions for 1 month, while those in the CPT group received a hot pack, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation and therapeutic ultrasound in five sessions a week for 4 weeks. Prior to commencing the treatment, and at 1 and 3 months post-treatment, all the patients were evaluated using the visual analog scale (VAS), Western Ontario and McMaster Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC), the goniometric measurement of active knee range of motion (ROM), a 50-m walking test and isokinetic knee muscle strength measurements. There were no statistically significant differences between the two groups as regards the demographic characteristics at pre-treatment (P>0.05). However, at 1 and 3 months post-treatment, the scores of all the outcome parameters were significantly improved in the HDP group compared with the CPT group (P<0.05 for all). In both groups, a significant improvement was observed in the VAS scores, WOMAC total values and ROM following the treatments, with the greatest improvement observed in the HDP group (P<0.001). The isokinetic quadriceps peak torque measurements were increased in both groups following treatment. All the scores exhibited a statistically significant improvement in the HDP group at both 1 and 3 months post-treatment. On the whole, the results of the present study demonstrate that both HDP and CPT are effective treatment modalities to relieve pain, and increase functionality and strength in patients with knee OA. However, greater improvements in pain and functionality can be achieved with prolotherapy."

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: Effective treatment options for patients with hypernatremia are limited. Free water administration (parenterally or enterally) is the mainstay of treatment but the impact of each strategy on lowering serum sodium (Na) is not known. The purpose of the study was thus to assess the effectiveness of enteral free water vs. parenteral dextrose 5% in water (D5W) in treating ICU-acquired hypernatremia. METHODS: An electronic medical record-based, retrospective cohort study was conducted in a 30-bed mixed medical-surgical intensive care unit (ICU) in Japan. All adult patients admitted to the ICU from August 2017 to July 2021 were reviewed. After a 2-step exclusion, patients who stayed in the ICU ≥ 24 h and received either or both treatments for ICU-acquired hypernatremia (Na ≥ 145 mEq/L) constituted the study cohort. The primary outcome was a change in serum Na during the 24 h before treatment each day (ΔNa); the secondary outcomes were gastrointestinal complications, serum glucose levels, ICU/hospital mortality, ICU/hospital length of stay, and the duration of mechanical ventilation. Repeated measurements on each patient were addressed using a generalized estimated equation (GEE) for multiple linear regression analysis. Analysis was conducted with R version 4.0.3. RESULTS: In total, 256/6596 (131: D5W, 125: enteral free water) patients were analyzed. Median treatment lasted 6 days [3-17] for the D5W group vs 7 days [3-14] for the enteral free water group with a total median daily treatment volume of 799 [IQR 299-1221] mL vs. 400 [IQR 262-573] mL. GEE multiple linear regression analysis showed an estimated mean ΔNa per liter of treatment fluid of - 2.25 [95% CI - 2.76 to - 1.74] mEq/L per liter of parenteral D5W vs. - 1.91 mEq decrease [95% CI - 2.75 to - 1.07] per liter of enteral free water. Hydrochlorothiazide was the only medication associated with a statistically significant negative ΔNa by- 0.89 [- 1.57 to - 0.21] mEq/L. There were no significant inter-group differences for secondary outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that both enteral free water and parenteral D5W are effective for treating ICU-acquired hypernatremia. Parenteral D5W was slightly more effective than enteral free water to lower serum Na levels in patients with ICU-acquired hypernatremia. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Not applicable.",

The infusion stability of in-use (diluted) SB12 outside the conditions stated in the reference product's label is unknown. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to assess the stability of SB12 after extended storage in conditions not claimed in the originator label. METHODS: Infusion stability was assessed in SB12 samples (diluted in 0.9% NaCl, 0.45% NaCl, and 5% dextrose, final concentration of 5 mg/mL per clinical trial protocol and the reference product's label) kept at 5 ± 3 °C for up to 3 months, then 30 ± 2 °C/65 ± 5% relative humidity (RH) for 72 h. The product was stored in different containers [polyolefin (PO) bags, glass bottles and syringes], and the protocol followed International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) and European Medicines Agency (EMA) requirements for stability evaluation of biological products. Stability was evaluated using complementary assays, including pH, protein concentration (A280), purity (size exclusion-high-performance liquid chromatography, capillary electrophoresis-sodium dodecyl sulfate, and imaged capillary isoelectric focusing), biological activity (C5 binding and inhibition), and safety (subvisible particles). RESULTS: Except for charge variants in SB12 diluted in 5% dextrose, all results met the stability acceptance criteria. There were no major changes in terms of physicochemical stability, biological activity, and subvisible particles. CONCLUSIONS: The infusion stability of SB12 after extended storage (5 ± 3 °C for up to 3 months, then 30 ± 2 °C/65 ± 5% RH for 72 h) was demonstrated for longer periods and at higher temperatures than what is stated in the EU and US labels of the reference product. The physicochemical properties, biological activity, and subvisible particles of in-use SB12 diluted in 0.9% NaCl and 0.45% NaCl were maintained under the described conditions and for all tested containers. However, instability was observed for the diluted SB12 in 5% dextrose. These results may reduce the workload of clinical staff and minimize drug waste from treatment delays without any loss in product quality and biological activity.",

METHODS: In this study, 50 patients suffering from knee osteoarthritis were allocated into two groups as a double-blind randomized clinical trial. The first group received one session of dextrose prolotherapy as one intra-articular injection of 10cc dextrose 16% and periarticular intradermal injections of dextrose 12% at 4 points around the knee (2.5 cc at each point). The second group underwent therapy with one intra-articular injection of triamcinolone (40 mg). RESULTS: Compared to pretreatment, both interventions caused significant improvement in pain (evaluated by VAS) and WOMAC (all its components) in 1 and 3 months postintervention (all with P-value < 0.005). In the first month, pain reduction was significantly better in corticosteroid group (P-Value 0.002 and 0.048 respectively). In third month post intervention, improvements in VAS and WOMAC components were significantly greater in prolotherapy group. CONCLUSIONS: Both methods of corticosteroid and dextrose prolotherapy (combined intra and extraarticular technique) are effective on pain and function of patients with knee osteoarthritis. Compared to corticosteroid, prolotherapy method was associated with less pain reduction in short- term, but its effects were more persistent and in midterm examinations (3 months), it was more effective than corticosteroid."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To compare the effectiveness of prolotherapy with dextrose concentrations of 5%, 10%, and 20% in patients diagnosed with knee osteoarthritis. METHODS: This study was planned as a prospective, randomized controlled interventional trial. Prolotherapy at 5% dextrose concentration in group 1, 10% in group 2, and 20% in group 3 was applied to the knee intra-articularly and periarticularly at 0, 3, and 6 weeks, and a home exercise program was given. Group 4 received a home exercise program. All groups received hotpack therapy at weeks 0, 3, and 6. Outcome measures included the visual analog scale (VAS), Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC), knee range of motion, timed up and go test, and Short Form-36. RESULTS: A total of 128 patients were divided into 4 groups. At the 6th and 12th weeks, VAS scores were significantly lower in groups 2 and 3 than in group 4 (p < 0.05). At the 12th week, the WOMAC pain score was significantly lower in group 3 than in group 4, and WOMAC physical function and WOMAC total scores were significantly lower in groups 1, 2, and 3 than in group 4 (p < 0.05). Week 6 active and passive knee flexion and week 12 passive knee flexion were significantly higher in group 3 than in group 4 (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Although no significant difference was observed among the dextrose prolotherapy groups, higher dextrose concentrations demonstrated a greater improvement compared to the control group. Therefore, the use of 20% dextrose is recommended due to its significant superiority. Long-term follow-up and placebo-controlled studies are needed. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrial.gov Identifier: NCT05537077, registration date: 09.03.2022, retrospectively registered. Key Points • The utilization of dextrose prolotherapy has gained popularity in the management of osteoarthritis, aiming to harness its regenerative and proliferative properties. However, the comparative efficacy of various concentrations of dextrose prolotherapy in treating knee osteoarthritis remains unexplored in the literature. This study aimed to address this gap by comparing different concentrations of dextrose prolotherapy in the treatment of knee osteoarthritis. The findings revealed no statistically significant difference among the various concentrations of dextrose prolotherapy for knee osteoarthritis treatment.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the effect of dextrose prolotherapy in treating internal derangement of the temporomandibular joint. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 20 patients with temporomandibular joint internal derangement were enrolled in the study. The diagnosis of internal derangement was confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The posterior and anterior disc attachment, as well as the most tender part of the masseter muscle, were injected with 12.5% dextrose. Pain, maximum mouth opening, clicking, and deviation were assessed immediately before treatment, as well as at 2-, 4-, and 12- weeks post-treatment. RESULTS: There was a significant improvement in the four clinical variables at the three-time intervals. Pain at two weeks was reduced by 60% (6 vs. 3.75) and by 200% (6 vs. 1.9) at 4 weeks. The maximum mouth opening was increased by 6.4 mm at 2 weeks and 7.85 mm at 4 weeks. The percentage of patients with clicking decreased from 70%, preoperatively- to 50% at 2 weeks, 15% at 4 weeks, and 5% at 12 weeks. The ratio of patients with deviation was decreased from 80% preoperatively to 35% at 2 weeks, 15% at 4 weeks, and 5% at 12 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: Prolotherapy is a safe and effective treatment for alleviating the symptoms of internal derangement of the temporomandibular joint.",

METHODS: A \"Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome\" (PICO) strategy was executed using an electronic search through PubMed/MEDLINE, Cochrane databases, and Google Scholar from their inception to August 2022. Only randomized clinical trials investigating the treatment of TMJ-ID with hypertonic dextrose prolotherapy (HDPT) were included. Two independent reviewers assessed the eligibility of the studies with subsequent data extraction. RESULTS: The systematic search identified 392 studies, and only 8 articles were considered eligible for selection, with a total of 286 patients; 72% were females, and 28% were males. The extracted data showed positive effects of dextrose on joint pain and maximum mouth opening (MMO) with high patient satisfaction. CONCLUSION: HDPT can be effective in relieving TMD symptoms as it reduces pain, improves joint dysfunction, and increases MMO up to 12 months."

Cows (n = 245) from a dairy farm located in southwest Pennsylvania were screened at 4 ± 1 DIM using a Metricheck (Simcro Tech Ltd.) device to assess vaginal discharge. In addition, overall cow health (e.g., lameness, abnormal breathing) and rectal temperature were assessed at this time. Cows (n = 134) that presented a clear dense vaginal discharge, were in clinically good health status, and had a normal rectal temperature (i.e., <39.7°C) were blocked by parity (primiparous = 64; multiparous = 70) and randomly assigned to 1 of 3 groups: (1) SAL (n = 45): 1 intrauterine infusion of isotonic saline solution (1 L/cow); (2) DEX (n = 44): 1 intrauterine infusion of a 50% dextrose solution (1 L/cow), or (3) CON (n = 45): cows remained untreated. Cows were re-screened at 7 d after enrollment (11 ± 1 DIM) using the Metricheck device to assess CM incidence (research clinical metritis incidence; RCMI). On-farm computer records (i.e., Dairycomp 305) were also used to collect clinical metritis incidence (farm clinical metritis incidence; FCMI). In addition, BCS was assessed and blood samples were collected at enrollment and at study d 7, 14, and 21. Furthermore, daily milk yield and clinical disease events for the first 60 DIM were collected from on-farm computer records. The data were analyzed using the MIXED and GLIMMIX procedures of SAS (SAS Institute Inc.) as a randomized complete block design. Although not significant, the RCMI and FCMI in DEX and SAL cows were on average 14.5 and 18.1 percentage points higher, respectively, compared with CON cows. The SAL cows had higher BHB and haptoglobin concentrations and higher incidence of subclinical ketosis compared with CON cows on study d 7. With regard to daily milk yield, there was a day by treatment interaction, where CON cows produced more milk on certain days compared with DEX and SAL cows. Based on these findings, authors conclude that intrauterine dextrose infusion in clinically healthy postpartum cows with normal vaginal discharge may be prejudicial for cow health and performance."

Dextran is a homopolysaccharide composed of glucose as monosaccharide, and glucose units are connected by glycosidic bonds. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to explore the clinical efficacy of medical dextrose tincture liquid (medical dextrose tincture) in the treatment of facial photoaging. METHODS: Thirty-four volunteers were included in the randomized double-blind study. According to the random number table method, the subjects were randomized into control and treatment groups. The subjects in the control and treatment groups were treated with medical hyaluronic acid gel and medical dextrose tincture, respectively. They received mesotherapy therapy three times with an interval of 28 days between treatments. Video image acquisition was performed before treatment and 28 days after treatment. Skin moisture content, glossiness, heme content, collagen density, and elasticity were tested. The subjective evaluations of subjects and doctors before and after treatment were compared. RESULTS: Compared with the pre-treatment baseline, medical dextran tincture significantly increased skin moisture retention, skin gloss, and skin collagen density (p<0.001). Additionally, the skin retraction time was significantly reduced, and the skin retraction time was also markedly decreased after treatment with medical dextran tincture (p<0.001). The effects of medical dextran tincture were more significant in comparison with medical hyaluronic acid gel (p<0.05). The subjective evaluation results of doctors showed that after 84 days of treatment, the overall skin photoaging score was significantly reduced (p<0.001). The subjective evaluation results of volunteers showed that the various skin problems of more than 50% of volunteers were improved after treatment. CONCLUSION: Medical dextran tincture has obvious effects of moisturizing, increasing luster, improving skin redness, increasing skin collagen content and enhancing skin elasticity."

Administration of IV dextrose and transfer to the NICU may interfere with parent-infant bonding, breastfeeding, and has financial implications. OBJECTIVE: Retrospective study to evaluate the effect of dextrose gel supplementation for asymptomatic hypoglycemia in reducing NICU admissions and intravenous dextrose therapy. METHOD: A retrospective study conducted for eight months each before and after introduction of dextrose gel in the management of asymptomatic neonatal hypoglycemia. Asymptomatic hypoglycemic infants were given only feeds in pre dextrose gel period and dextrose gel along with feeds in the dextrose gel period. Rates of admission to NICU and the need of IV dextrose therapy were evaluated. RESULTS: High risk characteristics (Prematurity, Large for Gestational Age, small for Gestational Age, Infants of diabetic mother etc.) were equally distributed among both the cohorts. Primary outcome results showed significant reduction in NICU admissions from 396/1801(22%) to 329/1783 (18.5%) (odds ratio, 95% CI 1.24(1.05-1.46, p 0.008). There was significant reduction in IV dextrose therapy requirement from 277/1405 (15.4%) to 182/1454 (10.2%) (odds ratio, 95% CI 1.59(1.31- 1.95, p < 0.001).Babies discharged on predominant breast feeding showed significant improvement from 237/396(59.8%) in the pre dextrose gel period to 240/329 (72.9%) (odds ratio, 95% CI 0.82(0.73-0.90, p < 0.001) in dextrose gel period. CONCLUSIONS: Dextrose gel supplementation with feeds reduced NICU admissions, the need for parenteral dextrose therapy, avoided maternal separation and promoted breastfeeding.",

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 40 patients eligible for lower-limb surgery were divided into two groups by simple randomization: the control group which received only bupivacaine and the intervention group which received bupivacaine plus dextrose 5% and fentanyl. Anesthesia was induced by the spinal method. The visual analog scale (VAS) was used to assess the patients' pain; hemodynamic status (systolic and diastolic blood pressure and the heart rate) and oxygen saturation were also monitored. RESULTS: There was a significant difference between groups in the type of lower-limb movement at the L1 anesthesia level, the sensory block level at time zero after surgery, the type of backward movement at time zero after surgery, and the analgesic dose received (p < 0.05). Fifteen and 30 minutes after the start of surgery, mean systolic blood pressure, and 45 and 60 minutes after the start of surgery, systolic and diastolic blood pressure and the heart rate were significantly lower in the control group than in the intervention group (p < 0.05). The VAS score was significantly lower in the intervention group than in the control group at 6 and 24 hours after surgery (p < 0.05). Systolic and diastolic blood pressure at time zero, systolic blood pressure at hour 6, and diastolic blood pressure at hour 24 after surgery were significantly lower in the control group than in the intervention group (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The mean duration of anesthesia and analgesia was significantly longer in patients receiving bupivacaine plus fentanyl than in those receiving bupivacaine alone. However, concerning hemodynamic parameters, it cannot be concluded that the bupivacaine plus fentanyl receiving group was generally superior to the bupivacaine receiving group."

Several treatment modalities have been described in the literature for the same. The present study was undertaken to investigate the efficacy of heavy bupivacaine-dextrose prolotherapy (HDP) for the peri-articular tissues, superior joint space and the retro-discal area in the patients with symptomatic chronic sub-luxation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A preliminary clinical study was conducted among 60 patients diagnosed with chronic painful sub-luxation of the TMJ. Patients were divided into control group (CG), n = 30, where autologous blood was injected in the superior joint space, peri-capsular tissues and retro-discal area bilaterally as per the predetermined protocol; and the study group (SG), n = 30 patients were administered heavy bupivacaine-dextrose injection bilaterally in the peri-articular tissues, superior joint space and retro-discal area. The efficacy of the treatment was evaluated by assessing pain, maximum inter-incisal opening (MIO), changes in computed tomography scan, magnetic resonance imaging study, number and need for subsequent injections in both the groups. RESULT: Among the 60 patients, majority of the patients exhibited successful outcome after both the interventions, ABI and HDP. There was statistically significant reduction in recorded pain score with reduced MIO post-treatment. No morphological changes were noted in the condyle in both the groups. No complications were recorded among the study population. CONCLUSION: HDP is a safe and simple modality for treating symptomatic sub-luxation with predictable clinical outcome. Heavy bupivacaine-dextrose can be considered as a prolotherapeutic agent for symptomatic chronic temporomandibular joint sub-luxation with the pharmacological benefit of local anaesthesia and proliferent delivery through the same injection."

However, the superiority of one method over the other has not been studied in patients with TMJ subluxation. Therefore, this study aims to answer the following clinical question: among patients with TMJ subluxation, do those undergoing BTX-A injection into lateral pterygoid muscles, compared to those undergoing intra- and periarticular DP injections, have better outcomes in terms of locking episodes and patient satisfaction? METHODS: A randomized clinical trial was implemented in adult patients with TMJ subluxation. The sample was composed of patients with TMJ subluxation with painful open-locking during wide mouth opening and/or yawning at baseline. The subjects were treated randomly with one of two treatment techniques with equal numbers as follows: one-session BTX-A injection into lateral pterygoid muscles (BTX-A group) or three sessions of dextrose injections around TMJ (prolotherapy group). The predictor variable was the treatment technique (BTX-A or prolotherapy injections). The primary outcome variable was the frequency of locking episodes. The secondary outcome variable was patient satisfaction. The primary outcome variable was recorded at baseline and 8-12 months following the injections. The secondary outcome variable was recorded only 8-12 months following the injections. Descriptive and bivariate statistics were computed. The data were analyzed with the Wilcoxon and Mann-Whitney U tests. RESULTS: The baseline sample was composed of 30 patients with TMJ subluxation. However, the follow-up sample comprised 25 subjects: 11 (9 females, 2 males; 25.64 years) in the BTX-A group and 14 (10 females, 4 males; 32.37 years) in the prolotherapy group. Locking episodes decreased significantly in the two groups with no significant difference (P < .01). Seven patients in the BTX-A group (7 of 11 patients; 63.6 percent) and eight (8 of 14 patients; 57.1 percent) in the prolotherapy group reported no complaint of locking at the end of follow-up, with no significant difference between the groups (P > .05). Patient satisfaction showed no significant difference between the groups (P > .05). CONCLUSION: These findings suggested that BTX-A injection is no more effective than DP for any outcome variables of TMJ subluxation assessed.",

Autologous blood and dextrose are commonly used agents for prolotherapy and the aim of this study is to compare the autologous blood injection prolotherapy and 25% dextrose prolotherapy for the treatment of chronic recurrent TMJ dislocation. METHOD: This is a retrospective cohort study of 20 patients with chronic recurrent TMJ dislocation who were treated by either autologous blood (Group A) or 25% dextrose Prolotherapy (Group B). After prolotherapy, the patients were kept on follow-up and evaluated for maximum mouth opening (MMO), pain at visual analog scale (VAS), mandibular movements, frequency of dislocation, and TMJ sound. The collected data were then statistically analyzed. RESULTS: Group A showed better results in terms of reduction in MMO, mandibular movements as compared to Group B, and a statistically significant difference was found starting from 2 weeks post prolotherapy till 6 months follow-up. Whereas group B showed better results regarding reduction in pain intensity on VAS Scale at all follow-up visits. No statistically significant difference was found between both groups regarding reduction in the frequency of dislocation and TMJ sounds. CONCLUSION: Both autologous and dextrose prolotherapy gives promising results for the treatment of recurrent TMJ dislocation, however, regarding reduction in MMO and improvement in lateral and protrusive mandibular movements, autologous blood gave better results whereas 25% Dextrose was found to be more effective in terms of reduction of pain in recurrent TMJ dislocation cases."

      "abstract": "Low blood sugar is commonly found during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). However, current guidelines do not mention the importance of glucose testing and acute management for hypoglycemia during CPR. We intended to investigate the association between dextrose administration and resuscitation outcomes in patients with blood sugar less than 150 mg/dL during cardiac arrest in the emergency department (ED). We conducted a retrospective cohort study at a tertiary hospital between 2017 and 2020, including patients with intra-arrest blood glucose <150 mg/dL. Logistic regression with inverse probability treatment weighting (IPTW) was used. The primary outcome was the return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC). Secondary outcomes included survival to hospital admission and hospital discharge and favorable neurological outcomes at discharge. A total of 865 patients received CPR at the ED during the study period. Of these, 229 with low blood sugar were included (60 in the treatment group and 169 in the non-treatment group). The mean age was 59.5 ± 21.4 years. After IPTW, dextrose administration during CPR was not associated with ROSC (adjusted OR [aOR] 1.44, 95% CI 0.30−0.69), survival to hospital admission (aOR 1.27, 95% CI 0.54−3.00), survival to hospital discharge (aOR 0.68, 95% CI 0.20−2.29), and favorable neurological status (aOR 2.21, 95% CI 0.23−21.42). Our findings suggested that dextrose administration during CPR at the ED might not lead to better or worse resuscitation outcomes. Owing to the design limitations and residual confounding factors, strong recommendations for dextrose administration could not be formulated. Further evidence is needed from prospective trials to confirm the efficacy of dextrose during CPR."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Tennis elbow is a common painful condition with a prevalence rate of 1-3%. The condition starts as a micro-tear in extensor carpi radialis brevis and its degeneration because of repetitive overload. Conservative measures are undertaken initially because symptoms in most patients improve with time and rest. Adjunctive treatment includes steroid injection, autologous plasma, exercise, and prolotherapy. Dextrose prolotherapy by virtue of its multi-modal mechanism of action has emerged as a cost-effective treatment option for chronic musculoskeletal and arthritic pain. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 260 patients were included in the study and divided in two groups for administration of steroids or dextrose prolotherapy. The Visual Analog Scale (VAS) and Mayo Elbow Performance Scale (MEPS) scores were taken for patients at regular follow-up. RESULTS: All patients showed improvement in VAS score and MEPS score following dextrose prolotherapy as well as patients injected with steroids. CONCLUSION: Both prolotherapy and steroid injection offer adequate pain relief and functional outcome, although prolotherapy has been shown to be superior and given long-lasting results compared to steroid injection in management of tennis elbow."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this double-blinded randomized active-controlled trial, we randomly allocated 1 session of either 2 cc 5% dextrose or 1 cc methylprednisolone acetate mixed with 1 cc normal saline in 36 patients with mild to moderate CTS of single or both their wrists. The baseline VAS, BCTQ, electrophysiological studies, and sonography assessment of median nerve CSA were carried out at the baseline and 1-month and 3-month follow-ups, as well as recording demographic variables. RESULTS: A statistically significant decreasing trend in VAS (P < 0.0001), BCTQ-ss (P < 0.0001), median nerve CSA (P = 0.05), SNAP-PL (P < 0.0001), and CMAP-OL (P = 0.048) in both methylprednisolone and 5% dextrose groups was observed. No significant difference was observed in slope of the trend of studied parameters, including VAS (P = 0.95), BCTQ-ss (P = 0.88), BCTQ-F (P = 0.34), median nerve CSA (P = 0.321), SNAP-PL (P = 0.9), CMAP-OL (P = 0.799), SNAP-amplitude (P = 0.798), and CMAP-amplitude (P = 0.584). CONCLUSION: 5% dextrose perineural injection is an effective and safe treatment for mild to moderate CTS, in comparison with the short-term results attained from corticosteroids. Further randomized clinical trials with longer follow-up periods are warranted.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Lateral ankle sprain (LAS) is a common injury. Conservative care is not uniformly effective. Chronic ankle instability (CAI) results in up to 70% of patients with LAS in the physically active population. LAS, together with subsequent osteochondral lesions and pain in many patients, leads to the development of post-traumatic osteoarthritis, resulting in a substantial direct and indirect personal and societal health burden. Dextrose prolotherapy (DPT) is an injection-based therapy for many chronic musculoskeletal conditions but has not been tested for CAI. This protocol describes a randomized controlled trial to test the efficacy of DPT versus normal saline (NS) injections for chronic ankle instability (CAI). METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A single-center, parallel-group, randomized controlled trial will be conducted at a university-based primary care clinic in Hong Kong. A total of 114 patients with CAI will be randomly allocated (1:1) to DPT and NS groups. The primary outcome will be the Cumberland Ankle Instability Tool scores at 1 year. The secondary outcomes will be the number of re-sprains in 1 year, the Star Excursion Balance Test, the 5-level of EuroQol 5-dimension questionnaire, and the Foot and Ankle Ability Measure. All outcomes will be evaluated at baseline and at 16, 26, and 52 weeks using a linear mixed model. DISCUSSION: We hypothesized the DPT is a safe, easily accessible, and effective treatment for patients with CAI. This RCT study will inform whether DPT could be a primary non-surgical treatment for CAI. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Chinese Clinical Trial Registry ChiCTR2000040213 . Registered on 25 November 2020.",

DATA SOURCES: Four databases (MEDLINE [PubMed], Embase, the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, and Web of Science [WOS]) were researched from inception to the first of April 2022. STUDY SELECTION: Two authors independently screened the literature to identify the RCTs meeting the included criteria, which involved comparing corticosteroid, 5% dextrose water (D5W), and PRP injection with each other or placebo-controlled for treating CTS. DATA EXTRACTION: The 2 reviewers independently conducted information extraction, the utcomes included were the changes in Symptom Severity Scale, Functional Status Scale, and Visual Analog Scale at short-term follow-up after drug injection treatment and any adverse events reported. DATA SYNTHESIS: Twelve randomized controlled trials with 749 patients (817 hands) were included. The results of this study suggested that PRP injection was the most likely to relieve symptoms, improve functions, and alleviate pain, with the surface under the cumulative ranking curve being 91.5%, 92.7%, and 80.8%, respectively, after D5W injection (74.4%, 72.2%, 72.1%), and corticosteroid injection (33.7%, 31.9%, 46.2%). The injection of 3 drugs was significantly better than that of a placebo.

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Dextrose gel is widely used as first-line treatment for neonatal hypoglycaemia given its cost-effectiveness and ease of use. The Sugar Babies randomized trial first showed that 40% dextrose gel was more effective in reversing hypoglycaemia than feeding alone. Follow-up of the Sugar Babies Trial cohort at 2 and 4.5 years of age reported that dextrose gel appeared safe, with similar rates of neurosensory impairment in babies randomized to dextrose or placebo gel. However, some effects of neonatal hypoglycaemia may not become apparent until school age. METHODS: Follow-up of the Sugar Babies Trial cohort at 9-10 years of age was reported. The primary outcome was low educational achievement in reading or mathematics. Secondary outcomes included other aspects of educational achievement, executive function, visual-motor function, and psychosocial adaptation. RESULTS: Of 227 eligible children, 184 (81%) were assessed at a mean (SD) age of 9.3 (0.2) years. Low educational achievement was similar in dextrose and placebo groups (36/86 [42%] vs. 42/94 [45%]; RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.76, 1.44; p = 0.79). Children allocated to dextrose gel had lower visual perception standard scores (95.2 vs. 100.6; MD -5.68, 95% CI -9.79, -1.57; p = 0.006) and a greater proportion had low (<85) visual perception scores (20/88 [23%] vs. 10/95 [11%]; RR 2.23, 95% CI 1.13, 4.37; p = 0.02). Other secondary outcomes, including other aspects of visual-motor function, were similar in both groups. CONCLUSION: Treatment dextrose gel does not appear to result in any clinically significant differences in educational achievement or other neurodevelopmental outcomes at mid-childhood.",

DESIGN: Double-blinded, randomised controlled trial. SETTING: Three tertiary hospitals in Toronto, Canada. POPULATION: Adult women undergoing pelvic reconstructive surgery. METHODS: Patients were randomised to receive 100 mg of vitamin B2 preoperatively versus bladder distension with D5W intraoperatively. MAIN OUTCOMES: The primary outcome was the rate of accurate detection of bilateral ureteric jets during cystoscopy. Secondary outcomes included the time elapsed until visualisation, use of intravenous furosemide or fluorescein to assist with visualisation, surgeon satisfaction, and positive urine culture 1 week after surgery. RESULTS: The intervention was completed by 236 patients (vitamin B2 n = 117, D5W n = 119). Preoperative characteristics were similar across groups. Accurate detection of both ureteric jets was high in both groups (vitamin B2 97.4% vs. D5W 90.8%, p = 0.051). The vitamin B2 group had significantly lower use of fluorescein rescue compared with the D5W group (3.4% vs. 11.8%, respectively, p = 0.025). Surgeon satisfaction while using vitamin B2 was significantly higher (p < 0.001). There were no significant differences in the time elapsed until visualisation, the use of furosemide, or the incidence of positive urine culture at 1 week after surgery. CONCLUSIONS: Both preoperative vitamin B2 and intraoperative cystoscopy distension with D5W are highly available and inexpensive methods to detect ureteric jets with high accuracy at the time of pelvic reconstructive surgery. Vitamin B2 was shown to have lower rates of fluorescein rescue for visualisation and higher rates of surgeon satisfaction.",

PURPOSE: To compare the supraspinatus echogenicity and clinical effects of echo-guided hypertonic dextrose versus corticosteroid injection for treating chronic supraspinatus tendinopathy. STUDY DESIGN: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3. METHODS: The authors performed a secondary data analysis of a previous clinical trial including patients who received normal saline versus hypertonic dextrose injection; patients who received corticosteroid injection were recruited between August 2017 and July 2021. Baseline patient data were matched among these 3 groups at a 1:1:1 ratio. At baseline and 2, 6, and 12 weeks after the intervention, the authors compared morphological changes (supraspinatus thickness and echogenicity) and clinical parameters (visual analog scale [VAS] for pain, Shoulder Pain and Disability Index [SPADI], and range of motion [ROM]). Analysis of variance was used to compare mean changes from baseline among the groups. RESULTS: A total of 75 patients (25 in each group) were included. At 2-week follow-up, both the dextrose and the steroid groups exhibited improvement in VAS scores (mean difference [MD] from baseline: -2.0 in dextrose group; -3.3 in steroid group (P < .001)), SPADI scores (MD from baseline: -10.6 in dextrose group; -24.6 in steroid group (P < .001)), and flexion ROM (MD from baseline: 13.6° in dextrose group; 21.1° in steroid group) (P =.001). At 6 weeks after injection, the hypertonic dextrose group exhibited more favorable echogenic improvement in supraspinatus tendon morphology compared with the other 2 groups (P < .001). However, the steroid group showed significantly more improvement in clinical parameters compared with the other 2 groups at both week 6 (MD from baseline: VAS, -3.2; SPADI, -26.6; flexion ROM, 21.5°) and week 12 (MD from baseline: VAS, -2.5; SPADI, -20.4; flexion ROM, 15.2°) (P < .001 for all). CONCLUSION: Hypertonic dextrose injection improved supraspinatus echogenicity after 6 weeks but provided short-term symptomatic relief in the patients with chronic supraspinatus tendinopathy when compared with corticosteroid or saline injections. Steroid injection exerted a more favorable clinical effect at weeks 6 and 12 but demonstrated a negative effect on the supraspinatus."

DESIGN: A double-blind, parallel groups, randomized controlled study. SETTINGS: Outpatient Clinic. PARTICIPANTS: Sixty patients (N=60), aged 44.30±10.31 years old, with chronic lateral epicondylitis were allocated randomly into 3 groups. INTERVENTIONS: To Group 1 5% dextrose PrT, to Group 2 15% dextrose PrT, to Group 3 0.9% saline injections were done at 3 times (weeks 0, 3, 6), to the entheses of forearm extensors and annular ligament. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcomes were handgrip strength, visual analog scale-rest (VAS-R), visual analog scale-activity (VAS-A), pressure-pain threshold, and Quick Disability of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (Q-DASH). The secondary outcomes were clinical improvement (Disease Global Assessment Questionnaire), side effects, and complications. Primary outcomes were collected at baseline week 0, week 3, and 12. Secondary outcomes were collected at weeks 3 and 12. RESULTS: In Group 2, VAS-A and VAS-R (at week 3), handgrip strength and pressure-pain threshold (at week 12) were significantly different than other groups (P<.05). In Groups 1 and 2, there was a difference in primary outcomes at week 12 than baseline (P<.05). In Group 3, there was no difference in VAS-R, VAS-A, and handgrip strength at weeks 3 and 12 than baseline (P>.05). CONCLUSION: In chronic lateral epicondylitis, 5% and 15% dextrose PrT is more effective in pain, handgrip strength, functionality, and clinical improvement than %0.9 saline. There was no difference in functionality, clinical improvement, side effects, and complications between the PrT groups. 15% dextrose PrT was more effective in handgrip strength and pressure-pain threshold at week 12 and pain at week 3. We recommend 15% dextrose PrT based on this study.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The safety of giving intravenous (IV) maintenance fluids according to Holliday and Segar's recommendations of 1957 has recently been questioned after reports of complications caused by iatrogenic hyponatremia in children receiving hypotonic fluids. However, the current practice of choice of maintenance IV fluids for hospitalized children varies worldwide. This study was planned to compare 0.45% and 0.9% saline in 5% dextrose at standard maintenance rates in hospitalized children aged 3 months to 12 years. OBJECTIVE: Primary objective was to study change in serum sodium level at 24 hours in children receiving total IV fluid maintenance therapy as 0.45% or 0.9% normal saline in 5% dextrose. Secondary objectives of this study were to estimate change in serum sodium levels from the baseline to 48 or 72 hours, if IV fluids were continued, and to find incidence of hyponatremia and hypernatremia after administering these 2 types of maintenance fluids. METHODS: This study was an open-label, randomized control trial conducted at the Department of Pediatrics of a tertiary care hospital from July 22, 2019, to October 28, 2019. Two hundred children aged 3 months to 12 years admitted in pediatric emergency and requiring IV maintenance fluid were randomized into 2 groups (group A received 0.45% saline in 5% dextrose, group B received 0.9% normal saline in 5% dextrose) with 100 in each group. RESULTS: Both groups were comparable for baseline characteristics. Fall in mean serum sodium from baseline was more with increasing duration of IV fluids until 24 hours in 0.45% saline group as compared with 0.9% saline group, which was statistically significant (P < 0.001). The incidence of mild and moderate hyponatremia was significantly more in hypotonic group at 12 hours (P < 0.001) and 24 hours (P < 0.001). However, there was no significant difference at 48 hours. CONCLUSIONS: The fall in serum sodium values was significant, and there was significant risk of hyponatremia with the use of hypotonic fluids at 12 and 24 hours. Hence, the use of isotonic fluids seems to be more appropriate among the hospitalized children.Trial Registration: CTRI/2019/10/021791.",

DESIGN AND SETTING: Follow-up of participants in a randomised trial recruited in a tertiary centre and assessed in a research clinic. PATIENTS: Children who were hypoglycaemic (<2.6 mmol/L) recruited to the Sugar Babies Study (>35 weeks, <48 hours old) and randomised to treatment with 40% dextrose or placebo gel. INTERVENTIONS: Assessment of neurological status, cognitive ability (Weschler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence), executive function (five tasks), motor function (Movement Assessment Battery for Children-2 (MABC-2)), vision, visual processing (Beery-Buktenica Development Test of Visual Motor Integration (Beery VMI) and motion coherence thresholds) and growth at 2 years. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Neurosensory impairment (cerebral palsy; visual impairment; deafness; intelligence quotient <85; Beery VMI <85; MABC-2 score <15th centile; low performance on executive function or motion coherence). RESULTS: Of 237 babies randomised, 185 (78%) were assessed; 96 randomised to dextrose and 89 to placebo gel. Neurosensory impairment was similar in both groups (dextrose 36/96 (38%) vs placebo 34/87 (39%), relative risk 0.96, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.34, p=0.83). Secondary outcomes were also similar, except children randomised to dextrose had worse visual processing scores (mean (SD) 94.5 (15.9) vs 99.8 (15.9), p=0.02) but no differences in the proportion with visual processing scores <85 or other visual test scores. Children randomised to dextrose gel were taller (z-scores 0.18 (0.97) vs -0.17 (1.01), p=0.001) and heavier (0.57 (1.07) vs 0.29 (0.92), p=0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Treatment of neonatal hypoglycaemia (<2.6 mol/L) with dextrose gel does not alter neurosensory impairment at 4.5 years. However, further assessment of visual processing and growth may be warranted. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: ACTRN1260800062392.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Knee osteoarthritis (OA) is a chronic and progressive degenerative disease. It resulted from mechanical and chemical disorders that damage the joint and the underlying bone. The management of knee OA is challenging due to poor self-regeneration of connective tissues. Surgical treatment with prolotherapy approaches was conducted to treat medial compartment knee OA. AIM: To know the injection frequency to reach a 50% improvement in VAS score and WOMAC index. METHODS: Six patients who suffered from late-stage medial compartment knee OA underwent PFO followed by twelve sessions of intra-articular dextrose prolotherapy. The subjective pain score, visual analog scale (VAS), was assessed based on the patient subjectiveness before and after treatment. Patients marked the score from 0 to 10 cm to describe the current pain state. The functional index, the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis (WOMAC) index used to evaluate the Patient's clinical symptoms. It ranges from 0 to 96 points consisting of three main sections: pain (total 20 points), stiffness (total: eight points), and physical function disability (total 68 points). Higher scores indicate severe symptoms and function. RESULTS: Four patients showed pain relief and functional improvement with more than 50% scores of VAS and WOMAC after the treatment. Two patients received more than twelve doses of intra-articular dextrose prolotherapy due to a lack of progress. CONCLUSION: This study provides clinical evidence for a new treatment strategy for advanced knee OA. This combined therapy improves the patient's daily activity function and postpones the need for total knee arthroplasty (TKA)."

Hydrodissection with 5% dextrose is emerging as an effective treatment for primary CTS and may be an effective alternative treatment method for persistent or recurrent post-surgical CTS. We retrospectively investigated the long-term effectiveness of hydrodissection with 5% dextrose for persistent or recurrent CTS. Thirty-six of forty consecutively-treated patients with either persistent or recurrent symptoms of CTS after surgery, who were treated with ultrasound-guided hydrodissection of the median nerve using 10 mL of 5% dextrose, were available to provide outcome data by a structured phone interview at least six months after treatment completion. Symptom relief ≥ 50% represented an effective outcome, while symptom relief < 50% was rated as a poor outcome. Nearly 2/3 (61.1%) of patients reported an effective outcome after a mean of 3.1 injections, with a post-injection follow-up mean of 33 (6−67) months. A non-significant trend toward a more frequently-effective outcome was observed in those with recurrent versus persistent symptoms following CTS (76.9% vs. 52.2%, p = 0.165). However, a significantly higher percentage of those with recurrent symptoms reported an excellent outcome, defined as a greater than 70% improvement (8/13 [61.6%] vs. 3/23 [13%], p = 0.006). The percentage of patients achieving an effective outcome was not significantly different between <2, 2−4, and >4 years of post-treatment follow-up (36.4% vs. 77.8% vs. 57.1%; p = 0.077). Hydrodissection with 5% dextrose may result in a clinically important and durable benefit in those experiencing persistent or recurrent CTS after surgery."

DESIGN: Prospective double-blind randomized control study. SETTING: Training and research hospital. PARTICIPANTS: The study was completed with 40 patients with ulnar neuropathy at the elbow. INTERVENTION: Normal saline (0.9% sodium chloride) was injected in patients in the control group (n=20; mean age=38.1±10.7 years; median duration of symptoms=4.5 months), and 5% dextrose was injected in patients in the dextrose group (n=20; mean age=43.6±13.5 years; median duration of symptoms=5 months), perineurally under ultrasound guidance twice at 2-week intervals. Ultrasound-guided perineural injection of 1 cc each was administered into the ulnar nerve, 2 cm and 4 cm distal to the medial epicondyle, at the level of the medial epicondyle, and 2 cm and 4 cm proximal to the medial epicondyle. The amount of total fluid injected was 5 cc. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): At baseline and weeks 2, 4, and 12, the patients were evaluated with the Visual Analog Scale for pain and the Disabilities of the Arm Shoulder and Hand questionnaire for disability. Electrophysiological evaluation was performed with ulnar nerve conduction studies, and the ulnar nerve cross-sectional area was measured on ultrasonography. RESULTS: The improvements in pain, disability, ulnar motor nerve velocity, and ulnar nerve cross-sectional area in the dextrose group were superior to those in the control group, especially at weeks 4 and 12 (P<.001, using independent samples t tests). CONCLUSION: Perineural 5% dextrose may be an effective alternative therapy for those with ulnar neuropathy at the elbow for up to the 12th week.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Propofol, dextrose, and citrate infusions are necessary treatment modalities in the intensive care units (ICUs). They are, however, a potential source of nonnutritive calories (NNCs), which may cause overfeeding and adverse complications. The literature surrounding the role of NNCs is limited. We aimed to examine the energy contribution of NNCs. Our secondary aim is to assess the nutrition impact of NNCs, especially among patients receiving continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT). MATERIALS/METHODS: We enrolled 177 mechanically ventilated patients admitted to medical-surgical ICUs from August to December 2019. Patients were monitored over the first 7 days of admission. Infusion rates of enteral nutrition/parenteral nutrition and NNCs, as well as clinical characteristics, were examined. Patients receiving CRRT were compared with those without. RESULTS: In total, 24% of patients additional energy from citrate. Patients received a maximum of 331 kcal from citrate, 492 kcal from propofol, and 992 kcal from dextrose per ICU day. CRRT group achieved higher total energy on the first 2 days (day 1: 55.1% vs 46.4%, P = 0.008; day 2: 73.2% vs 55.4%, P = 0.025). They also received higher mean NNCs on all days, except for day 1 (P = 0.068). CONCLUSION: NNCs, especially citrate, are significant sources of energy. Patients receiving CRRT were more likely to be malnourished. There should be close monitoring and adaption of energy prescription accordingly to prevent overfeeding.",

Dextrose gel may reduce admissions and mother-infant separation. We aimed to study the utility of dextrose gel in reducing the need for intravenous fluids. METHODS: This stratified randomized control trial included at-risk infants with asymptomatic hypoglycemia. Study populations were stratified into 3 categories: small for gestational age (SGA) and intrauterine growth-restriction (IUGR), infants of diabetic mothers (IDM) and large for gestational age (LGA), and late preterm (LPT) neonates. Intervention group received dextrose gel followed by breastfeeding, and the control group (CG) received only breastfeeding. RESULTS: Among 629 at-risk infants, 291 (46%) developed asymptomatic hypoglycemia; 147 (50.4%) in the dextrose gel group (DGG) and 144 (49.6%) in CG. There were 97, 98, and 96 infants in SGA/IUGR, IDM/LGA, and LPT categories, respectively. Treatment failure in the DGG was 17 (11.5%) compared to 58 (40.2%) in CG, with a risk ratio of 0.28 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.17-0.46; P < .001). Treatment failure was significantly less in DGG in all 3 categories: SGA/IUGR, IDM/LGA, and LPT with a risk ratio of 0.29 (95% CI:0.13-0.67), 0.31 (95% CI:0.14-0.66) and 0.24 (95% CI:0.09-0.66), respectively.

Patients in group I showed significant improvement in pain and MIO, and higher satisfaction with treatment than patients in group II. Compared to saline injection, dextrose injection resulted in an improvement in JS but without significant difference within and between groups.

Secondary outcomes included PIPP scores at 60 and 120 seconds, PIPP-Revised scores at 30, 60, and 120 seconds, and any adverse events. RESULTS: Sixty-four infants were enrolled (32 in each group). The mean (SD) PIPP score at 30 seconds was 6.41 (2.56) in the dextrose group and 7.03 (2.23) in the sucrose group (mean difference, -0.63 (95% confidence interval, -1.85 to 0.60; P = .31). The upper margin of the confidence interval did not cross the predefined noninferiority margin of 2. The mean PIPP scores at 60 (5.03 [2.18] vs 5.39 [1.48]) and 120 (4.75 [1.97] vs 4.94 [1.46]) seconds were also similar. The PIPP-Revised scores between the 2 groups at all time intervals were comparable. One infant in the intervention group had a transient coughing episode. CONCLUSIONS: In preterm infants under intensive care, 25% dextrose is noninferior to 24% sucrose for heel-lance analgesia as assessed by PIPP score.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To determine whether intra-articular coinjection with hypertonic dextrose improves the outcome of hyaluronic acid (HA) prolotherapy for knee osteoarthritis (OA). DESIGN: Prospective, randomized, double-blind trial. SETTING: Medical center in Taiwan. PARTICIPANTS: In total, 104 participants who fulfilled the American College of Rheumatology clinical and radiographic criteria for knee OA with a Kellgren-Lawrence score of 2 or 3 were recruited (N=104). INTERVENTIONS: The participants were blocked randomized to the treatment (HA and hypertonic dextrose) or control (HA and normal saline) group. Ultrasound-guided knee intra-articular injections were administered once a week for 3 weeks. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcomes were performance-based physical function measures (regular and fastest walking speed, stair climbing time, and chair rising time), and the secondary outcomes were the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) and Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS). The outcome measures were assessed before the injections and at 1 week and 1, 3, and 6 months after the injections. The data were analyzed through repeated-measures analysis of covariance. RESULTS: Significant intergroup difference-in-differences favoring the treatment group were observed for improvements in stair climbing time (-1.6; 95% confidence interval, -8.56 to 4.16; P=.38) and WOMAC physical function (-21.2; 95% confidence interval, -126.05 to 103.83; P = .045) at 6 months. The group×time interaction effects favored the treatment group for regular (P=.001) and fastest walking speed (P=.001) and chair rising time (P=.038); WOMAC stiffness (P < .001) and physical function (P = .003); and KOOS for pain (P = .035), other symptoms (P=.022), and quality of life (P=.012). CONCLUSIONS: Compared with HA plus normal saline coinjections, HA plus dextrose coinjections resulted in more significant improvements in stair climbing time and physical function at 6 months, effectively decreased pain, and improved physical function and physical functional performance from 1 week to 6 months. HA plus dextrose coinjections could be a suitable adjuvant therapy for patients with knee OA.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Due to the anti-inflammatory effects of dextrose prolotherapy, we evaluated the effectiveness of extra-articular, neurofascial dextrose prolotherapy in chronic ankle ligament injury. METHODS: Patients with chronic ankle ligament injury entered this uncontrolled before-after study based on eligibility criteria. Patients who consented to participate in the study filled out the prepared questionnaire containing demographic data, the Cumberland ankle instability tool (CAIT), and the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). The initial CAIT score of less than 25 indicated functional instability following an ankle sprain. Patients underwent neurofascial prolotherapy with dextrose 12.5%. Two injections within one month were done. The CAIT was completed one, three, and six months after the intervention. RESULTS: Twenty-five patients with chronic ankle ligament injury were investigated. The mean CAIT score was 1.88 (± 2.35) before the intervention, which increased significantly over the study (P < 0.001). The CAIT score reached 21.84 (± 6.04) in the sixth month after the intervention. Moreover, the VAS score decreased significantly over the study from 6.12 (± 2.35) before the intervention to 1.24 (± 0.43) in the sixth month after the intervention (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings revealed the therapeutic effectiveness of dextrose neurofascial prolotherapy in decreasing pain and functional instability in patients suffering chronic ankle pain due to ligamentous injury accompanied by chronic ankle instability."
