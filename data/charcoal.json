      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Antibiotic treatment contributes to gut microbiota dysbiosis. Previous studies have shown that fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), fecal filtrate (FF), and activated charcoal (AC) treatments can prevent gut microbiota disturbances caused by antibiotics or Clostridioides difficile infection. However, these treatments have typically been limited to restoring gut microbiota after dysbiosis, and antibiotics must be discontinued beforehand. Here, we investigated the protective effects of these treatments on gut microbiota to prevent dysbiosis during concurrent systemic ceftriaxone administration. METHODS: C57BL/6 mice that received intraperitoneal ceftriaxone for seven consecutive days were concomitantly treated with AC, FMT, FMT + AC, FF, or FF + AC via oral gavage. Gut microbiomes were analyzed using 16 S rRNA gene sequencing, and intestinal mucosal pathology was evaluated through H&E staining. RESULTS: Systemic ceftriaxone administration significantly altered gut microbiota diversity and composition but did not affect intestinal mucosal histology. Alpha and beta diversity analyses showed that microbiota diversity decreased in all ceftriaxone-treated groups, with the ceftriaxone + FF + AC group retaining the highest diversity. The ceftriaxone + AC group had higher Enterococcus but lower Muribaculaceae relative abundances than the control (no ceftriaxone), ceftriaxone only, and ceftriaxone + FF + AC groups. CONCLUSIONS: These results show that fecal filtrate transplantation combined with activated charcoal treatment may help balance gut microbiota diversity and reduce the presence of resistant bacteria during ceftriaxone exposure.",

      "abstract": "Ammonia separation from industrial effluents is a big concern for aquatic, plant, and human lives. Adsorption is best suited for separating ammonia from effluents due to its high effectiveness. In this paper, the activated Madhuca indica leaves charcoal (AMLC) adsorbent was synthesized and characterized using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and scanning electron microscopy with energy-dispersive X-ray analysis (SEM-EDX) to know the characteristics of the adsorbent before and after adsorption. Further, thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) analysis were performed on the AMLC adsorbent, and a very high surface area of 964.252 m2/g was observed. The AMLC was utilized for adsorption experiments, and the adsorption parameters were optimized using response surface methodology-Box-Behnken design (RSM-BBD). The optimized parameters reported using RSM-BBD are a contact time of 123.19 min, an adsorbent dosage of 29.1 g/L, a pH of 10.33, an initial ammonia concentration of 312.28 mg/L, and a shaker speed of 82.70 rpm that gives the maximum ammonia removal efficiency of 100%. The adsorption equilibrium studies were analyzed using Langmuir, Freundlich, and Dubinin isotherms, with the Langmuir isotherm being the best fit for the data. The adsorption kinetics were modeled with pseudo-first-order (PFO), pseudo-second-order (PSO), and intraparticle diffusion (IPD) models, indicating that PSO best describes the rate of kinetics. In addition, adsorption thermodynamics is also studied. The change in enthalpy (ΔH) was positive, suggesting that the adsorption is an endothermic process. The negative energy of entropy (ΔS) indicated complex formation with the AMLC adsorbent. In contrast, the positive change in Gibb's free energy showed that adsorption was not spontaneous. The present study supports UN SDG Goal 6 by providing sustainable and cost-effective solutions to water treatment. It also promotes biomass use and reduces chemical usage toward an eco-friendly water purification process."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The role of uremic toxins in the progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and novel treatments to mitigate their effects are critical areas of research. This pilot study investigated the efficacy of a novel activated bamboo charcoal and/or probiotics in reducing uremic toxins and improving renal function in CKD patients. METHODS: This prospective, randomized, open, blinded end-point (PROBE) study included patients with stage 3 CKD. Patients were randomly assigned to one of four groups: activated bamboo charcoal (ABC), probiotics, ABC with probiotics, or standard treatment for 3 months. RESULTS: A total of 46 patients were enrolled (mean age 66.7 ± 11.5 years, 71.7% male). The ABC and ABC with probiotics groups showed a significant reduction in serum levels of the uremic toxins trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), p-cresyl sulfate (PCS), indoxyl sulfate (IS), and phenyl sulfate (PS) after 3 months of treatment (all p < 0.05). There was a particularly pronounced decrease in the percentage of IS in both the ABC group (-23.9 ± 28.9% vs. 33.9 ± 63.4%, p = 0.005) and the ABC with probiotics group (-29.3 ± 30.6% vs. 33.9 ± 63.4%, p = 0.009). The eGFR change ratio also significantly improved in the ABC group compared to the control group (4.6 ± 10.2% vs. -8.6 ± 12.5%, p = 0.011). However, the probiotics group did not exhibit a similar reduction in uremic toxins or an improvement in the eGFR. CONCLUSION: This study suggested that ABC significantly reduced uremic toxins and might have potential in improving eGFR in CKD stage 3 patients over a 3-month period. These findings suggest a potential protective effect of ABC on kidney function, highlighting the need for further large-scale, long-term randomized controlled trials to confirm these results.",

      "abstract": "The primary extraction way for unconventional oil/gas resources is hydraulic fracturing to alter the reservoir for commercial production. However, hydraulic fracturing technology consumes a large amount of water, and the flowback water can easily be mixed with hydrocarbon substances to form emulsions. To achieve the recycling of water, it is necessary to develop an efficient continuous demulsification method for treating the flowback fluid. In this study, a composite filtration layer with superhydrophilic and superoleophilic properties was successfully prepared using water-based polyurethane as a binder. The g-C3N4 was used to improve the affinity of the filtration layer to water and oil. The diatomite and rice husk carbon were used as an adsorbent and a filter aid, respectively. The contact angles (CA) of both oil and water on the surface of the filtration layer were measured to be 0°. During the demulsification process, vacuum filtration was employed to increase the pressure difference across the filtration layer, thereby improving the treatment flux of flowback fluid. The experimental results showed that the filtration flux with the addition of rice husk charcoal increased from 160.58 L∙m-2∙h-1 to 174.68 L∙m-2∙h-1 compared to the filter layer without rice husk charcoal. Based on the composite filtration layer, the apparent demulsification efficiency exceeded 90.6% for various types of emulsion. The mechanism of demulsification was investigated by the molecular dynamics method. The results showed that the adsorption layer density of water molecules reached 1.5 g/cm3, and the adsorption layer density of oil molecules exceeded 2.5 g/cm3. The porous structure wall has a strong adsorption effect on both oil and water molecules, resulting in deformation and destruction of the oil-water interface, so that the dispersed phase is adsorbed and aggregated by the filter layer at the same time and permeates from the filter layer after reaching saturation, thus separating the two phases."

      "abstract": "To investigate the potential of activated carbon from palm kernel shell waste for 99mTc-radiolabeled nanocarbon aerosol, a new production technology for carbon-based 99mTc-radioaerosol from such a waste was developed. Treated-palm shell charcoal (t-PSC) was prepared by hydrothermal method to increase the surface area, followed by 99mTc radiolabelling optimization. The optimal 99mTc radiolabeling conditions resulted in an adsorption capacity of 21.43 ng Re/g t-PSC (8.32 GBq 99mTc/g t-PSC). After high-energy milling treatment, fines particle fraction (FPF), and median mass aerodynamic diameter (MMAD) of the milled t-PSC were 28.34 ± 0.61%, and 8.31 ± 2.31 μm, respectively. The results imply that 99mTc-labeled t-PSC has a potential for lung ventilation scan agents with the optimization of milling process to reduce the aerodynamic size within the optimal lung delivery of less than 5 μm.",

      "abstract": "The treatment of antibiotic wastewater often faces the challenge of simultaneously and effectively degrading multiple components under complex conditions. To address this challenge, magnetite nanoparticles doped ultrafine activated charcoal powder (MNPs/UACP), which effectively catalyzed the decomposition of H2O2 into •OH and HO2•, was prepared using chemical co-precipitation. Under optimum conditions (i.e., tetracycline (TC) concentration = 100 ppm, pH = 3, H2O2 concentration = 4.9 mM, catalyst dosage = 0.5 g/L), the 50% MNPs/UACP-H2O2 system achieved 97.5% TC removal within 180 min, driven by the synergistic action between adsorption and catalytic oxidation. The stability of 50% MNPs/UACP in recycling was evaluated through repeated reaction cycles, demonstrating that the TC removal efficiency remained at 91.0% even after five cycles. The competition among TC, oxytetracycline (OTC), and chloramphenicol (CAP) in the MNPs/UACP-H2O2 system was closely related to the catalytic oxidation performance, and increasing the proportion of MNPs in MNPs/UACP to above 50% effectively reduced the competition, optimizing degradation efficiency. This study is among the first to provide a comprehensive understanding of adsorption-catalytic oxidation coupled system, offering new insights for broad environmental applications.",

A structured cross-sectional approach was employed, surveying 308 households through questionnaires and interviews. Key socio-economic factors such as income level, family size, education, and age were found to significantly affect ICS adoption (p < 0.05), whereas cooking location, household decision-making, and involvement of societal stakeholders did not show a statistically significant impact (p > 0.05). The primary barriers to ICS adoption included limited awareness, high costs, and age-related factors. Addressing these challenges by targeting the significant socio-economic determinants is crucial for facilitating the transition from traditional to improved cookstoves. The findings offer valuable insights for policymakers, NGOs, research organizations, and manufacturers, highlighting potential areas for targeted intervention to enhance ICS adoption in the community.",

      "abstract": "Charcoal rot, caused by the soilborne fungus Macrophomina phaseolina, is one of the most economically important diseases affecting strawberry (Fragaria ×ananassa) production in California. Previous studies on non-strawberry hosts have shown that proper soil moisture management can limit pathogen colonization of plants and decrease disease severity. We performed field and greenhouse studies for two seasons with the objective of investigating the role of soil moisture in disease development and management of charcoal rot of strawberries. Bare-root transplants of cultivars Monterey and Fronteras were inoculated or not inoculated and maintained at either a high, optimal, or low soil moisture level using tensiometers. Randomly selected plants from each treatment were sampled for pathogen colonization every 4 weeks after planting, and all plants were visually rated for disease severity every 2 weeks after symptom onset. In both seasons, low soil moisture significantly increased charcoal rot mortality among inoculated plants compared to optimal soil moisture by 16 and 24 percentage points, respectively. In the first season, mortality was significantly lower in the high compared to the optimal soil moisture treatment. Colonization of crowns was increased by low soil moisture among inoculated plants in the first season, but soil moisture did not influence root colonization in either year of the study. In the greenhouse, charcoal rot severity was highest in the low soil moisture treatment. These results indicate that soil moisture has a limited influence on colonization of strawberries by M. phaseolina and that maintaining optimal soil moisture can help prevent excess charcoal rot mortality."

      "abstract": "The mung bean crop (Vigna radiata (L.) R. Wilczek) is widely recognized as a key source of pulse food worldwide. However, this crop suffers substantial yield losses due to humid environments, particularly from infestations by the fungal pathogen Macrophomina phaseolina, which causes charcoal rot disease. This infestation results in significant agronomic losses, affecting both the crop's growth characteristics and overall yield. Previous research suggests that these losses can be mitigated through environmentally friendly soil amendments, such as biochar, as well as by applying various nanofungicides. This study aims to explore the potential of biochar and zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnONPs) to reduce the severity of charcoal rot disease and enhance the agronomic traits and yield of mung bean plants affected by this disease. The experiment was conducted in triplicate, applying ZnONPs at three concentrations (5, 10, and 20 mg. L- 1) via foliar spraying, combined with two levels of biochar (20 g and 40 g per pot). Positive and negative control treatments were also included for comparison. The results demonstrated that applying 40 g of biochar per pot and 20 mg. L- 1 of foliar-applied ZnONPs increased the activities of the anti-oxidative defence enzymes. Additionally, this treatment strategy boosted the plants' disease resistance mechanisms, leading to lower mortality rates and reduced levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) and hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂) by 61.7% and 49.23%. Moreover, the treatment positively impacted key growth parameters, increasing total chlorophyll content by 43%, plant height by 47%, and legume count per plant by 80.4%. The application of biochar and ZnONPs also improved seed protein content, reflecting an enhancement in nutritional quality. This study supports the use of biochar and ZnONPs as biostimulants to manage yield losses in mung bean crops affected by charcoal rot disease. The future prospects of using ZnONPs and biochar as treatments in agriculture are promising, as they offer innovative, eco-friendly solutions to enhance crop productivity, improve soil health, and reduce reliance on synthetic chemicals, paving the way for more sustainable and resilient agricultural systems.",

      "abstract": "Carbon-based electrodes have recently been most widely used in P-MFC due to their desirable properties such as biocompatibility, chemical stability, affordable price, corrosion resistance, and ease of regeneration. In general, carbon-based electrodes, particularly graphite, are produced using a complex process based on petroleum derivatives at very high temperatures. This study aims to produce electrodes from bio-pitch and charcoal powder as an alternative to graphite electrodes. The carbons used to manufacture the electrodes were obtained by the carbonisation of Robinia pseudoacacia and Azadirachta indica wood. These carbons were pulverised, sieved to 50 µm, and used as the raw materials for electrode manufacturing. The binder used was bio-pitch derived from coconut shells as the raw materials. The density and coking value of the bio-pitch revealed its potential as a good alternative to coal-tar pitch for electrode manufacturing. The electrodes were made by mixing 66.50% of each carbon powder and 33.50% of bio-pitch. The resulting mixture was moulded into a cylindrical tube 8 mm in diameter and 80 mm in length. The raw electrodes obtained were subjected to heat treatment at 800 °C or 1000 °C in an inert medium. The electrical resistivity obtained by the four-point method showed that N1000 has an electrical resistivity at least five times lower than all the electrodes developed and two times higher than that of G. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) was used to determine the compositional features of the samples and their surface roughness was characterised by atomic force microscopy (AFM). Charge transfer was determined by electrical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The FTIR of the electrodes showed that N1000 has a spectrum that is more similar to that of G compared to the others. The EIS showed the high ionic mobility of the ions and therefore that N1000 has a higher charge transfer compared to G and the others. AFM analysis revealed that N1000 had the highest surface roughness in this study."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Bamboo charcoal powder (BCP) is increasingly used as a food colorant. This study aims to evaluate the effects of BCP consumption on improving high-fat diet-induced hyperlipidemia. METHODS: Fifty male SD rats were randomly assigned into five groups, with 10 rats in each group: the control group was fed a low-fat diet (LFD); the model control group was fed a high-fat diet (HFD); the low-BCP dose group was fed a HFD and given 2.81 g of BCP/kg of body weight (BCP-L) by gavage; the medium-BCP dose group was fed a HFD and given 5.62 g of BCP/kg of body weight (BCP-M) by gavage; the high-BCP dose group was fed a HFD and given 11.24 g of BCP/kg of body weight (BCP-H) by gavage. RESULTS: After 90 days, the consumption of BCP caused a decrease in body weight, plasma lipids (triglyceride, cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein (LDL)), liver triglyceride, and cholesterol levels, and liver histopathological scores. BCP caused a significant increase in superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity and total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC) in liver tissues. BCP also led to an increase in 72-h fecal dry weight and crude fat in a rat metabolic cage. The analysis of fecal samples with liquid chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LC-Q-TOF-MS) showed that the biomarkers associated with BCP consumption were mainly related to fatty and amino acid metabolism. Notably, BCP treatment significantly promoted linoleic acid metabolism. DISCUSSION: These results suggest that BCP may have a preventive effect against diet-induced hyperlipidemia through the promotion of fecal fat excretion. BCP may potentially be used as an alternative functional food component for people with diet-induced hyperlipidemia."

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: To compare charcoal-containing dentifrices (CDs) to non-charcoal containing dentifrices (NCDs) through the following experiments: potentially available fluoride, 1-minute fluoride release, pH, cytotoxicity, heavy metals, enamel fluoride uptake (EFU) and relative dentin abrasivity (RDA). METHODS: Nine fluoride dentifrices; six CDs and three NCDs were tested (n= 3) for available fluoride, the amount of fluoride released within 1 minute, pH cytotoxicity, heavy metals, EFU and RDA. Four CDs and 1 NCD contained sodium fluoride (NaF) as the active ingredient whereas two dentifrices contained stannous fluoride (SnF₂; 1 CD and 1 NCD), and two dentifrices contained disodium monofluorophosphate (Na₂FPO₃, or Na₂MFP; 1 CD and 1 NCD). Available samples were homogenized and diluted to 1-in-100 in deionized water (DIW). Release samples were prepared as 1-in-4 homogenized dilutions by mass in DIW. Available and release samples were measured in triplicate (n= 3) via fluoride ion-selective electrode (F-ISE) and ion chromatography (IC). ANSI/ADA 130 was followed for pH. L929 cells were cultured using the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assay and ISO 10993-5 Annex C MTT cytotoxicity test. Heavy metals testing was performed using a hydrofluoric acid digestion sample preparation method followed by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) detection. EFU was performed on enamel specimens that underwent treatment with a CD slurry (1-in-4 dilution) following Test Method #40 of FDA Monograph 21. RDA was performed following ISO 11609 Annex A and the Hefferren method. Data was analyzed using one-way ANOVA followed by post-hoc tests (α= 0.05). RESULTS: Available fluoride for all nine dentifrices was between ~93-102% of the labeled amount. The amount of fluoride released after 1 minute of homogenous mixing ranged between 75-107% of the labeled amount. The pH values of the nine dentifrices ranged from 6.5 to 7.7. Charcoal did not significantly contribute to cytotoxicity in L929 cells. The concentrations of each heavy metal (Hg, Cd, As and Pb) present in each of the nine dentifrices were < 1 ppm, indicating trace amounts. The CDs were not significantly more abrasive than the NCDs. The SnF₂ CD had the highest EFU value (644.2 ±131.7 ppm) followed by the NaF CD and the Na₂MFP CD at 492.2± 69.5 ppm and 140.1± 28.1 ppm, respectively. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Charcoal-containing dentifrices were not found to be significantly more abrasive or cytotoxic than non-charcoal-containing dentifrices. Charcoal and non-charcoal-containing dentifrices were also found to be comparable through experiments determining their fluoride content, pH, enamel fluoride uptake and heavy metals.",

Gene expression of inflammatory cytokines in THP-1 cells were evaluated through RT-PCR by ΔΔCt method using IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, and TNF genes primers. Finally, antioxidant assay was carried out with DPPH radical scavenging method. TCEE had a LD50 of 592.5 µg/mL and did not induce pro-inflammatory gene expression in THP-1 cells after 6 h of treatment. Lastly, TCEE (AA% of 69.4 ± 1.4%) and CEE (AA% of 63.0 ± 0.9%) showed moderate antioxidant activity.

Dielectric barrier discharge low-temperature plasma (DLTP) is a technology that transforms gases into highly excited states, utilizing high-energy particles for enhanced energy applications. This study investigated the effects of DLTP on the electrochemical performance of bamboo charcoal (BC), utilizing bamboo shavings (BS) as the carbon source. The results indicated that the specific capacitance of BC varied under different atmospheric conditions, input voltages, and treatment durations, thereby achieving a maximum increase of 144 F/g. Furthermore, when combined with KOH activation, DLTP modification further enhanced the specific capacitance of BC to 237 F/g. The DLTP treatment enhanced the specific surface area and the types of functional groups in BC, thereby leading to a significant enhancement of its electrochemical properties.",

The resultant biomass charcoal was then subjected to hydrothermal treatment with FeCl3·6H2O to produce biochar/iron oxide composites. The adsorption capabilities of these composites towards methylene blue (MB) were examined under various conditions, including pH (ranging from 3 to 12), temperature variations, and initial MB concentrations (ranging from 50 to 400 mg L-1). The adsorption behavior aligned with the Langmuir model and demonstrated quasi-secondary kinetics. After five adsorption cycles, the capacity decreased from 618.64 mg g-1 to 497.18 mg g-1, indicating considerable stability. Notably, Fe3O4-N-BC exhibited exceptional MB adsorption performance."

The compound is in Phase 3 development for the treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus. Its pharmacokinetic properties are characterized by slow absorption and multiphasic elimination with a long terminal half-life (t½), potentially caused by enterohepatic circulation (EHC). In this trial in healthy participants, oral cenerimod 0.5 and 4 mg once daily was administered for 50 days, followed by oral administration of activated charcoal (ie, 50 mg every 12 h for 11 days, starting 24 h after the last cenerimod dose), to investigate the potential EHC of cenerimod and assess whether elimination of cenerimod can be accelerated. The multiple-dose pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, safety, and tolerability of cenerimod were also evaluated. For both doses, peak plasma concentrations were reached 6 and 7 h after dosing. Cenerimod accumulated approximately eightfold and (near) steady-state conditions were reached after 50 doses, resembling clinically meaningful exposure to cenerimod. The t½ following 0.5 and 4 mg of cenerimod was 767 and 799 h (ie, 32 and 33 days) and 720 and 780 h (ie, 30 and 33 days) with or without administration of charcoal, respectively, indicating no statistically significant difference. Therefore, charcoal did not accelerate cenerimod elimination suggesting that there is no EHC of cenerimod. A reversible, dose-dependent decrease in total lymphocyte count was observed. No safety concerns were identified; administration of charcoal was well tolerated.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Soil contamination by heavy metals is a critical environmental challenge, with Pb being of particular concern due to its propensity to be readily absorbed and accumulated by plants, despite its lack of essential biological functions or beneficial roles in cellular metabolism. Within the scope of phytoremediation, the use of plants for the decontamination of various environmental matrices, the present study investigated the potential of activated charcoal (AC) to enhance the tolerance and mitigation capacity of S. sesban seedlings when exposed to Pb. The experiment was conducted as a factorial arrangement in a completely randomized design in hydroponic conditions. The S. sesban seedlings were subjected to a gradient of Pb concentrations (0, 0.02, 0.2, 2, and 10 mg/L) within the nutrient solution, alongside two distinct AC treatments (0 and 1% inclusion in the culture media). The study reached its conclusion after 60 days. RESULTS: The seedlings exposed to Pb without AC supplementation indicated an escalation in peroxidase (POX) activity, reactive oxygen species (ROS), and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels, signaling an increase in oxidative stress. Conversely, the incorporation of AC into the treatment regime markedly bolstered the antioxidative defense system, as evidenced by the significant elevation in antioxidant capacity and a concomitant reduction in the biomarkers of oxidative stress (POX, ROS, and MDA). CONCLUSIONS: With AC application, a notable improvement was observed in the chlorophyll a, total chlorophyll, and plant fresh and dry biomass. These findings illuminate the role of activated charcoal as a viable adjunct in phytoremediation strategies aimed at ameliorating heavy metal stress in plants.",

Furthermore, vinasse, a wastewater from ethanol production, needs treatment to be reused in the sugarcane industry, reducing industrial water consumption. This study performed vinasse filtration with charcoal from industrial sugarcane residues and used filtered molasses dilution in ethanolic fermentation. There were five treatments in randomized blocks with three repetitions. The treatments included deionized water and natural vinasse as positive and negative controls, respectively, and filtered vinasse from charcoal made from bamboo, sugarcane bagasse, and straw. Hence, fermentation for ethanol production was performed. Compared with natural vinasse, filtered vinasse with all types of charcoal showed lower soluble solids, total residual reducing sugars, higher ethanol concentrations, and greater fermentative efficiency. Filtered vinasse from bagasse and straw charcoals had efficiencies of 81.14% and 77.98%, respectively, in terms of ethanol production, which are close to those of deionized water (81.49%). In a hypothetical industry, vinasse charcoal filtration and charcoal regeneration should prevent 84.12% of water consumption from environmental resources. This process is feasible because it uses a product of sugarcane residue to treat wastewater and reduce industrial water consumption and vinasse disposal.",

      "abstract": "The primary controls for charcoal rot in soybean, caused by the fungal pathogen Macrophomina phaseolina, are to avoid drought stress and to plant a moderately resistant cultivar. The effects of irrigation and cultivar were determined in 2011 and 2013 at the Lon Mann Cotton Research Station, Marianna, AR. Four soybean cultivars (Hutcheson, Osage, Ozark, and R01581F) were planted in plots with or without added M. phaseolina inoculum and subjected to three furrow irrigation regimes: full-season irrigation (Full), irrigation terminated at R5 (CutR5), and nonirrigated (NonIrr). Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) was measured at R3 and R6. At harvest, plants and yields were collected. Roots and stems were split and the extent of visible colonization by M. phaseolina microsclerotia was assessed in the roots with a 1 to 5 scale (RSS) and the percent plant height stem discoloration measured. Precipitation in September and October was 54 and 65% below the 30-year average in 2011 and 2013, respectively. The CutR5 irrigation treatment resulted in one less irrigation than Full each year, but CutR5 NDVIs at R6 and yields were significantly lower than those with Full and not significantly different from those of NonIrr. The CutR5 RSS ratings were greater than either Full or NonIrr. Plant colonization by M. phaseolina was negatively correlated to yield in 2011 but not in 2013. No premature plant death caused by charcoal rot was observed in either year. These results indicated that late-season drought stress may be more important to charcoal rot development than drought stress throughout the season, but other factors are needed to trigger early plant death and subsequent yield losses observed in grower fields.",

A 79-year-old man was admitted to the Emergency Department due to anuria for 2 days. An urgent laboratory examination revealed a serum creatinine concentration of 888 µmol/L. He was diagnosed with acute exacerbation of chronic renal insufficiency. During continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT), the coagulation test showed a severe reduction in the fibrinogen level as well as a significantly prolonged prothrombin time (PT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT). The patient had been taking DE (110 mg twice daily) for a long time and had not suspended the medication or reduced the dose during the worsening of anuria. Therefore, it should be evaluated before considering plasma replacement therapy for the patient, whether the abnormal coagulation parameters were induced by interference of excessive DE. Tentatively, we used activated charcoal to treat the plasma and then retested the fibrinogen, PT, and APTT. Results showed that the coagulation indices nearly returned to normal. The present case indicated that activated charcoal could adsorb DE in plasma effectively and eliminate its interference with coagulation test results, thereby providing support for clinical diagnosis and treatment.",

The prepared FeAl-LDH@FeSx-N-BC composite exhibited excellent photocatalytic performance, attributed to the enhanced photogenerated charge-carrier separation by the etched LDH and the improved comparative surface areas by the doped N-BC. The composite photocatalytically degraded 96 % of PABA. The performance was affected by solute concentration, pH and photocatalyst dose. Adding p-benzoquinone and EDTA-2Na significantly decreased the degradation rate, suggesting that superoxide radicals and holes were co-involved in PABA degradation. The excellent PABA removal efficiency was consistent for three consecutive runs. The samples' reactive oxygen species was confirmed, as electron paramagnetic reverberation explained the photodegradation mechanism. Under xenon lamp irradiation, two PABA photocatalytic degradation pathways were proposed using Liquid Chromatograph Mass Spectrometer (LCMS) and density functional theory. As expected, FeAl-LDH@FeSx-N-BC showed excellent photocatalytic performance, expanding a new direction and possibility for future photocatalytic treatment of water pollutants."

      "abstract": "Due to the development of industries such as mining, smelting, industrial electroplating, tanning, and mechanical manufacturing, heavy metals were discharged into water bodies seriously affecting water quality. Bamboo charcoal, as an environmentally friendly new adsorbent material, in this paper, the virgin bamboo charcoal (denoted as WBC) was modified with different concentrations of KMnO4 and NaOH to obtain KMnO4-modified bamboo charcoal (KBC) and NaOH-modified bamboo charcoal (NBC) which was used to disposed of water bodies containing Cu2+ and Zn2+. The main conclusions were as following: The adsorption of Cu2+ by WBC, KBC and NBC was significantly affected by pH value, and the optimum pH was 5.0. Differently, the acidity and alkalinity of the solution doesn't effect the adsorption of Zn2+ seriousely. Meanwhile, surface diffusion and pore diffusion jointly determine the adsorption rate of Cu2+ and Zn2+. The test result of EDS showed that Mn-O groups formed on the surface of K6 (WBC treated by 0.06 mol/L KMnO4) can promote the adsorption of Cu2+ and Zn2+ at a great degree. The O content on N6(WBC treated by 6 mol/L NaOH) surface increased by 30.95% compared with WBC. It is speculated that the increase of carbonyl group on the surface of NBC is one of the reasons for the improvement of Cu2+ and Zn2+ adsorption capacity. Finally, the residual concentrations of Cu2+ and Zn2+ in wastewater are much lower than 0.5 mg/L and 1.0 mg/L, respectively. Thus it can be seen, KBC and NBC could be a promising adsorbent for heavy metals.",

      "abstract": "Charcoal rot disease (CRD), caused by the phytopathogenic fungus Macrophomina phaseolina, is a significant threat to cotton production in Israel and worldwide. The pathogen secretes toxins and degrading enzymes that disrupt the water and nutrient uptake, leading to death at the late stages of growth. While many control strategies were tested over the years to reduce CRD impact, reaching that goal remains a significant challenge. The current study aimed to establish, improve, and deepen our understanding of a new approach combining biological agents and chemical pesticides. Such intervention relies on reducing fungicides while providing stability and a head start to eco-friendly bio-protective Trichoderma species. The research design included sprouts in a growth room and commercial field plants receiving the same treatments. Under a controlled environment, comparing the bio-based coating treatments with their corresponding chemical coating partners resulted in similar outcomes in most measures. At 52 days, these practices gained up to 38% and 45% higher root and shoot weight and up to 78% decreased pathogen root infection (tracked by Real-Time PCR), compared to non-infected control plants. Yet, in the shoot weight assessment (day 29 post-sowing), the treatment with only biological seed coating outperformed (p < 0.05) all other biological-based treatments and all Azoxystrobin-based irrigation treatments. In contrast, adverse effects are observed in the chemical seed coating group, particularly in above ground plant parts, which are attributable to the addition of Azoxystrobin irrigation. In the field, the biological treatments had the same impact as the chemical intervention, increasing the cotton plants' yield (up to 17%), improving the health (up to 27%) and reducing M. phaseolina DNA in the roots (up to 37%). When considering all treatments within each approach, a significant benefit to plant health was observed with the bio-chemo integrated management compared to using only chemical interventions. Specific integrated treatments have shown potential in reducing CRD symptoms, such as applying bio-coating and sprinkling Azoxystrobin during sowing. Aerial remote sensing based on high-resolution visible-channel (RGB), green-red vegetation index (GRVI), and thermal imaging supported the above findings and proved its value for studying CRD control management. This research validates the combined biological and chemical intervention potential to shield cotton crops from CRD."

      "abstract": "Environmental pollution and poor feed quality pose potential threats to aquatic organisms and human health, representing challenges for the aquaculture industry. In light of the rising demand for aquatic organisms, there is an urgent need to improve aquacultural production and protect the products from contamination. Char, a carbonaceous material derived through pyrolysis of organic carbon-rich biomass, has proven advantages in soil, air, and water remediation. While char's performance and the associated physicochemical characteristics depend strongly on the pyrolysis temperature, residence time, and feedstock type, char generally shows advantages in pollutant removal from the environment and livestock. This enables it to enhance the health and growth performance of livestock. Given the growing attention to char application in aquaculture in recent years, this review summarises major studies on three applications: aquacultural water treatment, sediment remediation, and char-feed supplement. Most of these studies have demonstrated char's positive effects on pollutant removal from organisms and aquacultural environments. Moreover, adopting char as fish feed can improve fish growth performance and the condition of their intestinal villi. However, due to insufficient literature, further investigation is needed into the mechanistic aspects of pollutants removal in aquatic organisms by char as a feed additive, such as the transportation of char inside aquatic organisms, the positive and negative effects of char on these products, and how char alters the gut microbiota community of these products. This paper presents an overview of the current application of char in aquaculture and highlights the research areas that require further investigation to enrich future studies.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The adsorption of activated charcoal is currently a major clinical treatment for acute organophosphorus pesticide poisoning (AOPP). However, the adsorption duration and efficiency of this method is unstable. OBJECTIVE: In this study, a hydrogel embedding activated charcoal was prepared and its alleviating effects on AOPP were investigated. METHODS: A composite hydrogel using sodium alginate and polyvinyl alcohol (SA-PVA) hydrogel was prepared in this study. The structural properties of the SA-PVA hydrogel were characterized via multiple analysis including FTIR, TGA, XRD, SEM, tensile strength and expansion rate. Based on these, activated charcoal (AC) was embedded within the SA-PVA hydrogel (SA-PVA-AC) and it was used for the treatment of AOPP. RESULTS: Structural characterization indicated SA-PVA hydrogel possesses excellent mechanical properties and biocompatibility. The in vivo study demonstrated that SA-PVA-AC significantly alleviated the inflammation and oxidative damage in the liver, as evidenced by reduced levels of IL-6, TNF-α, and, IL-1β, SOD, and MDA. Furthermore, SA-PVA-AC treatment effectively re-regulated the activities of serum AST and ALT, exhibiting an improved effect on liver function. CONCLUSION: The findings suggest that activated charcoal embedded within SA-PVA hydrogel has significant potential as a therapeutic agent in treating AOPP, and offering a novel approach to managing pesticide-induced toxicity.",

MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 60 healthy bovine incisor teeth were used and divided into: G1 (regular non-whitening toothpaste), G2 (conventional whitening toothpaste), G3 (activated charcoal based whitening toothpaste) and G4 (10% carbamide peroxide gel - PC10). Groups G1, G2 and G3 underwent simulated toothbrushing for 14 days, while G4 received bleaching treatment for the same time. The readings of MH, Ra and colorimetry were performed before any intervention (T0 - baseline) and at the end of 14 days of the proposed treatments (T1). After confirming the normality of the data, the results of MH, Ra and colorimetry were subjected to 2-factor ANOVA for repeated measures (α = 5%). RESULTS: For MH, there were no statistical differences in G1, G2 and G3, only in G4. Considering Ra, a significant increase was observed in G2 and G3, with no statistical differences found in the other groups. Regarding colorimetry, the average color difference (ΔE) was greater in the G4 group (11.30 ± 4.31), even compared to the groups submitted to the whitening dentifrices: G2 (5.13 ± 2.75) and G3 (5.86 ± 3.66). CONCLUSIONS: It was concluded that the use of a whitening toothpaste containing activated charcoal caused deleterious effects on the enamel Ra, but did not affect the microhardness of the substrate, besides promoting a color change inferior to the regular non-bleaching toothpaste or PC10 gel.

It is highly desirable to prevent campylobacteriosis in individuals at risk for severe disease with antibiotics-independent non-toxic compounds. Activated charcoal (AC) has long been used as an anti-diarrheal remedy. Here, we tested the disease-mitigating effects of oral AC versus placebo in human gut microbiota-associated (hma) IL-10-/- mice starting a week prior to C. jejuni infection. On day 6 post-infection, the gastrointestinal C. jejuni loads were comparable in both infected cohorts, whereas campylobacteriosis symptoms such as wasting and bloody diarrhea were mitigated upon AC prophylaxis. Furthermore, AC application resulted in less pronounced C. jejuni-induced colonic epithelial cell apoptosis and in dampened innate and adaptive immune cell responses in the colon that were accompanied by basal concentrations of pro-inflammatory mediators including IL-6, TNF-α, IFN-γ, and nitric oxide measured in colonic explants from AC treated mice on day 6 post-infection. Furthermore, C. jejuni infection resulted in distinct fecal microbiota shift towards higher enterobacterial numbers and lower loads of obligate anaerobic species in hma mice that were AC-independent. In conclusion, our pre-clinical placebo-controlled intervention study provides evidence that prophylactic oral AC application mitigates acute murine campylobacteriosis.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is closely linked to metabolic syndrome, characterised by insulin resistance, hyperglycaemia, abnormal lipid metabolism, and chronic inflammation. Diabetic ulcers (DUs) comprise consequential complications that arise as a result of T2DM. To investigate, db/db mice were used for the disease model. The findings demonstrated that a scaffold made from a combination of rhubarb charcoal-crosslinked chitosan and silk fibroin, designated as RCS/SF, was able to improve the healing process of diabetic wounds in db/db mice. However, previous studies have primarily concentrated on investigating the impacts of the RSC/SF scaffold on wound healing only, while its influence on the entire body has not been fully elucidated. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The silk fibroin/chitosan sponge scaffold containing rhubarb charcoal was fabricated in the present study using a freeze-drying approach. Subsequently, an incision with a diameter of 8 mm was made on the dorsal skin of the mice, and the RCS/SF scaffold was applied directly to the wound for 14 days. Subsequently, the impact of RCS/SF scaffold therapy on hepatic lipid metabolism was assessed through analysis of serum and liver biochemistry, histopathology, quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR), immunohistochemistry, and Western blotting. RESULTS: The use of the RCS/SF scaffold led to an enhancement in the conditions associated with serum glucolipid metabolism in db/db mice. An assessment of hepatic histopathology further confirmed this enhancement. Additionally, the qRT-PCR analysis revealed that treatment with RCS/SF scaffold resulted in the downregulation of genes associated with fatty acid synthesis, fatty acid uptake, triglyceride (TG) synthesis, gluconeogenesis, and inflammatory factors. Moreover, the beneficial effect of the RCS/SF scaffold on oxidative stress was shown by assessing antioxidant enzymes and lipid peroxidation. Additionally, the network pharmacology analysis verified that the adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signalling pathway had a vital function in mitigating non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) by utilizing R. officinale. The measurement of AMPK, sterol regulatory element binding protein 1 (SREBP1), fatty acid synthase (FASN), and acetyl CoA carboxylase (ACC) gene and protein expression provided support for this discovery. Furthermore, the molecular docking investigations revealed a robust affinity between the active components of rhubarb and the downstream targets of AMPK (SREBP1 and FASN). CONCLUSION: By regulating the AMPK signalling pathway, the RCS/SF scaffold applied topically effectively mitigated hepatic lipid accumulation, decreased inflammation, and attenuated oxidative stress. The present study, therefore, emphasises the crucial role of the topical RCS/SF scaffold in regulating hepatic lipid metabolism, thereby confirming the concept of \"external and internal reshaping\".",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: This randomized controlled clinical trial evaluated the whitening efficacy, tooth sensitivity (TS), and volunteers' satisfaction following the use of activated charcoal powder and toothpaste. METHODS: Fifty-six volunteers were randomly allocated into 4 groups (n = 14) according to a 14-day toothbrushing or whitening treatment with activated charcoal powder (ACPW), activated charcoal toothpaste (ACT), regular fluoridated toothpaste (RT), and 10 % carbamide peroxide (CP). Objective (ΔE00) and subjective (ΔSGU) color and whiteness index (ΔWID) changes were calculated. Patients self-reported the risk and intensity of TS using a visual analogue scale and the volunteer's satisfaction was determined by a questionnaire. Color assessments were analyzed by Kruskal-Wallis followed by Dwas-Steel-Crithlow-Fligner, and absolute TS risk and volunteer's satisfaction by Fisher exact test (p < 0.05). RESULTS: ACPW and ACT promoted similar effects in ΔE00, ΔSGU, and ΔWID to that observed for RT. No significant difference was found in terms of TS risk intensity. TS risk became high after 7 and 14 days, with higher TS prevalence in CP. Volunteers reported that ACPW exhibited the lowest ease-of-use, comfort, and whitening satisfaction among groups (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Activated charcoal-based products presented a minor and unsatisfactory whitening effect while CP resulted in optimal tooth whitening and the highest level of satisfaction among volunteers. Risk was higher from 7 days onwards and was more pronounced in the CP. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Based on the whitening effect and patient satisfaction, this controlled-randomized clinical evidence supports that the use of activated charcoal-based products should be discouraged.",

As a new method of sludge disposal, sludge carbonization is characterized by low energy consumption, simple products, and wide resource utilization prospects, which is of great help to solve problems of current sludge disposal in China. The residual sludge from sewage plant was used as raw material in this study in order to investigate the physical and chemical properties of sludge charcoal after high temperature carbonization and explore the enhancement in the removal of pollutants including CODcr, NH3-N, TN, and TP during sewage treatment with the used sludge charcoal. The results show that the optimal dosing amount of sludge charcoal was 2 g.L-1 when it was added into SBR equipment at one time, while the optimal dosing amount is 0.06 g.L-1 when it was added into SBR equipment with each influent process. The enhanced removal effect of pollutants in sewage treatment process mainly depended on the physical adsorption and intensified bio-degradation of sludge charcoal, and activated sludge and sludge charcoal were synergistic in water treatment. The removal effect of pollutants is strengthened in the physical adsorption-bio-degradation-sludge charcoal reproduction-re-adsorption system. These suggested that sludge charcoal could be promising for the enhancement of pollutant removal in sewage through activated sludge process.",

Eighty-two patients with ESRD on regular hemodialysis were enrolled, with 15 patients receiving oral supplementation with activated charcoal in addition to standard care and 13 patients receiving only standard care. Blood samples were collected at baseline and after eight weeks, and several biomarkers were measured, including estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), creatinine, urea, phosphorus, albumin, and indoxyl sulfate. The results showed a significant reduction in both serum urea and serum phosphorus levels after eight weeks of oral-activated charcoal treatment. However, the other biomarkers were not affected by the treatment. In conclusion, the use of oral-activated charcoal for eight weeks in Iraqi patients undergoing maintenance hemodialysis improved urea and phosphorus levels.",

Furthermore, the absence of a paraquatemia assay cannot constitute a limitation for management, and hemoperfusion on an inaccessible charcoal column can be replaced by an HD usually available.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: To evaluate if tooth color alteration of activated charcoal-based dentifrices may be attributed to the dye adsorption potential of charcoal (chemical action - C - slurry only) or to the association of dye adsorption with abrasion (chemo-mechanical action - CM- slurry/toothbrushing). Potential adverse effects in surface roughness, gloss, and wear were also assessed. METHODS: Bovine enamel/dentin specimens were randomly allocated into the groups according to treatments and test model (n = 15): deionized water (negative control- NC); Colgate Maximum Anticaries Protection (conventional toothpaste- positive control- PC); Colgate Luminous White Activated Charcoal (LW); Oral-B 3D White Therapy Charcoal (WT); Curaprox Black is White (BW); Dermavita Whitemax (Activated charcoal powder- WP). Specimens were exposed to the C or CM models, in 28-day staining-treatment cycling. Color change (ΔE00), whiteness index (ΔWID), percentage of alteration of surface roughness (%Raalt), and gloss (%GUalt) were calculated. Additional specimens (n = 9) were indented with a Knoop diamond and subjected to 100,000 abrasion cycles. Enamel wear was determined by calculating the decrease in indentations geometry. Data were analyzed by ANOVA/Tukey tests (α = 0.05). RESULTS: The CM-model produced lower color change (staining) than C (p = 0.0001). PC, LW, WT, BW, and WP showed similar color results for both models, differing from NC (p < 0.05).%Ra and%GU did not differ among the C-model groups (p > 0.05) and WP exhibited the highest variation (%Ra and%GU) under CM-model. Enamel wear values were lowest in the NC and PC groups, intermediate for LW, WT, BW, and highest for the WP (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Activated charcoal-based dentifrices have a similar ability to minimize tooth staining as the conventional toothpaste, with increased enamel wear potential in the long term (after 100,000 cycles). The activated charcoal powder damaged the enamel surface, showing a higher deleterious effect on enamel roughness, gloss, and wear. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Dentifrices containing activated charcoal do not provide superior results to minimize tooth staining compared to conventional toothpaste. Charcoal powder should be used with caution because it promotes higher superficial alterations on the enamel surface.",

      "abstract": "Macrophomina phaseolina (Tassi) Goid. is a soilborne necrotrophic fungal pathogen causing charcoal rot on approximately 500 plant species worldwide (Mengistu et al. 2015). Charcoal rot occurs in eastern Canada and many regions of the USA, causing substantial yield losses in soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] (Allen et al. 2017; Bradley et al. 2021; Wrather et al. 2001). However, it has not been reported in soybean in western Canada. Manitoba is the second largest soybean producer in Canada, comprising 31% of total seeded areas with 2.29 M acres in 2017 (Statistics Canada 2022). Still, soybean is a relatively new crop to Manitoba and annual surveys of soybean root diseases began in 2012. In August 2020, randomly selected soybean fields were surveyed for root diseases at 63 different locations in south-central and southwest Manitoba. A total of thirty diseased plants were sampled in a zigzag pattern at three random sites in each field and all samples were brought to the laboratory and rated for disease severity. All plants showed symptoms of root rot, and some samples exhibited wilting with yellowing-brown leaves attached to the stems by the petioles; when the taproot was sectioned longitudinally, black streaking could be observed. In the laboratory, 600 roots from 40 selected fields were processed for pathogen isolation and identification. A 1 cm section from each root was surface-sterilized in a 95% EtOH:5.25% NaOCl solution for 30 sec, rinsed in sterile water for 60 sec, and air-dried on sterilized filter paper in a laminar flow hood. Root tissues with two replicates were placed on potato dextrose agar (PDA) plates amended with streptomycin sulfate (2 mg/mL) and incubated at room temperature. Black microsclerotia were observed in cultures from three different fields and three individual fungal isolates were obtained from each field through isolation of a single microsclerotium and subsequent hyphal tip transfer. The mycelia were initially hyaline and turned gray to dark brown or black, forming numerous microsclerotia ranging in size from 13 to 61 µm long and 12 to 32 µm wide, based on measurements of approximately 100 microsclerotia per isolate using a Zeiss Axio Imager A2 microscope equipped with an AxioCam HRc (Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany) and AxioVision software. The color of the microsclerotia was jet black and the shape was round to oblong or irregular, as described by Mengistu et al. (2015). Based on morphological characteristics and microscopic examination, three fungal isolates were identified as M. phaseolina (Mengistu et al. 2015). For molecular identification, genomic DNA was extracted from 10 to 14-day old mycelia and microsclerotia of each isolate using a ZymoBIOMICS™ DNA Miniprep Kit (Zymo Research Corp., Irvine, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region, translation elongation factor-1α (TEF-1α), and calmodulin (CAL) genes were amplified using the primer sets ITS1/ITS4 (White et al. 1990), MpTefF/MpTefR, and MpCalF/MpCalR (Santos et al. 2020), respectively, according to the original reaction conditions. Subsequently, PCR products were sequenced at Eurofins Genomics (Louisville, KY, USA). BLASTn analysis in GenBank showed that the nucleotide sequences of these regions of the three isolates (NSRR20-MB-24, NSRR20-MB-34, and NSRR20-MB-40) matched multiple isolates of M. phaseolina with 100% query cover and 100% identity. Sequences were deposited in GenBank for the ITS (OK127887, OK142725, OK128266), TEF-1α (OR363103, OR363104, OR363105), and CAL (OR357627, OR357628, OR357629) regions. In addition, the ITS and TEF-1α sequences of the three novel isolates were further aligned with multiple previously reported isolates of M. phaseolina, M. pseudophaseolina, and M. euphorbiicola (Chen et al. 2013; Machado et al. 2019; Sarr et al. 2014) using Muscle and trimmed (Edgar 2004). Alignments were concatenated to generate a maximum likelihood tree. Once concatenated, sequences were re-aligned. The obtained alignments were employed to construct a phylogenetic tree using the max likelihood method and Tamura-Nei model (Tamura and Nei 1993) with 10,000 bootstrap replicates using MEGA 11 (Tamura et al. 2021). The ITS and TEF-1α analysis indicated that the isolates were grouped in three differentiated clades (Figure 1). Macrophomina phaseolina isolates clustered in the same clade at 98% similarity, with the three novel soybean isolates NSRR20-MB-24, NSRR20-MB-34, and NSRR20-MB-40 grouped closely in the cluster at 98% similarity and identified as M. phaseolina. In contrast, isolates of M. euphorbiicola formed another clade at 87% similarity and M. pseudophaseolina isolates grouped in a clade at 99%. The pathogenicity of the three isolates was evaluated under controlled conditions. Given that no information on charcoal rot resistance in soybean has been reported in Canada, one of the commonly grown varieties in Manitoba, \"TH 32004\", was selected for the pathogenicity test. Surface-sterilized soybean seeds, which had been pre-germinated for three days, were sown in a sterilized soilless growing mix (Sunshine #5) together with 5 g (approx. 1 × 105 microsclerotia) of macerated 10 to 14-day old inoculum grown on PDA-streptomycin agar medium at room temperature and applied using an inoculum layering technique. For the non-inoculated control, macerated PDA-streptomycin agar without mycelia was used. Twenty plants per treatment were maintained in a walk-in plant growth chamber with a 16 h photoperiod at 25/20 °C ± 1 °C (day/night) and 50% relative humidity. Plants were watered weekly but were subjected to water stress. Symptoms of charcoal rot were observed in the root systems of all inoculated soybean plants after 28 days, while no symptoms were observed in the control plants (Figure S1). There was production of microsclerotia on the roots inoculated with each isolate (data not shown). Three isolates of M. phaseolina were re-isolated from the inoculated plants and found to be identical to the inoculated isolates with respect to morphological characteristics in culture, as well as with respect to the ITS, TEF-1α and CAL DNA sequences. For each isolate and non-inoculated control, five seeds of 'TH 32004' were seeded per pot, and four pots were used for the inoculated and control treatments. The experiment was repeated twice in a randomized complete block design with similar results, fulfilling Koch's postulates. To our knowledge, this is the first report of charcoal rot caused by M. phaseolina on soybean in Manitoba, Canada."

METHODS: Fifty-six participants were divided into 4 experimental groups (n = 14). Activated charcoal-based powder (PW); Activated charcoal-based dentifrice (AC); Conventional fluoride toothpaste (CD) and 10 % carbamide peroxide (CP). All products were used for 14 days. Psychosocial impact on dental esthetics (PIDAQ), oral health impact profile (OHIP- Esthetics) and orofacial esthetics scale (OES) questionnaires were applied before and after treatment. Descriptive and exploratory data analyses were performed and analyzed using linear mixed models for repeated measures over time considering significance level of α = 0.05. RESULTS: For PIDAQ, the CP group showed significant decrease in psychological impact, aesthetic perception domains and overall score, while in the PW group, there was only a significant decrease in the psychological impact domain. Decrease in OHIP was observed for the functional limitation domain scores for treatments with CP and PW, in the psychological discomfort domain, decrease was observed for all groups, while for the OES questionnaire, significant increase in the color domain was observed for the CP group. CONCLUSION: Activated charcoal-based products showed lower scores in all questionnaires when compared with carbamide peroxide; thus, charcoal-based products promoted lower impact on quality of life and aesthetic perception. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: In this randomized clinical trial, charcoal-based OTC products had inferior quality of life and aesthetic perception results compared to conventional carbamide peroxide bleaching.",

      "abstract": "The fungus Macrophomina phaseolina causes charcoal rot disease (CRD) in cotton, whose symptoms develop in the late stages of growth and result in wilting and death. Despite significant research efforts to reduce disease incidences, effective control strategies against M. phaseolina are an ongoing scientific effort. Today's CRD control tends toward green options to reduce the chemicals' environmental footprint and health risks. Here, different Trichoderma species were examined separately and in combination with Azoxystrobin (AS) in semi-field open-enclosure pots and a commercial field throughout a full season. In the pot experiment, the T. asperellum (P1) excelled and led to improvement in growth (13%-14%, day 69) and crops (the number of capsules by 36% and their weight by 78%, day 173). The chemical treatment alone at a low dose had no significant impact. Still, adding AS improved the effect of T. longibrachiatum (T7507) and impaired P1 efficiency. Real-time PCR monitoring of the pathogen DNA in the plants' roots at the harvest (day 176), revealed the efficiency of the combined treatments: T. longibrachiatum (T7407 and T7507) + AS. In a commercial field, seed dressing with a mixture of Trichoderma species (mix of P1, T7407, and Trichoderma sp. O.Y. 7107 isolate) and irrigation of their secreted metabolites during seeding resulted in the highest yields compared with the control. Applying only AS irrigation at a low dose (2,000 cc/ha), with the sowing, was the second best in promoting crops. The molecular M. phaseolina detection showed that the AS at a high dose (4,000 cc/ha) and the biological mix treatments were the most effective. Reducing the AS chemical treatment dosages by half impaired its effectiveness. Irrigation timing, also studied here, is proven vital. Early water opening during the late spring suppresses the disease outburst and damages. The results demonstrated the benefits of CRD bio-shielding and encouraged to explore the potential of a combined bio-chemo pest control approach. Such interphase can be environmentally friendly (reducing chemical substances), stabilize the biological treatment in changing environmental conditions, achieve high efficiency even in severe CRD cases, and reduce the development of fungicide resistance."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are increasingly prescribed for the prevention and treatment of thrombosis. However, DOACs are associated with extensive interference in coagulation assays. Herein, we evaluate raw activated charcoal (AC) as an adsorbent material, to minimise DOAC-associated interferences in routine and specialised coagulation parameters on CS-series analysers (Sysmex, Kobe, Japan). METHODS: Commercial human-derived non-anticoagulated plasma materials, with or without increasing concentrations of anticoagulant, were assayed for routine and specialised coagulation parameters before and after treatment with AC. RESULTS: Treatment of non-anticoagulated plasma with raw AC had minimal impact on routine and specialised coagulation parameters available on the CS-series; however, clinically relevant prolongations of certain activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT)-based assays were observed after treatment. Furthermore, in apixaban- and rivaroxaban-containing plasma material, AC efficiently adsorbed therapeutic and supratherapeutic DOAC concentrations; and, treatment with raw AC resolved DOAC-associated interferences on all affected routine and specialised coagulation parameters. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, raw AC efficiently adsorbed apixaban and rivaroxaban from human-derived plasma, without significantly affecting the majority of underlying routine and specialised coagulation parameters available on CS-series analysers."

      "abstract": "Due to the possible effects of global warming, new materials that do not have a negative impact on the environment are being studied. To serve a variety of industries and outdoor applications, it is necessary to consider the impact of photoluminosity on the performance of biocomposites in order to accurately assess their durability characteristics and prevent substantial damage. Exposure to photoluminosity can result in adverse effects such as discoloration, uneven surface, loss of mass, and manipulation of the intrinsic mechanical properties of biocomposites. This study aims to evaluate general charcoal from three pyrolysis temperatures to understand which charcoal is most suitable for photoluminosity and whether higher pyrolysis temperatures have any significant effect on photoluminosity. Porosity, morphology, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy of charcoal were analyzed. Charcoal obtained at a temperature of 800 °C demonstrates remarkable potential as a bioreinforcement in polymeric matrices, attributable to its significantly higher porosity (81.08%) and hydrophobic properties. The biocomposites were characterized for flexural strength, tensile strength, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), FTIR, and x-ray diffraction (XRD). The results showed an improvement in tensile strength after exposure to photoluminosity, with an increase of 69.24%, 68.98%, and 54.38% at temperatures of 400, 600, and 800 °C, respectively, in relation to the treatment control. It is notorious that the tensile strength and modulus of elasticity after photoluminosity initially had a negative impact on mechanical strength, the incorporation of charcoal from higher pyrolysis temperatures showed a substantial increase in mechanical strength after exposure to photoluminosity, especially at 800 °C with breaking strength of 53.40 MPa, and modulus of elasticity of 4364.30 MPA. Scanning electron microscopy revealed an improvement in morphology, with a decrease in roughness at 800 °C, which led to greater adhesion to the polyester matrix. These findings indicate promising prospects for a new type of biocomposite, particularly in comparison with other polymeric compounds, especially in engineering applications that are subject to direct interactions with the weather."

      "abstract": "Diabetic patients often experience long-term risks due to chronic inflammation and delayed re-epithelialization during impaired wound healing. Although the severity of this condition is well known, the treatment options for diabetic wounds are limited. Rhubarb charcoal, a well-known traditional Chinese medicine, has been used to treat skin wounds for thousands of years. We produced a chitosan/silk fibroin sponge scaffold loaded with natural carbonized rhubarb and crosslinked it by freeze-drying to create a highly efficient RCS/SF scaffold. Rhubarb carbon and carboxymethyl chitosan exhibit antibacterial activity and promote wound healing. Owing to its 3D porous structure, this scaffold is antibacterial and pro-angiogenic. It also possesses remarkable properties, such as excellent swelling and biocompatibility. The supportive effect of carbonized rhubarb on mouse fibroblast migration is mediated at the cellular/tissue level by increased skin neovascularization and re-epithelization. Compared to the control group, RCS/SF scaffolds promoted faster healing, increased neovascularization, enhanced collagen deposition, and re-epithelialization within two weeks. The scaffold's pro-healing properties and efficient release of carbonized rhubarb, with rapid hemostatic and good sterilization effects, make it an outstanding candidate for treating diabetic wounds and novel therapeutic interventions for diabetic ulcers.",

Recent research has also shown its phytotherapeutic potential as an anticancer and neuroprotective agent. These findings, as well as the endangered status of the species in its wild habitats, have motivated the present research on application of plant cell tissue and organ culture for the purposes of both valuable germplasm conservation and secondary metabolites production. Shoot cultures of the plant were initiated from sterile germinated seeds and the effects of activated charcoal (AC), as well benzyl adenine and 1-naphthaleneacetic acid treatments, were experimented. The phenolic profile analysis was performed by HPLC/DAD/MSn. Comparison with samples collected from wild plants in their natural habitat was performed. It was established that in vitro multiplication induced by plant growth regulators (PGRs) was accompanied by a higher impairment of leaf morphology and trichome formation, as well as by the occurrence of plantlet hyperhydricity and callus formation, as compared with the AC treatments. Shoot culture-derived plant material was shown to produce two phenylethanoids and five flavone glycosides, not detected in the wild collected plant material. In addition, the two types of in vitro culture treatments led to the stimulation of either flavone glycosides or phenylethanoids in the in vitro cultivated plants. Thus, AC stimulated, to a higher extent, flavone glycosides' accumulation, leading to an elevated flavone/phenylethanoid ratio, as compared with PGR treatments."

Computed tomography showed significant mottled and infiltrated shadows in the upper lobes of both lungs, and hypersensitivity pneumonitis was suspected. Sputum culture, autoantibodies such as antinuclear antibodies, and other diagnostic tests ruled out other conditions. The patient was treated with antibacterial agents and steroids. Imaging tests showed improvement over time. He was discharged on the seventh day. Charcoal briquette is a rare antigen that can potentially trigger hypersensitivity pneumonitis.

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: A narrow margin between the therapeutic and toxic doses of digoxin can result in an increased incidence of toxicity. Since digoxin has an enterohepatic cycle, multiple oral doses of absorbents like montmorillonite may be useful in the treatment of digoxin toxicity. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this study, 4 groups of 6 rats received intraperitoneal digoxin (1 mg/kg), and half an hour later, distilled water (DW) or oral adsorbents, including montmorillonite (1 g/kg), activated charcoal (1 g/kg) (AC) alone or in combination in the ratio of 70:30. Half of the mentioned doses were also gavaged at 3 and 5.5 hr after digoxin injection. The serum level of digoxin, biochemical factors, and activity score were assessed during the experiment. Three control groups only received DW, montmorillonite, or AC. RESULTS: All adsorbents were able to significantly decrease the serum level of digoxin compared to the digoxin+DW group (P<0.01). Only montmorillonite reversed the digoxin-induced hyperkalemia (P<0.05). Multiple dose administration of adsorbents also significantly reduced the digoxin area under the curve and half-life and increased digoxin clearance (P<0.05). However, there was no significant difference in the kinetic parameters between groups that received digoxin plus adsorbents. CONCLUSION: Multiple-dose of montmorillonite reversed digoxin toxicity and reduced serum digoxin levels by increasing the excretion and reducing the half-life. Montmorillonite has also corrected digoxin-induced hyperkalemia. Based on the findings, a multiple-dose regimen of oral montmorillonite could be a suitable candidate for reducing the toxicity issue associated with drugs like digoxin that undergo some degree of enterohepatic circulation."

      "abstract": "Water pollution has invaded seas, rivers, and tap water worldwide. This work employed commercial Mesquite charcoal as a low-cost precursor for fabricating Mesquite carbon nanoparticles (MUCNPs) using a ball-milling process. The scanning electron energy-dispersive microscopy results for MUCNPs revealed a particle size range of 52.4-75.0 nm. The particles were composed mainly of carbon with trace amounts of aluminum, potassium, calcium, titanium, and zinc. The X-ray diffraction peaks at 26.76 and 43.28 2θ° ascribed to the (002) and (100) planes indicated a crystalized graphite phase. Furthermore, the lack of FT-IR vibrations above 3000 cm-1 showed that the MUCNPs were not functionalized. The MUCNPs' pore diameter, volume, and surface area were 114.5 Ǻ, 0.363 cm3 g-1, and 113.45 m2 g-1. The batch technique was utilized to investigate MUCNPs' effectiveness in removing chlorohexidine gluconate (CHDNG) from water, which took 90 min to achieve equilibrium and had an adsorption capacity of 65.8 mg g-1. The adsorption of CHDNG followed pseudo-second-order kinetics, with the rate-limiting step being diffusion in the liquid film. The Langmuir isotherm dominated the CHDNG adsorption on the MUCNPs with a correlation coefficient of 0.99. The thermodynamic studies revealed that CHDNG adsorption onto the MUCNPs was exothermic and favorable, and its spontaneity increased inversely with CHDNG concentration. The ball-milling-made MUCNPs demonstrated consistent efficiency through regeneration-reuse cycles."

(2022), examines whether the usage of activated charcoal (AC) in current treatment protocols for ingested poisonings adds benefits, given recent controversies in its use. Study variables included clinical findings in relation to the drug being ingested, the frequency and usage of an antidote, the rate of being intubated, and the duration of being hospitalized comparing poisoned patients who received AC with those who did not. APRNs need to be aware of the current guidelines to help establish the appropriateness of use when administering AC and be able to evaluate patients during and after the administering of AC.

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of activated charcoal-based (AC) products on color alteration, remineralizing potential and surface roughness of dental enamel. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Bovine incisors were cut into 6 × 6 × 2 mm fragments. Initial color (EasyShade, Vita) and surface roughness (Surfcorder SE1700, Kosakalab) readings were performed. Fragments were separated into five groups (n = 17) according to the treatment: Control: Fluoride toothpaste (Colgate Total 12, Colgate); Charcoal + NaF: AC toothpaste (ACT) with sodium fluoride (Colgate Natural Extracts, Colgate); Charcoal + MFP + n-HA: ACT with sodium monofluorophosphate and nanohydroxyapatite (Black is White, Curaprox); Charcoal: Fluoride-free ACT (ProActive, Hinode); and Charcoal powder: AC powder. Simulated toothbrushing was performed and final color and surface roughness readings were obtained. Fragments were then polished, and initial microhardness (HMV-2, Shimatzu) readings were done. Samples were artificially demineralized and brushed again. Final microhardness readings were taken. Data were statistically analyzed. RESULTS: Fluoride-free charcoal presented the lowest surface roughness alteration (p < 0.05). Charcoal powder had the lowest color change (p < 0.05) and negative values for whiteness index for dentistry alteration. All the groups presented values below whiteness acceptability threshold and negative relative microhardness values. Control showed the highest remineralizing potential (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: ACPs did not produce color alteration different from the fluoride toothpaste, except for Charcoal powder that caused less color change. ACPs caused surface roughness alteration similar to the fluoride toothpaste. ACT with fluoride and AC powder did not have remineralizing potential. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Activated charcoal-based products (ACP) promise effective tooth whitening and quick results, without teeth damage. In addition, some ACPs contain fluoride in toothpaste composition and promise rehardening potential. However, ACPs are not as effective as other whitening agents and can alter the surface roughness of the enamel. Even if the ACPs contain fluoride or other remineralizing agents, they might be ineffective.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Activated charcoal is a decontaminating agent used for acute intoxication. It can be mixed with taste additives to overcome its poor palatability. Our purpose was to evaluate the taste additives used to improve activated charcoal's palatability. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of comparative studies on taste additives used to improve activated charcoal's palatability. We searched PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane, and CINAHL. We included controlled trials and observational studies that evaluate the effect of at least one taste additive, compared with activated charcoal alone. Our primary outcome was palatability. Our secondary outcomes included treatment adherence, adsorption efficacy, and adverse events. The risk of bias was assessed using the Quality Assessment Tool for Quantitative Studies. RESULTS: Among 38 eligible articles, seven observational studies and three crossover clinical trials met our inclusion criteria. The risk of bias was found to be high for seven studies and intermediate for three others. The preferred flavoring agents were cola and chocolate milk for children, and sweetening agents for adults. All taste additives studied seemed to improve activated charcoal's palatability, except for yogurt (n = 1). The addition of bentonite, sorbitol, carboxymethylcellulose, or yogurt showed no impact on the in-vivo adsorption capacity of activated charcoal, whereas the results were inconclusive for chocolate. No meta-analysis was performed due to insufficient data. CONCLUSION: Strategies to improve activated charcoal's palatability seem to enhance the taste. Descriptive data are in favor of a limited impact on activated charcoal's adsorption capacity when adding binding agents or sweeteners.

The ingestion of large quantities of it has aroused our interest in the presence of metals impurities. Therefore, the present study aimed to assess trace elements in activated charcoal products. Multielement analysis were performed using Inductively Coupled Plasma-Mass Spectrometry after digestion. Estimated daily Intake was calculated and compared to references doses for each element. Varying trace elements have been found: chromium (0.3383 ± 0.089 µg g-1), cadmium (0.5991 ± 0.2967 µg g-1), aluminum (0.7033 ± 0.1215 µg g-1), nickel (0.0111 ± 0.003 µg g-1), lead (0.0052 ± 0.0021 µg g-1), zinc (0.0414 ± 0.0076 µg g-1), and manganese (0.0036 ± 0.0006 µg g-1). when 50 g of activated charcoal is consumed by a 70 kg adult, aluminum estimated daily intake is 0.0005 mg/kg bw/day which exceeds the reference dose (0.0004 mg/kg bw/day). In the infants, consumption of 15 g of contaminated activated charcoal exposes to chromium, cadmium and aluminum as their estimated daily intake (0.00034; 0.0006; 0.0007 mg/kg bw/day respectively) exceed their reference doses (0.0003; 0.0005; 0.0004 mg/kg bw/day respectively). These trace elements are not without risk to consumers health. Activated charcoal products could be contaminated with elemental impurities. Pharmaceutical industries should be vigilant to raw materials (plants and wood) used in the preparation, these materials should come from unpolluted areas to avoid contaminations.",

The structural features responsible for the efficacy of these nanomaterials as antioxidants are, however, poorly understood. Here, the process-structure-property-performance properties of coconut-derived oxidized activated charcoal (cOAC) nano-SOD mimetics are studied by analyzing how modifications to the nanomaterial's synthesis impact the size, as well as the elemental and electrochemical properties of the particles. These properties are then correlated to the in vitro antioxidant bioactivity of poly(ethylene glycol)-functionalized cOACs (PEG-cOAC). Chemical oxidative treatment methods that afford smaller, more homogeneous cOAC nanoparticles with higher levels of quinone functionalization show enhanced protection against oxidative damage in bEnd.3 murine endothelioma cells. In an in vivo rat model of mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) and oxidative vascular injury, PEG-cOACs restore cerebral perfusion rapidly to the same extent as the former nanotube-derived PEG-hydrophilic carbon clusters (PEG-HCCs) with a single intravenous injection. These findings provide a deeper understanding of how carbon nanozyme syntheses can be tailored for improved antioxidant bioactivity, and set the stage for translation of medical applications.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Administration of a single-dose activated charcoal (SDAC) is an effective method used for gastric decontamination and for other types of poisoning and overdose. This is only true when given within the first hour of poison ingestion as the effectivity of SDAC reduces over time. In addition, generally, not all patients are able to avail treatment within the specified period. Hence, multi-dose activated charcoal is regarded as a solution to a delayed process, although, no proof outweighs the use of SDAC. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to review and assess the adequacy of the past and current use of AC. The author also aimed to offer recommendations believed to be the best method to consider for prehospital care. METHODS: The author conducted 6,337 online literature searches for this review, wherein seven papers met eligibility criteria for inclusion and analysis. RESULTS: In this review, routine administration of AC in poisoning was found not related to the duration of hospital stay nor any other subsequent outcomes following poison ingestion. Further, this review did not establish that administration of AC could improve patient's clinical outcome. Further research and clinical trials is required to determine the efficacy of this therapy to appropriate patients in the prehospital setting. CONCLUSION: Activated charcoal can be used to treat highly acute to life-threatening poisoning if it is administered within the first hour of ingestion. Further studies would be necessary to investigate if this would affect clinical outcome..",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is one of the most common functional gastrointestinal disorders. IBS is characterized by recurrent chronic abdominal pain and altered bowel habits in the absence of organic damage. Although there are reviews and guidelines for treating IBS, the complexity and diversity of IBS presentation make treatment difficult. Treatment of IBS focuses on relieving symptoms as mild signs and symptoms can often be controlled by managing stress and by making changes in diet and lifestyle. The use of nutraceutical compounds has been advocated as a possible alternative treatment in patients with IBS. COLONIR® (Omega Pharma Srl, Milan, Italy) may be an alternative or adjuvant treatment in patients with gastrointestinal symptoms. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of this new nutraceutical formulation in inducing symptoms remission and improve gastrointestinal habits. METHODS: An initial cohort of 1004 consecutive patients referred to 25 different Units of Internal Medicine a/o Gastroenterology in Italy to perform colonoscopy for intestinal symptoms was asked to participate. Patients were treated for 2 months with two doses of nutraceuticals/day during meals namely COLONIR®. Patients were assessed at baseline and after 2 months to evaluate the frequency and severity of gastrointestinal symptoms in the past seven days with a questionnaire based on ROMA IV criteria. RESULTS: After 2 months, 899 patients completed the follow-up. COLONIR® achieved a statistically significant reduction of severity of symptoms in the study population without any documented side effects. CONCLUSIONS: These promising results, here reported, need to be confirmed, valuating the efficacy of COLONIR® in relieving gastrointestinal symptoms in IBS patients in further studies.",

Materials and Methods: The present experimental in vitro, longitudinal, and prospective study consisted of 60 teeth randomly distributed in six groups: A: artificial saliva, B: conventional toothpaste (Colgate Maximum Protection), C: whitening toothpaste with activated charcoal (Oral-B 3D White Mineral Clear), D: 16% carbamide peroxide (Whiteness Perfect 16%), E: 16% carbamide peroxide plus conventional toothpaste (Whiteness Perfect 16% plus Colgate Maximum Protection), and F: 16% carbamide peroxide plus whitening toothpaste with activated charcoal (Whiteness Perfect 16% plus Oral-B 3D White Mineral Clear). Surface roughness was assessed with a digital roughness meter before and after each treatment. For the statistical analysis, Student’s t test for related samples was used, in addition to the ANOVA test for one intergroup factor, considering a significance level of p < 0.05. Results: The surface roughness variation of bovine tooth enamel, before and after application of bleaching agent, was higher in groups of whitening toothpaste with activated charcoal (0.200 µm, Confidence Interval (CI): 0.105; 0.296 µm) and 16% carbamide peroxide plus whitening toothpaste with activated charcoal (0.201 µm, (CI): 0.092; 0.309 µm). In addition, bovine teeth treated with conventional toothpaste (p = 0.041), whitening toothpaste with activated charcoal (p = 0.001), and 16% carbamide peroxide plus whitening toothpaste with activated charcoal (p = 0.002) significantly increased their surface roughness values. On the other hand, significant differences were observed when comparing the variation in surface roughness between the application of artificial saliva (control) and the whitening toothpaste with activated charcoal (p = 0.031), and the 16% carbamide peroxide plus whitening toothpaste with activated charcoal (p = 0.030). Conclusion: The use of whitening toothpaste with activated charcoal and in combination with 16% carbamide peroxide significantly increased enamel surface roughness in bovine teeth."

      "abstract": "The high incidence of aflatoxins (AFs) in chocolates suggests the necessity to create a practical and cost-effective processing strategy for eliminating mycotoxins. The present study aimed to assess the adsorption abilities of activated charcoal (A. charcoal), yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae), and the probiotic Lactobacillus rhamnosus as AFs adsorbents in three forms-sole, di- and tri-mix-in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) through an in vitro approach, simulated to mimic the conditions present in the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) based on pH, time and AFs concentration. In addition, the novel fortification of chocolate with A. charcoal, probiotic, and yeast (tri-mix adsorbents) was evaluated for its effects on the sensory properties. Using HPLC, 60 samples of dark, milk, bitter, couverture, powder, and wafer chocolates were examined for the presence of AFs. Results showed that all the examined samples contained AFs, with maximum concentrations of 2.32, 1.81, and 1.66 µg/kg for powder, milk, and dark chocolates, respectively. The combined treatment demonstrated the highest adsorption efficiency (96.8%) among all tested compounds. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) analysis revealed the tested adsorbents to be effective AF-binding agents. Moreover, the novel combination of tri-mix fortified chocolate had a minor cytotoxicity impact on the adsorptive abilities, with the highest binding at pH 6.8 for 4 h, in addition to inducing an insignificant effect on the sensory attributes of dark chocolate. Tri-mix is thus recommended in the manufacturing of dark chocolate in order to enhance the safety of the newly developed product.",

      "abstract": "PM2.5 (particulate matters with diameter ≤ 2.5 μm) from biomass fuel combustion has been identified as a major cause of cardiopulmonary diseases. Briquette and charcoal are two representative processed fuels that exhibit different emission characteristics. This study compared three types of biomass fuels (maize straw, wheat straw, and wood branches) and their respective processed fuels in terms of their emission factors (EFs). The bioreactivity of human alveolar epithelial (A549) cells to exposure to various fuel-emitted PM2.5 was assessed. The EFs of lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) were calculated to compare actual cytotoxicity. The PM2.5 EFs of maize and wheat straw were higher than those of wood branches, and following the processes of briquetting and carbonization, the EFs of PM2.5 and chemical components were effectively reduced. Cell membrane damage and inflammatory responses were observed after A549 cell exposure to PM2.5 extracts. The expression of bioreactivity to briquettes and charcoals was lower than that to raw fuels. The EFs of LDH and IL-6 were also significantly reduced after briquetting and carbonization. This underscores the necessity of fuel treatment for reducing cytotoxicity. The crucial chemical components that contributed to cell oxidative and inflammatory responses were identified, including organic and elemental carbon, water-soluble ions (e.g., K+, Mg2+, and Ca2+), metals (e.g., Fe, Cr, and Ni), and high-molecular-weight PAHs. This study elucidated the similarities and differences of PM2.5 emissions and cytotoxicity of three types of biomass fuel and demonstrated the positive effects of fuel treatment on reducing adverse pulmonary effects.",

      "abstract": "Anaphylaxis is a sudden onset of systemic hypersensitivity caused by mast cell and basophil degranulation. Food, Hymenoptera venom, and drug allergy are among the leading causes of anaphylaxis, particularly in adults. We can consider anaphylaxis caused by swallowing food or medication as a form of poisoning. Because in anaphylaxis, just like in poisoning, an allergen entering the body poses a life-threatening risk. Therefore, the allergen should be removed from the digestive system immediately. However, the decontamination of the gastrointestinal tract is not routinely used to prevent further absorption of allergens from the intestine into the systemic circulation. Among the gastrointestinal decontamination methods is the use of activated charcoal. In this article, we present four patients who developed anaphylaxis due to drug and food intake and were administered oral activated charcoal after their primary treatment (on average, 15-45 minutes after the first presentation) was completed. The youngest of the patients was 22 years old, and the oldest was 40. No side effects, prolonged anaphylactic state, and biphasic reactions were observed in the follow-up of the patients. All patients were discharged after 48-72 hours of hospitalization. The routine approach to poisoning treatment includes patient stabilization, toxidrome recognition, antidote administration, and supportive care, as well as measures to enhance toxin elimination. In anaphylaxis caused by oral allergens, the substance that initiates the reaction can be compared to a kind of toxin. Eliminating the allergen and reducing its absorption could be achieved by administering activated charcoal. Activated charcoal should be considered adjunctive therapy in treating food and oral drug-induced anaphylaxis. This treatment, when administered in a timely manner, might prevent the development of biphasic reactions and the prolongation of the allergic process in anaphylaxis."

Biochar is commonly used as an adsorbent/immobilizer for heavy metals in water and substrates because of its wide range of raw materials, low production cost, and good adsorption performance. In this paper, we selected abundant Moso bamboo as the raw material to make biochar (bamboo charcoal), modified bamboo charcoal using different methods to find the modified product with the best adsorption effect, assessed the adsorption performance of modified bamboo charcoal on Cu(II) and Cd(II) in solution, and investigated the effects of the solution concentration, adsorption time, pH, and temperature on the adsorption effect of KAM500-400-3 on Cu(II) and Cd(II). The effect of the solution concentration, adsorption time, pH, and temperature on the adsorption effect of KAM500-400-3 on Cu(II) and Cd(II) was investigated, and the adsorption mechanism of KAM500-400-3 on heavy metals Cu(II) and Cd(II) was analyzed by fitting the adsorption kinetics, adsorption isotherms, and adsorption thermodynamics. The adsorption/fixation characteristics of modified bamboo charcoal on heavy metals Cu(II) and Cd(II) in water and substrate were investigated. This study aimed to identify an effective material for the treatment of heavy metals in water and substrates and provide a reference for their application in practical engineering."

METHODS: Enamel and dentin samples were divided into toothpastes (n = 12): group (G)1-Colgate Triple Action (1450 ppm F) (positive control); G2-Colgate Natural Extracts (1450 ppm F); G3-Colgate Luminous White Activated Carbon (1450 ppm F); G4-Oral-B Whitening Therapy Charcoal (1100 ppm F); G5-Oral-B 3D White Mineral Clean (1100 ppm F); G6-Curaprox Black Is White (950 ppm F); and G7-erosion only (no abrasion, negative control). All samples were submitted to erosive pH cycles and G1 to G6 to abrasive challenges (15 seconds) using toothpastes' slurries plus 45 seconds of treatment for 7 days. The final profile was overlaid to the baseline one for the ETW calculation (µm). The data were subjected to analysis of variance/Tukey or Kruskal-Wallis/Dunn tests (P < .05). RESULTS: Oral-B 3D White (13.0 ± 1.0, 9.37 [1.36] μm), Oral-B Whitening Therapy (15.1 ± 1.2, 8.58 [1.71] μm), and Colgate Luminous White (13.6 ± 1.0, 7.46 [0.94] μm) toothpastes promoted the greatest enamel and dentin wear. On the other hand, Colgate Triple Action (12.2 ± 1.2, 5.30 [1.26] μm), Colgate Natural Extracts (10.8 ± 1.1, 4.16 [1.11] μm), and Curaprox Black Is White (11.5 ± 1.5, 4.06 [0.92] μm) toothpastes promoted lower wear values, similar to erosion only (4.16 [0.94] μm) in the case of dentin but not enamel (7.1 ± 0.8 μm). CONCLUSIONS: Toothpastes containing charcoal combined with pyrophosphate may have a high abrasive effect on eroded tooth surfaces. Many patients influenced by digital marketing use toothpastes containing activated charcoal with the aim of bleaching their teeth. However, care should be taken when using these products, as they may have a high abrasive effect.",

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Fifty-two blocks of bovine dental enamel were randomly distributed in four groups (n = 13): brushing with activated charcoal-based powder (PW); brushing with activated charcoal-based dentifrice (AC); brushing with a conventional dentifrice containing 1450 ppm of fluoride (CD); and whitening with 10% carbamide peroxide (CP). Color, microhardness, and surface alteration were analyzed at baseline and after 14 days of treatment. Three samples per group were randomly selected and examined using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to analyze the morphology. RESULTS: PW exhibited greater color change for the ΔE00 , ΔWID, Δb* and ΔL* parameters than other groups (p < 0.05). After treatment, microhardness decreased in AC and CP groups (p < 0.05). Also, PW and AC groups showed more surface alteration than CD and CP (p < 0.001). Changes in the morphology of dental enamel were observed by SEM in PW and AC groups. CONCLUSION: Activated charcoal-based products showed a lower whitening effect than 10% carbamide peroxide. These products also influenced dental enamel microhardness, resulting in greater surface alteration. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Activated charcoal-based products promoted minimum whitening effects with significant enamel surface alteration. The 10% carbamide peroxide was more effective for whitening and caused slight enamel surface alteration.",

Immunomodulatory treatments can be used in these patients. One of the alternative treatments reported in the literature is hemoperfusion therapy. In this study, we aim to evaluate our experience of charcoal hemoperfusion therapy in children admitted and followed up with a diagnosis of MIS-C at our Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU). MATERIAL AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective evaluation of children diagnosed with MIS-C and children treated with charcoal hemoperfusion who are admitted to our PICU. RESULTS: Among 49 MIS-C patients, hemoperfusion therapy was performed on 14 patients. Duration of hospitalization, duration of invasive/non-invasive ventilation, VIS, OFI, PRİSM 3 scores, and mortality rates were significantly higher in the charcoal hemoperfusion group before treatment. In patients who did not respond to conventional therapies, we observed a statistically significant decrease in the need for inotrope and invasive mechanical ventilation support and statistically significant improvements in clinical indicators after hemoperfusion therapy. DISCUSSION: In our study, we observed a significant clinical and laboratory improvement by charcoal hemoperfusion in our MIS-C patients who had a severe clinical course and multiple organ failure. CONCLUSION: In our opinion, this study is the first report regarding the use of charcoal hemoperfusion therapy in MIS-C patients, and the choice of charcoal hemoperfusion as an initial or rescue therapy is needed to be investigated in large patient groups both in children and adults who are diagnosed with COVID-19 and MIS-C.",

The aim was to investigate the association between domestic sources of COP and DNS. METHODS: Patients diagnosed with COP between December 2016 and November 2021 were included and divided into two groups according to their sources of poisoning and the endpoint outcome was analyzed by logistic regression before and after propensity score matching (PSM). RESULTS: Overall, medical data from 314 patients were analyzed. In multivariate logistic regression, advanced age (adjusted odds ratio (AOR): 1.028, 95% CI: 1.008-1.049, P = 0.007), longer duration of exposure to the first treatment of hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) (AOR: 1.081, 95% CI: 1.036-1.127, P = 0.001), and intoxication by charcoal burning (AOR: 3.24, 95% CI: 1.208-8.69, P = 0.019) were associated with a higher risk of developing DNS. After 1:1 PSM, the outcomes also revealed that charcoal burning intoxication (odds ratio (OR): 8.396, 95% CI: 3.342-21.095, P<0.001) was associated with greater odds of DNS. CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates that domestic COP caused by charcoal burning is more likely to trigger DNS than gas-emitting heaters.",

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: To evaluate the whitening efficacy of charcoal powder compared to a whitening toothpaste and the surface loss using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and confocal laser scanning microscope (CLSM). METHODS: 60 human extracted teeth were randomly assigned to two groups: Treatment (T, charcoal group: Premium Nature) and Control (C, whitening toothpaste group: Colgate Optic White). Teeth in the treatment group were brushed with a charcoal paste. Teeth shade was evaluated before and after the intervention. Lightness was assessed using both VITA classical shade guide and VITA Easyshade V. Changes within and between the group were evaluated by the paired-sample t-test and independent sample t-test. Surface roughness (Ra) of samples was performed using SEM, and to assess surface loss a CLSM was used. RESULTS: At baseline, there were no significant differences in teeth lightness, chroma, or hue between both the charcoal and the whitening toothpaste groups (P> 0.05). After 21 days of brushing, teeth brushed with the whitening toothpaste were significantly lighter (VITA Easyshade mean score: 78.34, SD: 8.397; VITA classical A1-D4 shade mean: 8.90, SD: 4.475) than the charcoal group (VITA Easyshade mean: 69.70, SD: 6.364; VITA classical A1-D4 shade mean: 11.77; SD: 3.421) (P< 0.001). In addition, there was a significant reduction in lightness (i.e., increase in darkness) within the charcoal group after the intervention (P< 0.001). There was no significant difference in chroma and hue between the charcoal and the whitening toothpaste groups (P> 0.05). There was no significant tooth loss nor roughness change (P= 0.867) for both groups when compared with natural tooth structure. Brushing teeth with the charcoal paste tested for 21 days had no effect on tooth lightness, chroma, or hue. Charcoal powder had no significant effect on tooth surface roughness. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: The Premium Nature charcoal toothpaste tested had no tooth whitening effect.",

      "abstract": "Obesity is becoming a major public health problem worldwide. Making charcoal from wood (\"Sumi-yaki\") has been a traditional activity in the southern part of Nagano Prefecture for centuries, with activated charcoal having reported detoxifying effects. However, it is unclear whether activated charcoal also possesses anti-obesity properties. Additionally, since activated charcoal is usually alkaline and might be affected by gastric juice, we evaluated the effect of acidic activated charcoal on high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity. This study demonstrated that co-treatment of acidic activated charcoal with a HFD significantly improved obesity and insulin resistance in mice in a dose-dependent manner. Metabolomic analysis of cecal contents revealed that neutral lipids, cholesterol, and bile acids were excreted at markedly higher levels in feces with charcoal treatment. Moreover, the hepatic expressions of genes encoding cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase and hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase/synthase 1 were up-regulated by activated charcoal, likely reflecting the enhanced excretions from the intestine and the enterohepatic circulation of cholesterol and bile acids. No damage or abnormalities were detected in the gastrointestinal tract, liver, pancreas, and lung. In conclusion, acidic activated charcoal may be able to attenuate HFD-induced weight gain and insulin resistance without serious adverse effects. These findings indicate a novel function of charcoal to prevent obesity, metabolic syndrome, and related diseases."

      "abstract": "The direct-acting oral anticoagulant dabigatran etexilate (DE prevent systemic thromboembolism and cerebral apoplexy in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation. On September 22, 2021, an 86-year-old female patient in Peking University People's Hospital presented with a severely reduced fibrinogen level and significantly prolonged prothrombin time (PT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT). She had a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, arrhythmia, and a 1-year history of taking DE (110 mg, p.o., b.i.d.). She had no apparent bleeding tendency but had abnormalities in coagulation markers. She denied taking a DE overdose. Before deciding whether to transfuse plasma for replacement therapy, the attending physician wanted to ascertain if the abnormal results resulted from the drug or the abnormal coagulation mechanism of the patient. Tentatively, we used activated charcoal to treat plasma and then retested her coagulation markers: all coagulation tests nearly returned to normal levels. Hence, the cause was a DE overdose. Re-investigation revealed that she had lived alone in the previous week and possibly mistook the number of doses taken due to confusion. DE was withdrawn, and diuretics (Furosemide injection, 40 mg, QD2) were administered simultaneously to accelerate drug excretion. Five days after drug withdrawal, the coagulation tests returned to normal levels. This case report shows that activated charcoal could be used to show that the coagulation disorder was caused by a DE overdose, thereby providing support for the clinical diagnosis and treatment.",

      "abstract": "While the potable water disinfection regimen has significantly reduced waterborne diseases, development of disinfection byproducts (DBP) during this process has brought a global threat to the environment and human health. The most notorious water pollutant, humic acid (HA), transforms into carcinogenic byproducts during the disinfection process (chlorination) of water treatment. HA removal methods are neither economic nor widely available. This study addresses the most urgent global issue of HA removal by developing an innovative and self-regenerative process based on a low-cost and self-regenerative calf bone char (CBC) that removed 92.1-100% of HA. CBC-based HA removal has not been described yet. The developed CBC, as a super adsorbent of HA, was initially characterized by a scanning electron microscope. Various parameters of adsorption/desorption and self-regeneration of CBC adsorbent were experimentally determined. Results show that prepared CBC with a 112 m2/g surface area exhibited adsorption of 38.08 mg/g (HA = 20 mg/L, pH = 4.0) which is several folds higher than the typical amount of HA present in water. The 30 m reaction time was enough to remove HA which is the shorter HA time in comparison to other similar studies. The increase of HA from 0.5 to 5 g/L, raises % HA removal (36.7-99.8%) while a pH decrease (10-4) increases adsorption (12.3-98.3%). The adsorption data fitted well with the pseudo-second-order model and the Langmuir isotherm which demonstrate that adsorption takes place by a monolayer formation. Thermodynamic constants supported the endothermic, spontaneous and reversible nature of adsorption which can attain 100% HA removal. 100% regeneration of exhausted CBC by NaOH further supports the sustainability of the process. CBC as a new adsorbent material thus provides an economical and sustainable water pre-treatment procedure. The present study provides technical guidance for building a cost-effective and scalable process capable of providing clean water.",

METHOD: A multicentre randomised controlled open-label wound-dressing trial was conducted in two wound care outpatient clinics in western Switzerland from November 2018 to March 2020. RESULTS: A total of 77 successive patients were randomised to receive either a sterile polyacrylate wound pad with activated carbon cloth treatment (n=38) or the standard non-adhesive hydrocellular foam dressing with silver (n=39). Reduction in wound area was the primary outcome, whereas the application period of the dressing, odour, maceration and pain were the secondary outcomes. Wound area was measured at baseline and during each wound dressing change until the dressings were no longer indicated. Wound area reduced faster in the intervention group than in the control group (0.45cm2 per day vs. 0.2cm2 per day), although the application period was longer in the intervention group compared with the control group (9.5 days vs. 8.1 days). Maceration reduction was more pronounced in the intervention group (-2.07cm2) than in the control group (-0.71cm2). Odour, pain and infection were similar in both groups. CONCLUSION: Sterile polyacrylate wound pad dressings with activated carbon cloth reduced the wound area, as well as the maceration area, faster than the non-adhesive hydrocellular foam dressing with silver.",

METHODS: Bovine teeth (n= 64) used for color measurements were stained in tea solution and embedded in acrylic resin. Specimens were randomized into four groups of 16 specimens each. Cavity Protection (Colgate-Palmolive) was the negative control. Whitening dentifrices used were Black is White (Curaden AG); and My Magic Mud (Carbon and Clay Company) containing activated charcoal and Optic White (Colgate-Palmolive) containing hydrogen peroxide. Instrumental color measurements were performed at baseline, 1-week post-brushing, 30-day post-brushing, and 1-month follow-up. Another set of bovine teeth (n= 64) used for roughness measurements were embedded in acrylic resin and the surface ground flat. The experimental groups and brushing protocol were the same as for the color evaluation part. Surface roughness was measured with a contact type profilometer at baseline and after the last brushing session. Kruskal-Wallis procedure tested changes in color and surface roughness among the different groups. All post-hoc comparisons were conducted with Bonferroni corrections. Tests of hypotheses were two-sided with an alpha level at 0.05. RESULTS: Overall color change was not significantly different among groups at 1-week post-brushing and at 1-month follow-up. However, the hydrogen peroxide group had a significantly higher reduction in chroma in the yellow-blue axis when compared to negative control group at 30-day post-brushing and 1-month follow-up (P< 0.05). There was no significant difference in roughness among the groups at baseline (P= 0.2973) and post treatment (P= 0.8169).

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: Neonatal calf diarrhea (NCD) is a major cause of death and economic loss in the cattle industry. Although NCD is caused by a variety of nutritional factors and non-bacterial pathogens, treatment typically includes systemic antimicrobial therapy, even for non-severe cases that are more likely to have non-bacterial causes. Novel, non-antimicrobial therapies are needed to reduce antimicrobial use and optimize production efficiency. METHODS: This production-level study compared the efficacy of activated charcoal to that of an antimicrobial regimen for treating mild-to-moderate cases of NCD, and identified the most common etiological agents. Calves diagnosed with non-severe diarrhea were randomly allocated into 3 treatment groups (n = 86 per group): group A received a standard antimicrobial regimen, B received both antimicrobials and activated charcoal, and C received activated charcoal only. Animals were monitored over the course of 7 days for mortality and recovery from diarrhea. Fecal samples were collected upon enrollment (day 0) and on day 7 to assess the presence of major NCD-causing pathogens. RESULTS: Mortality was higher for groups B and C relative to A, although this difference was only statistically significant for group B vs A. No significant difference in the number of recovered animals was observed among the treatment groups, although group C was significantly slower to recover than A or B. The vast majority of day 0 samples were positive for non-bacterial organisms (mainly rotavirus and Cryptosporidium parvum), which decreased significantly by day 7 regardless of treatment group. CONCLUSION: Antimicrobials only moderately improved outcomes for non-severe diarrhea cases relative to activated charcoal. Thus, systemic antimicrobial treatment is likely unnecessary for the majority of NCD cases and should be limited to severe cases."

Management is guided by research reported over 50 years ago when chronic aspirin toxicity was common and accounted for significant morbidity. We investigate our experience of aspirin overdose and the effectiveness of charcoal and bicarbonate administration over 20 years. METHODS: This is a retrospective series of acute aspirin overdose from two toxicology units from January 2000 to September 2019. Acute aspirin ingestions > 3000 mg were identified in each unit's database. Excluded were cases of chronic exposure, hospital presentation > 24 hours after ingestion, and cases without a salicylate concentration. Included in our analysis was demographic data, clinical effects, investigations, complications, and treatment. RESULTS: There were 132 presentations in 108 patients (79 females (73%)). The median age was 28 years (range: 13-93 years). The median dose ingested was 7750 mg (IQR: 6000-14,400 mg). There were 44 aspirin-only ingestions. Mild toxicity (nausea, vomiting, tinnitus or hyperventilation) occurred in 22 with a median dose of 160 mg/kg. Moderate toxicity (acid-base disturbance, confusion) occurred in 16 with a median ingested dose of 297 mg/kg. There were no cases of severe toxicity (coma or seizures) due to aspirin alone. The median peak salicylate concentration was 276 mg/L (IQR: 175-400 mg/L, range: 14-814 mg/L). There was a moderate association between dose ingested and peak concentration (Pearson r = 0.58; 95% CI 0.45-0.68). Activated charcoal was administered in 36 (27%) cases, which decreased the median peak salicylate concentration (34.2 to 24.8 mg/L/g (difference: 9.4, 95% CI: 1.0-13.1)). Bicarbonate was administered in 34 (26%) presentations, decreasing the median apparent elimination half-life from 13.4 to 9.3 h (difference: 4.2 h, 95% CI: 1.0-6.5 h). CONCLUSIONS: Acute aspirin overdose caused only mild to moderate effects in this series. Early administration of activated charcoal decreased absorption and use of bicarbonate enhanced elimination.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Celiac disease is an autoimmune disorder that causes an intolerance to gluten. Owing to hidden sources, lack of clear labeling, and cross-contamination, it is not uncommon for individuals with celiac disease to inadvertently ingest gluten. A strict gluten-free diet is the only treatment. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to identify the frequency of activated charcoal use in celiac disease as a purported remedy despite the lack of literature on the safety and efficacy of the practice and to elucidate the manner in which using activated charcoal as a treatment for acute gluten ingestion is being communicated. METHODS: Using a descriptive study design, a Web-based survey was sent to members of the celiac disease community via social media pages for voluntary participants 18 years and older diagnosed with celiac disease. Participants were stratified into 3 major groups: (1) those who had heard of using activated charcoal as a remedy to counteract gluten ingestion and used it, (2) those who had heard of using activated charcoal but had not used it, and (3) those who had not heard of using activated charcoal. RESULTS: In subjects with celiac disease, 424 of 1613 respondents (26%) had heard of using activated charcoal as a potential remedy for gluten ingestion, and 12% had used it. The top source of information regarding any general information including remedies for maladies related to celiac disease was social media networks 72.3% (879/1613). Of those who had used activated charcoal, 122 participants (61.3%) reported subjectively feeling a reduced severity of symptoms. CONCLUSION: Pharmacists should be aware of the off-label use of activated charcoal for accidental gluten ingestion in celiac disease. Pharmacists should educate patients with celiac disease that there is not sufficient evidence to support the use of activated charcoal.",

The safety of invasive medical materials and the prevention of infection are gradually being valued. Therefore, avoiding operation failure or wound infection and inflammation caused by surgical infection is one of the most important topics in current medical technology. Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) have minor irritation and toxicity to cells and have a broad-spectrum antibacterial effect without causing bacterial resistance and other problems. They are also less toxic to the human body. Bamboo charcoal (BC) is a bioinert material with a porous structure, light characteristics, and low density, like bone quality. It can be used as a lightweight bone filling material. However, it does not have any antibacterial function. This study synthesized AgNPs under the ultraviolet (UV) photochemical method by reducing silver nitrate with sodium citrate. The formation and distribution of AgNPs were confirmed by UV-visible spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction measurement (XRD). The BC was treated by O2 plasma to increase the number of polar functional groups on the surface. Then, UV light-induced graft polymerization of N-isopropyl acrylamide (NIPAAm) and AgNPs were applied onto the BC to immobilize thermos-/antibacterial composite hydrogels on the BC surface. The structures and properties of thermos-/antibacterial composite hydrogel-modified BC surface were characterized by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Fourier Transform Infrared spectrum (FT-IR), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The results show that thermos-/antibacterial composite hydrogels were then successfully grafted onto BC. SEM observations showed that the thermos-/antibacterial composite hydrogels formed a membrane structure between the BC. The biocompatibility of the substrate was evaluated by Alamar Blue cell viability assay and antibacterial test in vitro."

      "abstract": "The ability of bamboo charcoal to reduce the negative effects of high dietary selenium (Se) concentrations was assessed by feeding juvenile blunt snout bream (Megalobrama amblycephala) one of five Se-rich diets (1.5 mg/kg Se; 36% protein, 8.7% lipid) containing graded levels (0-4 g/kg) of bamboo charcoal powder for eight weeks. There were four tanks (350 L) of fish (initial weight 16.0 ± 0.5 g) for each treatment, and the fish were fed to satiation four times each day. At the end of the feeding trial, all of the fish from each tank were weighed to calculate the growth performance. Blood samples were firstly obtained to collect plasma for the biochemical indexes determination. Liver tissues were then collected to determine the antioxidant enzyme activities and gene expression. Dorsal muscles were also collected to determine the nutrient composition. The results show that when the bamboo charcoal content in the Se-rich feed ranged between 0 and 3 g/kg, the weight growth rate (WGR) and specific growth rate (SGR) values increased with the higher dietary bamboo charcoal content, and the maximum WGR and SGR values were achieved when the bamboo charcoal content in the Se-rich feed was 2-3 g/kg (p < 0.05). The Se content in muscle tissues decreased significantly with the increased bamboo charcoal content (p < 0.05) in the Se-rich feed, which ranged from 0 to 4 g/kg. When the bamboo charcoal content in the Se-rich feed was 2-3 g/kg, the levels of glucose (GLU) and albumin (ALB) in plasma reached a maximum (p < 0.05), whereas the level of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) reached a minimum (p < 0.05). Additionally, the activities of catalase (CAT), total superoxide dismutase (T-SOD), total antioxidative capacity (T-AOC), and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) were significantly enhanced (p < 0.05) when the bamboo charcoal content was 3 g/kg. In contrast, the malondialdehyde (MDA) level increased sharply when the bamboo charcoal content in the Se-rich feed was 1 g/kg, compared to the control group and the groups supplemented with 2-3 g/kg bamboo charcoal (p < 0.05). Regarding mRNA-level gene expression, the results show that dietary supplementation with 0 to 3 g/kg of bamboo charcoal increased the expression of keap1 and nrf2, whereas nfkb expression was inhibited (p < 0.05). The mRNA expression of the antioxidant enzymes cat, gpx, and mn-sod was consistently enhanced in the group fed with the 3 g/kg bamboo charcoal diet (p < 0.05). The expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokines tnfα and tgfβ was inhibited in the groups supplemented with 2-3 g/kg bamboo charcoal, whereas the expression of anti-inflammatory cytokines (il10) increased in the bamboo charcoal supplementation groups compared to the control group (p < 0.05). Generally, supplementation with 2-3 g/kg of bamboo charcoal in Se-rich feed improved the growth performance, physiological status, and antioxidant enzyme activities of blunt snout bream. Moreover, bamboo charcoal supplementation in Se-rich diets stimulated the antioxidant system and inhibited the inflammatory response by activating Nrf2-Keap1 and suppressing NF-κB."

      "abstract": "During high temperature slagging gasification of municipal solid waste (MSW), coal coke is typically used as an auxiliary fuel to maintain the high temperature in the gasifier and convert ashes into slag. Herein, biomass charcoal was utilized as a greener and more sustainable auxiliary fuel to replace the coal coke during stable and continuous gasification of MSW. Several monitoring characteristics were assessed, like operating conditions of the gasifier, influence of local MSW properties generated in Singapore, environmental impacts, and main by-products (slag, fly ash and metals). The performance data revealed that the replacement of coal coke with biomass charcoal provided significant environmental benefits. The use of biomass charcoal resulted in 78% less SO2 emissions, and 22% less generated fly ash because the lower sulfur content in biomass charcoal resulted in a 32% reduced use of sorbent for flue gas treatment. Furthermore, there was clear evidence of a 22% carbon footprint reduction due to replacing fossil fuel as auxiliary fuel. In addition, the slag characteristics demonstrated lower heavy metals leaching as compared to the incineration bottom ash generated from the conventional MSW incineration plant suggesting its great potential in the application as clean and green waste-derived material in the construction industry.",

      "abstract": "Background: High dose methotrexate (HDMTX) is used for the treatment of pediatric hemato-oncological diseases. HDMTX can induce acute kidney injury in cases of delayed elimination. The use of leucovorin remains the most effective rescue action. Further treatment options are of difficult access in the rare cases where leucovorin fails to prevent renal failure from occurring. Glucarpidase is an effective treatment in cases of methotrexate (MTX) delayed elimination, but cost is high and availability is limited. Charcoal hemoperfusion (CHP) is a very efficient procedure to remove protein-bound drugs, promoting fast MTX elimination, but is rarely considered as a treatment option. Methods: We present three pediatric cases with prolonged exposure to MTX after HDMTX and delayed elimination in which hemoperfusion was performed as rescue treatment for methotrexate intoxication. Results: Charcoal hemoperfusion was performed with positive results and no complications as bridging until glucarpidase was available in two cases and in one case where two doses of glucarpidase led to insufficient reduction of MTX levels. Conclusions: CHP can be considered as a rescue treatment option in MTX intoxication, since it is an effective and safe extracorporeal method for removing MTX, in cases where rescue with leucovorin is insufficient and glucarpidase is not available or while waiting for delivery."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Lamotrigine toxicity can cause coma, seizures, and intraventricular conduction disturbances, and treatment options include good supportive care. We report two cases of lamotrigine poisoning in which multiple-dose activated charcoal may have shortened the elimination half-life of lamotrigine. CASE 1: A 21-year-old woman ingested 15.6 g lamotrigine, 14 g levetiracetam, and 15 mg clonazepam. She became comatose and developed generalized tonic seizure. One hour post-ingestion, 50 g activated charcoal was administered. Starting 11 h post-ingestion, 25 g activated charcoal was administered every 4 h for 4 doses. The peak concentration of serum lamotrigine was 49.5 µg/mL, and the elimination half-life after commencement of multiple-dose activated charcoal was 6.5 h. CASE 2: A 46-year-old woman ingested 0.3 g lamotrigine and 0.1 g topiramate twice, 2 h apart. She became drowsy, complained of blurred vision, vertigo, nausea, and vomited. An initial dose of 50 g activated charcoal was administered at 4.5 h post-second ingestion, and subsequent doses of 25 g (total of 3 doses) were administered every 4 h, commencing at 8.5 h post-second ingestion. The peak concentration of serum lamotrigine was 19.9 µg/mL, and the elimination half-life after commencement of multiple-dose activated charcoal was 9.3 h. DISCUSSION: The mean elimination half-life of lamotrigine in healthy volunteers and epileptic patients receiving lamotrigine monotherapy is 22.8-37.4 h. In our two cases, multiple-dose activated charcoal may have shortened the elimination half-life of lamotrigine, possibly by inhibiting enterohepatic circulation. Multiple-dose activated charcoal should be considered an option for treating lamotrigine poisoning.",

In this study, activated charcoal was produced using hamburger seed coat activated with zinc chloride and its physicochemical properties such as fixed carbon, specific surface area, volatile matter, ash and moisture content were investigated. Scanning electron microscopy and Fourier transform infrared spectrometry techniques were used to study the surface morphology and variations in the absorption bands of functional groups, respectively. The adsorbent biosorption of pollutants abilities from contaminated water was investigated using standard methods with a view to ascertaining the adsorbent purification potential. The results showed that the adsorbent was of high porous structure with adsorption capacity significantly correlated with iodine value. The physicochemical properties of the contaminated water treated with the adsorbent were comparable with commercial activated charcoal (control)-treated water but indicated a significant decrease (p < 0.05) in the pH, temperature, total dissolved solids, total suspended solids, conductivity, turbidity, alkalinity, hardness, biochemical oxygen demand, chemical oxygen demand, anions and heavy metal ions when compared to the untreated water. With the exception of alkalinity, other parameters investigated in the water treated with the test adsorbent fell within the standards set for potable water. Results of this study therefore revealed possibility of converting large quantities of hamburger seed coat wastes that could constitute environmental pollution to a profitable product that could be employed for treatment of wastewater.

Increasing resistance of C. jejuni strains against antimicrobial treatments, necessitates antibiotics-independent treatment options for acute campylobacteriosis. Activated charcoal (AC) constitutes a long-known and safe compound for the treatment of bacterial enteritis. In this preclinical intervention study, we addressed potential anti-pathogenic and immune-modulatory effects of AC during acute experimental campylobacteriosis. Therefore, microbiota-depleted IL-10-/- mice were infected with C. jejuni by gavage and challenged with either AC or placebo via the drinking water starting on day 2 post-infection. On day 6 post-infection, AC as compared to placebo-treated mice did not only harbor lower intestinal pathogen loads but also presented with alleviated C. jejuni-induced clinical signs such as diarrhea and wasting symptoms. The improved clinical outcome of AC-treated mice was accompanied by less colonic epithelial cell apoptosis and reduced pro-inflammatory immune responses in the intestinal tract. Notably, AC treatment did not only alleviate intestinal, but also extra-intestinal and systemic immune responses as indicated by dampened pro-inflammatory mediator secretion. Given the anti-pathogenic and immune-modulatory properties of AC in this study, a short-term application of this non-toxic drug constitutes a promising antibiotics-independent option for the treatment of human campylobacteriosis."

Methods: This study used an experimental method with a completely randomized design consisting of six treatments and four replications, including adding activated charcoal to feed at concentrations of 0%, 1%, 1.5%, 2%, 2.5%, and 3% for 42 days. The measured parameters included daily growth rate (DGR), specific growth rate (SGR), absolute growth rate (AGR), feed conversion ratio (FCR), feed efficiency (FE), survival rate (SR), length of foveola gastrica, width of foveola gastrica, length of intestinal villi, and width of intestinal villi. Data were analyzed statistically using one-way analysis of variance and Duncan's test. Results: The results showed that supplementing fish feed with rice husk activated charcoal at different concentrations significantly affected the values of DGR, AGR, FCR, FE, SR, length of the foveola gastrica, length of the villous intestine, and width of the villous intestine, but did not significantly affect SGR or foveola gastrica width.

However, today there is still no objective screening tool to identify patients at high risk of developing DNS. The aim of this study was to identify clinical factors that could predict DNS after acute charcoal-burning CO poisoning. METHODS: This prospective observational study was conducted from September 1, 2019 to August 31, 2020 in a single academic medical center. Patients older than 18 years of age suffering from charcoal-burning CO poisoning were included in the study. After acute recovery, patients were followed up for six weeks to investigate for DNS development. The clinical predictors of DNS were determined using a multivariate logistic regression model. RESULTS: Of the 217 patients-113 males (52.1%), median age 37.0 (27.5-51.5) years-included, 49 (22.6%) developed DNS. The multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed the independent predictors of DNS as a lower initial Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score (adjusted odds ratio (AOR): 0.73, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.62-0.87), a longer duration of CO exposure (AOR: 2.18, 95% CI: 1.65-2.88), and the presence of acute brain lesions with high signal intensity on diffusion-weighted imaging (AOR: 5.22, 95% CI: 1.50-18.08). The created multivariate regression model predicted DNS development with high accuracy (area under the curve: 0.93, 95% CI: 0.89-0.97). CONCLUSION: A low initial GCS score, longer exposure to CO and abnormal findings on diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging can assist in the early identification of patients at high risk of DNS development.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Suicides by carbon monoxide poisoning from burning charcoal increased markedly and contributed to a rise in overall suicides in Taiwan in the early 2000s. A previous study indicated short-term effectiveness on reducing suicides of a charcoal restriction programme, which involved voluntary actions from large chain retail stores to move charcoal bags from open shelves to locked cabinets starting from 1st May 2012, in New Taipei City, Taiwan. We investigated the longer-term effect of this programme. METHODS: We calculated quarterly age-standardised charcoal-burning and overall suicide rates in New Taipei City and two comparison cities in 2007-2017. Controlled interrupted time-series analysis was used to examine the effect of the charcoal restriction programme. RESULTS: There was no difference between the intervention and comparison cities in step changes in the rates (per 100,000) of charcoal-burning suicide (intervention minus comparison = -0.336, 95% confidence interval -1.173 to 0.502) and overall suicide (-0.270, -1.844 to 1.303) after the intervention, or changes in trends (slopes) in charcoal-burning suicide rates (0.007, -0.055 to 0.069) and overall suicide rates (0.049, -0.138 to 0.236) before and after the intervention. LIMITATIONS: There was no legislative requirement to enforce the charcoal restriction. The programme was also restricted to a subset of retail stores. CONCLUSION: The charcoal restriction programme in New Taipei City showed no effect on reducing charcoal-burning or overall suicides in the five years after its implementation. Future means restriction strategies for suicide prevention should optimise the programme sustainability, ensure the comprehensive means restriction, and monitor the long-term intervention effectiveness.",

The subjects were selected from (students) of Riyadh Elm University in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Subjects were informed about the study and signed the consent form before participation. From January to April 2019, subjects were given charcoal and non-charcoal toothbrushes. RESULTS: The Wilcoxon signed rank test showed that there was a significant difference in bacterial counts between non-charcoal and charcoal toothbrushes (P = 0.000). Of the subjects, 70% showed a decrease in the number of bacterial counts while 30% showed no increase in bacterial counts. There was a statistically significant decrease in the number of bacteria in the gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) with charcoal treatment (P < 0.001). Of the subjects, 96.6% showed a decrease in the count of bacteria in GCF after using a charcoal toothbrush. Only 3.3% of the subjects had the similar counts of bacteria in GCF after using the charcoal toothbrush. CONCLUSION: The study demonstrates that charcoal toothbrushes reduce bacterial contamination and the poor effects on oral health after 1 week of use."

      "abstract": "This experiment examines the effects of bamboo charcoal (BC) powder, bamboo vinegar (BV), and their combination (BCV) in the diet of laying hens on performance, egg quality, relative organ weights, and intestinal bacterial populations. A total of 320 laying hens (36 weeks of age) were divided into 4 treatment groups, with 10 replicates per treatment and 8 hens per replicate. They were fed on a control diet, the control diet supplemented with 0.8% BC, the control diet supplemented with 0.4% BV, or the control diet supplemented with a combination of BC (0.8%) and BV (0.4%) from 36 to 51 weeks of age. Egg production increased in the hens fed the BV and BCV diets during 48 to 51 weeks of age (P < 0.05). Damaged egg rate decreased in the hens fed the BV and BCV diets for the whole experiment (P < 0.05). Shell thickness was highest in the BCV-fed group at week 43, and shell strength was higher in the BV-fed group at week 51 (P < 0.05). Supplementation of BC or BCV in the diet resulted in a decreased abdominal fat pad (P < 0.05). In the ileal content, the population of Salmonella spp. decreased in the BV and BCV groups and the population of Lactobacillus spp. increased in the BV group (P < 0.05). The present results indicate that feeding BV or BCV alleviates damaged egg rate and decreases intestinal pathogenic bacteria, while feeding BC benefits by reducing abdominal fat. These results suggest that the effect of BCV seems to be induced by the synergistic effect of BC and BV, and that the BCV contributes to the effective use of bamboo on the laying hen's production.",

The addition of ZVI in anaerobic sludge resulted in higher performance mostly in cumulative CH4 production. The microbial profile of anaerobic granular sludge exposed to ZVI was determined and Acetobacterium and Arcobacter were the most dominant bacteria genera. Activated charcoal achieved higher COD removal, compared to biological degradation (aerobic and anaerobic). The combination of the two mechanisms, activated charcoal and biomass, had higher COD removal only for aerobic biomass. The combination of ZVI and activated charcoal to anaerobic digestion resulted in higher CH4 production and significant COD removal in short contact time."

BC + BV resulted in the highest degradation of OM. BV was most effective treatment in controlling CH4 emissions and it significantly reduced the abundance of the mcrA gene. Methanobrevibacter, Methanosarcina, and Methanocorpusculum were closely related to CH4 emissions during the thermophilic composting period. PICRUSt analysis showed that BC and/or BV enhanced the metabolism associated with OM degradation and reduced CH4 metabolism. Structural equation modeling indicated that BC + BV strongly promoted the metabolic activity of microorganisms, which had a positive effect on CH4 emissions. Together these results suggest that BC + BV may be a suitable composting strategy if the aerobic conditions can be effectively improved during the thermophilic composting period.",

Remediation of textile effluents is often challenging because of its composition, which also varies between dyeing units. In this study, we demonstrate the novel use of a waste-water bacterium, Escherichia fergusonii, in the effective remediation of textile effluents. The bacteria application efficiently caused a reduction of color (98.4%), total dissolved solids (75%), sulphates (87%), bicarbonates (83%), chlorides (64%), calcium (84%), and chemical oxygen demand (81%) of the textile effluents. The bacteria-treated effluents were further disinfected and detoxified by treating with rice husk activated charcoal. After the charcoal treatment, the chemical oxygen demand decreased further by 11.5% and biochemical oxygen demand decreased by 85%. The effluents remediated using the two-step process were subjected to toxicity assays using zebrafish (Danio rerio) model. The textile effluents treated using Escherichia fergusonii, followed by activated charcoal were found to be non-toxic and suitable for reuse for domestic applications. Thus, we present here, a simple, less energy-intensive, economic, two-step process as a complete solution for textile effluent treatment. The results of this investigation can be used to simplify the remediation process of textile effluents in common treatment plants as well as the individual dyeing units.",

Batch adsorption was performed using different variables like adsorbent dose, temperature and contact duration. Thermodynamic analysis of batch treatment concluded that adsorption is thermodynamically feasible and endothermic. This adsorption followed the Pseudo second-order kinetic model derived from correlation coefficient values of chemical kinetic studies. For column study, interpretation of breakthrough curves and parameters were conducted by varying flow rate, initial concentration and bed height; and reveal that optimum conditions were lower flow rate (5 mL/min) and lower initial concentration (5 mg/L) and higher bed height (20 cm). Comparisons of batch and column study through isotherm models were evaluated and column study is more preferred than batch treatment. Maximum Thomas adsorption capacity was achieved upto 205.6, 185.8, 154.5, 133.3, 120.6, 110.9 mg/g for Pb, Cu, Cd, Zn, Ni and Cr respectively. This removal pattern is elucidated by metal ionic properties. Various adsorbing agents such as acids and bases were utilized for adsorption-desorption of AC-NLP.",

This is a retrospective cohort study conducted at the Emergency Department of Affiliated Hospital of Integrated Traditional Chinese and Western Medicine. Consecutive patients who were hospitalized during a two-year time frame (from June 2016 to August 2017) and diagnosed with Haff disease were reviewed. Clinical symptoms, laboratory findings, pain/anxiety scores, and treatment-related adverse events were collected. Sixty-eight Haff disease patients after boiled crayfish consumption were enrolled in this study. Besides standard treatments for Haff disease, 22 patients had an oral administration of activated charcoal and mannitol within 12 hours of hospital admission (ACM group), while the other 46 patients did not receive such treatment (non-ACM group). Baseline characteristics including clinical symptoms, serum enzyme levels, and pain/anxiety scores were comparable between the two groups. Activated charcoal and mannitol treatment led to lower CK-MB and AST levels from 12 hours to 60 hours, lower ALT and LDH levels from 12 hours to 72 hours, and lower CK levels from 24 hours to 72 hours after hospitalization. Patients in the ACM group had significantly shortened duration of hospital stays (7.5 [6.0-8.0] days vs 8.0 [6.8-10.0] days, p = 0.032) and lower anxiety scores 24 hours after hospital admission (40.7 ± 4.9 vs 44.1 ± 6.3, p = 0.032) than in the non-ACM group. No patient experienced treatment-related adverse events. The overall prognosis of both groups is good. Among patients with Haff disease caused by boiled crayfish, activated charcoal combined with mannitol treatment resulted in shorter hospital stays, lower serum CK, CK-MB, AST, ALT, and LDH levels, and lower anxiety scores."

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: Excision of metastatic lesions is an important treatment strategy in patients with malignant melanoma, both at the initial diagnosis and upon recurrence. Since nonpalpable lesions cannot be easily visualized in the surgical field, we evaluated the effectiveness of ultrasound (US)-guided tattooing using a charcoal suspension for the localization of nonpalpable metastatic lesions of malignant melanoma. METHODS: Between November 2009 and June 2019, we retrospectively reviewed 65 nonpalpable lesions in 29 patients with malignant melanoma who underwent preoperative US-guided tattooing using a charcoal suspension for histologically confirmed or suspected metastases. The characteristics of the tattooed lesions were analyzed. The effectiveness of the procedure was evaluated based on the detection rate in the surgical field and the presence or absence of residua on postoperative follow-up US. Procedure-related complications were also analyzed. RESULTS: Of 65 lesions, 33 (50.8%) were histologically confirmed as metastases before the tattooing procedure, while the other 32 were suspected of being metastases based on imaging studies. The mean lesion size was 9.8 mm (range, 1.3 to 24.4 mm). The final pathology revealed metastases in 59 lesions (90.8%), including lymph node (n=51), muscle (n=5), and in-transit (n=3) metastases. Sixty-one lesions (93.8%) were successfully detected intraoperatively and removed without residua on follow-up US. Four residual lesions were removed after repeated localization (n=2) or by intraoperative US (n=2). No relevant complications were noted. CONCLUSION: Preoperative US-guided tattooing localization can safely and effectively delineate nonpalpable metastatic melanoma lesions to aid in successful surgical excision."

Physiochemical characteristics of composite beads were analyzed using FTIR, SEM, TGA, and BET. Adsorption equilibrium data showed excellent fit to the Freundlich model (R2 = 0.994) than to the Langmuir model (R2 = 0.925). Adsorption kinetics study indicated that the MG removal process would be better described by the pseudo-second-order kinetic model. The thermodynamic study suggested the spontaneous and endothermic nature of MG adsorption. By using response surface methodology, the optimum conditions for MG adsorption on composite beads were found to be 115.43 min, 0.3 g/L and pH 8 for contact time, adsorbent mass, and pH respectively and MG adsorption efficiency was 97.88%. The fixed-bed column data were evaluated using several kinetic models and among them, Thomas model showed the best agreement with investigation results. These results revealed that synthesized composite beads have a high affinity toward MG and it could be reasonable, eco-friendly adsorbent for dye removal from wastewater.",

METHODS: Dental blocks (n = 10/group) were randomly divided into COAL, COAL/RT, COAL/WT, CP, CP/RT, CP/WT, RT, WT, and CONT (without treatment). Simulated toothbrushing and whitening treatments were followed by colorimetric (ΔE00 , L*, a*, b*), surface roughness (Ra), and enamel topography assays. ΔE00 was submitted to two-way ANOVA and Tukey test. Color coordinates and Ra were tested with three-way repeated measures ANOVA (α = 5%). RESULTS: COAL exhibited greater ΔE00 than CONT (P = .048), but it did not enhance ΔE00 promoted by RT or WT (P > .05). COAL alone increased Ra (P < .001) and altered enamel topography. COAL did not increase Ra caused by RT and WT (P > .05). CP exhibited the highest ΔE00 (P < .05), but it raised Ra and changed enamel topography to a less extent than COAL. CONCLUSION: Even though charcoal powder did not increase enamel Ra when combined with toothpastes, the topography was negatively impacted by COAL. Also, COAL was unable to enhance the color change of RT and WT, or reach the effectiveness of CP. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: The use of activated charcoal-based product, claimed as a natural whitener, before brushing with toothpastes is not only ineffective to change the color of teeth, but also it might result in alterations on the enamel surface. Whitening with CP, instead, was effective during the same period of treatment, which still represents a more appropriate technique to whiten teeth.",

The pathogen survives through the production of microsclerotia in the soil and in strawberry debris. However, its management is difficult, and the disease has become an increasing problem for the strawberry industry. Physical, cultural, and chemical alternatives for integrated management of charcoal rot were evaluated in laboratory and field trials during the 2017-18 and 2018-19 strawberry seasons. In a laboratory trial, M. phaseolina microsclerotia were subjected to heat treatment and germination was inhibited at 52, 56, 80, and 95°C after 30, 10, 1, and 0.5 min of exposure, respectively. In infected strawberry crowns, microsclerotial viability was reduced after 5 min, regardless of temperature, whereas in the field, reduction was observed after 1 min. In field trials, charcoal rot incidence of inoculated strawberry plants transplanted into white-striped plastic-mulched beds was reduced to 20.8%, compared with 60.8% for plants grown in the black plastic mulch. On commercial farms, crop residue removal from infested areas reduced the M. phaseolina population in the soil but did not decrease charcoal rot incidence. Moreover, M. phaseolina propagule densities in the soil and in strawberry debris was reduced by fumigant application at crop termination but surviving propagules allowed the population to increase over the summer. Furthermore, preplant fumigation with metam potassium reduced soil population and charcoal rot incidence. Overall, the adoption of integrated approaches such as physical, chemical, and/or cultural methods played a significant role in reducing M. phaseolina inoculum and contributed to control of the disease in areas with high disease pressure.",

Four types of wood-based wastes were used in the pyrolysis process: pine sawdust (PS), chipboard (CB), medium-density fiberboard (MDF), and oriented strand board (OSB). Additionally, the slow and fast types of pyrolysis were compared, where the heating rates were 15 °C/min and 100 °C/min, respectively. Chemical analyses of the raw materials and the pyrolysis product yields are presented. A significant calorific value rise was observed for the solid pyrolysis products (from approximately 17.5 MJ/kg for raw materials up to approximately 29 MJ/kg for slow pyrolysis products and 31 MJ/kg for fast pyrolysis products). A higher carbon content of char was observed in raw materials (from approximately 48% for raw materials up to approximately 75% for slow pyrolysis products and approximately 82% for fast pyrolysis products) than after the pyrolysis process. This work presents the possibility of utilizing waste furniture material that is mostly composed of wood, but is not commonly used as a substrate for conversion into low-emission fuel. The results prove that the proposed solution produced char characterized by the appropriate properties to be classified as smokeless coal."
