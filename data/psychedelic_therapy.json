      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Psychedelic-assisted therapy has gained growing interest to improve a range of mental health outcomes. In response, numerous training programs have formed to train the necessary workforce to deliver psychedelic therapy. These include both legal and 'underground' (i.e., unregulated) programs that use psychedelics as part of their training. Prolonged adverse experiences (PAEs) may arise from psychedelic use, though they are poorly characterized in the clinical literature. Thus, understanding the potential harms related to psychedelic use is critical as psychedelic therapy training programs consider strategies to potentially integrate psychedelic use into therapy training. CASE PRESENTATION: We present the case of a psychologist who underwent psychedelic therapy training that involved repeated high doses of psilocybin-containing mushrooms and subsequently developed prolonged adverse effects including severe sleep impairment, anhedonia, and suicidal ideation requiring hospitalization. Despite worsening symptoms, her psychedelic therapy trainers advised her against seeking psychiatric support, delaying treatment. Ultimately, the patient's symptoms resolved after a course of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). CONCLUSIONS: This case highlights the tensions between legal and underground psychedelic use within psychedelic therapy training programs, psychiatry and neo-shamanism, and the use of psychiatric interventions (i.e., ECT) and energy medicine to address prolonged adverse effects from psychedelics. Clinicians should be aware of these potential conflicts between psychiatric conceptualizations of PAEs and frameworks maintained in psychedelic community practices and their impacts on patients' presenting symptoms, decision making, and emotional challenges.",

      "abstract": "The renewed interest in psychedelics as treatments for mental health disorders is often referred to as the \"Psychedelic Renaissance.\" This article assesses whether this resurgence truly constitutes a paradigm shift in psychiatry, as some proponents claim, or if it should be viewed as an integration of existing therapeutic approaches. We explore historical contexts, noting that psychedelics were extensively researched in the mid-20th century and argue that many of the current claims about their novelty overlook prior knowledge and research from that period. While psychedelics do introduce novel aspects, such as rapid therapeutic effects and unique modes of action, we challenge the idea of a full paradigm shift, suggesting that these developments are better understood as enhancements to existing frameworks rather than a wholesale replacement. We emphasize the importance of integrating psychedelics within a broader bio-psycho-social model of psychiatry, combining pharmacological, psychological, and contextual factors. The therapeutic potential of psychedelics in psychotherapy has previously been described as working as \"nonspecific amplifiers\" of psychological processes, rather than introducing entirely new mechanisms. We suggest a balanced, integrative approach that incorporates psychedelics into existing mental health care models, cautioning against \"psychedelic exceptionalism\" and the risk of overselling their potential as a revolutionary treatment.",

      "abstract": "Objective: To assess the viewpoints of psychedelic practitioners in research settings on approaches to psychological support for psychedelic treatments. Methods: An anonymous survey was distributed via email to contacts listed on ClinicalTrials.gov for clinical trials of psilocybin and LSD, personal contacts of authors, and through snowball sampling. The survey included Likert type, multiple choice, free response, and demographic items. Responses to survey items were coded to represent either emotive (emphasizing human and spiritual elements) or neuromodulatory (emphasizing biological drug effects) approaches to psychedelic treatment. Summative scores (\"E-Scores\") were determined to quantitatively represent preferences. Data were collected from March 2023 to July 2023. Results: Forty qualified respondents completed the survey. Respondents came from varying educational backgrounds (42.5% MD/DO and 57.5% other) and practiced in at least 4 countries, 11 U.S. states, and 16 institutions. Respondents had overseen a total of 1,656 psychedelic sessions (average = 41.4). There was a substantial range of response for many items (average range = 84.2% of maximum). Exploratory factor analysis identified 4 latent factors: The Importance of Trust, The Role of Spirituality, Creating an Emotional Setting, and Conceptualizing Negative Experiences. The average respondent held a slight preference for an emotive approach. Respondents who received training at the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS) or the California Institute of Integral Studies (CIIS) had significantly greater emotive preference compared to other respondents (P < .05). Conclusions: Among psychedelic researchers, there is no consensus on certain psychological support strategies for psychedelic treatments. There is an aggregate preference for an emotive approach to psychological support, which is higher among individuals receiving training at certain institutions.",

Data from patients in this program represent a unique opportunity to analyze the real-world practice of PAT. AIMS: This study compared the subjective effects of lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) and psilocybin between patients undergoing PAT and healthy volunteers. For the patients, it also investigated the relationship between antidepressant effects and six measures of acute drug effects. METHODS: We compared data on acute psychedelic drug effects between 28 PAT patients with data from 28 healthy participants who participated in a randomized, double-blind crossover trial. All participants received varying doses of psilocybin and LSD. Subjective effects were assessed on an hourly basis during the acute drug effects, and the Mystical Experience Questionnaire (MEQ) was completed retrospectively. For patients, depressive symptoms were assessed using the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS). RESULTS: Ratings of overall drug effect and mystical experience were similar across groups. Compared with healthy controls, patients reported lower ratings of ego dissolution. Patients showed a significant decrease in MADRS scores, and the greatest predictor of antidepressant outcome was relaxation during the PAT session. We did not observe a relationship between mystical-type experiences and antidepressant effects. Most patients experienced mild adverse effects which resolved within 48 h. CONCLUSION: PAT reduced depressive symptoms in this heterogeneous patient group. Patients may experience more challenging psychedelic effects and reduced ego dissolution. Hourly assessment of drug effects may predict clinical outcomes better than retrospectively assessed mystical experiences, and the impact of relaxation during PAT should be investigated further.",

      "abstract": "Psychoactive substances obtained from botanicals have been applied for a wide variety of purposes in the rituals of different cultures for thousands of years. Classical psychedelics from N,N'-dimethyltryptamine, psilocybin, mescaline and various lysergamides cause specific alterations in perception, emotion and cognition by acting through serotonin 5-HT2A receptor activation. Lysergic acid diethylamide, the first famous breakthrough in the field, was discovered by chance by Albert Hoffman in the Zurich Sandoz laboratory in 1943, and studies on its psychoactive effects began to take place in the literature. Studies in this area were blocked after the legislation controlling the use and research of psychedelic drugs came into force in 1967, but since the 1990s, it has started to be a matter of scientific curiosity again by various research groups. In particular, with the crucial reports of psychotherapy-assisted psilocybin applications for life-threatening cancer-related anxiety and depression, a new avenues have been opened in the treatment of psychiatric diseases such as treatment-resistant depression and substance addictions. An increasing number of studies show that psychedelics have a very promising potential in the treatment of neuropsychiatric diseases where the desired efficiency cannot be achieved with conventional treatment methods. In this context, we discuss psychedelic therapy, encompassing its historical development, therapeutic applications and potential treatment effects-especially in depression, trauma disorders and substance use disorders-within the framework of ethical considerations.",

Historically, psychiatric pathologies have been treated with small-molecule compounds that have limited effect sizes and carry a variety of adverse effect profiles. Psychedelic medicines offer the opportunity to provide more potent and rapidly acting treatments. It is crucial to note that this is an emerging field of medicine, and only one of these compounds (esketamine) is currently Food and Drug Administration-approved for depression.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Ketamine, an arylcyclohexylamine dissociative anesthetic agent, has evolved into a versatile therapeutic. It has a rapid-onset, well-understood cardiovascular effects and a favorable safety profile in clinical use. Its enantiomeric compound, esketamine, was approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 2019 for both treatment-resistant depression and major depressive disorder with suicidal ideation. AREAS OF UNCERTAINTY: Research indicates dose-dependent impacts on cognition, particularly affecting episodic and working memory following both acute administration and chronic use, albeit temporarily for the former and potentially persistent for the latter. Alongside acute risks to cardiovascular stability, ketamine use poses potential liver toxicity concerns, especially with prolonged or repeated exposure within short time frames. The drug's association with \"ketamine cystitis,\" characterized by bladder inflammation, adds to its profile of physiological risks. THERAPEUTIC ADVANCES: Data demonstrate a single intravenous infusion of ketamine exhibits antidepressant effects within hours (weighted effect size averages of depression scores (N = 518) following a single 0.5 mg/kg infusion of ketamine is d = 0.96 at 24 hours). Ketamine is also effective at reducing posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptom severity following repeated infusions (Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale scores: -11.88 points compared with midazolam control). Ketamine also decreased suicidal ideation in emergency settings (Scale for Suicidal Ideation scores: -4.96 compared with midazolam control). Through its opioid-sparing effect, ketamine has revolutionized postoperative pain management by reducing analgesic consumption and enhancing recovery. LIMITATIONS: Many studies indicate that ketamine's therapeutic effects may subside within weeks. Repeated administrations, given multiple times per week, are often required to sustain decreases in suicidality and depressive symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Ketamine's comprehensive clinical profile, combined with its robust effects on depression, suicidal ideation, PTSD, chronic pain, and other psychiatric conditions, positions it as a substantial contender for transformative therapeutic application.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: After becoming notorious for its use as a party drug in the 1980s, 3,4-methylenedioxy-methampetamine (MDMA), also known by its street names \"molly\" and \"ecstasy,\" has emerged as a powerful treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). AREAS OF UNCERTAINTY: There are extensive data about the risk profile of MDMA. However, the literature is significantly biased. Animal models demonstrating neurotoxic or adverse effects used doses well beyond the range that would be expected in humans (up to 40 mg/kg in rats compared with roughly 1-2 mg/kg in humans). Furthermore, human samples often comprise recreational users who took other substances in addition to MDMA, in uncontrolled settings. THERAPEUTIC ADVANCES: Phase III clinical trials led by the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS) have shown that MDMA-assisted psychotherapy has an effect size of d = 0.7-0.91, up to 2-3 times higher than the effect sizes of existing antidepressant treatments. 67%-71% of patients who undergo MDMA-assisted psychotherapy no longer meet the diagnostic criteria for PTSD within 18 weeks. We also describe other promising applications of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy for treating alcohol use disorder, social anxiety, and other psychiatric conditions. LIMITATIONS: Thus far, almost all clinical trials on MDMA have been sponsored by a single organization, MAPS. More work is needed to determine whether MDMA-assisted therapy is more effective than existing nonpharmacological treatments such as cognitive behavioral therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Phase III trials suggest that MDMA is superior to antidepressant medications for treating PTSD. Now that MAPS has officially requested the Food and Drug Administration to approve MDMA as a treatment for PTSD, legal MDMA-assisted therapy may become available as soon as 2024.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Ibogaine is a plant-derived alkaloid that has been used for thousands of years in rites of passage and spiritual ceremonies in West-Central Africa. In the West, it has primarily been used and studied for its anti-addictive properties and more recently for other neuropsychiatric indications, including post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, anxiety, and traumatic brain injury. AREAS OF UNCERTAINTY: Ibogaine requires careful patient screening and monitoring because of significant safety issues. There is potential for cardiotoxicity (prolonged QT interval); without rigorous screening, fatal arrhythmias may occur. However, preliminary research suggests that co-administration of ibogaine with magnesium may mitigate cardiotoxicity. Additionally, ibogaine may have dangerous interactions with opiates, so patients who receive ibogaine treatment for opioid use disorder must withdraw from long-acting opioids. Other potential concerning effects of ibogaine include rare incidences of mania or psychosis. Anticipated transient effects during ibogaine treatment can include ataxia, tremors, and gastrointestinal symptoms. THERAPEUTIC ADVANCES: Robust effects after a single treatment with ibogaine have been reported. In open-label and randomized controlled trials (RCTs), ibogaine reduces heroin and opioid cravings by upwards of 50%, up to 24 weeks after the treatment. An observational study of 30 Special Operations Forces veterans with mild traumatic brain injury reported that 86% were in remission from post-traumatic stress disorder, 83% from depression, and 83% from anxiety, one month after a single-dose ibogaine treatment. LIMITATIONS: Although there are several observational and open-label studies, there is only a single double-blind, placebo-controlled RCT on ibogaine. More RCTs with large sample sizes must be conducted to support ibogaine's safety and efficacy. CONCLUSIONS: Given the promising preliminary findings, ibogaine could potentially fill a much-needed gap in treatments for challenging conditions, including opioid dependence. Ibogaine's remarkable effects in traditionally treatment-resistant, combat-exposed individuals hints at its potential in broader populations with physical and psychological trauma.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The primary psychoactive drug in magic mushrooms, psilocybin, induces profound alterations in consciousness through the 5-HT2A receptor. This review consolidates current research findings to elucidate the pharmacology, safety profile, and clinical applications of psilocybin. AREAS OF UNCERTAINTY: Despite initial concerns that psilocybin could cause psychosis, contemporary research has demonstrated that psilocybin is generally safe. The most common adverse effects are nausea and headache, yet both tend to be transient. Serious adverse events can generally be avoided in controlled settings such as clinical trials. However, in the largest clinical trial to date, there were a total of 7 reported cases of suicidal ideation, up to 12 weeks after receiving a single 25 mg dose of psilocybin. That being said, all 7 cases did not respond to the treatment. Although selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors may blunt the hallucinogenic qualities of psilocybin, preliminary research suggests that they may enhance its antidepressant effects. THERAPEUTIC ADVANCES: In clinical trials, psilocybin has shown promise for treating major depressive disorder and treatment-resistant depression. Initial studies indicated that 42%-57% of patients underwent remission after psilocybin-assisted therapy, which suggests that psilocybin is more effective than existing antidepressant medications. Clinical data have also demonstrated that psilocybin can manage substance use disorders and end-of-life anxiety with clinical outcomes that are sustained for months and sometimes years after 1 or 2 doses. LIMITATIONS: However, larger Phase II trials with more than 100 depressed participants have shown a much smaller remission rate of 25%-29%, though these studies still observed that psilocybin causes a significant reduction in depressive symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Aside from ketamine, psilocybin is the most clinically well-researched psychedelic drug, with trials that have enrolled hundreds of participants and multiple therapeutic applications. Phase III trials will determine whether psilocybin lives up to the promise that it showed in previous clinical trials.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT) is a naturally occurring serotonergic psychedelic found in natural plants around the globe. As the main psychoactive component in ayahuasca, which also contains monoamine oxidase inhibitors, DMT has been consumed as plant-based brew by indigenous peoples for centuries. Further research is required to delineate the therapeutic utility of DMT. AREAS OF UNCERTAINTY: Although previous research has shown that DMT is synthesized endogenously, it may not be produced at physiologically relevant concentrations. Additionally, the phenomenological similarities between the DMT-induced state and near-death experiences led to the popular hypothesis that endogenous DMT is released during the dying process. However, this hypothesis continues to be debated. Generally, DMT and ayahuasca seem to be physiologically and psychiatrically safe, although ayahuasca is known to cause transient vomiting. THERAPEUTIC ADVANCES: A double-blind, randomized controlled trial showed that, within 1 week, ayahuasca causes remission in 36% of patients with treatment-resistant depression. According to top-line results from a recent phase IIa trial, 57% of patients with major depressive disorder experienced remission 12 weeks after receiving a single intravenous dose of DMT. LIMITATIONS: There has only been a single published double-blind randomized controlled trial on ayahuasca and 2 on DMT. All clinical trials have had small sample sizes (≤34 participants). DMT requires further research to understand its therapeutic and clinical potential as a psychedelic. CONCLUSIONS: Preliminary evidence indicates that ayahuasca and DMT may be more effective than existing antidepressants for treating major depressive disorder and treatment-resistant depression.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) is a hallucinogenic agent. In the mid-20th century, it was used to augment psychoanalysis and to treat alcohol use disorder. However, LSD was banned in 1970 in part because of concerns that it could bring about or exacerbate mental illness. Its therapeutic potential remains incompletely understood. AREAS OF UNCERTAINTY: While uncontrolled recreational use of LSD can, in rare instances, lead to long-term psychosis, adverse events in clinical trials of LSD, such as anxiety, headache, and nausea, have almost always been mild and transient. Serious adverse events, such as intense panic, suicidal ideation, and psychosis, were reported in either none or very few of the participants. However, patient selection criteria, optimal dosing strategy, and appropriate clinical follow-up guidelines remain to be established. THERAPEUTIC ADVANCES: Preliminary data suggest that LSD may be effective for the management of alcohol use disorder, anxiety, and depression. In trials of LSD for treating anxiety and depression associated with life-threatening illnesses, 77% of participants demonstrate durable relief at 1 year post-treatment. Top-line data from a large-scale phase IIb trial (n = 198) indicate that 50% of participants experience remission from generalized anxiety disorder after a single 100 μg dose of LSD. According to a meta-analysis of RCTs on LSD from the mid-20th century, single-dose regimens of LSD significantly improve alcohol use disorder (P < 0.0003) with an odds ratio (OR) of 1.96. LIMITATIONS: Only one large-scale clinical trial (>50 participants) has been conducted on LSD in the contemporary era of psychedelic research. Further studies with large sample sizes are needed to explore potential clinical applications. CONCLUSIONS: Preliminary data suggest that LSD may be one of the most potent treatments for anxiety in patients both with and without a life-threatening illness. LSD may also be beneficial for treating depression and substance use disorders.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Psychedelic drugs have recently emerged as plausibly effective pharmacological agents for the management of depression, anxiety, and other neuropsychiatric conditions, including those that are treatment-resistent. The latter half of the 20th century marked a revolution in the treatment of mental illnesses, exemplified by the introduction of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and other pharmacological agents. Nevertheless, mental illness remains a major public health crisis, affecting nearly one billion individuals worldwide. AREAS OF UNCERTAINTY: Because of the decades-long status of several psychedelics as Schedule I drugs, there have not been very many large, double-blind, randomized controlled trials of psychedelics. Owing to small sample sizes, there may be rare yet serious adverse events that have not been reported in the clinical trials thus far. THERAPEUTIC ADVANCES: Esketamine, a dissociative hallucinogen drug, was approved for the management of major depressive disorder by the Food and Drug Administration in 2019. As of January 2024, two Phase III trials of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), a synthetic drug that inhibits the serotonin transporter, have been completed; the results indicate that MDMA is superior to existing pharmacological treatments for post-traumatic stress disorder. A phase III trial of psilocybin, a naturally occurring serotonin receptor partial agonist, is currently underway. The following series details the current state of research in psychedelic therapeutics, including lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), N-N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT) and ayahuasca, psilocybin, ibogaine, MDMA, and ketamine. LIMITATIONS: While initial clinical trials of psychedelics for depression were very promising, trials of psilocybin with larger sample sizes (100+ participants) suggest that its remission rate is 25%-29%. This is about the same as the remission rate of antidepressants, which is roughly 30% according to the landmark STAR*D trial. CONCLUSIONS: Psychedelic drugs and structural derivatives offer a great deal of promise for the management of a wide range of psychiatric morbidities. It is imperative that clinicians become familiar with these novel agents and learn how to integrate psychedelic therapy with the rest of their care through open communication and referral.",

Qualitative research methods are increasingly used to understand patient's experiences; however, there is a lack of literature that explores psychedelic use from an occupational perspective. Purpose. To conduct a scoping review of qualitative literature on the experiences of psychedelic use for the purpose of mental health therapy, through an occupational lens. Key Issues. Wilcock's occupational perspective of health was employed to analyze the use of psychedelics in mental health from an occupational perspective. Despite heterogeneous therapy contexts and substances used, patients reported comparable benefits regarding occupational engagement, such as increased mindfulness and autonomy in doing, a renewed sense of being, greater motivation to grow and become, and an improved sense of connection and belonging. Implications. This review demonstrates how psychedelic use in the context of mental health support can be experienced as a meaningful occupation and may contribute to overall health. In turn, this review highlights the utility of an occupational perspective for \"non-sanctioned\" or stigmatized occupations like psychedelic use, as well as the need for more research on psychedelic use from an occupational perspective. Using an occupational perspective of health can help to de-stigmatize psychedelic use as a meaningful occupation, rather than a deviant one, and shed light on how psychedelics may also positively impact one's participation in everyday life and overall health.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is associated with significant patient burden. While pharmacotherapies and evidence-based psychotherapy interventions (EBPI) are effective, studies consistently highlight inadequate outcomes and high treatment dropout. Psychedelic therapy (PT) has shown preliminary promise across difficult-to-treat conditions, including MDMA-assisted therapy for PTSD, however trials of classical psychedelics in PTSD are lacking. Understanding patients' experiences of EBPI could help promote safety in PT. AIM: To systematically review qualitative research on patients' subjective experience of EBPI for PTSD, and of PT, and examine areas of overlap and divergence between them. METHODS: Systematic literature searches for studies published between 2010 and 2023 were conducted on OVID, PubMed, Web of Science, and PsycInfo. Included were original studies in English that presented qualitative data of patient experiences of EBPI in PTSD, or PT for any indication. Extracted data from included studies were analysed using thematic synthesis. Syntheses were completed separately for EBPI and PT, before similarities and differences between the therapies were identified. RESULTS: 40 research articles were included for review: 26 studies on EBPI for PTSD, and 14 studies on PT. EBPI studied were CBT, EMDR, CPT and PE. Psychedelic compounds studied were psilocybin, ibogaine, LSD, MDMA and ketamine, for treatment of substance use disorders, anxiety relating to physical illness, depression, and PTSD. Core themes from patient experiences of EBPI: 1) patient burden in PTSD treatment; 2) readiness; 3) key mechanisms of change; 4) psychological safety and trust. Themes identified in the review of PT: 1) indirect trauma processing; 2) reorganisation of self-narratives via processes of relatedness and identification; 3) key treatment characteristics. CONCLUSION: This study suggests overlap between patients' experience of EBPI and PT in terms of key mechanisms of change, the importance of psychological safety and readiness to engage in treatment. Trauma-informed care paradigms and practices may improve safety and acceptability of PT research."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To compare group and individual psychedelic-assisted therapy in terms of clinician time, costs and patient access. METHODS: Using 2023 data from two group therapy trial sites, one using 3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) to treat posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and one using psilocybin to treat major depressive disorder (MDD), we compared overall variable costs, clinician costs and clinician time required by therapy protocols utilizing groups versus individual patient therapy. Using published literature, we estimated the prevalence of adults with PTSD and MDD eligible for treatment with psychedelic therapy and projected the savings in time and cost required to treat these prevalent cases. RESULTS: Group therapy saved 50.9% of clinician costs for MDMA-PTSD and 34.7% for psilocybin-MDD, or $3,467 and $981 per patient, respectively. To treat all eligible PTSD and MDD patients in the U.S. in 10 years with group therapy, 6,711 fewer full-time equivalent (FTE) clinicians for MDMA-PTSD and 1,159 fewer for FTE clinicians for psilocybin-MDD would be needed, saving up to $10.3 billion and $2.0 billion respectively, discounted at 3% annually. CONCLUSION: Adopting group therapy protocols where feasible would significantly reduce the cost of psychedelic-assisted therapies. By enhancing the number of patients served per clinician, group therapy could also ameliorate the anticipated shortage of appropriately trained clinicians, thereby accelerating access to these promising new therapies."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Psychedelic substances have demonstrated promise in the treatment of depression, anxiety, and substance use disorders. Significant media coverage has been dedicated to psychedelic medicine, but it is unclear whether the public associates psilocybin with its potential therapeutic benefits. The COVID-19 pandemic led to an increase in depression, anxiety, and substance abuse in the general population. OBJECTIVE: This study attempts to link increases in interest in these disorders with increases in interest in psilocybin using Google Trends. METHODS: Weekly interest-over-time Google Trends data for 4 years, from the week of March 11, 2018, to the week of March 6, 2022, were obtained for the following terms: \"psilocybin,\" \"psychedelic therapy,\" \"cannabis,\" \"cocaine,\" \"antidepressant,\" \"depression,\" \"anxiety,\" and \"addiction.\" Important psilocybin-related news and the declaration of the pandemic were noted. Trends data for each of the queried terms were plotted, and multiple regression analysis was performed to determine the slope of the prepandemic and postpandemic data with 95% CIs. Nonparametric Tau-U analysis was performed correcting for baseline trends. Results from this test were used to make inferences about the pre- and postpandemic trends and inferences about the change in overall level of searches between the 2 groups. RESULTS: Tau values for prepandemic data were significant for stable trends, all ranging -0.4 to 0.4. Tau values for postpandemic data showed positive trends for \"psilocybin,\" \"psychedelic therapy,\" and \"antidepressant.\" All other trends remained stable in the range of -0.4 to 0.4. When comparing Tau values for pre- and postpandemic data, overall increases in relative search volume (RSV) were seen for \"psilocybin,\" \"psychedelic therapy,\" and \"anxiety,\" and overall decreases in RSV were seen for \"depression,\" \"addiction,\" and \"cocaine.\" Overall RSVs for \"cannabis\" and \"antidepressant\" remained stable as Tau values ranged between -0.4 and 0.4. In the immediate aftermath of the declaration of the pandemic, drop-offs in interest were seen for all terms except for \"anxiety\" and \"cannabis.\" After the initial shock of a global pandemic, \"psilocybin\" and \"psychedelic therapy\" groups demonstrated increases in interest trends and overall RSV. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that overall interest in \"psilocybin\" and \"psychedelic therapy\" increased at higher rates and to higher levels after than before the declaration of the pandemic. This is consistent with our hypothesis that interest increased for these treatments after the pandemic as incidence of depression, anxiety, and addiction increased. However, there may be other drivers of interest for these topics, since interest in antidepressants-the typical pharmacologic treatments for depression and anxiety-followed the expected pattern of drop-off and accelerated interest back to prepandemic levels. Interest in \"psilocybin\" and \"psychedelic therapy\" may have also been partially driven by popular culture hype and novelty, explaining why interest increased at a higher rate post pandemic and continued to grow, surpassing prior interest."

      "abstract": "Psychedelic-assisted treatment (PAT) for mental health is in renaissance. Psilocybin and MDMA stand near FDA approval, and US cities and states are decriminalizing or regulating the non-clinical use of psilocybin. However, neither FDA indications nor a regulated use model sufficiently address the complex needs and opportunities for an improved treatment of addiction. When paired with disability and social dispossession, addiction increasingly burdens informal care networks, public safety, and particularly healthcare systems. Stigma and mistreatment alienate people from opportunities for care and multiply the costs of providing care. This dynamic worsens socially determined resource limitations, enforcing stark ethical choices and perpetuating socioeconomic inequities, isolation, mental illness, medical illness, overdose, suicide, and violence. In order for psychedelic treatments to achieve their greatest utility to population health, we must intentionally develop regulatory, clinical, and payment systems supporting clinical research, rigorous safety monitoring, and implementation to address these immense needs and reduce the barriers to engagement for those who now bear the costs, including those who work at the front lines of addiction care. To achieve full fruition, I advocate for a collaborative approach, built from within networks of mutual social support but linked and accountable to public institutions charged with the equitable dissemination of these therapies for the greatest social and health equities. Rather than relegating PAT to the needs of the commercially insured or wellness markets, this is the moment to learn from ancient traditions of ritualized sacramental use, organized around faith in our mutual dependency and accountability, and to capture an opportunity to improve population health and equity. To miss this opportunity is to accept the status quo in the midst of a growing emergency, for lack of moral vision and intention to change our habits."

      "abstract": "Novel and traditional psychedelic medicines are attracting interest as potential treatments of mental illness. Before psychedelic therapies can be made available in culturally safe and effective ways to diverse peoples, the field must grapple with the complex legacies of colonialism and ongoing clashes between biomedical and Indigenous Ways of Knowing. This article presents results of a pilot program offering group-based therapy augmented by three sessions of ketamine at a psychedelic dose, for a group of Indigenous participants. This unique project was undertaken in partnership between Roots to Thrive and the Snuneymuxw First Nation to assess this approach's effectiveness and safety for Indigenous peoples. Thematic analysis of qualitative interviews and anonymous feedback received throughout the program from eight participants and two Elders provided rich information on participant motivations, perceived barriers, appreciated and beneficial aspects of the program, and the psychedelic experiences, as well as important directions for further improvement. In addition to challenges, participants attributed significant benefits to the program while highlighting the importance of the involvement of Indigenous team members, the incorporation of traditional approaches to healing, and the cultivation of open and authentic relationships between group participants and facilitators. We discuss important lessons learned and the essential work of reconciliation in, and beyond, psychedelic therapies.",

      "abstract": "Psychedelic-assisted therapy has attracted considerable clinical attention in the past decade for its ability to bring therapeutic benefits to patients in treatment-resistant categories. In contradistinction from other psychopharmaco-therapies, contemporary psychedelic therapists, like their predecessors, paid close attention to the 'set and setting', and argued that the mind-set of the subject and the conditions or environment of the session was as influential as the pharmacological reaction itself. In this paper, we examine how religious sounds and music were both incorporated into and strategically avoided in the early psychedelic therapeutic sessions in an effort to achieve spiritual epiphanies at peak experiences. Prominent contemporary practices, we conclude, recapitulate many of the practices of the past, relying, we argue, on aesthetic premises that could hinder the therapy's broader applicability."

In this review we will chart the research investigating the role of these interventions in individuals with addiction beginning with an overview of the current socioeconomic impact of addiction, treatment options, and outcomes. We will start by examining historical studies from the first psychedelic research era of the mid-late 1900s, followed by an overview of the available real-world evidence gathered from naturalistic, observational, and survey-based studies. We will then cover modern-day clinical trials of psychedelic therapies in addiction from first-in-human to phase II clinical trials. Finally, we will provide an overview of the different translational human neuropsychopharmacology techniques, including functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and positron emission tomography (PET), that can be applied to foster a mechanistic understanding of therapeutic mechanisms. A more granular understanding of the treatment effects of psychedelics will facilitate the optimisation of the psychedelic therapy drug development landscape, and ultimately improve patient outcomes."

      "abstract": "Background: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is an aggressive, terminal neurodegenerative disease that causes death of motor neurons and has an average survival time of 3-4 years. ALS is the most common motor neuron degenerative disease and is increasing in prevalence. There is a pressing need for more effective ALS treatments as available pharmacotherapies do not reverse disease progression or provide substantial clinical benefit. Furthermore, despite psychological distress being highly prevalent in ALS patients, psychological treatments remain understudied. Psychedelics (i.e., serotonergic psychedelics and related compounds like ketamine) have seen a resurgence of research into therapeutic applications for treating a multitude of neuropsychiatric conditions, including psychiatric and existential distress in life-threatening illnesses. Methods: We conducted a narrative review to examine the potential of psychedelic assisted-psychotherapy (PAP) to alleviate psychiatric and psychospiritual distress in ALS. We also discussed the safety of using psychedelics in this population and proposed putative neurobiological mechanisms that may therapeutically intervene on ALS neuropathology. Results: PAP has the potential to treat psychological dimensions and may also intervene on neuropathological dimensions of ALS. Robust improvements in psychiatric and psychospiritual distress from PAP in other populations provide a strong rationale for utilizing this therapy to treat ALS-related psychiatric and existential distress. Furthermore, relevant neuroprotective properties of psychedelics warrant future preclinical trials to investigate this area in ALS models. Conclusion: PAP has the potential to serve as an effective treatment in ALS. Given the lack of effective treatment options, researchers should rigorously explore this therapy for ALS in future trials.",

      "abstract": "The essential proposal of this text is that psychedelic-induced metaphysical experiences should be integrated and evaluated with recourse to metaphysics. It will be argued that there is a potential extra benefit to patients in psychedelic-assisted therapy if they are provided with an optional, additional, and intelligible schema and discussion of metaphysical options at the integrative phase of the therapy. This schema (the \"Metaphysics Matrix\") and a new Metaphysics Matrix Questionnaire (\"MMQ\") stemming therefrom will be presented, the latter of which can also be used as an alternative or additional tool for quantitative measurement of psychedelic experience in trials. Metaphysics is not mysticism, despite some overlap; and certainly not all psychedelic experience is metaphysical or mystical-all three terms will be defined and contrasted. Thereafter psychedelic therapy will be presented and analysed in order to reveal the missing place for metaphysics. Metaphysics, with epistemology (theory of knowledge) and axiology (ethics and aesthetics), is a defining branch of Philosophy. Metaphysics, in contrast to mysticism, is considered to be based on argument rather than pure revelation. Thus, in psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy one sees here the potential bridge between reason-based philosophy and practical therapy-or, more broadly, with psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy there is the potential and mutually beneficial fusion of philosophy with practical science."

Ibogaine has a very long history of ethnobotanical use in low doses to combat fatigue, hunger and thirst and, in high doses as a sacrament in African ritual contexts. In the 1960's, American and European self-help groups provided public testimonials that a single dose of ibogaine alleviated drug craving, opioid withdrawal symptoms, and prevented relapse for weeks, months and sometimes years. Ibogaine is rapidly demethylated by first-pass metabolism to a long-acting metabolite noribogaine. Ibogaine and its metabolite interact with two or more CNS targets simultaneously and both drugs have demonstrated predictive validity in animal models of addiction. Online forums endorse the benefits of ibogaine as an \"addiction interrupter\" and present-day estimates suggest that more than ten thousand people have sought treatment in countries where the drug is unregulated. Open label pilot studies of ibogaine-assisted drug detoxification have shown positive benefit in treating addiction. Ibogaine, granted regulatory approval for human testing in a Phase 1/2a clinical trial, joins the current landscape of psychedelic medicines in clinical development.",

The objective of this systematic review, inclusive of meta-analysis, is to examine recent clinical research on the therapeutic effects of classic psychedelics on depressive symptoms. METHODS: Fourteen psychedelic therapy studies, utilising psilocybin, ayahuasca, or LSD, were systematically reviewed. For the meta-analysis, standardised mean differences were calculated for seven randomised controlled trials. RESULTS: The systematic review indicated significant short- and long-term reduction of depressive symptoms in all conditions studied after administration of psilocybin, ayahuasca, or LSD, with psychological support. In the meta-analysis, symptom reduction was significantly indicated in three timepoints out of four, including 1-day, 1-week, and 3-5 weeks, supporting the results of the systematic review, with the exception of the 6-8 weeks follow-up point which was less conclusive. LIMITATIONS: The absence of required data for 2 studies necessitated the less precise use of graphical extraction and imputation. The small sample size in all but one study negatively affected the statistical power. None of the studies had long-term follow-up without also utilising the cross-over method, which did not allow for long-term results to be included in the meta-review. CONCLUSIONS: This review indicates an association between psychedelic therapy and significant reduction of depressive symptoms at several time points. However, the small number of studies, and low sample sizes, calls for careful interpretation of results. This suggests the need for more randomised clinical trials of psychedelic therapy, with larger and more diverse samples.",

Researchers and clinicians should take care to distinguish between medical, recreational, and spiritual uses to set clear boundaries and expectations for patients. Ethically fraught or stigmatizing terms should be replaced with terminology that is medically and scientifically descriptive and accurate. A medicalized linguistic framework around psychedelics will potentially yield benefits and mitigate risks. Replacing colloquial names with scientific names for medicines and therapies may help correct misconceptions about psychedelics commonly held by both professionals and the public. A harmonized medical lexicon will also provide a common language for important instances of communication-such as the informed consent process-between professionals and participants. Our recommendations draw upon communications research in addiction medicine and aim to encourage the development, acceptance, and implementation of non-stigmatizing terminology in psychedelic research and treatment."

While psychedelic therapy shows promise for a range of mental health concerns, including suicidality, not all psychedelic therapy trials have published their suicidality results and no meta-analysis has been published on the topic. Therefore, we completed the first meta-analysis of patient-level data on the effects of psychedelics on suicidality. Data Sources: We conducted a systematic search of MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and PubMed for all psychedelic therapy clinical trials (last search: November 5, 2020). Study Selection: We identified all psychedelic therapy trials that included a measure or measure-item that assesses suicidality. Data Extraction: Suicidality data were requested from study authors and extracted using a data extraction form developed for this study. Results: We identified 8, and successfully collected data from 7, relevant trials. Analysis of standardized mean differences (SMDs) indicated that, relative to baseline, psychedelic therapy was associated with large effect sizes for acute (80-240 min) and sustained (1 day, 1-8 weeks, and 3-4 months) decreases in suicidality (SMD range = -1.48 to -2.36; 95% CI range, -4.30 to 0.23). At 6 months, the effect size was medium (SMD = -0.65; 95% CI, -1.14 to -0.16). Reductions in suicidality were significant at all time points except for 7-8 weeks. Acute and post-acute elevations in suicidality were rare (6.5% and 3.0%, respectively). Conclusions: Limitations include heterogeneous samples and interventions, as well as limited sample size and number of studies. Results provide preliminary support for the safety of psychedelic therapy and its positive effect on suicidality. Controlled trials that specifically evaluate the effect of psychedelic therapy on suicidality may be warranted.",

      "abstract": "Accumulating clinical evidence shows that psychedelic therapy, by synergistically combining psychopharmacology and psychological support, offers a promising transdiagnostic treatment strategy for a range of disorders with restricted and/or maladaptive habitual patterns of emotion, cognition and behavior, notably, depression (MDD), treatment resistant depression (TRD) and addiction disorders, but perhaps also anxiety disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and eating disorders. Despite the emergent transdiagnostic evidence, the specific clinical dimensions that psychedelics are efficacious for, and associated underlying neurobiological pathways, remain to be well-characterized. To this end, this review focuses on pre-clinical and clinical evidence of the acute and sustained therapeutic potential of psychedelic therapy in the context of a transdiagnostic dimensional systems framework. Focusing on the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) as a template, we will describe the multimodal mechanisms underlying the transdiagnostic therapeutic effects of psychedelic therapy, traversing molecular, cellular and network levels. These levels will be mapped to the RDoC constructs of negative and positive valence systems, arousal regulation, social processing, cognitive and sensorimotor systems. In summarizing this literature and framing it transdiagnostically, we hope we can assist the field in moving toward a mechanistic understanding of how psychedelics work for patients and eventually toward a precise-personalized psychedelic therapy paradigm."

Current treatments have recognized limitations; in this context, new ones that are prophylactic and effective across diagnostic boundaries would represent a major advance. The view that there exists a core of transdiagnostic overlap between psychiatric disorders has re-emerged in recent years, and evidence that psychedelic therapy holds promise for a range of psychiatric disorders supports the position that it may be transdiagnostically effective. Here, we propose that psychedelic therapy's core, transdiagnostically relevant action lies in its ability to increase neuronal and mental plasticity, thus enhancing the potential for change, which we consider to be a key to its therapeutic benefits. Moreover, we suggest that enhanced plasticity via psychedelics, combined with a psychotherapeutic approach, can aid healthy adaptability and resilience, which are protective factors for long-term well-being. We present candidate neurological and psychological markers of this plasticity and link them with a predictive processing model of the action of psychedelics. We propose that a model of psychedelic-induced plasticity combined with an adequate therapeutic context has prophylactic and transdiagnostic potential, implying that it could have a broad, positive impact on public health."

      "abstract": "Mounting evidence supports the serotonin 2A receptor agonist psilocybin as a psychiatric pharmacotherapy. Little research has experimentally examined how session \"set and setting\" impacts subjective and therapeutic effects. We analyzed the effects of the musical genre played during sessions of a psilocybin study for tobacco smoking cessation. Participants (N = 10) received psilocybin (20-30 mg/70 kg) in two sessions, each with a different musical genre (Western classical versus overtone-based), with the order counterbalanced. Participants chose one genre for a third session (30 mg/70 kg). Mystical experiences scores tended to be higher in overtone-based sessions than in Western classical sessions. Six of ten participants chose the overtone-based music for a third session. Biologically confirmed smoking abstinence was similar based on musical choice, with a slight benefit for participants choosing the overtone-based playlist (66.7% versus 50%). These data call into question whether Western classical music typically used in psychedelic therapy holds a unique benefit. Broadly, we call for experimentally examining session components toward optimizing psychedelic therapeutic protocols."

      "abstract": "Bonny Method of Guided Imagery and Music emerged following discontinuation of psychedelic therapy research in the early 1970s, but psychedelic therapy research has since revived. Music remains a vital component. This study examined participants' experiences of music in psychedelic therapy research. A rapid review of qualitative and quantitative journal articles in four major databases was conducted in February to April, 2019, using the terms hallucinogens, psychedelic, \"lysergic acid diethylamide,\" psilocybin, ayahuasca, music, and/or \"music therapy.\" Of 406 articles retrieved, 10 were included (n = 180; 18-69 years old). Participants had varied backgrounds. Music was widely considered integral for meaningful emotional and imagery experiences and self-exploration during psychedelic therapy. Music transformed through its elicitation of anthropomorphic, transportive, synesthetic, and material sensations. Music could convey love, carry listeners to other realms, be something to \"hold,\" inspire, and elicit a deep sense of embodied transformation. Therapeutic influence was especially evident in music's dichotomous elicitations: Music could simultaneously anchor and propel. Participant openness to music and provision of participant-centered music were associated with optimal immediate and longer-term outcomes. Many studies reported scarce details about the music used and incidental findings of music experienced. Further understanding of participants' idiosyncratic and shared responses to music during drug therapy phases will inform optimal development of flexible music protocols which enhance psychedelic therapy. Music therapists could be involved in the psychedelic therapy research renaissance through assisting with research to optimize music-based protocols used. If psychedelics become approved medicines, music therapists may be involved in offering psychedelic therapy as part of therapeutic teams.",

This article presents a conceptual model that specifies potential psychological mechanisms underlying such change, and that shows substantial parallels between psychedelic therapy and cognitive behavioral therapy: We propose that in the carefully controlled context of psychedelic therapy as applied in contemporary clinical research, psychedelic-induced belief relaxation can increase motivation for acceptance via operant conditioning, thus engendering episodes of relatively avoidance-free exposure to greatly intensified private events. Under these unique learning conditions, relaxed avoidance-related beliefs can be exposed to corrective information and become revised accordingly, which may explain long-term increases in acceptance and corresponding reductions in psychopathology. Open research questions and implications for clinical practice are discussed."

The prospect that psychedelics may again be integrated into mainstream psychiatry has aroused interest in long-forgotten research and experience from the previous phase of psychedelic therapy, which lasted from the late 1940s to the 1970s. This article will discuss one large-scale psychedelic therapy programme at Modum Bad Nervesanatorium, a psychiatric clinic which treated 379 inpatients with psychedelic drugs during the years 1961-76. The psychiatrists there initially regarded the psychedelic treatment as efficacious and without serious negative reactions, but reports of long-term harm have since surfaced. This article discusses how insights from Modum Bad might benefit the new generation of psychedelic treatment efforts.",

      "abstract": "Psychedelic drugs, often referred to as hallucinogens, are quite distinct from other classes of psychotropic drugs. Although the subjective and behavioral effects they induce are quite dramatic, they possess little addictive potential when compared to nicotine, alcohol or opiates. Since the discovery of ketamine antidepressant effects, there has been growing interest for these molecules. Serotonergic psychedelics such as psilocybin and lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) are gaining attention as potential treatments for depression and addiction, similarly to 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and ibogaine for addiction. Although they possess distinct pharmacological profiles, their kinetics of action are quite similar: the therapeutic effects are felt within the hours following administration, and last well beyond drug elimination by the organism. This strongly suggests the induction of neurogenic and plastic mechanisms, including the involvement of trophic factors. This review will explore the literature dealing with the effects of psychedelics on neurotrophins, as well as the plastic adaptations that they induce, in an attempt to understand their surprising therapeutic potential. We will show that although ketamine and serotonergic psychedelics have affinity for very different receptors (NMDA, 5-HT2A), they ultimately initiate similar plastic adaptations in the prefrontal cortex through the involvement of the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). We will see that although MDMA uses the same receptors as serotonergic psychedelics to alleviate PTSD symptoms, its effect on BDNF levels seem paradoxical and quite different. Finally, we show how ibogaine could exert its anti-addictive properties through a completely different neurotrophic factor than other psychedelic drugs, the glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF). While the current literature concerning the psychiatric applications of psychedelic therapy is encouraging, it remains to be determined whether their benefits could be obtained without their psychotomimetic effects, or concerns over potential toxicity.",

      "abstract": "Humans have used serotonergic hallucinogens (i.e. psychedelics) for spiritual, ceremonial, and recreational purposes for thousands of years, but their administration as part of a structured therapeutic intervention is still a relatively novel practice within Western medical and psychological frameworks. In the mid-20th century, considerable advances were made in developing therapeutic approaches integrating administration of low (psycholytic) and high (psychedelic) doses of serotonergic hallucinogens for treatment of a variety of conditions, often incorporating psychoanalytic concepts prevalent at that time. This work contributed seminal insights regarding how these substances may be employed with efficacy and safety in targeted therapeutic interventions, including the importance of optimizing set (frame of mind) and setting (therapeutic environment). More recently, clinical and pharmacological research has revisited the effects and therapeutic potential of psychedelics utilizing a variety of approaches. The current article provides an overview of past and present models of psychedelic therapy, and discusses important considerations for future interventions incorporating the use of psychedelics in research and clinical practice.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Recent pilot trials suggest feasibility and potential efficacy of psychedelic-facilitated addiction treatment interventions. Fifteen participants completed a psilocybin-facilitated smoking cessation pilot study between 2009 and 2015. AIMS: The aims of this study were as follows: (1) to identify perceived mechanisms of change leading to smoking cessation in the pilot study; (2) to identify key themes in participant experiences and long-term outcomes to better understand the therapeutic process. METHODS: Participants were invited to a retrospective follow-up interview an average of 30 months after initial psilocybin sessions. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 12 of the 15 participants. Data were analysed using thematic analysis. RESULTS: Participants reported gaining vivid insights into self-identity and reasons for smoking from their psilocybin sessions. Experiences of interconnectedness, awe, and curiosity persisted beyond the duration of acute drug effects. Participants emphasised that the content of psilocybin experiences overshadowed any short-term withdrawal symptoms. Preparatory counselling, strong rapport with the study team, and a sense of momentum once engaged in the study treatment were perceived as vital additional factors in achieving abstinence. In addition, participants reported a range of persisting positive changes beyond smoking cessation, including increased aesthetic appreciation, altruism, and pro-social behaviour. CONCLUSIONS: The findings highlight the value of qualitative research in the psychopharmacological investigation of psychedelics. They describe perceived connections between drug- and non-drug factors, and provide suggestions for future research trial design and clinical applications.",

This paper examines the existing evidence for the meaning-enhancing properties of psychedelics, and argues that the tendency of these agents to enhance the perception of significance offers valuable clues to explaining their reported ability to stimulate a variety of therapeutic processes, enhance creativity, and instigate mystical-type experiences. Building upon previous research, which suggested the potential role of psychedelic meaning-enhancement in enhancing placebo response, the paper explores the mechanisms by which the meaning-amplifying properties of psychedelics might also play a role in enhancing creativity, as well as in effecting mystical-type experiences. The wider social and public-health implications of this hypothesis are discussed, and suggestions are made as to the various ways in which scientific understanding of the meaning-enhancing properties of psychedelics might be advanced and utilized."

      "abstract": "RATIONALE: Recent studies have supported the safety and efficacy of psychedelic therapy for mood disorders and addiction. Music is considered an important component in the treatment model, but little empirical research has been done to examine the magnitude and nature of its therapeutic role. OBJECTIVES: The present study assessed the influence of music on the acute experience and clinical outcomes of psychedelic therapy. METHODS: Semi-structured interviews inquired about the different ways in which music influenced the experience of 19 patients undergoing psychedelic therapy with psilocybin for treatment-resistant depression. Interpretative phenomenological analysis was applied to the interview data to identify salient themes. In addition, ratings were given for each patient for the extent to which they expressed \"liking,\" \"resonance\" (the music being experienced as \"harmonious\" with the emotional state of the listener), and \"openness\" (acceptance of the music-evoked experience). RESULTS: Analyses of the interviews revealed that the music had both \"welcome\" and \"unwelcome\" influences on patients' subjective experiences. Welcome influences included the evocation of personally meaningful and therapeutically useful emotion and mental imagery, a sense of guidance, openness, and the promotion of calm and a sense of safety. Conversely, unwelcome influences included the evocation of unpleasant emotion and imagery, a sense of being misguided and resistance. Correlation analyses showed that patients' experience of the music was associated with the occurrence of \"mystical experiences\" and \"insightfulness.\" Crucially, the nature of the music experience was significantly predictive of reductions in depression 1 week after psilocybin, whereas general drug intensity was not. CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates that music plays a central therapeutic function in psychedelic therapy.",

      "abstract": "Psilocybin is a classic (serotonergic) hallucinogen (\"psychedelic\" drug) that may occasion mystical experiences (characterized by a profound feeling of oneness or unity) during acute effects. Such experiences may have therapeutic value. Research and clinical applications of psychedelics usually include music listening during acute drug effects, based on the expectation that music will provide psychological support during the acute effects of psychedelic drugs, and may even facilitate the occurrence of mystical experiences. However, the features of music chosen to support the different phases of drug effects are not well-specified. As a result, there is currently neither real guidance for the selection of music nor standardization of the music used to support clinical trials with psychedelic drugs across various research groups or therapists. A description of the features of music found to be supportive of mystical experience will allow for the standardization and optimization of the delivery of psychedelic drugs in both research trials and therapeutic contexts. To this end, we conducted an anonymous survey of individuals with extensive experience administering psilocybin or psilocybin-containing mushrooms under research or therapeutic conditions, in order to identify the features of commonly used musical selections that have been found by therapists and research staff to be supportive of mystical experiences within a psilocybin session. Ten respondents yielded 24 unique recommendations of musical stimuli supportive of peak effects with psilocybin, and 24 unique recommendations of musical stimuli supportive of the period leading up to a peak experience. Qualitative analysis (expert rating of musical and music-theoretic features of the recommended stimuli) and quantitative analysis (using signal processing and music-information retrieval methods) of 22 of these stimuli yielded a description of peak period music that was characterized by regular, predictable, formulaic phrase structure and orchestration, a feeling of continuous movement and forward motion that slowly builds over time, and lower perceptual brightness when compared to pre peak music. These results provide a description of music that may be optimally supportive of peak psychedelic experiences. This description can be used to guide the selection and composition of music for future psychedelic research and therapy sessions."

      "abstract": "Ketamine is a prescription drug used for general anesthesia. In subanesthetic doses, it induces profound psychedelic experiences and hallucinations. The subanesthetic effect of ketamine was the hypothesized therapeutic mechanism in the authors' use of ketamine-assisted psychotherapy for alcoholism. The results of a controlled clinical trial demonstrated a considerable increase in efficacy of the authors' standard alcoholism treatment when supplemented by ketamine psychedelic therapy (KPT). Total abstinence for more than one year was observed in 73 out of 111 (65.8%) alcoholic patients in the KPT group, compared to 24% (24 out of 100 patients) of the conventional treatment control group (p < 0.01). The authors' studies of the underlying psychological mechanisms of KPT have indicated that ketamine-assisted psychedelic therapy of alcoholic patients induces a harmonization of the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI) personality profile, positive transformation of nonverbalized (mostly unconscious) self-concept and emotional attitudes to various aspects of self and other people, positive changes in life values and purposes, important insights into the meaning of life and an increase in the level of spiritual development. Most importantly, these psychological changes were shown to favor a sober lifestyle. The data from biochemical investigations showed that pharmacological action of KPT affects both monoaminergic and opioidergic neurotransmitter metabolism, i.e., those neurochemical systems which are involved in the pathogenesis of alcohol dependence. The data from EEG computer-assisted analysis demonstrated that ketamine increases theta activity in cerebrocortical regions of alcoholic patients. This is evidence of the reinforcement of limbic cortex interaction during KPT session.",
