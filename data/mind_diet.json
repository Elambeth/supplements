      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Postpartum depressive symptoms (PPD) create negative and destructive changes in the mother's mood and disrupts the family atmosphere and raising the child in a healthy relationship with the mother. However, to date, no study has been found that investigated the relationship between the Mediterranean-DASH Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay diet (Mind diet) and PPD in women. Therefore, the present study aimed to investigate the association between MIND diet and PPD. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted on 214 women (2-8 weeks after childbirth) who were referred to comprehensive health service centers. Data were collected using Edinburgh postnatal depression scale (EPDS), Beck, and semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaires including 148 food items (FFQ). After collecting the data and scoring them, analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) and regression logistic analyses were done to determine the relationship between postpartum depressive symptoms and mind diet. RESULTS: According to the results, the prevalence of postpartum depressive symptoms was 15.4%. In the adjusted model, the mean and standard deviation of postpartum depressive symptoms scores in the third tertile were significantly lower than the first one (P < 0.001). Moreover, the adjusted model of logistic regression analysis showed that the chance of postpartum depressive symptoms was significantly lower in those who had the more following MIND diet compared to those who had less following (OR: 0.04, 95% CI: 0.006-0.37; P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, following the MIND diet was inversely associated with the likelihood of postpartum depressive symptoms.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The Mediterranean and Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diets have been shown to slow cognitive decline. However, these diets were not originally developed with dementia prevention as their primary focus. In contrast, the Mediterranean-DASH Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay (MIND) diet was specifically designed based on evidence linking individual dietary components to brain health and the prevention of cognitive decline. The aim of this research was to test the effectiveness of the MIND diet on cognitive function, mood, and quality of life using the Behaviour Change Wheel, and to design an intervention using the COM-B model to promote the MIND diet at midlife. METHODS: An online pilot randomised control trial (RCT) was conducted. Forty-one participants (aged 40-55 years, male and female) were randomised into a MIND diet with support group (n = 15), MIND diet group with no support (n = 14) or control group (n = 12) for 12 weeks. Baseline and follow-up measures of cognitive function, mood, quality of life (QOL) and adherence to MIND diet was assessed in each group. Capability, opportunity, and motivation (COM-B) towards MIND diet behaviour were also assessed pre and post intervention. RESULTS: A repeated measures ANOVA showed that in comparison to the control group, both intervention groups significantly improved mood, quality of life, MIND diet score and all COM-B components at follow-up (p < 0.05). No significant differences or interactions in cognitive function were found between groups. CONCLUSION: There are only two RCT's that test the effectiveness of the MIND diet on cognitive function, and this is the first RCT to assess the usefulness of the COM-B in increasing adherence to the MIND diet. Future interventions with longer duration are needed to establish an association with MIND diet and cognitive function in adults at midlife. This study recommends using less Behaviour Change Techniques (BCTs) with a focus on self-monitoring, goal setting and education on diet as an effective strategy for promoting adherence to the MIND diet.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The Mediterranean-Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay (MIND) diet slows cognitive decline and protects brain health, but the mechanisms are poorly understood. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to determine the plasma proteins associated with the MIND diet score and their ability to predict incident dementia in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study. METHODS: We analyzed 10,230 Black and White participants at visit 3 (1993-1995) with food frequency questionnaire and proteomics data and randomly divided them into discovery (n = 6850) and replication (n = 3380) samples. We examined associations between the MIND diet score and 4955 proteins using multivariable linear regression and elastic net regression. C-statistics were calculated to assess if proteins improved the prediction of high MIND diet adherence beyond participant characteristics. Cox proportional hazards models were used to assess associations between significant diet-related proteins and incident dementia over 2 decades. C-statistics assessed the ability of significant proteins to improve dementia prediction beyond known risk factors. RESULTS: Of 316 proteins associated with the MIND diet score in the discovery sample at a false discovery rate <0.05, 62 were internally replicated. Of these, 21 proteins selected by the elastic net individually improved MIND diet score prediction. After a median follow-up of 21 y, there were 2311 dementia cases. Five diet-related proteins, thrombospondin-2 [hazard ratio (HR): 1.19; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.11, 1.29], protein ABHD14A (HR: 1.23; 95% CI: 1.11, 1.37), structural maintenance of chromosomes protein 3 (HR: 1.19; 95% CI: 1.08, 1.31), epidermal growth factor receptor (HR: 0.68; 95% CI: 0.53, 0.86), and interleukin-12 subunit beta (HR: 1.14; 95% CI: 1.05, 1.25) were significantly associated with incident dementia. All 5 proteins individually and together improved the prediction of dementia risk. CONCLUSIONS: Using high-throughput proteomics, we identified candidate biomarkers of the MIND diet score and incident dementia, which are implicated in neural signaling, angiogenesis, and anti-inflammatory pathways."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The rising prevalence of youth depression underscores the need to identify modifiable factors for prevention and intervention. This study aims to investigate the protective role of Mediterranean-DASH Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay (MIND) diet on depressive symptoms in adolescents. METHODS: Participants were identified from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development study. Adherence to the MIND diet was measured by the Child Nutrition Assessment or the Block Kids Food Screener. Depressive symptoms were measured annually using the Child Behavior Checklist's depression subscale. We utilized regression analyses and cross-lagged panel modeling (CLPM) to examine longitudinal associations. Additional analyses adjusted for polygenic risk scores for depression, and changes in Body Mass Index (BMI) and waist-to-height ratio. RESULTS: Of the 8459 children (52.3 % male; mean age 10.9 [SD, 0.6] years), 2338 (27.6 %) demonstrated high MIND diet adherence, while 2120 (25.1 %) showed low adherence. High adherence was prospectively associated with reduced depressive symptoms (adjusted β, -0.64, 95 % CI, -0.73 to -0.55; p < 0.001) and 46 % lower odds of clinically relevant depression (adjusted odds ratio, 0.54, 95 % CI, 0.39 to 0.75; p < 0.001) at two-year follow-up. CLPM analyses showed significant cross-lag paths from MIND diet scores to less depressive symptoms across three time points. These associations persisted independently of changes in BMI and waist-to-height ratios, and were not significantly moderated by genetic predisposition to depression. CONCLUSIONS: Higher adherence to the MIND dietary pattern was longitudinally associated with decreased risk of depressive symptoms in adolescents. Promoting MIND diet may represent a promising strategy for depression prevention in adolescent populations.",

The present study aimed to examine the efficacy of MIND (Mediterranean-DASH Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay) diet on the anthropometric measurements, sleep quality, depression, anxiety, and serum levels of cortisol and brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in type 2 diabetic women with insomnia. This randomized controlled trial (RCT) involved 44 type 2 diabetic women with insomnia, aged 30 to 65 years, who were randomly assigned to be under the MIND low-calorie diet (n = 22) or a low-calorie diet (LCD) as the control group (n = 22) for 12 weeks. The above-mentioned variables were assessed at the beginning and the end of intervention. Following the MIND diet for 12 weeks accompanied by the significant decrease of waist circumference and significant improvement of sleep quality, depression, and anxiety compared to the control group. In addition, the MIND diet vs. LCD group exhibited a significant reduction in the cortisol levels and a significant increase in BDNF. This study provides promising evidence of the effectiveness of the MIND diet in improving the sleep quality, mental health, and some related biochemical parameters in diabetic women with insomnia.Trial registration: IRCT20181111041611N8.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: In contrast to existing evidence focusing on high-income countries, this study offers novel insights into the demographic and geographical context that have yet to be explored in the existing literature. Comparatively, in Pakistan, cognitive impairment is one of the neglected disorders that can develop into dementia and Alzheimer's disease. As no treatment is available, lifestyle modifications are a valid intervention for cognitive health. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the relationship between physical functionality, adherence to the Mediterranean-DASH diet Intervention for Neurological Delay (MIND), and cognitive impairment among elderly individuals in Pakistan. METHODS: From January to June 2023, this cross-sectional study recruited 462 participants aged 65 and above. We used proven tools in gerontological research, such as the MIND diet quiz and Quick Physical Activity Rating scale (QPAR), to evaluate diet and physical activity levels. Cognitive function was assessed using the Mini-Mental State Examination. RESULTS: Our analysis revealed that 26.40% of the participants had mild cognitive impairment, whereas 48.50% demonstrated low adherence to the MIND diet. The mean QPAR score was 20.51 ± 18.77. A significant association was found between lower physical activity levels and increased cognitive impairment (adjusted odds ratio 9.94, confidence interval (CI): 6.07-16.27). Additionally, higher adherence to the MIND diet correlated with reduced cognitive impairment (odds ratio 0.29, CI: 0.18-0.46). CONCLUSIONS: These findings highlight the critical role of diet and physical activity in cognitive health among the elderly population. The study emphasizes the need for targeted public health interventions and further longitudinal research to explore the long-term effects of these factors on cognitive health."

This study aimed to examine the relationship between the Mediterranean-DASH intervention for neurodegenerative delay (MIND) diet, chronotype and lifestyle factors in different types of overweight and obese people. 1100 obese individuals participated in this cross-sectional study. Compliance with the MIND diet was questioned, anthropometric measurements were taken, and biochemical parameter results from patient records in the last week were examined. Chronotypes were determined with the \"A self-assessment questionnaire to determine morningness in human circadian rhythms\" scale. MIND diet score was inversely associated with the body mass index (BMI) [β (SE) = -0.239 (0.11), p = 0.31] and waist circumference [β (SE) = -0.026 (0.01), p = 0.028], explained 0.4% of BMI and 0.6% of WC. There was a significant relationship between poorer MIND diets and higher CRP levels. A positive correlation was found between an increased MEQ score and MIND diet only in overweight participants (correlation coefficient = 0.200, p < 0.05). Whole cereals and fish consumption were positively associated with chronotype scores, while the highest odds of red meats and fast/fried foods seemed to have a negative effect. As a result, it has been observed that individuals with a morning chronotype have higher compliance with the MIND diet and make healthier food choices. Both having a morning chronotype and complying with the MIND diet have been associated with improvements in biochemical parameters in overweight and obese people.",

      "abstract": "In 2022, healthy sleep was included as part of Life's Essential 8, which are a cluster of fundamental factors for cardiovascular health. In many studies, sleep duration and/or quality have also been found to be related to human health. The purpose of this narrative review was to present the relationship between the Mediterranean diet, the DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) diet, and the MIND (Mediterranean-DASH Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay) diet and sleep quality and duration in different populations. A literature search was conducted based on the phrases \"Mediterranean diet\", \"DASH diet\", and \"MIND diet\" appearing together with \"sleep\" or \"insomnia\" in papers' titles or abstracts. Studies on obstructive sleep apnea or shift work were excluded. The electronic databases were searched via EBSCOhost. Main results: The vast majority of studies showed that there was a beneficial association between the three diets discussed in this review and sleep duration and/or quality; however, most of these results were obtained in cross-sectional analyses. There were only a few studies in which an association between sleep parameters and these diets was not observed. Direction for future studies: Taking into account the significant role of adequate sleep quality in various diseases, even in all-cause mortality, the implementation of randomized controlled trials and prospective cohort studies seems to be necessary to provide further evidence that would allow these associations to be confirmed. In conclusion, the results obtained so far in various populations strongly suggest that healthy dietary patterns abundant in plant foods, are associated with better sleep quality, as well as with a more adequate length of sleep.",

METHODS: The analyses included 4824 participants (73% men, mean age = 61; SD = 5.9) from the British Whitehall II cohort study. The MIND diet scores were derived from a validated 127-item food frequency questionnaire in 2002-2004. DepSs were assessed by the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (score ≥ 16) or by use of antidepressant drugs, and recurrence was defined as having DepSs in at least two of the four repeated measurements in the 2002-2004, 2007-2009, 2012-2013, and 2015-2016 follow-up phases. RESULTS: Recurrent DepSs were observed in 13.3% of the participants over 13 years of follow-up. After adjusting for potential confounders, participants in the highest tertile of the MIND diet score (where a higher score represents a higher diet quality) had 26% lower odds of experiencing recurrent DepSs (OR = 0.74; 95% CI 0.58-0.93) compared to those in the lowest tertile. In mutually adjusted analyses of 14 MIND diet components in relation to recurrent DepSs, independent associations were observed for green leafy vegetables (OR = 0.59, 95% CI: 0.45-0.78), other vegetables (OR = 0.43, 95% CI:0.24-0.77), and berries (OR = 0.74, 95% CI: 0.61-0.89). CONCLUSIONS: In this British prospective cohort, good adherence to the MIND diet, particularly to the recommendations for vegetables and berries, was associated with a lower risk of recurrent depressive symptoms, independent of socio-economic, health behavior, and health status factors, including baseline cognitive impairment and antecedents of DepSs.",

Dietary adherence is assessed with the MIND diet scoring system, which is currently based on the American diet and serving sizes. It is known that serving sizes and consumed food products differ between countries. Existing literature lacks reporting on food products included within the MIND diet and weight or volume equivalents corresponding to MIND diet servings, impeding accurate comparisons across studies. This study sought to overcome these limitations by evaluating MIND food products consumed in the Dutch context and developing a scoring system based on consumed quantities in weight or volume amounts rather than in standard serving amounts. The third objective was to modify an existing Dutch brief FFQ (Eetscore-FFQ) to evaluate adherence to the MIND diet. We translated nine of the fifteen MIND food groups directly to grams and volumes using the United States Department of Agriculture measurement conversion table. For the remaining food groups, we employed indirect translation to align them as closely as possible to the original MIND diet. These translated quantities in weight and volumes amounts were subsequently rounded to the nearest Dutch household measures, resulting in the culturally adapted MIND-NL diet scoring. The development of the MIND-NL-Eetscore-FFQ, comprising seventy-two food items (forty-one questions), is described. Our adaption approach is reproducible and can be used to customize the MIND diet scoring system to other cultures."

      "abstract": "Few studies investigated the association between Mediterranean-DASH Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay (MIND) diet and metabolic health status, particularly among adolescents. The present study was designed to investigate the association of MIND diet with metabolic health status in Iranian adolescents with overweight/obesity. This cross-sectional study was done among 203 adolescents with overweight/obesity (12-18 years) in Isfahan, Iran. A validated FFQ was applied to collect dietary intakes. Anthropometric indices and blood pressure were also measured by standard procedures. Fasting blood samples were obtained to determine serum insulin, glucose and lipid profile. To categorise participants as being with metabolically healthy overweight/obesity (MHO) or metabolically unhealthy overweight/obesity (MUO), two methods including International Diabetes Federation (IDF) criteria and IDF plus Homeostasis Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR) were applied. Participants had a mean age of 13·98 years and 50·2 % of them were girls. In fully adjusted models, participants with highest MIND diet adherence had lower odds of MUO status based on IDF (OR = 0·20; 95 % CI 0·08, 0·51) and IDF/HOMA-IR (OR = 0·22; 95 % CI 0·08, 0·59) criteria. Stratified analyses revealed that this association was stronger among girls and was only significant among individuals with overweight. An inverse association was also found between MIND diet score and odds of hyperglycaemia and insulin resistance (IR). Higher MIND diet adherence was associated with lower odds MUO in adolescents with overweight/obesity. Inverse associations were also found between MIND diet and odds of hyperglycaemia and IR. Future longitudinal prospective studies are necessary to confirm our results."

This study examined the impact of the Mediterranean-DASH Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay (MIND) diet on mental health, PCOS-related quality of life (PCOSQ), anthropometric indices, hirsutism, and metabolic/hormonal parameters in women with PCOS. Total of 52 women with PCOS, aged between 18 and 45 years, were randomly assigned to either the low calorie MIND diet group or the control group. Anthropometric data, depression and anxiety scores, serum levels of gonadotropins (luteinizing hormone [LH], follicle-stimulating hormone [FSH]), PCOSQ, and Ferriman-Gallwey score were evaluated before and after the intervention. Outcomes were assessed at baseline and at the end of the 8-week follow-up period. After 8 weeks, the MIND diet significantly reduced depression (β -3·03; 95 % CI: [-5·36, -0·70]; P = 0·011) and anxiety (β -3·54; 95 % CI: [-6·60, -0·49]; P = 0·024) scores compared with the control group. The MIND diet group exhibited significant increases in the emotion (β 0·63; 95 % CI: [0·18, 1·08]; P = 0·007) and body hair (β 0·65; 95 % CI: [0·03, 1·28]; P = 0·04) domains of the PCOSQ compared to the control group. The changes in other parameters did not show significant differences between the two groups. Both the MIND diet and control groups showed improvements in weight and BMI, with a slight advantage for the MIND diet group. These findings suggest that the MIND diet may be beneficial for improving mental health and some aspects of PCOSQ in women with PCOS."

OBJECTIVES: Our study explored serum metabolites associated with adherence to the MIND diet. METHODS: In 3,908 Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study participants, we calculated a modified MIND diet score based on a 66-item self-reported food frequency questionnaire (FFQ). The modified score did not include berries and olive oil, as these items were not assessed in the FFQ. We used multivariable linear regression models in 2 subgroups of ARIC study participants and meta-analyzed results using fixed effects regression to identify significant metabolites after Bonferroni correction. We also examined associations between these metabolites and food components of the modified MIND diet. C-statistics evaluated the prediction of high modified MIND diet adherence using significant metabolites beyond participant characteristics. RESULTS: Of 360 metabolites analyzed, 27 metabolites (15 positive, 12 negative) were significantly associated with the modified MIND diet score (lipids, n = 13; amino acids, n = 5; xenobiotics, n = 3; cofactors and vitamins, n = 3; carbohydrates n = 2; nucleotide n = 1). The top 4 metabolites that improved the prediction of high dietary adherence to the modified MIND diet were 7-methylxanthine, theobromine, docosahexaenoate (DHA), and 3-carboxy-4-methyl-5-propyl-2-furanpropanoate (CMPF). CONCLUSION: Twenty-seven metabolomic markers were correlated with the modified MIND diet. The biomarkers, if further validated, could be useful to objectively assess adherence to the MIND diet.",

However, there is a lack of evidence regarding the association between emerging diets such as the EAT-Lancet reference diet (ELD) and the Mediterranean-DASH Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay (MIND) diet, and mental health in different societies. This study aimed to determine the association between adherence to ELD and MIND diets and the risk of depression, anxiety, and stress. METHODS: This research involved 4579 participants from the PERSIAN Organizational Cohort Study in Mashhad (POCM). To assess dietary intake, a comprehensive 118-item semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) was employed. The Planetary Health Diet Index (PHDI) was used to assess adherence to the ELD. Mental health status was evaluated using the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale-21 items (DASS-21) questionnaire. Binary logistic regression was utilized to examine the relationship between these scores and mental health indicators. RESULTS: In the adjusted model, the highest quartile of PHDI showed a 35% reduced risk of depression compared to those in the lowest quartile (OR: 0.653, 95% CI: 0.483-0.883; P = 0.008). However, compared to the reference quartile, participants in the highest quartile of MIND diet exhibited significantly lower risks of depression (OR: 0.611, 95% CI: 0.447-0.836; P = 0.005), anxiety (OR: 0.559, 95% CI: 0.418-0.746; P < 0.001), and stress (OR: 0.629, 95% CI: 0.419-0.944; P = 0.008). CONCLUSIONS: The ELD and MIND diet were both associated with reduced odds of depression. Additionally, MIND diet was associated with decreased likelihood of anxiety and stress. However, no connection was observed between ELD and anxiety or stress. Further large-scale interventions are required to confirm these findings.",

Dietary patterns like The Mediterranean-DASH diet intervention for neurodegenerative delay (MIND) diet have the potential to reduce the negative health outcomes associated with caregiving. Our objective was to assess capabilities, opportunities, and motivation of caregivers to follow the MIND diet using the COM-B model approach. METHOD: Female caregivers (n = 299, m age = 37.7 ± 13.7) participated in an online survey. Majority were White (72%) and cared for someone with Alzheimer's disease (42.6%). The survey included at least one question for each of the 6 COM-B subcomponents: psychological capability, physical capability, social opportunity, physical opportunity, reflective motivation, and automatic motivation. RESULTS: Most caregivers were not consuming the MIND diet as only 8.4% reported normally eating the MIND diet items. Caregivers (36.5%) were slightly confident or not confident at all in cooking and eating the MIND diet. Participants (67.1%) reported that consuming the MIND diet would somewhat to very much be supported by friends and family. Budget, time, and transportation were selected as the main barriers. Budget, cooking skills, access to food and stores, and family support were the main facilitators. DISCUSSION: Strategies to increase capability, opportunities, and motivation for the MIND diet are needed to improve caregivers' health. Future MIND diet interventions should improve budget planning and cooking skills of caregivers (capabilities), make MIND diet food items accessible to them (opportunity) and incorporate social support from family and friends (motivation)."

METHODS: Five thousand two hundred fifty-nine participants (73.5 [± 6.0] years, 62% Black participants, 62% female) completed a food frequency questionnaire, and two or more cognitive assessments over 7.8 ± 4.6 years. RESULTS: Overall, higher MIND diet was associated with slower cognitive decline (p for trend = 0.0025). The MIND score (range:0-15) was different between Black and White older adults(6.97 vs. 7.12, p = 0.010). Compared to the lowest tertile, among White participants, the two highest tertiles (MIND score -7: β = 0.0121 [95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.0006, 0.0237]; MIND score -8.5: β = 0.0146 [95% CI: 0.0003, 0.0260]) and among Black participants, only the highest tertile (MIND score -8.5: β = 0.0088 [95% CI: 0.0003, 0.0172]) had association with cognitive decline. Vascular and lifestyle factors attenuated the association only for Black older adults. DISCUSSION: The MIND diet was associated with slower cognitive decline in Black and White older adults, but this may vary with other lifestyle and vascular factors. Further research is warranted on race-specific cultural diets considering other risk factors for cognitive decline. HIGHLIGHTS: The intake of Mediterranean-Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay (MIND) diet components varies by race. The MIND diet may slow cognitive decline in both Black and White older adults. This association may vary with other lifestyle and vascular risk factors.",

Nevertheless, current literature is deficient in terms of investigating the link between the MIND diet and subjective well-being (SWB) specifically in older adults. Hence, this study endeavors to examine the correlation between adhering to a Chinese-modified Mediterranean-DASH Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay (cMIND) diet and SWB in the older Chinese adults, taking into account the unique dietary attributes of the Chinese population. METHODS: Using data from the latest four waves of the Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey. Multiple linear regression and multinomial ordered logistic regression were employed to examine the relationship between the duration of adherence to cMIND diet and SWB in Chinese older adults. RESULTS: The results indicated a significant association between the duration of adherence to cMIND diet and SWB (1 ∼ 6 years: B = 0.907, 95%CI = 0.508 ∼ 1.307, P < 0.001; 7 ∼ 9 years: B = 1.286, 95%CI = 0.767 ∼ 1.805, P < 0.001; 10 years and above: B = 2.320, 95%CI = 1.677 ∼ 2.963, P < 0.001). The longer the duration of adherence to cMIND diet, the higher the scores for life satisfaction (B = 0.184, 95%CI = 0.110 ∼ 0.259; B = 0.312, 95%CI = 0.217 ∼ 0.407; B = 0.321, 95%CI = 0.193 ∼ 0.448), positive affect (B = 0.434, 95%CI = 0.209 ∼ 0.658; B = 0.701, 95%CI = 0.400 ∼ 1.003; B = 1.167, 95%CI = 0.775 ∼ 1.559), and negative affect (B = 0.289, 95%CI = 0.078 ∼ 0.500; B = 0.832, 95%CI = 0.479 ∼ 1.185), suggesting a higher SWB score. Sensitivity analysis further supports our findings. CONCLUSION: Considering the poor knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors related to diet among Chinese adults, especially older adults, it is imperative to implement dietary policies that promote SWB in older adults to enhance their happiness in later life.",

Based on the National Cholesterol Education Program, if the person has three or more indices containing: elevated fasting blood sugar, high levels of triglycerides, hypertension, low levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and central obesity, he suffers MetS. The Mediterranean-Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay diet is a novel diet that with the specific aim of safeguarding cognitive function. Propolis is a resinous substance produced by bees from the combination of buds and secretions of plants with saliva and bee enzymes. After propolis supplementation, a significant reduction in fasting plasma glucose levels and lipid profiles has been observed. Considering the importance of chronic diseases like MetS on health, the role of the Mediterranean-DASH Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay (MIND) diet and propolis supplement that will improve blood sugar, blood lipid, anthropometric indicators, blood pressure, and cognitive function, and limited contradictory studies, we decided to conduct this study. This study, which is a randomized controlled clinical trial study, will be conducted on adults with MetS who will visit Hazrat Ali Health Center in Isfahan. Participants must provide informed consent before engaging in the study. Demographic data such as age, gender, and medical history will be recorded. Then, anthropometric indices, MetS indices, and cognitive function will be measured in all subjects. The study participants will be divided into three groups and will be controlled for 12 weeks. We will have a MIND diet + placebo group, a MIND diet + propolis supplement group, and a control group that will receive a microcrystalline cellulose placebo and usual dietary advice. At the end of the intervention, all indices will be assessed again. The data obtained in the study will be analyzed at descriptive and analytical levels by the statistical software SPSS26. The present study's protocol was approved by the Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials (www.irct.ir) on 3/28/2023 and a registration reference is IRCT20230105057054N1."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Dietary patterns are associated with dementia risk, but the underlying molecular mechanisms are largely unknown. METHODS: We used RNA sequencing data from post mortem prefrontal cortex tissue and annual cognitive evaluations from 1204 participants in the Religious Orders Study and Memory and Aging Project. We identified a transcriptomic profile correlated with the MIND diet (Mediterranean-Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay) among 482 individuals who completed ante mortem food frequency questionnaires; and examined its associations with cognitive health in the remaining 722 participants. RESULTS: We identified a transcriptomic profile, consisting of 50 genes, correlated with the MIND diet score (p = 0.001). Each standard deviation increase in the transcriptomic profile score was associated with a slower annual rate of decline in global cognition (β = 0.011, p = 0.003) and lower odds of dementia (odds ratio = 0.76, p = 0.0002). Expressions of several genes (including TCIM and IGSF5) appeared to mediate the association between MIND diet and dementia. DISCUSSION: A brain transcriptomic profile for healthy diets revealed novel genes potentially associated with cognitive health. HIGHLIGHTS: Why healthy dietary patterns are associated with lower dementia risk are unknown. We integrated dietary, brain transcriptomic, and cognitive data in older adults. Mediterranean-Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay (MIND) diet intake is correlated with a specific brain transcriptomic profile. This brain transcriptomic profile score is associated with better cognitive health. More data are needed to elucidate the causality and functionality of identified genes.",

In the REasons for Geographic and Racial Disparities in Stroke (REGARDS) cohort, diet data were collected at baseline using food frequency questionnaires. Modified Poisson regression was used to examine the association of MIND diet with incident chronic kidney disease (CKD). In the REGARDS stroke case-cohort, 357 metabolites were measured in baseline plasma. Weighted linear regression was used to test associations between MIND diet and metabolites. Weighted logistic regression was used to test associations between MIND-associated metabolites and incident CKD. Mediation analyses were conducted to determine whether metabolites mediated the relationship between MIND diet and CKD. A higher MIND diet score was associated with a decreased risk of incident CKD (risk ratio 0.90, 95% CI (0.86-0.94); p = 2.03 × 10-7). Fifty-seven metabolites were associated with MIND diet (p < 3 × 10-4). Guanosine was found to mediate the relationship between MIND diet and incident CKD (odds ratio for indirect effects 0.93, 95% CI (0.88-0.97); p < 0.05).

      "abstract": "This study aims to investigate the association between the MIND index (Mediterranean- Dietary approaches to Stop Hypertension diet Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay) and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in the Iranian children. It builds upon existing research that highlights the role of dietary antioxidants in alleviating psychological disorders, cognitive impairments, and memory deficits. Additionally, previous studies have separately explored the beneficial effects of the Mediterranean and DASH diets on these issues. A case-control study was undertaken in Iran, involving a sample of 360 children and adolescents aged 7-13 years. Participants were divided into two groups, namely the case group (n = 120) and the control group (n = 240), with age and sex being matched between the groups. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV-TR) was employed for the diagnosis of ADHD. The MIND diet score was computed using the food intake data acquired from the Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ) completed by the subjects. The mean ± SD for the age and BMI of the study population was 8.76 ± 1.64 years and 16.90 ± 3.58 kg/m2, respectively. The mean score of MIND in this study was 27.93. After adjustment for potential confounder in the final model, subjects in highest compared to the lowest quartile of MIND diet score had significantly lower odds of ADHD (OR = 0.59, 95% CI 0.37-0.83; P-trend = 0.019). This study provides valuable evidence suggesting that adherence to the MIND diet is associated with decreased odds of ADHD.",

      "abstract": "The MIND diet is a healthy dietary pattern that has some benefits for many health outcomes. Our study aims to conduct a bibliometric analysis of the MIND diet, identifying leading edges and hotspots to provide a reference for future research. The research on the MIND diet was gathered from the Web of Science Core Collection (WOSCC) database. For bibliometric analysis, VOSviewer 1.6.16 and the WOSCC Online Analysis Platform were utilized. In total, this comprehensive investigation encompassed 171 documents in the field of the MIND diet. The publications are globally distributed, with contributions from 953 authors across 362 institutions in 37 countries/regions, and published in 94 journals. The United States leads with 72 publications, and Iran and the People's Republic of China also show notable engagement with 28 and 19 publications, respectively. Rush University stands out with 21 publications, followed by Harvard University and Tehran University of Medical Sciences, demonstrating their substantial contributions to this field. Martha Clare Morris is a key figure with 10 publications, alongside Klodian Dhana and Puja Agarwal, each contributing 9 publications, highlighting their influence in the MIND diet research. The journal \"Nutrients\" is a major publication venue with 20 related articles, followed by \"Frontiers in Nutrition\" and \"Journal of Nutrition Health Aging,\" reflecting their crucial roles in advancing knowledge about the MIND diet. The first high-cited publication was published in Alzheimers & Dementia and conducted by Martha Clare Morris, which focuses on the MIND diet's relationship with Alzheimer's disease prevention and cognitive decline and emphasizes the diet's neuroprotective potential, highlighting how even moderate adherence can substantially reduce Alzheimer's risk and slow cognitive decline. In conclusion, this is the first comprehensive bibliometric study that quantitatively and qualitatively analyzed the publications in the field of the MIND diet. The MIND diet may be a promising dietary pattern for dementia. However, the current evidence is restricted and highlights the urgency and necessity of further research to investigate the efficacy of this diet for cognitive function. In addition, the MIND diet may have some benefits for other health outcomes, including CVDs, cancer, and diabetes. The number of studies in the field of the MIND diet is limited. More studies are needed, and will give us more knowledge about the MIND diet to improve human health, especially for dementia."

This study aims to bridge the gap in understanding of the association of the MIND diet with IBD risk. Methods: We utilized data from 187 490 participants in the UK Biobank who provided dietary information and were free of IBD at baseline. Dietary information was obtained using a validated web-based 24-hour dietary recall questionnaire. A MIND diet score was evaluated based on the intake of ten beneficial and five unhealthy food groups and the scores were further grouped into tertiles. The outcome of interest was incident IBD, Crohn's disease (CD), and ulcerative colitis (UC). Multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using Cox proportional hazard models adjusted for demographic characteristics, lifestyle factors, cancer history, and other dietary factors. Mediation analyses were performed to evaluate the role of systemic inflammation and metabolic disorders represented by the integrated biomarkers in the MIND diet-IBD association. Results: After a mean follow-up of 10.7 years, we documented 825 incident IBD cases (250 CD and 575 UC). The average age of the participants was 56.2 years, of which 55.0% were females. We found that greater adherence to the MIND diet, represented by a higher diet score, was associated with a lower risk of IBD (HRcomparing extreme tertiles 0.74, 95% CI 0.62-0.90, p = 0.002; p for trend = 0.005), CD (HR 0.66, 95% CI 0.47-0.94, p = 0.022; p for trend = 0.023), and UC (HR 0.78, 95% CI 0.62-0.98, p = 0.031; p for trend = 0.022). The associations were partially mediated by metabolic and inflammation status (mediation proportion: 5.5-15.9%). Conclusion: We found higher adherence to the MIND diet was associated with a lower risk of IBD, and that inflammatory and metabolic conditions may play an important role in the underlying mechanistic pathways.",

The Mediterranean & Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay (MIND) diet has shown promise in reducing the risk of MCI and Alzheimer's disease in older people. Notably, the existing MIND diet is not adapted to the specific needs of older adults in Malaysia, considering distinct food cultures and availability. Consequently, this study aimed to develop the Malaysian version of the MIND diet (MY-MINDD) scores and investigate their association with MCI in the older adult populace of Malaysia. METHODS: A comprehensive pooled data analysis was conducted on combined data from 810 participants sourced from the longitudinal Long-Term Research Grant Scheme-Towards Useful Aging (LRGS-TUA) and Fundamental Research Grant Scheme (FRGS) studies. The MY-MINDD scores were developed by incorporating existing MIND diet food groups, their corresponding scoring mechanisms, and consideration of common Malaysian foods which are proven to be beneficial and detrimental to cognitive function. To substantiate the MY-MINDD scoring system, its association with MCI was evaluated using a series of validated neuropsychological test batteries. RESULTS: MY-MINDD consists of seven food groups promote brain health and four food groups exert negative cognitive outcomes. The study participants had an average age of 67.9 ± 4.7 years. The collective MY-MINDD score for all participants was 6.4 ± 0.1 (out of a maximum 11 points), revealing a lower score in individuals with MCI at 6.0 ± 1.7 compared to those without MCI at 6.6 ± 1.6 (p < 0.001). According to hierarchical multivariate binary logistic regression analysis, being in the highest tertile of MY-MINDD score was linked to reduced odds of MCI (odds ratio (OR) = 0.43, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.26-0.72, p < 0.001) in the fully adjusted model in comparison to the lowest tertile. CONCLUSION: The development of the MY-MINDD scores for Malaysian older population revealed that a stronger adherence to this diet is linked to a reduced risk of MCI. Further substantiation of the MY-MINDD scores using more objective measures, such as neuroimaging approaches and other neuropsychological batteries, is necessary.",

However, there has been limited exploration of whether this association extends to the Asian population. This study aimed to assess the correlation between the Chinese version of the MIND (cMIND) diet and cognitive impairment in older Chinese individuals. METHODS: We utilized data from the 2008 wave of the Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey. Participants aged ≥65 years with normal cognitive function at baseline were enrolled. The cMIND diet score (cMINDDS) was calculated by assessing dietary patterns based on survey responses. The Chinese version of the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) was employed to diagnose cognitive impairment in participants. We stratified the analysis by cMINDDS and conducted additional sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: The cohort consisted of 6411 participants. Over a 3-year follow-up, 1165 (18.6%) individuals who initially had normal cognitive function developed cognitive impairment. A linear association was observed between cMINDDS and cognitive impairment. The increased cMINDDS was associated with a reduced risk of cognitive impairment (quartile 1 vs. quartile 4: the adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 0.77, 95% confidence interval [CI]: [0.60, 0.97], p trend = 0.023). Regarding food composition, higher consumption of fresh fruits and nuts was associated with a decreased risk of cognitive impairment (OR = 0.77, 95% CI: [0.66, 0.89] and OR = 0.70, 95% CI [0.58, 0.86], respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Adherence to the cMIND diet was associated with lower risks of cognitive impairment in older Chinese individuals.

A potential mechanism could be possible anti-inflammatory properties of the MIND-diet. OBJECTIVE: To examine whether adherence to the MIND diet at baseline is associated with the odds of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and changes in biomarkers of inflammation (High-sensitivity C-reactive Protein(hsCRP), interleukin-6(IL-6)) over three years in adults ≥70 years. METHODS: Adherence to the MIND diet was assessed by food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) at baseline and after three years. Presence of MCI based on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) was defined as <26 (MCI26), or <24 (MCI24). We performed a minimally adjusted model controlling for sex, prior fall, linear spline at age 85, time, treatment and study site. The fully adjusted model also adjusted for education, BMI, physical activity, depression score, daily energy intake, and comorbidity score. To assess the change in inflammatory markers from baseline, we used linear-mixed-effect models adjusted for the same variables plus the respective baseline concentrations. Sensitivity analyses accounting for practice effects of repeated cognitive tests using the reliable change index for both MoCA cut-offs were done. RESULTS: We included 2028 of 2157 DO-HEALTH participants (60.5% women; mean age 74.88 years) with complete data. Adherence to the MIND diet at baseline was not associated with cognitive decline over three years, neither at MoCA < 26 (OR (95%CI) = 0.99 (0.94-1.04)) nor at MoCA < 24 (OR (95%CI) = 1.03 (0.96-1.1)). Applying the reliable change index to the two cut-offs confirmed the findings. Further, the MIND diet adherence was not associated with the change in MoCA score from baseline in DO-HEALTH. For inflammatory biomarkers MIND-diet baseline adherence was not associated with changes in hsCRP or IL-6. CONCLUSION: Adherence to the MIND-diet was neither associated with the odds of MCI, nor with hsCRP or IL-6 at baseline. Moreover, change in MIND-diet over three years was not associated with changes in hsCRP or IL-6.",

      "abstract": "The Mediterranean-Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay (MIND) diet seems a promising approach to preserve brain function during aging. Previous systematic reviews have demonstrated benefits of the MIND diet for cognition and dementia, though an update is needed. Additionally, other outcomes relevant to brain aging have not been summarized. Therefore, this systematic review aims to give an up-to-date and complete overview on human studies that examined the MIND diet in relation to brain aging outcomes in adults aged ≥40 y. Ovid Medline, Web of Science core collection, and Scopus were searched up to July 25, 2023. Study quality was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale and the Cochrane Risk-of-Bias tool. We included 40 articles, of which 32 were unique cohorts. Higher MIND diet adherence was protective of dementia in 7 of 10 cohorts. Additionally, positive associations were demonstrated in 3 of 4 cohorts for global cognition and 4 of 6 cohorts for episodic memory. The protective effects of the MIND diet on cognitive decline are less apparent, with only 2 of 7 longitudinal cohorts demonstrating positive associations for global decline and 1 of 6 for episodic memory decline. For other brain outcomes (domain-specific cognition, cognitive impairments, Parkinson's disease, brain volume, and pathology), results were mixed or only few studies had been performed. Many of the cohorts demonstrating protective associations were of North American origin, raising the question if the most favorable diet for healthy brain aging is population-dependent. In conclusion, this systematic review provides observational evidence for protective associations between the MIND diet and global cognition and dementia risk, but evidence for other brain outcomes remains mixed and/or limited. The MIND diet may be the preferred diet for healthy brain aging in North American populations, though evidence for other populations seems less conclusive.

      "abstract": "As the world becomes a super-aged society, cognitive decline is public health problems that are increasing rapidly. A healthy diet has great potential for maintaining cognitive health. A diet that could delay the onset of neurodegenerative diseases has been developed: the Mediterranean-DASH Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay (MIND) diet, a hybrid form of the Mediterranean diet and the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet. In this review, the effects of the MIND diet on improving cognitive function, including memory, are summarized. In most studies, the higher the adherence to the MIND diet, the higher the cognitive function evaluation score, and the lower the incidence of dementia. This is because of the anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects of the major nutritional components of the MIND diet: folate, carotenoids, polyphenols, and polyunsaturated fatty acids. Adherence to the MIND diet, containing various bioactive food ingredients, is related to cognitive improvement in the elderly population."

      "abstract": "Selenium is a trace element found in many chemical forms. Selenium and its species have nutritional and toxicologic properties, some of which may play a role in the etiology of neurological disease. We hypothesized that adherence to the Mediterranean-Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay (MIND) diet could influence intake and endogenous concentrations of selenium and selenium species, thus contributing to the beneficial effects of this dietary pattern. We carried out a cross-sectional study of 137 non-smoking blood donors (75 females and 62 males) from the Reggio Emilia province, Northern Italy. We assessed MIND diet adherence using a semiquantitative food frequency questionnaire. We assessed selenium exposure through dietary intake and measurement of urinary and serum concentrations, including speciation of selenium compound in serum. We fitted non-linear spline-based regression models to investigate the association between MIND diet adherence and selenium exposure concentrations. Adherence to the MIND diet was positively associated with dietary selenium intake and urinary selenium excretion, whereas it was inversely associated with serum concentrations of overall selenium and organic selenium, including serum selenoprotein P-bound selenium, the most abundant circulating chemical form of the metalloid. MIND diet adherence also showed an inverted U-shaped relation with inorganic selenium and particularly with its hexavalent form, selenate. Our results suggest that greater adherence to the MIND diet is non-linearly associated with lower circulating concentrations of selenium and of 2 potentially neurotoxic species of this element, selenoprotein P and selenate. This may explain why adherence to the MIND dietary pattern may reduce cognitive decline.",

METHODS: We analyzed data from the Adolescent Brain and Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study (Year 1, N = 8333). Multivariable linear regression analysis was used to identify associations between MIND diet score and sociodemographic factors, including race/ethnicity, household income, parent education level, age, sex, and sexual minority status. RESULTS: Compared to White adolescents, Latino adolescents showed the greatest adherence to the MIND diet. Boys had lower adherence to the MIND diet than girls. Lower household income was associated with lower adherence to the MIND diet. Older age was associated with lower adherence to the MIND diet. Sexual minorities had a lower adherence to the MIND diet when compared to their heterosexual counterparts. DISCUSSION: Female sex, Latino ethnicity, Asian and Black race, high household income, heterosexual sexual orientation, and younger age were associated with higher adherence to the MIND diet. These sociodemographic differences can inform targeted screening and counseling for clinicians and public health organizations among diverse adolescent populations. IMPACT STATEMENT: Sociodemographic disparities in diet quality have been documented, but none have explored adherence to the MIND (Mediterranean-DASH [Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension] Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay) diet in early adolescence. In this demographically diverse sample of 9-12-year-old early adolescents in the U.S., we found notable and nuanced sociodemographic disparities in adherence to the MIND diet. Sociodemographic factors associated with higher adherence to the MIND diet included female sex, Latino ethnicity, high household income, heterosexual sexual orientation, and younger age.",

The Mediterranean-DASH Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay (MIND) diet has been developed to address the expansive impact of dementias on the general public. This systematic review evaluated the impact of the MIND diet on cognition in those with pathologies across the dementia spectrum. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the application of the MIND diet for prevention and/or treatment of dementia. METHODS: PubMed was used to conduct a search using the MIND diet and terms related to cognition. Articles were excluded if they were published prior to 2018, studied a population without dementia or significant risk factors, or did not include those 65 + . The overall quality of each source was analyzed based on the cognitive test(s) used, the selection of subjects, and the sample size. RESULTS: The search generated 33 papers, which yielded 11 articles after screening. Of these studies, one was conducted on those with mild cognitive impairment, one with AD, two with general dementia, and seven with at-risk individuals. All the studies found a positive correlation between adherence and some form of cognitive functioning, but results were mixed for specific cognitive domains. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that the MIND diet may be a useful long-term treatment option for those with various dementia pathologies. However, more research is needed on subjects with onset dementias. Additionally, there is a need for more research into the mechanisms behind the common comorbidities.",

These investigations have specifically explored its potential to provide protection against cardiometabolic diseases and associated risk factors, including obesity and dyslipidemia. METHODS: We systematically summarized and evaluated all existing observational and trial evidence for the MIND diet in relation to cardiometabolic diseases and their risk factors in adults. PubMed, Embase, CINAHL and Cochrane Library databases were systematically searched to extract original studies on humans published until September 2023, without date restrictions. A total of 491 studies were initially retrieved, out of which 23 met the eligibility criteria and were included in the final review. Duplicated and irrelevant studies were screened out by five independent reviewers using the Rayyan platform. Quality assessment was ascertained using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale for observational studies and the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool (RoB 2) for randomized trials. RESULTS: Across the different study designs, the MIND diet was generally associated with an improvement in anthropometric measures and other cardiometabolic outcomes, such as blood pressure, glycemic control, lipid profile, inflammation and stroke. The effects of the MIND eating pattern on some cardiovascular diseases are less conclusive. CONCLUSION: The findings of this systematic review support the recommendation of the MIND diet as a strategy to reduce cardiometabolic risk in adults. Further well-designed and long-term studies are warranted."

This study aims to estimate the impact of adhering to the MIND diet on the mortality in patients with and without T2DM. SUBJECTS/METHODS: In this cohort study, 6887 participants (1021 patients with T2DM) from the NHANES dataset were analyzed. The exposure is the MIND diet adherence. The primary outcomes are all-cause and cardiovascular (CV) deaths. RESULTS: We documented 1087 all-cause deaths consisting of 377 CV deaths during the follow-up (median time of 10 years). Among participants with T2DM, those with a high MIND score (> 8.0, range of MIND score: 4.5-13) had a significantly lower risk of all-cause death (hazard ratio [HR] 0.75, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.59, 0.96, P = 0.021) and CV death (HR 0.50, 95% CI: 0.29, 0.87, P = 0.014) compared to those with a low MIND score (≤ 8.0). In participants without T2DM, a high MIND score was associated with a significant decrease in the risk of all-cause death (HR = 0.83, 95% CI: 0.70, 0.99, P < 0.001), but the association with CV death risk was not statistically significant. CONCLUSION: This study uncovered significant associations between the MIND diet and decreased risk of all-cause and CV death in patients with T2DM. The findings highlight the potential benefits of following the MIND diet in managing and enhancing the outcomes of individuals with T2DM.",

The study examines the benefits of a modified Korean MIND (K-MIND) diet and explores biomarkers using multi-omics analysis. METHODS AND RESULTS: The K-MIND diet, tailored to the elderly Korean population, includes perilla oil, milk, or fermented milk, and avoids alcohol consumption. As a result, the K-MIND diet significantly improves subjects \"orientation to place\" in the Korean version of the Mini-Mental State Examination, 2nd edition test. According to multi-omics analysis, the K-MIND diet upregulates genes associated with mitochondrial respiration, including ubiquinone oxidoreductase, cytochrome C oxidase, and ATP synthase, and immune system processes, and downregulates genes related to nuclear factor kappa B activity and inflammatory responses. In addition, K-MIND affects the metabolic pathways of glycine, serine, threonine, tryptophan, and sphingolipids, which are closely linked to cognitive function through synthesis of neurotransmitters and structures of brain cell membranes. CONCLUSION: The findings imply that the K-MIND diet improves cognitive function by upregulating key genes involved in oxidative phosphorylation and downregulating pro-inflammatory cytokines.",

The Mediterranean-DASH Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay, known as the MIND diet, is a hybrid of the Mediterranean diet and the DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) diet, with modifications to include foods that have been putatively associated with a decreased risk of dementia. METHODS: We performed a two-site, randomized, controlled trial involving older adults without cognitive impairment but with a family history of dementia, a body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) greater than 25, and a suboptimal diet, as determined by means of a 14-item questionnaire, to test the cognitive effects of the MIND diet with mild caloric restriction as compared with a control diet with mild caloric restriction. We assigned the participants in a 1:1 ratio to follow the intervention or the control diet for 3 years. All the participants received counseling regarding adherence to their assigned diet plus support to promote weight loss. The primary end point was the change from baseline in a global cognition score and four cognitive domain scores, all of which were derived from a 12-test battery. The raw scores from each test were converted to z scores, which were averaged across all tests to create the global cognition score and across component tests to create the four domain scores; higher scores indicate better cognitive performance. The secondary outcome was the change from baseline in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-derived measures of brain characteristics in a nonrandom sample of participants. RESULTS: A total of 1929 persons underwent screening, and 604 were enrolled; 301 were assigned to the MIND-diet group and 303 to the control-diet group. The trial was completed by 93.4% of the participants. From baseline to year 3, improvements in global cognition scores were observed in both groups, with increases of 0.205 standardized units in the MIND-diet group and 0.170 standardized units in the control-diet group (mean difference, 0.035 standardized units; 95% confidence interval, -0.022 to 0.092; P = 0.23). Changes in white-matter hyperintensities, hippocampal volumes, and total gray- and white-matter volumes on MRI were similar in the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: Among cognitively unimpaired participants with a family history of dementia, changes in cognition and brain MRI outcomes from baseline to year 3 did not differ significantly between those who followed the MIND diet and those who followed the control diet with mild caloric restriction.

      "abstract": "Identifying novel mechanisms underlying dementia is critical to improving prevention and treatment. As an approach to mechanistic discovery, we investigated whether MIND diet (Mediterranean-DASH Diet Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay), a consistent risk factor for dementia, is correlated with a specific profile of cortical gene expression, and whether such a transcriptomic profile is associated with dementia, in the Religious Orders Study (ROS) and Rush Memory and Aging Project (MAP). RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) was conducted in postmortem dorsolateral prefrontal cortex tissue from 1,204 deceased participants; neuropsychological assessments were performed annually prior to death. In a subset of 482 participants, diet was assessed ~6 years before death using a validated food-frequency questionnaire; in these participants, using elastic net regression, we identified a transcriptomic profile, consisting of 50 genes, significantly correlated with MIND diet score (P=0.001). In multivariable analysis of the remaining 722 individuals, higher transcriptomic score of MIND diet was associated with slower annual rate of decline in global cognition (β=0.011 per standard deviation increment in transcriptomic profile score, P=0.003) and lower odds of dementia (odds ratio [OR] =0.76, P=0.0002). Cortical expression of several genes appeared to mediate the association between MIND diet and dementia, including TCIM, whose expression in inhibitory neurons and oligodendrocytes was associated with dementia in a subset of 424 individuals with single-nuclei RNA-seq data. In a secondary Mendelian randomization analysis, genetically predicted transcriptomic profile score was associated with dementia (OR=0.93, P=0.04). Our study suggests that associations between diet and cognitive health may involve brain molecular alterations at the transcriptomic level. Investigating brain molecular alterations related to diet may inform the identification of novel pathways underlying dementia."

We aimed to investigate whether adherence to MIND diet is associated with odds and severity of AD. METHODS: The present case-control study carried out on 85 patients who were group matched by gender with 170 healthy subjects. Data for dietary intake was assessed by using a 147-item validated food frequency questionnaire (FFQ). Anthropometric measures were collected using standard methods. The MIND diet score was calculated using FFQ. We assessed anxiety disorder severity using the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) questionnaire. Multivariate odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were used to investigate the association of MIND diet and anxiety disorder. RESULTS: We observed that higher adherence to MIND diet was associated with the lower GAD-7 score (p < 0.001). Individuals in the top category of MIND diet score were 97% less likely to have AD compared with those in the bottom category (OR: 0.03, 95% CI: 0.01, 0.09). There was significant reverse linear association between MIND diet score and AD (β = -3.63, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, we provided some evidence indicating negative association between adherence to MIND diet, odds, and severity of AD. Finally, due to the probable preventive role of diet, it is vital to clarify the association between diet and AD through large-scale prospective cohort studies in the future.",

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association of the Mediterranean-Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay (MIND) diet with the risk of dementia in 3 prospective studies and a meta-analysis. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Cohort analyses included the Whitehall II study (WII), the Health and Retirement Study (HRS), and the Framingham Heart Study Offspring cohort (FOS), and the meta-analysis included 11 cohort studies. Participants were middle-aged and older women and men from WII in 2002 to 2004, HRS in 2013, and FOS in 1998 to 2001 without dementia at the study baseline. Data were analyzed from May 25 to September 1, 2022. EXPOSURES: MIND diet score was measured using food frequency questionnaires, and scores ranged from 0 to 15, with a higher score indicating higher adherence to the MIND diet. MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURES: Incident all-cause dementia, with cohort-specific definitions. RESULTS: Included in this study were 8358 participants (mean [SD] age, 62.2 [6.0] years; 5777 male [69.1%]) from WII, 6758 participants (mean [SD] age, 66.5 [10.4] years; 3965 female [58.7%]) from HRS, and 3020 participants (mean [SD] age, 64.2 [9.1] years; 1648 female [54.6%]) from FOS. The mean (SD) baseline MIND diet score was 8.3 (1.4) in WII, 7.1 (1.9) in HRS, and 8.1 (1.6) in FOS. Over 166 516 person-years, a total of 775 participants (220 in WII, 338 in HRS, and 217 in FOS) developed incident dementia. In the multivariable-adjusted Cox proportional hazard model, higher MIND diet score was associated with lower risk of dementia (pooled hazard ratio [HR] for every 3-point increment, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.72-0.95; P for trend = .01; I2 = 0%). The associations were consistently observed in subgroups defined by sex, age, smoking status, and body mass index. In the meta-analysis of 11 cohort studies with 224 049 participants (5279 incident dementia cases), the highest tertile of MIND diet score was associated with lower risk of dementia compared with the lowest tertile (pooled HR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.76-0.90; I2 = 35%). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Results suggest that adherence to the MIND diet was associated with lower risk of incident dementia in middle-aged and older adults. Further studies are warranted to develop and refine the specific MIND diet for different populations.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The term \"Mediterranean-DASH Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay (MIND)\" has recently been coined to describe a new eating pattern. Recent research is looking at how this food pattern affects chronic illnesses. Thus, this study aimed to investigate the association between the use and adherence to the MIND diet with general obesity and blood lipid profile. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, 1,328 Kurdish adults between the ages of 39 and 53 had their dietary intake evaluated using a valid and reliable 168-item Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ). Adherence to the MIND diet was examined based on the components advised in this eating pattern. Each subject's lipid profiles and anthropometric measurements were documented. RESULTS: The mean age and BMI in the study population were 46.16 ± 7.87 year and 27.19 ± 4.60 kg/m2, respectively. The chances of having increased serum triglycerides (TG) were 42% lower in those in the third tertile of the MIND diet score compared to those in the first tertile (ORs: 0.58; 95% CI 0.38-0.95; P = 0.001). In the crude model and after adjusting for confounders, lowering high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) (ORs: 0.72; 95% CI 0.55-1.15; P = 0.001). CONCLUSION: We found that greater adherence to the MIND diet was associated with the decrease odds of general obesity and lipid profile. Further study is essential owing to the relevance of chronic diseases like MetS and obesity in health status."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Evidence on the association of the Mediterranean-Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay (MIND) diet with cognitive aging is limited and inconsistent. OBJECTIVES: We examined how the MIND diet is related to cognitive function and its decline among middle-aged and older adults. METHODS: We included 4066 participants with baseline dietary assessment and ≥1 cognitive test from the China Health and Nutrition Survey in 1997, 2000, 2004, and 2006, with a median follow-up of 3 y. The modified MIND diet score (range: 0-12) was calculated based on 9 healthy and 3 unhealthy food groups. Linear mixed-effect models were used to examine the association of adherence to the MIND diet with z-scores of cognitive function and cognitive decline. We also conducted a meta-analysis including our findings and 7 other cohort studies. RESULTS: At baseline, the median MIND diet scores across increasing tertile were 3.0, 4.0, and 5.5, respectively. Participants with higher MIND diet scores had better global cognitive function. The adjusted difference in global cognitive function z-score for every 3-point increment of MIND diet scores was 0.110 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.060, 0.159, P-trend < 0.001], which was approximately equivalent to being 1 y younger in age. Consumption of nuts, fish, red meats, and tea showed independent positive associations with cognitive function, while fried food consumption exhibited inverse associations. In the meta-analysis of 26,103 participants, one standardized deviation increment of the MIND score was associated with 0.042 (95% CI: 0.020, 0.065) units higher in global cognitive function z-score and 0.010 (95% CI: -0.001, 0.021) units slower in annual cognitive decline. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that higher adherence to the MIND diet was associated with better cognitive function and potentially slower cognitive decline in later life. Further large-scale observational and interventional studies are warranted to elucidate the cognitive effects of the MIND diet. This meta-analysis was registered at PROSPERO as CRD42022330417.",

Hence, the purpose of the present study was to investigate the association of the Mediterranean-DASH intervention for neurodegenerative delay (MIND) diet with metabolically unhealthy overweight/obesity (MUHOW/O) phenotypes. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, 229 overweight and obese women (body mass index (BMI) ≥ 25 kg/m2) aged 18-48 years were examined. Anthropometric measures and biochemical parameters were collected from all participants. The body composition of each participant was assessed using a bioelectrical impedance analyzer (BIA). The MIND diet score was determined based on 15 components using a valid and reliable food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) containing 147 items. Karelis criteria was used to determine metabolically healthy/unhealthy phenotype (MH/MUH). RESULTS: Among the participants, 72.5% of individuals were identified as MUH and 27.5% as MH, with a mean ± standard deviation (SD) age of 36.16 (8.33) years. The results of our analysis showed that after controlling for age, energy intake, BMI, and physical activity, there was no significant association observed between overweight/obesity phenotypes with tertile 2 (T2) (OR: 2.01, 95% CI: 0.86-4.17, P-value = 0.10), T3 (OR: 1.89, 95% CI: 0.86-4.17, P-value = 0.11) of MIND score, and only the odds of MUH relative to MH with a marginal significant decreasing trend was observed from the second to the third tertile (1.89 vs. 2.01) (P - trend = 0.06). Also, after additional adjustment for marital status, the nonsignificant association between overweight/obesity phenotypes with tertile 2 (T2) (OR: 2.13, 95% CI: 0.89-5.10, P-value = 0.08), T3 (OR: 1.87, 95% CI: 0.83-4.23, P-value = 0.12) of MIND score remained, and the odds of MUH relative to MH with a significant decreasing trend was observed with increasing tertiles (P-trend = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, no significant associations were found between adherence to MIND diet with MUH, and only a significant downward trend in the odds of MUH was observed with increasing tertiles.

The present study was designed to investigate the association between high adherence to the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH), Mediterranean (MeDi), and Mediterranean-DASH intervention for neurodegenerative delay (MIND) diet scores and the incidence of metabolically unhealthy phenotypes in adults across body mass index (BMI) categories. METHODS: In this cohort study, 512 subjects with metabolically healthy normal weight (MHNW) at baseline and 787 subjects with metabolically healthy overweight/obesity (MHOW/MHO) at baseline were included. Dietary intake was collected by a validated food frequency questionnaire, and DASH, MeDi, and MIND scores were calculated. The Joint Interim Statement (JIS) criteria were used to define a metabolically unhealthy status. RESULTS: A total of 137 and 388 subjects with metabolically unhealthy normal weight (MUNW) and metabolically unhealthy overweight/obesity (MUOW/MUO) phenotypes, respectively, were observed, over a mean of 5.91 years of follow-up. The Cox proportional hazard regression indicated participants in the third tertile of the DASH score had a lower risk of the MUNW phenotype (HR: 0.59; 95% CI: 0.37-0.92) than those in the lowest tertile. Similarly, the highest adherence to the MeDi and MIND scores was also linked to a 46% (HR: 0.54; 95% CI: 0.36-0.81) and 47% (HR: 0.53; 95% CI: 0.34-0.83) lower risk of the MUNW phenotype, respectively. As well, there was an inverse relationship between the highest adherence to the DASH (HR: 0.66; 95% CI: 0.50-0.86), MeDi (HR: 0.74; 95% CI: 0.58-0.93), and MIND (HR: 0.57; 95% CI: 0.43-0.74) scores and the risk of MUOW/MUO. There was no interaction between age and the three dietary patterns in relation to a metabolically unhealthy phenotype. CONCLUSION: High compliance with the DASH, MeDi, and MIND scores was associated with a lower risk of MUNW. An inverse relationship between these three dietary patterns and the incidence of the metabolically unhealthy phenotype was also observed in individuals who had MHOW/MHO at baseline.",

However, more knowledge is needed about the MIND diet's other favorable impacts. The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between the MIND diet, mental health, and metabolic markers in individuals with obesity. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, we included 339 individuals with obesity (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2) aged 20-50 years. We utilized a semi-quantitative Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ), we assessed dietary intake, including 168 food items, and calculated the value of MIND. Metabolic syndrome (MetS) was defined according to the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III (NCEP-ATP III) guidelines. We assessed biochemical parameters using Enzymatic methods. Blood pressure and body composition were also determined. RESULTS: Higher tertiles of the MIND diet score were associated with significantly higher energy intake, macronutrients, and brain-healthy food intakes (P < 0.001). Among the brain-unhealthy foods, only the intake of sweets and pastries was significantly lower in the highest versus lowest MIND tertiles. We also observed lower odds of stress (P < 0.05) and higher insulin sensitivity (P < 0.05) in the highest versus lowest MIND diet tertiles. We witnessed no significant changes in other parameters. CONCLUSION: Lower stress levels and higher insulin sensitivity independent of some confounders like age, BMI, sex, and physical activity were associated with the highest tertile of MIND diet score.",

Cardioprotective effects of the MIND diet have been demonstrated in the primary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), however, there is no exploration in patients with ASCVD. In this prospective cohort study, 943 patients with ASCVD or stroke from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) from 2003 to 2006 were enrolled and divided into three groups according to the MIND diet scores (≤7.0, 7.5-8.0, and ≥8.5).

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: choosing a healthier lifestyle and modifying dietary habits could prevent four million new people from developing cancer. Recently, a new index called the Mediterranean-dietary approach to stop hypertension (DASH) diet intervention for the neurodegenerative delay (MIND) diet has been developed. In the current study, we aimed to assess the relationship between the MIND diet and the risk of breast cancer (BC) among Tehranian adult women. METHOD: In this hospital-based, case-control study, 134 Tehranian women ≥ 30 years old with recently (< 6 months) diagnosed BC, confirmed histologically and 272 women of the same age as control were included. Dietary intakes were assessed in a personal interview using a valid and reliable semi-quantitative 168-item food frequency questionnaire. The odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) of breast cancer across tertiles of the MIND diet were determined using multivariable-adjusted logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: In the crude model, participants in the highest tertiles had lower odds of BC [(OR = 0.57; 95% CI,0.34-0.95), P for trend = 0.020)] than those with the lowest scores on the MIND diet. After controlling for potential confounding variables, individuals in the highest tertile of the MIND diet had a 45% lower risk of BC [(OR = 0.55; 95% CI, 0.32-0.96), P for trend = 0.021)] compared with those in the lowest tertile. Also, in women with an abortion history, higher adherence to the MIND diet was associated with a lower risk of BC [(OR = 0.15; 95% CI, 0.04-0.52, P for trend = 0.002)]. CONCLUSION: Our findings revealed that higher adherence to the MIND diet was associated with decreased BC risk, which was strongly observed among women with a history of abortion."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Adherence to the Mediterranean-DASH Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay (MIND) diet, which combines higher consumption of vegetables, berries, nuts, whole grains, olive oil, fish, beans and poultry, with lower consumption of meat, sugars and saturated fats, is a promising strategy to prevent dementia. However, evidence in populations with non-US food culture, especially from Europe, is limited. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the association of a French-adapted MIND diet score with gray matter volumes, white matter microstructure and incident dementia. DESIGN AND SETTING: This longitudinal study included participants from the population-based Three-City Bordeaux cohort (≥65 years), with a follow-up from June 2001 to February 2018. PARTICIPANTS: Dementia-free participants at dietary assessment, in 2001-2002, who underwent systematic detection of incident dementia (over up to 7 visits). A subset of the cohort was included in an ancillary MRI study in 2010-2011. MEASUREMENTS: A French-adapted MIND diet score (range, 0-15) was computed from a 148-item Food Frequency Questionnaire and a 24-hour recall administered at home. Incident dementia and its subtypes were adjudicated by an expert committee; and gray matter volumes and white matter microstructure were assessed by 3D-T1 MRI and diffusion-MRI. RESULTS: Among 1,412 participants (mean age, 75.8 [SD, 4.8]; 63% women), followed for a median of 9.7 years (maximum 16.3 years), 356 (25.2%) developed incident dementia. In multivariable-adjusted Cox model, a higher French MIND diet score was associated with lower risks of dementia and AD (hazard ratios for 1-point of score = 0.89 [95% confidence interval, 0.83-0.95] and 0.88 [0.81-0.96], respectively). In Tract-Based Spatial Statistics analysis of 175 participants included in the MRI sub-study, a higher MIND diet score was associated with lower diffusivity values in the splenium of the corpus callosum (P < .05 after Family-Wise Error-correction). In contrast, there was no significant association of the adapted MIND diet score with gray matter volumes in Voxel-Based Morphometry analysis. CONCLUSION: In this cohort of French older adults, higher adherence to the French MIND diet was associated with a lower dementia risk and with preserved white matter microstructure. These results provide further evidence for a role of the MIND diet in the prevention of dementia.",

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: To assess the association between the Mediterranean-DASH Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay (MIND) diet and the incidence of open-angle glaucoma (iOAG), as well as the association between iOAG and two other well-established diets in the Netherlands, i.e., the Mediterranean diet and Dutch dietary guidelines. METHODS: In the Rotterdam Study, participants were followed for iOAG since 1991, with intervals of approximately 5 years. A total of 170 participants developed iOAG during follow-up. Participants with iOAG were matched with healthy controls on age and sex in a case:control ratio of 1:5. The associations between food frequency questionnaire-derived diet adherences (baseline) and iOAG were analyzed using multivariable conditional logistic regression analyses. The associations between the diet adherences and intraocular pressure (IOP; a risk factor for OAG) were assessed using multivariable linear regression analyses. RESULTS: Greater adherence to the MIND diet was associated with a decreased iOAG risk (odds ratio [95% confidence interval]: 0.80 [0.66 to 0.96], for each 10-percent increase in adherence). Food component analyses showed that, in particular a higher intake of green leafy vegetables, berries and fish tended to be protective for iOAG. No significant associations were observed between adherence to the Mediterranean diet or Dutch dietary guidelines and iOAG. Moreover, none of the three examined diets were associated with IOP. CONCLUSION: Adherence to the MIND diet was significantly associated with a lower incidence of OAG in contrast to adherence to the Mediterranean diet or the Dutch dietary guidelines. As this association was IOP-independent, the MIND diet may be particularly relevant for the prevention of neurodegeneration in the eye.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The rising prevalence of obesity, as well as its detrimental effects on the brain, has drawn attention to specific dietary patterns. This study aimed to examine the effect of the Mediterranean-DASH Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay (MIND) pattern on anthropometric parameters, hunger hormones, and brain structures in overweight and obese women. METHODS: This randomized trial was conducted in Shiraz between October 2018 and March 2019. We analyzed 37 healthy women with a mean age of 48±5.38 years and a Body Mass Index (BMI) of 32±0.69 Kg/m2. Participants were randomly allocated to a hypocaloric modified MIND diet or a hypocaloric control diet. Differences in anthropometric, laboratory analysis, and brain structure were determined at baseline and three-month follow-up. Data were analyzed using SPSS 22.0. Independent and paired sample t test were used to determine between and within differences. We also used mixed-model ANOVA to compare the mean differences between two-factor groups. RESULTS: A more significant weight reduction (P<0.0001), BMI (P<0.0001), percentage of body fat (P=0.03), waist circumference (P=0.01), and Leptin concentration (P=0.03) were found in the MIND diet group. The results also showed a significant increase in Ghrelin (P=0.002) and GLP-1 (P=0.01) levels in the MIND diet group. The findings revealed no differences in the whole and regional brain structures between the two groups. CONCLUSION: For the first time, this study showed that the MIND diet intervention could improve the devastating effect of obesity on metabolic profiles and anthropometric parameters. However, we could not find its effect on brain structures.Trial registration number: IRCT20190427043387N1.A preprint of this study was published at https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.28.20142018v1.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Given the role of dietary antioxidants in relieving depression, anxiety, and stress, as well as studies on the beneficial effects of the Mediterranean and Dash diets separately on these problems, in this study, we examine the relationship between the MIND index (Mediterranean- DASH diet Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay) as a combined indicator of the Mediterranean and DASH diet with psychological disorders such as depression, anxiety, and psychological stress among a large sample of the Iranian adult population. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was performed on 7165 participants of the enrollment phase of Yazd Health Study (YaHS) and Yazd Nutrition Study (TAMYZ) a valid 178-item semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) was used to assess participants' food intake. The MIND diet score was calculated based on participants' dietary intakes obtained from FFQ. Also, the valid Iranian version of the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS 21) was used to assess psychological disorders and stress. In addition, the association between the MIND diet and psychological disorders and stress was assessed through logistic regression. RESULTS: The mean ± SD score was 3.33 ± 3.79 for depression, 2.99 ± 3.65 for anxiety, and 5.93 ± 4.70 for psychological stress. The mean score of MIND in this study was 7.56. After adjustment for after adjusting for age, gender, intake of energy, BMI, history of chronic disease, marital status, education level, smoking history, physical activity level, pregnancy or lactation, intakes of dietary EPA, DHA, and fiber, individuals in highest compared to the lowest quartile of MIND diet score had significantly lower odds of depression (OR = 0.62, 95% CI 0.40 - 0.96; P-trend = 0.02) and anxiety (OR = 0.61, 95% CI 0.41 - 0.91; P-trend = 0.01). However, no significant association was observed for psychological stress (OR = 0.57, 95% CI 0.28 - 1.14; P-trend = 0.83). CONCLUSION: Therefore, it seems that following the MIND diet can prevent the possibility of these psychological problems. However, there is a need to design studies with more robust methodologies such as clinical trial studies.",

      "abstract": "The Mediterranean-DASH Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay (MIND) diet is an eating pattern associated with multiple health benefits, including the conservation of skeletal muscle. The Hand Grip Strength (HGS) is the most frequently used indicator of muscle functional capacity and muscle strength for clinical purposes. The current study aims to investigate the association between adherence to MIND diet and prevention of age-associated decline in muscle strength among the Kurdish population in Iran. This cross-sectional study was performed using data from Ravansar non-communicable diseases (RaNCD) cohort study on 3181 adults (48.5% men) aged 35-65 years. The dietary intake of the studied participants was assessed using a 114-item food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) developed by RaNCD cohort study. The MIND diet and the major dietary patterns were identified based on the participants' dietary intake and three dietary patterns emerged including plant-based diet, high protein diet, and unhealthy diet. Hand grip strength (HGS) was measured using a hand-held hydraulic handgrip dynamometer and poor HGS was defined as HGS less than 32.8 and 20.5 kg in men and women, respectively. Compared with participants in the lowest category of MIND diet, those in the highest category had lower odds of poor HGS (OR: 0.65; CI 95%: 0.51-0.83). Furthermore, participants who were in third tertiles of plant-based and high protein diet were more likely 37% and 33% lower odds ratio of poor HGS (OR: 0.63; CI 95%: 0.5-0.79), (OR: 0.67; CI 95%: 0.54-0.84), respectively. On the other hand, greater adherence to the unhealthy diet was increased odds of poor HGS (OR: 1.39; CI 95%: 1.11-1.74). Overall, our findings suggest that adherence to the MIND diet and high protein diet may be associated with higher HGS, while adherence to the unhealthy diet can increase the odds of age-associated poor HGS in the Kurdish population.",

We used three ongoing US cohorts: Chicago Health and Aging Project (CHAP, n = 2449), Rush Memory and Aging Project (MAP, n = 725), and Women’s Health Initiative Memory Study (WHIMS, n = 5308). Diagnosis of dementia was based on clinical neurological examination and standardized criteria. Repeated measures of global cognitive function were available in MAP and CHAP. Self-reported adherence to MIND was estimated using food-frequency questionnaires. Global and pathway-specific genetic scores (GS) for AD were derived. Cox proportional hazard, logistic regression, and mixed models were used to examine associations of MIND, GS, and GS-MIND interactions with incident dementia and cognitive decline. Higher adherence to MIND and lower GS were associated with a lower risk of dementia in MAP and WHIMS and a slower rate of cognitive decline in MAP (p < 0.05). MIND or GS were not associated with incident dementia or cognitive decline in CHAP. No gene−diet interaction was replicated across cohorts.

This study aimed to examine the effect of MIND dietary pattern on cognitive performance features and changes in brain structure in healthy obese women. As a total of 50 obese women were assessed for eligibility, we randomly allocated 40 participants with mean BMI 32 ± 4.31 kg/m2 and mean age 48 ± 5.38 years to either calorie-restricted modified MIND diet or a calorie-restricted standard control diet. Change in cognitive performance was the primary outcome measured with a comprehensive neuropsychological test battery. We also performed voxel-based morphometry as a secondary outcome to quantify the differences in brain structure. All of the measurements were administered at baseline and 3 months follow-up. Thirty-seven participants (MIND group = 22 and control group = 15) completed the study. The results found in the MIND diet group working memory + 1.37 (95% CI 0.79, 1.95), verbal recognition memory + 4.85 (95% CI 3.30, 6.40), and attention + 3.75 (95% CI 2.43, 5.07) improved more compared with the control group (ps < 0.05). Results of brain MRI consist of an increase in surface area of the inferior frontal gyrus in the MIND diet group. Furthermore, the results showed a decrease in the cerebellum-white matter and cerebellum-cortex in two groups of study. Still, the effect in the MIND group was greater than the control group. The study findings declare for the first time that the MIND diet intervention can reverse the destructive effects of obesity on cognition and brain structure, which could be strengthened by a modest calorie restriction.Clinical trial registration ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT04383704 (First registration date: 05/05/2020).",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The Mediterranean Dietary Approaches to the Stop Hypertension (DASH) Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay (MIND) diet has been shown to have beneficial neuroprotective effects. The purpose of this research was to evaluate the link between the MIND diet adherence and multiple sclerosis (MS), a degenerative neurological illness. METHODS: In a hospital-based case-control setting, 77 patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) and 148 healthy individuals were recruited. A validated 168-item semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire was used to assess participants' dietary intakes and the MIND diet score. A logistic regression model was used to evaluate the association between MIND diet adherence and MS. RESULTS: There was significant difference between RRMS and control groups in the median (Q1-Q3) of age (years, P value < 0.001), body mass index (BMI) (kg/m2, P value < 0.001), and total intake of calories (kcal, P value = 0.032), carbohydrates (g, P value = 0.003), animal-based protein (g, P value = 0.009), and fiber (g, P value = 0.001). Adherence to the MIND diet was associated with a reduced odds of MS [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 0.10, 95 percent confidence interval (95% CI) = 0.01-0.88, P for trend = 0.001]. MS odds was significantly lower in the last tertile of green leafy vegetables (aOR = 0.02, 95% CI = 0.00-0.21, P value < 0.001), other vegetables (aOR = 0.17, 95% CI = 0.04-0.73, P value = 0.001), butter and stick margarine (aOR = 0.20, 95% CI = 0.06-0.65, P value = 0.008), and beans (aOR = 0.05, 95% CI = 0.01-0.28, P value < 0.001) consumption. While it was significantly higher in the last tertile of cheese (aOR = 4.45, 95% CI = 1.70-11.6, P value = 0.003), poultry (aOR = 3.95, 95% CI = 1.01-15.5, P value = 0.039), pastries and sweets (aOR = 13.9, 95% CI = 3.04-64.18, P value < 0.001), and fried/fast foods (aOR = 32.8, 95% CI = 5.39-199.3, P value < 0.001). CONCLUSION: The MIND diet and its components, including green leafy vegetables, other vegetables, and beans, seem to decrease the odds of MS; besides butter and stick margarine, the MIND diet's unhealthy components seem to have the same protective effects, while pastries and sweets, cheese, poultry, and fried/fast foods have an inverse effect."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The relationship between the Mediterranean-DASH Diet Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay (MIND) diet and cognition has not been widely investigated in low- to middle-income countries. We investigated the relationship between MIND diet and cognition in the Brazilian Longitudinal Study of Adult Health (ELSA-Brasil) baseline data. METHODS: We included 11,788 participants. MIND diet adherence was based on the intake of 15 components according to a food frequency questionnaire. We analyzed the association between MIND diet adherence and global cognition, memory, and executive function using adjusted linear regression. We examined the interaction between income and MIND diet adherence on cognition and presented income stratified analyses. RESULTS: MIND diet adherence was not associated with cognition in the whole sample. Income was an effect modifier of MIND adherence on global cognition (P=0.03) and executive function (P<0.001). For participants with high income, greater adherence was associated with better executive function [β=0.015, 95% confidence interval (CI)=0.002; 0.028, P=0.025]; while for participants with low income, greater adherence was associated with lower global cognition (β=-0.020, 95% CI=-0.036; -0.005, P=0.010) and executive function (β=-0.023, 95% CI=-0.039; -0.007, P=0.004). Adherence to the MIND diet was higher among participants with high income (P<0.001). CONCLUSION: For high-income participants, greater adherence was associated with better cognitive performance; for low-income participants, greater adherence was associated with lower cognitive performance.",

      "abstract": "The Mediterranean-DASH intervention for neurodegenerative delay (MIND) and cardiovascular disease (CVD) has yet to be studied. As a result, the objective of this study was to investigate if there was a link between MIND diet adherence and the risk of CVD in adults over a 10.6-year period of time. There were 2863 participants in this research cohort who were free of CVD and were followed-up for 10.6 years. Using a validated food frequency questionnaire (FFQ), the MIND diet score was calculated. Reliable medical data was used to evaluate cardiovascular events, including coronary heart disease (CHD), stroke, and CVD-related mortality. A total of 200 CVD occurrences (159 CHD, 21 stroke, and 20 CVD fatalities) were documented throughout the 10.6-year follow-up period. Our results indicated each increase in MIND diet score reduced the incidence of CVD by 16% (HR: 0.84; 95% CI: 0.74 to 0.96). We also detected an inverse association relationship between the MIND diet and the incidence of CVD after classifying the MIND diet score into tertiles as well (HR: 0.68; 95% CI: 0.47 to 0.97). Among the components of the MIND diet, each increase in whole grains, green leafy vegetables, and beans reduced the risk of CVD by 60%, 45%, and 65%, respectively. Finally, our findings revealed that the higher adherence to the MIND was associated with a lower risk of cardiovascular events. Besides, we found an inverse association between consumption of whole grains, green leafy vegetables, and beans and the number of CVD incidents. However, more well-designed cohort studies are needed before conclusive conclusions can be formed.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Adherence to the Mediterranean-DASH Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay (MIND) diet has been linked to a decreased risk of dementia, but reverse causality and residual confounding by lifestyle may partly account for this link. We aimed to address these issues by studying the associations over cumulative time periods, which may provide insight into possible reverse causality, and by using both historical and more contemporary dietary data as this could give insight into confounding since historical data may be less affected by lifestyle factors. METHODS: In the population-based Rotterdam Study, dietary intake was assessed using validated food frequency questionnaires in 5375 participants between 1989 and 1993 (baseline I) and in a largely non-overlapping sample in 2861 participants between 2009 and 2013 (baseline II). We calculated the MIND diet score and studied its association with the risk of all-cause dementia, using Cox models. Incident all-cause dementia was recorded until 2018. RESULTS: During a mean follow-up of 15.6 years from baseline I, 1188 participants developed dementia. A higher MIND diet score at baseline I was associated with a lower risk of dementia over the first 7 years of follow-up (hazard ratio (HR) [95% confidence interval (CI)] per standard deviation (SD) increase, 0.85 [0.74, 0.98]), but associations disappeared over longer follow-up intervals. The mean follow-up from baseline II was 5.9 years during which 248 participants developed dementia. A higher MIND diet score at baseline II was associated with a lower risk of dementia over every follow-up interval, but associations slightly attenuated over time (HR [95% CI] for 7 years follow-up per SD increase, 0.76 [0.66, 0.87]). The MIND diet score at baseline II was more strongly associated with the risk of dementia than the MIND diet score at baseline I. CONCLUSION: Better adherence to the MIND diet is associated with a decreased risk of dementia within the first years of follow-up, but this may in part be explained by reverse causality and residual confounding by lifestyle. Further research is needed to unravel to which extent the MIND diet may affect the risk of dementia.",

OBJECTIVES: We aimed to investigate associations of the Mediterranean-Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay (MIND) diet with physical function and grip strength. METHODS: Data were obtained from men and women in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (mean ± SD age: 68 ± 14 y at first diet visit; n = 1358). Diet was assessed by FFQ. MIND diet score was calculated from 15 food groups, with a higher score indicating better diet quality; tertile categories of averaged MIND score across visits were used. Physical function was assessed using the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB), with a score < 10 indicative of impaired function, and the Health, Aging and Body Composition Physical Performance Battery (HABCPPB). The highest value of grip strength over 3 trials was used. Multivariable logistic and linear mixed-effects models were examined with repeated measurements of physical function and grip strength, respectively. RESULTS: MIND score was inversely associated with physical function impairment (per 1-point increment: OR: 0.81; 95% CI: 0.71, 0.93; P < 0.01), and with each SPPB component, over a median 6 y of follow-up. Participants in the highest compared with the lowest tertile of MIND diet score had 57% lower odds of functional impairment (OR: 0.43; 95% CI: 0.25, 0.73; P < 0.01), and slower decline by the HABCPPB. Men and women in the highest compared with the lowest tertiles of MIND score had 1.86-kg (95% CI: 0.33, 3.40 kg; P < 0.05) and 1.24-kg (95% CI: 0.04, 2.45 kg; P < 0.05) greater grip strength, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Adherence to the MIND dietary pattern was associated with lower odds of physical function impairment and decline, and with better muscle strength, indicating that the MIND dietary pattern may be protective of physical functional health in older adults.",

The MIND Diet Intervention is a randomized control trial to determine the relative effectiveness of the MIND diet in slowing cognitive decline and reducing brain atrophy in older adults at risk for Alzheimer's dementia. METHODS: The MIND cognitive function battery was administered at baseline to 604 participants of an average age of 70 years, who agreed to participate in the diet intervention study, and was designed to measure change over time. The battery included 12 cognitive tests, measuring the 4 cognitive domains of executive function, perceptual speed, episodic memory, and semantic memory. We conducted a principal component analysis to examine the consistency between our theoretical domains and the statistical performance of participants in each domain. To further establish the validity of each domain, we regressed the domain scores against a late-life cognitive activity score, controlling for age, race, sex, and years of education. RESULTS: Four factors emerged in the principal component analyses that were similar to the theoretical domains. In regression equations, we found the expected associations with age, education, and late-life cognitive activity with each of the four cognitive domains. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that the MIND cognitive battery is a comprehensive and valid battery of four separate domains of cognitive function that can be used in diet intervention trials for older adults.",

Socioeconomic factors including education, poverty, and job complexity may modify the relationship between diet and cognition. METHODS: We used adjusted linear mixed models to examine the association between long-term adherence to the Mediterranean-Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension - Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay (MIND) diet and cognitive function over 8 years of follow-up in Puerto Rican adults residing in the Boston, MA area (aged 45-75 years at baseline). We also examined whether the MIND diet-cognition association was confounded or modified by socioeconomic measures. RESULTS: In both cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses the highest, versus lowest, MIND quintile was associated with better cognition function (β = 0.093; 95% CI: 0.035, 0.152; p trend = .0019), but not with cognitive trajectory over 8 years. Education <=8th grade (β = -0.339; 95% CI: 0.394, -0.286; p < .0001) and income-to-poverty ratio <120% (β = -0.049; 95% CI: -0.092, -0.007; p = .024) were significantly associated with lower cognitive function, while higher job complexity (β = 0.008; 95% CI: 0.006, 0.011; p < .0001) was associated with better cognition function. These variables acted as confounders, but not effect modifiers of the MIND-diet-cognitive function relationship. CONCLUSION: Adherence to the MIND diet was associated with better cognitive function at baseline and over 8 years of follow-up; however, MIND diet was not associated with 8-year cognitive trajectory. More studies are needed to better understand whether the MIND diet is protective against long-term cognitive decline.",

Caveolin 1 (CAV1) the key protein in the caval structure of plasma membranes is many cell types that play an important role in its function. (CAV1) is a known gene associated with obesity. Today, a novel diet recognized as the Mediterranean and Mediterranean-DASH Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay diet (MIND) is reported to have a positive effect on overall health. Hence, we aimed to investigate the interactions between CAV1 polymorphism and MIND diet on the MD in overweight and obese patients. RESULTS: Remarkably, there was a significant interaction between the MIND diet and CAV1 rs3807992 for dyslipidemia (β = - 0.25 ± 132, P = 0.05) in the crude model. Whereby, subjects with dominant alleles had a lower risk of dyslipidemia and risk allele carriers with higher adherence to the MIND diet may exhibit the lower dyslipidemia. This study presented the CAV1 gene as a possible genetic marker in recognizing people at higher risks for metabolic diseases. It also indicated that using the MIND diet may help in improving dyslipidemia through providing a probable interaction with CAV1 rs3807992 polymorphism.",

This study was aimed to examine the association between adherence to the MIND diet and risk of breast cancer (BC) among Iranian women. METHODS: In this hospital-based case-control study, 150 newly diagnosed BC cases and 150 age-matched controls were included. All cases were pathologically confirmed BC patients, with no history of any type of other pathologically confirmed cancers. Controls were selected from visitors, relatives and friends of non-cancer patients in other wards, which had no family relationship with cases. Dietary intakes of study participants were assessed using a validated 147-item semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire (FFQ). The MIND diet score was computed based on participants' dietary intakes obtained from FFQ, Regression logistic models were used to examine the association between the MIND diet score and BC. RESULTS: Examining the whole study population, we found no significant association between the MIND diet score and odds of BC, either before (ORs for comparing T3 vs. T1: 0.818; 95% CI: 0.469-1.42, P-trend = .48) or after controlling for potential confounders (ORs for T3 vs. T1: 1.32; 95% CI: 0.31-5.64, P-trend = .633). This was also the case for pre-menopausal and post-menopausal when analyzed separately. We also failed to find any significant association between the MIND diet score and odds of BC after controlling for potential confounders in both pre-menopausal and post-menopausal. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, we found that adherence to the MIND diet was not associated with odds of BC in this case-control study. Further studies are required to confirm these findings.",

Articles that evaluated the association between MIND diet and cognitive performance in older adults were included. Duplicated and irrelevant studies were screened out and data were obtained through critical analysis. Quality of the articles and risk of bias was assessed by Newcastle-Ottawa and Cochrane Collaboration's quality assessment tools. Of the 135 studies retrieved, 13 articles (9 cohort, 3 cross-sectional, and 1 RCT studies) were included in the final review. All of the included studies indicated that adherence to the MIND diet was positively associated with specific domains, but not all, of cognition and global cognitive function (78% of the studies) in older adults. MIND diet was superior to other plant-rich diets including Mediterranean, Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension, Pro-Vegetarian and Baltic Sea diets, for improving cognition.

METHODS: This was a qualitative study examining factors influencing Mediterranean-DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay (MIND) diet behaviour. This study further elaborated the COM-B components into the 14 domains of the Theoretical Domains Framework to further understand behaviour. Twenty-five Northern Irish and Italian participants were recruited onto the study, to take part in either a focus group or an interview. Participants were both male and female aged between 40 and 55 years. RESULTS: Thematic analysis revealed that the main barriers to the uptake of the MIND diet were; time, work environment (opportunity), taste preference and convenience (motivation). Culture (motivation), seasonal foods and lack of family support (opportunity) to be a barrier to the Italian sample only. The main facilitators reported were; improved health, memory, planning and organisation (motivation) and access to good quality food (opportunity). Cooking skills, knowledge (capability) and heathy work lunch (opportunity) reported as a facilitator to the Italian sample only. CONCLUSIONS: Cross-cultural differences in relation to psychosocial barriers and facilitators were found in both samples. More barriers than facilitators towards uptake of the MIND diet were found. There is a need for interventions that increase capability, opportunity, and motivation to aid behaviour change. The findings from this study will be used to design a behaviour change intervention using the subsequent steps from the Behaviour Change Wheel.",

      "abstract": "Alzheimer's dementia (AD) is the sixth leading cause of death in the U.S., with an estimated $305 billion cost of care in 2020. Currently there are no cures or therapies to ameliorate the disease progression and symptoms. Growing evidence links a diet characterized by high antioxidant components with benefits to cognitive function, which is indicative of the preventative potential of dietary inteventions. The Mediterranean-DASH Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay (MIND) study is a 3-year, multicenter, randomized controlled trial to test the effects of the MIND diet on cognitive function in 604 individuals at risk for AD. Men and women ages 65 to 84 years were recruited. Eligible participants were randomized to either the MIND diet with mild caloric restriction or their usual diet with mild caloric restriction. Cognitive assessments, medical history, blood pressure, anthropometric measurements, and blood and urine sample collections will be taken at baseline and follow-up visits. MRI scans will be completed on approximately half of the enrolled participants at the start and end of the study. Unique features of the MIND study include: 1) a dietary pattern, rather than single nutrient or food, tested in an at-risk population; 2) foods featured as key components of the MIND diet (i.e. extra-virgin olive oil, blueberries, and nuts) provided for participants; and 3) MRI scans of brain structure and volume that may provide potential mechanistic evidence on the effects of the diet. Results from the study will be crucial to the development of dietary guidelines for the prevention of AD.",

Thus, this study aimed to investigate the association of adherence to the MIND diet with MetS and general and abdominal obesity. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was performed on 836 Iranian adults, 18-75 years old. A 167-item food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) was used to assess dietary intakes of participants. Anthropometric measurements, blood pressure, fasting blood glucose and lipid profile of each participant were recorded. The guidelines of the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III (ATP III) was used to define MetS. RESULTS: Mean age of study participants was 47.7 ± 10.7 years. The prevalence of MetS was 36.1% and mean body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference (WC) was 27.7 ± 4.69 kg/m2 and 92.0 ± 12.4 cm respectively. Those who were in the third tertile of the MIND diet score compared to the first tertile had 12% lower odds of having the MetS (ORs: 0.88; 95% CI 0.62-1.24) but the association was not significant (P = 0.77). There was a significant inverse association between the MIND diet score and odds of reduced high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) (ORs: 0.59; 95% CI 0.41-0.85; P = 0.008) and general obesity (ORs: 1.190.80-1.78; 95% CI 0.80-1.78; P = 0.02) in crude model and after controlling for confounders. CONCLUSIONS: We found that the MIND diet score is inversely associated with odds of reduced HDL and general obesity in Iranian adults."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This population-based case-control study was conducted among women aged ≥ 30 years, who were residing in Isfahan, Iran. The study included 350 patients with newly diagnosed stage I to IV breast cancer, for whom in situ or invasive status of breast cancer was confirmed by physical examination, mammography, and pathologic verification. Controls were 700 age-matched apparently healthy individuals who were randomly selected from the general population. Dietary data were collected using a validated 106-item Willett-format, semi-quantitative dish-based food frequency questionnaire. RESULTS: After adjustment for age and energy intake, women in the top tertile of the MIND diet score had 60% lower odds of breast cancer than women in the bottom tertile (odds ratio [OR], 0.40; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.29-0.55). In the fully adjusted model including body mass index, those with the greatest MIND diet scores had 50% lower chance of breast cancer (OR, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.34-0.72) than those with the lowest adherence to the MIND diet. Postmenopausal women with the greatest adherence to the MIND diet were less likely to have breast cancer than those in the bottom tertile (OR, 0.45; 95% CI, 0.30-0.66). In addition, we found a significant inverse association between adherence to the MIND diet and odds of breast cancer among normal-weight women (OR, 0.39; 95% CI, 0.25-0.60). CONCLUSION: Adherence to the MIND diet was associated with a reduced chance of breast cancer in this case-control study.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To prospectively evaluate the association of three dietary patterns: the MIND (Mediterranean-DASH diet intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay) diet; a Mediterranean-type diet and a traditional diet, with all-cause mortality over a 12-year period in an older sample. DESIGN: A longitudinal birth cohort study. We ascertained dietary patterns using FFQ data at baseline (2004-2007) and mortality using linkage data. Cox regression was used to estimate mortality hazard ratios (HR) with adjustment for confounders. SETTING: The Lothian Birth Cohort 1936 (LBC1936) study in Edinburgh, Scotland. PARTICIPANTS: Dietary patterns were ascertained in 882 participants, mean age 69·5 (±0·8) years, at baseline. During the 12-year follow-up (to October 2019), 206 deaths occurred. RESULTS: In the basic-adjusted model, all three dietary patterns were significantly associated with mortality, the MIND diet and Mediterranean-type diet with a lower risk and the traditional diet with a higher risk. In fully adjusted models, MIND diet score was inversely related to all-cause mortality (HR 0·88; 95 % CI 0·79, 0·97) such that the risk of death was reduced by 12 % per unit increase in MIND diet score. Participants in the top compared with the bottom third of MIND diet score had a 37 % lower risk of death (HR 0·63; 95 % CI 0·41, 0·96). No significant associations with the Mediterranean-type or traditional dietary patterns were observed in the final multivariate model. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that closer adherence to the MIND diet is associated with a significantly lower risk of all-cause mortality, over 12 years of follow-up, and may constitute a valid public health recommendation for prolonged survival.",

DESIGN: This is a qualitative study using the COM-B model and theoretical domains framework (TDF) to explore beliefs to adopting the Mediterranean-DASH Intervention for Neurodegenerative delay (MIND) diet. SETTING: Northern Ireland. PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-five participants were recruited onto the study to take part in either a focus group or an interview. Participants were men and women aged between 40 and 55 years. Participants were recruited via email, Facebook and face to face. RESULTS: Content analysis revealed that the main perceived barriers to the adoption of the MIND diet were time, work environment, taste preference and convenience. The main perceived facilitators reported were improved health, memory, planning and organisation, and access to good quality food. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides insight into the personal, social and environmental factors that participants report as barriers and facilitators to the adoption of the MIND diet among middle-aged adults living in the UK. More barriers to healthy dietary change were found than facilitators. Future interventions that increase capability, opportunity and motivation may be beneficial.

Emerging studies are examining this dietary pattern with chronic conditions. We aimed to investigate the association between the MIND diet score and general and central obesity among adults. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted in a framework of the Study on the Epidemiology of Psychological Alimentary Health and Nutrition (SEPAHAN). Dietary information was collected using a validated self-administered 106-item Willett-format dish-based semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire (DS-FFQ) in 6724 adults. Adherence to the MIND diet was examined based on components suggested in this eating pattern. Anthropometrics data were collected using a validated self-reported questionnaire. General obesity was defined as body mass index ≥30 kg/m2, and abdominal obesity as waist circumference > 102 cm for men and > 88 cm for women. RESULTS: Mean age, BMI and WC in the study population was 36.8 ± 8.08 y, 24.9 ± 3.8 kg/m2 and 83.7 ± 16.02 cm, respectively. Overall, 9.5% of subjects were generally obese and 24.4 were abdominally obese. Examining the whole study population, we found no significant association between the MIND diet score and odds of general obesity, either before (ORs for comparing T3 vs. T1: 1.03; 95% CI: 0.83, 1.27; P-trend = 0.74) or after controlling for potential confounders (ORs for T3 vs. T1: 0.91; 95% CI: 0.67, 1.25; P-trend = 0.58). This was also the case for men and women when analyzed separately. We also failed to find any significant association between the MIND diet score and odds of abdominal obesity after controlling for potential confounders in the whole study population (ORs for T3 vs. T1: 1.00, 95% CI: 0.79, 1.27; P-trend = 0.87). However, women with the greatest adherence to the MIND diet were 19% less likely to be abdominally obese than those with the lowest adherence in crude model (OR = 0.81; 95% CIs: 0.67, 0.98; P-trend = 0.03). This association disappeared after controlling for potential confounders (OR = 0.87; 95% CIs: 0.66, 1.14; P-trend = 0.55). CONCLUSION: No significant association was observed between adherence to the MIND diet and odds of general and central obesity.",

DESIGN: We analyzed 106 participants of a community cohort study who had completed a diet assessment and two or more annual cognitive assessments and who also had a clinical history of stroke. Cognition in five cognitive domains was assessed using structured clinical evaluations that included a battery of 19 cognitive tests. MIND diet scores were computed using a valid food frequency questionnaire (FFQ). Dietary components of the MIND diet included whole grains, leafy greens and other vegetables, berries, beans, nuts, lean meats, fish, poultry, and olive oil and reduced consumption of cheese, butter, fried foods, and sweets. MIND diet scores were modeled in tertiles. The influence of baseline MIND score on change in a global cognitive function measure and in the five cognitive domains was assessed using linear mixed models adjusted for age and other potential confounders. RESULTS: With adjustment for age, sex, education, APOE-ε4, caloric intake, smoking, and participation in cognitive and physical activities, the top vs lowest tertiles of MIND diet scores had a slower rate of global cognitive decline (β = .08; CI = 0.0074, 0.156) over an average of 5.9 years of follow-up.

METHODS: The study sample consisted of 6011 participants aged ≥ 60 years at baseline, without SMC at the beginning. SMC were defined by a CDS score ≥ 43 (corresponding to the 4th CDS quartile) and SMC cases were participants with SMC at least once during follow-up. The MIND diet score (0-15 points) is a hybrid of the Mediterranean Diet and the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) scores, which includes ten brain healthy food groups and five unhealthy food groups. We used Cox proportional hazards models to estimate Hazard Ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). RESULTS: Over a mean follow-up of 6 years, approximately 15% and 30% cases of SMC were identified among participants aged 60-69 and ≥ 70 years, respectively. The MIND diet score was not significantly associated with SMC in the full sample and among participants aged 60-69 years. Among participants aged ≥ 70 years, a significant inverse association was observed between adherence to the MIND diet and SMC (HRtertile 3 vs tertile 1 = 0.69, 95% CI = 0.47-0.99). This relationship was strengthened after exclusion of participants with depressive symptoms (HRtertile 2 vs tertile 1 = 0.69, 95% CI = 0.49-0.97; HRtertile 3 vs tertile 1 = 0.62, 95% CI = 0.41-0.93). CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that the MIND diet could help to prevent or delay SMC among older adults without depressive symptoms.",

In this study, we examined the association of a diet specifically developed to promote brain health, called MIND (Mediterranean-DASH Diet Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay), to the incidence and progression of parkinsonism in older adults. METHODS: A total of 706 Memory and Aging Project participants aged 59 -97 years and without parkinsonism at baseline were assessed annually for the presence of four parkinsonian signs using a 26-item modified version of the United Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale. Incident parkinsonism was defined as the first occurrence over 4.6 years of follow-up of two or more parkinsonian signs. The progression of parkinsonism was assessed by change in a global parkinsonian score (range: 0-100). MIND, Mediterranean, and DASH diet pattern scores were computed based on a validated food frequency questionnaire including 144 food items. We employed Cox-Proportional Hazard models and linear mixed models, to examine the associations of baseline diet scores with incident parkinsonism and the annual rate of change in global parkinsonian score, respectively. RESULTS: In models adjusted for age, sex, smoking, total energy intake, BMI and depressive symptoms, higher MIND diet scores were associated with a decreased risk of parkinsonism [(HR=0.89, 95% CI 0.83-0.96)]; and a slower rate of parkinsonism progression [(β= -0.008; SE=0.0037; p=0.04)]. The Mediterranean diet was marginally associated with reduced parkinsonism progression (β= -0.002; SE=0.0014; p=0.06). The DASH diet, by contrast, was not associated with either outcome. CONCLUSION: The MIND diet created for brain health may be a associated with decreased risk and slower progression of parkinsonism in older adults.",

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: To prospectively evaluate the association of the Mediterranean-DASH diet intervention for neurodegenerative delay (MIND) diet and the Mediterranean diet (and their components), and depression risk. METHODS: We followed-up (median 10.4 years) 15,980 adults initially free of depression at baseline or in the first 2 years of follow-up. Food consumption was measured at baseline through a validated food-frequency questionnaire, and was used to compute adherence to the MIND and the Mediterranean diets. Relationships between these two diets and incident depression were assessed through Cox regression models. RESULTS: We identified 666 cases of incident depression. Comparing the highest versus the lowest quartiles of adherence, we found no association of the MIND diet and incident depression. This relation was statistically significant for the Mediterranean diet {hazard ratio (HR) 0.75, [95% confidence interval (95% CI) 0.61, 0.94]; p < 0.01}, although with departure from linearity. A reduced depression risk was associated with higher consumption of both fruits and nuts [HR 0.82 (95% CI 0.69, 0.96); p = 0.02], moderate nuts consumption [HR 0.77 (95% CI 0.64, 0.93); p = 0.01], and avoidance of fast/fried food [HR 0.63 (95% CI 0.41, 0.96); p = 0.03]. CONCLUSIONS: The Mediterranean diet was associated with reduced depression risk, but we found no evidence of such an association for the MIND diet.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: There is increasing attention for dietary patterns as a potential strategy to prevent cognitive decline. We examined the association between adherence to a recently developed Mediterranean-DASH Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay (MIND) diet with cognitive function and cognitive decline, taking into account the interaction between the apolipoprotein E ε4 genotype and the MIND diet. DESIGN: Population-based prospective cohort study. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 16,058 older women aged 70 and over from the Nurses' Health Study. MEASUREMENTS: Dietary intake was assessed five times between 1984 and 1998 with a 116-item Food Frequency Questionnaire. The MIND score includes ten brain-healthy foods and five unhealthy foods. Cognition was assessed four times by telephone from 1995 to 2001 (baseline) with the Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status (TICS) and by calculating composite scores of verbal memory and global cognition. Linear regression modelling and linear mixed modelling were used to examine the associations of adherence to the MIND diet with average cognitive function and cognitive change over six years, respectively. RESULTS: Greater long-term adherence to the MIND diet was associated with a better verbal memory score (multivariable-adjusted mean differences between extreme MIND quintiles=0.04 (95%CI 0.01-0.07), p-trend=0.006), but not with cognitive decline over 6 years in global cognition, verbal memory or TICS. CONCLUSION: Long-term adherence to the MIND diet was moderately associated with better verbal memory in later life. Future studies should address this association within populations at greater risk of cognitive decline.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The Mediterranean and dash diets have been shown to slow cognitive decline; however, neither diet is specific to the nutrition literature on dementia prevention. METHODS: We devised the Mediterranean-Dietary Approach to Systolic Hypertension (DASH) diet intervention for neurodegenerative delay (MIND) diet score that specifically captures dietary components shown to be neuroprotective and related it to change in cognition over an average 4.7 years among 960 participants of the Memory and Aging Project. RESULTS: In adjusted mixed models, the MIND score was positively associated with slower decline in global cognitive score (β = 0.0092; P < .0001) and with each of five cognitive domains. The difference in decline rates for being in the top tertile of MIND diet scores versus the lowest was equivalent to being 7.5 years younger in age. DISCUSSION: The study findings suggest that the MIND diet substantially slows cognitive decline with age. Replication of these findings in a dietary intervention trial would be required to verify its relevance to brain health.",
