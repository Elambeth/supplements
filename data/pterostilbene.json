      "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia, and no effective treatment has been developed for it thus far. Recently, the use of natural compounds in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases has garnered significant attention owing to their minimal adverse reactions. Accordingly, the potential therapeutic effect of pterostilbene (PTS) on AD has been demonstrated in multiple in vivo and in vitro experiments. In this study, we systematically reviewed and summarized the results of these studies investigating the use of PTS for treating AD. Analysis of the literature revealed that PTS may play a role in AD treatment through various mechanisms, including anti-oxidative damage, anti-neuroinflammation, anti-apoptosis, cholinesterase activity inhibition, attenuation of β-amyloid deposition, and tau protein hyperphosphorylation. Moreover, PTS interferes with the progression of AD by regulating the activities of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPAR-α), monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B), silent information regulator sirtuin 1 (SIRT1), and phosphodiesterase 4A (PDE4A). Furthermore, to further elucidate the potential therapeutic mechanisms of PTS in AD, we employed network pharmacology and molecular docking technology to perform molecular docking of related proteins, and the obtained binding energies ranged from -2.83 to -5.14 kJ/mol, indicating that these proteins exhibit good binding ability with PTS. Network pharmacology analysis revealed multiple potential mechanisms of action for PTS in AD. In summary, by systematically collating and summarizing the relevant studies on the role of PTS in treatment of AD, it is anticipated that this will serve as a reference for the precise targeted prevention and treatment of AD, either using PTS or other developed drug interventions."

      "abstract": "Pterostilbene (3,5-dimethoxy-40-hydroxystilbene) is a potent oral antioxidant with a promising role in anti-cancer treatment. In endometrial cancer (EC), in vitro studies demonstrated a synergistic antiproliferative effect of pterostilbene (PT) with megestrol acetate (MA), a common treatment for EC. This is a randomized phase II clinical trial (NCT03671811) of PT+MA vs. MA for three weeks prior to scheduled hysterectomy. The primary objective is to determine the antiproliferative effect of PT+MA vs. MA using Ki-67 index. The secondary objectives are toxicity, histological response, transcriptional changes, and lipid metabolism. A total of 44 patients were enrolled between January 2019 and November 2022 with 23 randomized to Arm 1 (PT+MA) and 21 to Arm 2 (MA). Toxicities included one G3 thromboembolic event (PT+MA) and one G3 hypertension event (MA). Histological responses were high in both arms (>90%). There was no difference in Ki-67 changes, although, when restricted to endometroid subtype, the relative decrease in Ki67 was 33.8% in PT+MA vs. 20.1% in MA alone (p = 0.14). Whole transcriptomic gene profiling of samples before and after PT+MA exposure demonstrated the activation of interferon alpha response pathway and suppression of mTORC1 signaling, hypoxia, oxidative phosphorylation, and IL2-STAT5 signaling. Lipid metabolism analyses did not reveal any significant changes between arms. PT is well-tolerated in the preoperative treatment of EC and demonstrated in vivo anti-cancer effects on the transcriptomic level."

      "abstract": "Chronic hyperglycemia is a major driver of neurovascular damage in diabetic retinopathy (DR), a leading cause of preventable blindness in adults. DR progression is often undetected until its advanced stages, with oxidative stress recognized as a primary contributor. In diabetes, oxidative stress disrupts retinal cellular balance, damaging proteins, DNA, and lipids, and triggering photoreceptor degeneration. Pterostilbene (Pter), a polyphenol with antioxidant properties, has demonstrated protective effects in DR animal models and was assessed in a pilot clinical study. DR patients treated with 250 mg/day of oral Pter showed a reduction in the development of retinal vascular alterations characteristic of the disease. Urinary analyses confirmed Pter's role in reducing the lipid peroxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), including arachidonic and adrenic acids, indicators of oxidative damage in DR. Pter also improved the GSH/GSSG ratio, reflecting a restored redox balance. However, after six months without treatment, retinal damage indicators reappeared, highlighting the importance of sustained intervention. These findings suggest that Pter may help slow the progression of DR by protecting against oxidative stress and highlight the importance of implementing antioxidant therapies from the diagnosis of diabetes, although its long-term impact and the development of consistent biomarkers deserve more research to optimize DR management."

      "abstract": "Pterostilbene, a stilbenoid found in vegetables and natural products, has therapeutic potential due to its multiple pharmacological actions. In the brain, the nerve growth factor (NGF) is a pivotal neurotrophic factor, serving for neuronal survival and differentiation. The decline in NGF levels in aged individuals contributes to the development of neurodegenerative processes and cognitive impairment. Here, we aim to explore the effect of pterostilbene on promoting neuron-like differentiation in PC12 cells, a well-established model to study neuronal differentiation, by potentiating the functions of NGF. Molecular docking and ultrafiltration assays were performed to examine the direct binding of pterostilbene with NGF. The mechanisms underlying the stimulation of PC12 cell differentiation, characterized by enhanced neurite outgrowth and increased neurofilament expression, were determined through TrkA/Akt/CREB signaling pathways. The combined treatment of pterostilbene with a low dose of NGF significantly potentiated the NGF-induced neurite extension and neurofilament expression. Pterostilbene enhanced the effect of NGF on promoting neuron-like differentiation, which was related to increased activation of the TrkA signaling pathway. This upstream event was associated with increased phosphorylation of Akt and CREB. The selective inhibitors of TrkA (K252a) and PI3K/Akt (LY294002) were applied to validate the NGF/TrkA/Akt signaling pathways leading to diminished neurite outgrowth and reduced expression of neurofilaments in cells treated with pterostilbene and NGF. Taken together, the results indicate that pterostilbene could potentiate NGF/TrkA activity, enhancing neuron-like differentiation in PC12 cells under a low concentration of NGF. These findings suggest that the application of pterostilbene could be a promising alternative therapeutic strategy to improve NGF efficacy.",

      "abstract": "Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is a significant infectious disease with limited treatment options. Pterostilbene, an active compound found in blueberries, is known for its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. This study investigated the effects of pterostilbene on intestinal barrier damage and secondary liver oxidative stress induced by CDI in mice. Pathological changes in the colon and liver, the levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines and antioxidants, and the expression of related genes were evaluated. Additionally, 16S rRNA sequencing and targeted metabolomics analyses of the gut microbiota and bile acids were conducted. Pterostilbene reduced the abundance of harmful bacteria such as Enterococcus, while increasing beneficial bacteria like Lactobacillus, thereby reshaping the gut microbiota and bile acid profile and reducing the accumulation of T-βMCA. This process activated intestinal FXR signaling, which alleviated colonic inflammation and reduced intestinal permeability. The reduction in intestinal permeability prevented the translocation of bacteria and bacterial toxins into the liver via the portal vein, thereby reducing liver inflammation and oxidative stress. Pterostilbene presented a promising strategy for maintaining intestinal health through the regulation of dysbiosis and bile acid disturbances caused by CDI. When integrated into the food system, pterostilbene has the potential to improve intestinal health, mitigate the risk of CDI associated with contaminated agricultural products, and enhance public health and food safety. Additionally, we identified that regulating the intestinal bile acid profile and the FXR receptor could serve as potential therapeutic targets for CDI, thereby facilitating the development of novel treatment options and dietary strategies."

      "abstract": "This study investigated the molecular targets and pathways modulated by pterostilbene in breast cancer using network pharmacology and in vitro analysis. The structure of chemicals of pterostilbene was retrieved from PubChem, and gene targets were predicted through Swiss Target Prediction. Human-specific targets were validated using UniProtKB and breast cancer-related targets were identified using GeneCards and BioVenn. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks were created using STRING and visualized using Cytoscape, followed by Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analyses to elucidate biological functions. Molecular docking studies using AutoDock Vina were used to assess the binding interactions of pterostilbene with key nuclear receptors (PTGS2, ESR1, EGFR, and BCL2). Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations over 200 ns in GROMACS confirmed the stability of the ESR1-pterostilbene complex and highlighted significant hydrogen bonding. ADME/T was assessed using the Protox software. In vitro cytotoxicity was assessed using the MTT assay in MCF-7 cells. Sixteen key genes, including PTGS2, ESR1, EGFR, and BCL2, were identified as key targets connecting pterostilbene to breast cancer. PPI analysis identified ESR1, EGFR, and BCL2 as central nodes in the network. Molecular docking revealed robust binding of pterostilbene (below - 8.1 kcal/mol), suggesting potential modulation of estrogen receptor signaling. MD simulations confirmed the stability of the complex with favorable structural dynamics. Toxicity analysis suggested a low risk, and MTT assays revealed selective cytotoxicity of pterostilbene toward MCF-7 breast cancer cells (IC50 = 14.8 µM) with a Selectivity Index of 2.85 compared to normal HEL 299 cells. These findings highlight the potential of pterostilbene as a treatment option for breast cancer, which merits additional exploration in experimental models and human studies."

      "abstract": "Cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury (CIRI) is the primary cause of damage following ischemic stroke, with ferroptosis serving as a key pathophysiological factor in CIRI. Pterostilbene (PTE) has been shown to reduce cerebral ischemic injury, but whether its mechanism of action involves ferroptosis remains unclear. In this study, an in vitro model of mouse hippocampal neuron (HT22) cell injury and an in vivo mouse CIRI model were established. Treatments included PTE, the ferroptosis activator Erastin, and the Wnt signaling pathway inhibitor (Dkk-1). Cell damage was assessed using flow cytometry, MTT assay, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release assay, and Calcein-AM/PI staining. Oxidative stress and ferroptosis in cells and tissues were evaluated using biochemical kits and fluorescence staining. Additionally, histopathological staining was performed to assess brain tissue damage, while qRT-PCR and Western blot analyses were used to measure ferroptosis-related factors and Wnt/β-catenin pathway-related proteins in both cells and tissues. HT22 cells subjected to injury exhibited decreased viability and increased cell death (P < 0.05). Similarly, CIRI mice demonstrated pronounced cerebral infarction and neuronal damage. Ferroptosis, characterized by elevated levels of iron ions, lipid peroxides (ROS and MDA), and reduced antioxidant enzymes (GSH and GPX4), was significantly increased in both cells and tissues (P < 0.05). Correspondingly, ferroptosis-related protein levels were elevated (P < 0.05), while Wnt/β-catenin pathway-related protein levels were significantly decreased (P < 0.05). Treatment with Erastin and Dkk-1 exacerbated neuronal damage, intensified ferroptosis, and inhibited the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. Conversely, PTE treatment activated the Wnt/β-catenin pathway, reduced ferroptosis, and improved neuronal damage. Specifically, PTE upregulated the Wnt/β-catenin pathway, decreased peroxide accumulation, and antagonized ferroptosis, ultimately mitigating CIRI. These findings suggest that PTE protects against CIRI by modulating the Wnt/β-catenin pathway and alleviating ferroptosis-induced damage."

Some studies suggested that cancer can be treated by inducing apoptosis. Therefore, finding new drugs for related or adjuvant treatments has become important. PT is a natural derivative of resveratrol. The antioxidant effects of PT include the scavenging of extracellular ROS and the induction of apoptosis. PT has been shown to induce several types of tumor cell death; however, the detailed mechanism of action remains unclear. The present examined PT's cytotoxicity and apoptosis-inducing abilities as an anti-bladder cancer drug in normal bladder epithelial and bladder cancer cells. Under PT treatment, bladder cancer HTB-9 cells showed a significant apoptotic effect compared to normal bladder epithelial SV-HUC-1 cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Fluorescence microscopy, flow cytometry, and western blotting showed a positive correlation with the expression of apoptotic proteins, especially caspase-3. PT promoted the apoptosis of bladder cancer cells in a time- and dose-dependent manner and had no significant effect on normal bladder epithelial cells involved in internal and external apoptotic pathways, especially the internal ones. The results demonstrate the potential of PT to promote apoptotic death in bladder cancer cells, suggesting its possible use as a drug to treat bladder cancer.",

Currently, the resistance of GC cells to cisplatin remains a major concern. Pterostilbene (PTS) is a natural phytochemical found in blueberry and grape. The anti-cisplatin-resistant GC effects and pharmacological mechanisms of PTS are unknown. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We investigated the anticancer activity of PTS in cisplatin-resistant GC cells and explored its pharmacological mechanisms of action via cell viability assay, cell confluence assay, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining, acridine orange (AO) staining, monodansylcadaverine (MDC) staining, caspase-9/-3 activity assay, and RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) analysis. RESULTS: Our results showed that PTS inhibited cell viability and cell confluence of cisplatin-resistant GC cells using the CCK-8 assay and the IncuCyte S3 ZOOM System. The TUNEL assay showed that PTS promoted apoptosis in cisplatin-resistant GC cells. PTS induced apoptosis by increasing caspase-9 and caspase-3 activity. PTS promoted cell autophagy by increasing vacuole formation and acidic vesicular organelles using MDC and AO staining. We also observed an increase in the expression of LC3B in PTS-treated cisplatin-resistant GC cells. RNA-Seq analysis demonstrated that PTS induced apoptosis and autophagy in cisplatin-resistant GC cells by decreasing the expression of ATM/ATR, HIF-1, PI3K, RB1CC, TBK1, and mitochondria-related genes. CONCLUSION: Our results suggested that PTS is a promising phytochemical for GC therapy, particularly against cisplatin resistance.",

However, the exposure of spermatozoa to ROS generated from internal or external sources may create a potentially detrimental redox imbalance. Antioxidant supplementation in semen is now a rather common approach to protect spermatozoa from oxidative stress (OS) during their handling and/or cryopreservation. Supplementation with pterostilbene, a potent antioxidant, protects spermatozoa from OS and ameliorates their post-thawing characteristics and viability. In the present study, we used freezing/thawing as a model of natural ROS overproduction and investigated the molecular mechanisms modulated by pterostilbene. Specifically, bovine frozen/thawed spermatozoa were incubated with 10 or 25 μM pterostilbene for 60 min. Results have shown that in a dose-independent manner, pterostilbene decreased lipid peroxidation and increased intracellular GSH levels. Moreover, pterostilbene ameliorated energy production, as ATP and AMP/ATP levels were restored, and increased autophagy levels through AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activation, which finally resulted in the inhibition of apoptotic cell death in bovine spermatozoa when exposed to OS. This study sheds light on spermatozoa redox state, the crosstalk between apoptotic and autophagic pathways, and its role in determining the beneficial or detrimental effect of ROS in spermatozoa."

The \"Cell Cycle Hypothesis\" suggests that the abnormal re-entry of neurons into the cell division cycle leads to neurodegeneration, a mechanism supported by in vitro studies on neuronal-like cells treated with the hyperphosphorylating agent forskolin. Pterostilbene, a bioavailable compound found in foods such as blueberries and grapes, may exert neuroprotective effects and could serve as a potential adjunct therapy for neurodegenerative diseases. Methods. In this study, we investigated the effects of pterostilbene on neuronal-like cells derived from the human neuroblastoma SK-N-BE cell line, where cell cycle reactivation was induced by forskolin treatment. We analyzed molecular endpoints associated with differentiated versus replicative cell states, specifically the following: (a) the expression of cyclin CCND1, (b) the Ki67 cell proliferation marker, (c) the AT8 nuclear tau epitope, and (d) genome-wide DNA methylation changes. Results. Our findings indicate that pterostilbene exerts distinct effects on the cell division cycle depending on the cellular state, with neuroprotective benefits observed in differentiated neuronal-like cells, but not in cells undergoing induced division. Additionally, pterostilbene alters DNA methylation patterns. Conclusion. These results suggest that pterostilbene may offer neuroprotective advantages for differentiated neuronal-like cells. However, further studies are required to confirm these effects in vivo by examining specific biomarkers in human populations consuming pterostilbene-containing foods.",

These conjugates were subsequently utilized in the antisolvent precipitation method to encapsulate pterostilbene (Pte). The structural and functional properties of these conjugates as carriers for intestinal-targeted Pte delivery were thoroughly evaluated. SDS-PAGE, total phenolic content measurement, grafting efficiency, and FT-IR analysis confirmed the successful formation of three distinct covalent conjugates. Among them, the laccase-induced WPI-TA conjugates exhibited the highest TA grafting efficiency. The particle size of this conjugate was measured at 115.25 nm with a PDI of 0.31. Upon encapsulation of Pte, this conjugate exhibited superior thermal stability, enhanced antioxidant properties, and sustained release within the gastrointestinal tract. The water solubility of Pte in these nanoparticles was found to be 361.19 times higher than that of free Pte, presenting a promising strategy for targeted intestinal delivery of Pte.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND/AIM: Head and neck cancer (HNC) is one of the most prevalent causes of death worldwide, and so discovering anticancer agents for its treatment is very important. Pterostilbene (PS) is a trans-stilbene reported to be beneficial in managing various cancers. The objective of the study was to evaluate the cytotoxic, antiproliferative, proapoptotic, and antimigrative effect of PS on HEp-2, SCC-90, SCC-9, FaDu, and Detroit-551 cell lines. MATERIALS AND METHODS: MTT and live/dead assays were employed to assess cell viability, while a cell migration test was performed to evaluate wound healing capacity. The mRNA, protein, and intracellular expression levels of CASP-3, BAX, and BCL-2 genes were evaluated by real-time PCR, western blotting, and immunofluorescence staining. Annexin V-PI staining was conducted to assess the amounts of viable, apoptotic, and necrotic cells. RESULTS: The results revealed that PS displayed cytotoxic, antiproliferative activity in a dose-dependent manner in HNC cells by upregulating CASP-3 and BCL-2 while downregulating BCL-2 in the apoptotic pathway. The proapoptotic properties were confirmed by the annexin-V-IP results. Moreover, PS displayed a significant suppressive efficacy on the migration capacity of HNC cells. CONCLUSION: The present study provides proof that PS has the prospective to be improved as an attractive anticancer agent against HNC following advanced studies."

      "abstract": "Retinal ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury is a critical pathogenic mechanism in various eye diseases, and an effective therapeutic strategy remains unresolved. Natural derivatives have recently reemerged; therefore, in our present study, we examined the potential therapeutic effects of a stilbenoid that is chemically related to resveratrol. Pterostilbene, recognized for its anti-inflammatory, anti-carcinogenic, anti-diabetic, and neuroprotective properties, counteracts oxidative stress during I/R injury through various mechanisms. This study explored pterostilbene as a retinoprotective agent. Male Sprague Dawley rats underwent retinal I/R injury and one-week reperfusion and were treated with either vehicle or pterostilbene. After this functional electroretinographical (ERG) measurement, Western blot and histological analyses were performed. Pterostilbene treatment significantly improved retinal function, as evidenced by increased b-wave amplitude on ERG. Histological studies showed reduced retinal thinning and preserved the retinal structure in the pterostilbene-treated groups. Moreover, Western blot analysis revealed a decreased expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and heat shock protein 70 (HSP70), indicating reduced glial activation and cellular stress. Additionally, the expression of pro-apoptotic and inflammatory markers, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1) and nuclear factor kappa B (NFκB) was significantly reduced in the pterostilbene-treated group. These findings suggest that pterostilbene offers protective effects on the retina by diminishing oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis, thus preserving retinal function and structure following I/R injury. This study underscores pterostilbene's potential as a neuroprotective therapeutic agent for treating retinal ischemic injury and related disorders."

      "abstract": "Pterostilbene (PTS), which is abundant in blueberries, is a dimethyl derivative of the natural polyphenol resveratrol (RES). Several plant species, including peanuts and grapes, also produce PTS. Although RES has a wide range of health benefits, including anti-cancer properties, PTS has a robust pharmacological profile that includes a better intestinal absorption and an increased hepatic stability compared to RES. Indeed, PTS has a higher bioavailability and a lower toxicity compared to other stilbenes, making it an attractive drug candidate for the treatment of various diseases, including diabetes, cancer, cardiovascular disease, neurodegenerative disorders, and aging. We previously reported that RES serves as a substrate for tyrosinase, producing an o-quinone metabolite that is highly cytotoxic to melanocytes. The present study investigated whether PTS may also be metabolized by tyrosinase, similarly to RES. PTS was oxidized as a substrate by tyrosinase to form an o-quinone, which reacted with thiols, such as N-acetyl-L-cysteine, to form di- and tri-adducts. We also confirmed that PTS was taken up and metabolized by human tyrosinase-expressing 293T cells in amounts several times greater than RES. In addition, PTS showed a tyrosinase-dependent cytotoxicity against B16BL6 melanoma cells that was stronger than RES and also inhibited the formation of melanin in B16BL6 melanoma cells and in the culture medium. These results suggest that the two methyl groups of PTS, which are lipophilic, increase its membrane permeability, making it easier to bind to intracellular proteins, and may therefore be more cytotoxic to melanin-producing cells.",

      "abstract": "Due to the fast-changing global climate, conventional agricultural systems have to deal with more unpredictable and harsh environmental conditions leading to compromise food production. The application of phytonanotechnology can ensure safer and more sustainable crop production, allowing the target-specific delivery of bioactive molecules with great and partially explored positive effects for agriculture, such as an increase in crop production and plant pathogen reduction. In this study, the effect of free pterostilbene (PTB) and poly(lactic-co-glycolic) acid (PLGA) nanoparticles (NPs) loaded with pterostilbene was investigated on Solanum lycopersicum L. metabolism. An untargeted NMR-based metabolomics approach was used to examine primary and secondary metabolism whereas a targeted HPLC-MS/MS-based approach was used to explore the impact on defense response subjected to anti-oxidant effect of PTB, such as free fatty acids, oxylipins and them impact on hormone biosynthesis, in particular salicylic and jasmonic acid. In tomato leaves after treatment with PTB and PLGA NPs loaded with PTB (NPs + PTB), both NPs + PTB and free PTB treatments increased GABA levels in tomato leaves. In addition, a decrease of quercetin-3-glucoside associated with the increase in caffeic acid was observed suggesting a shift in secondary metabolism towards the biosynthesis of phenylpropanoids and other phenolic compounds. An increase of behenic acid (C22:0) and a remodulation of oxylipin metabolism deriving from the linoleic acid (i.e. 9-HpODE, 13-HpODE and 9-oxo-ODE) and linolenic acid (9-HOTrE and 9-oxoOTrE) after treatment with PLGA NPs and PLGA NPs + PTB were also found as a part of mechanisms of plant redox modulation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study showing the role of PLGA nanoparticles loaded with pterostilbene in modulating leaf metabolome and physiology in terms of secondary metabolites, fatty acids, oxylipins and hormones. In perspective, PLGA NPs loaded with PTB could be used to reshape the metabolic profile to allow plant to react more quickly to stresses.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Stroke is a type of acute brain damage that can lead to a series of serious public health challenges. Demonstrating the molecular mechanism of stroke-related neural cell degeneration could help identify a more efficient treatment for stroke patients. Further elucidation of factors that regulate microglia and nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 1 (Nrf1) may lead to a promising strategy for treating neuroinflammation after ischaemic stroke. In this study, we investigated the possible role of pterostilbene (PTS) in Nrf1 regulation in cell and animal models of ischaemia stroke. METHODS: We administered PTS, ITSA1 (an HDAC activator) and RGFP966 (a selective HDAC3 inhibitor) in a mouse model of middle cerebral artery occlusion-reperfusion (MCAO/R) and a model of microglial oxygen‒glucose deprivation/reperfusion (OGD/R). The brain infarct size, neuroinflammation and microglial availability were also determined. Dual-luciferase reporter, Nrf1 protein stability and co-immunoprecipitation assays were conducted to analyse histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3)/Nrf1-regulated Nrf1 in an OGD/R-induced microglial injury model. RESULTS: We found that PTS decreased HDAC3 expression and activity, increased Nrf1 acetylation in the cell nucleus and inhibited the interaction of Nrf1 with p65 and p65 accumulation, which reduced infarct volume and neuroinflammation (iNOS/Arg1, TNF-α and IL-1β levels) after ischaemic stroke. Furthermore, the CSF1R inhibitor PLX5622 induced elimination of microglia and attenuated the therapeutic effect of PTS following MCAO/R. In the OGD/R model, PTS relieved OGD/R-induced microglial injury and TNF-α and IL-1β release, which were dependent on Nrf1 acetylation through the upregulation of HDAC3/Nrf1 signalling in microglia. However, the K105R or/and K139R mutants of Nrf1 counteracted the impact of PTS in the OGD/R-induced microglial injury model, which indicates that PTS treatment might be a promising strategy for ischaemia stroke therapy. CONCLUSION: The HDAC3/Nrf1 pathway regulates the stability and function of Nrf1 in microglial activation and neuroinflammation, which may depend on the acetylation of the lysine 105 and 139 residues in Nrf1. This mechanism was first identified as a potential regulatory mechanism of PTS-based neuroprotection in our research, which may provide new insight into further translational applications of natural products such as PTS.",

Pterostilbene (PTE) influences neural cell survival in in the pathology of a number of neurological diseases, but the mechanisms underlying this influence at present are not clear. The objective of the present study was to examine the potential impact of PTE on mitigating oxidative stress and neuronal apoptosis following ICH, while also elucidating the potential underlying pathways. MATERIAL & METHOD: For in vivo experimentation, male C57BL/6 mice were used to establish ICH models. Wet-to-dry weight ratios were utilized to assess the degree of cerebral edema in the context of PTE intervention. Behavioral experiments were conducted to evaluate neurological dysfunction and cognitive impairment, and hematoxylin and eosin staining was employed to observe histopathological changes in the brain. Furthermore, oxidative stress levels in hippocampal tissues were measured, and cell apoptosis was examined using TUNEL staining and western blotting techniques. In vitro experiments were conducted to evaluate the extent of oxidative stress and neural apoptosis after sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) siRNA treatment. Immunofluorescence cytochemistry was used to analyze the immunofluorescence colocalization of SIRT1 and NeuN. RESULT: Mice that experienced ICH exhibited worsening neurological deterioration, increased oxidative stress and neuronal cell apoptosis. However, the addition of PTE was found to lessen these effects. Furthermore, PTE was found to activate the SIRT1-mediated Nrf2 pathway in mice with ICH. When SIRT1 was inhibited, levels of oxidative stress and neuronal apoptosis increased, even in the presence of PTE. CONCLUSION: The present study provided evidence to indicate that PTE can suppress oxidative damage and neuronal apoptosis following ICH by activating the SIRT1/Nrf2 pathway.",

Recent research has drawn attention to its association with cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk, yet the exact mechanism remains elusive. This study aimed to explore the potential role of PCOS-associated insulin resistance (IR) and inflammation in linking PCOS to AD pathogenesis. It additionally investigated the therapeutic merits of pterostilbene (PTS) in ameliorating PCOS and associated cognitive deficits in comparison to metformin (MET). Rats were divided into five groups; vehicle group, PTS group [30 mg/kg, per os (p.o.) for 13 days], and the remaining three groups received letrozole (1 mg/kg, p.o. for 21 days) to represent the PCOS, PCOS + MET (300 mg/kg, p.o. for 13 days), and PCOS + PTS groups, respectively. Behavioral tests were conducted, along with a histopathological investigation of brains and ovaries. Assessment of serum hormonal profile and hippocampal IRS-1/PI3K/AKT/GSK-3β insulin signaling pathway components were performed. PTS rats exhibited improved insulin sensitivity and hormonal profile, besides enhanced neurobehavioral tests performance and histopathological findings. These effects may be attributed to modulation of the IRS-1/PI3K/AKT/GSK-3β pathway, reducing GSK-3β activity, and mitigating Tau hyperphosphorylation and Aβ accumulation in the brain. Likewise, PTS attenuated nuclear factor kappa B-mediated inflammation and reversed AChE elevation, suggesting multifaceted neuroprotective effects. Comparatively, PTS showed outcomes similar to those of MET in most parameters. The obtained findings validated that dysregulated insulin signaling in PCOS rats detrimentally affects cognitive function, which is halted by PTS, unveiling the potential of PTS as a novel therapy for PCOS and related cognitive deficits.",

This study aimed to identify potential LUSC biomarkers through a series of bioinformatic analyses and clinical verification and explored the interaction between PT and selected biomarkers during the treatment of LUSC. The analysis of the expression profile of the clinical samples of LUSC was performed to identify dysexpressed genes (DEGs) and validated by IHC. The role of KANK3 in the anti-LUSC effects of PT was assessed with a series of in vitro and in vivo assays. 4335 DEGs were identified, including 1851 upregulated genes and 2484 downregulated genes. Survival analysis showed that KANK3 was significantly higher in patients with LUSC with an advanced tumor stage. In in vitro assays, PT suppressed cell viability, induced apoptosis, and inhibited migration and invasion in LUSC cell lines, which was associated with downregulation of KANK3. After the reinduction of the KANK3 level in LUSC cells, the anti-LUSC function of PT was impaired. In mice model, reinduction of KANK3 increased tumor growth and metastasis even under the treatment of PT. The findings outlined in the current study indicated that PT exerted anti-LUSC function in a KANK3 inhibition-dependent manner.",

      "abstract": "This experiment was carried out to investigate the effect of pterostilbene (PTE) supplementation in feed on Arbor Acres broilers in terms of serum biochemical parameters, immune and inflammatory responses, antioxidant status, and intestinal morphological structure. For a duration of 42 days, a total of 480 1-day-old Arbor Acres broilers were randomly divided into four groups. Each group was assigned to receive either the basal diet or the basal diet supplemented with 200, 400, or 600 mg/kg of PTE. Each treatment consisted of eight replicates, with 15 chicks per replicate. In comparison with the control group, three PTE treatments significantly increased the lymphocyte transformation rate in the spleen of broilers. The automated biochemical analysis, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and RT-qPCR analysis kits found that 400 mg/kg of PTE significantly increased the serum levels of complement C3, IL-4, and iNOS; reduced the serum levels of IL-6, TNF-α, and mRNA levels of the genes IL-6, IL-8, TNF-α, NLRP3, and IFN-γ; significantly improved the activities of antioxidant enzymes including CAT, GSH-Px, and T-SOD in the jejunum; and significantly reduced the MDA contents in the serum and jejunum of broilers. Nikon microscope observations and ImagePro Plus 6.0 measure results found that 400 mg/kg of PTE supplementation significantly reduced the relative length and weight of the jejunum and improved the jejunal villi structure, resulting in increased intestinal villi, deepened crypt, and an enhanced ratio of villi height to crypt depth (VH/CD). RT-qPCR and Western blot found that dietary PTE also resulted in increased mRNA levels of the genes Claudin-2, Occludin, ZO-1, and Sirt1, and decreased NF-κB protein levels in the jejunum. The results of this study demonstrated that dietary PTE improved the immune function and intestinal health of broilers by reducing inflammation and increasing the antioxidant capacity of the animals."

      "abstract": "Hepatic lipid metabolism is modulated by the circadian rhythm; therefore, circadian disruption may promote obesity and hepatic lipid accumulation. This study aims to investigate dietary pterostilbene (PSB) 's protective effect against high-fat-diet (HFD)-induced lipid accumulation exacerbated by chronic jet lag and the potential role of gut microbiota therein. Mice were treated with a HFD and chronic jet lag for 14 weeks. The experimental group was supplemented with 0.25% (w/w) PSB in its diet to evaluate whether PSB had a beneficial effect. Our study found that chronic jet lag exacerbates HFD-induced obesity and hepatic lipid accumulation, but these adverse effects were significantly mitigated by PSB supplementation. Specifically, PSB promoted hepatic lipolysis and β-oxidation by upregulating SIRT1 expression, which indirectly reduced oxidative stress caused by lipid accumulation. Additionally, the PSB-induced elevation of SIRT1 and SIRT3 expression helped prevent excessive autophagy and mitochondrial fission by activating Nrf2-mediated antioxidant enzymes. The result was evidenced by the use of SIRT1 and SIRT3 inhibitors in in vitro studies, which demonstrated that activation of SIRT1 and SIRT3 by PSB is crucial for the translocation of PGC-1α and Nrf2, respectively. Moreover, the analysis of gut microbiota suggested that PSB's beneficial effects were partly due to its positive modulation of gut microbial composition and functionality. The findings of this study suggest the potential of dietary PSB as a candidate to improve hepatic lipid metabolism via several mechanisms. It may be developed as a treatment adjuvant in the future.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a life-threatening aortic disease, and to date, there are currently no effective pharmacological treatments to address this condition. Activation of cytosolic DNA sensing adaptor stimulator of interferon genes (STING) signaling is a crucial mechanism in AAA formation. PURPOSE: This study investigated pterostilbene (Pt), a naturally occurring polyphenol and resveratrol analogue, as a STING inhibitor for preventing AAA. METHODS: We evaluated the effect of Pt on AAA formation in angiotensin II (AngII)-infused apolipoprotein E-deficient (ApoE-/-) mice. We used histological analysis, MMP activity measurement, western blot, and immunohistochemistry to detect AAA formation and development. We applied RNA sequencing, molecular docking, cellular thermal shift assay (CETSA) and functional studies to dissect the molecular mechanism of Pt-regulating KEAP1-Nrf2-STING signaling. We conditionally knocked down Nrf2 in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) in vivo to investigate its role in Pt-mediated protective effects on AAA. RESULTS: Pt effectively blocked the formation of AAA in AngII-infused ApoE-/- mice. Whole transcriptome sequencing analysis revealed that nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and STING pathway in VSMCs were linked to the anti-AAA effects of pterostilbene. Mechanistically, Pt upregulated Nrf2 target genes (e.g., HO-1 and NQO1) through activation of the KEAP1/Nrf2 signaling, which restricted the immunostimulatory axis of mtDNA-STING-TBK1-NF-κB, thereby alleviating VSMC inflammation and preserving the VSMC contractile phenotype. Subsequently, molecular docking and CETSA revealed a binding mode between Pt and KEAP1/Nrf2. Intriguingly, the inhibitory effect of Pt on STING signaling and the protective role of Pt in AAA were largely abrogated by VSMC-specific Nrf2 knockdown in mice. CONCLUSION: Collectively, naturally derived Pt shows promising efficacy for the treatment of AAA by targeting the KEAP1-Nrf2-STING axis in VSMCs.",

      "abstract": "Pterostilbene (PTE), a natural phenolic compound, has exhibited promising anticancer properties in the preclinical treatment of cervical cancer (CC). This study aims to comprehensively investigate the potential targets and mechanisms underlying PTE's anticancer effects in CC, thereby providing a theoretical foundation for its future clinical application and development. To accomplish this, we employed a range of methodologies, including network pharmacology, bioinformatics, and computer simulation, with specific techniques such as WGCNA, PPI network construction, ROC curve analysis, KM survival analysis, GO functional enrichment, KEGG pathway enrichment, molecular docking, MDS, and single-gene GSEA. Utilizing eight drug target prediction databases, we have identified a total of 532 potential targets for PTE. By combining CC-related genes from the GeneCards disease database with significant genes derived from WGCNA analysis of the GSE63514 dataset, we obtained 7915 unique CC-related genes. By analyzing the intersection of the 7915 CC-related genes and the 2810 genes that impact overall survival time in CC, we identified 690 genes as crucial for CC. Through the use of a Venn diagram, we discovered 36 overlapping targets shared by PTE and CC. We have constructed a PPI network and identified 9 core candidate targets. ROC and KM curve analyses subsequently revealed IL1B, EGFR, IL1A, JUN, MYC, MMP1, MMP3, and ANXA5 as the key targets modulated by PTE in CC. GO and KEGG pathway enrichment analyses indicated significant enrichment of these key targets, primarily in the MAPK and IL-17 signaling pathways. Molecular docking analysis verified the effective binding of PTE to all nine key targets. MDS results showed that the protein-ligand complex between MMP1 and PTE was the most stable among the nine targets. Additionally, GSEA enrichment analysis suggested a potential link between elevated MMP1 expression and the activation of the IL-17 signaling pathway. In conclusion, our study has identified key targets and uncovered the molecular mechanism behind PTE's anticancer activity in CC, establishing a firm theoretical basis for further exploration of PTE's pharmacological effects in CC therapy.",

Objective Using computational techniques like molecular docking and absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) studies, this research focuses on examining the pharmacokinetics and molecular interactions of PTS with proteins such as vimentin (Vim), glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3-β), epithelial cadherin (E-cadherin), interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and Wnt, all of which are connected to the Wnt signaling pathway in liver cancer. Methods The study includes the synthesis of proteins and ligands, ADME investigations for PTS, and AutoDock Vina molecular docking simulations to evaluate binding affinities and interactions. PTS is obtained from PubChem, while protein structures are obtained from the Protein Data Bank. Results Strong binding affinities between PTS and essential proteins in the Wnt signaling cascade are shown by molecular docking, which also highlights noteworthy hydrogen bonds, hydrophobic interactions, and electrostatic contacts. According to an ADME study, PTS has advantageous pharmacokinetic properties, such as moderate solubility, membrane permeability, and a minimal chance of drug interactions. Conclusion The extensive study highlights PTS's potential as a viable treatment option for liver cancer. The study promotes its investigation in cutting-edge liver cancer therapy approaches and urges more investigation into the molecular mechanisms, underpinning its anticancer properties. This paper sheds important light on the role of natural chemicals in cancer therapy and emphasizes the need for computational methods in drug discovery."

In this study, we evaluated pterostilbene (PT), a natural anti-inflammatory substance, for its protective effects and safety during prolonged use on OA. Results showed that PT alleviated the loss of chondrocytes and widened the narrow joint space in an octacalcium phosphate (OCP)-induced OA mouse model (n = 3). In vitro experiments demonstrate that PT reduced NLRP3 inflammation activation (relative protein expression: C: 1 ± 0.09, lipopolysaccharide (LPS): 1.14 ± 0.07, PT: 0.91 ± 0.07, LPS + PT: 0.68 ± 0.04) and the release of inflammatory cytokines through NF-κB signaling inactivation (relative protein expression: C: 1 ± 0.03, LPS: 3.49 ± 0.02, PT: 0.66 ± 0.08, LPS + PT: 2.78 ± 0.05), ultimately preventing cartilage catabolism. Interestingly, PT also altered gut microbiota by reducing inflammation-associated flora and increasing the abundance of healthy bacteria in OA groups. Collectively, these results suggest that the PT can be considered as a protective strategy for OA."

In both conditions, oxidative stress is associated with a worse prognosis. Pterostilbene (PTE), an antioxidant compound, has been studied as a possible therapy for cardiovascular diseases. This study aims to evaluate the effect of PTE on oxidative stress in the hearts of animals with MI and in the lungs of animals with PAH. Male Wistar rats were used in both models. In the MI model, the experimental groups were sham, MI, and MI + PTE. In the PAH model, the experimental groups were control, PAH, and PAH + PTE. Animals were exposed to MI through surgical ligation of the left coronary artery, or to PAH, by the administration of monocrotaline (60 mg/kg). Seven days after undergoing cardiac injury, the MI + PTE animals were treated with PTE (100 mg/kg day) for 8 days. After this, the heart was collected for molecular analysis. The PAH + PTE animals were treated with PTE (100 mg/kg day) for 14 days, beginning 7 days after PAH induction. After this, the lungs were collected for biochemical evaluation. We found that PTE administration attenuated the decrease in ejection fraction and improved left ventricle end-systolic volume in infarcted animals. In the PAH model, PTE improved pulmonary artery flow and decreased reactive oxygen species levels in the lung. PTE administration promoted protective effects in terms of oxidative stress in 2 experimental models of cardiac diseases: MI and PAH. PTE also improved cardiac function in infarcted rats and pulmonary artery flow in animals with PAH.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Gastric cancer (GC) represents a significant health burden with dire prognostic implications upon metastasis and recurrence. Pterostilbene (PTE) has been proven to have a strong ability to inhibit proliferation and metastasis in other cancers, while whether PTE exhibits anti-GC activity and its potential mechanism remain unclear. PURPOSE: To explore the efficacy and potential mechanism of PTE in treating GC. METHODS: We employed a comprehensive set of assays, including CCK-8, EdU staining, colony formation, flow cytometry, cell migration, and invasion assays, to detect the effect of PTE on the biological function of GC cells in vitro. The xenograft tumor model was established to evaluate the in vivo anti-GC activity of PTE. Network pharmacology was employed to predict PTE's potential targets and pathways within GC. Subsequently, Western blotting, immunofluorescence, and immunohistochemistry were utilized to analyze protein levels related to the cell cycle, EMT, and the JAK2/STAT3 pathway. RESULTS: Our study demonstrated strong inhibitory effects of PTE on GC cells both in vitro and in vivo. In vitro, PTE significantly induced cell cycle arrest at G0/G1 and S phases and suppressed proliferation, migration, and invasion of GC cells. In vivo, PTE led to a dose-dependent reduction in tumor volume and weight. Importantly, PTE exhibited notable safety, leaving mouse weight, liver function, and kidney function unaffected. The involvement of the JAK2/STAT3 pathway in PTE's anti-GC effect was predicted utilizing network pharmacology. PTE suppressed JAK2 kinase activity by binding to the JH1 kinase structural domain and inhibited the downstream STAT3 signaling pathway. Western blotting confirmed PTE's inhibition of the JAK2/STAT3 pathway and EMT-associated protein levels. The anti-GC effect was partially reversed upon STAT3 activation, validating the pivotal role of the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway in PTE's activity. CONCLUSION: Our investigation validates the potent inhibitory effects of PTE on the proliferation and metastasis of GC cells. Importantly, we present novel evidence implicating the JAK2/STAT3 pathway as the key mechanism through which PTE exerts its anti-GC activity. These findings not only establish the basis for considering PTE as a promising lead compound for GC therapeutics but also contribute significantly to our comprehension of the intricate molecular mechanisms underlying its exceptional anti-cancer properties.",

Further results from the Western blot and quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction indicated that the enhanced efficacy of pterostilbene nanoemulsion may be attributed to its stronger promotion of the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 signaling pathway. Hence, enhanced drug delivery efficiency decreased dosage requirements and increased the bioavailability of pterostilbene, thereby potentially providing a safe, effective, and convenient treatment option for patients with Alzheimer's disease.",

      "abstract": "Patients with cancer die from cardiac dysfunction second only to the disease itself. Cardiotoxicity caused by anticancer drugs has been emphasized as a possible cause; however, the details remain unclear. To investigate this mechanism, we treated rat cardiomyoblast H9c2 cells with sunitinib, lapatinib, 5-fluorouracil, and cisplatin to examine their effects. All anticancer drugs increased ROS, lipid peroxide, and iron (II) levels in the mitochondria and decreased glutathione peroxidase-4 levels and the GSH/GSSG ratio. Against this background, mitochondrial iron (II) accumulates through the unregulated expression of haem oxygenase-1 and ferrochelatase. Anticancer-drug-induced cell death was suppressed by N-acetylcysteine, deferoxamine, and ferrostatin, indicating ferroptosis. Anticancer drug treatment impairs mitochondrial DNA and inhibits oxidative phosphorylation in H9c2 cells. Similar results were observed in the hearts of cancer-free rats treated with anticancer drugs in vitro. In contrast, treatment with pterostilbene inhibited the induction of ferroptosis and rescued the energy restriction induced by anticancer drugs both in vitro and in vivo. These findings suggest that induction of ferroptosis and inhibition of oxidative phosphorylation are mechanisms by which anticancer drugs cause myocardial damage. As pterostilbene ameliorates these mechanisms, it is expected to have significant clinical applications.",

Combination treatment of phloretin and pterostilbene (PP) has been previously shown to effectively inhibit the conidial germination and mycelial growth of C. gloeosporioides in vitro. In this study, the effects of PP treatment on the growth of C. gloeosporioides in vivo and the biocontrol mechanisms were investigated. We found that exogenous PP treatment could limit the growth of C. gloeosporioides and alleviate the damage of anthracnose in stylo. Comparative transcriptome analysis revealed that 565 genes were up-regulated and 239 genes were down-regulated upon PP treatment during the infection by C. gloeosporioides. The differentially expressed genes were mainly related to oxidative stress and chloroplast organization. Further physiological analysis revealed that application of PP after C. gloeosporioides inoculation significantly reduced the accumulation of O2•- level and increased the accumulation of antioxidants (glutathione, ascorbic acid and flavonoids) as well as the enzyme activity of total antioxidant capacity, superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione reductase, peroxidase and ascorbate peroxidase. PP also reduced the decline of chlorophyll a + b and increased the content of carotenoid in response to C. gloeosporioides infection. These results suggest that PP treatment alleviates anthracnose by improving antioxidant capacity and reducing the damage of chloroplasts, providing insights into the biocontrol mechanisms of PP on the stylo against anthracnose.",

      "abstract": "Anticancer agents are playing an increasing role in the treatment of gastric cancer (GC); however, novel anticancer agents have not been fully developed. Therefore, it is important to investigate compounds that improve sensitivity to the existing anticancer drugs. We have reported that pterostilbene (PTE), a plant stilbene, enhances the antitumor effect of low doses of sunitinib in gastric cancer cells accumulating mitochondrial iron (II) (mtFe) at low doses. In this study, we investigated the relationship between the mtFe deposition and the synergistic effect of PTE and different anticancer drugs. For this study, we used 5-fluorouracil (5FU), cisplatin (CPPD), and lapatinib (LAP), which are frequently used in the treatment of GC, and doxorubicin (DOX), which is known to deposit mtFe. A combination of low-dose PTE and these drugs suppressed the expression of PDZ domain-containing 8 (PDZD8) and increased mtFe accumulation and mitochondrial H2O2. Consequently, reactive oxygen species-associated hypoxia inducible factor-1α activation induced endoplasmic reticulum stress and led to apoptosis, but not ferroptosis. In contrast, 5FU and CDDP did not show the same changes as those observed with PTE and DOX or LAP, and there was no synergistic effect with PTE. These results indicate that the combination of PTE with iron-accumulating anticancer drugs exhibits a strong synergistic effect. These findings would help in developing novel therapeutic strategies for GC. However, further clinical investigations are required.",

      "abstract": "Fibrosis is a prevailing pathology in chronic diseases and accounts for 45% of deaths in developed countries. This condition is primarily identified by the transformation of fibroblasts into myofibroblasts and the overproduction of extracellular matrix (ECM) by myofibroblasts. Pterostilbene (PTS) is a natural analogue of resveratrol and is most commonly found in blueberries. Research has shown that PTS exerts a wide range of pharmacological effects, such as antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anticancer effects. As a result, PTS has the potential to prevent and cure numerous diseases. Emerging evidence has indicated that PTS can alleviate myocardial fibrosis, renal fibrosis, pulmonary fibrosis, hepatic fibrosis, and colon fibrosis via the inhibition of inflammation, oxidative stress, and fibrogenesis effects in vivo and in vitro, and the potential mechanisms are linked to various pathways, including transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1)/small mother against decapentaplegic proteins (Smads) signalling, the reactive oxygen species (ROS)-driven Pitx2c/mir-15b pathway, nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) signalling, Kelch-like epichlorohydrin-associated protein-1 (Keap-1)/NF-E2-related factor-2 (Nrf2) cascade, the NLR family pyridine structure domain 3 (NLRP3) pathway, the Janus kinase-2 (JAK2)/signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) pathway, and the Src/STAT3 pathway. In this review, we comprehensively summarize the antifibrotic effects of PTS both in vivo and in vitro and the pharmacological mechanisms, pharmacokinetics, and toxicology of PTS and provide insights into and strategies for exploring promising agents for the treatment of fibrosis.",

One natural molecule that shows potential in cancer therapy is pterostilbene, especially for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The molecular details of pterostilbene's interactions with liver cancer are uncovered in this study using an in silico method. Methodology This study determines the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in HCC and the way pterostilbene affects them using data from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) datasets. To identify the intricate linkages and possible treatment targets, network pharmacology, protein-protein interaction (PPI) analysis, and pathway enrichment investigations were performed. Results The study revealed complex relationships between pterostilbene and liver cancer, identified important DEGs in HCC, and showed enriched pathways. Pterostilbene shows promise as a target for therapeutic approaches in HCC due to its modulation of important signaling pathways. Conclusions This work offers an extensive knowledge of pterostilbene's potential in liver cancer, despite intrinsic computational limitations. In addition to the importance of experimental validation, the pathways and DEGs that have been found provide insightful information for future investigation, highlighting the ongoing research that is necessary to create targeted therapeutics for HCC."

The results showed that PTE treatment improved the cell morphology and viability, and inhibited the apoptosis rate and ROS levels in H2 O2 -injured HL-1 cells. Particularly, PTE treatment upregulated the levels of GAS6, Axl, and markers related to oxidative stress, apoptosis, and mitochondrial function related.

      "abstract": "Dry eye disease is a multifactorial dysfunction of the tear film and ocular surface, with etiology involving inflammation and oxidative stress on the ocular surface. Pterostilbene (PS) is a secondary metabolite extracted from plants, which possesses remarkable anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects. However, its application is limited by light instability and very poor water solubility. We modified fat-soluble PS into a biparental pterostilbene-glutaric anhydride-arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (PS-GA-RGD) nanomedicine by prodrug ligation of functional peptides. The aim of this study was to explore the protective effect and potential mechanism of PS-GA-RGD on dry eye disease in vitro and in vivo. We demonstrated good long-term biocompatibility of PS-GA-RGD through rabbit eye stimulation test. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was used to induce murine macrophages RAW 264.7 to establish an inflammation and oxidative stress model. In this model, PS-GA-RGD effectively reduced the production of ROS and 8-OHdG, enhancing the expression of antioxidant factor Nrf2 and antioxidant enzyme heme oxygenase-1. In addition, the expression of NF-κB inflammatory pathway significantly increased in LPS-induced RAW 264.7 cells, while PS-GA-RGD could significantly reduce this pathway. Hypertonic saline was utilized to establish a hypertonic model of human corneal epithelial cells. PS-GA-RGD was found to significantly reduce the production of ROS and NLRP3 inflammasomes in this model, exhibiting superior efficacy compared to PS. Experimental dry eye animal models were co-induced with subcutaneous injection of scopolamine and an intelligently controlled environmental system. We demonstrated that PS-GA-RGD nano drugs can prevent and reduce corneal epithelial cell defects and apoptosis, protect conjunctival goblet cells, and have an excellent anti-inflammatory effect. Finally, we demonstrated that RGD sequence in PS-GA-RGD can enhance cellular uptake, corneal retention, and penetration, thereby increasing their bioavailability and efficacy by a cell uptake assay and rabbit corneal drug retention experiment. Overall, this study highlights the potential of PS-GA-RGD nanomedicines in the treatment of dry eyes.",

Uncontrolled eating leads to the development of childhood obesity, poor self-esteem and depression due to its effects on brain development. Herbal supplements are novel inclusion in the management of obesity and mental well-being. Pterostilbene (PTE) found in blueberries and Pterocarpus marsupium heartwood, is known to prevent obesity in invivo models. Adolescent Swiss albino male mice were fed on CD for 70 days and the development of obesity was assessed by gain in body weight, abdominal circumference. Forced swim and tail suspension test confirmed depression in CD fed mice. Obesity induced depressed (OID) mice were treated with PTE (10, 20, 40 mg/kg), standard antiobesity drug cetilistat (10 mg/kg), antidepressant fluoxetine (10 mg/kg) for 28 days. Post treatment, PTE-treated mice showed reduction in BW and depression-like behavior analysed using paradigms such as sucrose preference, open field, marble burying, and resident intruder test in comparison to the CD group. Insulin resistance, lipid profile, antioxidant enzyme, inflammatory cytokines (NF-κB, IL-6, TNF α) and cortisol levels were mitigated by PTE. It also restored normal cellular architecture of the brain and adipose tissue and increased the Silent mating type information regulation 2 homolog1 (SIRT1), leptin and ghrelin receptors gene expression in the brain. Thus, it can be concluded that PTE might have inhibited OID like behavior in mice via inhibition of IR, modulating neuroinflammation and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis dysfunction and upregulating SIRT1 mediated leptin-ghrelin signaling.",

      "abstract": "Sunitinib (SUN) is the first-line targeted therapeutic drug for advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC). However, SUN resistance is frequently observed to result in tumor metastasis, with a poor survival rate. Therefore, finding an effective and safe adjuvant to reduce drug resistance is important for RCC treatment. Pterostilbene (PTE) and 6-shogaol (6-S) are natural phytochemicals found in edible sources and have potential applications against various cancers. However, the biological mechanisms of PTE and 6-S in SUN-resistant RCC are still unclear. Accordingly, this study investigated the regulatory effects of PTE and 6-S on cell survival, drug resistance, and cell invasion in 786-O and SUN-resistant 786-O (786-O SUNR) cells, respectively. The results demonstrated that PTE and 6-S induced apoptosis in both cell lines by upregulating the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio. Additionally, PTE and 6-S increased SUN sensitivity by inhibiting the expression of the RLIP76 transport protein, reduced cell invasion and downregulated MMP expression in both 786-O and 786-O SUNR cells. Mechanistically, PTE, and 6-S significantly and dose-dependently suppressed the RLIP76-initiated Ras/ERK and Akt/mTOR pathways. In summary, PTE and 6-S induce apoptosis, enhance SUN sensitivity, and inhibit migration in both 786-O and 786-O SUNR cells. These novel findings demonstrate the potential of PTE and 6-S as target therapeutic adjuvants for RCC treatment.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Considerable researches have directed toward metabolic disorders caused by sleep restriction (SR). SR-induced disruption of circadian metabolic rhythmicity is identified as an important pathophysiological mechanism. The flavonoid pterostilbene (PTE) is abundant in the traditional Chinese medicine dragon's blood with protective efficacy against obesity-related metabolic dysfunctions. Our previous study found that PTE ameliorates exercise intolerance and clock gene oscillation in the skeletal muscles subjected to SR. PURPOSE: This study aimed to explore whether PTE improves SR-induced metabolic disorders and delineate the relationship between PTE and the circadian clock. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Two hundred male C57/B6J mice were kept awake for 20 h/d over five consecutive days and concurrently gavaged with 50, 100, or 200 mg/kg·bw/d PTE. Food consumption and body weight were monitored, and the metabolic status of the mice was evaluated by performing OGTT and ITT, measuring the serum lipid profiles and liver histopathology in response to SR. Daily behavior was analyzed by Clocklab™. The circadian rhythms of the liver clock genes and metabolic output genes were evaluated by cosine analysis. Binding between PTE and RORα/γ or NR1D1/2 was investigated by molecular docking. A luciferase reporter assay was used to determine the impact of PTE on Bmal1 transcription in SR-exposed mice co-transfected with Ad-BMAL1-LUC plus Ad-RORγ-mCherry or Ad-NR1D1-EGFP. RESULTS: PTE significantly ameliorated abnormal glucose and lipid metabolism (p < 0.05) in SR-exposed mice. PTE improved circadian behavior (p < 0.05) and rescued the circadian rhythm oscillation of the liver clock (p < 0.05) and metabolic output genes (p < 0.05) under SR condition. Molecular docking disclosed that PTE might interact with RORs, and PTE was found to increase Bmal1 promoter luciferase activity with RORE elements in the presence of Ad-RORγ-mCherry (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: PTE may protect against SR-induced metabolic disorders by directly modulating RORγ to maintain circadian metabolic rhythm. The findings provide valuable insights into the potential use of PTE in the treatment of metabolic disorders associated with disruptions in the circadian rhythm.",

This comprehensive review elucidates the pharmacological properties, mechanisms of action, and therapeutic potential of PTS. Various studies indicate that PTS exhibits anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and antitumour properties, potentially making it a promising candidate for clinical applications. Its influence on regulatory pathways like NF-κB and PI3K/Akt underscores its diverse strategies in addressing diseases. Additionally, PTS showcases a favorable pharmacokinetic profile with better oral bioavailability compared to other stilbenoids, thus enhancing its therapeutic potential. Given these findings, there is an increased interest in incorporating PTS into treatment regimens for inflammatory and cancer-related conditions. However, more extensive clinical trials are imperative to establish its safety and efficacy in diverse patient populations."

DCZ0825 is a small molecule compound derived from pterostilbene with direct anti-myeloma activity and indirect immune-killing effects though reversal of the immunosuppression. DCZ0825 inhibits the activity and proliferation of MM cells causing no significant toxicity to normal cells. Using flow cytometry, this study found that DCZ0825 induced caspase-dependent apoptosis in MM cells and arrested the cell cycle in the G2/M phase by down-regulating CyclinB1, CDK1 and CDC25. Moreover, DCZ0825 up-regulated IRF3 and IRF7 to increase IFN-γ, promoting M2 macrophages to transform into M1 macrophages, releasing the immunosuppression of CD4T cells and stimulated M1 macrophages and Th1 cells to secrete more INF-γ to form immune killing effect on MM cells. Treatment with DCZ0825 resulted in an increased proportion of positive regulatory cells such as CD4T, memory T cells, CD8T, and NK cells, with downregulation of the proportion of negative regulatory cells such as Treg cells and MDSCs. In conclusion, DCZ0825 is a novel compound with both antitumor and immunomodulatory activity.",

      "abstract": "Osteosarcoma, a highly metastasizing bone neoplasm, is a leading cause of death and disability in children and adolescents worldwide. Osteosarcoma is only suboptimally responsive to surgery and radio- and chemotherapy, that too with adverse side effects. Hence, there is a necessary need for safer alternative therapeutic approaches. This study evaluated the anticancer effects of the semi-synthetic compound, pterostilbene-isothiocyanate (PTER-ITC), on human osteosarcoma MG-63 cells through cytotoxicity, wound-healing, and transwell-migration assays. Results showed that PTER-ITC specifically inhibited the survival, proliferation, and migration of osteosarcoma cells. PTER-ITC induced apoptosis in MG-63 cells by disrupting mitochondrial membrane potential, as evident from the outcomes of different cytological staining. The antimetastatic potential of PTER-ITC was evaluated through immunostaining, RT-qPCR, and immunoblotting. In silico (molecular docking and dynamic simulation) and, subsequently, biochemical [co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) and luciferase reporter] assays deciphered the underlying mode-of-action of this compound. PTER-ITC increased E-cadherin and reduced N-cadherin levels, thereby facilitating the reversal of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). It also modulated the expressions of proliferative cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), caspase-3, poly [ADP-ribose] polymerase (PARP-1) and matrix metalloproteinase-2/9 (MMPs-2/9) at transcriptional and translational levels. PTER-ITC interfered with the β-catenin/transcription factor-4 (TCF-4) interaction in silico by occupying the β-catenin binding site on TCF-4, confirmed by their reduced physical interactions (Co-IP assay). This inhibited transcriptional activation of TCF-4 by β-catenin (as shown by luciferase reporter assay). In conclusion, PTER-ITC exhibited potent anticancer effects in vitro against human osteosarcoma cells by abrogating the β-catenin/TCF-4 interaction. Altogether, this study suggests that PTER-ITC may be regarded as a new approach for osteosarcoma treatment."

This study aimed to examine the potential of (E)-1-(5-(2-(4-fluorobenzyloxy)Styryl)-4,6-dimethoxyphenyl)-3-methyl-4,5-dihydro-1H-pyrazole-1-yl) ethyl ketone (Ptd-1) to alleviate vascular calcification. ApoE-deficient mice were fed a high-fat diet for 12/16 weeks to induce intimal calcification, and wild-type mice were induced with a combination of nicotine and vitamin D3 to induce medial calcification. Human aortic smooth muscle cells (HASMCs) and aortic osteogenic differentiation were induced in vitro with phosphate. In the mouse model of atherosclerosis, Ptd-1 significantly ameliorated the progression of atherosclerosis and intimal calcification, and there were significant reductions in lipid deposition and calcium salt deposition in the aorta and aortic root. In addition, Ptd-1 significantly improved medial calcification in vivo and osteogenic differentiation in vitro. Mechanistically, Ptd-1 reduced the levels of the inflammatory factors IL-1β, TNFα and IL-6 in vivo and in vitro. Furthermore, we demonstrated that Ptd-1 could attenuate the expression of p-ERK1/2 and β-catenin, and that the levels of inflammatory factors were elevated in the presence of ERK1/2 and β-catenin agonists. Interestingly, we determined that activation of the ERK1/2 pathway promoted β-catenin expression, which further regulated the IL-6/STAT3 signaling pathway. Ptd-1 blocked ERK1/2 signaling, leading to decreased expression of inflammatory factors, which in turn improved vascular calcification. Taken together, our study reveals that Ptd-1 ameliorates vascular calcification by regulating the production of inflammatory factors, providing new ideas for the treatment of vascular calcification.",

However, PTS-mediated Nrf2 regulation in diabetic wounds has yet to be elucidated. We used IC21 macrophage-conditioned media to simulate complex events that can influence the fibroblast phenotype using L929 cells during the wound healing process under a hyperglycemic microenvironment. We found that PTS attenuated fibroblast migration and alpha-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) levels and hypoxia-inducible factor- 1 alpha (HIF1α). Furthermore, we demonstrated that wounds in diabetic mice characterized by impaired wound closure in a heightened inflammatory milieu, such as the NOD-like receptor P3 (NLRP3) and intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM1), and deficient Nrf2 response accompanying lowered Akt signaling and heme oxygenase1 (HO1) expression along with the impaired macrophage M2 marker CD206 expression, was rescued by administration of PTS. Such an elicited response was also compared favorably with the standard treatment using Regranex, a commercially available topical formulation for treating DFUs. Our findings suggest that PTS regulates Nrf2 in diabetic wounds, triggering a pro-wound healing response mediated by macrophages. This insight holds the potential for developing targeted therapies to heal chronic wounds, including DFUs.",

The aim of the present study is to assess the impact of a Mediterranean Diet supplemented with NR and PTER and/or with coconut oil on the anthropometric variables of patients with ALS. A prospective, mixed, randomized, analytical and experimental pilot study in humans was performed through a clinical trial (registered with ClinicalTrials.gov under number NCT03489200) with pre- and post-intervention assessments. The sample was made up of 40 subjects categorized into four study groups (Control, Antioxidants, Coconut oil, and Antioxidants + Coconut oil). Pre- and post-intervention anthropometric assessments were carried out to determine the following data: weight, percentage of fat and muscle mass, skinfolds, body perimeters, Body Mass Index (BMI), Waste-to-Hip Index (WHI) and Waist-Height Ratio (WHR). Compared to the Control group, GAx significantly increased muscle mass percentage and decreased fat mass percentage, triceps, iliac crest, and abdominal skinfolds. GCoco significantly increased muscle mass percentage and decreased fat mass percentage, subscapular skinfolds, and abdominal skinfolds. GAx + coco significantly increased muscle mass percentage and decreased abdominal skinfolds. Therefore, our results suggest that the Mediterranean Diet supplemented with NR and PTER and the Mediterranean Diet supplemented with coconut oil (ketogenic diet) are the two nutritional interventions that have reported the greatest benefits, at anthropometric level."

The resveratrol derivative pterostilbene possesses numerous physiological activities that hold promise as a novel therapy for the central nervous system (CNS) disorders. This review aimed to summarize the protective mechanisms of pterostilbene in in vitro and in vivo models of CNS disorders and the pharmacokinetics and safety to assess its possible effects on CNS disorders. Available evidence supports the protective effects of pterostilbene in CNS disorders involving mechanisms such as antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity, regulation of lipid metabolism and vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation, improvement of synaptic function and neurogenesis, induction of glioma cell cycle arrest, and inhibition of glioma cell migration and invasion. Studies have identified possible molecular targets and pathways for the protective actions of pterostilbene in CNS disorders including the AMPK/STAT3, Akt, NF-κB, MAPK, and ERK signaling pathways. The possible pharmacological effects and molecular pathways of pterostilbene in CNS disorders are critically discussed in this review. Future studies should aim to increase our understanding of pterostilbene in animal models and humans to further evaluate its role in CNS disorders and the detailed mechanisms.",

Pterostilbene (3', 5'-dimethoxy-resveratrol) features antioxidant and anti-inflammation properties and has been proven neuroprotective. In this study, we aimed to explore whether Pterostilbene could attenuate neuroinflammation after experimental ICH, as well as underlying molecular mechanisms. Here, a collagenase-induced ICH in mice was followed by intraperitoneal injection of Pterostilbene (10 mg/kg) or vehicle once daily. PTE-treated mice performed significantly better than vehicle-treated controls in the neurological behavior test after ICH. Furthermore, our results showed that Pterostilbene reduced lesion volume and neural apoptosis, and alleviated blood-brain barrier (BBB) damage and brain edema. RNA sequencing and subsequent experiments showed that ICH-induced neuroinflammation and microglial proinflammatory activities were markedly suppressed by Pterostilbene treatment. With regard to the mechanisms, we identified that the anti-inflammatory effects of Pterostilbene relied on remodeling mitochondrial dynamics in microglia. Concretely, Pterostilbene reversed the downregulation of OPA1, promoted mitochondrial fusion, restored normal mitochondrial morphology, and reduced mitochondrial fragmentation and superoxide in microglia after OxyHb treatment. Moreover, conditionally deleting microglial OPA1 in mice largely countered the effects of Pterostilbene on alleviating microglial inflammation, BBB damage, brain edema and neurological impairment following ICH. In summary, we provided the first evidence that Pterostilbene is a promising agent for alleviating neuroinflammation and brain injury after ICH in mice, and uncovered a novel regulatory relationship between Pterostilbene and OPA1-mediated mitochondrial fusion.",

      "abstract": "Pterostilbene, an important analogue of the star molecule resveratrol and a novel compound naturally occurring in blueberries and grapes, exerts a significant neuroprotective effect on cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R), but its mechanism is still unclear. This study aimed to follow the molecular mechanisms behind the potential protective effect of pterostilbene against I/R induced injury. For fulfilment of our aim, we investigated the protective effects of pterostilbene on I/R injury caused by middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in vivo and oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) in vitro. Machine learning models and molecular docking were used for target exploration and validated by western blotting. Pterostilbene significantly reduced the cerebral infarction volume, improved neurological deficits, increased cerebral microcirculation and improved blood-brain barrier (BBB) leakage. Machine learning models confirmed that the stroke target MMP-9 bound to pterostilbene, and molecular docking demonstrated the strong binding activity. We further found that pterostilbene could depolymerize stress fibers and maintain the cytoskeleton by effectively increasing the expression of the non-phosphorylated actin depolymerizing factor (ADF) in the early stage of I/R. In the late stage of I/R, pterostilbene could activate the Wnt pathway and inhibit the expression of MMP-9 to decrease the degradation of the extracellular basement membrane (BM) and increase the expression of junction proteins. In this study, we explored the protective mechanisms of pterostilbene in terms of both endothelial cytoskeleton and extracellular matrix. The early and late protective effects jointly maintain BBB stability and attenuate I/R injury, showing its potential to be a promising drug candidate for the treatment of ischemic stroke.",

However, its mechanism is still unclear. The cutting-edge air flow-assisted desorption electrospray ionization mass spectrometry imaging (AFADESI-MSI) and spatial metabolomics analysis were applied to investigate the distribution of pterostilbene in ischemic rat brain and the changes of related small molecule metabolic pathways to further explore the potential mechanisms of pterostilbene against cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury. This research found that pterostilbene could significantly restore cerebral microcirculation blood flow, reduce infarct volume, improve neurological function and ameliorate neuronal damage in ischemic rats. Moreover, pterostilbene was widely and abundantly distributed in ischemic brain tissue, laying a solid foundation for the rescue of ischemic penumbra. Further study revealed that pterostilbene played a therapeutic role in restoring energy supply, rebalancing neurotransmitters, reducing abnormal polyamine accumulation and phospholipid metabolism. These findings offer an opportunity to illustrate novel mechanisms of pterostilbene in the treatment of cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury resulting from ischemic stroke.",

      "abstract": "Since obesity causes at least 2.8 million death each year and is a major risk factor for many diseases, it is critical to evaluate alternative treatment approaches. In this context, studies on the research of natural product-based therapeutics in the fight against obesity are increasing. In this study, it was aimed to evaluate the antiadipogenic and antiobesogenic efficacy of pterostilbene a natural phenolic compound in 3T3-L1 cells. The mature 3T3-L1 adipocytes were exposed to pterostilbene at different concentrations and half-maximum inhibitory concentrations (IC50) were determined by MTT assay. Oil-Red-O staining was applied to determine lipid accumulation. Phase contrast microscopy, Giemsa, F-actin and DAPI staining were applied to examine the efficacy of pterostilbene on the morphology of 3T3-L1 adipocyte cells. Moreover, expressions of adinopectin and glucose transporter-4 (Glut-4) in relation to insulin resistance were evaluated using immunofluorescent staining and qRT-PCR. Pterostilbene caused no significant cytotoxicity towards preadipocytes at concentrations ≤7.5 -M and the percentage of viable cells remained above about 86% for 24 h, 48 h and 72 h (p > 0.05). Therefore, pterostilbene treatment at 5 and 7.5 -M was used in the subsequent experiments as safe dosages. In addition, it was observed that pterostilbene treatment reduced lipid accumulation in adipocyte differentiation. Adipocytes treated with a dose of 7.5 -M for 14 days showed less intense lipid deposition and a more spindle-like morphology compared to the adipocytes treated with a dose of 5 -M. Especially on the 14th day, actin filaments were filamentous in adipocytes treated with pterostilbene 7.5 -M compared to the adipocytes treated with a dose of 5 -M; the filaments were similarly oriented as in preadipocytes, and chromatin condensation was observed to be quite high. Our data suggests that the pterostilbene supplementation may help weight control and the antiadipogenic and that antiobesogenic activity is mediated in part by reduction of lipid accumulation and induction of Glut-4 and Adiponectin levels."

Therefore, the search for effective methods for obesity continues. Recently, the anti-obesity effect of stilbenes has attracted attention. In this review, aim was evaluating the effect of pterostilbene and resveratrol against obesity and the possible mechanisms in this effect. Dietary phytochemicals can induce body weight loss by increasing basal metabolic rate and thermogenesis and/or altering lipid metabolism. Stilbenes are products of the plant phenylpropanoid pathway. Very important mechanisms for the anti-obesity impact belonging to resveratrol as well as pterostilbene include thermogenic activation in brown adipose tissue alongside the browning of white adipose tissue. Considering nutrition and dietary habits, which have an important place in lifestyle changes for both the prevention and the treatment of obesity, pterostilbene and resveratrol, which are polyphenols and stilbenes, are seen as promising. However, optimal dose, duration, mechanism, long-term safety, side effects, combination, elucidation of genomic interactions, and lifestyle modifications should be considered.",

      "abstract": "One of the most serious mental health comorbidities associated with diabetes mellitus is depression. The occurrence is almost double in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) compared with the general population. Pterostilbene (PTE), a dimethylated analog of resveratrol, has been reported for significant neuroprotective, anti-inflammatory, hypolipidemic, hypoglycaemic and antioxidant effects. However, its effect on diabetes-induced depression-like behavior (DID) has not been studied. The current study aimed at studying the effects of PTE on depressive-like behavior in male Wistar rats with T2DM. It was induced by single dose administration of nicotinamide (NA) and streptozotocin (STZ). On day 21, forced swim test (FST) was conducted for the confirmation of DID. Rats demonstrating depressive-like behavior were treated with PTE (10, 20 and 40 mg/kg), metformin (MET; 500 mg/kg) and fluoxetine (FLX; 10 mg/kg) for 28 days, orally. At the end of the treatment, behavioral assessment for depression, blood glucose (BG) and lipid profile, oxidative stress markers, gene expression of Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) and histopathological parameters were investigated. PTE significantly reduced weight loss and mitigated depressive-like behavior paradigms such as sucrose preference test (SPT), resident intruder test (RIT) and open field test (OFT). It significantly restored BG, lipid and liver profile, creatinine and antioxidant level. It Improved glucose tolerance, insulin resistance (IR) and reduced cortisol level as well as inflammatory markers. It showed improved morphology of the pancreas, brain, liver and kidney. Gene expression studies revealed that, PTE significantly increased SIRT1 expression. PTE by its virtue to maintain BG, reduced IR, amelioration of the HPA axis, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant activity and improvement of SIRT1 gene expression proved to be effective in the treatment of DID-like behavior in rats.",

      "abstract": "Pterostilbene is a demethylated resveratrol derivative with attractive anti-inflammatory, anti-tumor and anti-oxidative stress activities. However, the clinical use of pterostilbene is limited by its poor selectivity and druggability. Heart failure is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, which is closely related to enhanced oxidative stress and inflammation. There is an urgent need for new effective therapeutic drugs that can reduce oxidative stress and inflammatory responses. Therefore, we designed and synthesized a series of novel pterostilbene chalcone and dihydropyrazole derivatives with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities by the molecular hybridization strategy. The preliminary anti-inflammatory activities and structure-activity relationships of these compounds were evaluated by nitric oxide (NO) inhibitory activity in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-treated RAW264.7 cells, and compound E1 exhibited the most potent anti-inflammatory activities. Furthermore, pretreatment with compound E1 decreased reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation both in RAW264.7 and H9C2 cells by increasing the expression of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), as well as downstream antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1), catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase 1 (GPX1). In addition, compound E1 also significantly inhibited LPS or doxorubicin (DOX)-induced inflammation in both RAW264.7 and H9C2 cells through reducing the expression of inflammatory cytokines by inhibiting nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) signaling pathway. Moreover, we found that compound E1 improved DOX-induced heart failure by inhibiting inflammation and oxidative stress in mouse model, which is mediated by the potential of antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities. In conclusion, this study demonstrated the novel pterostilbene dihydropyrazole derivative E1 was identified as a promising agent for heart failure treatment.",

      "abstract": "Breast cancer remains the leading cause of cancer-associated mortality in women. Research investigating novel therapeutic approaches is thus crucial, including phytotherapeutics. Pterostilbene (PTS) is a phytochemical agent with promising efficacy against breast cancer. Poor solubility, low bioavailability and chemical instability are major drawbacks compromising PTS functionality. Herein, novel PTS-loaded solid lipid nanoparticles (PTS-SLNs) were fabricated using the ultrasonication technique. Dual-functionalization with lactoferrin (Lf) and chondroitin-sulfate (CS; CS/Lf/PTS-SLNs) was adopted as active-targeting approach. CS/Lf/PTS-SLNs demonstrated nanoparticle-size (223.42 ± 18.71 nm), low PDI (0.33 ± 0.017), acceptable zeta potential (-11.85 ± 0.07 mV) and controlled release (72.93 ± 2.93% after 24 h). In vitro studies on triple-negative MDA-MB-231 revealed prominent cytotoxicity of CS/Lf/PTS-SLNs (2.63-fold IC50 reduction), higher anti-migratory effect and cellular uptake relative to PTS-solution. The in vivo anti-tumor efficacy in an orthotopic cancer model verified the superiority of CS/Lf/PTS-SLNs; achieving 2.4-fold decrease in tumor growth compared to PTS-solution. On the molecular level, CS/Lf/PTS-SLNs enhanced suppression of VEGF, down-regulated cyclin D1 and upregulated caspase-3 and BAX, compared to PTS-solution. Also, immunohistochemical assay confirmed the higher anti-tumorigenic effect of CS/Lf/PTS-SLNs (5.87-fold decrease in Bcl-2 expression) compared to PTS-solution. Our findings highlight CS/Lf/PTS-SLNs as a promising nanoplatform for phytotherapeutic targeted-breast cancer therapy.",

Herein, we investigated the role of pterostilbene (Pte) in CIH-mediated oxidative stress in the brain tissue. A CIH mouse model was constructed by alternately reducing and increasing oxygen concentration in a sealed box containing the mouse; brain tissue and serum were then collected after intragastric administration of Pte. Neurological function was evaluated through field experiments. The trajectory of the CIH mice to the central region initially decreased and then increased after Pte intervention. Pte increased the number of neuronal Nissl bodies in the hippocampus of CIH mice, upregulated the protein levels of Bcl-2, occludin, and ZO-1 as well as the mRNA and protein levels of cAMP-response element binding protein (CREB) and p-BDNF, and reduced the number of neuronal apoptotic cells, Bax protein levels, IBA-1, and GFAP levels. Simultaneously, Pte reversed the decreased levels of superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-PX), and BDNF and increased levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) in the serum of CIH mice. Pte increased Th2 cells, Treg cells, IL-4, IL-10, and TGF-β1 levels and decreased Th1 cells, Th17 cells, IFN-γ, IL-6, and IL- 17A levels in activated BV2 cells and hippocampus in CIH mice. The protein levels of p-ERK1/2, TLR4, p-p38, p-p65, and Bax, apoptosis rate, MDA concentration, Bcl-2 protein level, cell viability, and SOD and GSH-PX concentrations decreased after the activation of BV2 cells.

Primary analytical methods for examining CD-PTB products included differential scanning calorimetry and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy to detect the occurrence of binary complex formation. Phase solubility analysis was used to probe CD-PTB complexation in an aqueous solution. Complexation was evident in both the solid-state and in solution. Complex association constants (K1:1) in an aqueous solution spanned the approximate range of 15,000 to 55,000 M-1; the values increased with the CDs in the order HPβCD < DIMEB < RAMEB < SBECD. Significant PTB solubility enhancement factors were recorded at 100 mM CD concentrations, the most accurately determined values being in the range 700-fold to 1250-fold."

The outcome of this study shows that PTER-ITC effectively reduced the TR/MCF-7 (IC50: 37.21 µM) and 5-FUR/MDA-MB 231 (IC50: 47.00 µM) cell survival by inducing apoptosis, inhibiting cell migration, colony and spheroid formations in TR/MCF-7 cells, and invasiveness of 5-FUR/MDA-MB 231 cells. Most importantly, PTER-ITC significantly reduced the miR-21 expressions in these resistant cell lines. Moreover, the downstream tumor suppressor target gene of miR-21 such as PTEN, PDCD4, TIMP3, TPM1, and Fas L were upregulated after PTER-ITC treatment, as observed from transcriptional (RT-qPCR) and translational (immunoblotting) data. In silico and miR-immunoprecipitation (miR-IP) results showed reduced Dicer binding to pre-miR-21, after PTER-ITC treatment, indicating inhibition of miR-21 biogenesis. Collectively, the significance of this study is indicated by preliminary evidence for miR-21-modulatory effects of PTER-ITC that highlights the potential of this hybrid compound as an miR-21-targeting therapeutic agent."

PRO (5 × 107/mL) was offered in water, and PS (300 ppm) was provided in the diet ad libitum. 1,2-DMH (20 mg/kg/week) was administered for 15 consecutive weeks. In the 25th week, proctocolectomy was conducted. PRO alone and PRO combined with PS were the best intervention strategies to improve experimental 1,2-DMH-induced CRC regarding several parameters of carcinogenesis. Our findings may contribute to the development of novel preventive strategies for CRC and may help to identify novel modulators of colon carcinogenesis."

      "abstract": "Atopic dermatitis (AD) is one of the most prevalent chronic skin inflammatory disorders requiring continuous treatment and care. Pterostilbene (PTN) belongs to stilbene and is a polyphenolic compound of natural origin. It is similar to resveratrol and has analogous anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant, and anti-carcinogenic characteristics. This study was intended to evaluate the effect of PTN against atopic dermatitis. The disease was induced by sensitization with 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene (DNCB) in mice. The standard control group (SCG) received topical 0.1% tacrolimus (TC), whereas three other treatment groups received daily topical PTN at 0.2, 0.6, and 1% w/w for 28 days. Dermatitis scoring, ear thickness, and body weight of animals were weekly determined while other parameters were assessed at the termination of the experiment. PTN reduced the ear weight, skin thickness, and the weight and size of thymus glands and spleen in comparison with diseased animals. PTN also reduced the elevated immunoglobulin E (IgE) level and blood inflammatory cells in diseased mice. The histopathological findings showed a decreased epidermal thickness in PTN-treated groups. Moreover, treatment with PTN improved the amount of oxidative stress markers in the skin of the diseased mice. The expressions of IL-4, IL-6, TNF-α, and NF-κB in the skin of diseased mice were also reduced by PTN. This study concludes that PTN ameliorated the symptoms of atopic dermatitis through the reduction of inflammation, oxidative damage, and inflammatory cytokines in the skin of diseased animals. Therefore, PTN must be further investigated for the treatment of AD complications and other inflammatory skin disorders.",

Oxidative damage to the ovarian granulosa cells can lead to various diseases related to ovarian dysfunction. Pterostilbene exerts many pharmacological effects, such as anti-inflammatory and cardiovascular protective effects. Moreover, pterostilbene was shown to have antioxidant properties. This study aimed to investigate the effect and underlying mechanism of pterostilbene on oxidative damage in ovarian granulosa cells. Ovarian granulosa cell (OGC) lines COV434 and KGN were exposed to H2O2 to establish an oxidative damage model. After treatment with different concentrations of H2O2 or pterostilbene, the cell viability, mitochondrial membrane potential, oxidative stress, and iron levels were detected, and the expression of ferroptosis-related and Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway-related proteins were evaluated. Pterostilbene treatment could effectively improve cell viability, reduce oxidative stress, and inhibit ferroptosis stimulated by H2O2. More importantly, pterostilbene could up-regulate Nrf2 transcription by stimulating histone acetylation, and inhibition of Nrf2 signaling could reverse the therapeutic effect of pterostilbene. In conclusion, this research shows that pterostilbene protects human OGCs from oxidative stress and ferroptosis through the Nrf2/HO-1 pathway.",

Pterostilbene (PTE) is a natural dimethylated analogue of resveratrol with anticancer and anti-inflammatory activities. This study aimed to investigate the inhibitory effect of PTE on inflammation-associated metastasis and explore the underlying mechanisms. METHODS: Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced lung inflammation and melanoma metastasis models were established in mice. After PTE treatment for four weeks, the organ index, histological changes, proinflammatory cytokines, and the expression and activity of neutrophil elastase (NE), a biomarker of neutrophil influx in the lungs, were analysed. Additionally, direct effects of PTE on NE-induced B16 cell migration were explored in wound healing and Transwell assays, and the expression of thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1) and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers were also detected. RESULTS: PTE obviously attenuated the LPS-induced metastasis of circulatory B16 cells to lungs by reducing the number of metastatic nodules on the lung surfaces and the lung weight/body weight ratio. PTE treatment also significantly reduced LPS-activated increase levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and interleukin (IL)-6 in the lungs of tumor-bearing mice. In addition, increased expression and enzyme activity of NE and decreased expression of TSP-1 were observed, and these were blocked by PTE. In vitro, PTE at concentrations without cytotoxicity also markedly suppressed NE-triggered B16 cell migration, prevented NE-induced TSP-1 proteolysis and reversed the expression of vimentin, N-cadherin and E-cadherin. CONCLUSION: PTE could block inflammation-enhanced tumor metastasis, and the underlying mechanism might be associated with the inhibition of NE-mediated TSP-1 degradation."

However, effective vaccines or treatments for EV-D68 infections remain scarce. We demonstrated that the active constituent of blueberries, pterostilbene (Pte), and its major metabolite, pinostilbene (Pin), facilitated innate immune responses in EV-D68-infected human respiratory cells. Pte and Pin treatment clearly relieved EV-D68-triggered cytopathic effects. Importantly, both Pte and Pin disrupted viral RNA replication (EC50 rank from 1.336 to 4.997 µM) and infectious virion production in a dose-dependent manner, without cytotoxicity at virucidal concentrations. Pte- or Pin-treated respiratory cells did not show any influences on EV-D68 entry but showed substantially decreased viral RNA replication and protein synthesis. Finally, we showed that Pte and Pin broadly suppressed the replication capacity of circulating EV-D68 strains isolated from recent pandemics. In summary, our results suggest that Pte and its derivative, Pin, enhance host immune recognition of EV-D68 and suppress EV-D68 replication, which represents a promising strategy for antiviral drug development.",

Treatment of advanced melanoma is very difficult; therefore, there is growing interest in the identification of new therapeutic agents. Pterostilbene is a natural stilbene that has been found to have several pharmacological activities. The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of pterostilbene on the proliferation and apoptosis of human melanoma cells. Proliferation of pterostilbene-treated amelanotic (C32) and melanotic (A2058) melanoma cells was determined by BRDU assay. Flow cytometric analyses were used to determine cell cycle progression, and further molecular investigations were performed using real-time RT-qPCR. The expression of the p21 protein and the DNA fragmentation assay were determined by the ELISA method. The results revealed that pterostilbene reduced the proliferation of both amelanotic and melanotic melanoma cells. Pterostilbene induced apoptosis in amelanotic C32 melanoma cells, and this effect was mediated by an increase in the expression of the BAX, CASP9, and CASP9 genes; induction of caspase 3 activity; and DNA degradation. Pterostilbene did not affect the activation of apoptosis in the A2058 cell line. It may be concluded that pterostilbene has anticancer potential against human melanoma cells; however, more studies are still needed to fully elucidate the effects of pterostilbene on amelanotic and melanotic melanoma cells.",

Here, we attempt to discern macrophage responses to hemin via regulation of the nuclear factor-erythroid factor 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) that could help us better understand the pathophysiology of diabetic foot ulcers (DFU). We demonstrate the alleviation of hemin-mediated Nrf2 suppression and M2 macrophage polarization by pterostilbene (PTS), a proven Nrf2 activator. IC-21 macrophages were treated with hemin under the normoglycemic or hyperglycemic environment with or without PTS and the expression levels of various markers, such as Nrf2 and its downstream target Heme Oxygenase-1 (HO-1), CD206, Ferroportin-1 among others were analyzed using qPCR and Western blot. Our results revealed that hemin under hyperglycemia reduced Nrf2 activation and its downstream targets, M2 polarization, and the induction of a proinflammatory cellular environment, and interestingly all of these were remedied by PTS treatment. Gelatin zymography of matrix metalloproteinase2 (MMP2) expression revealed that hemin under hyperglycemic condition significantly elevated MMP2 expression, which was reversed by PTS treatment. Further proteomic analysis using liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) revealed a heightened cellular stress profile accompanying inflammation that was suppressed by PTS. This study has furthered our understanding on the role of Nrf2 in attenuating hemin-induced perturbations in macrophage responses and suggests a potential therapeutic target in the management of DFU.",

However, neuropathy is a devastating side effect leading to poor compliance and treatment cessation. AIM: The current study explored pterostilbene plausible neuroprotective effects aiming to ascertain the potential mechanisms involved in relieving oxaliplatin-induced peripheral neuropathy (OIPN) and investigating whether pterostilbene and celecoxib combination could show better relief. MAIN METHODS: Rats were divided into six groups; control, pterostilbene (40 mg/kg/day, p.o. for 5 weeks), oxaliplatin (4 mg/kg, i.p. twice per week for 4.5 weeks), celecoxib (30 mg/kg/day, p.o. for 5 weeks) and combination of pterostilbene and celecoxib. Behavioral tests and histopathological analysis of sciatic nerves were done. MAPKs, cytokines, COX-2, and PGE2 gene and protein expressions were estimated using qRT-PCR, western, and ELISA techniques. Malondialdehyde (MDA) and total antioxidant capacity (TAC) were assessed by colorimetric assay while apoptotic markers by immunohistochemical analysis and qRT-PCR. KEY FINDINGS: The study revealed that pterostilbene and celecoxib averted oxaliplatin-induced behavioral and motor impairments along with restoration of histopathological changes. Moreover, pterostilbene and celecoxib have significantly attenuated sciatic nerve: p38 MAPK, JNK, ERK1/2, NF-κB, COX-2, PGE2, TNF-α, and interleukins levels. Pterostilbene and celecoxib have reduced caspase-3, Bax, and MDA while increasing Bcl-2 level and TAC. SIGNIFICANCE: Altogether, Pterostilbene mitigates OIPN by interrupting the vicious cycle of inflammation, oxidation, and apoptosis. Furthermore, pterostilbene and celecoxib show comparable attenuation on MAPKs cascades, inflammatory cytokines, oxidative and apoptotic markers. Likewise, co-administration of pterostilbene and celecoxib shows further relief of neuropathic pain.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), a member of the β-herpesvirus family, causes the establishment of a latent infection that persists throughout the life of the host and can be reactivated when immunity is weakened. To date, there is no vaccine to prevent HCMV infection, and clinically approved drugs target the stage of viral replication and have obvious adverse reactions. Thus, development of novel therapeutics is urgently needed. METHODS: In the current study, we identified a naturally occurring pterostilbene that inhibits HCMV Towne strain replication in human diploid fibroblast WI-38 cells through Western blotting, qPCR, indirect immunofluorescence assay, tissue culture infective dose assays. The time-of-addition experiment was carried out to identify the stage at which pterostilbene acted. Finally, the changes of cellular senescence biomarkers and reactive oxygen species production brought by pterostilbene supplementation were used to partly elucidate the mechanism of anti-HCMV activity. RESULTS: Our findings revealed that pterostilbene prevented lytic cytopathic changes, inhibited the expression of viral proteins, suppressed the replication of HCMV DNA, and significantly reduced the viral titre in WI-38 cells. Furthermore, our data showed that pterostilbene predominantly acted after virus cell entry and membrane fusion. The half-maximal inhibitory concentration was determined to be 1.315 μM and the selectivity index of pterostilbene was calculated as 26.73. Moreover, cell senescence induced by HCMV infection was suppressed by pterostilbene supplementation, as shown by a decline in senescence-associated β-galactosidase activity, decreased production of reactive oxygen species and reduced expression of p16, p21 and p53, which are considered biomarkers of cellular senescence. CONCLUSION: Together, our findings identify pterostilbene as a novel anti-HCMV agent that may prove useful in the treatment of HCMV replication.",

Pterostilbene (PTE) is a natural plant polyphenolic compound with good anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and cell regeneration effects, yet its effectiveness in treating FB1-induced cytotoxicity remains to be explored. In this study, we used porcine alveolar macrophages (3D4/21) as a model to characterize the cytotoxicity induced by FB1, and to investigate the potential alleviating effect of PTE on FB1-induced cytotoxicity. We demonstrate that FB1 induces cytotoxicity, apoptosis, pro-inflammatory cytokine production and mitochondrial damage, which can be largely recovered by PTE treatment, suggesting the promising application of PTE to treat FB1-induced damage. Mechanistically, FB1 activates the JAK/STAT signaling pathway, while PTE attenuates FB1-induced cytotoxicity through the inhibition of key JAK/STAT genes such as JAK2 and STAT3. Overall, our study characterized the molecular mechanism for FB1-induced cytotoxicity and found PTE to be a promising component which can alleviate FB1-induced cytotoxicity by interfering in the activation of JAK/STAT pathway."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Pulmonary fibrosis (PF) is a chronic progressive interstitial lung disease caused by a variety of factors. AIM: To systematically evaluate the therapeutic effect of pterostilbene (PTE) on experimental PF in asthma and other oxidative damage pathway-related diseases, and to provide evidence for clinical treatment. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Chinese and English databases such as CNKI, Wanfang, VIP, PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and CBM were searched by computer. The Chinese literature on pterostilbene for the treatment of asthma by evaluating experimental pulmonary fibrosis, diabetes, and myocardial infarction was collected from the establishment of a randomized controlled trial until May 2021.Outcome indicators include related physical and chemical indicators such as MDA and SOD. Data were analysed using Review Manager 5.4 software after screening by 2 researchers. RESULTS: Seven randomized controlled animal experiments were included, with a total sample size of 62 cases. Meta-analysis results showed the following: 1) compared with pulmonary fibrosis, diabetes and other model groups, the pterostilbene intervention group were able to up-regulate SOD, and the effect was better than that of the model group (MD = 20.87, 95% CI: 19.41-22.33; n = 7, I 2 = 96%); the pterostilbene intervention group could also up-regulate the expression of GSH, and its effect was better than that of the model group (MD = 9.37, 95% CI: 8.67-10.07; n = 2, I 2 = 98%). The MDA level of the intervention group was significantly down regulated, and the intervention group was also better than the model group. Pterostilbene can prevent experimental PF by lowering the level of MDA. CONCLUSIONS: Pterostilbene can effectively improve experimental pulmonary fibrosis, diabetes, myocardial infarction, and other oxidative damage pathway-related diseases have certain guiding significance for clinical trials on asthma."

Besides, the cellular toxicity of the PTENPs was determined in vitro, and biocompatibility testing was performed on a colitis mice model to determine its safety. The self-assembled PTENPs showed potency in treating IBD, which was featured by effectively anti-oxidant capacity, inhibition of cellular damages, and an anti-inflammatory role. In addition, PTENPs could inhibit the activation of TLR4, thereby inhibiting the NF-κB and MAPK signaling pathways. Meanwhile, it could protect colonic tissues from oxidative damage, which promoted the remission of colonic inflammation with low toxicity. Compared with free PTE, PTENPs could effectively ameliorate acute IBD with low toxicity, which may be related to the inactivation of TLR4, and inhibition of NF-κB and MAPK signaling pathways.",

Pterostilbene is a natural compound proven to exhibit various pharmacological properties, including chemo-preventive effects. This study aimed to explore the chemo-preventive effect of oral pterostilbene during initiation, promotion or continuous on multistage skin SCC mouse models induced by 7,12-Dimethylbenz(a)anthracene (DMBA)/12-O-Tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA). The experimental design consists of five groups of female Institute of Cancer Research (ICR) mice, with two control groups of vehicle and cancer. Three oral pterostilbene groups consisted of orally administered pterostilbene during initiation, promotion, or continuously. Oral pterostilbene significantly reduced the number and volume of tumours. Oral pterostilbene demonstrated less severe skin histology changes compared to the cancer control group, with less pleomorphic in the cells and nuclei, and the basement membrane remained intact. Our results showed fewer invasive tumours in oral PT-treated groups than in cancer groups that displayed mitotic bodies, highly pleomorphic cells and nuclei, and basement membrane invasion. The cell proliferation marker (Ki-67) was reduced in oral pterostilbene-treated groups. Overall, oral pterostilbene is a promising chemo-preventive intervention due to its anti-initiation and anti-promotion on skin carcinogenesis. Thus, the potential molecular mechanisms of oral pterostilbene chemo-prevention agent should be explored."

This study explored the protective effects of natural stilbene pterostilbene on colon inflammation using the IUGR piglets and the tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α)-treated human colonic epithelial cells (Caco-2) by targeting ER stress and autophagy. RESULTS: Both the IUGR colon and the TNF-α-treated Caco-2 cells exhibited inflammatory responses, ER stress, and impaired autophagic flux (P < 0.05). The ER stress inducer tunicamycin and the autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine further augmented inflammatory responses and apoptosis in the TNF-α-treated Caco-2 cells (P < 0.05). Conversely, pterostilbene inhibited ER stress and restored autophagic flux in the IUGR colon and the TNF-α-treated cells (P < 0.05). Pterostilbene also prevented the release of inflammatory cytokines and nuclear translocation of nuclear factor kappa B p65, reduced intestinal permeability and cell apoptosis, and facilitated the expression of intestinal tight junction proteins in the IUGR colon and the TNF-α-treated cells (P < 0.05). Importantly, treatment with tunicamycin or autophagosome-lysosome binding inhibitor chloroquine blocked the positive effects of pterostilbene on inflammatory response, cell apoptosis, and intestinal barrier function in the TNF-α-exposed Caco-2 cells (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Pterostilbene mitigates ER stress and promotes autophagic flux, thereby improving colon inflammation and barrier dysfunction in the IUGR piglets and the TNF-α-treated Caco-2 cells."

      "abstract": "Pterostilbene (PTS), a compound most abundantly found in blueberries, is a natural analog of resveratrol. Several plant species, such as peanuts and grapes, produce PTS. While resveratrol has been extensively studied for its antioxidant properties, recent evidence also points out the diverse therapeutic potential of PTS. Several studies have identified the robust pharmacodynamic features of PTS, including better intestinal absorption and elevated hepatic stability than resveratrol. Indeed, due to its higher bioavailability paired with reduced toxicity compared to other stilbenes, PTS has become an attractive drug candidate for the treatment of several disease conditions, including diabetes, cancer, cardiovascular disease, neurodegenerative disorders, and aging. This review article provides an extensive summary of the nutraceutical potential of PTS in various disease conditions while discussing the crucial mechanistic pathways implicated. In particular, we share insights from our studies about the Nrf2-mediated effect of PTS in diabetes and associated complications. Moreover, we elucidate the important sources of PTS and discuss in detail its pharmacokinetics and the range of formulations and routes of administration used across experimental studies and human clinical trials. Furthermore, this review also summarizes the strategies successfully used to improve dietary availability and the bio-accessibility of PTS.",

      "abstract": "Prolonged glucocorticoid treatment often leads to glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis (GIOP), a common iatrogenic complication. This study has explored the anti-osteoporotic potential of semi-synthetic compound, pterostilbene isothiocyanate (PTER-ITC) in GIOP rat model and bone formation potential in vitro. Dysregulated bone-remodelling leads to osteoporosis. PTER-ITC has shown anti-osteoclastogenic activity in vitro. However, its molecular target remains unidentified, which has been explored in this study through in silico and experimental approaches. Alizarin Red S and von-Kossa staining, and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity showed the osteogenic differentiation potential of PTER-ITC in pre-osteoblastic mouse MC3T3-E1 and human hFOB 1.19 cells, further, confirmed through the expressions of osteogenic markers at transcriptional (RT-qPCR) and translational (immunoblotting) levels. The anti-osteoclastogenic property of PTER-ITC was confirmed through inhibition of actin ring formation in mouse RAW 264.7 and human THP-1 macrophagic cells. Molecular docking and molecular dynamic simulation showed that PTER-ITC inhibited the crucial osteoclastogenic RANK/TRAF6 interaction, which was further confirmed biochemically through co-immunoprecipitation assay. Osteoporotic bone architecture [validated through scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray radiography, and micro-computed tomography (µ-CT)], physiology (confirmed through compression testing, Young's modulus and stress versus strain output) and histology (verified through hematoxylin-eosin, Alizarin Red S, von-Kossa and Masson-trichrome staining) of PTER-ITC-treated GIOP female Wistar rats were assuaged. Osteoporotic amelioration through PTER-ITC treatment was further substantiated through serum biomarkers, like, parathyroid hormone (PTH), ALP, calcium (Ca2+), Procollagen type I N-terminal propeptide (P1NP), and 25-hydroxy vitamin D. In conclusion, this study identifies the molecular target of PTER-ITC in impeding osteoclastogenesis and facilitating osteogenesis to ameliorate osteoporosis.",

It exhibits anti-inflammatory, analgesic, anti-oxidant and neuroprotective activities. This research was aimed to determine the potential of pterostilbene against arthritis and peripheral neuropathy in Complete Freund's Adjuvant (CFA) induced arthritis. Rat hind paw was injected with 0.1 ml CFA to induce arthritis. Standard control animals received oral methotrexate (3 mg/kg/week). Pterostilbene at 12.5, 25 and 50 mg/kg was given orally to different groups of arthritic rats from day 7-28 for 21 days. Pterostilbene significantly reduced paw diameter and retarded the decrease in body weight of arthritic rats. It profoundly (p < 0.05-0.0001) reduced lipid peroxidation and nitrites, while increased superoxide dismutase (SOD) in the liver tissue. Pterostilbene treatment significantly (p < 0.0001) reduced TNF-α and IL-6 levels. Pterostilbene markedly improved (p < 0.05-0.001) motor activity and showed analgesic effect in arthritic rats at 25 and 50 mg/kg as compared to disease control rats. Furthermore, it notably (p < 0.05-0.0001) increased SOD activity, nitrites, noradrenaline and serotonin levels in the sciatic nerve of arthritic rats. Treatment with pterostilbene also ameliorated the CFA-induced pannus formation, cartilage damage and synovial hyperplasia in the arthritic rat paws. It is determined from the current study that pterostilbene was effective in reducing CFA-induced arthritis in rats through amelioration of oxidative stress and inflammatory mediators. It was also effective to treat peripheral neuropathy through modulation of oxidative stress and neurotransmitters in sciatic nerves.",

The aim of this study was to construct a folate modified pterostilbene (Pt) loaded polymeric micellar delivery system (F-Pt/M) with mPEG-PCL as carrier material to aim at penetrating the BBB for brain tissue targeting via receptor-mediated endocytosis. In this study, F-Pt/M was prepared using thin-film hydration method and then optimized by response surface methodology (RSM) with the entrapment efficiency (EE), drug loading (DL) and hydrodynamic diameter (HD) as indexes. The average hydrodynamic diameter and zeta potential of optimal F-Pt/M were 133.2 nm and 24.6 mV, respectively. DL (18.3%) and EE (98.6%) made the solubility of Pt in water about 25 times higher than that of crude Pt. Results of DSC evaluation revealed that drugs were successfully encapsulated inside the polymeric micelles. TEM images showed that homogeneous spherical micellar structures with a narrow size distribution were developed. The release result in vitro showed that F-Pt/M presented sustained release behavior compared to control free Pt solution. Compared to non-targeted Pt/M, F-Pt/M had a significantly higher cytotoxicity against FR-overexpressing A172 cells. In vitro cellular uptake tests illustrated that the micellar delivery system could significantly improve the accumulation of drugs in target cells via receptor-mediated endocytosis. BBB penetration value (P) of F-Pt/M was about 4 folds higher than that of free Pt group. In addition, drug targeting index (DTI) was calculated to determine targeting of F-Pt/M to the brain which was found to be 4.89, implying improved brain targeting was achieved. Hence, the developed F-Pt/M exhibited great potential for delivering more drug molecules across the BBB for the treatment of brain diseases.",

The results showed that pterostilbene supplementation diminished the oxidation of MP compared to the control, as the carbonyl content was significantly reduced and the loss of sulfhydryl and free amino groups was slowed. Meanwhile, the surface hydrophobicity and insolubility of MP were significantly reduced. FT-IR and endogenous fluorescence spectroscopy analysis indicated that dietary pterostilbene inhibited the unfolding of protein structure and the transition of α-helix to β-sheet structure. The integrity of the protein structure contributed to the gel quality. The strength, whiteness and water-holding capacity (WHC) of MP gels were improved in the pterostilbene treatment group. In terms of microstructure, pterostilbene facilitated the formation of dense and homogeneous gel network structure. In summary, these findings suggest that pterostilbene could be used as a dietary supplement to maintain the structural stability of MP in postmortem chicken breast muscle, allowing for excellent gel functional properties.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common joint disease in the world. Among the many risk factors for OA, aging is one of the most critical factors. The treatment with senop-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) is one of the important, promising anti-aging strategies at present. Pterostilbene (PTE) is a trans-stilbene compound with anti-tumor, anti-oxidation, anti-inflammatory, and anti-aging pharmacologic activities. The purpose of this study is to explore the therapeutic effects of PTE on articular chondrocyte senescence and OA and its related mechanisms. METHODS: Male Sprague-Dawley rats were operated on with transection of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACLT) and a destabilized medial meniscus (DMM) surgery to establish the OA model and then injected intraperitoneally with PTE (20 mg/kg) for 5 weeks. Finally, rats were sacrificed and knee joints were collected for histologic analysis. Rat chondrocytes were stimulated with interleukin-1β (IL-1β) with or without PTE treatment. The therapeutic effects of PTE and related mechanisms were investigated by examining and analyzing relative markers through senescence-associated β-galactosidase (SA-β-Gal) assay, cell cycle, qRT-PCR, western blot, bioinformatic analysis, immunofluorescence, and molecular modeling. RESULTS: With in vivo experiments, PTE can significantly reduce the Mankin scores and OARSI scores of the knee joint in ACLT+DMM OA model rats and reduce the interleukin-6 (IL-6) level in the knee lavage fluid. Immunohistochemical staining showed that compared to the OA group, the PTE treatment group had significantly increased expression of collagen type II in articular cartilage, and significantly decreased matrix metalloproteinase 13 (MMP-13) and IL-6, the main SASP proteins, and had expression of p16 and p21, markers of aging in chondrocytes. In vitro, PTE reduced the ratio of SA-β-Gal positive chondrocytes and G0-G1 phase chondrocytes in IL-1β-induced rat chondrocytes. PTE significantly inhibited the expression of MMP-13, IL-6, thrombospondin motif 5 (ADAMTS5), p16, and p21, and significantly increased the expression of collagen type II. Bioassay and subsequent western blot showed that PTE significantly inhibited the activation of PI3K/AKT and NF-κB signaling pathways. The results of molecular docking experiments showed that PTE could bind closely to the sites of PI3K protein, thereby inhibiting the phosphorylation of PI3K. CONCLUSIONS: The experimental results indicate that PTE plays an anti-chondrocyte senescence role in the treatment of OA by inhibiting the PI3K/AKT/NF-κB signaling pathway and reducing expression of SASP."

      "abstract": "Dry eye disease is a common condition that affects the eyes. It is caused by problems with the tear film and the tear dynamics. Dry eye can be caused by an increase in the amount of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the corneal epithelium. The treatment for dry eye typically focuses on relieving the uncomfortable symptoms by using eye drops such as artificial tears, antibiotics, and by using anti-inflammatory/immunosuppressive agents such as cyclosporine, and lifitegrast. However, the recovery of patients with dry eye can take several years particularly if the symptoms are severe. This is because the present treatment approaches for dry eye are not based on its cause, e.g., the oxidative stress arising from the rapid increase in ROS. This work describes a new type of antioxidant made from pterostilbene (PS) and carboxyl-chitosan modified graphene (CG). The use of a hydrophilic two-dimensional CG nanosheet to improve the properties of PS is reported. Superior enhanced properties including better cellular permeability, long sustained release period (over 30 h), and antioxidant properties, were realized by using PS-CG. A hyperosmotic (HS) damaged human corneal epithelial cell (HCEC) model was used for antioxidant tests. This model has an intracellular ROS level 4 times more than that of a control group. The ROS content was declined efficiently to the same amount as normal cells in the PS-CG treated HS group. There was a significant decline in the content of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and the apoptosis rate of HCEC in the PS-CG treated HS group when compared to that seen in the HS model. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and western blots (WB) were used to understand the antioxidant mechanism of PS-CG. The results showed that the antioxidant was working by activating the Keap1-Nrf2-ARE signalling pathway. In vivo testing testing using a dry eye mouse model suggested that the PS-CG acted as an efficient antioxidant. More tear production and healthier corneal and conjunctival epithelial cells were achieved when PC-CG was applied to this model. The use of PS-CG could be a new strategy for treating dry eye and other ocular diseases caused by ROS."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The prevalence of NAFLD is increasing globally and on a path to becoming the most frequent cause of chronic liver disease. Strategies for the prevention and treatment of NAFLD are urgently needed. APPROACH AND RESULTS: A 6-month prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial was conducted to assess the efficacy of daily NRPT (commercially known as Basis, a combination of nicotinamide riboside and pterostilbene) supplementation in 111 adults with NAFLD. The study consisted of three arms: placebo, recommended daily dose of NRPT (NRPT 1×), and a double dose of NRPT (NRPT 2×). NRPT appeared safe and well tolerated. At the end of the study, no significant change was seen in the primary endpoint of hepatic fat fraction with respect to placebo. However, among prespecified secondary outcomes, a time-dependent decrease in the circulating levels of the liver enzymes alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT) was observed in the NRPT 1× group, and this decrease was significant with respect to placebo. Furthermore, a significant decrease in the circulating levels of the toxic lipid ceramide 14:0 was also observed in the NRPT 1× group versus placebo, and this decrease was associated with a decrease in ALT in individuals of this group. A dose-dependent effect was not observed with respect to ALT, GGT, or ceramide 14:0 in the NRPT 2× group. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that NRPT at the recommended dose is safe and may hold promise in lowering markers of hepatic inflammation in patients with NAFLD.",

The Aspergillus section Nigri causes otomycosis localized in the external auditory canal. In this research, Aspergillus brasiliensis, a species belonging to the Nigri section, was tested. Coumarin 6 and pterostilbene loaded in poly-(lactic-co-glycolic) acid nanoparticles (PLGA-coumarin6-NPs and PLGA-PTB-NPs) were tested for fungal cell uptake and antifungal ability against A. brasiliensis biofilm, respectively. Moreover, the activity of PLGA-PTB-NPs in inhibiting the A. brasiliensis infection was tested using Galleria mellonella larvae. The results showed a fluorescence signal, after 50 nm PLGA-coumarin6-NPs treatment, inside A. brasiliensis hyphae and along the entire thickness of the biofilm matrix, which was indicative of an efficient NP uptake. Regarding antifungal activity, a reduction in A. brasiliensis biofilm formation and mature biofilm with PLGA-PTB-NPs has been demonstrated. Moreover, in vivo experiments showed a significant reduction in mortality of infected larvae after injection of PLGA-PTB-NPs compared to free PTB at the same concentration. In conclusion, the PLGA-NPs system can increase the bioavailability of PTB in Aspergillus section Nigri biofilm by overcoming the biofilm matrix barrier and delivering PTB to fungal cells.",

      "abstract": "A novel pro-phytomicelle formulation with small molecule phytochemicals as nanomaterials was developed for the oral delivery of pterostilbene (PTE) in our previous work. The present report was designed to preclinically evaluate the in vivo oral bioavailability, organ and tissue distribution, as well as the strengthened efficacy against acetaminophen-induced liver damage of this novel formulation, named PTE pro-phytomicelles. After oral administration in rats, an improvement in the area under the curve (AUC)0→t of the PTE pro-phytomicelles (34832.25 vs. 13115.72 ng ml-1 h) and an increase in their maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) (4.940 vs. 2.175 μg ml-1), as compared with those of bare PTE, were observed. The organ and tissue distribution further showed that the PTE pro-phytomicelles could effectively increase the concentration of PTE in all the tested organs and gastrointestinal segments. In the efficacy evaluation, the overdose of Acetaminophen induced severe liver injury in mice, and the oral administration of PTE pro-phytomicelles could efficiently suppress ALT and AST levels in serum, restore histopathological changes, and result in more effective improvement against liver damage via oxidative stress and inflammation cytokine inhibition. The mechanism through which high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) signaling was regulated was involved in this treatment. These results reveal that PTE pro-phytomicelles could achieve significantly improved in vivo profiles than bare PTE, and these pro-phytomicelles might provide a new concept and promising therapeutic potential in terms of PTE nanomedicines.",

Pterostilbene (PTE), derived from grapes and blueberries, might reach a high concentration of intestinal contents. Our study aimed to evaluate PTE's ability to prevent the loss of intestinal epithelial barrier in high loading intensity of exercise. The exercise model was established by the forced running of mice. An effective HPLC-UV method was developed to quantify PTE concentration in intestinal content. The mRNA changes were detected by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). The structure of intestinal flora was analyzed by 16S rRNA sequencing. The PTE (100 mg/kg/d) could significantly attenuate exercise-induced intestinal epithelial barrier loss. Moreover, the HPLC-UV assay showed that the PTE concentration of intestinal content could last 12 h. Furthermore, the exercise increased the abundance of Alistipes, which was related to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) production but could not be reversed by PTE intervention. Besides, cell experiments showed that PTE could promote the expression of intestinal epithelial tight junction (TJ) molecules in vitro. In conclusion, PTE has a significant interest in preventing exercise-induced intestinal damage."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Diabetic kidney disease is a major cause of global end-stage renal diseases. Ectopic lipid deposition in the renal tissues of diabetic kidney disease is one major factor leading to renal fibrosis and chronic kidney disease. Pterostilbene has been reported to display lipid-lowing activity and participate in many kidney diseases. However, the influence of pterostilbene on the ectopic lipid deposition is unclear. We intend to explore the influence of pterostilbene on the ectopic lipid deposition in the kidneys of mice induced by high fat. METHODS: A high-fat diet-induced diabetic mouse model was established to detect the alleviative effect of pterostilbene on the ectopic lipid deposition in the kidneys of diabetic mice. A biochemical analysis was performed to examine the levels of urine albumin, urine creatinine, serum creatinine, and blood urea nitrogen in mice after pterostilbene treatment. Histological analysis was conducted to detect the degree of renal injury and fibrosis. Oil red O staining and immunohistochemical staining were carried out to evaluate lipid droplets and the expression of adipose differentiation-related protein in renal tissues of the mice treated by pterostilbene. The protein levels were assessed by Western blotting. RESULTS: Pterostilbene inhibits the expression of the TGF-β1 and p-smad3 and suppresses the protein levels of SREBP-1 and FAS, and it ultimately reduces the ectopic lipid deposition, alleviates the renal tubular damage and renal fibrosis in the kidneys of diabetic mice induced by high fat, and improves kidney function. CONCLUSION: Pterostilbene alleviates renal fibrosis and ectopic lipid deposition in the kidneys of diabetic mice induced by high-fat diet by inhibiting the TGF-β1/smad3 signaling.",

This study aims to investigate the laxative effect of PTE on loperamide (LOP)-induced STC mice and its influence on intestinal microbes through a combination of network pharmacological analysis and experimental verification. Material and Methods: PTE was used to treat LOP-exposed mice, and the laxative effect of PTE was evaluated by the total intestinal transit time and stool parameters. The apoptosis of Cajal interstitial cells (ICCs) was detected by immunofluorescence. The mechanism of PTE's laxative effect was predicted by network pharmacology analysis. We used western blot technology to verify the predicted hub genes and pathways. Malondialdehyde (MDA) and GSH-Px were tested to reflect oxidative stress levels and the changes of gut microbiota were detected by 16S rDNA high-throughput sequencing. Results: PTE treatment could significantly improve the intestinal motility disorder caused by LOP. Apoptosis of ICCs increased in the STC group, but decreased significantly in the PTE intervention group. Through network pharmacological analysis, PTE might reduce the apoptosis of ICCs by enhancing PI3K/AKT and Nrf2/HO-1 signaling, and improve constipation caused by LOP. In colon tissues, PTE improved the Nrf2/HO-1 pathway and upregulated the phosphorylation of AKT. The level of MDA increased and GSH-Px decreased in the STC group, while the level of oxidative stress was significantly reduced in the PTE treatment groups. PTE also promoted the secretion of intestinal hormone and restored the microbial diversity caused by LOP. Conclusion: Pterostilbene ameliorated the intestinal motility disorder induced by LOP, this effect might be achieved by inhibiting oxidative stress-induced apoptosis of ICCs through the PI3K/AKT/Nrf2 signaling pathway."

Meanwhile, vascular dementia (VaD) is the second most common subtype of dementia, in which inflammation is one of the major pathogenic contributors. However, the protective effect of pterostilbene on VaD is not well understood. In this work, we investigated the effect of pterostilbene on VaD and explored its underlying mechanisms using in vivo and in vitro models. Y-maze and Morris water maze tests showed pterostilbene-attenuated cognitive impairment in mice with bilateral common carotid artery occlusion (BCCAO). The hippocampal neuronal death and microglial activation in BCCAO mice were also reduced by pterostilbene treatment. Further, pterostilbene inhibited the expression of TLR4 and downstream inflammatory cytokines in these mice, with similar results observed in an oxygen-glucose deprivation and reperfusion (OGD/R) BV-2 cell model. In addition, its anti-inflammatory effect on OGD/R BV-2 cells was partially blocked by TLR4 overexpression. Moreover, Triad3A-TLR4 interactions were increased by pterostilbene following enhanced ubiquitination and degradation of TLR4, and the inhibitory effect of pterostilbene on inflammation was blocked by Triad3A knockdown in OGD/R-stimulated BV-2 cells. Together, these results reveal that pterostilbene could reduce vascular cognitive impairment and that Triad3A-mediated TLR4 degradation might be the key target.",

However, DOX can cause a range of significant side effects, of which hepatotoxicity is a common one, and therefore limits its clinical use. Pterostilbene (PTS) has been shown to exhibit anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory effects in the treatment of liver diseases but whether PTS could protect against hepatotoxicity in DOX-treated mice is unknown. Methods: In our study, we use C57/BL6J mice and the HepG2 cell line. We divided the mice in 4 groups: the control, the PTS treatment, the DOX treatment, and the DOX + PTS treatment group. Liver histopathology was judged by performing hematoxylin-eosin and Masson staining. Immunohistochemistry was used to perform the expression of NLRP3. The levels of serum alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST) were evaluated. Levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione (GSH), and DCFH-DA staining were used to evaluate the oxidative injury. Western blot and real-time PCR were applied to evaluate the expressions of proteins and mRNA. MTT was used to evaluate DOX-induced cell injury and the protective effects of PTS. Recombinant Trx-1 was used to analyze the mechanism of PTS. A TUNEL assay was used to detect apoptosis in DOX-induced HepG2 cells and the protective effects of PTS. Results: PTS ameliorated DOX-induced liver pathological changes and the levels of AST and ALT. PTS also decreased the level of MDA, increased the level of SOD, GSH, and the expression of Trx-1 in DOX-treated mice. PTS decreased the levels of NLRP3 and IL-1β mRNA and the expressions of their proteins in DOX-treated mice. In addition, PTS also decreased the expression of Cleaved Caspase-3 and BAX and increased the expression of BCL-2. In vitro, after treatment with recombinant Trx-1, ROS and NLRP3 inflammasome were both decreased. Treatment with PTS could rescue the downregulation of Trx-1, decreased the ROS level and the NLRP3 inflammasome, and protected HepG2 cells against DOX-induced apoptosis. Conclusion: The results show that PTS exhibits protective effects against DOX-induced liver injuries via suppression of oxidative stress, fibrosis, NLRP3 inflammasome stimulation, and cell apoptosis which might lead to a new approach of preventing DOX-induced hepatotoxicity."

The present study was performed to investigate the effects of pterostilbene (Pt) and its derivative 3'-hydroxypterostilbene (OHPt) on free fatty acids (FFA)-induced lipid accumulation in HepG2 cells and high-fat diet (HFD)-induced NAFLD in C57BL/6J mice. The results showed that Pt and OHPt significantly ameliorated FFA-induced steatosis in HepG2 cells and enhanced lipolysis through the upregulation of SIRT1/AMPK and insulin signaling pathways. In the in vivo study, Pt and OHPt treatment resulted in reduced hepatic lipid droplets accumulation. The data showed that Pt and OHPt upregulated the SIRT1/AMPK pathway and subsequently downregulated the protein expression of SREBP-1 to activate fatty acid (FA) β-oxidation to inhibit FA synthesis. Pt and OHPt administration activated the insulin signaling pathway and further ameliorated the insulin resistance and liver function in the HFD-fed mice. Furthermore, Pt and OHPt markedly increased the numbers of Oscillospira and decreased the numbers of Allobaculum, Phascolarctobacterium, and Staphylococcus compared with those in the HFD group. These robust results indicate that Pt and OHPt are able to possess potential health benefits in improving insulin resistance and hepatic steatosis by promoting healthy populations or abundances of considered vital microbiota. Besides, OHPt is more effective than Pt, which might have promising chemotherapeutic effects for future clinical application.",

      "abstract": "The use of molecular-targeted drugs in the treatment of gastric cancer is increasing. However, the variety of molecular-targeted drugs in gastric cancer is still limited, and the development of new molecular-targeted therapies is required. The effect of combining sunitinib (SUN) with pterostilbene (PTE) on the human gastric cancer cell lines TMK1 and MKN74 was examined in in vitro and in vivo. Compared with SUN or PTE treatment alone, cotreatment induced pronounced suppression of cell proliferation, with a marked increase in oxidative stress. SUN was associated with a significant retention of mitochondrial Fe2+. SUN-treated cells decreased expression of PDZ domain-containing protein 8 (PDZD8). Knockdown of PDZD8 in both cells induced Fe2+ retention, and siPDZD8+PTE markedly suppressed cell proliferation with suppressed oxidative phosphorylation, as did the combination of SUN+PTE. In a nude mouse tumor model, a pronounced antitumor effect was observed with SUN+PTE treatment compared to SUN alone. PDZD8 may be a newly discovered off-target for SUN, and that the combined use of PTE with SUN significantly promotes antitumor activity in gastric cancer cell lines. The combined use of SUN and PTE might be a new molecular-targeted therapy for gastric cancer.",

      "abstract": "Myocardial contractile dysfunction caused by sepsis is a serious threat to human health, and its pathogenesis is not completely clear. It is generally believed that excessive inflammation and oxidative stress are the main causes of myocardial damage caused by sepsis. Pterostilbene (PTS) has a variety of biological activities, including anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-aging. Whether PTS protect myocardial function in rats with sepsis through anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant effects has not been reported. In this study, we investigated the role of PTS in septic mice induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Mice were injected intraperitoneally with LPS (20 mg/kg) to simulate sepsis. Use Echocardiography, Masson, DHE, H&E, IHC, IF and other experimental methods to explore the effects of PTS on LPS. The results showed that PTS was indicated to significantly increase the cardiac function of mice with sepsis. PTS treatment also reduced the mRNA expression of IL-1α, IL-6, MCP-1, and IL-1β and the protein expression of NLRP3 in vivo and in vitro, and inhibited the migration of inflammatory cells. PTS treatment also reduced the mRNA expression of collagen I, collagen III and α-SMA, and inhibited fibrosis. PTS treatment reduced the mRNA expression of NOX1, NOX2, and NOX4 and inhibited DHE levels in vivo and in vitro. In summary, our data indicated that PTS played a crucial role in LPS-induced myocardial injured and might be a key target for the prevention and treatment of sepsis-induced myocardial dysfunction."

      "abstract": "Mitochondrial diseases are genetic disorders caused by mutations in genes in the nuclear DNA (nDNA) and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) that encode mitochondrial structural or functional proteins. Although considered \"rare\" due to their low incidence, such diseases affect thousands of patients' lives worldwide. Despite intensive research efforts, most mitochondrial diseases are still incurable. Recent studies have proposed the modulation of cellular compensatory pathways such as mitophagy, AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activation or the mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPRmt) as novel therapeutic approaches for the treatment of these pathologies. UPRmt is an intracellular compensatory pathway that signals mitochondrial stress to the nucleus for the activation of mitochondrial proteostasis mechanisms including chaperones, proteases and antioxidants. In this work a potentially beneficial molecule, pterostilbene (a resveratrol analogue), was identified as mitochondrial booster in drug screenings. The positive effects of pterostilbene were significantly increased in combination with a mitochondrial cocktail (CoC3) consisting of: pterostilbene, nicotinamide, riboflavin, thiamine, biotin, lipoic acid and l-carnitine. CoC3 increases sirtuins' activity and UPRmt activation, thus improving pathological alterations in mutant fibroblasts and induced neurons."

      "abstract": "Periodontitis is a common chronic inflammatory oral disease. The objective of periodontal treatment is to control infection whilst regenerating damaged periodontal tissue. The present study aimed to determine the potential effects of pterostilbene (PTE), a representative stilbene compound, on the proliferation and differentiation of human periodontal ligament stem cells (hPDLSCs). Different concentrations (1, 5, 10 and 20 µM) of PTE were applied to hPDLSCs, after which Cell Counting Kit-8 and western blotting assays were performed to examine the protein levels of Ki67, PCNA, p-IκBα, IκBα, Bcl-2, Bax, cleaved caspase3. The effect of PTE on the release of inflammatory factors, including IL-1β, IL-6 and IL-10 was assessed by RT-qPCR. The apoptosis of TNF-α-induced hPDLSCs was evaluated by TUNEL assay and western blotting. Additionally, the role of PTE in hPDLSC mineralization was evaluated using alizarin red staining. The expression levels of mineralization indices, including RUNX2 and ALP were subsequently determined using western blotting. Subsequently, the target of PTE was predicted using TargetNet database and AutoDock v4.2 software and verified using western blotting. The results of the present study revealed that PTE promoted the proliferation of hPDLSCs in a concentration-dependent manner. Furthermore, PTE treatment decreased the release of inflammatory factors and alleviated the apoptosis of TNF-α-induced hPDLSCs. PTE was also demonstrated to promote the formation of mineral nodules in TNF-α-induced hPDLSCs. The Targetnet database, along with molecular docking, indicated that histone deacetylases (HDACs) were the probable targets of PTE upstream of regulating periodontitis. The results of western blotting implied that TNF-α significantly increased expression levels of HDAC2, 4, 6 and 8, whilst PTE treatment markedly decreased HDAC4, 6 and 8 expression in a concentration-dependent manner compared with the TNF-α group, which further confirmed these conclusions. In summary, results of the present study revealed that PTE promoted TNF-α-induced hPDLSC proliferation and differentiation, whilst alleviating inflammation and apoptosis. PTE also inhibited the expression of HDACs, which may be involved in the mechanism of periodontitis."
