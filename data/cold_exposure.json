      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Most of the patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) suffer from cognitive impairment, fatigue and/or mood disturbances. These symptoms are usually resistant to both disease-modifying and symptomatic treatment. Since there is a trend to a holistic approach to MS patients, we aimed to confirm the effect of combined cold exposure, controlled breathing and mindfulness - Wim Hof Method (WHM) - on neuropsychiatric symptoms of MS. METHODS: In this randomized interventional study we examined the change in the score of specific neuropsychiatric scales/questionnaires before and after the 12-week WHM-based training program. We compared the change with a control group with no intervention. RESULTS: We obtained complete data from 12 patients in the WHM group and 13 patients in the control group. After 12 weeks, the WHM group had significantly higher improvement in cognition - SDMT (p = 0.045), TMT-A (p = 0.041), TMT-B (p < 0.001); fatigue - FSMCC (p = 0.039); anxiety - GAD (p = 0.015), and depression - PHQ-9 (p = 0.033). CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that the Wim Hof method appears to be a suitable complementary non-pharmacological treatment for neuropsychiatric symptoms of MS."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) affects a quarter of the global population and poses a remarkably serious threat to human health. OBJECTIVES: The effect and potential molecular mechanisms of combined cold exposure and exercise intervention on NAFLD remain unclear. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A high-fat diet-induced NAFLD mouse model was utilized. Twenty-four NAFLD mice were divided into three groups and subjected to cold exposure (5 °C), regular-temperature exercise (22 °C), or combined cold exposure and exercise (5 °C) for 8 weeks, 5 days a week, once daily for 1 hour each session. Intervention effects were evaluated through bodyweight, liver mass, liver/bodyweight ratio, blood lipid profile, circulating fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) levels, and liver histopathology. Immunoblotting and quantitative PCR were employed to assess the protein and gene expression of liver FGF21, β-klotho, and FGFR1 to preliminarily elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying NAFLD improvement by combined cold exposure and exercise. RESULTS: Compared with cold exposure or regular-temperature exercise alone, combined cold exposure and exercise significantly reduced the bodyweight, liver weight, and liver/ bodyweight ratio in the NAFLD mice. The levels of blood lipids, circulating FGF21, and liver glycogen also significantly decreased. Furthermore, the combined intervention significantly reduced liver fat deposition and fibrosis and significantly increased the expression of FGFR1 and β-klotho proteins, suggesting the activation of the FGF21-β-klotho/FGFR1 signaling pathway. CONCLUSIONS: This preclinical study demonstrates that combined cold exposure and exercise synergistically alleviates NAFLD progression in animal models, primarily by activating the FGF21-β-klotho/FGFR1 pathway to enhance lipid metabolism and reduce liver injury. These findings highlight the translational potential of dual environmental and behavioral interventions, providing a mechanistic foundation for developing non-pharmacological therapies targeting metabolic pathways in humans, particularly for NAFLD patients resistant to conventional lifestyle modifications or pharmacotherapy."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Visceral adipose tissue (VAT) plays a crucial role in regulating systemic metabolic balance. Excess accumulation of VAT is closely associated with various metabolic disorders, a process that involves the coordinated actions of multiple cell types within the tissue. Cold exposure, as a potential intervention, has been proposed to improve metabolic dysfunction. However, the heterogeneity of VAT and its comprehensive metabolic characteristics under cold exposure remain unclear. METHODS: We collected epididymal white adipose tissue (eWAT) of C57BL/6J mice after cold exposure at three different time points for single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) analysis. RESULTS: We successfully identified ten major cell types in eWAT, enabling understanding of the dynamic changes in the eWAT microenvironment and its metabolic features during cold exposure. This study revealed that cold exposure for 1 day reduced cellular metabolic activity and intercellular communication in eWAT including receptor-ligand-based cell communication and metabolite-mediated interactions. However, after 14 days of cold acclimation, the metabolic activity of adipocytes was significantly enhanced, and intercellular metabolic communication was restored. Additionally, prolonged cold exposure promoted the formation of a distinct adipocyte subpopulation that may be associated with UCP1-independent thermogenesis. These changes may be a new homeostatic state established by VAT to adapt to the cold environment. The study also identified the importance of adipocytes, adipose stem and progenitor cells, myeloid cells, and endothelial cells in the process of cold adaptation. DISCUSSION: This research provides valuable insights into the cellular heterogeneity, adipocyte remodeling, and metabolic reprogramming in eWAT after cold exposure. It highlights the critical role of transcriptional dynamics in eWAT during cold exposure and provides new perspectives on the prevention and treatment of metabolic diseases.",

      "abstract": "Appetite regulation is a complex process that is critical for maintaining energy balance and is governed by intricate molecular and cellular mechanisms in the hypothalamus. RNA-binding proteins play vital roles in the post-transcriptional regulation of mRNA and influence feeding behavior and energy metabolism. This study explored the role of cold-inducible RNA-binding protein (Cirbp) in hypothalamic neurons under metabolic stress conditions, such as fasting and cold exposure. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) of the hypothalami from fasted mice identified 67 differentially expressed RNA-binding proteins, with Cirbp and RNA-binding motif protein 3 (Rbm3) being significantly upregulated. Immunohistochemical analysis confirmed increased Cirbp expression in the arcuate nucleus (ARC) and dorsomedial hypothalamus during fasting, indicating responsiveness to metabolic cues. Ribo-Tag analysis of agouti-related protein (AgRP) neurons demonstrated elevated Cirbp expression levels in response to fasting, linking it to hunger-regulating pathways. Intracerebroventricular injection of Cirbp antisense oligodeoxynucleotides (AS ODN) reduced Cirbp expression, leading to a decrease in food intake and a reduction in body weight, highlighting the functional role of Cirbp in appetite regulation. Cold exposure also induced Cirbp expression in the ARC, which correlated with an increase in food intake. Blockade of Cirbp by AS ODN treatment attenuated cold-induced food intake, indicating that Cirbp plays a specific role in regulating feeding behavior during cold stress. This suggests that Cirbp is a key mediator in hypothalamic responses to metabolic stress, influencing feeding behavior through its regulatory functions in AgRP neurons. Further exploration of Cirbp mechanisms may offer insights into therapeutic strategies for energy balance disorders, such as obesity and anorexia.",

Identifying genes that improve the recovery of photosynthesis from low temperatures in maize will help enhance the cold tolerance of this crop and ensure stable yields. Here, we demonstrate the role of starch phosphorylase 2 (ZmPHOH) in promoting photosynthetic recovery from cold damage. Chlorotic leaf3 (chl3), a null mutant of ZmPHOH, which undergoes chlorophyll degradation and chlorosis earlier than under normal growth conditions after brief exposure to 8 °C and restoration to normal. We determined that chl3 plants could not repair the damage to their photosynthetic system caused by short-term cold exposure after the temperature returned to normal. Metabolome and transcriptome profiling indicated that the soluble sugar content in chl3 leaves was significantly increased after cold treatment and could not be catabolized promptly, leading to repression of photosynthetic gene expression. Our results reveal that ZmPHOH enhances post-cold photosynthetic recovery by promoting the decomposition and metabolism of soluble sugars, thereby regulating the low-temperature resilience in maize, which provides new insights into the chilling tolerance mechanism of maize.",

      "abstract": "Single-atom nanozymes are highly effective in the preparation of tumor vaccines (TV) due to their superior peroxidase (POD) activity and excellent biocompatibility. However, the immunosuppressive environment within tumors can diminish the efficacy of these vaccines. Cold exposure (CE) therapy, a noninvasive and straightforward antitumor method, not only suppresses tumor metabolism but also ameliorates the immunosuppressive tumor milieu. In this study, we developed personalized TV using copper single-atom nanozyme (Cu SAZ) and enhanced their long-term antitumor efficacy by introducing CE. We initially synthesized the Cu SAZ via high-temperature carbonization, which demonstrated robust POD activity and photothermal characteristics. Upon exposure to 808 nm laser irradiation, the nanozyme generated reactive oxygen species (ROS) and heat, inducing immunogenic cell death in 4T1 breast cancer cells or CT26 colon cancer cells and facilitating TV production. In our in vivo tumor prevention and treatment model, we noted that CE significantly boosted the efficacy of the TV. The primary mechanism involves CE's ability to lower the ratio of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), decrease glucose metabolism in tumor cells, and increase the proportions of CD8+ T cells and memory T cells. Collectively, our findings offer promising avenues for designing innovative TV systems.",

STUDY DESIGN: Narrative systematic review. METHODS: Keyword-structured searches were performed in CINAHL, Emcare, Medline, SocINDEX, Scopus, OpenGrey, Social Policy and Practice and Web of Science, and supplemented by grey literature searches in a selection of other databases, from 1973 to 2024. Articles were double-screened on title/abstract and full text. Extracted data included information on study setting and population, health risks from cold exposure, intervention characteristics and effect sizes where reported. Studies were critically appraised using Joanna Briggs Institute checklists. RESULTS: 24 studies were included, predominantly from the UK and US. People sleeping rough were found to be at greater risk than the general population of mortality due to hypothermia, and of hypothermic injury. Studies assessing health service utilisation indicated higher than population average admission rates due to cold exposure among PEH. Studies on interventions to reduce health risks from cold exposure in these populations all addressed multi-component programmes including shelter provision as a central component. Evidence of effectiveness was very limited. CONCLUSION: PEH are at greater risk of death from hypothermia, and of hypothermic injury due to cold exposure than the general population. The use of overnight shelters and severe weather emergency plans are established approaches in high income settings for reducing risks from cold exposure among those sleeping rough, but further evidence on effectiveness is needed.",

Chronic cold exposure is shown to prolong lifespan in diseased mice, enhance liver health, and suppress the development of aggressive HCC, preventing hepatocellular hypertrophy, high-grade oval cell hyperplasia, liver steatosis, and aberrant hepatocyte hyperproliferation. Mechanistically, exposure to cold temperatures reinstates NAD+ levels in the HCC mouse models that originally exhibited low NAD+ levels, a contributing process to the development of liver tumors. These findings uncover the role of cold therapy to attenuate HCC development and potentially other existing malignancies involving NAD+ modulation."

      "abstract": "Cold exposure (CE) therapy can quickly induce tumor starvation by brown adipose tissue (BAT) thermogenesis. Exploring the combined antitumor mechanism of CE and traditional therapies (such as radiotherapy (RT)) is exciting and promising. In this study, we investigated the effect of CE in combination with nitric oxide (NO) gas therapy on sensitizing tumors to RT and promoting tumor radio-immunotherapy. We first constructed a liposome (SL) loaded with the NO prodrug S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine (SNAP). When SL is injected, the glutathione (GSH) within the tumor region promotes the release of NO from SNAP. Subsequently, the superoxide anion produced by RT reacts with NO to generate peroxynitrite (ONOO-), which has strong oxidative properties and induces cell death. Meanwhile, the mice were exposed to a CE environment of 4 °C. CE-mediated BAT thermogenesis induced tumor starvation, which led to a decrease in ATP and GSH content within the tumor as well as an improvement in the hypoxic microenvironment and a decrease in myeloid-derived suppressor cells. All of the above have promoted the effectiveness of RT and activated the systemic antitumor immunity. In the bilateral tumor experiment, treatment of the primary tumor inhibited the growth of the distant tumor and promoted the infiltration of CD8+ T cells into the tumor. These findings reveal that the synergy of CE, NO gas therapy, and RT could confer high effective anticancer effects, providing possibilities in personalized cancer treatment.",

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: Anecdotal reports have praised the benefits of cold exposure, exemplified by activities like winter swimming and cold water immersion. Cold exposure has garnered acclaim for its potential to confer benefits and potentially alleviate diabetes. We posited that systemic cold temperature (CT, 4-8°C) likely influences the organism's blood components through ambient temperature, prompting our investigation into the effects of chronic cold exposure on type 2 diabetic (T2DM) mice and our initial exploration of how cold exposure mitigates the incidence of T2DM. METHODS: The effects of CT (4-8°C) or room temperature (RT, 22-25°C) on T2DM mice were investigated. Mice blood and organ specimens were collected for fully automated biochemical testing, ELISA, HE staining, immunohistochemistry, and immunofluorescence. Glucose uptake was assessed using flow cytometry with 2-NBDG. Changes in potential signaling pathways such as protein kinase B (AKT), phosphorylated AKT (p-AKT), insulin receptor substrates 1 (IRS1), and phosphorylated IRS1 (p-IRS1) were evaluated by Western blot. RESULTS: CT or CT mice plasma-derived extracellular vesicles (CT-EVs) remarkably reduced blood glucose levels and improved insulin sensitivity in T2DM mice. This treatment enhanced glucose metabolism, systemic insulin sensitivity, and insulin secretion function while promoting glycogen accumulation in the liver and muscle. Additionally, CT-EVs treatment protected against the streptozocin (STZ)-induced destruction of islets in T2DM mice by inhibiting β-cell apoptosis. CT-EVs also shielded islets from destruction and increased the expression of p-IRS1 and p-AKT in adipocytes and hepatocytes. In vitro experiments further confirmed its pro-insulin sensitivity effect. CONCLUSION: Our data indicate that cold exposure may have a potentially beneficial effect on the development of T2DM, mainly through the anti-diabetic effect of plasma-derived EVs released during cold stimulation. This phenomenon could significantly contribute to understanding the lower prevalence of diabetes in colder regions.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: This study investigates the impact of cryolipolysis on reducing localized fat and altering plasma lipid profiles in 30 overweight and obese women. Conducted at the Health Technology Laboratory of the Evangelical University of Goiás, this clinical research adhered to stringent ethical guidelines. METHODS: Participants underwent three cryolipolysis sessions, with comprehensive assessments of body composition and plasma lipids performed pre- and post-intervention. RESULTS: Significant findings include a reduction in abdominal fat mass by an average of 4.1 kg and a decrease in BMI by 0.7 points (p < 0.05). Notably, total cholesterol levels decreased by an average of 15.7 mg/dL, and LDL cholesterol saw a reduction of 10.2 mg/dL (p < 0.01), with no significant changes in HDL cholesterol or triglyceride levels. These results suggest that cryolipolysis, in conjunction with standardized dietary control, offers a non-invasive alternative to surgical fat reduction, potentially mitigating cardiovascular risks associated with obesity. CONCLUSIONS: The study confirms the efficacy of cryolipolysis in targeted fat reduction and underscores its role in improving key cardiovascular risk factors. These findings warrant further exploration into the long-term benefits of cryolipolysis in metabolic health management and not only for aesthetic treatments."

The effects of cold exposure, hypoxia, and fatigue on pistol marksmanship and target engagement decision making in trained marksmen. J Strength Cond Res 38(11): e686-e694, 2024-This study aimed to examine the effects of cold exposure, hypoxia, and fatigue on pistol marksmanship and target engagement in trained marksmen. Twelve healthy subjects (mean ± SD age: 28.8 ± 4.0 years) performed 3 testing visits under normal/normoxic [Norm 21 ] (24° C; 21% FiO 2 ), cold/normoxic [Cold 21 ] (10° C; 21% FiO 2 ), and cold/hypoxic [Cold 14 ] (10° C; FiO 2 : 14.3) conditions. Pistol marksmanship and target engagement were assessed through draw time (DT) and shoot-no-shoot (SNS) courses of fire. The 2 protocols were performed before (T preF ) and immediately after (T postF ) a sandbag deadlift fatiguing protocol. Significance was set at p < 0.05. Significant condition × time interactions ( p = 0.01-0.03) were found for accuracy SNS (SNS acc ), misses SNS (SNS miss ), and total shots SNS (SNS tot ). Follow-up analyses indicated that SNS acc increased by 14.3% ( p = 0.03), SNS miss decreased by 34.7% ( p = 0.02), and SNS tot decreased by 10.6% ( p = 0.04) from T preF to T postF during the Cold 21 condition alone. No significance was found for these in the Norm 21 ( p = 0.08-0.22) or Cold 14 ( p = 0.18-0.47) conditions. Total time (SNS T ) to completion of the SNS ( p = 0.09) and DT ( p = 0.14) showed no significance across time or condition. Significant difference across time for Cold 14 ( p = 0.03-0.02) for reaction time was found. Exercise likely resulted in increased thermogenesis that improved tactically relevant motor skills including SNS acc , decreased SNS miss , and SNS tot in Cold 21 , but not Cold 14 . The additive effect of hypoxia coupled with exercise in the Cold 14 condition did not improve tactical performance, suggesting multi-stressor environments result in competing physiological responses. Tactical strength and conditioning specialists as well as operators should aim to improve thermoregulation during Cold 21 conditions, with exercise as a possible intervention.",

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: Exposure to cold temperatures decreases finger temperature (Tfing) and dexterity. Decreased manual function and dexterity can be serious safety risks, especially in tasks that require fine motor movements that must be performed outdoors. The aim of this study was to determine whether hand heating with a minimal power requirement (14.8 W) results in a smaller reduction in Tfing and manual dexterity performance during mild cold exposure compared to a non-heated control condition. METHODS: In a randomized crossover design, twenty-two healthy participants were exposed to a moderately cold environment (5  ºC) for 90 min. One condition had no intervention (CON), while the other had the palmar and dorsal hands heated (HEAT) by using electric heating films. Tfing and cutaneous vascular conductance (CVC) were continuously monitored using laser Doppler flowmetry. Manual dexterity performance and cognitive function were assessed by the Grooved Pegboard Test (GPT) and Stroop Color-Word (SCW) test, respectively, during the baseline period and every 30 min during the cold exposure. RESULTS: After the cold exposure, Tfing was higher in HEAT relative to CON (CON 9.8 vs. HEAT 13.7 ºC, p < 0.0001). GPT placing time, as an index of dexterity performance, was also shorter in HEAT by 14.5% (CON 69.10 ± 13.08 vs. HEAT 59.06 ± 7.99 s, p < 0.0001). There was no difference in CVC between the two conditions during the cold exposure (p > 0.05 for all). Cognitive function was similar between two conditions (p > 0.05 for all). CONCLUSION: The proposed hand heating method offers a practical means of heating fingers to maintain dexterity throughout prolonged cold exposure.",

      "abstract": "Bumble bees are common in cooler climates and many species likely experience periodic exposure to very cold temperatures, but little is known about the temporal dynamics of cold response mechanisms following chill exposure, especially how persistent effects of cold exposure may facilitate tolerance of future events. To investigate molecular processes involved in the temporal response by bumble bees to acute cold exposure, we compared mRNA transcript abundance in Bombus impatiens workers exposed to 0°C for 75 min (inducing chill coma) and control bees maintained at a constant ambient temperature (28°C). We sequenced the 3' end of mRNA transcripts (TagSeq) to quantify gene expression in thoracic tissue of bees at several time points (0, 10, 30, 120 and 720 min) following cold exposure. Significant differences from control bees were only detectable within 30 min after the treatment, with most occurring at the 10 min recovery time point. Genes associated with gluconeogenesis and glycolysis were most notably upregulated, while genes related to lipid and purine metabolism were downregulated. The observed patterns of expression indicate a rapid recovery after chill coma, suggesting an acute differential transcriptional response during recovery from chill coma and return to baseline expression levels within an hour, with no long-term gene expression markers of this cold exposure. Our work highlights the functions and pathways important for acute cold recovery, provides an estimated time frame for recovery from cold exposure in bumble bees, and suggests that cold hardening may be less important for these heterothermic insects.",

OBJECTIVES: To investigate the effects of the Wim Hof Method (WHM), with (WHM-C) and without cold exposure (WHM-NC), on mental and physical health in persons with chronic spinal cord injury (SCI). SETTING: Rehabilitation centre (assessments and once-weekly intervention sessions) and home-based (daily intervention sessions). METHODS: Sixty adults with chronic SCI will be randomised (1:1:1) to one of three groups: participants in the intervention groups (i.e., WHM-C and WHM-NC) will engage in a 7-week intervention, with one weekly practice session at the rehabilitation centre and a daily WHM session at home. WHM-NC will consist of breathing exercises and mindset, while participants in WHM-C will partake in breathing exercises, mindset and cold exposure. Participants allocated to usual care (UC) will not receive the WHM intervention. The primary outcome is mental health reported via the Mental Health Inventory (MHI)-5, while secondary outcomes include circulating inflammatory and metabolic marker concentration, pulmonary function, body composition, sleep quality, spasticity, chronic pain and psychological stress. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethics approval has been obtained from the medical ethics committee of the Máxima Medical Centre (Veldhoven, the Netherlands; identifier: w22.069). If shown efficacious in improving mental health, as well as physical health, in persons with chronic SCI, the low cost and accessibility of the WHM allows it to be directly implemented in SCI rehabilitation.

However, the mechanisms of action underlying capsaicin and cold exposure in 1,2-dimethylhyrazine (DMH)-induced CRC remain unknown. Multiple assays were utilized in the present study, including methylene blue, hematoxylin eosin (H&E) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining, western blotting and Duolink proximity ligation assay (PLA), in order to assess the influence of capsaicin and cold exposure on CRC rat models induced by DMH. The present study reported that capsaicin and cold exposure treatment significantly increased the size and number of colonic tumors, and the CRC metastasis rate in the capsaicin and cold exposure groups was higher than that in DMH model group.Moreover, it was observed that capsaicin and cold exposure increased mRNA and protein expression levels of LAMC2 and integrin-β1 induced by DMH. Duolink PLA results indicated that cold exposure and capsaicin significantly promoted interaction formation between LAMC2 and ITGB1 in CRC rats induced by DMH. Furthermore, western blot and IHC analysis confirmed that cold exposure and capsaicin inhibited DMH-induced decreases in the expression levels of E-cadherin, and increases in the expression levels of p-FAK, Snails, Fibronectin and N-cadherin. In addition, the serum levels of IL-1β and IL-6 in capsaicin and cold exposure group were higher than those of model group. In conclusion, our study suggests that both capsaicin and cold exposure may contribute to EMT-mediated the formation of premetastatic niche, which may lead to CRC metastasis by activating the early interaction between LAMC2 and integrin-β1."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Cold exposure (CE) before birth is one of the initial stressors that may impact mammalian pregnancy, changing placental and fetal development and affecting the health of the offspring. While glucocorticoids (GCs) participate in the body's response to the stress of CE, the specific mechanisms of their action are unclear. This study aims to determine the effect of CE stress on the placenta and to test whether stress, caused by cold exposure in pregnancy impairs fetal development by changing placental angiogenesis via excessive GC expression. MATERIALS AND METHODS: CE rat model was created by exposing 30 SD rats to cold preconception, or during the first, second, and third weeks of pregnancy. Serum cortisol and soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 (sFlt-1) expression levels, physiological index changes (food intake, body weight change and blood pressure), and pregnancy outcomes (fetal rat weight, number of live fetal rats, and placental weight) were collected at baseline and at different time points after the conception. Protein expression levels of 11 β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 2 (11β-HSD2), glucocorticoid receptor, vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A), placental growth factor (PIGF), and sFlt-1 in placental tissues were measured by western blotting. Cytokeratin (CK) and laminin (LN) in trophoblasts, and α-actin in vascular smooth muscle of the spiral arteries of pregnant rats after the systemic cold treatment were assessed by immunofluorescence and visualized by fluorescent microscopy. To test the effect of 11β-HSD2 levels on the placental recasting, human first-trimester extravillous trophoblast cells (HTR8/SVneo) underwent knockdown using specific 11β-HSD2 siRNA constructs.  Expression levels of 11β-HSD2 were analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) and into HTR8 cells, and the expression levels of the 11β-HSD2 gene in each group were measured using qPCR. Cell migration and invasion was assessed by Transwell migration assay, and sFlt-1 levels in HTR8 cells were measured by ELISA. RESULTS: CE pre-conception led to consistently increasing serum corticosterone and sFlt-1 levels throughout pregnancy, and persistently increased diastolic blood pressure (DBP) in rat CE model compared to control animals. CE during the second week of gestation (Gp.3) was associated with significantly lower placental weight (p=0.0003). Cold exposure in the third week (Gp.4) was associated with significantly (p=0.001) lower fetal weight. CE pre-conception was associated with significantly decreased placental levels of 11β-HSD2, glucocorticoid receptor, VEGF-A, PIGF, and sFlt-1 proteins and α-actin compared to the control group. Silencing 11β-HSD2 by siRNA led to reduced cell migrations and invasion, and markedly increased expression levels of sFlt-1 in HTR8/SVneo cells (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Pre-conception cold exposure and during early pregnancy leads to increased GCs levels and impaired placental 11β-HSD2 activity. We suggest that the subsequent 11β-HSD2-induced increase in the sFlt-1expression during early pregnancy may affect placental vascular remodeling and change placental morphological structure and function.",

      "abstract": "Interorgan crosstalk via secreted hormones and metabolites is a fundamental aspect of mammalian metabolic physiology. Beyond the highly specialized endocrine cells, peripheral tissues are emerging as an important source of metabolic hormones that influence energy and nutrient metabolism and contribute to disease pathogenesis. Neuregulin 4 (Nrg4) is a fat-derived hormone that protects mice from nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and NASH-associated liver cancer by shaping hepatic lipid metabolism and the liver immune microenvironment. Despite its enriched expression in brown fat, whether NRG4 plays a role in thermogenic response and mediates the metabolic benefits of cold exposure are areas that remain unexplored. Here we show that Nrg4 expression in inguinal white adipose tissue (iWAT) is highly responsive to chronic cold exposure. Nrg4 deficiency impairs beige fat induction and renders mice more susceptible to diet-induced metabolic disorders under mild cold conditions. Using mice with adipocyte and hepatocyte-specific Nrg4 deletion, we reveal that adipose tissue-derived NRG4, but not hepatic NRG4, is essential for beige fat induction following cold acclimation. Furthermore, treatment with recombinant NRG4-Fc fusion protein promotes beige fat induction in iWAT and improves metabolic health in mice with diet-induced obesity. These findings highlight a critical role of NRG4 in mediating beige fat induction and preserving metabolic health under mild cold conditions.",

This study investigated the effects of palmitoleic acid (C16:1n-7; PA) supplementation on growth performance, body temperature, fatty acid (FA), and energy metabolism in milk-replacer-fed piglets. Forty-eight piglets were stratified by body weight and randomly assigned to one of four dietary treatments (0%, 1%, 2%, and 3% PA supplementation as a percent of milk replacer) and given the diet through an orogastric tube. They were fed dietary treatments every 2 h for 4 d in the first week postpartum and all were sacrificed at the end of the experiment. The piglets were weighed daily, and half in each dietary treatment group, the same piglets each day, were exposed daily to a lower temperature for 2 h. Plasma samples were collected immediately before sacrifice for analyses of FA and other plasma metabolites. The weight of organs and empty body weight were determined after sacrifice. Liver and semimembranosus muscle tissue samples were collected and analyzed for FA content. Contents of C16:1n-7 and C18:1n-7 in both plasma and liver (P < 0.001), and C16:1n-7 in semimembranosus muscle (P < 0.001) increased linearly as PA supplementation increased. Most plasma FA levels (except C16:1n-7, C16:1n-9, and C22:5n-3) were lower in piglets exposed to lower temperatures than those that were not. Plasma glucose, triglycerides, and lactate dehydrogenase levels increased linearly with PA supplementation (P < 0.001). Piglets' average daily gain, liver glycogen pool, liver weight, and gallbladder weight increased linearly (P < 0.05, P < 0.01, P < 0.05, and P < 0.001, respectively), but lung weight, liver nitrogen content, and body temperature drop decreased linearly (P < 0.01, P < 0.001, and P < 0.05, respectively) with PA supplementation. Piglets exposed to low temperature had greater liver nitrogen (P < 0.05) and lactate dehydrogenase (P < 0.001) contents but had lower liver weight (P < 0.01) and plasma lactate concentration (P < 0.05) than those that were not. In conclusion, this study demonstrated the importance of PA on the growth performance of the piglets by increasing their average daily gain and decreasing a drop in body temperature upon cold exposure, most likely due to a modified energy metabolism.",

      "abstract": "Brown adipose tissue (BAT) exhibits remarkable morphological and functional plasticity in response to environmental (e.g., cold exposure) and nutrient (e.g., high-fat diet) stimuli. Notably, a number of studies have showed that acetate, the main fermentation product of dietary fiber in gut, profoundly influences the differentiation and activity of BAT. However, the potential synergic or antagonistic effects of acetate and cold exposure on BAT have not been well examined. In the present study, the C57BL/6J mice were treated with acetate at the systemic level before a short period of cold exposure. Physiological parameters including body weight, blood glucose, and Respiratory Exchange Ratio (RER) were monitored, and thermal imaging of body surface temperature was captured. Moreover, the transcriptome profiles of interscapular BAT were also determined and analyzed afterwards. The obtained results showed that acetate treatment prior to cold exposure could alter the gene expression profile, as evidenced by significant differential clusters between the two groups. GO analysis and KEGG analysis further identified differentially expressed genes being mainly enriched for a number of biological terms and pathways related to lipid metabolism and brown adipose activity such as \"G-protein-coupled receptor activity\", \"cAMP metabolic process\", \"PPAR signaling pathway\", and \"FoxO signaling pathway\". GSEA analysis further suggested that activation status of key pathways including \"PPAR signaling pathway\" and \"TCA cycle\" were altered upon acetate treatment. Taken together, our study identified the potential synergistic effect of acetic acid with cold exposure on BAT, which highlighted the positive dietary and therapeutic aspects of acetate."

Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists, such as Exendin-4, have emerged as potential treatments for type 2 diabetes and obesity. However, current administration methods face challenges with patient adherence and low oral bioavailability. To address these limitations, researchers are exploring improved oral delivery methods for Exendin-4, including utilizing AMTs. This study engineered the probiotic yeast Saccharomyces boulardii to produce Exendin-4 (Sb-Exe4) in the gastrointestinal tract of male C57BL/6 mice to combat diet-induced obesity. The biological efficiency of Exendin-4 secreted by S. boulardii was analyzed ex vivo on isolated pancreatic islets, demonstrating induced insulin secretion. The in vivo characterization of Sb-Exe4 revealed that when combined with cold exposure (8 °C), the Sb-Exe4 yeast strain successfully suppressed appetite by 25% and promoted a 4-fold higher weight loss. This proof of concept highlights the potential of AMTs to genetically modify S. boulardii for delivering active therapeutic peptides in a precise and targeted manner. Although challenges in efficacy and regulatory approval persist, AMTs may provide a transformative platform for personalized medicine. Further research in AMTs, particularly focusing on probiotic yeasts such as S. boulardii, holds great potential for novel therapeutic possibilities and enhancing treatment outcomes in diverse metabolic disorders.",

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Materials and methods: In the study, 40 immature female rats of the WAG population at the age of 27 days with a body weight of 80-90 g were used. Five groups were formed (8 animals in each group). Group 1 was represented by intact rats that were not subjected to any manipulations. Group 2 was represented by rats that were injected subcutaneously with 0.2 ml of purified and sterilized olive oil daily for 25 days. Group 3 was represented by rats that were exposed to intermittent cold for 25 days. Group 4 was represented by rats that were modeled with PCOS. Group 5 was represented by rats, which were simulated PCOS against the background of intermittent cold exposure. ROS production was estimated in leukocytes isolated from rats of all groups by flow cytometry using the fluorescent probe of 2,7-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (H2DCFDA). RESULTS: Results: The experimental study revealed an intracellular excessive production of ROS by leukocytes in rats with polycystic ovary syndrome. The use of inter¬mittent cold exposure normalized the production of reactive oxygen species by leukocytes in rats with polycystic ovary syndrome. CONCLUSION: Conclusions: The effectiveness of intermittent cold exposure, proven by the authors, allows recommending its use as one of the methods of prevention and treatment of the polycystic ovary syndrome.",

The intestinal environment is complex and variable, and direct contact with the external environment can easily cause stress, damage and even lead to diseases such as diarrhea. AIMS: This study aimed to reveal the role of cold exposure on ileum damage and the role of SIRT2 in this process. MAIN METHODS: C57BL6 mice and SIRT2 knockout mice were used to construct a chronic cold exposure model (21 days, random 4 °C exposure for 3 h per day), which was tested by various methods, including intestinal permeability assays, morphological assays, ultrastructural assays, western blotting, and fluorescence staining. In vitro assays were performed on the mouse small intestinal epithelial cell line MODE-K to investigate the role of endoplasmic reticulum stress, SIRT2 knockout, and autophagy on tight junctions. KEY FINDINGS: The results showed that chronic cold exposure damaged the ileal epithelial barrier, with endoplasmic reticulum stress. Knockout of SIRT2 alleviates ileal injury via enhanced autophagy under cold exposure. And autophagy can restore the expression of ZO-1 under stress. SIGNIFICANCE: This study can provide potential target and basic data for the treatment of IBD and other disorders of the intestinal barrier. Autophagy may be an important means of restoring damage to the intestinal barrier.",

      "abstract": "Medial arterial calcification (MAC), a systemic vascular disease different from atherosclerosis, is associated with an increased incidence of cardiovascular events. Several studies have demonstrated that ambient temperature is one of the most important factors affecting cardiovascular events. However, there has been limited research on the effect of different ambient temperatures on MAC. In the present study, we showed that cold temperature exposure (CT) in mice slowed down the formation of vitamin D (VD)-induced vascular calcification compared with room temperature exposure (RT). To investigate the mechanism involved, we isolated plasma-derived exosomes from mice subjected to CT or RT for 30 days (CT-Exo or RT-Exo, respectively). Compared with RT-Exo, CT-Exo remarkably alleviated the calcification/senescence formation of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) and promoted autophagy by activating the phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase (p-AMPK) and inhibiting phosphorylation of mammalian target of rapamycin (p-mTOR). At the same time, CT-Exo promoted autophagy in β-glycerophosphate (β-GP)-induced VSMCs. The number of autophagosomes and the expression of autophagy-related proteins ATG5 and LC3B increased, while the expression of p62 decreased. Based on a microRNA chip microarray assay and real-time polymerase chain reaction, miR-320a-3p was highly enriched in CT-Exo as well as thoracic aortic vessels in CT mice. miR-320a-3p downregulation in CT-Exo using AntagomiR-320a-3p inhibited autophagy and blunted its anti-calcification protective effect on VSMCs. Moreover, we identified that programmed cell death 4 (PDCD4) is a target of miR-320a-3p, and silencing PDCD4 increased autophagy and decreased calcification in VSMCs. Treatment with CT-Exo alleviated the formation of MAC in VD-treated mice, while these effects were partially reversed by GW4869. Furthermore, the anti-arterial calcification protective effects of CT-Exo were largely abolished by AntagomiR-320a-3p in VD-induced mice. In summary, we have highlighted that prolonged cold may be a good way to reduce the incidence of MAC. Specifically, miR-320a-3p from CT-Exo could protect against the initiation and progression of MAC via the AMPK/mTOR autophagy pathway.",

      "abstract": "The honeybees are the most important pollinator in the production of crops and fresh produce. Temperature affects the survival of honeybees, and determines the quality of their development, which is of great significance for beekeeping production. Yet, little was known about how does low temperature stress during development stage cause bee death and any sub-lethal effect on subsequent. Early pupal stage is the most sensitive stage to low temperature in pupal stage. In this study, early pupal broods were exposed to 20°C for 12, 16, 24, and 48 h, followed by incubation at 35°C until emergence. We found that 48 h of low temperature duration cause 70% of individual bees to die. Although the mortality at 12 and 16 h seems not very high, the association learning ability of the surviving individuals was greatly affected. The brain slices of honeybees showed that low temperature treatment could cause the brain development of honeybees to almost stop. Gene expression profiles between low temperature treatment groups (T24, T48) and the control revealed that 1,267 and 1,174 genes were differentially expressed respectively. Functional enrichment analysis of differentially expressed genes showed that the differential expression of Map3k9, Dhrs4, and Sod-2 genes on MAPK and peroxisome signaling pathway caused oxidative damage to the honeybee head. On the FoxO signal pathway, InsR and FoxO were upregulated, and JNK, Akt, and Bsk were downregulated; and on the insect hormone synthesis signal pathway, Phm and Spo genes were downregulated. Therefore, we speculate that low temperature stress affects hormone regulation. It was detected that the pathways related to the nervous system were Cholinergic synapse, Dopaminergic synapse, GABAergic synapse, Glutamatergic synapse, Serotonergic synapse, Neurotrophin signaling pathway, and Synaptic vesicle cycle. This implies that the synaptic development of honeybees is quite possibly greatly affected by low temperature stress. Understanding how low temperature stress affects the physiology of bee brain development and how it affects bee behavior provide a theoretical foundation for a deeper comprehension of the temperature adaptation mechanism that underlies the \"stenothermic\" development of social insects, and help to improve honeybee management strategies to ensure the healthy of colony."

However, the regulatory mechanism remains unclear partially due to a lack of comprehensive knowledge of the signaling molecules involved. Herein, we performed region-resolvable quantitative profiling of the brain peptidome using cold-exposed mouse models and interrogated the interaction between gut microbes and brain peptides in response to cold. Region-specific alterations in the brain peptidome were observed during chronic cold exposure and were correlated with gut microbiome composition. Several proSAAS-derived peptides exhibited a positive correlation with Lactobacillus. The hypothalamus-pituitary axis exhibited a sensitive response to cold exposure. We obtained a candidate pool of bioactive peptides that potentially participate in the regulation of cold-induced energy homeostasis. Intervention with cold-adapted microbiota in mice decreased the abundance of hypothalamic neurokinin B and subsequently contributed to shifting the fuel source for energy consumption from lipids to glucose. Collectively, this study demonstrated that gut microbes modulate brain peptides contributing to energy metabolism, providing a data resource for understanding the regulatory mechanism of energy homeostasis upon cold exposure.",

      "abstract": "Glycerol is a key metabolite for lipid accumulation in insulin-sensitive tissues. We examined the role of aquaporin-7 (AQP7), the main glycerol channel in adipocytes, in the improvement of brown adipose tissue (BAT) whitening, a process whereby brown adipocytes differentiate into white-like unilocular cells, after cold exposure or bariatric surgery in male Wistar rats with diet-induced obesity (DIO) (n = 229). DIO promoted BAT whitening, evidenced by increased BAT hypertrophy, steatosis and upregulation of the lipogenic factors Pparg2, Mogat2 and Dgat1. AQP7 was detected in BAT capillary endothelial cells and brown adipocytes, and its expression was upregulated by DIO. Interestingly, AQP7 gene and protein expressions were downregulated after cold exposure (4 °C) for 1 week or one month after sleeve gastrectomy in parallel to the improvement of BAT whitening. Moreover, Aqp7 mRNA expression was positively associated with transcripts of the lipogenic factors Pparg2, Mogat2 and Dgat1 and regulated by lipogenic (ghrelin) and lipolytic (isoproterenol and leptin) signals. Together, the upregulation of AQP7 in DIO might contribute to glycerol influx used for triacylglycerol synthesis in brown adipocytes, and hence, BAT whitening. This process is reversible by cold exposure and bariatric surgery, thereby suggesting the potential of targeting BAT AQP7 as an anti-obesity therapy.",

      "abstract": "Cardiac function depends mainly on mitochondrial metabolism. Cold conditions increase the risk of cardiovascular diseases by increasing blood pressure. Adaptive thermogenesis leads to increased mitochondrial biogenesis and function in skeletal muscles and adipocytes. Here, we studied the effect of acute cold exposure on cardiac mitochondrial function and its regulation by sirtuins. Significant increase in mitochondrial DNA copy number as measured by the ratio between mitochondrial-coded COX-II and nuclear-coded cyclophilin A gene expression by qRT-PCR and increase in the expression of PGC-1α, a mitochondriogenic factor and its downstream target NRF-1 were observed on cold exposure. This was associated with an increase in the activity of SIRT-1, which is known to activate PGC-1α. Mitochondrial SIRT-3 was also upregulated. Increase in sirtuin activity was reflected in total protein acetylome, which decreased in cold-exposed cardiac tissue. An increase in mitochondrial MnSOD further indicated enhanced mitochondrial function. Further evidence for this was obtained from ex vivo studies of cardiac tissue treated with norepinephrine, which caused a significant increase in mitochondrial MnSOD and SIRT-3. SIRT-3 appears to mediate the regulation of MnSOD, as treatment with AGK-7, a SIRT-3 inhibitor reversed the norepinephrine-induced upregulation of MnSOD. It, therefore, appears that SIRT-3 activation in response to SIRT-1-PGC-1α activation contributes to the regulation of cardiac mitochondrial activity during acute cold exposure.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: In addition to its contractile properties and role in movement, skeletal muscle plays an important function in regulating whole-body glucose and lipid metabolism. A central component of such regulation is mitochondria, whose quality and function are essential in maintaining proper metabolic homeostasis, with defects in processes such as autophagy and mitophagy involved in mitochondria quality control impairing skeletal muscle mass and function, and potentially leading to a number of associated diseases. Cold exposure has been reported to markedly induce metabolic remodeling and enhance insulin sensitivity in the whole body by regulating mitochondrial biogenesis. However, changes in lipid metabolism and lipidomic profiles in skeletal muscle in response to cold exposure are unclear. Here, we generated lipidomic or transcriptome profiles of mouse skeletal muscle following cold induction, to dissect the molecular mechanisms regulating lipid metabolism upon acute cold treatment. RESULTS: Our results indicated that short-term cold exposure (3 days) can lead to a significant increase in intramuscular fat deposition. Lipidomic analyses revealed that a cold challenge altered the overall lipid composition by increasing the content of triglyceride (TG), lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC), and lysophosphatidylethanolamine (LPE), while decreasing sphingomyelin (SM), validating lipid remodeling during the cold environment. In addition, RNA-seq and qPCR analysis showed that cold exposure promoted the expression of genes related to lipolysis and fatty acid biosynthesis. These marked changes in metabolic effects were associated with mitophagy and muscle signaling pathways, which were accompanied by increased TG deposition and impaired fatty acid oxidation. Mechanistically, HIF-1α signaling was highly activated in response to the cold challenge, which may contribute to intramuscular fat deposition and enhanced mitophagy in a cold environment. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, our data revealed the adaptive changes of skeletal muscle associated with lipidomic and transcriptomic profiles upon cold exposure. We described the significant alterations in the composition of specific lipid species and expression of genes involved in glucose and fatty acid metabolism. Cold-mediated mitophagy may play a critical role in modulating lipid metabolism in skeletal muscle, which is precisely regulated by HIF-1α signaling.",

Here, we investigate whether mesenteric artery (MA) EnNaC is involved in cold exposure-induced hypertension (CIH) and identify the underlying mechanisms in SD rats. Methods: One group of rats was housed at room temperature and served as control. Three groups of rats were kept in a 4°C cold incubator for 10 h/day; among which two groups were administrated with either benzamil (EnNaC blocker) or eplerenone (mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist, MR). Blood pressure (BP), vasodilatation, and endothelial function were measured with tail-cuff plethysmography, isometric myograph, and Total Nitric Oxide (NO) Assay kit, respectively. A cell-attached patch-clamp technique, in split-open MA, was used to determine the role of EnNaC in CIH rats. Furthermore, the plasma aldosterone levels were detected using an ELISA kit; and Western blot analysis was used to examine the relative expression levels of Sgk1 and Nedd4-2 proteins in the MA of SD rats. Results: We demonstrated that cold exposure increased BP, impaired vasodilatation, and caused endothelial dysfunction in rats. The activity of EnNaC significantly increased, concomitant with an increased level of plasma aldosterone and activation of Sgk1/Nedd4-2 signaling. Importantly, CIH was inhibited by either eplerenone or benzamil. It appeared that cold-induced decrease in NO production and impairment of endothelium-dependent relaxation (EDR) were significantly ameliorated by either eplerenone or benzamil in MA of CIH rats. Moreover, treatment of MAs with aldosterone resulted in an activation of EnNaC, a reduction of NO, and an impairment of EDR, which were significantly inhibited by either eplerenone or GSK650394 (Sgk1 inhibitor) or benzamil. Conclusion: Activation of EnNaC contributes to CIH; we suggest that pharmacological inhibition of the MR/Sgk1/Nedd4-2/EnNaC axis may be a potential therapeutic strategy for CIH."

An experiment involving four groups was conducted, yielding separate cells for breathing technique-only and cold exposure-only, as well as a combined treatment and a control group. Eighty-six individuals participated in the study. Perceived stress is measured employing the 10-item version of the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10) and the 20-item version of the Perceived Stress Questionnaire (PSQ). The instruments exhibit a substantial correlation (r = 0.842, p < 0.001). The combined group exhibited a medium to large positive effect on perceived stress compared to the control group. The breathing technique and cold exposure on their own were not found to yield substantial effects, indicating synergies between both exercises. Combinations of breathing techniques and cold exposure may be employed to decrease individuals' perceived stress."

      "abstract": "The main danger of cold stress to animals in cold regions is systemic metabolic changes and protein synthesis inhibition. RBM3, an exceptional cold shock protein, is rapidly upregulated in response to hypothermia to resist the adverse effects of cold stress. However, the mechanism of the protective effect and the rapid upregulation of RBM3 remains unclear. O-GlcNAcylation, an atypical O-glycosylation, is precisely regulated only by O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) and O-GlcNAcase (OGA) and participates in the signal transduction of multiple cellular stress responses as a \"stress and nutrition receptor.\" Therefore, our study aimed to explore the mechanism of RBM3 regulating glucose metabolism and promoting survival in skeletal muscle under acute cold exposure. Meanwhile, our study verifies whether O-GlcNAcylation mediated by OGT rapidly upregulates RBM3. The blood and skeletal muscle of mice were collected at the end of cold exposure treatment for 0, 2, and 4 h. Changes in levels of RBM3, AKT, glycolysis apoptosis, and OGT were measured. The results show that acute cold exposure upregulated RBM3, OGT, and AKT phosphorylation and increased energy consumption, which enhanced glycolysis and prevent apoptosis. In the 32 °C mild hypothermia model in vitro, overexpression of RBM3 enhanced AKT phosphorylation. Meanwhile, inactivation of AKT by wortmannin resulted in increased apoptosis and decreased glucose metabolism in skeletal muscle under acute cold exposure. In addition, OGT-mediated O-GlcNAcylation of p65 was confirmed in mouse myoblast cell line (C2C12) cells at mild hypothermia. O-GlcNAcylation level affected p65 activity and nuclear translocation. Compared with wild type (WT) mice, RBM3 and p65 phosphorylation were decreased in specific skeletal muscle Ogt (KO) mice, whereas AKT phosphorylation, glycolysis, and apoptosis were increased. Taken together, O-GlcNAcylation of p65 upregulates RBM3 to promote AKT phosphorylation, enhance glucose metabolism, and reduce apoptosis in skeletal muscle of mice under acute cold exposure.",

      "abstract": "The discovery of functional brown adipose tissue (BAT) in adult humans and the possibility to recruit beige cells with high thermogenic potential within white adipose tissue (WAT) depots opened the field for new strategies to combat obesity and its associated comorbidities. Exercise training as well as cold exposure and dietary components are associated with the enhanced accumulation of metabolically-active beige adipocytes and BAT activation. Both activated beige and brown adipocytes increase their metabolic rate by utilizing lipids to generate heat via non-shivering thermogenesis, which is dependent on uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) in the inner mitochondrial membrane. Non-shivering thermogenesis elevates energy expenditure and promotes a negative energy balance, which may ameliorate metabolic complications of obesity and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) such as insulin resistance (IR) in skeletal muscle and adipose tissue. Despite the recent advances in pharmacological approaches to reduce obesity and IR by inducing non-shivering thermogenesis in BAT and WAT, the administered pharmacological compounds are often associated with unwanted side effects. Therefore, lifestyle interventions such as exercise, cold exposure, and/or specified dietary regimens present promising anchor points for future disease prevention and treatment of obesity and T2DM. The exact mechanisms where exercise, cold exposure, dietary interventions, and pharmacological treatments converge or rather diverge in their specific impact on BAT activation or WAT browning are difficult to determine. In the past, many reviews have demonstrated the mechanistic principles of exercise- and/or cold-induced BAT activation and WAT browning. In this review, we aim to summarize not only the current state of knowledge on the various mechanistic principles of diverse external stimuli on BAT activation and WAT browning, but also present their translational potential in future clinical applications.",

Fourteen men were equally assigned to either the experimental (CA) or the control (CON) group. The CA group was immersed to the chest in 14°C water for ≤120 min daily over a 5-day period while the skin temperature of the right-hand fingers was clamped at ∼35.5°C. The CON group was instructed to avoid any cold exposure during this period. Before and after the intervention, both groups performed, on two different consecutive days, a local cold provocation trial consisting of a 30-min hand immersion in 8°C water while immersed to the chest once in 21°C (mild-hypothermic trial; 0.5°C fall in rectal temperature from individual preimmersion values) and on the other occasion in 35.5°C (normothermic trial). In the CA group, the cold-induced reduction in finger temperature was less (mild-hypothermic trial: P = 0.05; normothermic trial: P = 0.02), and the incidence of the cold-induced vasodilation episodes was greater (in normothermic trials: P = 0.04) in the post- than in the preacclimation trials. The right-hand thermal discomfort was also attenuated (mild-hypothermic trial: P = 0.04; normothermic trial: P = 0.01). The finger temperature responses of the CON group did not vary between testing periods. Our findings suggest that repetitive whole body exposure to severe cold within a week may attenuate finger vasoreactivity and thermosensitivity to localized cooling. These regional thermo-adaptions were ascribed to central neural habituation produced by the iterative, generalized cold stimulation.",

      "abstract": "The major reason of human morbidity and mortality is obesity and related diseases. Brown adipose tissue (BAT) is associated with low total adipose tissue content and a lower risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Studies have shown that exercise and cold expose may induce browning. In this study, we verified (1) whether exercise and/or cold exposure can improve the expression level of ucp4c, serca, ampkα, camkII, sirt1, octβ3r, and hamlet; (2) if these interventions can save cardiac dysfunction induced by a high-fat diet (HFD) in Drosophila. w1118 (wild-type) virgin female flies collected within 8 h after eclosion were divided into eight groups: the normal feed control group (NFD-C), the normal feed exercise group (NFD-E), the normal feed cold exposure group (NFD-CA), the normal feed exercise/cold exposure group (NFD-EC), the HFD control group (HFD-C), the HFD exercise group (HFD-E), the HFD cold exposure group (HFD-CA), and the HFD exercise/cold exposure group (HFD-EC). After exercise and/or cold exposure for 7 days, the mRNA expression levels of ucp4c, serca, ampkα, camk II, sirt1, octβ3r, and hamlet were tested by qRT-PCR, and m-mode was used to assess cardiac function. In addition, we assessed the triacylglycerol (TAG) levels, motor ability, fat mass (by Oil Red O [ORO] staining), and morphological features. The results of TAG, ORO staining, and morphological features all indicate that after interventions, body size of Drosophila was smaller compared with the control group, irrespective of the feeding patterns. The mRNA expression levels of ucp4c, serca, octβ3r, hamlet, ampkα, camkII, and sirt1 were changed to varying degrees under different intervention states (exercise and/or cold exposure). Cold exposure and exercise/cold exposure partly improved cardiac function and the normal fruit flies' cardiac function and exercise ability. However, after exercise intervention, exercise ability and heart function were improved in both HFD and normal-fat diet (NFD) fruit flies. In conclusion, different intervention states (exercise and/or cold exposure) can change the mRNA expression levels of ucp4c, serca, octβ3r, hamlet, ampkα, camkII, and sirt1. Exercise is the most effective way to restore HFD-induced cardiac dysfunction.",

      "abstract": "Cold exposure has been recognized as an important risk factor for hypertension, and altered gut microbiota has been reported to be associated with hypertension. We hypothesized that there is a plausible relationship between gut microbiota and cold-induced hypertension (CIH). Therefore, we explored the potential link between the gut microbiota and its metabolites with CIH. Male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were randomly divided into the normal temperature group (NT, 20 ± 2 °C) and the cold exposure group (CE, 4 ± 1 °C), and faecal bacteria cross-transplantation was performed after six weeks. We analyzed the gut microbiota of rats using the 16S rDNA sequence and measured the blood pressure of rats and the content of short-chain fatty acids in rat faeces. After six weeks of cold exposure, the CIH rat model was successfully established. The cold exposure reduced the diversity of the gut microbiota, increased the abundance of potentially pathogenic and conditionally pathogenic bacteria (e.g., Quinella, Rothia, and Senegalimassilia genera), and reduced the abundance of beneficial bacteria (e.g., Lactobacillus genus) and butyric acid-producing bacteria (e.g., Lachnospiraceae UCG-008 and Ruminococcaceae UCG-013 genera). Faecal bacteria cross-transplantation altered gut microbiota composition and regulated blood pressure levels. The NT group rats transplanted with CIH rats' faecal bacteria were enriched with certain conditional pathogenic bacteria such as Prevotellaceae UCG-003 genus. The CIH rats transplanted with faecal bacteria from the NT group rats were enriched with beneficial bacteria such as Bacteroides genus. In addition, we found a significant reduction in butyric acid levels in CIH rats, which may be related to the increase in blood pressure. In conclusion, CIH is associated with altered gut microbiota and reduced butyric acid. Our findings provide novel insights for the prevention and treatment of CIH by modulating the gut microbiota through supplementation of beneficial bacteria/butyrate.",

      "abstract": "Chloroplasts serve as cold priming hubs modulating the transcriptional response of Arabidopsis thaliana to a second cold stimulus for several days by postcold accumulation of thylakoid ascorbate peroxidases (tAPX). In an attempt to investigate cross-priming effects of cold on plant pathogen protection, we show here that such a single 24-h cold treatment at 4°C decreased the susceptibility of Arabidopsis to virulent Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000 but did not alter resistance against the avirulent P. syringae pv. tomato avRPM1 and P. syringae pv. tomato avrRPS4 strains or the effector-deficient P. syringae pv. tomato strain hrcC-. The effect of cold priming against P. syringae pv. tomato was active immediately after cold exposure and memorized for at least 5 days. The priming benefit was established independent of the immune regulator Enhanced Disease Susceptibility 1 (EDS1) or activation of the immune-related genes NHL10, FRK1, ICS1 and PR1 but required thylakoid-bound as well as stromal ascorbate peroxidase activities because the effect was absent or weak in corresponding knock-out-lines. Suppression of tAPX postcold regulation in a conditional-inducible tAPX-RNAi line led to increased bacterial growth numbers. This highlights that the plant immune system benefits from postcold regeneration of the protective chloroplast peroxidase system.[Formula: see text] Copyright © 2022 The Author(s).

      "abstract": "Cold exposure promotes fat oxidation and modulates the energy metabolism in adipose tissue through multiple mechanisms. However, it is still unclear about heat-generating capacity and lipid mobilization of different fat depots without functional mitochondrial uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1). In this study, we kept finishing pigs (lack a functional UCP1 gene) under cold (5-7°C) or room temperature (22-25°C) and determined the effects of overnight cold exposure on fatty acid composition and transcriptional profiles of subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) and visceral adipose tissue (VAT). And the plasma metabolomes of porcine was also studied by LC-MS-based untargeted metabolomics. We found that the saturated fatty acids (SFAs) content was decreased in SAT upon cold exposure. While in VAT, the relative content of lauric acid (C12:0), myristic acid (C14:0) and lignoceric acid (C24:0) were decreased without affecting total SFA content. RNA-seq results showed SAT possess active organic acid metabolism and energy mobilization upon cold exposure. Compared with SAT, cold-induced transcriptional changes were far less broad in VAT, and the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were mainly enriched in fat cell differentiation and cell proliferation. Moreover, we found that the contents of organic acids like creatine, acamprosate, DL-3-phenyllactic acid and taurine were increased in plasma upon overnight cold treatment, suggesting that cold exposure induced lipid and fatty acid metabolism in white adipose tissue (WAT) might be regulated by functions of organic acids. These results provide new insights into the effects of short-term cold exposure on lipid metabolism in adipose tissues without functional UCP1.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: We previously showed that a training intervention comprising a combination of meditation, exposure to cold, and breathing exercises enables voluntary activation of the sympathetic nervous system, reflected by profoundly increased plasma epinephrine levels, and subsequent attenuation of the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammatory response. Several elements of the intervention may contribute to these effects, namely, two different breathing exercises (either with or without prolonged breath retention) and exposure to cold. We determined the contribution of these different elements to the observed effects. METHODS: Forty healthy male volunteers were randomized to either a short or an extensive training in both breathing exercises by either the creator of the training intervention or an independent trainer. The primary outcome was plasma epinephrine levels. In a subsequent study, 48 healthy male volunteers were randomized to cold exposure training, training in the established optimal breathing exercise, a combination of both, or no training. These 48 participants were subsequently intravenously challenged with 2 ng/kg LPS. The primary outcome was plasma cytokine levels. RESULTS: Both breathing exercises were associated with an increase in plasma epinephrine levels, which did not vary as a function of length of training or the trainer (F(4,152) = 0.53, p = .71, and F(4,152) = 0.92, p = .46, respectively). In the second study, the breathing exercise also resulted in increased plasma epinephrine levels. Cold exposure training alone did not relevantly modulate the LPS-induced inflammatory response (F(8,37) = 0.60, p = .77), whereas the breathing exercise led to significantly enhanced anti-inflammatory and attenuated proinflammatory cytokine levels (F(8,37) = 3.80, p = .002). Cold exposure training significantly enhanced the immunomodulatory effects of the breathing exercise (F(8,37) = 2.57, p = .02). CONCLUSIONS: The combination of cold exposure training and a breathing exercise most potently attenuates the in vivo inflammatory response in healthy young males. Our study demonstrates that the immunomodulatory effects of the intervention can be reproduced in a standardized manner, thereby paving the way for clinical trials.Trial Registration:ClinicalTrials.gov identifiers: NCT02417155 and NCT03240497.",

      "abstract": "Therapeutic activation of thermogenic brown adipose tissue (BAT) may be feasible to prevent, or treat, cardiometabolic disease. However, rodents are commonly housed below thermoneutrality (~20 °C) which can modulate their metabolism and physiology including the hyperactivation of brown (BAT) and beige white adipose tissue. We housed animals at thermoneutrality from weaning to chronically supress BAT, mimic human physiology and explore the efficacy of chronic, mild cold exposure (20 °C) and β3-adrenoreceptor agonism (YM-178) under these conditions. Using metabolic phenotyping and exploratory proteomics we show that transfer from 28 °C to 20 °C drives weight gain and a 125% increase in subcutaneous fat mass, an effect not seen with YM-178 administration, thus suggesting a direct effect of a cool ambient temperature in promoting weight gain and further adiposity in obese rats. Following chronic suppression of BAT, uncoupling protein 1 mRNA was undetectable in the subcutaneous inguinal white adipose tissue (IWAT) in all groups. Using exploratory adipose tissue proteomics, we reveal novel gene ontology terms associated with cold-induced weight gain in BAT and IWAT whilst Reactome pathway analysis highlights the regulation of mitotic (i.e., G2/M transition) and metabolism of amino acids and derivatives pathways. Conversely, YM-178 had minimal metabolic-related effects but modified pathways involved in proteolysis (i.e., eukaryotic translation initiation) and RNA surveillance across both tissues. Taken together these findings are indicative of a novel mechanism whereby animals increase body weight and fat mass following chronic suppression of adaptive thermogenesis from weaning. In addition, treatment with a B3-adrenoreceptor agonist did not improve metabolic health in obese animals raised at thermoneutrality.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Maintaining a constant core body temperature is essential to homeothermic vertebrate survival. Adaptive thermogenesis in brown adipose tissue and skeletal muscle is the primary mechanism of adjustment to an external stimulus such as cold exposure. Recently, several reports have revealed that the liver can play a role as a metabolic hub during adaptive thermogenesis. In this study, we suggest that the liver plays a novel role in secreting thermogenic factors in adaptive thermogenesis. Bone morphogenetic protein 9 (BMP9) is a hepatokine that regulates many biological processes, including osteogenesis, chondrogenesis, hematopoiesis, and angiogenesis. Previously, BMP9 was suggested to affect preadipocyte proliferation and differentiation. However, the conditions and mechanisms underlying hepatic expression and secretion and adipose tissue browning of BMP9 remain largely unknown. In this study, we investigated the physiological conditions for secretion and the regulatory mechanism of hepatic Bmp9 expression and the molecular mechanism by which BMP9 induces thermogenic gene program activation in adipose tissue. Here, we also present the pharmacological effects of BMP9 on a high-fat-induced obese mouse model. METHODS: To investigate the adaptive thermogenic role of BMP9 in vivo, we challenged mice with cold temperature exposure for 3 weeks and then examined the BMP9 plasma concentration and hepatic expression level. The cellular mechanism of hepatic Bmp9 expression under cold exposure was explored through promoter analysis. To identify the role of BMP9 in the differentiation of brown and beige adipocytes, we treated pluripotent stem cells and inguinal white adipose tissue (iWAT)-derived stromal-vascular (SV) cells with BMP9, and brown adipogenesis was monitored by examining thermogenic gene expression and signaling pathways. Furthermore, to evaluate the effect of BMP9 on diet-induced obesity, changes in body composition and glucose tolerance were analyzed in mice administered recombinant BMP9 (rBMP9) for 8 weeks. RESULTS: Hepatic Bmp9 expression and plasma levels in mice were significantly increased after 3 weeks of cold exposure. Bmp9 mRNA expression in the liver was regulated by transcriptional activation induced by cAMP response-element binding protein (CREB) and CREB-binding protein (CBP) on the Bmp9 promoter. Treatment with BMP9 promoted the differentiation of multipotent stem cells and iWAT-derived SV cells into beige adipocytes, as indicated by the increased expression of brown adipocyte and mitochondrial biogenesis markers. Notably, activation of the mothers against decapentaplegic homolog 1 (Smad1) and p44/p42 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways was required for the induction of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator 1 alpha (PGC1α) expression in BMP9-induced differentiation of SVs into beige adipocytes. The administration of rBMP9 in vivo also induced browning markers in white adipose tissue. In high-fat diet-induced obese mice, rBMP9 administration conferred protection against obesity and enhanced glucose tolerance. CONCLUSIONS: BMP9 is a hepatokine regulated by cold-activated CREB and CBP and enhances glucose and fat metabolism by promoting the activation of the thermogenic gene program in adipocytes. These data implicate BMP9 as a potential pharmacological tool for protecting against obesity and type 2 diabetes.",

To better understand how plants sense and respond to the early temperature drop, we performed data-independent acquisition (DIA) method-based mass spectrometry analysis to profile the proteome and phosphoproteome of Arabidopsis seedlings upon cold stress in a time-course manner (10, 30 and 120 min of cold treatments). Our results showed the rapid and extensive changes at the phosphopeptide levels, but not at the protein abundance levels, indicating cold-mediated protein phosphorylation and dephosphorylation events. Alteration of over 1200 proteins at phosphopeptide levels were observed within 2 h of cold treatment, including over 140 kinases, over 40 transcriptional factors and over 40 E3 ligases, revealing the complexity of regulation of cold adaption. We summarized cold responsive phosphoproteins involved in phospholipid signaling, cytoskeleton reorganization, calcium signaling, and MAPK cascades. Cold-altered levels of 73 phosphopeptides (mostly novel cold-responsive) representing 62 proteins were validated by parallel reaction monitoring (PRM). In summary, this study furthers our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of cold adaption in plants and strongly supports that DIA coupled with PRM are valuable tools in uncovering early signaling events in plants.",

      "abstract": "The spotted wing drosophila (SWD), Drosophila suzukii, is a major invasive fruit pest. There is strong consensus that low temperature is among the main drivers of SWD population distribution, and the invasion success of SWD is also linked to its thermal plasticity. Most studies on ectotherm cold tolerance focus on exposure to a single stressful temperature but here we investigated how cold stress intensity affected survival duration across a broad range of low temperatures (-7 to +3 °C). The analysis of Lt50 at different stressful temperatures (Thermal Death Time curve - TDT) is based on the suggestion that cold injury accumulation rate increases exponentially with the intensity of thermal stress. In accordance with the hypothesis, Lt50 of SWD decreased exponentially with temperature. Further, comparison of TDT curves from flies acclimated to 15, 19 and 23 °C, respectively, showed an almost full compensation with acclimation such that the temperature required to induce mortality over a fixed time decreased almost 1 °C per °C lowering of acclimation temperature. Importantly, this change in cold tolerance with acclimation was uniform across the range of moderate to intense cold stress exposures examined. To understand if cold stress at moderate and intense exposures affects the same physiological systems we examined how physiological markers/symptoms of chill injury developed at different intensities of the cold stress. Specifically, hsp23 expression and extracellular [K+] were measured in flies exposed to different intensities of cold stress (-6, -2 and +2 °C) and at various time points corresponding to the same progression of injury (equivalent to 1/3, 2/3 or 3/3 of Lt50). The different cold stress intensities all triggered hsp23 expression following 2 h of recovery, but patterns of expression differed. At the most intense cold stress (-6 and -2 °C) a gradual increase with time was found. In contrast, at +2 °C an initial increase was followed by a dissipating expression. A gradual perturbation of ion balance (hyperkalemia) was also found at all three cold stress intensities examined, with only slight dissimilarities between treatment temperatures. Despite some differences between the three cold intensities examined, the results generally support the hypothesis that intense and moderate cold stress induces the same physiological perturbation. This suggests that cold stress experienced during natural fluctuating conditions is additive and the results also illustrate that the rate of injury accumulation increases dramatically (exponentially) with decreasing temperature (increasing stress).",

CXC ligand 5 (CXCL5) is a member of the CXC chemokine family and is highly expressed by macrophages in white adipose tissue (WAT). In this study, we generated and investigated the function of CXCL5 in knockout (KO) mice using CRISPR/Cas9. The male KO mice did not show significant phenotype differences in normal conditions. However, proteomic analysis revealed that many proteins involved in fatty acid beta-oxidation and mitochondrial localization were enriched in the inguinal WAT (iWAT) of Cxcl5 KO mice. Cxcl5 KO mice also showed decreased protein and transcript expression of genes associated with thermogenesis, including uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1), a well-known thermogenic gene, and increased expression of genes associated with inflammation. The increase in UCP1 expression in cold conditions was significantly retarded in Cxcl5 KO mice. Finally, we found that CXCL5 treatment increased the expression of transcription factors that mediate Ucp1 expression and Ucp1 itself. Collectively, our data show that Ucp1 expression is induced in adipocytes by CXCL5, which is secreted upon β-adrenergic stimulation by cold stimulation in M1 macrophages. Our data indicate that CXCL5 plays a crucial role in regulating energy metabolism, particularly upon cold exposure. These results strongly suggest that targeting CXCL5 could be a potential therapeutic strategy for people suffering from disorders affecting energy metabolism.",

      "abstract": "KEY POINTS: Ambient cold exposure is often regarded as a promising anti-obesity treatment in mice. However, most preclinical studies aimed at treating obesity via cold-induced thermogenesis have been confounded by subthermoneutral housing temperatures. Therefore, the ability of ambient cold to combat diet-induced obesity in mice housed under humanized thermoneutral conditions is currently unknown. Moreover, mammals such as mice are rarely exposed to chronic ambient cold without reprieve, yet mice are often subjected to experimental conditions of chronic rather than intermittent cold exposure (ICE), despite ICE being more physiologically relevant. In the present study, we provide novel evidence that thermoneutral housing uncouples the effects of ICE on glucose and energy homeostasis suggesting that ICE, despite improving glucose tolerance, is not an effective obesity treatment when mice are housed under humanized thermoneutral conditions. ABSTRACT: The present study examines whether a physiologically relevant model of ambient cold exposure, intermittent cold exposure (ICE), could ameliorate the metabolic impairments of diet-induced obesity in male and female mice housed under humanized thermoneutral conditions. Male and female C57BL/6J mice housed at thermoneutrality (29°C) were fed a low-fat diet or high-fat diet for 6 weeks before being weight matched into groups that remained unperturbed or underwent ICE for 4 weeks (4°C for 60 min day-1 ; 5 days week-1 ) when being maintained on their respective diets. ICE induced rapid and persistent hyperphagia exacerbating rather than attenuating high-fat diet-induced obesity over time. These ICE-induced increases in adiposity were found to be energy intake-dependent via pair-feeding. Despite exacerbating high-fat diet-induced obesity, ICE improved glucose tolerance, independent of diet, in a sex-specific manner. The effects of ICE on glucose tolerance were not attributed to improvements in whole-body insulin tolerance, tissue specific insulin action, nor differences in markers of hepatic insulin clearance or pancreatic beta cell proliferation. Instead, ICE increased serum concentrations of insulin and C-peptide in response to glucose, suggesting that ICE may improve glucose tolerance by potentiating pancreatic glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. These data suggest that ICE, despite improving glucose tolerance, is not an effective obesity treatment in mice housed under humanized conditions.",

Thus, we investigated the effects of capsaicin and cold exposure in 1,2-dimethylhydrazine (DMH)-induced colorectal cancer as well as the mechanisms underlying capsaicin and cold-induced CRC. Rats were randomly divided into four groups and received cold still water and capsaicin via intragastric gavage until the end of the experiment. The rat's body weight, thymus weight, and food intakes were assessed. Global levels of histone H3K9, H3K18, H3K27, and H4K16 acetylation and histone deacetylase (HDACs) in colon mucosa were assessed by western blot. Expression levels of Toll-like receptors 2 (TLR2) and Toll-like receptors 4 (TLR4) were measured by western blot and reverse-transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). We found that cold and low-dose capsaicin increased tumor numbers and multiplicity, although there were no differences in tumor incidence. Additionally, rat exposure to cold water and capsaicin display further higher levels of histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9AC), histone H3 lysine 18 (H3K18AC), histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27AC), and HDACs compared with the DMH and normal rats. In contrast, a considerable decrease of histone H4 lysine 16 (H4K16AC) was detected in the colon mucosa. Cold and low-dose capsaicin exposure groups were also increased TLR2 and TLR4 protein levels and mRNA levels. These results suggest that chronic cold exposure and capsaicin at a low-dose intervention exacerbate ectopic expression of global histone acetylation and TLR level, which are crucial mechanisms responsible for the progression of colorectal cancer in rats.",

Importantly, via KEGG analysis, we found that cold and CL commonly induced oxidative phosphorylation. Meanwhile, cold increased glycerolipid and amino acids metabolism while CL treatment triggered a broader spectrum of metabolic responses including carbohydrate metabolism. Besides, cold or CL treatment featured greater heterogeneity in downregulated gene programs. Of note, the top changed genes in each category were confirmed by qPCR analysis. Overall, our analysis provided a better understanding of the heterogeneity of differential models for beige adipocytes activation and a possible clue for optimizing β3-AR agonists in the future."

      "abstract": "The pathogenesis of metabolic diseases such as obesity and type 2 diabetes are characterized by a progressive dysregulation in energy partitioning, often leading to end-organ complications. One emerging approach proposed to target this metabolic dysregulation is the application of mild cold exposure. In healthy individuals, cold exposure can increase energy expenditure and whole body glucose and fatty acid utilization. Repeated exposures can lower fasting glucose and insulin levels and improve dietary fatty acid handling, even in healthy individuals. Despite its apparent therapeutic potential, little is known regarding the effects of cold exposure in populations for which this stimulation could benefit the most. The few studies available have shown that both acute and repeated exposures to the cold can improve insulin sensitivity and reduce fasting glycemia in individuals with type 2 diabetes. However, critical gaps remain in understanding the prolonged effects of repeated cold exposures on glucose regulation and whole body insulin sensitivity in individuals with metabolic syndrome. Much of the metabolic benefits appear to be attributable to the recruitment of shivering skeletal muscles. However, further work is required to determine whether the broader recruitment of skeletal muscles observed during cold exposure can confer metabolic benefits that surpass what has been historically observed from endurance exercise. In addition, although cold exposure offers unique cardiovascular responses for a physiological stimulus that increases energy expenditure, further work is required to determine how acute and repeated cold exposure can impact cardiovascular responses and myocardial function across a broader scope of individuals.",

The objective of this study was to evaluate some physiological, metabolic, and lactational responses of dairy goats exposed to cold temperatures for 3 weeks. Eight Murciano-Granadina dairy goats (41.8 kg body weight, 70 days in milk, and 2.13 kg/day milk) were used from mid-January to mid-March. Goats were divided into 2 balanced groups and used in a crossover design with 2 treatments in 2 periods (21 days each, 14 days adaptation and 7 days for measurements). After the first period, goats were switched to the opposite treatment. The treatments included 2 different controlled climatic conditions with different temperature-humidity index (THI) values. The treatments were: thermoneutral conditions (TN; 15 to 20 °C, 45% humidity, THI = 58 to 65), and cold temperature (CT; -3 to 6 °C, 63% humidity, THI = 33 to 46). Goats were fed ad libitum a total mixed ration (70% forage and 30% concentrate) and water was freely available. Goats were milked at 0800 and 1700 h. Dry matter intake, water consumption, rectal temperature, and respiratory rate were recorded daily (days 15 to 21). Body weight was recorded at the start and end of each period. Milk samples for composition were collected on 2 consecutive days (days 20 and 21). Insulin, glucose, non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA), ß-hydroxybutyrate (BHB), cholesterol, and triglycerides were measured in blood on d 21. Compared to TN goats, CT goats had similar feed intake, but lower water consumption (-22 ± 3%), respiratory rate (-5 ± 0.8 breaths/min), and rectal temperature (-0.71 ± 0.26 °C). Milk yield decreased by 13 ± 3% in CT goats, but their milk contained more fat (+13 ± 4%) and protein (+14 ± 5%), and consequently the energy-corrected milk did not vary between TN and CT goats. The CT goats lost 0.64 kg of body weight, whereas TN goats gained 2.54 kg in 21 days. Blood insulin and cholesterol levels were not affected by CT. However, values of blood glucose, NEFA, hematocrit, and hemoglobin increased or tended to increase by CT, whereas BHB and triglycerides decreased. Overall, CT goats produced less but concentrated milk compared to TN goats. Despite similar feed intake and blood insulin levels CT goats had increased blood glucose and NEFA levels. The tendency of increased blood NEFA indicates that CT goats mobilized body fat reserves to cover the extra energy needed for heat production under cold conditions."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Brown adipose tissue (BAT) is a site of metabolic thermogenesis mediated by mitochondrial uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) and represents a target for a therapeutic intervention in obesity. Cold exposure activates UCP1-mediated thermogenesis in BAT and causes drastic changes in glucose, lipid, and amino acid metabolism; however, the relationship between these metabolic changes and UCP1-mediated thermogenesis is not fully understood. METHODS: We conducted metabolomic and GeneChip array analyses of BAT after 4-h exposure to cold temperature (10 °C) in wild-type (WT) and UCP1-KO mice. RESULTS: Cold exposure largely increased metabolites of the glycolysis pathway and lactic acid levels in WT, but not in UCP1-KO, mice, indicating that aerobic glycolysis is enhanced as a consequence of UCP1-mediated thermogenesis. GeneChip array analysis of BAT revealed that there were 2865 genes upregulated by cold exposure in WT mice, and 838 of these were upregulated and 74 were downregulated in UCP1-KO mice. Pathway analysis revealed the enrichment of genes involved in fatty acid (FA) β oxidation and triglyceride (TG) synthesis in both WT and UCP1-KO mice, suggesting that these metabolic pathways were enhanced by cold exposure independently of UCP1-mediated thermogenesis. FA and cholesterol biosynthesis pathways were enhanced only in UCP1-KO mice. Cold exposure also significantly increased the BAT content of proline, tryptophan, and phenylalanine amino acids in both WT and UCP1-KO mice. In WT mice, cold exposure significantly increased glutamine content and enhanced the expression of genes related to glutamine metabolism. Surprisingly, aspartate was almost completely depleted after cold exposure in UCP1-KO mice. Gene expression analysis suggested that aspartate was actively utilized after cold exposure both in WT and UCP1-KO mice, but it was replenished from intracellular N-acetyl-aspartate in WT mice. CONCLUSIONS: These results revealed that cold exposure induces UCP1-mediated thermogenesis-dependent glucose utilization and UCP1-independent active lipid metabolism in BAT. In addition, cold exposure largely affects amino acid metabolism in BAT, especially UCP1-dependently enhances glutamine utilization. These results contribute a comprehensive understanding of UCP1-mediated thermogenesis-dependent and thermogenesis-independent metabolism in BAT.",

Running in a cold environment alters exercise-induced hyperthermia and outcomes; however, evaluations of post-exercise cold exposure related to exercise benefits for the brain are relatively rare. We investigated the effects of 4°C cold exposure after exercise on exercise-induced thermal responses and neuroprotection in an MPTP (1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine)-induced Parkinsonian mouse model. Male C57BL/6J mice were pretreated with MPTP for five consecutive days and follow-up treadmill exercise for 4 weeks. After 1-h running at a 22°C temperature, the mice were exposed to a 4°C environment for 2 h. An MPTP injection induced a transient drop in body and brain temperatures, while mild brain hypothermia was found to last for 4 weeks after MPTP treatment. Preventing brain hypothermia by exercise or 4°C exposure was associated with an improvement in MPTP-induced striatal uncoupling protein 4 (UCP4) downregulation and nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurodegeneration. However, 4°C exposure after exercise abrogated the exercise-induced beneficial effects and thermal responses in MPTP-treated mice, including a low amplitude of exercise-induced brain hyperthermia and body temperature while at rest after exercise. Our findings elucidate that post-exercise thermoregulation and UCP4 expression are important in the neuroprotective effects of exercise against MPTP toxicity."

To develop drug therapies against NaV1.9-related neuropathic pain, we aimed to establish a novel model using mice carrying the Scn11a p.R222S mutation initially identified in patients with familial episodic limb pain that is characterized by paroxysmal pain induced by fatigue or bad weather conditions. We investigated the influence of cold exposure (4 °C, overnight) on the behavioral and biochemical phenotypes of Scn11a p.R222S mutant (R222S) and wild type C57BL/6N (WT) mice. We also tested the effects of acetaminophen (125, 250 mg/kg, perorally, p.o.) and traditional Japanese medicine, goshajinkigan (0.5 or 1.0 g/kg, p.o.), which are analgesic drugs prescribed to patients with neuropathic pain, in this model of cold-induced mechanical allodynia in R222S mice.Cold-exposed R222S mice exhibited enhanced mechanical allodynia and thermal hypersensitivity compared with WT mice. The decrease of the mechanical withdrawal threshold in R222S mice was reversible 24 h after housing at room temperature. There was no significant change in the levels of interleukin-1β, interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-α, or interferon-γ in the plasma or spinal cords of WT and R222S mice after cold exposure. Both acetaminophen (250 mg/kg) and goshajinkigan (1.0 g/kg) significantly attenuated mechanical allodynia in R222S mice. The model of cold-induced mechanical allodynia in mice with the Scn11a p.R222S mutation is novel and useful for evaluating analgesic drugs for intractable neuropathies related to NaV1.9.",

We investigated how an extended period of cold exposure to Arabidopsis plants before and after inflorescence meristem differentiation would affect plant growth and shoot branching. The number of rosette leaves and shoot branches increased when wild type (WT) juvenile seedlings, but not adult plants, were subjected to a prolonged cold exposure (10/7°C day/night cycle). As the duration of cold exposure to WT juvenile seedlings increased, so too did the rosette area, number of leaves, and rosette branches revealing an extended period of vegetative growth. The prolonged cold treatment also increased the primary inflorescence stem height and number of cauline branches in WT plants revealing a delay in reproductive development that could be altered by early (set domain group 8; sdg8) and late (methyltransferase 1; met1) flowering mutants. The axillary buds/leaf and rosette branches/leaf ratios declined significantly in WT, yet were enhanced in the loss-of-function of carotenoid cleavage dioxygenase 7 (ccd7) and teosinte branched 1 (brc1) hyper-branched mutants. This indicated that axillary meristem differentiation continued during the cold exposure, which did not directly impact axillary bud formation or shoot branching. We conclude that a prolonged cold exposure to juvenile seedlings prior to inflorescence meristem development extended vegetative growth and delayed the reproductive phase to allow additional leaf primordia and axillary meristems to differentiate that enhanced the number of shoot branches in Arabidopsis.",

Furthermore, gut microbiome fermentation determines the efficacy of exercise for diabetes prevention and enhances exercise performance. However, there have been no systematic examinations of changes in gut microbiome composition in relation to exercise performed under low-temperature conditions. In this study, we investigated the effects of exercise performed under different conditions (room temperature, acute cold, intermittent cold, and sustained cold) in obese rats maintained on a high-fat diet at four time points during experimental trials (days 0, 1, 3, and 35), including observations on white fat browning, weight loss, cardiovascular effects, and changes in gut microbiota among treatment groups. We found that exercise under sustained cold conditions produced a remarkable shift in microbiota composition. Unexpectedly, exercise was found to reverse the alterations in gut microbiota alpha-diversity and the abundance of certain bacterial phyla observed in response to cold exposure (e.g., Proteobacteria decreased upon cold exposure but increased in response to exercise under cold conditions). Moreover, exercise under cold conditions (hereafter referred to \"cold exercise\") promoted a considerably higher level of white fat browning and greater weight loss and protected against the negative cardiovascular effects of cold exposure. Correlation analysis revealed that cold exercise-related changes in gut microbial communities were significantly correlated with white fat browning and cardiovascular phenotypes. These results could reveal novel mechanisms whereby additional health benefits attributable to both cold and exercise are mediated via altered gut microbes differently compared with either of them alone."

      "abstract": "CONTEXT: Cold exposure (CE) has been shown to enhance energy expenditure by activating brown adipose tissue thermogenesis and metabolism in humans. However, it remains to be elucidated if there are gender-specific differences in cold-induced thermogenesis and metabolism. OBJECTIVE: To study the impact of mild CE on resting energy expenditure (REE) and metabolism in males compared with females. SETTING: A cross-sectional study. PARTICIPANTS: 117 healthy young Caucasians participated in this study (58 males). Mean age was 25.1 ± 3.6 years and mean body mass index 22.3 ± 1.7 kg/m2. INTERVENTION: Participants underwent a short-term CE using water perfused mattresses to activate nonshivering thermogenesis. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: REE was assessed before and 2 hours after CE followed by blood sampling. Selected metabolites and hormones were measured. Skin temperatures were monitored at various sites throughout the experiment. RESULTS: Participants showed a significant increase in REE after CE (6.5%, P < .001). This increase did not differ between genders (P = .908). However, there were differences between males and females in changes of plasma glucose (-5.1% versus -7.4%, P = .024), leptin (-14.3% versus -30.1%, P < .001) and adiponectin (5.4% versus 12.8%, P = .018) after CE. We observed a significant decrease of the supraclavicular skin temperature in men (-0.3%, P = .034), but not in women (0.3%, P = .326)(P = .019 between genders). CONCLUSIONS: We did not observe a difference in the thermogenic response, measured as change of REE, to CE in women compared with men. However, we found that some metabolic and hormonal changes were more pronounced in women than in men suggesting a gender-specific response to cold.",

      "abstract": "Maintaining extracellular osmotic and ionic homeostasis is crucial for organismal function. In insects, hemolymph volume and ion content is regulated by the secretory Malpighian tubules and reabsorptive hindgut. When exposed to stressful cold, homeostasis is gradually disrupted, characterized by a debilitating increase in extracellular K+ concentration (hyperkalemia). Accordingly, studies have found a strong link between species-specific cold tolerance and the ability to maintain ion and water homeostasis at low temperature. This is also true for drosophilids where inter- and intra-specific differences in cold tolerance are linked to the secretory capacity of Malpighian tubules. There is, however, little information on the reabsorptive capacity of the hindgut in Drosophila To address this, we developed a novel method that permits continuous measurements of hindgut ion and fluid reabsorption in Drosophila We demonstrate that this assay is temporally stable (∼2 h) and responsive to cAMP stimulation and pharmacological intervention in accordance with the current insect hindgut reabsorption model. We then investigated how cold acclimation or cold adaptation affected hindgut reabsorption at benign (24°C) and low temperature (3°C). Cold-tolerant Drosophila species and cold-acclimated D. melanogaster maintain superior fluid and Na+ reabsorption at low temperature. Furthermore, cold adaptation and acclimation caused a relative reduction in K+ reabsorption at low temperature. These characteristic responses of cold adaptation/acclimation will promote maintenance of ion and water homeostasis at low temperature. Our study of hindgut function therefore provides evidence that adaptations in the osmoregulatory capacity of insects are critical for their ability to tolerate cold.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: The primary objective of this trial was to assess safety and anti-inflammatory effects of an add-on training program involving breathing exercises, cold exposure, and meditation in patients with axial spondyloarthritis. METHODS: This study was an open-label, randomised, one-way crossover clinical proof-of-concept trial. Twenty-four patients with moderately active axial spondyloarthritis(ASDAS >2.1) and hs-CRP ≥5mg/L were included and randomised to an intervention (n = 13) and control group (n = 11) group that additionally received the intervention after the control period. The intervention period lasted for 8 weeks. The primary endpoint was safety, secondary endpoints were change in hs-CRP, serum calprotectin levels and ESR over the 8-week period. Exploratory endpoints included disease activity measured by ASDAS-CRP and BASDAI, quality of life (SF-36, EQ-5D, EQ-5D VAS), and hospital anxiety and depression (HADS). RESULTS: We found no significant differences in adverse events between groups, with one serious adverse event occurring 8 weeks after end of the intervention and judged 'unrelated'. During the 8-week intervention period, there was a significant decline of ESR from (median [interquartile range] to 16 [9-26.5] to 9 [5-23] mm/hr, p = 0.040, whereas no effect was found in the control group (from 14 [8.3-27.3] to 16 [5-37] m/hr, p = 0.406). ASDAS-CRP declined from 3.1 [2.5-3.6] to 2.3 [1.9-3.2] in the intervention group (p = 0.044). A similar trend was observed for serum calprotectin (p = 0.064 in the intervention group versus p = 0.182 in the control group), but not for hs-CRP. CONCLUSIONS: This proof-of-concept study in axial spondyloarthritis met its primary endpoint with no safety signals during the intervention. There was a significant decrease in ESR levels and ASDAS-CRP upon the add-on training program in the intervention group. These findings warrant full-scale randomised controlled trials of this novel therapeutic approach in patients with inflammatory conditions. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov; NCT02744014.",

These adipocytes express high levels of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) and energy expended by generating heat. Thus, these are a potential target for the prevention or treatment of obesity. The present study involved a comprehensive analysis of the adipose tissue to understand the relationship between long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) 2310069B03Rik and UCP1. Cold exposure increased both lncRNA 2310069B03Rik and Ucp1 expression in inguinal white adipose tissue (iWAT). However, overexpression of lncRNA 2310069B03Rik suppressed the Ucp1 mRNA expression and the promoter activity of UCP1 in the iWAT primary adipocytes. In addition, compared to the early induction of Ucp1 expression by cold stimulation, the induction of lncRNA 2310069B03Rik expression was later. These results suggest that lncRNA 2310069B03Rik functions as a suppression factor of Ucp1 expression.",

In vivo, male and female C57BL/6 mice were stimulated in 4 °C, 3 h per day for 1 week to build the model of cold sress. In vitro, hippocampal neuronal cell line (HT22) cells were incubated with or without mifepristone (RU486) for 1 h, then treated with 400 μM cortisol (CORT) for 3 h. In vivo, autophagy was measured by western blotting. In vitro, monodansylcadaverine staining, western blotting, flow cytometry, transmission electron microscopy, and immunofluorescence were used to characterize the mechanism of autophagy induced by excess CORT. Autophagy was shown in mouse hippocampus tissues following cold exposure, including mitochondrial damage, autophagy, and 5' AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway activation after CORT treatment. Autophagy did not rely on the glucocorticoid receptor. In addition, autophagy in male mice was more severe. The study would provide new insight into the mechanisms and the negative effect of the cold stress response, which can inform the development of new strategies to combat the effects of hypothermia."

      "abstract": "Green leaf volatiles (GLVs), which have mostly been described as providers of protection against insect herbivory and necrotrophic pathogen infections, were recently shown to provide significant fortification against cold stress damage. It was further demonstrated that cold-damaged maize seedlings released a significant amount of GLVs, in particular, Z-3-hexenal (Z-3-HAL). Here, we report that the in-cold treatment of maize seedlings with Z-3-HAL significantly improved cold stress resistance. The transcripts for cold-protective genes were also significantly increased in the Z-3-HAL treated maize seedlings over those found in only cold stressed plants. Consequently, the maize seedlings treated with HAL during cold showed a significantly increased structural integrity, significantly less damage, and increased growth after cold stress, relative to the non-HAL treated maize seedlings. Together, these results demonstrate the protective effect of in-cold treatment with HAL against cold damage, and suggest that the perception of these compounds during cold episodes significantly improves resistance against this abiotic stress."

      "abstract": "Environmental temperature plays a role in the variation of blood pressure. Maternal cold stress could affect the physiological phenotype of the offspring, including blood pressure elevation. In the present study, we found that adult offspring of dams exposed to cold have increased systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and decreased urine volume and sodium excretion, accompanied by increased heart rate and heart rate variability, secondary to increased activity of the sympathetic nervous system. Renal denervation or adrenergic receptor blockade decreased blood pressure and increased sodium excretion. The increase in peripheral sympathetic nerve activity can be ascribed to the central nervous system because administration of clonidine, a centrally acting α2 adrenergic receptor agonist, lowered blood pressure to a greater degree in the prenatal cold-exposed than control offspring. Moreover, these prenatal cold-exposed offspring had hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN) disorder because magnetic resonance spectroscopy showed decreased N-acetylaspartate and increased choline and creatine ratios in the PVN. Additional studies found that prenatal cold exposure impaired the balance between inhibitory and excitatory neurons. This led to PVN overactivation that was related to enhanced PVN-angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) receptor expression and function. Microinjection of the AT1 receptor antagonist losartan in the PVN lowered blood pressure to a greater extent in prenatal cold-exposed that control offspring. The present study provides evidence for overactive peripheral and central sympathetic nervous systems in the pathogenesis of prenatal cold-induced hypertension. Central AT1 receptor blockade in the PVN may be a key step for treatment of this type hypertension.",

The cAMP responsive element binding protein (CREB)-regulated transcription coactivator 3 (CRTC3) plays important role in adipose development and energy metabolism. However, the effect of cold exposure on the intracellular localization of CRTC3 in BAT is unclear. Here, we report that cold-treated mice have higher expression of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) in adipose tissues and lower body weights and fat masses. Notably, cold exposure results in the nuclear translocation of CRTC3 in BAT. Moreover, forskolin (FSK), the activator of PKA pathway, induces the nuclear translocation of CRTC3 in brown adipocytes. At the molecular level, cold exposure and FSK treatment decrease liver kinase B1 (Lkb1) expression in brown adipocytes, which is related to the nuclear localization of CRTC3. These results demonstrate that the localization of CRTC3 involves in regulating cold-induced upregulation of UCP1 in BAT and provide useful information for understanding the molecular regulation of BAT thermogenesis induced by a cold environment.",

      "abstract": "UNLABELLED: Brown and beige adipose tissues play key roles in adaptive thermogenesis, which is essential for homoiotherms to maintain core temperature under cold exposure. PPARγ is a transcriptional regulator critical for brown adipose tissue (BAT) recruitment and white adipose tissue (WAT) browning. Here we evaluated the impact of PPARγ activation on thermogenic activity in C57BL/6 mice under thermo-neutral and 4 °C cold environment, and revealed the regulating mechanism and metabolic basis. Rosiglitazone slowed body temperature loss in cold environment in C57BL/6 mice, suppressed cold-induced decreases in blood glucose, reversed cold-promoted 18F-FDG uptake, and increased lipid consumption in BAT. Serum/adipose tissue metabolomic and transcriptomic analyses revealed that cold exposure and rosiglitazone affect metabolism in different way, especially in terms of free fatty acid/lipid metabolism. While all tested treatments stimulated stored-substance mobilization in epididymal WAT, in heat-generating adipose tissues (BAT and subcutaneous WAT), rosiglitazone-only treatment promoted the storage of substances such as lipids for subsequent thermogenic activation; conversely, cold exposure favoured glucose consumption and mobilization/transport of extracellular lipids. When combined with cold exposure, rosiglitazone treatment preferentially triggered BAT lipid consumption, mobilized and transported lipids from epididymal to subcutaneous WAT, and reduced glucose usage. Thus, rosiglitazone might promote thermogenesis under cold exposure by switching fuel preference. SIGNIFICANCE: In current study, for the first time, PPARγ agonism by rosiglitazone was proved to promote thermogenesis under near-freezing conditions and enhance the heat generating response against cold-induced hypothermia in mice by switching the fuel preference from carbohydrates to lipids. The lipid substrates stored in BAT in response to PPARγ activation are spared for eventual thermogenic activation. These findings thus underline the remarkable actions of PPARγ in the control of energy metabolism in adipose tissues, especially the BAT.",

Turkeys (72 toms, 72 hens) were randomly divided into 3 male and 3 female groups: 2 moderate 20°C groups with either 30% or 80% RH and a cold group exposed to -18°C, with uncontrolled, high RH. Groups of 8 birds (one replicate unit) were observed in a climate-controlled chamber for 8 h prior to slaughter. Core body temperature (CBT), live shrink, heterophil-lymphocyte ratio (HLR), and change in blood glucose levels were assessed; meat quality measures included thigh and breast muscle pH and L*, a*, and b* color values. Significance was declared at P ≤ 0.05. Live shrink in hens exposed to -18°C (2.8%) was greater (P = 0.001) than those in the 20°C treatments (1.5%). CBT in hens had a tendency to decrease (P = 0.070); no differences in Δ blood glucose or HLR were detected. Thigh pH was higher in the -18°C treatment (hens: 6.39; toms: 6.08) than in both 20°C groups. Color values (L*, a*, and b*) were measured 27 h postmortem. In the -18°C exposed hens, breast L* values were lower, and thigh a* and breast b* values were higher than in both 20°C treatments. No differences were detected in live shrink, CBT, HLR, or color values among toms. Behavior differences were noted between treatments; more time was spent huddling, shivering, preening, and with feathers ptiloerected in cold-exposed turkeys. Generally, cold exposure resulted in higher live shrink, darker meat with greater redness, and a tendency for CBT and blood glucose to decrease, with larger male turkeys experiencing fewer changes.",

METHODS: 8-week old male C57BL/6J mice were individually housed in conventional cages under cold exposure (4°C) for 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 days. Interscapular brown adipose tissue (iBAT), inguinal subcutaneous (sWAT) and epididymal white adipose tissues (eWAT) were harvested for immunohistochemical and gene expression analysis. In vitro, primary mice BA and WA treated with or without CL316,243 were harvested for gene expression and protein secretion analysis. RESULTS: A combination of morphological and genetic (Vegfa, Vegfr2, Hif-1α, Pai1 and Pedf) analyses demonstrated depot-specific angiogenesis in response to cold exposure. Upon CL316,243 treatment, angiogenic factors (Vegfa, Vegfr2, Hif-1α, Pai1 and Pedf) and secreted protein VEGFA were transiently increased in both BA and WA. CONCLUSION: Our results show that iBAT is highly responsive to cold-induced angiogenesis that is mainly supported by sWAT with a lesser extent by eWAT. Moreover, the angiogenesis is a transient process with the angiogenic factors may work in an autocrine/paracrine manner.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Several studies have demonstrated anti-diabetic and anti-obesogenic properties of visceral adipose tissue-derived serine protease inhibitor (vaspin) and so evoked its potential use for treatment of obesity-related diseases. The aim of the study was to unravel physiological regulators of vaspin expression and secretion with a particular focus on its role in brown adipose tissue (BAT) biology. METHODS: We analyzed the effects of obesogenic diets and cold exposure on vaspin expression in liver and white and brown adipose tissue (AT) and plasma levels. Vaspin expression was analyzed in isolated white and brown adipocytes during adipogenesis and in response to adrenergic stimuli. DNA-methylation within the vaspin promoter was analyzed to investigate acute epigenetic changes after cold-exposure in BAT. RESULTS: Our results demonstrate a strong induction of vaspin mRNA and protein expression specifically in BAT of both cold-exposed and high-fat (HF) or high-sugar (HS) fed mice. While obesogenic diets also upregulated hepatic vaspin mRNA levels, cold exposure tended to increase vaspin gene expression of inguinal white adipose tissue (iWAT) depots. Concomitantly, vaspin plasma levels were decreased upon obesogenic or thermogenic triggers. Vaspin expression was increased during adipogenesis but unaffected by sympathetic activation in brown adipocytes. Analysis of vaspin promoter methylation in AT revealed lowest methylation levels in BAT, which were acutely reduced after cold exposure. CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrate a novel BAT-specific regulation of vaspin gene expression upon physiological stimuli in vivo with acute epigenetic changes that may contribute to cold-induced expression in BAT. We conclude that these findings indicate functional relevance and potentially beneficial effects of vaspin in BAT function.",

      "abstract": "The last few years have seen great advances in our understanding of browning in white adipose tissue (WAT) where white adipocytes take on characteristics of brown adipocytes. At present, the economic significance of browning for animal husbandry is beginning to be realized with the emerging evidence that browning affects body weight not only in human and rodent but in farm animals. Quantitative RT-PCR provides a quick and sensitive way to preliminary determine browning of WAT. However, there have been no established condition specific reference genes for browning of cattle WAT. As the results showed, the most two stable reference genes for diet treatment were Wdr33 (M=0.38) and Hdac3 (M=0.43), while the most three internal controls for temperature treatment were Hdac3 (M=0.28), Wdr33 (M=0.32), and Hprt1 (M=0.39) among the ten candidates. The mRNA relative expression levels of selective marker genes were normalized by normalization factor (geometric mean of control genes quantities). Cold exposure rather than high energy diet induced transcript elevations of brite specific markers (Cited1, Tbx1), thermoregulatory markers (brown and beige versus white markers, i.e., Cidea, Cox7a1, Ucp1), mitochondrial biogenesis markers (Nrf1, Nrf2, Tfam), and transcription regulators (brown and beige versus white markers, i.e., Pgc1α) (P<0.05) in cattle inguinal fat (iWAT). Quantitative RT-PCR is a preliminary study for WAT browning. In conclusion, cattle inguinal fat acquired brown adipocyte gene expression features upon cold acclimation with prerequisite identification of stable reference genes.",

To date, there has been no information on the effects of cold exposure on homeostasis of reactive oxygen species (ROS) or antioxidant defense response in the Chinese soft-shelled turtle, Pelodiscus sinensis. In this study, P. sinensis juveniles were acclimated at 28 °C, transferred to 8 °C as cold exposure for 12 h, then moved back to 28 °C rewarming for 24 h. We measured the ROS level and total antioxidant capacity (TAC) in the brain, liver, kidney and spleen at 2 and 12 h cold exposure, and at the end of the rewarming period. Malonaldehyde (MDA) and carbonyl protein were used as markers of oxidative damage. Turtles being maintained simultaneously at 28 °C were used as the control group. Cold exposure did not disturb the ROS balance in all 4 tissues, while rewarming raised the ROS level in the brain and kidney of P. sinensis. Cold exposure and rewarming decreased the TAC in the brain, liver and spleen but did not change the TAC in the kidney. MDA and carbonyl protein levels did not increase during the treatment, indicating no oxidative damage in all 4 tissues of P. sinensis. Our results indicated that extreme cold exposure did not impact the inner oxidative balance of P. sinensis, but more ROS was produced during rewarming. P. sinensis showed good tolerance to the harsh temperature change through effective protection of its antioxidant defense system to oxidative damage. This study provides basic data on the stress biology of P. sinensis.",

DESIGN: Randomized, open, parallel-group trial. METHODS: Healthy non-selected participants were randomized to achieve cold-exposure 1hour/day, or to avoid any sense of feeling cold, for 6weeks. Metabolic rate (MR) was measured by indirect calorimetry before and after acute cold-exposure with cold vests and ingestion of cold water. The BAT volumes in the supraclavicular region were measured with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). RESULTS: Twenty-eight participants were recruited, 12 were allocated to controls and 16 to cold-exposure. Two participants in the cold group dropped out and one was excluded. Both the non-stimulated and the cold-stimulated MR were lowered within the group randomized to avoid cold (MR at room temperature from 1841±199 kCal/24h to 1795±213 kCal/24h, p=0.047 cold-activated MR from 1900±150 kCal/24h to 1793±215 kCal/24h, p=0.028). There was a trend towards increased MR at room temperature following the intervention in the cold-group (p=0.052). The difference between MR changes by the interventions between groups was statistically significant (p=0.008 at room temperature, p=0.032 after cold-activation). In an on-treatment analysis after exclusion of two participants that reported ≥8days without cold-exposure, supraclavicular BAT volume had increased in the cold-exposure group (from 0.0175±0.015l to 0.0216±0.014l, p=0.049). CONCLUSIONS: We found evidence for plasticity in metabolic rate by avoiding to freeze compared with cold-exposure in a randomized setting in non-selected humans.",

      "abstract": "AIM: Dietary restriction (DR) and fasting (FA) induce robust protection against the detrimental effects of renal ischemia-reperfusion injury (I/RI). Several mechanisms of protection have been proposed, such as hormesis. Hormesis is defined as a life-supporting beneficial effect resulting from the cellular responses to single or multiple rounds of (mild) stress. The cold exposure (CE) model is a stress model similar to DR, and has been shown to have hormetic effects and has proved to increase longevity. CE is considered to be the most robust method to increase metabolism through activation of brown adipocytes. BAT has been considered important in etiology of obesity and its metabolic consequences. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Since DR, FA, and CE models are proposed to work through hormesis, we investigated physiology of adipose tissue and effect on BAT in these models and compared them to ad libitum (AL) fed mice. We also studied the differential effect of these stress models on immunological changes, and effect of CE on renal I/RI. KEY FINDINGS: We show similar physiological changes in adiposity in male C57Bl/6 mice due to DR, FA and CE, but the CE mice were not protected against renal I/RI. The immunophenotypic changes observed in the CE mice were similar to the AL animals, in contrast to FA mice, that showed major immunophenotypic changes in the B and T cell development stages in primary and secondary lymphoid organs. SIGNIFICANCE: Our findings thus demonstrate that DR, FA and CE are hormetic stress models. DR and FA protect against renal I/IR, whereas CE could not.",

Liver, brown adipose tissue (BAT) and white adipose tissue are important regulators of plasma TG. Exposure to 4°C reduces plasma TG concentrations, and we therefore aimed to study the interaction between glucocorticoid excess and 24 hours of exposure to 4°C on lipid metabolism. For this, mice were implanted with 50-mg corticosterone or control pellets and housed for 24 hours at 23°C or 4°C 1 week later, after which various aspects of TG metabolism in liver, BAT, and white adipose tissue were studied. Corticosterone treatment resulted in a 3.8-fold increase of plasma TG concentrations. Increased TG was normalized by cold exposure, an effect still present 24 hours after cold exposure. Corticosterone treatment increased hepatic TG content by 3.5-fold and provoked secretion of large, TG-rich very low density lipoprotein particles. Cold exposure reduced very low density lipoprotein-TG secretion by approximately 50%. Corticosterone strongly decreased BAT activity: BAT weight increased by 3.5-fold, whereas uncoupling protein 1 (Ucp1) mRNA expression and Ucp1 protein content of BAT were reduced by 75% and 60%, respectively. Cold exposure partially normalized these parameters of BAT activity. The uptake of TG by BAT was not affected by corticosterone treatment but was increased 4.5-fold upon cold exposure. In conclusion, cold exposure normalizes corticosterone-induced hypertriglyceridemia, at least partly via activating BAT.",

Mitchell, by Cyrtobagous salviniae Calder and Sands (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), in temperate regions has been less reliable relative to tropical and subtropical regions. High mortality of overwintering adults is presumed to be an important factor. At temperate sites, overwintering adult C. salviniae may experience multiple exposures to low temperatures that could compound to lethal levels. We examined the effects of repeated cold exposure (RCE) on the overwintering mortality and feeding rate of adult C. salviniae. Mortality rate of adults following exposure to 2, 4, and 6 cycles of RCE was 22, 70 and 82%, respectively. Mortality in the RCE treatment was similar to that in the matched-cold treatment for 2 and 6 cycles but was significantly less than in the matched-cold treatment for the 4 cycles. The relationship between the number of RCE and adult mortality rate was modeled and model results were compared to adult survival of caged weevils during four winters on two lakes in northeast Texas. Also, the feeding activity of adult weevils surviving RCE declined following exposure to 4 and 6 cycles of RCE. These results provide insight into how cold impacts overwintering survival of C. salviniae and should assist in anticipating the need for inoculative releases of C. salviniae the following spring to achieve consistent biological control of S. molesta at temperate locales.",

      "abstract": "PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The purpose of this short review paper is to summarize recent developments in the understanding of the activation, growth and function of brown adipose tissue (BAT). RECENT FINDINGS: Transcriptional markers for increased BAT activity and differentiation of white adipocytes to 'beige' or 'brite' adipocytes include amongst others peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ, cytosine-enhancer-binding protein, positive regulatory domain 16 and bone morphogenetic proteins. These markers induce uncoupling protein 1 expression in brown and 'beige' or 'brite' adipocytes which allows energy from macronutrients to be expended as heat. Acute and repeated mild cold exposures of 17-19 °C in adult humans increase BAT volume and activity and this is a novel method for increasing their energy expenditure. Emerging evidence suggests that irisin and melatonin hormones may be involved in BAT activation. Additionally, brown adipocyte stem cell therapy transplantation is a means to stimulate this increased thermogenesis from brown and 'beige' or 'brite' adipocytes. SUMMARY: Markers for increased BAT activation and for white adipocyte differentiation into beige/brite adipocytes have been identified, and these lead to an uncoupling protein 1-mediated increase in metabolic rate. Mild cold exposure and brown adipocyte stem cell transplantation are two potential strategies for inducing activation and growth of BAT for the treatment of human obesity.",

However, the effects of early and intermittent exposure to cold temperature on systemic metabolic changes in adult life remain unclear. MAIN METHODS: To elucidate the impact of cold temperature exposure on metabolic function of adipose tissues, we investigated the glucose homeostasis, activation of brown adipose tissue (BAT) and \"browning\" of white adipose tissue (WAT) in mice in response to intermittent cold exposure. Mice were exposed to 4 °C, 2h per day and 5 days per week, for 14 weeks. Glucose homeostasis was tested via intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test and insulin tolerance test; body fat mass was evaluated using in vivo magnetic resonance imaging; BAT activity was detected primarily by positron emission tomography/computed tomography; and WAT \"browning\" was evaluated using immunohistochemistry. KEY FINDINGS: Our results showed that a 14-week cold exposure improved glucose tolerance and enhanced insulin sensitivity, reduced the relative weights of epididymal and retroperitoneal WAT, increased expressions of UCP1 and PGC1α in subcutaneous adipose tissue. SIGNIFICANCE: Intermittent exposure to cold temperature in early life may improve systemic glucose homeostasis and induce WAT \"browning\", suggesting that an ambient cold temperature exposure may serve as a promising intervention to metabolic disorders.",

This study adds to a recently published study of Kox et al. (PNAS 111:7379-7384, 2014) on the ability to voluntarily influence the physiological stress response in healthy men after a training program consisting of meditation, breathing techniques, and exposure to cold, which found highly promising results on the clinical, autonomic, and immune response to experimentally induced inflammation (using the experimental human endotoxemia model). Within this project, a number of variables were included to assess the role of generalized (optimism, neuroticism) and specific outcome expectancies (related to the effects of the training on health) on the response to endotoxin administration after training. Indications were found that especially the generalized outcome expectancy optimism is a potential determinant of the autonomic (epinephrine: rho = 0.76, p < .01) and immune response (interleukin-10: rho = 0.60, p < .05) to induced inflammation after training, whereas more specific expectations with regard to the effects of the training could be especially relevant for the clinical symptom report (flu-like symptoms: rho = -0.71, p < .01). This proof-of-principle study provides first indications for potential innovative treatments to change immune-modulating responses by means of psychological mechanisms. If replicated, these findings may be used for predicting training responses and potentiate their effects by means of optimism-inducing interventions in patients with immune-mediated rheumatic conditions.",

Here, we evaluated the anti-diabetic activity of T0901317, a potent agonist of LXRs, in diabetic mice induced by streptozotocin, and our data demonstrate that T0901317 is most effective when combined with cold treatment of animals. Treatment with T0901317 improved glucose tolerance of diabetic mice, which was associated with repressed expression of key genes involved in hepatic gluconeogenesis such as Pepck and G6p. Combined treatment by T0901317 and cold exposure reduced transcription of gluconeogenic genes to similar levels. Intriguingly, combined treatment greatly increased expression of Ucp1, Cidea, Dio2, and Elvol3 predominantly in the inguinal white adipose tissue, consequently leading to browning of this fat pad, and resulting in further improvement of glucose tolerance which was associated with increased protein levels of UCP1 and GLUT4. Collectively, these results suggest that browning of white adipose tissue via cold exposure in combination with activation of liver X receptors is an alternative and effective strategy to manage insulin-dependent diabetes.",

To date, little is known about the mechanism of protective antioxidative defenses in turtles during acute temperature change, specifically the role that the antioxidant ascorbic acid (AA) plays. In this study, Chinese soft-shelled turtles (Pelodiscus sinensis) were initially acclimated at 28°C (3 wks), exposed to acute cold condition (8°C, 8 h) and finally placed in recovery (28°C, 24 h). L-Gulonolactone oxidase (GLO) mRNA exhibited a stable transcription pattern during the intense thermal fluctuation. GLO activity also remained stable, which validated the mRNA expression pattern. The similar Q10 values for GLO activity in the different treatment groups at incubation temperatures of 28°C and 8°C indicated that the GLO activity response to thermal change exhibited a temperature-dependent enzymatic kinetic characteristic. The AA storage was tissue-specific as well as the AA re-supply in the recovery period, with brain as the priority. Despite the insufficient transport during cold exposure, the plasma AA reservoir greatly contributed to the redistribution of AA during recovery. Depending on the prominent GLO activity, the high level of tissue-specific AA storage and the extraordinary plasma AA transport potential, the Chinese soft-shelled turtle endured severe thermal fluctuations with no apparent oxidative stress. However, the significant decrease in AA concentration in the brain tissue during acute cold exposure suggested that such a strategy may not be sufficient for prolonged cold exposure.",

We used a global proteomic-based approach to analyze the expression alterations of proteins in artificial cold exposure (ACE)-induced hypertensive stroke in renovascular hypertensive rats (RHR) and to identify the biomarker of ACE-induced hypertensive stroke. METHODS: The RHR models were established by 2 kidney 2 clip methods. ACE treatment was achieved using an intelligent artificial climate cabinet. Blood pressure and neurologic symptoms were observed before and after ACE treatment. Hemorrhagic condition and infarction survey were examined using 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining. The total number of proteins derived from the cerebral tissue of the RHR models were analyzed with 2-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE), ImageMaster 2D Platinum software, and mass spectrometry. Significantly regulated proteins selected for further functional studies using the Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes/Proteins system were verified by Western blot. RESULTS: ACE-induced stroke in the RHR group (31.25%, 25 of 80 vs. 16.25%, 13 of 80; P < .05) but not in the sham-operated group. Following ACE treatment, we identified 37 differentially expressed proteins and 28 were unique. Two of the upregulated proteins, Syt1 and Idh3a, were obtained by bioinformatics analysis and verified by Western blot. CONCLUSIONS: The rate of morbidity as a result of stroke in RHR was obviously elevated after ACE treatment. ACE might affect protein expression profile in cerebral tissues of RHR. Syt1 and Idh3a may play a vital role in ACE-induced hypertensive stroke.",

After the blood pressure was stabilized, rats were maintained on a 12-h light (22°C)/dark (4°C) cycle (ACE group) or a 12-h light (22°C)/dark (22°C) cycle (NACE group) for 3 cycles. The results showed that ACE upregulated Ang II and MMP-9 protein levels in brains and aortas and considerably enhanced stroke incidence in 2K-2C rats. In contrast, doxycycline treatment prevented upregulation of MMP-9 protein expression and activity in brains and aortas in response to ACE and significantly decreased stroke incidence. These findings suggest that cold exposure-induced MMP-9 via activation of RAS might play a critical role in the initiation of cold exposure-induced stroke during chronic hypertension and doxycycline shows protective effects against cold exposure-induced stroke.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Supplementation with L-citrulline (L-cit) has shown attenuating effects on blood pressure (BP) and pulse-wave-reflection responses (augmentation index (AIx)) to local exposure to cold, but the potential cardioprotective effects of L-cit during whole-body cold exposure with concurrent exercise are poorly understood. We hypothesized that L-cit would attenuate the BP and AIx responses to cold exposure and isometric handgrip (IHG) exercise. METHODS: Sixteen healthy males with a mean age of 23±3 years volunteered for a study of the effect of L-cit on the BP and AIx responses to cold exposure and IHG exercise. Experiments were conducted inside an environmental chamber in cold conditions (4 ºC). Radial waveforms were obtained in duplicates and averaged through applanation tonometry. After 5 minutes of measurements made at rest in the supine position (RES), after the finalization of the exercise about the subjects were evaluated in non exercise condition that were basically the same as the RES. After initial measurements in cold conditions, subjects were randomized to receive either a placebo (Maltodextrin, PL) or L-cit (100mg/kg) for 14 days, followed by a 14-day washout period and then a 14-day regimen of the other agent. Subjects were re-evaluated after each treatment period. RESULTS: At RES, there was a significant treatment-by-time interaction for brachial systolic BP (BSBP; P < 0.01), aortic systolic BP (ASBP; P < 0.01), and AIx (P < 0.05), such that L-cit decreased BSBP (-11±2mm Hg; P < 0.01), ASBP (-10±2mm Hg; P < 0.05), and AIx (-2±2%; P < 0.05) as compared with their respective values before the intervention. During IHG, BSBP, ASBP, and AIx were increased (P < 0.05) as compared with their values at RES, but these responses were unaffected by either of the study treatments. CONCLUSIONS: L-citrulline may be a feasible adjuvant treatment for decrease the BP and AIx responses induced by cold. Further research is warranted to evaluate the impact of cold exposure and exercise on cardiovascular risk in clinical populations.",

In humans, the effects of cold exposure on circulating FGF21 levels are unknown. OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to evaluate the effects of mild cold exposure on circulating FGF21 and its relationship with CIT and lipolysis in humans. DESIGN AND SETTING: We conducted a randomized, single-blind, crossover intervention study at the National Institutes of Health Clinical Center. PARTICIPANTS: Participants were healthy adults. INTERVENTION: Subjects were exposed to a 12-h exposure to 24 or 19 C in a whole-room indirect calorimeter. OUTCOME MEASURES: Energy expenditure, plasma FGF 21, nonesterified fatty acid, and adipose tissue microdialysis glycerol concentrations were evaluated. RESULTS: At 24 C, plasma FGF21 exhibited a diurnal rhythm, peaking at 0800 h [110 (59-178) pg/ml], and progressively dropped to a nadir at 1700 h [41 (21-71) pg/ml, P < 0.0001] before rising at 1900 h [60 (11-81) pg/ml, P < 0.0001]. Exposure at 19 C lessened the diurnal reduction of FGF21 observed at 24 C from 0800-1700 h and augmented overall FGF21 levels by 37 ± 45% (P = 0.01). The change in area under the curve plasma FGF21 between 19 and 24 C correlated positively with the change in area under the curve adipose microdialysate glycerol (R(2) = 0.35, P = 0.04) but not with nonesterified fatty acid. Cold-induced increase in FGF21 predicted greater rise in energy expenditure during cold exposure (β = 0.66, P = 0.027), independent of age, gender, fat mass, and lean mass. CONCLUSIONS: Mild cold exposure increased circulating FGF21 levels, predicting greater lipolysis and CIT. A small reduction in environmental temperature is sufficient to modulate FGF21 diurnal rhythm in humans, which may mediate cold-induced metabolic changes similar to those in animals.",

METHODS: Seven male subjects (26.1 ± 2.4 yr) underwent pre-experimental testing to determine peak VO(2) and body composition. Participants underwent 3 trials in which they ingested the following for 1 week prior to each experimental trial: a capsule filled with cellulose (placebo), 81 mg · day(-1) of aspirin (low-dose aspirin), or 650 mg · day(-1) of aspirin (high-dose aspirin). Each trial consisted of a 30-minute baseline period, 120 minutes of exposure to 12°C air, and 120 minutes of recovery in 25°C air. Mean skin temperature and rectal temperature (T(re)) were measured, and heat production was calculated. RESULTS: During both acute cold exposure and rewarming, analysis of variance revealed a main effect for time (P < .05) with respect to T(re), mean skin temperature, and heat production. However, there were no significant differences between the treatments or treatment by time interactions. CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate that aspirin had no significant effect on the thermal and metabolic responses during acute cold exposure and rewarming.",

As in these animals, acute cold at 30days-old normalized leptinemia and restored the expression of hypothalamic leptin receptor (OBR), here we evaluate the effect of cold exposure on the thyroid function and OBR in adult rats programmed by neonatal hyperleptinemia. Pups were divided into 2 groups: Lep-injected with leptin (8μg/100g/BW, sc) for the first 10days of lactation, and C-injected with saline. At 150days, both groups were subdivided into: LepC and CC, which were exposed to 8°C for 12h. Serum leptin, TH, TSH, liver type I and brown adipose tissue (BAT) type II deiodinases (D1 and D2) activities, liver mitochondrial alpha-glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (mGPD) activity and adrenal catecholamine content were measured. Hypothalamic and thyroid OBR protein contents were evaluated. Differences were significant when p<0.05. Lep group had hyperleptinemia (+19%), higher T4 (+20%) and T3 (+30%) with lower TSH (-55%), higher liver D1 (1.4 fold-increase), lower BAT D2 (-44%) and liver mGPD activities (-55%), higher adrenal catecholamines (+44%), lower hypothalamic OBR (-51%) and normal thyroid OBR. Cold exposure normalized leptinemia, D1, mGPD, catecholamine and hypothalamic OBR. However, cold exposure further increased TH and decreased D2. Thus, cold exposure normalizes most of the changes programmed by neonatal hyperleptinemia, at the expense of worsening the hyperthyroidism and BAT thermogenesis.",

      "abstract": "The aim of this study was to fine-tune previous acute cold exposure treatments of broiler embryos during late embryogenesis to improve lifelong cold resistance and performance. Six hundred Cobb hatching eggs were incubated under standard conditions and then exposed to 3 treatments: control; cold treatment in which embryos were exposed to 15°C for 30 min on d 18 and 19 of incubation (30 × 2); and cold treatment similar to 30 × 2 but with 60-min exposures (60 × 2). Egg shell temperature (T(egg)) and heart rate (HR) were monitored pre- and posttreatment. Upon hatching, hatchability, body weight, and body temperature were recorded. From 14 to 35 d of age, three quarters of the chickens in each treatment were raised under ascites-inducing conditions (AIC) and the remaining birds were raised under standard brooding conditions (SBC). The T(egg) and HR decreased significantly in response to increased exposure time on d 18 of incubation. On d 19 of incubation, before the second cold exposure, the 30 × 2 group showed greater T(egg) and HR than the controls, and during the second exposure they maintained these parameters better than the 60 × 2 embryos. No treatment effect on hatchability was observed. At 35 d of age ascites incidence among 30 × 2 chickens under AIC was significantly less than that among the controls (P < 0.01), and body weight of these chickens under either SBC or AIC was significantly higher than that of the controls. Under SBC relative breast muscle weight was significantly higher in 60 × 2 chickens, whereas the relative heart weight was higher in both cold-treated groups than in the controls. It can be concluded that repeated short acute cold exposures during late embryogenesis significantly reduced ascites incidence and improved growth rate under either SBC or AIC. These results may be related to a prenatal epigenetic adaptation of the thermoregulatory and cardiovascular systems to low ambient temperature.",

Whole body protein synthesis (WBPS) was calculated with the [2H5]Phe model. Eight adult sheep were assigned to two dietary treatments receiving the same amount of crude protein and either 515 or 828 kJ x kg BW(-0.75) x d(-1) of ME (Me-ME diet and Hi-ME diet, respectively) with a crossover design for two 28 d periods. The sheep were exposed from a thermoneutral environment (23 +/- 1 degrees C) to a cold environment (2 +/- 1 to 4 +/- 1 degrees C) for 6 d for each dietary treatment. The primed-continuous infusion method of isotope dilution was conducted in both environmental temperatures. Plasma Phe turnover rate (PheTR) tended to be greater and plasma Tyr turnover rate (TyrTR) was greater (p = 0.03) for the Hi-ME diet compared with the Me-ME diet. Plasma PheTR increased (p = 0.04) and plasma TyrTR tended to increase during cold exposure. Whole body protein synthesis tended to be greater for the Hi-ME diet compared with the Me-ME diet and increased (p = 0.03) during cold exposure compared to the thermoneutral environment, but no interaction was detected. It was concluded that in sheep, plasma PheTR and WBPS (as determined by the [2H5]Phe model) tended to be influenced by and plasma TyrTR was influenced by ME intake. Further, plasma PheTR and WBPS increased and plasma TyrTR tended to increase during cold exposure.",

Hardly any information is available about the influence of diet composition in the first days on later life and additionally, effects of early feeding on thermoregulatory development are also not known. The aim of this study was to investigate effects of diet composition in early fed broiler chickens on their (thermoregulatory) development. Shortly after hatch, 200 Hybro chickens (initial BW of 43.6 g) were assigned to 1 of 5 feed treatments: control, dextrose, albumen, prestarter, or prestarter plus fat. Water was available ad libitum. Measurements were done in 10 replicates of 4 chickens per treatment. At d 2 or 3, half of the chickens were exposed to 20 degrees C for 30 min to determine resistance against cold exposure and rectal temperature was determined just before, immediately after, and 30 min after the end of this cold exposure. Thereafter, all chickens were killed to investigate body development. Chickens in both prestarter groups developed faster than in the other 3 groups, expressed by a higher BW, yolk-free body mass, heart and liver weight, and higher chick and intestine length. Between d 2 and 3, differences in these variables among chickens from both prestarter groups and other groups increased. Rectal temperature before cold exposure was higher in chickens from both prestarter groups (40.6 and 40.7 degrees C, respectively) and decreased less (0.6 and 0.7 degrees C, respectively) during cold exposure than in chickens from the control (39.5 and 1.2 degrees C, respectively) and albumen group (39.8 and 2.1 degrees C, respectively), whereas chickens from the dextrose group were in between (40.4 and 1.2 degrees C, respectively). We conclude that early fed diet composition in broiler chickens is (besides general development) important for development of both body temperature and resistance against cold exposure, probably as a reflection of a changed metabolic rate.",

We investigated the impact of cold-exposure (4 degrees C) and recovery (26 degrees C) on the cell cycle activity of the Plodia interpunctella Lepidoptera cell line IAL-PID2 and on the expression of B-type cyclin (PcycB), ecdysone receptor (B1-isoform; PiEcR-B1), and Hsc70 (PiHsc70) mRNA. Cold-exposure significantly reduced expression of these mRNAs, while their levels increased to above control values during subsequent recovery at the normal growth temperature. When cold-exposed cells were returned to 26 degrees C, cell cycle activity restarted, but apoptosis was strongly increased. The presence of 20E appeared to increase this apoptotic phenomenon. This result is consistent with the described protective role of 20E against a variety of stressors and with the capacity of 20E to induce cell death in different situations. Here, we illustrate for the first time a connection between 20E treatment and Hsc70 expression during cold-exposure and subsequent recovery in insect cells. Combined with the 20E-induced apoptotic response, our results suggest that regulation of Hsc70 expression by 20E could act in synergy with the control of apoptotic cell death in order to optimize the survival of specific cell populations after a period of cold-exposure.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To investigate how winter acclimatization (WA), exogenous melatonin (MEL) or endogenous melatonin (SD) affect plasma leptin and ghrelin concentrations and how leptin and ghrelin contribute to the regulation of different adaptations to wintering in the Siberian hamster. RESULTS: The plasma leptin and insulin and testicular testosterone concentrations were lower in the WA, MEL and SD groups, whereas the plasma ghrelin concentration was higher due to the WA treatment. In the treated hamsters, body temperatures during photo- and scotophase were lower throughout the study and torpor bouts were observed. The absolute and relative body fat masses were lower in all treated groups. CONCLUSIONS: Siberian hamsters reduce their feeding in winter, although just the opposite is suggested by the lower leptin concentrations in all treated groups and the higher ghrelin concentration in the WA group. The positive correlation between plasma leptin and testicular testosterone indicates a possible interaction between them. Torpor bouts were related to a lowered body mass and plasma leptin concentration. Exposure to short photoperiod did not induce elevated plasma ghrelin levels; the response required a low ambient temperature together with short day length.",

      "abstract": "Chronic stress exposure alters the central noradrenergic neurons originating from the locus coeruleus (LC). Previously, we demonstrated that evoked increases in the firing rate of LC neurons and their release of norepinephrine are enhanced following chronic cold exposure. In the present studies, we tested the hypothesis that reduced feedback inhibition of LC neurons might underlie these alterations in LC activity by examining the effect of alpha(2)-autoreceptor stimulation on LC activity in chronically stressed rats using in vivo and in vitro single unit recordings. Given that regulators of G-protein signaling (RGS) proteins can impact the coupling of alpha(2)-autoreceptors to downstream signaling cascades, we also explored the expression of several RGS proteins following chronic stress exposure. We observed that the alpha(2)-autoreceptor-evoked inhibition of LC neurons was reduced and that the expression of RGS7 was increased following chronic stress exposure. Finally, we demonstrated that intracellular administration of RGS7 via patch clamp electrodes mimicked the stress-induced decrease in clonidine-evoked autoreceptor-mediated inhibition. These novel data provide a mechanism to explain how chronic stress-induced alterations in receptor coupling can result in changes in alpha(2)-autoreceptor control of noradrenergic function throughout the central nervous system, potentially leading to alterations in anxiety-related behaviors, and may suggest novel therapeutic targets for the treatment of mood and anxiety disorders.",

We observed significant differences in basal cold tolerance between the strains and among larval stages. Early larval instars were generally more tolerant of acute cold exposures than third-instar larvae. However, wandering larvae were more tolerant of chronic cold exposures than the other stages. Early stages also displayed a more pronounced rapid cold-hardening response than the later stages. Heat pre-treatment did not confer a significant increase in cold tolerance to any of the strains at any stage, pointing to different mechanisms being involved in resolving heat- and cold-elicited damage. However, when heat pre-treatment was combined with rapid cold-hardening as sequential pre-treatments, both positive (heat first) and negative (heat second) effects on cold tolerance were observed. We discuss possible mechanisms underlying cold-hardening and the effects of acute and chronic cold exposures.",

As both thyroid hormones (TH) and leptin increased thermogenesis, it was interesting to evaluate the effect of cold exposure on the thyroid function of neonate rats treated with leptin. Pups were divided into two groups: Lep, injected with leptin (8 mug/100 g/BW, s.c.) for the first 10 days of lactation and control (C), injected with saline. When they were 30 days old, the groups were subdivided into two subgroups: LepC and CC, which were exposed to 8 degrees C for 12 h and compared with C and Lep groups, maintained at 25 +/- 1 degrees C. Serum leptin, TH, and TSH were measured by RIA. Type I liver deiodinase (D1) and mitochondrial alpha-glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (mGPD) activities were assayed by the release of (125)I from (125)I-reverse and colorimetric method respectively. Leptin receptor (OB-Rb) was evaluated by western blot. Lep group had hyperleptinemia (+22%) and lower free tri-iodothyronine (FT(3); -33%). Cold exposure increased TH both in LepC and CC groups compared with respective controls free thyroxine (FT(4):+63 and +39%; FT(3):+75 and +40%). Liver D1 activity was lower in Lep (-22%) and increased with cold exposure (LepC +51% and CC +22%). The mGPD activity was lower in Lep (-34%) and increased (fourfold) when this group is cold exposed. Hypothalamic and thyroidal OB-Rb receptors were lower in Lep group (-47 and -36% respectively) and they were restored to normal levels after cold exposure. Leptin-programmed rats had higher TH response after cold exposure. OB-Rb had a fast response to cold exposure normalizing the lower levels observed in the leptin-programmed animals and may contribute to the higher TH cold responses.",

The cold treatment increased the number of c-Fos-immunoreactive cells in the paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus (PVN) and arcuate nucleus (ARC). At the same time it decreased the density of NPY-immunoreactive components in the PVN, dorsomedial hypothalamic nucleus and ARC, as well as of NPY transcripts in the PVN and ARC.

Theoretically, supplementation with exogenous antioxidants might support the endogenous antioxidant system, thereby reducing oxidative damage, ageing-related functional decline and prolonging life- and health-span. Yet supplementation trials with antioxidants in animal models have had minimal success. Human epidemiological data are similarly unimpressive, leading some to question whether vitamin C, for example, might have pro-oxidant properties in vivo. We supplemented cold exposed (7+/-2 degrees C) female C57BL/6 mice over their lifespan with vitamin C (ascorbyl-2-polyphosphate), widely advocated and self administered to reduce oxidative stress, retard ageing and increase healthy lifespan. No effect on mean or maximum lifespan following vitamin C treatment or any significant impact on body mass, or on parameters of energy metabolism was observed. Moreover, no differences in hepatocyte and lymphocyte DNA oxidative damage or hepatic lipid peroxidation was seen between supplemented and control mice. Using a DNA macroarray specific for oxidative stress-related genes, we found that after 18 months of supplementation, mice exhibited a significantly reduced expression of several genes in the liver linked to free-radical scavenging, including Mn-superoxide dismutase. We confirmed these effects by Northern blotting and found additional down-regulation of glutathione peroxidase (not present on macroarray) in the vitamin C treated group. We suggest that high dietary doses of vitamin C are ineffective at prolonging lifespan in mice because any positive benefits derived as an antioxidant are offset by compensatory reductions in endogenous protection mechanisms, leading to no net reduction in accumulated oxidative damage.",

METHODS: Participants in this study included 6 men and 5 women between the ages of 19 and 25 years. Each subject performed 2 cold-air trials (CATs) consisting of a 30-minute baseline (BASE) period and a 120-minute exposure to 10 degree C air. One CAT was performed after a nicotine (NIC) dosing using a 21-mg transdermal patch, whereas the other CAT was performed after a placebo (PL) treatment. Blood samples for metabolic and hormonal measurements were obtained at the end of BASE and immediately after the cold exposure. RESULTS: When examining the sexes separately, there was no difference in norepinephrine between PL and NIC (P = .066). There was also no difference in epinephrine between PL and NIC in either sex (P = .634). From BASE to 120 minutes of the CAT, there was a significant decrease in cortisol (P = .036), but this response was similar between the 2 treatments (P = .077). Glucose and glycerol concentrations were not different between the PL and NIC treatments. At BASE, nonesterified fatty acid (NEFA) concentration was lower during PL compared with NIC (P = .021); however, at 120 minutes of the CAT, NEFA was greater during PL compared with NIC (P = .035). CONCLUSIONS: During 120 minutes of cold exposure, NIC resulted in alterations in the responses in NEFA, whereas the other blood measurements were not significantly different between the 2 groups.",

      "abstract": "Clozapine, an atypical antipsychotic agent important for the treatment of schizophrenia, has marked inhibitory effects on sympathetic outflow to the thermoregulatory cutaneous circulation. In rabbits clozapine reverses ear pinna vasoconstriction induced either by administration of MDMA (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine, ecstasy) or by exposing the animal to a cold environment. In rats, both these procedures are known to increase sympathetic activation of interscapular brown adipose tissue (iBAT) thermogenesis, important for heat production in the rat. In the present study in conscious rats we determined whether clozapine reduces iBAT thermogenesis induced by MDMA and by exposure to cold. We designed our study so that we could also determine effects of clozapine on the acute (stress-induced) increases in iBAT thermogenesis initiated by the process of s.c. injection. MDMA increased iBAT temperature (+1.7+/-0.2 degrees C after 90 min, P<0.01, n=14 measurements from seven rats each studied on two occasions). Clozapine acutely reversed the MDMA-elicited increase in iBAT temperature (-1.3+/-0.2 degrees C 60 min after clozapine treatment following MDMA versus +0.3+/-0.2 degrees C for 60 min after vehicle treatment following MDMA, P<0.01, n=7). Clozapine also reduced stress-induced increases in iBAT temperature, as well as increases elicited by exposing rats to a cold (5 degrees C) environment. Results, taken together with our previous findings, suggest that MDMA activates the sympathetic thermoregulatory outputs (including the output to iBAT) that defend body temperature against cold exposure and that increase body temperature in response to environmental stress. Clozapine's marked inhibition of iBAT thermogenesis may provide a clue to its marked tendency to cause obesity when used to treat humans with mental disorders including schizophrenia. Our demonstration in rats that clozapine decreases sympathetically-mediated increases in iBAT temperature elicited by MDMA adds to the likelihood that clozapine and clozapine-like agents might be therapeutically effective in life threatening hyperthermia induced by MDMA in humans.",
