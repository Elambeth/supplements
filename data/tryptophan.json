      "abstract": "The complex radiosynthesis of alpha-[11C]methyl-L-tryptophan ([11C]AMT) involves harsh chemicals and conditions, posing challenges for its implementation on commercially available synthesis modules. This study describes the adaptation of the GE TRACERlab FX2 C module for [11C]AMT production using both a half-manual approach and a semi-automated method incorporating a 16-way valve system. [11C]AMT was synthesized with decay-corrected radiochemical yields of 13 ± 7.5 % (half-manual) and 10.4 ± 4.1 % (semi-automated), with radiochemical purities exceeding 95 %. The half-manual approach demonstrated higher reliability in synthesis success but required increased operator intervention, while the semi-automated method minimized radiation exposure to the operator. Key factors influencing synthesis success included the preparation and precise addition of lithium diisopropylamide and the use of a soda lime column to mitigate iodine contamination during [11C]CH3I transfer. This work presents a practical and scalable solution for producing [11C]AMT on a commercially available module, enabling its broader application in clinical research, particularly in brain imaging and pediatric oncology."

      "abstract": "UNLABELLED: Anemia is among the most commonly reported adverse events of anticancer therapy. Picolinic acid (PA), an endogenous metabolite of tryptophan degradation in the kynurenine pathway, is a metal chelator with an anticancer activity. The objective of the current study is to investigate the modulation of red blood cell (RBC) lifespan by PA. Hemolytic and eryptotic markers were evaluated in the presence and absence of PA by photometric and flow cytometric methods. PA demonstrated a dual effect on hemolysis in which it was pro-hemolytic in isotonic media but anti-hemolytic under hypotonic challenge. PA also induced RBC senescence with reduced AChE activity. In addition, treated cells tested positive for annexin-V and Fluo4 and had a significantly lower forward scatter signal. Notably, ATP-replenished cells showed significantly enhanced chemoresistance against PA toxicity, which was also alleviated by ascorbic acid, L-NAME, SB203580, D4476, and necrosulfonamide. Furthermore, an inhibitory effect on PA was observed in incubation media supplemented with isosmotic sucrose but not urea. These data suggest that PA accelerates RBC aging through anticholinesterase activity and exhibits hemolytic and eryptotic properties characterized by phosphatidylserine externalization, Ca2+ mobilization, cell shrinkage, metabolic shutdown, and stimulation of the NOS/p38 MAPK/CK1α/MLKL pathway.

This study evaluated the neuroprotective effect of Limosilactobacillus reuteri (L. reuteri) DSM 17938 on SCI and its potential anti-inflammatory mechanism. The intestinal microbiota was disorganised following SCI, with a significant decrease in the abundance of probiotic bacteria such as L. reuteri. L. reuteri DSM17938 treatment improved the spinal cord pathology and enhanced locomotor functional recovery in SCI-model rats. Moreover, it modulated tryptophan metabolism by promoting indole-3-carboxaldehyde production. In addition, L. reuteri DSM17938 inhibits polarization of M1 microglia and reduces the production of IL-6, IL-1 β, and TNF-α in spinal cord injury to alleviate neuroinflammation. It also activates aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) signalling via upregulating AhR and CYP1A1 expression, promoting tight junction protein synthesis. In summary, L. reuteri DSM17938 promotes SCI recovery by modulating tryptophan metabolism to activate AhR signalling and intestinal barrier repair to attenuate spinal cord M1 microglial activation and neuroinflammation, suggesting a strategy for clinical adjuvant SCI treatment."

Early studies identified altered Trp utilization in cancer cells favoring cancer survival and growth. Seminal findings linking Trp metabolism and suppression of immunity led to an explosion of interest ultimately culminating in clinical trials targeting these pathways in melanoma. The failure of these trials led to a clinical retreat in this approach; however, recent insights into the complex interplay of the various Trp circuits and between tumor cells, immune cells, and the microbiota have shown that reconsideration of Trp metabolism is needed. Here, we discuss recent developments in our understanding of Trp metabolism and apparent contradictions in the field. We also discuss adaptations that occur when Trp pathways are manipulated, which may impact therapy responses."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Migraine is a common neurological disorder in children, significantly impacting quality of life and academic performance. The kynurenine pathway, a major metabolic route of tryptophan, plays a critical role in neuroinflammation and neurotransmission, yet its involvement in pediatric migraine remains unexplored. This study aims to investigate alterations in kynurenine pathway metabolites in children with migraine and assess their correlation with headache frequency and severity. METHODS: A case-control study was conducted including pediatric patients diagnosed with migraine (n = 45) and healthy controls (n = 48). Serum levels of tryptophan (TRP) and its kynurenine pathway metabolites-including kynurenine (KYN), kynurenic acid (KYNA), 3-hydroxykynurenine (3-HK), and 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid (3-HANA)-were quantified using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The Pediatric Migraine Disability Assessment (PedMIDAS) scores were used to evaluate the functional impact of migraine. Statistical analyses included comparisons between groups and correlation assessments between metabolite levels and clinical parameters. RESULTS: KYN, KYNA, and the KYN/TRP ratio were significantly higher in the migraine group compared to controls (p < 0.05). KYNA/3-HK ratios showed a negative correlation with headache frequency and PedMIDAS scores, whereas 3-HK levels were positively correlated with PedMIDAS scores. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis identified KYN as a potential biomarker for distinguishing migraine patients from controls, with a sensitivity of 86.7 % and specificity of 45.8 % at a cutoff value of 1415. CONCLUSION: This study is the first to evaluate kynurenine pathway metabolites in pediatric migraine. The findings suggest that alterations in the tryptophan-kynurenine pathway, particularly increased KYN and KYNA levels, may serve as compensatory mechanisms in migraine pathophysiology. Future studies should explore the therapeutic implications of targeting the kynurenine pathway in pediatric migraine treatment."

      "abstract": "Elevated brain levels of the essential metals manganese (Mn), copper, or iron induce motor disease. However, mechanisms of metal-induced motor disease are unclear and treatments are lacking. Elucidating the mechanisms of Mn-induced motor disease is particularly important because occupational and environmental Mn overexposure is a global public health problem. To address this, here we combined unbiased transcriptomics and metabolomics with functional studies in a mouse model of human environmental Mn exposure. Transcriptomics unexpectedly revealed that Mn exposure up-regulated expression of metabolic pathways in the brain and liver. Notably, genes in the kynurenine pathway of tryptophan metabolism, which produces neuroactive metabolites that impact neurological function, were up-regulated by Mn. Subsequent unbiased metabolomics revealed that Mn treatment altered kynurenine pathway metabolites in the brain and liver. Functional experiments then demonstrated that pharmacological inhibition of the first and rate-limiting step of the kynurenine pathway fully rescued Mn-induced motor deficits. Finally, elevated Mn directly activates hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) transcription factors, and additional mechanistic assays identified a role for HIF1, but not HIF2, in regulating expression of hepatic kynurenine pathway genes under physiological or Mn exposure conditions, suggesting that Mn-induced HIF1 activation may contribute to the dysregulation of the kynurenine pathway in Mn toxicity. These findings (1) identify the upregulation of the kynurenine pathway by elevated Mn as a fundamental mechanism of Mn-induced motor deficits; (2) provide a pharmacological approach to treat Mn-induced motor disease; and (3) should broadly advance understanding of the general principles underlying neuromotor deficits caused by metal toxicity.",

      "abstract": "Clinical nutritional support is recognized by Klinefner's Surgery as one of the four pivotal advancements in surgical practice during the 20th century. Surgeons regard clinical nutrition as a \"life-saving\" discipline, pivotal in preserving the lives of numerous critically ill patients and facilitating the success of many surgical procedures. Parenteral nutrition (PN) support serves as a crucial component of clinical nutritional therapy, while a range of complications associated with total parenteral nutrition (TPN) can significantly undermine the efficacy of patient treatment. Impaired intestinal homeostasis is strongly associated with the occurrence and progression of TPN-related infections, yet the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. In this study, RNA sequencing and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq) revealed that reduced secretion of interleukin-22 (IL-22) by intestinal Group 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3s) is a significant factor contributing to the onset of TPN-related infections. Additionally, through 16S ribosomal RNA (16S rRNA) gene sequencing of the gut microbiota from patients with chronic intestinal failure and metagenomic sequencing analysis of the gut microbiota from mice, we observed that TPN reduced the abundance of Lactobacillus murinus (L. murinus), while supplementation with L. murinus could promote IL-22 secretion by ILC3s. Mechanistically, L. murinus upregulates indole-3-carboxylic acid, which activates the nuclear receptor Rorγt to stimulate IL-22 secretion by ILC3s. This pathway strengthens gut barrier integrity and reduces infection susceptibility. Our findings enhance our understanding of the mechanisms driving the onset of TPN-related infections, highlighting the critical role of gut microbiota in maintaining immune homeostasis and improving clinical outcomes."

      "abstract": "Probiotics emerges as a promising option for ulcerative colitis (UC) treatment, but its application remains challenging due to insufficient colon-targeted delivery efficiency and survival against the inflammation-associated intestinal oxidative stress. To address these issues, here we report a supramolecular liposome-microgel complex (SLMC) incorporated with Bacillus subtilis spores (BSSs) and dexamethasone (DEX) for orally-deliverable probiotic UC therapy. Specifically, BSSs and cholesterols were conjugated with gelatin via diselenide ligation to prepare microgels, followed by supramolecular complexation with UC-targeted DEX-loaded liposome via microfluidic engineering. The orally-administered SLMC efficiently accumulated in UC-affected colonic sites to release BSSs and DEX. DEX elicited rapid anti-inflammatory effect to reduce ROS generation, which cooperated with the ROS consumption by spore germination and diselenide cleavage to orchestrate an anaerobic intestinal microenvironment, thus promoting Bacillus subtilis colonization to restore gut homeostasis and initiate anti-inflammatory microbiota-macrophage metabolic crosstalk. Indeed, in vivo analysis showed that the SLMC treatment markedly inhibited pro-inflammatory TLR4-NF-κB signaling activities in mucosal macrophages through localized DEX delivery and boosting tryptophan metabolite production, leading to robust and durable UC abolishment. This study offers a practical approach for improving UC treatment in the clinic."

      "abstract": "Tryptophan (TRP) metabolism produces various neuroactive substances in the gastrointestinal tract, as well as in the central and peripheral nervous systems and intestinal microbiota. Initially centered on the serotonin pathway in TRP metabolism and TRP itself, many studies are now focusing on the kynurenine pathway, with an increasing interest in the indole pathway. Several TRP metabolites have been associated with migraines, suggesting that TRP metabolism may serve as a potential therapeutic target. However, these studies have significant limitations, including a small number of participants, a lack of standardized diets prior to and/or during clinical trials, and insufficient information regarding the transformation of TRP after its intake. Furthermore, no thorough study encompasses all the essential components of TRP metabolism: products, enzymes, receptors, and transporters. Different mechanisms may explain the involvement of TRP metabolism in migraines, including glutamate signaling and neurovasodilatory, immune, oxidative, and inflammatory processes. The results of studies on the role of TRP metabolism in migraine may be helpful for making dietary recommendations for migraine prevention and clinical management; however, individual characteristics for metabolizing TRP should be considered. The aim of this narrative perspective review is to critically present the results of studies on the role of TRP metabolism in migraine and explore their implications for migraine prevention and therapy. Unlike many other reviews that focus solely on either the serotonin or kynurenine pathway, our paper addresses all three primary TRP metabolism pathways."

Nevertheless, the effect of Trp metabolism (Trp metabolism)-related genes Trp metabolism-related genes on laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC) progression is not yet clear. So, in this study, the TCGA-LSCC, GSE27020, and 40 TMRGs were extracted via public databases to explore the effects of TMRGs on laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma. Firstly, Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) was adopted with LSCC samples in TCGA-LSCC to acquire key module, and differentially expressed genes between LSCC and normal samples from TCGA-LSCC were yielded via differential expression analysis. Next, differentially expressed TMRGs (DE-TMRGs) was obtained in key model and DEGs, and prognostic genes were identifde through multiple algorithms. Five prognostic genes, namely SERPINA1, TMC8, RENBP, SDS and FAM107A were finally identified. A risk model was established based on the expressions of prognostic genes and survival information of LSCC samples while that were divided into high and low risk groups. Obviously, the LSCC immune dysfunction and exclusion score of high-risk patients was dramatically higher than that in low-risk patients, indicating that patients in the high-risk subgroup exhibited reduced responsiveness to immunotherapy. Besides, the drug sensitivity analysis showed that the low -risk subgroup was notably sensitive to Salubrinal, Lenalidomide, Metformin, while high -risk subgroup was more responsive to Docetaxel, AUY922, Embelin. Eventually, two clusters of LSCC samples had notable correlations with LSCC prognosis. The above results indicated that the risk model consisted of TMRGs (SERPINA1, TMC8, RENBP, SDS and FAM107A) was constructed in LSCC, contributing to studies related to the prognosis and treatment of LSCC."

Tryptophan (Trp) and vitamin A (retinol, Ret) are known to influence the immune response of DCs to gliadin and increase their tolerogenicity. CD4 + CD25 + Foxp3 + regulatory T cells (Tregs), which are important for immune tolerance, can be generated from naive T cells in the presence of retinoic acid (RA) and TGF-β.The aim of this study was to determine the combined effect of Ret and Trp in altering the phenotypic and functional maturation of DCs by gliadin and their contribution to the differentiation of Tregs. Monocyte cells derived from the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of patients with celiac disease were differentiated into DCs and stimulated with PT-gliadin. These cells were then treated with Trp + Ret. The expression of CD11c, CD14, CD83, CD86, PDL1, CD4, CD25 and FOXP3 was examined using flow cytometry. TGF-β, IL-10, IL-12, and TNF-α levels were measured by ELISA. qRT-PCR was used to quantify the mRNA levels of retinaldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (RALDH2), integrin αE (CD103), and NF-κB. Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) mRNA and protein levels were assessed using qRT-PCR and Western blot assays, respectively. The maturation of DCs by PT-gliadin was defined through co-stimulatory molecule expression (CD83 and CD86) and promotion of TNF-α and IL-12 secretion. We found that after treatment with Ret + Trp, the production levels of IL-12, TNF-α, and NF-κB were significantly reduced, while the expression of IL-10, TGF-β, and the inhibitory markers PDL1, CD103, IDO, and RALDH2 by PT-gliadin-stimulated DCs was significantly increased. Furthermore, in a DC and T cell co-culture system, treatment of DCs with Ret + Trp increased TGF-β expression in DCS and promoted CD4 + CD25 + FOXP3 Treg induction. These results indicate the potential benefit of vitamin A and tryptophan as therapeutic options for individuals with celiac disease. Further research is required to fully understand the mechanisms of action of these substances in these cells."

      "abstract": "AIM: Recent pre-clinical evidence suggests that the tryptophan metabolite 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid (3-HAA) and the related enzyme activity along the kynurenine metabolic pathway (KP) are associated with lifespan extension. We aimed to translate these findings into humans and expose exercise training as a potential non-pharmacological intervention to modulate this metabolic hub. METHODS: To explore whether recent pre-clinical findings might also be of relevance for humans, we analyzed the evolutionary conservation of KYNU and HAAO, the two core KP enzymes associated with 3-HAA. In a cross-sectional analysis of young-to-middle-aged adults (N = 84), we examined potential associations of serum 3-HAA and its precursor anthranilic acid with age. We then investigated whether 26 weeks of endurance exercise (increasing intensity (INC) during the intervention period (n = 17) vs. conventional moderate continuous training (CON) matched for energy expenditure (n = 17)) impacted 3-HAA levels, related metabolic ratios, and other KP metabolites. RESULTS: We demonstrate that the core KP enzymes associated with 3-HAA are evolutionarily conserved in humans. Serum 3-HAA and its precursor anthranilic acid were consistently associated with age in young-to-middle-aged adults. Both exercise modes tested induced an increase in 3-HAA levels of 134% (p < 0.001) and 85% (p < 0.001) compared with baseline, respectively, without a significant time*group interaction effect. CONCLUSION: We translate the association between systemic 3-HAA levels and age from animal models into humans and highlight longer-term exercise training as an efficient strategy to boost systemic 3-HAA levels in middle-aged adults. Our findings open promising research avenues concerning the mediating role of 3-HAA in training adaptations, health, and longevity.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Compulsive-like rigidity may be associated with hyposerotonergia and increased kynurenine (KYN) pathway activity. Conversion of tryptophan (TRP) to kynurenine (KYN), which may contribute to hyposerotonergia, is bolstered by inflammation, and could be related to altered gut microbiota composition. Here, we studied these mechanisms in a naturalistic animal model of compulsive-like behavioural rigidity, i.e., large nest building (LNB) in deer mice (Peromyscus sp.). METHODS: Twenty-four (24) normal nest building (NNB)- and 24 LNB mice (both sexes) were chronically administered either escitalopram (a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor; 50 mg/kg/day) or a control solution, with nesting behaviour analysed before and after intervention. After endpoint euthanising, frontal cortices and striata were analysed for TRP and its metabolites, plasma for microbiota derived lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and its binding protein (LBP), and stool samples for microbial DNA. RESULTS: LNB, but not NNB, decreased after escitalopram exposure. At baseline, LNB associated with reduced frontal cortical TRP concentrations and hyposerotonergia that was unrelated to altered KYN pathway activity. In LNB mice, escitalopram significantly increased frontal-cortical and striatal TRP without altering serotonin concentrations. Treated LNB, compared to untreated LNB- and treated NNB mice, had significantly reduced plasma LPS as well as a microbiome showing a decreased inferred potential to synthesise short-chain fatty acids and degrade TRP. CONCLUSION: These findings support the role of altered serotonergic mechanisms, inflammatory processes, and gut microbiome involvement in compulsive-like behavioural rigidity. Our results also highlight the importance of gut-brain crosstalk mechanisms at the level of TRP metabolism in the spontaneous development of such behaviour."

      "abstract": "Children born to women with HIV (WWH) suffer increased morbidity and, in low-income settings, have two to three times the mortality of infants born to women without HIV. The basis for this increase remains elusive. In low-income settings, breastfeeding is recommended because health benefits outweigh the risk of transmission, especially when maternal antiretroviral therapy is provided. We profiled the milk metabolome of 326 women sampled longitudinally for 18 months postpartum using global metabolomics. We identify perturbations in several metabolites, including tryptophan, dimethylarginine, and a recently discovered antiviral ribonucleotide, that are robustly associated with maternal HIV infection. Quantitative tryptophan and kynurenine levels in both milk and plasma reveal that these perturbations reflect systemic depletion of tryptophan and alterations in tryptophan catabolism in WWH. Our findings provide intriguing evidence that decreases in tryptophan availability and perturbations in tryptophan catabolism in children born to WWH may contribute to their increased morbidity and mortality."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Preeclampsia (PE) is a life-threatening condition that is unique to human pregnancy, and it is a leading cause of maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality. Currently, the only definitive treatment for PE is delivery of the placenta. Several studies have suggested that the gut microbiota and its derived metabolites may be associated with PE. Our previous work indicated that the level of indole-3-lactic acid (ILA), which is a metabolite derived from tryptophan (Trp) metabolism in the gut, is increased in PE patients. However, the effects of ILA on trophoblast function and its underlying mechanisms remain largely unknown. METHODS: Transwell assays were conducted to assess the effects of ILA on trophoblast migration and invasion. Moreover, the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) signaling pathway was examined by qRT-PCR, western blotting and siRNA transfection. Additionally, RNA-seq analysis was performed to explore the mechanism underlying the ILA-mediated effects on trophoblast function. Finally, in vivo trophoblast invasion was evaluated through immunohistochemical analysis. RESULTS: Our data demonstrated that ILA promoted HTR-8/SVneo cell migration and invasion through AhR signaling pathway activation. Mechanistically, VCAN upregulation played a key role in mediating the effects of ILA on trophoblasts after AhR activation. Notably, ILA supplementation improved spiral artery remodeling and increased trophoblast invasion in PE-like mice, primarily by increasing VCAN levels. CONCLUSIONS: These data strongly suggest that elevated ILA in PE serve as a protective mechanism against trophoblast dysfunction. Therefore, we propose that ILA may be a novel and promising therapeutic approach for treating PE by enhancing trophoblast functions."

Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10), magnesium, and tryptophan are associated with FM symptoms, but their combined effects in this condition are poorly understood. The objective of the study was to assess the effects of CoQ10, tryptophan, and magnesium supplementation in patients with FM. This single-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, two-period, two-sequence crossover study included adult patients diagnosed with FM for at least two years. The study comprised two periods of three months each, and a one-month washout period between them. Participants were randomized to receive the dietary supplement or placebo. The primary endpoint was the change in the item fatigue of the combined index of fibromyalgia impact in patients (ICAF). Secondary outcomes included changes in the remaining ICAF factors and items and in the total score. Of 110 enrolled patients, 89 (mean age: 51.0 years; 96.6% women) completed the study. Most participants (94.4%) were on pharmacological treatment for FM. Fatigue improved significantly in the placebo group, with a non-significant reduction in the dietary supplement group. Pain intensity significantly decreased in both groups, while sleep quality and functional impact showed a significant reduction in the dietary supplement group. The ICAF total score improved significantly after 3 months of receiving the dietary supplement. Adverse events (n = 35) were mild and homogenously distributed between groups. The dietary supplement was efficacious in improving physical aspects of FM, including pain, sleep quality, and impact, and showed good tolerability.",

However, the metabolic changes upon macrophage activation remain elusive. Methods: We established an in vitro activation model of porcine macrophages and investigated alterations in metabolites involved in polyamine and tryptophan metabolism upon activation by various toll-like receptor (TLR) activators. Results: TLR activation inhibits the production of spermine and alters the kynurenine pathway of the tryptophan metabolism toward the kynurenic acid biosynthesis. Specifically, TLR9 activation redirects the metabolic pathway of tryptophan toward kynurenic acid synthesis, which subsequently inhibits melatonin production via the protein kinase A (PKA)/cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)/cAMP-responsive element-binding protein (CREB) signaling pathways. Conclusions: TLR activation reprograms the polyamine and tryptophan metabolism in porcine macrophages. Knowledge of the metabolic alterations in polyamine and tryptophan upon TLR activation in macrophages offers valuable insights and potential strategies for nutritional intervention to enhance piglet immunity."

However, they are also involved in a variety of other mechanisms, such as energy homeostasis, nitrogen exchange, further synthesis of bioactive compounds, production of nucleotides, or activation of signaling pathways. Moreover, amino acids and their metabolites have immunoregulatory properties, significantly affecting the behavior of immune cells. Immunotherapy is one of the oncological treatment methods that improves cytotoxic properties of one's own immune system. Thus, enzymes catalyzing amino acid metabolism, together with metabolites themselves, can affect immune antitumor properties and responses to immunotherapy. In this review, we will discuss the involvement of tryptophan, glutamine, and asparagine metabolism in the behavior of immune cells targeted by immunotherapy and summarize results of the most recent investigations on the impact of amino acid metabolites on immunotherapy."

      "abstract": "Tryptophan (Trp) is an essential amino acid that must be acquired exclusively through dietary intake. The metabolism of tryptophan plays a critical role in maintaining immune homeostasis and tolerance, as well as in preventing excessive inflammatory responses. Tryptophan-2,3-dioxygenase (TDO2) is a tetrameric heme protein and serves as one of the pivotal rate-limiting enzymes in the first step of tryptophan metabolism. Dysregulation of TDO2 expression has been observed in various digestive system diseases, encompassing those related to the oral cavity, esophagus, liver, stomach, pancreas, and colon and rectum. Digestive system diseases are the most common clinical diseases, with complex clinical manifestations and interrelated symptoms, and have become a research hotspot in the field of medicine. Studies have demonstrated that aberrant TDO2 expression is closely associated with various clinical manifestations and disease outcomes in patients with digestive system disorders. Consequently, TDO2 has garnered increasing recognition as a promising therapeutic target for digestive system diseases in recent years, attracting growing attention. This article provides a brief overview of the role of TDO2 in the tryptophan pathway, emphasizing its significant involvement in diseases of the digestive system. Strategies targeting TDO2 through specific inhibitors suggest considerable promise in enhancing therapeutic outcomes for digestive diseases. Thus, this review concludes by discussing recent advancements in the development of TDO2 inhibitors. We believe that targeted inhibition of TDO2 combined with immunotherapy, the screening of a large number of natural products, and the assistance of artificial intelligence in drug design will be important directions for developing more effective TDO2 inhibitors and improving treatment outcomes in the future."

Lycium barbarum glycopeptide (LBGP) is a peptidoglycan isolated and purified from Lycium barbarum polysaccharides that exhibit significant anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and neuroprotective effects, but the role of LBGP in aminoglycoside-induced SNHL has not been well investigated. Here it is shown that LBGP can protect against neomycin-induced hearing impairment and alleviate oxidative stress in a neomycin-induced SNHL mouse model. Moreover, it is further found that inhibition of tryptophan hydroxylase (Tph)-mediated serotonin (5-HT) biosynthesis plays a key role in the mechanism of action of LBGP in treating neomycin-induced hearing loss. Systemic delivery of 5-HT increased neomycin-induced apoptosis of cochlear hair cells and spiral ganglion neurons, and pharmacological Tph2 inhibition with P-chlorophenylalanine or Tph2 knock down by AAV-ie-Tph2 effectively attenuated neomycin-induced hearing dysfunction. Collectively, these results provide a promising strategy for the prevention of SNHL by using natural plant extract which is more available and exhibits lower side effects compared with other otoprotective drugs, and identify Tph2 as a potential pharmacological target for the treatment of aminoglycoside-induced ototoxicity."

However, the effectiveness of existing serum markers is limited, necessitating the discovery of new biomarkers. METHODS: This study utilized liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry to analyze tryptophan metabolic profiles in serum samples from 105 DTC patients and 50 healthy controls. Independent predictors of DTC were identified through univariate intergroup comparisons and multivariate logistic regression analysis, leading to the development and validation of a new diagnostic model. RESULTS: Significant differences were observed in 11 tryptophan metabolites between DTC patients and controls. Logistic regression identified nicotinamide, 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid, 5-hydroxytryptophan, melatonin, and indole-3-propionic acid as independent predictors. The nomogram prediction model was established based on these five metabolites, and according to the Hosmer-Lemeshow test, the model showed good fit. The five-metabolite diagnostic model demonstrated 84.8% sensitivity, 90.0% specificity, and an area under the ROC curve of 0.932. Decision curve analysis indicated that the model had significant advantages over serum thyroglobulin. DISCUSSION: Tryptophan metabolism exhibits distinct changes in DTC patients, with specific metabolites serving as early diagnostic markers. The five-metabolite panel demonstrates potential for improving early detection and management of DTC.",

      "abstract": "Tryptophan (Trp), an essential amino acid, is solely acquired through dietary intake. It is vital for protein biosynthesis and acts as a precursor for numerous key bioactive compounds. The Kynurenine Pathway and the Indole Pathway are the main metabolic routes and are extensively involved in the occurrence and progression of diseases in the digestive, nervous, and urinary systems. In the Kynurenine Pathway, enzymes crucial to tryptophan metabolism, indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1), IDO2, and Trp-2,3-dioxygenase (TDO), trigger tumor immune resistance within the tumor microenvironment and nearby lymph nodes by depleting Trp or by activating the Aromatic Hydrocarbon Receptor (AhR) through its metabolites. Furthermore, IDO1 can influence immune responses via non-enzymatic pathways. The Kynurenine Pathway exerts its effects on tumor growth through various mechanisms, including NAD+ regulation, angiogenesis promotion, tumor metastasis enhancement, and the inhibition of tumor ferroptosis. In the Indole Pathway, indole and its related metabolites are involved in gastrointestinal homeostasis, tumor immunity, and drug resistance. The gut microbiota related to indole metabolism plays a critical role in determining the effectiveness of tumor treatment strategies and can influence the efficacy of immunochemotherapy. It is worth noting that there are conflicting effects of the Kynurenine Pathway and the Indole Pathway on the same tumor phenotype. For example, different tryptophan metabolites affect the cell cycle differently, and indole metabolism has inconsistent protective effects on tumors in different regions. These differences may hold potential for enhancing therapeutic efficacy.",

The mechanism of this resistance remains unclear. RNA sequencing from cetuximab-sensitive and -resistant specimens revealed an activation of the tryptophan pathway and elevation of IDO1 and IDO2 in cetuximab-resistant CRC patients. In vitro, in vivo, and clinical specimens confirmed the upregulation of IDO1and IDO2 and the Kyn/Trp after cetuximab treatment. Additionally, the IDO inhibitor, epacadostat, could effectively inhibit the migration and proliferation of cetuximab-resistant CRC cells while promoting apoptosis. Compared to epacadostat monotherapy, the combination of cetuximab and epacadostat showed a stronger synergistic anti-tumor effect. Furthermore, in vivo experiments confirmed that combination therapy effectively suppressed tumor growth. Mechanistically, KEGG pathway analysis revealed the activation of the IFN-γ pathway in cetuximab-resistant CRC tissues. Luciferase reporter assays confirmed the transcriptional activity of IDO1 following cetuximab treatment. Silencing IFN-γ then suppressed the upregulation induced by cetuximab. Moreover, we observed that the combination reduced the concentration of the tryptophan metabolite kynurenine, promoted the infiltration of CD8+ T lymphocytes, and enhanced the polarization of M1 macrophages within the tumor microenvironment, thereby exerting potent anti-tumor immune effects. Overall, our results confirm the remarkable therapeutic efficacy of combining cetuximab with epacadostat in cetuximab-resistant CRC. Our findings may provide a novel target for overcoming cetuximab resistance in CRC."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Metabolites can lead to novel discoveries in cardiovascular disease (CVD). OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to investigate whether a metabolomic profile is associated with mortality in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). METHODS: The study group consisted of 170 participants with CAD who were hospitalized due to acute coronary syndrome or elective percutaneous coronary intervention 12-26 months before evaluation (mean[SD] months, 16.3 [2.2]). A total of 132 metabolites were profiled by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, and sums/ratios of 102 metabolite concentrations were calculated. Dates of death from all causes were obtained from the Polish Ministry of Digital Affairs. RESULTS: The median age of the group was 62 years (IQR 58-66), 68.8% (n=117) were male. The median follow-up time was 6.4 years (IQR 5.5-6.5). After adjustment for CVD risk factors affecting survival in the population analyzed (i.e. age, statin dose, current smoking, estimated glomerular filtration rate, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein) with Bonferroni's correction, tryptophan (Trp) was negatively associated with death (HR = 0.558, 95%CI = 0.38-0.82, P = 0.003), whereas indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) activity level was positively associated with death (HR = 2.925, 95%CI = 1.71-5.01, P <0.001). Survival analysis showed that patients with IDO activity levels above he median had statistically worse survival than patients with lower activity levels (log-rank test, P = 0.009). In contrast, patients with Trp concentration below the median had worse survival than those with higher levels (log-rank test,  P = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: In patients with CAD, the increased IDO activity level predicts a worse long-term prognosis independently of known CVD risk factors."

      "abstract": "Royal jelly acid is a unique unsaturated fatty acid isolated from royal jelly. Recently, royal jelly acid was proposed to have potential therapeutic effects on hyperlipidemia. However, its effect on hyperlipidemia and the underlying molecular mechanism remains unclear. Therefore, in this study, we analyzed the mechanism of anti-hyperlipidemia of royal jelly acid through animal experiments and plasma metabolomics in conjunction with human network pharmacology and molecular docking analyses. We found that royal jelly acid could significantly decrease the serum lipid levels, ameliorate hepatic pathological injury, and reduce the level of oxidative stress in the experimental rats. A total of 41 key metabolites and 10 hub targets played key roles in the exertion of anti-hyperlipidemic effects, including tumor necrosis factor (TNF), insulin (INS) and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). A total of 24 pathways, including tryptophan, citrate cycle, and arachidonic acid metabolisms, were identified as the key pathways involved in royal jelly acid-alleviated hyperlipidemia. The present findings provide new insights into the pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment targets of hyperlipidemia as well as contribute to the development and utilization of royal jelly acid related products."

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: In the current study we evaluated a blend of ingredients containing mulberry leaf extract (to lower postprandial glucose of the evening meal), tryptophan (facilitator of the sleep initiation) to benefit sleep initiation and quality in adults with self-reported difficulties with sleep initiation. METHODS: Forty-three adults aged between 25 and 50 years enrolled in a randomized, crossover, double-blind, controlled trial. Participants received standardized meals with a glycemic load of 55 ± 10% and were assigned to receive treatment comprising a combination of mulberry leaf extract (750 mg), whey protein containing 120 mg tryptophan, zinc (1.35 mg), magnesium (12.6 mg), vitamin B3 (1.93 mg) and B6 (0.135 mg) and control (4 g wheat protein hydrolysate). Each intervention phase lasted 14 days separated by a washout period of 28 days. The primary outcomes were actigraphy-measured sleep onset latency and sleep efficiency. Secondary outcomes included continuous glycemic responses, mood, and cognition. RESULTS: A linear mixed model intention-to-treat analysis conducted on 42 participants found that the treatment reduced sleep onset latency (actigraphy: -3.82 mins, p = 0.026; self-report: -3.09 mins, p = 0.048). Treatment significantly reduced evening meal's postprandial glucose response (incremental area under the curve, mmol/L*min) at 1 hour by 21% (p < 0.001), incremental maximum concentration by 16% (p = < 0.001) and nocturnal glucose variation over the 14-day period. Participants on treatment reported improved sleep quality (Karolinska Sleepiness Scale, -0.17, p = 0.041) and feeling more relaxed (Brief Mood Introspection Scale, -0.4, p = 0.003) the next morning compared to when taking the control. Additionally, the treatment improved the vigor dimension on the Profile of Mood Scale (0.8, p = 0.038). No effects were observed on the cognitive performance. Lowering postprandial glucose significantly mediated the treatment effect of lowering sleep onset latency and lower nocturnal glucose variation was also associated with improved sleep quality and next-day positive mood. CONCLUSION: The evening meal supplement benefited sleep initiation and quality, and also improved post wake mood in adults.

      "abstract": "The crisis of metabolic and mental disorders continues to escalate worldwide. A growing body of research highlights the influence of tryptophan and its metabolites, such as serotonin, beyond their traditional roles in neural signaling. Serotonin acts as a key neurotransmitter within the brain-gut-microbiome axis, a critical bidirectional communication network affecting both metabolism and behavior. Emerging evidence suggests that the gut microbiome regulates brain function and behavior, particularly through microbial influences on tryptophan metabolism and the serotonergic system, both of which are essential for normal functioning. Additionally, sex differences exist in multiple aspects of serotonin-mediated modulation within the brain-gut-microbiome axis, affecting feeding and affective behaviors. This review summarizes the current knowledge from human and animal studies on the influence of tryptophan and its metabolite serotonin on metabolic and behavioral regulation involving the brain and gut microbiome, with a focus on sex differences and the role of sex hormones. We speculate that gut-derived tryptophan and serotonin play essential roles in the pathophysiology that modifies neural circuits, potentially contributing to eating and affective disorders. We propose the gut microbiome as an appealing therapeutic target for metabolic and affective disorders, emphasizing the importance of understanding sex differences in metabolic and behavioral regulation influenced by the brain-gut-microbiome axis. The therapeutic targeting of the gut microbiota and its metabolites may offer a viable strategy for treating serotonin-related disorders, such as eating and affective disorders, with potential differences in treatment efficacy between men and women. This review would promote research on sex differences in metabolic and behavioral regulation impacted by the brain-gut-microbiome axis.",

      "abstract": "Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the deadliest brain tumour with an extremely poor prognosis. Tryptophan catabolism could enhance an array of protumour-genic signals and promoted tumour progression in GBM. However, the mechanisms of oncogenic signalling under tryptophan catabolism and potential therapy targeting this pathway have not been completely understood. Interleukin 4-induced 1 (IL4I1) is newly defined as a tryptophan metabolic enzyme and the potential function in GBM cells still remains unclear. In our study, we found IL4I1 was upregulated in GBM patients and predicted poor prognosis. Upregulation of IL4I1 inhibited GBM ferroptosis in vitro and in vivo. Further, we found that indole-3-pyruvic acid (I3P) from tryptophan mediated by IL4I1 could scavenge free radical and had an impressive role in inhibiting ferroptosis. To clarify the potential mechanism of I3P in GBM ferroptosis, we performed transcriptomic analyses of GBM cells treated with I3P and found that Nrf2 related genes was upregulated. Further, we found that the ubiquitination of Nrf2 could be attenuate by I3P binding with Nrf2 directly. Knockdown of Nrf2 attenuated the induction of anti-ferroptosis by IL4I1, pointing to Nrf2 as a key mediator of this process. In vivo, overexpression of IL4I1 with ML385 in GBM xenografts promoted ferroptosis. Collectively, this study emphasises the crucial roles of IL4I1 in anti-ferroptosis through Nrf2 signalling pathway but not AHR pathway by catabolism tryptophan, suggesting IL4I1 and tryptophan reprogramming as potential therapeutic targets for GBM."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Stroke is a multifaceted physiological event linked to imbalances in gut microbiota and disruptions in metabolic pathways. Traditional Chinese medicines, leveraging the gut-brain axis, have been shown to significantly ameliorate ischemic stroke. However, the specific role and molecular mechanism of Shenqi granules (SQF) in enhancing the recovery from ischemic stroke remain to be elucidated. PURPOSE: This study aims to explore the therapeutic effects of SQF on rats with cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury (CIRI) and its regulatory effects on the gut microbiota, providing a basis for the clinical rational use of drugs in ischemic stroke. METHODS: The study conducted a comprehensive biological assessment of SQF's role in improving CIRI at the whole-animal level. Subsequently, Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) and network pharmacology analysis were used for component analysis and target prediction. Then, the therapeutic targets of SQF were further validated through molecular docking and molecular experiments. Finally, an integrated omics approach combining fecal untargeted metabolome and 16S rRNA sequencing was employed to state the anti-CIRI effects of SQF and its potential mechanisms. RESULTS: SQF alleviates cerebral infarct volume and improves cognitive functions in MCAO rats. Network pharmacology analysis shows 20 potential active ingredients of SQF could target 13 target proteins. Further employing WGCNA, our study identified four key targets of SQF in the treatment of ischemic stroke. Based on molecular docking and molecular experiments, SQF improves CIRI by activating NFE2L2/NRF2. Serum metabolomics analysis identified six metabolites related to the tryptophan and tyrosine metabolic pathways, which interact with NFE2L2/NRF2 protein. Fecal metabolome and microbiome reveal that SQF's protective effect on CIRI is linked to the tryptophan metabolism and tyrosine metabolism and gut microbiome modulation. In particular, metabolites related to tryptophan and tyrosine metabolism, such as kynurenic acid and dopamine, may exert their protective effects by interacting with NFE2L2/NRF2. CONCLUSION: This pioneering study unveils the therapeutic potential of SQF in addressing CIRI, highlighting the pivotal role of NFE2L2/NRF2 upregulation in its mechanism of action. Furthermore, SQF demonstrates its efficacy in restoring gut microbiota balance by modulating the metabolism of tryptophan and tyrosine in CIRI. By elucidating the intricate interplay among constituents, targets, metabolites, and gut microbiota, this research offers novel insights into the multifaceted mechanisms underlying SQF's therapeutic impact on CIRI.",

Herein, we report for the first time that Fe3O4 nanoparticles exhibit tryptophan hydroxylase-like activity and successfully verify their ability to restore serotonin synthesis in the brain for the treatment of depression. To achieve better biocompatibility and brain delivery, the Fe3O4 nanoparticles were functionalized with chitosan (CS) (Fe3O4@CS), enabling their delivery from the nose to the brain. Fe3O4@CS catalyzes the transformation of tryptophan into 5-hydroxytryptophan with the participation of high levels of endogenous ascorbic acid and hydrogen peroxide in stressed neurons, thus compensating for the deactivated tryptophan hydroxylase in the brain. In vivo Fe3O4@CS treatment results in the recovery of 5-hydroxytryptophan and serotonin levels and improvement of neuronal signal transduction ability in a depression mouse model, thus ameliorating depressive-like behaviors. The presented strategy of restoring serotonin synthesis in situ based on a tryptophan hydroxylase-like nanozyme provides a more accurate and efficient approach for the treatment of depression.",

      "abstract": "Disruption of the intestinal mucosal barrier caused by gut dysbiosis and metabolic imbalance is the underlying pathology of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Traditional Chinese medicine Wuji Wan (WJW) is commonly used to treat digestive system disorders and showed therapeutic potential for IBD. In this interdisciplinary study, we aim to investigate the pharmacological effects of WJW against experimental colitis by combining functional metabolomics and gut-microbiota sequencing techniques. Treatment with WJW altered the profile of the intestinal microbiota and notably increased the abundance of Lactobacillus, thereby facilitating the conversion of tryptophan into indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) and indoleacrylic acid (IA). These indole derivatives activated the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) pathway, which reduced colonic inflammation and restored the expression of intestinal barrier proteins. Interestingly, the beneficial effects of WJW on gut barrier function improvement and tryptophan metabolism were disappeared in the absence of gut microbiota. Finally, pre-treatment with the AhR antagonist CH-223191 confirmed the essential role of IAA-mediated AhR activation in the therapeutic effects of WJW. Overall, WJW enhanced intestinal barrier function and reduced colonic inflammation in a murine colitis model by modulating Lactobacillus-IAA-AhR signaling pathway. This study provides novel insights into colitis pathogenesis and presents an effective therapeutic and preventive approach against IBD."

Kynurenine increases leiomyoma cell survival by activating the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR). We used a leiomyoma-relevant model, in which a MED12 Gly44 mutation was knocked in by CRISPR in a human uterine myometrial smooth muscle (UtSM) cell line, in addition to primary leiomyoma cells from 26 patients to ascertain the mechanisms responsible for therapeutic effects of apigenin, a natural compound. Apigenin treatment significantly decreased cell viability, inhibited cell cycle progression, and induced apoptosis preferentially in mut-MED12 versus wild-type primary leiomyoma and UtSM cells. Apigenin not only blocked AHR action but also decreased TDO2 expression and kynurenine production, preferentially in mut-MED12 cells. Apigenin did not alter TDO2 enzyme activity. TNF and IL-1β, cytokines upregulated in leiomyoma, strikingly induced TDO2 expression levels via activating the NF-κB and JNK pathways, which were abolished by apigenin. Apigenin or a TDO2 inhibitor decreased UtSM cell viability induced by TNF/IL-1β. We provide proof-of-principle evidence that apigenin is a potential therapeutic agent for mut-MED12 leiomyomas.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Crohn's disease (CD) exclusion diet combined with partial enteral nutrition (CDED + PEN) or exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) is effective in inducing remission in mild-to-moderate pediatric CD. Although CDED + PEN is better tolerated and has higher compliance compared to EEN, a subset of patients does not achieve remission. Diet-induced remission is shown to be positively associated with specific changes in tryptophan-metabolites. OBJECTIVES: To investigate whether the abundance of baseline fecal tryptophan-metabolites predicts dietary therapy outcomes in pediatric CD. DESIGN: Diagnostic accuracy study and secondary analysis of previously conducted Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT). METHODS: Twenty-six patients from previously performed RCT of mild-to-moderate pediatric CD were included. The patients were classified as having clinical remission (R) (n = 19 in total; CDED + PEN = 10 and to EEN = 9) or No-Remission (NR) (n = 7 in total; CDED + PEN = 3 and EEN = 4) following 6 weeks of therapy, based on the Pediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index score (⩽10 = remission). We performed a targeted quantitative analysis of 21 tryptophan-metabolites in baseline (t = 0) fecal samples from both groups, utilizing liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole mass spectrometry. Receiver operator characteristic curve (ROC) and random forest analysis (RFA) were used to assess the predictive power of fecal tryptophan-metabolites for dietary outcomes at baseline. Ratios of tryptophan-metabolites were compared to investigate different downstream tryptophan pathways. RESULTS: Baseline fecal kynurenine level was significantly higher in NR compared to R for CDED + PEN (p = 0.02) and EEN (p = 0.04). ROC analysis highlighted the robust predictive power of kynurenine for CDED + PEN (area under the curve (AUC = 0.97)) and EEN (AUC = 0.88)-induced remission. RFA corroborated these observations. The ratio serotonin/kynurenine was the strongest predictor of CDED + PEN-induced remission (AUC = 1). The ratio 5-hydroxytryptophan/kynurenine (AUC = 0.88) predicted EEN-induced remission. By combining data from CDED + PEN and EEN, kynurenine (AUC = 0.91) and ratios of quinolinic acid/kynurenine (AUC = 0.93) and kynurenine/indole-3-acetic acid (AUC = 0.88) demonstrated strong predictive performance for dietary therapy-induced remission. CONCLUSION: Baseline tryptophan metabolites have the potential to serve as a biomarker for dietary remission in pediatric CD. Some tryptophan metabolite ratios showed the most promising predictive capabilities. If confirmed in validation studies, baseline fecal tryptophan markers may be able to provide much-needed guidance to personalize dietary intervention within the management of pediatric CD.

      "abstract": "Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the hepatic manifestation of the metabolic syndrome. NAFLD encompasses a spectrum of liver damage starting with liver steatosis and lipid disorders presented as the hallmark. Cannabinoid-2 receptor (CB2R) is the receptor of endocannabinoids mainly expressed in immune cells. Our preliminary study revealed the preventative role of CB2R in liver injury related to lipid metabolism. In this study, we aimed to explore the role of CB2R in NAFLD and the underlying mechanism related to microbial community. High-fat diet-induced NAFLD model was established in mice. We found that hepatic CB2R expression was significantly reduced in NAFLD mice and CB2R-/- mice fed with normal chow. Interestingly, cohousing with or transplanted with microbiota from WT mice, or treatment with an antibiotic cocktail ameliorated the NAFLD phenotype of CB2R-/- mice. The gut dysbiosis in CB2R-/- mice including increased Actinobacteriota and decreased Bacteroidota was similar to that of NAFLD patients and NAFLD mice. Microbial functional analysis and metabolomics profiling revealed obviously disturbed tryptophan metabolism in NAFLD patients and NAFLD mice, which were also seen in CB2R-/- mice. Correlation network showed that the disordered tryptophan metabolites such as indolelactic acid (ILA) and xanthurenic acid in CB2R-/- mice were mediated by gut dysbiosis and related to NAFLD severity indicators. In vitro and in vivo validation experiments showed that the enriched tryptophan metabolites ILA aggravated NAFLD phenotypes. These results demonstrate the involvement of CB2R in NAFLD, which is related to gut microbiota-mediated tryptophan metabolites. Our findings highlight CB2R and the associated microbes and tryptophan metabolites as promising targets for the treatment of NAFLD."

      "abstract": "The effects of different level of rumen-protected L-tryptophan (RPL-T) supplementation on starch digestion, melatonin (MEL) and gastrointestinal (GI) hormones secretion in Holstein steers were evaluated. Four Holstein steers (201 ± 24 kg) were employed in a 4×4 Latin square design. The dietary treatments were the control (basal diet) and RPL-T groups of basal diet + 191.1 mg/kg body weight (BW), basal diet + 95.6 mg/kg BW, and basal diet + 19.1 mg/kg BW groups. Blood samples were collected to measure blood hormones on day 0, 1, 3, and 5 of the experiment to study serum MEL and GI tract and duodenal starch degradability. The design was 4 × 4 Latin square and the data were analyzed using the ANOVA procedure by SPSS. The D-glucose content in the RPL-T treatment groups was significantly reduced (p < 0.05) compared to the control group. The serum cholecystokinin (CCK) levels were increased in the RPL-T treatment group compared to the control group. However, there was no significant difference between all RPL-T treatment groups. The results of serum MEL were also similar to CCK results. The serum secretin levels were not significantly different (p > 0.05) between all groups. The apparent starch disappearance rates in GI track were lower (p < 0.05) in treatment groups compared with the control, and there was no significant difference between all RPL-T treatment groups. Digestion was increased (p < 0.05) in all treatment groups compared to the control. Overall, there were significant differences in starch digestibility, CCK, and MEL compared to the control group, but there were no significant differences in concentration of RPL-T. Therefore, considering the economic purpose, 19.1mg/kg BW is recommended as an appropriate level of addition to increase the productivity of beef cattle."

      "abstract": "Electroacupuncture (EA) has shown promise as a treatment for Functional constipation (FC), with growing evidence suggesting it may enhance gut motility. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) serve as key regulatory molecules mediating host-microbiota interactions. However, the specific fecal miRNAs regulating microbiota composition and metabolism in EA-treated constipated mice, along with their key targets, remain unidentified. We examined fecal microbiome composition, metabolism, and colonic miRNA expression in loperamide-induced constipated mice and EA-treated mice to identify differentially expressed miRNAs and assess their relationships with microbial abundance, metabolism, and gut motility. An antibiotic cocktail and adeno-associated virus were employed to interfere with the gut microbiota and target miRNA in vivo, thereby validating the proposed mechanism. Our results indicate that miR-205-5p, significantly upregulated in fecal and colonic tissues of EA-treated constipated mice, promotes intestinal motility in a microbiome-dependent manner. Specifically, EA promoted the growth of Lactobacillus reuteri, enriched in the feces of constipation-recovered mice, through host-derived miR-205-5p regulation. Furthermore, Lactobacillus reuteri and its tryptophan metabolites (indole-3-acetamide, indole-3-acetic acid, and indole-3-carboxaldehyde) alleviated loperamide-induced constipation. These findings underscore the pivotal role of host-derived miR-205-5p in modulating microbial composition and tryptophan metabolites to enhance intestinal motility through EA."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Pharmacological targeting of Hedgehog (HH)/GLI has proven effective for certain blood, brain and skin cancers including basal cell carcinoma (BCC). However, limited response rates and the development of drug resistance call for improved anti-HH therapies that take synergistic crosstalk mechanisms and immune evasion strategies into account. In previous work, we demonstrated that cooperation of HH/GLI and Interleukin 6 (IL6)/STAT3 signaling drives BCC growth. Whether synergistic HH-IL6 signaling promotes BCC via the activation of immune evasion mechanisms remained unclear. METHODS: HH-IL6 regulated immunosuppressive genes such as indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) were identified by gene expression profiling. IDO1 expression was evaluated in human BCC and melanoma models by qPCR and Western blot analyses. The cis-regulatory region of IDO1 was interrogated for HH-IL6-regulated GLI and STAT transcription factor binding and epigenetic modifications by targeted chromatin-immunoprecipitation and bisulfite pyrosequencing. Functional analyses of the immunosuppressive effects of IDO1 involved HPLC-MS measurements of its metabolites and the assessment of T cell proliferation via flow cytometry. Bioinformatic analyses of GLI-STAT cooperation were conducted on published bulk and single-cell RNA-seq data of human BCC and melanoma patients. RESULTS: We identified IDO1 as a target gene of cooperative GLI-STAT activity in BCC and melanoma. GLI1 and STAT3 transcription factors synergistically enhanced IDO1 expression by jointly binding to the cis-regulatory region of IDO1 and by increasing active chromatin marks at the histone level. In human melanoma cells, inhibition of GLI1 expression prevented the induction of IDO1 expression in response to IL6/STAT3 and IFNγ/STAT1 signaling. Pharmacological targeting of HH/GLI signaling reduced IDO1 expression, resulting in decreased production of the immunosuppressive metabolite kynurenine. Further, inhibition of GLI1 enhanced the efficacy of the selective IDO1 inhibitor epacadostat and rescued T cell proliferation by attenuating IDO1/kynurenine-mediated immunosuppression. Elevated expression of IDO1 correlated with active HH/GLI and JAK/STAT signaling in skin cancer patients supporting the clinical relevance of the mechanistic data presented. CONCLUSIONS: These results identify the immunosuppressive IDO1-kynurenine pathway as a novel pro-tumorigenic target of oncogenic GLI and STAT1/STAT3 cooperation. Our data suggest simultaneous pharmacological targeting of these signaling axes as rational combination therapy in melanoma and non-melanoma skin cancers.",

In this study, attempts were made to investigate the excited-state kinetics of intrinsic fluorophores, tryptophan and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) to understand the metabolic changes associated with the transformation of normal liver into cirrhosis and HCC. Significant variations were observed in the values of average fluorescence lifetimes for 350 nm (τavg_350) and 450 nm (τavg_450) emissions for cirrhosis and HCC with respect to normal samples. The classification results of hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) and receiver operator characteristics (ROC) based on the values of τavg_350 discriminates normal from liver diseased group (cirrhosis and HCC) with 86.95 % sensitivity and 96.43 % specificity. In the case of τavg_450 values, 95.65 % sensitivity is obtained for both HCA and ROC analyses. However, specificity of 100 % and 92.86 % was obtained in ROC and HCA analysis, respectively. The changes in the values of τavg_350, τavg_450 and NADHfree/NADHbound in cirrhosis cases after surgery are shifting towards the respective values of normal group. Among the decay kinetics of two emissions, the emission at 450 nm provides better discrimination than 350 nm emission.",

Previous studies have shown that KYN is an Aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) agonist and is important in regulating various physiological activities, including female reproduction. Progesterone is a vital steroid hormone that facilitates embryo implantation and maintains pregnancy. However, whether KYN affects its biosynthesis remains unclear. To gain understanding, in vitro luteinized porcine granulosa luteal (pGL) cells were treated with KYN. The results showed that KYN disrupted progesterone biosynthesis by decreasing the expression of STAR and HSD3B in pGL cells. In addition, the expression of three transcription factors of STAR and HSD3B (GATA4, GATA6, and CEBPB) decreased after KYN treatment. Furthermore, the AHR blockade results showed comparable to those of KYN treatment, and subsequent knockdown experiments confirmed these results. These findings suggest that KYN inhibits progesterone biosynthesis in pGL cells by downregulating GATA4, GATA6, and CEBPB expression through AHR. Thus, our results showed for the first time, a previously unknown connection between KYN and progesterone biosynthesis."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Although probiotics-based therapies and postbiotics derived from Lactobacillus reuteri (L. reuteri) hold promising potential in mitigating alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD), the role of L. reuteri's metabolite, 3-Hydroxypropionaldehyde (3-HPA, reuterin), remains elusive. PURPOSE: The objective of this study is to examine the influence of 3-HPA on the attenuation of alcohol-induced hepatic steatosis and its underlying mechanisms. METHODS: The study utilizes network pharmacology to identify potential targets for 3-HPA in treating ALD. Comprehensive analytical methods, including histological and biochemical assessments, coupled with metabolomics techniques, are employed to evaluate the protective mechanisms and actions of 3-HPA in ALD. Additionally, the therapeutic potential of hepatic aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) activation is explored through using both an AhR agonist and inhibitor, in order to assess the potential of 3-HPA as an AhR ligand in treating ALD. RESULTS: Chronic alcohol consumption stimulates AhR activation in hepatocytes, both in vivo and in vitro, leading to the disruption of hepatic tryptophan metabolism. Our observations indicate that 3-HPA has the potential to regulate this process by activating AhR signaling through modulating tryptophan metabolism, specifically affecting indole acetaldehyde, indole, and 5‑hydroxy-l-tryptophan (5-HTP) levels. Mechanistically, 3-HPA demonstrates potential as an effective AhR agonist in mitigating ethanol-induced liver injury by regulating AhR-CD36 signaling, thereby exerting protective effects against hepatic steatosis. CONCLUSION: Ultimately, the study identifies a previously uncharacterized role of 3-HPA in alleviating alcohol-associated liver injury and hepatic steatosis. It further elucidates that 3-HPA serves as a mediator in tryptophan metabolism, activating the AhR signaling, thereby suggesting its potential as a promising candidate for the treatment of ALD.",

There has been significant interest in exploring the effect of diet on negative social behaviors and the wider social behavior repertoire of pigs. The aim of this study was to determine the effects of dietary Lysine (Lys) and Tryptophan (Trp) levels on the social behavior of commercially housed pigs. A total of 2,293 PIC Camborough barrows with a mean starting weight of 11.87 ± 1.35 kg were used in a randomized complete block design with a 2 × 3 factorial arrangement, with 16 replicates per treatment, of the following factors: 1) Standardized ileal digestible Lys levels: 100% Lys = diets with 100% PIC requirement at the midpoint of the growth phase (Lys 100) vs 80% Lys = diets with 80% PIC requirement at the midpoint of the growth phase (Lys 80); and 2) Trp to Lys ratio of 0.210, 0.185, or 0.160. Pigs were randomly allocated across the 6 treatments over 2 starting dates. Behavior and lesion data were collected. There was an effect of Lys (P = 0.032) on ear-biting behavior, with pigs on the Lys 80 treatments showing a higher level of ear-biting behavior. We also found an effect of the Lys score week interaction on the proportion of pens showing ear lesions (P < 0.001) and an effect of the Lys Trp interaction (P = 0.030) and the Lys score week interaction (P = 0.0104) on the proportion of pens showing severe ear lesions. In conclusion, the lysine content of feed can affect the social behavior of pigs, specifically ear biting, in commercial conditions.",

Recently, we developed a highly specific inhibitor (TPHi) of the serotonin synthesizing enzyme tryptophan hydroxylase 1, TPT-004. We hypothesized that repetitive nose-only inhalation of TPT-004 alleviates PAH and pulmonary vascular remodeling in the Sugen-hypoxia (SuHx) rat model. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into 3 groups: (i) ConNx, control animals kept in room air during the study; (ii) SuHx [rats subcutaneously injected with the VEGFR2-inhibitor SU5416, then exposed to chronic hypoxia (3 weeks), followed by 5.5 weeks of room air]; (iii) SuHx + TPHi [SuHx animals treated with TPHi by inhalation for 4 weeks]. Closed-chest right-left heart catheterization and cardiac MRI were performed in spontaneously breathing rats. Lungs underwent histological and mRNA-seq analysis. SuHx-exposed rats had severe PAH, RV hypertrophy, and RV dilation. In comparison with SuHx-exposed rats, TPHi-treated SuHx rats had significantly lower RV systolic pressure (67.25 vs.51.47mmHg; p<0.0001), normalized RV end-systolic volume (182.6 vs. 105.1µL; p<0.0001) and improved RV ejection fraction by cardiac MRI (47.9 vs. 66.8%; p<0.0001). Inhaled TPT-004 did not affect LV end-diastolic or systemic blood pressure. TPT-004 therapy reversed pulmonary vascular remodeling and alveolar macrophage infiltration. RNA-sequencing unraveled TPHi-induced changes in pulmonary gene expression: 1) increased cell adhesion and reduced cell motility/migration; 2) suppressed extracellular matrix remodeling; 3) modulated immune response; 4) suppressed pulmonary vascular remodeling via modulating proliferation, apoptosis, and homeostasis. Taken together, TPT-004 is an effective therapeutic PAH agent, does not cause any hemodynamic adverse effects in rodents, and thus, should be tested further towards a clinical phase 1b/phase 2 study in PAH patients."

We investigated the capability and mechanisms of gut microbes to restore epithelial barriers and mucosal immunity in virally inflamed gut by using a multipronged approach: an in vivo simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)-infected nonhuman primate model of HIV/AIDS, ex vivo HIV-exposed human colorectal explants and primary human intestinal epithelial cells. SIV infection reprogrammed tryptophan (TRP) metabolism, increasing kynurenine catabolite levels that are associated with mucosal barrier disruption and immune suppression. Administration of Lactiplantibacillus plantarum or Bifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis into the SIV-inflamed gut lumen in vivo resulted in rapid reprogramming of microbial TRP metabolism towards indole-3-lactic acid (ILA) production. This shift accelerated epithelial repair and enhanced anti-viral defenses through induction of IL-22 signaling in mucosal T cells and aryl hydrocarbon receptor activation. Additionally, ILA treatment of human colorectal tissue explants ex vivo inhibited HIV replication by reducing mucosal inflammatory cytokine production and cell activation. Our findings underscore the therapeutic potential of microbial metabolic reprogramming of TRP-to-ILA and mechanisms in mitigating viral pathogenic effects and bolstering mucosal defenses for HIV eradication."

Traditional diagnostic and therapeutic methods have limitations, necessitating the exploration of more effective strategies. METHODS: In this study, we employed the Gene Expression Omnibus database to identify genes that are differentially expressed in CD. RT-PCR and immunohistochemical analysis were used to SLC6A14 RNA and protein expression in the colons of CD mice and CD tissues from patients. The mouse model of CD was induced by dextran sodium sulfate (DSS). Infiltrating immune cells in mouse model were screened by flow cytometry. RESULTS: We discovered that SLC6A14 is significantly overexpressed in CD samples, and its expression is positively correlated with the degree of infiltration by CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. The elevated levels of SLC6A14 RNA and protein were confirmed in clinical CD tissues. The SLC6A14 inhibitor α-methyl-tryptophan (α-MT) significantly decreased the expression of SLC6A14 RNA and protein in the colons of CD mice. The α-MT treatment group also exhibited reduced levels of cytokines involved in T cell differentiation (IFN-γ and TNF-α) and the expression of immune cell surface markers CXCR-3 and LAG-3. Flow cytometry analysis revealed a significant increase in the infiltration of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in the DSS-treated group compared to the control group. Conversely, the α-MT treatment group showed a significant reduction in CD4+ and CD8+ T cell infiltration and the restoration of intestinal parameters in CD mice. These findings underscore the role of SLC6A14 in regulating intestinal immune cell infiltration during CD progression. DISCUSSION: Our findings suggest that SLC6A14 could serve as a potential diagnostic biomarker and therapeutic target for CD. Furthermore, α-MT offers a novel approach for the clinical diagnosis and treatment of CD by targeting SLC6A14 for therapeutic intervention."

In this study, we aimed to explore the dynamic trends and emerging topics in d-tryptophan research to offer fresh perspectives for future studies. METHODS: Employing bibliometric analysis, we examined the literature on d-tryptophan indexed in the Web of Science Core Collection from January 1987 to December 2023. The \"Bibliometrix\" R package and CiteSpace were utilised for data processing. RESULTS: Analyses of 865 publications revealed 2209 keywords, 4068 authors, 2094 institutions, and contributors from 302 regions. The USA was at the forefront of publications concerning d-tryptophan, but the European Journal of Pharmacology, Journal of Biological Chemistry, and Journal of Medicinal Chemistry were notable for their contributions, co-citations, and impact, respectively. This literature review reveals that since 1987, studies have developed from a focus on d-tryptophan metabolism to the exploration of its functions in organic and medicinal chemistry and food science. Recent findings highlight the potential of d-tryptophan as a non-nutritional sweetener and food preservative as well as its role in inhibiting the growth of bacterial biofilms. Additionally, its immunomodulatory properties are being investigated in relation to allergic diseases. Furthermore, d-tryptophan plays a role in the therapy of atherosclerosis, osteoporosis, tuberculosis, and cancer. CONCLUSION: The results of bibliometric analysis highlight that future research should focus on the biological functions of d-tryptophan as a food preservative and its use in immunomodulation and drug development, providing strong guidance for future research."

      "abstract": "Tryptophan catabolism is a central pathway in many cancers, serving to sustain an immunosuppressive microenvironment. The key enzymes involved in this tryptophan metabolism such as indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) and tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase (TDO) are reported as promising novel targets in cancer immunotherapy. IDO1 and TDO overexpression in TNBC cells promote resistance to cell death, proliferation, invasion, and metastasis. To date, there are no clinically available small-molecule inhibitors that target these enzymes. Navoximod, a reliable dual-specific inhibitor, resulted in poor bioavailability and modest efficacy in clinical trials restricts its utility. This situation urges the development of a potent drug-like candidate against these key enzymes. A total of 1574 natural compounds were proclaimed and subjected to ADME screening. Subsequently, the resultant compounds were attributed to hierarchical molecular docking and MM-GBSA validation. Ultimately, re-scoring with the aid of combined machine learning algorithms resulted six lead compounds. Captivatingly, NPACT00380 exhibited maximum interaction among the lead compounds. In addition, the scaffold analysis also highlighted that the chromanone moiety of the hit compound boasts anti-cancer activity against breast cancer cell lines. The reliability of the results was corroborated through a rigorous 100 ns molecular dynamics simulation using the parameters including RMSD, PCA and FEL analysis. In light of these findings, it is presumed that the proposed compound exhibits significant inhibitory activity. As a result, we speculate that further optimisation of NPACT00380 could be beneficial for the treatment and management of TNBC."

Tryptophan, capable of crossing the blood-brain barrier (BBB), serves as a precursor to numerous pharmacologically active compounds, while isatin and its derivatives have demonstrated anti-tumor effects, including against brain cancers. This study aimed to synthesize fluorescent CNDs from tryptophan-isatin hybrid precursor and explore their applications in glioblastoma treatment. These CNDs were characterized using techniques such as TEM, SEM-EDS, FTIR, XPS, Raman spectroscopy and UV-Vis spectrophotometry. In vitro tests using the U-87 glioblastoma cell line evaluated cell viability, affinity, and BBB permeability. The CNDs, between 4 and 7 nm in size, exhibited blue and green fluorescence, with no cytotoxic effects observed at concentrations up to 25 µg/mL. The highest BBB permeability rate was determined as 4.3 × 10⁻⁵ cm/s. Additionally, the CNDs demonstrated radiotherapeutic properties, leading to a 51 % reduction in cell viability. This research contributes to nanomedicine by introducing a novel biocompatible material with potential for targeted brain cancer imaging and therapy, while also suggesting broader applications beyond glioblastoma.",

Fucoidan from Apostichopus japonicus (Aj-FUC) has attracted considerable attention because of its immunomodulatory activities. Aj-FUC is indigestible in the human upper gastrointestinal tract but can be utilized by the gut microbiota. Thus, we suspect that Aj-FUC interacts with the gut to enhance immunefunction. This study showed that after a three-week intervention with Aj-FUC (100 mg/kg/d), the gut microbiota in mice developed a new homeostasis. Subsequently, in the condition of intestinal flora homeostasis, the effects of Aj-FUC on intestinal health in normal mice and the prevention of intestinal mucosal damage in cyclophosphamide-induced mice were investigated. Aj-FUC preserved intestinal structural integrity, increased the number of goblet cells, upregulated the expression of ZO-1 and Occludin, stimulated the secretion of sIgA and IgA, and maintained the Th1/Th2 balance. Importantly, beneficial bacteria were enriched, and tryptophan metabolism-related metabolites such as 5-hydroxyindole-3-acetic acid, and indole-3-lactic acid were upregulated following Aj-FUC administration. In summary, a three-week Aj-FUC intervention could result in the formation of a new homeostasis in intestinal flora, while the effect of Aj-FUC on intestinal immunity was related to the regulation of tryptophan metabolism by gut microbiota.",

The flower buds of Tussilago farfara L., also known as Farfarae Flos (FF), can be used for the treatment of cough, bronchitis, and asthmatic disorders in China. In the present study, we used lung and fecal metabolomics, as well as the intestinal flora analysis, aimed to investigate the protective effect of FF against the CS exposure induced lung inflammation on mice. The results showed that FF administration could relieve the lung inflammation as demonstrated by lung index, interleukin-6 (IL-6), and interleukin-1β (IL-1β) levels, as well as the pulmonary pathological change. The lung metabolomics coupled with molecular docking showed that FF could alleviate lung inflammation by regulating lysophosphatidylcholine biosynthesis through the caffeoyl quinic acids distributed in the lung tissue. In addition, fecal metabolome coupled with 16S rRNA gene sequencing showed that FF could regulate the tryptophan metabolism by regulating the intestinal flora disorders. This study provided new insights of FF to relieve CS-induced pulmonary inflammation with the multimechanism.",

Control and immunocastrate (Improvac-vaccinated at 13 and 17 weeks, Imp) boars and barrows were fed a finisher ration while the others were fed diets supplemented with Mg (5 g Mg proteinate/kg), Br (140 mg NaBr/kg) and Trp (5 g Trp/kg). In experiment 2, 300 boars were stratified by weight and within three weight classes allocated to two pens of ten pigs per treatment. Control and Imp boars were fed a finisher ration while the other diets were supplemented with Br, Trp or both Br and Trp. In Experiment 1, average daily gain (ADG) was not affected by diet but the Imp boars had higher ADG than controls. Feed intake (FI) tended to be higher in all treatments compared to controls except for the Trp group. In Experiment 2, Imp boars had higher ADG and FI than other treatments while Br+Trp boars had higher ADG and FI than controls. These data suggest that immunocastration and dietary Trp and Br show promise for improving performance in group-housed boars."

      "abstract": "Live fish transportation plays a crucial role in the commercial fish trade. Consequently, mitigating stress during transportation is essential for enhancing the survival rate of fish and reducing potential financial losses. In this study, the effectiveness was evaluated of exogenous tryptophan in reducing transport stress in hybrid grouper, Epinephelus fuscoguttatus ♀ × E. lanceolatus ♂. Firstly, the groupers were divided into the following five experimental groups: 40 mg/L MS-222 group, 30 mg/L tryptophan, 50 mg/L tryptophan, 70 mg/L tryptophan, and the control group without additives. Followed by transportation simulation, the fish samples were collected before and after transportation for the determination of antioxidant enzyme activities, apoptosis gene, and inflammatory gene expressions. The results indicated that the superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) activities and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels in all groups were significantly increased, while they were lower in the 50 mg/L Trp treated group compared to the control group (p < 0.05). Compared with the control group in the 50 mg/L Trp, 70 mg/L Trp, and 40 mg/L MS-222-treated groups, serum cortisol and blood glucose levels were significantly increased (p < 0.05), and anti-inflammatory factor (IL-10) gene expression was upregulated and pro-inflammatory factor (IL-1β) gene expression was decreased (p < 0.05). In addition, it was found that the 30 mg/L Trp, 50 mg/L Trp, and 40 mg/L MS-222 treatment groups had less green fluorescence than the control group by measuring the mitochondrial membrane potential, and 50 mg/L Trp and MS-222 showed more red fluorescence in fluorescence images than the other samples at the same sampling time. Therefore, in this study, it was demonstrated that the tryptophan could be used as a new anti-stress agent for hybrid groupers during transport, and additional research is required to identify the specific conditions that yield the best outcomes."

This study explores the relationship between inflammation and metabolism in people with HIV, focusing on immune markers and the tryptophan-kynurenine (Trp-Kyn) pathway. DESIGN: This is a cross-sectional, observational study exploring the associations between peripheral inflammation and metabolism in treatment-naive South African people with HIV. METHODS: We examined immune markers (hsCRP, suPAR, IL-6, NGAL, and sCD163) and Trp-Kyn metabolites (QUIN, Trp, Kyn, Trp/Kyn ratio, and kynurenic acid) in n = 69 treatment-naive South African people with HIV using targeted liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) metabolomics and various assays. RESULTS: We observed significant associations between immune markers and Trp-Kyn metabolites. IL-6 was negatively associated with Trp (P < 0.001) and positively with the Kyn/Trp ratio (P = 0.005). hsCRP was positively associated with QUIN (P = 0.036). suPAR showed significant negative associations with Trp (P = 0.036), positive associations with the Kyn/Trp ratio (P < 0.001), and QUIN (P = 0.007). sCD163 negatively associated with Trp (P < 0.001) and positively with the Kyn/Trp ratio (P < 0.001). When participants were stratified by inflammation levels (based on CRP), IL-6 (P = 0.002), QUIN (P = 0.009), and Kyn (P = 0.032) were significantly higher in the high inflammation group. Specific associations were observed only in certain groups, such as IL-6 negatively associating with Trp and kynurenic acid in the high inflammation group, and suPAR associating negatively with Trp in the low inflammation group. CONCLUSIONS: These exploratory findings provide further insight into how peripheral inflammation and metabolism are interrelated in South African people with HIV, potentially guiding future therapeutic strategies.\"",

Herein, employing amitriptyline (AMI), an antagonist of TLR4 and serotonin transporter (SERT), we revealed that AMI remodels the immunological landscape of EOC. In particular, AMI lowered the expression of IDO1, IL-4I1, and PD-L1, the quantity of KYN and indoles, and the level of immunosuppressive immune cells MDSC, Tregs, and CD8+CD39+/PD-1+ T cell. AMI boosted the killing potential of anti-PD-1-directed CD8+T cells and worked in concert with PD-1 inhibitors to suppress tumor growth and to prolong the survival of EOC-bearing mice. This work highlights AMI as an effective regulator of ICB response by manipulating EOC cell TRP metabolism, indicating it could be a potential strategy for improving EOC ICB therapy."

      "abstract": "Tryptophan decarboxylase (TDC) belongs to a family of aromatic amino acid decarboxylases and catalyzes the conversion of tryptophan to tryptamine. It is the enzyme involved in the first step of melatonin (MT) biosynthesis and mediates several key functions in abiotic stress tolerance. In Oryza sativa under pesticide-induced stress, TDC function is unclear. Three TDC differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and six TDC-coding genes were found to be expressed in fluroxypyr-meptyl (FLUME)-treated rice transcriptome datasets, which allowed researchers to explore the properties and roles of rice TDC family genes under pesticide-induced stress. By applying sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis, two subfamilies of the TDC gene family-DUF674 and AAT_I-were found in rice, Glycine max, Zea mays, Hordeum vulgare, and Solanum lycopersicum. According to chromosomal location studies, segmental duplication aided in the expansion of the OsTDC gene family, and the three TDC DEGs in rice were irregularly distributed on two of its 12 chromosomes. In addition, nine rice TDC genes displayed a collinear relationship with those of soybean, maize, barley, and tomato. Rice TDC genes can encode a variety of biotic and abiotic stress responses because of their diverse gene architectures, cis-elements, motif compositions, and conserved domains. Reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) analysis confirmed that a proportion of TDC genes (Os08g0140300, Os08g0140500, and Os10g0380800) were preferably expressed under 0.08 mg L-1 FLUME stress, with a 5.2-, 3.2-, and 3.9-fold increase in roots and a 2.1-, 2.4-, and 2.6-fold increase in shoots, respectively. MT treatment further increased the expression of these genes, with a 2.1-fold, 3.1-fold, and fivefold increase in roots and a 1.5-, 1.1-, and 1.1-fold increase in shoots than that treated with 0.08 mg L-1 FLUME only, respectively. When rice seedling roots and shoots were subjected to 0.08 mg L-1 FLUME stress, TDC activity was increased by 2.7 and 1.6 times higher than in the control, respectively. MT application also further promoted TDC activity in rice tissues; TDC activity in rice roots and shoots was twofold and 1.4-fold higher, respectively, than that under 0.08 mg L-1 FLUME alone. These findings indicate that TDC genes respond effectively to FLUME stress, and the application of MT could enhance the expression of these TDC genes, which comprise a set of candidate genes that regulate pesticide metabolism and degradation with the application of MT.",

      "abstract": "Despite being a groundbreaking approach to treating colorectal cancer (CRC), the efficacy of immunotherapy is significantly compromised by the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment and dysbiotic intestinal microbiota. Here, leveraging the superior carrying capacity and innate immunity-stimulating property of living bacteria, a nanomedicine-engineered bacterium, LR-S-CD/CpG@LNP, with optical responsiveness, immune-stimulating activity, and the ability to regulate microbiota metabolome is developed. Immunoadjuvant (CpG) and carbon dot (CD) co-loaded plant lipid nanoparticles (CD/CpG@LNPs) are constructed and conjugated to the surface of Limosilactobacillus reuteri (LR) via reactive oxygen species (ROS)-responsive linkers. The inherent photothermal and photodynamic properties of oral CD/CpG@LNPs induce in situ cytotoxic ROS generation and immunogenic cell death of colorectal tumor cells. The generated neoantigens and the released CpG function as a potent in situ vaccine that stimulates the maturation of immature dendritic cells. The mature dendritic cells and metabolites secreted by LR subsequently facilitated the tumor infiltration of cytotoxic T lymphocytes to eradicate colorectal tumors. The further in vivo results demonstrate that the photo-immunotherapy and intestinal microbial metabolite regulation of LR-S-CD/CpG@LNPs collectively suppressed the growth of orthotopic colorectal tumors and their liver metastases, presenting a promising avenue for synergistic treatment of CRC via the oral route.",

      "abstract": "Plant Cysteine Oxidases (PCOs) are oxygen-sensing enyzmes that catalyse oxidation of cysteinyl residues at the N-termini of target proteins, triggering their degradation via the N-degron pathway. PCO oxygen sensitivity means that in low oxygen conditions (hypoxia), their activity reduces and target proteins are stabilised. PCO substrates include Group VII Ethylene Response Factors (ERFVIIs) involved in adaptive responses to the acute hypoxia experienced upon plant submergence, as well as Little Zipper 2 (ZPR2) and Vernalisation 2 (VRN2) which are involved in developmental processes in hypoxic niches. The PCOs are potential targets for improving submergence tolerance through enzyme engineering or chemical treatment. To achieve this, a detailed understanding of their biological function is required. Here, we report development of an assay that exploits the intrinsic fluorescence of Arabidopsis thaliana PCO tryptophan residues. By using Ni(II)-substitued enzymes and preparing the assay under anaerobic conditions, tryptophan fluorescence quenching is observed on enzyme:substrate complex formation, allowing quantification of binding affinities. Our assay revealed that, broadly, AtPCO4 and AtPCO5 have stronger interactions with ERFVII substrates than ZPR2 and VRN2, suggesting ERFVIIs are primary targets of these enzymes. It also revealed a positive cooperative binding effect for interactions between AtPCOs4/5 and ERFVIIs and ZPR2. The assay is experimentally straightforward and can be used to further interogate PCO interactions with substrates.",

      "abstract": "Dipeptides were constructed using hydrophobic amino acid residues following AMP prediction. After that Boc-modification was performed on the screened peptides and finally Boc-Phe-Trp-OMe and Boc-Trp-Trp-OMe were synthesized. Even though no inhibition zones were observed in agar well diffusion assays, minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) analysis revealed anti-bacterial activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, with MIC90 ranging from 230 to 400 μg/mL. The crystal violet assay confirmed the dipeptides' biofilm eradication and disruption capabilities. Furthermore, membrane permeabilization assays indicated outer and inner membrane permeabilization, while SEM analysis revealed the formation of fibril and spherical nanostructures, likely contributing to this effect. The peptides also exhibited resistance to protein adsorption, non-cytotoxicity, and non-hemolytic properties, making them promising broad-spectrum anti-bacterial agents with biofilm eradication and disruption potential. This study concludes that Boc-protected phenylalanine- and tryptophan-based dipeptides can self-assemble and can be used as broad-spectrum anti-bacterial agents. The self-assembly of these peptides offers a versatile platform for designing biomaterials with tailored properties and functionalities. Research exploring the anti-bacterial potential of Boc-protected dipeptides has been limited, prompting our investigation to shed light on this overlooked area. Our analysis of synthesized Boc-protected dipeptides revealed notable anti-bacterial activity, marking a significant advancement. This finding suggests that these dipeptides could emerge as potent, broad-spectrum anti-bacterial agents, addressing the urgent need for effective treatments against bacterial resistance and opening new avenues in therapy. This study not only enhances our understanding of these dipeptides but also highlights their potential as innovative and efficacious anti-bacterial agents, making a substantial impact in the clinical field.",

      "abstract": "AIMS: Preeclampsia (PE) is an unusual multisystem condition that occurs during pregnancy and is characterized by maternal endothelial dysfunction and damage to various organs. The catabolism of L-tryptophan (Trp) is involved in various biological activities, including healthy pregnancy. Our previous work revealed that PE significantly elevated the concentration of indole-3-lactic acid (ILA), a Trp derivative, during the third trimester of pregnancy. However, the effects of ILA on the occurrence of PE and its influence on fetoplacental vascular functionality remain unknown. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-five Trp metabolites were detected in maternal serum. The effects of ILA on the functions of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were examined. Furthermore, a soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 (sFlt-1) induced PE-like mouse model was established and treated with ILA. KEY FINDINGS: We found that the ratio of ILA to Trp gradually increased as pregnancy progressed. PE did not significantly change the concentration of ILA during either the first or second trimester. Moreover, as an aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) ligand, ILA promoted HUVEC proliferation, migration and tube formation through the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway after AhR activation. Importantly, ILA administration alleviated sFlt-1-induced PE-like symptoms in mice. Similarly, our in vitro study demonstrated that ILA significantly relieved sFlt-1-induced HUVEC dysfunction by increasing the VEGFA and PIGF levels. SIGNIFICANCE: These data strongly suggest that PE-elevated ILA in the third trimester is a protective mechanism against vascular dysfunction. Therefore, we propose that ILA is a novel and promising therapeutic approach for the treatment of PE that promotes endothelial cell functions.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Precision oncology's implementation in clinical practice faces significant constraints due to the inadequacies in tools for detailed patient stratification and personalized treatment methodologies. Dysregulated tryptophan metabolism has emerged as a crucial factor in tumor progression, encompassing immune suppression, proliferation, metastasis, and metabolic reprogramming. However, its precise role in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) remains unclear, and predictive models or signatures based on tryptophan metabolism are conspicuously lacking. METHODS: The influence of tryptophan metabolism on tumor cells was explored using single-cell RNA sequencing data. Genes involved in tryptophan metabolism were identified across both single-cell and bulk-cell dimensions through weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) and its single-cell data variant (hdWGCNA). Subsequently, a tryptophan metabolism-related signature was developed using an integrated machine-learning approach. This signature was then examined in multi-omics data to assess its associations with patient clinical features, prognosis, cancer malignancy-related pathways, immune microenvironment, genomic characteristics, and responses to immunotherapy and targeted therapy. Finally, the genes within the signature were validated through experiments including qRT-PCR, Western blot, CCK8 assay, and transwell assay. RESULTS: Dysregulated tryptophan metabolism was identified as a potential driver of the malignant transformation of normal epithelial cells. The tryptophan metabolism-related signature (TMRS) demonstrated robust predictive capability for overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) across multiple datasets. Moreover, a high TMRS risk score correlated with increased tumor malignancy, significant metabolic reprogramming, an inflamed yet dysfunctional immune microenvironment, heightened genomic instability, resistance to immunotherapy, and increased sensitivity to certain targeted therapeutics. Experimental validation revealed differential expression of genes within the signature between RCC and adjacent normal tissues, with reduced expression of DDAH1 linked to enhanced proliferation and metastasis of tumor cells. CONCLUSION: This study investigated the potential impact of dysregulated tryptophan metabolism on clear cell renal cell carcinoma, leading to the development of a tryptophan metabolism-related signature that may provide insights into patient prognosis, tumor biological status, and personalized treatment strategies. This signature serves as a valuable reference for further exploring the role of tryptophan metabolism in renal cell carcinoma and for the development of clinical applications based on this metabolic pathway.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a persistent inflammatory bowels disease (IBD) characterized by immune response dysregulation and metabolic disruptions. Tryptophan metabolism has been believed as a significant factor in UC pathogenesis, with specific metabolites influencing immune modulation and gut microbiota interactions. However, the precise regulatory mechanisms and key genes involved remain unclear. METHODS: AUCell, Ucell, and other functional enrichment algorithms were utilized to determine the activation patterns of tryptophan metabolism at the UC cell level. Differential analysis identified key genes associated with tryptophan metabolism. Five machine learning algorithms, including Random Forest, Boruta algorithm, LASSO, SVM-RFE, and GBM were integrated to identify and categorize disease-specific characteristic genes. RESULTS: We observed significant heterogeneity in tryptophan metabolism activity across cell types in UC, with the highest activity levels in macrophages and fibroblasts. Among the key tryptophan metabolism-related genes, CTSS, S100A11, and TUBB were predominantly expressed in macrophages and significantly upregulated in UC, highlighting their involvement in immune dysregulation and inflammation. Cross-analysis with bulk RNA data confirmed the consistent upregulation of these genes in UC samples, highly indicating their relevance in UC pathology and potential as targets for therapeutic intervention. CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first to reveal the heterogeneity of tryptophan metabolism at the single-cell level in UC, with macrophages emerging as key contributors to inflammatory processes. The identification of CTSS, S100A11, and TUBB as key regulators of tryptophan metabolism in UC underscores their potential as biomarkers and therapeutic targets.",

      "abstract": "Melatonin (MT) serves an indispensable function in plant development and their response to abiotic stress. Although numerous drought-tolerance genes have been ascertained in wheat, further investigation into the molecular pathways controlling drought stress tolerance remains necessary. In this investigation, it was observed that MT treatment markedly enhanced drought resistance in wheat by diminishing malondialdehyde (MDA) levels and augmenting the activity of antioxidant enzymes POD, APX, and CAT compared to untreated control plants. Transcriptomic analysis disclosed that melatonin treatment activated the tryptophan metabolism and flavonoid biosynthesis pathways. Furthermore, quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) outcomes validated that the expression trends of these differentially expressed genes aligned with the transcriptomic data. Metabolomic profiling identified alterations in the abundance of several metabolites, including tryptamine, MT, formylanthranilate, 3-hydroxyanthranilate, 6-hydroxymelatonin, naringenin chalcone, astragalin, pinbanksin, and caffeoyl quinic acid. Co-expression analysis suggested that various transcription factors-encompassing AP2/ERF-ERF, WRKY, bZIP, C2H2, bHLH, NAC, and MYB-participated in controlling the differentially expressed genes across multiple pathways. Ultimately, these findings highlight that exogenous MT application bolsters wheat's drought tolerance through the modulation of tryptophan metabolism and flavonoid biosynthesis. These insights provide novel perspectives on the molecular frameworks mediating MT's effect on drought resistance and pinpointing candidate genes for potential genetic enhancement programs in wheat.",

In the in vivo experiments, 3% dextran sulfate sodium(DSS) was used to induce a mouse model of acute colitis, with mesalazine as a positive control. The therapeutic effect of HQD on mice with UC was evaluated according to body weight, disease activity index(DAI), colon length, and pathological changes. Targeted metabolomics was used to detect the concentration of tryptophan and its metabolites in mouse feces. Western blot and RT-qPCR techniques were used to assess the expression levels of colonic aryl hydrocarbon receptor(AhR), myosin light chain kinase(MLCK), myo-sin light chain(MLC), and p-MLC. Serum FITC-dextran concentration, bacterial culture of mesenteric lymph nodes and spleen, as well as fluorescence probe in situ hybridization technique were used to evaluate intestinal epithelial permeability. Alcian blue and nuclear fast red staining, Western blot, and RT-qPCR techniques were used to detect the expression of mucin secreted by the mouse's intestinal epithelial goblet cells. Transmission electron microscopy was utilized to observe the connections of the mouse's intestinal epithelial cells. Immunofluorescence, Western blot, and RT-qPCR techniques were used to assess the expression of tight junction proteins in the mouse's intestinal epithelium. In the in vitro experiments, lipopolysaccharide(LPS) was used to induce intestinal epithelial barrier injury model in Caco2 cells, and AhR siRNA was used to further clarify the mechanism of HQD in activating AhR to improve intestinal barrier function. The results demonstrated that HQD effectively alleviated symptoms and pathological changes in the colon of DSS-induced mice with colitis. Treatment with HQD could regulate tryptophan metabolism in the feces of mice with colitis, activate AhR, and improve the intestinal epithelial barrier. Additionally, the results of the in vitro experiments confirmed that HQD could restore the expression of tight junction proteins in the intestinal epithelium of colitis cells by activating AhR to regulate the MLCK/p-MLC signaling pathway.",

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: The present study was carried out to evaluate the radioprotective activities of N-acetyl-L-tryptophan (L-NAT) using rodent and non-human primate (NHP) models. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The antagonistic effect of L-NAT on the Transient receptor potential vanilloid-1 (TRPV1) receptor and substance P inhibition was determined using molecular docking and Elisa assays. The in vivo radioprotective activity of L-NAT was evaluated using whole-body survival assays in mice and NHPs. Radioprotective activity of L-NAT was also determined at the systemic level using quantitative histological analysis of bone marrow, jejunum, and seminiferous tubules of irradiated mice. RESULTS: Molecular docking studies revealed a strong binding of L-NAT with TRPV1 receptor at similar binding pockets to which capsaicin, an agonist of the TRPV1 receptor, binds. Further, capsaicin and gamma radiation were found to induce substance P levels in the intestines and serum of the mice, while L-NAT pretreatment was found to inhibit it. Significant whole-body survival (>80%) was observed in irradiated (9.0 Gy) mice that pretreated with L-NAT (150 mg/kg, b.wt. im) compared to 0% survival in irradiated mice that not pretreated with L-NAT. The quantitative histology of the hematopoietic, gastrointestinal, and male reproductive systems demonstrated significant protection against radiation-induced cellular degeneration. Interestingly, 100% survival was observed with irradiated NHPs (6.5 Gy) that pretreated with L-NAT (37.5 mg/kg, b.wt.im). Significant improvement in the hematology profile was observed after days 10-20 post-treatment periods in irradiated (6.5 Gy) NHPs that were pretreated with L-NAT. CONCLUSION: L-NAT demonstrated excellent radioprotective activity in the mice and NHP models, probably by antagonizing TRPV1 receptor and subsequently inhibiting substance P expression.",

      "abstract": "Tryptophan (Trp) is an essential amino acid acting as a key nutrition factor regulating animal growth and development. But how Trp modulates food intake in pigs is still not well known. Here, we investigated the effect of dietary supplementation of Trp with different levels on food intake of growing pigs. The data showed that dietary Trp supplementation with the standardised ileal digestibility (SID) Trp to lysine (Lys) ratio at both 0·18 and 0·20 significantly increased the food intake by activating the expression of orexigenic gene agouti-related peptide (AgRP) and inhibiting the expression of anorexigenic gene pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC), cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript (CART) and melanocortin receptor 4 (MC4R) in the hypothalamus. Meanwhile, the level of anorexigenic hormones appetite-regulating peptide YY (PYY) in the duodenum and serum and leptin receptor in the duodenum were also significantly decreased. Importantly, both the kynurenine and serotonin metabolic pathways were activated upon dietary Trp supplementation to downregulate MC4R expression in the hypothalamus. Further mechanistic studies revealed that the reduced MC4R expression activated the hypothalamic AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathway, which in turn inhibited the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)/S6 kinase 1 (S6K1) activity to stimulate food intake. Together, our study unravels the orexigenic effect of dietary Trp supplementation in pigs and expands its potential application in developing nutrition intervention strategy in pig production.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Ulcerative colitis (UC) is an idiopathic inflammatory bowel disease, and the range of current clinical treatments is not ideal. We previously found that polysaccharide of Atractylodes macrocephala Koidz (PAMK) is beneficial in DSS-induced colitis, and we aimed to investigate the underlying mechanisms in this study. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: PAMK was used to treat DSS-induced colitis in mice, 16S rRNA sequencing analysis was used to detect changes in the intestinal microbiota, targeted metabolomics analysis was used to determine the content of tryptophan-metabolizing bacteria, and western blotting was used to determine aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) and pregnane X receptor (PXR) levels. Furthermore, antibiotic-mediated depletion of gut microbiota and faecal microbiota transplantation were performed to assess the role of the gut microbiota in PAMK alleviation of colitis. KEY RESULTS: PAMK treatment relieved intestinal microbiota dysbiosis in mice with colitis, contributed to the proliferation of tryptophan-metabolizing bacteria, and increased the levels of tryptophan metabolites, resulting in a significant increase in the nuclear translocation of PXR and expression of PXR and its target genes, but not AhR. The gut microbiota is important in PAMK treatment of colitis, including in the alleviation of symptoms, inhibition of inflammation, maintenance of the integrity of the intestinal barrier, and the regulation of the Th17/Treg cell balance. CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS: Based on our findings, we elucidate a novel mechanism by which PAMK alleviates DSS-induced colitis and thus provides evidence to support the potential development of PAMK as a new clinical drug against UC.",

The present study aimed to evaluate the therapeutic effect of molecular hydrogen in a CUMS rat model. METHODS: A total of 40 SD rats were randomly divided into a control group, a model group, a hydrogen group, and a positive drug group. Four weeks post-modeling, hydrogen inhalation and other treatments were administered. Behavioral, biochemical, and immunohistochemical evaluations were performed after treatment. RESULTS: Hydrogen inhalation alleviated depressive behavior and hippocampal neuronal damage in CUMS rats, as well as restored the levels of neurotransmitters, inflammatory factors, and oxidative stress. Moreover, it maintained mitochondrial homeostasis and up-regulated the expression of PGC-1α, PINK1, and Parkin. CONCLUSIONS: The results collectively indicated that hydrogen significantly attenuated CUMS-induced depressive-like behavior and monoamine neurotransmitter deficiency, as well as protected the brain from oxidative stress and inflammatory damage and effectively preserved mitochondrial homeostasis.",

Tryptophan metabolism is important for HCC cell proliferation, metastasis, and invasion. It is unclear whether KLF7 could regulate Trp metabolism in HCC. In this study, we found that Trp metabolism was suppressed in HCC cells with KLF7 knockdown. The mRNA and protein levels of SLC1A5, SLC7A5, and TPH1, as well as the content of Trp and serotonin, were reduced after KLF7 knockdown, and were potentiated following KLF7 overexpression. Increasing the content of serotonin could restore the malignancy of tumour cells in vitro and tumour growth in vivo. Conversely, decreasing the content of serotonin suppressed HCC cell proliferation. The binding activity of KLF7 was on the promoter of SLC1A5, and KLF7 positively regulated the expression of SLC1A5. KLF7 contributed to the proliferation and migration of HCC cells by up-regulation of SLC1A5. Collectively, KLF7 promotes the progression of HCC through regulating Trp metabolism. The newly identified axis of KLF7/ SLC1A5 in HCC could represent a potential target for HCC therapy.",

      "abstract": "L-Tryptophan (Trp) is an essential amino acid with numerous health benefits. However, incorporating Trp into food products is limited due to its pronounced bitter taste. Encapsulating Trp in nanoparticles by using other natural biopolymers is a potential strategy to mask the bitter taste of Trp in the final products. Whey protein isolate (WPI), composed of alpha-lactalbumin (α-LA), bovine serum albumin (BSA), and beta-lactoglobulin (β-LG), has played a crucial role in delivering bioactive compounds. In order to incorporate Trp within WPI, the present study used a combination of pH-shifting andthermal treatment to fabricatewhey protein isolate-tryptophan nanoparticles (WPI-Trp-NPs). During the pH-shifting technique, WPI unfolds at high pH, such as pH 11, and the dissociated WPI molecules are refolded when pH is shifted back to neutral, creating particles with uniform dispersion and encapsulating smaller particles surrounding them in solution. Further, the well-distributed nanoparticles formed by pH-shifting might encourage the formation of more uniform nanoparticles during subsequent thermal treatment. TheWPI-Trp particles have an average particle size of 110.1 nm and a low average PDI of 0.20. Fluorescence spectroscopy confirmed the encapsulation of Trp by WPI, which shows higher fluorescence when the Trp is encapsulated by the WPI. Surface hydrophobicity, circular dichroism, particle size, free sulfhydryl, and antioxidant activity were used to characterize the WPI-Trp-NPs. WPI-Trp-NPs formed by pH-shifting combined with heating showed a higher surface hydrophobicity and free sulfhydryl content than the untreated WPI-Trp mixture. The conversion of α-helix into random coil in the WPI secondary structure indicated a more disordered structure of the modified whey protein. Molecular docking results indicate the interactions between Trp and WPI, including alpha-lactalbumin (α-LA), bovine serum albumin, and beta-lactoglobulin (β-LG), were mainly driven by hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonding. The binding affinity between Trp and these proteins was ranked as α-LA>BSA>β-LG. The combination of pH-shifting and heating improved the functionalityof WPI and was an effective way to fabricate WPI-Trp nanoparticles.",

The microbiome is a mediator of the dissemination of stress effects to the offspring through immunomodulation and metabolite production. Metabolites derived from the mother and their gut microbiota pass to the foetus and can affect immune and nervous development. Stress affects the abundance of such metabolites, including the tryptophan (Trp) pathway, which are involved in immune and nervous system function. We hypothesized that the PNS is associated with dysregulation of Trp metabolism. We further posited that treatment with a Trp-metaboliser Parasutterella excrementihominis would abrogate PNS-associated deleterious effects on offspring development. To test this hypothesis, pregnant mice were exposed to restraint stress and administered P. excrementihominis (Dam n = 3-9; Offspring n = 5-10). PNS increased maternal gut Trp and both maternal and offspring inflammation. P. excrementihominis treatment reduced the PNS-induced excess pool of maternal gut Trp. Some PNS effects on foetal neuroinflammation were reduced in severity due to handling effects from bacterial gavage. However, P. excrementihominis was anti-inflammatory in dam and offspring and anxiolytic in offspring of Pe-treated dams. These data illustrate that elevated Trp levels are associated PNS and its downstream deleterious offspring inflammatory and behavioural outcomes while P. excrementihominis, a Trp-metabolizer, can ameliorate these effects and improve offspring outcomes."

      "abstract": "Intestinal dysbiosis and the associated l-tryptophan metabolic disorder are pivotal in inflammatory bowel disease progression, leading to a compromised intestinal barrier integrity. Remedying the dysfunction in tryptophan metabolism has emerged as a promising therapeutic strategy. Herein, we reprogram the tryptophan metabolism in situ by EcN-TRP@A/G, encapsulating the engineered probiotic, EcN-TRP, with enhanced tryptophan synthesis capacity, for sustained modulation, thereby restoring intestinal barrier function and microbial homeostasis. The pH-responsive dual-layered EcN-TRP@A/G microcapsule developed via high-voltage electrospraying and liquid interface self-assembly, preserved probiotic viability in the harsh gastrointestinal milieu, and facilitated targeted colon release. Bioluminescent tracking in mice reveals a 22.84-fold increase in EcN-TRP@A/G viability and distribution compared to naked EcN-TRP. Targeted metabolomics highlights EcN-TRP@A/G's modulation of the tryptophan-indole pathway. Oral administration of EcN-TRP@A/G sustained elevates indole metabolites, particularly indole-3-acetic acid and indole-3-propionic acid, in colon tissue for up to 7 days. In IBD mice, EcN-TRP@A/G improves intestinal permeability, reduces inflammation, and recovers the gut microbiome by enhancing beneficial bacteria abundance like Prevotellaceae_UCG-001 and Anaerostipes while suppressing pathogenic strains like Escherichia-Shigella. Our findings offer a cost-effective approach, harnessing the probiotic metabolic potential in situ through engineered modifications for effective IBD treatment.",

      "abstract": "Dysbiosis is a notable marker of intestinal mucositis, an inflammatory condition induced by antineoplastic chemotherapy. Scientific evidence supports the effectiveness of probiotics in managing dysbiosis associated with intestinal mucositis. It is known that tryptophan metabolism is a regulatory component in the multifactorial phenomenon of mucosal homeostasis. In the face of that, we aimed to investigate if oral administration of Weissella paramesenteroides WpK4, a probiotic candidate strain, has a protective effect in a murine model of intestinal mucositis induced by 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and if tryptophan metabolism plays any role in this effect. Gavage with viable cells of W. paramesenteroides WpK4 increased intestinal mucus production, regeneration of villi, as well as control of dysbiosis in mice submitted to 5-FU chemotherapy, and resulted in 100% survival, unlike the control saline-treated group, which resulted in 60% survival of mice after mucositis induction. Weissella paramesenteroides WpK4 genome harbors sequences encoding enzymes for tryptophan production and catabolism and can synthesize tryptophan, tryptamine, and indole acetic acid in vitro. Besides, oral administration of WpK4 induced increased expression of molecules involved in tryptophan metabolism in mouse ileum and serum. Notably, simultaneous treatment with alfa-naphthoflavone, an aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) inhibitor, abolished the protective effects exerted by W. paramesenteroides Wpk4, as manifested by a significant decline in body weight, suggesting that treatment with the probiotic strain modulates AhR activation. Our results suggest that tryptophan metabolism is potentially involved in the protective effects caused by oral administration of W. paramesenteroides WpK4 to mice during gut inflammatory conditions induced by 5-FU."

This review aimed to identify the effect addictive substances have on the kynurenine pathway. Tryptophan is an essential amino acid metabolized by the serotonin and kynurenine pathways. The metabolites of these pathways play a role in the biological reward system. Addictive substances have been shown to cause imbalances in the ratios of these metabolites. With current treatment and therapeutic options being suboptimal, identifying biochemical mechanisms that are impacted during the use of addictive substances can provide alternative options for treatment or drug discovery. Methods: A systematic literature search was conducted to identify studies evaluating the relationship between substance use disorder and tryptophan metabolism through the kynurenine pathway. A total of 32 articles meeting eligibility criteria were used to review the relationship between the kynurenine pathway, tryptophan breakdown, and addictive substances. Results: The use of addictive substances dysregulates tryptophan metabolism and kynurenine metabolite concentrations. This imbalance directly affects the dopamine reward system and is thought to promote continued substance use. Conclusions: Further studies are needed to fully evaluate the metabolites of the kynurenine pathway, along with other options for treatment to repair the metabolite imbalance. Several possible therapeutics have been identified; drugs that restore homeostasis, such as Ro 61-8048 and natural products like Tinospora cordifolia or Decaisnea insignis, are promising options for the treatment of substance use disorder."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Depression and memory loss are prevalent neurodegenerative disorders, with diabetic patients facing an elevated risk of brain dysfunction. Methylglyoxal (MGO) formation, which is heightened in diabetes owing to hyperglycemia and gut dysbiosis, may serve as a critical link between diabetes and brain diseases. Despite the high prevalence of MGO, the precise mechanisms underlying MGO-induced depression and memory loss remain unclear. RESULTS: We investigated the effect of MGO stress on depression like-behavior and memory loss to elucidate the potential interplay between MGO-induced tryptophan (Trp) metabolism impairment and oxidative stress in the brain. It demonstrates that MGO induces depression-like behavior in mice, as confirmed by the OFT, TST, FST, SPT, and EPM behavioral tests. MGO led to the depletion of Trp and related neurotransmitters as 5-HT, EPI, and DA in the mouse brain. Additionally, MGO reduced the cell count in the DG, CA1, and CA3 hippocampal regions and modulated TPH2 levels in the brain. Notably, co-treatment with MGO and Trp mirrored the effects observed after Trp-null treatment in neurons, including reduced TPH1 and TPH2 levels and inhibition of neuronal outgrowth. Furthermore, MGO significantly altered the expression of key proteins associated with neurodegeneration, such as p-Tau, p-GSK-3β, APP, oAβ, BDNF, NGF, and p-TrkB. Concurrently, MGO activated MAPKs through ROS induction, triggering a redox imbalance by downregulating Nrf-2, Ho-1, TXNRD1, Trx, Sirt-3, and Sirt-5 expression levels, NAD+, and CAT activity in the mouse brain. This led to an accelerated neuroinflammatory response, as evidenced by increased expression of Iba-1, p-NF-κB, and the secretion of IL-6 and TNF-α. Importantly, Trp treatment ameliorated MGO-induced depression like-behavior and memory loss in mice and markedly mitigated increased expression of p-Tau, APP, p-ERK1/2, p-pJNK, and p-NF-κB in the brain. Likewise, Trp treatment also induced the expression of MGO detoxifying factors GLO-I and GLO-II and CAT activity, suggesting the induction of an antioxidant system and reduced inflammation by inhibiting IL-6 and TNF-α secretion. CONCLUSIONS: Our data revealed that MGO-induced depression like-behavior and memory deficits resulted from disturbances in Trp, 5-HT, BDNF, and NGF levels, increased p-Tau and APP expression, neuroinflammation, and impaired redox status (Nrf-2/Ho-1/TXNRD1/Sirt3/5) in the brain.",

Modifying severe alcohol-associated hepatitis (AH) dysbiosis improves liver injury through tryptophan (Trp) metabolites and the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR). However, Trp's effect on the IM in alcohol use disorder (AUD) patients remains unclear. Here, we used an in vitro microbiota modeling system named Minibioreactor arrays (MBRAs). Feces from AUD patients with or without AH were treated with low, normal, or high Trp concentrations, with subsequent treatment with alcohol. Microbiota composition and AhR activity were studied. We showed that microbial communities from donors were maintained in MBRAs. High and low Trp increased the abundance of pathogen Escherichia Shigella. In the absence of alcohol, Trp changed more bacteria in AUD IM compared to AH IM. Normal Trp increased the AhR activity. Overall, maintaining normal Trp levels may prevent dysbiosis in AUD or AH, pending in vivo confirmation.",

      "abstract": "The balance of gut microbiota affects uric acid synthesis and excretion, influencing the development of hyperuricemia. This study aimed to investigate the effects and mechanisms of probiotics on hyperuricemia and adenine- and potassium oxonate-induced colonic damage. After two months of gavage at 109 CFU/day, the probiotic strains Lactobacillus rhamnosus UA260 and Lactobacillus plantarum YU28, identified through in vitro screening, significantly reduced serum uric acid levels in hyperuricemia mice from 109.71 ± 56.33 to 38.76 ± 15.06 and 33.22 ± 6.91 μmol/L, respectively. These strains attenuated inflammatory, repaired gut barrier damage, and enhanced colonic uric acid transporter function, thereby promoting uric acid excretion. Furthermore, the probiotics significantly reshaped gut microbiota by increasing the abundance of beneficial bacteria, including Lactobacillus and Coprococcus, while modulating tryptophan, purine, and riboflavin metabolism. Changes in tryptophan metabolites, specifically indole-3-propionic acid and indole-3-acetic acid, were correlated with xanthine oxidase activity, colonic injury, and the expression of the uric acid transporter protein ABCG2 during treatment. Probiotics intervention activated aryl hydrocarbon receptor pathways. These findings suggest that probiotics alleviate hyperuricemia and colonic inflammatory by regulating gut microbiota composition and tryptophan microbial metabolite pathways. Probiotics that modulate tryptophan microbial metabolism may provide a potential strategy for treating or preventing hyperuricemia.",

As an essential amino acid, tryptophan (TRP) participates in a variety of physiological functions in the body and affects the growth and health of the human body. TRP catabolites produced by the gut microbiota are important signaling molecules for microbial communities and host-microbe interactions, and play an important role in maintaining health and disease pathogenesis. METHODS AND RESULTS: The review first demonstrates the evidence of TRP metabolism in stroke and the relationship between gut microbiota and TRP metabolism. Furthermore, the review reveals that food homologous plants (FHP) bioactive compounds have been shown to regulate various metabolic pathways of the gut microbiota, including the biosynthesis of valine, leucine, isoleucine, and vitamin B6 metabolism. The most notable metabolic alteration is in TRP metabolism. CONCLUSION: The interaction between gut microbiota and TRP metabolism offers a plausible explanation for the notable bioactivities of FHP in the treatment of ischemic stroke (IS). This review enhances the comprehension of the underlying mechanisms associated with the bioactivity of FHP on IS.",

      "abstract": "The pathogenesis of depression is complex, involving abnormalities in tryptophan (TRP) metabolism through the kynurenine pathway (KP). Moreover, depression is closely related to the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, the gut-brain axis, neuroinflammation, and stress. These factors collectively influence the multidimensional pathological mechanisms of depression. TRP, a fundamental amino acid, serves as a precursor for neuroactive metabolites vital to physiological functions. Central to TRP metabolism is the KP, and the imbalance between neurotoxic and neuroprotective metabolites is closely related to the onset and progression of depression. Therefore, maintaining the balance of KP metabolites is important. In this review, we have investigated the role of the KP in depression and explored the complexity of KP dysregulation and its therapeutic importance. Here, we highlight how a deeper understanding of the KP and its regulation can pave the way for new treatment strategies. Specifically, we have summarized the latest advances in elucidating the key mechanisms of rate-limiting enzyme inhibitors, providing insights into their potential therapeutic efficacy. In addition, we have explored the emerging field of Chinese herbal medicine, discussing its potential to regulate KP metabolites and alleviate depressive symptoms, thereby expanding the treatment options for depression. Our findings emphasize the multifaceted nature of depression and the necessity of interdisciplinary research to fully utilize KP regulation and Chinese herbal medicine as strategies to advance the treatment of depression.",

      "abstract": "Plant-based foods offer a sustainable alternative to meet the growing protein demand. Legumes are the most promising of these, as they contain relatively high concentrations of protein, low digestible starch, and dietary fiber, as well as them possibly featuring low levels of fat. Enzymatically modified legume proteins provide us with tempting perspectives in terms of enhancing foods' biological values. However, their bioavailability and digestibility are generally less sufficient than that of proteins of animal origin, which may be improved by well-tailored enzyme modification. In this study, the efficacy of three plant-based proteases (bromelain, ficin, and papain) were evaluated at two distinct concentrations (2.5% and 10%) and three hydrolysis durations (1, 2, and 12 h) when transforming chickpea and lentil proteins. The degree of hydrolysis (DH), peptide profiles, and free amino acid content were analyzed to determine the efficiency of each enzyme. Results showed significant variations in DH, which was influenced by enzyme type, concentration, and hydrolysis duration. Papain exhibited the highest DH, particularly at a 10% concentration, reaching 27.8% efficiency in chickpea and 34.8% in lentils after 12 h. Bromelain and ficin were proven to be less effective, with ficin showing the least hydrolytic activity. SDS-PAGE analysis revealed substantial protein degradation, especially subsequent to papain treatment, pointing out that most proteins were cleaved into smaller peptides. SEC-HPLC indicated a predominant release of peptides within the 200-1000 Da range, suggesting enhanced bioavailability. Papain and bromelain treatments resulted in a significant release of oligopeptides and dipeptides. UHPLC analysis highlighted a marked post-hydrolysis increase in total free amino acids, with arginine, leucine, and lysine being the most abundant ones. Notably, tryptophan, being undetectable in untreated samples, was released in measurable amounts post-hydrolysis. These findings demonstrate papain's superior performance in protein hydrolysis and its potential in producing bioactive peptides, highlighting its applicability in food processing and the development of both nutraceuticals and functional foods."

      "abstract": "Ovarian cancer is the third most common gynecological malignancy worldwide and the fifth leading cause of cancer-related death among women. This may be attributed to difficulties in diagnosing early-stage ovarian cancer, as it is typically asymptomatic until metastases, and due to the ineffective management of patients with late-stage ovarian cancer. The aim of the present study was to investigate potential therapeutic targets for the treatment of ovarian cancer. Bioinformatics techniques were used to analyze the expression levels of tryptophan (Trp) metabolism-related genes in tissue samples from patients with ovarian cancer. Additionally, western blots, clonogenic assays, immunohistochemical staining, chromatin immunoprecipitation-quantitative PCR, cell co-culture assays, a xenograft model and high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry were performed to evaluate the antitumor effects of genes identified from the bioinformatics analysis. Increased expression levels of the amino acid transporter, solute carrier family 7 member 5 (SLC7A5), in tissue samples from patients with ovarian cancer was demonstrated. Inhibition of SLC7A5 reduced ovarian cancer cell proliferation through G2/M cell cycle arrest and blocked intracellular aryl hydrocarbon receptor nucleus entry, which downregulated PD-L1 expression levels. Dysregulation of Trp metabolism in ovarian cancer tissue samples, as well as the upregulation of kynurenine expression levels in the plasma of patients with ovarian cancer, were demonstrated to be unfavorable prognostic factors for the progression-free survival of patients with ovarian cancer. The present study demonstrated that the dysregulation of Trp metabolism could potentially be used as a diagnostic biomarker for ovarian cancer, as well as the potential of targeting SLC7A5 for immunotherapeutic management of patients with ovarian cancer in the future."

      "abstract": "In the first days of life, the newborns' intestinal microbiota develops simultaneously with the intestinal gut barrier and follows intestinal immunity. The mode of delivery shows significant impact on microbial development and, thus, the initiation of the tryptophan catabolism pathway. Further antibiotics (ATB) treatment of mothers before or during delivery affects the microbial and tryptophan metabolite composition of stool of the caesarean- and vaginal-delivered newborns. The determination of microbiome and levels of tryptophan microbial metabolites in meconium and stool can characterize intestinal colonization of a newborn. From 134 samples from the Central European Longitudinal Studies of Parents and Children: The Next Generation (CELSPAC: TNG) cohort study, 16S rRNA gene sequencing was performed, and microbial tryptophan metabolites were quantified using ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography with triple-quadrupole mass spectrometry. Microbial diversity and concentrations of tryptophan metabolites were significantly higher in stool compared to meconium. Treatment of mothers with ATB before or during delivery affects metabolite composition and microbial diversity in stool of vaginal- and caesarean-delivered newborns. Correlation of microbial and metabolite composition shows significant positive correlations of indol-3-lactic acid, N-acetyl-tryptophan and indol-3-acetic acid with Bifidobacterium, Bacteroides and Peptoclostridium. The positive effect of vaginal delivery on newborns' microbiome development is degraded when mother is treated with ATB before or during delivery. KEY POINTS: • Antibiotic treatment diminishes the positive effects of vaginal delivery. • Antibiotic treatment affects metabolite and microbial composition in newborns. • Bifidobacterium and Peptoclostridium could be the producer of indole-lactic acid.",

      "abstract": "The increasing prevalence of non-tuberculous mycobacterium (NTM) infections alongside tuberculosis (TB) underscores a pressing public health challenge. Yet, the mechanisms governing their infection within the lung remain poorly understood. Here, we integrate metagenomic sequencing, metabolomic sequencing, machine learning classifiers, SparCC, and MetOrigin methods to profile bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) samples from NTM/TB patients. Our aim is to unravel the intricate interplay between lung microbial communities and NTM/Mycobacterium tuberculosis infections. Our investigation reveals a discernible reduction in the compositional diversity of the lung microbiota and a diminished degree of mutual interaction concomitant with NTM/TB infections. Notably, NTM patients exhibit a distinct microbial community characterized by marked specialization and notable enrichment of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus, driving pronounced niche specialization for NTM infection. Simultaneously, these microbial shifts significantly disrupt tryptophan metabolism in NTM infection, leading to an elevation of kynurenine. Mycobacterium intracellulare, Mycobacterium paraintracellulare, Mycobacterium abscessus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa have been implicated in the metabolic pathways associated with the conversion of indole to tryptophan via tryptophan synthase within NTM patients. Additionally, indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase converts tryptophan into kynurenine, fostering an immunosuppressive milieu during NTM infection. This strategic modulation supports microbial persistence, enabling evasion from immune surveillance and perpetuating a protracted state of NTM infection. The elucidation of these nuanced microbial and metabolic dynamics provides a profound understanding of the intricate processes underlying NTM and TB infections, offering potential avenues for therapeutic intervention and management.",

Psilocybin has been designated a 'Breakthrough Therapy' by the US Food and Drug Administration, and therefore a sustainable production process must be established to meet future market demands. Here, we present the development of an in vivo psilocybin production chassis based on repression of l-tryptophan catabolism. We demonstrate the proof of principle in Saccharomyces cerevisiae expressing the psilocybin biosynthetic genes. Deletion of the two aminotransferase genes ARO8/9 and the indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase gene BNA2 yielded a fivefold increase of psilocybin titre. We transferred this knowledge to the filamentous fungus Aspergillus nidulans and identified functional ARO8/9 orthologs involved in fungal l-tryptophan catabolism by genome mining and cross-complementation. The double deletion mutant of A. nidulans resulted in a 10-fold increased psilocybin production. Process optimization based on respiratory activity measurements led to a final psilocybin titre of 267 mg/L in batch cultures with a space-time-yield of 3.7 mg/L/h. These results demonstrate the suitability of our engineered A. nidulans to serve as a production strain for psilocybin and other tryptamine-derived pharmaceuticals.",

The purpose of this study was to investigate the association of nicotinamide and tryptophan metabolism with prognosis and immune status of gliomas and to develop relevant models for predicting prognosis and sensitivity to immunotherapy in gliomas. METHODS: Bulk and single-cell transcriptome data from TCGA, CGGA and GSE159416 were obtained for this study. Gliomas were classified based on nicotinamide and tryptophan metabolism, and PPI network associated with differentially expressed genes was established. The core genes were identified and the risk model was established by machine learning techniques, including univariate Cox regression and LASSO regression. Then the risk model was validated with data from the CGGA. Finally, the effects of genes in the risk model on the biological behavior of gliomas were verified by in vitro experiments. RESULTS: The high nicotinamide and tryptophan metabolism is associated with poor prognosis and high levels of immune cell infiltration in glioma. Seven of the core genes related to nicotinamide and tryptophan metabolism were used to construct a risk model, and the model has good predictive ability for prognosis, immune microenvironment, and response to immune checkpoint therapy of glioma. We also confirmed that high expression of TGFBI can lead to an increased level of migration, invasion, and EMT of glioma cells, and the aforementioned effect of TGFBI can be reduced by FAK inhibitor PF-573,228. CONCLUSIONS: Our study evaluated the effects of nicotinamide and tryptophan metabolism on the prognosis and tumor immune microenvironment of glioma, which can help predict the prognosis and sensitivity to immunotherapy of glioma.",

      "abstract": "It has been shown that chronic restraint stress (CRS) increases adrenal 5-HT levels and turnover through a mechanism that appears unrelated to tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH). In the present study we re-analyzed the effects of CRS (20 min/day) for 14 days relative to control (CTRL) conditions on TPH expression, distribution, and activity in rat adrenal glands. On day 15, adrenal glands were collected for TPH1 and TPH2 immunohistochemistry, Western blot, and RT-PCR; TPH activity was estimated by quantification of 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) and, indirectly, through measurement of 5-HT and 5-hydroxindolacetic acid (5-HIAA) levels and turnover (5-HIAA/5-HT ratio) by HPLC. TPH expression and activity in the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) were also determined for comparison. TPH1 and TPH2 immunostaining was observed in the adrenal medulla, and measurable levels of TPH1 and TPH2 protein and mRNA were detected in rat adrenal glands from CTRL animals. CRS exposure noticeably increased TPH2- but not THP1-immunostaining in the medulla and the outer adrenocortical areas of left (LAG) but not of right adrenal glands (RAG). In addition, CRS exposure increased TPH2 protein and mRNA levels in LAG; however, both measures decreased in DRN. Finally, CRS treatment produced an increase and a decrease of TPH activity and 5-HT turnover in LAG and DRN, respectively. Results indicate that TPH is indeed expressed in rat adrenal glands. Exposure to CRS upregulates TPH2 in LAG, while inducing downregulation of it in the DRN. Then, the increased levels of 5-HT in LAG from CRS-exposed animals likely results from TPH2-mediated synthesis.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Pouchitis is the most common complication after IPAA for ulcerative colitis. The protective effect of tryptophan metabolites on the mucosal barrier may be effective for treating pouchitis. The role of tryptophan metabolites on pouchitis remained unclear. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to establish a murine model of dextran sulfate sodium-induced pouchitis to examine the roles of tryptophan metabolites in its pathogenesis. DESIGN: This is a study that combines clinical patient data and animal research. A total of 22 patients were enrolled: 5 patients with familial adenomatous polyposis after IPAA, 8 patients with ulcerative colitis after IPAA with pouchitis, and 9 patients with ulcerative colitis after IPAA with normal pouch. The demographic data and fecal samples of patients were collected. Male C57BL/6 mice were purchased from a licensed breeder and underwent IPAA to establish a murine model of the pouch. The blood, feces, and tissues of mice were collected. SETTINGS: This study was performed in an academic medical center in China. INTERVENTIONS: The demographic data of patients were observationally collected. The mice that underwent IPAA were divided into a control group that received a chow diet and 5 study groups: 1) dextran sulfate sodium, 2) 6-formylindolo[3,2-b] carbazole + dextran sulfate sodium, 3) high tryptophan diet + dextran sulfate sodium, 4) CH-223191 + dextran sulfate sodium, and 5) indole-3-carboxaldehyde + dextran sulfate sodium. Animals were euthanized after receiving dextran sulfate sodium for 7 days. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Fecal tryptophan metabolite level and microbiome composition, the severity of pouchitis, intestinal mucosal barrier function, and activation of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor-interleukin 22 pathway were assessed. RESULTS: Patients with pouchitis had lower fecal microbial diversity and indole-3-acetic acid levels. In the murine pouchitis model, high tryptophan diet increased fecal levels of 3-indoleglyoxylic acid, indole-3-aldehyde, and indole. A high tryptophan diet and intraperitoneal aryl hydrocarbon receptor ligand 6-formylindolo[3,2-b] carbazole injection alleviated pouchitis. Tryptophan metabolites improved pouch mucosal barriers. Aryl hydrocarbon receptor inhibitors exacerbated experimental pouchitis and disrupted the mucosal barrier; however, the aryl hydrocarbon receptor ligand indole-3-carboxaldehyde reversed this effect. LIMITATIONS: This study was limited by a small human sample size and lacked an aryl hydrocarbon receptor knockout mouse model. CONCLUSIONS: A high tryptophan diet and aryl hydrocarbon receptor ligand alleviated dextran sulfate sodium-induced pouchitis in a murine IPAA model, which might be achieved through regulating epithelial tight junctions and promoting goblet cell differentiation, as well as maintaining the integrity and function of the mucosal barrier. This study provides a rationale for the clinical application of aryl hydrocarbon receptor ligands in the treatment of pouchitis. See Video Abstract . LOS METABOLITOS DEL TRIPTFANO MEJORAN LA BARRERA DE LA MUCOSA INTESTINAL A TRAVS DE LA VA DEL RECEPTOR DE HIDROCARBUROS ARILOINTERLEUCINA EN LA RESERVORITIS INDUCIDA POR SULFATO DE SODIO Y DEXTRANO EN MODELO MURINO: ANTECEDENTES:La reservoritis es la complicación más frecuente después de la anastomosis del reservorio ileal con el ano en la colitis ulcerosa. El efecto protector de los metabolitos del triptófano sobre la barrera mucosa puede ser un método eficaz para tratar la reservoritis. El papel de los metabolitos del triptófano en la reservoritis sigue sin estar claro.OBJETIVO:Nuestro objetivo era establecer un modelo murino de reservoritis inducida por sulfato de dextrano sódico para examinar el papel de los metabolitos del triptófano en su patogenia.DISEÑO:Este es un estudio que combina datos clínicos de pacientes e investigación animal. Se inscribieron un total de 22 pacientes: 5 con poliposis adenomatosa familiar después de un reservorio ileal, ocho pacientes con colitis ulcerosa después de un reservorio ileal que desarrollaron reservoritis y 9 pacientes con colitis ulcerosa después de un reservorio ileal que no presentaron reservoritis. Se recogieron los datos demográficos y las muestras fecales de los pacientes. Se adquirieron ratones macho C57BL/6 de un criador autorizado y se les realizó un reservorio ileal para establecer un modelo murino del reservorio. Se recogieron sangre, heces y tejidos de los ratones.CONFIGURACIÓN:Este estudio se realizó en un centro médico académico en China.INTERVENCIONES:Los datos demográficos de los pacientes se recogieron de forma observacional. Los ratones sometidos a un reservorio ileal se dividieron en seis grupos: grupo de control con dieta normal, sulfato de dextrano sódico, 6-formilindolo[3,2-b] carbazol + sulfato de dextrano sódico, dieta rica en triptófano + sulfato de dextrano sódico, CH-223191 + sulfato de dextrano sódico, indol-3-carboxaldehído + sulfato de dextrano sódico. Los animales fueron sacrificados después de la administración de sulfato de dextrano sódico durante 7 días.PRINCIPALES MEDIDAS DE RESULTADOS:Se evaluaron los niveles de metabolitos de triptófano y la composición del microbioma fecal, la gravedad de la reservoritis, la función de barrera de la mucosa intestinal y la activación de la vía del receptor de hidrocarburos de arilo-interleucina 22.RESULTADOS:Los pacientes con reservoritis tenían una menor diversidad microbiana fecal y niveles de ácido indol-3-acético. En el modelo de reservoritis murino, la dieta rica en triptófano aumentó los niveles fecales de ácido 3-indolglioxílico, indol-3-aldehído e indol. Una dieta rica en triptófano y una inyección intraperitoneal del ligando del receptor de hidrocarburos de arilo 6-formilindolo[3,2-b] carbazol aliviaron la reservoritis. Los metabolitos de triptófano mejoraron las barreras de la mucosa de la reservoritis. Los inhibidores del receptor de hidrocarburos de arilo exacerbaron la reservoritis experimental y alteraron la barrera mucosa; sin embargo, el ligando del receptor de hidrocarburos de arilo indol-3-carboxaldehído revirtió este efecto.LIMITACIONES:Este estudio estuvo limitado por el pequeño tamaño de la muestra humana y la falta de un modelo de ratón con deficiencia del receptor de hidrocarburos arílicos.CONCLUSIONES:Una dieta rica en triptófano y un ligando del receptor de hidrocarburos arílicos aliviaron la reservoritis inducida por sulfato de dextrano sódico en un modelo murino de anastomosis de reservorio ileo-anal, lo que podría deberse a la regulación de las uniones estrechas epiteliales y la promoción de la diferenciación de las células caliciformes, así como al mantenimiento de la integridad y la función de la barrera mucosa. Este estudio proporciona una justificación para la aplicación clínica de los ligandos del receptor de hidrocarburos arílicos en el tratamiento de la reservoritis. (Traducción-Dr. Felipe Bellolio ).",

      "abstract": "To investigate the differences in serum tryptophan, lysine, and phenylalanine levels in breast cancer patients, the correlation between the three amino acids with the chemotherapy regimen, and their significance in the clinical diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer.Clinical data were collected from the Department of Breast Surgery at Yunnan Cancer Hospital, encompassing 216 cases from July to December 2020, including 91 healthy individuals, 38 with benign tumors, and 87 with cancer. Amino acid levels were measured using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Statistical analyses, such as the Kruskal-Wallis H-test and Wilcoxon test, were conducted to compare the levels of these amino acids across the healthy group, benign tumor group, and breast cancer group. The χ2 test and Fisher's exact probability method were employed to assess the relationship between amino acid levels and breast cancer stage, grade, and chemotherapy regimen.The results indicated that there were significant differences in serum lysine (H = 36.13, P < .001) and phenylalanine (H = 34.03, P < .001) levels among the three groups. However, tryptophan levels did not show statistically significant variances. Specifically, lysine and phenylalanine levels were significantly different when comparing the healthy group with the breast cancer group and the benign tumor group with the breast cancer group. These differences were not significant when comparing the healthy group with the benign tumor group. Furthermore, there were no statistically significant distinctions observed in lysine (F = 0.836, P > .05) and phenylalanine (F = 1.466, P > .05) levels across different conventional chemotherapy regimens among the breast cancer cases studied.Serum lysine and phenylalanine levels might serve as potential biomarkers for breast cancer, and the choice of chemotherapy regimen is unlikely to impact significant changes in these amino acid levels.",

      "abstract": "A previous study showed that kiwifruit polysaccharide (KFP) has benefits in relieving intestinal inflammation, while the underlying mechanism remains unresolved. The objective of this study was to investigate the regulatory effect of KFP on the gut microbiota metabolism and intestinal barrier of ulcerative colitis (UC) mice induced by dextran sulfate sodium (DSS). KFP significantly improved the UC symptoms including weight loss, shortened colon length, splenomegaly, diarrhea, hematochezia, and colon inflammation of mice. In addition, KFP could alleviate DSS-caused gut microbiota dysbiosis and increase the levels of short-chain fatty acids in the cecal contents of mice. Furthermore, the results of nontargeted and targeted metabolomics analysis combined with antibiotic treatment revealed that KFP could regulate gut microbiota-dependent tryptophan metabolism, activate the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) in colon cells, and enhance interleukin-22 production and tight junction proteins' (ZO-1, occludin, and claudin3) expression to repair the intestinal barrier in UC mice. Immunofluorescence results showed that KFP significantly upregulated the conjunction of lectin WGA and UEA1 in the UC mouse colon, implying that KFP promoted fucosylation in the colon. These results suggest that KFP alleviates UC primarily via targeting the gut microbiota involved in the AhR pathway and upregulating colon fucosylation.",

Knowledge on the placenta-related pathophysiology of HDP is increasing. Since maternal tryptophan metabolites are involved in placentation, we investigated associations between first-trimester tryptophan metabolites and utero-placental (vascular) development, and the occurrence of HDP. METHODS: 911 women were included from a prospective tertiary hospital cohort. Serum tryptophan metabolites were determined at 8.1 ± 1.4 weeks gestation. Placental volume (PV) and utero-placental vascular volume (uPVV) were determined at 7, 9 and 11 weeks gestation. HDP, including hypertension in early pregnancy, gestational hypertension, and preeclampsia, were retrieved from medical records. Associations with PV- and uPVV-trajectories were assessed using mixed models, and HDP risks were estimated by logistic regression models, adjusted for confounders. A mediation analysis was performed to evaluate whether blood pressure was a mediator in the associations with utero-placental (vascular) development. RESULTS: A negative association between kynurenine and PV-trajectories was found (β = -0.129, 95%CI = -0.220 to -0.039), which was not mediated by blood pressure. No significant associations between other tryptophan metabolites and PV- and uPVV-trajectories were observed. Higher 5-hydroxytryptophan was associated with hypertension in early pregnancy (OR = 1.405, 95%CI = 1.210-1.681), and with an increased risk of preeclampsia in these women. No associations between tryptophan metabolites and other HDP were found. CONCLUSIONS: Higher first-trimester kynurenine concentrations were associated with impaired utero-placental (vascular) development. Higher first-trimester 5-hydroxytryptophan concentrations were associated with early pregnancy hypertension, and an increased risk of preeclampsia, indicating its clinical potential as biomarker for future prediction, prevention and treatment of HDP.",

      "abstract": "Infecting humans with controlled doses of helminths, such as human hookworm (termed hookworm therapy), is proposed to prevent or treat various intestinal and extraintestinal diseases. However, full-scale clinical trials examining hookworm therapy are limited by the inability to scale-up the production of hookworm larvae to infect sufficient numbers of patients. With the aim of overcoming this challenge, this study infected four healthy individuals with hookworm larvae that had been reanimated from cryopreserved eggs to examine their viability and immunogenicity. We demonstrate that reanimated cryopreserved hookworm larvae establish a viable hookworm infection and elicit a similar immune response to larvae cultured from fresh stool. Furthermore, a refined understanding of the therapeutic mechanisms of hookworm is imperative to determine which diseases to target with hookworm therapy. To investigate potential therapeutic mechanisms, this study assessed changes in the immune cells, microbiome, and plasma metabolome in the four healthy individuals infected with cryopreserved hookworm larvae and another nine individuals infected with larvae cultured from freshly obtained stool. We identified potential immunoregulatory mechanisms by which hookworm may provide a beneficial effect on its host, including increased expression of CTLA-4 on regulatory T cells (Tregs) and upregulation of tryptophan metabolism. Furthermore, we found that a participant's baseline microbiome predicted the severity of symptoms and intestinal inflammation experienced during a controlled hookworm infection. In summary, our findings demonstrate the feasibility of full-scale clinical trials examining hookworm therapy by minimizing the reliance on human donors and optimizing the culturing process, thereby enabling viable hookworm larvae to be mass-produced and enabling on-demand inoculation of patients. Furthermore, this study provides insights into the complex interactions between helminths and their host, which could inform the development of novel therapeutic strategies.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Tryptophan is widely present in foods such as peanuts, milk, and bananas, playing a crucial role in maintaining metabolic homeostasis in health and disease. Tryptophan metabolism is involved in the development and progression of immune, nervous, and digestive system diseases. Although some excellent reviews on tryptophan metabolism exist, there has been no systematic scientometric study as of yet. METHODS: This review provides and summarizes research hotspots and potential future directions by analyzing annual publications, topics, keywords, and highly cited papers sourced from Web of Science spanning 1964 to 2022. RESULTS: This review provides a scientometric overview of tryptophan metabolism disorder-triggered diseases, mechanisms, and therapeutic strategies. CONCLUSIONS: The gut microbiota regulates gut permeability, inflammation, and host immunity by directly converting tryptophan to indole and its derivatives. Gut microbial metabolites regulate tryptophan metabolism by activating specific receptors or enzymes. Additionally, the kynurenine (KYN) pathway, activated by indoleamine-2, 3-dioxygenase (IDO) and tryptophan 2, 3-dioxygenase, affects the migration and invasion of glioma cells and the development of COVID-19 and depression. The research and development of IDO inhibitors help to improve the effectiveness of immunotherapy. Tryptophan metabolites as potential markers are used for disease therapy, guiding clinical decision-making. Tryptophan metabolites serve as targets to provide a new promising strategy for neuroprotective/neurotoxic imbalance affecting brain structure and function. In summary, this review provides valuable guidance for the basic research and clinical application of tryptophan metabolism.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Metabolic regulation of various amino acids have been proven to be effective in preventing cardiovascular disease (CVD). The impact of tryptophan, an essential amino acid, on the risk of developing CVD has not been fully elucidated. AIMS: The aim of this meta-analysis was to systematically review evidence of the effects of tryptophan on CVD risk. METHODS: The PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) databases were searched to collect relevant trials from inception to August 2024. The means and hazard ratios (HRs) were extracted and pooled. Subgroup analysis was performed to identify pooled effect estimates, and sensitivity analysis was conducted to assess the robustness of the pooled estimates. RESULTS: Data were collected from 34,370 people under follow-up for CVD events in 13 studies, including cohort studies and case-control studies. They were categorized into three groups on the basis of sample type and indicators: the plasma tryptophan level group, the plasma tryptophan CVD hazard group, and the urinary tryptophan CVD hazard group. The CVD included in this study were coronary artery disease, heart failure, and peripheral artery disease. Twelve studies on plasma tryptophan were meta-analyzed. The plasma tryptophan levels in CVD patients were generally lower than those in individuals without CVD (SMD = -8.57, 95%CI (-15.77, -1.37), P = 0.02). Decreased circulating tryptophan levels are associated with cardiovascular disease risk (HR = 0.85, 95%CI (0.78, 0.92), P < 0.00001). CONCLUSIONS: Decreased circulating tryptophan levels are associated with an increased risk of CVD events. Intervention in circulating tryptophan levels may be indicated to help prevent CVD."

      "abstract": "Perinatal depression is a prevalent mental disorder among pregnant women, characterized by sleep disturbances, appetite changes, negative emotions, cognitive impairment, and suicidal or homicidal tendencies. These symptoms severely compromise personal well-being, disrupt family life, and burden society. Early detection and intervention are thus crucial. The tryptophan-kynurenine (TRP-KYN) pathway is central to the inflammatory hypothesis of depression and has gained significant attention in perinatal depression research. This pathway encompasses numerous metabolic enzymes and neuroactive metabolites that interact with other physiological systems, influencing neurotransmitter synthesis and neuronal development. Through these interactions, the TRP-KYN pathway exerts psychotropic effects. This article reviews the key metabolites and enzymes of the TRP-KYN pathway and examines its intersection with immune inflammation, hormones, and gut microbiota.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The gut microbiota is believed to influence atherosclerosis (AS), and Aucubin (Au), a natural compound found in the traditional Chinese medicine Eucommia ulmoides Oliver, is being explored as a potential treatment for cardiovascular disease. Yet, the specific impact of Au on AS through the gut microbiota remains unclear. PURPOSE: This study aimed to highlight the potential of Au in improving AS by influencing gut microbiota and investigating its potential mechanisms by which it and its metabolites of gut microbiota regulate lipid metabolism, inflammation and endothelial dysfunction. METHODS: The impact of Au on AS in ApoE-/- mice was examined, followed by a fecal microbiota transplantation experiment to confirm the influence of Au on AS through gut microbiota. Subsequent analysis of fecal and serum samples using 16S rRNA gene sequencing and metabolomics revealed distinct features of gut microbiota and metabolites. Identified metabolites were then utilized in vivo experiments to investigate underlying mechanisms. RESULTS: Au treatment effectively reduced dietary-induced dyslipidemia and endothelial dysfunction in a dose-dependent manner in atherosclerotic mice. It also improved vascular plaque accumulation and inflammation, increased aortic valve fibrous cap thickness, and decreased necrotic core and collagen fiber area. Subsequently, we observed a substantial increase in indole-3-acrylic acid (IAA), a microbe-derived metabolite, in cecal contents and serum, along with a significant rise in Lactobacillus abundance responsible for IAA production. Our findings demonstrated that IAA played a crucial role in alleviating AS. Furthermore, we discovered that IAA activated the Aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) and suppressed the TGF-β/Smad pathway, potentially ameliorating endothelial-mesenchymal transitions in atherosclerotic mice. CONCLUSION: These findings suggested that Au's anti-atherosclerotic effects were primarily due to elevated Lactobacillus-derived IAA, thereby potentially contributing to alleviating AS.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Ulcerative colitis (UC) is an inflammatory bowel disease characterized by its incurable nature and undefined etiology, which is often accompanied by a high prevalence of comorbid depression. The gut-brain axis has emerged as a promising treatment target in recent years. PURPOSE: This study aimed to investigate how vinegar-processed Schisandra Chinensis (VSC) enhances therapeutic effects on depressive behavior in chronic UC mice. METHODS: A chronic UC model was induced in mice using dextran sulfate sodium. The therapeutic effects of both raw and vinegar-processed Schisandra Chinensis on UC and associated depressive symptoms were assessed. Colonic mucosal damage was evaluated using hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and Alcian blue staining. The integrity of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and synaptic structures was visualized via transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was employed to quantify inflammatory cytokine levels in the colon, serum, and brain, while western blotting was performed for protein expression analysis. Additionally, metagenomic analysis was conducted to investigate gut microbiota composition. Nissl staining and immunofluorescence were used to assess hippocampal neuronal damage, and behavioral assessments including the morris water maze, open field test, forced swimming test and tail suspension test, were implemented to evaluate depressive states. Serum metabolites were analyzed using UPLC-MS/MS. RESULTS: Both raw and vinegar-processed Schisandra Chinensis significantly upregulated aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), inhibited NF-κB p-p65 activation, and reduced levels of pro-inflammatory cytokine. These treatments also enhanced the expression of tight junction proteins, restored colonic mucosal and BBB integrity, alleviated damage to hippocampal neurons, and improved synaptic structure. Behavioral assessments indicated that VSC was particularly effective in ameliorating depressive-like behaviors in chronic UC mice. In the gut, both treatments reshaped the gut microbial composition, restoring the relative abundance of Duncaniella, Candidatus_Amulumruptor, Alistipes, Parabacteroides, Lachnospiraceae_bacterium, uncultured_Bacteroides_sp., Candidatus_Amulumruptor_caecigallinarius, with VSC showing more pronounced effects. Serum metabolomics revealed an increase in tryptophan levels and a decrease in kynurenine and xanthurenic acid levels with VSC, indicating that tryptophan metabolism shifted from the kynurenine pathway to the 5-HT or indole pathway. However, this phenomenon did not occur with Schisandra Chinensis (SC). CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that the disruption of tryptophan metabolic balance served as a biological mechanism underlying the occurrence of depressive behaviors induced by UC. The application of SC following vinegar processing enhanced its regulatory effects on gut microbiota and tryptophan metabolism. This findings provided a new insight for the clinical management of gut-brain comorbidities.",

      "abstract": "Gonadal steroids exert different effects on the central nervous system (CNS), such as preserving neuronal function and promoting neuronal survival. Estradiol, progesterone, and testosterone reduce neuronal loss in the CNS in animal models of neurodegeneration. However, hormone replacement therapy has been associated with higher rates of endometrial, prostate, and breast cancer. Tibolone (TIB), the metabolites of which show estrogenic and progestogenic effects, is an alternative to reduce this risk. However, the impact of TIB on memory and learning, as well as on choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) and tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH) levels in the hippocampus of aging males, is unknown. We administered TIB to aged C57BL/6J male mice at different doses (0.01 or 1.0 mg/kg per day for 12 weeks) and evaluated its effects on memory and learning and the content of ChAT and TPH. We assessed memory and learning with object recognition and elevated T-maze tasks. Additionally, we determined ChAT and TPH protein levels in the hippocampus by Western blotting. TIB administration increased the percentage of time spent on the novel object in the object recognition task. In addition, the latency of leaving the enclosed arm increased in both TIB groups, suggesting an improvement in fear-based learning. We also observed decreased ChAT content in the group treated with the 0.01 mg/kg TIB dose. In the case of TPH, no changes were observed with either TIB dose. These results show that long-term TIB administration improves memory without affecting locomotor activity and modulates cholinergic but not serotonergic systems in the hippocampus of aged male mice."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Tryptophan Metabolism-associated Genes (TMGs), such as ECHS1 and ALDH2, are crucial in cancer progression through immunosuppressive mechanisms, particularly in Gastric Cancer (GC). This study explores their effects on the Tumor Microenvironment (TME). Additionally, it examines their potential as novel immunotherapy targets. METHODS: We utilized single-cell and bulk transcriptomic technologies to analyze the heterogeneity of GC. Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) clustering identified key TMGs, and extensive RNA-seq analyses were performed to pinpoint prognostic genes and potential immunotherapy targets. Furthermore, through PCR analyses we found that ECHS1 and ALDH2 gene expression plays a regulatory role in the migration, invasion and inflammatory factor in AGS and SNU-1 cell lines. The interference effect of si-ECHS1 and ad-ALDH2 was validated using cell scratch assay in AGS and SNU-1 cell line. RESULTS: We observed a statistically significant correlation between ECHS1 and ALDH2 expression and increased TME heterogeneity. Our findings also revealed that ECHS1 down-regulation and ALDH2 up-regulation contribute to reduced TME heterogeneity, decreased inflammation, and inhibited AGS and SNU-1 tumor cells migration and proliferation. GSVA enrichment analysis highlighted the NF-kappa B(NF-κB) signaling pathway as specifically regulated by TMGs. Furthermore,ECHS1 and ALDH2 modulated CD8+ and CD4+ T cell activities, impacting GC progression. In vitro experiments further solidified our conclusions by showcasing the inhibitory effects of Si-ECHS1 and ad-ALDH2 on the invasive and proliferative capabilities of AGS and SNU-1 cells. Moreover, Si-ECHS1 and ad-ALDH2 gene expression effectively reduced the expression of inflammatory factors IL-10,IL-7,CXCL8 and IL-6, leading to a remarkable alleviation of chronic inflammation and the heterogeneous nature of the TME. CONCLUSION: This research highlights the importance of ECHS1 and ALDH2 in GC progression and immune modulation, suggesting that targeted therapies focusing on these genes offer promising avenues for personalized immunotherapy in GC. These findings hold potential for improving patient survival and quality of life. Future studies on the NF-κB signaling pathway's role in this context are warranted to further elucidate the mechanisms underlying TMG-mediated immune modulation in GC.",

      "abstract": "Lower limb ischemia is characterized by reduced arterial perfusion in the lower limbs, leading to tissue ischemia and cell death. It is primarily caused by thrombosis and the rupture of arterial plaques, resulting in damage to ischemic muscle tissues. Metabolic processes are crucial in its development. Herein we combined single-cell data with metabolomics data to explore the pathways and mechanisms influencing lower limb ischemia. We analyzed single-cell and metabolomics data. In single-cell analysis, we identified different cell subpopulations and key regulatory genes, and biological enrichment analysis was performed to understand their functions and relationships. For metabolomics, mass spectrometry and chromatography techniques were employed to analyze metabolites in clinical samples. We performed differential analysis, correlation analysis, and Mendelian randomization to determine the relationships between key metabolites and genes. Nebl, Dapl1, Igfbp4, Lef1, Klrd1, Ciita, Il17f, Cd8b1, Il17a, Cd180, Il17re, Trim7, and Slc6a19 were identified to play a crucial role in lower limb ischemia. Important metabolites included L-threonine and L-tryptophan. The metabolism of L-threonine and L-tryptophan is linked to lower limb ischemia and thrombosis. B0AT1, encoded by SLC6A19, is closely related to these metabolites and appears to play a key role in lower limb ischemia development. Our analysis revealed the roles of key genes and metabolites in lower limb ischemia. These findings enhance our understanding of the pathogenesis of lower limb ischemia and provide new insights into its prevention and treatment.",

This systematic review was meticulously orchestrated to evaluate the effect of TRP restriction on IBS. METHODS: A comprehensive search of the MEDLINE/PubMed, Cochrane Library, and Embase databases was conducted. Controlled trials that compared the efficacy of TRP restriction in IBS patients were scrutinized. The primary outcomes were gastrointestinal symptoms, quality of life, and pain, whereas the secondary outcomes included anxiety, mood, and safety. The risk of bias was meticulously assessed according to the guidelines recommended by the Cochrane Collaboration. RESULTS: A total of five trials, enrolling 135 participants, were incorporated into the qualitative synthesis. Low-TRP intake attenuated gastrointestinal discomfort and enhanced psychological well-being in IBS patients, while the effects of acute TRP depletion were controversial. Safety data from one randomized controlled trial reported no occurrence of adverse events. CONCLUSION: This systematic review suggests that moderating, rather than depleting, TRP intake may potentially be a feasible and safe adjunctive treatment for patients with IBS. Future research incorporating a high-quality study design and consensus on clinical outcome measurements for IBS is warranted."
