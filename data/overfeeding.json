      "abstract": "BACKGROUND & AIMS: Epidemiological data suggest that participants with lower vs. higher body mass index (BMI) resist exposure to the obesogenic environment. To test this, we analyzed the relationship between overfeeding-induced weight and fat mass gains with baseline BMI and body fat percentage. METHODS: In this controlled intervention study, 34 men (age: 26±5 y old; BMI: 25.5±2.4 kg/m2, body fat [DXA]: 19.3±5.1%) consumed for 8 weeks 40% more energy than needed at weight maintenance. The energy costs of weight and fat mass gain were calculated as the 8-week excess energy consumed divided by weight or fat mass gain. Energy expenditure (baseline and after overfeeding) was determined using a metabolic chamber and doubly labeled water. Transcriptomic analysis was conducted from abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue samples. RESULTS: Body weight increased 7.2±2.1 kg and fat mass 4.0±1.4 kg. There was no statistical association between baseline BMI and weight and fat mass gains. However, baseline body fat percentage was significantly associated with weight (r=0.57) and fat mass (r=0.59) gains. Body fat percentage was also statistically associated with energy cost of weight (r=-0.38) and fat mass (r=-0.40) gains. Metabolic adaptation in energy expenditure (adaptive thermogenesis) was unrelated to the energy cost of weight and fat mass gains. Transcriptomics analysis showed that high energy cost of weight gain was associated with up-regulation of inflammation-related pathways. CONCLUSION: Body fat percentage at baseline was inversely associated with overfeeding-induced weight and fat gain resistance. The underlying compensatory response appears unrelated to changes in energy expenditure."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most common endocrine disorder in women of reproductive age and is closely associated with chronic low-grade inflammation and insulin resistance. To clarify the contribution of prepubertal weight gain to the development of insulin resistance in PCOS, we investigated the effects of early postnatal overfeeding on inflammatory and energy-sensing pathways as well as on markers of insulin signaling in the liver of the PCOS rat model. METHODS: Obesity induced by overfeeding was achieved by reducing litter size, while the PCOS-like condition was developed by treatment with 5α-dihydrotestosterone (DHT). Western blot and qPCR were used to analyze the expression of pro-inflammatory transcription factors and cytokines, as well as markers of the energy sensing and insulin signaling pathways. RESULTS: The results showed that hepatic insulin sensitivity was impaired only in DHT-treated rats raised in small litters, as evidenced by increased phosphorylation of IRS1 on Ser307 and decreased expression of total IRS1. Postnatal overfeeding stimulated JNK1 activation independent of hyperandrogenemia; nevertheless, the synergistic effect of both factors triggered NLRP3 activation and increased IL1β expression in the small litter DHT-treated group. This pro-inflammatory state was accompanied by decreased activatory phosphorylation of AMPK and reduced levels of its protein targets. CONCLUSIONS: Overfeeding in the early postnatal period leads to a decrease in hepatic insulin sensitivity in the rat model of PCOS, which is associated with decreased activation of AMPK and stimulation of the hepatic NLRP3-IL1β signaling pathway. Accordingly, the inhibition of NLRP3 activation could provide a basis for the development of new therapeutic strategies for the treatment of insulin resistance in women with PCOS.",

METHODS: A longitudinal study was undertaken to determine the long-term implications when 80 Holstein‒Friesian heifers with a mean (±standard error) age of 4.1 ± 0.1 months and a mean liveweight of 137 ± 2.4 kg were fed a recommended (R; 16 mg/kg dry matter [DM]) or high (H; 32 mg/kg DM) dietary Cu concentration until 6 weeks prior to calving. RESULTS: Hepatic Cu concentrations in both treatment groups were elevated into the ranges used to diagnose chronic Cu toxicity in cattle at 6.9 months of age (798 ± 46.4 mg/kg DM for H vs. 643 ± 35.4 mg/kg DM for R), with associated evidence of liver damage. Hepatic Cu concentrations then returned to normality but remained higher (p < 0.001) for heifers fed H than for those fed R and were associated with a reduced (p = 0.044) conception rate to first and second services (73.7 ± 8.05% for H vs. 91.2 ± 7.68% for R). LIMITATION: This retrospective analysis identified pre-study liver damage, which may have affected results. CONCLUSIONS: Supplying Cu in excess of requirements resulted in liver damage and reduced conception rates.",

Receptor-interacting protein kinase 3 (RIPK3) is associated with several metabolic diseases. We investigated the effects of RIPK3 on neonatal overfeeding-related metabolic disorders. On postnatal day 3, litter sizes were adjusted to 9-10 (normal litters, NL) or 2-3 (small litters, SL) mice per dam to mimic postnatal overfeeding. After weaning, NL and SL mouse were fed normal diet. We generated an adeno-associated virus (AAV) carrying short hairpin RNA (shRNA) against Ripk3 and an empty vector as a control. The NL and SL groups were treated intravenously with 1×1012 vector genome of AAV vectors at week 6. The SL group showed a higher body weight than the NL group from week 3 of age through adulthood. At weeks 6 and 13, the SL group exhibited impaired glucose and insulin tolerance, RIPK3 up-regulation, and lipid accumulation in liver and adipose tissues. In the SL group, the genes involved in lipid synthesis and lipolysis were increased, whereas fatty acid β-oxidation-related genes were weakened in adipose tissue and liver. At week 13, AAV-shRNA-Ripk3 ameliorated adipose tissue hypertrophy, hepatic steatosis, insulin resistance, and dysregulated lipid metabolism in the adipose tissue and liver of SL mice. These findings support a novel mechanism underlying the pathogenesis of postnatal overfeeding-related metabolic disorders and suggest potential therapeutic targets.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION AND AIMS: Obesity is a multifactorial condition with high health risk, associated with important chronic disorders such as diabetes, dyslipidemia, and cardiovascular dysfunction. Citrus aurantium L. (C. aurantium) is a medicinal plant, and its active component, synephrine, a β-3 adrenergic agonist, can be used for weight loss. We investigated the effects of C. aurantium and synephrine in obese adolescent mice programmed by early postnatal overfeeding. METHODS: Three days after birth, male Swiss mice were divided into a small litter (SL) group (3 pups) and a normal litter (NL) group (9 pups). At 30 days old, SL and NL mice were treated with C. aurantium standardized to 6% synephrine, C. aurantium with 30% synephrine, isolated synephrine, or vehicle for 19 days. RESULTS: The SL group had a higher body weight than the NL group. Heart rate and blood pressure were not elevated. The SL group had hyperleptinemia and central obesity that were normalized by C. aurantium and synephrine. In brown adipose tissue, the SL group showed a higher lipid droplet sectional area, less nuclei, a reduction in thermogenesis markers related to thermogenesis (UCP-1, PRDM16, PGC-1α and PPARg), and mitochondrial disfunction. C. aurantium and synephrine treatment normalized these parameters. CONCLUSION: Our data indicates that the treatment with C. aurantium and synephrine could be a promising alternative for the control of some obesity dysfunction, such as improvement of brown adipose tissue dysfunction and leptinemia."

      "abstract": "The incidence of feline obesity continues to rise despite it being a preventable disease. There are many risks and health perturbations associated with obesity, with several of those impacting a pet's quality of life, wellness, and longevity. Feline obesity is commonly studied, but most research has been focused on weight loss rather than weight gain. To our knowledge, feline studies have not examined the implications of overfeeding and weight gain on gastrointestinal transit time (GTT) nor the association it has with the fecal microbiota. Therefore, the objective of this study was to determine the effects of overfeeding and weight gain on apparent total tract digestibility (ATTD), GTT, blood hormones, serum metabolites, hematology, fecal microbiota populations, and voluntary physical activity of cats. Eleven lean adult spayed female cats [body weight (BW) = 4.11 ± 0.43 kg; body condition score = 5.41 ± 0.3; age = 5.22 ± 0.03 y] were used in a longitudinal weight gain study. After a 2-wk baseline phase, cats were allowed to overeat for 18 wk. A commercially available complete and balanced diet was fed during the baseline phase to identify the intake needed to maintain BW. Cats were then fed the same diet ad libitum to induce weight gain. Fecal samples, blood samples, and voluntary physical activity data were collected at baseline (week 0) and 6, 12, and 18 wk after weight gain. Fecal samples were collected for microbiota analysis, determination of ATTD, and GTT measurement while blood samples were collected for serum chemistry, hematology, and insulin and leptin measurements. Microbiota data were evaluated using QIIME2. All other measures were evaluated statistically using the mixed models procedure of SAS using repeated measures analysis, with time effects being the focus. A P < 0.05 was considered significant. The ATTD of dry matter (P = 0.0061), organic matter (P = 0.0130), crude protein (P < 0.0001), fat (P = 0.0002), and gross energy (P = 0.0002), and GTT (P = 0.0418) decreased with overfeeding and weight gain. Fecal bacterial alpha diversity measures were unchanged, but fecal bacterial beta diversity was impacted (P < 0.05) with overfeeding and weight gain. The relative abundances of 16 bacterial genera, including Bifidobacterium, Collinsella, Erysipelatoclostridium were affected (P < 0.05) by overfeeding and weight gain. In conclusion, overfeeding and subsequent weight gain reduced ATTD, reduced GTT, and caused changes to the fecal microbial community of adult cats."

      "abstract": "Obesity is a global epidemic and risk factor for the development of chronic kidney disease. Obesity induces systemic changes in metabolism, but how it affects kidney metabolism specifically is not known. Zebrafish have previously been shown to develop obesity-related kidney pathology and dysfunction when fed hypercaloric diets. To understand the direct effects of obesity on kidney metabolic function, we treated zebrafish for 8 wk with a control and an overfeeding diet. At the end of treatment, we assessed changes in kidney and fish weights and used electron microscopy to evaluate cell ultrastructure. We then performed an untargeted metabolomic analysis on the kidney tissue of fish using ultra-high performance liquid chromatography coupled with high-resolution mass spectrometry and used mummichog and gene set enrichment analysis to uncover differentially affected metabolic pathways. Kidney metabolomes differed significantly and consistently between the control and overfed diets. Among 9,593 features, we identified 235 that were significantly different (P < 0.05) between groups (125 upregulated in overfed diet, 110 downregulated). Pathway analysis demonstrated perturbations in glycolysis and fatty acid synthesis pathways, and analysis of specific metabolites points to perturbations in tryptophan metabolism. Our key findings show that diet-induced obesity leads to metabolic changes in the kidney tissue itself and implicates specific metabolic pathways, including glycolysis and tryptophan metabolism in the pathogenesis of obesity-related kidney disease, demonstrating the power of untargeted metabolomics to identify pathways of interest by directly interrogating kidney tissue.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Obesity causes systemic metabolic dysfunction, but how this affects kidney metabolism is less understood. This study used ultra-high performance liquid chromatography coupled with high-resolution mass spectrometry to analyze the kidneys of overfed zebrafish. Metabolites in the kidneys of obese zebrafish revealed perturbations in metabolic pathways including glycolysis and tryptophan metabolism. These data suggest obesity alters metabolism within the kidney, which may play an important role in obesity-related kidney dysfunction.",

      "abstract": "Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common endocrinopathy in women of reproductive age, often associated with obesity and insulin resistance. Childhood obesity is an important predisposing factor for the development of PCOS later in life. Being particularly interested in the interplay between prepubertal obesity and hyperandrogenemia, we investigated the effects of early postnatal overfeeding, accomplished by reducing litter size during the period of suckling, on energy sensing and insulin signaling pathways in the gastrocnemius muscle of a rat model of PCOS-induced by 5α-dihydrotestosterone (DHT). The combination of overfeeding and DHT treatment caused hyperinsulinemia and decreased systemic insulin sensitivity. Early postnatal overfeeding induced defects at critical nodes of the insulin signaling pathway in skeletal muscle, which was associated with reduced glucose uptake in the presence of hyperandrogenemia. In this setting, under a combination of overfeeding and DHT treatment, skeletal muscle switched to mitochondrial β-oxidation of fatty acids, resulting in oxidative stress and inflammation that stimulated AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activity and its downstream targets involved in mitochondrial biogenesis and antioxidant protection. Overall, a combination of overfeeding and hyperandrogenemia resulted in a prooxidative and insulin-resistant state in skeletal muscle. This was accompanied by the activation of AMPK, which could represent a potential therapeutic target in insulin-resistant PCOS patients."

Offspring of these ewes are referred to as CON (n = 10 ewes; 12 rams), RES (n = 13 ewes; 21 rams), or OVER (n = 16 ewes; 13 rams), respectively. Lamb body weights (BW) and blood samples were collected weekly from birth (day 0) to day 28 and then every 14 d until day 252. Intravenous glucose tolerance test (infusion of 0.25 g dextrose/kg BW) was performed at day 133 ± 0.25. At day 167 ± 1.42, individual daily intake was recorded over a 77 d feeding period to determine residual feed intake (RFI). Rams were euthanized at day 282 ± 1.82 and body morphometrics, loin eye area (LEA), back fat thickness, and organ weights were collected. The right leg was collected from rams at necropsy and dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry was used to determine bone mineral density (BMD) and length. Averaged from day 0 until day 252, RES and OVER offspring weighed 10.8% and 6.8% less than CON offspring, respectively (P ≤ 0.02). When adjusted for BW, liver and testes weights tended to be increased and decreased, respectively, in RES rams compared with CON rams (P ≤ 0.08). Additionally, RES BMD and bone length were less than CON rams (P ≤ 0.06). Treatment did not influence muscle mass, LEA, or adipose deposition (P ≥ 0.41). Rams (-0.17) were more feed efficient than ewes (0.23; P < 0.01); however, no effect of maternal diet was observed (P ≥ 0.57). At 2 min post glucose infusion, glucose concentrations in OVER offspring were greater than CON and RES offspring (P = 0.04). Concentrations of insulin in CON rams tended to be greater than OVER and RES ewes at 5 min (P ≤ 0.07). No differences were detected in insulin:glucose or area under the curve (AUC) for glucose or insulin (P ≤ 0.29). Maternal diet did not impact offspring triglycerides or cholesterol (P ≤ 0.35). Pre-weaning leptin tended to be 70% greater in OVER offspring than CON (P ≤ 0.07). These data indicate that poor maternal nutrition impairs offspring growth throughout maturity but does not affect RFI. Changes in metabolic factors and glucose tolerance are minimal, highlighting the need to investigate other mechanisms that may contribute to negative impacts of poor maternal diet."

      "abstract": "The obesity epidemic is concerning as obesity appears to negatively impact cognition and behavior. Furthermore, some studies suggest that this negative effect could be carried across generations from both mothers and fathers although evidence is not consistent. Here, we attempt to address how obesogenic diets in the parental generation (F0) can impact offspring's cognition and anxiety intergenerationally (F1) in a zebrafish model. We compare both mean trait values and their variances. Using a multifactorial design, we created a total of four groups: F1T (treatment mothers × treatment fathers); F1M (treatment mothers × control fathers); F1P (treatment fathers × control mothers); and F1C (control mothers × control fathers, F1C); and subjected them to anxiety tank tests and aversive learning assays. When both parents were exposed, offspring (F1T) displayed the poorest aversive learning, while offspring that only had one parent exposed (F1P and F1M) learnt the aversive learning task the best. Zebrafish in all groups displayed no statistically significant differences in anxiety-associated behaviors. Males and females also performed similarly in both anxiety and aversive learning assays. While all F1 groups had similar levels of fasting blood glucose, variance in glucose levels were reduced in F1P and F1T indicating the importance of investigating heteroskedasticity between groups. Furthermore, anxiety behaviors of these two groups appeared to be less repeatable. To our knowledge, this is the first study to test the intergenerational effects of an obesogenic diet on zebrafish cognition. Our multifactorial design as well as repeated tests also allowed us to disentangle maternal and paternal effects (as well as combined effects) and accurately detect subtle information such as between-individual variation."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Body weight is defended by strong homeostatic forces. Several of the key biological mechanisms that counteract weight loss have been unraveled over the last decades. In contrast, the mechanisms that protect body weight and fat mass from becoming too high remain largely unknown. Understanding this aspect of energy balance regulation holds great promise for curbing the obesity epidemic. Decoding the physiological and molecular pathways that defend against weight gain can be achieved by an intervention referred to as 'experimental overfeeding'. SCOPE OF THE REVIEW: In this review, we define experimental overfeeding and summarize the studies that have been conducted on animals. This field of research shows that experimental overfeeding induces a potent and prolonged hypophagic response that seems to be conserved across species and mediated by unidentified endocrine factors. In addition, the literature shows that experimental overfeeding can be used to model the development of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis and that forced intragastric infusion of surplus calories lowers survival from infections. Finally, we highlight studies indicating that experimental overfeeding can be employed to study the transgenerational effects of a positive energy balance and how dietary composition and macronutrient content might impact energy homeostasis and obesity development in animals. MAJOR CONCLUSIONS: Experimental overfeeding of animals is a powerful yet underappreciated method to investigate the defense mechanisms against weight gain. This intervention also represents an alternative approach for studying the pathophysiology of metabolic liver diseases and the links between energy balance and infection biology. Future research in this field could help uncover why humans respond differently to an obesogenic environment and reveal novel pathways with therapeutic potential against obesity and cardiometabolic disorders.",

      "abstract": "Two randomized placebo-controlled double-blind paralleled trials (42 men in Lyon, 19 women in Lausanne) were designed to test 2 g/day of a grape polyphenol extract during 31 days of high calorie-high fructose overfeeding. Hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamps and test meals with [1,1,1-13C3]-triolein were performed before and at the end of the intervention. Changes in body composition were assessed by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA). Fat volumes of the abdominal region and liver fat content were determined in men only, using 3D-magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) at 3T. Adipocyte's size was measured in subcutaneous fat biopsies. Bodyweight and fat mass increased during overfeeding, in men and in women. While whole body insulin sensitivity did not change, homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and the hepatic insulin resistance index (HIR) increased during overfeeding. Liver fat increased in men. However, grape polyphenol supplementation did not modify the metabolic and anthropometric parameters or counteract the changes during overfeeding, neither in men nor in women. Polyphenol intake was associated with a reduction in adipocyte size in women femoral fat. Grape polyphenol supplementation did not counteract the moderated metabolic alterations induced by one month of high calorie-high fructose overfeeding in men and women. The clinical trials are registered under the numbers NCT02145780 and NCT02225457 at ClinicalTrials.gov and available at https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02145780 and https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02225457."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Maternal overfeeding during gestation may lead to adverse metabolic programming in the offspring mediated by epigenetic alterations. Potential reversal, in early life, of these alterations may help in the prevention of future cardio-metabolic conditions. In this context, our aims were: (1) to study the effects of maternal overfeeding on the metabolic and epigenetic programming of offspring's adipose tissue; and (2) to test the potential of postnatal metformin treatment to reverse these changes. METHODS: We used a swine animal model where commercial production sows were either overfed or kept under standard diet during gestation, and piglets at birth were randomly assigned to metformin (n = 16 per group) or vehicle treatment during lactation (n = 16 per group). RESULTS: Piglets born to overfed sows showed a worse metabolic profile (higher weight, weight gain from birth and abdominal circumference; all p < 0.05) together with altered serological markers (increased HOMA-IR, fructosamine, total cholesterol, C-Reactive Protein and lower HMW adiponectin; all p < 0.05). The visceral adipose tissue also showed altered morphology (increased adipocyte area, perimeter and diameter; all p < 0.05), as well as changes in gene expression (higher CCL2 and INSR, lower DLK1; all p < 0.05), and in DNA methylation (96 hypermethylated and 99 hypomethylated CpG sites; FDR < 0.05). Metformin treatment significantly ameliorated the abnormal metabolic profile, decreasing piglets' weight, weight gain from birth, abdominal circumference and fructosamine (all p < 0.05) and reduced adipocyte area, perimeter, and diameter in visceral adipose tissue (all p < 0.05). In addition, metformin treatment potentiated several associations between gene expression in visceral adipose tissue and the altered metabolic markers. CONCLUSIONS: Maternal overfeeding during gestation leads to metabolic abnormalities in the offspring, including adipose tissue alterations. Early metformin treatment mitigates these effects and could help rescue the offspring's metabolic health.",

      "abstract": "As the prevalence of obesity has steadily increased on a global scale, research has shifted to explore potential contributors to this pandemic beyond overeating and lack of exercise. Environmental chemical contaminants, known as obesogens, alter metabolic processes and exacerbate the obese phenotype. Diethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP) is a common chemical plasticizer found in medical supplies, food packaging, and polyvinyl materials, and has been identified as a probable obesogen. This study investigated the hypothesis that co-exposure to DEHP and overfeeding would result in decreased lipid mobilization and physical fitness in Danio rerio (zebrafish). Four treatment groups were randomly assigned: Regular Fed (control, 10 mg/fish/day with 0 mg/kg DEHP), Overfed (20 mg/fish/day with 0 mg/kg DEHP), Regular Fed + DEHP (10 mg/fish/day with 3 mg/kg DEHP), Overfed + DEHP (20 mg/fish/day with 3 mg/kg DEHP). After 24 weeks, swim tunnel assays were conducted on half of the zebrafish from each treatment to measure critical swimming speeds (Ucrit); the other fish were euthanized without swimming. Body mass index (BMI) was measured, and tissues were collected for blood lipid characterization and gene expression analyses. Co-exposure to DEHP and overfeeding decreased swim performance as measured by Ucrit. While no differences in blood lipids were observed with DEHP exposure, differential expression of genes related to lipid metabolism and utilization in the gastrointestinal and liver tissue suggests alterations in metabolism and lipid packaging, which may impact utilization and ability to mobilize lipid reserves during physical activity following chronic exposures.",

Several findings have shown that this complex and dynamic microbial ecosystem can contribute to the maintenance of host health or, when subject to imbalances, to the pathogenesis of various enteric and non-enteric diseases. This scoping review summarizes the current knowledge on how the gut microbiota and microbially-derived compounds affect host metabolism, especially in the context of obesity and related disorders. Examples of microbiome-based targeted intervention strategies that aim to restore and maintain an eubiotic layout are then discussed. Adjuvant therapeutic interventions to alleviate obesity and associated comorbidities are traditionally based on diet modulation and the supplementation of prebiotics, probiotics and synbiotics. However, these approaches have shown only moderate ability to induce sustained changes in the gut microbial ecosystem, making the development of innovative and tailored microbiome-based intervention strategies of utmost importance in clinical practice. In this regard, the administration of next-generation probiotics and engineered microbiomes has shown promising results, together with more radical intervention strategies based on the replacement of the dysbiotic ecosystem by means of fecal microbiota transplantation from healthy donors or with the introduction of synthetic communities specifically designed to achieve the desired therapeutic outcome. Finally, we provide a perspective for future translational investigations through the implementation of bioinformatics approaches, including machine and deep learning, to predict health risks and therapeutic outcomes.",

To our knowledge, there has never been an overfeeding study comparing the effects of multiple diets. RECENT FINDINGS: This study reports a case study of an individual who ate 5800 Calories per day of 3 different diets for 21 days at a time. The 3 different diets were low-carb, low-fat, and very-low-fat vegan. The weight gain over 21 days was 1.3 kg for low-carb, 7.1 kg for low-fat, and 4.7 kg for very-low-fat vegan. SUMMARY: In this n-of-1 study, consuming 5800 Calories/day of 3 different diets for 21 days did not lead to the same amount of weight gain. Further research should be conducted on how the human body gains weight with an emphasis on how different foods affect physiology. If these findings are replicated, there would be many ramifications for obesity treatment and healthcare guidelines.",

As a result, propofol can significantly contribute to caloric intake and can potentially result in complications of overfeeding for patients who receive concurrent enteral or parenteral nutrition therapy. In order to avoid potential overfeeding, some clinicians have empirically decreased the infusion rate of the nutrition therapy, which also may have detrimental effects since protein intake may be inadequate. The purpose of this review is to examine the current literature regarding these issues and provide some practical suggestions on how to restrict caloric intake to avoid overfeeding and simultaneously enhance protein intake for patients who receive either parenteral or enteral nutrition for those patients receiving concurrent propofol therapy."

This preliminary study examined potential predictors of resistance training (RT) adaptations during a period of purposeful overfeeding and RT. Resistance-trained males (n = 28; n = 21 completers) were assigned to 6 weeks of supervised RT and daily consumption of a high-calorie protein/carbohydrate supplement with a target body mass (BM) gain of ≥0.45 kg·wk-1. At baseline and post-intervention, body composition was evaluated via 4-component (4C) model and ultrasonography. Additional assessments of resting metabolism and muscular performance were performed. Accelerometry and automated dietary interviews estimated physical activity levels and nutrient intake before and during the intervention. Bayesian regression methods were employed to examine potential predictors of changes in body composition, muscular performance, and metabolism. A simplified regression model with only rate of BM gain as a predictor was also developed. Increases in 4C whole-body fat-free mass (FFM; (mean ± SD) 4.8 ± 2.6%), muscle thickness (4.5 ± 5.9% for elbow flexors; 7.4 ± 8.4% for knee extensors), and muscular performance were observed in nearly all individuals. However, changes in outcome variables could generally not be predicted with precision. Bayes R2 values for the models ranged from 0.18 to 0.40, and other metrics also indicated relatively poor predictive performance. On average, a BM gain of ~0.55%/week corresponded with a body composition score ((∆FFM/∆BM)*100) of 100, indicative of all BM gained as FFM. However, meaningful variability around this estimate was observed. This study offers insight regarding the complex interactions between the RT stimulus, overfeeding, and putative predictors of RT adaptations."

      "abstract": "NEW FINDINGS: What is the central question of this study? Studies reported the efficacy of metformin as a promising drug for preventing or treating of metabolic diseases. Nutrient stresses during neonatal life increase long-term risk for cardiometabolic diseases. Can early metformin treatment prevent the malprogramming effects of early overfeeding? What is the main finding and its importance? Neonatal metformin treatment prevented early overfeeding-induced metabolic dysfunction in adult rats. Inhibition of early hyperinsulinaemia and adult hyperphagia might be associated with decreased metabolic disease risk in these animals. Therefore, interventions during infant development offer a key area for future research to identify potential strategies to prevent the long-term metabolic diseases. We suggest that metformin is a potential tool for intervention. ABSTRACT: Given the need for studies investigating the possible long-term effects of metformin use at crucial stages of development, and taking into account the concept of metabolic programming, the present work aimed to evaluate whether early metformin treatment might program rats to resist the development of adult metabolic dysfunctions caused by overnutrition during the neonatal suckling phase. Wistar rats raised in small litters (SLs, three pups per dam) and normal litters (NLs, nine pups per dam) were used as models of early overfeeding and normal feeding, respectively. During the first 12 days of suckling, animals from SL and NL groups received metformin, whereas the controls received saline injections. Food intake and body weight were monitored from weaning until 90 days of age, when biometric and biochemical parameters were assessed. The metformin treatment decreased insulin concentrations in pups from SL groups, and as adults, these animals showed improvements in glucose tolerance, insulin sensitivity, body weight gain, white fat pad stores and food intake. Low-glucose insulinotrophic effects were observed in pancreatic islets from both NL and SL groups. These results indicate that early postnatal treatment with metformin inhibits early overfeeding-induced metabolic dysfunctions in adult rats.",

      "abstract": "CONTEXT: It is unclear how white adipose tissue (WAT) inflammatory signaling proteins respond during the early stages of overnutrition. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of short-term, high-fat overfeeding on fasting abdominal subcutaneous WAT total content and phosphorylation of proteins involved in nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) inflammatory signaling, systemic metabolic and inflammatory biomarkers. DESIGN: Individuals consumed a high-fat (65% total energy from total fat), high-energy (50% above estimated energy requirements) diet for 7 days. RESULTS: Fifteen participants (aged 27 ± 1 years; body mass index 24.4 ± 0.6 kg/m2) completed the study. Body mass increased following high-fat overfeeding (+1.2 ± 0.2 kg; P < 0.0001). However, total content and phosphorylation of proteins involved in NF-κB inflammatory signaling were unchanged following the intervention. Fasting serum glucose (+0.2 ± 0.0 mmol/L), total cholesterol (+0.4 ± 0.1 mmol/L), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (+0.3 ± 0.1 mmol/L), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (+0.2 ± 0.0 mmol/L), and lipopolysaccharide-binding protein (LBP; +4.7 ± 2.1 µg/mL) increased, whereas triacylglycerol concentrations (-0.2 ± 0.1 mmol/L) decreased following overfeeding (all P < 0.05). Systemic biomarkers (insulin, soluble cluster of differentiation 14 [CD14], C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-α and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1) and the proportion and concentration of circulating CD14+ monocytes were unaffected by overfeeding. CONCLUSION: Acute lipid oversupply did not impact on total content or phosphorylation of proteins involved in WAT NF-κB inflammatory signaling, despite modest weight gain and metabolic alterations. Systemic LBP, which is implicated in the progression of low-grade inflammation during the development of obesity, increased in response to a 7-day high-fat overfeeding period.",

      "abstract": "Enteral energy delivery above requirements (overfeeding) is believed to cause adverse effects during critical illness, but the literature supporting this is limited. We aimed to quantify the reported frequency and clinical sequelae of energy overfeeding with enterally delivered nutrition in critically ill adult patients. A systematic search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CINAHL from conception to November 28, 2018, identified clinical studies of nutrition interventions in enterally fed critically ill adults that reported overfeeding in 1 or more study arms. Overfeeding was defined as energy delivery > 2000 kcal/d, > 25 kcal/kg/d, or ≥ 110% of energy prescription. Data were extracted on methodology, demographics, prescribed and delivered nutrition, clinical variables, and predefined outcomes. Cochrane \"Risk of Bias\" tool was used to assess the quality of randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Eighteen studies were included, of which 10 were randomized (n = 4386 patients) and 8 were nonrandomized (n = 223). Only 4 studies reported a separation in energy delivery between treatment groups whereby 1 arm met the definition of overfeeding, which reported no between-group differences in mortality, infectious complications, or ventilatory support. Overfeeding was associated with increased insulin administration (median 3 [interquartile range: 0-41.8] vs 0 [0-30.6] units/d) and upper-gastrointestinal intolerance in 1 large RCT and with duration of antimicrobial therapy in a small RCT. There are limited high-quality data to determine the impact of energy overfeeding of critically ill patients by the enteral route; however, based on available evidence, overfeeding does not appear to affect mortality or other important clinical outcomes.",

There might be differences in the fatty acid (FA) handling in adipose tissue when both ethnicities are exposed to high-fat overfeeding. The objective of the present study was to investigate the molecular adaptation in relation to FA metabolism in response to overfeeding with a high-fat diet (OHFD) in South Asian and Caucasian men. Ten South Asian men (BMI 18-29 kg/m2) and ten Caucasian men (BMI 22-33 kg/m2), matched for body fat percentage, aged 20-40 years were included. A weight-maintenance diet (30 % fat, 55 % carbohydrate and 15 % protein) was given for 3 d followed by 3 d of overfeeding (150 % energy requirement) with a high-fat diet (60 % fat, 25 % carbohydrate and 15 % protein) while staying in a respiration chamber. Before and after overfeeding, abdominal subcutaneous fat biopsies were taken. Proteins were isolated, analysed and quantified for short-chain 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase (HADH), carnitine palmitoyl-transferase 1α (CPT1a), adipose TAG lipase, perilipin A (PLINA), perilipin B, lipoprotein lipase and fatty acid binding protein 4 using Western blotting. OHFD decreased the HADH level (P < 0·05) in Caucasians more than in Asians (P < 0·05), but the baseline and after intervention HADH level was relatively higher in Caucasians. The level of CPT1a decreased in South Asians and increased in Caucasians (P < 0·05). PLINA did not change with diet but the level was higher in South Asians (P < 0·05). The observed differences in HADH and PLINA levels as well as in CPT1a response may be important for differences in the long-term regulation of energy (fat) metabolism in these populations.",

      "abstract": "The early-life environment is important in programming brain development, and metabolic disruptions at this time can have long-lasting effects. Previously, we have shown that rats overfed for the first 3 weeks of their neonatal life maintain obesity into adulthood. Neonatal overfeeding also leads to primed hypothalamic and hippocampal microglia that are hyper-responsive to an immune challenge in adulthood. However, whether this microglial priming contributes to the obese phenotype and whether it is possible to reverse either the obesity or the microglial priming are not clear. In the present study, we hypothesised that an intervention with minocycline during the juvenile period (postnatal day 21-42) would normalise both the microglial priming and obesity. To induce obesity in neonatal Wistar rats, we manipulated the litter sizes in which they were suckled, yielding litters of 12 (control-fed) or four (neonatally overfed). After weaning, we administered minocycline i.p. every second day for a 3-week period and examined body composition and microglial profiles 24 hours following an immune challenge with lipopolysaccharide. As demonstrated previously, neonatal overfeeding resulted in prolonged weight gain. However, minocycline failed to reverse this effect. Minocycline did reverse microglial priming in feeding-related regions of the hypothalamus, with minimal effects on pro-inflammatory cytokines and on microglial number and morphology in the hippocampus. Thus, the programming effect of neonatal overfeeding on microglial priming can be ameliorated by minocycline later in life. However, the persistent obesity seen after neonatal overfeeding is likely not driven by changes in hypothalamic inflammation and microglial activity.",

      "abstract": "Maternal over- and restricted-feeding during gestation have similar negative consequences for the offspring, including decreased muscularity, increased adiposity, and altered metabolism. Our objective was to determine the effects of poor maternal nutrition during gestation (over- and restricted-feeding) on the offspring muscle metabolite profile. Pregnant ewes (n = 47) were fed 60% (RES), 100% (CON), or 140% (OVER) of NRC requirements starting at day 30.2 ± 0.2 of gestation. Offspring sample collection occurred at days 90 and 135 of gestation, and within 24 h of birth. C2C12 myoblasts were cultured in serum collected from offspring at birth (n = 18; 6 offspring per treatment) for analysis of oxidative and glycolytic capacity. Unbiased metabolite analysis of longissimus muscle samples (n = 72; 8 fetuses per treatment per time point) was performed using mass spectrometry. Data were analyzed by ANOVA for main effects of treatment, time point, and their interaction. Cells cultured in serum from RES offspring exhibited increased proton leak 49% (p = 0.01) compared with CON, but no other variables of mitochondrial respiration or glycolytic function were altered. Mass spectrometry identified 612 metabolites. Principle component analysis identified day of gestation as the primary driver of metabolic change; however, maternal diet also altered the lipid and amino acid profiles in offspring. The abundance of 53 amino acid metabolites and 89 lipid metabolites was altered in RES compared with CON (p ≤ 0.05), including phospholipids, sphingolipids, and ceramides within the lipid metabolism pathway and metabolites involved in glutamate, histidine, and glutathione metabolism. Similarly, abundance of 63 amino acid metabolites and 70 lipid metabolites was altered in OVER compared with CON (p ≤ 0.05). These include metabolites involved in glutamate, histidine, lysine, and tryptophan metabolism and phosphatidylethanolamine, lysophospholipids, and fatty acids involved in lipid metabolism. Further, the amino acid and lipid profiles diverged between RES and OVER, with 69 amino acid and 118 lipid metabolites differing (p ≤ 0.05) between groups. Therefore, maternal diet affects metabolite abundance in offspring longissimus muscle, specifically metabolites involved in lipid and amino metabolism. These changes may impact post-natal skeletal muscle metabolism, possibly altering energy efficiency and long-term health."

This study aimed to investigate the role of nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain protein 1 (NOD1) in initiating the pro-inflammatory response triggered by grain-induced SARA in the mammary gland of mid-lactating dairy cows. Twelve multiparous mid-lactating Holstein cows (455 ± 28 kg) were randomly assigned into two groups to conduct the experiment for 18 weeks as follows: one group was fed a low-concentrate (LC) diet as a control (40% grain), and the other was fed an HC diet as a treatment (60% grain). Overall, the results showed that a decreased rumen pH and elevated γ-D-glutamyl-meso-diaminopimelic acid (iE-DAP) concentrations in the HC group compared with LC group. The concentration of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6 and tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), significantly increased in the lacteal vein of the HC group than LC group. The mRNA expression levels of NOD1, receptor-interacting protein2 (RIP2), NF-κBp65 (p65), IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-α, which involved in inflammatory response, were up-regulated in the HC-induced mammary gland. The changes of the target proteins, including NOD1, p65 and pp65 presented the same tendency as those of the target genes. Collectively, long-term high concentrate feeding-induced SARA increased the rumen iE-DAP concentration which activated NOD1-NF-κB signalling pathway-dependent inflammation in the mammary gland of mid-lactating cows.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Parenteral nutrition (PN) overfeeding is a potential risk factor in the development of infections and other complications including hyperglycaemia, refeeding syndrome and liver dysfunction. This study was conducted to evaluate the impact of a quality improvement initiative to reduce PN overfeeding. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study of a quality improvement initiative. SETTING: A health system comprised of two US Department of Veterans Affairs medical centres. PATIENTS: Patients receiving PN. INTERVENTIONS: Methods to reduce overfeeding included the use of standardised PN products with lower dextrose to amino acid ratios, reduced use of intravenous lipid emulsion (ILE), and use of adjusted body weights or guideline-recommended predictive equations for energy requirements. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome measures were the doses of kilocalories, amino acids and ILE in each cohort. The proportions of patients developing complications before and after the intervention were evaluated. RESULTS: The mean maximum total daily kilocalorie dose was 30.2 kcal/kg/day in the preintervention group (n=86) vs 23.4 kcal/kg/day in the postintervention group (n=62) (p<0.001). More patients in the postintervention group received reduced ILE during the first week of PN therapy compared with the preintervention group (p<0.001). The mean maximum total daily amino acid dose in each group was not significantly different. Significantly fewer cases of central line-associated bloodstream infections, hyperglycaemia and liver dysfunction were observed in the postintervention group. CONCLUSIONS: A quality improvement initiative to reduce PN overfeeding was effective in reducing kilocalorie and ILE doses while maintaining similar amino acid doses. Observed complications were reduced following the intervention."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Overconsumption of energy-dense foods and sleep restriction are both associated with the development of metabolic and cardiovascular diseases, but their combined effects remain poorly evaluated. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess whether sleep restriction potentiates the effects of a short-term overfeeding on intrahepatocellular lipid (IHCL) concentrations and on glucose homeostasis. DESIGN: Ten healthy subjects were exposed to a 6-d overfeeding period (130% daily energy needs, with 15% extra energy as sucrose and 15% as fat), with normal sleep (8 h sleep opportunity time) or sleep restriction (4 h sleep opportunity time), according to a randomized, crossover design. At baseline and after intervention, IHCL concentrations were measured by proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and a dual intravenous [6,6-2H2]-, oral 13C-labeled glucose tolerance test and a polysomnographic recording were performed. RESULTS: Overfeeding significantly increased IHCL concentrations (Poverfeeding < 0.001; overfeeding + normal sleep: +53% ± 16%). During the oral glucose tolerance test, overfeeding significantly increased endogenous glucose production (Poverfeeding = 0.034) and the oxidation of 13C-labeled glucose load (Poverfeeding = 0.038). Sleep restriction significantly decreased total sleep time, and the duration of stages 1 and 2 and rapid eye movement sleep (all P < 0.001), whereas slow-wave sleep duration was preserved (Poverfeeding × sleep = 0.809). Compared with overfeeding, overfeeding + sleep restriction did not change IHCL concentrations (Poverfeeding × sleep = 0.541; +83% ± 33%), endogenous glucose production (Poverfeeding × sleep = 0.567), or exogenous glucose oxidation (Poverfeeding × sleep = 0.118). Sleep restriction did not significantly alter blood pressure, heart rate, or plasma cortisol concentrations (all Poverfeeding × sleep = NS). CONCLUSIONS: Six days of a high-sucrose, high-fat overfeeding diet significantly increased IHCL concentrations and increased endogenous glucose production, suggesting hepatic insulin resistance. These effects of overfeeding were not altered by sleep restriction. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT02075723. Other study ID numbers: SleepDep 02/14.",

We conducted two experiments to investigate the effects of diet, water composition and overfeeding on prevalence of SLS in newly metamorphosed harlequin frogs (Atelopus spp.). In our first experiment, we offered 400 full-sibling tadpoles of Atelopus certus isocaloric diets in treatments of 31%, 37%, 42% and 48% crude protein respectively. Tadpoles fed higher protein diets metamorphosed faster, but the incidence of SLS exceeded 80% in all treatments leading to the conclusion that variation in dietary protein was not responsible for causing SLS. We used 720 full-sibling Atelopus glyphus tadpoles in a second experiment to examine the effects of diet type, water composition and diet ration on SLS. We found that an overall incidence of 58% spindly leg in tadpoles reared in tap water, but reduced to about 10% in water treated by reverse osmosis and then reconstituted. It is possible that the reverse osmosis treatment removed some factor that caused the SLS, or that the reconstitution may have added a mineral lacking in the original tap water. Within tap water treatments, overfeeding tadpoles in tanks increased the incidence of SLS. We recommend further experimental research into this condition to identify the causative factors in the water. Additional research into the nutritional composition of food available to wild tadpoles would be useful in formulating captive diets, that have to date been solely based on surrogate species.",

On days 0, 10, and 20, body composition (dual energy X-ray), blood chemistry, glucose tolerance [oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT)], and substrate oxidation (indirect calorimetry) were measured. OGTT included 1% fructose labeled with (U-13C) fructose to assess liver de novo lipogenesis. Histological changes and related cellular markers were assessed from muscle biopsies collected on days 0 and 20. While the cocktail did not prevent the decrease in insulin sensitivity and its muscular correlates induced by the intervention, it fully prevented the hypertriglyceridemia, the drop in fasting HDL and total fat oxidation, and the increase in de novo lipogenesis. The cocktail further prevented the decrease in the type-IIa muscle fiber cross-sectional area and was associated with lower protein ubiquitination content. The circulating antioxidant capacity was improved by the cocktail following the OGTT. In conclusion, a cocktail of nutrient compounds from dietary origin protects against the alterations in lipid metabolism induced by physical inactivity and fructose overfeeding. NEW & NOTEWORTHY This is the first study to test the efficacy of a novel dietary nutrient cocktail on the metabolic and physiological changes occurring during 20 days of physical inactivity along with fructose overfeeding. The main findings of this study are that 1) reduction in daily steps leads to decreased insulin sensitivity and total fat oxidation, resulting in hyperlipemia and increased de novo lipogenesis and 2) a cocktail supplement prevents the alterations on lipid metabolism.",

      "abstract": "CONTEXT: Iron overload has been associated with greater adipose tissue (AT) depots. We retrospectively studied the potential interactions between iron and AT during an experimental overfeeding in participants without obesity. METHODS: Twenty-six participants (mean body mass index ± SD, 24.7 ± 3.1 kg/m2) underwent a 56-day overfeeding (+760 kcal/d). Serum iron biomarkers (ELISA), subcutaneous AT (SAT) gene expression, and abdominal AT distribution assessed by MRI were analyzed at the beginning and the end of the intervention. RESULTS: Before intervention: SAT mRNA expression of the iron transporter transferrin (Tf) was positively correlated with the expression of genes related to lipogenesis (lipin 1, ACSL1) and lipid storage (SCD). SAT expression of the ferritin light chain (FTL) gene, encoding ferritin (FT), an intracellular iron storage protein, was negatively correlated to SREBF1, a gene related to lipogenesis. Serum FT (mean, 92 ± 57 ng/mL) was negatively correlated with the expression of SAT genes linked to lipid storage (SCD, DGAT2) and to lipogenesis (SREBF1, ACSL1). After intervention: Overfeeding led to a 2.3 ± 1.3-kg weight gain. In parallel to increased expression of lipid storage-related genes (mitoNEET, SCD, DGAT2, SREBF1), SAT Tf, SLC40A1 (encoding ferroportin 1, a membrane iron export channel) and hephaestin mRNA levels increased, whereas SAT FTL mRNA decreased, suggesting increased AT iron requirement. Serum FT decreased to 67 ± 43 ng/mL. However, no significant associations between serum iron biomarkers and AT distribution or expansion were observed. CONCLUSION: In healthy men, iron metabolism gene expression in SAT is associated with lipid storage and lipogenesis genes expression and is modulated during a 56-day overfeeding diet.",

The present study aimed to evaluate the effects of postnatal overfeeding on GC regulation and lipogenesis in the liver and to observe the impact of GC on hepatocyte lipid metabolism. METHODS: In vivo, Male Sprague-Dawley rat pup litters were adjusted to litter sizes of three (small litter, SL) or ten (normal litter, NL) on postnatal day 3 and then given standard chow from postnatal week 3 (W3) to W13. In vitro, HepG2 cells were stimulated by GC, mifepristone (Mi) or GC + Mi within 48 h, followed by sodium oleate (OA) intervention (or not) for 24 h. Intracellular lipid droplets, triglyceride (TG) concentrations and gene expression related to lipid metabolism were measured in hepatic tissues or HepG2 cells. RESULTS: In vivo, weight gain in the body and liver and TG concentrations in the liver were significantly increased in the SL rats compared to the NL rats at W3 and W13 (p < 0.05); mRNA expression of hepatic 11β-HSD1, acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1 (ACC), stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 (SCD1), fatty acid synthase (FASN) and their nuclear transcription factor, sterol regulatory element binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c) (p < 0.05), was also increased. In vitro, intracellular lipid droplets and TG content in HepG2 cells increased under stimulation with GC or OA (p < 0.05); the increase was more significant following treatment with GC and OA together (p < 0.05). The ACC, SCD1, FASN and SREBP-1c mRNA expression changes were highly similar to the changes in TG content in cells. All the changes induced by GC disappeared when the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) was blocked by Mi. CONCLUSIONS: Postnatal overfeeding induced GC overexposure through 11β-HSD1 up-regulation in the liver. GC activated hepatic de novo lipogenesis (DNL) via GR and led to hepatic lipid accumulation, which increased the risk of NAFLD during adulthood."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: High-fat diets (HFDs) have been linked to low-grade inflammation and insulin resistance. OBJECTIVE: The main purpose of the present study was to assess whether acute overfeeding with an HFD affects insulin sensitivity, gut barrier function, and fecal microbiota in humans. METHODS: In a prospective intervention study, 24 healthy men [mean ± SD: age 23.0 ± 2.8 y, body mass index (in kg/m2) 23.0 ± 2.1] received an HFD (48% of energy from fat) with an additional 1000 kcal/d (as whipping cream) above their calculated energy expenditure for 7 d. Insulin sensitivity (hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp), gut permeability (sugar and polyethylene glycol absorption tests, plasma zonulin), and gut microbiota profiles (high-throughput 16S rRNA gene sequencing) were assessed before and after overfeeding, and 14 d after intervention. Additionally, inflammation markers such as high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, lipopolysaccharide-binding protein, leptin, high-molecular-weight adiponectin, calprotectin, regulated on activation normal, T cell expressed and secreted (RANTES), and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 were measured in plasma by ELISA. Finally, lipid parameters were analyzed in serum by a laboratory service. RESULTS: Although participants gained 0.9 ± 0.6 kg (P < 0.001) body weight, overnutrition was not associated with a significant change in insulin sensitivity (M value and glucose disposal). Overfeeding for 7 d resulted in elevated serum total (10.2%), LDL (14.6%) and HDL (14.8%) cholesterol concentrations (P < 0.01). In contrast, fasting plasma triglyceride significantly declined (29.3%) during overfeeding (P < 0.001). In addition, there were no significant changes in inflammatory markers. Urine excretion of 4 sugars and polyethylene glycol, used as a proxy for gut permeability, and plasma concentration of zonulin, a marker of paracellular gut permeability, were unchanged. Moreover, overfeeding was not associated with consistent changes in gut microbiota profiles, but marked alterations were observed in a subgroup of 6 individuals. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that short-term overfeeding with an HFD does not significantly impair insulin sensitivity and gut permeability in normal-weight healthy men, and that changes in dominant communities of fecal bacteria occur only in certain individuals. The study was registered in the German Clinical Trial Register as DRKS00006211.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to determine whether net cycling efficiency (NET) is altered by 24-hour fasting or overfeeding and whether it correlates with dietary-related energy expenditure (EE) and future weight change. METHODS: In a crossover design, healthy subjects fasted or were overfed for 24 hours while in a whole-room calorimeter using five diets with doubled energy needs: standard, high-carbohydrate (75%), high-fat (60%), high-protein (30%), and low-protein (3%) diets. Graded cycling exercise at low power outputs (10-25-50 W) was performed the day before and after each dietary intervention. RESULTS: NET did not change following any dietary intervention (all P > 0.05 vs. 0). Individual changes in NET did not correlate with EE responses to dietary interventions. However, the change in NET after low-protein overfeeding was inversely correlated with baseline body fat (r = -0.60, P = 0.01); that is, NET increased in lean but decreased in overweight subjects (Δ = 0.010 ± 0.010 vs. -0.013 ± 0.009, P = 0.0003). Increased NET following the low-protein diet was associated with weight gain after 6 months (r = 0.60, P = 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Despite no substantial effect of acute overfeeding or fasting on NET, the change in NET following low-protein overfeeding depends on adiposity and may influence weight change, suggesting that increased efficiency in a setting of protein scarcity is an adaptive response that may ultimately lead to weight gain.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Intramyocellular lipid (IMCL) is inversely related to insulin sensitivity in sedentary populations, yet no prospective studies in humans have examined IMCL accumulation with overfeeding. METHODS: Twenty-nine males were overfed a high-fat diet (140% caloric intake, 44% from fat) for 8 weeks. Measures of IMCL, whole-body fat oxidation from a 24-hour metabolic chamber, muscle protein extracts, and muscle ceramide measures were obtained before and after the intervention. RESULTS: Eight weeks of overfeeding did not increase overall IMCL. The content of smaller lipid droplets peripherally located in the myofiber decreased, while increases in larger droplets correlated inversely with glucose disposal rate. Overfeeding resulted in inhibition of Akt activity, which correlated with the reductions in smaller, peripherally located lipid droplets and drastic increases in ceramide content. Additionally, peripherally located lipid droplets were associated with more efficient lipid oxidation. Finally, participants who maintained a greater number of smaller, peripherally located lipid droplets displayed a better resistance to weight gain with overfeeding. CONCLUSIONS: These results show that lipid droplet size and location rather than mere IMCL content are important to understanding insulin sensitivity.",

      "abstract": "The early-life period is extremely vulnerable to programming effects from the environment, many of which persist into adulthood. We have previously demonstrated that adult rats overfed as neonates have hypothalamic microglia that are hyper-responsive to an immune challenge, as well as hippocampal microglia that respond less efficiently to learning. We therefore hypothesised that neonatal overfeeding would alter the ability of hippocampal microglia to respond to an immune challenge with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and that concomitant minocycline, a tetracycline antibiotic that suppresses microglial activity, could restore these responses. We induced neonatal overfeeding by manipulating the litter sizes in which Wistar rat pups were raised, so the pups were suckled in litters of four (neonatally overfed) or 12 (control-fed). We then examined the hippocampal microglial profiles 24 hour after an immune challenge with LPS and found that the neonatally overfed rats had dramatically increased microglial numbers in the hippocampus after immune challenge compared to control-fed rats. Attempts to reverse these effects with minocycline revealed repeated that neonatal injections, whether with minocycline or with saline, markedly suppressed microglial number and density throughout the hippocampus and abolished the difference between the groups in their responses to LPS. These data suggest that neonatal overfeeding not only can have lasting effects on hippocampal immune responses, but also that neonatal exposure to a protocol of repeated injections, irrespective of treatment, has a pronounced long-term impact, highlighting the importance of considering these effects when interpreting experimental data.",

      "abstract": "In palmipeds, overfeeding leads to hepatic steatosis, also called \"foie gras\" which is the result of many metabolic mechanisms. In order to understand these mechanisms, we decided to measure the expression of genes implicated in lipid metabolism during 12 hours (h) following the last meal of the overfeeding period. We have shown that there is a precocious expression (within 2 h) of fatty acid synthase and acyl CoA synthetase long-chain 1 in liver and muscle of mule ducks in addition with a later peak. Furthermore, di-acyl glycerol acyl transferase presents the highest induction of expression in liver and it is overexpressed quite a long time, positioning this enzyme as a key factor in hepatic steatosis. These observations are quite similar in muscle. Lipoprotein secretion is upregulated later in postprandial period, with an upregulation of apolipoprotein and microsomal triglycerides transfer protein beginning at 5 h in liver or muscle. Regarding hepatic re-uptake of lipid, lesser variations are observed, suggesting that fatty acid binding protein and very low-density lipoprotein receptor (VLDLR) are already at their maximum expression specifically in these tissues. In muscle, VLDLR and LDLR upregulation is observed 5 h after the meal, associated with an overexpression in the adipose tissue of lipase maturation factor 1 involved in the maturation of lipoprotein lipase. These findings will allow us to better understand the kinetic treatment in lipid metabolism after a meal in overfed ducks. This first report on kinetic expression will allow researcher to better target their sampling time knowing the optimal point of expression of each gene.",

This study determined glycaemic control and selected gut hormone responses to nutrient intake before and after 7 d of high-fat overfeeding. Nine healthy individuals (five males, four females) performed a mixed meal tolerance test (MTT) before and after consuming a high-fat (65 %), high-energy (+50 %) diet for 7 d. Measurements of plasma glucose, NEFA, acylated ghrelin, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP) and serum insulin were taken before (fasting) and at 30-min intervals throughout the 180-min MTT (postprandial). Body mass increased by 0·79 (sem 0·14) kg after high-fat overfeeding (P<0·0001), and BMI increased by 0·27 (sem 0·05) kg/m2 (P=0·002). High-fat overfeeding also resulted in an 11·6 % increase in postprandial glucose AUC (P=0·007) and a 25·9 % increase in postprandial insulin AUC (P=0·005). Acylated ghrelin, GLP-1 and GIP responses to the MTT were all unaffected by the high-fat, high-energy diet. These findings demonstrate that even brief periods of overeating are sufficient to disrupt glycaemic control. However, as the postprandial orexigenic (ghrelin) and anorexigenic/insulintropic (GLP-1 and GIP) hormone responses were unaffected by the diet intervention, it appears that these hormones are resistant to short-term changes in energy balance, and that they do not play a role in the rapid reduction in glycaemic control.",

      "abstract": "Epidemiologic studies and studies in rodents point to potential risks from developmental exposure to BPA on cardiometabolic diseases. Furthermore, it is becoming increasingly evident that the manifestation and severity of adverse outcomes is the result of interaction between developmental insults and the prevailing environment. Consistent with this premise, recent studies in sheep found prenatal BPA treatment prevented the adverse effects of postnatal obesity in inducing hypertension. The gene networks underlying these complex interactions are not known. mRNA-seq of myocardium was performed on four groups of four female sheep to assess the effects of prenatal BPA exposure, postnatal overfeeding and their interaction on gene transcription, pathway perturbations and functional effects. The effects of prenatal exposure to BPA, postnatal overfeeding, and prenatal BPA with postnatal overfeeding all resulted in transcriptional changes (85-141 significant differentially expressed genes). Although the effects of prenatal BPA and postnatal overfeeding did not involve dysregulation of many of the same genes, they affected a remarkably similar set of biological pathways. Furthermore, an additive or synergistic effect was not found in the combined treatment group, but rather prenatal BPA treatment led to a partial reversal of the effects of overfeeding alone. Many genes previously known to be affected by BPA and involved in obesity, hypertension, or heart disease were altered following these treatments, and AP-1, EGR1, and EGFR were key hubs affected by BPA and/or overfeeding.

Here we investigated the effects of dietary calcium supplementation on BAT autonomic nerve activity, sympathoadrenal function and cardiovascular parameters in adult obese rats that were raised in small litters (SL group). Three days after birth, SL litters were adjusted to three pups to induce early overfeeding. The control group remained with 10 pups/litter until weaning (NL group). At PN120, the SL group was randomly divided into the following: rats fed with standard chow (SL) and rats fed with dietary calcium carbonate supplementation (SL-Ca, 10g/kg chow). Animals were killed either at PN120 or PN180. At both ages, SL rats had higher BAT autonomic nervous system activity, mass and adipocyte area, as well as increased heart rate and blood pressure (systolic and diastolic); 2 months of calcium supplementation normalized these parameters. At PN180 only, UCP1 and TRβ1 in BAT were decreased in SL rats. These changes were also prevented by calcium treatment. Also at PN180, the SL group presented higher tyrosine hydroxylase and adrenal catecholamine contents, as well as lower hypothalamic POMC and MC4R contents. Calcium supplementation did not revert these alterations. Thus, we demonstrated that dietary calcium supplementation was able to improve cardiovascular parameters and BAT thermogenesis capacity in adult animals that were early overfed during lactation.",

      "abstract": "Bisphenol-A (BPA) is a widely used endocrine-disrupting chemical. Prenatal exposure to BPA is known to affect birth weight, but its impact on the cardiovascular system has not been studied in detail. In this study, we investigated the effects of prenatal BPA treatment and its interaction with postnatal overfeeding on the cardiovascular system. Pregnant sheep were given daily subcutaneous injections of corn oil (control) or BPA (0.5 mg/kg/day in corn oil) from day 30 to day 90 of gestation. A subset of female offspring of these dams were overfed to increase body weight to ~30% over that of normal fed controls. Cardiovascular function was assessed using non-invasive echocardiography and cuff blood pressure (BP) monitoring at 21 months of age. Ventricular tissue was analyzed for gene expression of cardiac markers of hypertrophy and collagen at the end of the observation period. Prenatal BPA exposure had no significant effect on BP or morphometric measures. However, it increased atrial natriuretic peptide gene expression in the ventricles and reduced collagen expression in the right ventricle. Overfeeding produced a marked increase in body weight and BP. There were compensatory increases in left ventricular area and internal diameter. Prenatal BPA treatment produced a significant increase in interventricular septal thickness when animals were overfed. However, it appeared to block the increase in BP and left ventricular area caused by overfeeding. Taken together, these results suggest that prenatal BPA produces intrinsic changes in the heart that are capable of modulating morphological and functional parameters when animals become obese in later life.",

In the present study, we evaluated whether obesity is associated with changes in the mesocorticolimbic dopaminergic reward system in these animals at adulthood. We also assessed the anti-obesity effects of dietary calcium supplementation. To induce early overfeeding, litters were adjusted to three pups on postnatal day (PN)3 (SL group). Control litters were kept with 10 pups each until weaning (NL group). On PN120, SL animals were subdivided into two groups: SL (standard diet) and SL-Ca [SL with calcium supplementation (10 g calcium carbonate/kg rat chow) for 60 days]. On PN175, animals were subjected to a food challenge: animals could choose between a high-fat (HFD) or a high-sugar diet (HSD). Food intake was recorded after 30 min and 12 h. Euthanasia occurred on PN180. SL rats had higher food intake, body mass and central adiposity. Sixty days of dietary calcium supplementation (SL-Ca) prevented these changes. Only SL animals preferred the HFD at 12 h. Both SL groups had lower tyrosine hydroxylase content in the ventral tegmental area, lower dopaminergic transporter content in the nucleus accumbens, and higher type 2 dopamine receptor (D2R) content in the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus (ARC). They also had higher neuropeptide Y (NPY) and lower pro-opiomelanocortin contents in the ARC. Calcium treatment normalised only D2R and NPY contents. Precocious obesity induces long-term effects in the brain dopaminergic system, which can be associated with an increased preference for fat at adulthood. Calcium treatment prevents this last alteration, partially through its actions on ARC D2R and NPY proteins.",

Hispanic infants persistently show higher prevalence rates for being overweight compared to other infants. Little is known about factors promoting excessive infant weight gain in Latinos. PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to describe multidimensional factors and maternal feeding practices that may correlate with infant overfeeding in Latina mothers. METHODS: Participants were 62 low-income immigrant Latina mothers and their infants. Study measures were: acculturation; maternal feeding beliefs and practices; food availability; temperament; 24-hour dietary recall; and infant's weight-for-height z score. RESULTS: In regression models adjusted for infant's age, healthier feeding practices were significantly predicted by maternal education and infant's age. Most mothers preferred feeding their infants either formula or a combination of breast milk and formula. A significant proportion of the infants were overweight or obese and yet some mothers displayed difficulty recognizing this problem. CONCLUSION: Future intervention efforts should focus primarily on the promotion of healthy feeding practices that discourage overfeeding and support exclusive breastfeeding among this ethnic group.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Brown adipose tissue (BAT) is a highly metabolic tissue that generates heat and is negatively associated with obesity. BAT has been proposed to mediate both cold-induced thermogenesis (CIT) and diet-induced thermogenesis (DIT). Therefore, it was investigated whether there is a relationship between CIT and DIT in humans. METHODS: Nine healthy men (23 ± 3 years old, 23.0 ± 1.8 kg m(-2) ) completed 20 min of cold exposure (4°C) 5 days per week for 4 weeks. Before and after the intervention, CIT (the increase in resting metabolic rate at 16°C relative to 22°C) was measured by a ventilated hood indirect calorimeter, whereas DIT was measured as the 24-h thermic response to 1 day of 50% overfeeding (TEF150% ) in a respiratory chamber. RESULTS: After the cold intervention, CIT more than doubled from 5.2% ± 14.2% at baseline to 12.0% ± 11.1% (P = 0.05), in parallel with increased sympathetic nervous system activity. However, 24-h energy expenditure (2,166 ± 206 vs. 2,118 ± 188 kcal day(-1) ; P = 0.15) and TEF150% (7.4% ± 2.7% vs. 7.7% ± 1.6%; P = 0.78) were unchanged. Moreover, there was no association between CIT and TEF150% at baseline or post-intervention, nor in their changes (P ≥ 0.47). CONCLUSIONS: Cold acclimation resulted in increased CIT but not TEF150% . Therefore, it is likely that CIT and DIT are mediated by distinct regulatory mechanisms.",

The relationships between dietary acid load, mild metabolic acidosis and insulin resistance remain unclear. The objective of this study was to assess the association between dietary acid load, body acid/base markers and peripheral insulin resistance at baseline and following a short-term overfeeding intervention in healthy individuals. METHODS: In a cross-sectional study of 104 men and women, insulin sensitivity was measured by hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp. Plasma lactate, a marker of metabolic acidosis, was assessed and acid load scores (potential renal acid load, PRAL and net endogenous acid production, NEAP) derived from diet diaries. The cohort was grouped into lean and overweight/obese and the latter further classified as insulin-sensitive (Obsen) and insulin-resistant (Obres) based on hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp glucose infusion rate (GIR, top tertile vs. bottom 2 tertiles). A subset of 40 individuals participated in an overfeeding intervention (+1250 kcal/day) for 28 days and studies repeated. RESULTS: Obsen and Obres were matched for adiposity (BMI and fat mass, both P = 1). Fasting plasma lactate was higher in Obres (0.78 [0.63-1.14] mmol/L) compared with both lean (0.71 [0.44-0.90] mmol/L, P = 0.02) and Obsen (0.67 [0.56-0.79] mmol/L, P = 0.04) and not different between lean and Obsen (P = 0.9). Overfeeding was characterized by an increase in dietary acid load scores PRAL (P = 0.003) and NEAP (P = 0.05), a reduction in GIR necessary to maintain euglycemia (P = 0.03) and an increase in fasting plasma lactate (P = 0.02). The change in lactate was inversely associated with the change in GIR (r = -0.36, P = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: Mild metabolic acidosis, measured by plasma lactate, aligns with insulin resistance independent of obesity and is induced by short-term increases in energy and dietary acid load in healthy humans. Further studies are required to determine whether buffering mild metabolic acidosis improves insulin resistance and reduces diabetes risk.",

      "abstract": "Intrauterine variations in nutrient allowance can alter body composition and tissue features of the porcine offspring around birth. This study aimed to determine the effects of fetal weight variations between littermates and of maternal dietary regimen during gestation on fetal muscle traits just before birth. Fourteen pregnant gilts were reared under a conventional (control, CTL; n=7) or an experimental (treatment, TRT; n=7) dietary regimen during gestation. The dietary treatment provided 70% of the protein and digestible energy contents of the CTL diet during the first 70 days of gestation and then, 115% of the protein and digestible energy contents up to farrowing. At 110 days of gestation, sows were sacrificed and one fetus having a low (824±140 g) and one having a normal (1218±192 g) BW per litter were sampled. Irrespective of maternal dietary regimen, the longissimus muscle of the small fetuses exhibited higher expression levels of DLK1/Pref1 and NCAM1/CD56, two genes known to be downregulated during normal skeletal muscle development. Expression levels of the embryonic isoform of the myosin heavy chain (MyHC), both at the mRNA and at the protein levels, were also higher in small fetuses. In addition, the ratios of perinatal to embryonic and of adult fast to developmental MyHC isoforms were generally lower in light fetuses compared with their medium-weight littermates. These modifications suggest a delayed myofiber development in spontaneous growth-retarded fetuses. Finally, GLUT1 was expressed to a lesser extent in the muscle of small v. normal fetuses, suggesting decreased ability for glucose uptake in muscle. Initial feed restriction and subsequent overfeeding of sows during gestation led to a lower expression of the myogenic factor MYOD1, a prerequisite for myogenic initiation in skeletal muscle. This maternal strategy was also associated with a lower expression level of insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGFR) but an upregulation of IGF2. This suggests an altered susceptibility of muscle cells to IGFs' signal in fetuses from treated sows. Altogether, intrauterine growth restriction impaired fetal muscle development, and restricted feeding followed by overfeeding of gestating sows did not allow small fetuses to recover normal contractile and metabolic characteristics.",

Such experimental paradigm programs overweight, insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, increased adipose glucocorticoid metabolism [up-regulation of glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11β-HSD1)], and overexpression of proinflammatory cytokines in mesenteric adipose tissue (MAT) in adulthood. We studied the effects of pioglitazone, a PPARγ agonist, treatment on the above-mentioned overfeeding-induced alterations. Nine-month-old rats normofed or overfed during the immediate postnatal period were given pioglitazone (3 mg/kg/day) for 6 weeks. Pioglitazone stimulated weight gain and induced a redistribution of adipose tissue toward epididymal location with enhanced plasma adiponectin. Treatment normalized postnatal overfeeding-induced metabolic alterations (increased fasting insulinemia and free fatty acids) and mesenteric overexpression of GR, 11β-HSD11, CD 68, and proinflammatory cytokines mRNAs, including plasminogen-activator inhibitor type 1. Mesenteric GR mRNA levels correlated positively with mesenteric proinflammatory cytokines mRNA concentrations. In vitro incubation of MAT obtained from overfed rats demonstrated that pioglitazone induced a down-regulation of GR gene expression and normalized glucocorticoid-induced stimulation of 11β-HSD1 and plasminogen-activator inhibitor type 1 mRNAs. Our data show for the first time that the metabolic, endocrine, and inflammatory alterations induced by early-onset postnatal obesity can be reversed by pioglitazone at the adulthood. They demonstrate that pioglitazone, in addition to its well-established effect on adipose tissue redistribution and adiponectin secretion, reverses programing-induced adipose GR, 11β-HSD1, and proinflammatory cytokines overexpression, possibly through a GR-dependent mechanism.",

MEASUREMENTS: Creatinine clearance rate (Ccr) from 24-h urine collection, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) from the modification of diet in renal disease (MDRD), insulin sensitivity/glucose disposal rate (GDR) by a euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp, components from basic metabolic panels and serum lipid panels. RESULTS: Both eGFR and Ccr increased with overfeeding (P = 0.04) and serum lipids (all P < 0.05), along with a decrease in insulin sensitivity (P = 0.003). Fasting glucose concentration was not affected (P = 0.98), but the per cent change in Ccr correlated positively with the change in GDR with overfeeding (r = 0.39, P = 0.02). Six months following overfeeding, serum glucose was maintained, and no evidence of urinary glucose was observed at any time-point. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that renal hyperfiltration may act as a mechanism to preserve insulin sensitivity through maintenance of systemic glucose homoeostasis with caloric excess.",

Design/Participants/Intervention: Thirty-nine healthy volunteers were overfed for 56 days with a high-fat diet (3180 kJ/d). Energy metabolism (indirect calorimetry) was characterized in the fasting state and during a test meal before and at the end of the diet. Skeletal muscle biopsies were taken at day 0 and day 56. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Change in gene expression, mitochondrial respiration, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD(+)) content, and acetylation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivator-1α (PGC-1α) in skeletal muscle was measured. RESULTS: Overfeeding increased body weight (+2.6 kg) and fat mass concomitantly with a shift in the use of substrates as energy fuel toward preferential oxidation of carbohydrates instead of lipids. Changes in lipid metabolic gene expression supported this observation, with a reduction in pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 expression that could be the consequences of decreased NAD(+) concentration and reduced deacetylase activity of the sirtuins, as supported by hyperacetylation of PGC-1α after overfeeding. Interestingly, this reduction of the sirtuin PGC-1α pathway was associated with increased mitochondrial gene expression and higher respiration rate under these conditions. CONCLUSION: Adaptation to lipid overfeeding and regulation of fuel partitioning in human muscle appear to rely on a dissociation between the regulatory functions of the sirtuin-PGC-1α pathway on fatty acid oxidation and on mitochondrial regulation. This may facilitate lipid storage during a period of positive energy balance while maintaining mitochondrial functions and oxidative capacities.",

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sprague-Dawley rats underwent cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) or sham operation. Preestablished continuous intravenous glucose infusion was initiated immediately after surgery. First, rats with CLP-inducing sepsis were divided into three groups on the basis of the target blood glucose (BG) levels: high glucose (HG) group (overfed, >300 mg/dL), moderate glucose group (moderate hyperglycemia, 200-300 mg/dL), and no glucose group (100-150 mg/dL). The sham group received the same glucose infusion as that of the HG group. BG and plasma interleukin (IL) 6 levels were monitored over time. All rats were sacrificed 9 h after surgery to evaluate lung histology and measure hepatic total glutathione and malondialdehyde contents. Based on the results, the high glucose and insulin (HI) group was added to septic groups as a model of insulin therapy, in which insulin with the same HG dose as that in the HG group was administered to maintain moderate hyperglycemia. RESULTS: BG level in all groups remained in the preestablished target range throughout the experiment. Plasma IL-6 level in all septic groups increased in a time-dependent manner, whereas that in the sham group with moderate hyperglycemia hardly increased. Nine hours after CLP, plasma IL-6 level in the HG group rose to 7407.5 ± 1987.3 pg/mL, which was three times higher than that in the other septic groups. There was no significant difference among moderate glucose, no glucose, and HI groups, in which BG level remained constant at <300 mg/dL. The HG group showed the worst consequences of lung injury and oxidative stress in the liver, which were completely stable in HI group. CONCLUSIONS: Acute severe hyperglycemia in critical illness might excessively boost the existing systemic inflammatory response in a threshold-based manner. Insulin therapy under overfeeding could strongly inhibit such a boosting effect and oxidative stress in the liver.",

      "abstract": "Obese postmenopausal women have increased risk of breast cancers with poorer clinical outcomes than their lean counterparts. However, the mechanisms underlying these associations are poorly understood. Rodent model studies have recently identified a period of vulnerability for mammary cancer promotion, which emerges during weight gain after the loss of ovarian function (surgical ovariectomy; OVX). Thus, a period of transient weight gain may provide a life cycle-specific opportunity to prevent or treat postmenopausal breast cancer. We hypothesized that a combination of impaired metabolic regulation in obese animals prior to OVX plus an OVX-induced positive energy imbalance might cooperate to drive tumor growth and progression. To determine if lean and obese rodents differ in their metabolic response to OVX-induced weight gain, and whether this difference affects later mammary tumor metabolism, we performed a nutrient tracer study during the menopausal window of vulnerability. Lean animals preferentially deposited excess nutrients to mammary and peripheral tissues rather than to the adjacent tumors. Conversely, obese animals deposited excess nutrients into the tumors themselves. Notably, tumors from obese animals also displayed increased expression of the progesterone receptor (PR). Elevated PR expression positively correlated with tumor expression of glycolytic and lipogenic enzymes, glucose uptake, and proliferation markers. Treatment with the antidiabetic drug metformin during ovariectomy-induced weight gain caused tumor regression and downregulation of PR expression in tumors. Clinically, expression array analysis of breast tumors from postmenopausal women revealed that PR expression correlated with a similar pattern of metabolic upregulation, supporting the notion that PR+ tumors have enhanced metabolic capacity after menopause. Our findings have potential explanative power in understanding why obese, postmenopausal women display an increased risk of breast cancer.",

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of essential amino acid supplementation on the increase in hepatic fat content induced by a high-fructose diet in healthy subjects. DESIGN: Nine healthy male volunteers were studied on 3 occasions in a randomized, crossover design after 6 d of dietary intervention. Dietary conditions consisted of a weight-maintenance balanced diet (control) or the same balanced diet supplemented with 3 g fructose · kg(-1) · d(-1) and 6.77 g of a mixture of 5 essential amino acids 3 times/d (leucine, isoleucine, valine, lysine, and threonine) (HFrAA) or with 3 g fructose · kg(-1) · d(-1) and a maltodextrin placebo 3 times/d (HFr); there was a washout period of 4 to 10 wk between each condition. For each condition, the intrahepatocellular lipid (IHCL) concentration, VLDL-triglyceride concentration, and VLDL-[(13)C]palmitate production were measured after oral loading with [(13)C]fructose. RESULTS: HFr increased the IHCL content (1.27 ± 0.31 compared with 2.74 ± 0.55 vol %; P < 0.05) and VLDL-triglyceride (0.55 ± 0.06 compared with 1.40 ± 0.15 mmol/L; P < 0.05). HFr also enhanced VLDL-[(13)C]palmitate production. HFrAA significantly decreased IHCL compared with HFr (to 2.30 ± 0.43 vol%; P < 0.05) but did not change VLDL-triglyceride concentrations or VLDL-[(13)C]palmitate production. CONCLUSIONS: Supplementation with essential amino acids blunts the fructose-induced increase in IHCL but not hypertriglyceridemia. This is not because of inhibition of VLDL-[(13)C]palmitate production. This trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as NCT01119989.",

      "abstract": "Mechanisms regulating subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) insulin sensitivity and gene network expression during the peripartal period were evaluated in cows fed to meet or exceed prepartal energy requirements. Holstein cows were dried off at -50 d relative to expected parturition and fed a controlled-energy diet [CON; net energy for lactation=1.24 Mcal/kg of dry matter (DM); 36% of DM as wheat straw] until -21 d. Cows were then randomly assigned (n=7/diet) to either the same CON diet or a moderate-energy close-up diet (OVE; net energy for lactation=1.47 Mcal/kg of DM) until parturition. Biopsies of SAT were harvested at -10, 7, and 21 d for mRNA expression of 48 genes associated with insulin signaling, adipogenesis, and lipolysis. In vitro basal and insulin-stimulated insulin receptor substrate 1 tyrosine phosphorylation (IRS1-PY) was assessed at -10 and 7 d. The OVE led to more positive energy balance and greater serum insulin concentration prepartum. Compared with CON, OVE led to a more drastic increase in serum NEFA and also greater overall serum BHBA postcalving, both of which were associated with greater hepatic total lipid and triacylglycerol concentration. Close-up OVE did not improve any aspect of performance. In prepartal SAT, insulin-stimulated IRS1-PY was greater in OVE than in CON. However, IRS1-PY, serum insulin, and GLUT4 expression decreased postpartum regardless of prepartal treatment, suggesting a more severe state of insulin resistance. The expression of all genes encoding adipogenic regulators (PPARG and ZFP423), most lipogenic enzymes/inducers (FASN, SCD, DGAT2, and INSIG1), and basal-lipolysis regulators (ATGL and ABDH5) was greater at -10 d in OVE than in CON. Whereas adipogenic and basal lipolysis regulator expression remained greater in cows fed OVE by 7 d postpartum, expression of all lipogenic enzymes decreased regardless of diet. Despite those responses, the approximately 3-fold increase in expression of IRS1 and ZFP423 between 7 and 21 d suggested that insulin responsiveness and adipogenic capacity of SAT were partially restored. Expression of the preadipocyte marker DLK1, adiponutrin (PNPLA3), and fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) was undetectable. Results suggested that close-up energy overfeeding did not exacerbate insulin resistance in SAT. Signs of restored insulin responsiveness (upregulation of IRS1, INSIG2, SREBF1, and ZFP423) were apparent as early as 3 wk postpartum. Thus, identifying specific nutrients capable of activating PPARγ after calving in AT might help accelerate its replenishment. A regulatory network encompassing the genes and physiological measurements obtained is proposed.",

Follicular development was induced by twice-daily injections of FSH on days 13 and 14 of the estrous cycle, and ovaries and blood samples were collected on day 15 of the estrous cycle. During the 8-wk experiment, for control ewes BW and BCS did not change, but for overfed ewes mean (± SEM) BW and BCS increased (11.8 ± 1.1 kg and 2.0 ± 0.1, respectively) and for underfed ewes decreased (14.2 ± 0.9 kg and 0.7 ± 0.1, respectively). The number of follicles was determined; oocytes were collected and subjected to in vitro maturation and fertilization. After IVF, developing embryos were evaluated throughout the 8-d culture period. The proportion of cleaved oocytes after IVF and developing morula and blastocyst were less (P < 0.0001) in overfed and underfed ewes than in control ewes. However, number of visible follicles, total number of oocytes, number of healthy oocytes, and percentage of healthy oocytes were similar for control, overfed, and underfed ewes. Serum insulin concentration was greater (P < 0.05) in overfed ewes than in underfed ewes, estradiol 17-β (E(2)) concentration was greater (P < 0.05) in underfed ewes than in overfed ewes, but triiodothyronine (T(3)) and thyroxine (T(4)) concentrations were similar in all treatment groups. These data show that inadequate feeding has a negative effect on oocyte quality which results in lower oocyte cleavage after IVF and morula and blastocyst formation; overfeeding increased serum insulin and underfeeding increased serum E(2) but not T(3) or T(4). These data emphasize the importance of diet for reproductive and metabolic functions. Furthermore, the mechanisms through which enhanced or decreased energy in diet affect oocyte quality and serum insulin and E(2) concentrations remain to be elucidated.",

To investigate possible links, nine young healthy men (24 ± 3 yr; body mass index of 21.6 ± 2.5 kg/m(2)) completed 14 days of step reduction (10,000 to 1,500 steps/day) and overfeeding (+50% kcal). Body composition (dual X-ray absorptiometry, MRI), aerobic fitness (maximal O(2) consumption), systemic inflammation and insulin sensitivity [oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp] were assessed before (day 0), during (days 3 and 7), and immediately after the intervention (day 14), with follow-up tests (day 30). Body weight had increased at days 7 and 14 (P < 0.05). The amount of visceral fat had increased at day 14 compared with day 0 (P < 0.05). The insulin response to the OGTT had increased at days 7 and 14 (P < 0.05). Insulin sensitivity, estimated using the Matsuda index, had decreased at days 3 and 7 (P < 0.01). At day 14, glucose infusion rates had decreased by ∼44% during the euglycemic clamps (P < 0.05). Also, plasma levels of leptin and adiponectin had increased (P < 0.05), whereas no changes were seen in inflammatory markers. At day 30, body weight and whole body adiposity were still elevated compared with day 0 (P < 0.05), whereas the insulin sensitivity as well as the insulin response to the OGTT did not differ from baseline. The glucose response to the OGTT was only affected at day 30, with a decrease compared with day 0. Our data show that insulin sensitivity was impaired after 3 days of inactivity and overfeeding. Impairments in insulin sensitivity occurred before changes in body composition, supporting the notion that the initial steps in impairment of insulin sensitivity may be linked directly to the effects of inactivity and a high calorie intake.",

      "abstract": "Geese form a fatty liver after feeding on a carbohydrate-rich diet, possibly as an evolutionary adaptation to accumulate reserves for migration. To gain insight into the gene-regulation processes of hepatic steatosis in geese, we examined the profile of transcriptional expression in goose fatty liver and control liver by suppression subtractive hybridization and measured the levels of serum biochemical variables. We found 107 genes whose expression was different between the treatment and control groups. The main functions of these genes are metabolic processes, including the metabolism of carbohydrates, amino acids, and lipids. Twenty-four genes were classified using the Kyoto Encyclopaedia of Genes and Genomes pathways. Twelve genes that related to metabolic and cellular processes were confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR. A specific positive effect of feeding was observed on the expression of genes involved mainly in unsaturated fatty acids and triglyceride synthesis, and a negative effect was observed on genes involved in β-oxidation, cholesterol metabolism, and glycolysis. The results could serve as an important reference for the development of goose breeding for fatty liver production and human liver disease research.",

      "abstract": "Retinol-binding protein 4 (RBP4) is a plasma protein which is elevated in obesity and type 2 diabetes. We aimed to investigate whether RBP4 represents a mechanism underlying the associations between low birth weight (LBW), high-fat diet, and insulin resistance. Forty-six young, lean men with low (n = 20) or normal (n = 26) birth weight underwent a 5-day high-fat high-calorie (HFHC) dietary intervention. In vivo glucose metabolism was assessed by euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp, glucose tracer and intravenous glucose tolerance test techniques. Body composition was measured by a dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry scan, and plasma RBP4 by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RBP4 was not associated with birth weight, but with BMI (β = 0.9 µg/ml (0.08; 1.8) (95% confidence interval), P = 0.03) and plasma levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (β = 5.3 µg/ml (1.9; 8.7), P = 0.03) and triglycerides (β = 15.4 µg/ml (9.5; 21.3), P < 0.001). Under baseline diet conditions, RBP4 was associated with decreased disposition index (D(i)) (β = -2.4% (-4.5%; -0.2%), P = 0.04) and increased basal hepatic glucose production rate (HGP) (β = 0.02 mg kg(-1) min(-1) (0.002; 0.04), P = 0.03), but not associated with peripheral glucose disposal rate or hepatic insulin resistance index. RBP4 levels were not influenced by overfeeding or related to peripheral and hepatic insulin resistance provoked by the dietary intervention. In conclusion, plasma RBP4 in young men associates with components of the metabolic syndrome, but is not determined by birth weight and seems not to be involved in short-term high-fat diet-induced insulin resistance.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To study the effects of snacking based on fast acting carbohydrates (candy) or fat and protein (peanuts) in a prospective randomized, parallel intervention study. METHODS: Basal metabolic rate (BMR) and cardiovascular risk factors were measured before and after hyper-alimentation by addition of 20 kcal/kg (84 kJ/kg) body weight of either candy or roasted peanuts, to the regular caloric intake, for two weeks in healthy subjects. Eleven men and 14 women completed the randomized study. RESULTS: Energy-intake increased similarly in the groups (candy: +46.1+/-35%, peanuts: +46.8+/-28% p=0.96). Body-weight (candy: from 67.3+/-7.6 kg to 68.1+/-7.3 kg, p=0.01, nuts: from 68.7+/-6.1 kg to 69.0+/-5.7 kg p=0.3) and waist circumference increased significantly only in the candy group. At the end of the study LDL cholesterol (candy: 2.6+/-0.4 mmol/l peanuts: 2.1+/-0.4 mmol/l, p=0.005) and ApoB/ApoA-1-ratio (candy: 0.68+/-0.16 peanuts 0.53+/-0.11, p=0.01) were higher in the candy group than in the peanut group. On the other hand, BMR increased only in the peanut group (candy: from 6.657+/-1.1 MJ/24 h to 6.762+/-1.1 MJ/24 h, p=0.3 nuts: from 6.896+/-0.98 MJ/24 h to 7.256+/-1.1 MJ/24 h, p=0.02). CONCLUSION: Two weeks of snacking based on peanuts does not cause the same negative metabolic effects as an isocaloric diet in which the snacking is based on short acting carbohydrates in the form of candy in non-obese healthy subjects.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Obesity is caused by the excessive accumulation of adipose tissue as a result of a chronic energy surplus. Little is known regarding the molecular mechanisms involved in the response to an energy surplus in human adipose tissue at the genomic level. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to investigate changes in the transcriptome of abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue after a positive energy challenge induced by overfeeding in both lean and obese subjects to identify novel obesity candidate genes. DESIGN: A total of 26 men were recruited and classified on the basis of percentage body fat (measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry) as lean (<20%) or obese (>25%) to participate in the baseline comparison. Sixteen men participated in the overfeeding study (8 lean and 8 obese). Adipose tissue biopsy samples were collected from all subjects at the subumbilical region. Global gene expression profiles were determined at baseline and after a 7-d hypercaloric diet at 40% above normal energy requirements by using whole human genome DNA microarrays. RESULTS: Overfeeding induced differential expression in 45 genes. Six genes displayed a significant interaction effect between adiposity status and overfeeding treatment, including transferrin (TF), stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD), transaldolase 1 (TALDO1), cathepsin C (CTSC), insulin receptor substrate 2 (IRS2), and pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase, isozyme 4 (PDK4). Overfeeding resulted in changes in expression of these genes in lean subjects, whereas no significant changes were evident in obese subjects. CONCLUSIONS: Differential expression of these 6 genes may represent a protective mechanism at the molecular level in lean subjects in response to an energy surplus. These genes represent valuable candidates for downstream studies related to obesity.",

OBJECTIVE: To assess the relationships between changes in serum adiponectin concentration and adiposity, glucose, and insulin in response to long-term overfeeding in identical twins and to calculate the twin resemblance in serum adiponectin concentrations. SUBJECTS AND DESIGN: Twenty-four sedentary young men [mean (+/-SD) age, 21+/-2 yr] who constituted 12 pairs of healthy identical twins were studied for metabolic and adiponectin changes in response to overfeeding. INTERVENTION: Subjects were overfed by 84,000 kcal over a 100-day period. OUTCOME MEASURES: The overfeeding study provides an opportunity to examine the relationships between adiponectin and changes in body weight, adiposity, plasma glucose and insulin. RESULTS: Serum adiponectin concentration correlated positively with body weight (r= 0.41, p=0.05) at baseline but not with indicators of adiposity or with visceral fat. No relationship existed between baseline adiponectin concentration and body weight or adiposity gains with overfeeding. However, serum adiponectin decreased significantly by -2.35+/-0.48 microg/ml (p=0.001) in response to overfeeding. Baseline adiponectin levels correlated negatively with changes in plasma fasting glucose levels (r=-0.53, p=0.01) and homeostasis model assessment index (r=-0.41, p=0.05), independently of fat mass. The intrapair coefficient for twin resemblance (r=0.75, p=0.001) strongly suggests that baseline serum adiponectin concentration is a familial trait. CONCLUSIONS: These data provide evidence that adiponectin concentration is a familial trait in normal-weight individuals, that it decreases when challenged by positive energy balance, and that its overfeeding-induced variations are correlated with glucose and insulin levels.",

SD rats were fed Purina Certified Rodent Diet AL (group 1), DR at 72-79% of AL (group 2), DR at 68-72% of AL (group 3) or DR at 47-48% of AL (group 4) for 106 weeks. Interim necropsies were performed at 13, 26, and 53 weeks, after a 7-day 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine (BrdU)-filled minipump implantation. Body weights, organ weights, carcass analysis, in-life data including estrous cyclicity, and histopathology were determined. At 6-7 weeks of age SD rats had 6% body fat. AL-feeding resulted in hypertriglyceridemia, hypercholesterolemia, and dietary-induced obesity (DIO) by study week 14, with 25% body fat that progressed to 36-42% body fat by 106 weeks. As early as 14 weeks, key biomarkers developed for spontaneous nephropathy, cardiomyopathy, and degenerative changes in multiple organ systems. Early endocrine disruption was indicated by changes in metabolic and endocrine profiles and the early development and progression of lesions in the pituitary, pancreatic islets, adrenals, thyroids, parathyroids, liver, kidneys, and other tissues. Reproductive senescence was seen by 9 months with declines in estrous cyclicity and pathological changes in the reproductive organs of both sexes fed AL or moderate DR, but not marked DR. The diabesity syndrome in AL-fed, DIO SD rats was readily modulated or prevented by moderate to marked DR. Moderate DR of balanced diets resulted in a better toxicology model by significantly improving survival, controlling adult body weight and obesity, reducing the onset, severity, and morbidity of age-related renal, endocrine, metabolic, and cardiac diseases. Moderate DR feeding reduces study-to-study variability, increases treatment exposure time, and increases the ability to distinguish true treatment effects from spontaneous aging. The structural and metabolic differences between the phenotypes of DIO and DR SD rats indicated changes of polygenic expression over time in this outbred stock. AL-overfeeding of SD rats produces a needed model of DIO and diabesity that needs further study of its patterns of polygenic expression and phenotype.",

Birds of the four genotypes were also reared contemporaneously with a growing diet distributed ad libitum. Muscle samples (Pectoralis major and Sartorius) were collected at 14 weeks of age on 8 ducks per treatment. The muscle fibre typing, the total lipid and triglyceride contents in myofibres and the relative surface occupied by adipocytes on the cross-sectional area of the muscles were determined by histological and image analysis. Overfeeding induced a marked increase of body weight but had no significant effect on the muscle weight, the cross-sectional area (CSA) of myofibres and the muscle typology. In muscles, overfeeding induced a large accumulation of lipids, mainly in adipocytes whose relative surface increased 1.5 fold in P. major and 2.1 fold in Sartorius and an increase in triglyceride content of fast twitch oxydo-glycolytic and glycolytic fibres in P. major only (+ 37 and + 16% respectively). Genotype had no significant effect on the muscle typology. By comparison with the other genotypes, Muscovy ducks exhibited the highest body weight, the highest muscle weight which could partly be explained by the highest fibre CSA and the lowest intramuscular fat content in adipocytes and myofibres (only fast twitch oxydo-glycolytic fibres in P. major). We observed the reverse situation for the Pekin ducks. The crossbred ducks always presented intermediate values except for body weight.",

Ghrelin is suppressed in the postprandial state and has been linked to both type II diabetes and obesity. AIMS: To investigate the effects of a period of overfeeding with high-fat dietary supplements on plasma ghrelin levels in nonobese men. METHODS: Six healthy males (21-34 y; BMI 21-24 kg/m(2)) underwent the dietary intervention after completing diet and exercise diaries for 7 days. For 3 further weeks subjects followed their own diet diary supplemented with 125 ml single cream and 50 g roasted peanuts (88 g fat, 15 g Protein, 8 g carbohydrate) every day. Oral fat tolerance tests (OFTT) were undertaken at baseline, 7, 14 and 21 days of fat supplementation. The diet was increased in energy by 3.9 MJ/day and from a mean of 29-45% energy intake from fat with a small weight gain noted each week (P=0.009). RESULTS: Ghrelin concentrations were significantly reduced during the baseline OFTT. The postprandial ghrelin response (AUC) was significantly reduced following 2 weeks of dietary supplementation (P=0.005) increasing the suppression of plasma ghrelin by 18% despite only a 3% increase in body weight. Plasma triacylglycerol (P=0.009) and leptin (P=0.035) concentrations were also elevated and postprandial pancreatic polypeptide levels decreased (P=0.038) following dietary-supplementation. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the metabolic profile associated with obesity, including a reduction in plasma ghrelin levels, may be related to recent dietary energy intake and precedes the development of significant adiposity.",

      "abstract": "To investigate the relationship between development of obesity and the small intestinal functions two experimental models of male Wistar rats were used in the present work: 1) early postnatally overfed rats, nursed from birth to weaning in small litters (SL, 4 pups/nest), and 2) neonatally monosodium glutamate treated rats (MSG 2 mg/g b.w. administered s.c. for 4 days after birth) submitted to the same early nutritional manipulation. After weaning, all animals had free access to a standard pellet diet and at 40 and 80 days of age their body weight, body fat content and food consumption as well as changes of the brush-border-bound duodenal and jejunal alkaline phosphatase (AP) activity were compared with parameters of the offsprings raised under normal feeding conditions (NL, 8 pups/nest). At 40 and 80 days of age the postnatally overfed pups from SL nests became heavier, displayed a significantly increased epididymal plus retroperitoneal fat pad weight (P<0.01) and significantly higher AP activity in both segments of the small intestine (P<0.01) in comparison with rats nursed in NL nests, although their mean daily food intake did not differ from that of non-obese rats during the postweaning periods examined. In contrast, the same treatment of MSG rats had only a small effect on late appearance of obesity, i.e. in early postnatally overfed and normally fed MSG rats a similar pattern of body weight, food intake, adiposity and AP activity was found after weaning. The effect of MSG-treatment was also accompanied by the appearance of normophagia, hypophagia and stunted growth on day 40 and day 80, respectively. Moreover, the size of fat depots and the increase of brush-border-bound AP activity in MSG rats belonging to the SL and NL groups was quantitatively similar to the values size of these parameters observed in SL obese rats subjected to early postnatal overnutrition. These results indicate that postnatal nutritional experience (overnutrition) may represent a predisposing factor in control rats from small litters for the development of obesity in later life. Permanently increased small intestinal AP activity observed after weaning in both models of obesity when hyperphagia is not present suggest that these functional changes and associated alterations in food digestion could be a component of regulatory mechanisms contributing to the maintenance of their elevated body fat weight.",

      "abstract": "The aim of this experiment was to study the consequences of precise feeding on the myofibre characteristics and metabolic traits of the breast muscle (Pectoralis major, Pm) of Muscovy ducks. Twenty-four samples of breast muscle, without skin or subcutaneous fat, from two groups of ducks, control and overfed respectively, were collected at 14 weeks of age. We assayed different chemical (water content, crude proteins, total lipid ashes, total and thermosoluble collagen), biochemical (activities of the CS, LDH and beta-HAD enzymes), histological (muscle fibre typing and intramuscular adipocyte measurements) and technological (drip and cooking losses, texture) determinations. At the force-feeding period, the overfed ducks weighed 6366 g and the control ducks 4606 g of body weight. In the PM muscle, some modifications of the biochemichal parameters and enzyme activities were observed but neither the shear force nor the histological characteristics of the breast muscle were affected by the fattening treatment. The overfed birds had an increased total lipids content (correlated to an increase in the intramuscular area occupied by the adipocyte) and a different fatty acid profile as the result of a higher energy feed intake. The lipids of the Pm muscle of the overfed ducks contained more C16:0, C16:1n-7 and C18:1n-9, but less C18:0, C18:2n-6 and C20:4n-6 than the control birds. These results show that in response to high energy feeding, the muscle is able to respond quickly on a metabolic basis (by increasing the activities of the oxydative enzymes) without changing its typology or morphology. Additionally, fattening was correlated to a degradation in the technological qualities of the breast muscle, especially an increase in the cooking losses.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The results of previous studies suggest that de novo lipogenesis may play an important role in the etiology of obesity, particularly during overconsumption of different carbohydrates. OBJECTIVE: We hypothesized that de novo lipogenesis would increase during overfeeding, would vary depending on the type of carbohydrate consumed, and would be greater in obese than in lean women. DESIGN: De novo lipogenesis was measured during 96 h of overfeeding by 50% with either sucrose or glucose and during an energy balance treatment (control) in 8 lean and 5 obese women. De novo lipogenesis was determined by measuring the amount of deuterium incorporation into plasma triacylglycerols. Fat and carbohydrate balance were measured simultaneously by continuous whole-body calorimetry. RESULTS: De novo lipogenesis did not differ significantly between lean and obese subjects, except with the control treatment, for which de novo lipogenesis was greater in the obese subjects. De novo lipogenesis was 2- to 3-fold higher after overfeeding by 50% than after the control treatment in all subjects. The type of carbohydrate overfeeding (sucrose or glucose) had no significant effect on de novo lipogenesis in either subject group. Estimated amounts of absolute VLDL production ranged from a minimum of 2 g/d (control) to a maximum of 10 g/d after overfeeding. This compares with a mean fat balance of approximately 275 g after 96 h of overfeeding. Individual subjects showed characteristic amounts of de novo lipogenesis, suggesting constitutive (possibly genetic) differences. CONCLUSION: De novo lipogenesis increases after overfeeding with glucose and sucrose to the same extent in lean and obese women but does not contribute greatly to total fat balance.",

Recent studies in humans have shown that plasma ghrelin concentration was inversely related to body fat and was lower in Pima Indians, a population susceptible to obesity. Whether ghrelin plays a role in the etiology of obesity in humans is unknown. We, therefore, measured plasma ghrelin concentration before and after two interventions in monozygotic twins previously studied at Laval University, Quebec City. Twelve pairs of monozygotic twins were overfed by 84,000 kcal over a 100-day period, whereas another seven pairs of monozygotic twins were submitted to a 53,000 kcal negative energy balance induced by exercise over a 93-day period. At baseline, for all the subjects, plasma ghrelin concentration was negatively correlated with body mass and body fatness (r varying from 0.36 to 0.45). The intraclass coefficient for the twin resemblance (r(I) = 0.75; p = 0.006) indicated that plasma ghrelin concentration is a familial trait. In response to the 100-day intervention, plasma ghrelin exhibited a non-significant decrease of 61 +/- 30 fmol/l (p = 0.18) with overfeeding and a non-significant increase of 58 +/- 34 fmol/l (p = 0.17) with negative energy balance. However, there was no relationship between baseline plasma ghrelin concentration and the magnitude of body weight change in both interventions. These first experimental data under \"clamped energy balance conditions\" do not provide evidence that plasma ghrelin is involved in the etiology of human obesity. However, studies in free-living individuals are needed to clarify this question.",

This finding could have implications for obesity. OBJECTIVE: We used 96-h continuous whole-body calorimetry in 8 lean and 5 obese women to assess metabolic disposal (energy dissipation and glycogen or fat storage) of a controlled excess of dietary energy supplied as different carbohydrate sources or as fat. DESIGN: Five dietary treatments were applied in random order: energy balance (control) and overfeeding by 50% of energy requirements with fat (O(fat)) or predominantly with glucose, fructose, or sucrose (O(cho)). Macronutrient oxidation rates were assessed from nonprotein gaseous exchanges. Net macronutrient balances were calculated as cumulative differences between intake and oxidation. RESULTS: Increased EE in response to overfeeding dissipated 7.9% of the energy excess with a variation in EE of <1.7% across overfeeding treatments (NS). EE during the O(fat) treatment significantly exceeded that during the control treatment in the lean but not in the obese women. There were no significant differences between lean and obese women in macronutrient oxidation or balances, so data were pooled. O(cho) induced glycogen storage on day 1 ( approximately 100 g) but thereafter progressively stimulated carbohydrate oxidation so that balance was reached on days 3 and 4. Fat oxidation was proportionately suppressed. Of the excess carbohydrate, 74% was oxidized; there were no significant differences between the various O(cho) treatments. O(fat) stimulated fat oxidation by 18% and suppressed carbohydrate oxidation. On average, 12% of the excess energy was stored as glycogen and 88% as fat; there was no significant difference between overfeeding treatments. CONCLUSION: There was no significant difference in fat balance during controlled overfeeding with fat, fructose, glucose, or sucrose.",

Following a re-analysis of these data, the arguments are put forward that since low-protein overfeeding is not only a potent stimulus of thermogenesis, but also an amplifier (or magnifier) of the small inter-individual variations in thermogenesis on the affluent (normal-protein) diet, it can be used as a tool to unmask some of the genetic and metabolic basis underlying human susceptibility to leanness and fatness.",

DESIGN: Six men [mean (s.d.) weight; 76.89 (7.00) kg, height; 1.77 (0.05) m, age; 26.4 (6.0) y], were each studied twice in a 3 d protocol. On day 1 (maintenance day) they were fed a medium fat (MF) maintenance diet (MF: 40% fat, 47% carbohydrate and 13% protein by energy) calculated at 1.6 x resting metabolic rate (RMR). Subjects entered the calorimeter at 06.30 on day 2 for 49.5 h. On day 2 (manipulation day) subjects consumed a MF diet at 1.6 x RMR with an additional 0.45 x RMR as either 1-monoglyceride or triglyceride. On day 3 (outcome day), subjects had ad libitum access to isoenergetic, isoenergetically dense MF (40 :47: 13, 550 kJ/ 100 g) foods. Subjective hunger and satiety were tracked hourly, during waking hours throughout days 1-3. RESULTS: There was no significant effect of diet on nutrient oxidation or balance either during day 2 (manipulation day) or day 3 (outcome day), fat oxidation was similar on both diets. Subjective hunger was not affected by diet on either day with mean values of 34.3 and 35.0 mm (SED 5.2) on manipulation day (day 2) and outcome day (day 3), 35.3 and 40.8 mm (SED 5.2) on the 1 -monoglyceride or triglyceride diets respectively. Day 3 food and energy intake were unaffected by the previous day's dietary treatment, with mean intakes of 15.9 and 15.6 MJ (SED 1.07) on the 1-monoglyceride or triglyceride treatments, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that when 1-monoglyceride is covertly incorporated into a diet at unusually high levels, it behaves in a manner that is very similar to triglyceride, in its effects on appetite, feeding behaviour and net nutrient balance.",

Nutrition care is best provided through repeated evaluation of patients' responses to feeding. Nutrition support may need to be modified over time to maintain metabolic stability and promote recovery. This article describes the etiology of 10 metabolic complications of overfeeding. Guidelines for recommending macronutrients are discussed, as are factors that could increase the risk of overfeeding. Patients who are very small, very large, or very old are particularly vulnerable to overfeeding. Overfeeding protein has led to azotemia, hypertonic dehydration, and metabolic acidosis. Excessive carbohydrate infusion has resulted in hyperglycemia, hypertriglyceridemia, and hepatic steatosis. High-fat infusions have caused hypertriglyceridemia and fat-overload syndrome. Hypercapnia and refeeding syndrome have also been caused by aggressive overfeeding. Dietitians can prevent or curtail the metabolic complications of overfeeding by identifying patients at risk, providing adequate assessment, coordinating interdisciplinary care plans, and delivering timely and appropriate monitoring and intervention. Dietitians need to document complications, interventions, and the outcomes of their clinical care to evaluate the appropriateness of existing nutrition guidelines.",

In the present study, the effect of CCK-8S on food intake was investigated in a nongenetic and less-stressful model of obesity due to unspecific early postnatal overfeeding in male and female rats. Reducing the normal litter size of ten to three newborn rats on day 3 of life led to an enhanced food intake resulting in an increased body weight until adulthood. Freely fed male and female, normal and obese rats were given 10 micrograms/kg CCK-8S i.p. on day 41 and 40 micrograms/kg CCK-8S on day 91 of life and food intake was measured for 24 h. Compared with treatment with saline (i.p.) 1 day before the test, the lower dose of 10 micrograms/kg CCK-8S reduced food intake for 2 h in normal, but not in obese rats. Conversely, the higher dose of 40 micrograms/kg CCK-8S reduced food intake in both normal and obese rats for 2 h, but this effect was more evident in the obese rats. Moreover, the satiating effect of CCK-8S was more pronounced and longer lasting in male than in female rats. In summary, the data suggest that the response to CCK-8S differs in normal and obese rats and depends on sex.",

There was a mean 8.4 kg increase in body weight and the average gain in body fat reaches 5.6 kg (P less than 0.0001). A biopsy of subcutaneous abdominal fat was performed, before and after the treatment, to determine fat cell weight as well as basal and catecholamine stimulated lipolyses from collagenase isolated adipocytes. Although analysis of variance revealed an increase in abdominal fat cell weight, no significant changes were noted in basal and catecholamine-stimulated lipolyses, due to large variation among individuals, results being expressed either per cell number or corrected for cell surface area. However, significant intrapair resemblance was observed in the changes of basal and epinephrine stimulated lipolyses (ri of about 0.60 in both cases), suggesting a concordant within-pair response, despite large between-pair variation. These results support the notion that the genotype may play an important role in regulating the response of abdominal adipose cells lipolytic activity to caloric excess.",

As dextrose in the dialysate provides the osmotic gradient to achieve fluid removal, frequent exchanges with dialysate containing high dextrose is occasionally used to achieve negative balance in fluid overloaded patients. It has previously been shown that dextrose absorption from the peritoneal cavity is significant. Using indirect calorimetry and analyzing the dialysate effluent for its dextrose concentration, we studied the effects of high dextrose-containing dialysate in five patients with ARF. Despite minimal intake of calories, all patients had an RQ greater than 1.0 consistent with net lipogenesis resulting from dextrose absorbed from the peritoneal cavity. Four of five patients absorbed greater than 500 g of dextrose over 24 h. As overfeeding could lead to hepatic steatosis, increased CO2 production with worsening of respiratory failure, and hyperglycemia, the risks of using high dextrose-containing dialysate fluids should be weighed carefully against potential benefits. When nutritional support is indicated in such patients, contribution of dextrose calories from dialysate fluid should be taken into account.",

      "abstract": "The effect of the beta-adrenergic antagonist propranolol on the increase in resting metabolic rate (RMR) induced by overfeeding was examined to determine whether increased beta-adrenergic activity contributes to this response. Six male subjects who were overfed with carbohydrate (1,600 excess kcal/day) for 10 days without drug treatment (control group) had increases (compared with values after 10 days of weight maintenance) in RMR after 6 days [0.24 +/- 0.06 kcal/min (22%)] and 10 days of overfeeding [0.17 +/- 0.03 kcal/min (15%)]. Eight male subjects were given a weight-maintenance diet for 10 days with oral propranolol treatment (40-60 mg every 6 h) over the last 7 days of this period. Five of these subjects were then overfed for 10 days, and three remained on the weight-maintenance diet; propranolol treatment continued until the end of the study. Propranolol significantly reduced RMR (mean 9%) before the onset of overfeeding but did not prevent increases in RMR after 6 days [0.18 +/- 0.05 kcal/min (16%)] and 10 days of overfeeding [0.17 +/- 0.03 kcal/min (15%)]. In the subjects who remained on the weight-maintenance diet throughout the study, there was no reversal of propranolol's initial reduction of RMR that would have falsely elevated the overfeeding effect. These data provide further evidence that the increase in RMR induced by overfeeding in humans is not mediated by increased beta-adrenergic activity.",

Progesterone supplement was given to some ewes on Days 8-14 after mating by using a device containing 340 mg progesterone. Blood samples were taken from all ewes on Day 12 for measurement of plasma progesterone concentrations. On Day 14 after mating all ewes were returned to pasture. Pregnancy rate was determined by returns to oestrus and was later confirmed using ultrasound. There was a decline in the peripheral progesterone concentrations with increasing ration. The pregnancy rate in ewes fed a high ration was significantly reduced when compared with those of ewes fed a medium or low ration (48% vs 68 and 67% respectively; P less than 0.05). In ewes fed the high ration exogenous progesterone increased the pregnancy rate from 48 to 76% (P less than 0.01). Progesterone treatment did not influence pregnancy rates in ewes fed medium or low rations. The number of fetuses per ewe pregnant was not influenced by level of nutrition or progesterone treatment.",

Female rats (220 g) were fed 160%, 100% or 40% of control intake, by stomach tube, until the 40% rats had lost 50 g. Other rats were starved to lose 50 g. Carcass composition was measured on one group from each treatment. The remaining rats returned to ad libitum feeding. The 160% rats were hypophagic and lost weight. Starved and 40% rats were hyperphagic and gained weight. Serum insulin increased with increased food intake. T4 was depressed by food restriction. T3 and T4 increased during weight loss in 160% rats. Carcass composition of rats from each treatment was determined at progressive stages of recovery. Overfed rats had gained 7 g of protein and 43 g of fat. Protein was soon lost but fat was still significantly increased after 44 d of recovery. Starved and restricted rats had lost 11 g of protein and 28 g of fat. Starved rats regained protein earlier than body fat. Restricted rats recovered body fat much earlier than body protein or weight. Body protein and fat may have individual regulatory mechanisms that work together to control body weight.",

This study was undertaken to determine if dietary carbohydrate supplementation throughout pregnancy could prevent the normal fall in blood pressure during the last week of gestation. Systolic blood pressure in the control-fed pregnant rats decreased progressively during the last week and was in the normotensive range by term; that of the carbohydrate-supplemented, pregnant rats remained high and was not significantly lower than that of nonpregnant rats at any time. At term, daily urinary norepinephrine excretion, but not epinephrine excretion, by the carbohydrate-supplemented pregnant rats was twice that of control-fed nonpregnant and pregnant rats, suggesting that the hypertension was due to increased sympathetic nervous activity. Carbohydrate supplementation had no effect on blood pressure or catecholamine excretion in pregnant, normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats. There were no differences in litter size or mean birth weight between diet treatment groups of either strain.",
