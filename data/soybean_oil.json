      "abstract": "In this study, we investigated the effects of germination on the phytochemical content, antioxidant activity, and oxidative stability of soybean oil. Soybeans were germinated for different periods (0, 2, 4, 6-days). The germinated soybean oil (GSO) contained more α-tocopherol, phytosterols, and carotenoids, while there were no significant differences in fatty acid content. In particular, lutein accumulation was influenced by the modulation of phytoene synthase, lycopene ε-cyclase, and lycopene β-cyclase genes during soybean germination. Antioxidant activities in vitro were the most effective after treatment with 6-day GSO. Moreover, the oxidative stability of GSO was significantly enhanced compared to that of control soybean oil. These results were attributed to the increased content of phytochemicals in soybean oil during germination. This research holds promise not only for the development of functional foods owing to the increased phytochemical content but also for the food industry owing to the enhanced oxidative stability of soybean oil.",

In this study, the effect of the dietary addition of c9, t11 and t10, c12 isomers of conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) in pure soybean oil (T1) was compared with pure soybean oil (T2) and soybean oil discarded after frying fish (Centropomus undecimalis, Pagrus pagrus, and Caranx crysos; T3) on the fatty acid profile in ewe milk and the tissues of their lambs. Forty-five multiparous ewes (East Friesian × Katahdin), 32 to 35 months old, 70 days pregnant, were randomly assigned to one of the three experimental diets. The fatty acid profile, total solids, fat, protein, and lactose in milk were determined 14 days postpartum. Fifteen lambs from each treatment were sacrificed at 70 days of age, and the fatty acid profiles in perirenal fat, muscle, and brain were determined. In milk, fat and total solids content were lower with T1. On the other hand, linoleic acid content, the sum of omega-6 and DHA were higher in T1 compared to other groups (p < 0.05). In the brain, stearic acid and linoleic acid concentration increased with T1; eicosapentaenoic acid decreased and omega-3s increased with T3, while DHA was lower in T2 (p < 0.05). The addition of CLA isomers or discarded soybean oil in ewe diet from pregnancy to lactation is advantageous for the ewe since less energy in the form of milk fat is lost. In addition, increasing the concentration of omega fatty acids in ewe diet to improve omega fatty acids in lamb's brain could be a feed strategy to increase their productivity and health."

      "abstract": "As the thermal energy dissipation and environmental pollution intensify, light-weight and biodegradable thermal insulation materials have gained significant attention. Poly(butylene adipate-co-terephthalate) (PBAT) foams, renowned for their exceptional biodegradability and thermal insulation properties, could serve as a promising material for thermal insulation. Regrettably, the insufficient foamability and inherent shrinkage behavior of PBAT foams continue to be major obstacle in developing high-performance flexible PBAT foams. In this study, epoxidized soybean oil (ESO) was grafted onto the PBAT/PLA by the ring-opening reaction to achieve micro-crosslinked structures and induce the formation of PBAT fibers within the PBAT/PLA blend. Then, further CO2 treatment significantly enhanced the crystallinity of PBAT/PLA/ESO composite, which contributed to the improvement of mechanical properties. The design of the reactive cross-linked network, coupled with enhanced crystallization, synergistically improve the foamability and mitigate the shrinkage of PBAT foams. Therefore, the PBAT/PLA/ESO foam exhibited a highly stable cellular structure with higher expansion ratio of 19.5 and low thermal conductivity of 36.7 mW/m·K. Meanwhile, the reinforced cellular structure achieved by this innovative strategy effectively provides an enhanced biodegradability, degraded by 16.1 % after only nine weeks. This approach is expected to inspire further research into the development of functional foams in thermal insulation and cushioning.",

The extraction pH was found to affect both the SOB emulsion stability and surface protein structure. Micromorphological analysis showed that the degree of SOB dispersion was higher under alkaline conditions compared to other treatment conditions (acidic or neutral). Structural changes in the SOB surface proteins, as evaluated using changes in the α-helix and β-sheet contents and fluorescence intensity, were more pronounced when extraction was performed at pH 11.0. Structural changes in SOB surface proteins also affected the amino acid fractions, surface hydrophobicity, and free sulfhydryl content. Overall, an extraction pH of 11.0 resulted in optimal SOB emulsion stability and had the greatest effect on the structural properties of the SOB surface proteins.",

      "abstract": "A subgroup of pigs from two experiments (EXP) was selected to evaluate the impact of pigs fed diets containing peroxidized soybean oil (SO) on plasma-based measures of oxidative stress and vitamin E. Pigs were fed diets containing SO that was either unprocessed (23 °C; peroxide value (PV) of 3 meq/kg and an anisidine value of 4) or thermally processed at 135 °C for 42 h (PV of 30 meq/kg and an anisidine value of 501). The corn-soybean meal-based diets contained either 10% SO (EXP 1) or 8% SO (EXP 2). Pigs were fed the experimental diets for 22 d (EXP 1, 13.5 to 24.0 kg, 2 pigs/pen) or 27 d (EXP 2, 21.3 to 37.5 kg, 1 pig/pen), each with 10 replications per dietary treatment. Pigs fed diets containing the peroxidized SO had reduced ADG, ADFI, and GF compared to pigs fed diets containing the unheated SO (P ≤ 0.01). Pigs fed diets containing peroxidized SO had increased plasma concentrations of F2-isoprostanes and reactive oxygen metabolites compared to pigs fed diets containing unheated SO (P ≤ 0.01). In contrast, plasma thiobarbituric acid reactive substances concentrations tended to decrease in pigs fed diets containing peroxidized SO compared to pigs fed diets containing unheated SO (P = 0.10). There was no apparent effect of pigs consuming diets containing peroxidized SO on plasma antioxidant adsorbent capacity or an oxidative stress index (P ≥ 0.19). Pigs fed diets containing peroxidized SO resulted in a reduction in plasma vitamin E compared to pigs fed diets containing unheated SO (P ≤ 0.01). Results indicate that adding SO that has been thermally processed thereby containing high concentrations of aldehydes resulted in inconsistent changes of markers of oxidative stress, but dramatically reduced plasma vitamin E concentrations.",

      "abstract": "Peroxidized lipids have been shown to reduce broiler performance whereupon it was theorized that dietary peroxide value (PV) plus anisidine value (AnV) may be predictive of broiler performance. In experiment (EXP) 1, 64 pens (8 broilers/pen) were fed diets containing 8 levels of peroxidized soybean oil (SO). Broilers were fed diets from 7 to 35 d of age with 8 replications per dietary treatment. Broilers fed diets containing SO processed at 135°C resulted in a reduction in average daily gain (ADG) and average daily feed intake (ADFI, P ≤ 0.05) compared to birds fed diets containing the unheated SO while birds fed diets containing SO processed at 90°C resulted in a reduction in gain to feed (GF, P ≤ 0.05) compared to birds fed diets containing the unheated SO. Summarization of this data with published data resulted in significant (P ≤ 0.01) regression models for relative ADG [ADG, % = 101.9 - (0.05 × PV) - (0.30 × AnV), SE = 4.1, R2 = 0.43], ADFI [ADFI, % = 101.7 - (0.09 × PV) - (0.19 × AnV), SE = 3.3, R2 = 0.32], and GF [GF, % = 100.4 + (0.05 × PV) - (0.14 × AnV), SE = 2.6, R2 = 0.27], albeit PV was not a significant regression parameter (P ≥ 0.36) for any equation. In EXP 2, the TMEn of four different SO was determined using the precision-fed rooster assay. Diets consisted of ground corn with SO added at 0, 7.5 or 15 % of the diet at the expense of ground corn with 4 roosters per treatment. Relative bioavailability (RBV) was determined using slope-ratio methodology where it was determined that the reduction in the RBV of peroxidized SO ranged from 12 to 29 percent compared to the unheated SO sample. These data suggests that bird performance relative to birds consuming unperoxidized lipids can be predicted based on dietary levels of PV and AnV, although the slopes for performance decline are relatively flat with the combination of PV and AnV accounting for 27 to 43 % of the response variable variance.",

A total of 450, 21-wk-old finishing pigs with an average body weight of 113.7 ± 8 kg were housed in 90 pens assigned to one of five dietary treatments in a 2 × 2 + 1 factorial design. Dietary treatments consisted of two fat sources (CWG: 4% inclusion of choice white grease and HOSO: 4% inclusion of high oleic soybean oil) each provided 2 or 4 wk before marketing. The \"+1\" diet was corn-based without fat inclusion (CON). Observations included growth performance, carcass characteristics, fatty acid (FA) profile, and sensory evaluation. Data was analyzed using PROC MIXED in SAS considering dietary treatment as a main effect, feeding duration, and their interactions. Preplanned contrasts were used to compare dietary treatments with the control. From day 14 to 28 and the overall experimental period (day 0-28), pigs fed fat-supplemented diets had a greater (P < 0.05) average daily gain and gain-to-feed ratio than CON-fed pigs. There was no significant difference (P > 0.05) in growth performance when comparing fat sources or feeding periods. Pigs supplemented with either CWG or HOSO showed a tendency to have a greater (P < 0.10) belly weight and belly yield, and a lesser (P < 0.10) loin yield and loin muscle area when compared with CON pigs. The loin from pigs fed fat sources had greater (P < 0.05) oleic acid and eicosenoic acid concentration when compared with CON. When CWG was compared with HOSO, pigs fed CWG had a higher (P < 0.05) concentration of palmitic acid and stearic acid, while the HOSO pigs had a higher concentration of oleic acid and linolenic acid in the loin. In the belly, CON had a higher (P < 0.05) concentration of palmitic acid and stearic acid compared to HOSO, while pigs fed fat sources had a higher concentration of oleic acid and eicosenoic acid. Bellies from HOSO had higher (P < 0.05) oleic acid and α-linolenic acid methyl ester concentrations, while CWG had higher concentrations of g-linolenic acid. For the sensory evaluation, the palatability and acceptability of pork were not affected (P > 0.05) by dietary treatments. In conclusion, supplementation with HOSO not only improved performance but tended to improve some carcass characteristics and increased the concentration of oleic acid, and some other unsaturated FA with a concomitant decrease in the concentration of some saturated FA in pork.",

With the increase of HPH treatment, fat globules were further broken, and their adsorption on the interface was promoted, which further enhanced the stability of cream, leading to smaller particle size and higher apparent viscosity. Moreover, whipping performance of cream is the best at 30 MPa. Textural results showed that the hardness of bubble formed by cream whipping tended to increase and then decrease after homogenization. The analysis of sensory evaluation and principal component analysis (PCA) showed that the whipping cream with 30 MPa treatment had the highest total score. Therefore, low HPH pressure could likewise improve the whipping characteristics of SOB cream. It provided the theoretical support for the production and application of high whipping performance and low trans-fat cream.",

      "abstract": "Phytosterols in vegetable oils have gained attention for their nutritional benefits in foods and food supplements. However, the use of vegetable oils in emulsions for infant formulas and parenteral nutrition has raised some concerns, as phytosterols may contribute to phytosterolemia in the case of infant formulas and, in a second scenario, to parenteral nutrition-associated liver disease. The present study proposes removing phytosterols from soybean oil using a synthetic amorphous silica Trisyl® (E551) as an adsorbent material. The process is simple and involves stirring the oil at a high temperature under vacuum conditions followed by filtration to remove the adsorbent. A rotational factorial design of experiments, considering the adsorbent/oil ratio, temperature, and time was carried out to determine the optimal conditions. Additionally, the effects on tocopherols levels and formation of trans fatty acids were explored. The total sterol content in the initial refined soybean oil was 2540 mg/kg, with 32% in ester form (813 mg/kg). The treatments effectively reduced the sterol concentration, achieving a reduction of nearly 70% when 10% Trisyl®, 140 °C, and a 90-min treatment were applied. Under these conditions, nearly 80% of the oil was recovered. Campesterol and stigmasterol levels were almost halved. Tocopherol losses were found to be below 20%. Thermal degradation, as analyzed by triacylglycerol polymers and trans fatty acids, was not observed in the treatments."

      "abstract": "Neuroinflammation is considered the principal pathogenic mechanism underlying neurodegenerative diseases, and the incidence of brain disorders is closely linked to dietary fat consumption and intestinal health. To investigate this relationship, 60 8-week-old C57BL/6J mice were subjected to a 20-week dietary intervention, wherein they were fed lard and soybean oil, each at 15% and 35% fat energy. At a dietary fat energy level of 35%, inflammation was observed in both the soybean oil and lard groups. Nevertheless, inflammation was more pronounced in the mice that were administered soybean oil. The process by which nerve cell structure is compromised, inflammatory factors are upregulated, brain antioxidant capacity is diminished, and the TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB p65 inflammatory pathway is activated resulting in damage to the brain-gut barrier. This, in turn, leads to a reduction in the abundance of Akkermansia and unclassified_f_Lachnospiraceae, as well as an increase in Dubosiella abundance, ultimately resulting in brain inflammation and damage. These results suggested that soybean oil induces more severe neuroinflammation compared to lard. Our study demonstrated that, at a dietary fat energy level of 35%, compared to soybean oil, lard could be the healthier option, the outcomes would help provide a reference basis for the selection of residents' daily dietary oil."

Thirty Holstein cows (n = 16 primiparous, n = 14 multiparous at 87 ± 26 DIM at the start of the trial) were used in a crossover design with periods lasting 21 d. The treatments were a control (CON) diet with no added soybean oil and a HOSO diet with 1.5% diet DM of high oleic soybean oil. Dry matter and milk production data were collected the last 7 d of each period, and milk composition was collected the last 3 d of each period. Fecal samples were collected 6 times during the last 3 d of each period. Body weights were collected on the last 3 d of each period after the morning milking and ultrasound scans of the longissimus dorsi on the last day of each period. Compared with CON, HOSO did not affect DMI, milk production, and milk component yields. However, a parity effect was observed with multiparous cows having increased DMI (5.9 kg/d), milk production (11.2 kg/d), and component yields, with no treatment by parity interactions. Milk fat concentration tended to be greater for HOSO cows. Body weight data tended to have an interaction between treatment and parity, with multiparous HOSO cows having increased BW compared with CON and no effect on primiparous cows. Similar treatment by parity effects were observed for BCS. Compared with CON, HOSO increased fat depth by 0.44 mm and apparent total-tract fat digestibility by 12 percentage units. The results of this study indicated no detrimental effects of HOSO on milk production parameters with an increase in milk fat concentration, fat digestibility, and deposition compared with a control diet."

      "abstract": "This work investigated the effects of 3-aminopropyl triethoxy silane (APTES) hydrolysis time on the physicochemical properties of the resulting starch/epoxidized soybean oil (ESO) bioplastics comprehensively. FTIR analysis confirmed that APTES hydrolyzed for 4 h had the best modification effect on starch. The results of XRD and TGA demonstrated the successful silylation of starch by APTES despite hydrolysis time. Silylation treatment reduced the thermal stability of starch slightly, but enhanced the thermal stability of the resultant bioplastics, revealing better interaction between silylated starch and ESO. The interfacial adhesion of starch and ESO in the bioplastics was obviously enhanced when APTES was hydrolyzed for 2-24 h. The bioplastics with APTES hydrolyzed for 2-4 h showed more desirable tensile properties as the silane hydrolysis was complete and self-condensation of hydrolyzed silanes was avoided. The bioplastics containing silylated starch still showed superior opacity and biodegradability.",

      "abstract": "The antioxidant activity of the natural phenolic extracts is limited in particular food systems due to the existence of phenolic compounds in glycoside form. Acid hydrolysis post-treatment could be a tool to convert the glycosidic polyphenols in the extracts to aglycones. Therefore, this research investigated the effects of an acid hydrolysis post-treatment on the composition and antioxidant activity of parsley extracts obtained by an ultrasound-assisted extraction method to delay lipid oxidation in a real food system (i.e., soybean oil-in-water emulsion). Acid hydrolysis conditions were varied to maximize total phenolic content (TPC) and 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging activity. When extracts were exposed to 0.6 M HCl for 2 h at 80 ℃, TPC was 716.92 ± 24.43 µmol gallic acid equivalent (GAE)/L, and DPPH radical scavenging activity was 66.89 ± 1.63 %. Not only did acid hydrolysis increase the concentrations of individual polyphenols, but it also resulted in the release of new phenolics such as myricetin and gallic acid. The extract's metal chelating and ferric-reducing activity increased significantly after acid hydrolysis. In soybean oil-in-water emulsion containing a TPC of 400 µmol GAE/L, the acid-hydrolyzed extract had an 11-day lag phase for headspace hexanal compared to the 6-day lag phase of unhydrolyzed extract. The findings indicated that the conversion of glycosidic polyphenols to aglycones in phenolic extracts can help extend the shelf-life of emulsion-based foods.",

      "abstract": "Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), including n-6 and n-3 fatty acids, are essential for enhancing the performance and health of poultry. Avian species lack desaturase enzymes for endogenous synthesis of n-6 and n-3 fatty acids. This work aimed to determine the impacts of including soybean oil (SO) and linseed oil (LO) in quail diets on growth, lipid profile, hepatic and renal functions, immunity, and antioxidant status. A total of 350 Japanese quail chicks (1-wk-old) were randomly arranged into 7 dietary treatment groups. Seven isocaloric and isonitrogenous experimental basal diets were formed based on the nutritional requirements of growing Japanese quail. Group 1, the control, received a basal with no oils, while groups 2 to 7 received a basal diet containing either 1% SO, 1.5% SO, 2% SO, 1% LO, 1.5% LO, or 2% LO, respectively. Quail groups that consumed diets containing LO at all levels showed significantly greater live body weight (LBW) at 5th wk of age than other experimental groups. The dietary incorporation of 1.5 or 2% SO or LO at all levels yielded significant improvements in body weight gain (BWG) and feed conversion ratio (FCR) through 3 to 5 and 1 to 5 wk of age. Different dietary oil sources and levels have no significant impacts on feed intake (FI) and carcass yield parameters. Lipid profile parameters were improved by adding SO and LO in quail diets, with LO having a higher effect than SO. The hepatic and renal functionality were improved by adding SO and LO in quail diets. The lowest uric acid (UA) bloodstream concentrations were recorded in the quail group fed a diet with 2% LO. Values of Gamma globulins (G-GLO) and immunoglobulins (G, M, and A) were increased by adding SO or LO to quail diets. Blood levels of MDA and TAC were improved significantly by including LO in quail diets. The activity of the superoxide dismutase (SOD) enzyme was significantly increased by adding SO or LO to quail diets. Generally, adding SO or LO to growing quail diets up to 2% could yield favorable effects on growth performance, blood lipids, hepatic and renal functions, immunity, and antioxidant status; however, LO seems to have better effects than SO.",

      "abstract": "Corn and soybean oils are among the most frequently used vehicles for water-insoluble compounds in toxicological studies. These two vegetable oils are nutrients and may induce some biological effects on animals that might interfere with the experimental results. However, their chronic effects on a developing brain have not been reported. This study aims to evaluate the neurobehavioral and brain biochemical effects of both oils on male and female Swiss albino mice. Pregnant female mice were exposed to 1 µl/g/d of either tap water, corn oil (CO), or soybean oil (SO) from early gestation (GD1) until weaning then offspring mice were exposed to the same treatment regimen until adulthood (PND70). Our results showed that developmental exposure to both oils induced body weight changes in offspring mice. In addition, we detected some behavioral abnormalities where both oil-treated groups showed a significant decrease in locomotor activity and greater levels of anxiety behavior. Moreover, our results suggest that continuous exposure to these oils may alter motor coordination, spatial memory and induce depression-like behavior in adult mice. These alterations were accompanied by increased malondialdehyde, superoxide dismutase, and glutathione peroxidase activities in specific brain regions. Together, these data suggest that exposure to CO and SO as vehicles in developmental studies may interfere with the behavioral response and brain redox homeostasis in offspring mice.",

      "abstract": "The objective of this study was to determine whether adding phytoncide oil (PO) and soybean oil (SBO) to the dairy cow diet could increase milk conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) and depress methane (CH4) emissions in Holstein dairy cows. Rumen fermentation was conducted at four levels of SBO (0, 1, 2, and 4%, on DM basis) and two levels of PO (0 and 0.1%, on DM basis) with in vitro experiment. To evaluate blood parameters, fecal microbe population, milk yield and fatty acid compositions, and CH4 production, in vivo experiment was conducted using 38 Holstein dairy cows divided into two groups of control (fed TMR) and treatment (fed TMR with 0.1% PO and 2% SBO as DM basis). In the in vitro study (Experiment 1), PO or SBO did not affect rumen pH. However, SBO tended to decrease ruminal ammonia-N (p = 0.099). Additionally, PO or SBO significantly decreased total gas production (p = 0.041 and p = 0.034, respectively). Both PO and SBO significantly decreased CH4 production (p < 0.05). In addition, PO significantly increased both CLA isomers (c9, t11 and t10, c12 CLA) (p < 0.001). Collectively, 0.1% PO and 2% SBO were selected resulting in most effectively improved CLA and decreased CH4 production. In the in vivo study (Experiment 2), 0.1% PO with 2% SBO (PSO) did not affect complete blood count. However, it decreased blood urea nitrogen and magnesium levels in blood (p = 0.021 and p = 0.01, respectively). PSO treatment decreased pathogenic microbes (p < 0.05). It increased milk yield (p = 0.017) but decreased percentage of milk fat (p = 0.013) and MUN level (p < 0.01). In addition, PSO treatment increased both the concentration of CLA and PUFA in milk fat (p < 0.01). Finally, it decreased CH4 emissions from dairy cows. These results provide compelling evidence that a diet supplemented with PSO can simultaneously increase CLA concentration and decrease CH4 production with no influence on the amount of milk fat (kg/day) in Holstein dairy cows.",

      "abstract": "Mutation breeding is one of the effective techniques used for improving desired traits such as yield quality and quantity in economic crops. The present study aims to develop oil and protein contents in addition to high yield attributes in soybean using gamma rays as a mutagen. Seeds of the soybean genotypes Giza 21, Giza 22, Giza 82, Giza 83 and 117 were treated with gamma rays doses 50, 100, 200 and 300 Gy. Plants were then scored based on morphological parameters correlated with yield quantity including plant height, seed weight and valuable protein and oil contents. Mutant lines exhibiting the highest yield attributes were selected and used as parents for M2 generation. The M2 progeny was further assessed based on their ability to maintain their yield attributes. Twenty mutant lines were selected and used as M3 lines. The yield parameters inferred a positive effect of gamma irradiation on the collected M3 mutant lines compared to their parental genotypes. 100 Gy of gamma rays gave the highest effect on the number of pods, branches and seeds per plant in addition to protein content, while 200 Gy was more effective in increasing plant height, number of pods per plant, and oil content. Six mutant lines scored the highest yield parameters. Further assessment inferred an inverse relationship between oil and protein content in most of the tested cultivars with high agronomic features. However, four mutant lines recorded high content of oil and protein besides their high seed yield as well, which elect them as potential candidates for large-scale evaluation. The correlation among examined parameters was further confirmed via principal component analysis (PCA), which inferred a positive correlation between the number of pods, branches, seeds, and seed weight. Conversely, oil and protein content were inversely correlated in most of yielded mutant lines. Together, those findings introduce novel soybean lines with favorable agronomic traits for the market. In addition, our research sheds light on the value of using gamma rays treatment in enhancing genetic variability in soybean and improving oil, protein contents and seed yield.",

      "abstract": "The consumption of unrefined vegetable oil poses acute and chronic health issues, yet improper disposal of waste plantain peels is not environmentally sustainable. This research investigates the feasibility, mechanism and thermodynamics of waste plantain peels, and commercial bentonite clay for soybean oil refining. Experiment was carried out using masses (1-4 g) of commercial bentonite clay, and unripe plantain peel ash (UPPA) to degummed and neutralized free fatty acid (FFA) contents in crude soybean oil at varying temperatures (50-120 °C), and time (15-35 min) for treatment of soybean oil. FTIR spectroscopy, SEM, and XRF techniques were applied to characterize the sample. The results established that at optimum 4.0 g dosage, the UPPA (97.73%) was more effective in the removal of FFA from oil at 50 °C and 20 min, while the clay (90%) was more effective in the removal of colour pigment from the vegetable oil 100 °C, and 25 min. The optimum efficiency of Clay-Ash-composite (70:30) in adsorbing pigment from soybean oil corresponds to 80%. The impact of changing viscosities, densities, and acid values on the performance of UPPA, clay, and clay-UPPA composite was investigated. Mechanistic studies confirmed the pseudo-second-order kinetics at 5 × 10-2 g/mg min-1 and 1.87 × 10-1 g/mg min-1, with corresponding adsorption capacity of 30.40 mg/g and 4.91 mg/g, at R2 ≤ 0.9982. The UPPA-driven sorption of FFA occurred as a physisorption and exothermic process (- 620.60 kJ/mol), while colour pigment removal occurred by chemisorption and endothermic process (22.40 kJ/mol). The finding recommends UPPA and composite as economically feasible for refining soybean oil.",

      "abstract": "IMPORTANCE: Critically ill pediatric patients often require parenteral nutrition (PN) in the intensive care unit (ICU). Literature suggests mixed lipid emulsions (LE) with soybean oil reduction strategies may improve outcomes. OBJECTIVE: To examine the association of a hospital-wide switch to a mixed-lipid formula (4-OLE) with pediatric outcomes. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Retrospective cohort study at a large US academic referral center. Pediatric patients aged 1 month to 17 years requiring parenteral nutrition from May 2016 to September 2019 were included. Data were analyzed from October 2020 to February 2023. EXPOSURE: In 2017, Duke University Health System fully converted to a soybean oil/MCT/olive/fish oil lipid (4-OLE) from pure soybean oil-based LE in pediatric patients. Pediatric patients before the change (Intralipid [IL] group) were compared with patients after (4-OLE group). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Clinical outcomes were compared between treatment periods via multivariable regression models. The primary outcome was hospital length of stay (LOS). Fourteen secondary outcomes included hospital mortality of any cause, 30-day or 90-day readmission, pneumonia, urinary tract infections (UTIs), total caloric delivery, and liver function tests (aspartate aminotransferase, alanine transaminase, alkaline phosphatase, and total bilirubin). RESULTS: A total of 684 children dependent on PN were identified (342 were critically ill), with 30% (206 children) in the preswitch (IL) period and 70% (478 children) in the postswitch (4-OLE) period; 123 were male (59.7%). In comparing IL vs 4-OLE, there was a significant difference in median (IQR) age (4.0 [1.2-13.0] vs 3.0 [0.8-9.0] years, respectively; P = .04), without difference in body mass index or baseline comorbidities except for significant differences in cancer diagnosis (26 patients in the IL group [12.6%] vs 29 patients in the 4-OLE group [6.1%]; P = .004) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (24 patients in the IL group [11.7%] vs 30 patients in the 4-OLE group [6.3%]; P = .02). In the all children cohort, 4-OLE was associated with shorter hospital LOS (IRR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.05-0.78), and reduced UTI risk (OR, 0.33; 95% CI, 0.18-0.64). In the ICU cohort, 4-OLE was associated with shorter hospital LOS (IRR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.78-0.83), and reduced UTI risk (OR, 0.23; 95% CI, 0.11-0.51). Other secondary outcomes were not significant. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this observational study of clinical outcomes among children dependent on PN, a switch to 4-OLE in a large academic hospital was associated with a significant decrease in hospital LOS in ICU and non-ICU patients. These findings suggest switching to a soy-LE sparing strategy using 4-OLE is feasible, safe, and associated with improved clinical outcomes in pediatric PN patients.",

This study aimed to determine whether maternal exposure to oxidized soybean oil (OSO) causes lipid metabolism disorders in the liver and whether this lipid metabolism disorder can be transmitted to offspring or even worsened. A total of 60 female Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were divided randomly into four groups in this study. Treatment groups received a pure diet of OSO with a peroxide value of 200, 400, or 800 mEqO2/kg, while the control group received fresh soybean oil (FSO). As for our results, OSO affected serum biochemical parameters in the maternal generation (F0) and induced liver histopathology changes, inflammation, and oxidative stress. Moreover, the expression of genes related to the liver X receptor α (LXRα)─sterol regulatory element binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c) signaling pathway was changed. Similar trends were found in the livers of offspring on postnatal days 21 and 56. In conclusion, exposure to OSO during gestation and lactation can affect liver lipid synthesis. Additionally, it is detrimental to the development of the offspring's liver, affecting fatty acid metabolism and causing liver damage.",

However, the role of GML in modulating intestinal health in fish has not been well determined. In this study, a 70-d feeding trial was conducted to evaluate the effect of GML on intestinal barrier, antioxidant capacity, inflammatory response and microbiota community of large yellow croaker (13.05 ± 0.09 g) fed with high level soybean oil (SO) diets. Two basic diets with fish oil (FO) or SO were formulated. Based on the SO group diet, three different levels of GML 0.02% (SO0.02), 0.04% (SO0.04) and 0.08% (SO0.08) were supplemented respectively. Results showed that intestinal villus height and perimeter ratio were increased in SO0.04 treatment compared with the SO group. The mRNA expressions of intestinal physical barrier-related gene odc and claudin-11 were significantly up-regulated in different addition of GML treatments compared with the SO group. Fish fed SO diet with 0.04% GML addition showed higher activities of acid phosphatase and lysozyme compared with the SO group. The content of malonaldehyde was significantly decreased and activities of catalase and superoxide dismutase were significantly increased in 0.02% and 0.04% GML groups compared with those in the SO group. The mRNA transcriptional levels of inflammatory response-related genes (il-1β, il-6, tnf-α and cox-2) in 0.04% GML treatment were notably lower than those in the SO group. Meanwhile, sequencing analysis of bacterial 16S rRNA V4-V5 region showed that GML addition changed gut microbiota structure and increased alpha diversity of large yellow croaker fed diets with a high level of SO. The correlation analysis results indicated that the change of intestinal microbiota relative abundance strongly correlated with intestinal health indexes. In conclusion, these results demonstrated that 0.02%-0.04% GML addition could improve intestinal morphology, physical barrier, antioxidant capacity, inflammatory response and microbiota dysbiosis of large yellow croaker fed diets with a high percentage of SO.",

      "abstract": "Blending of polymers can enhance performance of plastics and can give the opportunity to broaden the application fields. Especially the brittleness of poly(lactic acid) (PLA) is an issue, that is often addressed by blending it with soft polymers like poly(butylene adipate terephthalate) (PBAT). The immiscibility of those two polymers leads to limited properties of the blend. This study aimed to examine the application of electron-beam treatment with the implementation of a compatibilizing agent. PLA and PBAT were compounded with the addition of epoxidized soybean oil (ESBO) in different ratios and extruded into flat films. These were treated with electron beams at irradiation doses ranging from 12.5 to 100 kGy. The films thus produced were characterized by differential scanning calorimetry, size exclusion chromatography, scanning electron microscopy and tensile testing. A significant change in the glass transition temperatures of the blend partners was observed, as well as a substantial increase in elongation at break, even in PLA-rich compositions. These findings indicate improved compatibilization. Furthermore, the use of epoxidized soybean oil showed a changed extraction behavior of PBAT, indicating a formed binding to PLA. The results show that electron-beam treatment can significantly improve the compatibility between different polymers in blends, leading to enhanced mechanical and thermal properties."

The pH 11.0-SOB comprised oleosins, whereas pH 7.0-SOB comprised extrinsic proteins and oleosins. All SOB emulsions were heated at 60-100 °C for 15 min. Heating may lead to the release of extrinsic proteins from the surface of pH 7.0-SOB due to heat-induced denaturation. The total proportion of α-helix and β-sheets gradually decreased from 77 (unheated) to 36.2% (100 °C). During stomach digestion, the extrinsic protein hydrolysis of heated pH 7.0-SOB emulsions was fast between 60 and 80 °C, and it then slowed between 90 and 100 °C; heating inhibited the oleosin hydrolysis of pH 7.0- and 11.0-SOBs. Heat treatment promoted aggregation and coalescence, and it resulted in increased particle sizes for all emulsions. Larger aggregates were found in heated pH 7.0-SOB emulsions, and larger oil droplets were found in heated pH 11.0-SOB emulsions. After intestinal digestion, the droplets of all SOB emulsions gradually dispersed, and particle sizes decreased. Different heating temperatures had lesser effects on particle sizes and microstructures. Lipolysis was affected by the extraction pH and heating. For pH 11.0-SOB emulsions, the FFA release tendency was greatly affected by the heating temperature, and heating to 80 °C resulted in the highest FFA release (74%). However, all pH 7.0-SOB emulsions had similar total FFA releases. In addition, the droplet charges of heated pH 7.0-SOB emulsions were lower than those of unheated pH 7.0-SOB emulsions in both the intestine and stomach phases; however, the charge changes in different pH 11.0-SOB emulsions showed the opposite tendency. This study will offer guidance regarding the application of SOB emulsions in food."

      "abstract": "In this study, we investigated the inhibitory effects of three soybean isoflavones and two soybean phytosterols on the formation of 3-chloropropane-1,2-diol fatty acid esters (3-MCPDE) and aldehydes in heated soybean oil model. 0.4 mM of genistin, genistein, daidzein, stigmasterol, and β-sitosterol significantly reduced 3-MCPDE formation by 25.7, 51.4, 21.4, 61.6, and 55.7%, and total aldehydes formation by 42.03, 43.94, 28.36, 54.74, and 39.23%, respectively. Further study showed that stigmasterol reduced the content of glycidyl esters (GEs) and glycidol, two key intermediates of 3-MCPDE, and prevented fatty acids degradation in the oils. Moreover, the effects of continuous frying time on the content of stigmasterol and the migration of stigmasterol were evaluated in the fried dough sticks model system. The content of stigmasterol in soybean oil was found to be significantly decreased with prolonged heating time. The concentrations of stigmasterol in fried dough sticks and the migration rates of stigmasterol from soybean oil to fried dough sticks decreased with repeated frying sessions. In addition, stigmasterol undergoes oxidative changes during heat treatment, and the oxidation products including 5,6α-epoxystigmasterol, 5,6β-epoxystigmasterol, 7α-hydroxystigmasterol, 7β-hydroxystigmasterol, stigmasterlol-3β,5α,6β-triol, and 7-ketostigmasterol were identified in the frying oils but not in the fried dough sticks. Overall, stigmasterol could be added to soybean oil to reduce 3-MCPDE and aldehydes formation, and reacting with GEs/glycidol and protection of lipid acids from oxidation may be the mechanism of action of stigmasterol.",

      "abstract": "Lard has been consumed by humans for thousands of years, but its consumption has declined substantially in the last few decades, because of negative publicity about the consumption of animal-derived saturated fats. Emerging evidence highlights that lard plus soybean oil (blend oil) could be more beneficial for body weight and liver function than the individual use of the two oils. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of blend oil on cardiometabolic risk factors in healthy subjects. This was a parallel, three-arm, randomized controlled-feeding trial. 334 healthy subjects (mean age: 33.1 years, 60% women) were randomized into three isoenergetic diet groups with three different edible oils (30 g day-1) (soybean oil, lard, and blend oil [50% lard and 50% soybean oil]) for 12 weeks. 245 (73.4%) participants completed the study. After the 12-week intervention, reductions in both systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) were greater in the blend oil group than in the other two groups (P = 0.023 and 0.008 for the interaction between the diet group and time, respectively). Reductions of SBP and DBP in the blend oil group were more significant than those in the soybean oil group with P = 0.008 and P = 0.026 and the lard group with P < 0.001 and P < 0.001. Changes in SBP/DBP at 12 weeks were -6.0 (95% CI: -8.6 to -3.4)/0.8 (95% CI: -1.7 to 3.2) mmHg in the blend oil group, -3.3 (95% CI: -5.7 to -0.9)/1.5 (95% CI: -1.0 to 4.0) mmHg in the soybean oil group and -1.2 (95% CI: -3.7 to 1.4)/3.3 (95% CI: 0.9 to 5.8) mmHg in the lard group. Subgroup analyses showed that blend oil significantly decreased SBP and DBP compared with the other two groups in participants with BP ≥ 130/80 mmHg and body mass index ≥25. There were no significant differences in the changes in body weight, waist circumference, serum lipids, or glucose between groups. In conclusion, our findings suggest that blend oil (lard plus soybean oil) reduces BP compared with soybean oil and lard in healthy subjects."

The oil sample was treated for 13 h using SDBDCP at 15 kV with 100% hydrogen gas under room temperature and atmospheric pressure. Fatty acid composition, iodine value, refractive index, carotenoid content, melting point, peroxide value, and free fatty acids content (FFA) were investigated during SDBDCP treatment. Analysis of fatty acid composition demonstrated an increase in the content of saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids (from 41.32% to 55.3%) and a decrease in the content of polyunsaturated fatty acids (from 58.62% to 40.98%), which resulted in a reduction of the iodine value to 98.49 over the treatment time. Also, the fatty acid profile indicated that the total detected level of trans-fatty acids was very low (0.79%). After a 13-h treatment, the samples showed a refractive index of 1.4637, melting point of 10 °C, peroxide value of 4.1 meq/kg, and FFA content of 0.8%. In addition, the results revealed a 71% decline in the carotenoid content of the oil sample due to the saturation of their double bonds. Therefore, these findings suggest that SDBDCP can be effectively used for hydrogenation along with bleaching oil.",

This study aimed to identify immune-related proteins in the liver tissue of fish fed a FO-based or soybean oil (SO)-based diet. By conducting proteomics and phosphoproteomics analyses, a total of 1601 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) and 460 differentially abundant phosphorylated proteins (DAPs) were identified, respectively. Enrichment analysis revealed immune-related proteins involved in bacterial infection, pathogen identification, cytokine production, and cell chemotaxis. The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway exhibited significant alterations in both protein and phosphorylation levels, with several hub DEPs and DAPs associated with MAPK pathway and leukocyte transendothelial migration being notable. In vitro experiments indicated that linolenic acid (LNA), derived from SO, inhibited the expression of NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), but increased the expression of signaling proteins linked to nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) and MAPK pathways. Transwell assays indicated that treatment of liver cells with LNA promoted macrophage migration. Collectively, the results showed that the SO-based diet upregulated the expression of NF-κB signaling-related proteins and activated the MAPK pathway, promoting immune cell migration. These findings provide novel insights for developing effective solutions to alleviate health problems caused by dietary high levels of SO inclusion.",

However, a series of frequently-used ultrasonic set-ups mainly suffered from a low ultrasonic energy efficiency caused by the large acoustic impedance and energy consumption, subordinately confronted with a low throughput, complicated fabrication with complex structure and weak ultrasonic cavitation. Herein, we employed a typical ultrasonic microreactor (USMR) that ensured the high-efficient energy input and generated intense cavitation behavior for efficient breakage of droplets and continuous production of unified oil-in-water (O/W) nanoemulsions in a single cycle and without any pre-emulsification treatment. The emulsification was optimized by tuning the formula indexes, technological parameters, and numerical analysis using Response Surface Methodology (RSM), followed by a comparison with the emulsification by a traditional ultrasonic probe. The USMR exhibited superior emulsification efficiency and easy scale-up with remarkable uniformity by series mode. In addition, concurrent and uniform nanoemulsions with high throughput could also be achieved by a larger USMR with high ultrasonic power. Based on RSM analysis, uniform DS and PDI of 96.4 nm and 0.195 were observed under the optimal conditions, respectively, well consistent with the predicted values. Impressively, the optimal nanoemulsions have a uniform spherical morphology and exhibited superior stability, which held well in 45 days at 4℃ and 25℃. The results in the present work may provide a typical paradigm for the preparation of functional nanomaterials based on the novel and efficient emulsification tools."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Ultrasound is widely used as a novel non-thermal processing technique to improve protein properties. In recent decades, applying ultrasound-assisted emulsification (UAE) to produce protein-stabilized emulsion has attracted people's attention. Instead of applying ultrasound to treat a single protein solution, UAE treatment refers to the use of sonication to a mixture of protein and oil. The purpose of this study was to compare the different effects of ultrasound treatment on the properties of myofibrillar protein (MP) in the presence or absence of soybean oil. A suitable sonication power was selected based on the change in emulsion properties. RESULTS: 300 W sonication power was selected because of its most effectively decreased emulsion droplet size and increased absolute zeta potential. Sonication more significantly increased the protein carbonyl content and disulfide bonds of the MP-soybean oil sample compared with the MP sample. Due to the presence of oil, ultrasound could unfold more protein molecules, illustrated by a lower α-helix content and intrinsic fluorescence intensity, and a higher surface hydrophobicity. Results of liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry illustrated that sonication enhanced the myosin heavy chain and actin content at the soybean oil interface as well as accelerated the myosin light chain to separate from myosin in the MP-soybean oil system. CONCLUSION: Ultrasound treatment could lead to a higher level of protein oxidation and greater protein molecule exposure in the MP in the presence of oil system than in the oil-free MP system. © 2023 Society of Chemical Industry.",

Participants (N = 10, 63 ± 8 y, BMI, 26.2 ± 4.2 kg/m2, LDL-C, 3.9 ± 0.5 mmol/L) were provided with diets enriched in soybean oil (SO) and partially-hydrogenated soybean oil (PHSO). Plasma metabolite concentrations were determined using an untargeted approach and pathway analysis using LIPIDMAPS. Data were assessed using a volcano plot, receiver operating characteristics curve, partial least square-discrimination analysis and Pearson correlations. Among the known metabolites higher in plasma after the PHSO diet than the SO diet, the majority were phospholipids (53%) and di- and triglycerides (DG/TG, 34%). Pathway analysis indicated upregulation of phosphatidylcholine synthesis from DG and phosphatidylethanolamine. We identified seven metabolites (TG_56:9, TG_54:8, TG_54:7, TG_54:6, TG_48:5, DG_36:5 and benproperine) as potential biomarkers for PHSO intake. These data indicate that TG-related metabolites were the most affected lipid species, and glycerophospholipid biosynthesis was the most active pathway in response to PHSO compared to SO intake."

Recent evidence suggests important roles for resveratrol (RES) in the promoting growth performance, antioxidant capacity, anti-inflammatory, and regulate intestinal barriers in animals. Therefore, The objectives of this study are to investigate the effects of dietary RES (purity 98%) supplementation on the growth performance, antioxidant capacity, inflammatory state, and intestinal function of weaned piglets challenged with OSO. METHODS: A total of 28 castrated weaned male piglets with a similar body weight of 10.19 ± 0.10 kg were randomly assigned to 4 dietary treatments for 28-d feeding trial with 7 replications per treatment and 1 piglet per replicate. Treatments were arranged as a 2 × 2 factorial with oil type [3% fresh soybean oil (FSO) vs. 3% OSO] and dietary RES (0 vs. 300 mg/kg). RESULTS: The results showed that relative to the FSO group, OSO stress tended to decrease the average daily feed intake (ADFI), and decreased the activity levels of lipase, villus/crypt ratio (VCR), the mRNA expression of FABP1, SOD2, IL-10 and ZO-1 in the jejunum, and SOD2, GPX1, occludin and ZO-1 in the colon, the levels of acetic acid in the colonic digesta, whereas up-regulated the mRNA expression of IL-1β and TNF-α in the jejunum (P < 0.05). Moreover, dietary supplementation with RES increased ether extract (EE), the activity levels of sucrase, lipase, α-amylase, villus height (VH) and VCR, the mRNA expression of FABP1, SOD2, IL-10 and occludin in the jejunum, and FABP1, PPAR-γ, GPX1, occludin and ZO-1 in the colon, and the abundance of Firmicutes, acetic and propionic acid, but decreased the levels of D-lactic acid in the plasma, the abundance of Bacteroidetes in the colonic digesta of weaned piglets compared to the non-RES group (P < 0.05). Meanwhile, in the interaction effect analysis, relative to the OSO group, dietary RES supplementation in the diets supplemented with OSO increased the activity levels of trypsin, VH in the jejunum, the abundance of Actinobacteria, the levels of butyric acid of weaned piglets, but failed to influence the activity levels of trypsin and VH, Actinobacteria abundance, the levels of butyric acid when diets were supplemented with FSO (interaction, P < 0.05). Relative to the OSO group, dietary RES supplementation in the diets supplemented with OSO decreased the activity levels of DAO in the plasma of weaned piglets but failed to influence the activity levels of DAO when diets were supplemented with FSO (interaction, P < 0.05). Relative to the FSO group, dietary RES supplementation in the diets supplemented with FSO decreased the level of propionic acid, whereas RES supplementation failed to influence the level of propionic acid when the diet was supplemented with OSO (interaction, P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Inclusion of OSO intensified inflammatory states and impaired the intestinal health characteristics of weaned piglets. Dietary RES supplementation improved the antioxidant capacity, anti-inflammatory activity, and intestinal morphology. Further studies showed that the protective effects of RES on gut health could be linked to the decreased abundance of Prevotella_1, Clostridium_sensu_stricto_6, and Prevotellaceae_UCG003 and increased levels of acetic and propionic acid."

      "abstract": "This experiment evaluated reproductive and productive responses of beef cows receiving self-fed low-moisture blocks (LMB) enriched or not with Ca salts of soybean oil (CSSO) throughout the breeding season. Non-pregnant, suckled multiparous Angus-influenced cows were assigned to a fixed-time artificial insemination (AI) protocol (day -10 to 0) followed by natural service (day 15-70). Cows were managed in 12 groups (46 ± 4 cows/group) maintained in individual pastures, and groups received LMB enriched with 25 % (as-fed basis) of CSSO or ground corn (CON) from day - 10 to 100. Both treatments were designed to yield a daily LMB intake of 0.454 kg/cow (as-fed basis). Cows receiving CSSO had greater (P < 0.01) mean concentrations of ω-6 fatty acids in plasma samples collected on days 0 and 55. Cows receiving CSSO had greater (P = 0.05) pregnancy rate to fixed-time AI (67.2 vs. 59.3 %), whereas final pregnancy rate did not differ (P = 0.92) between treatments. Pregnancy loss was less (P = 0.03) in CSSO cows (4.50 vs. 9.04 %), which also calved earlier during the calving season (treatment × week; P = 0.04). Weaning rate tended to be greater (P = 0.09) in CSSO (84.8 vs. 79.4 %), although calf weaning age and weight did not differ (P ≥ 0.72) between treatments. Kilos of calf weaned/cow exposed was greater (P = 0.04) in CSSO cows (234 vs. 215 kg). Therefore, supplementing CSSO to beef cows via LMB during the breeding season improved their reproductive and overall productivity during a cow-calf cycle.",

      "abstract": "Fried foods and frying oil are subjects that warrant the attention of researchers because of their high consumption. Indeed, frying conditions make these oils very sensitive to lipid oxidation which deteriorates the quality and nutritional properties of the food. In this study, we examined the effect of rosemary extract (ROE), known for its high antioxidant activity, in soybean oil used to fry breaded butterfly shrimp, by measuring the induction period with OXIPRES, total polar material (TPM), peroxide index (PI), and free fatty acids (FFA). This evaluation was performed in comparison with control oils without antioxidants. The results showed a significant difference between the oils according to the analyzed parameters, especially in the final hours of frying. The treatment of the oil with rosemary extract effectively delayed its oxidation, having lower levels in all the oxidation markers that were analyzed. It was also found that rosemary extract is able to reduce oil consumption by fried foods. Therefore, ROE ensures soybean oil a high stability against oxidation and a longer shelf life, making it a good natural alternative to synthetic antioxidants."

Average daily feed intake (ADFI), final live weight (FLW), average daily gain (ADG), feed efficiency (FE), carcass characteristics, cardio-pulmonary morphometry, fatty acid profile of the breast muscle and cost-benefit analysis were measured. Results indicated that animal protein significantly increased 4.27% FLW, 6.13% ADFI, 4.31% ADG and 2.93% wing weight. Accordingly, soybean oil increased 4.76% FLW, 3.80% ADG and 1.36% dressing percentage at the expense of 12.07% proventriculus weight compared with sunflower oil. The generalized linear model identified no interaction effects of the sources of protein and energy on overall performance of the birds. Replacement of vegetable protein by animal protein decreased 14.01% ∑ω-3, 12.16% ∑ω-6 and 12.21% sum of polyunsaturated fatty acids (∑PUFA) and concomitantly increased 10.82% sum of saturated fatty acids (∑SFAs) in the breast muscle (Pectoralis major). Accordingly, replacement of sunflower oil by soybean oil decreased 29.17% ∑ω-3, 6.71% ∑ω-6, 11.62% sum of monounsaturated fatty acids (∑MUFAs) and 7.33% ∑PUFAs and concurrently increased 18.36% ∑SFAs in the breast muscle of the broiler birds.

In EXP 1, 32 pigs (7.14 kg body weight, BW) were placed individually into pens and fed diets containing either 12% SDEW, 6% TP-SDEW plus 6% SDEW, or 12% TP-SDEW. Performance was measured at the end of the 24-d feeding period with biological samples harvested following euthanasia. In EXP 2, 64 pigs (10.6 kg BW) were placed individually into pens and fed diets containing 7.5% soybean oil or PSO, 10% SDEW or TP-SDEW, and diets without or with 3 mg 15-ADON/kg diet in a 2 × 2 × 2 factorial arrangement. Performance was measured at the end of the 28-d feeding period with biological samples harvested following euthanasia. In EXP 1, dietary treatment did not affect pig performance, apparent ileal digestibility of amino acids (AAs), apparent total tract digestibility (ATTD) of gross energy (GE) or nitrogen (N), ileal crypt depth, or villi height:crypt depth ratio (P > 0.05). The effects of feeding TP-SDEW on protein damage in the plasma and liver (P < 0.05) were variable. In EXP 2, there were no three-way interactions and only one two-way interactions among dietary treatments on parameters evaluated. There was no effect of feeding TP-SDEW on ATTD of GE or N, intestinal morphology, or on oxidative markers in the plasma, liver, or ileum (P > 0.05). There was no effect of feeding diets containing added 15-ADON on ATTD of GE, ileal AA digestibility, intestinal morphology, oxidative markers in the plasma, liver, or ileum, or pig performance (P > 0.05). Feeding pigs diets containing PSO resulted in reduced ATTD of GE and N, plasma vitamin E concentration, and pig performance (P < 0.01) but did not affect intestinal morphology or oxidative markers in the liver or ileum (P > 0.05). In conclusion, it was difficult to induce protein oxidation in SDEW and when achieved there were limited effects on performance, digestibility, intestinal morphology, and oxidative status. Furthermore, singly adding 15-A-DON to a diet had no effect on the animal. At last, adding PSO reduces animal performance, but has limited effect on digestibility, intestinal morphology, and oxidative status in nursery pigs.",

METHODS: In this study, the effects of different MD addition ratios [OBs: MD = 1:0, 1:0.5, 1:1, 1:1.5, and 1:2 (v/v)] on the physicochemical properties and oxidative stability of freeze-dried soybean OBs microcapsules were investigated. The effect of ultrasonic power (150-250 W) on the encapsulation effect and structural properties of oil body-maltodextrin (OB-MD) microcapsules were studied. RESULTS: The addition of MD to OBs decreased the surface oil content and improved the encapsulation efficiency and oxidative stability of OBs. Scanning electron microscopy images revealed that the sonication promoted the adsorption of MD on the surface of OBs, forming a rugged spherical structure. The oil-body-maltodextrin (OB-MD) microcapsules showed a narrower particle size distribution and a lower-potential absolute value at an MD addition ratio of 1:1.5 and ultrasonic power of 250 W (32.1 mV). At this time, MD-encapsulated OBs particles had the highest encapsulation efficiency of 85.3%. Ultrasonic treatment improved encapsulation efficiency of OBs and increased wettability and emulsifying properties of MD. The encapsulation of OBs by MD was improved, and its oxidative stability was enhanced by ultrasound treatment, showing a lower hydrogen peroxide value (3.35 meq peroxide/kg) and thiobarbituric acid value (1.65 μmol/kg). DISCUSSION: This study showed that the encapsulation of soybean OBs by MD improved the stability of OBs microcapsules and decreased the degree of lipid oxidation during storage. Ultrasonic pretreatment further improved the encapsulation efficiency of MD on soybean OBs, and significantly enhanced its physicochemical properties and oxidative stability."

In this study, a monoacylglycerol lipase GMGL was derived from marine Geobacillus sp., and was found that not only took monoacylglycerol (MAG) as substrate, but also had activity toward lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC), lysophosphatidylethanolamine (LPE) and glycerolphosphatidylcholine (GPC). Binding free energy showed LPC and LPE could bind with enzyme stably as MAG. It presented great potential in the field of enzymatic degumming. The phosphorus content in crude soybean oil decreased from 680.50 to 2.01 mg/kg and the yield of oil reached to 98.80 % after treating with phospholipase A1 (Lecitase Ultra) combined with lipase GMGL. An ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-Q-TOF-MS) was developed to identify 21 differential phospholipids between crude soybean oil and enzymatic treatment. This work might shed some light on understanding the catalytic mechanism of monoacylglycerol lipase and provide an effective strategy for enzymatic degumming.",

We hypothesized that the use of MO-IFE would be independently associated with reduced infection rates compared with SO-IFE. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: Tertiary referral children's hospital and its associated gastrointestinal rehabilitation clinic (01 January, 2015-31 July, 2019). PATIENTS: Days of IFE exposure were counted for patients aged <18 years on IFE initiated during the review period, who had a central venous catheter (CVC) placed for PN administration, received IFE at least three times weekly, and for at least 7 days. MEASUREMENTS: The primary outcome included total and categorical CR-BSI rates expressed as the average with standard error (SE) number of infections per 1000 fat emulsion days. The following categories were specified: Candida albicans, non-albicans Candida spp., coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (CoNS), Enterobacterales, methicillin-resistant S. aureus, methicillin-susceptible S. aureus, and Pseudomonadales. Average infection rate comparisons were quantified as incidence rate ratios (IRR) using generalized linear mixed modeling with a Poisson distribution. MAIN RESULTS: Seven hundred and forty-three SO-IFE and 450 MO-IFE exposures were reviewed from 1131 patients, totaling 37,599 and 19,796 days of therapy, respectively. From those found significantly different, the average rate of infections with CoNS was 3.58 (SE 0.5)/1000 days of SO-IFE and 1.39 (SE 0.45)/1000 days of MO-IFE (IRR [95% confidence interval, CI]: 0.27 [0.16-0.46]; p < 0.01). Total average rates of infection were 7.33 (SE 0.76)/1000 days of SO-IFE and 4.52 (SE 0.75)/1000 days of MO-IFE (IRR [95% CI]: 0.60 [0.44-0.81]; p < 0.01). Other factors associated with higher infection rates include female gender, neonatal age, and inpatient-only IFE exposure. CONCLUSIONS: Receipt of MO-IFE was associated with lower rates of CoNS and total CR-BSIs compared with SO-IFE in pediatric patients. These findings could have major implications on IFE selection for pediatric patients receiving PN.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Early data suggest use of a mixed lipid emulsion (LE) with a soybean oil reduction strategy in parenteral nutrition (PN) may improve clinical outcomes. Duke University Hospital made a full switch to a Soybean oil/MCT/Olive/Fish Oil lipid (4-OLE) from pure soybean oil-based LE (Intralipid, Baxter Inc) in May 2017. Since 4-OLE has limited evidence related to its effects on clinical outcome parameters in US hospitals, evidence for clinical benefits of switching to 4-OLE is needed. Therefore, we examined the clinical utility of a hospital-wide switch to 4-OLE and its effect on patient outcomes. METHODS: We conducted a single-center retrospective cohort study among adult patients (> 18 years) requiring PN from 2016 to 2019. Our primary exposure was treatment period (1-year pre-4-OLE switch versus 2-year post). We used multivariable regression models to examine our primary outcomes, the association of treatment period with hospital length of stay (LOS), and secondary outcomes liver function, infections, and ICU LOS. Analyses were stratified into critically ill and entire adult cohort. RESULTS: We identified 1200 adults hospitalized patients. 28% of PN patients (n = 341) were treated pre-4-OLE switch and 72% post-4-OLE (n = 859). In the adult cohort, 4-OLE was associated with shorter hospital LOS (IRR 0.97, 95% CI 0.95-0.99, p = 0.039). The ICU cohort included 447 subjects, of which 25% (n = 110) were treated pre-4-OLE switch and 75% (n = 337) were post-switch. ICU patients receiving 4-OLE were associated with shorter hospital LOS (IRR 0.91, 95% CI 0.87-0.93, p < 0.0001), as well as a shorter ICU LOS (IRR 0.90, 95% CI 0.82-0.99, p = 0.036). 4-OLE ICU patients also had a significantly lower delta total bilirubin (- 1.6, 95% CI - 2.8 to - 0.2, p = 0.021) and reduced urinary tract infection (UTI) rates (OR 0.50, 95% CI 0.26-0.96, p = 0.038). There were no associations in AST, ALT, or total bilirubin in ICU and all adult patients. CONCLUSION: 4-OLE was successfully implemented and reduced soybean oil LE exposure in a large academic hospital setting. The introduction of 4-OLE was associated with reduced LOS, UTI rates, and mitigated hepatic dysfunction in critically ill patients. Overall, these findings prove a switch to a soybean oil-LE sparing strategy using 4-OLE is feasible and safe and is associated with improved clinical outcomes in adult PN patients.",

In this study, we aimed to optimize the effects of different sumac (Rhus coriaria) fruit extracts (SFE) on oxidative stability of soybean oil under accelerated conditions compared to a synthetic antioxidant. Hydro-ethanolic extracts (70%) of sumac fruits were prepared by three methods of immersion (I-SFE), ultrasound (U-SFE), and microwave (M-SFE). According to the response surface methodology (RSM), 13 runs were considered in the concentrations of 0, 500, and 1000 ppm of each extract that were added to the soybean oil and stored at 60°C for a 20-day period. All of the treatments were significantly (p < .05) efficient in preventing the chemical and sensory changes of soybean oil compared to the control in the dose-dependent manner during storage period. I-SFE treatment showed the lowest peroxide value (PV) (0.000063 meq (milliequivalents) O2/kg oil), thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) (115.06 MDA (malondialdehyde)/kg oil), and acid value (0.0169 mg KOH (potassium hydroxide)/kg oil) among the other extracts at the end of the storage period. Furthermore, I-SFE treatment earned the highest sensory scores (flavor, color, odor, and overall acceptability) of soybean oil in the range of 4-5 in comparison to the other treatments and synthetic antioxidant during storage time. According to the analysis of RSM, I-SFE in the concentration of 999.998 ppm could optimally enhance the shelf life of soybean oil for 11.3614 days under accelerated conditions. It was concluded that I-SFE with the same efficiency as synthetic antioxidants can be considered as a suitable alternative in soybean oil with various health benefits."

Consumption of oxidized oils can adversely affect the animal organism and even the offspring. This study investigated the impact of oxidized soybean oil in the diets of sows from 107 days gestation to 21 days of lactation on the performance of sows and jejunum health of suckling piglets. Sixteen sows were randomly allocated into two groups: one group (n = 8) was fed with the fresh soybean oil (FSO) diet, and another group (n = 8) was treated with the oxidized soybean oil (OSO) diet. Dietary oxidized soybean oil does not affect sow performance. Antioxidant enzyme activity in the milk was reduced significantly in the OSO group, such as the superoxide dismutase (SOD), total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC), and catalase (CAT) activities (p < 0.05). On Day 21, oxidized soybean oil increased tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin 6 (IL-6), and interleukin 8 (IL-8) levels in sow milk and the concentrations of TNF-α and IL-8 cytokines in plasma (p < 0.05). Suckling piglets from sows fed on OSO showed a trend towards increased IL-6 and TNF-α in plasma (p < 0.1). The mRNA expression of interleukin 1β (IL-1β) was augmented, whereas interleukin 10 (IL-10) was decreased, and zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) had a tendency to be down-regulated in OSO treatment. This study revealed that the OSO of feed decreased the antioxidant capacity of milk, further contributing to the inflammatory response in the jejunum of suckling piglets.",

      "abstract": "Feeding growing-finishing pigs supplemental fat is a common practice in the swine industry and can result in improved feed efficiency and reduced feed intake; however, dietary lipids also play a key role in determining pork quality. Objectives of the study were to evaluate the effects of feeding graded levels of high oleic soybean oil (HOSO) on loin and belly quality. A total of 288 pig raised in two separate blocks (144 pigs each) were assigned to one of four diets containing either 25% dried distiller's grains with solubles (DDGS), 2% high oleic soybean oil (HOSO2), 4% high oleic soybean oil (HOSO4), or 6% high oleic soybean oil (HOSO6). Following the conclusion of the feeding trial, 144 pigs were slaughtered at the University of Illinois Meat Science Laboratory. Following fabrication, loins were collected for the evaluation of fresh quality measurements and color stability. Belly quality and fatty acid composition were evaluated using skin-on natural fall bellies. There were no differences (P ≥ 0.11) in pH, visual color, lightness (L*), drip loss, or WBSF among dietary treatments. However, visual marbling was increased (P ≤ 0.01) in loin chops from pigs fed HOSO4 and HOSO6 treatments compared with chops from pigs fed the DDGS dietary treatment. Additionally, loin chops were more red (a*) (P ≤ 0.01) from pigs fed HOSO diets when compared with pigs fed DDGS. Extractable lipid was decreased (P ≤ 0.01) in fresh loin chops from pigs fed DDGS and HOSO2 diets compared with pigs fed HOSO6. There were no differences (P ≥ 0.75) in trained sensory tenderness, juiciness, or flavor for loin chops from pigs fed different dietary treatments. Pork fatty acid composition was altered by dietary HOSO inclusion, with pigs fed DDGS having (P ≤ 0.01) the greatest concentration of C16:0 and was decreased with increasing levels of HOSO inclusion. Inversely, the percentage of C18:1n-9 was least (P ≤ 0.01) in pigs fed DDGS and increased with increasing levels of HOSO inclusion. Pigs fed DDGS produced wider (P ≤ 0.03) and thinner (P ≤ 0.04) bellies with reduced flop distance compared with pigs fed HOSO diets. Overall, HOSO diets did not negatively affect fresh loin quality or sensory traits of loin chops. Furthermore, feeding HOSO to swine resulted in bellies containing greater percentages of oleic acid and reduced percentages of palmitic and linoleic acid.",

However, the specific role of octanoate in repairing intestinal health impairment is currently unknown. Therefore, we investigated whether dietary octanoate repaired the intestinal damage induced by surplus soybean oil in Larimichthys crocea. In this study, dietary octanoate alleviated abnormal morphology of the intestine and enhanced expression of ZO-1 and ZO-2 to improve intestinal physical barrier. Further, dietary octanoate increased antioxidant enzymic activities and decreased the level of ROS to alleviate the intestinal oxidative stress. Dietary octanoate also attenuated the expression of proinflammatory cytokines and the polarity of macrophage to reduce the intestinal inflammatory response. Moreover, the result of intestinal microbial 16S rRNA sequence showed that dietary octanoate repaired the intestinal mucosal microbial dysbiosis, and increased the relative abundance of Lactobacillus. Dietary octanoate supplementation also increased the level of acetic acid in intestinal content and serum through increasing the abundance of acetate-producing strains. Overall, in Larimichthys crocea, dietary octanoate might alleviated oxidative stress, inflammatory response and microbial dysbiosis to repair the intestinal damage induced by surplus soybean oil. This work provides vital insights into the underlying mechanisms and treatment strategies for intestinal damage in vertebrates.",

Then, the spinosad-loaded microcapsules (SSD@CMCS-g-ESO) were prepared by ultrasonic self-assembly method. The results showed that TAS could catalyze the ring opening reaction of CMCS and ESO under UV-irradiation and the optimum reaction time was 1 h, with the molecular weight of 15,745. The average particle size of SSD@CMCS-g-ESO was about 2.16 μm, and the encapsulation efficiency (EE) and drug loading content (LC) of SSD@CMCS-g-ESO were 85.39 ± 2.05% and 20.17 ± 1.84%, respectively. In vitro release revealed that SSD@CMCS-g-ESO exhibited sustained-release and pH-responsive property, and the accumulative release in the buffer solution of pH = 6.5 and 7.4 was higher than in pH = 9.0. Furthermore, SSD@CMCS-g-ESO had a good antifungal properties against Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cubense (Foc) compared with the unencapsulated SSD at the same drug dose.

      "abstract": "Trichosporon fermentans can be used to treat refined soybean oil wastewater (RSOW) and produce microbial lipids. Bioflocculation is an effective method to recover Trichosporon fermentans which accumulates intracellular oils from wastewater. During the flocculation, the hydrodynamic distribution and parameters in the reactor are important limiting factors of yeast flocculation performance. In a 0.25 L flocculation device, it was found that the appropriate range of turbulence kinetic energy was within 0.00065-0.00073 m2/s2, the dissipation rate was within 0.119-0.317 m2/s3, and the shear force was less than 0.433 Pa by computational fluid dynamics. In this case, the flocculation rate (Fr) of Trichosporon fermentans could reach more than 90%. The empirical formula associated Fr of Trichosporon fermentans with hydrodynamic parameters was obtained by Matlab, and improved in the enlargement of flocculation device, displaying an error of less than 3.03%. A conical draft tube airlift circulating reactor for flocculation was designed based on the empirical formula, and the Fr reached 91.3%. The study shows that it is feasible to predict Fr of Trichosporon fermentans according to hydrodynamic parameters by numerical simulation, and design the industrial reactor for flocculation harvesting yeasts. It is also helpful for large-scale treatment of RSOW in a safe environment.",

However, research that directly compares the effects of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) and monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) is rare. The present 3-month, three-arm, randomized, controlled-feeding trial aimed to investigate the effects of n-6 PUFA- and MUFA-rich cooking oils on body weight and cardiometabolic profiles among middle-aged and elderly Chinese women at high cardiovascular risk. Ninety participants were recruited and randomly assigned to groups fed diets using n-6 PUFA-rich soybean oil (SO, n = 30), MUFA-rich olive oil (OO, n = 30), and MUFA-rich camellia seed oil (CSO, n = 30) as cooking oils considering traditional Chinese eating habits for 3 months. Participants were required to eat only the foods provided for lunch and dinner, and avoid intake of edible oils in breakfast. Body weight and cardiovascular profiles were measured at the baseline, middle, and end of the intervention, and group differences in changes of outcomes during intervention were examined by a linear mixed model. We found no significant difference in the changes of body weight among the SO group (mean change, 0.31 kg; 95% CI, -0.88 to 0.27), the OO group (mean change, -0.13 kg; 95% CI, -0.62 to 0.36), and the CSO group (mean change, -0.72 kg; 95% CI, -1.38 to -0.07). For secondary outcomes, the OO group showed a slight increase in HDL cholesterol (P = 0.03), while the CSO group showed greater reduction in aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (P = 0.02) when compared with the SO group. These results suggested that MUFA-rich OO and CSO exerted more favorable effects on cardiometabolic profiles among middle-aged and elderly Chinese women at high cardiovascular risk than the n-6 PUFA-rich SO.",

The suitability of soybean oil for specific uses is determined by the fatty acid composition from which a number of indices and indicators can be calculated. The aim of this study was to evaluate the indices of nutritional and health-promoting fat in seeds of soybean cultivars grown in 2016-2019 under the influence of varying doses of N and inoculation with Bradyrhizobium japonicum. Omega 3 and Omega 6, unsaturated fatty acids (UFA), saturated fatty acids (SFA), polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), index of desirable fatty acids (DFA), sum of hypercholesterolemic fatty acids (OFA), index of atherogenicity (AI), index of thrombogenicity (TI), oleic desaturation ratio (ODR), linoleic desaturation ratio (LDR), calculated oxidizability value (COX) and the hypocholesterolemic/hypercholesterolemic ratio (HH), saturation fat index (S/P) and ALA/LA, OL/(LA+ALA) ratios and the consumer index (CI) were included. Fat quality indices for soybean seeds were strongly determined by weather conditions. Seeds of the cv. Aldana contained higher amounts of Omega 6 and featured more favourable MUFA/PUFA and OL/(LA+ALA) ratios, while the seeds of the cv. Annushka had more favourable CI and higher ODR, COX and S/P indices. No important differences were observed regarding the effect of nitrogen dose and seed inoculation on the formation of the DFA, OFA, HH, AI, TI and CI indices. The value of the S/P index suggests that higher nitrogen rates (60 kg∙ha-1) and the lack of inoculation treatment produce seeds with a more favourable dietary fatty acid balance."

Pigs were housed 4 per pen and fed for 98 d using a 3-phase feeding system. Pigs were individually weighed and feed intake was recorded throughout the trial to calculate average daily feed intake (ADFI) and gain to feed ratio (G:F). A total of 144 pigs were transported to the University of Illinois Meat Science Laboratory and fabricated into primal and subprimal cuts to calculate carcass cutting yields. Differences in growth performance were observed, with pigs fed the DDGS treatment exhibiting greater (P ≤ 0.01) overall ADFI consuming 0.21, 0.18, and 0.28 kg/d more than HOSO2, HOSO4, and HOSO6 diets, respectively. Pigs fed the HOSO6 diet had greater (P ≤ 0.03) overall G:F than pigs fed DDGS and HOSO2 diets but did not differ (P = 0.12) from pigs fed HOSO4. Furthermore, differences in carcass traits were observed. Hot carcass weight was increased (P ≤ 0.03) in pigs fed the HOSO6 diet compared with pigs fed the DDGS and HOSO2 diets, while pigs fed HOSO4 did not differ (P > 0.05) from either extreme. Additionally, pigs fed HOSO4 and HOSO6 produced fatter (P ≤ 0.01) carcasses with reduced (P ≤ 0.01) standardized fat-free lean. Minimal differences were observed in primal weights expressed as a percentage of chilled side including bone-in Boston butt, trimmed loin, and trimmed ham with primal weights decreasing with increasing inclusion of dietary HOSO. Overall, pigs fed HOSO2 had reduced ADFI with similar backfat thickness and standardized fat-free lean compared with pigs fed the DDGS treatment. However, pigs fed HOSO 4% and 6% not only had improvements in ADFI and G:F but also had increased backfat thickness, which resulted in reductions in standardized fat-free lean and primal weights expressed as a percentage of chilled side weight.",

This study presents an optical method for determining the adulteration level of EVOO with soybean oil as well as peanut oil using LED-induced fluorescence spectroscopy. Eight LEDs with central wavelengths from ultra-violet (UV) to blue are tested to induce the fluorescence spectra of EVOO, peanut oil, and soybean oil, and the UV LED of 372 nm is selected for further detection. Samples are prepared by mixing olive oil with different volume fractions of peanut or soybean oil, and their fluorescence spectra are collected. Different pre-processing and regression methods are utilized to build the prediction model, and good linearity is obtained between the predicted and actual adulteration concentration. This result, accompanied by the non-destruction and no pre-treatment characteristics, proves that it is feasible to use LED-induced fluorescence spectroscopy as a way to investigate the EVOO adulteration level, and paves the way for building a hand-hold device that can be applied to real market conditions in the future.",

Particularly, compared with the pretreatment using soybean oil that obtained the highest color strength of 3.89 (as K/S value determined from spectral analysis of the sample reflectance in the visible range), the present pretreatments with either acrylated epoxidized soybean oil (AESO) or a mixture of acrylic acid and soybean oil (AA/Soy) achieved K/S values higher than nine (>9.00). The NTP treatment, after the AESO or AA/Soy pretreatment, was essential in inducing the formation of a polymerized network on the surface of para-aramids that bonded the dye molecules and generating covalent bonds that anchored the polymerized network to the para-aramids, which is difficult to achieve given the high crystallinity and chemical inertness of para-aramids. As an important economic consideration, the sequential experimentation method demonstrated that a simple mixture of AA/Soy could replace the expensive AESO reagent and render a comparable performance in dyeing para-aramids. Among the auxiliary additives tested with the AESO and AA/Soy pretreatments followed by NPT treatment in this study, Polysorbate 80 as a surfactant negatively affected the dyeing, benzyl alcohol as a swelling agent had minimal effect, and NaCl as an electrolyte showed a positive effect. The dyeing method developed in this study did not compromise the strength of para-aramids."

The feasibility of rapid detection of capsaicin concentration in soybean oil was studied by terahertz spectroscopy. Genetic algorithm (GA) and principal component analysis (PCA) as the pretreatment method were used to obtain the best spectral features. Least square-support vector machine (LS-SVM), back propagation neural network (BPNN), and partial least squares (PLS) were combined with the pretreatment method to obtain the best determination model. The BPNN was combined with GA to obtain the best quantitative prediction results with the correlation coefficient of prediction (RP ), prediction root mean square error (RMSEP), the ratio of prediction to deviation (RPD), and range error ratio (RER) were 0.9309, 0.4030 µg/kg, 17.0421, and 2.4813, respectively. Furthermore, the detection limit of capsaicin could achieve 1.25 µg/kg in soybean oil and the accuracy of discrimination was up to 100% in the prediction set using the LS-SVM combined with GA pre-treatment. The results suggested that terahertz spectroscopy together with chemometric methods would be a promising technique for rapid determination of capsaicin concentration in soybean oil. Meanwhile, it is necessary to perform further experiments with real gutter oil samples before applying the method in practice. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: The combination of terahertz spectroscopy technology and chemometrics is a promising method for the rapid determination of capsaicin concentration in soybean oil with high efficiency.",

      "abstract": "The key adipose tissue characteristics are established during early development, where lipids play an essential role. Lipid emulsions used in total parenteral nutrition have different omega-(n) 6 to n-3 fatty acid ratios. A lower n-6:n-3 fatty acid decreases lipid accumulation; however, the effects of lipid emulsions with different n-6 to n-3 fatty acid ratios on the programming of preadipocytes to affect lipid accumulation in mature adipocytes is not known. This study compared the effects of Fish oil (FO), Mixed oil (MO), and Soybean oil (SO) based lipid emulsion on genes involved in adipogenesis, lipogenesis, lipolysis, and β-oxidation in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Preadipocytes were treated with specific lipid emulsions and then differentiated to mature adipocytes in the absence of lipid emulsions. In a separate experiment, mature 3T3-L1 adipocytes were treated with lipid emulsions to investigate the effects on genes involved in lipolysis. Fatty acid composition, triacylglycerol levels, and the mRNA expression of genes involved in adipogenesis, lipogenesis, lipolysis, and β-oxidation were measured. Preadipocytes and mature adipocytes treated with FO showed higher incorporation of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, lower triacylglycerol levels, and decreased mRNA expression of adipogenic and lipogenic genes, followed by MO and SO. FO and MO increased the mRNA expression of carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1, while FO decreased the mRNA expression of lipolytic genes compared to untreated cells. Our findings suggest that FO programs preadipocytes to prevent adipose tissue dysfunction in mature adipocytes; the effects of FO-based lipid emulsion were followed by MO and SO.",

Studies evaluating both fish oil supplementation on fatigue and associations between fish oil consumption and fatigue have shown mixed effects; it is unknown what factors contribute to these differential effects. Herein, we investigate whether the nutritional status of cancer survivors was associated with serum omega-3 concentration or change in serum omega-3s throughout a fish oil supplementation study, and then if any of these factors were associated with fatigue. Breast cancer survivors 4-36 months post-treatment with moderate-severe fatigue were randomized to take 6 g fish oil, 6 g soybean oil, or 3 g of each daily for 6 weeks. Baseline nutritional status was calculated using the Controlling Nutritional Status tool (serum albumin, lymphocytes, cholesterol). At baseline and post-intervention, serum fatty acids were quantified and fatigue was assessed using the Multidimensional Fatigue Symptom Inventory. Participants (n = 85) were 61.2 ± 9.7 years old with a body mass index of 31.9 ± 6.7 kg/m2; 69% had a good nutritional score and 31% had light-moderate malnutrition. Those with good nutritional status had greater total serum omega-3s at baseline (p = 0.013) and a greater increase in serum omega-3s with supplementation (p = 0.003). Among those who were supplemented with fish oil, greater increases in serum omega-3s were associated with greater improvements in fatigue. In conclusion, good nutritional status may increase uptake of fatty acid supplements, increasing their ability to improve fatigue.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Soybean oil bodies (SOB) are naturally pre-emulsified lipid droplets recovered directly from soybean seeds. Almost all food emulsions contain salts. However, it was not clear how the incorporation of salts affected the physicochemical stability of SOB. RESULTS: This study investigated the effect of NaCl (0-1.2%) on the physical and oxidative stability of SOB emulsions under neutral (pH 7) and acidic (pH 3) conditions. In the presence of NaCl, the SOB emulsion (pH 7) showed strong flocculation during storage due to electrostatic screening. The NaCl-induced flocculation of SOB was attenuated at pH 3, which may be due to the difference in conformation or interaction of the protein interfaces covering SOB at different pH values. The increase in ionic strength or acid conditioning treatment resulted in a remarkable increase in the stability of SOB emulsions against coalescence. The confocal laser scanning microscopy images also confirmed the NaCl-induced changes in the flocculation/coalescence properties of SOB. The oxidative behavior tests indicated that SOB emulsions containing NaCl were more susceptible to lipid oxidation but protein oxidation was inhibited due to electrostatic screening, which reduced pro-oxidant accessibility of unadsorbed proteins in the emulsion. This oxidative behavior was attenuated at pH 3. CONCLUSION: The incorporation of NaCl significantly reduced the physical and oxidative stability of the SOB emulsion, and acidic pH mitigated NaCl-induced flocculation and lipid oxidation of SOB. © 2021 Society of Chemical Industry.",

Thus, the objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of soybean oil supplementation to sows in the first three days after farrowing to save piglet fat reserves through the higher nutritional intake of sow milk. In total, 604.5, 750, 1000, 1250 and 1500 g of soybean oil were provided for each sow during the three days of supplementation. A total of 60 sows were evaluated per treatment, distributed in a random block design, supplemented in the first three days after farrowing with soybean oil added on top of the feed at the time of feeding. Performance and reproductive data and milk samples were collected from the sows to determine fat levels. Piglets were evaluated for fall-back rate and survival. There was no significant effect of soybean oil supplementation on any of the parameters evaluated for both sows and their milk. Therefore, soybean oil supplementation for sows in the first three days after farrowing does not influence performance parameters, reproduction and milk fat of the sows and mortality and fall-back rate of the piglets.",

The curve equation established a linear relationship between the solubility of hydrogen in oil and the number of moles of hydrogen in the reactor. Under the optimal temperature and catalyst, the relationship between the hydrogen consumption of the hydrogenation of oil and fat and the TFAs formed in the oil was determined. When the reaction pressure exceeded 3.0 MPa, the hydrogenation of oil was consumed. The amount of hydrogen, the rate of hydrogenation, and the change in the TFAs all stabilized. Therefore, the pressure of the general hydrogenation reaction should not exceed 3.0 MPa.

This study explores the effects of soybean oil with different oxidative degree on the placental injury of gestational rats. METHODS AND RESULTS: Thirty-two female adult rats are randomly assigned to four groups. The control group is fed the purified diet with fresh soybean oil (FSO), and the treatment groups are fed purified diets with lipid content replaced by oxidized soybean oil (OSO) at 200, 400, and 800 mEqO2 kg-1 from conception until delivery. On day 20 of gestation, OSO decreased placental and embryonic weights as the oxidative degree increased linearly and quadratically. The expression of Bax showed a linear increase, and Bcl-2 decreased as the oxidative degree increased. The expression of Fosl1 and Esx1 is linearly and quadratically decreased in OSO-treated groups than FSO group. OSO decreased the level of IL-10 but increased expression of IL-1β in placenta and plasma. OSO remarkably upregulates levels of Fatp1 and Glut1 and decreases expression of Snat2 and Glut3. CONCLUSION: OSO aggravates placental injury by modulating nutrient transporters and apoptosis-related genes, impedes placental growth and development, and ultimately leads to the decrease of fetal weight.",

To achieve a one-step synthesis of biodiesel and recovery of bioactive compounds from SODD, four commercial immobilized enzymes (Novozym 435, Lipozyme TLIM, Lipozyme RMIM, and Lipozyme RM) and one self-prepared immobilized lipase MAS1-H108A were compared. The results showed that immobilized lipase MAS1-H108A due to the better methanol tolerance and higher catalytic activity gave the highest biodiesel yield of 97.08% under the optimized conditions: molar ratio of 1:2 (oil/methanol), temperature of 35 °C, and enzyme loading of 35 U/g SODD, even after 10 persistent cycles without significant decrease of activity. Simultaneously, there was no loss of tocopherols and squalene in SODD during the enzymatic reaction. Pure biodiesel (characterized by fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)) and a high concentration of bioactive compounds could be successfully separated by molecular distillation at 100 °C. In a word, this work provides an interesting idea to achieve environmentally friendly treatment of SODD by combining an enzymatic process and molecular distillation, and it is suitable for industrial production."

      "abstract": "In this research, we studied the inhibitory mechanism of quercetin, one popular phenolic compound, against aldehyde formation in thermally treated soybean oil. It was found that quercetin reduced unsaturated aldehyde formation significantly, with the inhibitory effect decreased with the extension of the heating time. Meanwhile, quercetin had minimum effects on the fatty acid profile compared to untreated samples. Some new phenolic derivatives were formed in thermally treated soybean oil with quercetin, further analyzed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, and compared to newly synthesized derivatives (characterized by mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy). On the basis of their chemical structures, we proposed that quercetin reacted with 13-oxo-octadecadienoic acid, 10-oxo-hexadecenoic acid, and 10-oxo-octadecenoic acid formed from peroxidation of linoleic acid, palmitoleic acid, and oleic acid, respectively, to inhibit aldehyde formation. In addition, newly formed quercetin-3-O-hexanoate, quercetin-3-O-heptanoate, and quercetin-3-O-nonanoate showed weaker 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl and 2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) diammonium salt radical cation scavenging activity and weaker antioxidant activity in soybean oil, which explained the decreased inhibitory activity of quercetin against aldehyde formation during heat treatment. More interesting, quercetin-3-O-hexanoate showed improved cellular antioxidant activity compared to the parent quercetin. Overall, quercetin inhibited the formation of lipid oxidation products in thermally treated soybean oil by reacting with early intermediates in the lipid oxidation reaction, and quercetin derivatives formed in the process could be with enhanced cellular antioxidant activity. Our results provide novel insight into the inhibitory mechanism of quercetin against the formation of lipid oxidation products.",

Supplementation with soybean oil (SBO) may be a useful strategy to enhance milk quality. In total, eight multiparous Murciano-Granadina dairy goats (42.8 ± 1.3 kg body weight; 99 ± 1 days of lactation) were used in a replicated 4 × 4 Latin square design with four periods; 21 d each (14 d adaptation, 5 d for measurements and 2 d transition between periods). Goats were allocated to one of four treatments in a 2 × 2 factorial arrangement. Factors were no oil (CON) or 4% of soybean oil (SBO), and controlled thermal neutral (TN; 15 to 20 °C) or heat stress (HS; 12 h/d at 37 °C and 12 h/d at 30 °C) conditions. This resulted in four treatment combinations: TN-CON, TN-SBO, HS-CON, and HS-SBO. Compared to TN, HS goats experienced lower (p < 0.05) feed intake, body weight, N retention, milk yield, and milk protein and lactose contents. However, goats in HS conditions had greater (p < 0.05) digestibility coefficients (+5.1, +5.2, +4.6, +7.0, and +8.9 points for dry matter, organic matter, crude protein, neutral detergent fiber, and acid detergent fiber, respectively) than TN goats. The response to SBO had the same magnitude in TN and HS conditions. Supplementation with SBO had no effects on feed intake, milk yield, or milk protein content. However, SBO supplementation increased (p < 0.05) blood non-esterified fatty acids by 50%, milk fat by 29%, and conjugated linoleic acid by 360%. In conclusion, feeding 4% SBO to dairy goats was a useful strategy to increase milk fat and conjugated linoleic acid without any negative effects on intake, milk yield, or milk protein content. These beneficial effects were obtained regardless goats were in TN or HS conditions."

METHODS: In an institutional review board-approved, multicenter retrospective review, the medical records of 328 patients who were born at a gestational age of ≤34 weeks, had a birth weight of 500 to 2,000 g, were admitted to one of 2 neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) within a large health system, and received at least 7 days of a parenteral nutrition containing either lipid emulsion product were reviewed: 151 (46%) had received SO-ILE and 177 (54%) had received SMOFlipid (Fresenius Kabi). The primary outcome of the study was a composite of development of cholestasis and development of hypertriglyceridemia. Secondary outcomes included total duration of cholestasis treatment with ursodiol and change in body weight from initiation to completion of lipid emulsion treatment. RESULTS: The primary outcome of development of cholestasis or hypertriglyceridemia occurred in 14.6% of patients in the SO-ILE group and 18.1% of patients in the SMOFlipid group (P = 0.393). There were no statistically significant differences between the groups in total days of ursodiol treatment or average body weight change during the course of lipid emulsion treatment. CONCLUSION: In preterm neonates weighing 500 to 2,000 g, use of SMOFlipid did not significantly reduce the incidence of cholestasis or hypertriglyceridemia relative to the incidence with use of SO-ILE. Further research to validate these results is needed.",

Inconsistent evidence may be influenced by fatty acid saturation, chain-length, and regio-specificity within triacylglycerol (TAG) molecules. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to compare eucaloric diets enriched in palm olein (POo), cocoa butter (COB), and soybean oil (SBO) on liver fat concentration in healthy participants. Secondary outcomes included visceral (VAT) and abdominal subcutaneous (aSCAT) adipose tissue, plus other obesity and cardiometabolic health outcomes. METHODS: Eighty-three healthy participants (20-45 y, BMI 18.5-27.5 kg/m2) commenced and 64 completed a 16-wk randomized parallel intervention, preceded by a 2-wk run-in. Participants consumed identical eucaloric background diets differing in test fats [contributing 20% total energy intake (%E)], providing 33%E total fat with the following ratios for PUFAs/SFAs/MUFAs: POo, 4.2/13.5/15%E; SBO, 14.4/8.8/9.4%E; COB, 2.3/19.5/11%E. Liver fat and abdominal adiposity were measured at weeks 0 and 16 using 1H-magnetic resonance spectroscopy/imaging; all other outcomes were measured at 0, 4, 8, 12, and 16 wk. RESULTS: Fat quality did not affect liver fat concentration, VAT, aSCAT, obesity indexes, blood pressure, liver enzymes, leptin, or fasting glucose. Body fat mass decreased with SBO and COB compared with POo. SBO decreased serum total cholesterol (TC), LDL cholesterol, and TC:HDL cholesterol relative to POo [estimated marginal mean (95% CI) differences: -0.57 (-0.94, -0.20) mmol/L; -0.37 (-0.68, -0.07) mmol/L; and -0.42 (-0.73, -0.11) mmol/L, respectively]. No diet differences were observed on HDL cholesterol, TAG, apoA1, apoB, apoB:apoA1, or fecal free fatty acids (FFAs), except for lower FFA pentadecanoic acid (15:0) with COB than with SBO and POo. CONCLUSIONS: In healthy adults, when consumed as part of eucaloric typical Australian diets, 3 different dietary fat sources did not differentially affect liver fat concentration and amounts of adipose tissue. Effects on serum lipids were inconsistent across lipid profiles. The findings must be confirmed in metabolically impaired individuals before recommendations can be made.",

      "abstract": "During the poultry industrialization process the so-called sludge oil, a residual chicken fat, is recovered in the wastewater treatment plant and its use presents potential as raw material for biodiesel production. Thus, the aim of the study was to prepare blends of sludge oil with soybean oil to obtain fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) through the homogeneous alkaline transesterification reaction. To perform this study, a simple pre-treatment process - heating and subsequent filtration - was used, allowing sludge oil to be mixed with soybean oil to compose blends, without the need to use more sophisticated pre-treatment processes. After this step, blends ranging from 5% to 90% (m/m) of sludge oil mixed with soybean oil were prepared. The results showed that the molar ratio (1:6 oil blend:methanol), catalyst concentration 0.5% NaOH (mcat/moil), at 65 °C for 60 min yielded FAME above 99.0 and 90.0% (m/m) for blends with up to 5 and 15% sludge oil, respectively. By increasing the temperature to 70 °C, under the same selected parameters, the blend with 10% sludge oil provided yield above 99.0% (m/m), presenting appropriate physicochemical properties, within the parameters required by National Agency of Petroleum, Natural Gas and Biofuels (ANP). These findings show the great potential sludge oil provides to reduce Brazil's dependency on soybean oil for biodiesel production.Highlights Sludge oil, a waste raw material for biodiesel production, is not yet explored in Brazil.A procedure for biodiesel production using soybean oil and sludge oil blends was proposed.The best reaction condition was 1:6 oil blend:MeOH molar ratio; 0.5% NaOH (mcat/moil), at 70 °C for 60 min.Biodiesel yield was higher than 99% (m/m) under optimal reaction conditions.Sludge oil represents a promising waste raw material for biodiesel production.",

In this study, starch was hydrophobized by treating starch-dimethyl sulfoxide solutions with soybean oil at high temperature in the presence of sodium carbonate, then spray-coated on paper. The modified starch was evaluated by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy analysis and contact angle value measurement of coated paper. FTIR analysis confirmed the substitution of hydroxyl groups with fatty acid ester and provided an estimate of the degree of substitution. The contact angle value of starch-coated paper surfaces was 121°, and was 111° after 10 min, demonstrating the high hydrophobicity and potential of the modified starch coating as a water-resistant treatment. The high hydrophobicity of the coated paper was due to formation of a textured surface with two levels of roughness, caused by the deposition of rough hydrophobic starch particles on paper fibers."

In this study, it was applied to immobilization of oleaginous yeasts for treating soybean oil refinery effluent. The immobilization percentage reached 50%, and the removal of chemical oxygen demand and oil content reached 92.1% and 93.1%, respectively, during dynamic immobilization using a mass percentage of bacterial cellulose of 30% and an immobilization time of 24 h, which were significantly higher than those of free oleaginous yeasts or yeasts immobilized by bacterial cellulose from rich medium. The immobilized oleaginous yeasts facilitated the recovery of the yeasts and effectively treated three batches of soybean oil refinery effluent. The immobilized oleaginous yeasts recovered after soybean oil refinery effluent treatment were pyrolyzed to produce bio-oil, which contributed to more alkanes and a higher calorific value of bio-oil in the pyrolysis products as compared to those of free oleaginous yeasts. As bacterial cellulose used as an oleaginous yeast cell carrier is produced from soybean oil refinery effluent, no waste of immobilization materials is involved and an efficient waste-into-oil bioprocess is developed.",

      "abstract": "Based on low 18:0 contents observed in milk fat of cows fed cactus cladodes (CC), we hypothesized that including Opuntia stricta cladodes in a soybean oil (SO)-supplemented diet would promote incomplete rumen biohydrogenation of supplemental PUFA, leading to increased trans-11 18:1 and cis-9, trans-11 CLA contents in milk. Twelve Holstein cows were used in a two-period study: (a) Baseline: all cows received a total mixed ration (TMR) composed of sorghum silage (SS) and a concentrate containing no SO for 14 days; (b) Treatment: cows received one of the following SO-supplemented diets for 21 days: (1) SS-TMR: a TMR composed of SS and a SO-enriched concentrate, (2) CC-TMR: a TMR containing CC as a partial substitute for SS plus the SO-enriched concentrate, and (3) CC-PMR: same diet as in treatment 2, but CC were mixed with the SO-enriched concentrate and fed as a partial mixed ration (PMR). Both CC diets increased relative abundances of trans-11 18:1, cis-9, trans-11 CLA, and 18:2 n-6 in milk fat, whereas opposite effects were observed on 18:0 and cis-9 18:1. Proportion of 18:2 n-6 increased, and cis-9, trans-11 CLA tended to increase with CC-PMR as compared to CC-TMR, whereas 18:3 n-3 was higher with CC-PMR than with SS-TMR. Proportions of several odd- and branched-chain fatty acids, certain 18:1 isomers, and trans-9, cis-11 CLA changed with CC diets, notably with CC-PMR. Milk yield and intake of most nutrients (except fibre) increased or tended to increase with the CC diets, whereas gross milk composition was unaltered. Stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 index for C18 (SCD18 ) was higher with CC-PMR than with SS-TMR, and milk n-6:n-3 FA ratio and apparent transfer of 18:2 n-6 to milk increased with CC diets. These results indicate that Opuntia stricta cladodes can be a valuable feed ingredient for improving the nutraceutical value of milk fat.",

In analytical food evaluation, oils represent an important field, allowing the exploration of the antioxidant effects of herbs and seeds. However, traditional methodologies have some drawbacks which must be overcome, such as being time-consuming, requiring sample preparation, the use of solvents/reagents, and the generation of toxic waste. The objective of this study is to evaluate the protective effect provided by plant-based substances (directly, or as extracts), including pumpkin seeds, poppy seeds, dehydrated goji berry, and Provençal herbs, against the oxidation of antioxidant-free soybean oil. Synthetic antioxidants tert-butylhydroquinone and butylated hydroxytoluene were also considered. The evaluation was made through thermal degradation of soybean oil at different temperatures, and near-infrared spectroscopy was employed in an n-way mode, coupled with Parallel Factor Analysis (PARAFAC) to extract nontrivial information. The results for PARAFAC indicated that factor 1 shows oxidation product information, while factor 2 presents results regarding the antioxidant effect. The plant-based extract was more effective in improving the frying stability of soybean oil. It was also possible to observe that while the oxidation product concentration increased, the antioxidant concentration decreased as the temperature increased. The proposed method is shown to be a simple and fast way to obtain information on the protective effects of antioxidant additives in edible oils, and has an encouraging potential for use in other applications.",

      "abstract": "This study investigated the effects of preheat treatments on the composition, rheological properties, and the physical stability of soybean oil bodies and examined the stability of coffee containing those oil bodies. Three preheat treatment methods were compared, including heating (at 65, 75, and 85 °C for 30 min) of raw soymilk, high-pressure steam heating (at 110, 120, and 130 °C for 10 s, ultra high temperature [UHT] treated) of dry soybeans, and milling of soaked soybeans in boiling water. Three UHT samples showed the highest oil body yields (13.59 to 13.87%) and protein yield (2.47 to 3.03%), while oil content in extracts was the lowest (30.97 to 46.25%). Soymilk heated at 65 or 75 °C for 30 min showed high oil body extraction yields (13.38 and 11.46%) and the highest oil extraction yields (6.38 to 8.38%) among all the samples. Three UHT samples had a higher average particle size and higher apparent viscosity compared with those of all the other samples. The results from sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and particle size distribution suggested heat treatment at 65 to 85 °C just lead to the partially denaturation and unfolding of storage protein instead of severe aggregation, while UHT (samples 5, 6, and 7) could lead to large amount soluble aggregates within oleosins and storage proteins via disulfide bonds. The diluted emulsion with 12% fat content remained stable during a 15-day storage period at 4 °C. The coffee stability of the diluted oil body emulsion indicated high oleosins and low storage protein content in the oil body was a benefit for the coffee stability. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: Soybean oil bodies are natural sources of pre-emulsified oil derived from soybean and can be dispersed in an aqueous medium to form a stable emulsion system. This study provides the foundation for the preparation and application of soybean oil bodies with differing emulsion stabilities and extraction yields in the food industry.",

Lipid injectable emulsions are a key component of PN, as they contain essential fatty acids and provide energy critical for brain growth. Prolonged administration increases risk of intestinal failure-associated liver disease, including cholestasis, and other complications. METHODS: This is a retrospective, quasi-experimental cohort study of 215 VLBW neonates. The primary outcome was a change in direct bilirubin concentration. Secondary outcomes included change in total bilirubin concentration and incidences of cholestasis and other disease states associated with PN and prematurity. Cholestasis was defined as direct bilirubin ≥ 1.0 mg/dL with total bilirubin < 5.0 mg/dL or direct bilirubin > 20% of total bilirubin with total bilirubin > 5.0 mg/dL. RESULTS: Change in direct bilirubin concentration was not different between groups. Incidence of cholestasis was not different between groups per charted diagnosis or per study definition. Non-stage-0 retinopathy of prematurity, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, sepsis, and necrotizing enterocolitis were all lower in the mixed oil lipid emulsion group, which remained significant after adjustment for differences in gestational age, birth weight, and PN duration. CONCLUSIONS: Although mixed oil lipid emulsion was not found to be associated with a lower risk of cholestasis, it may decrease risks of other disease states associated with PN therapy.",

Nonlactating, pregnant, multiparous Angus × Hereford cows (n = 104) that conceived during the same fixed-time artificial insemination protocol were assigned to this experiment. Cows were ranked by pregnancy sire (one of two sires), body weight (BW), and body condition score (BCS) on day -15 of the experiment (day 180 of gestation). Cows were then assigned to receive (dry matter basis) 415 g of soybean meal per cow daily in addition to: 1) 195 g/cow daily of CSSO (n = 52) or 2) 170 g/cow daily of CON (n = 52). Cows were maintained in two pastures (26 cows/treatment per pasture) and received daily 12.7 kg/cow (dry matter basis) of grass-alfalfa hay from day -15 to calving. Cows were segregated into 1 of 24 feeding pens three times weekly and received treatments individually from day 0 to calving. Calves were weaned on day 290 of the experiment, preconditioned for 35 d (day 291 to 325), and transferred to a feedyard, where they remained until slaughter (day 514). Cows receiving CSSO and their calves had greater (P < 0.01) plasma concentrations of linoleic acid and total ω-6 PUFA compared with CON after calving. Concentrations of immunoglobulin G in the colostrum and in calf plasma 24 h after birth were greater (P ≤ 0.02) in CSSO vs. CON cattle. Calves from CSSO cows had greater (P ≤ 0.05) expression of adipogenic (adipocyte fatty acid-binding protein and stearoyl-CoA desaturase) and myogenic (myogenic differentiation 1 and myogenin) genes in the longissimus muscle (LM) compared with CON. No treatment differences in birth BW, weaning BW, and final preconditioning BW were noted (P ≥ 0.36). Average daily gain and final BW in the feedyard were greater (P ≤ 0.05) in steers from CSSO cows compared with CON. The incidence of calves diagnosed with BRD that required a second antimicrobial treatment was less (P = 0.03) in calves from CSSO cows, resulting in reduced (P = 0.05) need of treatments to regain health compared with CON. Upon slaughter, LM area was greater (P = 0.03) in calves from CSSO cows compared with CON. Collectively, these results are indicative of programming effects on postnatal offspring growth and health resultant from CSSO supplementation to late-gestating cows. Hence, supplementing CSSO to beef cows during pregnancy might be a feasible alternative to optimize offspring productivity and welfare.",

      "abstract": "This experiment compared plasma fatty acid (FA) profile of forage-fed beef cows receiving a molasses-based supplement enriched with Ca salts of soybean oil [CSSO; 24.7% of dry matter (DM)] via a self-fed low-moisture block (LMB) or hand-fed granular concentrate daily (CONC). Thirty-six nonlactating, nonpregnant, multiparous beef cows were blocked by age (three blocks), ranked within blocks by body weight (BW) and body condition score (BCS), and allocated to 1 of three drylot pens (27 × 10 m) per block. Nine pens with four cows each were enrolled in a replicated 3 × 2 Latin square design with two periods of 42 d, and a 21-d washout interval. On day 0, pens within each block were randomly assigned to receive one of the three treatments, in a manner that pens did not receive the same treatment in both periods (total n = 6 pens per treatment). Cows received hay (Cynodon dactylon), water, and a mineral-vitamin mix for ad libitum consumption during the study. Hay intake was recorded daily from days 0 to 42, and LMB intake was recorded from days 14 to 42 to allow cows to adapt to supplement with minimal interference from days 0 to 13. The CONC was offered at 0.420 kg/cow daily (DM basis) from days 0 to 13 and then adjusted (days 14 to 42) to match LMB intake. Cow BW and BCS were recorded, and blood samples were collected on days 0, 14, 28, and 42. Average LMB intake during the initial 13 d was 0.846 ± 0.107 kg/cow daily (DM basis). Supplement DM intake did not differ (P = 0.39) between LMB and CONC cows from days 14 to 42 as designed (0.570 vs. 0.583 kg/d, respectively; SEM = 0.011), despite a greater variation in daily intake of LMB vs. CONC (treatment × day interaction; P < 0.01). No treatments effects were noted (P ≥ 0.40) for hay intake, BCS, and BW. Treatment × day interactions were detected (P ≤ 0.01) for plasma concentrations of ω-6 polyunsaturated FA and total FA. On day 0, plasma FA profile did not differ (P ≥ 0.20) between treatments. From days 14 to 42, plasma concentrations of linoleic acid, ω-6 polyunsaturated FA, and total FA were greater (P < 0.01) in CONC and LMB vs. NOSUPP cows. Plasma concentrations of these FA were also greater (P ≤ 0.03) in LMB vs. CONC cows on day 14, but did not differ (P ≥ 0.35) on days 28 and 42. These results indicate that CSSO inclusion into LMB resulted in similar incorporation of ω-6 polyunsaturated and total FA in the circulation compared with CONC offered at the same daily rate. Hence, the use of self-fed LMB appears to be a valid strategy to provide CSSO to forage-fed beef cattle with reduced labor needs."

The purpose of this study was to compare Enertia s/f, a proprietary CSFAs, and soybean (SB) oil with respect to impact on apparent total tract nutrient digestion and cecal fermentation parameters in horses. Eight cecally cannulated Quarter Horses were used in a crossover design in which horses consumed a diet for 32 d consisting of 1.5% body weight (BW) (as-fed) smooth bromegrass hay and 0.5% BW (as-fed) pelleted concentrate containing 4.9% CSFAs or 4.1% SB oil. Fecal samples were collected every 4 h from day 30 to 32 of each period and analyzed for apparent total tract digestibilities of dry matter (DM), neutral detergent fiber (NDF), acid detergent fiber (ADF), crude protein (CP), crude fat (CF), and gross energy (GE) using acid detergent insoluble ash as an internal marker. Cecal digesta was obtained at 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 h following the morning meal on day 29 of each period and analyzed for pH and concentrations of volatile fatty acid (VFA) and long-chain fatty acids (LCFAs). Serum was collected on day 33 of each period following a 16-h fast and analyzed for triglycerides and cholesterol. Apparent total tract digestibilities of DM, NDF, ADF, CP, CF, and GE were unaffected by lipid source (P > 0.10). Serum triglycerides tended to be greater in horses consuming CSFAs compared to SB (P = 0.10); however, serum cholesterol was not different (P = 0.45). In horses consuming SB, cecal pH decreased below baseline (hour 0) at hours 2, 4, and 6 (P < 0.01), whereas cecal pH in horses consuming CSFAs was below baseline at hours 4 and 6 (P < 0.01). There were no treatment or time effects on cecal pH (P > 0.10). Cecal concentrations of total VFAs were greater in horses consuming SB compared to CSFAs at hour 2 (P = 0.01). Cecal concentrations of acetate, propionate, acetate:propionate (A:P), and butyrate were affected by time (P < 0.01). Propionate was less at hour 2 in horses fed CSFAs compared to horses fed SB (P = 0.04). A treatment × time interaction was detected for total cecal LCFAs concentration (P < 0.01); LCFAs concentration was greater at hour 2 for horses consuming CSFAs compared to horses fed SB (P = 0.02). SB oil and CSFAs have similar effects on the digestion of DM, NDF, ADF, GE, CF, and CP."

To minimize insulin secretion while manipulating t10c12CLA levels, diets supplemented with palmitic acid-enriched triglycerides and soybean oil were fed to cows. Thirty-two Holstein cows (93 ± 35 d in milk) were included in the crossover experiment with each treatment period being 28 d. Treatment diets contained 25% neutral detergent fiber, 32% starch, 18% crude protein, and 4.6% fatty acids (dry matter basis). Treatment diets contained either palmitic acid-enriched triglycerides (2.5% dry matter, BergaFat T-300, Berg + Schmidt America LLC, Libertyville, IL; PAT) or soybean oil (2.5% dry matter; SBO). Cows were blocked by milk yield, body weight, and parity, and then randomly assigned to 1 of 2 treatment sequences (PAT-SBO or SBO-PAT). Cows fed PAT produced milk with only 3.1% fat, indicating milk fat depression; SBO decreased fat content further to only 2.4%. No effect of treatment was observed on dry matter intake, apparent net energy intake, milk yield, body condition score, or fat thickness over the rump and rib. However, compared with PAT, SBO decreased fat-corrected milk yield, energy-corrected milk yield, milk fat yield, de novo fatty acids, and 16-carbon fatty acid yield, whereas SBO increased body weight gain. Neutral detergent fiber digestibility tended to be lower in SBO, whereas fatty acid digestibility was higher. Additionally, the concentration of plasma insulin, nonesterified fatty acids, and triglycerides, and milk metabolites (trans-10 C18:1 and t10c12CLA) were all higher in SBO. In conclusion, with similar dietary starch content, the diet containing palmitic acid-enriched triglycerides partitioned more energy toward milk synthesis, whereas the diet containing soybean oil partitioned more energy toward body tissue gain.",

The purpose of this study was to compare the incidence and severity of IFALD in a highly surgical neonatal population receiving mixed oil-based lipid emulsions (MOLEs) vs soybean oil-based lipid emulsions (SOLEs) for long-term PN. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study evaluated patients admitted to a neonatal intensive care nursery that received PN for ≥14 days. Patients were separated into 2 cohorts; those who received SOLE and those who received MOLE. The primary outcome of this study was the occurrence of IFALD. Secondary outcomes included time to IFALD, peak bilirubin level during therapy, incidence of hypertriglyceridemia, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, and retinopathy of prematurity. RESULTS: A total of 107 patients were included in the study, IFALD occurred in 44.8% of patients receiving SOLE compared with 30% of patients receiving MOLE (relative risk, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.39-1.15). In the multivariable analysis, adjusting for the known confounders (prematurity, necrotizing enterocolitis, presence of ostomy, and duration of PN and lipids), the type of lipids was not a significant predictor for development of IFALD. Duration of PN and duration of lipids were determined to be significant risk factors for IFALD, regardless of type of lipid emulsion (odds ratio, 1.03; 95% CI, 1.01-1.05). CONCLUSIONS: Use of MOLE resulted in no significant difference in the outcomes studied when compared with SOLE. Duration of PN and duration of lipids were significant risk factors for development of IFALD.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: We hypothesized that supplementation of nursery and grower pig diets with coconut oil in the absence of antibiotics would yield maintenance of glucose homeostasis, growth performance, and immune function similar to what is achieved with nursery and grower pig diets containing antibiotics. Pigs received the same base treatment diets from d24 (weaning) to d71 of age and had blood and fecal samples collected on d24, d31, d45 and d71 for measurement of whole blood glucose, serum insulin, cortisol and cytokines, and fecal microbiome. Pigs had weekly weights and daily feed consumption measured throughout the study. Animals were euthanized at d71 and subcutaneous fat and ileal contents were collected for assessment for fatty acids and microbiome, respectively. Diet treatments consisted of 2% soybean oil plus antibiotics (ABX; n = 22), 2% soybean oil without antibiotics (NABX; n = 22), and 2% coconut oil without antibiotics (COC; n = 22). Statistical analysis examined the effect of diet within each timepoint using a repeated measures ANOVA. RESULTS: Pigs fed COC diet had decreased serum insulin levels, maintained feed intake, feed conversion and weight gain, and, based on serum cytokines and fecal microbiome, were immunologically similar to ABX-fed pigs. However, NABX-fed pigs performed similarly to the ABX-fed pigs in all parameters except for serum cytokines. Additionally, there was no difference in the incidence of diarrhea between any of the diet treatments. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that dietary antibiotics are not necessary to maintain growth performance in nursery and grower pigs. However, dietary antibiotics appear to modulate circulating cytokine levels. Dietary coconut oil is neither harmful nor helpful to growth performance or immune function in nursery and grower pigs but does modulate serum insulin levels. Therefore, while coconut oil fed at 2% by weight is a suitable substitute for dietary antibiotics, this study suggests that no substitute for dietary antibiotics is needed at all."

Therefore, this work aimed to investigate the effect of ultrasonic treatment of AX on their antioxidant capacity and its ability to improve the oxidative stability of soybean oil. For this purpose, AX were exposed to ultrasonic treatment at 25% (100 W, AX-1) and 50% (200 W, AX-2) power and an operating frequency of 20 KHz during 15 min, and their macromolecular properties (weight average molecular weight (Mw), polydispersity index and intrinsic viscosity) were evaluated. The antioxidant capacity of AX was determined by the DPPH assay and Rancimat test. Results showed that ultrasonic treatment did not affect the molecular identity of the polysaccharide but modified its Mw distribution. AX-1 showed the highest antioxidant activity (75% inhibition) at 533 µg/mL by the DPPH method compared to AX and AX-2. AX at 0.25% (w/v) and AX-1 at 0.01% (w/v) exerted the highest protective effects on oxidative stability of soybean oil with induction periods of 7.69 and 5.54 h, respectively. The results indicate that AX could be a good alternative for the potential application as a natural antioxidant in oils."

      "abstract": "The objectives of the current experiments were to evaluate the effect of feeding soybean oil (SO) with different levels of peroxidation on lipid, N, and GE digestibility, gut integrity, oxidative stress, and growth performance in nursery pigs. Treatments consisted diets containing 10% fresh SO (22.5 °C) or thermally processed SO (45 °C for 288 h, 90 °C for 72 h, or 180 °C for 6 h), each with an air infusion of 15 L/min, with postprocessing peroxide values of 7.6, 11.5, 19.1, and 13.4 mEq/kg and p-anisidine values of 1.92, 6.29, 149, and 159, for the 22.5 °C, 45 °C, 90 °C and 180 °C processed SO, respectively. In experiment 1, 64 barrows (7.1 ± 0.9 kg initial BW) were randomly allotted into 2 rooms of 32 pens and individually fed their experimental diets for 21 d, with a fresh fecal sample collected on day 20 for determination of GE and lipid digestibility. In experiment 2, 56 barrows (BW 9.16 ± 1.56 kg) were placed into individual metabolism crates for assessment of GE, lipid, and N digestibility and N retention. Urinary lactulose to mannitol ratio was assessed to evaluate in vivo small intestinal integrity, and urine and plasma were collected to analyze for markers of oxidative stress. Pigs were subsequently euthanized to obtain liver weights and analyze the liver for markers of oxidative stress. In experiment 1, pigs fed the SO thermally processed at 90 °C had reduced ADG (P = 0.01) and ADFI (P = 0.04) compared to pigs fed the other SO treatment groups, with no differences noted among pigs fed the 22.5 °C, 45 °C, and 180 °C SO treatments. No effects of feeding thermally processing SO on dietary GE or lipid digestibility (P > 0.10) were noted in either experiment. In experiment 2, there was no dietary effect of feeding peroxidized SO on the DE:ME ratio, N digestibility, or N retained as a percent of N digested, on the urinary ratio of lactulose to mannitol, on serum, urinary, or liver thiobarbituric acid reactive substances, on plasma protein carbonyls, or on urinary or liver 8-OH-2dG (P > 0.10). In experiment 2, pigs fed the SO thermally processed at 90 °C had the greatest isoprostane concentrations in the serum (P ≤ 0.01) and urine (P ≤ 0.05) compared to pigs fed the unprocessed SO. These results indicate that the change in fatty acid composition and/or the presence of lipid peroxidation products in peroxidized SO may reduce ADG and ADFI in nursery pigs, but appears to have no impact on GE, lipid, or N digestibility, or gut permeability. These data suggest that the presence of lipid peroxidation products may affect certain markers of oxidative stress.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Rice bran oil (RBO) contains significant amounts of micronutrients (oryzanol, tocotrienol, tocopherol, phytosterols etc.) that impart a high resistance to thermal oxidation of the oil. The high oxidative stability of RBO can make it a preferred oil to improve the oxidative and flavor stabilities of other oils rich in PUFAs. In this study, the changes in the oxidative status and fatty acid composition in soybean oil (SO) blended with RBO under extreme thermal conditions were evaluated. METHODS: The blends were prepared in a volume ratio of 10:90, 20:80, 40:60, and 60:40 (RBO:SO). The changes in the oxidative parameters and fatty acid composition of the samples during heating at frying temperature (170&deg;C) were determined using analytical and instrumental methods. Oxidative alteration was also monitored by recording FTIR spectra of oil samples. RESULTS: The increase in oxidative parameters (free fatty acid, color, specific extinctions, peroxide value, p-anisidine value, and thiobarbituric acid value) was greater in pure SO as compared to RBO or blend oils during heating. This indicates that the SO samples incorporated with RBO have the least degradation, while pure SO has the highest. Blending resulted in a lower level of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA)&nbsp; with&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a higher level of saturated fatty acids (SFA) and monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA). During heating, the relative content of PUFA decreased and that of SFA increased. However, the presence of RBO in SO slowed down the oxidative deterioration of PUFA. In FTIR, the peak intensities in SO were markedly changed in comparison with blend oils during heating. The reduction in the formation of oxidative products in SO during thermal treatment increased as the concentration of the RBO in SO increased; however, the levels of the protective effect of RBO did not increase steadily with an increase in its concentration. CONCLUSIONS: During thermal treatment, the generation of hydroperoxides, their degradation and formation of secondary oxidative products as evaluated by oxidative indices, fatty acids and IR absorbances were lower in blend oils compared to pure SO. In conclusion, RBO can significantly retard the process of lipid peroxidation in SO during heating at frying temperature.",

Thirty-one patients with MS were randomly allocated to receive 30 sachets with 10 mL each of either BNO (n = 15) or SO (n = 16) for daily supplementation. Variables were measured at the beginning of the study and after 30 days of intervention. No change in anthropometric and blood pressure variables were observed (p > 0.05).

High-density lipoprotein cholesterol decreased (p = 0.0087) and triglycerides increased (p = 0.0045) in the BNO group. Malondialdehyde levels decreased in the BNO group (p = 0.0296) and total antioxidant capacity improved in the SO group (p = 0.0110). Although the addition of oils without lifestyle interventions did not affect anthropometric findings or blood pressure and promoted undesirable results in the lipid profile in both groups, daily supplementation of BNO for 30 days decreased lipid peroxidation, contributing to oxidative stress reduction.",

The present study aimed to evaluate the effects of other common oils on CCl4 induced LF. Healthy male ICR mice were administered with CCl4 intraperitoneally at 2.5 ml/kg twice a week for total 3 weeks. Mice were pre-treated with olive oil, soybean oil, corn oil or lard oil. After treatment, histopathological changes were observed using Masson trichrome staining, and alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), malondialdehyde (MDA), hydroxyproline (HYP) and triglyceride (TG) were measured by commercial kits. The expression of LF related genes was detected by quantitative real-time PCR. We found that soybean oil or olive oil significantly reduced ALT and AST levels in serum, and MDA, HYP and TG levels in the liver, compared with corn oil or lard oil. Moreover, Masson trichrome staining and real-time PCR showed that the mice treated with CCl4 dissolved in soybean oil or olive oil had less fibrosis and apoptosis in the liver comparted to the mice treated with CCl4 dissolved in corn oil or lard oil. In conclusion, soybean oil but not corn or lard oil exerts protective effects against CCl4 induced LF in mice, possibly due to its antioxidant activity.",

A total of 64 steers were enrolled in this study over 2 yr (32 steers per year), with 4 periods each year: creep-feeding (CF; day 0 to 60), preweaning (day 61 to weaning on day 124 and 127 of year 1 and 2, respectively), preconditioning (PC; day 132 to 172 in year 1 and day 135 to 175 of year 2), and feedlot (feedlot arrival to slaughter, day 173 to 378 in year 1 and day 176 to 385 in year 2). On day 0 steers were ranked by body weight (BW) and age (114 ± 4 kg of BW; 66.1 ± 0.9 d of age) and allocated to 1 of 16 pens. Pens were randomly assigned to receive CSSO during CF (80 g/d per steer) and/or PC (150 g/d per steer) in a 2 × 2 factorial arrangement of treatments. During CF and PC, nonsupplemented steers (CON) were provided an isolipidic prilled saturated fat supplement. Steer BW was recorded on day 0, 60, at weaning, and prior to feedlot shipping. Carcass traits were recorded upon slaughter. On day 0, 60, at weaning, prior to feedlot shipping, and during the feedlot period, blood samples were collected and longissimus muscle (LM) biopsies were collected. On day 60, steers that received CSSO during CF had greater (P < 0.01) plasma concentrations of linoleic and ω-6 compared with CON (CF treatment × day; P ≤ 0.05). Steers that received CSSO during PC had greater (P < 0.01) plasma concentrations of linoleic, ω-6, and total fatty acids compared with CON at feedlot shipping (PC treatment × day; P ≤ 0.05). A PC treatment × day interaction was also detected (P = 0.04) for mRNA expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-γ), which was greater (P = 0.04) at feedlot shipping for steers receiving CSSO during PC. Interactions between CF treatment × day were detected (P ≤ 0.01) for mRNA expression of adipocyte fatty acid-binding protein, fatty acid synthase, PPAR-γ, and stearoyl-CoA desaturase, which were greater (P ≤ 0.02) in the feedlot in steers receiving CSSO during CF. No treatment differences were detected for (P ≥ 0.18) performance or carcass traits, including marbling and backfat thickness. Results from this study suggest that supplementing CSSO to suckled beef steers via creep-feeding upregulated mRNA expression of the adipogenic genes investigated herein later in life. These outcomes, however, were not translated into improved carcass quality.",

In order to solve the problems of high cost and difficulties in practical application of SCO catalyst, it was put forward using the solid waste sludge from soybean oil plant as catalyst carrier to prepare denitration catalyst. The sludge was treated by alkaline activation and then MnOx-based sludge was prepared by impregnation. Finally, MnOx-based sludge was calcined in the muffle furnace. The effects of activation and calcination conditions on catalyst activity were investigated. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were used to characterize the activity of the sludge based denitration catalyst, and the structure and activity of the sludge based denitration catalyst were furtherly confirmed. According to the achieved results, (1) after activated by LiOH with a mass concentration of 15% for 4 hours, the surface of the sludge catalyst has more alkali functional groups, making the denitration of sludge catalyst the best; (2) the MnOx-based catalyst calcined in the muffle furnace with calcination temperature of 450 °C for 4 hours has obvious denitration efficiency.",

Then, the bifunctionalized nanoliposomes were prepared and added to soybean oil for evaluating their effect on deferring the oxidation process. METHODS: The total phenol and antioxidant activity of the extracts was determined by using the free radical scavenging assay. Then, various nanoliposomal structures of the methanolic extract of Persian clover sprout (PCSE) were prepared by using six several formulations containing different ratios of soybean oil, lecithin and the extract. Afterward, the most stable nanoliposome was bifunctionalized by using WPC and pectin (PCSEN-W and PCSEN-WP, respectively). The size and zeta potential of nanoparticles were measured. Furthermore, in order to evaluate the effects of PCSE, PCSEN, PCSEN-W and PCSEN-WP at 100-300 ppm concentrations in deferring the oxidation process of soybean oil, the heat treatment tests were applied (PV and TBA) at 63 °C within a 20-day period. RESULTS: The methanolic extract had the highest level of total phenol and antioxidant activity. The results of creaming index and microencapsulation efficiency were exhibited that formulation containing 30% oil, 5% lecithin and 2% the extract was led to the production of the most stable nanoliposomal structure (PCSEN). The size of nanoparticles was in the range of 282.5-491.2 nm. Zeta potential of the samples was obtained in the range between - 56.9 and - 36.3 mV. Polydispersity index of them was ranged from 0.424 to 0.541. The results were confirmed the existence of stable nanoliposomal systems. The results of the PV and TBA values of the extracts in free and nanoliposomal forms were shown that the nanoliposomal forms had very good antioxidant activity against the oxidation process in soybean oil."

The objective of this study was to evaluate the potential of refined cottonseed oil (CSO) as a replacement for SBO in broiler diets. A total of 180 chickens at 1 d of age were randomly assigned to five treatments of six replicates. One treatment was the basal diet (control), and the other four experimental diets were formulated from the basal diet by replacing (w/w) 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100% of the SBO with refined CSO (only containing 0.2% cyclopropenoid fatty acids, and no free gossypol was detected). At the end of week 6, blood samples were obtained from the jugular vein and the breast muscle was aseptically isolated from two birds per replicate. The results showed that substitution of CSO for low-level SBO had no significant effect (p > 0.05) on broiler performance during the starter period (week 1-3), while 50% level of CSO inclusion significantly increased (p < 0.05) ADG and improved FCR compared with the control group during the finisher period (week 4-6). Broilers fed 100% CSO diets had lower (p < 0.05) levels of serum total protein (TP), albumin (ALB), cholesterol (CHO) concentrations, and serum alkaline phosphatase (AKP) activity than that of the control broilers. Furthermore, the serum antioxidant status appeared to be enhanced by CSO. Additionally, high levels of CSO (75 and 100%) significantly increased the proportions of C14:0 and C18:0 but decreased the proportions of C18:1n9t, C18:2n6c, and ∑ n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids in breast muscles of broilers. Overall, the SBO could be replaced with refined CSO up to 50% in diets for broilers without adversely affecting the performance, liver functions, and breast muscle fatty acid composition of these broilers."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Although home parenteral nutrition (HPN) is lifesaving for patients with chronic intestinal failure (IF), long-term use can be associated with complications such as infections, metabolic abnormalities, and IF-associated liver disease (IFALD). The key to treatment of many of these complications is prevention. Guidelines recommend avoidance of overfeeding, use of oral/enteral nutrition if possible, cyclic PN, and maintaining dose of soybean oil (SO) intravenous lipid emulsion (ILE) <1 g/kg/day as preventive strategies for IFALD. Additionally, with development of IFALD, ω-6/ω-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid ratio should be decreased in ILE. The newly available mixed-oil (MO) ILE offers such an opportunity; however, there is a paucity of long-term data available. METHODS: The current study reports our long-term experience with MO ILE use in HPN patients. RESULTS: Seventeen patients (8 female and 9 male) with an average age of 47 ± 12 years and median HPN duration of 4.6 years (1.1-32.1 years) have utilized MO ILE for >12 months after being transitioned from SO ILE because of intolerance. Use of MO ILE allowed an increase in ILE energy from 8% ± 8% to 22% ± 8% while reducing dextrose energy from 66% ± 8% to 54% ± 5%, maintaining stability in alkaline phosphatase and triglyceride levels, and achieving improvement in aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, total bilirubin, and α-tocopherol levels. CONCLUSION: In this HPN cohort with SO ILE intolerance, MO ILE was well tolerated and allowed an improvement in macronutrient composition while improving some liver parameters over a 12-month period.",

Oleaginous yeast Trichosporon fermentans can consume organic materials in SOR wastewater to synthesize microbial oil, which achieves the purpose of SOR wastewater resource utilization. The effective harvesting technology of oleaginous yeasts can improve the utilization efficiency. In this study, Paecilomyces sp. M2-1 with high flocculating activity was isolated. The flocculants produced by M2-1 (MBF2-1) include 75% (w/w) polysaccharides, rely on cations, and display the flocculation percentage of above 77% in the range of pH 2-11. Especially under alkaline conditions, the flocculation percentage can be kept above 97%. The results of scanning electron microscope observation and zeta potential measurements suggested that the bridging, net trapping, and sweeping were the main flocculation mechanism of MBF2-1. MBF2-1 could flocculate T. fermentans that was used to reduce the organic matter in SOR wastewater and to produce microbial oil. Under the optimum conditions, the flocculation percentage of MBF2-1 against T. fermentans from SOR wastewater can reach 95%. Fatty acid content percent in microbial oil from T. fermentans was not almost affected by flocculation of MBF2-1. Moreover, MBF2-1 can further remove 55% and 53% of COD and oil content in the fermented SOR wastewater, respectively. The properties and high flocculating percentage displayed by MBF2-1 indicated its potential application prospect in oleaginous yeast harvest and food industry wastewater treatment.",

Effect of AESO concentration, photoinitiator content and processing conditions on the performance of coated starch-based film was systematically investigated, in particular the effect of coating on moisture absorption, permeability and mechanical properties. The modified surface was characterized by scanning electronic microscopy and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The results showed that the moisture sensitivity of the starch-based sheets was reduced significantly since the crosslinked AESO acted as a hydrophobic layer. Moisture permeability was decreased more than 10 times after AESO treatment. It was found that the crosslinking density acted as one of the key factors, so even a very thin layer of AESO could achieve good water resistance.",

Lespedeza treatments were no additive (L) and inclusion of monensin (I) at 22 mg/kg DM (L-I), soybean oil at 3% (L-S), coconut oil at 3% (L-N), I and 3% soybean oil (L-I-S), I and 3% coconut oil (L-I-N), 1.5% soybean oil and 1.5% coconut oil (L-S-N), and I, 1.5% soybean oil, and 1.5% coconut oil (L-I-S-N). The experiment was 12 wk with two 6-wk periods. Gas exchange was determined in weeks 6 and 12, and other measures occurred in weeks 5 and 11. The control diet offered averaged 2.67% nitrogen, 43.8% neutral detergent fiber, and 8.8% acid detergent lignin, and the L diet offered averaged 2.03% nitrogen, 42.8% neutral detergent fiber, and 13.2% acid detergent lignin. There were no treatment × period interactions for digestibilities (P ≥ 0.770) or methane emission (P ≥ 0.324). There were differences (P < 0.001) between the control treatment and diets with lespedeza in intake of DM (1.46, 1.23, 1.30, 1.18, 1.32, 1.10, 1.02, 1.20, and 1.01 kg/d; SEM = 0.059), digestibility of OM (57.4%, 50.9%, 51.8%, 52.7%, 50.3%, 52.1%, 52.1%, 51.9%, and 49.8%; SEM = 1.42), and digestibility of nitrogen (59.1%, 31.2%, 32.5%, 37.1%, 31.6%, 38.3%, 30.4%, 38.4%, and 34.1% for control, L, L-I, L-S, L-N, L-I-S, L-I-N, L-S-N, and L-I-S-N, respectively; SEM = 2.21). Ruminal methane emission was less (P < 0.001) for diets with lespedeza than for the control in MJ/d (1.36, 0.76, 0.84, 0.71, 0.71, 0.66, 0.65, 0.68, and 0.68; SEM = 0.048) and relative to intake of gross energy (5.92%, 3.27%, 3.49%, 3.19%, 2.84%, 2.91%, 3.20%, 3.20%, and 3.27%; SEM = 0.165) and digestible energy (11.19%, 6.98%, 7.40%, 6.38%, 5.90%, 5.69%, 6.37%, 6.38%, and 6.70% for control, L, L-I, L-S, L-N, L-I-S, L-I-N, L-S-N, and L-I-S-N, respectively; SEM = 0.400). In conclusion, the magnitude of effect of condensed tannins from lespedeza and quebracho extract on ruminal methane emission by Alpine doelings did not diminish over time and was not markedly influenced by dietary inclusion of monensin, soybean oil, or coconut oil.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Intravenous soybean oil (SO) is a commonly used lipid emulsion for children with intestinal failure (IF); however, it is associated with IF-associated liver disease (IFALD). Studies have demonstrated that intravenous fish oil (FO) is an effective treatment for IFALD. However, there is a lack of long-term data on children who stop FO and resume SO. This study's objective was to investigate our institution's outcomes for children with IFALD treated with 6 months of FO and who then restarted SO. METHODS: Inclusion criteria for FO included children with IFALD. Parenteral nutrition (PN)-dependent children resumed SO after FO and were prospectively followed for 4.5 years or until death, transplant, or PN discontinuation. The primary outcome was the cumulative incidence rate (CIR) for cholestasis after FO. RESULTS: Forty-eight subjects received FO, and conjugated bilirubin decreased over time (-0.22 mg/dL/week; 95% confidence interval [CI]: -0.25, -0.19; P < .001). The CIR for cholestasis resolution after 6 months of FO was 71% (95% CI: 54%, 82%). Twenty-seven subjects resumed SO and were followed for a median of 16 months (range 3-51 months). While the CIR for enteral autonomy after 3 years of follow-up was 40% (95% CI: 17%, 26%), the CIR for cholestasis and transplant was 26% (95% CI: 8%, 47%) and 6% (95% CI: 0.3%, 25%), respectively. CONCLUSION: In this study, FO effectively treated cholestasis, and SO resumption was associated with cholestasis redevelopment in nearly one-fourth of subjects. Long-term FO may be warranted to prevent end-stage liver disease.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The release of refined soybean oil wastewater (RSOW) with a high chemical oxygen demand (COD) and oil content burdens the environment. The conversion of RSOW into lipids by oleaginous yeasts may be a good way to turn this waste into usable products. RESULTS: The oleaginous yeast Trichosporon fermentans was used for treating the RSOW without sterilization, dilution, or nutrient supplementation. It was found that the COD and oil content of the RSOW were removed effectively; microbial oil was abundantly produced in 48 h; and the phospholipids in the RSOW tended to contribute to a higher biomass and microbial lipid content. With Plackett-Burman design and response surface design experiments, the optimal wastewater treatment conditions were determined: temperature 28.3 °C, amount of inoculum 5.9% (v/v), and initial pH 6.1. The optimized conditions were used in a 5-L bioreactor to treat the RSOW. The maximum COD degradation of 94.7% was obtained within 40 h, and the removal of the oil content was 89.9%. The biomass was 7.9 g/L, the lipid concentration was 3.4 g/L, and the lipid content was 43% (w/w). The microbial oil obtained, with a main component of unsaturated fatty acids, was similar to vegetable oils and was suggested as a potential raw material for biodiesel production. CONCLUSION: Trichosporon fermentans can be effectively used for RSOW treatment, and lipid production and can complete pretreatment and biochemical treatment simultaneously, allowing the utilization of RSOW, which both solves an environmental problem and positively impacts the use of resources. These results provide valuable information for developing and designing more efficient waste-into-lipid bioprocesses."

      "abstract": "At present, the most commonly used denitration process is the selective catalytic reduction (SCR) method. However, in the SCR method, the service life of the catalyst is short, and the industrial operation cost is high. The selective catalytic oxidation absorption (SCO) method can be used in a low temperature environment, which greatly reduces energy consumption and cost. The C/N ratio of the sludge produced in the wastewater treatment process of the soybean oil plant used in this paper is 9.64, while the C/N ratio of the sludge produced by an urban sewage treatment plant is 10⁻20. This study shows that the smaller the C/N ratio, the better the denitration efficiency of the catalyst. Therefore, dried oil sludge is used as a catalyst carrier. The influence of different activation times, and LiOH concentrations, on catalyst activity were investigated in this paper. The denitration performance of catalysts prepared by different activation sequences was compared. The catalyst was characterized by Fourier Transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and scanning electron microscope (SEM). The experimental results showed that: (1) When the concentration of the LiOH solution used for activation is 15%, and the activation time is four hours, the denitration effect of the catalyst is the best; (2) the catalyst prepared by activation before plasma roasting has the best catalytic activity."

      "abstract": "The objective of this study was to assess the impact of replacing pork backfat with rice bran wax oleogels on the organoleptic properties of frankfurter-type finely-comminuted sausages. Frankfurters were formulated using the following treatments as lipid replacement: 1) pork fat (PF); 2) soybean oil (SBO); 3) 2.5% rice bran wax oleogel (2.5 RBW); 4) 10% rice bran wax oleogel (10 RBW); and 5) 2.5% rice bran wax oleogel sheared less during frankfurter production (RBW/LS). In general, control PF was darker and redder than other treatments. TPA revealed oleogel treatments to be similar (P > .05) to pork fat treatment for firmness, chewiness, and springiness. Additionally, sensory evaluation revealed that replacing pork fat did not influence cured frankfurter aroma, but cured frankfurter flavor was significantly reduced (P < .05). Furthermore, lipid oxidation significantly (P < .05) differed between PF and 10 RBW. The results show that rice bran wax oleogels have the potential to successfully replace pork fat in comminuted products.",

      "abstract": "Ruminants have a unique metabolism and digestion of unsaturated fatty acids (UFA). Unlike monogastric animals, the fatty acid (FA) profile ingested by ruminants is not the same as that reaching the small intestine. The objective of this study was to evaluate whole raw soybeans (WS) in diets as a replacer for calcium salts of fatty acids (CSFA) in terms of UFA profile in the abomasal digesta of early- to mid-lactation cows. Eight Holstein cows (80 ± 20 d in milk, 22.9 ± 0.69 kg/d of milk yield, and 580 ± 20 kg of body weight; mean ± standard deviation) with ruminal and abomasal cannulas were used in a 4 × 4 Latin square experiment with 22-d periods. The experiment evaluated different fat sources rich in linoleic acid on ruminal kinetics, ruminal fermentation, FA abomasal flow, and milk FA profile of cows assigned to treatment sequences containing a control (CON), with no fat source; soybean oil, added at 2.68% of diet dry matter (DM); WS, addition of WS at 14.3% of diet DM; and CSFA, addition of CSFA at 2.68% of diet DM. Dietary fat supplementation had no effect on nutrient intake and digestibility, with the exception of ether extract. Cows fed fat sources tended to have lower milk fat concentration than those fed CON. In general, diets containing fat sources tended to decrease ruminal neutral detergent fiber digestibility in relation to CON. Cows fed WS had lower ruminal digestibility of DM and higher abomasal flow of DM in comparison to cows fed CSFA. As expected, diets containing fat supplements increased FA abomasal flow of C18:0 and total FA. Cows fed WS tended to present a higher concentration of UFA in milk when compared with those fed CSFA. This study suggests that under some circumstances, abomasal flow of UFA in early lactation cows can be increased by supplementing their diet with fat supplements rich in linoleic acid, regardless of rumen protection, with small effects on ruminal DM digestibility.",

      "abstract": "Consumption of peroxidized lipids has been shown to reduce pig performance and energy and lipid digestibility. Objectives of the current study were to evaluate the effect of feeding soybean oil (SO) with different levels of peroxidation on growth performance, lipid, N, and GE digestibility, plasma Trp, and gut integrity in finishing pigs. Fifty-six barrows (46.7 ± 5.1 kg initial BW) were randomly assigned to one of four diets in each of two dietary phases, containing either 10% fresh SO (22.5 °C) or thermally processed SO (45 °C for 288 h, 90 °C for 72 h, or 180 °C for 6 h), each infused with of 15 L/min of air. Peroxide values were 2.0, 17.4, 123.6, and 19.4 mEq/kg; 2,4-decadienal values were 2.07, 1.90, 912.15, and 915.49 mg/kg; and 4-hydroxynonenal concentrations were 0.66, 1.49, 170.48, and 82.80 mg/kg, for the 22.5, 45, 90, and 180 °C processed SO, respectively. Pigs were individually housed and fed ad libitum for 81 d to measure growth performance, including a metabolism period to collect urine and feces for determination of GE, lipid, N digestibility, and N retention. Following the last day of fecal and urine collection when pigs were in the metabolism crates, lactulose and mannitol were fed and subsequently measured in the urine to evaluate gut permeability, while markers of oxidative stress were evaluated in plasma, urine, and liver. There were no differences observed in ADFI (P = 0.91), but average daily gain (ADG) and gain:feed G:F were decreased in pigs fed 90 °C SO diet (P ≤ 0.07) compared to pigs fed the other SO diets. Pigs fed the 90 and 180 °C SO had the lowest (P = 0.05) DE as a % of GE compared to pigs fed the 22.5 °C SO, with pigs fed the 45 °C SO being intermediate. Lipid digestibility was similarly affected (P = 0.01) as energy digestibility, but ME as a % of DE was not affected by dietary treatment (P = 0.16). There were no effects of lipid peroxidation on N digested, N retained, or the urinary lactulose:mannitol ratio (P ≥ 0.25). Pigs fed the SO processed at 90 and 180 °1C had lower concentrations (P < 0.01) of plasma Trp compared to pigs fed the 22.5 and 45 °C SO treatments. Pigs fed 90 °C SO had the greatest (P < 0.01) concentrations of F2-isoprostane in plasma and urine thiobarbituric acid reactive substances compared to the other SO treatments. These results indicate that the change in FA composition and/or the presence of lipid peroxidation products in peroxidized SO may reduce ADG, G:F, and digestibility of GE and ether extract, but has little impact on N digestibility and balance or on gut permeability.",

Omega-6 reducing strategies may improve outcomes, including reduced PN associated liver disease, however evidence to support this recommendation is insufficient. The primary objective was to compare serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP), among patients provided with either soybean oil (Intralipid) or predominantly olive oil (Clinoleic) lipid emulsions. In this quasi-experimental study, we reviewed the medical records of surgical and medical adult patients who received lipid emulsions for at least seven consecutive days. Among the 206 patients (110-Intralipid, 96-Clinoleic) there was no significant difference in ALP and remaining liver function tests within 2 weeks of PN therapy initiation between groups, even after control for lipid doses. Macronutrient dosing was similar. Triglyceride level was higher by 0.7 mmol/L in the Clinoleic group; confidence interval 0.21 to 1.1; p = 0.004. The 30-day mortality, length of hospital stay, and proportion of patients admitted to intensive care were not significantly different. The Clinoleic group had a higher infection rate (36% vs. 22%, p = 0.031) and longer intensive care stays (p = 0.045). Well-designed randomized clinical trials comparing these lipid emulsions are necessary to confirm Intralipid superiority over Clinoleic in relation to infections and serum triglycerides.",

After AI, groups were assigned randomly to receive (as-fed basis) 100 g of ground corn + 100 g of soybean meal per cow/d, in addition to 1) 100 g/cow daily of CSSO (n = 11) or 2) 87 g of prilled saturated fat + 13 g of limestone per cow/d (CON; n = 11).

Cows receiving CSSO had greater (P = 0.01) pregnancy rates to timed AI compared with CON (60.2 vs. 51.7%; SEM = 4.2). In Exp. 2, 90 suckled, lactating, multiparous Angus × Hereford cows housed in 18 drylot pens (5 cows per pen) were assigned to the same timed AI program and treatments from Exp. 1 (9 pens per treatment) and received 20 kg/d (DM basis) of grass-alfalfa hay. Transrectal ultrasonography was performed to verify ovulation and corpus luteum (CL) volume before AI (day 0), on days 7 and 15. After ultrasonography on day 15, cows diagnosed without a CL on day 0, but with a CL greater than 0.38 cm3 in volume on days 7 and 15 (2 or 3 cows per pen; CSSO, n = 20; CON, n = 24), were assigned to conceptus collection via transcervical flushing and endometrial biopsy in the uterine horn ipsilateral to the CL. Blood samples were collected for FA analysis on days 0, 7, and 15. Blood was collected from cows not assigned to conceptus collection for whole-blood RNA extraction on day 20 and for pregnancy diagnosis on day 30 by measuring concentrations of pregnancy-associated glycoproteins. Cows receiving CSSO had greater (P ≤ 0.04) mean plasma concentrations of linoleic acid and ω-6 FA compared with CON on days 7 and 15. Moreover, CSSO supplementation increased (P = 0.05) mRNA expression of interferon-tau by the conceptus and blood mRNA expression of interferon-stimulated gene 15 and 20,50-oligoadenylate synthetase on day 20 in gestating cows. Hence, post-AI CSSO supplementation to B. taurus beef cows improved pregnancy rates to timed AI, which can be associated with increased mRNA expression of interferon-tau by the conceptus when CSSO is supplemented during early gestation.",

      "abstract": "Two hundred and sixteen 28-wk-old Hy-line laying hens were randomly distributed to three dietary treatments and fed 1of 3 diets containing 8% soybean oil, fish oil, or coconut oil from 28 to 47 wk of age to investigate comparative effect of dietary soybean oil, fish oil, and coconut oil on the performance, egg quality and blood malondialdehyde (MDA), aspartate transaminase (AST) and uric acid (UA). Hens fed fish oil showed poor performance compared with soybean oil or coconut oil, and especially egg weight throughout the trial was significantly and consistently decreased (P < 0.05) due to dietary fish oil. Unexpectedly, shell reflectivity throughout the majority of the trial was consistently and significantly higher (P < 0.05) when hens fed fish oil than that when fed soybean oil or coconut oil. Dietary treatments affected (P < 0.05) shell shape at 4 of 8 time points tested. Average shell shape in fish oil treatment was higher (P < 0.05) than that of coconut oil group. Albumen height, Haugh unit and yolk color were influenced by dietary treatments only at 1 or 2 time points. However, average albumen height and Haugh unit in fish oil treatment were higher (P < 0.05) than that of soybean oil or coconut oil treatments and average yolk color in coconut oil treatment was higher (P < 0.05) than that of soybean oil group. Serum MDA, AST and UA concentrations were increased (P < 0.05) by fish oil during the majority of the first 2 mo of the trial. These data suggested that the inclusion of fish oil into feed may reduce the performance of laying hens, especially the egg weight, decrease the intensity of egg brown color and increase blood MDA, AST and UA levels compared with soybean oil or coconut oil. As a result, hens fed fish oil may lay smaller, longer and lighter-brown eggs whereas those fed coconut oil produce blunter and darker-brown eggs relative to soybean oil.",
