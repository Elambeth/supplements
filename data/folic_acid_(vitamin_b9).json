      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The folic acid is used as an adjuvant dietary supplement in cancer treatment, but its potential benefits or adverse effects in lung cancer (LC) management remain unclear. This study aimed to examine the relationship between different forms of folic acid and LC based on a national population-based survey and conduct a thorough analysis of the potential use of folic acid in cancer treatment. METHODS: Cross-sectional analysis from the 2007-2018 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) was assessed. A cohort of 27,631 participants was identified and weighted. Information on folic acid levels and malignancy was determined through laboratory tests and interviews. To address potential confounding variables, a 1:2 propensity score matching (PSM) was employed, and 201 participants were included. This study utilized restricted cubic splines (RCS) to explore the none-linear relationship between various forms of folic acid and the incidence of LC. RESULTS: Significant associations were observed between clinical characteristics of the participants and LC in both unweighted and weighted analyses. Following PSM, total folate, dietary folate, 5-formyltetrahydrofolate (5-formylTHF) and 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate (5,10-methenylTHF) were significantly associated with LC risk (p < 0.05). The RCS analysis suggested that there was a significant non-linear association between 5,10-methenylTHF and the odds of developing LC. Additionally, total folate, folic acid, 5,10-methenylTHF, and RBC folate influenced the likelihood of developing LC in a certain dose range. CONCLUSIONS: The development of LC was associated with total folate, dietary folate, 5-formylTHF and 5,10-methenylTHF levels. Folic acid, total folate, 5,10-methenylTHF, and RBC folate were positively correlated with LC within a certain range.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: A combination of FOLFOX and nivolumab is a first-line treatment for HER2-negative advanced gastric cancer, significantly improving survival. However, this regimen is associated with potential neurotoxicity. 5-Fluorouracil and oxaliplatin in FOLFOX have been linked to optic neuropathy, whereas nivolumab, an immune checkpoint inhibitor, may cause immune-related optic neuropathy. Although FOLFOX plus nivolumab provides considerable survival benefits, careful monitoring for ocular complications is essential. We report a case of bilateral optic neuropathy in a patient who received FOLFOX plus nivolumab. Despite discontinuation of chemotherapy and treated with high-dose corticosteroid pulse therapy, the patient's symptoms did not improve. CASE PRESENTATION: A 48-year-old woman with a Krukenberg tumor developed progressive bilateral visual impairment during treatment with FOLFOX plus nivolumab. Her ophthalmologic history included branch retinal vein occlusion in the right eye but no systemic diseases. She presented with bilateral central scotomas and visual field defects. On examination, best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was 20/40 in the right eye and 20/25 in the left eye, with bilateral optic disc swelling and hemorrhage. Fluorescein angiography confirmed optic disc leakage, and a visual evoked potential (VEP) test indicated axonal loss. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) ruled out metastatic disease, and autoimmune markers were negative. High-dose intravenous methylprednisolone was administered, and chemotherapy was discontinued. Despite initial stabilization, vision deteriorated, ultimately progressing to light perception in both eyes. Repeated steroid pulse therapy failed to improve outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: This case highlights the potential for severe bilateral optic neuropathy associated with FOLFOX plus nivolumab, leading to irreversible vision loss. These findings suggest that close ophthalmologic monitoring is warranted in patients receiving FOLFOX plus nivolumab for early recognition of bilateral visual impairment. Further research is needed to elucidate the mechanisms and identify agents responsible for the development of optic neuropathy.",

      "abstract": "Ovarian cancer is the most prevalent fatal, gynecological malignancy in women, resulting poor survival rate (5th in cancer deaths) owing to its asymptomatic nature. The unmet medical challenges for ovarian cancer are associated with several limitations such as poor bioavailability, non-specificity and toxicity related issues. Targeted drug delivery systems may over come the existing limitations. Utilizing the concept of overexpression of folate receptors in the ovarian carcinoma, in the present study, we have designed folate receptor targeted drug delivery system(AgNNPs-FA) by the combination of silver nitroprusside nanoparticles (AgNNPs) because of its inherant anti-cancer property as established by our group and folic acid (FA) as targeting agent that target folate receptors. Initially, both and AgNNPs and AgNNPs-FA were designed and later characterized using several analytical tools such as DLS, XRD, SEM, TEM,TGA,HPLC and FTIR etc. The in vitro cell viability assay in CHO cell line suggests the biocompatible nature of AgNNPs-FA. The targeted anticancer activity of the AgNNPs-FA is established in human ovarian adenocarcinoma (SK-OV-3) through several in vitro assays and compared with AgNNPs. All in vitro assays (cell viability assay, thymidine incorporation assay, scratch assay, cell cycle, apoptosis assay, tunnel assay) in SK-OV-3 and in vivo experiment (CAM assay) in fertilized eggs with AgNNPs-FA shows more anti-cancer activity in targeted fashion than that of AgNNPs. The plausible mechanisms behind the anti-cancer activity of the nanoparticles were demonstrated through ROS assay (DCFDA and DHE staining), JC-1 staining, immunocytochemistry staining (Ki-67) and Western blot analysis. The results altogether support that these targeted drug delivery system could be used as an alternative treatment strategy for ovarian cancer and other cancer having overexpression of folate receptors."

      "abstract": "Bell's palsy, a unilateral peripheral facial nerve palsy, is one of the most common acute mononeuropathies. Chronic cases persisting beyond one year present significant challenges to conventional treatment methods. Standard treatment includes steroids and antiviral medications in the acute phase, and physical therapy, various supplements such as vitamin B12 and folic acid supplementation, and injections for chronic therapy. This case report describes the effect of a unique treatment, dextrose-based Lyftogt perineural injection therapy (LPIT), in a 22-year-old Filipino male with left-sided peripheral facial nerve palsy. His condition had persisted for a duration of 13 months and was refractory to standard management. LPIT was delivered at chronic constriction points and endpoints of the facial nerve in ten different sessions. The mechanism of LPIT involves addressing glycopenia in affected nerves, reducing neurogenic inflammation, and facilitating nerve repair by enhancing the flow of nerve growth factors. Following treatment, marked improvement was observed in the functional muscle strength of the left occipitofrontalis, zygomaticus, and buccinator muscles, progressing from weak functional to functional. This case underscores LPIT's potential as an adjunct therapy for chronic Bell's palsy, adding to the limited but a growing body of evidence supporting its role in managing neuropathic conditions."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Targeted delivery of anticancer drugs holds great promise for enhancing therapeutic efficacy while minimizing adverse effects. The folate receptor (FR)-mediated approach offers a selective strategy to target cancer cells overexpressing FR. Bleomycin, an established antitumor antibiotic, suffers from limited efficacy due to poor diffusion into tumor cells. This study examined the anti-cancer potential of folate-targeted liposomal Bleomycin (FL-BLEOMYCIN) in comparison to non-targeted L-BLEOMYCIN on oral cavity cancer (CAL27). The study also investigated FL-Bleomycin's capacity to halt the cell cycle in the G2/M phase using flow cytometry. METHODS: FL-Bleomycin was produced using thin-layer hydration, followed by incorporation of folic acid into nanoliposomes. To evaluate the release profile, drug release tests were carried out. Cytotoxicity of FL-Bleomycin, L-Bleomycin, and traditional Bleomycin was evaluated using cell viability assays. The cell cycle arrest caused by FL-Bleomycin was examined using flow cytometry. Finally, FL-Bleomycin uptake studies were performed to assess the internalization of FL-Bleomycin by CAL27 cells. RESULTS: Compared to L-Bleomycin and traditional Bleomycin, FL-Bleomycin showed noticeably more cytotoxicity against CAL 27 cells. The effective arrest of CAL 27 cells in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle by FL-Bleomycin was verified by flow cytometry. Uptake studies revealed increased internalization of FL-Bleomycin by CAL 27 cells compared to standard formulations. Drug release studies showed a consistent, non-explosive release profile. Cells treated with these nanoliposomes, compared to control groups, exhibited a dose-dependent decrease in the intensity of the 170-kDa EGF-R band as observed by Western blot analysis. DISCUSSION: The findings suggest that FL-Bleomycin is a potential method for delivering drugs precisely in tumors expressing folic acid receptors. Its potential for successful cancer treatment is shown by its higher internalization, improved cytotoxicity, and cell cycle prevention in CAL 27 cells. To find out how effective FL-Bleomycin is in vivo and whether it may be used to treat other FR-expressing tumors, more research is necessary."

Characterising the micronutrient, metabolomic and microbiome profiles of pregnant women and infants may elucidate the underlying biology of adverse birth outcomes and early child development in the first 1000 days. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The Enhancing Nutrition and Antenatal Infection Treatment (ENAT) study was a 2×2 factorial, randomised clinical effectiveness study conducted in Amhara, Ethiopia from August 2020 to June 2022. We cluster-randomised pregnant women (n=2399) to receive either a nutrition intervention (iron-folic acid (IFA), iodised salt and balanced energy-protein supplementation for women with mid-upper arm circumference <23 cm) or routine care (IFA only), and individually randomised women to an infection control intervention (genitourinary tract infection screening-treatment and screening-treatment of stool parasites) or routine care (syndromic approach). Participants were followed until 1 month postpartum. A subset of 532 women-infant dyads were consecutively enrolled in the biospecimen substudy from July 2021 to August 2022. Specimens were collected at enrolment (<24 weeks) and antenatal care follow-up (third trimester), and 1-6 months postdelivery. A subset of ENAT mother-infant dyads (n=462) was enrolled in the Longitudinal Infant Development and Growth study that followed infants until 24 months postpartum, from February 2023 to June 2024. We will determine the impact of ENAT interventions on micronutrient status, inflammation biomarkers and metabolomic and microbiome profiles. We will also determine the association of these profiles with birth outcomes and infant neurodevelopment. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: These studies were approved by the Institutional Review Boards of Addis Continental Institute of Public Health (ACIPH/IRB/002/2022) and Mass General Brigham (2023P000461). Results will be disseminated to international stakeholders via peer-reviewed journals and locally via strategic dissemination sessions. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBERS: ISRCTN15116516 and NCT06296238.",

PATIENTS AND METHODS: The data were collected through a retrospective review of electronic patient journals. The initial cohort consisted of 163 patients coded with ICD10-C25 pancreatic cancer at Nordland hospital trust from January 2021 till August 2023. A total of 113 patients were included, of whom 86 had histologically or cytologically confirmed pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, while 27 were diagnosed based on radiological findings. RESULTS: The most common first-line chemotherapy regimen was nab-paclitaxel/gemcitabine, followed by FOLFIRINOX. The median survival was 4.0 months for all patients, 15.1 months for surgical patients, 7.0 months for patients treated with chemotherapy, and 1.5 months for patients who did not receive any treatment. Eight patients (18%) received chemotherapy during the last 30 days of life. All were treated with nab-paclitaxel/gemcitabine as first-line therapy, with an average of 0.75 treatment courses administered. Six of these patients were affiliated with small local hospitals without an oncologist present, and five were aged 75 years or older. CONCLUSION: Our findings largely align with the 2022 report from the Norwegian Quality Registry, though some deviations are observed due to better coverage and more detailed patient information in our study. The slightly shorter survival rates may reflect the inclusion of radiologically diagnosed patients. To establish treatment in the last 30 days of life as a quality indicator and support longitudinal quality improvement, further in-depth analysis of at-risk patients is needed.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND/AIM: As the pathophysiology of Microminipigs (μMPs) is similar to that of human, μMPs are useful in atherosclerosis research. To clarify the effect of methotrexate (MTX) on atherosclerosis, we investigated the pathology of MTX-induced atherosclerosis lesion exacerbation in μMPs fed a high-fat and high-cholesterol diet (HFHCD). MATERIALS AND METHODS: The μMPs were divided into four groups: HFHCD, HFHCD+MTX, HFHCD+MTX+leucovorin (LV), and HFHCD+MTX+folic acid (FA), and fed for two weeks. Laboratory tests including blood lipid, FA, and homocysteine (Hcy) levels, and pathological evaluation of the atherosclerosis lesion area and thickness were performed. Hepatic and jejunal gene expressions related to lipid and folate metabolism pathways including 5-methyltetrahydrofolate-homocysteine methyltransferase (MTR) were monitored using RT-PCR. RESULTS: The HFHCD+MTX group showed increased blood Hcy (p<0.01) and decreased FA levels (p<0.05) in accordance with increased hepatic MTR mRNA expression (p<0.1) and exacerbation of atherosclerosis (p=0.051 for lesion area and p=0.045 for lesion thickness) compared to the HFHCD group. Administration of LV or FA attenuated the MTX-induced increase in the Hcy level (p<0.01), atherosclerosis lesion thickness (p<0.1), and MTR mRNA expression (p<0.1 in HFHCD+MTX vs. HFHCD+MTX+LV groups). CONCLUSION: MTX exacerbated HFHCD-induced atherosclerosis mediated through reduced blood FA and the subsequent increase of Hcy in μMPs, indicating that the μMP model may advance cardio-oncology research by providing useful experimental approaches. As MTX is administered for rheumatoid arthritis and malignant tumors in humans, atherosclerosis exacerbation should be acknowledged as a possible adverse effect of MTX treatment.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: This in vitro study aimed to investigate the impact of folic acid on DNA methylation and gene expression in adipocytes from subcutaneous adipose tissue of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), with a focus on the influence of obesity on these epigenetic changes. METHODS: Tissue biopsies were collected from patients with normal weight (NW) and obesity (OBS). Adipocytes were isolated via enzymatic digestion and density separation. Each group was divided into control (standard medium) and folic acid treatment (2 mg/24 h for 48 h) conditions. After treatment, DNA methylation levels were analyzed using the Infinium Methylation EPIC v2.0 Kit, and gene expression analyses were performed by RT-qPCR. A pathway enrichment analysis was conducted using the KEGG database for functional insight. RESULTS: Folic acid induced differential methylation at 755 CpG sites in NW adipocytes, which were associated with immune regulation, including MAPK signaling. Also, OBS adipocytes showed methylation changes at 92 CpG sites, affecting pathways related to metabolic regulation, such as cAMP signaling. LEP gene expression was upregulated (5.2-fold) in OBS adipocytes, while CREM2 expression was increased (2.8-fold) in NW adipocytes after treatment. These gene expression differences underscore weight-dependent responses to folic acid, with LEP upregulation in OBS cells suggesting links to metabolic dysregulation and CREM2 upregulation in NW cells potentially contributing to immune modulation. CONCLUSIONS: Folic acid treatment exerts distinct epigenetic and gene expression effects in adipocytes of SLE patients, modulated by obesity status. This weight-dependent response, marked by changes in pathways relevant to immune and metabolic function, highlights the need for further investigation into how nutrient-based interventions might support SLE management. From a clinical perspective, this study underscores the potential of targeted nutrient-based interventions to address immunometabolic dysfunctions in SLE patients. Further research could explore folic acid supplementation as a complementary approach to personalized treatment strategies, particularly for patients with obesity.",

      "abstract": "Elevated levels of homocysteine (Hcy) are associated with various health outcomes. We aimed to systematically assess the credibility and certainty of evidence of associations of Hcy and Hcy-lowering therapies with various health outcomes. We retrieved observational meta-analyses examining the associations between Hcy and health outcomes, interventional meta-analyses investigating health outcomes related to Hcy-lowering treatments, and Mendelian Randomization (MR) studies exploring the causal associations of Hcy with health outcomes to perform an umbrella review. A total of 135 observational meta-analyses, 106 MR studies, and 26 interventional meta-analyses were included. Among observational studies, 10 associations of diseases/outcomes were classified as highly suggestive; only one outcome (digestive tract cancer) was supported by convincing evidence (class I; OR=1.27, 95% CI=1.16-1.40; P=6.79×10-7; I2=0, 95% prediction interval excluding null, >1000 cases; P>0.1 for tests of both small-study effects and excess significance bias). In MR studies, 5 outcomes associated with Hcy presented robust evidence (P<0.01, power>80%). Among 25 outcomes explored by both observational meta-analyses and MR studies, 7 had consistent results, indicating that elevated Hcy is causally associated with an increased risk for these outcomes. The 3 types of studies collectively suggested that the association of stroke with Hcy was supported by observational studies, causally by MR studies, and further validated by intervention meta-analyses showing that Hcy-lowering with folic acid significantly reduced risk of stroke. For dementia and colorectal cancer, Hcy was significantly associated in meta-analyses of observational studies and folic acid decreased disease risks in interventional meta-analyses. The current umbrella review indicates that convincing evidence for a definitive role of Hcy exposure solely exists in the context of digestive tract cancer excluding bias; however, Hcy may not be causal for this disease. All the three type of studies collectively support that Hcy is a key causal risk factor, and Hcy-lowering (specifically with folic acid) may serve as an effective intervention for stroke. REGISTRATION PROSPERO: CRD42024541335 STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Previous systematic reviews has not been summarized and appraised evidence of meta-analyses of observational and interventional studies, and Mendelian randomization studies on associations of homocysteine or homocysteine-lowering with a range of diseases (outcomes). Our umbrella review takes full advantage of the respective strengths of meta-analyses and MR studies by combining and comparing the findings to explore and assess the potential importance and implications of homocysteine for clinical practice and public health."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Obesity is a global health issue, and in this context, bariatric surgery is considered the most effective treatment for severe cases. However, postoperative outcomes vary widely among individuals, driving the development of tools to predict body weight loss success. The main objective of this paper is to evaluate predictive variables for successful weight loss one year after Sleeve bariatric surgery, defining success as a weight loss exceeding 30%. METHODS: A dataset of 94 cases was included in this study. Data were collected between 2013 and 2018 from the Nutrition Section of the Endocrinology and Nutrition Department in the Eastern Area of Valladolid, Spain. Machine learning algorithms applied included Random Forest, Multilayer Perceptron, XGBoost, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machines (SVMs). RESULTS: The SVM model demonstrated the best performance, attaining an accuracy of 88% and an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.76 with a 95% CI between 0.5238 and 0.9658. The main predictive variables identified were potassium (K), folic acid, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), height, transferrin, weight, body mass index (BMI), triglyceride (Tg), Beck Depression Test score, and insulin levels. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, this study highlights the potential of machine learning models, particularly Support Vector Machines (SVMs), in predicting successful weight loss after Sleeve bariatric surgery. The key predictive variables identified include biochemical markers, anthropometric measures, and psychological factors, emphasizing the multifactorial nature of postoperative weight loss outcomes.",

Despite bilateral basal ganglia necrosis and hemorrhage confirmed by CT and MRI, the patient maintained normal vision. Immediate treatment with sodium bicarbonate, hemodialysis, methylprednisolone, folic acid, and vitamin B1 resulted in consciousness recovery within 24 h and normalization of metabolic parameters. Ophthalmologic examination revealed mild right optic disc edema but preserved visual acuity (20/20), normal visual fields, and color vision. At 12-week follow-up, neurological function continued to improve with no visual deterioration. This case demonstrates selective basal ganglia vulnerability in methanol toxicity with sparing of the visual system. Emergency physicians should conduct comprehensive neurological evaluations in methanol poisoning cases regardless of visual symptoms and consider investigating protective mechanisms against methanol-induced optic neuropathy."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Nephrology II Decoction (NED), a compound from traditional Chinese medicine, has been used in the clinical treatment of chronic kidney disease (CKD) for a long time. However, the specific active ingredients and the mechanisms by which they operate are not yet fully understood. OBJECTIVE: The study aims to explore how NED eases CKD, with an emphasis on its influence on stimulator of interferon genes (STING)-mediated mitochondrial balance within kidney cells. METHODS: Various CKD mouse models, including folic acid nephropathy (FAN), unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO), and bilateral renal ischemia-reperfusion injury (bIRI), were administered with NED via oral gavage for three weeks. This study evaluated kidney function, pathological alterations, and fibrosis markers (fibronectin, collagen I, TGF-β, α-SMA) were assessed. Bulk RNA-sequencing of kidney tissues identified key targets, with molecular docking, dynamics simulations, and microscale thermophoresis were used to predict active components and pathways. These components and pathways were confirmed in renal tissues from CKD mice and renal tubular cells induced by folic acid. Additionally, oxidative stress induced by Tert‑butyl hydroperoxide (t-BHP) in HK2 cells was used to replicate CKD-induced renal fibrosis in vitro. RESULTS: NED significantly improved renal function, reduced pathological damage, and decreased fibrosis in mice with CKD. Bulk RNA-seq identified STING as a pivotal target, and molecular docking demonstrated a strong binding affinity between NED's active components and murine STING. NED inhibited the cGAS/STING/TBK1/IRF3/IFN-β pathway, thereby alleviating renal fibrosis. It also corrected defects in mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, diminished inflammatory responses, and reduced apoptosis in fibrotic kidneys. In vitro, NED prevented mitochondrial DNA leakage induced by t-BHP, preserved mitochondrial function, and suppressed STING activation. STING inhibitor C176 effectively reduced fibrosis in both FAN mice and folic acid -induced cells, whereas the STING agonist DMXAA intensified fibrosis. There were potential interactions observed when DMXAA was combined with NED. CONCLUSIONS: This study clarified the anti-fibrotic mechanisms of NED through the cGAS/STING pathway, highlighting STING as a primary target and the involvement of mitochondrial phosphorylation. NED appears to be a promising candidate for the treatment of CKD and reductions of renal fibrosis."

      "abstract": "Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune disorder characterized by persistent inflammation, joint swelling, pain, and progressive joint destruction. Methotrexate (MTX) is the standard first-line treatment for RA, but its clinical application is hindered by poor water solubility and non-specific delivery. In this work, a multifunctional drug-delivery nanoplatform that targets both macrophages and tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) is developed to enhance the therapeutic efficacy of MTX in RA. The nanoplatform consists of folic acid (FA, for macrophage targeting) and a TNFα-specific Aptamer (TNFα-Apt), facilitating a dual-targeting strategy that significantly improves the accumulation of MTX at the sites of RA lesions (≈3.5-fold). Moreover, the manganese dioxide (MnO₂) and polydopamine (PDA) coatings on the nanoplatform effectively scavenge reactive oxygen species (ROS), generate oxygen, and promote the polarization of pro-inflammatory M1 macrophages to the anti-inflammatory M2 macrophages. This shift in macrophage polarization restores the expression of key inflammatory cytokines, improving the local inflammatory microenvironment. Ultimately, the nanoplatform significantly ameliorates the inflammation and joint damage in a collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) model, suggesting that this multi-target combination therapy holds considerable potential for the treatment of RA in vivo."

      "abstract": "Activating a robust immune response is an effective strategy for achieving tumor eradication. In this study, copper-based metal-organic framework nanoparticles (referred to as FA-PZ@MOF NPs), which have the ability to simultaneously induce cuproptosis and pyroptosis in tumor cells, were designed to utilize the synergistic effects of cuproptosis and pyroptosis to trigger immunogenic cell death (ICD). This can inhibit tumor growth, migration, and metastasis while enabling efficient antitumor immunotherapy. The nano inducer targets hepatocellular carcinoma tumor cells via folic acid, dissociates and releases copper ions in the tumor microenvironment (TME), which has a high glutathione concentration, leading to copper ion overload, thereby mediating cuproptosis. Additionally, the released ZnO2 generates substantial amounts of H2O2 and Zn2+ in the acidic environment, enhancing the Cu2+-based Fenton-like reaction for chemokinetic therapy. This exacerbates the reactive oxygen species (ROS) storms and mitochondrial damage, and combined with the action of Polyphyllin VI (PPVI), induces pyroptosis and cuproptosis. This multilayered interaction strategy also triggers robust ICD while inhibiting hepatocellular carcinoma tumor metastasis and invasion."

      "abstract": "The advancement in exclusively tailored therapeutic delivery systems has escalated a great deal of interest in targeted delivery to augment therapeutic efficacy and to lessen adverse effects. The targeted delivery approach promisingly helps to surmount the unmet clinical needs of conventional therapies, including chemoresistance, limited penetration, and side effects. In the case of melanoma, various receptors were overexpressed on the tumor site, among which folate receptor (FR) targeting is considered to be a progressive approach for managing melanoma. FRs are the macromolecules of the glycosyl phosphatidylinositol-attached protein that possess globular assembly with a greater affinity toward specific ligands. So, the functional ligands can be utilized to design targeted nanocarriers (NCs) that can effectively bind to overexpressed FRs. Hence, folate-adorned NCs (FNCs) offer various benefits such as site-specific targeting, cargo protection, and minimizing toxicity. This review focuses on the insights and implications of FRs, targeting FRs, and mechanisms, challenges, and advantages of FNCs. Further, the applications of various FNCs, such as liposomes, polymeric NCs, albumin nanoparticles, inorganic NCs, liquid crystalline nanoparticles, and nanogels, have been elaborated for melanoma therapy. Likewise, the potential of FNCs in immunotherapy, photodynamic therapy, chemotherapy, gene therapy, photothermal therapy, and tumor imaging has been exhaustively discussed. Furthermore, translational hurdles and potential solutions are discussed in detail. The present review is expected to give thoughtful ideas to researchers, industry stakeholders, and formulation scientists for the efficacious development of FNCs."

An amalgamation of genetic, nutritional, and environmental factors plays a role in causing NTDs. They develop relatively early, within the first month of pregnancy-the time of neurulation, which could indicate that the pathogenesis of these diseases could stem from even pre-pregnancy causes like folic acid deficiency. This article provides an overview of the various etiology of NTDs and how they interact, as well as various preventive and curative measures like folic acid and inositol supplementation, stem cell transplant, and postnatal surgery. Identifying potential risk factors can help clinicians develop better management techniques beyond the limited scope of the presently used prophylactic and treatment methods."

The reality of finite health budgets, particularly in low-resource settings, means that interventions used for screening, diagnosing, and treating anaemia in pregnancy need to be informed by cost-effectiveness evidence. We conducted a systematic review to identify all studies evaluating the cost-effectiveness of managing anaemia in pregnancy. We searched two health economics (NHS EED and EconLit) and four medical (MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL Plus and CENTRAL) databases for relevant studies published up to the 9th of August 2024. Studies were eligible if they conducted an economic evaluation of any intervention used in the management of anaemia in pregnancy regardless of aetiology, provided that anaemia was a specified outcome. Data were extracted and study quality assessed by two independent reviewers using the extended CHEC-E tool. Due to significant heterogeneity, data were analysed narratively. 19 eligible cost-effectiveness studies were identified. Nine studies related to iron deficiency anaemia, finding that intravenous rather than oral iron supplements were cost-effective in most instances. Multiple micronutrient supplements were also found to be cost-effective compared to iron and folic acid supplements. Ten studies related to malaria-related anaemia, identifying several cost-effective antimalarial regimens; both preventative and therapeutic. Cost-effective delivery channels of antimalarials as well as non-pharmacological interventions were also identified. This review identifies several avenues through which the management of anaemia in pregnancy can be optimised from an economic perspective. Despite this, there is a significant deficit of cost-effectiveness evidence relating to this condition, which limited the deduction of cost-effectiveness for many of the interventions assessed."

In this paper, the water-soluble anthracenyl-modified oxacalix[4]arene(AO3) was synthesized by converting four imine groups and ester groups of anthracenyl-modified oxacalix[4]arene (AO1) to amine groups and hydrophilic carboxyl groups respectively via reduction and alkaline hydrolysis reactions. Afterwards, the folic acid was bonded to the AO3 via amidation reaction, and the folic acid-functionalized water-soluble anthracenyl-modified oxacalix[4]arene (FA-AO3) with targeting recognition of cancer cells MCF-7 was prepared. The modification of folic acid made FA-AO3 have an obvious redshift phenomenon by 30 nm and significant increase in fluorescence intensity. When normal cells (HUVEC cells) and cancer cells (MCF-7 cells) were cultured with FA-AO3 respectively, obvious green fluorescence could be observed in cancer cells, while fluorescence phenomenon didn't happen in normal cells, indicating that FA-AO3 had a good specificity to recognize human breast cancer cells. FA-AO3 would have potentially valuable application in early cancer diagnosis and can also be as a drug carrier for specific targeted therapy in the future."

Cirrhosis increases oxidative stress in kidneys by disrupting the balance between reactive oxygen species (ROS) and antioxidants, leading to cell damage. Folic acid and ferrous sulfate are two anti-anemic drugs treat various diseases, have a high reactive oxygen radical quenching ability, resulting in protection against oxidative damage in aerobic cell. The aim of this study was to investigate mitigating renal dysfunction in liver cirrhosis and therapeutic potential effect of ferrous sulfate, folic acid and its co-administration caused by alcohol-acetaminophen induced liver cirrhosis. Animals were divided into six groups. Rats of normal control group received water and normal diet ad libitum; AC and LC group received 4.5 % alcohol and a combination of 4.5 % alcohol and acetaminophen (300 mg/kg bw) via drinking water respectively for seven days. After seven days, rats of LC+FS, LC+FA and LC+FS+FA received FS (5 mg/kg bw), FA (5 mg/kg bw) and FS+FA (5 mg/kg bw) respectively via drinking water for four weeks. Enzyme activity and protein expression were measured by semi-quantitative RT PCR and western blotting respectively. Results revealed that FS and FA treatment individually and together restored the antioxidant enzyme activity and the levels of glycolytic pathway towards normal which were affected due to liver cirrhosis. FS and FA are well known anti-anemic drugs and proved to be efficient agents for antioxidant and glycolytic enzymes alteration in liver cirrhosis. This novel approach could lead to new treatments."

The development of MTX resistance contributes to the reduced efficacy and development of adverse reactions, forcing clinicians to withdraw treatment early. This drawback requires combinational approaches to combat the resistance and enhance the efficacy and safety of MTX. To provide a brief overview of MTX resistance and strategies to mitigate its aftereffects in cancer therapy, a literature-based search was conducted using keywords such as cancer pathology, MTX mechanism and resistance, S100A4, folate uptake, folate efflux, P-glycoprotein, beta-catenin and anticancer properties of Vitamins A, D, E and K. Investigations encompassing in vitro studies, in vivo studies and clinical trials were reviewed to identify the mechanisms of resistance induced by MTX and the potential benefits of coadministering fat-soluble vitamins with existing anticancer drugs. Derivates of Vitamin A could target cancer stem cells and increase chemotherapy sensitivity in non-small cell lung cancer. Similarly, calcitriol and cytotoxic medications exhibit additive or synergistic effects. Existing research revealed that fat-soluble vitamins can inhibit drug transporters, such as P-glycoprotein, which inhibit drug efflux, improving chemotherapy efficacy in cancer. As personalised medicine continues to evolve, incorporating combination approaches with MTX and fat-soluble vitamins holds promise for enhancing treatment efficacy, which can counteract MTX resistance via multiple pathways and improve the safety profile."

      "abstract": "Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified more than 1000 loci where genetic variants correlate with kidney function. However, the specific genes, cell types, and mechanisms influenced by these genetic variants remain largely uncharted. Here, we identified glutathione-specific gamma-glutamylcyclotransferase 1 (CHAC1) on chromosome 15 as affected by GWAS variants by analyzing human kidney gene expression and methylation information. Both CHAC1 RNA and protein were expressed in the loop of Henle region in mouse and human kidneys, and CHAC1 expression was higher in patients carrying disease risk variants. Using CRISPR technology, we created mice with a single functional copy of the Chac1 gene (Chac1+/-) that displayed no baseline phenotypic alterations in kidney structure or function. These mice demonstrated resilience to kidney disease in multiple models, including folic acid-induced nephropathy, adenine-induced chronic kidney disease, and uninephrectomy-streptozotocin-induced diabetic nephropathy. We further showed that CHAC1 plays a critical role in degrading the cellular antioxidant glutathione. Tubule cells isolated from Chac1+/- mice showed increased glutathione, decreased lipid peroxidation, improved cell viability, and protection against ferroptosis. Expression of ferroptosis-associated genes was also lower in mice with only one copy of Chac1. Higher CHAC1 protein also correlated with ferroptosis-related protein abundance in kidney biopsies from patients with kidney disease. This study positions CHAC1 as an important mediator of kidney disease that influences glutathione concentrations and ferroptosis, suggesting potential avenues to explore for the treatment of kidney diseases.",

      "abstract": "This study aimed to assess the influence of Paralichthys olivaceus egg extract (POEE) treatment on the maturation and development of porcine oocytes subjected to oxidative stress during in vitro maturation (IVM). POEE, notably rich in vitamin B9 (folic acid [FA]), was assessed alongside FA for antioxidant activity across various concentrations. In the 650 ppm POEE (650 POEE) group, there was a significant rise in glutathione (GSH) levels and an improved developmental rate in porcine oocytes experiencing oxidative stress during IVM. Treatment with 0.3 FA exhibited substantial reduction in ROS activity. Both 650 POEE and 0.3 FA groups demonstrated inhibited abnormal spindle organization and chromosomal misalignment, with increased blastocyst formation and decreased apoptotic cells. Treatment with 650 POEE elevated mRNA expression of development-related genes (SOX2, NANOG, and POU5F1). In conclusion, POEE effectively mitigates oxidative stress, enhances embryonic quality, and improves developmental potential in porcine oocytes on IVM."

There are still no reliable indicators to predict tumor response and prognosis of geriatric patients prior to chemotherapy. The aim of our study was to investigate the value of pretreatment prognostic nutritional index (PNI), serum albumin, total lymphocyte, neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), and platelet-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) in predicting the response to treatment in geriatric gastric cancer patients treated with FLOT (5-Fluorouracil, leucovorin, oxaliplatin, and docetaxel) regimen as neoadjuvant chemotherapy.Methods: A total of 91 geriatric gastric cancer patients (≥65-year-old) who received a neoadjuvant FLOT regimen were retrospectively analyzed. Pretreatment data, including demographic characteristics, complete blood count, serum albumin level (g/dL), serum tumor markers (CEA and CA19-9), PNI values and other clinicopathological parameters, were collected. Independent sample t-tests and Mann-Whitney U tests were used to analyze quantitative independent data. In the analysis of independent qualitative data, the chi-squared test and Fischer's exact test were used when the chi-squared test conditions were not met.Results: The mean age was 69.9 ± 4. There were 22 patients in the treatment-responsive group and 69 in the treatment-nonresponsive group. Serum albumin levels were significantly higher in the treatment-responsive group. The lymphocyte counts were significantly lower in the treatment-responsive group. Additionally, both disease-free survival and overall survival were significantly extended in patients who responded to treatment.Conclusion: We demonstrated that serum albumin and total lymphocyte counts, which are easily accessible blood parameters routinely examined before treatment, may predict the response in geriatric gastric cancer patients receiving neoadjuvant FLOT treatment. However, larger prospective, multicenter studies are required to confirm this relationship.",

In this study, we synthesized poly(ε-caprolactone)-co-poly(ethylene glycol) (PCL-co-PEG) and fabricated LTZ-loaded PCL-co-PEG NPs (LTZ-NPs) via emulsion-solvent evaporation. Folic acid (FA), a folate receptor-targeting molecule, was conjugated to the LTZ-loaded NPs (LTZ-FNPs) to enhance treatment efficacy against hormone receptor-positive breast cancer cells. Both NPs and FNPs exhibited a spherical morphology (60-90 nm), with FNPs showing higher drug entrapment efficiency and controlled release. LTZ release was minimal at physiological pH but increased in acidic, cancer-like environments, following the Korsmeyer-Peppas model, indicating a combination of Fickian and non-Fickian diffusion. In cytotoxicity assays, LTZ-FNPs exhibited higher toxicity against MCF-7 cells than LTZ-NPs. Controlled LTZ release altered gene expression, reducing B-cell leukemia/lymphoma 2 protein (Bcl2) and increasing caspase 8 (Casp8), promoting apoptosis. A shift to the SubG1 phase further confirmed enhanced LTZ-FNP-mediated cell death. Furthermore, p53 expression increased, while matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9) decreased, inhibiting cell invasion. This study introduces a biodegradable system with FA-functionalized, pH-sensitive NPs for the targeted and controlled delivery of LTZ. This approach holds great potential for selective, efficient treatment while minimizing systemic toxicity in breast cancer therapy."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Chronic pharyngitis (CP) presents a significant burden on patients' quality of life (QoL), often requiring comprehensive management strategies beyond conventional treatment modalities. This study aims to evaluate the efficacy of a multidisciplinary approach to CP treatment and its impact on patients' QoL. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of 140 patients diagnosed with CP who were treated at the ENT outpatient clinic of Private Mersin Su Hospital, Mersin, Türkiye, between January 1, 2022, and January 1, 2023. Our treatment approach integrated dietary modifications, management of gastroesophageal reflux, nasal obstruction correction, and allergy management alongside standard pharmacotherapy. The primary outcome measure was the improvement in the Sore Throat QoL Scale (STQoL) scores, assessed at baseline, 30, 60, and 90 days post treatment. RESULTS: The study population consisted of 140 chronic pharyngitis patients, including 82 male (58.57%) and 58 female (41.43%) patients, with a mean age of 42.2 ± 6.3 years. Laboratory tests revealed that 115 patients (82.14%) had iron deficiency with a mean serum level of 61.2 mg/dL (reference range: 70-180 mg/dL), while 109 patients (77.85%) had low ferritin levels (mean 55.3 mcg/L; reference range: 50-150 mcg/L). In addition, 98 patients (70.00%) showed vitamin B12 deficiency, averaging 223.6 pg/mL (reference range: 350-900 pg/mL), 128 patients (91.42%) had vitamin D deficiency, with a mean value of 29.3 ng/mL (reference range: 40-100 ng/mL), and 68 patients (48.57%) demonstrated folic acid deficiency, with an average of 6.9 ng/mL (reference range: 6-17 ng/mL). Moreover, elevated glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels were observed in 59 patients (42.14%) (mean 6.1%, target: 4-5.6%), and 45 patients (32.14%) had high serum total immunoglobulin E (mean 95.4 mg/dL; normal range: 20-100 mg/dL). Patient-reported outcomes using the STQoL improved markedly from a baseline score of 22.2 ± 3.2 to 57.9 ± 8.2 on day 30, 77.1 ± 13.6 on day 60, and 93.5 ± 17.3 on day 90 (all comparisons p < 0.05), indicating significant enhancement in QoL over the treatment period. CONCLUSION: The findings suggest that a multidisciplinary approach to CP treatment, addressing both the symptoms and the underlying causes, significantly improves patients' QoL. This study underscores the importance of adopting comprehensive, patient-centered treatment strategies in managing chronic pharyngitis, warranting further research into optimizing care for this common condition."

      "abstract": "Introduction Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) imposes a considerable impact on day-to-day functioning. Many people experience insufficient symptom relief even after taking the optimum dose of OCD medications. Reduced levels of folic acid and vitamin B₁₂, along with elevated homocysteine (HCY), have been suggested as possible factors in the persistence of obsessive-compulsive (OC) symptoms. This study investigated how supplementation of vitamin B₁₂, folic acid, and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) affects OC symptoms and related biochemical markers. Methods A comparative study enrolled 72 OCD patients. For eight weeks, the conventional treatment group received SSRIs or other anti-obsessive medication. In contrast, the nutrient-supplemented group received supplements of vitamin B₁₂, folic acid, and SSRIs. Micronutrients HCY, folic acid, and vitamin B₁₂ were measured at baseline and after eight weeks. Besides, the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) was applied to assess the severity of OCD symptoms at the baseline, four-week, and eight-week visits. Results Group A (conventional treatment with nutrient supplement) showed significant improvements in vitamin B₁₂, blood folic acid, and reductions in HCY levels compared to Group B (conventional treatment). However, no substantial differences in insight levels were observed between the groups. Both groups exhibited decreased Y-BOCS scores, indicating a reduction in OCD symptoms; however, the improvements in Group A (conventional treatment + nutrient supplement) were statistically significant. Conclusions When taken with SSRIs, vitamin B₁₂and folic acid supplements seem to improve OCD patients' clinical results. These results imply that this supplementation could be a useful therapeutic adjunct."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND & AIMS: The NAPOLI 3 trial demonstrated that compared to the nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine (GemNab) regimen, the NALIRIFOX (5-fluorouracil, leucovorin, liposomal irinotecan, oxaliplatin) regimen can significantly improve patients' overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS), and the safety of this regimen is generally controllable. To ensure the appropriateness of the chosen treatment, economic evaluation is essential. Thus, from the perspective of American healthcare systems, we explored the cost-effectiveness comparison between NALIRIFOX or GemNab in treating patients with metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (mPDAC) who had not previously received treatment. METHODS: A three-state partitioned survival model was developed, incorporating a lifetime horizon with a 4-week cycle length. The efficacy data were sourced from the NAPOLI 3 study, while treatment costs, health state utilities, and adverse events (AEs) were obtained from public databases and literature. Applying an annual discount rate of 3%, the analysis focused on total cost, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) as primary outcomes. Conducted within a US healthcare system perspective over a 13-year lifetime horizon, the analysis set willingness-to-pay (WTP) thresholds of $50,000, $100,000 and $150,000 per QALY. Sensitivity analyses were performed to assess the robustness of the model's findings. RESULTS: In our base-case analysis, NALIRIFOX group was estimated to achieve an incremental gain of 0.13 QALYs. Compared to the GemNab group, treatment with NALIRIFOX resulted in higher costs ($150,437 vs $130,683). The ICER for NALIRIFOX therapy was calculated to be $155,602.83/QALYs. Sensitivity analysis revealed the model's robustness across a range of parameters. Through probabilistic sensitivity analysis applying Monte Carlo simulation with 1000 iterations, NALIRIFOX therapy was identified as the cost-effective regimen in 45.7% of all iterations at a WTP threshold of $150,000/QALYs. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with NALIRIFOX strategy was estimated to provide a significant clinical advantage over GemNab. According to the model outcomes, NALIRIFOX therapy is borderline cost-effective for treatment-naive patients with mPDAC, slightly exceeding the highest conventional US willingness-to-pay threshold of 150,000/QALY. However, at lower thresholds, such as 100,000/QALY, NALIRIFOX fails to demonstrate cost-effectiveness in all simulations. In addition, NALIRIFOX therapy emerges as a cost-effective treatment strategy at higher willingness-to-pay thresholds or when the drug price is significantly reduced.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Women of reproductive age in India are vulnerable to multiple micronutrient deficiencies. Large-scale food fortification of staple foods and condiments offers a cost-effective approach to improving micronutrient intake. However, the impact of large-scale food fortification on the gut microbiome remains poorly understood. OBJECTIVES: To determine whether quintuply-fortified salt (QFS) alters the gut microbiome of non-pregnant women of reproductive age after 12 months. METHODS: A double-blind, randomized, controlled community-based trial was conducted among 998 women (18-49 years) in Punjab, India. Eligible participants were randomized to receive 1) QFS with iron as encapsulated ferrous fumarate (eFF), zinc, vitamin B12, folic acid, and iodine (eFF-QFS); 2) QFS with the same micronutrients, but iron as encapsulated ferric pyrophosphate (eFePP) plus ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) (eFePP-QFS); or 3) standard iodized salt. Stool samples were collected from a subsample of women at baseline and 12 months and subjected to 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Outcomes included intervention effects on alpha diversity (Shannon index and abundance-based estimator (ACE) index) assessed via linear mixed regression models, Bray-Curtis dissimilarity (beta diversity) assessed via permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA), and relative abundance of Enterobacteriaceae, Lactobacillus, and Bifidobacterium, Prevotella or Streptococcus modeled using zero-inflated negative binomial mixed regression. RESULTS: Among the 129 women who provided both a baseline and 12-month stool sample, 86 had sufficient read depth following sequencing (eFF-Q5S, n = 33; eFePP-Q5S, n = 26; iodized salt, n= 27). Neither alpha diversity nor beta diversity differed significantly at baseline or following the 12-month intervention. There was no intervention effect on relative abundance of individual taxa (q-value > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: QFS did not appear to alter the gut microbiome of non-pregnant women of reproductive age in Punjab, India."

      "abstract": "Although periodontal disease (PD) is reported to be associated with changes in various genes and proteins in both invading bacteria and the host, its molecular mechanism of pathogenesis remains unclear. Changes in immune and inflammatory genes play a significant role in PD pathogenesis. Some reports relate alterations in cellular epigenetic patterns to PD characteristics, while several high-throughput analyses indicate thousands of differentially methylated genes in both PD patients and controls. Furthermore, changes in DNA methylation patterns in inflammation-related genes have been linked to the efficacy of periodontal therapy, as demonstrated by findings related to the cytochrome C oxidase II gene. Distinct DNA methylation patterns in mesenchymal stem cells from PD patients and controls persisted despite the reversal of phenotypic PD. Methyl groups for DNA methylation are supplied by S-adenosylmethionine, which is synthesized with the involvement of folate, an essential nutrient known to play a role in maintaining mitochondrial homeostasis, reported to be compromised in PD. Folate may benefit PD through its antioxidant action against reactive oxygen and nitrogen species that are overproduced by dysfunctional mitochondria. As such, DNA methylation, dietary folate, and mitochondrial quality control may interact in PD pathogenesis. In this narrative/hypothesis review, we demonstrate how PD is associated with changes in mitochondrial homeostasis, which may, in turn, be improved by folate, potentially altering the epigenetic patterns of immune and inflammatory genes in both the nucleus and mitochondria. Therefore, a folate-based dietary intervention is recommended for PD prevention and as an adjunct therapy. At the same time, further research is needed on the involvement of epigenetic mechanisms in the beneficial effects of folate on PD studies.",

Dynamic light scattering (DLS) analysis revealed an average particle size of 388.70 nm, suitable for cellular uptake and release kinetics. The NCC/CTAB/FA NPs exhibited a rod and spherical morphology and uniform distribution, as confirmed by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM). Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy confirmed the successful synthesis and functional group integration, supporting the NPs' ability for drug delivery. The encapsulation efficiency value was 81.17%, demonstrating the effective incorporation of Quercetin. Cytotoxicity assays indicated significant reductions in cell viability for AGS and A2780 cells with IC50 values of 3.2 µg/mL and 16.04 µg/mL, respectively, while HDF cells exhibited higher viability. Flow cytometry analysis revealed a dose-dependent induction of apoptosis in AGS cells, supported by changes in gene expression related to apoptosis and inflammation. Furthermore, antioxidant capacity assays demonstrated practical free radical scavenging abilities, with IC50 values of 151.65 µg/mL for ABTS and 349.54 µg/mL for DPPH.

Designed to carry either cisplatin (CDDP) or paclitaxel (PTX), the DMs facilitated complementary therapeutic effects through pH-responsive release, enabling synergistic neuroblastoma therapy. Magnetic actuation tests confirmed multimodal propulsion and precise motion control. In vitro experiments demonstrated enhanced therapeutic efficacy and reduced off-target effects compared to those of conventional approaches. These diatom-templated magnetic microrobots, with their facile fabrication and superior performance, represent a promising platform for targeted drug delivery and advanced cancer therapy.",

      "abstract": "Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a targeted cancer treatment offering precise tumor ablation with minimal systemic toxicity. However, its clinical application is constrained by poor solubility, rapid clearance, and inadequate tumor accumulation of photosensitizers (PS). This study presents an innovative liquid metal nanoparticle (LMNP) platform, composed of gallium-indium eutectic alloy (EGaIn), engineered to address these drug delivery challenges in PDT. Using a one-step sonication process, EGaIn nanoparticles are synthesized and functionalized with folic acid (FA) for tumor-specific targeting, beta cyclodextrin (β-CD) for enhanced drug encapsulation, and benzoporphyrin derivative (BPD) as a PS. The inclusion of β-CD significantly improves the BPD loading capacity, achieving a three-fold enhancement (52% vs. 18%) while ensuring nanoparticle stability and sustained drug release. Covalent binding of FA and β-CD to the gallium oxide surface enables effective targeting and biocompatibility. In vitro analyses demonstrate potent PDT efficacy, even with reduced cellular uptake, underscoring the platform's ability to overcome intracellular delivery barriers. This LMNP-based nanoplatform addresses critical PDT limitations, such as suboptimal drug delivery and systemic toxicity, leveraging the unique chemical and physical properties of EGaIn nanoparticles. Its multifunctional design integrates targeted delivery, controlled release, and precise therapeutic activation, representing a promising advancement in the development of effective, personalized cancer treatment strategies."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: More than 60% of women of reproductive age in Odisha, India are anemic. The national long-term efforts in reducing anemia have focused mostly on the supply side, with a paucity of campaigns on the demand side. Social norms serve as significant determinants of human behavior, but there are few interventions that adopt a social-norms approach to reducing anemia. An intervention was implemented to change descriptive, injunctive, and collective social norms to improve iron folic acid consumption behaviors among women of reproductive age. METHODS: A longitudinal cluster randomized controlled trial was conducted to collect data at baseline, six months later at midline, and a year after that at end-line. All villages in our study area were formed into clusters, randomly assigned to either the treatment (50 clusters with 130 villages) or the control (39 clusters with 109 villages) arm. Women were eligible for inclusion if they aged between15 and 49, spoke Odiya, and did not plan to move in the next year. Women living in treatment communities received the intervention package that comprised community-based education sessions, health communication videos, and hemoglobin testing. RESULTS: Data analyses included 2,061 women in the treatment arm and 2,049 women in the control arm enrolled in the trial at baseline. Hierarchical linear models revealed that all three types of social norms improved significantly more in treatment than in control communities (all p's < 0.001) at midline. Two of the norms (descriptive and collective but not injunctive norms) predicted iron folic acid consumption at end-line. The relative improvement in iron folic acid consumption over time was significantly greater in treatment communities (p <.001). CONCLUSIONS: It appears that a social norms-based intervention can change longer-term iron and folic acid consumption behaviors to reduce anemia. Future practice may merit having norms-based strategies to promote adherence to micronutrient supplementation and medical guidelines among women. This demand-side approach will be particularly useful in resource-limited settings where the health system is inadequately prepared to procure and distribute supplements. TRIAL REGISTRATION: This trial was registered with Clinical Trials Registry- India (CTRI) (CTRI/2018/10/016186) on 29 October 2018."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: An adverse maternal outcome, such as anemia, postpartum hemorrhage, and postpartum eclampsia, poses a significant risk to women. While studies on the burden of adverse maternal outcomes have been conducted in various countries, including Ethiopia, many predictors beyond obstetric factors have not been fully explored. This study aimed to determine the magnitude and factors associated with adverse maternal outcomes among women who gave birth at selected public hospitals in eastern Ethiopia. METHODS: A hospital-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 2,608 randomly selected women who gave birth in six public hospitals in eastern Ethiopia from November 2023 to March 2024. Data were collected through face-to-face interviews and clinical chart reviews. Factors associated with adverse maternal outcomes were identified using bivariable and multivariable robust Poisson regression analyses. Adjusted relative risk (ARR) with a 95% confidence interval (CI) was used to report the strength of the association. The variables with a p-value of <0.05 were considered statistically significant. RESULTS: The magnitude of adverse maternal outcomes was 15.68% (95% CI: 14.70%-16.66%). A poor wealth index (ARR = 4.41; 95% CI: 3.46-5.62), having danger signs at admission (ARR = 1.86; 95% CI: 1.18-2.91), alcohol use during pregnancy (ARR = 1.86; 95% CI: 1.32-2.62), duration of labor ≥24 h (ARR = 1.69; 95% CI: 1.00-2.85), and maternal age greater than 35 years (ARR = 1.39; 95% CI: 1.03-1.86) increased the risk of adverse maternal outcomes. In contrast, folic acid intake during pregnancy (ARR = 0.47; 95% CI: 0.38-0.57), having partner support (ARR = 0.70; 95% CI: 0.59-0.83), and spontaneous vaginal delivery (ARR = 0.58; 95% CI: 0.49-0.68) reduced the risk of adverse maternal outcomes. CONCLUSION: One in six women who gave birth in eastern Ethiopia experienced adverse maternal outcomes. This rate was determined to be moderate when compared to the WHO projections for lower- and middle-income countries and better than the higher averages reported by the WHO. Targeted intervention programs, such as targeted education and empowerment programs, and the strengthening of the community health worker program would help address socioeconomic disparities and improve early detection and management of danger signs during pregnancy, which would aid in averting the occurrence of adverse outcomes."

The purpose of this study was to analyze the scientometric characteristics and research trends of BMS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: All the papers on BMS were comprehensively retrieved from the Scopus database. The years of publication were divided into before 2015 and 2015-2024 in the analysis of research trends. RESULTS: There were 924 papers on BMS, with total citations of 24,024 and the h index of 76. The related disorders of BMS were depression, xerostomia, pain, anxiety, glossodynia, taste disorder, nociception, paresthesia, analgesia, sleep disorder, diabetes mellitus, and neuralgia. Clonazepam was most common pharmacotherapy for BMS. After 2015, pharmacologic keywords including drug safety, aripiprazole, duloxetine, folic acid, hydrocortisone, and pregabalin were more frequent. Low level laser therapy, acupuncture, and cognitive behavioral therapy were the emerging nonpharmacologic strategies for BMS. Moreover, laboratory investigations on biomarkers, blood, genetics, interleukin 6, and tumor necrosis factor were more common. Various questionnaires, comorbidity, complication, anemia, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and sleep were also more concerned after 2015. CONCLUSION: This scientometric study elucidated the current scenario and research trends of BMS, and would help in improving in reciprocal collaboration and communication for investigations on this condition."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Molecular diagnostics play a pivotal role in guiding therapy for metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). Current guidelines recommend stratification based on biomarkers such as RAS, BRAF, and DNA mismatch-repair (MMR) status to select between anti-EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor) and anti-VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) therapies. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective analysis evaluated the randomized FIRE-3 study that compared first-line treatment with FOLFIRI plus cetuximab to FOLFIRI plus bevacizumab in RAS wild-type patients. The present analysis included 199 patients with RAS/BRAF wild-type MMR proficient tumors. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) was successfully performed in all patients and allowed stratification into hyperselected (no predefined genetic alterations) or gene altered subgroups using the previously published approach of the PRESSING-studies. RESULTS: Hyperselection according to PRESSING-3 was associated with a survival benefit from anti-EGFR-based therapy compared to bevacizumab (38.5 months vs. 27.5 months; HR 0.68; 95 % CI, 0.44-1.05; P = 0.08). This benefit was observed in both, right- and left-sided tumors, (HR 0.58 and HR 0.70). Patients with gene alterations showed inferior survival compared to hyperselected patients across all subgroups. In this unfavorable subgroup, application of cetuximab and bevacizumab were associated with comparable OS (total cohort: HR 1.04; 95 % CI, 0.61-1.79). Again, this finding was independent of primary tumor sidedness (left-sided tumors: HR 1.10; 95 % CI, 0.59-2.07; right-sided tumors: HR 1.05; 95 % CI, 0.31-3.55). CONCLUSION: Molecular hyperselection facilitated by next generation sequencing could replace primary tumor sidedness as a tool of decision making for optimal choice of targeted therapy in first-line treatment of RAS wild-type mCRC.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Low folate status is one of the multiple factors thought to contribute to the development of schizophrenia. As of 2023, over 70 countries have implemented mandatory fortification of foods with folic acid, a public health measure aimed at reducing neural tube defects; however, the impact of such policy on schizophrenia has not been comprehensively investigated. METHOD: We assessed the impact of mandatory folic acid fortification on changes in the schizophrenia rates in 194 jurisdictions between 1990 and 2019 using publicly available data. We used weighted regression models adjusted for sociodemographic and sociopolitical factors, experience of natural disasters, and baseline schizophrenia rate. RESULTS: Age-adjusted prevalence and incidence of schizophrenia increased marginally between 1990 and 2019. In all geographic regions, schizophrenia prevalence and incidence per 100,000 positively correlated with countries' sociodemographic index and were lower with fortification. Schizophrenia burdens were higher among males compared to females. Lower prevalence and incidence of schizophrenia were associated with having mandatory fortification with modest magnitudes. Duration of fortification or the fortification dose did not appear to have a strong impact. However, in the 15-39 year age-group, both mandatory fortification (β = -13·14 (-22·60, -3·68)) and duration of fortification (β = -0·82 (-1·40, -0·23)) were significantly associated with lower schizophrenia with larger magnitude in both sexes. The highest dose tertile was reported to have the lowest incidence and the smallest increase in prevalence in this age-group. CONCLUSION: Folic acid fortification may be a beneficial intervention in lowering schizophrenia among adolescents and young adults."

      "abstract": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) causes the third highest mortality worldwide. Liver ablation, surgery, and embolization are conventional methods for treatment. However, these methods have limitations. To overcome these issues, nanomedicines have potential due to their high stability, high drug load capacity, and controlled release. Thus, we prepared quercetin-loaded polylactic-co-glycolic acid (PLGA) nanoparticles coated with folic acid-chitosan (QPCF-NPs) to improve drug delivery and targetability applications of quercetin for the treatment of HCC. We prepared QPCF-NPs by solvent evaporation and coated them with chitosan-folic acid (CS-FA). QPCF-NPs were examined using Fourier-Transform infrared (FTIR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and X-ray diffraction (XRD). In addition, the drug release rate and cytotoxicity were studied. Moreover, in vivo HCC studies such as histopathology and biochemical parameters were conducted. Subsequently, QPCF-NPs with a spherical shape and an average size of 200-290 nm have been demonstrated to have formed by FTIR, XRD, SEM, and TEM. Further, we observed sustained drug release from QPCF-NPs compared to quercetin. Cellular cytotoxicity showed significant inhibition in the HEPG2-cell line with QPCF-NPs treatment. Biochemical estimate and oxidative stress regulation were considerably more regulated in the treatment groups than the HCC group in a dose-dependent way after subcutaneous administration of QPCF-NPs. ELISA of interleukin and caspase-3 demonstrated the anticipated results in comparison to the carcinogen control group. Compared to earlier preparations, the QPCF-NPs generated demonstrated better drug targetability and potency for treating HCC."

      "abstract": "Background/Objectives: Cerebral folate transporter deficiency is characterized by pauses and regression in general development stages, with ataxia, choreoathetoid movements, and myoclonic epilepsy generally resistant to treatment. The aim of this study was to comprehensively evaluate cases followed up in two centres in Türkiye for a diagnosis of folate receptor-α deficiency. Methods: The study included nine cases from six different families. Results: The patients comprised 22.2% males and there was parental consanguinity in 88.9% of cases. The mean age at which complaints were first noticed was 3.7 years, and the age of definitive diagnosis was 10.4 years. The most frequently seen first complaints were febrile convulsions and attention deficit-hyperactivity-learning difficulties. The diagnosis most commonly made before the definitive diagnosis was epilepsy, and the first seizure occurred at a mean of 5.2 years. On cranial imaging, white matter involvement, cerebellar atrophy and cerebral atrophy were determined most often. Definitive diagnosis was established solely through clinical findings and genetic analysis. Three different variants in the FOLR1 gene were determined. Treatment with folinic acid at a dose of 5.2 mg/kg/day of PO was started at the age of 9.8 years on average, and intravenous folinate was started at different doses. Conclusions: This study stands out as one of the largest case series in the literature and identifies a previously unreported novel variant. Our study suggests that FOLR1-related CFD should be considered in cases with febrile convulsions, developmental delay, ataxia, autism spectrum disorder, acquired microcephaly, and MRI findings of white matter involvement and cerebellar atrophy. Due to an asymptomatic early period, CFD diagnosis may be delayed, and treatment after symptom onset may be less effective. Incorporating FOLR1 gene analysis into newborn screening programmes could facilitate early diagnosis and treatment. It is thought that the application of vagus nerve stimulation, in addition to folinic acid and anticonvulsant drug treatment, could be effective in seizure control."

Structural, infectious, metabolic, immunologic, and unknown causes can contribute to the development of seizures. In recent years, there has been increasing attention on epilepsy caused by genetic metabolic disorders. More than two hundred inherited metabolic disorders have been identified as potential cause of seizures, and they are mainly associated with energy deficiency in the brain, accumulation of toxic substances, abnormal neurotransmitter transmission, and deficiency of cofactors. Vitamins play a crucial role as components of several enzymes or coenzymes. Impaired metabolism of thiamine, biotin, vitamin B6, vitamin B12 and folic acid can contribute to early-onset seizures and developmental abnormalities in infants. However, timely supplementation therapy can significantly improve patient prognosis of affected patients. Therefore, a thorough understanding and investigation of the metabolic basis of epilepsy is essential for the development of precise therapeutic approaches, which could provide significant therapeutic benefits for patients."

We previously developed a prognostic model (CGMH nomogram) to predict overall survival (OS) in patients receiving second-line chemotherapy before the nal-IRI + 5-FU/LV era. Herein, we aimed to validate the CGMH nomogram in a real-world cohort treated with nal-IRI plus 5-FU/LV, the current standard second-line treatment for metastatic PDAC.MethodsA retrospective cohort of 148 patients with metastatic PDAC treated with second-line nal-IRI + 5-FU/LV was analyzed. Prognostic scores were assigned using the CGMH nomogram, with patients stratified into tertiles as good, intermediate, and poor prognostic groups. Predictive performance was assessed using the concordance index (c-index) and calibration plots.ResultsOur cohort had a median OS of 6.1 months. Patients in the good, intermediate, and poor prognostic groups had median OS of 8.7 (95% confidence interval [CI], 6.7-10.7), 5.7 (95% CI, 5.3-6.3), and 4.0 (95% CI, 2.8-5.2) months, respectively. Compared with the good group, intermediate and poor groups had hazard ratios of 1.99 (95% CI, 1.29-3.07, P = .002) and 3.18 (95% CI, 1.87-5.40, P < .001), respectively. The nomogram demonstrated strong predictive ability, with c-indices of 0.73 and 0.70 for 6- and 12-month OS predictions, respectively. Calibration plots displayed excellent agreement between predicted and observed survival.ConclusionThe CGMH nomogram reliably predicted survival outcomes in nal-IRI + 5-FU/LV-treated patients with metastatic PDAC, and validation supported its use in clinical decision-making and personalized treatment planning.",

      "abstract": "Folate (vitamin B9) is an essential nutrient that plays a crucial role in various bodily functions. Its deficiency can lead to health issues, such as megaloblastic anemia, neural tube defects in the developing fetus and increased risk of cardiovascular diseases. Consequently, there is interest in increasing folate content in food crops by classical and molecular breeding. Since folate is a water-soluble vitamin that is sensitive to heat, we chose to manipulate its synthesis pathway in lettuce, which is often used for salads and sandwiches, without heat treatment, which makes it a good vehicle for making folate available to the population via biofortification. Transgenic lettuce plants were generated to express the GTP-cyclohydrolase I and aminodeoxychorismate synthase coding sequences from Arabidopsis thaliana. Plants were cultivated under greenhouse conditions and two field trials were carried out. Results have shown that transgenic lines presented up to 3.4 times more folate than the non-transgenic lettuce plants and 1.9 times more folate than spinach, considered one of the plants richest in folates. Advanced generations of homozygous plants were cultivated under field conditions for two years and the results showed that folate-biofortification was stable. A folate-biofortified lettuce serving would provide about 36 to 64% of the recommended daily intake. This technology is a foundation to produce folate-biofortified commercial varieties that can help to reduce hidden hunger, decreasing the number of cases of fetus malformations and other diseases.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Anemia continues to be a problem among adolescent girls, including in Indonesia. Although the Weekly Iron-Folic Acid Supplementation (WIFAS) program was introduced in 2014, adherence remains a challenge. The study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of WhatsApp (WA) reminder messages in improving knowledge and adherence to WIFAS among adolescent girls in the Salahutu Sub-District, Maluku Province. METHODS: A quasi-experimental design was employed in 2024, utilizing a pretest-posttest control group framework across two senior high schools in Salahutu Sub-District. The intervention school (n = 49) received WA-based reminder messages for four weeks, while the control school (n = 42) continued to receive routine services. We used Mann-Whitney, Fisher Exact and chi-square tests in this analysis. RESULTS: The WA-based intervention led to a significant improvement in knowledge scores among adolescent girls from the intervention school (p < 0.001). These students were also more likely to have taken WIFAS in the week preceding the endline survey (p < 0.001) and to have consumed at least 75% of the distributed WIFAS (p = 0.015) compared to the control school. Furthermore, the mean hemoglobin levels were significantly higher in the intervention compared to the control school (p = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The WA-based reminder messages were effective in enhancing knowledge and adherence to WIFAS. Expanding this approach to a broader population is recommended before scaling up implementation across Maluku and other regions in Indonesia."

      "abstract": "Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most common cancer in men and the leading cause of cancer death worldwide. Overactivation of PI3K signaling has been reported to be associated with PCa. TGX221 is an effective specific inhibitor of PI3K, but its clinical application is greatly limited due to its poor solubility. Herein, by using folic acid-PEG-cholesterol semi-succinate (FA-PEG-CHEMS) as the targeting component, we developed a folate receptor-targeted pH-sensitive liposomal delivery system loaded with TGX221 (FA-Lip-TGX221) that could realize effective delivery and controlled release of drugs in the tumor. The prepared liposomes exhibited a uniform particle size and high stability. In addition, FA-Lip-TGX221 could be effectively internalized by PC-3 cells due to its ability to target folate receptors, thereby accumulating in tumor tissues. Meanwhile, in vitro and in vivo experiments suggested that FA-Lip-TGX221 could activate the PERK-ATF4-CHOP signaling pathway by inhibiting PI3K/110β signaling in PCa, thus significantly promoting endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-mediated cancer cell death. In conclusion, FA-Lip-TGX221 is a promising nano-delivery vehicle for the treatment of PCa, and also provide valuable references for all tumors overexpressing folate receptors."

OBJECTIVES: This study explored the SH2 domain of STAT5a and carried out the identification of natural STAT5a inhibitors. METHODS: Using template-based homology modeling, we constructed the structure of human STAT5a (VP1P) and compared it with its 3D crystal of the STAT5a protein obtained from the RCSB database and the model generated by the AlphaFold database. In this study, we carried out molecular docking studies using AutoDock Vina on the top 500 natural compounds identified through a pharmacophore search of the ZINC database using ZINCPharmer. Furthermore, the top ten compounds with the highest binding energies were evaluated for their drug-likeness and ADMET properties using SWISS ADME and ProTox-II, followed by 100 ns molecular dynamics (MD) simulations using the Desmond module of the Schrodinger suite. RESULTS: Docking studies revealed Pedunculagin (-10.5 kcal/mol), Folic acid (-10.1 kcal/mol), Chebulinic acid (- 10.0 kcal/mol), Chebulagic acid (-9.8 kcal/mol), and Oleandrin (-9.8 kcal/mol) as the top candidates, compared to the STAT5 inhibitor (Phase-II Clinical Trial) (-8.5 kcal/mol). ADMET analysis confirmed their safety profiles. MD simulations showed stable protein-ligand complexes, with all compounds interacting with the conserved Arg638 residue at the active site, similar to the STAT5 inhibitor. CONCLUSION: Pedunculagin demonstrated the strongest binding energy and stability, making it a promising candidate for further development as a novel lead compound to disrupt STAT5a/b dimerization in PCa therapy."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Micronutrient deficiencies in folate, ferritin, calcium, and vitamin D are common during pregnancy in low- and middle-income countries, often due to inadequate diets. Micronutrient supplementation can address this need, whereas innovative awareness strategies in antenatal practices could enhance supplement use compliance. OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the efficacy of a personalized mobile health (mHealth) intervention, hypothesizing a 30% improvement in supplement use in the intervention group compared to a conventional face-to-face counseling group. METHODS: In an unblinded randomized controlled trial, we enrolled 306 first-trimester pregnant women from Aga Khan University Hospital between January 2020 and September 2021 who owned smartphones with internet connection. Women on regular medications or with dietary restrictions or critical illnesses were excluded. The intervention group received personalized micronutrient supplement use coaching through an mHealth app (PurUmeed Aaghaz) as thrice-a-week push messages and tailored recommendations over a 24-week period. The comparison group received standard face-to-face counseling at 6, 12, 18, and 24 weeks after enrollment. Baseline sociodemographic, obstetrics, anthropometric, dietary, and lifestyle data were collected through face-to-face interviews. At each follow-up, participants reported their weekly use of folic acid, iron, calcium, and vitamin D supplements, scored as 0 (daily), 1.5 (4-6 times weekly), and 3 (≤3 times weekly). Scores were summed to calculate the cumulative supplement use score (CSUS; 0-12), with higher scores indicating greater inadequacy. Every fourth woman was invited for biochemical micronutrient assessment. Data were analyzed using Stata (version 14), with random-effects linear and logistic panel regression to compare CSUS and supplement use between the 2 groups from baseline to endline. RESULTS: Of 153 participants per group, 107 (69.9%) in the intervention and 125 (81.7%) in the nonintervention group completed the study. After 24 weeks, the intervention group showed a greater but insignificant reduction in mean CSUS compared to the nonintervention group (β=-.27, 95% CI -0.65 to 0.12; P=.17). Daily supplement use improved by 20% versus 22.4% for folic acid, 11.2 times versus 2.1 times for iron, 1.2 times versus 14.2 times for calcium, and 3 times versus 1.3 times for vitamin D in the intervention versus nonintervention group, respectively. Multivariable analysis showed higher, though insignificant, odds of sufficient folic acid (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.26, 95% CI 0.68-2.36; P=.46) and iron (aOR 1.31, 95% CI 0.95-1.81; P=.10) use in the intervention group, whereas vitamin D use was significantly higher (aOR 1.88, 95% CI 1.43-2.47; P<.001). Calcium intake improved in the nonintervention group (aOR 0.59, 95% CI 0.44-0.79; P<.001). Anemia decreased in the intervention group, whereas ferritin, calcium, and vitamin D deficiencies persisted or worsened, particularly in the nonintervention group. CONCLUSIONS: An appropriately implemented mHealth intervention can improve antenatal vitamin D supplementation. Affordable, accessible, and personalized counseling through mHealth could ameliorate micronutrient status during pregnancy.

This study investigates the efficacy of folate and vitamin B6 supplementation as an adjunct to sodium valproate in improving treatment responses for patients experiencing acute mania. METHODS: In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 43 patients diagnosed with bipolar I disorder presenting with acute manic episodes were enrolled. Participants were randomly assigned to three groups: one receiving folate (5 mg/day) plus vitamin B6 (80 mg/day), a second group receiving folate alone (5 mg/day), and a third group receiving placebo. Evaluations were conducted at baseline and after 3 and 6 weeks using the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS). RESULTS: All groups demonstrated significant clinical improvements after the treatment period; however, the trends in MMSE scores showed no significant differences (p = 0.068). Notably, the reduction in YMRS scores significantly varied across groups (p < 0.001, effect size = 0.342), with the folate group demonstrating a significantly greater decrease compared to both the folate/B6 (p = 0.003) and placebo groups (p < 0.001). Recovery rates revealed that 80% of patients receiving folate showed over a 50% decrease in YMRS scores after 3 weeks, markedly higher than the other groups (p = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings support the short-term use of folate as a beneficial adjunct in treating acute manic episodes in bipolar I disorder. However, the addition of vitamin B6 did not yield additional advantages. These results may inform future treatment guidelines targeting acute mania in bipolar disorder, advocating for folate supplementation as a potential strategy to enhance therapeutic outcomes.",

      "abstract": "Breast cancer (BC) remains a significant global health challenge, with conventional treatment approaches such as surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy. These approaches face limitations in targeting, toxicity, and efficacy. Liposomal drug delivery systems have emerged as promising tools for targeted breast cancer therapies. Liposomes can encapsulate both hydrophilic and hydrophobic drugs, improve drug distribution, and reduce the side effects. Passive targeting exploits the enhanced permeability and retention effect in tumor tissues, whereas active targeting employs small molecule ligands such as aptamers, folic acid (FA), transferrin, and monoclonal antibodies to specifically bind to overexpressed receptors on cancer cells. Aptamer-functionalized liposomes exhibit high specificity and affinity, folate and transferrin receptor targeting enhances cellular uptake and cytotoxicity, and antibody-conjugated liposomes improve drug delivery and efficacy by targeting specific antigens. Dual-responsive liposomes are sensitive to multiple stimuli and further enhance targeting precision. However, challenges remain, including tumor heterogeneity, limited penetration, and potential immunogenicity. Current research has focused on developing stable and effective formulations and exploring combination-targeting strategies to overcome these limitations. With further advancements, targeted liposomal drug delivery systems hold great promise in improving breast cancer treatment outcomes and reducing adverse effects."

Herein, a multifunctional nanoplatform, CMS@DTC@PDA@RuNO@FA (abbreviated as CDPNF NPs), was developed for highly efficient antitumor therapy, in which diethyldithiocarbamate (DTC)-loaded mesoporous Cu2MoS4 (CMS) nanoparticles were covered by polydopamine (PDA) layers and further covalently modified with a NO donor (RuNO) and a folic acid (FA)-directing moiety. Under the mild acidic tumor microenvironment (TME), the CDPNF NPs co-liberated DTC and Cu2+ in the tumor site, where in situ formation of the highly cytotoxic Cu(DTC)2 complex effectively killed tumor cells. Furthermore, under near-infrared (NIR) light irradiation, the CDPNF NPs could deliver nitric oxide (NO) and produce superoxide anions (O2•-), followed by the formation of more toxic peroxynitrite (ONOO-), which led to promoted cell apoptosis. Under 1064 nm NIR light irradiation, in vivo experiments with CDPNF NPs demonstrated an impressively high tumor inhibition rate (∼97%) while with good biocompatibility. This work represents an in situ activated approach for precision medicine that might imply its promising potential for clinical applications.",

In this study, boron carbide (B4C) nanoparticles were subjected to chemical modification, with the folic acid moiety linked to the surface of the particles by varying the segments of the covalent linker polyethylene glycol (PEG) through γ-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES) functionalization. The resultant products were three boron agents, termed as B4C-APTES-FA, B4C-APTES-PEG2K-FA, and B4C-APTES-PEG5K-FA. A comparison was made between these products and the pristine B4C nanoparticles by investigating their physicochemical properties and biological performances, including hemolysis, cytotoxicity, and cellular uptake. Subsequently, the modified B4C-APTES-PEG2K-FA nanoparticles were subjected to in vivo safety assays and biodistribution investigations in mice at various dosages. Upon characterization using ICP-OES, it was found that the boron contents were the highest in the lungs, followed by the liver, spleen, kidneys, hearts, and tumors, and the lowest in the brain and muscles. The boron content in the tumor reached as high as 50 μg per g of dried tissue weight after 24 h of intravenous injection (I.V.), while the tumor-to-muscle and tumor-to-brain ratios of boron contents were found to exceed 3 following 24 hours of intravenous injection. These findings suggest that B4C nanoparticles are promising for BNCT owing to their high boron content, satisfactory biocompatibility, and abundant chemical modification sites."

In this study, we synthesized folic acid (FA) conjugated amphiphilic copolymers via reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization to enhance the targeted delivery of donepezil (DZP) to the brain. The copolymers were self-assembled into micelles and extensively characterized for their size, zeta potential, and stability using dynamic light scattering (DLS) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The micelles were further evaluated for their ability to cross an in vitro BBB model and their cellular uptake by brain endothelial cells. FA conjugation was employed to exploit the folate receptor-mediated transport mechanism, which has shown potential for improving drug delivery across the BBB. This study demonstrates the feasibility of using FA functionalized micelles as a targeted delivery system, offering potential advancements in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease."

This study aims to sort out the causal relationship between micronutrients (zinc, copper, magnesium, vitamins A, C, E, D, B6, and B12, folic acid, iron, carotene, selenium, calcium, and potassium) and OA. This study used Mendelian randomization (MR) to combining the causal relationship between micronutrients and the risk of OA. Micronutrient-related variants were extracted from a large-scale genome-wide association study (GWAS) database of circulating micronutrients in European populations. Outcome data were from the FINNGEN meta-analysis of OA in participants of European ancestry from the FinnGen Biobank in Finland. The primary analysis was performed using the inverse-variance weighted (IVW) method, and a series of sensitivity analyses and multi-dimensionality analyses were conducted to detect possible violations of the MR assumptions. This study used the IVW method to analyze the causal relationship between 15 micronutrients and OA. The results showed that copper (P = 0.535), selenium (P = 0.463), folic acid (P = 0.664), carotene (P = 0.706), potassium (P = 0.839), vitamin D (P = 0.941), vitamin C (P = 0.928), vitamin B12 (P = 0.859), iron (P = 0.496), vitamin E (P = 0.678), magnesium (P = 0.934), vitamin B6 (P = 0.027), calcium (P = 0.743), and vitamin A (P = 0.368) had no significant causal relationship with OA. Among them, vitamin B6 showed P < 0.05 in the pleiotropy test, indicating the presence of pleiotropy. In contrast, zinc exhibited a significant causal relationship with OA (P < 0.001, OR 95% CI = 1.044 [1.021-1.067]), with sensitivity analyses further validating the robustness and reliability of this finding. This study reveals a causal relationship between zinc and OA, identifying zinc as a risk factor for OA. It provides evidence of causality between zinc and OA, offering novel insights for clinical research, diagnosis, and treatment of OA."

      "abstract": "Breast cancer (BC) is recognized as the most typical cancer diagnosed in women globally, posing significant public health challenges. Several protein-based biological macromolecules have been investigated for drug delivery in BC treatment due to biological and tunable mechanical properties. Silk fibroin (SF)-based hydrogel/scaffold is gaining attraction in BC therapy. The functionalization of SF with folic acid or antibodies enables targeted delivery to BC cells that overexpress folate receptors. In this context, this perspective article explored the potential biological activity, targeting capacity, functionalization, and drug carrier abilities of SF-based hydrogel for BC therapy. In addition, the article exclusively delves into the potential molecular pathways of SF-based hydrogel/ scaffolds for targeted therapy in BC. The article also summarizes the perspectives on the diagnosis abilities of SF-based hydrogel/ scaffolds in BC treatment, making it the first instance of such perspective literature. This insightful literature presents practical guidance for researchers, clinicians, and scientists eager to investigate the innovative biological applications and targeting potential of SF-based hydrogels and scaffolds in advancing breast cancer treatments."

In the present study, a polymeric micelle composed of folic acid (FA), heparin (HEP), dexamethasone (DEX), and (FA-PEG-HEP-CA-TOC) was developed for the delivery of doxorubicin (DOX) to leukemic cells. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: FA-HEP-DEX was synthesized and characterized by 1H-NMR. DOX-loaded micelles were prepared using a dialysis method. The impact of various processing variables, including polymer-to-drug ratio, dialysis temperature, and solvent type, on the physicochemical properties of the micelles were evaluated. In vitro, cellular uptake and cytotoxicity of the micelles in folate receptor-positive (K562) and negative (HepG2) cells were evaluated. FINDINGS/RESULTS: The 1H-NMR results confirmed the successful synthesis of FA-HEP-DEX. DOX-loaded micelles exhibited an average particle size of 117 to 181 nm with a high drug entrapment efficiency (36% to 71%). DOX-loaded micelles also showed sustained drug-release behavior. DOX-loaded FA-HEP-DEX micelles exhibited higher cellular uptake and in vitro cytotoxicity than free DOX and DOX-loaded HEP-DEX micelles in K562 cells. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: DOX was well incorporated into the micelles with high entrapment efficiency due to high solubility of DOX in DEX as the hydrophobic component of the micelle structure. The higher cellular uptake and cell toxicity of targeted micelles correspond to the presence of FA on the micelle surface, which promotes cell internalization of the micelles viaspecific receptor-mediated endocytosis. Our results indicated the potential of DOX-loaded heparin-based micelles with desirable antitumor activity as a targeted drug delivery system in cancer therapy."

Following referral to our department, she underwent observation because CT scans showed that the lesions tended to enlarge. Subsequent MRCP confirmed a diagnosis of a mixed-type IPMN, prompting surgical intervention. A distal pancreatectomy with D2 lymphadenectomy was performed. Pathological examination revealed IPMC(pT1cpN0M0, pStage ⅠA). Postoperatively, the patient received adjuvant S-1 therapy. In the second year after surgery, CT and MRI revealed hepatic recurrence in segments S8(12 mm)and S5 (5 mm). mFOLFIRINOX was initiated, and after 8 courses, a follow-up CT showed the complete disappearance of both lesions, achieving a complete response(CR). mFOLFIRINOX was continued for 21 courses, without recurrence, over the subsequent year. This case highlights the efficacy of mFOLFIRINOX in treating recurrent hepatic metastases of IPMC and warrants further investigation.",

      "abstract": "Prostate cancer is the second most common malignancy in men, often presents at advanced stages, where treatment options are limited due to surgical intolerance and resistance to androgen deprivation therapy. Mild photothermal therapy (PTT) at 42-49°C selectively eliminates tumors while sparing normal tissues, but its efficacy is reduced by heat shock protein (HSP70) upregulation, which inhibits apoptosis. To address these limitations, we developed 2TToD@NPs, a multifunctional nanosystem combining second near-infrared (NIR-II) fluorescence imaging, mild PTT, and chemotherapy. The nanosystem, comprising an aggregation-induced emission agent (2TT-oC26B) and doxorubicin (DOX), targets prostate cancer cells via folic acid modification. Upon laser irradiation, 2TT-oC26B generates strong NIR-II fluorescence and thermal energy for imaging and mild PTT. Concurrently, DOX enhances tumor sensitivity to PTT by downregulating HSP70, reduces thermal resistance, induces DNA damage, and generates reactive oxygen species, triggering apoptosis. This synergistic approach overcomes the limitations of single-modality therapies. Our findings suggest that the multifunctional nanosystem effectively integrate precise imaging and targeted therapy, offering a promising strategy for advanced prostate cancer diagnosis and treatment."

The DOX loaded CaCO3 HMs (CaCO3/DOX) are co-encapsulated with ibuprofen (IBU) in the cellulose nanofiber (CNF)/sodium alginate (SA) hydrogels cross-linked by Ca2+. The loading efficiency of DOX in the CaCO3 HMs is 95.7 %, and the loading efficiency of IBU in the hydrogels is 97.0 %. In the weakly alkaline environment (pH ~7.4) that is characteristic of intestinal fluids of human body, the CNF/SA hydrogels are swollen and the encapsulated IBU is first released for pain control, and the release rate of IBU can reach 57.8 %. In the weakly acidic environment (pH ~6.5) that is characteristic of colonic fluids of human body, the CaCO3 HMs are decomposed to release the loaded DOX with a release rate of 50.1 %, which can be used for the treatment of colorectal cancer. The results of release kinetics indicate that the delivery of IBU is governed by first-order model and DOX by zero-order model. The developed sequential delivery system (SDS) can not only enable the release of DOX in colon of human body, but also simultaneously relieve the pain of patients during the chemotherapy of colon cancer."

      "abstract": "It has been validated that folic acid deficiency (FD) is associated with an increased risk of stroke and a worse prognosis. However, the specific mechanisms by which FD exerts its detrimental effects on ischemic stroke (IS) have not been fully understood. The results of this case-control study indicated that patients with IS had a decreased serum folate level, along with up-regulated long non-coding RNA H19 (lncRNA H19) and enhanced inflammatory responses. Meanwhile, it was corroborated that the serum folate level was negatively correlated with H19 expression and the systemic immune-inflammation index (SII). Similarly, FD was demonstrated to exacerbate neurological injury in the middle cerebral artery occlusion/reperfusion (MCAO/R) rats by up-regulating the expression of inflammatory cytokines and H19 in both peripheral blood and brain tissue. Notably, the alterations in the expression of these factors in peripheral blood were consistent with those observed in brain tissue. Additionally, in a co-culture of N2a neurons and BV2 microglia, FD promoted the transition of BV2 cells towards a pro-inflammatory state by up-regulating the expression of H19, which aggravated neuronal injury. Moreover, blocking H19 in BV2 cells mitigated inflammation and partially reversed the injury in N2a cells exacerbated by FD after the treatment with oxygen-glucose deprivation and reperfusion (OGD/R). These findings provide a more in-depth insight into the regulatory role of H19-mediated systemic inflammatory responses in the context of FD, suggesting the potential clinical utility of folic acid in managing ischemic brain injury."

      "abstract": "Nanocatalysis coupled with photothermal therapy is a potent anti-cancer approach, yet its clinical utility is limited by low concentration of tumor substrate, redox interference, and risks of overheating normal tissues. Herein, we propose an innovative closed-loop nanozyme approach that leverages the synergistic effects of catalytic and mild photothermal therapy (mPTT) to address aforementioned challenges. The strategy features a folic acid-functionalized iron single-atom catalyst (FeNC-FA), designed to exhibit exceptional multienzymatic capabilities and an optimal photothermal response. In the system, the engineered FeNC-FA is capable of inducing reactive oxygen species (ROS) storm and depleting glutathione (GSH) in the specific tumor microenvironment (TME) to initiate ferroptosis. Concurrently, the accumulation of ROS effectively cleaves heat shock proteins (HSPs), thereby enhancing mPTT. An intriguing aspect is that the increased temperature within the TME further facilitates the conversion of H2O2 to O2, alleviating hypoxia and providing a positive feedback circuit to boost catalytic therapy. Additionally, the advanced photoacoustic (PA) imaging capabilities of FeNC-FA allow for self-monitoring of their accumulation at tumor sites, thereby guiding the mPTT process. Taken together, it provides a PA image-guided, mutually reinforced catalytic and mild photothermal synergistic tumor therapy both in vitro and in vivo. This targeted and synergistic strategy holds great promise for personalized medicine applications.",

      "abstract": "We and others have previously shown that uncoupling of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) induces oxidative stress in diabetes, contributing to endothelial dysfunction. Activation of NADPH oxidase (NOX) isoform NOX1 by angiotensin II (Ang II) triggers eNOS uncoupling via deficiency in dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced type 1 diabetic mice. Presently, we investigated whether accelerated atherosclerosis is attenuated in apoE/NOX1 double knockout, and whether mice overexpressing DHFR in the endothelium (tg-EC-DHFR, generated in house) recouples eNOS to alleviate diabetic atherogenesis. At baseline, endothelial-specific DHFR overexpression recoupled eNOS and improved vasorelaxation in the aortas and mesenteric arteries of STZ-induced diabetic mice. Accelerated atherogenesis in STZ/high-fat diet (HFD) treated apoE-/- mice was markedly abrogated in tg-EC-DHFR background, establishing an important role of endothelial DHFR in maintaining vascular function and protecting from diabetic atherogenesis. Moreover, by crossing apoE-/- with NOX1 null mice (NOX1-/y), we found that NOX1 deletion markedly diminished atherosclerotic lesion formation in HFD + STZ-treated apoE-/-/NOX1-/y mice, indicating that NOX1 lies upstream of eNOS uncoupling in facilitating diabetic atherogenesis. Oral administration with folic acid (FA), shown to upregulate DHFR, robustly attenuated atherosclerotic lesion formation in HFD + STZ-treated apoE-/- mice similarly to NOX1 deletion. Taken together, our data for the first time demonstrate that endothelial DHFR plays an important role in the preservation of endothelial function and inhibition of atherosclerosis in diabetes, deficiency of which consequent to NOX1 activation mediates eNOS uncoupling driven lesion formation. Strategies targeting uncoupled eNOS prove to be robust treatment options for diabetic endothelial dysfunction and atherogenesis.",

Icaritin (ICA) is the metabolites of icariin, a natural flavonoid glycoside compound derived from the stems and leaves of Epimedium. It has broad spectrum antitumor activity and inhibits the proliferation, migration, and invasion of CRC cells, and causes S phase cell cycle arrest. It exerts its antitumor effects against CRC through repressing autophagy to promote CRC cell apoptosis via interfering the HSP90-TXNDC9 interactions. The safety and efficacy of ICA are also affirmed in a mouse xenograft model. Additionally, to test whether ICA exerts synergistic effects with low-temperature photothermal therapy (LTPTT), a novel nanodrug delivery system, employing SiO2 nanocarriers, is designed aiming to load ICA with photothermal materials polydopamine (PDA), and folic acid (FA). This SiO2/Ica-PDA-FA multifunctional nanocomposite actively targets tumor tissues through the high affinity of FA for cancer cells. Once internalized, the acidic intracellular environment triggers the controlled release of ICA, inhibiting HSP90-TXNDC9 interactions. By LTPTT and ICA drug therapy under near-infrared illumination, a dual synergistic antitumor effect is achieved, holding promise for enhancing therapeutic outcomes in CRC treatment."

However, it is difficult for 5-ALA to target specific cells and, therefore, to accumulate within deeper lesions, leading to poor conversion of protoporphyrin IX, the active photodynamic agent. To solve this problem, targeted nanogels were developed for controlled 5-ALA delivery. Here, nanogels with folic acid as a targeting ligand were prepared by inverse microemulsion polymerization using the peptide cross-linker acryl-PLGLAGK(Alloc)-NH2, a generic substrate for matrix metalloproteinases, enzymes associated with many tumors. The stability, entrapment efficiency, drug loading, and drug release ability of the nanogels were studied with skin cancer cells (A2058) and showed that the targeting nanogels enhanced the concentration of 5-ALA in tumor cells and improved the efficiency of PDT in vitro. In vivo experiments showed that the targeting nanogels loaded with 5-ALA dramatically inhibited the development of skin cancer.",

This study assessed the hypothesis whether considering PTS with additional clinical parameters better predicts the treatment benefit of targeted first-line treatment. METHODS: In FIRE-3, first-line treatment with folinic acid, fluorouracil and irinotecan (FOLFIRI) plus cetuximab (FOLFIRI/Cet) was compared to FOLFIRI plus bevacizumab (FOLFIRI/Bev) in patients with RAS-WT mCRC and unresectable metastasis. We evaluated whether combining PTS with number of metastatic sites (NOM), liver-limited disease status (LLD), age, sex, or carcinoembryonic antigen level (CEA) better predicts treatment benefit regarding overall survival (OS). Here, Cox regression models with second-order interactions were applied. Further, the results were validated by policy learning and Lasso regression analysis. FINDINGS: Among 400 RAS-WT mCRC patients, combining PTS with LLD status in a Cox regression model outperformed PTS alone for predicted treatment benefit (P = 0·005; c‑index=0·603). Significant OS benefit from FOLFIRI/Cet over FOLFIRI/Bev was observed in LC/non-LLD patients (HR=0·62; 95 %-confidence interval [CI]=0·46-0·82; P = 0·002), but mitigated in LC/LLD patients (HR=0·83; 95 %-CI=0·53-1·29; P = 0·400). In RC/non-LLD patients, FOLFIRI/Bev demonstrated a significant OS advantage over FOLFIRI/Cet (HR=2·09; 95 %‑CI=1·20-3·63; P = 0·010). However, RC/LLD patients showed potential benefit from FOLFIRI/Cet, though not statistically significant (HR=0·59; 95 %-CI=0·25-1·39; P = 0·218). INTERPRETATION: Incorporating PTS and LLD status might improve selection of targeted first-line treatment in RAS-WT mCRC patients. FOLFIRI/Cet appears to be particularly beneficial for LC/non-LLD patients with mitigated benefit in patients with LC/LLD. In contrast, FOLFIRI/Bev is significantly favoured over FOLFIRI/Cet in patients with RC/non-LLD. Notably, RC/LLD patients may still benefit from anti-EGFR therapy despite right-sided primary tumor. These results are hypothesis-generating and warrant further validation.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Sorafenib (SF) is a small molecule involved in tumor proliferation and angiogenesis. SF is inhibitor of several kinases, including RAF, VEGFR, and PDGFR. However the weak targeting ability of SF for liver tumor tissues is the major problem in clinical therapy. Therefore, a SF-loaded folic acid-targeted liposome drug delivery system was devised for targeting liver tumor therapy in this study. METHODS: Folic acid (FA), HSPC, DSPE-PEG2k, CHO, and SF were composed to prepare a folic acid-targeted SF-loaded liposome (LSF) drug delivery system. LSF and drug loading content was established through thin-film-hydration technique and HPLC, respectively. The particle size and stability of LSF were examined by dynamic light scattering (DLS). The inhibition effect of LSF was elucidated in vitro on liver cancer cells through cell cytotoxicity and apoptosis experiments. The tumor-inhibiting efficacy was measured on liver xenograft model. RESULTS: The drug loading content (DLC) of LSF was 3.6%. The diameter of LSF was 197.1±16.6 nm, and LSF was stable during 24 h. Liver cancer cells could be effectively inhibited by LSF in vitro. LSF could substantially induce apoptosis. Also, LSF could inhibit tumor growth effectively in vivo. LSF could reduce side effects of SF demonstrated by bio-safety tests. CONCLUSION: LSF is a FA-targeted drug delivery system that could effectively inhibit the progression of liver cancer.",

Herein, we examined the efficacy and safety of folinic acid, 5-fluorouracil, oxaliplatin, and irinotecan (FOLFOXIRI) as upfront therapy for marginally unresectable local rectal cancers without distant metastasis. METHODS: This multicenter, prospective, observational study was designed by the Yokohama Colorectal Cancer Study Group. The primary endpoint was the conversion rate. Secondary endpoints were the R0 resection rate, response rate, pathological response rate, postoperative complication rate, relapse-free survival, local progression-free rate, and circumferential resection margin-negative rate. RESULTS: Twenty patients were enrolled in this study. The study achieved its primary endpoint; the R0 resection rate was 80% (95% confidence interval, 56.3 to 94.3). Major grade ≥ 3 adverse effects included neutropenia in 7 (35%) patients, anemia in 3 (15%), fatigue in 2 (10%), enterocolitis in 2 (10%), febrile neutropenia in 1 (5%), leukopenia in 1 (5%), diarrhea in 1 (5%), fever in 1 (5%), and urinary tract infection in 1 (5%). CONCLUSION: FOLFOXIRI therapy was well tolerated and showed comparable efficacy results, providing potential R0 resection in patients with marginally unresectable locally advanced rectal cancer without distant metastasis.

However, this association remains to be clarified in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) accompanied by kidney dysfunction. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted in 149 patients with T2DM (96 men, 53 women), including diabetic kidney disease. Serum concentrations of homocysteine, as well as vitamin B12, folic acid, and zinc, were measured in outpatient T2DM patients. The study subjects were divided into two groups: patients with and without metformin administration (Met [ +], n = 62; Met [ -], n = 87). To explore the effect of kidney function, we also analyzed the data after dividing all the patients according to kidney function (chronic kidney disease [CKD] group, n = 66; non-CKD group, n = 83). RESULTS: The Met ( +) group exhibited significantly higher serum zinc levels and lower serum homocysteine levels than the Met ( -) group. In the non-CKD group, metformin administration was positively associated with serum zinc levels, as demonstrated by multiple linear regression analysis adjusted for confounding factors (β = 0.287, p = 0.021). However, no significant association between metformin administration and serum zinc levels was observed in the CKD group. Moreover, there were no associations between serum homocysteine levels and metformin administration. CONCLUSIONS: The relationship between metformin treatment and serum zinc levels differed based on the presence or absence of CKD in patients with T2DM."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: In India, heavy menstrual bleeding or menorrhagia (Raktapradara) constitutes about 15% to 20% of all gynecological admissions in an institution. Of these, 43% of patients are aged 20-40 years. This condition is worsening because of the high prevalence of anemia among Indian women. Menorrhagia can have a significant impact on women's lives. Medical treatment is usually the first choice in excessive bleeding, but it reduces menstrual blood loss by only 50%, and up to 50% of women undergo surgical treatment within 5 years. However, none of these treatments proved their definite efficacy in spite of the high price and side effects. This condition presents a major financial burden on health care services. In Ayurveda, encouraging work has been done on the compound drug Ashokarishta, and the drug Trinakantamani pishti is indicated in Ayurvedic classics and the Ayurvedic Formulary of India. Also, these medicines have been used in Ayurvedic practice for a long time. However, no clinical trial has been carried out on these formulations. OBJECTIVE: The primary objective is to evaluate the efficacy of Ayurvedic intervention in the management of menorrhagia, and the secondary objective is to assess the efficacy of Ayurvedic intervention on the quality of life of the women with menorrhagia. METHODS: This ongoing study is an open-label, interventional, randomized controlled trial, with a sample size of 140 in the treatment and control groups combined (including 20% dropouts), and will be carried out within the duration of 36 months. Participants in the treatment group will receive Ayurvedic treatment, that is, 20 mL of Ashokarishta, 250 mg of Trinakantamani pishti, and 1 iron and folic acid tablet (100 mg of elemental iron and 1.5 mg of folic acid) twice a day orally for 3 months. Participants in the control group will receive a 500-mg tranexamic acid tablet thrice a day for 7 days from the first day of menses for 3 cycles and 1 iron and folic acid tablet twice a day orally for 3 months. The primary outcomes are changes in the amount of uterine bleeding evaluated by the Pictorial Blood Loss Assessment Chart, changes in the duration of bleeding, and attainment of a normal quantity of blood loss during the interval of cycles. The secondary outcome is changes in the Menorrhagia Impact Questionnaire. RESULTS: As of December 2024, a total of 79 patients have been enrolled. Data analysis should be completed by February 2026. The study will be reported following standard guidelines for reporting randomized controlled trials. Clinical results will be disseminated through conferences and peer-reviewed publications in a relevant journal. CONCLUSIONS: The Ayurvedic approach may provide an evidence-based therapeutic tactic for the management of menorrhagia.

However, the current rheumatoid drugs are accompanied by severe side effects and have limited anti-inflammatory capabilities. In this work, we designed a bioactive material-folic acid modified layered double hydroxides (FA-LDH), aiming at targeting M1 macrophages and modulating macrophage repolarization. The in vitro experiment showed that FA-LDH mitigated the release of proinflammatory cytokines and promoted the expression of M2 macrophage markers. In terms of the action mechanism, FA-LDH modulated the nucleocytoplasmic transport of the small mothers against decapentaplegic 5 (Smad5) protein by adjusting the pH within the immune microenvironment. Subsequently, relying on the interaction between phospho-Smad5 (pSmad5) and p65, the nuclear factor kappa B signaling pathway was down-regulated through inhibiting nuclear transport of p65. Additionally, FA-LDH exhibited excellent targeting capability toward M1 macrophages and strong accumulation capacity in inflamed joints. In vivo experiment showed that FA-LDH could relieve swelling of limbs, reduce the infiltration of inflammatory cells, and protect joint cartilage and subchondral bone structure in collagen-induced arthritis mice. In summary, this work introduces a strategy for utilizing bioactive FA-LDH in the treatment of RA, highlighting the potential of FA-LDH to alleviate inflammation and reshape the immune microenvironment through the pSmad5/p65 axis."

A 20-year-old young woman of Pakistani origin, previously independent and active with no significant past medical history, presented with vertigo, dizziness, tiredness, and muscle stiffness. On admission, she had a haemoglobin level of 23 grams/L, folic acid level <1.3 micrograms/L with evidence of haemolysis. Her peripheral blood film was consistent with severe haematinic deficiency. Following diagnosis of severe normocytic anaemia and non-immune extravascular haemolysis secondary to folate deficiency, she received blood transfusions and high-dose oral folic acid for three months. On follow-up, haemoglobin level had improved to 104 grams/L, folate levels were replenished, and she had resumed her normal life. She was incidentally found to have beta thalassaemia trait which explained the persistent mild anaemia. Hence, folic acid deficiency when significant may lead to severe haemolytic anaemia but shows excellent haematological response to treatment with high dose oral folic acid."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Renal fibrosis, characterized by the abnormal accumulation of extracellular matrix in renal tissue and progressive loss of kidney function, is posing a significant challenge in clinical treatment. While several therapeutic options exist, effective treatments remain limited. Inonotus obliquus (Chaga), a traditional medicinal mushroom, has shown promising effects in chronic kidney disease (CKD), yet its cellular and molecular mechanisms remain largely unexplored. METHODS: We analysed the chemical composition of Chaga using UPLC-MS and predicted its biological targets using PubChem and Swiss Target Prediction. We used single-cell RNA sequencing to study cellular responses in a mouse model of folic acid-induced renal fibrosis, complemented by spatial transcriptomics to map cellular location patterns. Histological assessment was performed using H&E and Masson trichrome staining. RESULTS: For the first time, we employed single-cell RNA sequencing technology to investigate Chaga treatment in renal fibrosis. Histological analysis revealed that Chaga treatment significantly reduced renal tubular damage scores [from 5.00 (5.00, 5.00) to 2.00 (2.00, 2.00), p < 0.05] and decreased collagen deposition area (from 11.40% ± 3.01% to 4.06% ± 0.45%, p < 0.05) at day 14. Through analysis of 82,496 kidney cells, we identified 30 distinct cell clusters classified into eight cell types. Key findings include the downregulation of pro-inflammatory M1 macrophages and upregulation of anti-inflammatory M2 macrophages, alongside decreased T cell responses. Single-cell sequencing revealed differential gene expression in proximal tubular subpopulations associated with reduced fibrosis. Pathway and network pharmacology analyses of 60 identified compounds in Chaga and their 675 predicted targets suggested potential effects on immune and fibrotic pathways, particularly affecting Tregs and NKT cells. Cell-to-cell communication analyses revealed potential interactions between proximal tubular cells, macrophages, and T Cells, providing insights into possible mechanisms by which Chaga may ameliorate renal fibrosis. CONCLUSION: Our study provided new insights into the potential therapeutic effects of Chaga in renal fibrosis through single-cell sequencing analysis. Our findings suggest that Chaga may represent a promising candidate for renal fibrosis treatment, though further experimental validation is needed to establish its clinical application."

The aim of this study was to examine whether pathological response to neoadjuvant FLOT can guide its adjuvant use. METHODS: Patients with non-metastatic gastro-oesophageal adenocarcinoma who received neoadjuvant FLOT and underwent surgery from 1 January 2017 to 1 January 2022 from 43 hospitals across 12 countries were analysed. Pathological response was assessed using tumour regression grading systems, trichotomized into minimal responders (MR; worst category), complete responders (CR; pCR), and partial responders (PR; between MR and CR). Survival outcomes of patients who did and did not receive adjuvant FLOT were compared using Kaplan-Meier, Cox regression, propensity score matched, and sensitivity analysis. RESULTS: A total of 1887 patients (459 MR, 221 CR, and 1207 PR) were evaluated. The median follow-up was 25.5 (interquartile range 15.0-39.1) months. In the MR group, there was no difference in disease-free survival (DFS; HR 1.03 (95% c.i. 0.78 to 1.36), P = 0.836) between those who did and did not receive adjuvant FLOT. Whilst there was a difference in non-adjusted OS, this became statistically non-significant after adjusting for baseline characteristics (HR 0.96 (95% c.i. 0.70 to 1.30), P = 0.801). In the CR group, there was no difference in DFS (HR 0.88 (95% c.i. 0.41 to 1.85), P = 0.724) or OS (HR 0.69 (95% c.i. 0.31 to 1.54), P = 0.343) between those who did and did not receive adjuvant FLOT. In the PR group, adjuvant FLOT conferred a significant DFS (HR 0.68 (95% c.i. 0.55 to 0.86), P < 0.001) and OS (HR 0.55 (95% c.i. 0.44 to 0.69), P < 0.001) benefit. CONCLUSION: Pathological response to neoadjuvant FLOT may guide the use of adjuvant FLOT, enabling personalized approaches to treatment.",

      "abstract": "Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are characterized by clinical heterogeneity and may be associated with cerebral folate deficiency (CFD). Among the causes, folate receptor alpha autoantibodies (FRAA) and variants of the SLC19A1 gene are commonly highlighted. The aim of this study was to analyze the rs1051266 variant of the SLC19A1 gene in patients with ASD and CFD and to determine its relationship with clinical and laboratory parameters. The study included 227 children with ASD, 156 of whom had CFD. FRAA detection, genotyping of the rs1051266 variant, and folate metabolism marker measurement (homocysteine, vitamins B9, B12, B6) were performed. FRAA binding was detected in 39.2% of ASD patients, blocking FRAA in 3.5%, and a specific soluble folate receptor in 13.2%. The 80GA genotype was the most common (46.3%), and homocysteine levels tended to be moderately elevated (upper quartile - 7.0). Significant correlations were found between homocysteine levels and vitamins B9, B12, and B6 (p < 0.05) and between verbal impairments and vitamin B12 (p = 0.043). In ASD and CFD patients, the 80GG genotype was more frequent (p = 0.03) and vitamin B12 levels were elevated (p = 0.021). In the ASD group, correlations were found between the 80AA genotype and demyelination (p = 0.020) and between homocysteine levels and demyelination (p = 0.042). In conclusion, the rs1051266 variant of the SLC19A1 gene modifies the clinical course of ASD. Patients with ASD and CFD exhibited high variability in folate metabolism markers. These findings underline the need for further research on folate transport genetics for personalized prevention and treatment strategies for ASD and CFD.",

Nivolumab monotherapy has shown efficacy against PM. However, the efficacy and safety of nivolumab plus FOLFOX (NIVO+FOLFOX) remain unclear. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively examined 15 patients with AGC with severe peritoneal metastasis who received NIVO+FOLFOX between January 2022 and December 2023 at our institution. Severe PM was defined as massive ascites and/or inadequate oral intake. RESULTS: Patients had a median age of 68 years, with 73.3% being male. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status 2 was observed in 20% of patients. Massive ascites was present in 86.7%, and 26.7% had inadequate oral intake. Combined positive score ≥5 was observed in 60%, and no patient had microsatellite instability-high. Median progression-free survival was 4.2 months [95% confidence interval (CI)=0.62-10.6], and median overall survival was 4.5 months (95%CI=1.48-22.5). Despite poor overall prognosis, 20.0% achieved disease control beyond 1 year. Of 13 patients with massive ascites, 38.5% responded, and 30.7% achieved complete ascites resolution. Grade ≥3 immune-related adverse events included sialadenitis, myocarditis, and hepatitis (n=1 each). No treatment-related deaths occurred. CONCLUSION: NIVO+FOLFOX was feasible for patients with AGC with severe PM, providing potential for long-term survival and ascites reduction.",

In this study, MSNs functionalized with folic acid (FA) and chitosan (CS) loaded with epirubicin (EPI) were characterized to evaluate the efficacy of these nanoparticles in inhibiting MCF-7cell line and in mice bearing 4 T1 tumor. MSN-EPI@CS-FA showed a high drug loading efficiency of 79.49 %, likely due to the large pore volume and surface functional groups on the MSNs. In both in vitro and in vivo studies, the functionalized MSNs exhibited superior efficacy compared to unmodified MSNs. Notablygene expression results revealed enhanced expression levels of proapoptotic markers (Bax, caspase 3, and caspase 9) and down-regulation of the anti-apoptotic genes (Bcl-2, cyclin D, cyclin E, MMP-2, and MMP-9) in cells treated with MSN-EPI@CS-FA, indicating apoptosis through the mitochondrial pathway. In cells treated with MSN-EPI@CS-FA, there were significant changes in reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, Malondialdehyde (MDA) content, and antioxidant enzyme activity compared to the MSN-EPI and EPI groups. In a murine 4 T1 breast tumor model, MSN-EPI@CS-FA more strongly than MSN-EPI inhibited tumor growth without drug accumulation in the liver or spleen and substantial targeting of the tumor, highlighting the efficacy of folate receptor-mediated active targeting in improving therapeutic outcomes. Therefore MSN-EPI@CS-FA exhibits significant promise as a potent anticancer therapy."

      "abstract": "Background: Sickle cell disease (SCD) is consequently associated with increased rates of infant and childhood morbidity and mortality. Therefore, early detection is a crucial aspect of managing SCD to mitigate complications and improve health outcomes for SCD children. Neonatal screening is the primary method for identifying newborns with SCD, enabling early diagnosis, family screening, and comprehensive medical care. The protocol presented in this paper describes a study aimed at screening newborns for SCD in high-prevalence SCD states of India to understand the magnitude of the problem and the benefits of early comprehensive care along with the genotypic and phenotypic correlation. Methods: A prospective cohort study will be conducted across seven sites in six states of India (Rajasthan, Odisha, Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, and Gujarat), having a high prevalence of SCD. The cord blood or heel prick samples of all the live-born babies delivered within the facilities of selected regions will be collected for screening SCD by HPLC (High-Performance Liquid Chromatography). All the sickle cell homozygous (SS) babies will be confirmed at 6 weeks for Sickle genotype along with cascade screening. Further, SS babies will be followed up from six weeks up to five years of life with initiation of folic acid, antibiotic prophylaxis, and hydroxyurea treatment at appropriate times. Results: The protocol aims to lay the groundwork for the smooth implementation of newborn screening programs and effective follow-up strategies. Conclusions: It will pave the way for developing a strategic framework for implementing newborn screening programs for haemoglobinopathies in India."

      "abstract": "Ferroptosis and pyroptosis, as emerging regulated forms of cell death capable of overcoming apoptotic resistance, demonstrate promising potential in tumor therapy. Given that iron manipulation and reactive oxygen species elevation serve as common stimuli for both processes, inducing lysosomal membrane permeabilization (LMP) with ensuing release of lysosomal contents (including iron ions and cathepsins) is anticipated to realize dual induction of ferroptosis/pyroptosis. Herein, we report a folic acid and croconaine molecule-functionalized upconversion nanoparticle (UCNP-Cro/FA) that is able to mobilize intracellular stores of endogenous iron and spatiotemporally control the lysosome-intrinsic Fenton chemistry, thereby triggering LMP-associated cell death. The process of endogenous iron mobilization occurs through two key steps: Cro-mediated coordination of abundant Fe3+ ions within lysosomes, followed by UV-emitting upconversion core-mediated photoreduction, resulting in Fe2+ ions release. Both in vitro and in vivo experiments show that UCNP-Cro/FA + NIR treatment effectively boost LMP by endogenous iron-mediated •OH production, ultimately triggering irreversible tumor cell death via ferroptosis and Caspase-1/GSDMD-dependent pyroptosis pathways. Moreover, this process potentiates tumor immunogenicity, holding promise for tumor immunotherapy. Overall, this work proposes a feasible tumor therapy strategy that integrates ferroptosis and pyroptosis through the efficient application and activation of endogenous iron.",

      "abstract": "Inflammatory activation and dysfunction of immune cells are essential events in coronary artery disease (CAD) pathogenesis. C-type lectin domain family 5 member A (CLEC5A) has recently been regarded as a potent modulator of inflammation, while its contribution to CAD remains undefined. This study aims to clarify the involvement of CLEC5A in atherosclerosis and explore its epigenetic regulatory mechanisms. Integrated methylome and transcriptome analyses identified CLEC5A as a DNA methylation-driven gene in CAD. Functional studies revealed that DNMT1 overexpression suppresses CLEC5A expression in THP-1 cells, with subsequent identification of the cg06744540 CpG site as the critical regulatory locus. Clinical correlation analyses demonstrated that elevated CLEC5A expression is inversely associated with hypomethylation at cg06744540 in CAD patients. Furthermore, CLEC5A overexpression significantly enhanced monocyte inflammation, migration, and adhesion, promoted macrophage polarization and lipid accumulation, and inhibited apoptosis. Mechanistic investigations revealed that CLEC5A exacerbates inflammation in monocyte/macrophage by activating the NF-κB signaling pathway. Conversely, CLEC5A knockdown resulted in opposite effects. Notably, treatment of cells with folic acid, a methylation-enhancing factor, significantly increased DNMT1 expression and declined CLEC5A expression. Consistently, folic acid reversed high-fat-induced CLEC5A expression and inflammation and suppressed the formation of atherosclerotic plaques in vivo. In conclusion, the epigenetic upregulation of CLEC5A through DNMT1-mediated cg06744540 demethylation contributed to monocyte/macrophage dysfunction, thus accelerating CAD progression."

      "abstract": "As one of the important components of placental structure, the integrity of placental trophoblast cells is crucial for placental function. When oxidative stress continues to act on placental trophoblast cells, it can cause changes in placental structure and function. Research has shown that folic acid (FA) has a certain alleviating effect on the functional damage of trophoblast cells caused by oxidative stress, but the mechanism of action is still unclear. Therefore, this study focuses on bovine placental trophoblast cells (BPTCs) to explore the effects and mechanisms by which FA regulates oxidative stress in cells, with the aim of providing a theoretical foundation for improving the reproductive performance of cows. The results show that, compared with the H2O2 group, the FA+ H2O2 group showed an increase in the cell proliferation index (PI), superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-px), and catalase (CAT) mRNA expression and total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC) of cells, while the content of reactive oxygen species (ROS) decreased. In addition, the mRNA expression of tight junction factors, nutrient transporters, placental functional factors, mammalian rapamycin (mTOR) and its downstream factors, and nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2) and its downstream factors in the FA+ H2O2 group increased, while the protein abundance of nuclear NRF2 decreased. After treatment with the inhibitor ML385, it was found that the protective effect of FA on H2O2-induced cellular oxidative damage was alleviated. These results indicate that FA can regulate the NRF2/mTOR signaling pathway, promote the expression of antioxidant factors, and alleviate the damage to the cell barrier and nutrient transport function in BPTCs caused by oxidative stress.",

Cancer cells overcome immune evasion as a major hallmark by downregulation of the antigen presentation pathway. Therefore, the present study aimed to explore the effect of genetic variants in genes involved in MHC class I and II pathways in patients treated with first-line chemotherapy in combination with targeted antibodies in metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) patients. Genomic DNA from the blood samples of 775 patients enrolled in three independent, randomized, first-line trials, namely TRIBE (FOLFIRI-bevacizumab, N = 215), FIRE-3 (FOLFIRI-bevacizumab, N = 107; FOLFIRI-cetuximab, N = 129), and MAVERICC (FOLFIRI-bevacizumab, N = 163; FOLFOX6-bevacizumab, N = 161), was genotyped through OncoArray, a custom array manufactured by Illumina including approximately 530K SNP markers. The impact on the outcome of 40 selected SNPs in 22 genes of MHC class I and II pathways was analyzed. We identified several SNPs in multiple genes associated with targeted treatment benefits across different treatment arms in our study population (p < 0.05). Treatment-SNP interaction analyses confirmed a significant treatment interaction with the targeted agents (bevacizumab vs. cetuximab) and the chemotherapy backbone (FOLFIRI vs. FOLFOX) in certain selected SNPs. Our results highlight a potential role for MHC SNPs as prognostic and predictive biomarkers for first-line treatment in mCRC, with differential effects based on the biologic agent and chemotherapy backbone. These biomarkers, when further validated, may contribute to personalized treatment strategies for mCRC patients.",

We report a case of a preterm infant. CASE REPORT: A 1-day-old Black Bantu African female baby was admitted to the neonatal unit owing to multiple congenital anomalies. The mother did not seek any medical attention until her early third trimester when she had an abruptio placenta. The mother has never received antenatal folic acid supplementation. The baby had microcephaly, low-set ears, right cleft palate and lip, micrognathia, contracture, and shorter limbs. A skeletal X-ray showed femoral hypoplasia. We report this rare case and highlight the challenges in diagnosis and treatment. CONCLUSION: This is an unfortunate occurrence. Early antenatal folic acid supplementation may have averted this. An early antenatal anomaly scan and investigation after abruptio placenta would have shown the futility of the case, and intervention could have been done sooner rather than later.",

It is a key component of the formula 'Shujin Pill', commonly prescribed for the treatment or relief of muscular dystrophy. However, the specific efficacy of BE within Shujin Pill or its primary active components remains unclear. AIMS OF THE STUDY: This study aims to elucidate the biological function and molecular mechanisms of BE in alleviating muscular atrophy in mice. We employed a comprehensive approach, integrating metabolomics, network pharmacological analysis, molecular docking, molecular dynamics simulation, and in vivo and in vitro experimental validation, to verify these effects. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The bioactive components in BE were quantified by UPLC-QTOF-MS/MS. To evaluate the muscle function indexes after 14 days of action of different doses of BE and to analyze the pathological changes in muscle tissue. Enabling network pharmacology to analyze the potential active components in BE for the alleviation of muscle atrophy, using computer molecular simulation for docking scores, molecular dynamics simulation to assist in the validation of the active components in BE, and in vitro experiments for the validation of the active components. RESULT: BE administered alone was able to slow down Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced muscle atrophy. 996 non-volatile components were detected in BE by metabolomics, and GAPDH, TP53, AKT1, TNF-α and IL-6 were more strongly associated with muscle atrophy by using web-based pharmacological analyses. Folic acid, Cycloartenol and Sesamin active ingredients have greater potential to treat or alleviate muscle atrophy, molecular docking, molecular dynamics detected that Sesamin and AKT both have high binding energy, in vitro using C2C12 skeletal muscle cells to verify the efficacy of Sesamin and BE, found that in the presence of the LY294002 (PI3K inhibitor) and GSK21417 (AKT inhibitor) treatment conditions, the elimination of the up-regulation of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway by Sesamin and BE and loss of biological efficacy. It suggests that BE may slow down or treat muscle atrophy through the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, in which Sesamin plays a major role. Meanwhile BE and Sesamin were able to enhance the antioxidant level of C2C12 skeletal muscle cells.",

Using folic acid (FA)-grafted OC, FA-conjugated DOX-entrapped magnetic OC (FA-DOX-MOC) NPs were prepared similarly for FA-mediated active targeting of cancer cells with overexpressed folate receptors. Considering DOX loading and release, the best conditions for preparing DOX-MOC NPs were an OC:TPP mass ratio = 1:4 and OC concentration = 0.2%. These spherical NPs had a particle size of ~250 nm, 87.9% Fe3O4 content, 53.1 emu/g saturation magnetization, 83.1% drug encapsulation efficacy, and 2.81% drug loading efficiency. FA did not significantly change the physico-chemical characteristics of FA-DOX-MOC compared to DOX-MOC, and both NPs showed pH-dependent drug release behaviors, with much faster release of DOX at acidic pH values found in endosomes. However, FA could enhance the intracellular uptake of the NPs and DOX accumulation in the nucleus. This active targeting effect led to significantly higher cytotoxicity towards U87 cancer cells. These results suggest that FA-DOX-MOC NPs can efficiently deliver DOX for controlled drug release in cancer therapy."

The standard of care treatment in the advanced setting changed in 2011 with the introduction of FOLFIRINOX (FFX) chemotherapy. However, it was highly toxic with significant risk of complications. We assessed the practice patterns of medical oncologists across Canada. METHODS: We performed a retrospective study of consecutive patients with advanced pancreatic cancer treated with FFX at eight Canadian cancer centers. Demographic, treatment, and outcome data were collected and analyzed. RESULTS: The median age of the patients was 61 (range 24-80), 43% were female, 96% had an ECOG PS of 0 or 1, and 50% had three or more metastatic sites. The median follow-up time was 20.8 months (95%CI 18.6-24.9). Physicians started FFX at the standard dose 31% of the time. Physicians prescribed GCSF for primary prophylaxis most when giving standard-dose FFX (30% of the time) in comparison to reduced dose with or without the 5-FU bolus. Dose reductions occurred in 78.1% of patients, while dose delay occurred in 65.2% of patients. CONCLUSIONS: Medical oncologists in Canada historically prescribed FFX to patients with advanced pancreatic cancer in a fashion that was not uniform, prior to the emergence of evidence for upfront dose reductions.",

DESIGN: The study used a decision-analytic Markov model to simulate the process of mCRC, including three distinct health states: progression-free survival, progressive disease and death. Clinical data were derived from the TRIBE2 trial.Costs and utilities were obtained from local public databases and literature. One-way sensitivity analyses and probabilistic sensitivity analysis were also performed to explore the parameters' uncertainty in this study. PARTICIPANTS: The main included patients were histologically confirmed colorectal adenocarcinoma. INTERVENTIONS: First-line and second-line treatment with either FOLFOXIRI/FOLFOXIRI or mFOLFOX6/FOLFIRI. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Costs, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated over a lifetime horizon as primary outcomes. RESULTS: Patients treated with the FOLFOXIRI/FOLFOXIRI regimen produced 0.08 QALYs in the USA while 0.04 QALYs in China compared with the mFOLFOX6/FOLFIRI regimen. The final ICERs for FOLFOXIRI/FOLFOXIRI were US$5127.70 per QALY and US$30 478.33 per QALY in the USA and China, which are below the willingness-to-pay (WTP) thresholds. In the USA, when the WTP was US$100 000 for each QALY gained, the probability was nearly 99.6% that the FOLFOXIRI/FOLFOXIRI treatment was cost-effective. In China, when the WTP was US$36 053.01 (3 × GDP) for each QALY gained, the probability was nearly 54.7% that FOLFOXIRI/FOLFOXIRI treatment was cost-effective. CONCLUSION: Patients with mCRC treated with FOLFOXIRI/FOLFOXIRI as first-line and second-line chemotherapy may improve health outcomes and expend financial resources more efficiently than mFOLFOX6/FOLFIRI whether in China or the USA, which benefits not only individual survival but also the health care system from a value perspective.",

This phase 2 study evaluated adjuvant chemotherapy with modified 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin and oxaliplatin (mFOLFOX6) after lung metastasectomy. METHODS: Eligibility criteria included colorectal adenocarcinoma, first curative resection of ≤4 lung metastases, and no prior chemotherapy. Treatment consisted of 12 cycles of mFOLFOX6. The primary endpoint was the 5-year overall survival (OS) rate, with the expectation of 50% (threshold, 35%) and a planned sample size of 100 (90% power; alpha error, 5%). RESULTS: Fifty-two patients were enrolled between July 2011 and July 2014; patient enrollment was closed prematurely because of slow accrual. Excluding four ineligible patients, the characteristics of the 48 patients in the efficacy analysis set were a median age of 62 years (range, 43-75 years), Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 in 45 patients, prior resection of extrathoracic metastasis in four patients, and postoperative carcinoembryonic antigen within normal range in 43 patients; the status of lung metastasis was single in 34 patients, unilateral in 40 patients, and metachronous in 41 patients; and a disease-free interval between primary tumor resection and diagnosis of lung metastasis of <2 years in 33 patients. The 5-year OS rate was 85.2% (95% confidence interval [CI], 71.4%-92.6%), and the 5-year disease-free survival rate was 60.2% (95% CI, 44.9%-72.4%). Forty-one of the 52 patients (78.8%) in the safety analysis set completed 12 cycles of mFOLFOX6. Grade ≥3 adverse events were neutropenia (50.0%), fatigue (7.7%), peripheral sensory neuropathy (7.7%), and other (<5%). CONCLUSIONS: Adjuvant chemotherapy with mFOLFOX6 is feasible, and may be effective after lung metastasectomy for colorectal cancer.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) usually invades the jawbone over the course of the disease. Hence, it is necessary to consider the treatment of the tumor and repair of the jawbone, and the treatment process is very complicated. However, conventional therapy for OSCC mainly emphasizes tumor removal, which often fails to address the repair of jawbone defects and destroys residual tumor cells after treatment. METHODS: In this study, we designed a composite hydrogel platform (SUMg) of sodium alginate loaded upconversion nanoparticles (UCNP) and magnesium particles (MPs), in which UCNP was coated with folic acid and chlorin e6 to prepare UFC. The physicochemical and biological properties of the prepared SUMg, including swelling test, element mapping, cell behaviors, in vivo osteogenic bioactivity and antitumor effect, were comprehensively evaluated. RESULTS: In vitro, SUMg exhibited high cytocompatibility and promoted cell viability, proliferation, spreading, and osteogenesis owing to the incorporation of MPs, with SU10 Mg having the most significant effect. Under 980 nm laser irradiation, UFC induced a photodynamic therapy effect and destroyed surviving tumor cells. In vivo experiments further confirmed that SU10 Mg could promote bone regeneration, and under 980 nm near-infrared irradiation, the UFC produced local reactive oxygen species in the tumor within 5 min. DISCUSSION: This work demonstrated the potential of SUMg in bone regeneration and inhibition of tumor growth, providing valuable insight for OSCC treatment."

      "abstract": "Timely antidote administration is a critical step in acute poisoning management. Awareness of poisoning patterns and the essential antidotal requirement could improve patient care with better hospital resource allocation. This study investigates the pattern and impact of antidotal administration on patient outcomes in an Egyptian tertiary poison control center, providing insights to optimize the antidote stocking of essential antidotes. A three-year cross-sectional study was conducted at Tanta University Poison Control Center from January 2021 to December 2023. Demographic data, poisoning characteristics, causative agents, and administered antidotal data were retrieved. The initial Poisoning Severity Score (PSS), total hospitalization period, and patient outcomes were also recorded. The included 447 antidote-treated poisoned patients showed near equal gender distribution and median age of 25 years. Atropine, oximes, N-acetylcysteine (NAC), and naloxone were the top administered antidotes among patients (48.3 %, 25.7 %, 19.9 %, and 11.2 %, respectively). Mortality and complications were recorded in 5.15 % and 20.8 %, respectively. Administration of atropine, oximes, NAC, and L-carnitine significantly improved all outcomes (p < 0.05). Although HBO therapy significantly improved mortality, it substantially increased intensive care unit admissions (p < 0.001). Despite folic acid administration significantly improved mortality and complication incidences (p < 0.05), its therapeutic efficiency is still questionable. Availability constraints of the digibind and botulinum antitoxin could affect patient outcomes. Administration of atropine, oximes, NAC, naloxone, and sodium bicarbonate was significantly linked to prolonged hospitalization (p < 0.001). Accordingly, the emergency department in each institution should regularly update the antidotal stock based on a review of the list of essential and commonly used antidotes."

A structured search was conducted across PubMed and Google Scholar, supplemented by targeted screening of guideline repositories from the American Diabetes Association (ADA), National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), and World Health Organization (WHO). Included studies and guidelines were selected based on relevance to diagnosis, therapeutic strategies, or maternal-neonatal outcomes, with exclusion criteria applied to non-English publications and non-clinical recommendations. A comparative analysis of guidelines from the ADA, NICE, and WHO was performed to evaluate prevalence, therapeutic approaches, and postpartum management. Early diagnosis, stringent blood glucose control, and multidisciplinary care with the aim to avoid macrosomia, congenital abnormalities, and neonatal hypoglycemia guide the management guidelines. Glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) (<6.5%) optimization and supplementation with folic acid are critically required prior to conception in all women with previously diagnosed diabetes. Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) and insulin pump therapy are valued but burdened by availability and access constraints. A postpartum visit with 75 g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) at 4-12 weeks is essential for the detection of persistent diabetes. Variation of diagnostic criteria among guidelines reflects the requirement for standardization. Expansion of coverage by insurance for CGM and preconception care is important for providing equal access. The cost-effectiveness of new technologies and health disparities in low-resource settings must be addressed in future research."

The causative organism enters into the subcutaneous tissue, usually of the foot, from contaminated soil or vegetative material through inoculation from a thorn prick, or repeated trauma. It commonly affects men, farmers and field workers. Differentiating eumycetoma from actinomycetoma can be challenging but is required before starting prolonged treatment. One of our patients presented with lesions on the thigh and in a sporotrichoid pattern that is atypical, while the other two patients were treated with antifungal medication for eumycetoma for years without proper investigation and improvement. Early diagnosis of actinomycetoma is mandatory to prevent tissue destruction, bone invasion and ultimate loss of function by proper investigative workup, histopathology and direct microscopy of discharge. We here report three cases of actinomycetoma with clinical and microbiology profiles treated successfully with tablets of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazoleand amoxicillin-clavulanic acid along with folic acid as proposed by the Cochrane systemic review protocol 2018."

Herein, we developed selenium-loaded octenyl succinic anhydride starch (OSAS) micelles functionalized with folic acid (FA) for targeted tumor delivery. The FA-OSAS-SeNPs were synthesized through self-assembly, incorporating SeNPs into FA-conjugated OSAS micelles. Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and UV-visible spectrophotometry confirmed the successful synthesis of FA-OSAS-SeNPs. The nanoparticles exhibited an average size of 131.66 ± 7.88 nm and a zeta potential of -19.54 ± 0.33 mV, with encapsulation efficiency and drug loading capacity of approximately 87.28 % and 8.96 %, respectively. FA-OSAS-SeNPs demonstrated good stability across various conditions, including different dilution ratios, temperatures, pH levels, and ionic strengths. In vitro studies showed that FA-OSAS-SeNPs exhibited significant targeted inhibitory effects on cervical cancer (HeLa) cells and markedly increased intracellular ROS levels, inducing apoptosis. This study presents a novel and effective strategy for targeted SeNPs delivery systems in tumor therapy, offering a valuable reference for future development of nanomaterials for clinical applications in cancer treatment."

      "abstract": "Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) has been demonstrated to trigger a variety of malignant neoplasms, however, there are currently no targeted pharmaceutical interventions available. MicroRNA(miRNA)-based antiviral and tumor therapies are frequently utilized, yet the challenges of cellular uptake and susceptibility to degradation underscore the necessity for a delivery system that can effectively combat KSHV. Nonetheless, despite the efficacy of nanocarriers in delivering drugs into cells, they continue to encounter challenges in penetrating the brain. In this study, a macrophage inflammation model was developed to enhance the delivery of miR-34a-5p loaded by folic acid-modified β-cyclodextrin grafted polyethyleneimine (β-CD-PEI-FA) nanocomposites, based on FA targeted to folate receptors on the surface of macrophages and tumor cells. Both in vivo and in vitro safety evaluations of the nanocarriers were performed, which confirmed the exceptional biocompatibility. Assays involving the coculture of induced nanodrug-loaded macrophages and KSHV-positive cells demonstrated the efficient delivery of miR-34a-5p into KSHV-positive cells through macrophages. This delivery led to the inhibition of the proliferation and cell cycle of cocultured KSHV-positive cells, as well as a significant reduction in the expression of KSHV pathogenic genes RTA and v-GPCR. Notably, fluorescence imaging of organs revealed the in vivo delivery of nanocomposites into brain tissues, including tumors. Furthermore, immunohistochemistry analysis revealed increased macrophages infiltration in both tumors and brain tissues in xenograft mice. In conclusion, our study presents a pioneering strategy employing macrophages as carriers for delivering β-CD-PEI-FA/miR-34a-5p nanocomplexes in anti-KSHV therapy.",

The primary endpoint was the difference in relapse-free survival (RFS) between the PPI and non-PPI groups. Data from 396 eligible patients were evaluated, 84 of whom received PPIs. There were 93 relapse events and 57 deaths across the groups. RFS rates at 5 years were 73.8% (95% confidence interval [CI], 62.9-81.9%) and 77.1% (95% CI, 72.0-81.4%) in the PPI and non-PPI groups, respectively. Cox regression analysis showed no significant differences in RFS between the PPI and non-PPI groups (hazard ratio, 1.16; 95% CI, 0.72-1.87; P = 0.539). Our findings suggest that the concomitant use of PPIs does not significantly reduce the efficacy of adjuvant UFT/LV treatment for patients with stage II/III CRC.",

      "abstract": "A woman in her 60s presented with persistent abdominal pain and jaundice. She had a history of BRCA1 gene mutation and was previously treated for triple-negative early breast cancer. Abdominal ultrasound and CT scan of the abdomen revealed a mass around the pancreatic head. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography showed a dilated common bile duct and a normal pancreatic duct. Liver function improved after endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography and biliary stent placement. Staging CT confirmed no distant metastasis. The patient underwent Whipple's procedure to remove the pancreatic lesion. Histology from the resection confirmed carcinosarcoma with positive margins, along with lymphovascular, perineural and nodal involvement. She was offered adjuvant chemotherapy with a combination of Folinic acid, 5-fluorouracil, Oxaliplatin and Irinotecan (FOLFIRINOX). Due to derangement in liver enzymes after one cycle of chemotherapy, an MRI scan confirmed liver metastasis. The same chemotherapy regimen was continued in a palliative setting, initially showing a partial response to the liver metastases, but subsequently resulting in a long-term complete radiological response. Pancreatic carcinosarcoma is a rare type of cancer with no clear consensus on the appropriate management. In this case, FOLFIRINOX palliative chemotherapy led to long-term disease control. Future studies on molecular profiling may provide insights for genotype-driven, personalised treatment strategies for similar cases.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Limited evidence is currently available on the role of liquid biopsy (LBx) in predicting the efficacy of anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) therapies in metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). METHODS: The CAPRI-2 GOIM is a phase II trial investigating the use of LBx-comprehensive genomic profiling (CGP)-guided, cetuximab-based treatment through three subsequent lines of therapy in patients with RAS/BRAF wild-type (WT) mCRC. LBx-CGP is carried out at baseline and at progressive disease to first- and second-line therapies. In case of RAS/BRAF WT circulating tumor DNA at progressive disease, EGFR therapeutic blockade is continued by combining cetuximab with a different chemotherapy backbone. The primary endpoint is overall response rate (ORR) by RECIST 1.1 criteria. Tumor molecular characteristics by LBx-CGP are correlated with treatment efficacy. RESULTS: One hundred and ninety-two RAS/BRAF WT microsatellite stable mCRC patients treated with FOLFIRI plus cetuximab with baseline LBx-CGP and assessable for response were included in the analysis. One hundred and thirty-seven patients with WT tumors for potential anti-EGFR drug resistance genes (RAS/BRAF/EGFR/PIK3CA/MAP2K1/MET/RET/ALK/ROS1/NTRK/NF1/FGFR, and HER2 amplification; 'negatively hyper-selected' cases) had 78.1% ORR compared with 54.5% ORR for patients with mutations [odds ratio 2.95, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.44-6.10, P = 0.001]. 'Negatively hyper-selected' patients had median progression-free survival of 12.35 months (95% CI 10.58-15.4 months) compared with 8.68 months (95% CI 4.87-12.1 months) for patients with mutations (hazard ratio 0.64, 95% CI 0.44-0.92, P = 0.017). High cancer cell clonality of pathogenic variants (PVs) correlated with worse median progression-free survival (3.55 months, 95% CI 2.57 months to NE) compared with low cancer cell clonality of PV (9.63 months, 95% CI 7.16 months to NE, P = 0.21). After first-line therapy failure, approximately one out of five patients had acquired PVs of potential anti-EGFR drug resistance genes, whereas RAS/BRAF WT circulating tumor DNA was maintained in most patients (78.5%). CONCLUSIONS: These results support the integration of LBx-CGP for implementing the efficacy and for optimizing the use of anti-EGFR therapies in RAS/BRAF WT mCRC.",

Despite the availability of oral chemotherapeutics like Nintedanib, its clinical efficacy is undermined by suboptimal pharmacokinetics, high systemic toxicity, and low bioavailability. To overcome these limitations, we developed folic acid-conjugated Nintedanib-loaded solid lipid nanoparticles (FA-NIN-SLNPs), which offer targeted therapy with enhanced delivery and reduced adverse effects, potentially improving patient adherence. Prepared through a refined nanoprecipitation and self-assembly method, FA-NIN-SLNPs exhibited a particle size of 220.5 ± 6.08 nm, a zeta potential of 32.1 ± 3.05 mV, and an entrapment efficiency of 98.3 ± 0.80 %. In vitro release studies indicated accelerated drug release at acidic tumor pH, with FA-NIN-SLNPs showing significantly enhanced apoptosis (86.65 %) in A549 lung cancer cells versus NIN-SLNPs (67.65 %) and free drug (23.53 %). Cellular uptake assays highlighted its targeted capabilities, while histopathological and hemolysis assessments confirmed its safety profile. In vivo pharmacokinetic and biodistribution studies further demonstrated superior lung-specific accumulation, positioning this nanoformulation as a promising, safer, and more efficacious approach for targeted lung cancer therapy.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the levels of homocysteine, vitamin B12, folic acid, and vitamin D in pregnant women with recurrent vaginitis and determine whether these parameters contribute to the etiology of the disease. METHODS: The study included 30 pregnant women diagnosed with recurrent vaginitis in their first trimester (group I), who presented at least twice between 1.5.2019 and 1.5.2022 at the obstetrics and gynecology clinic, and 30 healthy pregnant women in their first trimester without any complaints (group II). The vagititis group was compared with the control group for serum levels of vitamin B12, homocysteine, folic acid, and vitamin D. RESULTS: A comparison of the results between the groups revealed the following: homocysteine levels (μmol/L) were 10.75 (6.38-24.90) in group I (vaginitis positive) and 9.32 (4.26-17.10) in group II (control); vitamin B12 levels (ng/L) were 149.00 (63.00-328.00) in group I and 261.00 (126.00-544.00) in group II; folate levels (μg/L) were 10.56 (3.93-23.33) in group I and 9.48 (3.53-24.10) in group II; vitamin D levels (ng/mL) were 36.54 (23.65-75.68) in group I and 52.45 (26.57-105.00) in group II. Statistically significant elevation in homocysteine levels was observed in the vaginitis group (group I) (p<0.05). Vitamin B12 and D levels were significantly lower in the vaginitis group (group I) (p<0.05). CONCLUSION: In pregnant women with recurrent vaginitis, the levels of homocysteine, vitamin B12, and vitamin D may play a role in the etiology of the condition, and vitamins B12 and D may be considered for use in treatment.",

      "abstract": "A novel folic acid-conjugated, iron-based MOF (MIL-101(Fe)) loaded with 1,8-acridinediones (DO8) was developed for targeted photodynamic therapy (PDT) of HepG-2 cells. This composite aims to trigger an anticancer response through sequential PDT and chemotherapy. The nanocomposite exhibited high stability in a physiological environment with a pH of 7.4. It was also able to release DO8 continuously in an acidic environment with a pH of 5, which shows that it can adapt to the conditions in the tumor microenvironment. The MIL-101(Fe)MOF-FA@DO8 nanoparticles (NPs) with 30% and 50% DO8 have been studied in vitro under different conditions (light and dark) and have been shown to be compatible with living tissues and specifically target HepG-2 cells. The IC50 values of 50% DO8 and 30% DO8 loaded MOF-FA were found to be 88.67 and 105.9 μg mL-1 under dark conditions, respectively. Under light conditions, they demonstrated the highest efficacy in inhibiting tumor cell growth. The IC50 values were found to be 8.94 and 11.78 μg mL-1. Flow cytometry analysis of annexin V/PI-stained apoptotic and necrotic cells in HepG-2 cells treated with the modified MIL-101-FA@50% DO8 NPs at IC50 doses under both dark and light conditions indicates that the primary mechanism of cell death is necrosis, likely due to the enhanced formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) under light conditions compared to that under dark conditions. This increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation leads to extensive membrane rupture, resulting in significant cell damage after treatment with the modified MIL-101-FA@50% DO8 NPs. These findings underscore the potential of this nanocomposite as an effective PDT agent for targeted cancer therapy.",

      "abstract": "The progression of osteoarthritis (OA) is closely linked to synovial inflammation caused by an imbalance between M1 and M2 macrophages. To tackle this problem, we developed a liposome responsive to reactive oxygen species (ROS), modified with folic acid ligands to target M1-polarized macrophages, and loaded with the anti-inflammatory agent dimethyl fumarate (DMF). This liposome-based drug delivery system was designed to reprogram macrophage phenotype to remodel the inflammatory microenvironment in the joint cavity and alleviate OA degeneration. The liposome we prepared had a suitable size and negative zeta potential, with uniform size, good stability in aqueous solution, and excellent biocompatibility. Laboratory tests showed that these DMF-filled liposomes notably decreased high levels of ROS in M1-type macrophages and shifted macrophage polarization via the Nrf2/HO-1 pathway, which in turn lessened inflammation in chondrocytes and averted their apoptosis. Additionally, animal studies demonstrated that liposomes containing DMF exhibited notable anti-inflammatory properties, significantly reduced synovial inflammation, safeguarded injured cartilage, reversed changes in subchondral bone, and effectively slowed the progression of osteoarthritis in a mouse model induced by anterior cruciate ligament transection (ACLT). Therefore, ROS-responsive liposomes targeting M1-polarized macrophages represent a promising and valuable approach for OA treatment.",
