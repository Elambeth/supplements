      "abstract": "Given the growing demand for protein sources and the premise of meeting global requirements, there is a need for more efficient use of by-products generated in the slaughter process, like pig heart, which in turn are highly nutritious and also have the capacity for techno-functional application. The pH-shifting technique using aqueous solutions allows the efficient recovery of proteins of high nutritional quality and with improved functional properties, but the muscle protein extraction could be improved using saline solutions that directly influence the yield and final quality of the protein isolate. However, the muscle heme pigments oxidize during extraction, generating a blackish color of the isolates, making their use in foods less attractive. An alternative would be to use nitrite salts in the extraction solution since they interact with heme pigments forming a reddish heat-stable nitrous pigment. Thus, this study aimed at obtaining and characterizing proteins isolated from the porcine heart (HPI), extracted with aqueous (HPIaq) or saline (HPIsal) solutions, stabilized or not with sodium nitrite. Treatments did not influence the isolates' protein content (89.0%), and HPIsal had a higher salt-soluble (53.8 vs. 47.0%) and lower insoluble (19.2 vs. 24.1%) proteins content than HPIaq. The total heme pigments and collagen contents were unaffected by the extraction solution, but they were higher in samples treated with nitrite (921.6 vs. 707.6 μg hematin per g). Saline extraction only reduces the color intensity (C* = 9.1 vs. 12.7), but HPIs extracted with nitrite had a lighter (L* = 62.4 vs. 59.2), reddish (h = 65.7 vs. 69.5°) and less intense color (C* = 26.5 vs. 30.7). The oil retention, water absorption, and emulsifying capacity (EC) of isolates were not affected by the extraction solutions, but the saline extraction reduced the emulsion stability (ES) and the nitrite-based-treatment reduced EC and ES. The isolates contained high levels of iron (165.8 mg kg-1) and calcium (53.7 mg kg-1), with higher sodium (85.6 vs. 8.7 mg g-1) and heme iron (62.5 vs. 58.7 mg kg-1) content in HPIsal than HPIaq. All the essential amino acids (EAAs) were found in the isolates, with a higher EAA index (160 vs. 128) and estimated protein efficiency (51 vs. 41) in HPIaq than HPIsal. The results indicate that the HPIsal has a high potential to be applied as a techno-functional protein ingredient in meat product formulations, while the HPIaq has the most interesting profile to be used as a food supplement. Treatment with nitrite should be chosen according to the application and interest of the food manufacturer."

      "abstract": "Gut microbial essential amino acid (EAA) provisioning to mammalian hosts remains a critical yet poorly understood aspect of host-microbe nutritional interactions, with significant implications for human and animal health. To investigate microbial EAA contributions in mice with reconstituted gut microbiomes, we analyzed stable carbon isotopes (13C) of six EAAs across multiple organs. Germ-free (GF) mice fed a high-protein diet (18%) were compared to conventionalized (CVZ) mice fed a low-protein diet (10%) following fecal microbiota transplantation 30 days prior and a 20-day dietary intervention. We found no evidence for microbial EAA contributions to host tissues, with 13C-EAA fingerprinting revealing nearly identical patterns between GF and CVZ organs. Both groups maintained their expected microbiome statuses, with CVZ gut microbiota dominated by Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes phyla. These findings raise important questions about the functional capacities of reconstituted gut microbiomes. Future studies should investigate longer adaptation periods, varied dietary protein levels, and complementary analytical techniques to better understand the context-dependent nature of microbial EAA provisioning in mammalian hosts."

      "abstract": "As one of the major environmental factors, photoperiod plays an important role in factory aquaculture systems, and the effects of photoperiod on organism performance appear to be species specific. To determine a suitable light photoperiod that optimizes production efficiency, the effects of three commonly used photoperiods 12L (12 h light):12D (12 h dark), 24L and 24D on body composition and antioxidant capacity of juvenile fat greenling Hexagrammos otakii were assessed. The initial weight of the fish in this feeding test was 11.07 ± 0.16 g, and the trial lasted for 30 days. The effects of these three photoperiods on growth performance were also tested. Juvenile fat greenling reared under 24D shows significant growth performance, with significantly higher feed efficiency and significantly lower feed rate. However, there was no significant difference in growth performance between the other two treatments. On the 10th day of the experiment, the hepatic antioxidant enzyme activities in 24L and 12L:12D treatments were all significantly greater than those in 24D treatment. However, at end of the culture trial, hepatic antioxidative enzyme activity was suppressed, and the highest malondialdehyde concentration was observed at 12L:12D, followed by 24L and then by 24D, implying relatively greater degree of oxidative damage to lipids and proteins in 12L:12D and 24L groups. The photoperiod affected the muscle fatty acid (FA) level, and the level of FA was significantly higher in the 24D group than in the other two groups. The levels of saturated fatty acids (especially C24:0) and monounsaturated fatty acids (especially C18:1n-9) were significantly lower in the 12L:12D and 24L groups. The effect of photoperiods on the total muscle protein content of fat greenling juveniles was limited. Nevertheless, an obvious effect on amino acid composition, especially essential amino acid (EAA) composition, was observed, and the EAAs in the muscle of juveniles were sharply consumed to physiologically adapt to environmental variations in the 12L:12D and 24L treatments. These findings suggest that constant darkness promotes better growth, body composition and antioxidant capacity in fat greenling juveniles and that a changing photoperiod (light-dark conversion) may cause more stress in this reef-dependent species."

      "abstract": "Under current dairy cow feeding conditions, the conversion efficiency of dietary nitrogen into milk protein is less than 30%. A thorough understanding of amino acids (AA) uptake and utilization in mammary in response to AA supply is essential for accurately modeling nutritional requirements. This study utilized bovine mammary epithelial cells (BMEC) as a model to investigate the effects of increasing total essential amino acids (EAA) concentrations (0.00, 0.97, 1.94, 3.88, and 7.76 mM) on AA uptake, metabolism, and casein synthesis. The control group (0.00 mM) contained the basal medium without any additional EAA supplementation. The EAA mixture consisted of Thr, Lys, Met, His, Arg, Leu, Ile, Val, and Phe, maintained at fixed relative proportions that matched those found in the mammary artery of dairy cows at peak lactation. Nine cell culture plates were used per treatment, with 6 plates for casein expression analysis and 3 plates for proteomics analysis. After 24 h of incubation with the EAA, cells were harvested for the respective analyses. The culture medium from 6 plates was collected for individual AA content measurement. Data were analyzed using SAS (version 9.4). Orthogonal polynomial contrasts were used to determine the linear, quadratic, and cubic effects of treatments. Significance was declared at P < 0.05. As EAA concentrations in the BMEC medium increased, protein expression of αS1-casein, β-casein, and κ-casein, as well as total EAA, total AA, and each individual EAA uptake (except for Lys) increased quadratically (Pquadratic < 0.01). Meanwhile, the uptake efficiency of total EAA, Thr, Met, Ile, Phe, and His decreased linearly (Plinear < 0.01). Moreover, with increasing total EAA concentration from 0.97 to 7.76 mM, decreases in the uptake efficiency of Thr, Ile, and Phe were greater than for other EAA. Lysine uptake efficiency showed no difference among EAA-treated groups (P > 0.05). The protein expression of key enzymes involved in Met catabolism exhibited significant decreases with increasing EAA concentration (Plinear < 0.01). In contrast, The protein expression of key enzymes associated with Lys (Plinear = 0.008), branched-chain amino acids (Pquadratic < 0.05), and Arg (Plinear < 0.001 or Pquadratic < 0.001) catabolism demonstrated opposite trends, showing significant increases with increasing EAA concentration. These findings suggest that when EAA supply exceeds BMEC metabolic requirements, further increases in EAA supply reduce EAA utilization efficiency without enhancing casein synthesis. Furthermore, individual EAA demonstrate distinct uptake patterns and catabolic responses to changes in total EAA concentration.",

      "abstract": "Accurate prediction of intestinal digestible flows of EAA (DigFlowEAA) is a crucial step for adequately balancing EAA supply to reduce the amount of CP fed to dairy cows, without compromising either milk production or the health status of the animals. The objective of this meta-analysis was to compare the performance of 3 dairy feed evaluation systems (FES) to predict DigFlowEAA (NRC; National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine [NASEM]; and Cornell Net Carbohydrate and Protein System version 6.5.5 [CNCPS]) in relation to observed net portal appearance (NPAobs) of EAA. Although the DigFlowEAA cannot be measured directly and none of the FES were designed to estimate the net portal appearance (NPA) of EAA, NPA could be predicted (NPApred) from estimations of DigFlowEAA minus the estimated metabolic fecal protein (MFP). This NPApred, however, would not include any oxidation for EAA or synthesis for Arg, a semi-EAA, occurring during the absorption process. Intuitively, the prediction errors should be smallest for the DigFlowEAA best predicted across the 3 FES and for the EAA not oxidized by the portal-drained viscera (PDV). The dataset included 83 NPAobs treatment means from 25 studies. To avoid type I error, mean and linear biases were considered biologically relevant if statistically significant and representing >5.0% of the observed mean (%obs.mean). The NPApred of branched-chain AA (BCAA) and Thr showed a similar pattern across the 3 FES, with all overpredicted relative to NPAobs (6%obs.mean to 27%obs.mean). The NPApred for the other EAA were more variable: (1) underprediction of Arg (9%obs.mean to 20%obs.mean) with NRC and NASEM, and Met (8%obs.mean) with NRC, (2) overprediction of Lys and Phe (5%obs.mean to 11%obs.mean) with NASEM, and His, Met and Trp (8%obs.mean to 14%obs.mean) with CNCPS, and (3) linear biases for Arg (7%obs.mean) with NASEM, and for His, Lys, Met, and Phe (5%obs.mean to 14%obs.mean) with CNCPS. In our previously reported meta-analysis, the mean and linear biases between observed and predicted EAA postruminal outflow were related to the site of digesta sampling (duodenal vs. omasal) for some EAA, but it was not possible to determine which sampling site was representative of the true supply of EAA to the cows. In an effort to solve this issue, predictions of NPA (except Trp) were recalculated removing the mean and linear biases observed in duodenal and omasal studies of our previous meta-analysis (NPArec_duo and NPArec_oma). Compared with NPApred, the pattern of BCAA and Thr remained overpredicted in NPArec_duo and NPArec_oma across the 3 FES. This strongly suggests oxidation of Ile, Leu, Val, and Thr by the PDV averaging, respectively, 12% (range 6% to 18%), 16% (range 14% to 17%), 24% (range 18% to 27%), and 19% (range 13% to 23%) of NPAobs across the 3 FES. The magnitude of PDV oxidation, however, would be related to the ratio of DigFlowEAA to digestible energy intake. The negative mean biases for Arg NPApred would suggest synthesis by the PDV. For the BCAA, Thr, and Arg, because of the uncertainty on the biological quantification of the differences between NPAobs and NPApred, the relative performance of each FES could not be assessed. Assuming no oxidation of the other EAA (i.e., His, Lys, Met, and Phe) by the PDV and an adequate estimation of MFP, their NPAobs indicate that the DigFlow of (1) Met is underpredicted by NRC, (2) Lys is overpredicted by NASEM, (3) His and Met are overpredicted with CNCPS, and (4) His, Lys, Met, and Phe present a linear bias with CNCPS, supporting similar observations on the postruminal EAA outflows from our previous meta-analysis. Based on current NPAobs studies and our previous meta-analysis on postruminal outflows of EAA, sampling digesta at the duodenum appears to be more representative of the true supply of EAA to the cows than sampling at the omasum."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Exercise and nutrition may be useful strategies in dynapenic and sarcopenic obesity management, but the identification of treatment modalities aimed at improving this condition is still lacking. We compared the effect of a five-month hypocaloric diet plus resistance training (RT) with and without essential amino acids (EAAs) on body composition, physical performance, and muscle strength among older adults with dynapenic obesity (DO). METHODS: Older individuals (n = 48) with DO [(BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2 and/or high waist circumference and low handgrip strength (HGS)] were randomized into two double-blind groups (RT without EAAs vs. RT+EAAs). All participants followed a hypocaloric diet (1 g of proteins/kg spread over three meals) and RT for five months. Pre- and post-intervention assessments included the body composition (DXA), Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB), HGS, one-repetition maximum (1-RM), and maximal isometric torque with an isokinetic dynamometer. RESULTS: Both groups reduced body mass (RT: -4.66 kg; RT+EAAs: -4.02 kg), waist circumference (RT: -4.66 cm; RT+EAAs: -2.2 cm), total fat mass (RT: -3.81 kg; RT+EAAs: -3.72 kg), and compartmental fat mass with no between-group differences. Both groups improved 1-RM strength (33-47%), isometric torque for body mass (RT: 14.5%; RT+EAAs: 10.6%), and functional performance (chair stand (RT: -3.24 s; RT+EAAs: -1.5 s) and HGS (RT: -2.7 kg; RT+EAAs: 2.9 kg)) with no between-group differences. CONCLUSIONS: A moderate hypocaloric diet combined with RT improves body composition and physical function in DO participants, but EAA supplementation did not provide additional benefits.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Although little is yet known about the long-term maintenance of very low-energy ketogenic therapy (VLEKT) effects on body composition, muscle strength and inflammation, it is plausible to assume that changes may occur, particularly during the steps following the ketogenic step, due to the loss of the protective effects of ketones and the concomitant reintroduction of carbohydrates. For this reason, the present study aimed to evaluate the effects of supplementation with 8 g per day of essential amino acids (EAAs) on these parameters. METHODS: A total of 68 women of reproductive age and with grade I obesity who had completed 45 days of the ketogenic phase with VLEKT (KeNuT protocol) and 40 days of non-ketogenic phase of KeNuT protocol with VLEKT (phase 3, fruit reintroduction) were included in the study. Half of them (n = 34) followed this first step of the re-educational phase of KeNuT protocol with VLEKT with supplementation with EAAs (Aminotrofic®: 4 g twice daily). Anthropometric parameters, body composition via bioelectrical impedance analysis and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) levels were assessed at baseline, pre- and post both dietary interventions. RESULTS: At the end of 45 days of ketogenic phase with VLEKT (before fruit reintroduction and EAA supplementation), the two groups did not differ in any of the parameters assessed. At the end of the fruit reintroduction phase, the supplemented group showed greater magnitudes of reduction in weight, waist circumference, fat mass (FM) and hs-CRP (p < 0.001 for all) and of increase in muscle strength (p < 0.001), phase angle (p < 0.001), body cell mass (BCM) (p = 0.001), and muscle mass (%) (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: These results underline the usefulness of supplementation with EAAs during the first transitional phase post VLEKT to improve body composition (specifically reduction in FM and increase in BCM), muscle strength, and inflammatory status.",

      "abstract": "It has been established that essential amino acids (EAA) regulate protein synthesis in mammary epithelial cells by rapidly altering the phosphorylation state of translation factors. However, the long-term transcriptional response to EAA supply has been investigated much less. Eight transcription factors were selected as candidate mediators of EAA effects on mammary cell function via the amino acid response (ATF4, ATF6), mitogen-activated protein kinase (JUN, FOS, EGR1), and mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (MYC, HIF1A, SREBF1). The objective was to determine if and when expression of these candidate genes was affected in primary cultures of bovine mammary epithelial cells more than 24 h after imposing an EAA deficiency, and to evaluate effects of EAA deficiency on protein synthesis, endoplasmic reticulum size, cell proliferation, and lipogenesis. Differentiated cells were cultured in 1 of 3 treatment media representing normal physiological concentrations of all amino acids (CTL), low lysine (LK), or low methionine (LM) for 24, 40, 48, or 60 h. Both LK and LM suppressed protein synthesis and activated ATF4 expression, indicating the classic amino acid response pathway had been triggered. However, there was no effect of LK or LM on endoplasmic reticulum size, possibly related to elevated ATF6 expression on LM. Expression of early response genes JUN, FOS, EGR1 and MYC was not elevated by EAA deficiency but LM decreased EGR1 expression. LM also increased expression of HIF1A. The EGR1 and HIF1A expression results are consistent with the decrease in cell proliferation rate observed. Variable responses in SREBF1 expression to LK and LM at different timepoints may have contributed to a lack of effect on lipogenesis rates. These findings indicate that EAA deficiency may inhibit mammary protein synthesis and cell proliferation through transcription factors.",

Oat is a promising high-quality protein source but it requires structural and functional modifications to diversify its application. The current investigation was focused on the impact of different powers of ultrasonic waves (200, 400, and 600 W) on structural and functional characteristics of oat protein isolates to improve its techno-functional properties. Higher strength ultrasound waves generated flat sheet structures which were observed while analyzing microstructure of oat protein isolate (OPI). However, non-significant variation in molecular weight distribution were observed in different treatments. At 600 W power of ultrasonic waves the protein fragments show local accumulation, increased α-helix content. Due to uncoiling of protein structure decrease in β-sheets and β-turns was also observed at 600 W. Protein turbidity decreased significantly under low power ultrasonic treatment (200 W) which significantly increased at higher power. Moderate ultrasonic treatment (400 W) promoted protein dissolution, and maintained a good balance between β-sheets (71.04 ± 0.08), α-helix (16.27 ± 0.02) and β-turns (12.68 ± 0.03), exhibiting optimized flexibility and structural integrity. Whereas, higher strength (600 W) significantly destroyed protein structure. The amino acid content decreased significantly with increasing ultrasonic power. The thermal characteristics of OPI remained unaffected after ultrasound treatment. In conclusion, modifications of secondary and tertiary structure induced by moderate ultrasonic treatment (400 W) improved functional properties of OPI. The 400 W treatment resulted in highest essential amino acid content (EAA) i.e., 22.75 ± 0.82 mg/100 mg and total amino acid content (TAA) i.e., 64.94 ± 2.7 mg/100 mg, which are significantly higher than WHO and FAO standards, suggesting best total and essential amino acid production in comparison to other treatments.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: More than half of patients with Crohn's disease develop intestinal fibrosis induced intestinal obstruction with debilitating symptoms throughout their disease course. The incidence of stricture formation in CD has remained unchanged over the last several decades. Factors promoting intestinal fibrosis are currently unclear, but diet may represent an underestimated risk factor for intestinal fibrosis by modification of both the host immune response and intestinal microbial composition. Evaluating the impact of diet on the course of IBD is very complex. Sarcopenia is a common problem in IBD patients and correlates with an increased rate of disease. Skeletal muscle index (SMI) is an important parameter to measure sarcopenia and is an easily accessible tool for evaluating the likelihood of complications in individuals with CD. METHODS: Using a randomized and controlled pilot design, we aimed to investigate the efficacy of 12 months of short-term dietary intervention based on essential amino acid (EAA) and sodium butyrate (NaB) supplementation in the management of stricturing Crohn's disease patients. RESULTS: After the treatment in the diet EAA/NaB group, we revealed a statistically significant improvement of muscle mass (61.49 ± 5.47 vs. control 86 ± 10.70, p = 0.01) and SMI index (9.97 ± 1.79 vs. control 7.60 ± 2.29, p = 0.02). In addition, the measurement of skeletal muscle mass in CD patients has been suggested to be crucial for predicting the disease course. Indeed, after one year, surgery was required in 4/10 control group patients (40%) and 1/10 study group (10%) patients, underlining the importance of body composition alterations and adequate dietary intake in the management of these patients. CONCLUSIONS: Further prospective studies are needed to confirm these results; nonetheless this nutritional approach could become an integral part in the treatment of stricturing CD patients to improve disease outcomes and increase the quality of life in these patients.",

      "abstract": "Over the past decade, plant-based milk alternatives (PBMAs) have gained increasing popularity. Several processing technologies, including heat treatment, are usually employed during their production in order to replicate the properties of cow's milk. These processes can trigger the Maillard reaction, producing Maillard reaction products (MRPs) and amino acid cross-links, which may alter the nutritional profile and digestibility of PBMAs. This study investigates PBMAs available in the Scandinavian market to assess their MRP and amino acid cross-link concentrations, aiming to understand the relationship between the formation of these heat-induced compounds and the specific chemical composition of individual PBMAs. Two types of UHT-treated cow's milk and ten UHT-processed PBMAs from different brands were analyzed. Quantitative analyses included early-stage MRPs (Amadori products detected as furosine), intermediate MRPs (α-dicarbonyl compounds and furans), advanced glycation end products (AGEs), acrylamide, and amino acid cross-links (lanthionine and lysinoalanine). Protein, carbohydrate, and amino acid profiles were also assessed using LC-MS and HPLC methods. PBMAs were found to differ substantially in carbohydrate and protein content, with soy-based drinks containing higher protein and rice and oat drinks having more carbohydrates. Essential amino acid (EAA) levels were found lower in all PBMAs, impacting their nutritional quality. MRP levels, such as furosine and AGEs, varied across PBMAs, indicating different heat-processing intensities. Specific α-dicarbonyl compounds, like 3-deoxyglucosone, were more concentrated in PBMAs than in UHT-treated cow's milk, and compounds like HMF, furfural, and acrylamide were also found in some PBMAs. Finally, correlations were observed between sugar content, α-dicarbonyls, and AGEs, which offer insights into possible chemical transformations in PBMAs during processing.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Essential amino acid (EAA) and omega-3 fatty acid ingestion independently attenuate leg skeletal muscle disuse atrophy in uninjured persons. However, no data exist regarding the effectiveness of combined EAA and omega-3 fatty acid ingestion to mitigate skeletal muscle disuse atrophy in response to anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) surgery. This pilot trial will explore the feasibility of recruitment and retention of ACLR outpatients from a single center across 18 months to consume either a combination of omega-3 fatty acids and EAAs, or a placebo control, for 4 weeks before and 2 weeks after surgery. METHODS: Thirty adult (≥ 18 years old) ACLR outpatients will be recruited for this single center, double-blind, two-arm randomized controlled feasibility pilot trial. Participants will consume either 5 g⋅day-1 of omega-3 fatty acids (fish oil) and 40 g⋅day-1 of EAAs or 5 g⋅day-1 of a control fatty acid mixture (safflower oil) and 40 g⋅day-1 of non-essential amino acids (NEAAs). Fatty acid supplements will be consumed 4 weeks before and for 2 weeks after ACLR surgery, whereas the EAAs and NEAAs will be consumed 1 week before and for 2 weeks after ACLR surgery. The primary outcomes are feasibility of recruitment and retention, with the goal to recruit 30 outpatients across 18 months and retain 22 participants upon completion of the study protocol following 12 weeks of data collection. These results will be reported using descriptive statistics, along with reasons and timepoints for study dropout. Secondary exploratory outcomes will be reported using inferential statistics for purposes of hypothesis generation and elucidation of mechanistic targets for future work; no inferences to clinical efficacy will be made. These outcomes include integrated rates of skeletal muscle protein synthesis, skeletal muscle protein content and expression of translation factors, skeletal muscle and erythrocyte phospholipid composition, and measures of skeletal muscle mass, strength, and power. IMPACT: This work will set the foundation for a future randomized controlled trial powered to detect an effect of EAA + omega-3 fatty acid intake on skeletal muscle size or function in response to ACLR surgery.

This study aimed to evaluate the effects of CP, E:T, and net energy (NE) on broiler performance. The treatments were as follows: T1-reduced CP (16%, RP), low NE (9.9 MJ/kg, LNE), low E:T (0.56, LE:T); T2-RP, LNE, high E:T (0.60, HE:T), with imbalanced EAA (excess Met and deficient Thr); T3-RP, high NE (10.4 MJ/kg, HNE), LE:T; T4-RP, HNE, HE:T; T5-normal CP (18%, NP), LNE, LE:T; T6-NP, LNE, HE:T; T7-NP, HNE, LE:T; and T8-NP, HNE, HE:T. The study employed as-hatched Cobb 500 broilers in two experiments. Exp.1 studied the broiler performance from d19 to 35, with eight replicates per treatment and 16 birds per replicate (n = 1024). Birds were randomly assigned to different treatments, and at the end of their lives, all were dissected to determine their sex and account for any gender-related effects. Exp.2 measured NE values in respiration chambers from d25 to 28, with six replicates per treatment, and two birds (a male and a female) per replicate (n = 96). The bird gender was determined through high-resolution melting curve analysis of feather DNA. The measured NE values were used to calculate NE intake (NEi) in Exp.1. The results showed that T4 improved (p < 0.001) weight gain (WG), feed conversion ratio (FCR), and NEi relative to T1, T2, and T3, and protein efficiency (WG/CP intake) relative to all treatments. The live performance (feed intake, WG, FCR) and NEi of birds fed T4 reached a level equal to those of birds fed NP diets (T5 to T8). These results suggest that a dietary E:T ratio of 0.60 is necessary to maximize nutrient utilization and to restore growth rate in broilers fed RP diets."

Forty FEP patients were enrolled at baseline, with blood samples collected before and after a 10-week antipsychotic treatment period. Plasma EAA levels were measured using an LC/MS/MS method. Psychotic symptoms were evaluated using standardized inventories before and after treatment. A decrease in BPRS score of more than 40% was used to indicate treatment response. Thirty-five healthy volunteers served as the control group. Baseline plasma levels of Thr, Met, Leu, Lys, His, and Tyr were higher in FEP patients than in healthy controls. After 10 weeks of treatment, Leu, His, and Tyr increased further, primarily in treatment-responsive patients. Conversely, Val level was lower than controls in patients at baseline and remained unchanged after treatment. Increased EAA levels were correlated with lower (less severe) scores in positive symptom scales. Treatment non-responders had persistently low Tyr/large neutral amino acid (LNAA) ratio. Tyr/LNAA ratio increased after treatment, specifically in treatment-responders. Phe/Tyr ratio decreased post-treatment in both responder and non-responder groups. Elevated EAA levels in FEP patients may signify compensatory responses to increased physiological demand for neurotransmitters or energy. Combining specific EAA supplementation with antipsychotic treatment may enhance treatment response in these patients."

      "abstract": "Sacubitril/valsartan improves outcomes in chronic heart failure (HF) with reduced ejection fraction (EF). The underlying mechanisms on left ventricular (LV) myocardial function are incompletely understood. In this study, 117 patients with symptomatic HF and LVEF ≤ 40% were enrolled prospectively. Noninvasive pressure-volume analysis was calculated from transthoracic echocardiography with simultaneous arm-cuff blood pressure measurements. Primary outcome parameters were LV end-systolic elastance (Ees; a measure of LV contractility), effective arterial elastance (Ea; a measure of afterload), and the ventricular-arterial coupling ratio (Ea/Ees). The mean age was 65 ± 13 yr, 30% were female, and 54.7% had ischemic heart disease. During 6 mo of follow-up, eight patients died, three withdrew their consent, and four were lost to follow-up. About 102 patients were included in pressure-volume analyses. After 6 mo of sacubitril/valsartan treatment, Ees increased (0.66 mmHg/mL [IQR 0.45-0.94] vs. 0.78 mmHg/mL [IQR 0.57-1.10], P = 0.001), Ea decreased (1.76 mmHg/mL [IQR 1.48-2.13] vs. 1.62 mmHg/mL [IQR 1.36-1.96], P = 0.014), and the Ea/Ees ratio improved (2.52 [IQR 1.88-4.05] vs. 1.93 [IQR 1.50-2.63], P < 0.001). LV end-diastolic pressure and LV volumes were reduced, and LVEF increased from 33% to 43% (both P < 0.001). Clinical improvement occurred in NYHA functional class, NT-proBNP level, and 6-min walking distance. Change in LVEF correlated with change in Ees (r = 0.33, P = 0.0008), while change in NT-proBNP was associated with change in LV end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP) (r = 0.42, P < 0.0001). In conclusion, sacubitril/valsartan is associated with improved ventricular-arterial coupling by enhancing LV contractility and reducing afterload. Beyond LV reverse remodeling, optimized ventricular-arterial interaction may contribute to the favorable outcome of sacubitril/valsartan treatment in HF with reduced EF.NEW & NOTEWORTHY The study demonstrates that 6-mo treatment with sacubitril/valsartan in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction is associated with increased left ventricular contractility, reduced afterload, and improved ventricular-arterial coupling. Together with reverse remodeling, these changes indicate a leftward shift of the operating left ventricular pressure-volume relationship. These data provide new insights into the understanding of pharmacological mechanisms in the failing heart and may facilitate tailored medical therapy.",

      "abstract": "The quantity of each protein in a cell only is only partially correlated with its gene transcription rate. Independent influences on protein synthesis levels include mRNA sequence motifs, amino acyl-tRNA synthesis levels, elongation factor action, and protein susceptibility to degradation. Here we report that the amino acid composition of a protein can also influence its expression level in two distinct ways. The nutritional classification of amino acids in animals reflects their potential for scarcity-essential amino acids (EAA) are reliant on dietary supply, non-essential amino acids (NEAA) from internal biosynthesis, and conditionally essential amino acids (CEAA) from both. Accessing public proteomic datasets, we demonstrate that a protein's CEAA sequence composition is inversely correlated with expression-a correlation enhanced during rapid cellular proliferation-suggesting CEAA availability can limit translation. Similarly, proteins with the most extreme compositions of EAA are generally reduced in abundance. These latter proteins participate in biological systems such as taste and food-seeking behaviour, oxidative phosphorylation, and chemokine function, and so linking their expression to EAA availability may act as a homeostatic response to malnutrition. Protein composition can also influence general human phenotypes and disease susceptibility: stature proteins are enriched in CEAAs, and a curated dataset of over 700 cancer proteins is significantly under-represented in EAAs. We also show that individual amino acids can influence protein expression across all kingdoms of life and that this effect appears to be rooted in the unchanging structural and mRNA encoding features of each amino acid. Species-specific environmental survival pathways are shown to be enriched in proteins with individual amino acid compositions favouring higher expression. These two forms of amino acid-driven protein expression regulation promise new insights into systems biology, evolutionary studies, experimental research design, and public health intervention.",

      "abstract": "Intracellular AA regulate milk protein synthesis within the mammary gland by modifying mammary plasma flow (MPF) and AA transporter activity. Amino acid transporters catalyze translocation using Na+ gradient, substrate gradient (uniporters), and exchange mechanisms; further, they exhibit specificity for individual AA or groups of AA with similar side-chain properties within each transport system. Nonessential AA are actively transported through Na+-dependent transporters and, thus, are often used as intracellular currencies for EAA transport through exchange transporters. Therefore, it was hypothesized that individual EAA supplementation would compete with other EAA for shared transporters, and supplementation with Ala, Gln, and Gly would stimulate EAA transport through exchange transporters. Ten primiparous lactating dairy cows were divided into 2 groups based on milk production and were randomly assigned to treatment sequences within 2 balanced 5 × 5 Latin squares by group. Period length was 14 d. Treatments were 9-d jugular infusions of (1) saline; (2) 34.5 g of Val per day; (3) a ratio of 32.7 g of Ala to 40 g of Gln to 26.7 g of Gly per day (AQG); (4) 43 g of Lys per day; or (5) 33.5 g of Ile per day. All cows were fed a common base diet formulated to contain 15.0% CP. Infusions of Ile, Lys, or AQG did not affect milk protein or milk production; however, Val infusion decreased both. The effects of Val infusion on milk protein production appeared to be partially driven by decreased DMI. The decline in milk protein percentage indicated that milk lactose production was also affected. Additionally, Val infusion increased MPF efficiency (MPF/milk; L/L) by approximately 44%. Infusion of Val tended to decrease or decreased mammary net uptakes of Lys, Leu, Met, and total AA. Infusion of Ile tended to increase its mammary net uptakes but did not affect any other AA. Infusions of Lys and AQG did not affect any mammary net uptakes. Infusion of Val tended to decrease Phe and total NEAA mammary clearance rates. Infusion with AQG stimulated Tyr clearance rates and tended to decline system N mammary clearance rates. Ratios of branched-chain AA mammary uptake to milk protein output (U:O) did not differ from 1 for Val-infused cows, which indicated that little intramammary catabolism was occurring. Additionally, the average NEAA U:O in response to all treatments except Val was 0.70, but Val-infused cows had NEAA U:O that averaged 0.09, indicating increased synthesis within the glands. The effects of Val on mammary net clearance rates of multiple EAA support the incorporation of AA limitations in ration optimizers to prevent AA imbalances. It is possible that oversupplementation of EAA other than Val may also decrease DMI and mammary activity. Identifying efficiency apexes for each of the EAA will allow more precise diet formulation and supplementation, leading to improved production efficiency.",

Here, as proof-of-concept, a tryptophan (Trp, an EAA) complex containing Argonaute 2 (Ago2) and miRs including miR-193a (Trp/Ago2/miR-193a) is identified. Trp binds miR-193a-3p and interacts with Ago2. Trp/Ago2/miR-193a increases miR-193a-3p activity via enhancing Argonaute 2 (Ago2) RNase activity. Other miRs including miR-103 and miR-107 in the Trp complex enhance miR-193a activity by targeting the same genes. Mechanistically, the Trp/Ago2/miR-193a complex interacts with Trp-binding pockets of the PIWI domain of Ago2 to enhance Ago2 mediated miR activity. This newly formed Ago2/Trp/miR-193a-3p complex is more efficient than miR-193a-3p alone in inhibiting the expression of targeted genes and inhibiting colon cancer liver metastasis. The findings show that Trp regulates miR activity through communication with the RNA-induced silencing complexes (RISC), which provides the basis for tryptophan based miR therapy.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Recently, many studies have been devoted to discovering nutrients for exercise-like effects. Resistance exercise and the intake of essential amino acids (EAAs) are known to be factors that can affect muscle mass and strength improvement. The purpose of this study was to investigate changes in muscle quality, myokines, and inflammation in response to resistance exercise and EAA supplementation. METHODS: Thirty-four males volunteered to participate in this study. They were assigned to four groups: (1) placebo (CO), (2) resistance exercise (RE), (3) EAA supplementation, and (4) RE + EAA supplementation. Body composition, muscle quality, myokines, and inflammation were measured at baseline and four weeks after treatment. RESULTS: Lean body fat had decreased in both RE and RE + EAA groups. Lean body mass had increased in only the RE + EAA group. In all groups except for CO, irisin, myostatin A, and TNF-α levels had decreased. The grip strength of the right hand and trunk flexion peak torque increased in the RE group. The grip strength of the left hand, trunk flexion peak torque, and knee flexion peak torque of the left leg were increased in RE + EAA. CONCLUSIONS: RE, EAA, and RE + EAA could effectively improve the muscle quality, myokine, and inflammation factors of young adult males. This finding highlights the importance of resistance exercise and amino acid intake.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Loss of muscle strength and endurance with aging or in various conditions negatively affects quality of life. Resistance exercise training (RET) is the most powerful means to improve muscle mass and strength, but it does not generally lead to improvements in endurance capacity. Free essential amino acids (EAAs) act as precursors and stimuli for synthesis of both mitochondrial and myofibrillar proteins that could potentially confer endurance and strength gains. Thus, we hypothesized that daily consumption of a dietary supplement of nine free EAAs with RET improves endurance in addition to the strength gains by RET. METHODS: Male C57BL6J mice (9 weeks old) were assigned to control (CON), EAA, RET (ladder climbing, 3 times a week), or combined treatment of EAA and RET (EAA + RET) groups. Physical functions focusing on strength or endurance were assessed before and after the interventions. Several analyses were performed to gain better insight into the mechanisms by which muscle function was improved. We determined cumulative rates of myofibrillar and mitochondrial protein synthesis using 2H2O labelling and mass spectrometry; assessed ex vivo contractile properties and in vitro mitochondrial function, evaluated neuromuscular junction (NMJ) stability, and assessed implicated molecular singling pathways. Furthermore, whole-body and muscle insulin sensitivity along with glucose metabolism, were evaluated using a hyperinsulinaemic-euglycaemic clamp. RESULTS: EAA + RET increased muscle mass (10%, P < 0.05) and strength (6%, P < 0.05) more than RET alone, due to an enhanced rate of integrated muscle protein synthesis (19%, P < 0.05) with concomitant activation of Akt1/mTORC1 signalling. Muscle quality (muscle strength normalized to mass) was improved by RET (i.e., RET and EAA + RET) compared with sedentary groups (10%, P < 0.05), which was associated with increased AchR cluster size and MuSK activation (P < 0.05). EAA + RET also increased endurance capacity more than RET alone (26%, P < 0.05) by increasing both mitochondrial protein synthesis (53%, P < 0.05) and DRP1 activation (P < 0.05). Maximal respiratory capacity increased (P < 0.05) through activation of the mTORC1-DRP1 signalling axis. These favourable effects were accompanied by an improvement in basal glucose metabolism (i.e., blood glucose concentrations and endogenous glucose production vs. CON, P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Combined treatment with balanced free EAAs and RET may effectively promote endurance capacity as well as muscle strength through increased muscle protein synthesis, improved NMJ stability, and enhanced mitochondrial dynamics via mTORC1-DRP1 axis activation, ultimately leading to improved basal glucose metabolism.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is characterized by hyperandrogenism, insulin resistance, and hepatic steatosis (HS). Because dietary essential amino acid (EAA) supplementation has been shown to decrease HS in various populations, this study's objective was to determine whether supplementation would decrease HS in PCOS. METHODS: A randomized, double-blind, crossover, placebo-controlled trial was conducted in 21 adolescents with PCOS (BMI 37.3 ± 6.5 kg/m2, age 15.6 ± 1.3 years). Liver fat, very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) lipogenesis, and triacylglycerol (TG) metabolism were measured following each 28-day phase of placebo or EAA. RESULTS: Compared to placebo, EAA was associated with no difference in body weight (p = 0.673). Two markers of liver health improved: HS was lower (-0.8% absolute, -7.5% relative reduction, p = 0.013), as was plasma aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (-8%, p = 0.004). Plasma TG (-9%, p = 0.015) and VLDL-TG (-21%, p = 0.031) were reduced as well. VLDL-TG palmitate derived from lipogenesis was not different between the phases, nor was insulin sensitivity (p > 0.400 for both). Surprisingly, during the EAA phase, participants reported consuming fewer carbohydrates (p = 0.038) and total sugars (p = 0.046). CONCLUSIONS: Similar to studies in older adults, short-term EAA supplementation in adolescents resulted in significantly lower liver fat, AST, and plasma lipids and thus may prove to be an effective treatment in this population. Additional research is needed to elucidate the mechanisms for these effects.",

      "abstract": "Lysine is one of the limiting AA in the diets of dairy cows and is typically fed as rumen-protected Lys (RPL). We hypothesized that supplementation of RPL during the postpartum period would improve the productive performance in dairy cows. Objectives were to use meta-analytic methods to explore the effects of feeding RPL on performance and blood AA profile in lactating dairy cows. An additional objective was to identify an optimal concentration (%) of Lys in MP (LYSMP) and determine if responses to LYSMP were associated with the concentration (%) of Met in MP (METMP). The literature was systematically reviewed, and 13 experiments, comprising 40 treatment means and 594 lactating cows, were included in the meta-analysis. All experiments had a nonsupplemental control (CON; n = 17 treatment means), or a group supplemented with RPL (n = 23 treatment means). Cows supplemented with RPL were supplied additionally with a mean (±standard deviation) 19.3 ± 10.3 g/d metabolizable Lys (5.1-40.6 g/d). Meta-analytical statistics were used to estimate the weighted mean difference in STATA. Mixed models were fitted to the data to investigate the linear and quadratic effects of LYSMP, METMP, and interactions between LYSMP and METMP. All models included the random effect of experiment and weighting by the inverse of the SE of the means squared. Cows that began receiving RPL in early lactation (≤90 DIM) or for an extended duration (≥70 DIM) produced 1.51 kg/d more milk compared with CON cows. Increasing digestible LYSMP from 6.5% to 8.5% linearly increased yields of milk, FCM, ECM, and milk fat by 1.8, 2.5, 2.4, and 0.10 kg/d, respectively, and tended to increase milk protein yield and body weight gain by 0.07 and 0.09 kg/d, respectively, without a concurrent increase in DMI. Interactions between the linear effects of LYSMP and METMP were observed for FCM/DMI or ECM/DMI. In a diet with low METMP (e.g., 1.82% of MP), a digestible supply of 7.40% LYSMP would result in 1.46 and 1.47 kg/kg FCM/DMI or ECM/DMI, respectively; however, with high digestible METMP (e.g., 2.91% of MP), supplying 7.40% of digestible LYSMP would result in 1.68 and 1.62 kg/kg FCM/DMI or ECM/DMI, respectively. Increasing digestible LYSMP from 6.5% to 8.5% linearly increased blood concentrations of Lys by 16.6 µM, whereas blood concentrations of Met and Ala decreased by 4.6 and 6.0 µM, respectively. Nevertheless, an interaction was also observed between LYSMP and METMP for blood concentrations of total EAA because as METMP increased, the positive response to LYSMP on total EAA was also increased, suggesting a competitive mobilization of AA and their utilization in various body tissues. Only 4 out of the 13 experiments in this meta-analysis involved primiparous cows; thus, insufficient data were available to understand the role of supplemental RPL in primiparous cows. Collectively, feeding RPL improved productive performance, and the increments were maximized up to 9.25% of LYSMP in multiparous dairy cows.",

Furthermore, the potential of enzymatically hydrolyzed C. pyrenoidosa protein extract (CPE) as a substitute protein source was investigated. The enzymatic hydrolysis conditions for protein extraction were optimized using single-factor analysis and a response surface methodology-Box-Behnken design. The R2 value of the optimized model was 0.9270, indicating the reliability of the model, and the optimal conditions were as follows: a hydrolysis temperature of 45.56 °C, pH 9.1, and a hydrolysis time of 49.85 min. The amino acid composition of CPE was compared to that of C. pyrenoidosa powder (CP), which was found to have a higher content of essential amino acids (EAA). The electrophoretic profiles of CP and CPE confirmed that CPE has a low molecular weight. Furthermore, CPE showed higher antioxidant activity and phenol content than CP, with ABTS and DPPH radical scavenging abilities of 69.40 ± 1.61% and 19.27 ± 3.16%, respectively. CPE had high EAA content, antioxidant activity, and phenol content, indicating its potential as an alternative protein source. Overall, in this study, we developed an innovative, ecofriendly, and gentle enzymatic hydrolysis strategy for the extraction and refinement of Chlorella proteins."

      "abstract": "Adequate prediction of postruminal outflows of essential AA (EAA) is the starting point of balancing rations for EAA in dairy cows. The objective of this meta-analysis was to compare the performance of 3 dairy feed evaluation systems (National Research Council [NRC], Cornell Net Protein and Carbohydrate System version 6.5.5 [CNCPS], and National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine [NASEM]) to predict EAA outflows (Trp was not tested). The data set included a total of 354 treatment means from 70 duodenal and 24 omasal studies. To avoid Type I error, mean and linear biases were considered of concern if statistically significant and representing >5.0% of the observed mean. Analyses were conducted on raw observed values and on observations adjusted for the random effect of study. The analysis on raw data indicates the ability of the feed evaluation system to predict absolute values whereas the analysis on adjusted values indicates its ability to predict responses of EAA outflows to dietary changes. For the prediction of absolute values (based on raw data), NRC underpredicted outflows of all EAA, from 5.3% to 8.6% of the observed mean (%obs.mean) except for Leu, Lys, and Val; NASEM overpredicted Lys (10.8%obs.mean); and CNCPS overpredicted Arg, His, Lys, Met, and Val (5.2 to 26.0%obs.mean). No EAA had a linear bias of concern with NASEM, followed by NRC for His (6.8%obs.mean), and CNCPS for all EAA (5.6 to 12.2%obs.mean) except Leu, Phe, and Thr. In contrast, for the prediction of responses to dietary changes (based on adjusted data), NRC had 2 EAA presenting a linear bias of concern, followed by NASEM and CNCPS with 4 and 6 EAA, respectively. Predictions of His showed a linear bias of concern (5.3 to 9.6%obs.mean) with the 3 feed evaluation systems. Measured chemistry of crude protein and EAA were reported for 1 or more feed ingredients of the ration in 36% of the studies, and resulted in decreased linear biases in the 3 feed evaluation systems. The difference in mean biases of Met outflows was systematically positive when comparing omasal versus duodenal studies. Predictions of Met outflows with NRC had a higher concordance correlation coefficient in duodenal (used to develop NRC equations) versus omasal studies, whereas the opposite was observed with CNCPS, the latter showing the lowest mean bias for Met in omasal sampling studies. The 30% difference in Met mean biases between sampling sites appeared related to a similar difference found for observed Met versus nonammonia nitrogen outflows between duodenal and omasal studies, which is independent of predictions. In conclusion, NRC and NASEM yielded accurate predictions of EAA outflows, with a small superiority of NASEM to predict absolute values, and slight superiority of NRC to predict the responses to dietary changes. In comparison, CNCPS may present mean and linear biases of concern for many EAA. Moreover, it remains to determine which sampling site is more representative of the true supply of EAA to the cows.",

Whether orally ingested exogenous ketones can stimulate postprandial myofibrillar protein synthesis (MyoPS) rates with and without dietary protein co-ingestion is unknown. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to evaluate the effects of ketone monoester intake and elevated blood β-hydroxybutyrate (β-OHB) concentration, with and without dietary protein co-ingestion, on postprandial MyoPS rates and mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) pathway signaling. METHODS: In a randomized, double-blind, parallel group design, 36 recreationally active healthy young males (age: 24.2 ± 4.1 y; body fat: 20.9% ± 5.8%; body mass index: 23.4 ± 2 kg/m2) received a primed continuous infusion of L-[ring-2H5]-phenylalanine and ingested one of the following: 1) the ketone monoester (R)-3-hydroxybutyl (R)-3-hydroxybutyrate (KET), 2) 10 g whey protein (PRO), or 3) the combination of both (KET+PRO). Blood and muscle biopsy samples were collected during basal and postprandial (300 min) conditions to assess β-OHB, glucose, insulin, and amino acid concentrations, MyoPS rates, and mTORC1 pathway signaling. RESULTS: Capillary blood β-OHB concentration increased similarly during postprandial conditions in KET and KET+PRO, with both being greater than PRO from 30 to 180 min (treatment × time interaction: P < 0.001). Postprandial plasma leucine and essential amino acid (EAA) incremental area under the curve (iAUC) over 300 min was greater (treatment: both P < 0.001) in KET+PRO compared with PRO and KET. KET, PRO, and KET+PRO stimulated postprandial MyoPS rates (0-300 min) higher than basal conditions [absolute change: 0.020%/h; (95% CI: 0.013, 0.027%/h), 0.014%/h (95% CI: 0.009, 0.019%/h), 0.019%/h (95% CI: 0.014, 0.024%/h), respectively (time: P < 0.001)], with no difference between treatments (treatment: P = 0.383) or treatment × time interaction (interaction: P = 0.245). mTORC1 pathway signaling responses did not differ between treatments (all P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Acute oral intake of a ketone monoester, 10 g whey protein, or their co-ingestion in the overnight postabsorptive state elicit a similar stimulation of postprandial MyoPS rates in healthy young males.

      "abstract": "In the global food industry, plant-based protein isolates are gaining prominence as an alternative to animal-based counterparts. However, their nutritional value often falters due to insufficient essential amino acids. To address this issue, our study introduces a sustainable protein isolate derived from yeast cells, achieved through high-pressure homogenization (HPH) and alkali pH-shifting treatment. Subjected to HPH pressures ranging from 60 to 120 MPa and 1 to 10 cycles, higher pressure and cycle numbers resulted in enhanced disruption of yeast cells. Combining HPH with alkali pH-shifting treatment significantly augmented protein extraction. Four cycles of HPH at 100 MPa yielded the optimized protein content, resulting in a yeast protein isolate (YPI) with 75.3 g protein per 100 g powder, including 30.0 g of essential amino acids and 18.4 g of branched-chain amino acids per 100 g protein. YPI exhibited superior water and oil-holding capacities compared to pea protein isolate, whey protein isolate (WPI), and soy protein isolate. Although YPI exhibited lower emulsifying ability than WPI, it excelled in stabilizing protein-stabilized emulsions. For foaming, YPI outperformed others in both foaming ability and stabilizing protein-based foam. In conclusion, YPI surpasses numerous plant-based protein alternatives in essential amino acids and branched-chain amino acids contents, positioning it as an excellent candidate for widespread utilization as a sustainable protein source in the food industry, owing to its exceptional nutritional advantages, as well as emulsifying and foaming properties. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: This study introduces a sustainable protein isolate derived from yeast cells. YPI exhibited considerable promise as a protein source. Nutritionally, YPI notably surpassed plant-based protein isolates in EAA and BCAA contents. Functionally, YPI demonstrated superior water-holding and oil-holding capacities, as well as an effective emulsion and foam stabilizer.",

      "abstract": "Aerobic exercise acutely improves cognitive function (e.g., executive function (EF); memory recognition (MR)) and increases circulating brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). In addition, branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) ingestion acutely shortens the choice reaction time and increases brain BDNF. We examined whether the ingestion of essential amino acid (EAA) supplements (mainly composed of BCAA) would positively impact on cognitive function and circulating BDNF after moderate-intensity aerobic exercise. Twenty-two healthy young men received either an EAA supplements or the placebo (PL) 30 min before undergoing aerobic exercise. The participants performed a cycling exercise at 60% of peak oxygen uptake for 30 min. EF after aerobic exercise was better after the EAA treatment than after the PL treatment (P = 0.02). MR (P = 0.38 for response accuracy; P = 0.15 for reaction time) and circulating BDNF (P = 0.59) were not altered by EAA supplements. EF improvement was correlated with increases in some amino acids (leucine, isoleucine, valine, lysine, phenylalanine; all Ps < 0.05) that are potential substrates for synthesizing neurotransmitters in the brain. These results suggest that EAA supplements ingestion had a positive effect on EF after moderate-intensity aerobic exercise, while MR and BDNF were not altered.",

An EAA deficiency can lead to cellular dysfunction and oxidative stress. This study explores the mechanisms underlying cellular responses to EAA starvation, focusing on ROS-induced DNA damage and apoptosis. MC3T3-E1 cells were subjected to EAA starvation, and various assays were conducted to assess cell proliferation, survival, DNA damage, and apoptosis. The antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (NAC) was employed to block ROS formation and mitigate cellular damage. Gene expression and Western blot analyses were performed to elucidate molecular pathways. EAA starvation-induced ROS generation, DNA damage, and apoptosis in MC3T3-E1 cells. NAC administration effectively reduced DNA damage and apoptosis, highlighting the pivotal role of ROS in mediating these cellular responses during EAA deficiency. This study demonstrates that EAA starvation triggers ROS-mediated DNA damage and apoptosis, offering insights into the intricate interplay between nutrient deficiency, oxidative stress, and programmed cell death. NAC emerges as a potential therapeutic intervention to counteract these adverse effects.",

The EAA solutions provided predicted limiting EAA in each treatment and were continuously infused into the abomasum of the cows. Milk production and MPY were not affected by treatment (mean 35.4 kg/d and 1.03 kg/d, respectively). Efficiency of nitrogen utilization was increased as dietary CP decreased but was not affected by EAA infusion (p < 0.01). Energy-corrected milk production was increased by EAA infusion into 13.2% CP, but not into 14.6% CP diet (p = 0.09), reaching the positive control value. Infusions increased mammary affinity for non-infused EAA (Ile, Phe, Thr, and Trp), allowing the same MPY despite lower arterial concentrations of these AA. Higher arterial concentrations of infused EAA did not increase their mammary uptake and MPY (p = 0.40; p = 0.85). Mammary metabolism did not fully explain changes in N efficiency, suggesting that it might be driven by less extramammary catabolism as AA supply was reduced."

      "abstract": "An experiment was conducted to evaluate effects of phytase and coccidial vaccine on growth performance, bone ash, bone 3-D microstructure, nutrient digestibility, and gene expression of intestinal biomarkers in broilers fed a regular or nutrient-reduced diet. The experiment was conducted in a 2 × 4 factorial arrangement with 6 replicates per treatment and 10 birds per replicate. Two main factors were coccidial vaccine and dietary treatments. The dietary treatments included: 1) a positive control (PC; normal nutrient levels); 2) a negative control (NC; with a reduction of 0.15% of Ca and avP and 5% of essential amino acid (EAA) and crude protein relative to PC); 3) NC + 500 FTU/kg of phytase; and 4) NC + 1,500 FTU/kg of phytase. No interaction effect of phytase and coccidial vaccine on growth performance, bone ash, and apparent ileal digestibility (AID) was observed. For the main effect, birds fed the NC diet showed lower (P = 0.007) BWG during d 0 to 21 compared to PC birds, whereas supplementing 500 or 1,500 FTU/kg phytase increased BWG to the similar level to the PC. During d 0 to 21, vaccinated birds had a lower (P < 0.001) FI and better (P = 0.045) FCR compared to unvaccinated birds. Birds fed the NC diet resulted a decrease in tibia fat-free dry bone weight (P = 0.012), ash weight (P = 0.005), ash percentage (P < 0.001), and ash concentration (P = 0.019) compared to the PC group at d 21, whereas supplementing phytase at 500 or 1,500 FTU/kg in NC diet was able to improve these bone parameters to the similar level to the PC; however, vaccination did not have any effect on bone ash. Similarly, birds fed with the NC diet showed had significant lower bone microstructure levels including bone volume, bone mineral density, and bone mineral content (P < 0.001), and supplementing phytase at 1,500 FTU/kg improved these parameters. Vaccination improved AID of nitrogen (P < 0.001). Birds from the NC and both phytase supplementation groups had a higher (P = 0.001) AID of Ca compared to the PC. Supplementing phytase at 500 FTU/kg or 1,500 FTU/kg improved (P < 0.001) AID of P compared to the NC. Additionally, the NC had a lower AID of DM than the PC, whereas supplementing phytase at 500 FTU/kg or 1,500 FTU/kg improved DM digestibility (P = 0.0299). In conclusion, supplementation of phytase at 500 or 1,500 FTU/kg improved growth performance, bone mineralization, and nutrient digestibility regardless of vaccination, with a more pronounced effect when supplementing phytase at 1,500 FTU/kg."

The effect of CRT on the nutritional value of EY was studied by amino acid and fatty acid analysis. The CRT significantly reduced the content of hexanal, 2-amyl-furan, 1-octene-3-ol, styrene and heptanal in EY1-EY4, also decreased its bitter taste without affecting other taste and elasticity. In addition, the CRT did not affect the essential amino acids (EAA) content and L*, a* and b* values of EY1-EY4, but it led to the reduction in polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) content. In general, the CRT is an effective way to reduce the off-odor of EY without affecting consumer acceptance.",

A total of 1,296 Lohmann laying hens have randomly distributed four groups with six parallels and fed with diets TR-fermented feed at the rates of 0 (control), 1, 3, and 5%. The inclusion of 1% (TR)-fermented feed resulted in a significant increase in egg-laying rate and average egg weight of birds, and a reduction in the feed-to-egg ratio when compared to the control group (p < 0.05). The addition of 1 and 3% of (TR)-fermented feed significantly improved the Haugh unit of eggs (p < 0.05). The eggshell thickness was observed to increase by almost one-fold upon the inclusion of 3 and 5% (TR)-fermented feed in the basal diet (p < 0.05). The supplementation of 3% (TR)-fermented feed significantly increased the content of methionine, tyrosine, proline, essential amino acids (EAA), alpha linoleic acid (C18:3n6), docosanoic acid (C22:0), docosahexaenoic acid (C22:6n3), twenty-three carbonic acids (C23:0), ditetradecenoic acid (C24:1) and total omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (∑ω-3 PUFA) in the eggs (p < 0.05). The addition of a certain amount of (TR)-fermented feed can enhance the activity of glutathione peroxidase (GSH-PX) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) in chicken serum, and reduce the level of malondialdehyde (MDA) (p < 0.05). The ammonia concentration in the hen house of laying hens in the treatment groups decreased significantly (p < 0.05). Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes, the main phyla in the cecal bacterial community, were differentially abundant in each group, comprising greater than 55 and 33%, respectively. Collectively, this research indicates that (TR)-fermented feed supplementation improves the performance of laying hens and reduces ammonia emissions and can be used in industry-scale layer production."

      "abstract": "Global meat consumption is increasing worldwide, however, supply remains lacking. Several alternative protein sources, such as cultured meat, plant-based protein production, and edible insects, have been proposed to overcome this shortage. Interestingly, edible insects are characterized by superior digestive and absorptive qualities that make them the ideal replacement for traditional protein production. This study aims to further the processing ability of insect protein by investigating the effects of various pre-treatment methods, such as blanching (HB), roasting (HR), and superheated steam (HS), on the nutritional properties and physicochemical characteristics of proteins extracted from Hermetia illucens larvae. The drying rate, pH value, color analysis, amino and fatty acid profile, as well as bulk density, shear force, and rehydration ratios of the above pre-treatment methods, were explored. HS was found to have the highest drying rate and pH value analysis showed that HB and HS samples have significantly higher values compared to the other modalities. Raw edible insects had the highest value in the sum of essential amino acid (EAA) and EAA index when compared to EAAs. HB and HS showed significantly lower bulk density results, and HS showed the highest shear force and the highest value in rehydration ratio, regardless of immersion time. Therefore, taking the above results together, it was found that blanching and superheated steam blanching pre-treatment were the most effective methods to improve the processing properties of H. illucens after hot-air drying."

A total of 324 mixed-sex 24-d weaned piglets (initial BW 6.9 ± 0.34 kg) were used in a 27-d growth trial with six dietary treatments immediately post-weaning. The first two treatments were a control standard CP (19%) diet (positive control; PC) and a negative control (NC) diet with low CP (16%) and reduced Ile, Leu, and histidine levels. The rest of the treatments had low CP with varied EAA types and levels; T1 had similar Ile, Leu, and His levels as PC but with low CP (16%), while T2 had low CP and 10% higher His, Thr, Trp, and Met+Cys compared to PC. The T3 was a low CP diet with 10% supplemental Leu, Ile, and Val compared to PC, while T4 was a low CP diet with 10% supplementation with all the EAA except Lys compared to PC. The initial body weight (BW) was not statistically different (P > 0.05) among the treatments. Also, on d 6, no statistical differences in BW were observed among the treatments. The average BW recorded on d 13, 20, and 27 showed significant treatment differences where the PC had consistently higher BW than all the other treatments (P < 0.05). The average daily gain (ADG) of the PC was higher than the rest of the treatments. Between d 13 and 20, the average daily feed intake (ADFI) for PC was not different from NC and T1 (P > 0.05), but compared to T2, T3, and T4, the PC treatment showed a high ADFI (P < 0.05). Overall (d 0-27), the ADFI for PC was not different from T1 and was significantly higher than all other treatments. Overall, results showed that the gain to feed (G:F) ratio was higher (P < 0.05) for PC compared to other dietary treatments. In summary, although the treatments (T1-T4) consisted of varying levels of EAA above the recommended requirement levels for optimal performance, we did not see a significant impact on growth performance improvement, which may indicate that the targeted EAA (His, Val, Thr, lle, Leu, Trp, and Met) may not have been limiting in these diets. On the other hand, the phenylalanine (Phe) requirement may be limited in the current formulations, or perhaps the EAA: total N ratio in T1, T2, T3, and T4 may have been too high, resulting in the inefficiency of EAA utilization for growth."

However, no study has been yet done on patients with anorexia nervosa (AN) who regain weight with specialized intensive treatment. The present study aims to evaluate the efficacy of supplementation with EAA on the change in lean body mass (LBM) and other physical and psychological outcomes in patients with AN who are undergoing specialist treatment for eating disorders. METHODS: This is a 13-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Patients will be randomized to either a mixture of a complex blend of EAA and intermediates of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle (citrate, malate, succinate) supplementation (or placebo) upon admission at the intensive residential and day-hospital treatment for eating disorders. Ninety-two participants with AN aged 16-50 years will be recruited from a specialized intensive treatment of eating disorders. Double-blind assessment will be conducted at baseline (T0) and the end of the 13 weeks of treatment (T1). The study's primary aim is to evaluate the efficacy of supplementation with EAA and TCA intermediates on the change in lean body mass (LBM) with weight restoration in patients with AN who are undergoing specialist treatment for eating disorders. The secondary aims of the study are to assess the effect of dietary supplementation on physical fitness, weight restoration, modification of AN and general psychopathology, and psychosocial impairment. DISCUSSION: The study's results will inform researchers and clinicians on whether supplementing a mixture of EAA and TCA cycle intermediates will improve the increase of LBM and other important physical and psychological outcomes in patients with AN who regain weight with specialized intensive treatment.

      "abstract": "Essential amino acids (EAAs) are crucial nutrients, whose levels change in rodents and patients with depression. However, how the levels of a single EAA affects depressive behaviors remains elusive. Here, we demonstrate that although deprivation of the EAA leucine has no effect in unstressed mice, it remarkably reverses the depression-like behaviors induced by chronic restraint stress (CRS). This beneficial effect is independent of feeding and is applicable to the dietary deficiency of other EAAs. Furthermore, the effect of leucine deprivation is suppressed by central injection of leucine or mimicked by central injection of leucinol. Moreover, hypothalamic agouti-related peptide (AgRP) neural activity changes during CRS and leucine deprivation, and chemogenetically inhibiting AgRP neurons eliminates the antidepressant effects of leucine deprivation. Finally, the leucine deprivation-regulated behavioral effects are mediated by amino acid sensor general control non-derepressible 2 (GCN2) in AgRP neurons. Taken together, our results suggest a new drug target and/or dietary intervention for the reduction of depressive symptoms."

      "abstract": "Lowering the dietary protein content can reduce N excretions and NH3 emissions from manure and increase milk N efficiency of dairy cows. However, milk yield (MY) and composition can be compromised due to AA deficiency. Methionine and Lys are known as first limiting EAA for dairy cows, and recently His is also mentioned as limiting, especially in grass-based or low-protein diets. To examine this, a trial was conducted with a 3-wk pre-experimental adaptation period (diet 16.5% crude protein), followed by a depletion period of 4 wk, in which 39 cows (average ± standard deviation: 116 ± 29.3 d in milk, 1.8 ± 1.2 lactations, 638 ± 73.2 kg of body weight, and 32.7 ± 5.75 kg MY/d) received a low-protein diet (CTRL) (14.5% crude protein). Then, taking into account parity, His plasma concentration, and MY, cows were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 treatment groups during the rumen-protected (RP) AA period of 7 wk; (1) CTRL; (2) CTRL + RP-Met + RP-Lys (MetLys); (3) CTRL + RP-Met + RP-Lys + RP-His (MetLysHis). Products were dosed, assuming requirements for digestible (d) Met, dLys, and dHis being, respectively, 2.4%, 7.0%, and 2.4% of intestinal digestible protein. In the cross-back period of 5 wk, all cows received the CTRL diet. During the last week of each period, a N balance was conducted by collecting total urine and spot samples of feces. Total feces production was calculated using the inert marker TiO2. Statistical analysis was performed with a linear mixed model with cow as random effect and data of the last week of the pre-experimental period used as covariate for the animal performance variables. No effect of supplementing RP-Met and RP-Lys nor RP-Met, RP-Lys, and RP-His on feed intake, milk performance, or milk N efficiency was observed. However, the plasma AA profile indicated additional supply of dMet, dLys, and dHis. Nevertheless, evaluation of the AA uptake relative to the cow's requirements showed that most EAA (exclusive Arg and Thr) were limiting over the whole experiment. Only dHis was sufficiently supplemented during the RP-AA period due to an overestimation of the diet's dMet and dLys supply in the beginning of the trial. The numerically increased milk urea N and urinary N excretion when RP-Met, RP-Lys, and RP-His were added to the low-protein diet suggest an increased catabolism of the excess His.",

Our primary patient is a female monozygotic twin who presented to medical care at 10 months of age with acute liver failure, gastrointestinal symptoms, altered mental status, hypoglycemia, and hyperammonemia. The patient's older brother, known to have hemizygous OTC deficiency, died at 8 months of age from cardiac arrest after complications secondary to his diagnosis. Despite her family history, manifestation of symptoms of heterozygous (partial) OTC deficiency went unrecognized by multiple providers based on misconceptions regarding a female's risk for X-linked disease. Despite barriers related to the family's low socioeconomic status, follow-up care by a multidisciplinary metabolic care team, including moderate protein restriction and nitrogen scavenger therapy, led to positive outcomes for the patient. Her twin sister and mother are also heterozygous for variants in OTC and remain controlled on moderate protein restriction. This case illustrates the importance of genotyping all individuals with genetic risk factors for OTC deficiency and the variability in disease manifestation that necessitates tailored treatment approaches for individuals with partial OTC deficiency."

      "abstract": "We report on pregnancy management and outcomes in a 27-year-old female patient with ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC) deficiency, the most common inherited enzyme deficiency in the urea cycle. Our patient was diagnosed during childhood after hyperammonemia associated with surgery and steroid treatment and was well-controlled with nitrogen scavenger treatment, low-protein diet, and L-citrulline supplementation. OTC gene sequencing identified a variant of unknown significance that has more recently been classified as likely pathogenic. Women with OTC deficiency are at increased risk of hyperammonemia during pregnancy and the postpartum period, therefore monthly follow up and laboratory assessments are critical in management decision making. Our patient was maintained on glycerol phenylbutyrate, L-citrulline and essential amino acid supplements, along with restricted protein intake during pregnancy. A multidisciplinary approach with the obstetrics, prenatal genetics, high risk obstetric, and anesthesia teams was also necessary for optimal management during pregnancy, throughout labor and delivery, and during the postpartum period. After successful childbirth and discharge, our patient experienced a hyperammonemic crisis related to poor enteral nutrition, and acute management protocols were implemented to stabilize her. For her newborn son, acute hyperammonemia protocols were on standby, and newborn screening and laboratory testing were expedited to assess his risk. He was healthy and did not experience symptoms of concern. In this case report, we emphasize the importance of close collaboration with maternal-fetal medicine team members during and immediately after pregnancy to ensure successful management of a female patient with OTC deficiency and her newborn."

US treatment of co-product in water at 60% amplitude for 20 min, followed by heating at 95 °C for 3 h was done before enzymatic hydrolysis. The degree of hydrolysis (DH), yield and sialic acid (SL) content of P-HS samples were not different (p > 0.05) when 1 or 2% alcalase was used for hydrolysis. The highest protein content and lightness (L * ) were observed in P-HS prepared from co-product subjected to US treatment (60% amplitude for 20 min) using 1% alcalase for hydrolysis. When antioxidant activities of dried P-HS were determined, P-HS from co-product subjected to US treatment had higher DPPH and ABTS radical scavenging activities, ferrous reducing antioxidant power and oxygen radical absorbance capacity, compared to those prepared from non-US treated co-product. P-HS with higher DH contained greater amount of small peptides having MW lower than 1,883 Da. The P-HS produced under optimum condition had major essential amino acids (EA-A) including leucine, threonine, lysine and valine of 4.28, 3.53, 3.30 and 3.08%, respectively. Therefore, P-HS from co-product could serve as both nutrients and functional ingredients.

In the present study, we hypothesized that the beneficial effects will be synergized by adding resistance exercise training (RET) to EAA, and diet-free EAA would improve endurance. To test hypotheses, mice were randomized into the following four groups: control, EAA, RET, and EAA+RET. All mice except the control were subjected to DEX treatment. We evaluated the cumulative rate of myofibrillar protein synthesis (MPS) using 2H2O labeling and mass spectrometry. Neuromuscular junction (NMJ) stability, mitochondrial contents, and molecular signaling were demonstrated in skeletal muscle. Insulin sensitivity and glucose metabolism using 13C6-glucose tracing during oral glucose tolerance tests were analyzed. We found that EAA and RET synergistically improve muscle mass and/or strength, and endurance capacity, as well as insulin sensitivity, and glucose metabolism in DEX-treated muscle. These improvements are accomplished, in part, through improvements in myofibrillar protein synthesis, NMJ, fiber type preservation, and/or mitochondrial biogenesis. In conclusion, free EAA supplementation, particularly when combined with RET, can serve as an effective means that counteracts the adverse effects on muscle of DEX that are found frequently in clinical settings.",

Horses were individually housed and fed timothy grass hay and 2 daily concentrate meals so that protein was the first limiting nutrient and the total diet provided 120% of daily DE requirements for maintenance. On sample days, horses randomly received 0.25 g CP/kg BW of a pelleted alfalfa (AP) or commercial protein supplement (PS). Blood samples were collected before and 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, 180, 210, 240, 300, 360, 420, and 480 min post feeding and analyzed for plasma glucose, insulin and amino acid (AA) concentrations. Gluteus Medius muscle samples were obtained before and 90, 180, and 300 min after feeding and analyzed for relative abundance of phosphorylated mTOR pathway components using western immunoblot analysis. There was no effect of protein source on postprandial glucose and insulin responses (P ≥ 0.14) but consumption of PS elicited a 2 times larger AUC for essential AA (EAA), greater peak concentrations of EAA and a shorter time to reach peak EAA concentrations compared to AP. Abundance of phosphorylated mTOR (P = 0.08) and rpS6 (P = 0.10) tended to be ~1.5-fold greater after consumption of PS at 90 min compared to AP. Dephosphorylation patterns differed between protein sources and was slower for AP compared to PS. ID horses had a 2 times greater (P = 0.009) AUC and 3 times higher postprandial peak concentrations (P < 0.0001) for insulin compared to non-ID horses after consumption of both treatment pellets, but EAA responses were similar between groups (P = 0.53). Insulin status did not affect rpS6 or mTOR phosphorylation after consumption of either protein source (P ≥ 0.35), but phosphorylated rpS6 abundance was twice as high in ID compared to non-ID horses (P = 0.007). These results suggest that the consumption of higher quality protein sources may result in greater postprandial activation of the mTOR pathway compared to equal amounts of a forage-based protein source. Moreover, ID does not impair postprandial activation of mTOR and rpS6 proteins in horses following a protein-rich meal."

      "abstract": "This study investigated mammary gland metabolism and whole-body (WB) rate of appearance (Ra) of glucose in dairy cattle in response to a constant supplemental level of metabolizable protein (MP) composed of different essential AA (EAA) profiles. Five multiparous rumen-fistulated Holstein-Friesian dairy cows (2.8 ± 0.4 lactations; 81 ± 11 d in milk; mean ± standard deviation) were abomasally infused according to a 5 × 5 Latin square design with saline (SAL) or 562 g/d of EAA delivered in different profiles where individual AA content corresponded to their relative content in casein. The profiles consisted of (1) a complete EAA mixture (EAAC), (2) Ile, Leu, and Val (ILV), (3) His, Ile, Leu, Met, Phe, Trp, Val (GR1+ILV), and (4) Arg, His, Lys, Met, Phe, Thr, Trp (GR1+ALT). A total mixed ration (58% corn silage, 16% alfalfa hay, and 26% concentrate on a dry matter basis) was formulated to meet 100 and 83% of net energy and MP requirements, respectively, and was fed at 90% of ad libitum intake on an individual cow basis. Each experimental period consisted of 5 d of continuous abomasal infusion followed by 2 d of no infusion. Arterial and venous blood samples were collected on d 4 of each period for determination of mammary gland AA and glucose metabolism. On d 5 of each period, D-[U-13C]glucose (13 mmol priming dose; continuous 3.5 mmol/h for 520 min) was infused into a jugular vein and arterial blood samples were collected before and during infusion to determine WB Ra of glucose. Milk protein yield did not differ between EAAC, GR1+ILV, and GR1+ALT, or between SAL and ILV, and increased over SAL and ILV with EAAC and GR1+ILV. Mammary plasma flow increased with ILV infusion compared with EAAC and GR1+ILV. Infusion of EAAC tended to increase mammary gland net uptake of total EAA and decreased the mammary uptake to milk protein output ratio (U:O) of non-EAA compared with SAL. Infusion of ILV increased mammary net uptake and U:O of Ile, Leu, and Val markedly over all treatments. The U:O of total Ile, Leu, and Val increased numerically (25%) with GR1+ILV infusion compared with EAAC, and the U:O of total Arg, Lys, and Thr tended to decrease, primarily from decreased U:O of Lys. During GR1+ALT infusion, U:O of total Arg, Lys, and Thr was greater than that during EAAC infusion, whereas U:O of Ile, Leu, and Val did not differ from EAAC. Glucose WB Ra increased 16% with GR1+ALT over SAL, and increased numerically 8 and 12% over SAL with EAAC and GR1+ILV, respectively. The average proportion of lactose yield relative to glucose WB Ra did not differ across treatments and averaged 0.53. On average, 28% of milk galactose arose from nonglucose precursors, regardless of treatment. In conclusion, intramammary catabolism of group 2 AA increased to support milk component synthesis when the EAA profile of MP was incomplete with respect to casein. Further, WB and mammary gland glucose metabolism was flexible in support of milk component synthesis, regardless of absorptive EAA profile.",

We cultured MECs with 0%, 2% (depletion), and 100% (control) EAA for two exposure times (8 and 24 h), followed by three refeeding (RF) times with 100% EAA (0, 8, and 24 h). Subsequently, we measured cell viability, total protein concentration, and proliferation. Western blotting was used to quantify the levels of casein and the expression of total GCN2 and eIF2, as well as phosphorylated GCN2 (GCN2P) and eIF2 (eIF2P). The ISOQuant method was used to assess MEC proteomes, and the resultant data were analyzed using the Kruskal−Wallis test, nonpaired Wilcoxon rank post-hoc test, and ANOVA−Tukey test, as well as principal component analyses and multiple regressions models. Differences in cell viability were observed between the control versus the depleted and repleted MECs, respectively, where 97.2−99.8% viability indicated low cell death rates. Proliferation (range, 1.02−1.55 arbitrary units (AU)) was affected by starvation for 12 and 24 h and repletion for 24 h, but it was not increased compared with the control. Total protein expression was unaffected by both depletion and repletion treatments (median 3158 µg/mL). eIF2P expression was significantly increased (p < 0.05) after treatment with 2% EAA for 8 and 24 h compared with 2% EAA with 8 h + 24 h RF and 2% EAA with 24 h + 8 h RF. GCN2P also showed significantly increased expression (p < 0.05) after treatment with 2% EAA for 24 h compared with the control and 2% EAA with 24 h + 8 h RF. Intracellular casein/α-tubulin expression was unaffected by 2% EAA compared with control (0.073 ± 0.01 AU versus 0.086 ± 0.02 AU, respectively). We studied 30 of the detected 1180 proteins, 16 of which were differentially expressed in starved and refed MECs. Cells faced with EAA deficiency activated the GCN2P/eIF2P pathway, and the lack of change in the levels of casein and other milk proteins suggested that the EAA deficit was mitigated by metabolic flexibility to maintain homeostasis."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND & AIMS: Protein kinetic responses to nutrition and exercise interventions are commonly evaluated using a primed-constant infusion of stable isotope tracers. While this methodology is state-of-the-art, the required preparation at a certified pharmacy makes the utilization of isotope infusion both expensive and logistically cumbersome. Oral tracer ingestion has been used to quantify 24-h whole-body protein status; however, this does not permit examination of acute interventional effects. Ingestion of a priming bolus, followed by continuous ingestion of stable isotope tracer in a 'sip feeding' fashion may provide a more feasible alternative for quantifying acute kinetic responses. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to evaluate the viability of a primed continuous oral sip-ingestion method of stable isotope tracers for the evaluation of whole-body protein kinetics. METHODS: In a randomized, crossover design, eight healthy adults (63% female; Age: 29.4 ± 5.8 yrs; BMI: 24.3 ± 2.7 kg/m2) completed two, two-period stable isotope oral ingestion studies, consisting of a 3 h basal fasted period, followed by a 4-h post-ingestion period. After the basal period, subjects ingested either 6.3 g (Low) or 12.6 g (High) of an essential amino acid (EAA) enriched whey protein supplement. The continuous oral sip-feed method was initiated with a primed oral bolus dose of L-[ring-2H5]phenylalanine, L-[ring-2H2]tyrosine, and L-[ring-2H4]tyrosine, followed by oral sip doses of L-[ring-2H5]phenylalanine, L-[ring-2H2]tyrosine every 10 min to approximate steady state tracer enrichment. Blood samples were taken throughout the basal and post-meal periods to determine tracer enrichment. Whole-body net protein balance (NB), synthesis (PS), breakdown (PB), and exogenous hydroxylation were calculated for each period. Repeated measure ANOVAs (treatment × time) were used to assess differences in protein kinetics. RESULTS: Using the sip feed method, NB, PS, and hydroxylation were significantly increased with ingestion of protein (p < 0.05) during the postprandial period, regardless of amount of protein ingested; ΔNB from the postabsorptive to postprandial period was significantly greater for high compared to low protein (p = 0.026; low = 6.2 ± 5.1 g protein·240 min-1; high = 11.8 ± 3.9 g protein·240 min-1). CONCLUSION: The current study provides preliminary evidence that continuous oral sip-feeding of stable isotope tracer is a feasible method that provides physiologically relevant measures of protein metabolism. Assessments of variance and individual responses revealed high measurement variability with the sip-feed method compared to previously published constant infusion responses, but ΔNB, ΔPS, and ΔPB were comparable. In situations where constant infusion is not feasible, oral sip-feeding could be used as an alternative method for measurement of acute, postprandial protein metabolism.",

      "abstract": "UNLABELLED: Tea catechins (TCCs) have gained significant attention owing to their health effects. However, evidence is limited regarding the benefit of TCC and essential amino acids (EAAs) ingestion plus that of TCC ingestion after resistance exercise (RE) among older individuals with sarcopenia. We aimed to evaluate whether a 24-week nutritional program involving EAA and TCC supplementation after RE improved skeletal muscle mass (SMM) among older adults with sarcopenia. METHODS: We conducted an open-label, pilot, randomized controlled trial among older adults with sarcopenia at the Harima Care Center or community in Hyogo, Japan. Participants were allocated to RE (n = 18), RE with EAA supplementation (RE + EAA, n = 18), or RE with EAA and TCC supplementation (RE + EAA + TCC, n = 18) groups. Sarcopenia was defined using the Asian Working Group for Sarcopenia 2019 criteria. A 24-week resistance exercise program was carried out twice weekly, with an intake of 3,000 mg and 540 mg of EAA and TCC supplements, respectively. SMM was the primary outcome parameter. UNLABELLED: The mean adherence rate to exercise and supplementation intake over the 24-week intervention period was 86.8% in the RE + EAA + TCC group, 86.4% in the RE + EAA group, and 85.4% in the RE group. A significant group-by-time interaction was identified for SMM (p = 0.010). The pre- to post-intervention increase in SMM was significantly higher in the RE + EAA + TCC group than in the RE group (p = 0.010). UNLABELLED: These results suggest that supplementation with EAA and TCC after RE, compared to RE only, improves SMM in older people with sarcopenia. To the best of our knowledge, our study is the first pilot randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effect of TCC supplementation on SMM in older people with sarcopenia.

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Profound metabolic alterations characterize cancer development and, beyond glucose addiction, amino acid (AA) dependency is now recognized as a hallmark of tumour growth. Therefore, targeting the metabolic addiction of tumours by reprogramming their substrate utilization is an attractive therapeutic strategy. We hypothesized that a dietary approach targeted to stimulate oxidative metabolism could reverse the metabolic inflexibility of tumours and represent a proper adjuvant therapy. METHODS: We measured tumour development in xenografted mice fed with a designer, casein-deprived diet enriched in free essential amino acids (EAAs; SFA-EAA diet), or two control isocaloric, isolipidic, and isonitrogenous diets, identical to the SFA-EAA diet except for casein presence (SFA diet), or casein replacement by the free AA mixture designed on the AA profile of casein (SFA-CAA diet). Moreover, we investigated the metabolic, biochemical, and molecular effects of two mixtures that reproduce the AA composition of the SFA-EAA diet (i.e., EAAm) and SFA-CAA diet (i.e., CAAm) in diverse cancer and non-cancer cells. RESULTS: The SFA-EAA diet reduced tumour growth in vivo, promoted endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, and inhibited mechanistic/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) activity in the tumours. Accordingly, in culture, the EAAm, but not the CAAm, activated apoptotic cell death in cancer cells without affecting the survival and proliferation of non-cancer cells. The EAAm increased branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) oxidation and decreased glycolysis, ATP levels, redox potential, and intracellular content of selective non-essential amino acids (NEAA) in cancer cells. The EAAm-induced NEAA starvation activated the GCN2-ATF4 stress pathway, leading to ER stress, mTOR inactivation, and apoptosis in cancer cells, unlike non-cancer cells. CONCLUSION: Together, these results confirm the efficacy of specific EAA mixtures in promoting cancer cells' death and suggest that manipulation of dietary EAA content and profile could be a valuable support to the standard chemotherapy for specific cancers.",

      "abstract": "Postpartum cows experience a nadir in energy and AA deficit early postpartum. At the same time, cows are challenged with inflammatory stimuli and often show heightened immune responsiveness, further increasing their metabolic needs during this critical time. This study investigated the response to a systemic inflammatory stimulus after a 4-d intravenous (IV) AA infusion designed to ameliorate the estimated metabolizable protein (MP) deficit in postpartum cows. Our objectives were to (1) describe the production and metabolic responses to early postpartum IV AA infusion, (2) determine the metabolic and hormonal responses to an acute IV lipopolysaccharide (LPS) challenge in early postpartum cows, and (3) compare these metabolic and hormonal responses between IV AA treated and control cows. Cows (n = 14, 4 ± 1 d in milk) were continuously IV infused for 4 d in a matched-pair randomized controlled design and received IV AA (IVAA) or 0.9% NaCl (CTRL). Treatment with IV AA consisted of 1 g/kg of BW per day of combined essential AA (EAA) and nonessential AA (NEAA). After infusion ended, cows were challenged IV with LPS (0.0625 µg/kg of BW over 1 h), and serial blood samples were collected to quantify AA, metabolite, and hormone concentrations. Amino acid infusion increased plasma EAA and NEAA concentrations and ameliorated the estimated MP deficit but not the metabolizable energy deficit in IVAA cows. Patterns of dry matter intake during infusion were different between groups. Milk yield and milk protein content and yield were unaffected, but IV AA was associated with increased milk fat content and yield of both de novo and preformed fatty acids. Before LPS infusion, plasma EAA and NEAA concentrations were greater in IVAA compared with CTRL. During LPS challenge, plasma AA concentrations decreased to a greater degree in IVAA than CTRL. Glucagon concentrations were greater and glucose concentrations lower in IVAA during challenge; however, previous AA infusion did not affect the time-dependent changes in concentrations of energy metabolites or glucoregulatory hormones. Plasma urea nitrogen concentration increased in both treatments following challenge, although the temporal pattern depended on treatment. Effects of AA infusion on milk fat response were pronounced and likely due to a combination of increased lipolysis and de novo milk fat synthesis. Despite differences in circulating concentrations of nutrients and hormones before challenge, metabolic responses to systemic inflammation did not differ between the 2 treatments. We conclude that AA infusion changed metabolic status and milk fat but did not appear to alter the metabolic response to subsequent systemic inflammation.",

      "abstract": "Cell swelling usually initiates the regulatory volume decrease (RVD) process mediated mainly by volume-regulated anion channels (VRACs), which are formed by multiple different leucine-rich repeat-containing protein 8 (LRRC8) family members. VRAC currents have been widely recorded in astrocytes, neurons and microglia in the brain, and VRACs have been suggested to be involved in the important pathogenesis of cell swelling-related central nervous system (CNS) diseases, such as ischemic stroke, epilepsy and epileptogenesis, glioblastoma (GBM), and so on. Recently, the increasing studies started to focus on LRRC8A (SWELL1), an obligatory subunit of VRAC indentified in 2014, which may be the key target to regulate the VRAC functions. After cerebral ischemia, the swollen astrocytes, neurons and microglia can activate LRRC8A-dependent VRACs, which may respectively promote the release of excitatory amino acids (EAA), interaction with ionotropic glutamate receptors, and regulating inflammation, suggesting the pleiotropic roles of LRRC8A in swollen brain cells. For the treatment of cell swelling-related CNS diseases, specific targeting LRRC8A may be a superior strategy to inhibit swollen-induced VRAC hyperactivity without blocking the normal VRAC function.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Management of phenylketonuria (PKU) is mainly achieved through dietary control with limited intake of phenylalanine (Phe) from food, supplemented with low protein (LP) food and a mixture of free synthetic (FS) amino acids (AA) (FSAA). Casein glycomacropeptide (CGMP) is a natural peptide released in whey during cheese making by the action of the enzyme chymosin. Because CGMP in its pure form does not contain Phe, it is nutritionally suitable as a supplement in the diet for PKU when enriched with specific AAs. Lacprodan® CGMP-20 (= CGMP) used in this study contained only trace amounts of Phe due to minor presence of other proteins/peptides. OBJECTIVE: The aims were to address the following questions in a classical PKU mouse model: Study 1, off diet: Can pure CGMP or CGMP supplemented with Large Neutral Amino Acids (LNAA) as a supplement to normal diet significantly lower the content of Phe in the brain compared to a control group on normal diet, and does supplementation of selected LNAA results in significant lower brain Phe level?. Study 2, on diet: Does a combination of CGMP, essential (non-Phe) EAAs and LP diet, provide similar plasma and brain Phe levels, growth and behavioral skills as a formula which alone consist of FSAA, with a similar composition?. MATERIAL AND METHODS: 45 female mice homozygous for the Pahenu2 mutation were treated for 12 weeks in five different groups; G1(N-CGMP), fed on Normal (N) casein diet (75%) in combination with CGMP (25%); G2 (N-CGMP-LNAA), fed on Normal (N) casein diet (75%) in combination with CGMP (19,7%) and selected LNAA (5,3% Leu, Tyr and Trp); G3 (N), fed on normal casein diet (100%); G4 (CGMP-EAA-LP), fed on CGMP (70,4%) in combination with essential AA (19,6%) and LP diet; G5 (FSAA-LP), fed on FSAA (100%) and LP diet. The following parameters were measured during the treatment period: Plasma AA profiles including Phe and Tyr, growth, food and water intake and number of teeth cut. At the end of the treatment period, a body scan (fat and lean body mass) and a behavioral test (Barnes Maze) were performed. Finally, the brains were examined for content of Phe, Tyr, Trp, dopamine (DA), 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC), serotonin (5-HT) and 5-hydroxyindole-acetic acid (5-HIAA), and the bone density and bone mineral content were determined by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. RESULTS: Study 1: Mice off diet supplemented with CGMP (G1 (N-CGMP)) or supplemented with CGMP in combination with LNAA (G2 (N-CGMP-LNAA)) had significantly lower Phe in plasma and in the brain compared to mice fed only casein (G3 (N)). Extra LNAA (Tyr, Trp and Leu) to CGMP did not have any significant impact on Phe levels in the plasma and brain, but an increase in serotonin was measured in the brain of G2 mice compared to G1. Study 2: PKU mice fed with mixture of CGMP and EAA as supplement to LP diet (G4 (CGMP-EAA-LP)) demonstrated lower plasma-Phe levels but similar brain- Phe levels and growth as mice fed on an almost identical combination of FSAA (G5 (FSAA-LP)). CONCLUSION: CGMP can be a relevant supplement for the treatment of PKU.",

Four different percentages of dietary leaf extract powder of Aleo vera (ALE) with a basal feed, designated as, i.e., T0 (Control group; without ALE), T1 (1% ALE), T2 (2% ALE), and T3 (3% ALE). Fish fry was reared in concrete tanks (7.0 m, 1.6 m, 1.0: L, W, H; water volume 11.2 m3/tank), with an average initial weight 4.04 ± 0.03 g/ fry, and each treatment was triplicated. Fry was randomly distributed at a stocking rate of 450 individuals/ tanks. The water quality parameters revealed that temperature, pH, salinity, dissolved oxygen (DO) and nitrates were found in a promising range as given by FAO/WHO limits. However, the record values obtained for Electric Conductivity (EC), Total dissolved solids (TDS), and alkalinities were not found in all tanks' suitable range according to FAO/WHO limits. The results revealed a significant impact of different percentages of dietary ALE supplementation on fry's body composition and haematological parameters. Moreover, the final body weight, final body length, average daily weight gain (g), net weight gain (g) and specific growth rate (%) were significantly higher (p < 0.05) in T1 and T2 compared with T0 and T3 treatments. The poorest feed conversion ratio was recorded in the T2 group compared with other treatments. Thus, the current study provides information about the nutritional quality of Nile tilapia culturing in Pakistan."

Ten dogs with CKD stages 3 or 4 composed the study group and received the renal diet for 180 days (RG T180). A control group (CG T30) composed of seven healthy dogs was fed a renal diet for 30 days. When comparing serum AA between RG T180 and CG T30, histidine, isoleucine, leucine, lysine, phenylalanine, tryptophan, cysteine, citrulline, ornithine, taurine, branched-chain amino acids (BCAA), and total essential amino acids (EAA) were higher in RG T180. Meanwhile, arginine, asparagine, aspartate, glutamine, serine, and tyrosine were higher in CG T30. Serum phenylalanine, tryptophan, and hydroxyproline were higher in RG T0 (dogs with CKD before consuming a renal diet) when compared to RG T180. In addition, the serum ratios of arginine/citrulline, tyrosine/phenylalanine, and serine/glycine were higher in CG T30 than in RG T180. Concerning urinary AA concentrations in CKD dogs, isoleucine, phenylalanine, tryptophan, aspartate, cysteine, and BCAA were higher in RG T180. In urine, the total EAA/total non-essential AA ratio in RG T180 was higher than in CG T30 as well as tyrosine/phenylalanine ratio higher in CG T30. In conclusion, the combination of renal diet and conservative treatment over 6 months in dogs with CKD stages 3 or 4 affected the AAs metabolism when compared to healthy adult dogs."

      "abstract": "Muscle protein synthesis and proteolysis are tightly coupled processes. Given that muscle growth is promoted by increases in net protein balance, it stands to reason that bolstering protein synthesis through amino acids while reducing or inhibiting proteolysis could be a synergistic strategy in enhancing anabolism. However, there is contradictory evidence suggesting that the proper functioning of proteolytic systems in muscle is required for homeostasis. To add clarity to this issue, we sought to determine if inhibiting different proteolytic systems in C2C12 myotubes in conjunction with acute and chronic leucine treatments affected markers of anabolism. In Experiment 1, myotubes underwent 1-h, 6-h, and 24-h treatments with serum and leucine-free DMEM containing the following compounds (n = 6 wells per treatment): (i) DMSO vehicle (CTL), (ii) 2 mM leucine + vehicle (Leu-only), (iii) 2 mM leucine + 40 μM MG132 (20S proteasome inhibitor) (Leu + MG132), (iv) 2 mM leucine + 50 μM calpeptin (calpain inhibitor) (Leu + CALP), and (v) 2 mM leucine + 1 μM 3-methyladenine (autophagy inhibitor) (Leu + 3MA). Protein synthesis levels significantly increased (p < 0.05) in the Leu-only and Leu + 3MA 6-h treatments compared to CTL, and levels were significantly lower in Leu + MG132 and Leu + CALP versus Leu-only and CTL. With 24-h treatments, total protein yield was significantly lower in Leu + MG132 cells versus other treatments. Additionally, the intracellular essential amino acid (EAA) pool was significantly greater in 24-h Leu + MG132 treatments versus other treatments. In a follow-up experiment, myotubes were treated for 48 h with CTL, Leu-only, and Leu + MG132 for morphological assessments. Results indicated Leu + MG132 yielded significantly smaller myotubes compared to CTL and Leu-only. Our data are limited in scope due to the utilization of select proteolysis inhibitors. However, this is the first evidence to suggest proteasome and calpain inhibition with MG132 and CALP, respectively, abrogate leucine-induced protein synthesis in myotubes. Additionally, longer-term Leu + MG132 treatments translated to an atrophy phenotype. Whether or not proteasome inhibition in vivo reduces leucine- or EAA-induced anabolism remains to be determined."

The Ca+2 and K+1 were presented in high values, followed by Na+1 and Mg+2. In addition, the drying techniques showed and released more volatile compounds in the processed samples compared with the unprocessed samples. Under the drying process, polyunsaturated fatty acids were increased in the processed fillets, whereas the level of saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids reduced. Thermal degradation occurred from 100 to 150 °C. However, the processed samples were subjected to an intensive endothermic response, but remained stable until 100 °C. Therefore, the microwave technique showed some enhancements in the nutritional value and has the potential to be applied as an effective preservation method of bighead carp fish. Furthermore, dried fillets could be an alternative source of bighead carp fish for the food industry."

      "abstract": "This study was conducted to evaluate the effects of tea powder in diets on the growth performance, meat quality, muscular amino acid, fatty acid profile, and serum biochemical indices of pigs. A total of 120 local Chinese pigs (Tibetan × Bama miniature pigs) were randomly assigned to five treatment groups, each with six pens and four pigs per pen. During a 60-day experiment, these groups of pigs were fed the normal diet and the diet supplemented with 1%, 2%, 4%, and 6% tea powder, respectively. The results showed that the supplementation of tea powder did not affect the growth performance of pigs. However, the dietary tea powder inclusion decreased (p < 0.05) the average fat thickness, total fat, and abdominal fat, and increased (p < 0.05) the total muscle as well. In addition, the dietary 2% tea powder decreased (p < 0.05) the muscle lightness (L*) and yellowness (b*). Compared with the control group, the dietary supplementation with 1%, 2%, and 4% tea powder raised (p < 0.05) the total amino acids (TAA) and essential amino acids (EAA), and dietary 4% and 6% tea powder increased (p < 0.05) the C20:5n3 in the muscle tissue. Furthermore, the serum lipid metabolism-related biochemical indices and mRNA expression levels were improved with the addition of tea powder. These results indicated that dietary tea powder might improve the carcass traits and meat quality of the Chinese native finishing pigs, but it does not affect their growth performance. Tea powder could be fully developed and reasonably applied as a dietary supplement."

      "abstract": "Nutritional symbionts are restricted to specialized host cells called bacteriocytes in various insect orders. These symbionts can provide essential nutrients to the host. However, the cellular mechanisms underlying the regulation of these insect-symbiont metabolic associations remain largely unclear. The whitefly Bemisia tabaci MEAM1 hosts \"Candidatus Portiera aleyrodidarum\" (here, \"Ca. Portiera\") and \"Candidatus Hamiltonella defensa\" (here, \"Ca. Hamiltonella\") bacteria in the same bacteriocyte. In this study, the induction of autophagy by chemical treatment and gene silencing decreased symbiont titers and essential amino acid (EAA) and B vitamin contents. In contrast, the repression of autophagy in bacteriocytes via Atg8 silencing increased symbiont titers, and amino acid and B vitamin contents. Furthermore, dietary supplementation with non-EAAs or B vitamins alleviated autophagy in whitefly bacteriocytes, elevated TOR (target of rapamycin) expression, and increased symbiont titers. TOR silencing restored symbiont titers in whiteflies after dietary supplementation with B vitamins. These data suggest that \"Ca. Portiera\" and \"Ca. Hamiltonella\" evade autophagy of the whitefly bacteriocytes by activating the TOR pathway via providing essential nutrients. Taken together, we demonstrate that autophagy plays a critical role in regulating the metabolic interactions between the whitefly and two intracellular symbionts. Therefore, this study reveals that autophagy is an important cellular basis for bacteriocyte evolution and symbiosis persistence in whiteflies. The whitefly symbiosis unravels the interactions between cellular and metabolic functions of bacteriocytes. IMPORTANCE Nutritional symbionts, which are restricted to specialized host cells called bacteriocytes, can provide essential nutrients for many hosts. However, the cellular mechanisms of regulation of animal-symbiont metabolic associations have been largely unexplored. Here, using the whitefly-\"Ca. Portiera\"/\"Ca. Hamiltonella\" endosymbiosis, we demonstrate autophagy regulates the symbiont titers and thereby alters the essential amino acid and B vitamin contents. For persistence in the whitefly bacteriocytes, \"Ca. Portiera\" and \"Ca. Hamiltonella\" alleviate autophagy by activating the TOR (target of rapamycin) pathway through providing essential nutrients. Therefore, we demonstrate that autophagy plays a critical role in regulating the metabolic interactions between the whitefly and two intracellular symbionts. This study also provides insight into the cellular basis of bacteriocyte evolution and symbiosis persistence in the whitefly. The mechanisms underlying the role of autophagy in whitefly symbiosis could be widespread in many insect nutritional symbioses. These findings provide a new avenue for whitefly control via regulating autophagy in the future.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Obesity develops due to an imbalance in energy homeostasis, wherein energy intake exceeds energy expenditure. Accumulating evidence shows that manipulations of dietary protein and their component amino acids affect the energy balance, resulting in changes in fat mass and body weight. Amino acids are not only the building blocks of proteins but also serve as signals regulating multiple biological pathways. SCOPE OF REVIEW: We present the currently available evidence regarding the effects of dietary alterations of a single essential amino acid (EAA) on energy balance and relevant signaling mechanisms at both central and peripheral levels. We summarize the association between EAAs and obesity in humans and the clinical use of modifying the dietary EAA composition for therapeutic intervention in obesity. Finally, similar mechanisms underlying diets varying in protein levels and diets altered of a single EAA are described. The current review would expand our understanding of the contribution of protein and amino acids to energy balance control, thus helping discover novel therapeutic approaches for obesity and related diseases. MAJOR CONCLUSIONS: Changes in circulating EAA levels, particularly increased branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs), have been reported in obese human and animal models. Alterations in dietary EAA intake result in improvements in fat and weight loss in rodents, and each has its distinct mechanism. For example, leucine deprivation increases energy expenditure, reduces food intake and fat mass, primarily through regulation of the general control nonderepressible 2 (GCN2) and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling. Methionine restriction by 80% decreases fat mass and body weight while developing hyperphagia, primarily through fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF-21) signaling. Some effects of diets with different protein levels on energy homeostasis are mediated by similar mechanisms. However, reports on the effects and underlying mechanisms of dietary EAA imbalances on human body weight are few, and more investigations are needed in future.",

      "abstract": "Stunting is reportedly associated with low circulating levels of essential amino acids (EAAs). This study examined the effect of a macronutrient- and micronutrient-fortified complementary food supplement (KOKO Plus) on specific plasma EAA levels and stunting in infants aged 6-18 months. In a single-blind cluster-randomized controlled trial conducted in Ghana, infants were enrolled at 6 months and followed until 18 months. Thirty-eight communities were randomly assigned to receive KOKO Plus (KP, fourteen communities, n = 321), multiple-micronutrient powder (MN, thirteen communities, n = 327), or only nutritional education as control group (NE, eleven communities, n = 318), and all groups received nutrition education. Plasma amino acids (AAs) were measured at 6, 12, and 18 months (end point). Mixed-effects models were used to assess the effect of the intervention on plasma AAs, and the relationship between plasma branched-chain AAs (BCAAs) and the risk of stunting was assessed. At the end point, total BCAA concentrations (±standard error) significantly exceeded baseline in the KP (284.2 ± 4.3 μM) and NE (289.1 ± 4.4 μM) groups but not the MN group (264.4 ± 4.1 μM). After adjustment for compliance at 200 sachets, plasma BCAAs exceeded in the KP group (284.5 ± 4.2 μM) compared to the MN group (264.6 ± 4 μM). Plasma BCAAs were positively correlated with changes in length-for-age Z-score from baseline (R = 0.327, p = 0.048). In conclusion, the plasma BCAA concentrations of infants that received KP and the NE group was significantly higher compared to the MN group but there were no differences between the KP and NE group at end point. Improved plasma BCAAs may be due to improved nutrient intake by infants exposed to KP or NE. Low BCAAs were associated with stunting, replicating the previous finding.

      "abstract": "UNLABELLED: Urea cycle disorders (UCDs) are a group of rare inherited metabolic diseases causing hyperammonemic encephalopathy. Despite intensive dietary and pharmacological therapy, outcome is poor in a subset of UCD patients. Reducing ammonia production by changing faecal microbiome in UCD is an attractive treatment approach. We compared faecal microbiome composition of 10 UCD patients, 10 healthy control subjects and 10 phenylketonuria (PKU) patients. PKU patients on a low protein diet were included to differentiate between the effect of a low protein diet and the UCD itself on microbial composition. Participants were asked to collect a faecal sample and to fill out a 24 h dietary journal. DNA was extracted from faecal material, taxonomy was assigned and microbiome data was analyzed, with a focus on microbiota involved in ammonia metabolism.In this study we show an altered faecal microbiome in UCD patients, different from both PKU and healthy controls. UCD patients on dietary and pharmacological treatment had a less diverse faecal microbiome, and the faecal microbiome of PKU patients on a protein restricted diet with amino acid supplementation showed reduced richness compared to healthy adults without a specific diet. The differences in the microbiome composition of UCD patients compared to healthy controls were in part related to lactulose use. Other genomic process encodings involved in ammonia metabolism, did not seem to differ. Since manipulation of the microbiome is possible, this could be a potential treatment modality. We propose as a first next step, to study the impact of these faecal microbiome alterations on metabolic stability. TAKE HOME MESSAGE: The faecal microbiome of UCD patients was less diverse compared to PKU patients and even more compared to healthy controls."

      "abstract": "Essential amino acids (EAA) are critical for multiple physiological processes. Branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) supplementation provides energy substrates, promotes protein synthesis, and stimulates insulin secretion in rodents and humans. Most dairy cows face a protein and energy deficit during the first weeks postpartum and utilize body reserves to counteract this shortage. The objective was to evaluate the effect of rumen-protected BCAA (RP-BCAA; 375 g of 27% l-leucine, 85 g of 48% l-isoleucine, and 91 g of 67% l-valine) with or without oral propylene glycol (PG) administration on markers of liver health status, concentrations of nonesterified fatty acids (NEFA) and β-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) in plasma, and liver triglycerides (TG) during the early postpartum period in dairy cows. Multiparous Holstein cows were enrolled in blocks of 3 and randomly assigned to either the control group or 1 of the 2 treatments from calving until 35 d postpartum. The control group (n = 16) received 200 g of dry molasses per cow/d; the RP-BCAA group (n = 14) received RP-BCAA mixed with 200 g of dry molasses per cow/d; the RP-BCAA plus PG (RP-BCAAPG) group (n = 16) received RP-BCAA mixed with 200 g of dry molasses per cow/d, plus 300 mL of PG, once daily from calving until 7 d in milk (DIM). The RP-BCAA and RP-BCAAGP groups, on average (± standard deviation), were predicted to receive a greater supply of metabolizable protein in the form of l-Leu 27.4 ± 3.5 g/d, l-Ile 15.2 ± 1.8 g/d, and l-Val 24.2 ± 2.4 g/d compared with the control cows. Liver biopsies were collected at d 9 ± 4 prepartum and at 5 ± 1 and 21 ± 1 DIM. Blood was sampled 3 times per week from calving until 21 DIM. Milk yield, dry matter intake, NEFA, BHB, EAA blood concentration, serum chemistry, insulin, glucagon, and liver TG and protein abundance of total and phosphorylated branched-chain ketoacid dehydrogenase E1α (p-BCKDH-E1α) were analyzed using repeated measures ANOVA. Cows in the RP-BCAA and RP-BCAAPG groups had lower liver TG and lower activities of aspartate aminotransferase and glutamate dehydrogenase during the first 21 DIM, compared with control. All cows, regardless of treatment, showed an upregulation of p-BCKDH-E1α at d 5 postpartum, compared with levels at 21 d postpartum. Insulin, Met, and Glu blood concentration were greater in RP-BCAA and RP-BCAAPG compared with control during the first 35 DIM. Therefore, the use of RP-BCAA in combination with PG might be a feasible option to reduce hepatic lipidosis in dairy cows during early lactation.",

OBJECTIVES: We aimed to investigate the aminoacidemia and appetite responses of older adults after consuming breakfast, a meal frequently consumed with high-carbohydrate and below-par amounts of protein and leucine for stimulating MPS. METHODS: Five men and 3 women (means ± SD; age: 74 ± 7 y, BMI: 25.7 ± 4.9 kg/m2, fat- and bone-free mass: 63 ± 7 kg) took part in this experiment in which they consumed breakfasts with low-protein (LP = 13 ± 2 g), high-protein (HP = 32 ± 5 g), and LP followed by a protein- and leucine-enriched bar formulation 2 h later (LP + Bar = 29 ± 2 g). The LP, HP, and LP + Bar breakfast conditions contained 519 ± 86 kcal, 535 ± 83 kcal, and 739 ± 86 kcal, respectively. Blood samples were drawn for 6 h and analyzed for amino acid, insulin, and glucose concentrations. Visual analog scales were assessed for hunger, fullness, and desire to eat. RESULTS: The net AUC for essential amino acid (EAA) exposure was similar between the LP + Bar and HP conditions but greater in the HP condition compared with the LP condition. Peak leucinemia was higher in the LP + Bar condition compared with the HP, and both were greater than the LP condition. Net leucine exposure was similar between HP and LP + Bar, and both were greater than LP. Hunger was similarly reduced in LP + Bar and HP, and LP + Bar resulted in a greater hunger reduction than LP. Both LP + Bar and HP resulted in greater net fullness scores than LP. CONCLUSIONS: Consuming our bar formulation increased blood leucine availability and net exposure to EAAs to a similar degree as consuming a high-protein meal. High-protein at breakfast results in a greater net exposure to EAAs and leucine, which could support MPS in older persons. This study was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT03712761."

METHODS: A total of 680 one-d-old Ross 308 (as hatched) broiler chickens were used in a 35-d growth assay. Chicks were sorted into pens with 17 birds/pen and 10 pens/treatment. Treatment diets were contained either 44% or 48% crude protein (CP) soybean meal (SBM) with or without β-mannanase. RESULTS: Using SBM containing 48% CP led to an improvement (p<0.05) in feed conversion ratio (FCR) from d 1 to 14. Addition of β-mannanase to the diets significantly improved body weight gain (BWG) and FCR from d 1 to 14. During overall experimental period, BWG was affected (p<0.05) by CP level of SBM and inclusion of β-mannanase, but FCR and feed intake were not affected. Carcass characteristics were not influenced by treatment diets. The results showed that digestibility of dry matter (DM), nitrogen (N), and energy was not affected by CP level of SBM and/or inclusion of β-mannanase. Among essential amino acids (EAA) apparent digestibility of valine, methionine, and leucine improved (p<0.05) by the addition of β-mannanase to the diets. The results demonstrated that ileal digestibility of DM, N, and energy was not affected by treatment diets. Among EAA, the ileal digestibility of valine and arginine was higher (p<0.05) in the diets containing 48% CP SBM and/or β-mannanase. Excreta Lactobacillus count increased (p<0.05) by the addition of β-mannanase to the diets. Blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, and total protein level were not affected by treatments. CONCLUSION: Feeding chickens with diets containing 44% CP SBM resulted in detrimental effects on growth performance and digestibility of nutrients, but addition of β-mannanase to the 44% CP diet improved the growth performance of chickens without any effects on carcass characteristics."

      "abstract": "We have investigated the hypothesis that nutritional supplementation of the diet in low-physical-functioning older individuals with a specially formulated composition based on essential amino acids (EAAs) would improve physical function as compared to supplementation with the same amount of whey protein. A third group of comparable volunteers were given nutrition education but no supplementation of the diet. After 6 weeks of whey protein supplementation (n = 32), there was no effect on the distance walked in 6 minutes, but the distance walked improved significantly from the pre-value after 12 weeks of whey supplementation. EAA consumption (n = 28) significantly improved walking distance at both 6 and 12 weeks. The distance walked at 12 weeks (419.0 ± 25.0 m) was 35.4 m greater than the pre-value of 384.0 ± 23.0 m (p < .001). The increase in distance walked by the EAA group was also significantly greater than that in the whey group at both 6 and 12 weeks (p < .01). In contrast, a decrease in distance walked was observed in the control group (n = 32) (not statistically significant, NS). EAA supplementation also improved grip strength and leg strength, and decreased body weight and fat mass. Plasma low-density lipoprotein concentration was significantly reduced in the EAA group, as well as the concentration of macrophage migration inhibitory factor. There were no adverse responses in any groups, and compliance was greater than 95% in all individuals consuming supplements. We conclude that dietary supplementation with an EAA-based composition may be a beneficial therapy in older individuals with low physical functional capacity.

      "abstract": "The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of jugular infusions of 2 groups of AA on essential AA (EAA) transport and metabolism by mammary glands. Four Holstein cows in second lactation (66 ± 10 d in milk) were used in 4 × 4 Latin square design with a 2 × 2 factorial arrangement of treatments. Treatments were jugular infusions of saline; Met, Lys, and His (MKH); Ile and Leu (IL); or MKH plus IL (MKH+IL). Each period consisted of 8 d of no infusion followed by 8 d of jugular vein infusion of the treatment solutions. Amino acids were infused at rates of 21 g of Met, 38 g of Lys, 20 g of His, 50 g of Leu, and 22 g of Ile per day. Cows were fed a basal diet consisting of 15.2% crude protein with adequate rumen degradable protein but 15% deficient in MP based on estimates by Cornell Net Carbohydrate and Protein System (v6.5). On the last day of each period, 13C-AA derived from algae was infused into the jugular vein over 6 h, and blood and milk samples were collected before, during, and after infusion. Plasma and milk samples were analyzed for AA isotopic enrichment, and a mammary compartmental model was fitted to the data to derive bidirectional transport and metabolism rates for individual EAA. Influx of Leu increased with IL, whereas influx of other EAA was not different among treatments. Cellular efflux of Met and Lys to venous plasma represented 12 to 34% of influx, whereas cellular efflux of Phe and BCAA represented 29 to 59% of influx. Increased efflux/influx ratios of Ile and Leu with IL but not Met and Lys with MKH demonstrated that increased Ile and Leu influx was mostly returned to plasma resulting in no change in net uptake or efficiency. The isotope results showed that mammary net uptake of Lys and Ile increased during MKH infusion. Net uptake of Met increased with MKH but only in the absence of IL. Catabolism of Lys and Met only increased with MKH alone, resulting in decreased efficiency for milk protein, which demonstrated that Ile and Leu infusion can spare Lys and Met for milk protein synthesis. Total AA uptake to milk output was not different from 1, implying the catabolized Met and Lys contributed nitrogen to nonessential AA. Overall, EAA uptake and metabolism in mammary glands of dairy cows varied across individual EAA and responded differently to respective AA supplements. In addition, uptake, retention, and end use of AA by mammary tissue is variable and dependent on the mix of AA provided. This variability, depending on the mix of AA absorbed, will change the efficiency of utilization of individual AA at the mammary gland level and consequently the whole-body level. Thus, it is inaccurate to use a fixed, constant efficiency within and across AA to represent tissue activity.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The effects of ingesting varying essential amino acid (EAA)/protein-containing food formats on protein kinetics during energy deficit are undetermined. Therefore, recommendations for EAA/protein food formats necessary to optimize both whole-body protein balance and muscle protein synthesis (MPS) during energy deficit are unknown. We measured protein kinetics after consuming iso-nitrogenous amounts of free-form essential amino acid-enriched whey (EAA + W; 34.7 g protein, 24 g EAA sourced from whey and free-form EAA), whey (WHEY; 34.7 g protein, 18.7 g EAA), or a mixed-macronutrient meal (MEAL; 34.7 g protein, 11.4 g EAA) after exercise during short-term energy deficit. METHODS: Ten adults (mean ± SD; 21 ± 4 y; 25.7 ± 1.7 kg/m2) completed a randomized, double-blind crossover study consisting of three, 5 d energy-deficit periods (- 30 ± 3% of total energy requirements), separated by 14 d. Whole-body protein synthesis (PS), breakdown (PB), and net balance (NET) were determined at rest and in response to combination exercise consisting of load carriage treadmill walking, deadlifts, and box step-ups at the end of each energy deficit using L-[2H5]-phenylalanine and L-[2H2]-tyrosine infusions. Treatments were ingested immediately post-exercise. Mixed-muscle protein synthesis (mixed-MPS) was measured during exercise through recovery. RESULTS: Change (Δ postabsorptive + exercise to postprandial + recovery [mean treatment difference (95%CI)]) in whole-body (g/180 min) PS was 15.8 (9.8, 21.9; P = 0.001) and 19.4 (14.8, 24.0; P = 0.001) greater for EAA + W than WHEY and MEAL, respectively, with no difference between WHEY and MEAL. ΔPB was - 6.3 (- 11.5, - 1.18; P = 0.02) greater for EAA + W than WHEY and - 7.7 (- 11.9, - 3.6; P = 0.002) greater for MEAL than WHEY, with no difference between EAA + W and MEAL. ΔNET was 22.1 (20.5, 23.8; P = 0.001) and 18.0 (16.5, 19.5; P = 0.00) greater for EAA + W than WHEY and MEAL, respectively, while ΔNET was 4.2 (2.7, 5.6; P = 0.001) greater for MEAL than WHEY. Mixed-MPS did not differ between treatments. CONCLUSIONS: While mixed-MPS was similar across treatments, combining free-form EAA with whey promotes greater whole-body net protein balance during energy deficit compared to iso-nitrogenous amounts of whey or a mixed-macronutrient meal.

The essential amino acids (EAA) and total amino acids (TAA) slightly decreased, ratio of EAA to TAA increased, while the calculated protein efficiency ratio decreased. Significant decrease in the SH content and non-significant increase in SS content was observed at higher doses of ozone. The overall saturated and unsaturated fatty acids (%) were in the range of 13.05-13.49 and 86.51-87.61, respectively.

      "abstract": "The majority of estrogen receptor positive (ER+) breast cancer (BC) maintain the ER at metastatic sites. Despite anti-estrogen therapy, almost 30% of ER+ BC patients relapse. Thus, new therapeutic targets for ER+ BC are needed. Amino acids (AAs) may affect the metastatic capacity by affecting inflammatory cells. Essential AAs (EAAs) cannot be produced by human cells and might therefore be targetable as therapeutics. Here we sampled extracellular EAAs in vivo by microdialysis in human BC. Mass spectrometry-based proteomics was used to identify proteins affected after EAA and estradiol (E2) exposure to BC cells. Proteins relevant for patient survival were identified, knocked down in BC cells, and metastatic capability was determined in vivo in the transgenic zebrafish model. We found that lysine was the most utilized EAA in human ER+BC in vivo. In zebrafish, lysine in presence of E2 increased neutrophil-dependent dissemination of ER+ BC cells via upregulation of U2AF1 and RPN2 proteins, which both correlated with poor prognosis of ER+ BC patients in clinical databases. Knockdown of U2AF1 and RPN2 decreased the expression of several cell-adhesion molecules resulting in diminished dissemination. Dietary lysine or its related metabolic pathways may be useful therapeutic targets in ER+ BC."

      "abstract": "The objective of this study was to extend a stable isotope-based assessment of AA absorption from rumen-degradable protein (RDP) sources to include determination of essential AA (EAA) availability from microbial protein (MCP). To demonstrate the technique, a study using a 2 × 2 factorial arrangement of treatments applied in a repeated 4 × 4 Latin square design was undertaken. Factors were high and low rumen-degradable protein and high and low starch. Twelve lactating cows were blocked into 3 groups according to days in milk and randomly assigned to the 4 treatment sequences. Each period was 14 d in length with 10 d of adaption followed by 4 d of ruminal infusions of 15N-labeled ammonium sulfate. On the last day of each period, a 13C-labeled AA mixture was infused into the jugular vein over a 6-h period to assess total AA entry. Rumen, blood, urine, and milk samples were collected during the infusions. Ruminal bacteria and blood samples were assessed for AA enrichment. Total plasma AA absorption rates were derived for 6 EAA from plasma 13C AA enrichment. Absorption of 6 EAA from MCP was calculated from total AA absorption based on 15N enrichment in blood and rumen bacteria. Essential AA absorption rates from total protein, MCP, and rumen-undegradable protein were derived with standard errors of the mean of 6, 14, and 14%, respectively. An average of 45% of absorbed EAA were from MCP, which varied among 6 EAA and was interactively affected by starch and RDP in diets. Microbial AA availability measured by isotope dilution method increased with the high RDP diets and was unaffected by starch level, except for Met, which decreased with high starch. Microbial protein outflow, estimated from urinary purine derivatives, increased with RDP and was not significantly affected by starch. This was consistent with measurements from the isotope dilution method. Total AA absorption rates measured from isotope dilution were similar to estimates from CNCPS (v. 6.55), but a lower proportion of absorbed AA was derived from MCP for the former method. Compared with the isotope and CNCPS estimates, the Fleming model underestimated microbial EAA and total EAA availability. An average of 58% of the absorbed EAA was converted into milk, which varied among individual AA and was interactively affected by starch and RDP in diets. The isotope dilution approach is advantageous because it provides estimates of EAA availability for individual EAA from rumen-undegradable protein and MCP directly with fewer errors of measurement than can be achieved with intestinal disappearance methods.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Muscle mass is an important determinant of metabolic health and physical function. It has previously been demonstrated that the postprandial rise in circulating essential amino acids acts as the main stimulus for muscle protein synthesis (MPS). The current study investigated the postprandial plasma essential amino acid (EAA) and branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) responses of (1) Hydrolyzed whey protein isolate (HWPI) compared to plasma treated non-hydrolyzed whey protein isolate (PT-NHWPI), (2) standard branch-chain amino acids (S-BCAA) compared to plasma treated branch-chained amino acids (PT-BCAA), (3) standard pea protein (S-PP), compared to plasma treated pea protein (PT-PP), and (4) HWPI compared to PT-PP. METHODS: Ten subjects (24.6 ± 5.3 years; 178.8 ± 8.1 cm; 78.6 ± 10.1 kg) participated in a double-blind, randomized, crossover trial comparing four separate protein conditions (HWPI, PT-NHWPI, S-PP, PT-PP). A separate cohort of ten subjects (26.4 ± 7.4 years; 178.8 ± 5.9 cm; 85 ± 12.3 kg) participated in a double-blind randomized, crossover trial comparing two branch-chain amino acid conditions: S-BCAA and PT-BCAA. All conditions were administered following a 7-day washout. Plasma EAA and BCAA concentrations were assessed from blood donated by subjects at pre-consumption, 30-, 60-, 90-, 120-, and 180 minutes post-consumption. RESULTS: Blood plasma levels of total EAA and BCAA concentration were significantly greater in all treated conditions at 30-, 60-, 90-, and 120 minutes post consumption (P < .05). There were no differences between PT-PP and HWPI. DISCUSSION: All proteins significantly elevated EAAs, and BCAAs from basal levels. However, we conclude that the consumption of the treated proteins significantly raises blood levels of EAAs, and BCAAs to a greater extent across multiple dairy, vegan, and isolated BCAA conditions. Moreover, atmospheric plasma treatment of a vegan protein source makes its amino acid response similar to whey. Thus, protein supplementation with that has undergone Ingredient Optimized® atmospheric plasma treatment technology may be highly beneficial for improving the blood plasma amino acid response."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND & AIMS: Consuming 0.10-0.14 g essential amino acids (EAA)/kg/dose (0.25-0.30 g protein/kg/dose) maximally stimulates muscle protein synthesis (MPS) during energy balance. Whether consuming EAA beyond that amount enhances MPS and whole-body anabolism following energy deficit is unknown. The aims of this study were to determine the effects of standard and high EAA ingestion on mixed MPS and whole-body protein turnover following energy deficit. DESIGN: Nineteen males (mean ± SD; 23 ± 5 y; 25.4 ± 2.7 kg/m2) completed a randomized, double-blind crossover study consisting of two, 5-d energy deficits (-30 ± 4% of total energy requirements), separated by 14-d. Following each energy deficit, mixed MPS and whole-body protein synthesis (PS), breakdown (PB), and net balance (NET) were determined at rest and post-resistance exercise (RE) using primed, constant L-[2H5]-phenylalanine and L-[2H2]-tyrosine infusions. Beverages providing standard (0.1 g/kg, 7.87 ± 0.87 g) or high (0.3 g/kg, 23.5 ± 2.54 g) EAA were consumed post-RE. Circulating EAA were measured. RESULTS: Postabsorptive mixed MPS (%/h) at rest was not different (P = 0.67) between treatments. Independent of EAA, postprandial mixed MPS at rest (standard EAA, 0.055 ± 0.01; high EAA, 0.061 ± 0.02) and post-RE (standard EAA, 0.055 ± 0.01; high EAA, 0.065 ± 0.02) were greater than postabsorptive mixed MPS at rest (P = 0.02 and P = 0.01, respectively). Change in (Δ postabsorptive) whole-body (g/180 min) PS and PB was greater for high than standard EAA [mean treatment difference (95% CI), 3.4 (2.3, 4.4); P = 0.001 and -15.6 (-17.8, -13.5); P = 0.001, respectively]. NET was more positive for high than standard EAA [19.0 (17.3, 20.7); P = 0.001]. EAA concentrations were greater in high than standard EAA (P = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate that high compared to standard EAA ingestion enhances whole-body protein status during underfeeding. However, the effects of consuming high and standard EAA on mixed MPS are the same during energy deficit. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRY: NCT03372928, https://clinicaltrials.gov.",

In the present study, nine regulatory genes of EAAs metabolic pathway, i.e., aspartate kinase, homoserine dehydrogenase, threonine synthase, threonine dehydratase, dihydrodipicolinate synthase, cystathionine γ synthase, anthranilate synthase, acetolactate synthase and lysine 2-oxoglutarato reductase/saccharopine dehydrogenase (LOR/SD) were identified from the transcriptomic data of developing spikes of two finger millet genotypes, i.e., GP-45 and GP-1. Results of sequence alignment search and motif/domain analysis showed high similarity of nucleotide sequences of identified regulatory genes with their respective homologs in rice. Results of promoter analysis revealed the presence of various cis-regulatory elements, like nitrogen responsive cis-elements (O2-site and GCN4), light responsive cis-elements, and stress responsive cis-elements. The presence of nine regulatory genes identified from the transcriptomic data of GP-45 and GP-1 was further confirmed by real time expression analysis in high and low protein containing genotypes, i.e., GE-3885 and GE-1437. Results of real time expression analysis showed significantly higher expression (p ≤ 0.01) of regulatory genes in GE-3885 rather than GE-1437 under control and treatment condition. Crude protein content of GE-3885 was found to be significantly higher (p ≤ 0.01) in comparison to GE-1437 under control condition, while under treatment condition GE-1437 was found to be more responsive to KNO3 treatment rather than GE-3885."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Indians have a poor protein intake in terms of quantity as well as quality because of their predominantly cereal-based diet. However, there is limited information on circulatory amino acid levels in healthy Indians. Herein, we evaluated the acute effect of a protein supplement on the plasma levels of essential amino acids (EAAs) in healthy Indian adults, using targeted EAA analysis. METHODS: In this double-blind, randomized, crossover study, 20 healthy Indian adults were randomized to receive the test protein supplement (treatment arm, n = 10) or placebo (control arm, n = 10) with milk, after overnight fasting. After 7 days, the participants returned for the crossover treatment. Blood samples were collected at baseline and at 60 and 120 min after protein/placebo consumption. Plasma EAA levels were estimated using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Repeated measures ANOVA was performed to assess the effect of treatment on EAA levels. P values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. RESULTS: At baseline, mean plasma levels did not differ significantly between the two arms for any of the EAAs. In the treatment arm, the mean levels of all EAAs increased significantly from baseline to 60 min (P < 0.01), with no significant change from 60 to 120 min. There was no significant change in amino acid levels in the control arm. The magnitude as well as percentage of increase from baseline to 60 min was significantly greater in the treatment arm than in the control arm for all EAAs. CONCLUSION: Compared to placebo, protein supplement increased circulatory amino acid levels in healthy Indians. The observed increase in EAA levels and its role in conjunction with exercise in both healthy and diseased states need to be further evaluated. This is the first dataset exploring targeted EAA profiles and the effect of a protein supplement among healthy Indians. The clinical trial is registered with CTRI/2018/12/016777."

      "abstract": "Necrotic enteritis (NE) is an infection of the gastrointestinal tract and is estimated to cost the global poultry industry billions of dollars annually. A study was conducted to examine whether reducing the crude protein might offset the severity of NE in broilers experimentally challenged with Eimeria spp. on day 9 and Clostridium perfringens on days 14 and 15. Furthermore, increasing the dietary amino acid (AA) density of the diet was also examined owing to identified benefits of improving performance compromised from low protein (LP) diets or NE. A 2 × 2 × 3 factorial arrangement of treatments at 6 replicates per treatment was used with 972 Ross 308 cockerels fed wheat-sorghum-soy-based diets to 35 D. Factors were NE challenge: no or yes; protein: standard (SP) or LP; and AA density: 100% AA, 115% with only essential AA (115% EAA) increased, and 115% AA with both essential and nonessential AA (115% AA) increased. The performance was measured in grower (days 7-21), finisher (days 21-35), and overall (day 7-35) periods. In addition, on day 16, intestinal lesion score and cecal short-chain fatty acids were measured. Only in nonchallenged birds fed LP diets, 115% AA increased grower feed intake (P < 0.01) and body weight gain (P < 0.05) compared to 115% EAA treatments. Challenge increased jejunal lesions (P < 0.001) with no difference between dietary treatments. Finisher body weight gain was greater in nonchallenged birds fed the 115% AA diets than in challenged birds (P < 0.05). Feeding diets with higher nonessential AA encouraged faster recovery from NE challenge. When fed the SP diets, NE challenge increased cecal butyric acid (P < 0.01) and total short-chain fatty acids (P < 0.05). The nutrient matrix used in LP diets does not favor beneficial butyric acid-producing bacteria. Using LP diets to mitigate NE severity does not offset the predisposing effect of E. spp. when attacking the gastrointestinal tract, and NE recovery is favored when feeding SP diets or additional AA.",

      "abstract": "Making dairy farming more cost-effective and reducing nitrogen environmental pollution could be reached through a reduced input of dietary protein, provided productivity is not compromised. This could be achieved through balancing dairy rations for essential amino acids (EAA) rather than their aggregate, the metabolizable protein (MP). This review revisits the estimations of the major true protein secretions in dairy cows, milk protein yield (MPY), metabolic fecal protein (MFP), endogenous urinary loss and scurf and associated AA composition. The combined efficiency with which MP (EffMP) or EAA (EffAA) is used to support protein secretions is calculated as the sum of true protein secretions (MPY + MFP + scurf) divided by the net supply (adjusted to remove the endogenous urinary excretion: MPadj and AAadj). Using the proposed protein and AA secretions, EffMP and EffAA were predicted through meta-analyses (807 treatment means) and validated using an independent database (129 treatment means). The effects of MPadj or AAadj, plus digestible energy intake (DEI), days in milk (DIM) and parity (primiparous v. multiparous), were significant in all models. Models using (MPadj, MPadj × MPadj, DEI and DEI × DEI) or (MPadj/DEI and MPadj/DEI × MPadj/DEI) had similar corrected Akaike's information criterion, but the model using MPadj/DEI performed better in the validation database. A model that also included this ratio was, therefore, used to fitting equations to predict EffAA. These equations predicted well EffAA in the validation database except for Arg which had a strong slope bias. Predictions of MPY from predicted EffMP based on MPadj/DEI, MPadj/DEI × MPadj/DEI, DIM and parity yielded a better fit than direct predictions of MPY based on MPadj, MPadj × MPadj, DEI, DIM and parity. Predictions of MPY based on each EffAA yielded fairly similar results among AA. It is proposed to ponder the mean of MPY predictions obtained from each EffAA by the lowest prediction to retain the potential limitation from AA with the shortest supply. Overall, the revisited estimations of endogenous urinary excretion and MFP, revised AA composition of protein secretions and inclusion of a variable combined EffAA (based on AAadj/DEI, AAadj/DEI × Aadj/DEI, DIM and parity) offer the potential to improve predictions of MPY, identify which AA are potentially in short supply and, therefore, improve the AA balance of dairy rations.",

      "abstract": "Today, consumers are very health conscious and are more aware of the nutritional value of food, especially of meat, than they were in the past. The aim of this study was to evaluate the carcass parameters and meat quality of Tibetan sheep and Small-tailed Han sheep when consuming a diet of low-protein (~7%) and different energy yields (digestible energy, 8.21, 9.33, 10.45 and 11.57 MJ/kg) in the cold season. Twelve sheep of each breed were divided randomly into four treatments of different diets with three replicates per treatment per breed. Crude protein of the meat decreased linearly (p < .05), whereas energy increased linearly (p < .05) with an increase in energy level. Tibetan sheep tended to have a higher (p < .1) dressing percentage and rib eye area, while live body weight and hot carcass weight did not differ between breeds but increased linearly (p < .01) with an increase in energy level. Water holding capacity, as indicated by pressing loss and drip loss, did not differ between breeds and was not affected by dietary energy. The concentration of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) was greater in Tibetan sheep meat but saturated fatty acids (SFAs), monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) and n-6 PUFA did not differ between breeds. With an increase in energy content of the diet, SFA decreased (p < .05), whereas MUFA increased (p < .05). The n-6:n-3 PUFA ratio was lower (p < .001) in Tibetan sheep meat, while the atherogenic index did not differ between breeds, but tended to decrease (p < .1) with an increase in dietary energy content. The essential amino acid (EAA) content and ratio of EAA:NEAA (non-essential amino acid) were close to the world standards for healthy meat. In summary, (a) Tibetan sheep meat was preferable to Small-tailed Han sheep meat, although differences between breeds were small; and (b) some carcass parameters and meat quality were improved with an increase in dietary energy level when a low-protein diet was offered.",

Plasma leucine, branch-chained amino acids, and essential amino acid concentrations for PW were significantly higher than CON (p < 0.05) at 30 min and similar to W. Compared to IP, PW was the only treatment with elevated plasma leucine levels at 30 min (p = 0.007; ∆ = 57.8 mmol/L, 95% Confidence Interval (CI): 20.0, 95.6) and EAA levels at 180 min (p = 0.003; ∆ = 179.1 mmol/L, 95% CI: 77.5, 280.7). Area under the curve amino acid analysis revealed no differences between PW and W. While no different than W, these data indicate that PW was the only group to produce elevated amino acid concentrations 30-min and 180-min post-ingestion."

A high protein glycation level has been suggested to compromise the post-prandial rise in plasma amino acid availability following protein ingestion. In the present study, we assessed the impact of glycation level of milk protein on post-prandial plasma amino acid responses in humans. Fifteen healthy, young men (age 26 (SEM 1) years, BMI 24 (SEM 1) kg/m2) participated in this randomised cross-over study and ingested milk protein powder with protein glycation levels of 3, 20 and 50 % blocked lysine. On each trial day, arterialised blood samples were collected at regular intervals during a 6-h post-prandial period to assess plasma amino acid concentrations using ultra-performance liquid chromatography. Plasma essential amino acid (EAA) concentrations increased following milk protein ingestion, with the 20 and 50 % glycated milk proteins showing lower overall EAA responses compared with the 3 % glycated milk protein (161 (SEM 7) and 142 (SEM 7) v. 178 (SEM 9) mmol/l × 6 h, respectively; P ≤ 0·011). The lower post-prandial plasma amino acid responses were fully attributed to an attenuated post-prandial rise in circulating plasma lysine concentrations. Plasma lysine responses (incremental AUC) following ingestion of the 20 and 50 % glycated milk proteins were 35 (SEM 4) and 92 (SEM 2) % lower compared with the 3 % glycated milk protein (21·3 (SEM 1·4) and 2·8 (SEM 0·7) v. 33·3 (SEM 1·7) mmol/l × 6 h, respectively; P < 0·001).

      "abstract": "Despite the well-characterised mechanisms of amino acids (AA) regulation of milk protein synthesis in mammary glands (MG), the underlying specific AA regulatory machinery in bovine MG remains further elucidated. As methionine (Met) is one of the most important essential and limiting AA for dairy cows, it is crucial to expand how Met exerts its regulatory effects on dairy milk protein synthesis. Our previous work detected the potential regulatory role of seryl-tRNA synthetase (SARS) in essential AA (EAA)-stimulated bovine casein synthesis. Here, we investigated whether and how SARS participates in Met stimulation of casein production in bovine mammary epithelial cells (BMEC). With or without RNA interference against SARS, BMEC were treated with the medium in the absence (containing all other EAA and devoid of Met alone)/presence (containing 0·6 mm of Met in the medium devoid of Met alone) of Met. The protein abundance of β-casein and members of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and general control nonderepressible 2 (GCN2) pathways was determined by immunoblot assay after 6 h treatment, the cell viability and cell cycle progression were determined by cell counting and propidium iodide-staining assay after 24 h treatment, and protein turnover was determined by l-[ring-3H5]phenylalanine isotope tracing assay after 48 h treatment. In the absence of Met, there was a general reduction in cell viability, total protein synthesis and β-casein production; in contrast, total protein degradation was enhanced. SARS knockdown strengthened these changes. Finally, SARS may work to promote Met-stimulated β-casein synthesis via affecting mTOR and GCN2 routes in BMEC.",

Protein and essential amino acid (EAA) supplementation could be a viable treatment strategy to prevent declines in muscle strength and performance, and subsequently improve QoL and survival. This systematic review (PROSPERO: CRD42018103649) aimed to assess the effect of dietary protein and/or EAA supplementation on muscle strength and performance in people with CHF. METHODS: Searches of PubMed, MEDLINE and Embase identified studies that reported changes in strength or muscle performance following protein and/or EAA supplementation in patients with CHF. Following PRISMA guidelines and using predefined inclusion/exclusion criteria relating to participants, intervention, control, outcome and study design, two reviewers independently screened titles, abstracts and full manuscripts for eligibility. Risk of bias was assessed using Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool (RCTs) or Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool (cohort studies). Data were extracted for analysis using predefined criteria. RESULTS: Five randomised controlled trials (RCT) and one cohort study met our inclusion criteria. All RCTs had a high risk of bias. The methodological quality of the cohort study was moderate. Heterogeneity of extracted data prevented meta-analyses, qualitative synthesis was therefore performed. Data from 167 patients with CHF suggest that protein and/or EAA supplementation does not improve strength, but may increase six-minute walk test distance, muscle mass and QoL. CONCLUSIONS: The limited quality of the studies makes firm conclusions difficult, however protein and/or EAA supplementation may improve important outcome measures related to sarcopenia. High-quality randomised controlled studies are needed.",

      "abstract": "Nitrogen efficiency in dairy cows can be improved by more precisely supplying essential amino acids (EAA) relative to animal needs, which requires accurate estimates of the availability of individual EAA from feedstuffs. The objective of this study was to determine EAA availability for 7 feed ingredients. Seven heifers (258 ± 28 kg BW) were randomly chosen and assigned to 8 treatment sequences in a 7 × 8 incomplete Latin square design. Treatments were a basal diet (BD), and 10% (on a dry matter basis) of BD replaced by corn silage (CS), grass hay (GH), alfalfa hay (AH), dried distillers grain (DDGS), soybean hulls (SH), wet brewers grain (BG), or corn grain (CG). Total plasma AA entry rates were estimated for each EAA within each diet by fitting a 4-pool dynamic model to observed plasma, 13C AA enrichment resulting from a 2-h constant infusion of a 13C algal AA mixture. Individual EAA availability from each test ingredient was determined by regression of entry rates for that AA on crude protein intake for each ingredient. The derived plasma total EAA entry rates for corn silage, grass hay, alfalfa hay, dried distillers grain, soyhulls, brewers grain, and corn grain were 30.6 ± 3.4, 27.4 ± 3.2, 31.3 ± 3.4, 37.2 ± 3.2, 26.4 ± 3.2, 37.8 ± 3.2, and 33.5 ± 3.2% (±standard error) of EAA from each ingredient, respectively. Using the previous estimate of 8.27% EAA utilization by splanchnic tissues during first pass, total rumen-undegradable protein EAA absorbed from the gut lumen was 33.4, 29.9, 34.1, 40.6, 28.8, 41.2, and 36.5% of the EAA in each ingredient respectively.",

The objective of this study was to assess whether various extracellular AA profiles and varied ratios of Lys to Met would increase the phosphorylation of signaling proteins related to protein metabolism. Six AA profiles, reflecting Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), blood meal (BM), corn gluten meal (CGM), casein (CAS), plasma of lactating cows (PLA), and a negative control (NEG) represented the first factor (F1), and the ratio of Lys to Met (unaltered or set to 3:1) was the second factor (F2). Treatments were arranged in a 6 × 2 factorial manner, resulting in 12 treatments that were replicated 4 times. The total AA masses for all treatments were set to 659 mg/L (63% of DMEM) except NEG (0 mg/L). Confluent mammary epithelial cells were exposed to treatment media for 80 min (SD = 7.4). Intracellular concentrations of 17 AA were changed according to F1. The Met and Leu percent of total intracellular AA mass, as an example, varied from 0.58 (PLA) to 6.94 (NEG, +F2) for Met and 0.05 (NEG, -F2) to 4.63 (CGM, +F2) for Leu. Overall, balancing for Lys and Met at a 3:1 ratio increased intracellular concentrations of Lys and Met by 54 and 71%, respectively. Within the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway, phosphorylation of mTOR (Ser2448), ribosomal protein S6 (Ser235/236), and eukaryotic initiation factor 4E binding protein 1 (Thr37/46) (4EBP1) were increased by all 5 AA profiles compared with the NEG control. We found no differences in phosphorylation state among the 5 AA profiles, indicating lack of sensitivity to various AA profiles. This lack of sensitivity between AA profiles might also be due to assay imprecision or other experimental limitations. Only phosphorylation of 4EBP1 was increased for F2. Phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 α subunit (Ser51) was unaffected by either F1 or F2 factors. Regression analyses indicated that intracellular concentrations of Met, Thr, Ile, and Leu predicted phosphorylation of mTOR-related proteins with adequate precision and accuracy, suggesting that multiple EAA dictate regulation, regardless of AA ratios. Changes in extracellular AA profiles translated to modified intracellular AA profiles, and no single profile uniquely stimulated phosphorylation of the mTOR pathway-related proteins.",

Methods: An extensive literature search was performed using the PubMed and the Google Scholar databases. Results: Falls are a common and costly source of injury and death in elderly adults. A large proportion of injurious falls are due to a trip or slip, suggesting that muscular factors are major determinants of both fall risk and the risk for fall-related injury. Conclusion: An increasing body of evidence links sarcopenia, the loss of muscle strength and mass that occurs with advancing age, with an increased risk for falls. Nutritional factors, as well as exercise, can help with both prevention and treatment of sarcopenia and may reduce the risk of falls in the elderly.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND & AIMS: The combination of prolonged essential amino acid (EAA) supplementation and aerobic exercise training (Ex) improves muscle protein metabolism, strength and function in healthy older adults. However, excess EAA intake may worsen insulin sensitivity. Here we report the effects of EAA supplementation (EAA, n = 11), placebo (PLA, n = 10), aerobic exercise with placebo (Ex + PLA, n = 11) or Ex with EAA supplementation (Ex + EAA, n = 10) for 22 weeks on insulin sensitivity in non-diabetic older adults. METHODS: A 2 × 2 design with block randomization and double blinding for supplement or placebo was used. Subjects ingested EAA (15 g) or placebo daily. Exercising subjects participated in supervised progressive vigorous treadmill walking 3 times weekly. Measures of insulin sensitivity by oral glucose tolerance testing were collected at baseline and 22 weeks. Dietary intakes of protein and specific amino acids were determined in a subset of subjects. RESULTS: Overall, exercise improved insulin sensitivity, while EAA supplementation had no effect. In the dietary subset, post-intervention insulin sensitivity did not correlate significantly with the total intake of EAA, anti-angiogenic amino acids (cysteine, methionine), or branched-chain amino acids (isoleucine, leucine, valine). CONCLUSIONS: Overall, we conclude that in healthy older adults with moderate protein intake, EAA supplementation is metabolically safe as it does not decrease insulin sensitivity regardless of its combination with aerobic exercise. Thus, daily protein intake should be controlled for when modeling insulin sensitivity. Future studies should explore the role of increased blood flow as a potential explanatory factor for the observed interaction between aerobic exercise and supplementation.

Despite the proven tumorigenic role of SLC3A2 in a number of cancers including head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC), the link between SLC3A2, autophagy regulation and tumor radioresistance remained elusive. In a recently published study we demonstrated that low levels of SLC3A2 and SLC7A5/LAT1 protein expression significantly correlate with good clinical prognosis in locally advanced HNSCC treated with primary radiochemotherapy. The SLC3A2-deficient HNSCC cells show a higher radiosensitivity and increased autophagy levels. We found that autophagy activation is a tumor survival strategy to overcome nutrient stress by lack of SLC3A2 and to withstand radiation-mediated cell damage. Inhibition of the autophagy activation in SLC3A2 knockout HNSCC cells by knockdown of ATG5 expression or treatment with bafilomycin A1 results in radiosensitivity. Consequently, the expression levels of ATG5 correlates with overall survival in HNSCC patients, and autophagy inhibition in combination with SLC3A2-targeted therapy can be a promising strategy for HNSCC radiosensitization.

With caged bee experiments and whole-colony field experiments, we examined the effects of supplementing bees with essential amino acids (EAA), or a control treatment of nonessential amino acids (NAA). Caged bees fed EAA developed significantly greater head weights than controls, weights that were similar to nurse bees. Caged bees fed EAA developed significantly greater thorax weights than controls, weights that were similar to foragers. Higher head and thorax weights may respectively reflect increased glandular development in nurse bees and higher flight muscle mass in forager bees. In our field study, 29% of the pollen collected by our honey bee colonies came from eucalyptus trees. Amino acid analyses revealed no EAA deficiencies for the bee-collected polyfloral pollen or for monofloral eucalyptus pollen. Colonies fed 29 g EAA supplement may have slightly increased individual bee growth and brood rearing, but this effect was not significant. A clear colony result was a correlation between nurse bee physiology and brood development: 17% increase in nurse bee weight corresponded to 100% more capped brood cells (R2 = 0.38). We suggest that colony supplementation should target nurse bee nutrition. Nurse bees eventually become forager bees. Hence, increased glandular development may support colony brood development and greater flight muscle mass may assist colony foraging.",

Compared with P and M, supplementation with eAA plus M increased total fat-free mass (vs. P: +2190 g; p < 0.01; vs. M: +2107 g; p < 0.05). M alone lowered albumin levels (vs. P: -0.39 g; p < 0.01; vs. eAA: -0.47 g; p < 0.01). This data on albumin was confirmed by within-group analysis (M -0.44g; p < 0.001; eAAM: -0.34 p < 0.05). M and eAA seemed to lower the percentage of gynoid fat (p < 0.05) and android fat (p < 0.01). No significant changes in inflammation or strength were reported. A 4-week intervention with eAA plus M together may be effective in enhancing fat-free-mass compared to M and P but not versus eAA. M alone demonstrates a negative effect on albumin level."

It has previously been demonstrated that the postprandial rise in circulating essential amino acids (EAA) acts as the main stimulus for muscle protein synthesis (MPS). This study investigated postprandial plasma amino acid (AA) responses of 2 different forms of whey protein isolate (WPI) with iso-caloric and iso-nitrogenous profiles to investigate plasma concentrations of EAA. METHODS: In all, 12 healthy men (n = 12) between 19 and 32 years of age were recruited for a randomized, cross-over design, which involved consumption of protein supplements on 2 testing days separated by a 6-day washout period between conditions. On each testing day, subjects consumed either 29.6 g of WPI or WPI + io (whey protein isolate plus Ingredient Optimized Protein®) mixed with 236 mL of water. Plasma EAA and branch chain amino acid (BCAA) concentrations were assessed from whole body donated by subjects at pre-consumption and 30, 60, 90, 120, and 180 minutes post consumption. RESULTS: Plasma levels of total EAA concentration was significantly greater in WPI + io at 30, 60, 90, and 120 minutes post consumption (P < .01, P < .001, P < .01, and P < .01, respectively). Plasma levels of total BCAA concentration was significantly greater in WPI + io at 30, 60, 90, and 120 minutes post consumption (P < .01, P < .001, P < .01, and P < .05, respectively) compared with WPI. For leucine, only WPI + io had elevated levels compared with pre-test at 90 minutes post consumption (P < .001). DISCUSSION: Both conditions significantly elevated EAA, BCAA, and leucine from basal levels. However, we conclude that the consumption of the treated WPI significantly raises plasma EAA, BCAA, and leucine to a greater extent compared with WPI with no treatment. Thus, supplementation with WPI that has undergone Ingredient Optimized® technology may be highly beneficial for those who partake in regular exercise, elderly individuals, or those affected by a reduced sensitivity to amino acids."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: A very low protein diet (VLPD) with ketoacid analogs of essential amino acids (KA/EAA) administration can remarkably influence protein synthesis and metabolic disturbances of patients with advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD), and may also slow the decline in renal function. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was carried out to monitor renal progression and metabolic and nutritional status among 140 patients with CKD stage III or IV. One group (n = 70) was on a low protein diet (LPD) with 0.6 g of protein intake, and another group (n = 70) was on a VLPD with 0.3 g of protein and KA/EAA supplementation of 100 mg/kg/day for 12 months. RESULTS: At 12-month follow-up, estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) significantly decreased from 41.6 ± 10.2 to 36.4 ± 8.8 mL/min/1.73 m2 (P < 0.001) and urine protein increased from 0.6 ± 0.5 to 0.9 ± 1.1 g/day (P = 0.017) in the LPD group, but no significant changes in estimated GFR and urine protein were found in the VLPD plus KA/EAA group. A significant mean difference in rate of change in estimated GFR (-5.2 ± 3.6 mL/min/1.73 m2 per year; P < 0.001) was observed between the two groups. After Cox regression analysis, treatment with VLPD plus KA/EAA significantly protected against the incidence of declining GFR > 10% annually (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.42; 95% confidence interval, 0.23-0.79; P = 0.006) and significant correlations were found between using VLPD plus KA/EEA and increased GFR. CONCLUSION: VLPD supplementation with KA/EAA is associated with delayed renal progression while preserving the nutritional status in the patients with CKD. Co-administration of VLPD and KA/EAA may prove an effective alternative to conservative management of CKD."

We sought to determine whether perioperative supplementation with essential amino acids (EAA) would attenuate muscle atrophy following TKA and whether the supplements were safe for ingestion in an older surgical population. METHODS: We performed a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial of 39 adults (age range, 53 to 76 years) undergoing primary unilateral TKA who ingested 20 g of EAA (n = 19) or placebo (n = 20) twice daily for 7 days preoperatively and for 6 weeks postoperatively. At baseline and 6 weeks postoperatively, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans were obtained to measure quadriceps and hamstrings muscle volume. Secondary outcomes included functional mobility and strength. Data on physical activity, diet, and patient-reported outcomes (Veterans RAND 12-Item Health Survey and Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score) were collected. Safety was determined through blood tests evaluating blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, creatinine clearance, homocysteine, and renal and liver function. Laboratory values at baseline, on the day of surgery, and at 2 days, 2 weeks, and 6 weeks postoperatively were compared between treatment groups. Analysis of covariance models, with baseline values as covariates, were used to evaluate outcomes between treatment groups. P values were adjusted for multiple tests. RESULTS: Compared with baseline, the EAA group had significantly less decrease in mean quadriceps muscle volume compared with the placebo group in the involved leg (-8.5% ± 2.5% compared with -13.4% ± 1.9%; p = 0.033) and the contralateral leg (-1.5% ± 1.6% compared with -7.2% ± 1.4%; p = 0.014). The hamstrings also demonstrated a greater muscle-volume-sparing effect for the EAA group than for the placebo group in the involved leg (-7.4% ± 2.0% compared with -12.2% ± 1.4%; p = 0.036) and contralateral leg (-2.1% ± 1.3% compared with -7.5% ± 1.5%; p = 0.005). There were no differences between the groups in terms of functional measures or strength. Blood chemistry values varied significantly between assessments periods but did not statistically differ between groups. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the present study suggest that EAA supplementation is safe and reduces the loss of muscle volume in older adults recovering from TKA.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Exercise and protein ingestion preserve muscle mass during moderate energy deficits. OBJECTIVE: To determine the molecular mechanisms by which exercise and protein ingestion may spare muscle mass during severe energy deficit (5500 kcal/day). DESIGN: Fifteen overweight, but otherwise healthy men, underwent a pre-test (PRE), caloric restriction (3.2 kcals/kg body weight/day) + exercise (45 min one-arm cranking + 8 h walking) for 4 days (CRE), followed by a control diet (CD) for 3 days, with a caloric content similar to pre-intervention while exercise was reduced to less than 10,000 steps per day. During CRE, participants ingested either whey protein (PRO, n = 8) or sucrose (SU, n = 7) (0.8 g/kg body weight/day). Muscle biopsies were obtained from the trained and untrained deltoid, and vastus lateralis. RESULTS: Following CRE and CD, serum concentrations of leptin, insulin, and testosterone were reduced, whereas cortisol and the catabolic index (cortisol/total testosterone) increased. The Akt/mTor/p70S6K pathway and total eIF2α were unchanged, while total 4E-BP1 and Thr37/464E-BP1 were higher. After CRE, plasma BCAA and EAA were elevated, with a greater response in PRO group, and total GSK3β, pSer9GSK3β, pSer51eIF2α, and pSer51eIF2α/total eIF2α were reduced, with a greater response of pSer9GSK3β in the PRO group. The changes in signaling were associated with the changes in leptin, insulin, amino acids, cortisol, cortisol/total testosterone, and lean mass. CONCLUSIONS: During severe energy deficit, pSer9GSK3β levels are reduced and human skeletal muscle becomes refractory to the anabolic effects of whey protein ingestion, regardless of contractile activity. These effects are associated with the changes in lean mass and serum insulin, testosterone, and cortisol concentrations.",

      "abstract": "Essential amino acids (EAA) play an important role in promoting milk protein synthesis in primary bovine mammary epithelial cells (BMEC). However, the regulatory mechanisms involved in the relationship between EAA and milk protein synthesis have not been fully explored. This study examined the effects of seryl-tRNA synthetase (SARS) on EAA-stimulated β-casein synthesis, cell proliferation, and the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) system in BMEC. First, BMEC were cultured in medium either lacking all EAA (-EAA) or that included all EAA (+EAA) for 12 h. The BMEC were then supplemented with the opposing treatments (-EAA supplemented with +EAA and vice versa) for 0 h, 10 min, 0.5 h, 1 h, 6 h, or 12 h, respectively. After the treatment-specific time allotment, proteins were collected for Western blotting. Subsequently, a 2 × 2 factorial design was used to evaluate the interactive of SARS inhibition (control or SARS inhibited) and EAA supply (+EAA or -EAA) on gene and protein abundance, cell viability, and cell cycle in BMEC. Based on the data obtained in the first experiment, the changes in protein abundance of β-casein and SARS depended on EAA treatment time in similar patterns. The protein abundance of β-casein, SARS, and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)-related proteins, cell viability, cell cycle progression, and the mRNA abundance of cyclin D1 (CCND1, cell cycle progression marker) and marker of proliferation Ki-67 (MKI67, cell proliferation marker) were stimulated by the presence of EAA. Correspondingly, when cells were deprived of EAA, cell proliferation and abundance of these proteins and genes were reduced overall. Moreover, the decreases in these aspects were further exacerbated by inhibiting SARS, suggesting that an interaction between EAA and SARS is important for regulating protein synthesis. The results indicated that SARS stimulated the mTOR signaling pathway when EAA were present, enhanced EAA-stimulated cell proliferation, and contributed to increased β-casein production in BMEC.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Ready-to-use therapeutic food (RUTF) is used to treat children suffering from severe acute malnutrition (SAM). Standard RUTF uses milk as the primary protein source, which makes the product expensive, and given the high worldwide SAM burden, having a less expensive effective alternative is a public health priority. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to evaluate whether newly developed amino acid-enriched milk-free RUTF (FSMS-RUTF) or amino acid-enriched low-milk RUTF (MSMS-RUTF) treatment could replenish plasma amino acids to levels comparable to those following standard peanut-milk RUTF (PM-RUTF) treatment and to improve understanding of the effects of treatment on anthropometric measurements. A secondary analysis was performed to test the noninferiority hypothesis of plasma essential amino acid (EAA) levels. METHODS: Plasma EAA levels were measured in a nonblinded, 3-arm, parallel-group simple randomized controlled trial conducted in Malawi to examine the efficacy of FSMS-RUTF, MSMS-RUTF and PM-RUTF in the treatment of SAM in 2 groups of children aged 6-23 and 24-59 months (mo). Sample size calculations were performed based on the previous our study. A noninferiority margin was set at -25% of the PM-RUTF arm at discharge. RESULTS: The relative values of the differences (95% CI) in plasma EAA levels between PM-RUTF treatment and FSMS-RUTF and MSMS-RUTF treatments at discharge were -7.9% (-18.6, 2.8) and 9.8% (0.2, 19.5), respectively, in children aged 6-23 mo, while in those aged 24-59 mo, the difference values were 17.8% (1.6, 34.1) and 13.6% (-2.8, 29.9), respectively. CONCLUSION: At discharge, the plasma EAA concentrations in 6-59-mo-old SAM children treated with FSMS-RUTF and MSMS-RUTF were not less than those of children treated with PM-RUTF. These findings indicate that treatment with either of the 3 RUTFs was associated with adequate protein synthesis and that all the formulations provided sufficient functional metabolites of plasma amino acids to support nutritional recovery from SAM.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to determine the effect of piglet morphometric characteristics and starter regime on postnatal growth. Some piglets born light are able to grow faster than others, and identifying which piglets are more at risk to remain light and at which stages of growth is essential. A nutrient enriched starter regime may allow lightweight pigs to improve their post-weaning growth. A total 1487 newly born piglets from 137 litters originating from 8 consecutive farrowing batches were followed from birth (BiW) to weaning (WW, d28) and finishing (d99). At birth morphometric measurements were taken, including body mass index (BMI), ponderal index (PI) and BiW:cranial circumferences (BiW:CC). At weaning pigs were randomly allocated to one of two experimental regimes: either a nutrient enriched regime with a 20% higher essential amino acids (EAA): energy ratio (HIGH) or a standard regime (CTRL). Piglets were retrospectively allocated to 4 different weight classes (C) using percentiles at birth, weaning and finishing, with C1 representing the lightest and C4 the heaviest class. A series of novel statistical models were used to determine which factors were able to predict performance. RESULTS: For BiW C1 piglets, BMI (P = 0.003) and BiW relative to birth litter (P = 0.026) were positively associated with pre-weaning performance, whereas BiW:CC (P = 0.011) and WW (P = 0.001) were positively associated with post-weaning growth. Post-weaning the best predictors of piglets weaned light (WW C1) were PI (P = 0.037), BiW:CC (P < 0.001) and WW (P < 0.001). Starter regime did not influence (P > 0.05) post-weaning performance. CONCLUSION: Our results show that not all light pigs are the same and that their performance is under the influence of body shape rather than BiW. Therefore, pig producers should discriminate between light pigs based on birth characteristics to improve the effectiveness of intervention strategies at the different stages of growth. Irrespective of weight class piglets did not benefit from the EAA enriched regime applied."
