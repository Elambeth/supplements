      "abstract": "ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: The mature fruit of Schisandra chinensis, a traditional Chinese medicinal herb, is primarily utilized for the management of diabetes. Its principal bioactive constituents include lignans, polysaccharides, and organic acids. Nonetheless, a standardized quality control methodology grounded in the therapeutic efficacy of Schisandra chinensis (Turcz.) Baill. for diabetes treatment has yet to be developed. AIM OF THE STUDY: Due to the diverse origins, intricate composition, and multiple therapeutic targets of Schisandra chinensis Fructus, relying on a single index component for quality control is challenging. Consequently, this study proposes a novel quality evaluation approach, integrating pharmacological activity and intestinal microbiota analysis, to assess the efficacy of Schisandra chinensis Fructus in diabetes management. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twelve batches of Schisandra chinensis Fructus from diverse origins were selected for lignan content analysis, and 3 representative batches were subsequently chosen for pharmacological experiments pertaining to diabetes. The relationship between lignan content in Schisandra chinensis Fructus and its pharmacological efficacy was assessed by evaluating the recovery rates of eleven serum biochemical markers affected by Schisandra lignans. Furthermore, 16S rRNA gene sequencing was utilized to explore the association between the gut microbiota in diabetic rats and the lignan content in Schisandra chinensis Fructus. RESULTS: The results of serum biochemistry analyses demonstrate that Schisandra lignans significantly decrease bone gamma-carboxyglutamate protein (BGP), blood lipid levels, and oxidative stress in diabetic rats, thereby conferring hepatoprotective effects. Correlation analysis between the constituents and pharmacological effects revealed a positive relationship between the anti-diabetic efficacy of Schisandra chinensis Fructus and its total lignan content. Furthermore, Schisandra lignans were observed to enhance gut microbiota diversity in diabetic rats, mitigate the dysbiosis induced by Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM), and increase the abundance of beneficial bacterial species. CONCLUSIONS: The observed variations in the efficacy of Schisandra chinensis Fructus from different sources may be attributed to differences in total lignan content. The higher the total lignan content in Schisandra chinensis Fructus, the stronger its protective effect. Based on the analysis of component-efficacy-microbiota correlation this study has identified a chisandrin content of ≥3.5 mg/g and a total lignan content of≥17 mg/g as quality evaluation indicators for the improvement of T2DM by Schisandra chinensis Fructus."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Alcoholic liver injury (ALI) represents a major international public health concern with no targeted pharmacological intervention and a dearth of clinical trial-approved medications for its management. The dried leaves of Schisandra chinensis (SCL) are rich in flavonoids, lignans, polysaccharides, and other active ingredients with anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and antitumour activities and are commonly applied in the treatment of osteoarthritis, diabetes, and neurodegenerative diseases. The crude lignans of SCL have been reported to treat CCl4-induced acute liver injury, and SCL tea has also been reported to have hepatoprotective effects. The components of SCL are currently the focus of investigation; however, conclusive pharmacological studies on SCL in the treatment of ethanol-induced ALI are rare. PURPOSE: This study aimed to identify the bioactive components and elucidate the mechanism of action of SCL against ALI. METHODS: The optimal month for harvesting SCL was first determined using a cellular ALI model. Immediately afterwards, the efficacy of SCL was evaluated based on cellular ALI model and ALI mice model. The expression levels of NLRP3 inflammasome-associated proteins were examined via Western blotting. To identify the bioactive components of SCL, the common components in 10 batches of SCL were identified by UPLC‒Q-TOF‒MS/MS. Subsequent analysis via correlation identified common elements' pharmacological impacts, filtering for substances with notable contributions to effectiveness. Finally, potential bioactive components were further identified through molecular docking and verified in ALIcell models. RESULTS: SCL has the best efficacy in early August, and by improving hepatic aminotransferase activity, regulating lipid metabolism, alleviating oxidative stress, reducing the release of inflammatory mediators, and inhibiting the expression of NLRP3-related pyroptosis proteins, it plays a role in alleviating ALI. A total of 32 common components were identified in 10 batches of SCL. Through correlation analysis, 10 functional components, including Schisandrin B, Angeloylgomisin Q, Chlorogenic acid, Rutin, Schisandrin C, p-Hydroxycinnamic acid, Schisandrin A, Schisandrol A, Gomisin J, and Schisantherin B, were screened. Further screening using molecular docking identified 4 key functional components, Rutin, Chlorogenic acid, Schisandrin C, and Schisantherin B, which were verified to mitigate ethanol-induced liver damage. CONCLUSION: The present study demonstrated that SCL prevented ALI, with the main contributing components being rutin, chlorogenic acid, pentosidine C and pentosidine B. Hence, our latest study offers significant experimental proof indicating SCL as a promising prospect for ALI prevention."

Schisandra sphenanthera Rehd. et Wils. has attracted attention due to its hepatoprotective properties, and the underlying mechanism is unclear. In this study, a mouse model of APAP-induced liver injury was employed to evaluate network pharmacology analysis, histopathological analysis, the gut microbiota, and fecal metabolome to investigate the mechanism by which S. sphenanthera fruit extract (SFE) alleviates DILI. Network pharmacology indicated that the SFE can attenuate APAP-induced liver injury via key targets, including MAPK3 and CASP3. Furthermore, SFE effectively alleviated APAP-induced oxidative stress (MDA, SOD, and GSH) and inflammation (IL-6, TNF-α, and IL-1β). Further analysis of gut microbiota and fecal metabolites revealed that SFE promoted the growth of Bacteroidales and Erysipelotrichales, and decreased the growth of Lactobacillales, leading to increased production of tryptophan metabolites. Correlation analysis showed that the increase in gut microbiota by SFE was positively correlated with improved antioxidant ability and improved liver and gut function. In conclusion, SFE pretreatment can alleviate APAP-induced liver injury by targeting the gut-liver axis, and provides a valuable reference for the clinical use of SFE in the prevention or treatment of DILI."

      "abstract": "ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Schisandra chinensis is used as a traditional Chinese medicine to treat a variety of diseases. Schisandra chinensis lignans (SCL) are one of the most active components extracted from Schisandrae chinensis fructus, exhibit a broad array of pharmacological properties, especially anti-inflammatory and hepatic lipid-lowering effects, suggesting SCL may have potential anti-nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) ability. However, the therapeutic efficacy of SCL against NASH and the underlying mechanism of this action remains unclear. AIM OF THE STUDY: In the current study, we aimed to investigate the anti-NASH action of SCL and explore the underlying mechanism in vitro and in vivo. We also assess the involvement of the gut-liver axis in the anti-NASH effects of SCL. METHODS: Palmitic acid (PA)-treated HepG2 cells, mouse primary hepatocytes (MPHs) and methionine-choline deficient (MCD) diet-fed mice were selected as NASH models. ORO staining and qRT-PCR were performed to assess hepatic steatosis and inflammatory responses, respectively. Masson's trichrome staining was used to detect the liver fibrosis. Protein expression was detected by Western blotting or immunohistochemistry. The changes of gut microbiota were analyzed using 16S rDNA sequencing in mice. The levels of metabolites in liver and feces were measured by metabolomics. RESULTS: The results showed that SCL treatment alleviated steatosis and inflammation in palmitic acid (PA)-treated HepG2 cells and mouse primary hepatocytes (MPHs). SCL treatment suppressed the phosphorylation of key components involved in NF-κB signaling and enhanced the expression of fatty acid oxidation (FAO)-related enzymes (e.g. CPT1, HMGCS2, and ACOX1) in PA-treated HepG2 cells. SCL could ameliorate hepatic steatosis and inflammation in NASH mice. SCL also ameliorated intestinal barrier injury and restructured the gut microbiota in NASH mice. SCL also modulated hepatic and colonic bile acid metabolism via FXR signaling. CONCLUSION: These findings indicate that SCL treatment ameliorates hepatic inflammation and steatosis in NASH mice, potentially though to the suppression of NF-κB signaling and the promotion of fatty acid β-oxidation. Moreover, SCL could restore gut microbiota-mediated bile acid homeostasis via activation of FXR/FGF15 signaling. Our study presents a pharmacological rationale for using SCL in the management of NASH."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Zingiber officinale Rosc (Dry ginger) and Schisandra chinensis (Turcz.) Baill (Schisandra chinensis) drug pairs (DSP) are often used as drug pairs for the treatment of asthma, and these two traditional Chinese medicines (TCM) are also the core components of multiple TCM. However, its specific pharmacological mechanism needs further research. The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of DSP on intestinal flora and bile acid metabolism in rats with asthma caused by cold, and to provide experimental evidence for its clinical application. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixty male rats are divided into five groups, 12 rats per group. Except for control groups, other groups of rats use the method of \"abdominal injection of \"OVA + ice water swimming\" to establish cold cough rats models. After the administration cycle is over, an optical microscope count method is used to detect eosinophils (EOS) and neutrophils (Neu) in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF); Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) method detects Immunoglobulin E (IgE), Interleukin-13 (IL-13), Interleukin-4 (IL-4), Tumor Necrosis Factor-α (TNF-α), Interferon-γ (INF-γ); Western Blot (WB) and Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) analysis was used to detect Forkhead box protein P3 (Foxp3) and Transforming Growth Factor-beta 1 (TGF-β1) proteins expression. In addition, Using 16S rDNA sequencing reveal the role of intestinal flora in asthma and the effect on the gut microbiome after DSP treatment. We also examined Farnesoid X Receptor (FXR) proteins expression, and finally used ultra performance UPLC-MS/MS to analyze bile acids (BAs) contentin in rats. RESULTS: DSP inhibits asthma inflammation. It alleviates inflammatory factors, suppresses the inflammatory response in asthmatic rats by regulating FOXP3 and TGF-β1 in Treg cells, and reduces tissue damage. After DSP treatment, intestinal flora changed: harmful bacteria like Streptococcus decreased, while beneficial bacteria such as Candidatus - Arthromitus and Ligilactobacillus increased. These changes can be potential markers for DSP-intervened asthma. Also, DSP increased FXR protein expression and changed the bile acid spectrum: Deoxycholic acid (DCA) increased, allocholic acid (ACA), glycolithocholic acid (GLCA), glycochenodeoxycholic acid (GCDCA) andglycoursodeoxycholic acid (GUDCA) decreased. CONCLUSION: This study has preliminarily revealed that DSP has the effect of alleviating inflammation levels, also regulate the expression of FOXP3 and TGF-β1 proteins, and has an impact on the gut microbiota and bile acid metabolism, thereby exerting an improving effect on asthma and providing a reference for the clinical application of traditional Chinese medicine in the treatment of asthma."

      "abstract": "Schisandra chinensis (S. chinensis) polysaccharide (SCP) is an active ingredient from S. chinensis used mainly for the treatment of diabetes, owing to its antioxidant, hypoglycemic, and lipidemic-modulating activities. A rat type II diabetes mellitus model was established by giving rats a high-fat diet and streptozotocin (STZ) to investigate the protective effect of SCP against renal injury in diabetic rats. It was found in this study that fasting blood glucose, serum lipids, serum creatinine, and blood urea nitrogen levels were decreased, the insulin sensitivity was increased, and pathological injuries of the kidney were alleviated in SCP-treated groups, indicating that SCP should have a protective effect against renal injury in diabetic rats. SCP treatment reduced serum C-reactive protein and inhibited the expression of nuclear factors-κB and related inflammatory factors in the renal tissue of diabetic rats. SCP treatment also regulated the expression of Nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2) like-2, heme oxygenase-1, and kelch-like ECH-associated protein-1, reduced serum malondialdehyde content, and increased superoxide dismutase activity. Furthermore, SCP down-regulated the expression of fibronectin, α-SMA, transforming growth factor β1, and p-Smad3, up-regulated Smad7 expression, and mitigated the collagen fiber deposition in the renal interstitium in diabetic rats. It can be concluded that the mechanism of SCP in alleviating renal injury may be related to inhibiting inflammation, increasing antioxidant stress capacity, and improving renal fibrosis in diabetic rats."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUNDS: It has been regarded as an essential treatment option for diabetic nephropathy (DN) in Traditional Chinese medicine. Previous studies have demonstrated the anti-DN efficacy of Schisandra chinensis Fruit Mixture (SM); however, a comprehensive chemical fingerprint is still uncertain, and its mechanism of action, especially the potential therapeutic targets of anti-DN, needs to be further elucidated. OBJECTIVE: Potential mechanisms of SM action on DN were explored through network pharmacology and experimental validation. METHODS: The chemical composition of SM was analyzed using UPLC-ESI-MS/MS technology. Active bioactive components and potential targets of SM were identified using TCMSP, SwissDrugDesign, and SymMap platforms. Differentially expressed genes were determined using microarray gene data from the GSE30528 dataset. Related genes for DN were obtained from online databases, which include GeneCards, OMIM and DisGeNET. PPI networks and compound-target-pathway networks were constructed using Cytoscape. Functional annotation was performed using R software for GO enrichment and KEGG pathway analysis. The DN model was built for experimental validation using a high-sugar and high-fat diet combined with STZ induction. Hub targets and critical signaling pathways were detected using qPCR, Western blotting and immunofluorescence. RESULTS: Utilizing the UPLC-ESI-MS/MS coupling technique, a comprehensive analysis identified 1281 chemical components of SM's ethanol extract, with 349 of these components recognized as potential bioactive compounds through network pharmacology. Through this analysis, 126 shared targets and 15 HUB targets were pinpointed. Of these, JAK2 is regarded as the most critical gene. Enrichment analysis revealed that SM primarily operates within the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. In vivo experiments confirmed that SM improved pathological injury and renal function in rats with DN while improving mitochondrial morphology and function and modulating the expression of proteins linked to apoptosis (cleaved-caspase-3, Bax, and Bcl-2) and pro-inflammatory factors (IL-6 and TNF-α). Mechanistically, SM alleviates DN primarily by suppressing the PI3K/AKT/mTOR and JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathways to fulfill the energy needs of renal tissues. Furthermore, molecular docking analysis provided direct validation of these findings. CONCLUSION: The findings of this study offer initial indications of the active component and robust anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic characteristics of SM in the mitigation of DN, along with its capacity to safeguard the integrity and functionality of mitochondria. This research unequivocally validates the favorable anti-DN effects of SM, indicating its potential as a viable pharmaceutical agent for the management of DN.",

Baill, which is frequently used in health products and drinks, is recognized for its high content of essential oils that could have protective effects against PD, despite the lack of complete understanding of its pharmacological mechanisms. This research aims to examine how ESC can affect autophagy signaling pathways and activate the Nrf2/HO-1 pathway to effectively decrease oxidative damage, thus shedding light on the possible anti-PD effects of this treatment. The results demonstrated that ESC significantly reduced behavioral issues linked to Parkinson's disease in a mouse model that was induced by MPTP and safeguarded dopaminergic neurons that expressed tyrosine hydroxylase. Moreover, ESC boosted the antioxidant capability of Nrf2, assisted with autophagy processes, and finally decreased protein expression levels of Keap1, HO-1, MAPK, mTOR, and ERK. According to in vitro studies, ESC treatment had a significant reduction in H2O2-induced cytotoxicity and oxidative stress levels, which suggests that Nrf2 targets ESC after treatment. The activation of both autophagy and Nrf2 antioxidant pathways was assessed using western blotting. In conclusion, ESC exhibits the potential to suppress oxidative stress by activating Nrf2 in response to autophagy, which is positioned as a promising pharmaceutical candidate, especially for the management and treatment of PD and related disorders.",

The aim of this study was to elucidate the effects of Schisandra rubriflora (S. rubriflora) on PCOS and its related mechanisms using network pharmacology, molecular docking and in vitro experiments. MATERIALS AND METHODS: HERB database and SwissTargetPrediction database were used to obtain the active components and the targets of S. rubriflora. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) associated with PCOS were obtained by analyzing GSE54248 dataset. A protein-protein interaction network was constructed, and topological analyses were performed to identify the hub targets and main bioactive components. The binding abilities between hub targets and key components were studied by molecular docking. Finally, in vitro PCOS models were constructed with KGN cells and rat ovarian granulosa cells, respectively, and the regulatory effects of schisandrin, a key bioactive component of S. rubriflora, on the cells were investigated by in vitro assays. RESULTS: A total of 14 bioactive ingredients of S. rubriflora and 26 potential therapeutic targets of S. rubriflora in PCOS treatment were obtained. Bioinformatics analyses suggested that the mechanisms of S. rubriflora in treating PCOS were related to IL-17 signaling pathway and TNF signaling pathway. The binding affinities between key components of S. rubriflora (schisandrin, wyerone, and rugosal) and hub targets (PTGS2, MMP9, MCL1, and JUN) were high. Schisandrin could attenuate lipopolysaccharide-induced inflammation, oxidative stress, and apoptosis of KGN cells and rat ovarian granulosa cells, as well as inhibit hub target expression and TNF pathway activation. CONCLUSION: PTGS2, MMP9, MCL1 and JUN are potential targets for S. rubriflora to treat PCOS. Schisandrin, a main component of S. rubriflora, may be a candidate for the treatment of PCOS.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Ginseng-Schisandra chinensis (GSC) decoction has shown good efficacy in the treatment of asthma (AS), but its t mechanism in the treatment of asthma is still not fully understood. PURPOSE: This study aims to elucidate the therapeutic mechanism of GSC for AS by identifying the active components of GSC. METHODS: The chemical composition of GSC was analyzed using UHPLC-MS/MS. The network pharmacology method combined with TCMSP and GeneCards database was used to identify potential targets and enriched pathways related to AS treatment. Use AutoDock for molecular docking to evaluate the binding affinity of active ingredients to core targets. Finally, the LPS-induced A549 cell inflammation model was used to evaluate the effect of GSC on the release of inflammatory cytokines. RESULTS: The main components in GSC, including ginsenosides (Rf, Rd, Rg2, Ro, Rg5, Rh1) and lignans (schisandrin A, B, schisandrol A, B, schisandrin ester A) were identified. Network analysis revealed 139 intersection targets and highlighted STAT3, TNF, EGFR, IL1B, and AKT1 as key targets, with the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway as the main pathway. Experimental results showed that GSC significantly reduced the levels of IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α in LPS-induced A549 cells (p < 0.01), indicating its powerful anti-inflammatory effect. CONCLUSION: GSC plays a role in treating asthma by targeting STAT3, TNF, IL-1β and AKT1, regulating the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway and inhibiting the release of inflammatory cytokines. These findings provide a basis for the clinical application of GSC.",

      "abstract": "ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Schisandra chinensis (Turcz.) Baill (S. chinensis), first recorded in Shennong's Classic of the Materia Medica, is described as a \"top grade medicine\". As a traditional Chinese medicine of tonifying the kidneys and the brain, S. chinensis is widely used to treat diseases such as amnesia and dementia. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease, and ferroptosis is one of the essential causes of AD. Although previous studies have suggested that the lignans of S. chinensis (SCL) have neuroprotective effects, it is unclear whether SCL can alleviate AD pathology by inhibiting ferroptosis. AIM OF THE STUDY: To investigate the effect of SCL on AD caused by ferroptosis and its possible molecular mechanism. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study was based on SAMR1/SAMP8 mouse models along with Erastin-induced HT22 cell lines to examine the influence of SCL on ferroptosis in AD. The S. chinensis was extracted via 75% EtOH-H2O and identified by HPLC/UPLC-QTOF-MS. MWM assessed spatial learning, while HE staining, biochemical detection, IHC, and WB analyzed AD pathology and iron metabolism. Mitochondrial changes were evaluated by TEM, and confocal imaging post-SCL treatment analyzed ROS, MMP, and Fe2+ levels in HT22 cells. IF determined the expression levels and localization of Nrf2 and FPN1. CETSA was deployed to study the interaction between SCL and Nrf2. RESULTS: Treatment with SCL mitigated cognitive dysfunction and reduced p-Tau as well as neuronal loss in AD model mice. Additionally, the administration of SCL alleviated oxidative stress and maintained relatively intact mitochondrial ridges and membranes, decreased TFR and DMT1 protein expression, and upregulated FTH1. Consistent with the in vivo results, SCL inhibited Erastin-induced ferroptosis in HT22 cells. SCL promoted Nrf2 nuclear translocation and upregulated FPN1, SLC7A11, and GPX4 protein expressions while decreasing FACL4. The improvement of ferroptosis by SCL was associated with the regulation of the Nrf2/FPN1 signaling pathway. CONCLUSION: The novel discoveries of this study suggest that SCL can suppress ferroptosis in the brains of AD model mice and exerts a partial protective effect against Erastin-induced ferroptosis in HT22 cells, in which the Nrf2/FPN1 signaling pathway plays a crucial role.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Huntington disease (HD), a neurodegenerative autosomal dominant disorder, is characterized by involuntary choreatic movements with cognitive and behavioral disturbances. Up to now, no therapeutic strategies are available to completely ameliorate the progression of HD. Schisandra chinensis has various pharmacologic effects such as antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities. However, the neuroprotective value of seed oil of S. chinensis (SOSC) has not been elucidated yet. The purpose of this study was to determine neuroprotective effects of SOSC by supercritical fluid extraction against 3-nitropropionic acid (3-NPA)-induced HD-like symptoms and neuropathology in an experimental mouse model. METHODS: SOSC (75, 150, and 300 mg/kg/day) was orally pre-administration once daily at 1 hour before 3-NPA intoxication. RESULTS: SOSC ameliorated movement dysfunction and lethality following 3-NPA intoxication in connection with reduction of lesion area, neurodegeneration/apoptosis, microglial migration/activation, and mRNA expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines/enzymes in the striatum. SOSC inhibited the activation of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPKs) pathways but stimulated nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) in the striatum after 3-NPA intoxication. Schizandrin, a main component of SOSC, reduced protein expression levels of Iba-1 and p-NF-κB in 3-NPA-induced BV2 cells (murine microglia cell line). BV2 cell's conditioned medium inhibited cleaved caspase-3 in 3-NPA-induced SH-SY5Y cells (a neuroblastoma cell line). CONCLUSION: SOSC might ameliorate movement dysfunction by inhibiting neuropathology through its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities in the striata of 3-NPA-intoxicated mice. These findings suggest that SOSC could serve as a promising therapeutic candidate for HD-like symptoms, providing a foundation for future treatment strategies targeting neuroinflammation and oxidative stress."

Baill (SC) has anti-type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) effects, and its processed products are commonly used in clinical practice. However, limited reports exist on the mechanisms of polysaccharides from its vinegar products and their role in T2DM. We purified a novel polysaccharide from vinegar-processed Schisandra chinensis (VSC) and used intestinal microbiota 16S rRNA analysis and metabolomics to study changes in T2DM mice after vinegar-processed Schisandra chinensis polysaccharide (VSP) intervention, aiming to elucidate how VSP alleviates T2DM. VSP has shown significant therapeutic effects in T2DM mice, which can regulate the imbalance of glucose and lipid metabolism, alleviate pancreatic and liver damage, restore the integrity of the intestinal barrier, and inhibit the inflammatory response. Serum metabolomics and microbiological analysis showed that VSP could significantly regulate 104 endogenous metabolites and rectify gut microbiota disorders in T2DM mice. Additionally, VSP enhanced the levels of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and the expression of GPR41/43 in the colon of T2DM mice. Correlation analysis revealed significant correlations among specific gut microbiota, serum metabolites, and fecal SCFAs. Overall, these findings will provide a basis for further VSP development.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Schisandra chinensis (Turcz.) Baill (S. chinensis), a member of the Magnoliaceae family, is renowned for its distinctive medicinal attributes and is commonly employed in the treatment of disorders affecting the CNS. PURPOSE: The potential therapeutic effects of a lignan-enriched extract derived from Schisandra chinensis (Turcz.) Baill (LSC) on PD is assessed, which focuses on its mechanisms of action in addressing neuroinflammation. METHODS: The LSC has been obtained by purifying the ethyl alcohol extract of S. chinensis. The Orbitrap-MS method has been employed to analyze the chemical composition of the LSC. In LPS-induced BV2 cells, LSC-induced changes in M1/M2 type inflammatory cytokines have been examined using the Griess reaction, Elisa, JC-1, flow cytometry, IF, and WB methods. A model of PD has been established by treatment of MPTP in C57BL/6 mice. The effect of LSC on behavioral changes, inflammatory factor levels, expression of TH and IBA-1, and production of autophagy in the midbrain has been investigated by TEM, immunohistochemistry, Elisa, and WB. RESULTS: LSC has relieved sports injuries and pathological damage, and targeted the TRPV1-AMPK-NLRP3 signaling pathway, which affected neuroinflammation and autophagy in vivo. Furthermore, in vitro investigations demonstrated that LSC has activated M1/M2 transformation, its related inflammatory factors, and protein expressions of the NLRP3-Caspase1 signaling pathway in LPS-BV2 cells. The research notably demonstrated that the LSC promoted autophagy and suppressed inflammation through targeting TRPV1. CONCLUSION: In the investigation, LSC focused on TRPV1 and controlled neuroinflammation-autophagy by regulating AMPK-NLRP3, which has been proven for the first time. The study has presented molecular data supporting the use of LSC in treating PD and offers references for developing drugs. Remarkably, LSC has the potential to be utilized as a therapeutic or health medication that could significantly decrease PD.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Ulcerative colitis (UC) is an inflammatory bowel disease characterized by its incurable nature and undefined etiology, which is often accompanied by a high prevalence of comorbid depression. The gut-brain axis has emerged as a promising treatment target in recent years. PURPOSE: This study aimed to investigate how vinegar-processed Schisandra Chinensis (VSC) enhances therapeutic effects on depressive behavior in chronic UC mice. METHODS: A chronic UC model was induced in mice using dextran sulfate sodium. The therapeutic effects of both raw and vinegar-processed Schisandra Chinensis on UC and associated depressive symptoms were assessed. Colonic mucosal damage was evaluated using hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and Alcian blue staining. The integrity of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and synaptic structures was visualized via transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was employed to quantify inflammatory cytokine levels in the colon, serum, and brain, while western blotting was performed for protein expression analysis. Additionally, metagenomic analysis was conducted to investigate gut microbiota composition. Nissl staining and immunofluorescence were used to assess hippocampal neuronal damage, and behavioral assessments including the morris water maze, open field test, forced swimming test and tail suspension test, were implemented to evaluate depressive states. Serum metabolites were analyzed using UPLC-MS/MS. RESULTS: Both raw and vinegar-processed Schisandra Chinensis significantly upregulated aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), inhibited NF-κB p-p65 activation, and reduced levels of pro-inflammatory cytokine. These treatments also enhanced the expression of tight junction proteins, restored colonic mucosal and BBB integrity, alleviated damage to hippocampal neurons, and improved synaptic structure. Behavioral assessments indicated that VSC was particularly effective in ameliorating depressive-like behaviors in chronic UC mice. In the gut, both treatments reshaped the gut microbial composition, restoring the relative abundance of Duncaniella, Candidatus_Amulumruptor, Alistipes, Parabacteroides, Lachnospiraceae_bacterium, uncultured_Bacteroides_sp., Candidatus_Amulumruptor_caecigallinarius, with VSC showing more pronounced effects. Serum metabolomics revealed an increase in tryptophan levels and a decrease in kynurenine and xanthurenic acid levels with VSC, indicating that tryptophan metabolism shifted from the kynurenine pathway to the 5-HT or indole pathway. However, this phenomenon did not occur with Schisandra Chinensis (SC). CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that the disruption of tryptophan metabolic balance served as a biological mechanism underlying the occurrence of depressive behaviors induced by UC. The application of SC following vinegar processing enhanced its regulatory effects on gut microbiota and tryptophan metabolism. This findings provided a new insight for the clinical management of gut-brain comorbidities.",

      "abstract": "ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Schisandra chinensis (Turcz.) Baill., a common traditional Chinese herbal medicine, has been used for the treatment of diabetes mellitus and its complications. However, the major active component for treating diabetic foot ulcers, a serious complication of diabetes mellitus, was unclear. This study aimed to predict the treatment effect of the active components in Schisandra chinensis against diabetic skin wound using network pharmacology and to confirm the underlying mechanism using a diabetic skin wound model in vivo. AIM OF THE STUDY: To study the effects and underlying mechanisms of Schisandra chinensis and its main component Gomisin A on diabetic skin wound healing by network pharmacology and high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obese mice model in vivo. MATERIALS AND METHODS: To determine the effectiveness of Schisandra chinensis on diabetic skin wound, network pharmacology was first used. Components of Schisandra chinensis were obtained from the Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology database. The active components were further verified through absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion. The potential targets of the active components were identified from the Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology, SwissTargetPrediction, TargetNet, and the Comparative Toxicogenomics Database. Targets related to diabetic skin wound were collected from the GeneCards, OMIM, DisGeNET, and PharmGKB databases. The interaction network formed by the intersection of the two datasets was analyzed using Gephi. Network-based proximity was used to predict the network distance between the active components of Schisandra chinensis and diabetic skin wound. Gomisin A was found to have the lowest Z-score and was administered either orally or via topical injection to HFD-induced obese mice daily until the wounds healed, and its effects on skin wound healing were evaluated. RESULTS: Only five active ingredients of Schisandra chinensis were screened in our system: Gomisin A, Longikaurin A, Deoxyharringtonine, Wuweizisu C, and Interiotherin B, which can regulate biological processes related to diabetic skin wound, including positive regulation of phosphorous metabolic process, positive regulation of cell migration, and response to wounding. Network proximity analysis found that Gomisin A has the closest distance-based Z-score among the diabetic skin wound modules and drug targets in the human protein-protein interaction network. The HFD-induced obese mice model further revealed that Gomisin A accelerated skin wound healing by increasing insulin sensitivity and decreasing the advanced glycation end-products mediated toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)-p38 MAPK-IL6 inflammation signaling pathway. CONCLUSIONS: The network pharmacology and in vivo studies indicated that Gomisin A from Schisandra chinensis played a crucial role in improving diabetic skin wound healing.",

      "abstract": "Schisandra chinensis, a traditional Chinese medicine, has been widely applied in China to treat diabetes and its complications. The aim of this study was to discover the active compounds and explain related molecular mechanism contributing to the anti-diabetic effect of Schisandra chinensis. Herein, the therapeutic effects of Schisandra chinensis extracts on type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) were firstly confirmed in vivo. Subsequently, various lignans were isolated from Schisandra chinensis and tested for hypoglycemic activity in palmitic acid-induced insulin-resistant HepG2 (IR-HepG2) cells. Among these lignans, R-biar-(7S,8R)-6,7,8,9-tetrahydro-1,2,3,12,13,14-hexamethoxy-7,8-dimethyl-7-dibenzo [a, c] cyclooctenol (compound 2) and Gomisin A (compound 4) were identified significantly increased the glucose consumption in IR-HepG2 cells. Meanwhile, compounds 2 and 4 activated the insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1)/phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Ak strain transforming (AKT) pathway, which regulates glucose transporter 2 (GLUT2) and glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase), essential for gluconeogenesis and glucose uptake. These compounds also inhibited the nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) signaling pathway, reducing interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels. Importantly, the hypoglycemic effects of compounds 2 and 4 were diminished after Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) knockdown. Cellular thermal shift assays confirmed increased TLR4 protein stability upon treatment with these compounds, indicating direct binding to TLR4. Furthermore, TLR4 knockdown reversed the effects of compounds 2 and 4 on the NF-κB and IRS-1/PI3K/AKT pathways. Taken together, compounds 2 and 4 alleviate IR by targeting TLR4, thereby modulating the NF-κB and IRS-1/PI3K/AKT pathways. These findings suggest that compounds 2 and 4 could be developed as therapeutic agents for T2DM.",

      "abstract": "The purified neutral polysaccharide fraction, namely SBP-1, was isolated and characterized from Schisandra chinensis (Turcz.) Baill crude polysaccharides, which have anti-Parkinson's disease activity were investigated in vivo and in vitro. Experiments have shown that the main chain of SBP-1 was Glcp-(1→, →4)-Glcp-(1→ and →4,6)-Glcp-(1→. We also revealed the effect of SBP-1 on the PD mice model and the potential underlying molecular mechanism. The results showed that SBP-1 administration improved behavioral deficits, increased tyrosine hydroxylase-positive cells, attenuated loss of dopaminergic neurons in MPTP-exposed mice, and reduced cell death induced by MPP+. The MCL-1 was identified as the target of SBP-1 by the combination of docking-SPR-ITC, WB, and IF experiments. Subsequently, the study showed that SBP-1 could target MCL-1 to enhance autophagy with a change in the apoptotic response, which was further demonstrated by a change in LC3/P62, PI3K/AKT/mTOR, and possesses a change in the expression of BCL2/BAX/Caspase3. These results demonstrate that SBP-1 may protect neurons against MPP+ or MPTP-induced damage in vitro and in vivo through enhancing autophagy. In summary, these findings indicate that SBP-1 and S. chinensis show potential as effective candidates for further investigation in the prevention and treatment of PD or associated illnesses, specifically through autophagy apoptotic-based mechanisms.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Schisandra chinensis lignan (SCL), a major active component of the traditional functional Chinese medicine Schisandra chinensis, has been reported to have antidepressant effects. Its mechanisms include alleviating intestinal barrier injury (IBI) by resolving intestinal microflora, anti-inflammation, and neuroprotection. SCL also regulates endogenous cannabinoid system, and it is closely related to the onset and development of depression. PURPOSE: We investigated a new treatment strategy for depression, i.e., alleviating IBI by regulating the endogenous cannabinoid system for antidepressant effects, as well as conducted in-depth research to explore the specific mechanism. METHODS: Behavioral analysis was conducted to detect the occurrence of depressive-like behavior in C57BL/6 mice. We used hematoxylin-eosin staining, periodic acid-Schiff staining, and immunofluorescence to evaluate IBI. Network pharmacology and Western blotting (WB) were used to predict and confirm that the amelioration effect of SCL was associated with anti-inflammation and anti-apoptosis. Combined with the levels of anandamide (AEA) and 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG), we conducted the Pearson analysis between the AEA, 2-AG levels and the major targets identified and validated by network pharmacology and WB. Subsequently, URB-597, a fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) antagonist with an AEA hydrolase-inhibiting effect, was administered to the mice, and behavioral analysis and apoptotic proteins were verified. Plasma endocannabinoid levels after URB-597 supplementation were measured via 6470 Triple Quadrupole LC/MS. Finally, the cannabinoid receptor type 2 (CB2R) antagonist AM630 was administered to mice, and immunofluorescence and WB were performed to assess the proteins of IBI and anti-inflammation. RESULTS: The study demonstrated that SCL alleviated depressive-like behaviours and ameliorated IBI. Network pharmacology and WB confirmed that the improvement of IBI was related to the anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic pathways. Pearson results showed that AEA levels were positively correlated with inflammation and apoptosis, with a greater contribution to apoptosis. In-depth studies validated that the URB-597 administration reversed the positive effects of SCL on depressive-like behavior and anti-apoptosis. Similarly, URB-597 counteracted AEA levels reduced by SCL and decreased 2-AG levels. Furthermore, AM630 supplementation antagonized SCL's effect of improving IBI by reactivating the MAPK/NF-κB inflammation pathway. CONCLUSION: Overall, SCL, in collaboration with the endogenous cannabinoid system regulated by SCL, alleviates depression associated IBI. The specific mechanism involes SCL decreasing AEA levels to inhibit colon tissue cell apoptosis by up-regulating FAAH. Simultaneously, it directly triggers CB2R to reduce inflammation responses, further alleviating IBI.",

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: This study aimed to investigated the key chemical components and the effect of the aqueous extract of Schisandra sphenanthera (SSAE) on alcoholic liver disease (ALD) and the related molecular mechanism. METHODS: This study employed UPLC-Q-TOF-MS/MS to identify the chemical compositions in SSAE. ALD rat model was established through oral administration of white spirit. Transcriptome sequencing, weighted gene co-expression network construction analysis (WGCNA), and network pharmacology were used to predict key compositions and pathways targeted by SSAE for the treatment of ALD. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), biochemical kits, hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining, Western blotting (WB) analysis, and immunohistochemical analysis were used to validate the mechanism of action of SSAE in treating ALD. RESULTS: Active ingredients such as schisandrin A, schisandrol A, and schisandrol B were found to regulate the PI3K/AKT/IKK signaling pathway. Compared to the model group, the SSAE group demonstrated significant improvements in cellular solidification and tissue inflammation in the liver tissues of ALD model rats. Additionally, SSAE regulated the levels of a spartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH), and aldehyde Dehydrogenase (ALDH) in serum (P < 0.05); Western blotting and immunohistochemical analyses showed that the expression levels of phosphorylated PI3K, AKT, IKK, NFκB, and FOXO1 proteins were significantly reduced in liver tissues (P < 0.05), whereas the expression level of Bcl-2 proteins was significantly increased (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The active components of SSAE were schisandrin A, schisandrol A, and schisandrol B, which regulated the phosphorylation levels of PI3K, AKT, IKK, and NFκB and the expression of FOXO1 protein and upregulated the expression of Bcl-2 protein in the liver tissues of ALD rats. These findings indicate that SSAE acts against ALD partly through the PI3K-AKT-IKK signaling pathway. This study provided a reference for future research and treatment of ALD and the development of novel natural hepatoprotective drugs."

Schisandra chinensis (SC), a common Chinese medicine, has demonstrated numerous beneficial effects in treating neuropsychological disorders. The main objective of this study was to identify potential bioactive components of SC and investigate their interactions with relevant target genes associated with NP/DD. To gain insights into the underlying molecular mechanisms, GO and KEGG analyses were conducted. Furthermore, molecular docking analysis was employed to validate the therapeutic relevance of SC's active ingredients. Seven bioactive components of SC, namely Longikaurin A, Deoxyharringtonine, Angeloylgomisin O, Schisandrin B, Gomisin A, Gomisin G, and Gomisin R, exhibited effectiveness in the treatment of NP/DD. From this list, the first five components were selected for further analysis. The analyses revealed a complex network of interactions between the targets of SC and NP/DD, providing valuable information about the molecular mechanisms involved in the treatment of NP/DD with SC. SC components demonstrated the ability to regulate pathways involving tumor necrosis factor (TNF), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and other growth hormones (GH). Overall, this study contributes to our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the effects of SC in treating NP/DD. Further investigation is necessary to explore the therapeutic potential of SC as a viable strategy for NP/DD comorbidity. These findings lay a solid foundation for future research endeavors in this field, holding potential implications for the development of novel therapeutic interventions targeting NP/DD.",

Studies have shown that the combination of two botanical drugs enhanced the effects of treating acute liver injury (ALI), but the synergistic effect and its action mechanisms remain unclear. This study aimed to investigate the synergistic effect and its mechanism of the combination of Pueraria montana var. lobata (Willd.) Maesen & S.M.Almeida ex Sanjappa & Predeep (syn. Pueraria lobata (Willd.) Ohwi) (PM) and Schisandra sphenanthera Rehder & E.H. Wilson (SS) in the treatment of ALI. METHODS: High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) were utilized to conduct the chemical interaction analysis. Then the synergistic effects of botanical hybrid preparation of PM-SS (BHP PM-SS) against ALI were comprehensively evaluated by the CCl4 induced ALI mice model. Afterwards, symptom-oriented network pharmacology, transcriptomics and metabolomics were applied to reveal the underlying mechanism of action. Finally, the key target genes were experimentally by RT-qPCR. RESULTS: Chemical analysis and pharmacodynamic experiments revealed that BHP PM-SS was superior to the single botanical drug, especially at 2:3 ratio, with a better dissolution rate of active ingredients and synergistic anti-ALI effect. Integrated symptom-oriented network pharmacology combined with transcriptomics and metabolomics analyses showed that the active ingredients of BHP PM-SS could regulate Glutathione metabolism, Pyrimidine metabolism, Arginine biosynthesis and Amino acid sugar and nucleotide sugar metabolism, by acting on the targets of AKT1, TNF, EGFR, JUN, HSP90AA1 and STAT3, which could be responsible for the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway, MAPK signaling pathway and Pathway in cancer to against ALI. CONCLUSION: Our study has provided compelling evidence for the synergistic effect and its mechanism of the combination of BHP PM-SS, and has contributed to the development and utilization of BHP PM-SS dietary supplements."

As a medicinal plant source, Schisandra chinensis bee pollen (SCBP) possesses potential pharmacological properties, such as reducing cisplatin-induced liver injury, but its anti-liver cancer effect is still rarely reported. This paper aims to investigate the effect and mechanism of SCBP extract (SCBPE) on hepatocellular carcinoma HepG2 cells. METHODS: The effect of SCBPE on cell proliferation and migration of HepG2 cells was evaluated based on MTT assay, morphology observation, or scratching assay. Furthermore, tandem mass tag-based quantitative proteomics was used to study the effect mechanisms. The mRNA expression levels of identified proteins were verified by RT-qPCR. RESULTS: Tandem mass tag-based quantitative proteomics showed that 61 differentially expressed proteins were obtained in the SCBPE group compared with the negative-control group: 18 significantly downregulated and 43 significantly upregulated proteins. Bioinformatic analysis showed the significantly enriched KEGG pathways were predominantly ferroptosis-, Wnt-, and hepatocellular carcinoma-signaling ones. Protein-protein interaction network analysis and RT-qPCR validation revealed SCBPE also downregulated the focal adhesion-signaling pathway, which is abrogated by PF-562271, a well-known inhibitor of FAK. CONCLUSION: This study confirmed SCBPE suppressed the cell proliferation and migration of hepatocellular carcinoma HepG2 cells, mainly through modulation of ferroptosis-, Wnt-, hepatocellular carcinoma-, and focal adhesion-signaling pathways, providing scientific data supporting adjuvant treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma using SCBP.",

      "abstract": "ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Acetaminophen (APAP) induced liver injury (AILI) is a common cause of clinical hepatic damage and even acute liver failure. Our previous research has shown that Schisandra chinensis lignan extract (SLE) can exert a hepatoprotective effect by regulating lipid metabolism. Although polysaccharides from Schisandra chinensis (S. chinensis), like lignans, are important components of S. chinensis, their pharmacological activity and target effects on AILI have not yet been explored. AIM OF THE STUDY: This study aims to quantitatively reveal the role of SCP in the pharmacological activity of S. chinensis, and further explore the pharmacological components, potential action targets and mechanisms of S. chinensis in treating AILI. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The therapeutic effect of SCP on AILI was systematically determined via comparing the efficacy of SCP and SLE on in vitro and in vivo models. Network pharmacology, molecular docking and multi-omics techniques were then used to screen and verify the action targets of S. chinensis against AILI. RESULTS: SCP intervention could significantly improve AILI, and the therapeutic effect was comparable to that of SLE. Notably, the combination of SCP and SLE did not produce mutual antagonistic effects. Subsequently, we found that both SCP and SLE could significantly reverse the down-regulation of GPX4 caused by the APAP modeling, and then further improving lipid metabolism abnormalities. CONCLUSIONS: Hepatoprotective effects of SCP and SLE is most correlated with their regulation of GSH/GPX4-mediated lipid accumulation. This is the first exploration of the hepatoprotective effect and potential mechanism of SCP in treating AILI, which is crucial for fully utilizing S. chinensis and developing promising AILI therapeutic agents.",

The contents of main active components lignans and organic acids were simultaneously determined by ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled to quadrupole electrostatic field orbitrap high resolution mass spectrometry (UPLC Orbitrap HRMS). The antioxidant activity was determined using DPPH radical scavenging capacity, ABTS+ inhibition rate and FRAP value. The correlation of multicomponent and antioxidant activity was analyzed by grey relevance analysis. Taking the changes of multicomponent and antioxidant activity as investigation index, Schisandra chinensis fruits under different storage conditions was comprehensively evaluated. Schisandrol A, malic acid, sorbic acid, schizandrin A, schizandrin B, and schisandrol B were the main effective components of antioxidant activity. Ambient temperature at 5 °C and humidity at 40 % were more suitable for Schisandra chinensis fruits and kraft paper bag was better packaging material. Do not exceed 1 year was the effective storage period. For the safety evaluation, no aflatoxin was detected within the storage period of 2 years, demonstrated the storage was satisfactory.

However, the precise mechanism of their therapeutic effects remains to be fully elucidated. In this study, air flow-assisted desorption electrospray ionization mass spectrometry imaging (AFADESI-MSI) and network pharmacology are used to investigate the pharmacodynamics and mechanism underlying the herbal combination consisting of Radix ginseng-Schisandra chinensis (RS) in a rodent model for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Brain histopathological findings suggested that RS attenuates hippocampal damage in AD mice, making this combination a potential AD treatment. Twenty-eight biomarkers were identified by spatial metabolomics analysis, which are intricately linked to neuroinflammation, neurotransmitter imbalance, energy deficiency, oxidative stress, and aberrant fatty acid metabolism in AD. The total extract of RS (TE) affected 22 of these biomarkers, with the small molecule components of RS (SN) significantly influencing 19 and the large molecule components of RS (PR) impacting 14. Nine small molecule components are likely to dominate the pharmacodynamics of RS. We constructed a target interaction network based on the corresponding bioactivities that revealed relationships amongst 11 key biomarkers, 8 active ingredients and 12 critical targets.

Expression levels of CCL20, p-ERK1/2, c-Myc, Vimentin, and E-cadherin/N-cadherin were analyzed by real-time PCR and Western blot. Tumor volume was calculated with a specific formula, and growth. RESULTS: The Schisandra chinensis lignans and acteoside combination decreased CCL20 expression, inhibited hepatoma proliferation and migration, and enhanced apoptosis in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Molecular analysis revealed increased E-cadherin and decreased N-cadherin, p-ERK1/2, c-Myc, and Vimentin expression, indicating ERK1/2 pathway modulation. In vivo, treated nude mice showed significantly reduced tumor growth and volume. CONCLUSION: Schisandra chinensis lignans and acteoside potentially counteract CCL20-induced EMT, invasion, and migration in hepatocellular carcinoma cells via the ERK1/2 pathway, enhancing apoptosis. Multi-omics analysis further aids in pinpointing novel biomarkers for precision cancer therapy.",

      "abstract": "ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Schisandra sphenanthera (Schisandra sphenanthera Rehd. et Wils.) is the dried mature fruit of Schisandra sphenanthera, a plant in the Magnoliaceae family. It was used in the treatment of diabetes mellitus in the Jade Fluid Decoction and the Xiaoke pills, which were recorded in ancient books. However, its mechanism of action in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) was unclear and needs further study. AIM OF THE STUDY: This research aimed to investigate the chemical composition and lignan content of Schisandra sphenanthera petroleum ether parts (SPEP) and to evaluate the effects of SPEP on sweet taste receptors (STRs) and intestinal flora in rats on a high-fat diet (HFD). Additionally, the relationships between SPEP and hyperglycemia and insulin resistance were examined. MATERIALS AND METHODS: GC-MS was used to determine the chemical composition of SPEP, and HPLC was used to determine the lignin content. A combination of the HFD and the administration of streptozotocin (STZ) was employed to generate a rat model of T2DM. Petroleum ether extracts from Schisandra sphenanthera were used as the focus of the research to evaluate the effects of these extracts on the glucolipid metabolism of T2DM rats, as well as the underlying mechanisms. RESULTS: Analysis of the GC-MS spectrum of SESP revealed a total of 58 compounds. HPLC analysis revealed that SPEP had the highest concentration of Schisandrin A and the lowest concentration of Schisandrol A. The drug administration intervention resulted in a significant decrease in body weight and pancreatic weight of diabetic rats compared to the Normal group. When compared to the Model group, the body weight of rats in the drug administration group and the Metformin group had a more moderate decrease, while the pancreatic weight and pancreatic-to-body ratio increased. The Model group shown significant increases in FBG, OGTT, GHb, TC, TG, LDL-C, ALT, AST, MDA, FINS, and NEFA, as well as significant decreases in HDL-C and SOD, when compared to the Normal group (P < 0.05). The administration of each group was found to be significantly effective in decreasing FBG, OGTT, GHb, TC, TG, LDL-C, ALT, AST, MDA, FINS, NEFA, while increasing HDL-C and SOD when compared to the Model group. The application of SPEP had a positive impact on hepatocyte swelling, hepatocyte degeneration, and necrosis, as well as the morphological structure of pancreatic islet cells. Furthermore, the protein expression levels of T1R2, TRPM5 and GLP-1 in the small intestine of the Model group were reduced. After a period of six weeks, the protein expression levels began to align more closely with those of the Normal group of rats. Analysis of 16S rRNA sequencing revealed that the intestinal microbiota of diabetic rats was significantly disrupted, with a decrease in the abundance of the Firmicutes phylum and an increase in the abundance of the Bacteroidetes phylum. Furthermore, the composition of the dominant genus was distinct from that of the control group. After the drug intervention, the microbiota of diabetic rats was significantly altered, exhibiting a higher abundance and diversity, as well as a significant enrichment of the community. The SPEP treatment resulted in a significant increase in acetic acid, propionic acid, and butyric acid. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this research indicated that SPEP could be effective in treating T2DM through the regulation of STRs, the adjustment of disturbed metabolite levels, and the alteration of intestinal flora.",

Pharmacodynamic assessments included Morris water maze test, hematoxylin-eosin staining and immunohistochemistry experiments. The results of the study showed that the AD model was successful; the S-E significantly enhanced long-term memory and spatial learning in AD rats. Meanwhile, S-E notably ameliorated Aβ25-35-induced cognitive impairment, improved hippocampal neuron morphology, decreased Aβ deposition in the hippocampus and mitigated inflammatory damage. We then analyzed serum and urine samples using UPLC-MS/MS to identify potential biomarkers and metabolic pathways. Metabolomic analysis revealed alterations in 40 serum metabolites and 38 urine metabolites following S-E treatment, predominantly affecting pathways related to taurine and hypotaurine metabolism, linoleic acid metabolism, α-linolenic acid metabolism, glycerophospholipid metabolism and arachidonic acid metabolism. This study elucidates the biochemical mechanism underlying AD and the metabolic pathway influenced by S-E, laying the groundwork for future clinical applications.",

We hypothesized that a combined extract containing Schisandra chinensis (SCE) could alleviate hepatic lipid accumulation. Male Sprague-Dawley rats fed a high-sucrose diet (HSD) were randomly assigned to three groups (n = 6): normal diet (ND), HSD (60% kcal from sucrose), and HSD + SCE (HSD with 2.44% SCE). Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry revealed that SCE contains chlorogenic acid (5.514 ± 0.009 mg/g) and schisandrin (0.179 ± 0.002 mg/g) as bioactive components. SCE did not alter the body weight, fat mass, lean mass, or glucose levels. Strikingly, SCE effectively reduced the plasma triglyceride (TG) and hepatic TG levels compared to the HSD group. Adiposity reduction is due to decreased activity of hepatic de novo lipogenic enzymes. These results indicated that SCE has nutraceutical potential for the prevention and treatment of hepatic steatosis.

Its polysaccharide component has been gaining increased attention for its potential in nerve protection. While raw SC is the primary focus of current research, its processed products are primarily utilized as clinical medicines. Notably, limited research exists on the mechanisms underlying the effects of wine-processed Schisandra chinensis polysaccharide (WSCP) in Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Therefore, this study seeks to assess the therapeutic impact of WSCP on AD mice and investigate the underlying mechanisms through biochemical and metabolomics analyses. The results demonstrate that WSCP exerts significant therapeutic effects on AD mice by enhancing learning and memory abilities, mitigating hippocampal neuronal damage, reducing abnormal amyloid-beta (Aβ) deposition, and attenuating hyperphosphorylation of Tau. Biochemical analysis revealed that WSCP can increase SOD content and decrease MDA, IL-6, and TNF-α content in AD mice. Furthermore, serum metabolomic results showed that WSCP intervention can reverse metabolic disorders in AD mice. 43 endogenous metabolites were identified as potential biomarkers for WSCP treatment of AD, and the major metabolic pathways were Ala, Glu and Asp metabolism, TCA cycle. Overall, these findings will provide a basis for further development of WSCP.",

However, the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic relationship of Schisandra chinensis lignans has been less studied. The objective of this study was to investigate the relationship between the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of Schisandra chinensis lignans in the treatment of AD, and to establish a pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK-PD) model. Methods and Results: Herein, we established a microdialysis-ultra performance liquid chromatography-triple quadruple mass spectrometry (MD-LC-TQ-MS) technique that could simultaneously and continuously collect and quantitatively analyze the active compounds and neurotransmitters related to the therapeutic effects of Schisandra chinensis in awake AD rats. Eight lignans were detected in the hippocampus, and a PK-PD model was established. The fitted curves highlighted a temporal lag between the maximum drug concentration and the peak drug effect. Following treatment, the levels of four neurotransmitters tended to converge with those observed in the sham operation group. Conclusion: By establishing a comprehensive concentration-time-effect relationship for Schisandra chinensis lignans in AD treatment, our study provides novel insights into the in vivo effects of these lignans in AD rats."

This study investigates the relationship between colitis amelioration and the gut microbiota regulation of SCPE via fecal microbial transplantation (FMT). The results showed that administration of 20.4 g/kg BW of SCPE could primely ameliorate colitis induced by dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) in mice, showing as more integration of colon tissue structure and the colonic epithelial barrier, as well as lower oxidative stress and inflammation levels compared with colitis mice. Moreover, SCPE supplement restored the balance of T regulatory (Treg) cells and T helper 17 (Th17) cells. Gut microbiota analysis showed SCPE treatment could reshape the gut microbiota balance and improve the abundance of gut microbiota, especially the beneficial bacteria (Akkermansia and Lactobacillus) related to the production of short-chain fatty acids and the regulation of immunity. Most importantly, the protection of 20.4 g/kg BW of SCPE on colitis can be perfectly transmitted by fecal microbiota. Therefore, the gut microbiota-SCFAS-Treg/Th17 axis can be the main mechanism for SCPE to ameliorate colitis. This study suggests that SCPE can be a new promising functional food for prevention and treatment of colitis by reshaping gut microbiota and regulating gut immunity."

      "abstract": "Cancer remains one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide. The search for novel and effective anticancer agents has been a significant area of research. Dibenzocyclooctadiene lignans (DBCLS), derived from the Schisandra genus plants like: S. chinensis, S. sphenanthera, S. henryi, S. rubriflora, S. grandiflora, S. propinqua, and S. glabra, have been traditionally used in various medicinal systems and are known for their myriad health benefits, including anticancer properties. This comprehensive review aimed to collate and critically analyse the recent literature on the anticancer properties of DBCLS, focusing on their mechanistic approaches against different cancer types. An exhaustive literature search was performed using databases like PubMed/MedLine, Scopus, Web of Science, Embase, TRIP database and Google Scholar from 1980 to 2023. Peer-reviewed articles that elucidated the mechanistic approach of these lignans on cancer cell lines, in vivo models and preliminary clinical studies were included. Studies were assessed for their experimental designs, cancer types studied, and the mechanistic insights provided. The studies demonstrate that the anticancer effects of DBCLS compounds are primarily driven by their ability to trigger apoptosis, arrest the cell cycle, induce oxidative stress, modulate autophagy, and disrupt essential signaling pathways, notably MAPK, PI3K/Akt, and NF-κB. Additionally, these lignans have been shown to amplify the impact of traditional chemotherapy treatments, suggesting their potential role as supportive adjuncts in cancer therapy. Notably, several studies also emphasise their capacity to target cancer stem cells and mitigate multi-drug resistance specifically. DBCLS from the Schisandra genus have showcased significant potential as anticancer agents. Their multi-targeted mechanistic approach makes them promising candidates for further research, potentially leading to developing of new therapeutic strategies in cancer management."

      "abstract": "ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Ephedra sinica Stapf (Mahuang) and Schisandra chinensis (Turcz.) Baill (Wuweizi) are commonly utilized in traditional Chinese medicine for the treatment of cough and asthma. The synergistic effect of Mahuang-Wuweizi herb pair enhances their efficacy in alleviating respiratory symptoms, making them extensively employed in the management of respiratory disorders. Although previous studies have demonstrated the therapeutic potential of Mahuang-Wuweizi in pulmonary fibrosis, the precise mechanism underlying their effectiveness against asthma remains elusive. AIM OF THE STUDY: The objective of this study is to investigate the mechanism underlying the preventive and therapeutic effects of Mahuang-Wuweizi herb pair on asthma progression, focusing on airway inflammation and airway remodeling. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The active constituents and potential mechanisms of Mahuang-Wuweizi in the management of asthma were elucidated through network pharmacology analysis. Liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) was used to detect the main components of Mahuang-Wuweizi decoction. A rat model of bronchial asthma was established, and the effects of Mahuang-Wuweizi were investigated using hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining, immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), Western blotting (WB), and real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). RESULTS: The results of network pharmacological prediction showed that Mahuang had 22 active components and Wuweizi had 8 active components, with 225 potential targets. 1159 targets associated with asthma and 115 targets that overlap between drugs and diseases were identified. These include interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor (TNF), Tumor Protein 53, interleukin-1β (IL-1β), as well as other essential targets. Additionally, there is a potential correlation between asthma and Phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI3K)/Protein Kinase B (AKT) signaling pathway, calcium ion channels, nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) signaling pathway, and other signaling pathways. The animal experiment results demonstrated that treatment with Mahuang and Wuweizi, in comparison to the model group, exhibited improvements in lung tissue pathological injury, reduction in collagen fiber accumulation around the airway and proliferation of airway smooth muscle, decrease in concentration levels of IL-6, TNF-α and IL-1β in lung tissue, as well as alleviation of airway inflammation. Furthermore, Mahuang and Wuweizi suppressed the expression of phospholipase C (PLC), transient receptor potential channel 1 (TRPC1), myosin light chain kinase (MLCK), NF-κB P65 protein in ovalbumin (OVA)-sensitized rat lung tissue and downregulated the mRNA expression of PLC, TRPC1, PI3K, AKT, NF-κB P65 in asthmatic rats. These findings were consistent with network pharmacological analysis. CONCLUSION: The results show that the synergistic interaction between Mahuang and Wuweizi occur, and they can effectively reduce airway remodeling and airway inflammation induced by inhaling OVA in bronchial asthma rats by inhibiting the expression of PLC/TRPC1/PI3K/AKT/NF-κB signaling pathway. Therefore, Mahuang and Wuweizi may be potential drugs to treat asthma.",

This study investigates the combined effects of SC and ER on learning and memory in an Alzheimer's disease rat model and their underlying mechanisms. METHODS: High-performance liquid chromatography was employed to analyze the primary active constituents of Schisandra and Evodia. The effects of the combined treatment of Schisandra and Evodia on learning and memory in an Alzheimer's disease rat model were evaluated through Morris water maze and Hematoxylin-Eosin staining experiments. Immunohistochemical analysis was conducted to investigate the impact of S-E on Aβ1-42 and P-tau proteins. Western blotting and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction were utilized to quantify the expression of pivotal proteins and genes within the BDNF/TRKB/CREB and GSK-3β/Tau pathways. RESULTS: The treatment group exhibited significant neuroprotective effects, ameliorating learning and memory impairments in the Alzheimer's disease rat model. The treatment regimen modulated the activity of the BDNF/TRKB/CREB and GSK-3β/Tau pathways by influencing the expression of relevant genes, thereby reducing the generation of Aβ1-42 and P-Tau proteins and inhibiting the deposition of senile plaques. Furthermore, among the three treatment groups, the combined treatment demonstrated notably superior therapeutic effects on Alzheimer's disease compared to the single-drug treatment groups."

      "abstract": "Schisandra chinensis extract (SCE) protects against hypocholesterolemia by inhibiting proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin 9 (PCSK9) protein stabilization. We hypothesized that the hypocholesterolemic activity of SCE can be attributable to upregulation of the PCSK9 inhibition-associated low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR). Male mice were fed a low-fat diet or a Western diet (WD) containing SCE at 1% for 12 weeks. WD increased final body weight and blood LDL cholesterol levels as well as alanine transaminase and aspartate aminotransferase expression. However, SCE supplementation significantly attenuated the increase in blood markers caused by WD. SCE also attenuated WD-mediated increases in hepatic LDLR protein expression in the obese mice. In addition, SCE increased LDLR protein expression and attenuated cellular PCSK9 levels in HepG2 cells supplemented with delipidated serum (DLPS). Non-toxic concentrations of schisandrin A (SA), one of the active components of SCE, significantly increased LDLR expression and tended to decrease PCSK9 protein levels in DLPS-treated HepG2 cells. High levels of SA-mediated PCSK9 attenuation was not attributable to reduced PCSK9 gene expression, but was associated with free PCSK9 protein degradation in this cell model. Our findings show that PCSK9 secretion can be significantly reduced by SA treatment, contributing to reductions in free cholesterol levels.",

      "abstract": "ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: The dried fruit of Schisandra chinensis (Turcz.) Baill (S. chinensis) is widely used in treating central nervous system disorders. Increasing evidence has suggested that alcohol-soluble extracts and lignans from S. chinensis could significantly ameliorate depression-like behaviors in animal models, while there was little research on the potential of alcohol-insoluble polysaccharides as a candidate in the treatment of depression. AIM OF THE STUDY: Our research was designed to explore both the physicochemical characteristics and antidepressant-like effects of an alcohol-insoluble polysaccharide-rich fraction named SCP from S. chinensis. Simultaneously, the underlying mechanisms were elucidated in the study. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The physicochemical characteristics were accomplished by colorimetric assays, CE, HPGPC, and FT-IR. Behavioral despair testing accompanied by LAT were processed to promptly assess the antidepressant-like effects of SCP in mice. Then OBX-induced mice were established to explore the impacts of chronic co-treatments with SCP. Furthermore, effects of SCP on the HPA axis, oxidant/antioxidant system, neurotrophic and synaptic factors, and gut microbiota in OBX-induced mice were detected through ELISA and 16S rDNA (V3 + V4 regions) gene sequencing. RESULTS: SCP is a polysaccharide-rich fraction mainly comprised of xylose, glucose, rhamnose, galactose, mannose, and galacturonic acid in ratios of 0.27, 5.09, 0.24, 1.00, 0.63, and 2.86, of which the MW distribution ranges from 681 to 3232 Da. Acute pre-treatment with SCP (200 mg/kg, i.g.) remarkably reduced mice's immobility in the FST without motor stimulation. Prolonged pre-treatments effectively enhanced the effects of SCP on the behavioral despair testing in mice. Chronic co-treatments with SCP (50, 200, and 800 mg/kg, i.g.) could ameliorate the slow increase of body weight and behavioral abnormality of OBX-induced mice in systemic behavioral testing. SCP (200 mg/kg) also successfully restored hyperactivity of the HPA axis, oxidative damage in the liver, neurotrophic disturbance and abnormal synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus, and dysregulation of gut microbiota in OBX-induced mice. CONCLUSION: SCP exerts noteworthy antidepressant-like impacts on behavioral despair mice and OBX-induced mice via multiple targets, indicating a potential therapeutic candidate in depression therapy.",

Traditional packaging membranes are non-biodegradable and remain in the environment for a long time. In this study, natural antimicrobial substances were extracted from Schisandra chinensis by a green extraction process using distilled water as the solvent, and the effects of different treatment on the antimicrobial activity of the extract were compared. At the same time, four types of Schisandra chinensis antimicrobial membranes were prepared using polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) as the substrate. The whole extraction and membrane preparation process did not involve organic solvents, making the process green and environment friendly. Material characterization included inverted biological microscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), tensile strength test, pore size measurement, water uptake test, etc. Among them, no extract particles were observed with the naked eye on the surfaces of MⅡ and MⅣ. MⅡ has a uniformly transparent, nearly colorless morphology and is the most tensile. MⅣ surface is flat and smooth, the microstructure is dense and uniform. At the same time, the four types of membranes were tested against common pathogenic bacteria for 12 h, and the OD600 trend revealed the excellent antimicrobial activity of the membranes against S. aureus, MRSA, E. coli, and L. monocytogenes. The membranes could also be reused at least once. This study provides a new idea for preparing natural plant-based antimicrobial membranes.",

      "abstract": "ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Cervical cancer is one of the most common malignancies in women that continues to be a public health problem worldwide. Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is closely related as the causative agent of almost all cases of cervical cancer. Currently, there is no effective treatment for the persistence of HPV. Although vaccines have shown promising results in recent years, they are still a costly strategy for developing countries and have no therapeutic effect on existing infections, which is why the need arises to search for new strategies that can be used in treatment, suppressing oncogenic HPV and disease progression. Extracts of Schisandra Chinensis and Pueraria lobata have been used in traditional medicine, and it has been shown in recent years that some of their bioactive compounds have pharmacological, antioxidant, antitumor, apoptotic, and proliferation effects in HPV-positive cells. However, its mechanism of action has yet to be fully explored. AIM OF THE STUDY: The following study aimed to determine the chemical composition, antioxidant activity, and potential antiproliferative and viral oncogene effects of natural extracts of S. chinensis and P. lobata on HPV-18 positive cervical cancer cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The HPV-18-positive HeLa cells were treated for 24 and 48 h with the ethanolic extracts of S chinensis and P. lobata. Subsequently, cell viability was evaluated using the resazurin method, the effect on the cell cycle of the extracts (1.0, 10, and 100 μg/mL) was measured by flow cytometry, the gene of expression of the E6/E7, P53, BCL-2, and E2F-1 were determined by RT-PCR and the protein expression of p53, Ki-67, x|and Bcl-2 by immunohistochemistry. Additionally, the chemical characterization of the two extracts was carried out using LC-MS, and the total phenolics content (TPC), Total flavonoid content (TFC), and DPPH radical scavenging capacity were determined. Data were analyzed using the Mann-Whitney and Kruskal Wallis U test with GraphPad Prism 6 software. RESULTS: The natural extracts of Schisandra chinensis and Pueraria lobata induced down-regulation of E6 HPV oncogene (p<0.05) and a strong up-regulation of P53 (p<0.05), E2F-1 (p<0.05), and Bcl-2 (p<0.05) gene expression. Simultaneously, the natural extracts tend to increase the p53 protein levels and arrest the cell cycle of HeLa in the G1/S phase (p<0.05). Investigated extracts were characterized by the occurrence of bioactive lignans and isoflavones in S. chinensis and P. lobata, respectively. CONCLUSION: The extracts of S. chinensis and P. lobata within their chemical characterization mainly present lignan and isoflavone-type compounds, which are probably responsible for inhibiting the expression of the HPV E6 oncogene and inducing an increase in the expression of p53, Bcl -2 and E2F-1 producing cell cycle detection in S phase in HeLa cells. Therefore, these extracts are good candidates to continue studying their antiviral and antiproliferative potential in cells transformed by HPV.",

In this paper, a simple and rapid strategy for simultaneous extraction and determination of 10 lignans from S. chinensis was established through matrix solid-phase dispersion (MSPD) assisted by diol-functionalized silica (Diol). The experimental parameters for MSPD extraction were screened using the response surface methodology (RSM). Diol (800 mg) was used as a dispersant and methanol (MeOH, 85%, v/v) as an eluting solvent (10 mL), resulting in a high extraction efficiency. MSPD extraction facilitated the combination of extraction and purification in a single step, which was less time-consuming than and avoided the thermal treatment involved in traditional methods. The simultaneous qualification and quantification of 10 lignans was achieved by combining MSPD and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The proposed method offered good linearity and a low limit of detection starting from 0.04 (schisandrin C) to 0.43 μg/mL (schisantherin B) for lignans, and the relative standard deviation (RSD, %) values of precision were acceptable, with a maximum value of 1.15% (schisantherin B and schisanhenol). The methodology was successfully utilized to analyze 13 batches of S. chinensis from different cultivated areas of China, which proved its accuracy and practicability in the quantitative analysis of the quality control of S. chinensis.",

Meanwhile, Schisandra polysaccharide (SCP) has been reported to exert a protective effect on the nervous system and can regulate metabolic disorders in AD-like symptoms of amyloid β-peptide (Aβ) 25-35-induced rats. Nevertheless, the underlying mechanisms and metabolic markers for the diagnosis of AD are yet to be determined. This study aimed to explore the neuroprotective effect and potential mechanism of action of SCP in AD-like symptoms of Aβ25-35-induced rats by combining pharmacodynamics, metabolomics, and lipidomics. The pharmacodynamic results revealed that SCP significantly improved the spatial learning and long-term memory function and the morphology of neurons in the hippocampal CA1 region, alleviated inflammatory damage and oxidative stress, inhibited the activation of microglia and astrocytes, and increased the proportion of mature neurons of AD-like symptoms of Aβ25-35-induced rats. The results of hippocampal metabolomics and serum lipidomics showed 46 and 48 potential biomarkers were identified for the SCP treatment of AD, respectively. The involved pathways principally comprised lipid metabolism, amino acid metabolism, and energy metabolism. This study elucidates the neuroprotective effect of SCP in AD and its mechanism from the perspective of metabolomics and lipidomics and provides a theoretical basis for the therapeutic effect of SCP in AD."

Recent reports emphasized the contribution of triglyceride and diglyceride accumulation to NASH, while the other lipids associated with the NASH pathogenesis remained unexplored. The specific purpose of our study was to explore a novel pathogenesis and treatment strategy of NASH via profiling the metabolic characteristics of lipids. Herein, multi-omics techniques based on LC-Q-TOF/MS, LC-MS/MS and MS imaging were developed and used to screen the action targets related to NASH progress and treatment. A methionine and choline deficient (MCD) diet-induced mouse model of NASH was then constructed, and Schisandra lignans extract (SLE) was applied to alleviate hepatic damage by regulating the lipid metabolism-related enzymes CES2A and CYP4A14. Hepatic lipidomics indicated that MCD-diet led to aberrant accumulation of phosphatidylethanolamines (PEs), and SLE could significantly reduce the accumulation of intrahepatic PEs. Notably, exogenous PE (18:0/18:1) was proved to significantly aggravate the mitochondrial damage and hepatocyte apoptosis. Supplementing PE (18:0/18:1) also deteriorated the NASH progress by up regulating intrahepatic proinflammatory and fibrotic factors, while PE synthase inhibitor exerted a prominent hepatoprotective role. The current work provides new insights into the relationship between PE metabolism and the pathogenesis of NASH."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Schisandra chinensis (Turcz.) Baill, a fruit utilized in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), has a long history of medical application. It has been used to treat diseases of the gastrointestinal tract. Schisandra chinensis (Turcz.) Baill polysaccharide (SACP) is an important biologically active ingredient that has been shown to have a variety of beneficial effects including immune regulation and anti-oxidative properties. Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a complicated gastrointestinal inflammatory disease. We explore the protective effect of SACP against UC. RESULTS: Schisandra chinensis (Turcz.) Baill polysaccharide significantly reduced the disease activity index (DAI) and levels of myeloperoxidase(MPO) and malondialdehyde (MDA) in colonic tissue. It also alleviated weight loss and histopathological damage of mice. The expression of MUC2 and occludin proteins was increased and the barrier function of the colonic mucosa was enhanced by SACP treatment. NF-κB pathway activation was also inhibited and the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines was decreased whereas anti-inflammatory cytokines were increased. 16SrDNA sequencing of fecal flora showed that SACP increased the abundance of Muribaculaceaeunclassified, LachnospiraceaeNK4A136group and reduced the abundance of Bacteroides and Erysipelatoclostridium.

      "abstract": "Influenza virus is prone to seasonal spread and widespread outbreaks, which pose important challenges to public health security. Therefore, it is important to effectively prevent and treat influenza virus infection. Schisandra polysaccharide (SPJ) is a polysaccharide derived from the fruit of Schisandra chinensis (Turcz.) Baill. In this study, we evaluated the antiviral activity of SPJ in vitro and in vivo, especially against influenza A virus (IAV) infection. By analyzing SPJ structure and monosaccharide composition, the molecular weight of SPJ was determined to be 115.5 KD, and it is composed of galacturonic acid (89.4%), rhamnose (0.8%), galactose (4.4%), arabinose (3.8%), and glucose (1.7%). Immunofluorescence analysis showed that SPJ treatment reduced the positive rate of viral nucleoproteins in cells, indicating that the compound had an inhibitory effect on influenza virus replication. Furthermore, SPJ therapy improved the survival of infected mice. Lung virus titer assays indicated that SPJ treatment significantly reduced viral loading in the lung tissue of infected mice and alleviated the pathological damage caused by influenza virus infection. Moreover, SPJ reduced cytokine expression during influenza virus challenge. In conclusion, SPJ has anti-influenza virus effects and may have potential as an anti-influenza drug candidate in further clinical studies."

      "abstract": "ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) poses a growing challenge to global health efforts. The 5-year survival rate of HCC patients is still dismal. A traditional prescription Qi-Wei-Wan (QWW) comprising Astragali Radix and Schisandra chinensis Fructus has traditionally been used for HCC treatment according to traditional Chinese medicine theory, but the pharmacological basis is not clear. AIM OF THE STUDY: This study aims to investigate the anti-HCC effects of an ethanolic extract of QWW (hereafter, QWWE) and the mechanism of action. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An UPLC-Q-TOF-MS/MS method was developed to control the quality of QWWE. Two human HCC cell lines (HCCLM3 and HepG2) and a HCCLM3 xenograft mouse model were employed to investigate the anti-HCC effects of QWWE. The anti-proliferative effect of QWWE in vitro was determined by MTT, colony formation and EdU staining assays. Apoptosis and protein levels were examined by flow cytometry and Western blotting, respectively. Nuclear presence of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) was examined by immunostaining. Transient transfection of pEGFP-LC3 and STAT3C plasmids was performed to assess autophagy and determine the involvement of STAT3 signaling in QWWE's anti-HCC effects, respectively. RESULTS: We found that QWWE inhibited the proliferation of and triggered apoptosis in HCC cells. Mechanistically, QWWE inhibited the activation of SRC and STAT3 at Tyr416 and Tyr705, respectively; inhibited the nuclear translocation of STAT3; lowered Bcl-2 protein levels, while increased Bax protein levels in HCC cells. Over-activating STAT3 attenuated the cytotoxic and apoptotic effects of QWWE in HCC cells. Moreover, QWWE induced autophagy in HCC cells by inhibiting mTOR signaling. Blocking autophagy with autophagy inhibitors (3-methyladenine and chloroquine) enhanced the cytotoxicity, apoptotic effect and the inhibitory effect on STAT3 activation of QWWE. Intragastric administration of QWWE at 10 mg/kg and 20 mg/kg potently repressed tumor growth and inhibited STAT3 and mTOR signaling in tumor tissues, but did not significantly affect mouse body weight. CONCLUSION: QWWE exhibited potent anti-HCC effects. Inhibiting the STAT3 signaling pathway is involved in QWWE-mediated apoptosis, while blocking mTOR signaling contributes to QWWE-mediated autophagy induction. Blockade of autophagy enhanced the anti-HCC effects of QWWE, indicating that the combination of an autophagy inhibitor and QWWE might be a promising therapeutic strategy for HCC management. Our findings provide pharmacological justifications for the traditional use of QWW in treating HCC.",

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: To study the active components, drug targets and mechanism of Schisandra chinensis (S.chinensis) combined with coenzyme Q10 (CQ10) in the treatment of heart failure (HF). METHODS: Network pharmacology combined with the gene expression omnibus chip method to analyze the main pathways by which S.chinensis combined with CQ10 functioned to treat heart failure. Subsequently, the biological activities of the major pathway key proteins and their corresponding compounds were verified by molecular docking techniques. Finally, the molecular mechanism of S. chinensis combined with CQ10 for the treatment of heart failure was verified using a rat heart failure model induced by isoproterenol hydrochloride and using hematoxylin-eosin staining, TUNEL, immunohistochemistry and Western blot. RESULTS: Network pharmacology combined with experimental validation suggests that the mechanism of action of S.chinensis combined with CQ10 in the treatment of heart failure may involve CQ10, Citral, Schisandrone, Schisanhenol B, Gomisin O, Schisandrin C and other components, which may synergistically inhibit the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway and affect the expression of AKT1, PIK3CG and other targets on this pathway. In addition, S. chinensis combined with CQ10 could effectively improve the cardiac coefficients of rats with heart failure, reduce the area of myocardial fibrosis and lowered the serum levels of IL-1β and TNF-α in heart failure rats, as well as reduced cardiac myocyte apoptosis, increased Bcl-2 expression and decreased p-PI3K/PI3K, p-AKT/AKT, P65 and Bax expression in cardiac tissue. Comparison of the results showed that the combination of S.chinensis and CQ10 was more effective compared with CQ10 alone, ie, the ability of S.chinensis combined with CQ10 in improving cardiac function, inhibiting cardiomyocyte apoptosis and reducing inflammatory response lies in the synergistic effect of PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. CONCLUSION: The therapeutic effect of S.chinensis combined with CQ10 on heart failure, which may occur through the inhibition of PI3K/AKT signaling pathway.",

Its pathological mechanism and therapeutic strategies have not been fully elucidated yet. The neuroprotective value of micrandilactone C (MC), a new schiartane nortriterpenoid isolated from the roots of Schisandra chinensis, is not well-known either. Here, the neuroprotective effects of MC were demonstrated in 3-nitropropionic acid (3-NPA)-treated animal and cell culture models of HD. MC mitigated neurological scores and lethality following 3-NPA treatment, which is associated with decreases in the formation of a lesion area, neuronal death/apoptosis, microglial migration/activation, and mRNA or protein expression of inflammatory mediators in the striatum. MC also inhibited the activation of the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) in the striatum and microglia after 3-NPA treatment. As expected, decreases in inflammation and STAT3-activation were reproduced in a conditioned medium of lipopolysaccharide-stimulated BV2 cells pretreated with MC. The conditioned medium blocked the reduction in NeuN expression and the enhancement of mutant huntingtin expression in STHdhQ111/Q111 cells. Taken together, MC might alleviate behavioral dysfunction, striatal degeneration, and immune response by inhibiting microglial STAT3 signaling in animal and cell culture models for HD. Thus, MC may be a potential therapeutic strategy for HD.",

Thereafter, the obtained SCP-Se NPs were characterized by transmission electron microscope, X-ray diffraction, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The influence of different storage environments on the stability of colloidal SCP-Se NPs was also investigated. Finally, the therapeutic effects of SCP-Se NPs on LPS-induced intestinal inflammatory injuries in mice were evaluated. Results showed that the optimized SCP-Se NPs were amorphous, uniform, spherical particles with a diameter of 121 nm, and the colloidal solution was stable at 4 °C for at least 14 d. Moreover, SCP-Se NPs could more effectively alleviate LPS-induced diarrhea, intestinal tissue injury, and tight junction destruction and decrease the elevated expression levels of TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 compared with SCP. These results demonstrate that SCP-Se NPs may alleviate LPS-induced enteritis through their anti-inflammatory effects, indicating that SCP-Se NPs can serve as a good candidate for preventing and treating enteritis in the livestock and poultry industry."

Schisandra chinensis fruit Mixture (SM) is an herbal formulation that has been used for a long time to treat DKD. However, its pharmacological and molecular mechanisms have not been clearly elucidated. The aim of this study was to investigate the potential mechanisms of SM for the treatment of DKD through network pharmacology, molecular docking and experimental validation. METHODS: The chemical components in SM were comprehensively identified and collected using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and database mining. The mechanisms were investigated using a network pharmacology, including obtaining SM-DKD intersection targets, completing protein-protein interactions (PPI) by Cytoscape to obtain key potential targets, and then revealing potential mechanisms of SM for DKD by GO and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis. The important pathways and phenotypes screened by the network analysis were validated experimentally in vivo. Finally, the core active ingredients were screened by molecular docking. RESULTS: A total of 53 active ingredients of SM were retrieved by database and LC-MS, and 143 common targets of DKD and SM were identified; KEGG and PPI showed that SM most likely exerted anti-DKD effects by regulating the expression of AGEs/RAGE signaling pathway-related inflammatory factors. In addition, our experimental validation results showed that SM improved renal function and pathological changes in DKD rats, down-regulated AGEs/RAGE signaling pathway, and further down-regulated the expression of TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, and up-regulated IL-10. Molecular docking confirmed the tight binding properties between (+)-aristolone, a core component of SM, and key targets. CONCLUSION: This study reveals that SM improves the inflammatory response of DKD through AGEs/RAGE signaling pathway, thus providing a novel idea for the clinical treatment of DKD.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) posits that Chinese medicinal materials can only be clinically used after being processed and prepared into decoction pieces. Schisandra Chinensis Fructus (derived from the dried and mature fruits of Schisandra chinensis (Turcz.) Baill.) has been used as a traditional antiasthmatic, kidney strengthening, and hepatoprotective agent for 2000 years. The results of previous research show that decoction pieces of wine-steamed Schisandra chinensis (WSC) are more effective than raw decoction pieces of Schisandra chinensis (RSC) for treating cough and asthma. Steaming with wine was demonstrated to promote the dissolution of ingredients. However, the relationship between the changes in the components of the decoction pieces of WSC and the therapeutic effect remains unclear. METHODS: The efficacies of decoctions of RSC and WSC were compared using allergic asthma rats. The potential bioactive components in the serum of the WSC treatment group and the changes in the chemical composition of the RSC decoction pieces before and after wine steaming were determined by ultra-performance liquid chromatography quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-Q-TOF-MS/MS) and ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC H-CLASS XEVO TQD) to speculate quality markers (Q-markers) related to the efficacy of WSC, which were subsequently verified based on a zebrafish inflammation model. RESULTS: Steaming RSC decoction pieces with wine was found to promote improvement of allergic asthma. Reverse tracing of 22 components detected in the serum of the high dose group of WSC (WSC-H) resulted in 12 ingredients being finally designated as potential effective components. Among these ingredients, 5 components, Schisandrin, Schisandrol B, Schisandrin A, Schisandrin B, and Gomisin D, had higher dissolution rates than RSC after steaming with wine. Validation by an inflammatory zebrafish model showed that these 5 ingredients had a dose-dependent effect and were therefore Q-markers for WSC in the treatment of allergic asthma. CONCLUSION: In this study, changes in the components of decoction pieces of RSC and WSC and Q-markers related to WSC efficacy were identified, providing valuable information for expanding the application of WSC and establishing a specific quality standard for WSC."

      "abstract": "Schisandra chinensis is a potential plant for production of nutrient supplements due to adaptogens content. The dominant bioactive substance, lignan schisandrin, has positive effects on human health, but it can cause possible allelopathic effects in relation to other plants. S. chinensis is not native to European ecosystems, and its ecotoxicological properties have not been verified yet. Lemna minor was selected as a model aquatic plant to test its potential impact on the aquatic environment. Crude water extract from S. chinensis fruits, simulating the natural soaking of active substances in a surface water body, was used in treatments from 0.045 to 45 mg/L (according to the content of schisandrin as the dominating lignan). During seven days of cultivation, the growth (number of plants, leaf area, fresh weight) and photosynthetic activity of L. minor fronds were assessed. In low treatments (0.045 and 0.09 mg/L), the extract of S. chinensis did not cause any changes in duckweed growth parameters or photosynthetic performance. Higher treatments (0.45 and 0.9 mg/L) caused significant limitations in plants' number, total leaf area, and fresh weight. The photosynthetic parameters (basal chlorophyll fluorescence, quantum yields) were affected only by 0.9 mg/L. The highest treatment, 45 mg/L, exhibited extreme toxicity to duckweed plants causing their death during the first five days of cultivation. Schisandrin and other bioactive substances extractable from S. chinensis fruits can negatively impact water biota in the case of massive contamination of surface water.",

      "abstract": "Being the most common form of dementia, Alzheimer's disease (AD) has a series of modifiable risk factors, including metal ions represented by aluminium. Aluminium (Al) exhibits its neurotoxic effects, especially mainly by affecting amyloid-β protein (Aβ) aggregation and Tau hyperphosphorylation. As reported in our previous study, the combination of Alpinia Oxyphylla Fructus and Schisandra Chinensis Fructus (AS) had a neuroprotective effect. This study aimed to evaluate the anti-AD effect of AS and the mechanism by which AS reduces the neurotoxic effect of Al. Firstly, we used aluminium-maltol (Al(mal)3) to construct a mouse model of AD and performed oral administration of AS, followed by behavioral experiments, and we collected the mouse brain for immunohistochemistry analysis. In vivo results showed that AS significantly improved Al-induced cognitive decline in mice, and reduced the levels of Aβ1-42 and P-Tau in the brain, which further proved the anti-AD effect of AS. Then, in order to explore the mechanism by which AS reduced Aβ1-42, Al-induced PC12 cells were used for the in vitro experiments. Compared with other ratios, the ratio of Alpinia Oxyphylla Fructus: Schisandra Chinensis Fructus (AO:SC) = 1:2 could better improve the cell viability and reduce the Aβ1-42 level. According to western blot and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) results, AS ameliorated the pathological process by downregulating the expression of β-secretase (BACE1), rather than by reducing the expression of amyloid precursor protein (APP) or Tau. These results suggest that AS ameliorated Al-induced AD by affecting the expression of BACE1 and reducing the level of Aβ1-42, thereby exerting a neuroprotective effect. Combined with previous studies, this study shows that AS has potential for further research and development in AD treatment.",

The inflammatory response plays a critical role in DN. Schisandra Chinensis Mixture (SM) has shown promising clinical efficacy in the treatment of DN while the pharmacological mechanisms are still unclear. AIM OF THE STUDY: In this study, a network pharmacology approach and bioinformatic analysis were adopted to predict the pharmacological mechanisms of SM in DN therapy. Based on the predicted results, molecular docking and in vivo experiments were used for verification. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this study, the candidate bioactive ingredients of SM were obtained via Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology Database (TCMSP) and supplementing according to the literature. SM putative targets and the verified targets were acquired from TCMSP and SiwssTartgetPrediction Database. DN-related target genes were collected from GeneCards, OMIM, DisGeNET databases, and microarray data analysis. Biological function and pathway analysis were performed to further explore the pharmacological mechanisms of SM in DN therapy. The protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was established to screen the hub gene. The Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis and the molecular docking simulations were performed to validate the potential target-drug interactions. The fingerprint spectrum of multi-components of the SM was characterized by UPLC-MS/MS. The signaling pathways associated with inflammation and hub genes were partially validated in SD rats. RESULTS: A total of 36 bioactive ingredients were contained, and 666 component-related targets were screened from SM, of which 50 intersected with DN targets and were considered potential therapeutic targets. GO analyses revealed that the 50 intersection targets were mainly enriched in the inflammatory response, positive regulation of angiogenesis, and positive regulation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase(PI3K) signaling. KEGG analyses indicated that the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway was considered as the most important pathway for SM antagonism to the occurrence and development of DN, with the highest target count enrichment. PPI network results showed that the top 15 protein targets in degree value, VEGFA, JAK2, CSF1R, NOS3, CCR2, CCR5, TLR7, FYN, BTK, LCK, PLAT, NOS2, TEK, MMP1 and MCL1, were identified as hub genes. The results of ROC analysis showed that VEGFA and NOS3 were valuable in the diagnosis of DN. The molecular docking confirmed that the core bioactive ingredients had well-binding affinity for VEGFA and NOS3. The in vivo experiments confirmed that SM significantly inhibited the over-release of inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-6 and tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNF)-α in DN rats, while regulating the PI3K-AKT and VEGFA-NOS3 signaling pathways. CONCLUSION: This study revealed the multi-component, multi-target and multi-pathway characteristics of SM therapeutic DN. SM inhibited the inflammatory response and improved renal pathological damage in DN rats, which was related to the regulation of the PI3K-Akt and VEGFA-NOS3 signaling pathways.",

We then examined the effects and molecular mechanisms on adipogenesis and lipolysis of schisandrin C (SC), which most inhibited TG levels during adipogenesis of 3T3-L1 cells. Treatment of 3T3-L1 cells with SC markedly decreased adipocyte differentiation but did not influence cell proliferation. During adipogenesis, SC significantly reduced total lipid and TG contents and down-regulated the mRNA expressions of C/EBPα, PPARγ, SREBP1c, aP2, and FAS. In addition, SC significantly increased p-AMPK, and this activation regulated the protein levels of major adipogenic transcription factors (PPARγ and C/EBPα). Furthermore, SC lowered the mRNA expressions of HSL and perilipin and inhibited pancreatic lipase levels, which are both related to lipolysis. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Our results indicate that SC regulates lipogenesis and lipolysis by increasing AMPK phosphorylation and suggest that it may be beneficial for preventing obesity and related metabolic diseases. Thus, this study proposes a mechanical basis for developing SC-containing foods as a beneficial dietary strategy.",

Our previous study revealed that its extract is effective against nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). AIM OF THIS STUDY: This study aimed to elucidate the active components and explore the underlying mechanisms of action of S. chinensis fruit in the treatment of NAFLD. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A HepG2 cell model was used to screen the anti-NAFLD activity of the fraction from S. chinensis fruit extract. Ultra-performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-Q-TOF/MS) was used to determine the components of the active fraction. Active compounds, potential targets, and key pathways were predicted for the active fraction treatment of NAFLD using network pharmacology. The anti-NAFLD effects of the active fraction and core active compound 3 were further validated using a high-fat diet (HFD)-induced NAFLD mouse model, intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test (IPGTT), and intraperitoneal insulin tolerance test (IPITT). Related hepatic mRNA expression was detected using quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) to preliminarily validate the mechanism. RESULTS: In vitro experiments showed that the active fraction of S. chinensis fruit ethanol (EtOH) extract was mainly concentrated in the soluble fraction of petroleum ether (PET). Thirty-seven lignans were identified in this active fraction using UPLC-Q-TOF/MS. Network pharmacology studies have indicated that its anti-NAFLD effects lie in three major active lignans (3, 24, and 27) contained in PET, which may regulate the insulin resistance signaling pathway. In vivo experiments demonstrated that PET and core active compound 3 treatment significantly attenuated hepatic steatosis and reduced the levels of serum alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST), insulin, malondialdehyde (MDA), hepatic triglyceride (TG), and total cholesterol (TC) in HFD-induced mice (P < 0.05). Moreover, treatment with PET and compound 3 alleviated glucose tolerance and insulin resistance. These beneficial effects can be achieved by regulating the expression of Pik3ca, Gsk3β, Jnk1, and Tnf-α. CONCLUSION: This study identified the main active fraction and compounds responsible for the anti-NAFLD activity of S. chinensis fruit. This mechanism may be related to regulation of the resistance pathway.",

Herb pair is a unique combination of two relatively fixed herbs, which embodies the integrity of TCM theory. In this study, untargeted fecal metabolomics based on MS was used to investigate the action mechanism of Radix ginseng and Schisandra chinensis (GS) herb pair on the complex disease of Alzheimer's disease (AD), and further analyze the therapeutic effects of small molecular components and saccharides of GS on AD. Quantitative analysis of bile acids (BAs) and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) further verified the conclusion of untargeted metabolomics. The results of the pharmacodynamics evaluation showed that the AD model was successfully constructed, and each TCM group had a different degree of improvement compared with the AD group. PCA analysis based on untargeted fecal metabolomics showed that the metabolic disorders in AD rats changed significantly over time, and there were different degrees of callback in each TCM group. The result indicated that the GS herb pair can regulate metabolic disorders of AD. Further analysis of therapeutic biomarkers showed that GS mainly regulated the metabolism of bile acid biosynthesis, sphingolipid metabolism, porphyrin and chlorophyll metabolism, etc. to treat AD. This study will help to further understand the pathogenesis of AD from metabolomics, and provide beneficial support for the further study of GS and the clinical treatment of complex diseases with TCM.",

(SC) is an important traditional Chinese herbal medicine, which has been widely used in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) for treating intestinal diseases. It is also traditionally used as health product and medicine in Russia and other countries. However, the effect of SC ethanol extract on anti-ulcerative colitis (UC) has not been systematically studied yet. AIM OF THE STUDY: We investigated the protective effects and underlying action mechanisms of SC extract (SCE) for UC treatment. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An animal model of UC induced by dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) was established. After oral administration of SCE, the Disease Activity Index (DAI) was calculated, the length of colon measured, levels of proinflammatory factors determined, and histopathology carried out to assess the therapeutic efficacy of SCE on UC. The effects of SCE on the toll-like receptor 4/nuclear factor-kappa B/nucleotide-binding and oligomerization domain-like receptor family pyrin domain containing 3 inflammasome (TLR4/NF-κB/NLRP3 inflammasome) signaling pathway were evaluated by western blotting. High-throughput sequencing was done to reveal the effect of SCE on the change of the gut microbiota (GM) in mice with DSS-induced colitis. RESULTS: SCE significantly reduced the DAI score, restored colon-length shortening, and ameliorated colonic histopathologic injury in mice with DSS-induced colitis. SCE inhibited the inflammatory response by regulating the TLR4/NF-κB/NLRP3 inflammasome pathway in mice with UC. SCE also maintained gut barrier function by increasing the levels of zonula occludens (ZO)-1 and occludin. 16S rRNA sequencing showed that SCE could reverse the GM imbalance caused by UC. CONCLUSIONS: SCE can ameliorate DSS-induced colitis, and that its effects might be associated with suppression of the TLR4/NF-κB/NLRP3 inflammasome pathway and GM regulation, which may provide significant supports for the development of potential candidates for UC treatment.",

Traditional Chinese medicines (TCM) of Schisandra chinensis and Acorus tatarinowii Schott have the pharmacological effects of sedation and neuroprotection and have been clinically proven to be effective in the treatment of AD. However, their main anti-Alzheimer's compounds and functional mechanisms remain unclear. PURPOSE: To elucidate the main therapeutic components and possible mechanisms of Sc-At in AD using a comprehensive strategy combining metabolomics and network pharmacology. METHODS: First, the UPLC-QTOF/MS method was used to identify the main chemical constituents of Schisandra chinensis and Acorus tatarinowii Schott alcohol extracts in vitro and in vivo. Secondly, the theoretical active ingredients, targets, and pathways of Sc-At for AD treatment were predicted by network pharmacology methods. Finally, plasma metabolomics were detected by UPLC-QTOF/MS to analyze the differential metabolites and metabolic pathways related to Sc-At. Based on the analyses above, the anti-AD mechanism of Sc-At was explored. RESULTS: A total of 95 chemical components were identified in Sc-At extracts in vitro, and 34 prototype drug components were detected in rat plasma; network pharmacology screening identified 14 drug components in line with the principle of Lipinski, of which 10 were present for in vitro drug composition analysis. For these 10 components, 58 AD disease targets were predicted, and 85 AD-related KEGG signaling pathways were enriched. Six core biomarkers of Sc-At (cis-8,11,14,17-eicosatetraenoic acid, prostaglandin H2, sphingosine 1-phosphate, enol-phenylpyruvate, 3-methoxytyrosine, and pristanoyl-CoA) were regulated to a normal state during the treatment of AD. CONCLUSION: The mechanism of Sc-At for the treatment of AD can be achieved by the effect of the 10 compounds of Sc-At on TNF, MAPK8, MAPK14, PTGS1, and other targets, thereby affecting arachidonic acid metabolism, neurotransmitters, and sphingolipid metabolism.",

The behavioral despair mouse model in vivo and H2O2-induced PC12 cells model in vitro were employed. And the potential effective components were identified by the spectrum-effect relationships analysis. SEO significantly decreased the immobility time in the forced swimming test and tail suspension test, which indicated a promising antidepressant-like effect of SEO in depressed mice. The decreased levels of SOD, GSH, and CAT, and increased levels of MDA were significantly reversed by SEO treatment, which showed good antioxidant activities both in vitro and in vivo. Besides, SEO significantly promoted the nuclear translocation of Nrf2 and the expression of HO-1 in depressed mice and H2O2-induced PC12 cells. The histopathological examination results showed a potential neuronal protective effect of SEO in the hippocampus and cortex. Furthermore, the upregulation of PI3K/AKT/GSK3β signaling was observed after SEO treatment in the H2O2-induced PC12 cells. Additionally, based on the spectrum-effect relationship analysis, 9 peaks were identified as positively correlated with the antioxidant activity of SEO. These results suggested that SEO promoted Nrf2/HO-1 pathway to improve the oxidative stress status and exerted the antidepressant-like effects.",

OBJECTIVE: This study investigates the effects of SCEO in the treatment of acetaminophen (APAP)-induced liver injury in mice. MATERIALS AND METHODS: C57BL/6 mice (n = 56) were randomly divided into seven groups: normal; APAP (300 mg/kg); APAP plus bicyclol (200 mg/kg); APAP plus SCEO (0.25, 0.5, 1, 2 g/kg). Serum biochemical parameters for liver function, inflammatory factors, and antioxidant activities were determined. The protein expression levels of Nrf2, GCLC, GCLM, HO-1, p62, and LC3 were assessed by western blotting. Nrf2, GCLC, HO-1, p62, and LC3 mRNA were detected by real-time PCR. RESULTS: Compared to APAP overdose, SCEO (2 g/kg) pre-treatment reduced the serum levels of AST (79.4%), ALT (84.6%), TNF-α (57.3%), and IL-6 (53.0%). In addition, SCEO (2 g/kg) markedly suppressed cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1) (15.4%) and attenuated the exhaustion of GSH (43.6%) and SOD (16.8%), and the accumulation of MDA (22.6%) in the liver, to inhibit the occurrence of oxidative stress. Moreover, hepatic tissues from our experiment revealed that SCEO pre-treatment mitigated liver injury caused by oxidative stress by increasing Nrf2, HO-1, and GCL. Additionally, SCEO activated autophagy, which upregulated hepatic LC3-II and decreased p62 in APAP overdose mice (p < 0.05). DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: Our evidence demonstrated that SCEO protects hepatocytes from APAP-induced liver injury in vivo and the findings will provide a reliable theoretical basis for developing novel therapeutics.",

In LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 cells, a 100 µg/mL dose of SCLE significantly reduced the production of nitric oxide (NO), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). Acetic acid-induced writhing responses in mice that quantitatively determine pain were significantly inhibited by SCLE treatment. In addition, SCLE significantly decreased the MIA-induced elevation in OA symptoms, the expression levels of pro-inflammatory mediators/cytokines and matrix metalloproteinases, and cartilage damage in the serum and joint tissues. Our data demonstrated that SCLE exerts anti-osteoarthritic effects by regulating inflammation and pain and can be a useful therapeutic candidate against OA.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To investigate the protective effects of Schisandra chinensis oil (SCEO) against aristolochic acid I (AA I)-induced nephrotoxicity in vivo and in vitro and elucidate the underlying mechanism. METHODS: C57BL/6 mice were randomly divided into 5 groups according to a random number table, including control group, AA I group, and AA I +SCEO (0.25, 0.5 and 1 g/kg) groups (n=5 per group). Pretreatment with SCEO was done for 2 days by oral administration, while the control and AA I groups were treated with sodium carboxymethyl cellulose. Mice of all groups except for the control group were injected intraperitoneally with AA I (5 mg/kg) from day 3 until day 7. Histopathological examination and apoptosis of kidney tissue were observed by hematoxylin and eosin and TdT-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) staining, respectively. The levels of serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and serum creatinine (SCr), as well as renal malondialdehyde (MDA), glutathione, r-glutamyl cysteingl+glycine (GSH), and superoxide dismutase (SOD) were analyzed using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Expressions of hepatic cytochrome P450 1A1 (CYP1A1), CYP1A2, and nad(p)hquinonedehydrogenase1 (NQO1) were analyzed using ELISA, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and Western blot, respectively. In vitro, SCEO (40 µ g/mL) was added 12 h before treatment with AA I (40 µ mol/mL for 48 h) in human renal proximal tubule cell line (HK-2), then apoptosis and reactive oxygen species (ROS) were analyzed by flow cytometry. RESULTS: SCEO 0.5 and 1 g/kg ameliorated histopathological changes and TUNEL+ staining in the kidney tissues of mice with AA I-induced nephrotoxicity, and reduced serum levels of ALT, AST, BUN and SCr (P<0.01 or P<0.05). SCEO 0.5 and 1 g/kg alleviated the ROS generation in kidney, containing MDA, GSH and SOD (P<0.01 or P<0.05). SCEO 1 g/kg increased the expressions of CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 and decreased NQO1 level in the liver tissues (P<0.01 or P<0.05). Besides, in vitro studies also demonstrated that SCEO 40 µ g/mL inhibited apoptosis and ROS generation (P<0.05 or P<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: SCEO can alleviate AA I-induced kidney damage both in vivo and in vitro. The protective mechanism may be closely related to the regulation of metabolic enzymes, thereby inhibiting apoptosis and ROS production.",

Some medications for the treatment of T2DM complications have the risk of inducing severe adverse reactions such as diarrhea via the metabolism of intestinal bacterial β-glucuronidase (BGUS). The development of new AGS and/or BGUS inhibitors may improve the therapeutic effects of T2DM and its complications. The present work focused on the isolation and characterization of AGS and/or BGUS inhibitors from the medicinal plant Schisandra sphaerandra. A total of eight compounds were isolated and identified. Sphaerandralide A (1) was obtained as a previously undescribed triterpenoid, which may have chemotaxonomy significance in the authentication of the genus Schisandra and Kadsura. 2'-acetyl-4',4-dimethoxybiphenyl-2-carbaldehyde (8) was obtained from a plant source for the first time, while compounds 2-7 were isolated from S. sphaerandra for the first time. In the in vitro assay, compounds 1-5 showed potent to moderate activity against AGS. Interestingly, compound 3 also exhibited significant BGUS inhibitory activity, demonstrating the potential of being developed as a bifunctional inhibitor that may find application in the therapy of T2DM and/or the diarrhea induced by medications for the treatment of T2DM complications."

We aimed to investigate whether Schisandra chinensis extract (SCE) can improve AH and the role of the small intestinal and cecal microbiota and their metabolites. UHPLC-QE-MS was used to analyze the chemical components of SCE. The chronic-plus-binge ethanol feeding model was used to induce AH in mice. 1H NMR was used to analyze intestinal metabolites. 16S rRNA-based high throughput sequencing was used to evaluate the effects of SCE on intestinal microbiota (IM). Intestinal microbiota transplantation was used to explore the role of IM in SCE treatment of AH. SCE ameliorated AH non-dose-dependently. SCE effectively improved liver inflammation and oxidative/nitrosative stress, strengthened intestinal barrier function, and regulated the composition of IM and the content of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) in AH mice. Samples from in vivo and in vitro SCE-altered IM improved liver status and regulated the IM. The administration of Lactobacillus plantarum and Bifidobacterium breve ameliorated AH to some extent. The administration of Enterococcus faecalis and Klebsiella oxytoca had partial beneficial effects on AH. Collectively, IM and metabolites were closely associated with the improvement of SCE on AH. The possible microbe targets were the growth inhibition of Escherichia-Shigella and the expansion of SCFA producers, such as Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium. Schisandra chinensis can be considered as a safe and effective dietary supplement for the prevention and improvement of AH."

To examine the anti-cancer activity of α-cubebenoate, we investigated its effects on the proliferation, apoptosis, and metastasis of CT26 cells. The viabilities of CT26 cells (a murine colorectal carcinoma cell line) and HCT116 cells (a human colon cancer cell line) were remarkably and dose-dependently diminished by α-cubebenoate, whereas the viability of CCD-18Co cells (a normal human fibroblast cell line) were unaffected. Furthermore, α-cubebenoate treatment increased the number of apoptotic CT26 cells as compared with Vehicle-treated cells and increased Bax, Bcl-2, Cas-3, and Cleaved Cas-3 protein levels by activating the MAP kinase signaling pathway. α-Cubebenoate also suppressed CT26 migration by regulating the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. Furthermore, similar reductions were observed in the expression levels of some migration-related proteins including VEGFA, MMP2, and MMP9. Furthermore, reduced VEGFA expression was found to be accompanied by the phosphorylations of FAK and MLC in the downstream signaling pathway of adhesion protein. The results of the present study provide novel evidence that α-cubebenoate can stimulate apoptosis and inhibit metastasis by regulating the MAPK, PI3K/AKT, and FAK/MLC signaling pathways.",

      "abstract": "Clinical studies have shown that insomnia and anxiety are usually accompanied by cardiovascular dysfunction. In traditional Chinese medicine, Schisandra chinensis (SC) and wine processed Schisandra chinensis (WSC) are mainly used for the treatment of dysphoria, palpitation and insomnia. However, little attention was paid to its mechanism. In this study, we monitored the effect of SC and WSC on the nervous system and cardiovascular system of free-moving rats in the real-time. Our results show that SC and WSC can alleviate cardiovascular dysfunction while promoting sleep, and we further explored their potential mechanisms. HPLC-QTOF-MS was used for the quality control of chemical components in SC and WSC. Data sciences international (DSI) physiological telemetry system was applied to collect the electroencephalogram (EEG), electrocardiogram (ECG) and other parameters of free-moving rats to understand the effects of long-term intake of SC and WSC on rats. The content of Cortisol (CORT), neurotransmitters and amino acids in rat pituitary and hypothalamus were analyzed by UPLC-MS to determine the activity of HPA axis. The expression of melatonin receptor MT1 was analyzed by immunofluorescence technique. Our results suggested that SC and WSC may play the role of promoting sleep by increasing the expression level of melatonin receptor MT1 in hypothalamus, and modulate the activity of HPA axis by regulating the levels of the related neurotransmitters and amino acid, so as to improve the abnormal cardiovascular system of rats. This study may provide theoretical support for explicating the advantages of SC and other phytomedicines in the treatment of insomnia.",

To identify the novel functions of α-cubebenol on lipid metabolism, alterations on the regulation of lipogenesis, lipolysis, and inflammatory response were observed in 3T3-L1 adipocytes treated with α-cubebenol. Most lipogenic targets, including lipid accumulation, level of lipogenic transcription factors, and expression of lipogenic regulators, were suppressed in MDI (3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, dexamethasone, and insulin)-stimulated 3T3-L1 adipocytes treated with α-cubebenol without significant cytotoxicity. In addition, similar inhibition effects were observed in the iNOS-induced COX-2 mediated pathway and NLRP3 inflammasome pathway of MDI-stimulated 3T3-L1 cells treated with α-cubebenol. Lipolytic targets, such as cAMP concentration, expression of adenylyl cyclase and PDE4, and their downstream signaling pathway, in MDI-stimulated 3T3-L1 cells were stimulated by the α-cubebenol treatment. The levels of transcription factors and related proteins for β-oxidation were significantly higher in the MDI + α-cubebenol treated group than in the MDI + Vehicle treated group. These results show that α-cubebenol has a novel role as a lipogenesis inhibitor, lipolysis and β-oxidation stimulator, and inflammasome suppressor in MDI-stimulated 3T3-L1 adipocytes.",

      "abstract": "ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Schisandra chinensis (called bei-wuweizi in Chinese, S. chinensis) and Schisandra sphenanthera (called nan-wuweizi in Chinese, S. sphenanthera) are two highly similar plants in the Magnoliaceae family. Their dried ripe fruits are commonly used as traditional Chinese medicine in the treatment of coughs, palpitation, spermatorrhea, and insomnia. They also are traditionally used as tonics in Russia, Japan, and Korea. AIM OF THE REVIEW: S. chinensis and S. sphenanthera are similar in appearance, traditional applications, ingredient compositions, and therapeutic effects. This review, therefore, aims to provide a systematic insight into the botanical background, ethnopharmacology, phytochemistry, pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, quality control, and toxicology of S. chinensis and S. sphenanthera, and to explore and present the similarities and differences between S. chinensis and S. sphenanthera. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A comprehensive literature search regarding S. chinensis and S. sphenanthera was collected by using electronic databases including PubMed, SciFinder, Science Direct, Web of Science, CNKI, and the online ethnobotanical database. RESULTS: In the 2020 Edition of Chinese Pharmacopoeia (ChP), there were 100 prescriptions containing S. chinensis, while only 11 contained S. sphenanthera. Totally, 306 and 238 compounds have been isolated and identified from S. chinensis and S. sphenanthera, respectively. Among these compounds, lignans, triterpenoids, essential oils, phenolic acid, flavonoids, phytosterols are the major composition. Through investigation of pharmacological activities, S. chinensis and S. sphenanthera have similar therapeutic effects including hepatoprotection, neuroprotection, cardioprotection, anticancer, antioxidation, anti-inflammation, and hypoglycemic effect. Besides, S. chinensis turns out to have more effects including reproductive regulation and immunomodulatory, antimicrobial, antitussive and antiasthmatic, anti-fatigue, antiarthritic, and bone remodeling effects. Both S. chinensis and S. sphenanthera have inhibitory effects on CYP3A and P-gp, which can mediate metabolism or efflux of substrates, and therefore interact with many drugs. CONCLUSIONS: S. chinensis and S. sphenanthera have great similarities. Dibenzocyclooctadiene lignans are regarded to contribute to most of the bioactivities. Schisandrin A-C, schisandrol A-B, and schisantherin A, existing in both S. chinensis and S. sphenanthera but differing in the amount, are the main active components, which may contribute to the similarities and differences. Study corresponding to the traditional use is needed to reveal the deep connotation of the use of S. chinensis and S. sphenanthera as traditional Chinese medicine. In addition, a joint study of S. chinensis and S. sphenanthera can better show the difference between them, which can provide a reference for clinical application. It is worth mentioning that the inhibition of S. chinensis and S. sphenanthera on CYP3A and P-gp may lead to undesirable drug-drug interactions.",

      "abstract": "AIMS: Due to poor targeting ability of anti-tumor drugs and self-adaptation of tumors, the chemotherapy of ovarian cancer is still poorly effective. In recent years, the treatment of tumor with nano-targeted agents has become a potential research focus. In this study, a new type of short cell-penetrating peptide RPV-modified paclitaxel plus schisandrin B liposomes were constructed to disrupt VM channels, angiogenesis, proliferation and migration for the treatment of ovarian cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this study, clone assay, TUNEL, Transwell, wound-healing, CAM and mimics assay were used to detect the effects of RPV-modified liposomes on ovarian cancer SK-OV-3 cells before and after treatment. HE-staining, immunofluorescence and ELISA were used to further detect the expression of tumor-related proteins. KEY FINDINGS: RPV-modified paclitaxel plus schisandrin B liposomes can inhibit angiogenesis, VM channel formation, invasion and proliferation of ovarian SK-OV-3 cells. In vitro and in vivo studies showed that tumor-related protein expression was down-regulated. Modification of RPV can prolong the retention time of liposome in vivo and accumulate in the tumor site, increasing the anti-tumor efficacy. SIGNIFICANCE: The RPV-modified paclitaxel plus schisandrin B liposomes have good anti-tumor effect, thus may provide a new avenue for the treatment of ovarian cancer.",

      "abstract": "Schisandra chinensis (Turcz.) Baill Fructus (SCF) is the ripe fruit of Schisandra chinensis (Turcz.) Baill, and is often used as a neuroprotective drink. Modern pharmacological studies have shown that lignans are the main bioactive components responsible for neuroprotection and have potential in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the mechanism of action of SCF in the treatment of AD from the pharmacokinetics-pharmacodynamics (PK-PD) perspective remains not well established. The purpose of this study is to investigate and compare the pharmacokinetic differences of lignans in normal and AD rats, as well as to investigate their effects on neurotransmitters and their role in the treatment of AD. To achieve this goal, an integrated strategy using LC-MS/MS combined with in vivo microdialysis for the simultaneous determination of lignans of SCF and endogenous neurotransmitters has been developed and validated. The results show that the pharmacokinetic behaviors of ten lignans in the AD group were significantly different from those in the normal group. The AD group had better absorption and slower elimination than the normal group. In addition, the pharmacodynamic results of the Morris water maze (MWM) test, biochemical tests, histopathological examination, as well as immunohistochemistry analysis showed that lignans could improve the learning and memory of AD rats. The oral administration of SCF could restore the levels of the neurotransmitter parameters; seven neurotransmitters showed clockwise or counterclockwise changes with the four lignans in the hippocampal region. Taken together, the PK and PD studies based on in vivo microdialysis sampling might offer novel insights into the mechanisms of action of SCF against AD.",

      "abstract": "Schisandra chinensis (Turcz.) Baill (SC) and Lycium chinense Mill. (LC) are widely distributed in Asia, where the fruit has traditionally been used for medicinal herbs. We previously reported that the roasting process improved the antioxidant and their hangover relieving effects. In this study, we assessed the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects of water extract of SC, LC, and a mass ratio 1 : 1 mixture (SL), after roasting in RAW264.7 macrophage cells stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Roasted SL (RSL) extracts showed greater enhancement potential than the others, based on the inhibition of NO (nitric oxide) and intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in RAW264.7 cells. RSL also significantly decreased the proinflammatory markers (e.g., iNOS, COX-2, TNF-α, and IL-1β) and NAD(P)H oxidase (NOX) signaling proteins (i.e., NOX (-1, -2, and -4), p22phox, p47phox, and p67phox). The inflammatory cytokine, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interferon-1 beta levels, NF-kB, and mitogen-activated kinase activations were also significantly inhibited by RSL treatment. Based on the results of cellular levels, we compared the promotion effects of RSL extract on liver injury mediated by alcohol-induced inflammation and oxidative stress in mice. Mice were fed a Lieber-DeCarli regular liquid alcohol diet with or without SL and RSL extracts for six weeks. Alcohol intake caused liver injury, evidenced by an increase in serum alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase activities. Consistent with the results in cell levels, RSL treatment remarkably downregulated ROS and inflammatory factors, as well as their signaling molecules, in serum and tissues. These results suggest that the roasting of SC and LC could potentially elevate the inhibition effect on alcohol-induced inflammation and oxidative stress and consequently prevent alcoholic liver damage. Also, the combination of SC and LC may provide a more synergistic effect than either alone."

The active components of S. chinensis were found through Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology Database and Analysis Platform (TCMSP) and their corresponding targets were predicted. The targets of liver injury were searched through Therapeutic Targets Database (TTD), DisGeNET and drugbank databases, and the Venn diagram was constructed to obtain the action targets. The \"drug-active component-target\" network and protein-protein interaction network (PPI) were constructed by using STRING database and Cytoscape software, and the key targets were further screened by the enrichment analysis of relevant KEGG pathways. Finally, a CCl4-induced mouse liver injury model was established to verify the efficacy and related targets of S. chinensis and clarify its mechanism. Eight active components and 56 related targets of S. chinensis were screened out based on their oral bioavailability (OB) and drug likeness (DL). Five targets of S. chinensis related to liver injury were found by using the Venn diagram. The key targets, namely Ptgs2 and Nos2 genes, were further screened out by constructing a PPI network, and Schisandrol B (SCB) was considered the key component most closely related to the liver injury in S. chinensis. The results indicate that SCB may play a role in the treatment of the CCl4-induced liver injury by down-regulating the expression of iNOS and COX-2, and regulating the expression of NF-κB and IL-17 signaling pathway to inhibit the expression of proinflammatory factors.",

However, there are few basic studies on the treatment of respiratory diseases with S. chinensis in modern pharmacology, and the material basis and mechanism of its antiasthmatic effect are still unclear. Lignans are the main active components of S. chinensis. The aim of this study was to observe the relaxation effect of S. chinensis lignans (SCL) on the tracheal smooth muscle of rats by in vitro tracheal perfusion experiments, and to explore the mechanism by preincubation with L-type calcium channel blocker verapamil, four potassium channel blockers glibenclamide, tetraethylamine, 4-aminopyridine and barium chloride (BaCl2), β-adrenoceptor blocker propranolol, nitric oxide synthase inhibitor Nω-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME), and the cyclooxygenase inhibitor indomethacin, respectively. The results showed that SCL (0.25-1.75 mg/mL) reduced the contraction of isolated tracheal smooth muscle induced by acetylcholine, the preincubation with verapamil and glibenclamide could attenuate the relaxation effect, whereas propranolol, 4-aminopyridine, BaCl2, tetraethylamine, L-NAME, and indomethacin had no such effect. These results suggest that SCL has a significant relaxation effect on the isolated tracheal smooth muscle of rats, and the mechanism may be related to the inhibition of extracellular calcium influx and intracellular calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, as well as the activation of ATP-sensitive potassium channels. These findings may provide a pharmacological basis for the traditional use of S. chinensis to treat asthma.",

To predict the targets of active ingredients on RRTI, TCMSP, Pubmed, OMIM, Drug Bank, GAD and TTD database were used. The compounds-therapeutic target network was constructed with Cytoscape 3.7.2 software. The STRING database was used to construct a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network, and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis was used to identify potential signal pathways. RESULTS: The 3 main active ingredients of Modified Ginseng-Schisandra Decoction obtained by screening were quercetin, kaempferol, and isoflavone; the main therapeutic targets were PTGS2, ESR1, AR, PPARG, NOS2, and others. Based on the PPI network, we found that the targets of Modified Ginseng-Schisandra Decoction were significantly enriched in (FDR <0.01) cancer pathway, tumor necrosis factor (TNF) signaling pathway, hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF-1) signaling pathway, and others. CONCLUSIONS: Modified Ginseng-Schisandra Decoction can treat RRTI primarily through acting in the signal transduction of some key nodes of cancer pathway and TNF pathway. It exerts a direct or indirect influence on multiple signaling pathways, and has the characteristics of multicomponent, multitarget, and multichannel action."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Recurrent respiratory tract infection (RRTI) is common disease in childhood, and the incidence rate is increasing in China. The cause is complex, which is related to the physiological characteristics of children's respiratory system and the immature immune function, lack of trace elements and environmental pollution. Immunomodulators and antibiotics are often used to treat RRTI, but the clinical efficacy still needs to be improved. Chinese medicine has unique advantages in the treatment of RRTI. In the clinical treatment of RRTI, the authors often use modified Ginseng-Schisandra decoction (MGSD). In order to study the clinical effect of MGSD on serum trace elements and immune function in children with spleen deficiency syndrome after RRTI, we conducted this clinical observation. METHODS: This is a single-center randomized trial with two parallel groups. Eighty children who developed spleen deficiency syndrome following RRTI were randomly and equally divided into a control group and an observation group. The control group was given Medilac-vita and the observation group was given MGSD. The participants, care givers, and those assessing the outcomes were blinded to group assignment. The treatment course was 4 weeks. Clinical efficacy, traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) syndrome scores, humoral immunity, and trace element index values before and after treatment were compared between the two groups of children. RESULTS: The trial was finished. The total effective rate of the observation group (n=40, 95%) was significantly higher than control group (n=40, 65%) (P<0.05). After treatment, the TCM syndrome scores of the two groups were reduced compared to those before treatment, while the serum immunoglobulin A and G levels were increased (P<0.05); however, the observation group had significantly lower TCM syndrome scores than the control group. Significant improvements in serum immunoglobulins (IgA and IgG) levels, T lymphocyte subsets (CD3+, CD4+, and CD4+/CD8+), and trace elements (Zn and Fe) indicators were observed in the observation group compared to the control group (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The application of MGSD in the treatment of children with spleen deficiency syndrome after RRTI has a definite clinical effect. MGSD can effectively improve the immune function of the patients and the content of the trace elements iron and zinc, and thus has potential value for promotion and application.

Schisandra chinensis polysaccharides (SCP), the primary active constituent in Schisandra chinensis, have antioxidative properties. Here, we investigated the role played by SCP in a cardiac hypertrophy model mouse induced by transverse aortic constriction (TAC). We found that SCP treatment improved cardiac function by inhibiting myocardial hypertrophy and oxidative stress. Angiotensin II was used to induce cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and oxidative stress in vitro. We discovered that the antioxidant effects of SCP were mediated through the regulation of the thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP)/Thioredoxin-1 (Trx-1) pathway. Using molecular docking, we found that SCP binds to Arg207, Ser169, Lys166, Lys286 and Ser285 in TXNIP through hydrogen bonds. TXNIP is an endogenous inhibitor of Trx-1, and the binding SCP with TXNIP may restrict or interfere with the binding between TXNIP and Trx-1, resulting in Trx-1 activation. In conclusion, our findings demonstrated that the potential use of SCP as a TXNIP inhibitor to attenuate oxidative stress, suggesting that TXNIP might represent a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of cardiac hypertrophy.",

The study result showed that the brain pathologic symptoms of model rats were improved and the potential biomarkers were adjusted backward significantly after the herb pair administration. The metabolic pathways linked to the herb pair-regulated endogenous biomarkers included phenylalanine and tyrosine metabolism, tryptophan metabolism, purine metabolism, and so on. The above metabolic pathways reflected that Radix ginseng-Schisandra chinensis herb pair mainly regulates abnormal energy metabolism, reduces inflammation, and regulates gut microbiota and neurotransmitters in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.",

Herein, we aimed to investigate the potential neuroprotective role of Schisandra chinensis (Sch) and to determine the mechanism by which Sch functions to ameliorate PD in a 6-hydroxydopamin (6-OHDA)-induced PD model. The open field test, sucrose preference test, and Y-maze test were utilized to evaluate the motor and nonmotor symptoms. We found that administration of Sch improved both disorders and DA neurodegeneration in 6-OHDA-induced mice. Additional data confirmed that Sch treatment significantly increased BDNF expression and decreased the activity of GSK-3β in the striatum and hippocampus. Moreover, Sch was able to alleviate the abnormal levels of ROS and increase SOD by boosting Nrf2 expression. The nuclear translocation of NF-κB was inhibited by Sch, which subsequently led to a downregulation of proinflammatory cytokines. Sch effectively suppressed apoptosis by decreasing expressions of caspase 3, caspase 9, and p53 in the PD mouse model. Our findings demonstrate that Sch protects against DA neurodegeneration in 6-OHDA-induced PD mice by suppressing oxidative stress, neuroinflammation and apoptosis through the involvement of the BDNF/Nrf2/NF-κB signaling pathway.",

OBJECTIVES: We aimed to examine the effects and safety of consumption of Sc extract (SCe) for 12 wk on muscle strength and mass in older adults with relatively low muscle mass who do low-intensity exercise. METHODS: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was performed in adults >50 y of age. Fifty-four participants were randomly assigned into 2 groups and, for 12 wk, received either 1 g SCe/d or a placebo. All participants were required to walk for 30-60 min/d for >3 d/wk during the trial period. At baseline and at 4 and 12 wk after treatment, the participants were examined for knee extension strength using Biodex isokinetic dynamometers, handgrip strengths, and body composition, and blood tests were performed. The Euro-QoL-5D (EQ-5D) questionnaire and the FFQ were administered at baseline and at 12 wk after treatment. Physical activity was assessed using a self-recorded daily exercise log and an accelerometer during the study. RESULTS: SCe supplementation over 12 wk caused a higher increase in right knee extensor strength by 10.2 Nm (95% CI: 3.7, 16.8 Nm; P = 0.003) and left knee extensor strength by 6.7 Nm (95% CI: 0.3, 13.1 Nm; P = 0.041) than did the placebo. However, no differences were observed in the muscle mass, anti-inflammatory markers, antioxidative markers, and EQ-5D score between the groups. None of the participants experienced adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: SCe supplementation may enhance skeletal muscle strength but not mass in older adults who perform low-intensity exercise. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT03402308.",

However, little is known about how SCE and schisandrin B (SchB) affect transcriptional output-a crucial factor for shaping the fibrotic responses of the transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) signaling pathways in in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC). In this study, to assess the pharmacological effect of SCE and SchB on TGFβ-induced transcriptional output, we performed DNA microarray experiments in A7r5 VSMCs. We found that TGFβ induced distinctive changes in the gene expression profile and that these changes were considerably reversed by SCE and SchB. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) with Hallmark signature suggested that SCE or SchB inhibits a range of fibrosis-associated biological processes, including inflammation, cell proliferation and migration. With our VSMC-specific transcriptional interactome network, master regulator analysis identified crucial transcription factors that regulate the expression of SCE- and SchB-effective genes (i.e., TGFβ-reactive genes whose expression are reversed by SCE and SchB). Our results provide novel perspective and insight into understanding the pharmacological action of SCE and SchB at the transcriptome level and will support further investigations to develop multitargeted strategies for the treatment of vascular fibrosis."

Inhibition of these enzymes with small molecule inhibitors may restore therapeutic sensitivity. Here, we demonstrated ubiquitin conjugating enzyme UbcH5b strongly supports HECTD3 auto-ubiquitination in vitro. Based on this, we developed a Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) assay and identified three Schisandraceae triterpenoids, including PC3-15, to block HECTD3/UbcH5b auto-ubiquitination. Furthermore, we revealed that PC3-15 directly binds to UbcH5b and also inhibits UbcH5b-mediated p62 ubiquitination. We found that the UbcH5b-p62 axis confers TNBC cells resistance to lapatinib by promoting autophagy. Consistently, PC3-15 inhibits lapatinib-induced autophagy and increases lapatinib sensitivity in TNBC in vitro and in mouse xenografts. These findings suggest that the UbcH5b-p62 axis provides potential therapeutic targets and that Schisandraceae triterpenoids may be used for TNBC treatment in combination with lapatinib.",

The possible structure of SCPP22 was showed that its main chain was composed of 1,4-α-d-Glup and branch was stretched from O-6 position of 1,4-β-d-Glup. Branches consisted of T-α-d-Galp. Further, SCPP22 could reverse PCB126-induced immunosuppression, significantly enhance body weight and immune organ indices. It also significantly ameliorated oxidative injury to immune organ induced by PCB126, as shown by evaluation of SOD activities, as well as MDA levels in spleen and thymus. SCPP22 strongly stimulated cytokines production by up-regulating mRNA expression of TNF-α, INF-γ and IL-2. Mechanism investigation revealed that recovery effects of SCPP22 in immunosuppression induced by PCB126 are mainly through regulating apoptosis-related proteins expression.

      "abstract": "Cell membrane chromatography (CMC) is effective and widely used in drug screening, especially for the analysis of complex matrixes. However, it is time-consuming and costly given that cells or animals are employed for activity confirmation, which leads to a large amount of waste being produced if the result is negative. Stepwise frontal analysis is employed to saturate the affinity stationary phase, by using a series of low- to high-concentration solutions which resultantly form a staircase pattern. In doing so, the waste of samples, caused by the balancing process, can be avoided. In this study, stepwise frontal analysis coupled with a CMC system was performed for screening and characterizing the affinity of an active compound from wuweizi. Schizandrin A was screened and identified by α1A AR /CMC coupled with UHPLC-MS/MS. By comparing the values obtained with those related to the equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) calculated by zonal elution, the accuracy of the stepwise frontal analysis was verified. Subsequently, the type of affinity force between Schizandrin A and α1A AR was studied by thermodynamic parameters. Moreover, schizandrin A showed an antagonistic effect on phenylephrine-induced contractions, which relax prostate muscle strips in a non-competitive antagonism manner. It has already suggested that the active compound, schizandrin A, could be used as a lead compound for the treatment of benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) and should be further studied. Thus, the findings of this study are significant given that they could result in an online screening and affinity analysis method being utilized for the discovery of medicinal compounds as well as clarify the interaction characteristics between a drug and a receptor.",

However, the pharmacokinetic interactions between VCZ and WZ as well as its bioactive constituents, such as schisandrin A and schisandrol B, remain unknown. Therefore, the effects of WZ and the two lignans on the metabolism of VCZ and the potential role of cytochromeP450 (CYP450), especially cytochrome P450 2C19 (CYP2C19), were investigated. The results showed that WZ extensively inhibited the activities of CYP1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, and 3A4. Noteworthy, 2.5 mg/mL WZ almost completely inhibited the activity of 2C19, and the inhibition ratio reached 78.6±3% and 63.5±4.6% for schisandrin A and schisandrol B at concentrations 100 μM, respectively. In addition, rats were treated with a single or consecutive 14 day oral dose of WZ (250 mg/kg), schisandrol B (10 mg/kg) and schisandrin A (10 mg/ kg). In rats treated with WZ, the AUC0-∞ value for intravenous VCZ dosing was increased by 80.2% (single dose, p < 0.05) and 66.4% (dosage for 14 day, p < 0.05) and the Cmax was increased by 10.5% (p < 0.05) and (20.6%, p < 0.05), respectively, much greater than that when VCZ (28 mg/kg) was given alone. Unexpectedly, the AUC and Cmax values after schisandrol B and schisandrin A treatment were significantly increased. However, the mRNA expression of liver CYP2C19 and the protein expression of liver CYP2C19 were surprisingly increased after treatment with WZ, schisandrol B and schisandrin A in rats. Therefore, attention should be paid to when WZ and VCZ are administered concomitantly, as dosage adjustment might become necessary. Further clinical study is warranted to validate the interaction between WZ and VCZ.",

      "abstract": "Background: The pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is linked to an intricate association of environmental, microbial, and host-related factors. Polysaccharide affects host immunity by regulating the composition and metabolism of gut microbiota is the common mechanism of disease resistance. However, the efficacy and mechanism of Schisandra chinensis polysaccharide (SCP) in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease have not been studied. Objective: To explore the effect and mechanism of SCP on dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) - induced ulcerative colitis (UC) in mice. Materials/Methods: In this study, we established a mouse model of UC, and used SCP for treatment intervention. The biochemical indexes related to inflammation were determined by ELISA kit, and the therapeutic effect of SCP on UC was clarified. Then, 16S rDNA sequencing was used to study the effect of SCP on the composition and diversity of gut microbiota. At the same time, GC-MS was used to determine the content of short chain fatty acids in intestinal contents. Finally, the relationship among gut microbiota, short chain fatty acids and inflammatory factors was analyzed, and to comprehensively explain the effect and mechanism of SCP on UC. Results: The results showed that SCP could significantly improve the physiological state of UC mice and regulate the level of inflammatory factors to normal levels. Meanwhile, SCP could significantly regulate the imbalance of gut microbiota and increase the content of SCFAs. In addition, the results of the correlation between gut microbiota and SCFAs showed that butyric acid, isobutyric acid and valeric acid had the highest correlation with gut microbiota. Conclusion: In conclusion, this research showed that SCP can inhibit inflammatory bowel disease by regulating the composition and metabolism of gut microbiota, and indicating that SCP may be used as adjuvant therapy for IBD patients.",

      "abstract": "The efficacy of α-cubebenoate isolated from Schisandra chinensis has been previously studied in three disease areas, namely inflammation, sepsis, and allergy, and its role in other diseases is still being explored. To identify the novel function of α-cubebenoate on lipid metabolism and related inflammatory response, alterations in fat accumulation, lipogenesis, lipolysis, and inflammasome activation were measured in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes and primary adipocytes treated with α-cubebenoate. Lipid accumulation significantly decreased in MDI (3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, dexamethasone, and insulin)-stimulated 3T3-L1 adipocytes treated with α-cubebenoate without any significant cytotoxicity. The mRNA levels of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)γ and CCAAT-enhancer binding protein (C/EBP) α for adipogenesis, as well as adipocyte fatty acid binding protein 2 (aP2) and fatty acid synthetase (FAS) for lipogenesis, were reduced after α-cubebenoate treatment, while cell cycle arrest at G2/M stage was restored in the same group. α-cubebenoate treatment induced glycerol release in primary adipocytes and enhanced expression of lipolytic proteins (HSL, perilipin, and ATGL) expression in MDI-stimulated 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Inflammasome activation and downstream cytokines expression were suppressed with α-cubebenoate treatment, but the expression of insulin receptor signaling factors was remarkably increased by α-cubebenoate treatment in MDI-stimulated 3T3-L1 adipocytes. These results indicate that α-cubebenoate may play a novel role as lipogenesis inhibitor, lipolysis stimulator, and inflammasome suppressor in MDI-stimulated 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Our results provide the possibility that α-cubebenoate can be considered as one of the candidates for obesity management.",

      "abstract": "ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: In traditional Chinese medicine, the fruit of Schisandra chinensis (Turcz.) Baill (SC) is used to treat various nervous system diseases, such as dysphoria, anxiety, insomnia and many dreams. It is worthy to be noted that wine processed Schisandra chinensis (WSC) has been applied in clinic for thousands of years. AIM OF STUDY: This study aimed to investigate the possible mechanism and related metabolism of SC and WSC ameliorating anxiety behavior through modulating gut microbiota. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The ultra-performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-QTOF-MS) was used for the quality control of chemical components in SC and WSC. Chronic unpredictable stress procedure (CUSP)-induced anxiety rats were administrated with SC and WSC via gavage for five weeks. An untargeted UPLC/LTQ-Orbitrap MS metabolomic analysis of plasma was conducted to understand the effects of long-term intake of WSC and SC extracts on anxious rats. 16S rRNA microbial sequencing technology was applied to investigate gut microbiota structure. Expression of GPR81, TNF-α, S1PR2 as well as molecules in cAMP pathway was assayed by immunohistochemistry staining, RT-qPCR, or Western blot, respectively. RESULTS: 12 compounds were identified using UPLC-QTOF-MS technology, all of which are lignans. Results demonstrate that the amounts of 6-O-Benzoylgomisin O, Schisandrin, Gomisin D, Schizandrin A, Gomisin T, Schizandrin B, Schisandrin C were higher in wine-processed samples than in raw samples. Furthermore, both SC and WSC significantly ameliorated anxiety- and depression-like behavior and lipid metabolism dysfunction and attenuated hippocampal neuritis in anxiety rats. After WSC treatment, the structure and composition of gut microbiota in anxiety rats changed significantly, and gut microbiota derivatives lactate level was significantly lower in the plasma and feces. WSC treatment help restore gut microbial ecosystem dysbiosis and reverse the changes in Lachnospiraceae, Lactobacillus, Alloprevotella, and Bacteroidales in anxiety rat. In addition, the expression of liver GPR81 was decreased, and the molecules in cAMP pathway were increased in SC and WSC-treated anxiety rat. CONCLUSION: Raw and wine processed Schisandra chinensis treatment improved anxiety- and depression-like behavior through modulating gut microbiota derivatives in association with GPR81 receptor-mediated lipid metabolism pathway. And WSC has more exhibition than SC.",

      "abstract": "Hyperlipidemia and its associated obesity, hepatic steatosis, and NAFLD are worldwide problems. However, there is no ideal pharmacological treatment for these. Therefore, the complementary therapies that are both natural and safe have been focused. Healthy foods, such as fruit vinegar, may be one of the best choices. In this study, we made a special medicinal fruit vinegar, Schisandra fruit vinegar (SV), and examined its lipid-lowering effects and the underlying mechanisms in a high-fat diet rat model. The results showed that SV significantly reduced the body weight, liver weight, liver index, the serum triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), free fatty acid (FFA), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and malondialdehyde (MDA), increased the content of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD), upregulated the expressions of peroxisome proliferative activated receptor (PPAR-α), peroxisomal acyl-coenzyme A oxidase 1 (ACOX1), and carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT1) proteins, increased the contents of key component of antioxidant defense NF-E2-related factor 2 (NRF2) and its downstream heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) protein, and downregulated the expression of Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (KEAP1). These results suggest that SV has weight loss and lipid-lowering effects in HFD rats, which may be related to its upregulation of the expressions of β-oxidation -elated PPAR-α, CPT1, and ACOX1 and the regulation of the expressions of antioxidant pathway-related KEAP1-NRF2-HO-1. Therefore, all these data provide an experimental basis for the development of SV as a functional beverage which is safe, effective, convenient, and inexpensive."
