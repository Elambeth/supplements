      "abstract": "UNLABELLED: We aimed to investigate the potential effects of Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet on adiposity indices in children with overweight and obesity. This study was a triple-blind, randomized controlled trial. Sixty girls and boys (aged 8-12 years) were randomly assigned to either DASH diet or control group, and the intervention duration was 8 weeks. Body weight (BW), height, waist circumference (WC), skinfold thickness (SFT), neck circumference (NC), body mass index (BMI), waist-to-height ratio (WHtR), body round index (BRI), and weight-adjusted waist index (WWI) were assessed before and after the intervention. The primary analysis was conducted on a per-protocol basis, including only participants who completed at least two visits and adhered to the study protocol. This approach was chosen to ensure that the results reflect the actual effects of the intervention among compliant participants. Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was used to compare after treatment adiposity indices between groups. Mean ± SD age and BMI of the participants was 11.8 ± 0.8 years (69% were girls) and 25.9 ± 3.52 kg/m2, respectively. A total of 58 patients (n = 29 in DASH group and n = 29 in control group) who completed at least two visits and adhered to the study protocol were included in the final per-protocol analysis. Two participants (one from each group) were lost to follow-up and excluded from the analysis due to incomplete data. After 8 weeks, the DASH group had a significantly lower BW (59.5 vs. 62.6 kg), WC (84.3 vs. 85.5 cm), NC (32.9 vs. 33.3 cm), SFT (3.57 vs. 3.57 cm), BMI (25.9 vs. 25.9 kg/m2), WHtR (0.55 vs. 0.56), BRI (4.57 vs. 4.75), and WWI (10.42 vs. 10.84 cm/√kg) compared with the controls (P for all < 0.01). The mean change percent of adiposity indices was higher in the control than the DASH group (P for all < 0.05); however, for the WWI, a significant reduction was observed in the DASH group. CONCLUSION: Adherence to DASH diet may be an effective approach for obesity management in children who are overweight and obese. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Our study was registered with IRCT.IR ( https://irct.behdasht.gov.ir ) under the identifier IRCT20240623062229N1 on 30 June 2024. WHAT IS KNOWN: • The DASH diet is effective in improving cardiovascular health and metabolic outcomes in adults, but its impact on adiposity indices in children with overweight/obesity remains understudied. • Previous studies on the DASH diet in pediatric populations have yielded inconsistent results, with some showing  benefits in weight management and others reporting neutral effects. WHAT IS NEW: • This first triple-blind randomized controlled trial demonstrates that an 8-week DASH diet intervention significantly reduces multiple adiposity indices (body weight, waist circumference, BMI, and novel indices like WWI and BRI) in children with overweight/obesity. • The study highlights the DASH diet's potential as a practical, non-restrictive dietary strategy for pediatric obesity management, with benefits observed even without caloric restriction.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The Mediterranean and Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diets have been shown to slow cognitive decline. However, these diets were not originally developed with dementia prevention as their primary focus. In contrast, the Mediterranean-DASH Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay (MIND) diet was specifically designed based on evidence linking individual dietary components to brain health and the prevention of cognitive decline. The aim of this research was to test the effectiveness of the MIND diet on cognitive function, mood, and quality of life using the Behaviour Change Wheel, and to design an intervention using the COM-B model to promote the MIND diet at midlife. METHODS: An online pilot randomised control trial (RCT) was conducted. Forty-one participants (aged 40-55 years, male and female) were randomised into a MIND diet with support group (n = 15), MIND diet group with no support (n = 14) or control group (n = 12) for 12 weeks. Baseline and follow-up measures of cognitive function, mood, quality of life (QOL) and adherence to MIND diet was assessed in each group. Capability, opportunity, and motivation (COM-B) towards MIND diet behaviour were also assessed pre and post intervention. RESULTS: A repeated measures ANOVA showed that in comparison to the control group, both intervention groups significantly improved mood, quality of life, MIND diet score and all COM-B components at follow-up (p < 0.05). No significant differences or interactions in cognitive function were found between groups. CONCLUSION: There are only two RCT's that test the effectiveness of the MIND diet on cognitive function, and this is the first RCT to assess the usefulness of the COM-B in increasing adherence to the MIND diet. Future interventions with longer duration are needed to establish an association with MIND diet and cognitive function in adults at midlife. This study recommends using less Behaviour Change Techniques (BCTs) with a focus on self-monitoring, goal setting and education on diet as an effective strategy for promoting adherence to the MIND diet.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The rising prevalence of youth depression underscores the need to identify modifiable factors for prevention and intervention. This study aims to investigate the protective role of Mediterranean-DASH Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay (MIND) diet on depressive symptoms in adolescents. METHODS: Participants were identified from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development study. Adherence to the MIND diet was measured by the Child Nutrition Assessment or the Block Kids Food Screener. Depressive symptoms were measured annually using the Child Behavior Checklist's depression subscale. We utilized regression analyses and cross-lagged panel modeling (CLPM) to examine longitudinal associations. Additional analyses adjusted for polygenic risk scores for depression, and changes in Body Mass Index (BMI) and waist-to-height ratio. RESULTS: Of the 8459 children (52.3 % male; mean age 10.9 [SD, 0.6] years), 2338 (27.6 %) demonstrated high MIND diet adherence, while 2120 (25.1 %) showed low adherence. High adherence was prospectively associated with reduced depressive symptoms (adjusted β, -0.64, 95 % CI, -0.73 to -0.55; p < 0.001) and 46 % lower odds of clinically relevant depression (adjusted odds ratio, 0.54, 95 % CI, 0.39 to 0.75; p < 0.001) at two-year follow-up. CLPM analyses showed significant cross-lag paths from MIND diet scores to less depressive symptoms across three time points. These associations persisted independently of changes in BMI and waist-to-height ratios, and were not significantly moderated by genetic predisposition to depression. CONCLUSIONS: Higher adherence to the MIND dietary pattern was longitudinally associated with decreased risk of depressive symptoms in adolescents. Promoting MIND diet may represent a promising strategy for depression prevention in adolescent populations.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: In the management of hypertension lifestyle changes are recommended along with pharmacological treatment. METHODS: This randomized controlled intervention study aimed to compare the effects of a dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) diet and a salt-free diet on blood pressure in hypertension patients. This study was conducted with 60 patients with primary hypertension. One group (n = 30) was given an individualized DASH diet, the other group was given a salt-free diet (n = 30), and the participants were followed for 2-months. The patients' blood pressures were monitored daily throughout the study, and their biochemical parameters were monitored at the beginning of the study, in the first and second months. RESULTS: At the end of the second month, there was no difference between the 2 groups in terms of diastolic blood pressure, while the systolic blood pressure (SBP) of the salt-free diet group (121.03 ± 9.73 mm Hg) was statistically significantly lower than the DASH diet group (126.81 ± 8.91 mm Hg) (P = .021). CONCLUSION: The salt-free diet was more efficient than for lowering SBP. However, the fact that sodium and soluble fiber intakes in the DASH diet group were higher than those in the salt-free diet group at the end of the first month, unlike at the beginning (P < .05), suggests that restricting the salt content of the DASH diet in hypertension could lead to more favorable outcomes on blood pressure, considering its suitability for a healthy diet.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Hearing loss poses a significant global public health concern associated with cognitive decline. Among the many risk factors associated with Alzheimer's disease and related dementia (ADRD), hearing loss is the most prevalent sensory impairment in older adults and has emerged as a significant, yet often overlooked, modifiable risk factor for dementia. OBJECTIVES: To access 1) the association between diet and risk of hearing loss in older adults and 2) the modifying effect of diet on the impact of hearing loss on cognitive decline in an aging population. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study SETTING: The Chicago Health and Aging Project, a community-based cohort study PARTICIPANTS: A total of 5,145 older adults (62 % non-Hispanic Black, 63 % female). MEASUREMENTS: Self-reported hearing ability was assessed during each cycle of data collection. Diet was assessed by a 144-item Food Frequency Questionnaire. Diet quality was evaluated using a 144-item Food Frequency Questionnaire, focusing on adherence to dietary patterns such as Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH), Mediterranean, and Mediterranean-DASH Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay (MIND). Cognitive function assessment was conducted during the in-home visits at each cycle. Four cognitive tests, including the East Boston tests of immediate and delayed recall, the mini-mental State Examination, and the Symbol Digit Modalities test, were included. We used linear mixed effect models to examine 1) the association of hearing loss and cognitive decline and 2) the association of diet on cognitive decline through modifying risk hearing loss. Discrete-time survival analysis examined the association between dietary patterns and the time to hearing impairment. RESULTS: Among 5,145 participants included in the analyses, 747 (14.5 %) reported hearing loss, including 207 Black adults and 199 White adults. Each unit increase in the DASH, MedDiet, and MIND scores was associated with 19 % (95 % CI: 0.79, 0.94, P < 0.001), 11 % (95 % CI: 0.79, 1.00, P = 0.05), and 13 % (95 % CI: 0.87, 0.99, P < 0.05) lower risk for hearing loss, respectively. High adherence to the Western diet was associated with an earlier onset of hearing loss up to 14 months (P < 0.05). Participants had an increased rate of cognitive decline after reporting hearing loss. During follow-up, participants in the highest tertile of the DASH diet score who reported hearing loss experienced a 17 % faster cognitive decline (β = -0.07 ± 0.01) compared to those without hearing loss (β = -0.06 ± 0.003). However, this decline was significantly slower than that of participants observed in the lowest tertile of the DASH diet, who exhibited a 67 % faster cognitive decline (β = -0.10 ± 0.012, P = 0.05). DISCUSSION: Healthy dietary patterns, particularly the DASH diet, was associated with a reduced risk of hearing loss and slower cognitive decline following hearing loss. Clinically, these findings underscore the importance of dietary quality in preserving cognitive health by potentially mitigating risk of hearing loss or delaying the onset of hearing loss in older adults.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Although many previous trials have formalized the blood glucose-lowering effect of the DASH diet, relevant reports in China remain limited. This study aimed to explore the anti-hyperglycaemic effect of the Chinese Modified Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension diet combined with 23% low-sodium salt and meal packs in patients with hypertension and type 2 diabetes. METHODS: We conducted a randomized controlled single-blinded trial with a semi-open design; 100 participants were randomly assigned to Group A (control), Group B (23% low-sodium salt), and Group C (meal packs) for 8 weeks of dietary intervention. All participants were followed up weekly to collect glycaemia data (standardized meal tolerance test), salt use, and adverse events. RESULTS: Generalized estimating equation analysis indicated that fasting blood glucose decreased in all three groups following the intervention when compared to baseline. Group A decreased by 0.72 mmol/L (P = 0.008), while Groups B and C decreased by 2.02 mmol/L and 2.06 mmol/L, respectively (both P < 0.001). Although the latter two groups experienced greater reductions than Group A, the differences among the groups were not statistically significant (P = 0.450). For postprandial blood glucose, Group C showed the most pronounced decrease. The three groups recorded reductions of 2.43 mmol/L, 2.52 mmol/L, and 4.29 mmol/L, respectively (all P < 0.001), with again no significant difference observed between the groups (P = 0.088). The most notable enhancement in postprandial glucose was observed in Group C, which demonstrated a 51.5% improvement in its control rate. However, there was no statistically significant difference between the groups. No serious adverse events occurred during the trial. CONCLUSION: The CM-DASH diet combined with 23% low-sodium salt and meal packs demonstrates potentially beneficial effects on glycemic control in patients with hypertension and type 2 diabetes. This intervention reduces salt intake and fosters the development of healthy eating habits, thereby contributing to the improvement of patients' blood glucose. However, larger studies are necessary to confirm these findings. Trial registration ChiCTR2000029017. Registered January 11, 2020-Prospective registration, http://www.chictr.org.cn/."

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: Breast cancer (BC) survivors experience higher rates of cardiometabolic conditions, partly due to treatment. While healthy eating decreases the risk of these conditions in the general population, its association in BC survivors is unclear. METHODS: We included 3415 participants from the Pathways Study, a prospective cohort of women diagnosed with invasive BC between 2005 and 2013 and followed through 2021. Concordance of food intakes from food frequency questionnaires was estimated for five healthy eating patterns at BC diagnosis: Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH), healthy Plant-based Dietary Index (hPDI), 2020 Healthy Eating Index (HEI), American Cancer Society nutrition guidelines (ACS), and the alternate Mediterranean Diet Index (aMED). Incident hypertension, diabetes, and dyslipidemia were identified through electronic health records. Cumulative incidence rates (CIRs) were estimated accounting for the competing risk of death. Covariate-adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using Fine and Gray regression models, stratified by BC treatment status. RESULTS: Over an average 11.5 years (range = 0.3-16.3) of follow-up, 554 (16.2%) participants developed hypertension, 362 (10.6%) developed diabetes, and 652 (19.1%) developed dyslipidemia. CIRs for any cardiometabolic condition 15 years after BC diagnosis were 39.2% for women in the highest HEI quartile compared to 49.3% in the lowest. After adjustment, women in the highest HEI quartile had lower risks of any cardiometabolic condition (HR = 0.70, 95% CI 0.54-0.91, Ptrend = 0.006), including hypertension (HR = 0.71, 95% CI 0.54-0.94, Ptrend = 0.007), diabetes (HR = 0.57, 95% CI 0.41-0.79, Ptrend < 0.001), and dyslipidemia (HR = 0.77, 95% CI 0.59-0.99, Ptrend = 0.04). Similar associations were observed for DASH, hPDI, and ACS with diabetes incidence. CONCLUSION: Healthier diets at BC diagnosis, particularly those aligned with the HEI, were associated with lower cardiometabolic risks.",

In many studies, sleep duration and/or quality have also been found to be related to human health. The purpose of this narrative review was to present the relationship between the Mediterranean diet, the DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) diet, and the MIND (Mediterranean-DASH Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay) diet and sleep quality and duration in different populations. A literature search was conducted based on the phrases \"Mediterranean diet\", \"DASH diet\", and \"MIND diet\" appearing together with \"sleep\" or \"insomnia\" in papers' titles or abstracts. Studies on obstructive sleep apnea or shift work were excluded. The electronic databases were searched via EBSCOhost. Main results: The vast majority of studies showed that there was a beneficial association between the three diets discussed in this review and sleep duration and/or quality; however, most of these results were obtained in cross-sectional analyses. There were only a few studies in which an association between sleep parameters and these diets was not observed. Direction for future studies: Taking into account the significant role of adequate sleep quality in various diseases, even in all-cause mortality, the implementation of randomized controlled trials and prospective cohort studies seems to be necessary to provide further evidence that would allow these associations to be confirmed. In conclusion, the results obtained so far in various populations strongly suggest that healthy dietary patterns abundant in plant foods, are associated with better sleep quality, as well as with a more adequate length of sleep.",

      "abstract": "The Mediterranean-Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH) Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay (MIND) diet is a dietary pattern designed to prevent cognitive decline. Dietary adherence is assessed with the MIND diet scoring system, which is currently based on the American diet and serving sizes. It is known that serving sizes and consumed food products differ between countries. Existing literature lacks reporting on food products included within the MIND diet and weight or volume equivalents corresponding to MIND diet servings, impeding accurate comparisons across studies. This study sought to overcome these limitations by evaluating MIND food products consumed in the Dutch context and developing a scoring system based on consumed quantities in weight or volume amounts rather than in standard serving amounts. The third objective was to modify an existing Dutch brief FFQ (Eetscore-FFQ) to evaluate adherence to the MIND diet. We translated nine of the fifteen MIND food groups directly to grams and volumes using the United States Department of Agriculture measurement conversion table. For the remaining food groups, we employed indirect translation to align them as closely as possible to the original MIND diet. These translated quantities in weight and volumes amounts were subsequently rounded to the nearest Dutch household measures, resulting in the culturally adapted MIND-NL diet scoring. The development of the MIND-NL-Eetscore-FFQ, comprising seventy-two food items (forty-one questions), is described. Our adaption approach is reproducible and can be used to customize the MIND diet scoring system to other cultures."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), the most common endocrine disorder for women of reproductive age, is associated with increased risk for insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. Current PCOS treatments insufficiently address the spectrum and severity of the disorder, and there is little evidence-based guidance available for lifestyle management of PCOS, especially through nutritional approaches. Some evidence shows that a very low-carbohydrate diet can improve glucose control compared to low-fat or moderate-carbohydrate diets, leading to improved glucose control and insulin levels that may help to treat symptoms of PCOS. This research investigates whether a very low-carbohydrate diet is more effective in improving glucose control and decreasing symptoms of PCOS in comparison to a DASH diet. METHODS: The SUPER study aims to address the gap in knowledge about nutritional advice for people with PCOS through a randomized, comparative effectiveness trial comparing two approaches to glucose control: the dietary approaches to stopping hypertension (DASH) diet, and a very low-carbohydrate (VLC) diet. We will randomize 184 women with PCOS with body mass indexes (BMIs) between 25 and 50 kg/m2 to a VLC or DASH diet. All participants will follow a 24-session, 12-month, online diet, and lifestyle intervention that teaches their assigned diet. Participants will receive nutritional education, support from diet coaches, and education about behavioral strategies to improve dietary adherence. The primary outcome measure is HbA1c, and secondary outcomes include glucose variance, lipid and hormone levels (including total and free testosterone), PCOS symptoms, inflammation (measured by high-sensitivity C-reactive protein), body composition and weight, psychological well-being, and intervention feasibility and acceptability. DISCUSSION: The SUPER study is a randomized comparative effectiveness trial that compares two promising approaches to glucose control in people with PCOS. The study also aims to assess the effects of each diet on PCOS symptoms. The research addresses an important gap in knowledge regarding nutritional advice for people with PCOS.

As diet and lifestyle are risk factors for MetS, it is important to know which diet quality index better predicts MetS. The aim of this study is to compare the ability of different diet quality indices in predicting MetS and to identify the most effective one. METHODS: This cross-sectional study involved 5,206 participants aged 35 to 70 engaged in the Prospective Epidemiological Research Study in Iran (PERSIAN) cohort. Assessment of one year's food intake via a validated 134-item semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) facilitated the calculation of adherence to five diet quality indices: Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH), Mediterranean, Mediterranean-DASH Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay (MIND), Dietary Inflammatory Index (DII), and Diet Quality Indices (DQI). While bivariate Pearson correlation and binary logistic regression aided in identifying the strongest correlation and predictor for MetS among the indices. RESULTS: This study showed a significant association between adhering to the DASH diet score, Mediterranean diet score, MIND diet score, DII score, and DQI score, and the odds of developing MetS (OR: 0.94, (95% CI: 0.93-0.95), OR: 0.85, (95% CI: 0.81-0.89), OR: 0.84, (95% CI: 0.80-0.89), OR: 1.22, (95%CI: 1.11-1.34), OR: 0.95, (95%CI 0.94-0.96) respectively). Therefore, with each unit increase in DASH diet score, Mediterranean diet score, MIND diet score, DII score, and DQI score, the odds of MetS was reduced by 5.4%, 14.5%, 15.6%, 22%, 5%, respectively. All the indices were correlated with the intake of most of the micronutrients, with the strongest correlations being observed in the DII. DASH diet score aligned with the most favourable MetS biomarker risk, while DII score primarily associated with MetS and could be considered as a predictor for MetS. CONCLUSION: The present study's findings reveal that between all these five diet quality indices, the DASH diet score correlates strongly with a favourable biomarker risk profile, while the DII score is predominantly linked to MetS."

OBJECTIVES: Our study explored serum metabolites associated with adherence to the MIND diet. METHODS: In 3,908 Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study participants, we calculated a modified MIND diet score based on a 66-item self-reported food frequency questionnaire (FFQ). The modified score did not include berries and olive oil, as these items were not assessed in the FFQ. We used multivariable linear regression models in 2 subgroups of ARIC study participants and meta-analyzed results using fixed effects regression to identify significant metabolites after Bonferroni correction. We also examined associations between these metabolites and food components of the modified MIND diet. C-statistics evaluated the prediction of high modified MIND diet adherence using significant metabolites beyond participant characteristics. RESULTS: Of 360 metabolites analyzed, 27 metabolites (15 positive, 12 negative) were significantly associated with the modified MIND diet score (lipids, n = 13; amino acids, n = 5; xenobiotics, n = 3; cofactors and vitamins, n = 3; carbohydrates n = 2; nucleotide n = 1). The top 4 metabolites that improved the prediction of high dietary adherence to the modified MIND diet were 7-methylxanthine, theobromine, docosahexaenoate (DHA), and 3-carboxy-4-methyl-5-propyl-2-furanpropanoate (CMPF). CONCLUSION: Twenty-seven metabolomic markers were correlated with the modified MIND diet. The biomarkers, if further validated, could be useful to objectively assess adherence to the MIND diet.",

However, there is a lack of evidence regarding the association between emerging diets such as the EAT-Lancet reference diet (ELD) and the Mediterranean-DASH Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay (MIND) diet, and mental health in different societies. This study aimed to determine the association between adherence to ELD and MIND diets and the risk of depression, anxiety, and stress. METHODS: This research involved 4579 participants from the PERSIAN Organizational Cohort Study in Mashhad (POCM). To assess dietary intake, a comprehensive 118-item semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) was employed. The Planetary Health Diet Index (PHDI) was used to assess adherence to the ELD. Mental health status was evaluated using the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale-21 items (DASS-21) questionnaire. Binary logistic regression was utilized to examine the relationship between these scores and mental health indicators. RESULTS: In the adjusted model, the highest quartile of PHDI showed a 35% reduced risk of depression compared to those in the lowest quartile (OR: 0.653, 95% CI: 0.483-0.883; P = 0.008). However, compared to the reference quartile, participants in the highest quartile of MIND diet exhibited significantly lower risks of depression (OR: 0.611, 95% CI: 0.447-0.836; P = 0.005), anxiety (OR: 0.559, 95% CI: 0.418-0.746; P < 0.001), and stress (OR: 0.629, 95% CI: 0.419-0.944; P = 0.008). CONCLUSIONS: The ELD and MIND diet were both associated with reduced odds of depression. Additionally, MIND diet was associated with decreased likelihood of anxiety and stress. However, no connection was observed between ELD and anxiety or stress. Further large-scale interventions are required to confirm these findings.",

Participants (n = 63; ages 18-65 y, BMI 25-49.9 kg/m2) were randomized to the Healthy U.S. (H-US), Mediterranean (Med), or Vegetarian (Veg) groups. Hypotheses tested included (1) that the more plant-based diet patterns (Veg and Med) would have greater improvements in all diet quality indices (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH), Dietary Inflammatory Index (DII), alternate Mediterranean Diet Index (aMED), healthy Plant-based Dietary Index (hPDI) assessed via three dietary recalls) as compared to the H-US pattern and (2) that each index would separately predict changes in weight loss, hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), and blood pressure (BP). None of the group-by-time interactions for any of the diet indices were significant. Compared to the H-US group, Veg participants had greater increases in fiber (difference between groups 5.72 ± 2.10 5 g/day; P = .01), riboflavin (0.38 ± 0.19 mg/day; P = .05), and folate (87.39 ± 40.36 mcg/day; P = .03). For every one-point increase in hPDI, there was a 1.62 ± 0.58 mmHg decrease in systolic BP, for every one-point increase in aMED there was a 1.45 ± 0.70 mmHg decrease in diastolic BP, and for every one-point increase in hPDI, there was a 1.15 ± 0.38 mmHg decrease in diastolic BP.

Excess fat mass is associated with an increased risk of metabolic and non-metabolic complications. The aim of our pre-post-designed study was to assess the effect of behavioral intervention on body weight, fat mass and anthropometric and metabolic parameters in obese and overweight individuals. METHODS: The study included one hundred people (85 women) with excess fat mass who voluntarily declared their willingness to participate in the weight-loss program consisted of 12 weeks of the DASH diet combined with regular, supervised physical activity. Anthropometric measurements and laboratory tests were performed in all study participants, and anthropometric and metabolic indices were calculated at baseline and after three months of treatment. RESULTS: Body weight decreased significantly by 5.63 ± 4.03 kg, BMI by 2.06 ± 1.44 kg/m2, waist circumference by 5.6 ± 3.7 cm, fat mass from 40.04 ± 6.90 to 36.56 ± 7.07% and uric acid level by 16.0 ± 41.6 μmol/L (p < 0.001 in all cases). We also found an improvement in lipid profile and anthropometric and metabolic indices, except for HDL cholesterol and plasma glucose levels. CONCLUSIONS: The effect of the DASH diet and supervised physical activity was beneficial regardless of age, sex and the presence of hypertension or dysglycemia at baseline. The implementation of a healthy lifestyle was associated with a significant improvement in anthropometric and metabolic parameters, which, if continued, may reduce the risk of unfavorable health-related outcomes in the future.",

METHODS: A systematic search in different databases was realized using the keywords \"Metabolic syndrome\", \"X syndrome\", \"Dash dietary\" and \"Dash diet\". Finally, six studies were included in this meta-analysis. RESULTS: All articles comparing the DASH diet vs. other diet modalities reported significant differences in favor of the DASH diet on Systolic blood pressure (SBP) (standardized mean difference [SMD] = -8.06, confidence interval [CI] = -9.89 to -7.32, and p < 0.00001), Diastolic blood pressure (SMD = -6.38, CI = -7.62 to -5.14, and p < 0.00001), Cholesterol HDL (SMD = 0.70, CI = 0.53 to 0.88, and p < 0.00001) and Cholesterol LDL (SMD = -1.29, CI = -1.73 to -0.85, and p < 0.00001) scales. CONCLUSIONS: The DASH diet has been shown to be beneficial in altered parameters in patients with MS, and the resulting improvements can significantly affect the daily health of these patients.

However, its specific effect on hypertension among elderly Chinese individuals is unclear. AIMS: The objective of this research was to explore the association between the Chinese version of the Mediterranean-DASH Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay (cMIND) diet and hypertension among elderly Chinese individuals, aiming to offer novel strategies for alleviating the burden of hypertension in this demographic. METHODS: In this study, we used cross-sectional data published in 2018 by the China Longitudinal Health and Longevity Survey (CLHLS) to develop a binary logistic regression model to investigate the correlation between cMIND diet and hypertension in a Chinese elderly population. Restricted cubic spline was used to test for linear associations, and further subgroup analyses were performed to test for interactions. RESULTS: In total, 7,103 older adults were included in the study, with a prevalence of hypertension of 39.0%. When the cMIND diet score was used as a continuous variable, a significant protective effect against hypertension was present (OR = 0.955, 95% CI:0.923-0.988, p = 0.008); when used as a categorical variable, this protective effect was still present at higher levels (compared to lower levels) of the cMIND diet (OR = 0.869, 95% CI: 0.760-0.995, p = 0.042). DISCUSSION: Although the Mediterranean diet has great potential to reduce the chance of hypertension, it should also consider the effect on the Chinese population. The results of this study provide new ways to reduce the disease burden of hypertension in Chinese older adults and improve quality of life in later life. CONCLUSION: The cMIND diet can considerably reduce the risk of hypertension among older adults in China.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Observing the dietary principles of the Mediterranean-DASH Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay (MIND) diet has exhibited an association with a diminished occurrence of diverse ailments, enhanced mental well-being, and extended longevity. Nevertheless, current literature is deficient in terms of investigating the link between the MIND diet and subjective well-being (SWB) specifically in older adults. Hence, this study endeavors to examine the correlation between adhering to a Chinese-modified Mediterranean-DASH Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay (cMIND) diet and SWB in the older Chinese adults, taking into account the unique dietary attributes of the Chinese population. METHODS: Using data from the latest four waves of the Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey. Multiple linear regression and multinomial ordered logistic regression were employed to examine the relationship between the duration of adherence to cMIND diet and SWB in Chinese older adults. RESULTS: The results indicated a significant association between the duration of adherence to cMIND diet and SWB (1 ∼ 6 years: B = 0.907, 95%CI = 0.508 ∼ 1.307, P < 0.001; 7 ∼ 9 years: B = 1.286, 95%CI = 0.767 ∼ 1.805, P < 0.001; 10 years and above: B = 2.320, 95%CI = 1.677 ∼ 2.963, P < 0.001). The longer the duration of adherence to cMIND diet, the higher the scores for life satisfaction (B = 0.184, 95%CI = 0.110 ∼ 0.259; B = 0.312, 95%CI = 0.217 ∼ 0.407; B = 0.321, 95%CI = 0.193 ∼ 0.448), positive affect (B = 0.434, 95%CI = 0.209 ∼ 0.658; B = 0.701, 95%CI = 0.400 ∼ 1.003; B = 1.167, 95%CI = 0.775 ∼ 1.559), and negative affect (B = 0.289, 95%CI = 0.078 ∼ 0.500; B = 0.832, 95%CI = 0.479 ∼ 1.185), suggesting a higher SWB score. Sensitivity analysis further supports our findings. CONCLUSION: Considering the poor knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors related to diet among Chinese adults, especially older adults, it is imperative to implement dietary policies that promote SWB in older adults to enhance their happiness in later life.",

METHODS: Prospective observational study using participants' baseline (2003-2006), follow-up (2007-2013) and clinical records data. Five diet quality scores were derived from a food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) at baseline: the relative Mediterranean Diet Score (rMED), the Modified Mediterranean Diet Score (ModMDS), a Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score, a Healthful Plant-based Diet Index (HPDI) and the World Health Organization Healthy Diet Indicator (WHO-HDI). Participants using pharmacological antidepressant treatment were excluded as a proxy for presence of depression at baseline. At follow-up, the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) was applied to assess depressive symptoms (≥ 10 defining depressive disorder). A secondary outcome was depression diagnosis assessed through clinical records. Logistic regression and Cox proportional hazards models were used. RESULTS: Main analysis included 3046 adults (50.3% women) with a mean age of 54.7 (SD = 11.6) years. After 6-years follow-up, 184 (6.04%) cases of depressive disorder were identified. There was 16% lower odds of depressive disorder per 1SD increase of rMED (OR = 0.84; 95%CI = 0.71-0.98). Secondary outcome analysis (n = 4789) identified 261 (5.45%) incident cases of clinical depression diagnosis over 12 years follow-up, and 19% lower risk of clinical depression was observed with the WHO-HDI (HR = 0.81; 95%CI = 0.70-0.93). Adjusting for BMI did not attenuate the findings. CONCLUSIONS: A significant inverse association between diet quality and depression incidence was found in this population-based cohort study, independent of sociodemographic, health and lifestyle. Adherence to a healthy diet could be a complementary intervention for the prevention of depression.",

Based on the National Cholesterol Education Program, if the person has three or more indices containing: elevated fasting blood sugar, high levels of triglycerides, hypertension, low levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and central obesity, he suffers MetS. The Mediterranean-Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay diet is a novel diet that with the specific aim of safeguarding cognitive function. Propolis is a resinous substance produced by bees from the combination of buds and secretions of plants with saliva and bee enzymes. After propolis supplementation, a significant reduction in fasting plasma glucose levels and lipid profiles has been observed. Considering the importance of chronic diseases like MetS on health, the role of the Mediterranean-DASH Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay (MIND) diet and propolis supplement that will improve blood sugar, blood lipid, anthropometric indicators, blood pressure, and cognitive function, and limited contradictory studies, we decided to conduct this study. This study, which is a randomized controlled clinical trial study, will be conducted on adults with MetS who will visit Hazrat Ali Health Center in Isfahan. Participants must provide informed consent before engaging in the study. Demographic data such as age, gender, and medical history will be recorded. Then, anthropometric indices, MetS indices, and cognitive function will be measured in all subjects. The study participants will be divided into three groups and will be controlled for 12 weeks. We will have a MIND diet + placebo group, a MIND diet + propolis supplement group, and a control group that will receive a microcrystalline cellulose placebo and usual dietary advice. At the end of the intervention, all indices will be assessed again. The data obtained in the study will be analyzed at descriptive and analytical levels by the statistical software SPSS26. The present study's protocol was approved by the Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials (www.irct.ir) on 3/28/2023 and a registration reference is IRCT20230105057054N1."

In the REasons for Geographic and Racial Disparities in Stroke (REGARDS) cohort, diet data were collected at baseline using food frequency questionnaires. Modified Poisson regression was used to examine the association of MIND diet with incident chronic kidney disease (CKD). In the REGARDS stroke case-cohort, 357 metabolites were measured in baseline plasma. Weighted linear regression was used to test associations between MIND diet and metabolites. Weighted logistic regression was used to test associations between MIND-associated metabolites and incident CKD. Mediation analyses were conducted to determine whether metabolites mediated the relationship between MIND diet and CKD. A higher MIND diet score was associated with a decreased risk of incident CKD (risk ratio 0.90, 95% CI (0.86-0.94); p = 2.03 × 10-7). Fifty-seven metabolites were associated with MIND diet (p < 3 × 10-4). Guanosine was found to mediate the relationship between MIND diet and incident CKD (odds ratio for indirect effects 0.93, 95% CI (0.88-0.97); p < 0.05).

The dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) diet is a healthy dietary pattern. We investigated the effect of the DASH diet on fatty liver and cardiovascular risk factors in subjects with MetS. METHODS: 60 Subjects with MetS were assigned into the intervention group (DASH diet) or the control group (a healthy diet). Fatty liver index (FLI), hepatic steatosis index (HSI), waist circumference (WC), weight, body mass index (BMI), triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c) and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c) were evaluated at the beginning and after intervention. Equations of fatty liver indices such as FLI and HSI are based on liver enzymes, anthropometric variables, sex and having diabetes. RESULTS: 30 subjects in the intervention group and 29 subjects in the control group completed the study. We found a significant reduction in the intervention group compared to the control group in FLI (-13.06 ± 10.03 vs. -2.90 ± 6.82;P < 0.001), HSI (-2.72 ± 2.59 vs. -0.81 ± 3.80;P = 0.02), WC (-6.02 ± 4.24 vs. -2.24 ± 4.28;P = 0.001), weight (-3.39 ± 2.53 vs. -1.51 ± 2.72;P = 0.008), BMI (-1.25 ± 0.93 vs. -0.56 ± 1.01;P = 0.008), DBP (-5.16 ± 3.92 vs. -1.50 ± 7.04;P = 0.01), SBP (-6.97 ± 8.21 vs. -1.36 ± 6.83;P = 0.006), TG (-18.50 ± 14.32 vs. 0.60 ± 23.81;P < 0.001), TC (-16.10 ± 17.94 vs. -5.07 ± 23.62;P = 0.04) and LDL-c (-13.50 ± 9.58 vs. -4.90 ± 18.28;P = 0.02).

It builds upon existing research that highlights the role of dietary antioxidants in alleviating psychological disorders, cognitive impairments, and memory deficits. Additionally, previous studies have separately explored the beneficial effects of the Mediterranean and DASH diets on these issues. A case-control study was undertaken in Iran, involving a sample of 360 children and adolescents aged 7-13 years. Participants were divided into two groups, namely the case group (n = 120) and the control group (n = 240), with age and sex being matched between the groups. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV-TR) was employed for the diagnosis of ADHD. The MIND diet score was computed using the food intake data acquired from the Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ) completed by the subjects. The mean ± SD for the age and BMI of the study population was 8.76 ± 1.64 years and 16.90 ± 3.58 kg/m2, respectively. The mean score of MIND in this study was 27.93. After adjustment for potential confounder in the final model, subjects in highest compared to the lowest quartile of MIND diet score had significantly lower odds of ADHD (OR = 0.59, 95% CI 0.37-0.83; P-trend = 0.019). This study provides valuable evidence suggesting that adherence to the MIND diet is associated with decreased odds of ADHD.",

This study aims to bridge the gap in understanding of the association of the MIND diet with IBD risk. Methods: We utilized data from 187 490 participants in the UK Biobank who provided dietary information and were free of IBD at baseline. Dietary information was obtained using a validated web-based 24-hour dietary recall questionnaire. A MIND diet score was evaluated based on the intake of ten beneficial and five unhealthy food groups and the scores were further grouped into tertiles. The outcome of interest was incident IBD, Crohn's disease (CD), and ulcerative colitis (UC). Multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using Cox proportional hazard models adjusted for demographic characteristics, lifestyle factors, cancer history, and other dietary factors. Mediation analyses were performed to evaluate the role of systemic inflammation and metabolic disorders represented by the integrated biomarkers in the MIND diet-IBD association. Results: After a mean follow-up of 10.7 years, we documented 825 incident IBD cases (250 CD and 575 UC). The average age of the participants was 56.2 years, of which 55.0% were females. We found that greater adherence to the MIND diet, represented by a higher diet score, was associated with a lower risk of IBD (HRcomparing extreme tertiles 0.74, 95% CI 0.62-0.90, p = 0.002; p for trend = 0.005), CD (HR 0.66, 95% CI 0.47-0.94, p = 0.022; p for trend = 0.023), and UC (HR 0.78, 95% CI 0.62-0.98, p = 0.031; p for trend = 0.022). The associations were partially mediated by metabolic and inflammation status (mediation proportion: 5.5-15.9%). Conclusion: We found higher adherence to the MIND diet was associated with a lower risk of IBD, and that inflammatory and metabolic conditions may play an important role in the underlying mechanistic pathways.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Time-restricted eating (TRE), a popular form of intermittent fasting, has shown benefits for improving metabolic diseases and cardiometabolic health. However, the effect of TRE in the regulation of blood pressure in primary hypertension remains unclear. METHODS: A 6-week randomized controlled trial was conducted, in which a total of 74 stage 1 primary hypertensive patients without high-risk were randomly assigned to Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) group (n = 37) or DASH + TRE group (n = 37). Participants in the DASH + TRE group were instructed to consume their food within an 8-h window. Scientific research platform in We Chat application was used to track participants. The primary outcome was blood pressure. The secondary outcomes included body composition, cardiometabolic risk factors, inflammation-related parameters, urinary Na+ excretion, other clinical variables and safety outcomes. RESULTS: The reduction of systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure were 5.595 ± 4.072 and 5.351 ± 5.643 mm Hg in the DASH group and 8.459 ± 4.260 and 9.459 ± 4.375 mm Hg in the DASH + TRE group. DASH + TRE group improved blood pressure diurnal rhythm. Subjects in DASH + TRE group had decreased extracellular water and increased urinary Na+ excretion. Furthermore, the decrease in blood pressure was associated with a reduction of extracellular water or increase in urinary Na+ excretion. In addition, safety outcomes such as nighttime hunger were also reported. CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrated that 8-h TRE + DASH diet caused a greater decrease in blood pressure in stage 1 primary hypertensive patients than DASH diet. This study may provide novel insights into the benefits of lifestyle modification in the treatment of primary hypertension.

In this cross-sectional study, we included 101 patients with RA and 101 healthy individuals. The MIND diet score was measured using a semi-quantitative Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ) with 147 food items. Total capacity antioxidant (TCA), superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPX), and malondialdehyde (MDA) serum concentrations were evaluated by ELISA, and the disease severity was measured regarding the disease activity score 28 (DAS-28) criteria. The average score of the MIND diet was substantially lower in the RA subjects than in the healthy people (p < .001). Individuals with a higher MIND diet score had lower odds of RA than those with a low score (p < .001). There was no remarkable link between the MIND diet and oxidative stress factors (p > .05). A reverse association was found between the MIND diet score and disease activity (p < .05). The MIND diet was significantly and negatively correlated with triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, total cholesterol, fasting blood glucose, and hemoglobin A1C. There was a positive association between the diet and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. The findings indicate that following the MIND diet may decrease disease activity and the odds of RA. Also, high adherence to the MIND diet may improve the lipid profile and blood glucose status in RA patients."

      "abstract": "The prevalence of chronic diseases is currently a major public health issue worldwide and is exploding with the population growth and aging. Dietary patterns are well known to play a important role in our overall health and well-being, and therefore, poor diet and malnutrition are among the most critical risk factors for chronic disease. Thus, dietary recommendation and nutritional supplementation have significant clinical implications for the targeted treatment of some of these diseases. Multiple dietary patterns have been proposed to prevent chronic disease incidence, like Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) and Diabetes Risk Reduction Diet (DRRD). Among them, the MedDiet, which is one of the most well-known and studied dietary patterns in the world, has been related to a wide extent of health benefits. Substantial evidence has supported an important reverse association between higher compliance to MedDiet and the risk of chronic disease. Innovative strategies within the healthcare framework of predictive, preventive, and personalized medicine (PPPM/3PM) view personalized dietary customization as a predictive medical approach, cost-effective preventive measures, and the optimal dietary treatment tailored to the characteristics of patients with chronic diseases in primary and secondary care. Through a comprehensive collection and review of available evidence, this review summarizes health benefits of MedDiet in the context of PPPM/3PM for chronic diseases, including cardiovascular disease, hypertension, type 2 diabetes, obesity, metabolic syndrome, osteoporosis, and cancer, thereby a working hypothesis that MedDiet can personalize the prevention and treatment of chronic diseases was derived."

      "abstract": "The Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet is highly effective in controlling blood pressure (BP). Although Na restriction is not a primary focus within the DASH diet, it is recommended that it be added to control BP. Therefore, we aimed to systematically review the characteristics and BP-lowering effects of Na-restricted DASH diet interventions. We searched thirteen databases, namely, MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, KoreaMed, KISS, KMbase, RISS, CINAHL, Scopus, ClinicalTrials.gov, Grey Literature Report, OpenGrey and PQDT Global, for articles published through May 2023. The randomised controlled trials assessing the BP-lowering effect of the Na-restricted DASH diet in adults aged 18 years and older were included. The study protocol was registered in the PROSPERO registry (CRD42023409996). The risk of bias in the included studies was also assessed. Nine articles were included in this review. Interventions were categorised into three types: feeding, provision and education, and the study results were compared by intervention type. BP was significantly reduced in two of the three feeding studies, one of the three provisional studies and none of the educational studies. In eight studies, effect sizes varied among both systolic BP (-7·7 to -2·4) and diastolic BP (-8·3 to 0·1). Six studies showed an overall high risk of bias. In conclusion, Na-restricted DASH may have beneficial effects on BP control. Additionally, compared with control interventions, feeding interventions appeared to have a greater BP-lowering effect. Further high-quality studies are needed to improve the quality of the evidence.",

However, studies directly comparing the cardiometabolic effects of the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) vs. the Mediterranean diet (MedDiet) accompanied by salt restriction are currently lacking. Thus, with the present secondary analyses of a randomized trial, we aimed to assess the cardiometabolic effects of a 3-month intensive dietary intervention implementing salt restriction alone or on top of the DASH and MedDiet compared to no/minimal intervention in never drug-treated adults with high normal blood pressure (BP) or grade 1 hypertension. METHODS: We randomly assigned individuals to the control group (CG, n = 60), salt restriction group (SRG, n = 60), DASH diet with salt restriction group (DDG, n = 60), or MedDiet with salt restriction group (MDG, n = 60). RESULTS: According to the intention-to-treat analysis, the DDG and the MDG had lower odds ratio (OR) (95% CI) of metabolic syndrome [0.29 (0.12, 0.72), and 0.15 (0.06, 0.41), respectively] compared to the CG. Moreover, the MDG had lower odds of metabolic syndrome compared to the SRG and lower odds of elevated BP levels than the DDG and the SRG. Moreover, total and LDL-cholesterol, fasting glucose, HbA1c, and systolic/diastolic BP were reduced in all three intervention groups compared to the CG. CONCLUSION: On a background of salt restriction, the MedDiet was superior in BP reduction, but the DASH and MedDiet reduced the prevalence of metabolic syndrome to the same extent."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Mild Cognitive impairment (MCI) is a pre-demented state in the elderly populace. The Mediterranean & Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay (MIND) diet has shown promise in reducing the risk of MCI and Alzheimer's disease in older people. Notably, the existing MIND diet is not adapted to the specific needs of older adults in Malaysia, considering distinct food cultures and availability. Consequently, this study aimed to develop the Malaysian version of the MIND diet (MY-MINDD) scores and investigate their association with MCI in the older adult populace of Malaysia. METHODS: A comprehensive pooled data analysis was conducted on combined data from 810 participants sourced from the longitudinal Long-Term Research Grant Scheme-Towards Useful Aging (LRGS-TUA) and Fundamental Research Grant Scheme (FRGS) studies. The MY-MINDD scores were developed by incorporating existing MIND diet food groups, their corresponding scoring mechanisms, and consideration of common Malaysian foods which are proven to be beneficial and detrimental to cognitive function. To substantiate the MY-MINDD scoring system, its association with MCI was evaluated using a series of validated neuropsychological test batteries. RESULTS: MY-MINDD consists of seven food groups promote brain health and four food groups exert negative cognitive outcomes. The study participants had an average age of 67.9 ± 4.7 years. The collective MY-MINDD score for all participants was 6.4 ± 0.1 (out of a maximum 11 points), revealing a lower score in individuals with MCI at 6.0 ± 1.7 compared to those without MCI at 6.6 ± 1.6 (p < 0.001). According to hierarchical multivariate binary logistic regression analysis, being in the highest tertile of MY-MINDD score was linked to reduced odds of MCI (odds ratio (OR) = 0.43, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.26-0.72, p < 0.001) in the fully adjusted model in comparison to the lowest tertile. CONCLUSION: The development of the MY-MINDD scores for Malaysian older population revealed that a stronger adherence to this diet is linked to a reduced risk of MCI. Further substantiation of the MY-MINDD scores using more objective measures, such as neuroimaging approaches and other neuropsychological batteries, is necessary.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Current evidence suggests that the Mediterranean-Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay (MIND) is associated with a reduced risk of cognitive impairment among North American and Oceanian populations. However, there has been limited exploration of whether this association extends to the Asian population. This study aimed to assess the correlation between the Chinese version of the MIND (cMIND) diet and cognitive impairment in older Chinese individuals. METHODS: We utilized data from the 2008 wave of the Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey. Participants aged ≥65 years with normal cognitive function at baseline were enrolled. The cMIND diet score (cMINDDS) was calculated by assessing dietary patterns based on survey responses. The Chinese version of the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) was employed to diagnose cognitive impairment in participants. We stratified the analysis by cMINDDS and conducted additional sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: The cohort consisted of 6411 participants. Over a 3-year follow-up, 1165 (18.6%) individuals who initially had normal cognitive function developed cognitive impairment. A linear association was observed between cMINDDS and cognitive impairment. The increased cMINDDS was associated with a reduced risk of cognitive impairment (quartile 1 vs. quartile 4: the adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 0.77, 95% confidence interval [CI]: [0.60, 0.97], p trend = 0.023). Regarding food composition, higher consumption of fresh fruits and nuts was associated with a decreased risk of cognitive impairment (OR = 0.77, 95% CI: [0.66, 0.89] and OR = 0.70, 95% CI [0.58, 0.86], respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Adherence to the cMIND diet was associated with lower risks of cognitive impairment in older Chinese individuals. The cMIND diet, based on the MIND dietary pattern, could serve as a preventive measure against cognitive impairment.",

In this review, the effects of the MIND diet on improving cognitive function, including memory, are summarized. In most studies, the higher the adherence to the MIND diet, the higher the cognitive function evaluation score, and the lower the incidence of dementia. This is because of the anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects of the major nutritional components of the MIND diet: folate, carotenoids, polyphenols, and polyunsaturated fatty acids. Adherence to the MIND diet, containing various bioactive food ingredients, is related to cognitive improvement in the elderly population."

The blood pressure-lowering effect of a low sodium diet and a high potassium diet has been well established, especially in hypertensive population. A high intake of potassium, a key component of the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet, has also shown a favorable impact on the risk of cardiovascular events.

We conducted a nonrandomized crossover trial with meals provided utilizing 2 diets: Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) and whole food, plant-based (WFPB), and thus had intake data from baseline and both intervention diets. OBJECTIVES: Using actual diet records, describe food costs of baseline diets of individuals with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) as well as therapeutic DASH and WFPB diets. METHODS: Three-day food records were collected and analyzed for each 7-d diet phase: baseline, DASH, and WFPB. Nutrient content was analyzed using the Nutrient Data System for Research and cost was determined using Fillet, an application to manage menu pricing. Food costs were calculated for each diet as consumed and adjusted to a standardized 1800 kcal/d. Ingredient-only costs of food away from home (FAFH) were approximated and analyzed. Costs were analyzed using linear mixed-effect models as a function of diet. RESULTS: Fifteen subjects enrolled; 12 completed all dietary phases. The baseline, DASH, and WFPB diets, as consumed, cost $15.72/d (95% CI; $13.91, $17.53), $12.74/d ($11.23, $14.25), and $9.78/d ($7.97, $11.59), respectively. When adjusted to an 1800 kcal/d intake, the baseline, DASH, and WFPB diets cost $15.69/d ($13.87, $17.52), $14.92/d ($13.59, $16.26), and $11.96/d ($10.14, $13.78), respectively. When approximated ingredient-only costs of FAFH were analyzed, as consumed baseline [$11.01 ($9.53, $12.49)] and DASH diets [$11.81 ($10.44, $13.18)] had similar costs; WFPB diet [$8.83 ($7.35, $10.31)] cost the least. CONCLUSIONS: In this short-term study with meals provided, the food costs of plant-predominant diets offering substantial metabolic health benefits were less than or similar to baseline food costs of adults with insulin-treated T2DM. Longer-term data without meal provision are needed for more generalizable results. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT04048642.",

METHODS: We analyzed data from the Adolescent Brain and Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study (Year 1, N = 8333). Multivariable linear regression analysis was used to identify associations between MIND diet score and sociodemographic factors, including race/ethnicity, household income, parent education level, age, sex, and sexual minority status. RESULTS: Compared to White adolescents, Latino adolescents showed the greatest adherence to the MIND diet. Boys had lower adherence to the MIND diet than girls. Lower household income was associated with lower adherence to the MIND diet. Older age was associated with lower adherence to the MIND diet. Sexual minorities had a lower adherence to the MIND diet when compared to their heterosexual counterparts. DISCUSSION: Female sex, Latino ethnicity, Asian and Black race, high household income, heterosexual sexual orientation, and younger age were associated with higher adherence to the MIND diet. These sociodemographic differences can inform targeted screening and counseling for clinicians and public health organizations among diverse adolescent populations. IMPACT STATEMENT: Sociodemographic disparities in diet quality have been documented, but none have explored adherence to the MIND (Mediterranean-DASH [Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension] Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay) diet in early adolescence. In this demographically diverse sample of 9-12-year-old early adolescents in the U.S., we found notable and nuanced sociodemographic disparities in adherence to the MIND diet.

METHODS: A randomized, single-blind, controlled clinical trial was conducted with 68 pregnant women with PDM throughout prenatal care until delivery (18 weeks) at a public maternity hospital in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil (2016-2020). The standard diet adopted by the control group (standard diet group-SDG) contained 45-55% carbohydrates, 15-20% protein, and 25-30% lipids of the total energy intake. An adapted DASH diet, with a similar macronutrient composition, but with higher calcium, potassium, magnesium, fiber, and reduced saturated fat, was prescribed for the intervention group (DASH diet group-DDG). Student's t- or Mann-Whitney U tests were used to compare outcomes between groups. To assess the trajectory of gestational weight gain throughout the intervention between the study groups, linear mixed-effects regression models were used. RESULTS: The DDG had lower gestational weight gain at the fifth (p = 0.03) and seventh appointment (p = 0.04), with no difference in average total gestational weight gain (SDG: 10 kg [SD = 4]; DDG: 9 kg [SD = 5], p = 0.23). There was a trend for a lower length of stay of the newborns (p = 0.08) in the DDG without differences for other perinatal outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: The DASH diet promoted less variation in gestational weight gain without promoting a difference in total gestational weight gain, and there was no difference between the study groups for perinatal outcomes."

      "abstract": "Diet is an important nonpharmacological risk-modifying factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD). The approaches used here to assess diet's role in the risk of AD include multi-country ecological studies, prospective and cross-sectional observational studies, and laboratory studies. Ecological studies have identified fat, meat, and obesity from high-energy diets as important risk factors for AD and reported that AD rates peak about 15-20 years after national dietary changes. Observational studies have compared the Western dietary pattern with those of the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH), Mediterranean (MedDi), and Mediterranean-DASH Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay (MIND) diets. Those studies identified AD risk factors including higher consumption of saturated and total fats, meat, and ultraprocessed foods and a lower risk of AD with higher consumption of fruits, legumes, nuts, omega-3 fatty acids, vegetables, and whole grains. Diet-induced factors associated with a significant risk of AD include inflammation, insulin resistance, oxidative stress, elevated homocysteine, dietary advanced glycation end products, and trimethylamine N-oxide. The molecular mechanisms by which dietary bioactive components and specific foods affect risk of AD are discussed. Given most countries' entrenched food supply systems, the upward trends of AD rates would be hard to reverse. However, for people willing and able, a low-animal product diet with plenty of anti-inflammatory, low-glycemic load foods may be helpful.",

      "abstract": "AIM: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a condition characterized by the accumulation of fat in the liver without excessive alcohol consumption. Lifestyle modifications, such as adopting a healthy diet, represent the standard treatment for NAFLD. However, the impact of the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet on oxidative stress biomarkers in patients with NAFLD remains unclear. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the effect of the DASH diet on total antioxidant capacity (TAC), catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD) levels, and body composition in overweight and obese patients with NAFLD. METHODS: A total of 70 overweight and obese patients aged 1870 years were randomly assigned to either the intervention (DASH diet, n = 35) or the control group (control diet, n = 35) for 12 weeks, with both groups following a calorie-restricted diet. RESULTS: The mean age of participants was 43.1 ± 8.1 years in the DASH group and 45.1 ± 8.6 years in the control group. At the end of the study, a significant difference was observed in the mean TAC and SOD levels between the two groups (p = 0.02). After adjusting for potential confounding factors, such as age, sex, diabetes, smoking, physical activity, and baseline values, the DASH diet maintained its significant effects on TAC and SOD compared to the control diet (p = 0.03). However, there were no significant differences in CAT levels between the two groups. Moreover, a significant reduction in visceral fat (p = 0.01) and a marginally significant decrease in BMI (p = 0.06) were observed in the DASH group compared to the control group after adjusting for potential confounders. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, our study showed that following the DASH diet for 12 weeks in overweight and obese patients with NAFLD has beneficial effects on TAC, SOD, and visceral fat. These findings support the use of the DASH diet as a potential therapeutic intervention for the improvement of oxidative biomarkers in patients with NAFLD.

      "abstract": "IMPORTANCE: Hypertension is a major cause of cardiovascular disease, and although the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet lowers blood pressure (BP), adherence is typically low. Mindfulness training adapted to improving health behaviors that lower BP could improve DASH adherence, in part through improved interoceptive awareness relevant to dietary consumption. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effects of the Mindfulness-Based Blood Pressure Reduction (MB-BP) program on interoceptive awareness and DASH adherence. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Parallel-group, phase 2, sequentially preregistered randomized clinical trials were conducted from June 1, 2017, to November 30, 2020. Follow-up was 6 months. Participants with elevated unattended office BP (≥120/80 mm Hg) were recruited from the population near Providence, Rhode Island. Of 348 participants assessed for eligibility, 67 did not meet inclusion criteria, 17 declined, and 63 did not enroll prior to study end date. In total, 201 participants were randomly assigned, 101 to the MB-BP program and 100 to the enhanced usual care control group, with 24 (11.9%) unavailable for follow-up. Outcome assessors and the data analyst were blinded to group allocation. Analyses were performed using intention-to-treat principles from June 1, 2022, to August 30, 2023. INTERVENTIONS: The 8-week MB-BP program was adapted for elevated BP, including personalized feedback, education, and mindfulness training directed to hypertension risk factors. Both MB-BP and control groups received home BP monitoring devices with instructions and options for referral to primary care physicians. The control group also received educational brochures on controlling high BP. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was Multidimensional Assessment of Interoceptive Awareness (MAIA) questionnaire scores (range 0-5, with higher scores indicating greater interoceptive awareness), and the secondary outcome was DASH adherence scores assessed via a 163-item Food Frequency Questionnaire (range 0-11, with higher scores indicating improved DASH adherence), all compared using regression analyses. RESULTS: Among 201 participants, 118 (58.7%) were female, 163 (81.1%) were non-Hispanic White, and the mean (SD) age was 60.0 (12.2) years. The MB-BP program increased the MAIA score by 0.54 points (95% CI, 0.35-0.74 points; P < .001; Cohen d = 0.45) at 6 months vs control. In participants with poor baseline DASH adherence, the MB-BP program also significantly increased the DASH score by 0.62 points (95% CI, 0.13-1.11 points; P = .01; Cohen d = 0.71) at 6 months vs controls. The intervention was also associated with a 0.34-point improvement in the DASH diet score in all MB-BP participants from baseline (95% CI, 0.09-0.59 points; P = .01; Cohen d = 0.27), while the control group showed a -0.04 point change in DASH diet score from baseline to 6 months (95% CI, -0.31 to 0.24 points; P = .78; Cohen d = -0.03). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: A mindfulness program adapted to improving health behaviors to lower BP improved interoceptive awareness and DASH adherence. The MB-BP program could support DASH dietary adherence in adults with elevated BP. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifiers: NCT03859076 and NCT03256890.",

We investigated the effect of DASH diet on hepatic fibrosis, steatosis and liver enzymes in patients with NAFLD. METHODS: This 12-week randomized controlled trial was conducted among seventy patients with NAFLD who were randomly assigned into two groups including intervention group (DASH diet containing 50-55% carbohydrate, 15-20% protein, and 30% total fat) and the control group (a healthy diet containing 50-55% carbohydrate, 15-20% protein, and 30% total fat). Both diets were calorie-restricted (500-700 kcal lower than the energy requirement). The primary outcomes included hepatic fibrosis, hepatic steatosis, alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST) and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT). RESULTS: At the baseline, there was no significant difference between two groups in the level of hepatic fibrosis (P = 0.63), hepatic steatosis (P = 0.53), ALT (P = 0.93), AST (P = 0.18) and GGT (P = 0.76). A significant reduction was found in the intervention group compared to the control group in hepatic fibrosis (23 grades reduction vs. 7 grades reduction; P = 0.008) and hepatic steatosis (31 grades reduction vs. 9 grades reduction; P = 0.03) after intervention. In addition, a significant change was observed in the intervention group compared to control group in ALT ( - 8.50 ± 8.98 vs.  - 2.09 ± 7.29; P = 0.002), and AST ( - 5.79 ± 6.83 vs.  - 0.51 ± 6.62; P = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS: Adherence to DASH diet may be effective in management of NAFLD.

METHODS: We conducted a randomized controlled single-blind trial with a semi-open design. One hundred and thirty-two participants were randomly assigned into Group A (control group), Group B (52% low-sodium salt group), Group C (23% low-sodium salt group), and Group D (meal pack group) for 8 weeks of dietary intervention. All participants were followed weekly to collect data on blood pressure, salt use, and adverse events. Blood and 24-h urine samples were analyzed at baseline, 4 weeks, and the end of the intervention. RESULTS: At the end of the intervention, the mean blood pressure decreased significantly by 10.81/5.03 mmHg, 14.32/6.32 mmHg, 14.20/6.59 mmHg, and 19.06/7.82 mmHg in Groups A-D, respectively, compared with baseline (p < 0.001). Comparison between groups showed that the systolic blood pressure was lower in Groups C and D than in Groups A (-6.54 mmHg, -8.70 mmHg, p < 0.05) and B (-6.60 mmHg, -8.76 mmHg, p < 0.05), and the diastolic blood pressure was lower in Group D than in Group A (-5.17 mmHg, p = 0.006). The 24-h urinary Na+ and Na+/K+ values were significantly decreased in participants using low-sodium salt (p < 0.001). No serious adverse events occurred during the trial. CONCLUSION: Our preliminary results suggest that 23 and 52% concentrations of low-sodium salt combined with the CM-DASH diet can effectively reduce sodium intake and increase potassium intake in patients with hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus, thus achieving \"salt reduction\" and attaining standard, smooth, comprehensive management of patients with hypertension and type 2 diabetes.

Studies directly comparing the BP effects of the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) vs. the Mediterranean diet (MedDiet) on a salt restriction background are currently lacking. Thus, our purpose was to assess the BP effects of a 3-month intensive dietary intervention implementing salt restriction either alone or in the context of the DASH, and the MedDiet compared to no/minimal intervention in adults with high normal BP or grade 1 hypertension. METHODS: We randomly assigned never drug-treated individuals to a control group (CG, n = 60), a salt restriction group (SRG, n = 60), a DASH diet with salt restriction group (DDG, n = 60), or a MedDiet with salt restriction group (MDG, n = 60). The primary outcome was the attained office systolic BP difference among the randomized arms during follow-up. RESULTS: A total of 240 patients were enrolled, while 204 (85%) completed the study. According to the intention-to-treat analysis, compared to the CG, office and 24 h ambulatory systolic and diastolic BP were reduced in all intervention groups. A greater reduction in the mean office systolic BP was observed in the MDG compared to all other study groups (MDG vs. CG: mean difference = -15.1 mmHg; MDG vs. SRG: mean difference = -7.5 mmHg, and MDG vs. DDG: mean difference = -3.2 mmHg, all P-values <0.001). The DDG and the MDG did not differ concerning the office diastolic BP and the 24 h ambulatory systolic and diastolic BP; however, both diets were more efficient in BP-lowering compared to the SRG. CONCLUSIONS: On a background of salt restriction, the MedDiet was superior in office systolic BP-lowering, but the DASH and MedDiet reduced BP to an extent higher than salt restriction alone.",

The present study aimed at evaluating the impact of a Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet using local foodstuffs on the status of hypertensive patients at the Ngaoundere Regional Hospital. A case-control study was carried out with 160 hypertensive patients divided into two groups, a test and a control group. A food questionnaire was used to evaluate the food habits of patients and design the sheet of the DASH diet to provide a maximum of 2000 kcal/d. The DASH diet was administered to the test group (eighty-eight patients), while the control group (seventy-two patients) consumed their normal diet. Both groups were followed up for 8 weeks. The systolic and diastolic blood pressures (SBP, DBP), body mass index (BMI), triglycerides, HDL-c, LDL-c and total-cholesterol levels of patients of the two groups were measured before and after the intervention. The results indicate that the DASH diet improves all the markers of hypertension in the test group with significant decreases in BMI, SBP, DBP, LDL-c and total-cholesterol. Patients of the control group had fourteen and seven times more risk of having increased systolic and diastolic pressures, respectively, and are thus exposed to hypertension complications.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Findings from observational studies suggest that dietary patterns may offer protective benefits against cognitive decline, but data from clinical trials are limited. The Mediterranean-DASH Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay, known as the MIND diet, is a hybrid of the Mediterranean diet and the DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) diet, with modifications to include foods that have been putatively associated with a decreased risk of dementia. METHODS: We performed a two-site, randomized, controlled trial involving older adults without cognitive impairment but with a family history of dementia, a body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) greater than 25, and a suboptimal diet, as determined by means of a 14-item questionnaire, to test the cognitive effects of the MIND diet with mild caloric restriction as compared with a control diet with mild caloric restriction. We assigned the participants in a 1:1 ratio to follow the intervention or the control diet for 3 years. All the participants received counseling regarding adherence to their assigned diet plus support to promote weight loss. The primary end point was the change from baseline in a global cognition score and four cognitive domain scores, all of which were derived from a 12-test battery. The raw scores from each test were converted to z scores, which were averaged across all tests to create the global cognition score and across component tests to create the four domain scores; higher scores indicate better cognitive performance. The secondary outcome was the change from baseline in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-derived measures of brain characteristics in a nonrandom sample of participants. RESULTS: A total of 1929 persons underwent screening, and 604 were enrolled; 301 were assigned to the MIND-diet group and 303 to the control-diet group. The trial was completed by 93.4% of the participants. From baseline to year 3, improvements in global cognition scores were observed in both groups, with increases of 0.205 standardized units in the MIND-diet group and 0.170 standardized units in the control-diet group (mean difference, 0.035 standardized units; 95% confidence interval, -0.022 to 0.092; P = 0.23). Changes in white-matter hyperintensities, hippocampal volumes, and total gray- and white-matter volumes on MRI were similar in the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: Among cognitively unimpaired participants with a family history of dementia, changes in cognition and brain MRI outcomes from baseline to year 3 did not differ significantly between those who followed the MIND diet and those who followed the control diet with mild caloric restriction.

The present study aimed to identify the effect of the DASH diet on PE incidence (primary outcome) and blood pressure, glycated haemoglobin (GH), serum lipids, glutathione peroxidase (GP), C-reactive protein (CRP - secondary outcomes) in pregnant with PDM. This randomised, controlled, single-blind trial studied sixty-eight pregnant women with PDM throughout prenatal care until delivery (18 weeks) at a public maternity hospital, Brazil. The standard diet group (SDG) received a diet containing 45-65 % carbohydrates, 15-20 % protein and 25-30 % lipids. The DASH diet group (DDG) received the adapted DASH diet with a similar macronutrient distribution, but with a higher concentration of fibres, unsaturated fats, calcium, magnesium and potassium as well as lower saturated fat. Student's t, Mann-Whitney U and the Chi-square tests were used to compare outcomes. PE incidence was 22⋅9 % in the SDG and 12⋅1 % in the DDG (P = 0⋅25). GP levels significantly increased in the DDG (intra-group analysis; mean difference = 1588 [CI 181, 2994], P = 0⋅03) and tended to be different from the variation in the SDG (mean difference = -29⋅5 [CI -1305; 1⋅365]; v. DDG: 1588 [CI 181; 2994], P = 0⋅09). GH levels decreased significantly and similarly between groups (SDG: -0⋅61 [CI -0⋅26, -0⋅96], P = 0⋅00) v. DDG: -1⋅1 [CI -0⋅57, -1⋅62], P = 0⋅00). There was no evidence of a difference in PE incidence at the end of the intervention between the two diets. The DASH diet seems to favour PE-related biochemical markers.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND & AIMS: The Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet has been shown to effectively reduce blood pressure and body weight, but its effectiveness for reducing (cardiovascular) mortality rates has never been assessed in a clinical trial. Causal effects of dietary interventions are difficult to measure, due to practical limitations of randomized controlled diet trials. Target trial emulation can be used to improve causal inference in observational data. The aim of this study was to emulate a target trial assessing the relationship between compliance with the DASH diet and cardiovascular and all-cause mortality risk in patients with established CVD. METHODS: Using data from the Alpha Omega Cohort, we emulated a DASH diet trial in patients with a history of myocardial infarction (MI). Inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) was used to balance confounders over DASH-compliant and non-DASH-compliant participants. Hazard ratios (HRs) were estimated with IPT-weighted Cox models. RESULTS: Of 4365 patients (79% male, median age 69 years, >80% treated with lipid- and blood pressure-lowering medication), 598 were classified as DASH-compliant (compliance score ≥5 out of 9). During a median follow-up of 12.4 years, 2035 deaths occurred of which 903 (44%) were of cardiovascular origin. DASH compliance was not associated with all-cause mortality (HR 0.92, 95%CI 0.0.80-1.06) and cardiovascular mortality (HR 0.90, 95%CI 0.72-1.11). CONCLUSIONS: In an emulated target trial on the DASH diet in the Alpha Omega cohort no relation was found between DASH compliance and risk of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in patients with a history of MI. The DASH diet's effects may have been modified in this population by concomitant use of blood pressure-lowering medications.",

We conducted a nonrandomized crossover trial utilizing two plant-based diets (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension, or DASH, and Whole Food, Plant-Based, or WFPB) to assess acute changes in insulin requirements and associated markers among individuals with insulin-treated type 2 diabetes. METHODS: Participants (n = 15) enrolled in a 4-week trial with sequential, one-week phases: Baseline, DASH 1, WFPB, and DASH 2. Each diet was ad libitum and meals were provided. RESULTS: Compared to baseline, daily insulin usage was 24%, 39%, and 30% lower after DASH 1, WFPB, and DASH 2 weeks respectively (all p < 0.01). Insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) was 49% lower (p < 0.01) and the insulin sensitivity index was 38% higher (p < 0.01) at the end of the WFPB week before regressing toward baseline during DASH 2. Total, LDL, and HDL cholesterol, leptin, urinary glucose, and hsCRP decreased to a nadir at the end of the WFPB week before increasing during DASH 2. CONCLUSIONS: Adopting a DASH or WFPB diet can result in significant, rapid changes in insulin requirements, insulin sensitivity, and related markers among individuals with insulin-treated type 2 diabetes, with larger dietary changes producing larger benefits.",

Methods: Sixty two patients with NAFLD were equally allocated into either DASH or low-calorie diet (LCD) group for 8 weeks. The primary and secondary outcomes were determined before and after the trial. Results: Forty patients completed the trial. Significant within group differences were found in dietary saturated fat, selenium, vitamins A and E as well as body weight and body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference (WC) after the intervention (P<0.05). DASH diet showed greater significant change in systolic and diastolic blood pressure without significant differences between the groups after 8 weeks. Apart from serum high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and triglyceride/HDL-C, greater reductions were found not only in serum lipids and atherogenic indices (P<0.05) but also in serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST), AST to platelet ratio index (APRI) and lipid accumulation product (LAP) in DASH group in comparison to control group (P=0.008, P=0.019 and P=0.003, respectively). Nevertheless, there was not any difference in PAB level between the groups. Furthermore, adherence to DASH diet was more effective in alleviating liver steatosis compared with usual LCD (P=0.012). Conclusion: Adherence to DASH diet appears to be more effective in improving obesity, atherogenic and liver steatosis biomarkers but not oxidative stress (OS) than usual LCD."

The diets covered in this review include the Mediterranean diet (MeDi), Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH), Mediterranean-DASH Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay (MIND), ketogenic diet, intermittent fasting, and weight loss management. The exercise approaches covered in this review include endurance, resistance, combined exercise programs, yoga, tai chi, and high-intensity interval training. Although valuable evidence is building concerning how diet and exercise influence cognitive performance and brain structure, many of the open questions in the field are concerned with why we see these effects.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association of the Mediterranean-Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay (MIND) diet with the risk of dementia in 3 prospective studies and a meta-analysis. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Cohort analyses included the Whitehall II study (WII), the Health and Retirement Study (HRS), and the Framingham Heart Study Offspring cohort (FOS), and the meta-analysis included 11 cohort studies. Participants were middle-aged and older women and men from WII in 2002 to 2004, HRS in 2013, and FOS in 1998 to 2001 without dementia at the study baseline. Data were analyzed from May 25 to September 1, 2022. EXPOSURES: MIND diet score was measured using food frequency questionnaires, and scores ranged from 0 to 15, with a higher score indicating higher adherence to the MIND diet. MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURES: Incident all-cause dementia, with cohort-specific definitions. RESULTS: Included in this study were 8358 participants (mean [SD] age, 62.2 [6.0] years; 5777 male [69.1%]) from WII, 6758 participants (mean [SD] age, 66.5 [10.4] years; 3965 female [58.7%]) from HRS, and 3020 participants (mean [SD] age, 64.2 [9.1] years; 1648 female [54.6%]) from FOS. The mean (SD) baseline MIND diet score was 8.3 (1.4) in WII, 7.1 (1.9) in HRS, and 8.1 (1.6) in FOS. Over 166 516 person-years, a total of 775 participants (220 in WII, 338 in HRS, and 217 in FOS) developed incident dementia. In the multivariable-adjusted Cox proportional hazard model, higher MIND diet score was associated with lower risk of dementia (pooled hazard ratio [HR] for every 3-point increment, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.72-0.95; P for trend = .01; I2 = 0%). The associations were consistently observed in subgroups defined by sex, age, smoking status, and body mass index. In the meta-analysis of 11 cohort studies with 224 049 participants (5279 incident dementia cases), the highest tertile of MIND diet score was associated with lower risk of dementia compared with the lowest tertile (pooled HR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.76-0.90; I2 = 35%). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Results suggest that adherence to the MIND diet was associated with lower risk of incident dementia in middle-aged and older adults. Further studies are warranted to develop and refine the specific MIND diet for different populations.",

The present study was designed to investigate the association between high adherence to the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH), Mediterranean (MeDi), and Mediterranean-DASH intervention for neurodegenerative delay (MIND) diet scores and the incidence of metabolically unhealthy phenotypes in adults across body mass index (BMI) categories. METHODS: In this cohort study, 512 subjects with metabolically healthy normal weight (MHNW) at baseline and 787 subjects with metabolically healthy overweight/obesity (MHOW/MHO) at baseline were included. Dietary intake was collected by a validated food frequency questionnaire, and DASH, MeDi, and MIND scores were calculated. The Joint Interim Statement (JIS) criteria were used to define a metabolically unhealthy status. RESULTS: A total of 137 and 388 subjects with metabolically unhealthy normal weight (MUNW) and metabolically unhealthy overweight/obesity (MUOW/MUO) phenotypes, respectively, were observed, over a mean of 5.91 years of follow-up. The Cox proportional hazard regression indicated participants in the third tertile of the DASH score had a lower risk of the MUNW phenotype (HR: 0.59; 95% CI: 0.37-0.92) than those in the lowest tertile. Similarly, the highest adherence to the MeDi and MIND scores was also linked to a 46% (HR: 0.54; 95% CI: 0.36-0.81) and 47% (HR: 0.53; 95% CI: 0.34-0.83) lower risk of the MUNW phenotype, respectively. As well, there was an inverse relationship between the highest adherence to the DASH (HR: 0.66; 95% CI: 0.50-0.86), MeDi (HR: 0.74; 95% CI: 0.58-0.93), and MIND (HR: 0.57; 95% CI: 0.43-0.74) scores and the risk of MUOW/MUO. There was no interaction between age and the three dietary patterns in relation to a metabolically unhealthy phenotype. CONCLUSION: High compliance with the DASH, MeDi, and MIND scores was associated with a lower risk of MUNW. An inverse relationship between these three dietary patterns and the incidence of the metabolically unhealthy phenotype was also observed in individuals who had MHOW/MHO at baseline.",

Regression models were used to evaluate the association of DASH scores and common cardiovascular risk factors. RESULTS: Significant trends were observed across quintiles of DASH scores for systolic blood pressure, fasting blood sugar, triglyceride, total cholesterol, and its components (p < 0·05). After adjusting for potential confounders such as sex, age, ethnicity, residence, wealth score, physical activity, energy intake, and family history of heart disease, the multiple regression analysis for each cardiovascular risk factor revealed that being in the highest quintile of total DASH score (OR = 0.72, 95% CI 0.52-0.99) was negatively associated with hyperglycemia. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed a positive relationship between DASH diet adherence and lower serum levels of glucose, triglycerides, and cholesterol. Prospective studies are needed to confirm these findings."

      "abstract": "Background The Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet is recommended for cardiovascular disease prevention. We aimed to identify protein biomarkers of the DASH diet using data from 2 randomized feeding studies and validate them in an observational study, the ARIC (Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities) study. Methods and Results Large-scale proteomic profiling was conducted in serum specimens (SomaLogic) collected at the end of 8-week and 4-week DASH diet interventions in multicenter, randomized controlled feeding studies of the DASH trial (N=215) and the DASH-Sodium trial (N=396), respectively. Multivariable linear regression models were used to compare the relative abundance of 7241 proteins between the DASH and control diet interventions. Estimates from the 2 trials were meta-analyzed using fixed-effects models. We validated significant proteins in the ARIC study (N=10 490) using the DASH diet score. At a false discovery rate <0.05, there were 71 proteins that were different between the DASH diet and control diet in the DASH and DASH-Sodium trials. Nineteen proteins were validated in the ARIC study. The 19 proteins collectively improved the prediction of the DASH diet intervention in the feeding studies (range of difference in C statistics, 0.267-0.313; P<0.001 for both tests) and the DASH diet score in the ARIC study (difference in C statistics, 0.017; P<0.001) beyond participant characteristics. Conclusions We identified 19 proteins robustly associated with the DASH diet in 3 studies, which may serve as biomarkers of the DASH diet. These results suggest potential pathways that are impacted by consumption of the DASH diet. Registration URL: https://www.clinicaltrials.gov; Unique identifiers: NCT03403166, NCT00000608.",

      "abstract": "Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a highly prevalent condition defined by the presence of at least three out of five risk factors including central obesity, increased fasting glucose, high blood pressure, and dyslipidaemia. Metabolic syndrome is associated with a 2-fold increase in cardiovascular outcomes and a 1.5-fold increase in all-cause mortality. Excess energy intake and Western dietary pattern may influence the development of metabolic syndrome. By contrast, both Mediterranean diet (Med-diet) and Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet, with or without calorie restriction, have positive effects. For the prevention and management of MetS, it is recommended to increase the daily intake of fiber-rich and low-glycaemic-index foods and the consumption of fish and dairy products, especially yogurt and nuts. Moreover, it is advisable to consume a large variety of unprocessed cereals, legumes, and fruit. Finally, it is suggested to replace saturated fatty acids with monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids and to limit the consumption of free sugars to less than 10% of the total energy intake. The aim of this narrative review is to analyze current evidence on the different dietary patterns and nutrients that may affect prevention and treatment of MetS and to discuss the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms.",

The relation of healthy diet patterns to CR remains to be elucidated. METHODS: Using longitudinal cognitive data and post mortem neuropathology from 578 deceased older adults, we examined associations between the Mediterranean-DASH Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay (MIND) diet at baseline and two standardized CR measures reflecting higher cognitive levels over time (CR   Level ¯  $_{\\overline {{\\rm{Level}}}} $  ), and slower decline (CRSlope ), than expected given neuropathology. RESULTS: Compared to individuals in the lowest tertile of MIND score, those in the top tertile had higher CR   Level ¯  $_{\\overline {{\\rm{Level}}}} $  (mean difference [MD] = 0.34; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.14, 0.55) and CRSlope (MD = 0.27; 95% CI = 0.05, 0.48), after multivariable adjustment. Overall MIND score was more strongly related to CR than the individual food components. DISCUSSION: The MIND diet is associated with both higher cognition and slower rates of cognitive decline, after controlling for neuropathology, indicating the MIND diet may be important to cognitive resilience.",

      "abstract": "Western-type diet with high salt and sugar, sedentary behavior, obesity, tobacco and alcoholism are important risk factors for hypertension. This review aims to highlight the role of western diet-induced oxidative stress and inflammation in the pathogenesis of hypertension and the role of various types of diets in its prevention with reference to dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) diet. It seems that it is crucial to alter the western type of diet because such diets can also predispose all CVDs. Western diet-induced oxidative stress is characterized by excessive production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) with an altered oxidation-reduction (redox) state, leading to a marked increase in inflammation and vascular dysfunction. Apart from genetic and environmental factors, one important cause for differences in the prevalence of hypertension in various countries may be diet quality, deficiency in functional foods, and salt consumption. The role of the DASH diet has been established. However, there are gaps in knowledge about the role of some Indo-Mediterranean foods and Japanese foods, which have been found to decrease blood pressure (BP) by improving vascular function. The notable Indo-Mediterranean foods are pulses, porridge, spices, and millets; fruits such as guava and blackberry and vegetables, which may also decrease BPs. The Japanese diet consists of soya tofu, whole rice, in particular medical rice, vegetables and plenty of fish rich in fish oil, fish peptides and taurine that are known to decrease BPs. Epidemiological studies and randomized, controlled trials have demonstrated the role of these diets in the prevention of hypertension and metabolic diseases. Such evidence is still meager from Japan, although the prevalence of hypertension is lower (15-21%) compared to other developed countries, which may be due to the high quality of the Japanese diet. Interestingly, some foods, such as berries, guava, pumpkin seeds, carrots, soya beans, and spices, have been found to cause a decrease in BPs. Omega-3 fatty acids, fish peptide, taurine, dietary vitamin D, vitamin C, potassium, magnesium, flavonoids, nitrate and l-arginine are potential nutrients that can also decrease BPs. Larger cohort studies and controlled trials are necessary to confirm our views.",

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: No evidence-based prevention strategies currently exist for cancer-related cognitive decline (CRCD). Although patients are often advised to engage in healthy lifestyle activities (e.g., nutritious diet), little is known about the impact of diet on preventing CRCD. This secondary analysis evaluated the association of pre-treatment diet quality indices on change in self-reported cognition during chemotherapy. METHODS: Study participants (n = 96) completed the Block Brief Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ) before receiving their first infusion and the PROMIS cognitive function and cognitive abilities questionnaires before infusion and again 5 days later (i.e., when symptoms were expected to be their worst). Diet quality indices included the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH), Alternate Mediterranean Diet (aMED), and a low carbohydrate diet index and their components. Descriptive statistics were generated for demographic and clinical variables and diet indices. Residualized change models were computed to examine whether diet was associated with change in cognitive function and cognitive abilities, controlling for age, sex, cancer type, treatment type, depression, and fatigue. RESULTS: Study participants had a mean age of 59 ± 10.8 years and 69% were female. Although total diet index scores did not predict change in cognitive function or cognitive abilities, higher pre-treatment ratio of aMED monounsaturated/saturated fat was associated with less decline in cognitive function and cognitive abilities at 5-day post-infusion (P ≤ .001). CONCLUSIONS: Higher pre-treatment ratio of monounsaturated/saturated fat intake was associated with less CRCD early in chemotherapy. Results suggest greater monounsaturated fat and less saturated fat intake could be protective against CRCD during chemotherapy.",

      "abstract": "Although modern risk estimators, such as the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Pooled Cohort Equation, play a central role in the decisions of patients to start pharmacologic therapy to prevent atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), there is limited evidence to inform expectations for 10-year ASCVD risk reduction from established lifestyle interventions. Using data from the original DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) trial, we determined the effects of adopting the DASH diet on 10-year ASCVD risk compared with adopting a control or a fruits and vegetables (F/V) diet. The DASH trial included 459 adults aged 22 to 75 years without CVD and not taking antihypertensive or diabetes mellitus medications, who were randomized to controlled feeding of a control diet, an F/V diet, or the DASH diet for 8 weeks. We determined 10-year ASCVD risk with the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Pooled Cohort Equation based on blood pressure and lipids measured before and after the 8-week intervention. Compared with the control diet, the DASH and F/V diets changed 10-year ASCVD risk by -10.3% (95% confidence interval [CI] -14.4 to -5.9) and -9.9% (95% CI -14.0 to -5.5) respectively; these effects were more pronounced in women and Black adults. There was no difference between the DASH and F/V diets (-0.4%, 95% CI -6.9 to 6.5). ASCVD reductions attributable to the difference in systolic blood pressure alone were -14.6% (-17.3 to -11.7) with the DASH diet and -7.9% (-10.9 to -4.8) with the F/V diet, a net relative advantage of 7.2% greater relative reduction from DASH compared with F/V. This was offset by the effects on high-density lipoprotein of the DASH diet, which increased 10-year ASCVD by 8.8% (5.5 to 12.3) compared with the more neutral effect of the F/V diet of -1.9% (-5.0 to 1.2). In conclusion, compared with a typical American diet, the DASH and F/V diets reduced 10-year ASCVD risk scores by about 10% over 8 weeks. These findings are informative for counseling patients on both choices of diet and expectations for 10-year ASCVD risk reduction.",

METHODS: In the Rotterdam Study, participants were followed for iOAG since 1991, with intervals of approximately 5 years. A total of 170 participants developed iOAG during follow-up. Participants with iOAG were matched with healthy controls on age and sex in a case:control ratio of 1:5. The associations between food frequency questionnaire-derived diet adherences (baseline) and iOAG were analyzed using multivariable conditional logistic regression analyses. The associations between the diet adherences and intraocular pressure (IOP; a risk factor for OAG) were assessed using multivariable linear regression analyses. RESULTS: Greater adherence to the MIND diet was associated with a decreased iOAG risk (odds ratio [95% confidence interval]: 0.80 [0.66 to 0.96], for each 10-percent increase in adherence). Food component analyses showed that, in particular a higher intake of green leafy vegetables, berries and fish tended to be protective for iOAG. No significant associations were observed between adherence to the Mediterranean diet or Dutch dietary guidelines and iOAG. Moreover, none of the three examined diets were associated with IOP. CONCLUSION: Adherence to the MIND diet was significantly associated with a lower incidence of OAG in contrast to adherence to the Mediterranean diet or the Dutch dietary guidelines. As this association was IOP-independent, the MIND diet may be particularly relevant for the prevention of neurodegeneration in the eye.",

METHODS AND RESULTS: For this randomized clinical trial, we recruited patients aged 60 years or older with T2DM and uncontrolled hypertension. One group (DASH) received only DASH dietary guidance, while the other group (DASHPED) received dietary guidance and encouragement to walk with a pedometer. Outcomes of interest were (1) blood pressure, (2) physical activity, (3) weight, body mass index (BMI), and body composition, and (4) biochemical variables. Measurements were taken at baseline and 16 weeks after the intervention. We included 35 patients in the analysis. At the end of the study, the DASHPED group had an mean increase in physical activity of 1721 steps/day. Both groups displayed significantly reduced weight, BMI, and waking diastolic pressures on ambulatory blood pressure monitoring after the intervention. A trend of reduced sleeping diastolic pressure was found in the DASHPED group. Changes in weight, BMI, muscle mass, body fat, waist-hip ratio, glycemic control, lipid profile, and insulin sensitivity did not differ between the groups. CONCLUSION: There was no difference in outcomes between the group that only dieted and the group that also performed increased physical activity, despite a significant increase in exercise. This reinforces the importance of dietary changes in immediate blood pressure control.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cancer worldwide, and the incidence and mortality rates continue to increase annually. Many factors, including genetic, immune, and environmental factors, influence the occurrence and development of CRC. Along with the economic development, changes in lifestyle, especially dietary factors, have been shown to greatly affect the progression of CRC. Increasing evidence showed that dietary patterns influence the risk of CRC and affect CRC treatment. The present review describes the role of diet in the prevention and treatment of CRC with the hope that doctors attach importance to dietary patterns in educating patients with CRC or at risk of CRC and that diet may be regarded as an auxiliary treatment strategy to improve patients' outcomes. METHODS: English language articles published from 2000 to December 2021 in PubMed and Embase were identified by searching titles for keywords including \"diet\", \"colorectal cancer\", \"dietary pattern\", and \"dietary factor\"; 101 articles were selected for review. KEY CONTENT AND FINDINGS: The present review describes the role of different dietary patterns and factors in the prevention and treatment of CRC. We found that dietary intervention is closely related to the occurrence, development, and prognosis of CRC. Adherence to the Mediterranean diet (MD), the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet, fasting, vegetarian diets and the ketogenic diet (KD) were found to reduce the risk of CRC, prolong patient survival, and delay disease progression. Moderate intake of dietary fiber (DF), omega-3 fatty acids, micronutrients (e.g., calcium, iron, and selenium), and vitamins have been shown to be beneficial in the prevention and treatment of CRC. Conversely, diets high in fat or sugar and those rich in red meat or processed meat promote CRC. CONCLUSIONS: People at high risk of CRC and those with CRC are recommended to eat a plant-based diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains with appropriate DF intake and to avoid high levels of processed meat, red meat, and highly refined grains."

      "abstract": "Background: People with cystic fibrosis (PWCF) have increased energy requirements. However, in recent years concerns have emerged regarding the 'cystic fibrosis (CF) diet' in terms of reliance on energy-dense, nutrient poor foods, which tend to be higher in saturated fat, sugar, and salt. These foods lack essential nutrients and are aetiologically linked with diet-related chronic diseases. The aim is to explore habitual dietary intakes in PWCF and (i) assess adherence to CF dietary guidelines and population specific healthy eating guidelines; (ii) derive a diet quality score and the inflammatory potential for the average diet consumed by PWCF and assess associations with patient reported outcome measures; (iii) assess drivers for current consumption patterns and enablers and barriers to eating a healthy diet. Methods: The aim is to recruit between 100-180 PWCF. A mixed methods study will be performed. Using three-day food diaries and food frequency questionnaires, aims (i) and (ii) will be addressed. The Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score and Healthy Eating Index-International (HEI-I) will derive diet quality scores. The Dietary Inflammatory Index (DII®) will ascertain inflammatory potential of the diet. Validated questionnaires will be used to report health related quality of life measures. Online focus groups and semi-structured interview with PWCF will address aim (iii). Conclusions: It is timely to revise dietary priorities and targets for CF. However, a greater understanding of what adults with CF currently consume and what they require in terms of nutrition and dietary guidance into the future is needed. In doing so, this research will help to clarify nutrition priorities and simplify the dietary aspects of CF treatment, thereby supporting adherence."

      "abstract": "The Mediterranean-DASH Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay (MIND) diet is an eating pattern associated with multiple health benefits, including the conservation of skeletal muscle. The Hand Grip Strength (HGS) is the most frequently used indicator of muscle functional capacity and muscle strength for clinical purposes. The current study aims to investigate the association between adherence to MIND diet and prevention of age-associated decline in muscle strength among the Kurdish population in Iran. This cross-sectional study was performed using data from Ravansar non-communicable diseases (RaNCD) cohort study on 3181 adults (48.5% men) aged 35-65 years. The dietary intake of the studied participants was assessed using a 114-item food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) developed by RaNCD cohort study. The MIND diet and the major dietary patterns were identified based on the participants' dietary intake and three dietary patterns emerged including plant-based diet, high protein diet, and unhealthy diet. Hand grip strength (HGS) was measured using a hand-held hydraulic handgrip dynamometer and poor HGS was defined as HGS less than 32.8 and 20.5 kg in men and women, respectively. Compared with participants in the lowest category of MIND diet, those in the highest category had lower odds of poor HGS (OR: 0.65; CI 95%: 0.51-0.83). Furthermore, participants who were in third tertiles of plant-based and high protein diet were more likely 37% and 33% lower odds ratio of poor HGS (OR: 0.63; CI 95%: 0.5-0.79), (OR: 0.67; CI 95%: 0.54-0.84), respectively. On the other hand, greater adherence to the unhealthy diet was increased odds of poor HGS (OR: 1.39; CI 95%: 1.11-1.74). Overall, our findings suggest that adherence to the MIND diet and high protein diet may be associated with higher HGS, while adherence to the unhealthy diet can increase the odds of age-associated poor HGS in the Kurdish population.",

METHODS: This is a longitudinal observational study. Participants (N = 960) from the Israel Diabetes and Cognitive Decline (IDCD) study were included in this study. A multivariable-adjusted model including all three dietary patterns concurrently was developed to investigate their independent effect on cognitive decline. RESULTS: The mean follow up was 4.1 ± 2.1 years. While high adherence to both the MIND and the MEDI diet was associated with a slower decline, in the multivariable model only the associations of higher MEDI diet intake with greater decline in global cognition and in executive functions remained significant (β = 0.013, SE = 0.006; P = 0.042; β = 0.001, SE = 0.008, Pv = 0.023 respectively).

We examined whether adherence to the MIND diet could modify the association of genetic risk for AD with incident dementia. We used three ongoing US cohorts: Chicago Health and Aging Project (CHAP, n = 2449), Rush Memory and Aging Project (MAP, n = 725), and Women’s Health Initiative Memory Study (WHIMS, n = 5308). Diagnosis of dementia was based on clinical neurological examination and standardized criteria. Repeated measures of global cognitive function were available in MAP and CHAP. Self-reported adherence to MIND was estimated using food-frequency questionnaires. Global and pathway-specific genetic scores (GS) for AD were derived. Cox proportional hazard, logistic regression, and mixed models were used to examine associations of MIND, GS, and GS-MIND interactions with incident dementia and cognitive decline. Higher adherence to MIND and lower GS were associated with a lower risk of dementia in MAP and WHIMS and a slower rate of cognitive decline in MAP (p < 0.05). MIND or GS were not associated with incident dementia or cognitive decline in CHAP. No gene−diet interaction was replicated across cohorts.

The aim of this review is to address the different models of healthy DP with their peculiarities and nutritional components as well as their importance in the management of CVD. RECENT FINDINGS: Classical cardiovascular risk factors such as hypertension, dyslipidaemia and diabetes are strongly influenced by diet and physical activity. However, current evidence supports the role of emerging risk factors such as inflammatory status, oxidative stress and endothelial function in the development of CVD. Likewise, recent evidence explores how healthy DP can modulate CVD risk through these risk factors. SUMMARY: Although the Mediterranean diet (MedDiet) is the paradigm of the healthy DP in the light of current scientific evidence, there are other DP that we should be aware of due to their results in epidemiological studies, randomized clinical trials (RCTs) and meta-analyses on CVD risk modulation. The best-analysed DP are the MedDiet, Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH), the Nordic DP, the Vegetarian DP, the Portfolio DP, the Low-carbohydrate DP and the Planetary Health diet initiative.",

This study evaluated the short-term effects of a modest salt intake reduction combined with the Chinese Modified Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (CM-DASH) diet on sodium and potassium intake, mean arterial pressure (MAP), and pulse pressure (PP) in hypertensive patients with type II diabetes. METHODS: Sixty-one participants were randomized to the intervention group (52% low-sodium salt and DASH) and control group (normal salt and DASH). An 8-week dietary intervention was applied. Daily salt intake, blood pressure (BP), and drug use were recorded every week. Twenty-four-hour urine, casual urine, and blood samples were measured at baseline, the 4th week, and the end of the intervention. RESULTS: Fifty-nine patients (25 men) completed the entire study. Sodium intake decreased by 1259.66 (792.76, 1726.56)/705.80 (149.21, 1262.39) mg/day after 4 weeks (intervention: P < .001; control: P = .015). Potassium intake increased by 641.14 (73.31, 1208.96)/43.43 (-259.66, 346.53) mg/day (intervention: P = .028); MAP decreased by 9.06 (6.69, 11.43)/7.16 (4.03, 10.28) mmHg (both: P < .001); PP decreased by 7.97 (3.05, 12.88)/5.74 (2.55,8.94) mmHg (intervention: P = .002; control: P = .001) after 8 weeks. However, the difference between the two groups was not statistically significant. CONCLUSION: Modest salt reduction and the CM-DASH diet for hypertensive patients with type II diabetes can achieve short-term salt reduction effects. The effect on changing salt-eating habits needs to be investigated with an extended follow-up.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Comorbidity, along with aging, affects stroke-induced health-related quality of life (HRQoL). We examined the potential role of diet quality in modifying the association between comorbidity and HRQoL in patients with stroke. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted on 951 patients with stroke from December 2019 to December 2020 across Vietnam. Comorbidity was assessed using the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) items and classified into two groups (none vs. one or more). Diet quality was evaluated using the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension Quality (DASH-Q) questionnaire, and HRQoL was measured using the RAND-36, with a higher score indicating better diet quality or HRQoL, respectively. Besides, socio-demographics, health-related behaviors (e.g., physical activity, smoking, and drinking), disability (using WHODAS 2.0), and health literacy were also assessed. Linear regression analysis was utilized to explore the associations and interactions. RESULTS: The proportion of patients with stroke aged ≥65 years and having comorbidity were 53.7 and 49.9%, respectively. The HRQoL scores were 44.4 ± 17.4. The diet quality was associated with higher HRQoL score (regression coefficient, B, 0.14; (95% confidence interval, 95% CI, 0.04, 0.23; p = 0.004), whereas comorbidity was associated with lower HRQoL score (B, -7.36; 95% CI, -9.50, -5.23; p < 0.001). In interaction analysis, compared to patients without comorbidity and having the lowest DASH-Q score, those with comorbidity and higher DASH-Q score had a higher HRQoL score (B, 0.21; 95% CI, 0.03, 0.39; p = 0.021). CONCLUSION: The findings showed that good diet quality could modify the adverse impact of comorbidity on HRQoL in patients with stroke. Diet quality should be considered as a strategic intervention to improve the HRQoL of patients with stroke, especially those with comorbidity, and to promote healthier aging."

The current study aimed to explore the relationship between different dietary patterns, cognitive performance, and potential cardio-metabolic mechanisms for this relationship. Participants were recruited using a diet screening tool to ensure that the cohort had a range of diet quality ranging from relatively poor to relatively healthy. In a sample of 141 middle-aged adults (age: M = 52.84 years, SD = 6.87 years), multiple 24 h diet recalls were collected and used to score adherence to the Mediterranean diet, dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) diet, and Mediterranean-DASH diet intervention for neurodegenerative delay (MIND) diet. Metabolic risk was assessed using the metabolic syndrome severity score (MetSSS) and arterial stiffness. Cognitive performance was assessed using the Swinburne University Computerized Cognitive Assessment Battery (SUCCAB). Adherence to the MIND diet was significantly related to Stroop Processing domain (β = 0.19, p = 0.035). None of the dietary patterns were significantly related to MetSSS or arterial stiffness. However, adherence to the DASH diet was significantly associated with two cardio-metabolic measures including lower augmentation index (β = -0.17, p = 0.032) and lowered cholesterol (β = -0.18, p = 0.041). Interestingly, two cardio-metabolic risk factors were also associated with better cognitive performance: MetSSS (β = 0.21, p = 0.010) and waist circumference (β = 0.22, p = 0.020). Together these findings suggest that diet in middle age may be important for cognitive functioning and cardio-metabolic risk. However, more research is needed in the form of randomized controlled trials to confirm the direction of these relationships."

We further investigated whether changes in individual dietary food groups in the DASH diet contribute to blood pressure. METHODS: Participants were randomized to the traditional DASH diet (n = 150) or the legume-based DASH diet (n = 150). Blood pressure and urinary sodium and potassium were measured at baseline and after 16-week interventions. An intention-to-treat approach with multiple imputations of missing data was applied. The restricted cubic spline (RCS) was applied to assess the linearity and explore the shape of the relationship between the changes in food groups and systolic blood pressure (SBP) in the two intervention groups. RESULTS: A reduction in SBP and urinary sodium was observed at week 16 in both dietary interventions, and this reduction was more significant in the legume-based DASH diet, than in the DASH diet. In the legume-based DASH diet, SBP decreased with the legume intake of more than 95.8 g/day (P nonlinear < 0.001). The multivariable RCS analysis showed a U-shaped relationship of refined grains, an L-shaped relationship of fruits, and a linear relationship of sweet, energy, sodium and vegetables intake with SBP. CONCLUSIONS: The DASH diet, enriched in legumes, could improve SBP in participants with type 2 diabetes. In DASH diet, the balance of consumption of refined grains and fruits along with higher vegetable consumption and lower sweet, sodium and energy intake reduced the SBP.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Understanding the genetic predisposition to cardiovascular disease (CVD) may help to improve clinical intervention strategies. Lifestyle factors, such as diet, may differ among ethnic groups and may, in turn, modify individuals' risks to diseases. OBJECTIVES: We examined the genetic predisposition to ever smoking in relation to CVD mortality and assessed whether such an association could be modified by dietary intake. METHODS: A total of 23,760 Chinese adults from the Singapore Chinese Heath Study who were free of cancer and CVD at recruitment (1993-1998) were included in the study. A weighted genetic risk score (wGRS) was calculated to define the genetically determined regular smoking behavior (never or ever). Multivariable-adjusted Cox regression models were used to assess the association between the wGRS and CVD mortality. We also conducted a 1-sample Mendelian randomization analysis for ever smoking and CVD mortality. RESULTS: Over a mean of 22.6 years of follow-up, 2301 CVD deaths were identified. A genetic predisposition to ever smoking was significantly associated with CVD mortality; the multivariable-adjusted HR of CVD mortality was 1.07 (95% CI: 1.03-1.12), with a per-SD increment in the wGRS. However, the Mendelian randomization analysis did not support a causal relationship between ever smoking and CVD mortality (OR, 1.13; 95% CI: 0.87-1.45). Additionally, the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score significantly modified the association between the smoking wGRS and CVD mortality; the association between a genetic predisposition to smoking and CVD mortality was only observed among individuals with a low DASH score (P-interaction = 0.004). CONCLUSIONS: A genetic predisposition to smoking was associated with CVD mortality in the Chinese population. In addition, we detected a significant interaction showing higher CVD mortality related to genetically determined smoking among those with lower DASH scores.",

Material and methods: sixty-one hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes were selected from the community and randomly allocated to a common salt group and low sodium salt group receiving the 8-week dietary intervention, in which weeks 1-2 was the dietary guidance phase, weeks 3-4 was the centralized feeding phase, and weeks 5-8 was the home medical care phase. Participants were followed up in the hospital once a week to collect information on outpatient blood pressure, salt, and drug use. Physical examinations were conducted at 4 weeks and the end of the intervention, as well as at baseline. Results: after the intervention, the blood pressure of both the low sodium group (SBP: -14.32 mmHg, p < 0.001; DBP: -6.32mmHg, p < 0.001) and the common salt group (SBP: -10.98 mmHg, p < 0.001; DBP: -5.24 mmHg, p = 0.001) decreased significantly with a more pronounced decrease in the low sodium group but no statistically significant differences between the two groups (SBP: -0.28 mmHg, p = 0.929; DBP: -3.32 mmHg, p = 0.093). At the end of the intervention, sodium intake was significantly decreased, but potassium intake was increased in the low sodium group (p < 0.05); however, the common salt group had no significant change. Conclusion: reducing sodium intake based on the modified DASH diet had a good effect on systolic and diastolic blood pressure in hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes. Sodium reduction based on the modified DASH diet is safe and effective, and can be used as a guide for healthy living in hypertensive patients.",

Also, the modulatory effects of rs7903146 variant in the transcription factor 7 like 2 (TCF7L2) gene that is associated with the risk of diabetes, were assessed on these cardiometabolic risk factors. METHODS: This study was a randomized controlled trial. Three-hundred participants, aged 30-65 years, whose TCF7L2 rs7903146 genotype was determined, were studied. The participants were randomly assigned to receive either the hypocaloric DASH diet or a hypocaloric legume-based DASH diet. The primary outcome was the difference in FPG change from baseline until the 16-week follow-up between the two dietary interventions. The secondary outcomes were differences in insulin resistance and lipid profile changes between the dietary intervention diets. RESULTS: A reduction in FPG, insulin, homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), triglyceride, total cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) was observed at week 16 in both hypocaloric dietary interventions. Compared to the DASH diet, the legume-based DASH diet decreased the FPG and HOMA-IR. There is no interaction between rs7903146 and intervention diets on glycemic parameters. CONCLUSION: The DASH diet, enrich in legumes, could improve the glycemic parameters in participants with type 2 diabetes, regardless of having rs7903146 risk or non-risk allele.

A low sodium high potassium (LSHP) healthy diet can be a predictor of overall dietary quality and is associated with higher diet costs. The present study was a randomised controlled-feeding trial, formulating menus of low sodium and potassium-rich healthy diet and comparing with usual diet (a control diet based on typical Indonesian diet) to assess the association of potassium intake in the menus with other nutritional contents and diet cost. Totally seventy menus, which consisted of LSHP diets and the usual diets for a 7-d cycle, were composed from the analysis of the Indonesian food composition database. The correlation coefficient of the potassium content of all menus with nutritional quality and diet cost was analysed using the Pearson test. Multiple linear regression analysis was performed to determine the most important nutrient in determining diet cost. A comparison of nutrition quality and diet cost from the two menus was analysed using the independent t-test. LSHP diet had significantly higher carbohydrate, protein, fibre, magnesium, calcium, vitamin C, potassium density and diet cost but lower total fat, saturated fat and energy density than the usual diet (P < 0⋅05). Furthermore, there was a strong positive correlation between fibre, potassium and diet cost (coefficient correlation of >0⋅8). Potassium is a nutrient that is closely related to diet quality although the cost of the diet often may inhibit its intake. A targeted and effective strategy is required to provide affordable food for achieving a sustainable nutrient-rich diet.",

For this study we tested the response of a calorie-restricted Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet on changes in myostatin, follistatin, and mystatin:follistatin ratio levels after 12 weeks in comparison to basline in adults aged 65 years and older. Furthermore we evaluated correlations between changes in myostatin, body composition and cardiometabolic biomarkers in this cohort of older adults. METHODS: This was a controlled-feeding diet intervention study in which females (n = 17) and males (n = 11) aged 65 years and older consumed either 85 g (n = 15) or 170 g (n = 13) of fresh lean beef within a standardized DASH diet for 12-weeks. Myostatin and follistatin concentrations were measured from fasted blood samples collected at 5 timepoints throughout the 12-week feeding intervention period. Correlations were assessed between changes in myostatin and follistatin levels and measures of body composition and cardiometabolic biomarkers. RESULTS: There were no differences (p > 0.05) in circulating myostatin or follistatin levels between the beef intake groups. However, with beef groups combined myostatin decreased by 17.6% (p = 0.006) and the myostatin-to-follistatin ratio decreased by 16.5% (p < 0.001) in response to the study diet. Decreased myostatin was positively correlated with reductions in waist circumference (R2 = 0.163; p = 0.033) and fat mass (R2 = 0.233; p = 0.009). There was an inverse relationship between decreased myostatin and increased strength-to-weight ratio (R2 = 0.162; p = 0.034). The change in myostatin-to-follistatin ratio was associated with the change in skeletal muscle mass-to-fat mass ratio (R2 = 0.176; p = 0.026). Decreased myostatin was positively correlated with reductions in total cholesterol (R2 = 0.193; p = 0.012), LDL-C (R2 = 0.163; p = 0.031), insulin (R2 = 0.234; p = 0.009), and HOMA-IR (R2 = 0.248; P = 0.007). There was no change (p > 0.05) in circulating follistatin concentrations in response to the diet intervention. CONCLUSIONS: The outcomes from this study suggest that a calorie-restricted DASH diet has the potential to reduce myostatin concentrations in older adults. Furthermore these outcomes support interrelationships between myostatin, body composition and cardiometabolic health in adults aged 65 years and older.

We aimed to review and synthesize current empirical research on this topic and provide considerations for healthcare providers working with adults who wish to optimize their cognition via dietary improvements. METHODS: We performed a narrative review of research published between January 2009 and May 2021 on 5 popular dietary interventions: the Mediterranean diet, Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH), the Mediterranean-DASH Intervention Diet for Neurodegenerative Delay (MIND), the ketogenic diet and intermittent fasting. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Of the 5 dietary interventions, the Mediterranean diet has been the most extensively investigated, and there is evidence supporting its cognitive benefits. However, operationalization of the Mediterranean diet varies across studies, rendering the results inconclusive. The DASH diet and the MIND diet have stronger operationalization and showed evidence of cognitive benefits. More longitudinal studies and/or randomized clinical trials should be conducted on these 2 relatively new interventions. Finally, there is limited research with human participants regarding the ketogenic diet and intermittent fasting, which are found to be cognitively protective within stringent parameters. Definitions for these 5 dietary patterns and practice tips and recommendations are provided.",

The purpose of this research was to evaluate the link between the MIND diet adherence and multiple sclerosis (MS), a degenerative neurological illness. METHODS: In a hospital-based case-control setting, 77 patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) and 148 healthy individuals were recruited. A validated 168-item semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire was used to assess participants' dietary intakes and the MIND diet score. A logistic regression model was used to evaluate the association between MIND diet adherence and MS. RESULTS: There was significant difference between RRMS and control groups in the median (Q1-Q3) of age (years, P value < 0.001), body mass index (BMI) (kg/m2, P value < 0.001), and total intake of calories (kcal, P value = 0.032), carbohydrates (g, P value = 0.003), animal-based protein (g, P value = 0.009), and fiber (g, P value = 0.001). Adherence to the MIND diet was associated with a reduced odds of MS [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 0.10, 95 percent confidence interval (95% CI) = 0.01-0.88, P for trend = 0.001]. MS odds was significantly lower in the last tertile of green leafy vegetables (aOR = 0.02, 95% CI = 0.00-0.21, P value < 0.001), other vegetables (aOR = 0.17, 95% CI = 0.04-0.73, P value = 0.001), butter and stick margarine (aOR = 0.20, 95% CI = 0.06-0.65, P value = 0.008), and beans (aOR = 0.05, 95% CI = 0.01-0.28, P value < 0.001) consumption. While it was significantly higher in the last tertile of cheese (aOR = 4.45, 95% CI = 1.70-11.6, P value = 0.003), poultry (aOR = 3.95, 95% CI = 1.01-15.5, P value = 0.039), pastries and sweets (aOR = 13.9, 95% CI = 3.04-64.18, P value < 0.001), and fried/fast foods (aOR = 32.8, 95% CI = 5.39-199.3, P value < 0.001). CONCLUSION: The MIND diet and its components, including green leafy vegetables, other vegetables, and beans, seem to decrease the odds of MS; besides butter and stick margarine, the MIND diet's unhealthy components seem to have the same protective effects, while pastries and sweets, cheese, poultry, and fried/fast foods have an inverse effect."

      "abstract": "Despite considerable advances in pharmacological treatments, hypertension remains a major cause of premature morbidity and mortality worldwide since elevated blood pressure (BP) adversely influences cardiovascular and renal outcomes. Accordingly, the current hypertension guidelines recommend the adoption of dietary modifications in all subjects with suboptimal BP levels. These modifications include salt intake reduction and a healthy diet, such as the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet or the Mediterranean diet (MedDiet), independently of the underlying antihypertensive drug treatment. However, dietary modifications for BP reduction in adults with prehypertension or hypertension are usually examined as stand-alone interventions and, to a lesser extent, in combination with other dietary changes. The purpose of the present review was to summarize the evidence regarding the BP effect of salt restriction in the context of the DASH diet and the MedDiet. We also summarize the literature regarding the effects of these dietary modifications when they are applied as the only intervention for BP reduction in adults with and without hypertension and the potent physiological mechanisms underlying their beneficial effects on BP levels. Available data of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) provided evidence about the significant BP-lowering effect of each one of these dietary strategies, especially among subjects with hypertension since they modulate various physiological mechanisms controlling BP. Salt reduction by 2.3 g per day in the DASH diet produces less than half of the effect on systolic blood pressure (SBP)/diastolic blood pressure (DBP) (-3.0/-1.6 mmHg) as it does without the DASH diet (-6.7/-3.5 mmHg). Although their combined effect is not fully additive, low sodium intake and the DASH diet produce higher SBP/DBP reduction (-8.9/-4.5 mmHg) than each of these dietary regimens alone. It is yet unsettled whether this finding is also true for salt reduction in the MedDiet.",

Effective, evidence-based interventions for HF prevention and management are needed to improve patient longevity, symptom control, and quality of life. Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet interventions can have a positive impact for HF patients. However, the absence of a consensus for comprehensive dietary guidelines and for pragmatic evidence limits the ability of health care providers to implement clinical recommendations. The refinement of medical nutrition therapy through precision nutrition approaches has the potential to reduce the burden of HF, improve clinical care, and meet the needs of diverse patients. The aim of this review is to summarize current evidence related to HF dietary recommendations including DASH diet nutritional interventions and to develop initial recommendations for DASH diet implementation in outpatient HF management. Articles involving human studies were obtained using the following search terms: Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH diet), diet pattern, diet, metabolism, and heart failure. Only full-text articles written in English were included in this review. As DASH nutritional interventions have been proposed, limitations of these studies are the small sample size and non-randomization of interventions, leading to less reliable evidence. Randomized controlled interventions are needed to offer definitive evidence related to the use of the DASH diet in HF management.",

METHODS: Data on 10,009 adults (mean age 51.8 y; 52% female) from the Australian Diabetes, Obesity, and Lifestyle study were used. An FFQ was used to calculate DGI, DII, and MIND at baseline. Cox proportional hazard models were used to estimate HRs and 95% CI of all-cause mortality, CVD mortality, and nonfatal CVD events (stroke; myocardial infarction) according to 1 SD increase in diet quality, adjusted for age, sex, education, smoking, physical activity, energy intake, history of stroke or heart attack, and diabetes and hypertension status. RESULTS: Deaths due to all-cause (n = 1955) and CVD (n = 520), and nonfatal CVD events (n = 264) were identified during mean follow-ups of 17.7, 17.4, and 9.6 y, respectively. For all-cause mortality, HRs associated with higher DGI, DII, and MIND were 0.94 (95% CI: 0.89, 0.99), 1.08 (95% CI: 1.02, 1.15), and 0.93 (95% CI: 0.89, 0.98), respectively. For CVD mortality, HRs associated with higher DGI, DII, and MIND were 0.93 (95% CI: 0.85, 0.99), 1.10 (95% CI: 1.00, 1.24), and 0.90 (95% CI: 0.82, 0.98), respectively. There was limited evidence of associations between diet quality and nonfatal CVD events. CONCLUSIONS: A better quality diet predicted lower risk of all-cause and CVD mortality in Australian adults, whereas a more inflammatory diet predicted higher mortality risk. These findings highlight the applicability of following Australian dietary guidelines, a Mediterranean-style diet, and a low-inflammatory diet for the reduction of all-cause and CVD mortality risk.",

To address this knowledge gap, we conducted a parallel-group, randomised controlled trial to evaluate the effect of the DASH diet on these health outcomes in women with migraine. Of 102 eligible women (20-50 years), fifty one randomised to the DASH and fifty one to the usual dietary advice (control) groups completed a 12-week intervention. The DASH diet was designed using a 7-d menu cycle to provide 15-20 % of total daily energy requirements from proteins, 25-30 % from fats and 55-60 % from carbohydrates. Dietary records and serum vitamin C levels were used to assess women's compliance with the DASH diet. The clinical symptoms of migraine (i.e., frequency, duration and severity) and quality of life and mental health (i.e., depression, anxiety and stress) outcomes were assessed in groups pre-and post-intervention. We observed greater decreases in the frequency (-3·00 v. -1·40, P = 0·025) and severity (-1·76 v. -0·59, P < 0·001) of migraine in the DASH v. control group post-intervention. Similarly, the DASH group exhibited a tendency towards greater decreases in migraine duration (-0·58 v. -0·33 d, P = 0·053) and had lower scores of depression (-4·50 v. -2·73, P = 0·019) and stress (-5·84 v. -2·98, P = 0·011) v. controls. However, the quality of life and anxiety outcomes remained comparable in groups post-intervention. Together, evidence supports the benefits of the DASH diet on improving migraine health outcomes in reproductive-aged women. Further research is needed to confirm our findings.",

Additionally, dietary patterns have an influence on the regulation of chronic inflammation. Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) include foods with an anti-inflammatory profile and that have positive impacts on body composition (BC), suggesting improvements in inflammatory processes. OBJECTIVE: To analyze the impact of the DASH diet on cellular immunity, anthropometric, biochemical and BC parameters in patients with overweight and obesity, who could present metabolic syndrome. METHODOLOGY: Lymphocyte subpopulations, biochemical parameters, anthropometric parameters, and BC before and 8 weeks after intervention with the DASH diet in persons with overweight and obesity were measured. RESULTS: Fifty-nine young adults participated in the study. After the intervention, no significant changes in biochemical parameters were observed, although a significant decrease in nearly all of the anthropometric and BC variables was found: waist circumference (p < 0.001), percentage and kilograms of fat (p < 0.001 and p < 0.025, respectively), VAT (p < 0.020), and weight (p < 0.001), as well as total lymphocytes and double-positive TCD4+ cells. A relation between changes in leukocyte subpopulations (monocytes, natural killer, helper and cytotoxic lymphocytes, and naive TCD4+ cells) and metabolic improvements (glucose, triglycerides, total cholesterol and LDL-c) was also found. CONCLUSIONS: The DASH diet promotes positive changes in lymphocyte subpopulations, anthropometric parameters and BC in persons with overweight and obesity. Future studies should elucidate the cellular and molecular mechanisms through which the DASH diet produces inmunometabolic improvement.",

OBJECTIVES: We aimed to investigate associations of the Mediterranean-Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay (MIND) diet with physical function and grip strength. METHODS: Data were obtained from men and women in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (mean ± SD age: 68 ± 14 y at first diet visit; n = 1358). Diet was assessed by FFQ. MIND diet score was calculated from 15 food groups, with a higher score indicating better diet quality; tertile categories of averaged MIND score across visits were used. Physical function was assessed using the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB), with a score < 10 indicative of impaired function, and the Health, Aging and Body Composition Physical Performance Battery (HABCPPB). The highest value of grip strength over 3 trials was used. Multivariable logistic and linear mixed-effects models were examined with repeated measurements of physical function and grip strength, respectively. RESULTS: MIND score was inversely associated with physical function impairment (per 1-point increment: OR: 0.81; 95% CI: 0.71, 0.93; P < 0.01), and with each SPPB component, over a median 6 y of follow-up. Participants in the highest compared with the lowest tertile of MIND diet score had 57% lower odds of functional impairment (OR: 0.43; 95% CI: 0.25, 0.73; P < 0.01), and slower decline by the HABCPPB. Men and women in the highest compared with the lowest tertiles of MIND score had 1.86-kg (95% CI: 0.33, 3.40 kg; P < 0.05) and 1.24-kg (95% CI: 0.04, 2.45 kg; P < 0.05) greater grip strength, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Adherence to the MIND dietary pattern was associated with lower odds of physical function impairment and decline, and with better muscle strength, indicating that the MIND dietary pattern may be protective of physical functional health in older adults.",

The evidence for the effect of the modified DASH diet on blood pressure reduction was inconsistent. The study was designed to assess the effects of the modified DASH diet on blood pressure (BP) in hypertensive and pre-hypertensive adults. Methods: We searched Medline, Embase, CENTRAL, CNKI, VIP, Wanfang Data, SINOMED, Google Scholar, the World Health Organization's International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and Clinicaltrials.gov from inception to July 1st, 2021. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the effects of the modified DASH diet on systolic and diastolic BP, cardiovascular risk factors (body weight, body mass index, waist circumference, fasting glucose, blood lipids), cardiovascular events, and all-cause mortality were included. Statistical analysis was performed using Stata software. Risk of bias was assessed with the Cochrane tool and quality of evidence with GRADE. Results: A total of 10 RCTs were included. Compared with control diet, the modified DASH diet could reduce mean systolic (-3.26 mmHg; 95% confidence interval -5.58, -0.94 mmHg; P = 0.006) and diastolic (-2.07 mmHg; 95% confidence interval -3.68, -0.46 mmHg; P = 0.01) BP. Compared with the controlling diet, the modified DASH diet could reduce systolic BP to a greater extent in trials with a mean baseline BP ≥ 140/90 mmHg compared with <140/90 mmHg. Diastolic BP reduction was greater when the mean body mass index was ≥30 kg/m2 than <30 kg/m2. Diastolic BP reduction was more marked in trials with a follow-up time of >8 weeks compared with ≤8 weeks. The modified DASH diet could affect mean waist circumference (difference: 1.57 cm; 95% confidence interval -2.98, -0.15) and triglyceride concentration (difference: 1.04 mol/L; 95% confidence interval -1.47, -0.60). Conclusions: The modified DASH diet can reduce BP, waist circumference, and triglyceride concentration in hypertension patients. A higher baseline BP is associated with more marked systolic and diastolic BP reduction. Systematic Review Registration: PROSPERO registration number: CRD42020190860."

To date, no pharmacological treatments have been approved and lifestyle modifications including reduced caloric intake targeting a 7%-10% weight loss from baseline assessment represent the standard approach. Mediterranean diet has been recommended as the best dietary pattern since it is easy to follow and, independently of caloric intake its nutritional components have beneficial metabolic effects that not only improve steatosis but also risk factors for cardiovascular events, the leading cause of morbidity/mortality in individuals with NAFLD. Other dietary patterns such as ketogenic diet and Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet can be used in patients with NAFLD. Recently, intermittent fasting diets have gained popularity among healthy individuals and have been proposed as a safe and effective treatment for the metabolic syndrome in experimental and in a few human studies. In this narrative review, we aim to summarize the evidence for the available dietary approaches for patients with NAFLD.",

Hence, we conducted a parallel-group, randomized controlled trial to investigate this issue. METHODS: Of the 102 women who met all the inclusion criteria, 51 individuals were randomized to the DASH diet group and 51 to the usual dietary advice group to receive allocated intervention for three months. In order to assess the compliance of participants to the DASH diet, dietary records, and serum vitamin C levels were examined. Parameters of OS status (e.g. nitric oxide (NO), total antioxidant capacity (TAC), total oxidative status (TOS), malondialdehyde (MDA), and oxidative stress index (OSI)) and clinical indices of migraine (e.g. migraine index (MI), headache dairy result (HDR), and migraine headache index score (MHIS)) were assessed at the beginning and the end of the study. RESULTS: There was a significant reduction in NO (-5.75 vs. + 4.18, P = 0.025) and TOS (-1.55 vs. + 0.71, P = 0.034), and a marginally significant reduction in OSI (-0.10 vs. + 0.14, P = 0.060) in the DASH group compared with the control. Compliance with the DASH diet resulted in a significant decrease in the score of MI (-31.33 vs. - 15.09), HDR (-5.04 vs. -2.51), and MHIS (-44.21 vs. -26.74). Moreover, no significant change was observed in TAC, MDA, and total thiol content. CONCLUSION: This type of dietary approach can be considered as a complementary treatment for migraine patients, also further investigations are needed to replicate our findings.Trial registration: Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials identifier: IRCT20121216011763N38.",

Therefore, the present study aimed to evaluate the association between the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) and Mediterranean (MED) dietary patterns and MetS. This cross-sectional study was conducted on the data from recruitment phase of prospective studies on Iranian adults known as Yazd Health Study (YaHS) and Yazd Nutrition Study (TAMYZ). MetS was diagnosed among 2,221 adults based on the Adult Treatment Panel III criteria. The participants' dietary intake was assessed by a validated food frequency questionnaire. According to the predefined methods, DASH and MED scores were calculated. Multivariate logistic regression was used to evaluate the relationship of DASH and MED dietary patterns with MetS. The prevalence of MetS was 28.8% in the present study. Women who were in the highest quintile of DASH in comparison with those who were in the first quintile tended to decrease the odds of MetS after adjusting for the potential confounders (OR: 0.50, CI: 0.27-0.95). There was a significant decreasing trend in the odds of MetS across increasing quintiles of the DASH in women (p-trend = .006). Also, the highest adherence to DASH reduced the odds of abdominal obesity (OR: 0.34, CI: 0.15-0.77) in women. Although adherence to MED dietary pattern had no significant relationship with MetS, moderate adherence to this dietary pattern could decrease the odds of fasting blood glucose levels (OR: 0.57, CI: 0.33-0.97) and abdominal obesity (OR: 0.42, CI: 0.20-0.87) in women. We found evidence indicating a significant protective association between DASH and METs and its component in women.

METHODS: Electronic searches for included studies were performed in MEDLINE, SCOPUS, EMBASE, Cochrane Trial Register, and ISI Web of Science until 30 March 2020. Study selection, data extraction, and quality assessment were fulfilled independently by two reviewers using predefined criteria. Studies were included if they assessed the role of adherence to DASH diet in risk of incidence, prevalence, and development of MetS. RESULTS: Twelve eligible studies (eight observational studies and four clinical trials) were identified. Despite methodological heterogeneity, limited statistical power, and the cross-sectional nature of most of observational studies, greater adherence to DASH diet was associated with reduced risk of MetS. However, results for change in metabolic characteristics based on dietary intervention with DASH diet in some interventional studies were somewhat controversial. CONCLUSIONS: The current study demonstrates that, based on observational studies, greater adherence to a DASH diet is inversely associated with MetS presence and progression. However, more interventional studies are needed in this regard to clarify the exact effect of DASH diet on MetS."

How subjective impressions of this diet contribute to adherence has not been thoroughly explored. The OmniCarb trial, which compared DASH-style diets varying in glycemic index (GI) and carbohydrate amount, surveyed subjective impressions of such diets. OBJECTIVES: We examined the effects of GI and carbohydrate amount on qualitative aspects of diet acceptability through secondary outcomes in the OmniCarb trial. METHODS: OmniCarb was a randomized, crossover trial of 4 DASH-style diets varying by GI (≥65 compared with ≤45) and carbohydrate amount (40% compared with 58% kcal) in overweight or obese (BMI ≥25 kg/m2) adults (n = 163). Participants consumed each diet in random order over 5-wk periods, separated by 2-wk washouts. At baseline and the end of each feeding period, participants rated hunger, diet satisfaction, and gastrointestinal symptoms (diarrhea/loose stools, constipation, bloating, nausea, and heartburn). RESULTS: Participant mean age was 52 y, with 52% women, 51% non-Hispanic black, and 56% obese (BMI ≥30). Compared with baseline, all intervention diets decreased heartburn, increased diarrhea/loose stools, and increased bloating, but did not significantly affect constipation or nausea. Compared with lower carbohydrate diets, higher carbohydrate diets increased hunger (RR: 1.16; 95% CI: 1.04, 1.30), increased diet satisfaction (RR: 1.10; 95% CI: 1.01, 1.20), and increased heartburn (RR: 1.49; 95% CI: 1.09, 2.04). Compared with lower GI diets, higher GI diets did not affect hunger (RR: 0.92; 95% CI: 0.83, 1.02), decreased diet satisfaction (RR: 0.83; 95% CI: 0.75, 0.92), and did not affect heartburn (RR: 0.89; 95% CI: 0.70, 1.13). There were no between-diet differences for diarrhea/loose stools, constipation, bloating, and nausea. CONCLUSIONS: Although a higher carbohydrate amount in DASH-style diets can increase diet satisfaction, it can also decrease satiety and increase heartburn in adults with overweight or obesity.This trial is registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT00608049.",

      "abstract": "Cognitive decline is a rapidly increasing public health concern. A healthy diet has potential in preserving brain and maintaining cognitive health. This systematic review was designed to evaluate the relationship between Mediterranean-DASH diet intervention for neurodegenerative delay (MIND) diet and cognitive functioning in older adults. PubMed, SCOPUS, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Google Scholar databases were searched to extract original studies on humans published until July 2020, without date restrictions. Articles that evaluated the association between MIND diet and cognitive performance in older adults were included. Duplicated and irrelevant studies were screened out and data were obtained through critical analysis. Quality of the articles and risk of bias was assessed by Newcastle-Ottawa and Cochrane Collaboration's quality assessment tools. Of the 135 studies retrieved, 13 articles (9 cohort, 3 cross-sectional, and 1 RCT studies) were included in the final review. All of the included studies indicated that adherence to the MIND diet was positively associated with specific domains, but not all, of cognition and global cognitive function (78% of the studies) in older adults. MIND diet was superior to other plant-rich diets including Mediterranean, Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension, Pro-Vegetarian and Baltic Sea diets, for improving cognition. Adherence to the MIND diet may possibly be associated with an improved cognitive function in older adults. MIND diet may be superior to other plant-rich diets for improving cognition.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Dietary quality indices (DQI) are widely used in nutritional epidemiology. However, how they might change over time in a Mediterranean population is not well understood. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate within-participant longitudinal changes in scores for nine a priori-defined DQIs: Fat Quality Index (FQI), Carbohydrate Quality Index (CQI), Pro-vegetarian Dietary Pattern (PVG), Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS), Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS), Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH), Mediterranean-DASH Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay Diet (MIND), Prime Diet Quality Score (PDQS) and Alternate Healthy Eating Index (AHEI-2010) in the \"Seguimiento Universidad de Navarra\" (SUN) cohort, a well-known Mediterranean cohort of university graduates, and to identify baseline predictors of improvement in MEDAS and AHEI-2010 after 10 years of follow-up. DESIGN: In this longitudinal cohort study, DQI scores were calculated based on responses from a validated semiquantitative food-frequency questionnaire (FFQ). PARTICIPANTS/SETTING: Spanish university graduates enrolled in the SUN cohort before March 2008, who completed the 10-year FFQ and reported total dietary intake at baseline and after 10 years of follow-up, included 2,244 men and 3,271 women, whose mean age at baseline was 36.3 years (standard deviation [SD], 10.7). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Main outcome measures were within-participant longitudinal changes for FQI, CQI, PVG, MEDAS, MDS, DASH, MIND, PDQS, and AHEI-2010. STATISTICAL ANALYSES PERFORMED: Adjusted logistic regression models were used to evaluate within-participant longitudinal changes and to identify baseline predictors of improvements ≥10% in MEDAS and AHEI-2010 scores after 10 years of follow-up. RESULTS: The comparison of the nine scores of DQI calculated at baseline and after 10 years of follow-up showed an improvement in all DQI scores except for PDQS. The greatest changes in DQIs were found for MEDAS (from 6.2 to 7.2, +22.9%) and MDS (from 4.3 to 4.4, +15.4%). The strongest predictors at baseline for ≥10% improvements in MEDAS or AHEI-2010 scores varied across indices. Being female, ≥35 years old, and more physically active at baseline were associated with improvement, whereas snacking between meals was associated with <10% improvements in both indices. CONCLUSIONS: In this cohort, the changes in nine a priori-defined DQI scores suggested modest improvements in diet quality, in which MEDAS and MDS scores showed the largest improvements. Additional longitudinal studies, especially intervention trials with long follow-up, are warranted to establish the most appropriate DQIs to assess long-term changes in diet quality in adult populations.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Asthma has become one of the major public health challenges, and recent studies show promising clinical benefits of dietary interventions, such as the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to examine whether changes in diet quality are associated with changes in inflammatory markers important in asthma pathophysiology. METHODS: In this exploratory study in patients with poorly controlled asthma participating in a randomized controlled trial of a DASH intervention study, changes in concentrations of a broad panel of serum proteins (51-plex Luminex assay, Affymetrix) were determined, and their relation to diet quality (DASH score) assessed by combining data of both intervention and usual-care control groups. Second, the relation between the serum proteins, other biomarkers of inflammation and nutrition, and Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ) was assessed. RESULTS: During the first 3 mo, diet quality (DASH scores) were inversely associated (P < 0.05, false discovery rate P < 0.09) with serum concentrations of a large number serum proteins, reflecting not only general proinflammatory markers such as IL-1β, transforming growth factor α (TGF-α), and IL-6 (r = -0.31 to -0.39) but also a number of proteins associated with asthmatic conditions, specifically several T-helper (Th) 2 (Th2; r = -0.29 to -0.34) and Th17 (r = -0.4) associated cytokines and growth factors. Monokine induced by gamma/chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 9 (CXCL9) (MIG/CXCL9), a T-cell attractant induced by IFN-γ previously linked to asthma exacerbations, appeared to be the marker most consistently associated with DASH diet quality for the entire 6-mo study period (r = -0.40 and -0.30 for 0-3 and 3-6 mo, respectively, and standardized coefficient loadings -0.13 in the partial least squares analyses). Decreases in 19 serum protein concentrations were also correlated with improved asthma control during the 6-mo study period. CONCLUSIONS: Our data in adult patients with poorly controlled asthma suggest that dietary changes, like the introduction of DASH, may have beneficial effects on reducing inflammatory status. This trial was registered at http://www.clinicaltrials.gov as NCT01725945.",

      "abstract": "Objective: To examine the response of a calorie-restricted Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension diet on indicators of cardiometabolic health in a cohort of sedentary obese older adults. Design: This was a controlled-feeding trial with a parallel design. Each participant consumed either 3 oz (85 g; n = 15) or 6 oz (170.1 g; n = 13) of lean fresh beef within a standardized calorie-restricted DASH-like diet for 12-weeks. Fasted blood samples were collected and used to measure conventional biomarkers of cardiovascular, metabolic and inflammatory health. Participants: Caucasian older (70.8 years), obese (BMI: 32 ± 6.9 kg/m2; WC: 101 ± 16.4 cm) females (n = 17) and males (n = 11) from the rural community of Brookings, South Dakota. Results: 28 participants completed the 12-week feeding trial, with no differences (p > 0.05) among the biomarkers of cardiometabolic health between the 3 and 6 oz beef intake groups. However, when the beef intake groups were combined, all biomarkers changed concentration in response to the intervention diet. Total cholesterol (p < 0.001), LDL-C (p = 0.004), HDL-C (p < 0.0001), insulin (p = 0.014), glucose (p = 0.008), HOMA-IR (p < 0.05), IL-12 (p < 0.001), and CRP (p = 0.006) all decreased in response to the study diet. IGF-1 (p < 0.001) and IL-8 (p = 0.005) increased in response to the intervention. Correlations among cardiometabolic biomarkers and body composition measures were observed. By study end, the decrease in insulin (R 2 = 0.22; P = 0.012) and HOMA-IR (R 2 = 0.22; P = 0.01) was positively correlated with the decrease in waist circumference. The increase in IGF-1 was significantly correlated with the decrease in waist circumference (R 2 = 0.21; p = 0.014). The increase in IGF-1 was significantly correlated with the increase in sit-to-stand (R 2 = 0.21; p = 0.016). The increase in IL-8 was significantly correlated with decreases in total cholesterol (R 2 = 0.24; P = 0.008), LDL-C (R 2 = 0.17; P = 0.031) and glucose (R 2 = 0.44; P = 0.0001). Conclusions: These findings suggest that a DASH-like diet with restricted calories may potentially improve biomarkers of cardiometabolic health in sedentary obese older adults. These results also point to interrelationships between body composition changes and changes in cardiometabolic biomarkers. Lastly, regardless of meat intake amount, positive impacts on cardiometabolic biomarkers were observed in this cohort of older adults with an obese phenotype."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Development of clinical risk factors linked to metabolic syndrome (MetS) in adolescence is associated with higher incidence of atherosclerotic cardiovascular events in adulthood. Given the increasing burden of obesity and MetS in African-American (AA) youth, there is a need to establish the relation of MetS with modifiable risk factors such as diet quality, because these data may enhance preventative and treatment approaches. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to assess diet quality, measured by the Alternative Healthy Eating Index 2010 (AHEI-2010) and the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) pattern score, in AA adolescents and youth (aged 12-21 y) from the NHANES, and to investigate the association of diet quality with MetS and its components. METHODS: This study is a cross-sectional analysis of NHANES data from the 2005-2016 cycles (n = 2459). Survey-weighted logistic regression models were used to assess the association of diet quality with the prevalence of MetS and individual cardiometabolic components [overweight/obesity, hypertensive blood pressure (BP), impaired fasting glucose, low HDL cholesterol, hypertriglyceridemia]. RESULTS: The mean ± SD AHEI-2010 score was 38.9 ± 9.7 and DASH pattern score was 21.8 ± 4.4, which is equivalent to 35% adherence to recommendations to achieve an optimal diet quality and 45% adherence to the DASH-style dietary pattern, respectively. Compared with those within the lowest quartile of DASH pattern score, individuals in the fourth quartile group had 0.63 (95% CI: 0.41, 0.97) times the odds of having hypertensive BP. Among individuals with complete clinical measures (n = 1007), individuals within the highest-quartile AHEI-2010 group had 0.25 (95% CI: 0.06, 0.99) times the odds of having MetS compared with those within the lowest quartile. CONCLUSIONS: Diet quality in US AA youth is low. Higher DASH pattern scores were associated with lower odds of hypertensive BP and higher AHEI-2010 scores were associated with lower odds of MetS.",
