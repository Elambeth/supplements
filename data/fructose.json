      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Excessive fructose consumption is a significant driver of metabolic disorders, including obesity, diabetes, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis primarily by promoting insulin resistance and fat accumulation. Ketohexokinase C (KHK-C), a pivotal enzyme in fructose metabolism, catalyzes the phosphorylation of fructose to fructose-1-phosphate, initiating a cascade of downstream metabolic processes. In contrast to glucose metabolism, KHK-C lacks negative feedback regulation, allowing the continuous phosphorylation of fructose, which leads to heightened levels of glucose, glycogen, and triglycerides in the bloodstream and liver. While targeting KHK-C offers a promising therapeutic avenue, no drugs have yet been approved for clinical use. Pfizer's PF-06835919 has progressed to phase II trials, demonstrating a reduction in liver fat and improved insulin sensitivity, while Eli Lilly's LY-3522348 also shows significant potential. Nonetheless, there remains a critical need for the development of novel KHK-C inhibitors that offer improved pharmacokinetics, enhanced efficacy, and superior safety profiles. METHODS: In the present study, a comprehensive computational strategy was employed to screen 460,000 compounds from the National Cancer Institute library for potential KHK-C inhibitors. Initially, pharmacophore-based virtual screening was used to identify potential hits, followed by multi-level molecular docking, binding free energy estimation, pharmacokinetic analysis, and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to further evaluate the compounds. This multi-step approach aimed to identify compounds with strong binding affinity, favorable pharmacokinetic profiles, and high potential for efficacy as KHK-C inhibitors. RESULTS: Ten compounds exhibited docking scores ranging from -7.79 to -9.10 kcal/mol, surpassing those of the compounds currently undergoing clinical trials, PF-06835919 (-7.768 kcal/mol) and LY-3522348 (-6.54 kcal/mol). Their calculated binding free energies ranged from -57.06 to -70.69 kcal/mol, further demonstrating their superiority over PF-06835919 (-56.71 kcal/mol) and LY-3522348 (-45.15 kcal/mol). ADMET profiling refined the selection to five compounds (1, 2, and 4-6), and molecular dynamics simulations identified compound 2 as the most stable and promising candidate compared to the clinical candidate PF-06835919. CONCLUSION: These findings highlight compound 2 as a potent KHK-C inhibitor with predicted pharmacokinetics and toxicity profiles supporting its potential for treating fructose-driven metabolic disorders, warranting further validation."

      "abstract": "Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a cluster of metabolic abnormalities that include insulin resistance, impaired glucose tolerance, dyslipidemia, hypertension, and abdominal obesity. Coffee production generates large quantities of waste products, which pose a serious threat to the environment. However, coffee by-products, such as coffee pulp (CP), possess an undeniable wealth of bioactive components. Based on this, we investigated whether a 10-week dietary intervention with 250 mg/kg/d of CP could prevent or ameliorate MetS in high-fructose-fed rats. Consumption of CP by rats fed a high-fructose diet reduced body weight gain, lowered systolic blood pressure (SBP), fasting plasma glucose and insulin levels, and improved insulin resistance compared to rats fed a high-fructose diet alone. At the hepatic level, CP attenuated the increase in lipid storage, reduced lipid peroxidation, and improved glutathione levels when combined with a high-fructose diet. CP also affected the expression of key genes related to glucose and lipid metabolism in hepatic and adipose tissues, in rats fed a fructose-rich diet. This study demonstrates that CP ameliorates several consequences of high-fructose-induced MetS in the rat (weight gain, hypertension, glucose intolerance, insulin resistance, changes in liver, and adipose tissue function). Hence, our data provide evidence that CP consumption in the context of a high-fructose diet can be used to improve MetS management."

      "abstract": "Carnosine, as a meat constituent, was previously shown to exhibit some pro-oxidative effects during in vitro digestion of a burger meal model in the presence of high (supplemental) level of ascorbic acid (AA). In the current study, effects of dietary carnosine were assessed during in vitro digestion of a burger meal combo model, including intrinsic (low, LCar) and enriched (intermediate, MCar; high, HCar) carnosine in ground pork, with or without dietary levels of AA and/or fructose in simulated beverages. Increased levels of dietary carnosine (MCar and HCar) showed antioxidant activity, irrespective of the digestion phase and the presence of fructose and/or AA. At a dietary level, AA generally acted as an antioxidant, but promoted the formation of glyoxal (GO) in gastric digests and malondialdehyde (MDA) and hexanal in duodenal digests. Fructose generally showed a pro-oxidant effect, but decreased MDA and GO concentrations in both digestion phases. Despite a higher bio-accessible carnosine level measured in HCar, which potentially represents additional health benefits post absorption, MCar treatment provided optimal antioxidant activity during digestion without further effects obtained at the HCar level, showing a ceiling-like effect of dietary carnosine benefits in the digestive environment in vitro. These results demonstrate potential health advantages of increased carnosine in meat during digestion of a meal despite the presence of other redox-active dietary compounds and suggest a potential hormetic effect of carnosine can occur during digestion. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: Carnosine, a multifunctional compound naturally present in meat, can bring considerable advantages to meat consumers. Increased dietary levels of carnosine in meat reduced oxidation and the formation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) during the digestion of a burger meal in the presence of dietary levels of either ascorbic acid (AA) (as an antioxidant) or fructose (as a pro-oxidant). In the context of this study, optimal benefits of carnosine were attained at the intermediate enhancement level, which can be naturally obtained through breeding and nutrition.",

      "abstract": "Osteoporosis is classified as a metabolic syndrome, and the consumption of fructose has been linked to various metabolic diseases. However, the specific effects and underlying mechanisms of fructose on bone health remain inadequately understood. In this study, we demonstrate that fructose intake can exacerbate bone loss in murine models by facilitating the accumulation of cholesterol within the bones. We identify Thyroid Hormone Receptor Beta (Thrb) and Protein Kinase C Zeta (Prkcz) as potential therapeutic targets for the treatment of osteoporosis. Mice subjected to a high-fructose diet exhibited a reduction in bone density and a decrease in the osteogenic differentiation of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) compared to those on a standard diet. Fructose treatment was found to decrease Thrb expression while increasing Prkcz expression, leading to cholesterol accumulation and hindering the osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs. Furthermore, our findings indicate that the activation of Thrb and the inhibition of Prkcz significantly ameliorate bone loss in mice. This study elucidates the molecular mechanisms by which fructose influences osteogenesis through the Thrb/Prkcz/cholesterol accumulation pathway in the context of osteoporosis, thereby highlighting the therapeutic potential of Thrb and Prkcz as targets for osteoporosis treatment."

However, the precise mechanisms underlying these effects are still not well understood. The leptin receptor (LepR) plays a crucial role in modulating neuronal signaling pathways that control food intake and energy expenditure, integrating peripheral metabolic signals to maintain physiological balance. This study aimed to investigate the potential impact of fructose metabolism in central nervous system on energy metabolism and glucose homeostasis. To this end, we generated a leptin receptor cell-specific Khk knockout mouse model (LepR-Cre;Khkfl/fl, KhkΔLepR) and assessed body weight and blood glucose under normal chow conditions. Fructose preference was evaluated using a two-bottle drinking test. Following prolonged fructose consumption, energy metabolism and fructose metabolism were monitored. Our results showed no significant changes in body weight, blood glucose, or fructose preference in KhkΔLepR mice under normal chow conditions. Moreover, after long-term fructose drinking intervention, there were no notable differences in energy expenditure or fructose metabolism. Taken together, these findings suggest that KHK-mediated fructose metabolism in leptin receptor-expressing neurons is not essential for fructose preference or energy homeostasis in mice.",

Brassinosteroids (BRs) are a class of hormones with important regulatory functions in plant responses to low temperature. S-nitrosylation of proteins is a key pathway for nitric oxide-mediated regulation of plant stress. In this study, we investigated whether S-nitrosylation proteins are involved in regulating energy metabolism in mini Chinese cabbage seedlings at low temperature. Low temperature inhibited the transcriptional accumulation of BrFBA2, BrGAPDH, BrPGK, and BrPK. However, applying exogenous BR and S-nitrosoglutathione significantly upregulated the transcription of these genes and accelerated the release of ATP. Exogenous BR significantly upregulated the S-nitrosylation level of fructose-1,6-bisphosphate aldolase 2 (FBA2) at low temperatures. FBA2 protein S-nitrosylation modification occurred in vitro at Cys-197. OE-BrFBA2 lines showed enhanced S-nitrosylation at low temperatures. Applying exogenous BR enhanced the S-nitrosylation of FBA2 and accelerated ATP release in TRV2-BrFBA2 lines. Exogenous BR treatment was conducive to maintaining the homeostasis of cell energy metabolism in mini Chinese cabbage seedlings at low temperature."

      "abstract": "Acute liver failure (ALF) is an uncommon but severe condition with high morbidity and mortality. Advances in supportive care have improved patient outcomes, but liver transplantation remains the only life-saving intervention in many cases. Unfortunately, healthy donor livers are in short supply. In addition, transplant recipients face several potentially fatal risks including organ rejection, biliary and vascular complications, and infection. It is therefore critical to accurately identify patients who need a new liver while sparing those who do not. This also needs to be done quickly, within the first few days of hospital admission, due to the rapid progression of ALF. Prognostic tools, like the Clichy criteria, the King's College Criteria (KCC), the model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score, the Acute Liver Failure Study Group Prognostic Index (ALFSGPI), and others have been available for this purpose since at least the 1980s and are commonly used today, but their performance is imperfect, leading to many efforts over the last several decades - and especially in recent years - to identify new noninvasive biomarkers. This review begins with a description of the earliest liver function (e.g. the levulose [fructose] test) and liver injury (e.g. alkaline phosphatase [ALP] and alanine aminotransferase [ALT]) tests and continues through the most recent proposed biomarkers, with critical evaluation of the prognostic utility of each using the KCC and MELD as benchmarks for comparison. Overall, there is as-yet no single biomarker that clearly and consistently performs better than the latter tools, though many may modestly improve the performance of the KCC or MELD when used in combination with them. The search for a better, single biomarker is therefore likely to continue."

      "abstract": "Obesity remains a major epidemic in developed countries, with a limited range of effective pharmacological treatments. The pharmacological modulation of PPARα, CB1, or GLP-1 receptor activity has demonstrated beneficial effects, including anti-obesity actions. In this study, we evaluated a novel amide derivative of oleic acid and tyrosol (Oleyl hydroxytyrosol ether, OLHHA), a PPARα agonist, and CB1 antagonist, in combination with the GLP-1 agonist liraglutide (LIG), as an effective multitarget therapy to improve both the peripheral and central alterations in an animal model of diet-induced obesity. In rats, exposure to a high-fat high-fructose diet (HFHFD) induced weight gain and increased plasma triglycerides, LDL, and hepatic parameters. In the brain, the HFHFD provoked disruptions in the expression of proteins regulating food intake, the endocannabinoid system, the insulin pathway, and inflammation and resulted in altered tau expression and phosphorylation, thus indicating neurodegenerative changes. Based on our results, the administration of LIG or OLHHA alone was insufficient to completely reverse the alterations noticed at the peripheral and central levels. On the other hand, the combined treatment with both compounds (OLHHA+LIG) was the most effective in promoting body weight loss and ameliorating both the central and peripheral alterations induced by HFHFDs in rats. This multitarget therapeutic approach could represent a promising strategy for treating obesity and associated comorbidities.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Few studies have evaluated changes in leukocyte telomere length (LTL) over a short time period (e.g. 1 week). LTL shortening is accelerated by exposure to inflammation and reactive oxygen species (ROS) damage. METHODS: In the context of an isocaloric fructose restriction study that was conducted with 43 Black and Latinx children over a 9-day period, we evaluated the relationship between metabolic health at baseline and metabolic changes and LTL at baseline and %LTL change over the follow-up period. Linear regression models were used to assess associations between metabolic correlates and LTL at baseline and LTL changes over 9 days. RESULTS: Overall children lost - 0.05 ± 0.14 T/S units or - 2.98 ± 8.74% total change over the follow-up period. Higher concentrations of HDL-C, APO-AI and a greater % of large HDL-C at baseline were associated with reduced LTL attrition rates at day 10 (p < 0.01; p < 0.01 and p = 0.02 respectively). Increases in APO-AI over the follow-up period were associated with increased LTL attrition over the follow-up period (p = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: In this short term isocaloric fructose restriction study, LTL at baseline and changes in LTL over 9 days were associated with HDL-C and APO-AI and not with any other non-HDL-C lipids. Additional, larger studies are necessary to better understand the interplay between short term fructose restriction, LTL changes and HDL-C/APO-AI."

Here we report that mannose, a simple sugar, attenuates MASH steatosis and fibrosis in 2 robust murine models and human liver slices. METHODS: The well-validated fat-and-tumor MASH murine model for liver steatosis and fibrosis was employed. Mannose was supplied in the drinking water at the start (\"Prevention\" group) or at week 6 of the 12-week MASH regimen (\"Therapy\" group). The in vivo antifibrotic effects of mannose supplementation were tested in a second model of carbon tetrachloride (CCl4)-induced liver fibrosis. A quantitative and automated digital pathology approach was used to comprehensively assess steatosis and fibrosis phenotypes. Mannose was also tested in vitro in human and primary mouse hepatocytes conditioned with free fatty acids alone or with fructose, and human precision-cut liver slices from patients with end-stage MASH cirrhosis. RESULTS: Oral mannose supplementation improved liver fibrosis in vivo in both fat-and-tumor MASH and CCl4 mouse models, as well as in human precision-cut liver slice MASH samples. Mannose also reduced liver steatosis in fat-and-tumor MASH mice, and in human and mouse hepatocytes in vitro. Ketohexokinase, the main enzyme in fructolysis, was decreased with mannose in whole mouse liver, cultured hepatocytes, and human precision-cut liver slices. Removal of fructose or overexpression of ketohexokinase each abrogated the antisteatotic effects of mannose. CONCLUSIONS: This study identifies mannose as a novel therapeutic candidate for MASH that mitigates steatosis by dampening hepatocyte ketohexokinase expression and exerts independent antifibrotic effects in 2 mouse models and human liver tissue slices.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Excessive fructose intake can impact pregnancy health. Additionally, Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is associated with both elevated fructose levels and adverse pregnancy outcomes. Therefore, it is significant to investigate whether serum fructose levels influence pregnancy outcomes in patients with or without PCOS. METHODS: This case-control study included 270 participants (PCOS, n = 135; non-PCOS, n = 135). The serum fructose levels of consecutively treated women undergoing in vitro fertilization - embryo transfer treatment at the Center of reproductive medicine in Shengjing hospital of China Medical University, from June 2020 to June 2021, were measured. Pregnancies were monitored until the ultimate outcome was determined. The antenatal, delivery, and neonatal outcomes were extracted from hospital records. RESULTS: In patients with PCOS, those who experienced miscarriage had significantly higher serum fructose levels (P = 0.011). The incidence of miscarriage increased as the serum fructose quartiles increased in patients with PCOS (P = 0.010). There was a significant correlation between serum fructose levels and miscarriage (r = 0.258, P = 0.002). The results of multivariate logistic regression analysis remain consistent (odd ratio [OR] = 10.138, P = 0.005). Conversely, in women without PCOS, those who prematurely delivered had significantly higher serum fructose levels (P = 0.001). The incidence of preterm delivery increased as the serum fructose quartiles increased in patients without PCOS (P < 0.001). There was a significant correlation between serum fructose levels and preterm delivery (r = 0.311, P < 0.001) in non-PCOS group. The multivariate logistic regression analysis indicated the identical results (OR = 18.359, P = 0.008). The area under the curve for fructose-mediated prediction of miscarriage in PCOS was 0.686, while for prediction of preterm birth in non-PCOS individuals, the area under the curve was 0.731. CONCLUSIONS: Serum fructose levels are positively associated with miscarriage risk in patients with PCOS. Within the non-PCOS cohort, fructose levels are linked to preterm birth. Further investigation is warranted to comprehensively elucidate the underlying mechanisms, thus enhancing our profound understanding.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND/AIM: Peripheral nerve injuries (PNIs) are debilitating disorders affecting predominantly the younger generation, often leading to significant disabilities. Current treatment strategies are inadequate for addressing the complex nature of these injuries. Peripheral nerve healing and functional recovery are crucial components of both pathophysiology and therapeutic approaches. High fructose corn syrup (HFCS) is a sweetener frequently used in several beverages and foods. It is associated with several metabolic disturbances including insulin resistance and may impair nerve healing. This study investigated the therapeutic role of ivermectin on nerve regeneration following sciatic nerve injury and evaluated motor and sensorial functions together with histopathological evaluation. Additionally, we aimed to compare nerve healing between animals that consume HFCS and those that do not. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-eight male Swiss albino mice were randomly divided into six groups, with three consuming HFCS-42 (11% v/v) and the other three regular tap water for 8 weeks. On day 28, sciatic nerve injury (SNI) was caused in all groups. Ivermectin (1 mg/kg) or gabapentin (30 mg/kg) treatments were administered to selected groups. Body weight, blood glucose, motor function (rotarod, open field test), and thermal-mechanical sensorial functions were assessed weekly. Finally, insulin levels were measured and histopathological samples were taken. RESULTS: Eight weeks of HFCS consumption impaired mechanical and thermal sensory functions and resulted in histopathologically poor nerve repair. Ivermectin resulted in improved sensorial and faster motor function recovery in the HFCS groups. Elevated plasma insulin levels/HOMA-IR values were diminished by ivermectin in the HFCS groups. In the ivermectin non-HFCS group, histopathology revealed accelerated healing and higher scores in total. Ivermectin also ameliorated mechanical sensation loss after SNI along with cold sensation. CONCLUSION: Ivermectin accelerated sensorial and motor nerve recovery, resulting in faster nerve healing alongside improved insulin resistance, suggesting it might serve as a potential foundation for developing a new treatment for nerve regeneration after injury.",

      "abstract": "Fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase 1 (FBP1) is the enzyme that limits the process of gluconeogenesis as it facilitates the hydrolysis of fructose-1,6-bisphosphate(F-1,6-BP) to produce fructose-6-phosphate(F6P) and inorganic phosphate. Gluconeogenesis is the production of glucose from small carbohydrate substrates. The gluconeogenic process is typically suppressed in cancer because it inhibits glycolysis. Apart from its involvement in cellular glucose metabolism, FBP1 also plays a role in gene transcription, mRNA translation and stability regulation, and the immune microenvironment of tumors. Because of its multifaceted functions, the mechanisms by which FBP1 is involved in tumor development are complex. Moreover, FBP1 deficiency is associated with radiation and chemotherapy resistance and poor prognosis in cancer patients. Restoration of FBP1 expression in cancer cells is expected to hold promise for cancer therapy. However, up to now few reviews have systematically summarized the important functional mechanisms of FBP1 in tumorigenesis and the small molecule compounds that restore FBP1 expression. Therefore, this article addresses the question \"How does FBP1 contribute to cancer progression, and can targeting FBP1 be a potential therapeutic approach?\" by summarizing the effects of FBP1 on cancer development and progression as well as its mediated drug resistance and the future clinical applications of potential small molecule modulators targeting FBP1."

Male Wister rats were divided into eight groups and fed with either a standard diet (control), high fructose (HF), high fat (HFAT), or a high- fructose high- fat (HF/HFAT) diet and supplemented with RSV (30 mg/kg/day) for 4 weeks. The food intake, body weight, glycemic parameters, lipid profile, oxidative stress were assessed. SIRT1 gene expression, PGC-1α, cyto-c and GLUT-4 were evaluated by qRT-PCR in adipose tissue of normal and obese rats. The body weight gain, serum fasting glucose, insulin, and HOMA-IR values were significantly higher in the HF and HF/HFAT groups than in the HFAT and control groups. Hyperlipidemia was observed in high calorie diets fed rats compared to control group. The levels of total cholesterol, triglycerides and LDL-c were significantly elevated while HDL- c was significantly decreased in HF & HF/HFAT groups compared to HFAT group. The levels of serum malondialdhyde (MDA) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity in adipose tissue were elevated in all groups compared to control group, particularly in the groups that were kept on a high fructose diets (HF, HF/HFAT). SIRT-1, PGC-1α, Cyto-c, and GLUT-4 genes levels were significantly down regulated in HF, HFAT & HF/HFAT groups compared to control group. Supplementation of T-RSV restored the alteration in carbohydrates-lipid metabolism as well as oxidative stress and upregulation of SIRT-1, PGC-1α, Cyto-c, and GLUT-4 genes. RSV is a promising treatment in the management of pathologic consequences of obesity from high-calorie diet consumption via molecular alteration of target genes.",

However, their high sugar content, such as fructose, hinders their application in hypoglycemic functional foods. This research utilized microbial fermentation technology to remove the fructose and glucose in mulberries (FM), subsequently evaluating their hypoglycemic properties and balancing gut microbiota. Results indicated that administering varying doses of FM to type 2 diabetic mice for five weeks notably decreased blood sugar and insulin levels, improved dyslipidemia and insulin resistance, enhanced antioxidant capacity, repaired organ damage, and regulated hypoglycemic activity by influencing mRNA expression of key signaling factors in the PI3K/Akt and AMPK pathways. Analysis of the intestinal microbiota composition revealed that FM can modulate specific bacterial populations, increasing beneficial bacteria like Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium and Akkermansia while inhibiting harmful bacteria like Escherichia-Shigella and Helicobacter. This restoration of the intestinal microecological balance helped regulate host sugar metabolism homeostasis and affect the secretion of short chain fatty acid (SCFA) synthase in the gut microbiota to increase the production of SCFAs. These findings offer significant support for the potential use of FM in the treatment of diabetes.",

      "abstract": "Studies have substantiated that dietary-fat- and fructose-overconsumption-caused lipid metabolism disorders can trigger renal lipotoxicity to drive the progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD). This study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of morroniside, a natural active substance extracted from the fruit of Cornus officinalis, in inhibiting the progression of CKD in high-fat and high-fructose-fed mice. Our results showed histological changes such as fatty degeneration of renal tubular cells, tubular dilatation, glomerular fibrosis, and abnormal renal function in the kidneys of high-fat- and high-fructose-fed mice, which was significantly improved after morroniside treatment. Mechanistically, morroniside maintained renal lipid metabolism homeostasis and inhibited NLRP3 inflammatory vesicle activation by activating AMPKα to promote TFEB nuclear translocation-mediated lipophagy. Consistent results were observed in palmitic acid-induced HK-2 cells. Notably, silencing AMPKα or TFEB both reversed the effects of morroniside in promoting lipophagy and inhibiting the activation of inflammatory responses in vivo and in vitro. Therefore, our study provides compelling evidence that morroniside delays CKD progression by promoting AMPK/TFEB-mediated lipophagy and inhibiting NLRP3 inflammasome activation, suggesting that dietary supplementation with morroniside and morroniside-rich foods (such as Cornus officinalis) might be an effective strategy for the prevention of CKD.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Fructose (Fru) consumption has been suggested to contribute to metabolic diseases including metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), at least in part, by disturbing intestinal barrier function and intestinal nitric oxide (NO) homeostasis. Honokiol (Hon), a neolignan found in Magnolia officinalis, has been suggested to affect intestinal integrity and barrier function. OBJECTIVES: We assessed whether Hon affects Fru-induced small intestinal permeability in settings of early MASLD. METHODS: Female 8-10-wk-old C57BL/6J mice (n = 7/group) received either a 30% Fru solution + vehicle or plain drinking water + vehicle ± Hon (10 mg/kg bw/d) for 4 wk. Liver damage [e.g. nonalcoholic fatty liver disease activity score (NAS), number of neutrophils, interleukin-6 (IL-6) protein concentration], markers of intestinal permeability (bacterial endotoxin, tight junction proteins), and NO homeostasis in the small intestine were determined in vivo as well as ex vivo in an everted sac model and in Caco-2 cells. One-way and 2-way analysis of variance were performed, respectively. RESULTS: Hon diminished the development of MASLD, which was associated with a significant lower NAS (-38%), number of neutrophils (-48%), and IL-6 protein concentrations (-38%) in livers of Fru-fed mice. Hon also attenuated Fru-induced alterations of markers of intestinal barrier function with Fru+Hon-fed mice showing lower bacterial toxin levels in portal plasma (-29%, P = 0.075), higher tight junction protein concentrations (+2.4-fold, P < 0.05), and lower NOx concentration (-44%, P < 0.05) as well as NO synthase activity (-35%) in the small intestine compared with Fru+vehicle-fed mice. Moreover, the decrease in AMP-activated protein kinase phosphorylation found in the small intestine of Fru-fed mice was significantly attenuated (+5.3-fold) by the concomitant treatment with Hon in Fru-fed mice. In support of the in vivo findings, Hon significantly attenuated Fru-induced intestinal permeability ex vivo and in Caco-2 cells. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that Hon diminished the development of Fru-induced early MASLD by alleviating impairments in intestinal barrier function.",

      "abstract": "The excessive accumulation of lipid droplets within hepatocytes stands as a hallmark characteristic of metabolic-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD). Selenium (Se) nanoparticles (NPs) have garnered considerable attention for their notable bioavailability, minimal toxicity, and exceptional antioxidant properties. However, a critical limitation lies in the propensity of SeNPs to aggregate into the biologically inactive elemental Se, thereby constraining their utility. Here, we utilized Stevioside (SV), a natural sweetener, to modify SeNPs and obtained the SV-SeNPs with a size of about 187 ± 7 nm. We aimed to investigate the effect of SV-SeNPs on high fructose-palmitate (HFP) induced lipid accumulation in HepG2 cells. Noteworthy is the absence of overt cytotoxicity attributed to SV-SeNPs on normal HepG2 cells. Of significance, our findings delineate the profound inhibitory effects of SV-SeNPs on the expression of key genes implicated in de novo lipogenesis, such as fatty-acid synthase (FASN), acetyl-CoA-carboxylase 1 (ACC1), and stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 (SCD1) within HFP-induced HepG2 cells. Furthermore, our investigation reveals that SV-SeNPs mediate a significant reduction in lipid accumulation by activating the PI3K/AKT/Nrf2 signaling cascades. Additionally, the antioxidative properties of SV-SeNPs are underscored by their ability to counteract oxidative stress via the upregulation of two pivotal antioxidant enzymes, superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GSHPx). In conclusion, our study unveils the potential beneficial effects of SV-SeNPs on the prevention and treatment of MAFLD by effectively suppressing lipid accumulation and ameliorating oxidative stress.",

This study aimed to identify microRNA profiles and RNA regulatory networks for NAFLD intervention. Mice were fed a high-fructose diet (HFrD) to induce NAFLD. Small RNA-seq and mRNA-seq were used to analyze liver microRNA and mRNA profiles of HFrD-fed versus normal chow-fed (Chow) mice. The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and miRNAs (DE-miRNAs) were identified, followed by enrichment analysis. A protein‒protein interaction network of overlapping DEGs and DE-miRNA targets was constructed, along with a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) network. Mendelian randomization (MR) was performed to verify the causal relationship between top DEGs and NAFLD. The study identified 13 DE-miRNAs and 854 DEGs in the liver between HFrD mice and Chow mice. A Venn diagram revealed that 58 of the predicted target genes of the 13 DE-miRNAs were shared with the DEGs. Finally, 6 DE-miRNAs, 34 DEGs, and 20 predicted lncRNAs were selected to construct the ceRNA regulatory network. The upregulated DEG Clec4e, a target gene of miR-22-5p, was significantly correlated with the risk of NAFLD (OR: 1.41, 95 % CI: 1.04-1.92, P = 0.029) in the MR analysis, and RT-qPCR was applied to validate Clec4e expression in the livers of HFrD mice. Further, the dual-luciferase reporter assay confirmed that miR-22-5p could directly inhibit Clec4e expression by targeting its 3'-UTR. This study identified several novel miRNAs and genes as potential biomarkers of NAFLD. In particular, the miR-22-5p/Clec4e axis is a potential diagnostic target for NAFLD.",

      "abstract": "Metabolic syndrome (MetS) can contribute to a chronic ischemia-relative overactive bladder (OAB). Using fructose-fed rats (FFRs), a rat model of MetS, we investigated the effects of tadalafil (a phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor) on MetS-associated chronic bladder ischemia and bladder overactivity. Phenotypes of the OAB, including increased micturition frequency and a shortened intercontractile interval in cystometry, were observed in FFRs, together with reduced bladder blood perfusion (in empty bladders) via laser color Doppler imaging and elevated serum nitrite levels, suggesting chronic ischemia-related bladder dysfunction. Treatment with tadalafil (2 mg/kg) promoted pelvic angiogenesis, as shown by magnetic resonance imaging, and increased VEGF and p-eNOS overexpression in the bladder. This treatment restored bladder perfusion and alleviated bladder overactivity without significantly altering most MetS parameters. At the molecular level, FFRs exhibited increased ischemia markers (NGF, HIF-2α, and AMPK-α2) and decreased p-AMPK-α2, along with elevated proinflammatory mediators (ICAM-1, nuclear NF-κB, COX-2, IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α), enhanced mitochondria biogenesis (PGC-1α, TFAM, and mitochondria DNA copy number), oxidative stress (decreased nuclear NRF2, increase MnSOD and 8-OHdG staining), and tissue fibrosis (increased TGF-β1, collagen I, and fibronectin). Tadalafil treatment improved these effects. Together, these findings suggest that tadalafil may promote VEGF-associated angiogenesis, enhance p-eNOS staining in the bladder vasculature, normalize bladder perfusion in microcirculation, and reduce serum nitrite levels. Consequently, tadalafil mitigates the adverse effects of chronic ischemia/hypoxia, improving bladder overactivity. We elucidated the mechanisms underlying the tadalafil-mediated amelioration of MetS-associated OAB symptoms.",

      "abstract": "Metabolic syndrome (MetS) represents a worldwide health problem, affecting cardiovascular and mental health. People with MetS are often suffering from depression. We used hereditary hypertriacylglycerolemic (HTG) rats as an animal model of MetS, and these were fed a high-fat-high-fructose diet (HFFD) to imitate unhealthy eating habits of people having several MetS risk factors and suffering depression. Male HTG rats were fed a standard diet (HTG-SD) or HFFD for eight weeks (HFFD8). Venlafaxine was administered for the last three weeks of the experiment (HFFD8+VE). Heart function was observed on the level of intact organisms (standard ECG in vivo), isolated hearts (perfusion according to Langendorff ex vivo), and molecular level, using the RT-PCR technique. The function of the isolated perfused heart was monitored under baseline and ischemia/reperfusion conditions. Analysis of ECG showed electrical abnormalities in vivo, such as significant QRS complex prolongation and increased heart rate. Ex vivo venlafaxine significantly reduced QT interval after ischemia/reperfusion injury. Baseline values of contractile abilities of the heart tended to be suppressed by HFFD. A significant reduction of LVDP was present in the HFFD8 group. Molecular analysis of specific genes involved in cardiac electrical (Cacna1c, Scn5a), contractile (Myh6, Myh7), metabolic function (Pgc1alpha) and calcium handling (Serca2a, Ryr2) supported some of the functional findings in vivo and ex vivo. Based on the present effect of venlafaxine on heart function, further research is needed regarding its cardiometabolic safety in the treatment of patients with MetS suffering from depression.

METHODS: The expression and effect of FBP1 expression on the prognosis of GBM patients were examined applying bioinformatics analyses. After measuring the expression of FBP1 in normal glial cell line HEB and GBM cells, cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8), 5-ethynyl-2-deoxyuridine (EdU), colony formation, transwell, and wound healing assay were carried out to examine the effects of silencing FBP1 on the proliferation and invasion of GBM cells. Aerobic glycolysis was measured by calculating the extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) and oxygen consumption rate (OCR) of FBP1-silenced GBM cells. Furthermore, the protein levels of the mediators related to PI3K/AKT pathway and BCL2 protein family were detected via immunoblotting. Additionally, the effects of FBP1 silencing on the macrophage M2 polarization were assessed based on the fluorescence intensity of CD206 and the phosphorylation of STAT6 quantified by immunofluorescence and immunoblotting, respectively. RESULTS: High-expressed FBP1 was indicative of a worse prognosis of GBM. FBP1 knockdown in GBM cells suppressed the proliferation, invasion, migration, and aerobic glycolysis of GBM cells, lowered the phosphorylation levels of AKT and PI3K and the protein expression of BCL2 but promoted BAX protein expression. Moreover, FBP1 knockdown reduced CD206 fluorescence intensity and the phosphorylation of STAT6. CONCLUSION: To conclude, FBP1 could be considered as a biomarker that affected the malignant phenotypes and aerobic glycolysis in GBM, contributing to the diagnosis and treatment of GBM.",

Ketohexokinase C (KHK-C), a key enzyme in fructose metabolism, is a promising therapeutic target. α-Mangostin, a naturally occurring prenylated xanthone, has been identified as an effective KHK-C inhibitor, prompting exploration of its analogs for enhanced efficacy. This study aimed to identify α-Mangostin analogs with improved inhibitory properties against KHK-C to address these disorders. Methods: A library of 1383 analogs was compiled from chemical databases and the literature. Molecular docking, binding free energy calculations, pharmacokinetic assessments, molecular dynamics simulations, and quantum mechani-cal analyses were used to screen and evaluate the compounds. α-Mangostin's binding affinity (37.34 kcal/mol) served as the benchmark. Results: Sixteen analogs demonstrated binding affinities superior to α-Mangostin (from -45.51 to -61.3 kcal/mol), LY-3522348 (-45.36 kcal/mol), and reported marine-derived inhibitors (from -22.74 to -51.83 kcal/mol). Hits 7, 8, 9, 13, and 15 not only surpassed these benchmarks in binding affinity, but also exhibited superior pharmacokinetic properties compared to α-Mangostin, LY-3522348, and marine-derived inhibitors, indicating strong in vivo potential. Among these, hit 8 emerged as the best performer, achieving a binding free energy of -61.30 kcal/mol, 100% predicted oral absorption, enhanced metabolic stability, and stable molecular dynamics. Conclusions: Hit 8 emerged as the most promising candidate due to its superior binding affinity, favorable pharmacokinetics, and stable interactions with KHK-C. These findings highlight its potential for treating fructose-driven metabolic disorders, warranting further experimental validation."

      "abstract": "Background and Objectives: High fructose intake is associated with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), a chronic liver disease that is on the rise worldwide. New alternatives for treatment, such as bioactive phytochemicals, are needed. The aim of this study was to investigate the beneficial role of resveratrol in treating non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Materials and Methods: Sixty male albino rats were allocated to three groups: group I, the normal control group; group II, the fructose-enriched diet group (FED), which was fed a 70% fructose diet for six weeks to induce NASH; and group III, the resveratrol-FED group (RES + FED), which was given the same FED diet plus an oral dose of 70 mg/kg resveratrol (RES) every day for an additional six weeks. We performed histological evaluations and assessed blood lipids and liver enzymes to study resveratrol's impact on NASH. Quantitative real-time PCR was used to assess the mRNA expression of nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) in the liver samples. ELISA was used to measure Beclin 1, AMPK, IL-6, and the DNA-binding activity of Nrf2. Oxidative stress indicators, including GSH, SOD, and MDA, were evaluated spectrophotometrically. Results: Resveratrol effectively alleviated the biochemical and histopathological abnormalities associated with NASH, improving autophagy by raising Beclin 1 levels while reducing inflammation by decreasing IL-6 levels. Furthermore, resveratrol restored the liver architecture and the oxidative balance, as evidenced by the decreased MDA levels and improved antioxidant status via elevated GSH and SOD activities, as well as the activation of the AMPK/Nrf2 signaling axis. Conclusions: This study specifically examines resveratrol's therapeutic effects in a high-fructose diet-induced NASH model, focusing on the AMPK/Nrf2 signaling pathway to address oxidative stress and autophagy, providing novel insights into its molecular mechanism of action. Resveratrol reduces NASH by boosting autophagy and activating the AMPK/Nrf2 pathway. These findings underscore the potential of resveratrol as a promising therapeutic agent that can support treatment alongside conventional medications in the management of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH).",

      "abstract": "Diabetes Mellitus (DM), one of the oldest known metabolic disorders, dates back to 3000 BC and continues to have a profound impact on health and the economy. Nutrition plays a critical role in managing diabetes and enhancing overall quality of life. It is also vital for immune system function, as well as in the prevention and treatment of aging-related diseases. A key factor contributing to the global rise in obesity is the excessive consumption of fructose/glucose (corn) syrup, which leads to various metabolic complications. Uncontrolled intake of carbohydrates, particularly sugars like fructose, triggers the Maillard Reaction, a chemical process that occurs between sugars and proteins, resulting in advanced glycation end-products (AGEs). This process is accelerated in diabetic patients due to hyperglycemia, leading to increased glycation of plasma proteins such as immunoglobulins, which play an essential role in the immune system. Studies show that individuals with Diabetes Mellitus experience a higher susceptibility to infections due to increased viral entry, impaired immune responses, reduced viral clearance, and dysregulated inflammatory cytokine production. In this study, human IgG proteins were glycated in vitro using fructose, simulating the damaging effects seen in diabetic conditions. A mixture containing antioxidants like glutathione, oleuropein, and selenium was prepared and incubated with the glycated IgG to assess its protective properties. Lymphocyte cells from healthy volunteers were also treated with fructose and subjected to similar experiments. Results demonstrated that fructose significantly compromises immune function by damaging key proteins, but the antioxidant mixture effectively mitigates this damage, offering a protective mechanism against glycation in the immune system.",

Cyanidin-3-O-glucoside (C3G), a recognized food antioxidant, has shown promise in protecting in male reproduction and modulating epigenetic modifications. However, its potential role in ameliorating intergenerational inheritance induced by HFHFD remains underexplored. In this study, we investigated the effects of paternal HFHFD on reproductive injury of offspring and the protective effect of C3G. Paternal mice were subjected to 12 weeks of HFHFD induction and C3G treatment was conducted for 8 weeks. Offspring obtained via in vitro fertilization were fed either a normal diet (ND) or high-fat diet (HFD). Our findings indicate that while the paternal HFHFD did not result in observable reproductive impairments in paternal mice, it did affect offspring testicular function through intergenerational inheritance, rendering them more susceptible to testicular damage and reduced sperm counts when exposed to an HFD. Notably, C3G intervention significantly mitigated these effects, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic compound for alleviating the impact of paternal intergenerational inheritance on male fertility resulting from HFHFD. These results underscore the importance of further exploring the mechanisms underlying intergenerational inheritance and the potential of interventions such as C3G in mitigating its effects, with implications for both basic research and clinical practice.",

Ferulic acid (FA) is a natural product that may inhibit fatty acids' binding to FABP3, preventing their toxicity. It is aimed to evaluate the consequences of maternal feeding on high-fat, high fructose diet (HFFD) and the role of FA on the offspring. Four-week-old female rats were fed HFFD for 9 weeks prior to and throughout gestation and lactation to develop T2D. A group of them received 50 mg/kg FA daily. Offspring were sampled on gestational day 18 (GD18), and postnatal days (PND) 3 and 30. HFFD increased offspring's blood glucose, insulin, Homa-IR, HbA1c, triglycerides, cholesterol, intrahepatic and intra-insular lipid droplets. The mechanism of islet inflammation and apoptosis, detected by Il-1b and cleaved caspase3, involved the nuclear translocation of NFκB p65. Maternal HFFD caused developmental retardations in offspring's ovaries, testes, kidney and liver. Coupling FA treatment with the maternal HFFD maintained normoglycemia, lipidemia, and healthy islets, and prevented developmental retardations. FA administration to T2D mothers revealed positive effects on the offspring that is related to its direct protective effect on pancreatic β-cells.",

      "abstract": "While fructose is a key dietary component, concerns have been raised about its potential risks to the liver. This study aimed to assess quercetin's protective effects against fructose-induced mouse hepatic steatosis. Thirty-two male C57BL/6J mice were randomly allocated into four groups: control, high fructose diet (HFrD), HFrD supplemented with low-dose quercetin (HFrD+LQ), and HFrD supplemented with high-dose quercetin (HFrD+HQ). Biochemical, pathological, immune, and metabolic parameters were assessed. Quercetin treatment significantly reduced liver fat percentages in mice on a high fructose diet, with the most notable reduction observed in the HFrD+HQ group. Histological examination confirmed this reduction, revealing diminished lipid droplets and decreased inflammation and steatosis in hepatocytes. Compared to the high fructose group, interleukin-1 β and tumor necrosis factor alpha were significantly decreased, serum aspartate aminotransferase concentrations were markedly reduced, and blood high-density lipoprotein concentrations were substantially elevated after quercetin intervention (p < 0.05). Total bilirubin and triglyceride levels, which were significantly altered following high fructose intervention and reversed after quercetin intervention. Following the administration of 100 mg/kg quercetin, the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio was significantly reduced compared to the high fructose group. At the genus level, Erysipelotrichaceae_uncultured, Faecalibaculum, Odoribacter, and Allobaculum were significantly decreased (p < 0.05), Lacnospiraceae NK4A136 group, Parabacteroides, and Alloprevotella significantly increased (p < 0.05). However, the 50 mg/kg quercetin treatment only decreased the abundance of Erysipelotrichaceae_uncultured (p < 0.05). In addition, quercetin significantly enhanced the content of propionic acid and total acid (p < 0.05). Moreover, the intestinal flora showed a significant correlation with the hepatic health-related phenotype in mice. Both 50 and 100 mg/kg quercetin treatments significantly mitigated liver fat deposition in mice with fructose-induced hepatic steatosis. However, the higher dose of quercetin (100 mg/kg) demonstrated a more pronounced effect in reducing liver inflammation, likely due to its impact on gut microbiota regulation. This suggests quercetin's potential as a therapeutic agent for fructose-related hepatic steatosis, emphasizing the importance of dose considerations."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Boron Neutron Capture Therapy (BNCT) is a novel precision radiotherapy. The key to BNCT application lies in the effective targeting and retention of the boron-10 (10B) carrier. Among the various compounds studied in clinical settings, 4-boronophenylalanine (BPA) become the most prevalent one currently. However, challenges such as inadequate solubility and restricted tumor accumulation have affected the clinical efficacy of treatment with BPA. Therefore, there is an urgent need to prepare formulations with higher tumor uptake efficiency and increased intratumoral accumulation. METHODS: polyethylene glycol 400 and BPA were added to methanol and stirred until completely dissolved. The solution was then evaporated to remove methanol, yielding a pale-yellow clear liquid of the PEG400-BPA complex. This complex was then used for in vitro and in vivo experiments, and it was evaluated for inhibition effects after BNCT irradiation in GL261 cells. RESULTS: Compared to the clinically used fructose-BPA, PEG400-BPA increased the boron uptake in tumor cells nearly twice and exhibited a better tumor-to-normal tissue ratio (T/N) in the in vivo studies. Due to the BNCT efficacy with PEG400-BPA through in vitro experiments, the PEG400-BPA group also had showed significant cell-killing effects. CONCLUSION: We discovered that PEG400 can form a complex with BPA, significantly improving its water solubility. It provides a simple, long-term stable, easily convertible, and injectable formulation method for the delivery of BPA in BNCT treatment. It also offers new insights for BPA solubilization and formulation as well as compound forms of administration of boron drugs on the delivery of boron drugs in BNCT.",

      "abstract": "Fructose, as a natural and simple sugar, is not significantly harmful to the human body when consumed in moderation and can provide energy for the body. High-fructose diets have been linked to an increased risk of a range of metabolic disorders, including hypertriglyceridemia, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus. These conditions are known to be associated with an elevated risk of developing cardiometabolic diseases. Cardiomyocytes in mammals possess the capacity to proliferate from the moment of their birth. However, this capacity diminishes over time, and cardiac growth is ultimately achieved through cardiomyocyte (CM) hypertrophy. Prior studies have demonstrated that fructose metabolism is enhanced in the heart during pathological hypertrophy [1]. The consumption of foods containing high levels of fructose has been linked to an increase in the size of cardiomyocytes, which can lead to damage to the heart. The impact of high fructose on cardiomyocytes at the point of their initial capacity for proliferation has not been previously documented. In this experiment, our purpose was to explore the impact of high fructose in cardiomyocyte proliferation. To establish an apical resection model in neonatal mice, neonatal ICR mice were randomly divided into a sham-operated group (Sham + PBS), a sham-operated combined high-fructose group (Sham + fructose), an apical resection alone group (AR + PBS) and an apical resection combined with a high-fructose group (AR + fructose). Next, echocardiography was employed to assess the cardiac function of all mice. Masson staining was carried out to analyze cardiac fibrosis. Immunostaining was performed by extracting primary rat cardiomyocytes after the high-fructose intervention to see if proliferation-related markers (Ki67, PH3, Aurora-B) changed, qRT-PCR and immunofluorescence were used to determine changes in the expression profile of Notch1 in the neonatal heart. The results suggest that high fructose could inhibit cardiomyocyte proliferation in vivo and in vitro, The possible mechanism is that high fructose levels inhibit cardiomyocyte proliferation through suppression of Notch1 signaling pathway. In conclusion, high fructose levels inhibit the proliferation of cardiomyocytes via the Notch1 signaling pathway.",

This study was conducted to investigate the antihyperglycemic and antihyperlipidemic effects of the fenugreek seed extract on fructose-induced diabetic wistar rats. Indeed, 5 groups of rats were formed; the first and second groups were composed of normal rats treated with distilled water and fenugreek seed extract, respectively. The third, fourth, and fifth groups composed of diabetic rats were administered distilled water, 500 mg/kg of fenugreek seed extract, and 25 µg/kg. bw of a standard antidiabetic drug consecutively for 28 days. The repeated ingestion of fenugreek seed generated a significant rise (p < 0.05) of food and water consumption in diabetic rats as compared to the rats treated with distilled water. Furthermore, fenugreek seed extract caused a remarkable elevation of the body weights of diabetic rats in comparison with other groups. Additionally, chronic treatment of rats with fenugreek seed extract improved fasting blood sugar, total cholesterol and triglycerides levels in diabetic rats. Fenugreek seed extract has significant anti-diabetic activity by reducing the fasting blood sugar and ameliorating the lipid parameters of diabetic rats. However, more studies are required to isolate the phytochemical constituents that possess these activities and elucidate their mechanisms of action.",

The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of 6-G on the reduction of ER stress-induced NAFLD in metabolic syndrome (MetS) rats. METHODS: Twenty-five male Sprague-Dawley rats were fed with a high-fat high-fructose (HFHF) diet for 16 weeks. The rats were treated orally with 6-G (50,100, and 200 mg/kgBW) once daily for eight weeks. At Week 16, all animals were sacrificed, and serum and liver tissue were harvested for biochemical and structural analysis. RESULTS: NAFLD liver rats were shown to have elevated protein expression of GRP78, and ER-associated apoptotic protein, such as IRE1, TRAF2, p-JNK, and p-NF-κB, which were considerably reduced by the 6-G at three doses treatment. Furthermore, a significant increase in liver apoptosis and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NAS) score were observed in the NAFLD rat liver and which were also attenuated by the 6-G treatment at three doses. 6-G treatment also reduced ALT, AST, and ALP serum levels. CONCLUSION: Considering all the findings, it is suggested that the 6-G treatment could be a potential candidate therapy in treating ER stress-induced NAFLD in rats."

      "abstract": "In recent years, the prevalence of extremely high-temperature climates has led to an increase in cases of acute heat stress (HS), which has been identified as a contributing factor to various kidney diseases. Fructose, the end product of the polyol pathway, has been linked to kidney conditions such as kidney stones, chronic kidney disease, and acute kidney injury. However, the relationship between acute HS and kidney injury caused by endogenous fructose remains unclear. The study found that acute HS triggers the production of reactive oxygen species, which in turn activate the Nrf-2 and Akr1b3 leading to an increase in endogenous fructose levels in kidney cells. It was further demonstrated that the elevated levels of endogenous fructose play a crucial role in causing damage to kidney cells. Moreover, inhibiting Nrf-2 effectively mitigated kidney damage induced by acute HS by reducing endogenous fructose levels. These findings underscore the detrimental impact of excessive fructose resulting from acute stress on kidney function, offering a novel perspective for future research on the prevention and treatment of acute HS-induced kidney injury.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: A growing body of evidence links a high-fructose diet (HFrD) to metabolic disturbances, including inflammation, dyslipidemia, insulin resistance and also endothelial dysfunction, yet its role in allergic asthma remains underexplored. Considering that obesity and hypercholesterolemia exacerbate asthma by promoting systemic inflammation, investigating interventions with dual metabolic and anti-inflammatory effects is essential. This study aimed to evaluate the potential modulatory effects of rosuvastatin in ameliorating the effects of HFrD-induced metabolic and vascular dysfunction in the context of allergic asthma. METHODS: Forty-eight Sprague-Dawley rats were assigned to eight groups, receiving either a standard or HFrD for 12 weeks. Allergic asthma was induced using an ovalbumin sensitization and challenge protocol, while controls were administered saline. Selected groups were treated with rosuvastatin throughout the entire duration of the experiment. Body weight, abdominal circumference and serum biomarkers were assessed at baseline, 6 and 12 weeks. Endothelial function was assessed by evaluating vascular reactivity in an isolated organ bath. Additionally, histopathological analyses of aortic and pulmonary tissues were conducted to investigate inflammatory responses and morphological changes. RESULTS: Rats on HFrDs exhibited significant increases in body weight, abdominal circumference, lipid profiles and blood glucose, which were further aggravated by allergic asthma. Rosuvastatin treatment notably reduced lipid levels, C-reactive protein and immunoglobulin E, while also enhancing vascular reactivity and attenuating aortic and bronchial wall thickening. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that rosuvastatin may serve as an effective therapeutic agent for addressing vascular and inflammatory complications associated with a high fructose intake and allergic asthma.",

Moreover, LRE could adjust bile acid (BA) metabolism and the gut microbiota. Behavioral tests revealed that LRE prevented HFFD-induced cognitive deficits. The treatment of LRE resulted in a decreased expression of inflammation-related mRNA of TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1β in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus. Furthermore, LRE ameliorated gut microbiota disorder caused by HFFD by markedly elevating the relative abundances of Streptococcus and probiotics such as Lactococcus. Concurrently, it reduced the relative abundances of Helicobacter and Clostridium_XIVa. The levels of tauroursodeoxycholic acid, known for its neuroprotective property, and taurocholic acid, recognized as an anti-inflammatory agent, were significantly enhanced in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex due to the treatment with LRE. In a word, LRE might have the potential to alleviate HFFD-induced cognitive dysfunction by modulating intestinal microbiota and promoting the synthesis of neuroprotective BAs."

It has been suggested that these effects may include anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant, and anti-apoptotic effects. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the effects of ghrelin administered to diabetic rats on DNA repair and apoptosis mechanisms, and differences in oxidative stress (OS) and pancreatic hormone levels in the pancreas. Twenty-one rats were randomly divided into three groups: control, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and T2DM treated with ghrelin (T2DM + ghrelin). We examined PCNA and PARP-1 to evaluate the effect of ghrelin on DNA repair, caspase-3 and caspase-9 to evaluate its effect on apoptosis, and insulin and glucagon to evaluate its role in regulating glucose homeostasis by immunohistochemistry in diabetic rats. Malondialdehyde, glutathione, and protein carbonyl levels, as well as catalase, glutathione-S-transferase, and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities, were measured spectrophotometrically to detect the ghrelin effect on OS. Homeostasis model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and pancreatic insulin levels were assessed by ELISA method. Ghrelin may be a potential regulator of apoptosis as it significantly reduced the number of caspase-3 and caspase-9 immunopositive cells (p < 0.0001). In addition, ghrelin treatment reduced OS by decreasing glutathione (p < 0.001), malondialdehyde, and protein carbonyl, as well as the activity of SOD (p < 0.05) in diabetic rats. The results suggest that ghrelin is a potential apoptotic regulator and may be considered as a therapeutic agent due to its significant ability to suppress OS in T2DM.",

However, the underlying pathophysiology remains unknown. We aimed to investigate the effect of a high-fat/high-fructose (HFF) diet combined with O. viverrini infection on MASLD. Four groups each of ten male golden hamsters were established: normal controls (NC), O. viverrini-infected (OV), HFF-fed, and HFF-fed plus O. viverrini infection (HFF+OV). After four months of treatment, histopathological study indicated substantial hepatic damage in groups given the HFF diet. In particular, the HFF+OV group demonstrated marked lipid-droplet accumulation, hepatocyte ballooning, inflammatory-cell clustering, and widespread fibrosis. Biochemical tests indicated that the HFF+OV group had the highest concentrations of alanine aminotransferase and triglycerides, but cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein levels had increased in both HFF groups. Increased expression of Tgf-β1 and α-SMA, indicative of greater fibrosis, was demonstrated by picrosirius-red staining in the HFF+OV group. There was a significant increase in levels of inflammatory markers (HMGB-1, p65, and F4/80) and expression of genes related to the synthesis of fatty acids and glucose. FTIR microspectroscopy revealed distinct changes in fatty acids and proteins, associated with the more pronounced histopathology and impaired liver function in the HFF+OV group. The findings indicate that the interplay of a HFF diet and O. viverrini infection aggravates the progression of MASLD by augmenting liver damage, inflammation, fibrogenesis, and metabolic dysfunction. This study highlights the significance of incorporating both nutritional and infection factors into the management of liver disorders, especially in areas where opisthorchiasis is common.",

Our findings demonstrated that LVP supplementation significantly ameliorated hyperlipoidemia and hyperglycemia, insulin resistance and hepatic inflammation. Additionally, LVP alleviated hepatic steatosis and histological lesions, as well as hepatic function dysbiosis. The underlying mechanism may involve the regulation of hepatic insulin signaling transduction pathway such as IRS1/AKT pathway and the suppression of MAPKs signaling pathway. Furthermore, LVP intervention improved intestinal barrier function and reduced intestinal permeability by enhancing the expression of tight junction proteins and restoring intestinal microbiota composition. In summary, our results provided evidence that LVP exerted beneficial effects on HFFD-induced metabolic disorders along with restoration of intestinal barrier function and reduction in endotoxin levels. These outcomes are associated with maintenance of gut microbiota homeostasis and up-regulation of Short-Chain Fatty Acids (SCFAs). Furthermore, butyric acid was found to restrict lipid accumulation in OA-induced HepG2 hepatocytes while strengthening intestinal barrier integrity in LPS-induced Caco-2 cells. Thus, polysaccharides LVP may serve as a potential prebiotic or health supplement in the prevention and treatment of obesity-related metabolic disorders.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Our previous study reported that fructose intake increased systemic blood pressure and reduced nitric oxide (NO) in the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS) due to oxidative stress and neuroinflammation. However, it remains unclear how reactive oxygen species (ROS) reduce NO and how this process impacts neuroinflammation in the NTS. This study aimed at investigating the effect of ROS on acetylation of high mobility group box 1 protein (HMGB1) in the NTS of fructose-induced hypertensive rats. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Male Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats were fed with 10% fructose water to elevate blood pressure. Thereafter, CLI-095 and glycyrrhizic acid (GA) treatments were delivered for up to 2 weeks (1 mg·12 μL-1·day-1, by intracerebroventricular injection) to reduce the negative effects of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and HMGB1 activation. KEY RESULTS: Two weeks of CLI-095 and GA treatment reduced systemic blood pressure and significantly preserved neuronal and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (nNOS and eNOS) availability against the inflammatory insults of fructose consumption. Both CLI-095 and GA halted the interaction of acetylated HMGB1 and TLR4. Two weeks of CLI-095 and GA treatment markedly reduced NTS inflammation (pro-inflammatory cytokines and microglial activation) and lowered serum norepinephrine levels. CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS: Our data reveal novel pharmacological properties for CLI-095 and GA, which improved blood pressure and inflammatory conditions by decreasing the interaction of acetylated HMGB1 with TLR4. These findings challenge the commonly accepted dogma that essential hypertension is specifically mediated by neuroinflammation due to acetylated HMGB1 coupling to TLR4."

      "abstract": "Despite recent treatment advances, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remains one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths worldwide, and therefore it necessitates the exploration of new therapy options. One commonly shared feature of malignant cells is their ability to hijack metabolic pathways to confer survival or proliferation. In this study, we highlight the importance of the polyol pathway (PP) in NSCLC metabolism. This pathway is solely responsible for metabolizing glucose to fructose based on the enzymatic activity of aldose reductase (AKR1B1) and sorbitol dehydrogenase (SORD). Via genetic and pharmacological manipulations, we reveal that PP activity is indispensable for NSCLC growth and survival in vitro and in murine xenograft models. Mechanistically, PP deficiency provokes multifactorial deficits, ranging from energetic breakdown and DNA damage, that ultimately trigger the induction of apoptosis. At the molecular level, this process is driven by pro-apoptotic JNK signaling and concomitant upregulation of the transcription factors c-Jun and ATF3. Moreover, we show that fructose, the PP end-product, as well as other non-glycolytic hexoses confer survival to cancer cells and resistance against chemotherapy via sustained NF-κB activity as well as an oxidative switch in metabolism. Given the detrimental consequence of PP gene targeting on growth and survival, we propose PP pathway interference as a viable therapeutic approach against NSCLC.",

Although metformin has some functional effects on female fertility, its reproductive outcome on high fructose diet-induced metabolic syndrome is unclear. The aim of the present study is to evaluate the impact of a high fructose diet on histomorphological and molecular parameters of the reproductive organs and vaginal microbiota as well as the treatment potential of metformin. Wistar albino rats were used in the study. The metabolic syndrome model was induced by a high-fructose diet in rats for 15 weeks. Metformin was orally administered once a day for the last 6 weeks. The high-fructose diet increased blood glucose, triglycerides, insulin, and ovarian testosterone levels; however, it reduced ovarian aromatase levels and follicle numbers and caused uterine inflammation. The high-fructose diet-induced molecular abnormalities on ovarian tissue were demonstrated by the downregulation of ovarian insulin signaling pathway proteins and dysregulation of ovarian mitogenic and apoptotic pathway proteins. A high-fructose diet caused vaginal dysbiosis, metformin increased probiotic bacteria in the vaginal microbiota. Our results revealed that metformin improves ovarian impairments by modulating hormonal balance, insulin level, mapk, and apoptotic signaling molecules, as well as regulating the vaginal microbiota.",

The impact of dietary fat types on the composition and metabolic functionality of the intestinal microbiota has become a research focus over recent years. The objective of this study was to explore the effects of regular peanut oil (PO) and high-oleic-acid peanut oil (HOPO) on the composition and metabolic function of the intestinal microbiota. Methods: A dietary intervention test was conducted on SD rats fed a high-fat/high-fructose (HFF) diet. The composition and metabolic functionality of the intestinal microbiota of the experimental rats were investigated by 16S rRNA gene sequencing and fecal metabolomics. Results: Compared with saturated fat, PO and HOPO enhanced the diversity of intestinal microbiota in HFF diet-fed rats. Compared with PO, HOPO significantly increased the relative abundance of Lachnospiraceae_NK4A136_group and Harryflintia (p < 0.05), which are able to generate butyrate and acetate. Compared with saturated fat, 318 and 271 fecal biomarkers were identified in PO and HOPO groups, respectively. In contrast, 68 fecal biomarkers were identified between the PO and HOPO groups. The inhibition of harmful proteolytic fermentation in the colon may represent the main regulatory mechanism. With regard to metabolic status, HOPO provided better control of body weight and insulin sensitivity than PO. Conclusions: Compared with saturated fat, peanut oils better regulated the composition and metabolic function of the intestinal microbiota. In addition, HOPO exhibited better regulatory effects than PO.",

This study investigates the combined effects of fructose and common food preservatives (sodium benzoate, sodium nitrite, and potassium sorbate) on the development and progression of MASLD. Methods: We utilized a human microbiota-associated mouse model, administering 10% fructose with or without preservatives for 11 weeks. Liver histology, hepatic gene expression (microarray analysis), biochemical markers, cytokine profiles, intestinal permeability, and gut microbiome composition (16S rRNA and Internal Transcribed Spacer (ITS) sequencing) were evaluated. Results: Fructose and potassium sorbate synergistically induced liver pathology characterized by increased steatosis, inflammation and fibrosis. These histological changes were associated with elevated liver function markers and altered lipid profiles. The treatments also induced significant changes in both the bacterial and fungal communities and disrupted intestinal barrier function, leading to increased pro-inflammatory responses in the mesenteric lymph nodes. Liver gene expression analysis revealed a wide range of transcriptional changes induced by fructose and modulated by the preservative. Key genes involved in lipid metabolism, oxidative stress, and inflammatory responses were affected. Conclusions: Our findings highlight the complex interactions between dietary components, gut microbiota, and host metabolism in the development of MASLD. The study identifies potential risks associated with the combined consumption of fructose and preservatives, particularly potassium sorbate. Our data reveal new mechanisms that are involved in the development of MASLD and open up a new avenue for the prevention and treatment of MASLD through dietary interventions and the modulation of the microbiome.",

Notably, fructose feeding increased the DNL. Lifestyle modifications resulting from dietary changes and increased physical activity/exercise can decrease the IHL content. We examined the effects of vitamin D3 supplementation (VDS), high-intensity interval training (HIIT), and their combination on the transcription factors and enzymes of the DNL pathway in male Sprague‒Dawley rats fed a high-fructose diet (HFrD). METHODS: Forty male rats were assigned to 5 groups (n = 8): CS (the control group had a standard diet); CF (the control group had HFrD (10% (w/v) fructose solution in tap water)); and FT (HFrD + HIIT: 10 bouts of 4 min of high-intensity running, corresponding to 85-90% of the maximal speed with 2 min active rest periods of 50% maximal speed, 5 days per week); FD (HFrD + intervention of intraperitoneal injection of 10000 IU/kg/week VDS); FTD (HFrD + HIIT + VDS) that were maintained for 12 weeks. ELISA, the GOD-POD assay, folch, western blotting, and oil red O staining were used to determine insulin, fasting blood glucose (FBG), hepatic triglyceride (TG) and cholesterol levels; SREBP1c, ChREBP-β, ACC1, FASN, p-ACC1, AMPK, p-AMPK, and PKA protein expression; and IHL content, respectively. RESULTS: Both HIIT and VDS led to significant increases in the levels of PKA, AMPK, p-AMPK, and p-ACC1, as well as significant decreases in the levels of SREBP1c, ChREBP-β, ACC1, FASN, insulin, FBG, liver TG, liver cholesterol, and IHL. HIIT exhibited superior efficacy over VDS in reducing ChREBP-β, ACC1, insulin, FBG, liver TG and cholesterol, as well as increasing p-ACC1 and PKA. Notably, the combined intervention of HIIT and VDS yielded the most substantial improvements across all the parameters. CONCLUSIONS: HFrD causes IHL accumulation and the onset of diabetes, whereas VDS and HIIT, along with their combined effects, prevent the consequences of HFrD.",

Rats were divided into 3 groups; control, HFrD, and combined HFrD with ADMSCs. We assessed liver functions, gut microbiota activity, oxidative stress, adiponectin, and IL10 levels. Also, we measured SREBP-1, IRS-1 expression using Western blot, and Malat1 expression using rt-PCR. ADMSCs antagonized metabolic abnormalities induced by HFrD in the form of improvement of liver functions and alleviation of oxidative stress. In addition, ADMSCs ameliorated gut microbiota activity besides the elevation of adiponectin and IL10 levels. ADMSCs attenuated insulin resistance through upregulation of IRS1 and downregulation of SREBP-1 and Malat1. ADMSCs can protect against HFrD-induced metabolic hazards.",

FBP reduces glycolytic capacity of cells via blocking HIF-1α transcriptional activity and modulating NF-κB action, and influences oxidative metabolism by binding to c-MYC. Because FBP limits the energy-producing potential of cells and because a reduction of FBP amounts is observed in cancer cells, FBP is considered to be an anti-oncogenic protein. This is supported by the observation that cancer cells overexpress aldolase A (ALDOA), a pro-oncogenic protein that can bind to FBP and potentially block its anti-oncogenic activity. Interestingly, only the muscle isozyme of FBP (FBP2) interacts strongly with ALDOA, whereas the binding of the liver isozyme (FBP1) to ALDOA is more than an order of magnitude weaker. Here, we briefly review the most important evidence supporting the anti-oncogenic function of FBP and discuss what structural properties of the two FBP isozymes allow FBP2, rather than FBP1, to exert more flexible anticancer functions.",

Visceral (VAT) and subcutaneous (SAT) adipose tissue was quantified with MRI. Serum interleukin 6 and 8, tumour necrosis factor alpha and adiponectin levels were measured with sandwich immunoassay. BMI decreased in both groups, but the change did not differ between groups (-0.1 kg/m2, 95%CI: -0.3; 0.5).

Materials and Methods: Thirty Wistar rats were divided into three groups: a control group, a fatty liver group induced by 35% fructose supplementation, and a treatment group receiving S. boulardii (100 mg/kg/day) after fructose induction. Results: Biochemical analyses revealed that the treatment group exhibited significantly lower plasma levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), total triglycerides, and cholesterol compared to the untreated fatty liver group (p < 0.05). Furthermore, liver tissue analysis showed a marked reduction in lipid accumulation and fatty infiltration in the treatment group, with no visible lipid vacuoles in hepatocytes. The expression of aquaporin-8 (AQP8) and sirtuin-1 (SIRT1), key markers associated with hepatocyte function and lipid metabolism, was significantly higher in the S. boulardii group compared to the fatty liver group (p < 0.001). Conclusions: These findings indicate that S. boulardii supplementation mitigates the metabolic and oxidative stress-related alterations associated with fructose-induced NAFLD. In conclusion, our study suggests that S. boulardii exerts protective effects on the liver by reducing lipid accumulation and oxidative stress, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic intervention for NAFLD.",

      "abstract": "Metabolic-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD), also known as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), is a worldwide liver disease without definitive or widely used therapeutic drugs in clinical practice. In this study, we confirm that 6-gingerol (6-G), an active ingredient of ginger (Zingiber officinale Roscoe) in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), can alleviate fructose-induced hepatic steatosis. It was found that 6-G significantly decreased hyperlipidemia caused by high-fructose diets (HFD) in rats, and reversed the increase in hepatic de novo lipogenesis (DNL) and triglyceride (TG) levels induced by HFD, both in vivo and in vitro. Mechanistically, chemical proteomics and cellular thermal shift assay (CETSA)-proteomics approaches revealed that stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD) is a direct binding target of 6-G, which was confirmed by further CETSA assay and molecular docking. Meanwhile, it was found that 6-G could not alter SCD expression (in either mRNA or protein levels), but inhibited SCD activity (decreasing the desaturation levels of fatty acids) in HFD-fed rats. Furthermore, SCD deficiency mimicked the ability of 6-G to reduce lipid accumulation in HF-induced HepG2 cells, and impaired the improvement in hepatic steatosis brought about by 6-G treatment in HFD supplemented with oleic acid diet-induced SCD1 knockout mice. Taken together, our present study demonstrated that 6-G inhibits DNL by targeting SCD to alleviate fructose diet-induced hepatic steatosis.",

      "abstract": "Excessive fructose intake is a risk factor for the development of obesity and its complications. Targeting ketohexokinase (KHK), the first enzyme of fructose metabolism, has been investigated for the management of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD). We compared the effects of systemic, small molecule inhibitor of KHK enzymatic activity with hepatocyte-specific, N-acetylgalactosamine siRNA-mediated knockdown of KHK in mice on an HFD. We measured KHK enzymatic activity, extensively quantified glycogen accumulation, performed RNA-Seq analysis, and enumerated hepatic metabolites using mass spectrometry. Both KHK siRNA and KHK inhibitor led to an improvement in liver steatosis; however, via substantially different mechanisms, KHK knockdown decreased the de novo lipogenesis pathway, whereas the inhibitor increased the fatty acid oxidation pathway. Moreover, KHK knockdown completely prevented hepatic fructolysis and improved glucose tolerance. Conversely, the KHK inhibitor only partially reduced fructolysis, but it also targeted triokinase, mediating the third step of fructolysis. This led to the accumulation of fructose-1 phosphate, resulting in glycogen accumulation, hepatomegaly, and impaired glucose tolerance. Overexpression of wild-type, but not kinase-dead, KHK in cultured hepatocytes increased hepatocyte injury and glycogen accumulation after treatment with fructose. The differences between KHK inhibition and knockdown are, in part, explained by the kinase-dependent and -independent effects of KHK on hepatic metabolism.",

This study aimed to elucidate the relationship between fructose utilization and pancreatic cancer progression. Our findings revealed that pancreatic cancer cells have a high capacity to utilize fructose and are capable of converting glucose to fructose via the AKR1B1-mediated polyol pathway, in addition to uptake via the fructose transporter GLUT5. Fructose metabolism exacerbates pancreatic cancer proliferation by enhancing glycolysis and accelerating the production of key metabolites that regulate angiogenesis. However, pharmacological blockade of fructose metabolism has been shown to slow pancreatic cancer progression and synergistically enhance anti-tumor capabilities when combined with anti-angiogenic agents. Overall, targeting fructose metabolism may prove to be a promising therapeutic approach in the treatment of pancreatic cancer.",

Studies have shown that the amino acid L-kynurenine (KYN) causes vasodilation in mammals, leading to hypotensive shock. In hypotensive shock, when activated by the KYN, the voltage-gated potassium channel encoded by the family KCNQ (Kv7) gene can cause vasodilation. Fructose-1,6-bisphosphate (FBP) it is being considered in studies an anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, immunomodulator, and a modulator of some ion channels (Ca2+, Na+, and K+). We analyzed the effects of KYN and FBP on mean blood pressure (MBP), systolic and diastolic (DBP) blood pressure, and heart rate variability (HRV) in Wistar rats. Results demonstrated that the administration of KYN significant decreased MBP, DBP, and increased HRV. Importantly, the FBP treatment reversed the KYN effects on MBP, DBP, and HRV. Molecular Docking Simulations suggested that KYN and FBP present a very close estimated free energy of binding and the same position into structure of KCNQ4. Our results did demonstrate that FBP blunted the decrease in BP, provoked by KYN. Results raise new hypotheses for future and studies in the treatment of hypotension resulting from inflammation.",

      "abstract": "In our pursuit of discovering new antidiabetic agents to manage type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), our approach aimed to identify the bioactive feature/pharmacophore responsible for PPAR-γ expression, as it is accountable for the glucose homeostasis and lipid metabolism. This was achieved by pharmacophore model generation, screening of rationally designed newer thiazolidinedione's library, identifying synthesizing and characterizing the top ten molecules (5a-5j) for their (Invitro & invivo) antidiabetic activity. Preliminary screening of all the ligands by Invitro glucose uptake assay in L6 myotubes (skeletal muscle cell line of rats) revealed compound 5b and 5f stimulated the glucose uptake with 79.29 ± 1.02 % and 74.58 ± 1.02 % respectively compared to pioglitazone with 82.36 ± 0.98 %. This was validated by PPAR-γ TF expression assay, which highlighted a dose dependent increase in transactivation of PPAR-γ. These compounds 5b and 5f were evaluated in fructose induced insulin resistance rat model. Where the treatment with 5b and 5f markedly increased the exogenous clearance of glucose and exogenous insulin via OGTT and ITT respectively, also improved the glucose utilization by significantly increasing content of glycogen and uptake of glucose in rat hemidiaphragm and reversed insulin resistance. Likewise a significant decreased in the VLDL and triglyceride levels was seen in 5b and 5f treated groups compared to insulin resistant (IR) group. It improved glycogenesis by catabolism of glucose and maintained glycaemic control. Similarly it had marked action on enzymatic oxidative biomarkers. Compound 5b displayed better, improved T1/2 (half-life) of 4.21 h and Kel (elimination constant) of 0.381 was noticed in comparison to compound 5f indicating the pharmacokinetic profile. Insilico studies like DFT calculations refined the geometry of 5b and 5f ligands, docking and molecular simulation provided the insights in binding affinity, dynamic behaviour and stability of ligands in PPAR-γ ligand binding domain. MM/GBSA provided the energetics of 5b and 5f in binding pocket. Finally network pharmacology identified ADIPOQ (adiponectin), NR1C3 (PPAR-γ), SLC2A4 (GLUT4), and LEP (leptin) proteins associate with compound 5b and 5f and enriched in Adipocytokine pathway, and PPAR-γ signaling pathway.",

Pre- and post-intervention, the subjects completed the Oguri-Shirakawa-Azumi Sleep Inventory, Middle-Aged and Aged Version (OSA-MA); Profile of Mood States, Second Edition (POMS2); and Constipation Assessment Scale (CAS) questionnaires. In the OSA-MA, both \"sleepiness on rising\" and \"sleep length\" were significantly improved after treatment with 1,5-AF compared with before treatment. Furthermore, in the POMS2, there was a clear tendency toward reduced \"Anger-Hostility\" in the 1,5-AF group after treatment, and in the CAS, there was a clear tendency toward reduced \"diarrhea or liquid stool\" in the 1,5-AF group after treatment.

      "abstract": "Recent studies have shown that high dietary fructose intake enhances intestinal tumor growth in mice. Our previous work indicated that glucose enables hypoxic colorectal cancer (CRC) cells to resist receptor-interacting protein (RIP)-dependent necroptosis. Despite having the same chemical formula, glucose and fructose are absorbed through different transporters yet both can enter the glycolytic metabolic pathway. The excessive intake of dietary fructose, leading to its overflow into the colon, allows colonic cells to absorb fructose apically. This study explores the mechanisms behind apical fructose-mediated death resistance in CRC cells under hypoxic stress. Utilizing three CRC cell lines (Caco-2, HT29, and T84) under normoxic and hypoxic conditions with varying fructose concentrations, we assessed lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity, RIP1/3 complex formation (a necroptosis marker), and cell integrity. We investigated the role of fructose in glycolytic-mediated death resistance using glycolytic inhibitors iodoacetate (IA, a glycolytic inhibitor to glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase), and UK5099 (UK, an inhibitor to mitochondrial pyruvate carrier). Our findings reveal that apical fructose prevents the hypoxia-induced RIP-dependent necroptosis in Caco-2 and HT29 cells. Fructose exposure under hypoxia also preserved epithelial integrity. IA, but not UK, blocked fructose-mediated glycolytic metabolite production and necrosis, indicating that anaerobic glycolytic metabolites facilitate death resistance. Notably, fructose treatment upregulated pyruvate kinase (PK)-M1 mRNA in hypoxic Caco-2 and HT29 cells, while PKM2 upregulation was exclusive to HT29 cells. In conclusion, apical fructose utilization through glycolysis effectively inhibits hypoxia-induced RIP-dependent necroptosis in CRC cells, shedding light on potential metabolic adaptation mechanisms in the tumor microenvironment and suggesting novel targets for therapeutic intervention."

METHODS: Male C57BL/6 mice received a control diet (C) or a high-fructose diet (HFRU) for ten weeks. Then, a five-week treatment started: C, C-LDT409, HFRU, and HFRU-LDT409. The LDT409 (40 mg/kg of body weight) was mixed with the diets. RESULTS: The HFRU diet caused insulin resistance and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. High Pparg and decreased Ppara expression increased steatosis and pro-fibrogenic gene expression in livers of HFRU-fed mice. Suppressed lipogenic factors, orchestrated by PPAR-gamma, and mitigated ER stress concomitant with the increase in beta-oxidation driven by PPAR-alpha mediated the LDT409 beneficial effects. CONCLUSIONS: LDT409 may represent a potential low-cost approach to treat metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease, which does not currently have a specific treatment.",

Based on the dual-ligand molecular docking model, a novel compound 45 bearing a benzimidazole scaffold was identified to show increased inhibitory activity against FBPase (IC50, 2.08 μM). An oral pyruvate tolerance test in ICR mice showed that 45 had a potent inhibitory effect on gluconeogenesis similar to that of metformin when administered as a single dose in vivo. Compound 45 did not inhibit the common subtypes of the human cytochrome P450 system, indicating that it may have a reduced propensity for drug-drug interactions.

      "abstract": "SCOPE: Maternal high fructose diet (HFD) during pregnancy and lactation can initiate retinal dysfunction. However, the underlying mechanism remains largely unknown. METHODS AND RESULTS: By using the rodent model of maternal HFD in this study, the results from electroretinography (ERG) indicate that b-wave amplitude, an index of inner retinal function, is significantly reduced as early as 3 months old and the deteriorated effect can be detected at 15 months old. Further, the protein expressions of CD11b (a marker of active microglia), p40phox subunit of NADPH oxidase, GFAP (a marker of active astrocytes), and NLPR3 examined by western blot and immunofluorescence are significantly increased in the retina of the male HFD offspring at 3 months old. Treatment with omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (ω-3 PUFAs) for 2 weeks (from 2.5 to 3 months old) effectively reverses the aforementioned changes. CONCLUSION: Together, these results indicate that the early onset and extensive retinal dysfunction may be a result of glial activation which is induced by maternal HFD to initiate an inflammatory microenvironment leading to a long-term progression of retinopathy. Short-term administration of ω-3 PUFA at a young age may be a feasible strategy to intervene in the maternal HFD-programmed retinal impairment in male offspring.",

      "abstract": "Oral cancer remains a significant global health concern and its early detection plays a crucial role in improving patient outcomes. Identifying reliable prognostic markers is essential to guide treatment decisions and enhance survival rates. Fructose 1,6-bisphosphate aldolase (FBA), a glycolytic enzyme, has emerged as a promising candidate for prognostic assessment of oral cancer. This review highlights the role of FBA in tumorigenesis, its potential utility in predicting disease progression and patient survival, and its influence on response to radiotherapy. Recent studies have suggested that dysregulated metabolic pathways involving FBA may contribute to radiation resistance in oral cancer, emphasizing the need for further exploration of FBA-targeted therapeutic strategies. Understanding the role of FBA in oral cancer pathogenesis could pave the way for the development of personalized treatment strategies, including combined radiotherapy.",

      "abstract": "The long-term high-fat, high-sugar diet exacerbates type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM)-related cognitive impairments. Phlorizin, a well-studied natural compound found in apples and other plants, is recognized for its bioactive properties, including modulation of glucose and lipid metabolism. Despite its established role in mitigating metabolic disorders, the neuroprotective effects of phlorizin, particularly against diabetes-related cognitive dysfunction, have not been fully elucidated. Therefore, the present study aimed to investigate the effect of dietary supplementation of phlorizin on high-fat and high-fructose diet (HFFD)-induced cognitive dysfunction and evaluate the crucial role of the microbiota-gut-brain axis. We found that dietary supplementation of phlorizin for 14 weeks effectively prevented glucolipid metabolism disorder, spatial learning impairment, and memory impairment in HFFD mice. In addition, phlorizin improved the HFFD-induced decrease in synaptic plasticity, neuroinflammation, and excessive activation of microglia in the hippocampus. Transcriptomics analysis shows that the protective effect of phlorizin on cognitive impairment was associated with increased expression of neurotransmitters and synapse-related genes in the hippocampus. Phlorizin treatment alleviated colon microbiota disturbance, mainly manifested by an increase in gut microbiota diversity and the abundance of short-chain fatty acid (SCFA)-producing bacteria. The level of microbial metabolites, including SCFA, inosine 5'-monophosphate (IMP), and D (-)-beta-hydroxybutyric acid (BHB) were also significantly increased after phlorizin treatment. Integrating multiomics analysis observed tight connections between phlorizin-regulated genes, microbiota, and metabolites. Furthermore, removal of the gut microbiota via antibiotics treatment diminished the protective effect of phlorizin against HFFD-induced cognitive impairment, underscoring the critical role of the gut microbiota in mediating cognitive behavior. Importantly, supplementation with SCFA and BHB alone mimicked the regulatory effects of phlorizin on cognitive function. Therefore, phlorizin shows promise as a potential nutritional therapy for addressing cognitive impairment associated with metabolic disorders. Further research is needed to explore its effectiveness in preventing and alleviating neurodegenerative diseases.",

OBJECTIVE: This study determines the effect of Brazil nut (Bertholletia excelsa) and metformin on diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM) in fructose/streptozotocin (STZ)-induced type 2 diabetic rats and also characterizes using Gas Chromatography Mass Spectrophotometry and Fourier Transform Infrared the bioactive compounds in 50% aqueous ethanol extract of Brazil nut. DESIGN: After inducing type 2 DM, 30 male albino Wistar rats were separated into five groups that comprised of six rats per group, and they were treated as follows: groups 1 (Control) and 2 (Diabetic control) rats received rat pellets and distilled water; group 3 (Diabetic + Brazil nut) received rat pellets and Brazil nut extract (100 mg/kg, orally) dissolved in distilled water, group 4 (Diabetic + metformin) received metformin (100 mg/kg, orally) dissolved in distilled water, while group 5 (Diabetic + Brazil nut + metformin) received oral administrations of Brazil nut (100 mg/kg) and metformin (100 mg/kg) dissolved in distilled water. This study lasted for 6 weeks. The dose of Brazil nut used was selected from our pilot study on the minimum therapeutic dose of different concentrations of Brazil nut extract. RESULTS: STZ administration induced insulin resistance, hyperglycemia, loss of weight, dyslipidemia, oxidative stress, inflammation, apoptosis, alteration of mammalian target of rapamycin, mitogen-activated protein kinase, heart function markers (creatine kinase MB, lactate dehydrogenase, and aspartate amino transaminase), and heart histology of the diabetic control, which was ameliorated after treatment with Brazil nut and metformin, but their combined treatment was better than the single treatments. CONCLUSION: This study shows that Brazil nut contains several bioactive compounds that support its biological properties as well as its candidature as a complementary therapy to metformin in mitigating cardiac complications arising from DM in rats."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The combination of a high fructose and high salt diet typical of western diet induces high blood pressure, aortic stiffening, left ventricular (LV) diastolic dysfunction and impaired renal function in rodents. Despite an activated renin-angiotensin system (RAS) in rats fed high fructose and high salt, acute inhibition of the RAS pathway does not improve cardiac and vascular parameters. It may well be that longer term treatment is required to permit remodeling and improve cardiovascular function. Thus, we hypothesized that chronic RAS inhibition fructose+high salt-fed rats to restore blood pressure (BP) to levels similar to glucose plus normal salt-fed controls will improve cardiorenal function and histopathology. METHODS: Male and female Sprague Dawley rats monitored by hemodynamic telemetry were fed 0.4% NaCl chow during baseline, then changed to chow containing either 20% glucose+0.4% NaCl (G) or 20% fructose+4% NaCl (F) and treated with vehicle, enalapril (Enal, 4 mg/kg/d) or losartan (Los, 8 mg/kg/d) by osmotic minipump for 25-26 days. RESULTS: BP was elevated in the fructose+high salt groups of both sexes (P < 0.05) and restored to control levels by Enal or Los. Pulse wave velocity (PWV) was lower in female F+Los rats and cardiac output higher in female F+Enal rats. GFR was not changed by diet or treatment. Fructose+high salt groups of both sexes displayed higher albuminuria that was decreased by Enal in male rats. Cardiac fibrosis and mesangial hypercellularity were greater in fructose+high salt-fed rats of both sexes and improved with either Los or Enal. DISCUSSION: Thus, inhibition of the RAS improves early changes in cardiac and renal histopathology in both sexes and albuminuria in male rats fed high fructose and high salt diet. Functional improvements in cardiorenal parameters may require longer treatment."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The twigs and roots of Erythrina subumbrans (Hassk). Merr. Was reported to possess antidiabetic activity by reducing the activity of α-glucosidase and α-amylase. TNF-α is a pro-inflammatory cytokine in obesity and diabetes mellitus (DM). It inhibits the action of insulin, causing insulin resistance. Adiponectin is an anti-inflammatory peptide synthesized in white adipose tissue (WAT) and its high levels are linked with a decreased risk of DM. However, information about the effect of Erythrina subumbrans (Hassk). Merr. on insulin resistance are still lacking. PURPOSE: To obtain the effects of the ethanol extract of E. subumbrans (Hassk) Merr. leaves (EES) in improving insulin resistance conditions. METHODS: The leaves were collected at Ciamis, West Java, Indonesia, and were extracted using ethanol 96%. The effects of EES were studied in fructose-induced adult male Wistar rats by performing the insulin tolerance test (ITT) and assessing blood glucose, TNF-α, adiponectin, and FFA levels. The number of WAT and BAT of the adipose tissues was also studied. The total phenols and flavonoids in EES were determined by the spectrophotometric method and the presence of quercetin in EES was analyzed using the LC-MS method. RESULTS: EES significantly reduced % weight gain, TNF-α levels, and increased adiponectin levels in fructose-induced Wistar rats. EES significantly reduced the FFA levels of fructose-induced Wistar rats and significantly affected the formation of BAT similar to that of metformin. All rats in EES and metformin groups improved insulin resistance as proven by higher ITT values (3.01 ± 0.91 for EES 100 mg/kg BW; 3.01 ± 1.22 for EES 200 mg/kg BW; 5.86 ± 3.13 for EES 400 mg/kg BW; and 6.44 ± 2.58 for metformin) compared with the fructose-induced group without treatment (ITT = 2.62 ± 1.38). EES contains polyphenol compounds (2.7638 ± 0.0430 mg GAE/g extract), flavonoids (1.9626 ± 0.0152 mg QE/g extract), and quercetin 0.246 µg/mL at m/z 301.4744. CONCLUSION: Erythrina subumbrans (Hassk). Merr. extract may have the potential to be further explored for its activity in improving insulin resistance conditions. However, further studies are needed to confirm its role in alleviating metabolic disorders.",

METHODS: Wistar rats received fructose diluted in drinking water (10%) or water for 60 days prior to mating. Fructose overload was maintained until the end of lactation. The offspring (21 days after birth) of control and fructose-overloaded animals were divided into three groups: control (C), fructose (F) and fructose + galantamine (GAL). GAL (5 mg/kg) was administered orally until the offspring were 51 days old. Metabolic, hemodynamic and cardiovascular autonomic modulation were evaluated. RESULTS: The F group showed decreased insulin tolerance (KITT) compared to the C and GAL groups. The F group, in comparison to the C group, had increased arterial blood pressure, heart rate and sympathovagal balance (LF/HF ratio) and a low-frequency band of systolic arterial pressure (LF-SAP). The GAL group, in comparison to the F group, showed increased vagally mediated RMSSD index, a high-frequency band (HF-PI) and decreased LF/HF ratio and variance in SAP (VAR-SAP) and LF-SAP. Correlations were found between HF-PI and KITT (r = 0.60), heart rate (r = -0.65) and MAP (r = -0.71). CONCLUSIONS: GAL treatment significantly improved cardiovascular autonomic modulation, which was associated with the amelioration of cardiometabolic dysfunction in offspring of parents exposed to chronic fructose consumption."

This study evaluated Sonchus maritimus-loaded niosomes (SmE-N) in hepatic encephalopathy induced by a high-fructose diet (HFD) in rats. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis of Sonchus maritimus extracts (SmE), the synthesis of niosomes, and their characterization were performed. For the in vivo study, 24 male rats were haphazardly divided into 4 groups (n=6) control, HFD (35%), HFD+SmE-N (50 mg/kg/day), and HFD+metformin (50 mg/kg/day). Clinical behaviors and biological markers were assessed for all groups. The in vitro results of the chromatographic analysis revealed that Sonchus maritimus contains important phenolic acids, including gallic acid, vanillic acid, chlorogenic acid, and caffeic acid, as well as diverse flavonoids, including quercetin, rutin, and naringin bioactive compounds. The niosome formulation, characterized by the encapsulation efficiency of SmE, reached up to 61.40%. The in vivo results of the HFD showed a significant change in behavior parameters, liver glycogen, transaminase enzymes, brain protein, and acetylcholine esterase levels. In addition, there was a significant increase in malondialdehyde levels and a decrease in glutathione, superoxide dismutase, and glutathione peroxidase activities in the HFD group compared to the control group. Furthermore, the histopathological observation recorded a profound modiﬁcation in the liver and brain tissues of the HFD group. In contrast, the treatment with SmE-N and metformin assured a partial amelioration in the noticed parameters compared to the HFD group, but SmE-N led to a better improvement than metformin compared to the control group. In conclusion, the use of SmE-N bioconjugated by linoleic acid seems powerful in treating the complications of fructose-induced metabolic disorders due to its hepato-neuroprotective abilities.",

An immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining analysis was used to detect the expression of proliferation-related proteins in tissues. 16S rRNA sequencing for microbial community, gas chromatography for short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), and mass spectrometry analysis for glycolysis products in the intestines were performed. Furthermore, lactic acid assay kit was used to detect the glycolysis levels in vitro. RESULTS: RS suppressed HFCS-induced colon tumorigenesis through reshaping the microbial community. Mechanistically, the alteration of the microbial community after RS supplement increased the levels of intestinal SCFAs, especially butyrate, leading to the suppression of glycolysis and CRC cell proliferation by downregulating HK2. CONCLUSIONS: Our study identified RS as a candidate of protective factors in CRC and may provide a potential target for HFCS-related CRC treatment.",

The aim of this study was to observe the protective effects of fructose-1,6-bisphosphate (FDP) postconditioning on myocardial ischaemia-reperfusion injury in patients undergoing cardiac valve replacement with extracorporeal circulation. METHODS: Patients undergoing elective mitral valve replacement and/or aortic valve replacement were divided into normal saline postconditioning group (NS group) and FDP postconditioning group (FDP group). The primary outcome was the plasma concentration of creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB). The secondary outcomes were the plasma concentrations of lactate dehydrogenase, CK, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, alpha-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase and cardiac troponin I, the spontaneous cardiac rhythm recovery profile, the extracorporeal circulation time and duration of surgery, intensive care unit and postoperative hospitalization. RESULTS: Forty patients were randomly assigned to receive intervention and included in the analysis. The serum concentrations of CK-MB, lactate dehydrogenase, CK, cardiac troponin I, alpha-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein at T1∼4 were lower in the FDP group than in the NS group (P < 0.001). Compared with the NS group, the dosage of dopamine administered 1-90 min after cardiac resuscitation, the spontaneous cardiac rhythm recovery time and the incidence of ventricular fibrillation were lower in the FDP group (P < 0.001, P < 0.001 and P = 0.040, respectively). The values of ST- changes were increased more significantly in the NS group than in the FDP group (median [standard deviation] 1.3 [0.3] mm vs 0.7 [0.2] mm; P < 0.001). Compared with the NS group, the time of recovery of ST-segment deviations was shorter in the FDP group (50.3 [12.3] min vs 34.6 [6.9] min; P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The FDP postconditioning could improve both myocardial ischaemia-reperfusion injury and the spontaneous cardiac rhythm recovery during cardiac valve surgery with extracorporeal circulation.",

Understanding the impact of increasing fructose consumption on the small intestine is crucial since the small intestine processes fructose into glucose. ∆9-Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), a key cannabinoid, interacts with CB1 and CB2 receptors in the gastrointestinal tract, potentially mitigating inflammation. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the effects of the high-fructose diet (HFD) on the jejunum of rats and the role of THC consumption in reversing these effects. Experiments were conducted on Sprague-Dawley rats, with the experimental groups as follows: control (C), HFD, THC, and HFD + THC. The HFD group received a 10% fructose solution in drinking water for 12 weeks. THC groups were administered 1.5 mg/kg/day of THC intraperitoneally for the last four weeks. Following sacrification, the jejunum was evaluated for mucus secretion capacity. IL-6, JNK, CB2 and PCNA expressions were assessed through immunohistochemical analysis and the ultrastructural alterations via transmission electron microscopy. The results showed that fructose consumption did not cause weight gain but triggered inflammation in the jejunum, disrupted the cell proliferation balance, and increased mucus secretion in rats. Conversely, THC treatment displayed suppressed inflammation and improved cell proliferation balance caused by HFD. Ultrastructural examinations showed that the zonula occludens structures deteriorated in the HFD group, along with desmosome shrinkage. Mitochondria were found to be increased due to THC application following HFD. In conclusion, the findings of this research reveal the therapeutic potential of THC in reversing HFD-related alterations and provide valuable insights for clinical application.",

      "abstract": "The possibility to print electronics by means of office tools has remarkedly increased the possibility to design affordable and robust point-of-care/need devices. However, conductive inks suffer from low electrochemical and rheological performances limiting their applicability in biosensors. Herein, a fast CO2 laser approach to activate printed carbon inks towards direct enzymatic bioelectrocatalysis (3rd generation) is proposed and exploited to build biosensors for D-fructose analysis in biological fluids. The CO2 laser treatment was compared with two lab-grade printed transducers fabricated with solvent (SB) and water (WB) based carbon inks. The use of the laser revealed significant morpho-chemical variations on the printed inks and was investigated towards enzymatic direct catalysis, using Fructose dehydrogenase (FDH) integrated into entirely lab-produced biosensors. The laser-driven activation of the inks unveils the inks' direct electron transfer (DET) ability between FDH and the electrode surface. Sub-micromolar limits of detection (SB-ink LOD = 0.47 μM; WB-ink LOD = 0.24 μM) and good linear ranges (SB-ink: 5-100 μM; WB-ink: 1-50 μM) were obtained, together with high selectivity due to use of the enzyme and the low applied overpotential (0.15 V vs. pseudo-Ag/AgCl). The laser-activated biosensors were successfully used for D-fructose determination in complex synthetic and real biological fluids (recoveries: 93-112%; RSD ≤8.0%, n = 3); in addition, the biosensor ability for continuous measurement (1.5h) was also demonstrated simulating physiological D-fructose fluctuations in cerebrospinal fluid.",

However, mounting evidence indicates a link between the glycolysis and tumorigenesis, including gastric cancer. METHODS: Our research identified 5508 differently expressed mRNAs in gastric cancer. Then, the genes highly associated with tumorigenesis were identified through weighted correlation network analysis (WGCNA). Bioinformatics analysis observed that these hub genes were significantly linked to the regulation of cell cycle, drug metabolism, and glycolysis. Among these hub genes, there is a critical gene involved in glycolysis regulation, namely fructose-bisphosphate B (ALDOB). RESULTS: Analysis based on The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and three Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) datasets revealed that ALDOB was significantly downregulated in GC compared with normal tissues. In addition, cell viability assay confirmed that ALDOB acted as a tumor suppressor. Finally, drug sensitivity analysis revealed that ALDOB increased the sensitivity of gastric cancer cells to most antitumor drugs, especially talazoparib, XAV939, and FTI-277. Our results showed that the expression of ALDOB was significantly lower in GC tissues than in normal tissues. And ALDOB significantly inhibited proliferation and migration, delayed glycolysis in GC cells. Consequently, our study suggests that ALDOB may be a potential target for the clinical treatment of gastric cancer.",

Increased fructose consumption has also been associated with alterations in cognitive capacity and behavior. The present study investigated the effects of prenatal dexamethasone exposure on synaptic plasticity, locomotion, anxiety, and recognition memory in adult male Wistar rat offspring, and whether these effects are potentiated by postnatal fructose consumption. Pregnant female rats were treated with dexamethasone during late gestation and male offspring were supplemented with a moderate dose of fructose. Recognition memory, locomotion, and anxiety-like behavior were assessed using a novel object recognition test, open-field test, and elevated plus maze, respectively. Hippocampal synaptic plasticity was estimated by the levels of growth-associated protein 43 (GAP-43), synaptophysin, postsynaptic density protein 95, calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase IIα, and their activating phosphorylations. Additionally, protein levels of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and its transcriptionally active phosphorylated form were evaluated. Prenatal dexamethasone treatment induced an anxiolytic-like effect, stimulation of exploratory behavior, and novelty preference associated with an increase in GR and GAP-43 protein levels in the hippocampus. Fructose overconsumption after weaning did not modify the effects of prenatal glucocorticoid exposure. Applied prenatal dexamethasone treatment may induce changes in reactions to novel situations in male Wistar rats."

Nevertheless, fructose's specific function and precise mechanism in colorectal cancer liver metastasis (CRLM) is rarely known. Here, this study reported that the fructose absorbed by primary colorectal cancer could accelerate CRLM, and the expression of KHK-A, not KHK-C, in liver metastasis was higher than in paired primary tumors. Furthermore, KHK-A facilitated fructose-dependent CRLM in vitro and in vivo by phosphorylating PKM2 at Ser37. PKM2 phosphorylated by KHK-A inhibited its tetramer formation and pyruvic acid kinase activity but promoted the nuclear accumulation of PKM2. EMT and aerobic glycolysis activated by nuclear PKM2 enhance CRC cells' migration ability and anoikis resistance during CRLM progression. TEPP-46 treatment, targeting the phosphorylation of PKM2, inhibited the pro-metastatic effect of KHK-A. Besides, c-myc activated by nuclear PKM2 promotes alternative splicing of KHK-A, forming a positive feedback loop."

No cure exists for HFI and treatment is limited to avoid exposure to fructose and sugar. Using aldolase B deficient mice, here we identify a yet unrecognized metabolic event activated in HFI and associated with the progression of the disease. Besides the accumulation of F1P, here we show that the activation of the purine degradation pathway is a common feature in aldolase B deficient mice exposed to fructose. The purine degradation pathway is a metabolic route initiated by adenosine monophosphate deaminase 2 (AMPD2) that regulates overall energy balance. We demonstrate that very low amounts of fructose are sufficient to activate AMPD2 in these mice via a phosphate trap. While blocking AMPD2 do not impact F1P accumulation and the risk of hypoglycemia, its deletion in hepatocytes markedly improves the metabolic dysregulation induced by fructose and corrects fat and glycogen storage while significantly increasing the voluntary tolerance of these mice to fructose. In summary, we provide evidence for a critical pathway activated in HFI that could be targeted to improve the metabolic consequences associated with fructose consumption.",

In this study, we investigated contractile activity, morphology, and intracellular activity of antioxidant enzymes in uteri from virgin Wistar rats subjected to liquid fructose supplementation and/or unpredictable stress over 9 weeks. Contractile activity and uterine response to oxytocin or adrenaline were examined ex vivo using isolated bath chambers. Fructose supplementation, irrespective of stress, affected uterine morphology by increasing endometrium while decreasing myometrium volume density, attenuated uterine response to increasing doses of oxytocin, and increased glutathione peroxidase activity. Stress, irrespective of fructose, attenuated dose-dependent adrenaline-induced uterine relaxation. Stress, when applied solely, decreased mitochondrial superoxide dismutase activity. In the combined treatment, irregular estrous cycles and both reduced response to oxytocin and to adrenaline (as a consequence of fructose consumption and exposure to stress), along with fructose-related alteration of uterine morphology, were detected. In conclusion, fructose and stress affect uterine contractile activity, irrespective of each other, by inducing completely distinct responses in isolated uteri. In the combined treatment, the effects of both factors were evident, suggesting that the combination exerts more detrimental effects on the uterus than each factor individually.",

Previously, elevated branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) have been correlated with the severity of insulin resistance. Most recently, the effect of fructose consumption on the downregulation of BCAA catabolic enzymes was observed. Thus, this mechanistic study investigated the effects of physiologically attainable levels of fructose, both with and without concurrent insulin resistance, in a myotube model of skeletal muscle. METHODS: C2C12 mouse myoblasts were treated with fructose at a concentration of 100 µM (which approximates physiologically attainable concentrations in peripheral circulation) both with and without hyperinsulinemic-mediated insulin resistance. Gene expression was assessed by qRT-PCR, and protein expression was assessed by Western blot. Oxygen consumption rate and extracellular acidification rate were used to assess mitochondrial oxidative and glycolytic metabolism, respectively. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry was utilized to analyze leucine, isoleucine and valine concentration values. RESULTS: Fructose significantly reduced peak glycolytic and peak mitochondrial metabolism without altering related gene or protein expression. Similarly, no effect of fructose on BCAA catabolic enzymes was observed; however, fructose treatment resulted in elevated total extracellular BCAA in insulin-resistant cells. DISCUSSION: Collectively, these observations demonstrate that fructose at physiologically attainable levels does not appear to alter insulin sensitivity or BCAA catabolic potential in cultured myotubes. However, fructose may depress peak cell metabolism and BCAA utilization during insulin resistance.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: It has been reported that High-Fructose (HF) consumption, considered one of the etiological factors of Metabolic Syndrome (MetS), causes changes in the gut microbiota and metabolic disorders. There is limited knowledge on the effects of metformin in HF-induced intestinal irregularities in male and female rats with MetS. OBJECTIVES: In this study, we investigated the sex-dependent effects of metformin treatment on the gut microbiota, intestinal Tight Junction (TJ) proteins, and inflammation parameters in HF-induced MetS. METHODS: Fructose was given to the male and female rats as a 20% solution in drinking water for 15 weeks. Metformin (200 mg/kg) was administered by gastric tube once a day during the final seven weeks. Biochemical, histopathological, immunohistochemical, and bioinformatics analyses were performed. Differences were considered statistically significant at p < 0.05. RESULTS: The metformin treatment in fructose-fed rats promoted glucose, insulin, Homeostasis Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance Index (HOMA-IR), and Triglyceride (TG) values in both sexes. The inflammation score was significantly decreased with metformin treatment in fructose-fed male and female rats (p < 0.05). Moreover, metformin treatment significantly decreased Interleukin-1 Beta (IL-1β) and Tumor Necrosis Factor-Alpha (TNF-α) in ileum tissue from fructose-fed males (p < 0.05). Intestinal immunoreactivity of Occludin and Claudin-1 was increased with metformin treatment in fructose-fed female rats. HF and metformin treatment changed the gut microbial composition. Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes (F/B) ratio increased with HF in females. In the disease group, Bifidobacterium pseudolongum; in the treatment group, Lactobacillus helveticus and Lactobacillus reuteri are the prominent species in both sexes. When the male and female groups were compared, Akkermansia muciniphila was prominent in the male treatment group. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, metformin treatment promoted biochemical parameters in both sexes of fructose-fed rats. Metformin showed a sex-dependent effect on inflammation parameters, permeability factors, and gut microbiota. Metformin has partly modulatory effects on fructose-induced intestinal changes.",

      "abstract": "Excessive intake of fat and fructose in Western diets has been confirmed to induce renal lipotoxicity, thereby driving the progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD). This study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of magnoflorine in a CKD mouse model subjected to high-fat and high-fructose diets. Our results demonstrated that magnoflorine treatment ameliorated abnormal renal function indices (serum creatinine, urea nitrogen, uric acid, and urine protein) in high-fat- and high-fructose-fed mice. Histologically, renal tubular cell steatosis, lipid deposition, tubular dilatation, and glomerular fibrosis were significantly reduced by the magnoflorine treatment in these mice. Mechanistically, magnoflorine promotes Parkin/PINK1-mediated mitophagy, thereby inhibiting NLRP3/Caspase-1-mediated pyroptosis. Consistent findings were observed in the palmitic acid-incubated HK-2 cell model. Notably, both silencing of Parkin and the use of a mitophagy inhibitor reversed the inhibitory effect of magnoflorine on NLRP3 inflammasome activation in vitro. Therefore, the present study provides compelling evidence that magnoflorine improves renal injury in high-fat- and high-fructose-fed mice by promoting Parkin/PINK1-dependent mitophagy to inhibit NLRP3 inflammasome activation and pyroptosis. Our findings suggest that dietary supplementation with magnoflorine and magnoflorine-rich foods (such as magnolia) might be an effective strategy for the prevention of CKD.",

      "abstract": "The aim of this study was to improve insulin sensitivity in fructose-treated animals by ingestion of flavonoid quercetin. Several signs of insulin resistance have been developed in rats by drinking 10% fructose solution for 9 weeks. The effect of 6-week-gavage-administrated quercetin (20 mg/kg/day in 1% methyl cellulose solution) was monitored. Rats of the control groups received methyl cellulose vehicle as well. The most striking result of the quercetin treatment was the normalization of the fructose solution drinking to the level of drinking water intake. In addition, quercetin supplementation considerably decreased the plasma glucose and Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR) index in rats consuming fructose. Surprisingly, fructose ingestion did not elevate plasma uric acid, thiobarbituric acid reactive substances, nitrotyrosine, or advanced glycation end products fluorescence. Instead, a reduction of the above parameters was observed. In summary, these results indicate that quercetin supplementation reduces fructose drinking and decreases plasma glucose and the HOMA-IR index. Furthermore, methyl cellulose, in combination with fructose, causes uric acid - lowering, antioxidant and anti-glycation effects. Thus, methyl cellulose possibly shifts fructose metabolism in favor of the utilization of antioxidant features of fructose. Our results call for using methyl cellulose in sweetened beverages and other sweetened food.",

However, comprehensive descriptions of their molecular mechanisms of action remain elusive as appropriate in vitro evaluation systems are lacking. Organoid models can mimic physiological structures and reproduce in vivo functions, making them increasingly utilized in biomedical research for a better understand physiological and pathological phenomena. Therefore, organoid modeling can be a powerful approach for to understand the molecular mechanisms of nutrient action. The present study aims to demonstrate the utility of organoids in nutritional research by further investigating the molecular mechanisms responsible for the negative effects of fructose intake using liver organoids. Here, we treated liver organoids with fructose and analyzed their gene expression profiles and DNA methylation levels. Microarray analysis demonstrated that fructose-treated organoids exhibited increased selenoprotein p (Sepp1) gene expression, whereas pyrosequencing assays revealed reduced DNA methylation levels in the Sepp1 region. These results were consistent with observations using hepatic tissues from fructose-fed rats. Conversely, no differences in Sepp1 mRNA and DNA methylation levels were observed in two-dimensional cells. These results suggest that organoids serve as an ideal in vitro model to recapitulate in vivo tissue responses and help to validate the molecular mechanisms of nutrient action compared to conventional cellular models.",

However, the catalyst used in this reaction suffers from low selectivity and catalyst deactivation due to carbon or by-product deposition. In this study, MgSnO3 catalyst, synthesized via a facile two-step process involving hydrothermal treatment and calcination, was used for glucose isomerization to fructose. The catalyst demonstrated outstanding catalytic performance, achieving a fructose equilibrium yield of 29.8 % with a selectivity exceeding 90 % under mild conditions owing to its acid-base interaction. Notably, spent catalysts can be regenerated by photoirradiation to remove surface carbon, thereby avoiding the changes in properties and subsequent loss of activity associated with conventional calcination regeneration method. This novel approach eliminates the energy consumption and potential structural aggregation associated with traditional calcination regeneration methods. The acid-base active sites of the catalyst, along with their corresponding catalytic reaction mechanism and photoregeneration mechanism were investigated. This study presents a demonstration of the comprehensive utilization of catalytic material properties, i. e., acid-base and photocatalytic functionalities, for the development of a green and sustainable biomass thermochemical conversion system."

Selenium (Se) participates in the structure of antioxidant enzymes and has a medicinal effect. In this work, the protective impact of Se on kidney damage produced by high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS) via endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress was examined. The study comprised four groups, each consisting of ten experimental animals: control, HFCS (20%-HFCS), HFCS (20%-HFCS), + Se (0.3 mg/kg/day/po), and Se (0.3 mg/kg/day/po) alone. The duration of the experiment was 6 weeks. Kidney tissues were stained with hematoxylin and eosin for histological examination. Immunohistochemical analysis was conducted to assess TNF-α and caspase-3 levels. The spectrophotometric evaluation was performed to measure TOS (total oxidant status), TAS (total antioxidant status), and OSI (oxidative stress index) levels. The PERK, ATF4, CHOP, BCL-2, and caspase-9 gene expression levels were assessed by the RT-qPCR method. After Se treatment, histopathological abnormalities and TNF-α and caspase-3 levels in the HFCS+Se group decreased (p < 0.001). While TOS and OSI levels increased dramatically in the HFCS group, TAS values decreased significantly but improved after Se application (p < 0.001). The expression levels of the genes PERK, ATF4, CHOP, and caspase-9 were significantly lower in the HFCS group when compared to the HFCS+Se group (p < 0.05). Our findings suggest that Se may protect against ER stress, oxidative stress, apoptosis, and kidney damage caused by high-dose fructose consumption.",

Thirty rats were randomly divided into six groups (n = 5). The treatments, metformin (120 mg/kg), rutin (100 mg/kg), vitamin A (43 IU/kg), and a combination of rutin (100 mg/kg) and vitamin A (43 IU/kg) were given to relevant groups of rats along with high-fructose high-fat diet for 42 days. HbA1c, D-lactate, Glyoxylase-1, Hexokinase 2, malondialdehyde (MDA), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), catalase (CAT), nuclear transcription factor-B (NF-κB), interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-8 (IL-8) and histological examinations were performed after 42 days. The docking simulations were conducted using Auto Dock package. The combined effects of rutin and vitamin A in treated rats significantly (p < 0.001) reduced HbA1c, hexokinase 2, and D-lactate levels while preventing cellular damage. The combination dramatically (p < 0.001) decreased MDA, CAT, and GPx in treated rats and decreased the expression of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 andIL-8, as well as the transcription factor NF-κB. The molecular docking investigations revealed that rutin had a strong affinity for several important biomolecules, including as NF-κB, Catalase, MDA, IL-6, hexokinase 2, and GPx. The results propose beneficial impact of rutin and vitamin A as a convincing treatment strategy to treat AGE-related disorders, such as diabetes, autism, alzheimer's, atherosclerosis.",

To address this issue, we developed a novel biomineralization-inspired strategy to synthesize CaBPs-Na2FDP@CaCl2 nanosheets, aiming to achieve enhanced and selective anticancer bioactivity along with accelerated osteoblast activity. Benefiting from the in situ mineralization and fructose modification, CaBPs-Na2FDP@CaCl2 exhibited improved pH-responsive degradation behavior and targeted therapy for osteosarcoma. The in vitro results indicated that CaBPs-Na2FDP@CaCl2 exhibited efficient uptake and quick degradation by GLUT5-positive 143B osteosarcoma cells, enhancing BPs-driven chemotherapeutic effects through ATP level disturbance-mediated apoptosis of tumor cells. Moreover, CaBPs-Na2FDP@CaCl2 underwent gradual degradation into PO43-, Ca2+ and fructose in MC3T3-E1 cells, eliminating systemic toxicity. Intracellular Ca2+ bound to calmodulin (CaM), activating Ca2+/CaM-dependent signaling cascades, thereby enhancing osteoblast differentiation and mineralization in pro-osteoblastic cells. In vivo experiments affirmed the anti-tumor capability, inhibition of tumor recurrence and bone repair promotion of CaBPs-Na2FDP@CaCl2. This study not only broadens the application of BPs in bone tumor therapy but also provides a versatile surface functionalization strategy for nanotherapeutic agents.",

OBJECTIVE: This research attempted to investigate the efficacy of fennel seeds extract (FSE) in preventing development of cardiac dysfunction in rats on fructose enriched diet for 3 months, as a model of MetS. MATERIALS & METHODS: Thirty adult Wistar male rats (160-170 g) were assigned into 5 groups including control, vehicle, FSE (200 mg/kg BW) and fructose (60%) fed rats with and without FSE. Following the last treatment, blood pressure, ECG and heart rate were measured. Next, blood and cardiac tissues were taken for biochemical and histological investigations. RESULTS: Feeding fructose exhibited characteristic features of MetS involving, hypertension, abnormal ECG, elevated heart rate, serum glucose, insulin, lipids and insulin resistance, accompanied by abdominal obesity, cardiac hypertrophy and hyperuricemia. Fructose fed rats also showed significant reduction in cardiac antioxidants (GSH, SOD, CAT) with elevation in oxidative stress indices (NADPH oxidase, O2.-, H2O2, MDA, PCO), NF-κβ, pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6), adhesion molecules (ICAM-1, VCAM-1) and serum cardiac biomarkers (AST, LDH, CK-MB, cTn-I). Histopathological changes evidenced by destruction of cardiac myofibrils, cytoplasmic vacuolization, and aggregation of inflammatory cells were also detected. Consumption of FSE showed high ability to alleviate fructose-induced hypertension, ECG abnormalities, cardiac hypertrophy, metabolic alterations, oxidative stress, inflammation and histological injury. CONCLUSION: Findings could suggest FSE as a complementary supplement for preventing MetS and associated cardiac outcomes. However, well controlled clinical studies are still needed.",

Furthermore, study the effects of TiO2 NPs on antioxidant and oxidative stress biomarkers, as well as their effects on expression of apoptotic and hypoxia inducing factor-1α (HIF1A) protein translation. Moreover, the possible ameliorating effects of intraperitoneal injections of fructose (2.75 mM/ml) was examined. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty sexually mature (8-12 weeks old; ~ 25 g body weight) female mice were used for the current study. The female mice were assigned randomly to three treatment groups: Group1 (G1) mice were injected intraperitoneal (ip) with deionized water for 5 consecutive days; Group 2 (G2) mice were injected ip with TiO2 NPs (100 mg/kg BW) for 5 consecutive days; Group 3 (G3) mice were injected ip with TiO2 NPs (100 mg/kg BW + fructose (2.75 mM) for 5 consecutive days. RESULTS: Nano-titanium significantly decreased expression of GSH, GPx, and NO, expression of MDA and TAC increased. The rates of MI, MII, GVBD and degenerated oocytes were significantly less for nano-titanium treated mice, but the rate of activated oocytes was significantly greater than those in control oocytes. TiO2 NPs significantly increased expression of apoptotic genes (BAX, Caspase 3 and P53) and HIF1A. Intraperitoneal injection of fructose (2.75 mM/kg) significantly alleviated the detrimental effects of TiO2 NPs. Transmission electron microscopy indicated that fructose mitigated adverse effects of TiO2 NPs to alter the cell surface of murine oocytes. CONCLUSION: Results of this study suggest that the i/p infusion of fructose for consecutive 5 days enhances development of murine oocytes and decreases toxic effects of TiO2 NPs through positive effects on oxidative and antioxidant biomarkers in cumulus-oocyte complexes and effects to inhibit TiO2-induced increases in expression of apoptotic and hypoxia inducing factors.",

This disorder affects 1 in 20,000 people, constituting a rare disease with a favorable prognosis through adherence to a fructose-free diet. Despite dietary management, chronic pathology may manifest, underscoring the importance of early diagnosis to mitigate adverse effects. However, early detection of the disease poses significant challenges. AIM: Our aim was to compile pertinent information on the differential diagnosis of this pathology based on patient symptoms, facilitating the development of a diagnostic algorithm for early identification. METHODOLOGY: A systematic review adhering to PRISMA guidelines was conducted on empirical studies from PubMed, encompassing a total of 35 studies. RESULTS: Individuals with fructose intolerance may acutely experience postprandial symptoms such as hypoglycemia, vomiting, and abdominal distension. Despite proper treatment, chronic complications such as fatty liver, Fanconi syndrome, growth deficiency, and irritable bowel syndrome may arise. The proposed diagnostic algorithm aims to minimize these adverse processes. CONCLUSIONS: Understanding the pathogenesis enables prompt diagnosis and prevention of chronicity. Establishing continuity of care from pediatric to adult medicine is crucial, and disseminating information to non-pediatric endocrinologists is imperative for managing this rare disease."

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: The need to investigate the pathogenesis and treatment of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has led to the development of multiple mouse models. The aim of this study was to validate a fast food diet (FFD) mouse model that is introduced as being close to the human disease. METHODS: Eight to nine weeks old male and female C57BL/6 J mice were randomly allocated to a FFD group or to a chow diet (CD) group. Every four weeks, mice were weighed, and blood samples were collected for the measurement of glucose, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), triglycerides (TGs) and total cholesterol. After 25 weeks, mice were sacrificed, and liver tissue was histologically evaluated. RESULTS: FFD mice gained more weight (p = 0.049) and presented a higher liver-to-body weight ratio (p < 0.001) compared to CD mice. FFD group presented with greater steatosis, hepatocellular ballooning and NAFLD activity score (NAS), whereas lobular inflammation and fibrosis were not significantly different compared to CD. When stratified by sex, NAS was different between FFD and CD groups in both male and female mice. Group by time interaction was significant for weight, ALT and cholesterol, but not for glucose, AST and TGs. CONCLUSION: FFD mice presented with morphologic and biochemical features of NAFLD and with greater hepatic steatosis, hepatocellular ballooning and NAS, but not lobular inflammation and fibrosis, compared to CD mice. These results only partly validate the FFD mouse model for NAFLD, at least for a 6-month feeding period.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Abdominal pain remains one of the most common referral reasons to pediatric gastroenterology. Dietary intolerances are often considered but due to various factors are hardly pursued. We observed that diet review in large number of children with abdominal pain was high in sugary foods which led to food intolerance investigation and dietary intervention. METHODS: A retrospective review was conducted of patients presenting with abdominal pain, diarrhea, or vomiting and negative GI evaluation, who underwent fructose breath testing. Patients younger than 20 years old who were seen between June 1, 2018 and March 1, 2021 were included. Statistical analysis was performed in R. RESULTS: There were 110 pediatric patients during the study period who underwent fructose breath testing, with 31% male and 69% female. The average age was 12.14 ± 4.01 years, and the average BMI was 21.21 ± 6.12. Abdominal pain was the most common presenting symptom (74.5%) followed by diarrhea and vomiting. Seventy-seven patients (70%) had a positive fructose breath test and were diagnosed with dietary intolerance to fructose. The 56 (67.5%) of those patients experienced symptoms during the breath test. Forty-three patients improved with dietary intervention. Twenty-seven on low fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols diet and 16 on other diets. CONCLUSIONS: Based on analysis of our cohort of children with abdominal pain and high incidence of fructose intolerance as well as improvement in symptoms, following dietary changes, this condition should be considered and treated. Further investigation is needed to improve diagnostic testing but also into understanding mechanisms behind symptom presentation in this population.",

We explored the impact of obesity diversity derived from different carbohydrate qualities, with an emphasis on the increasing trend of excessive fructose consumption and its effect on DKD progression. In this study, we utilized db/db mice to establish a novel diabetic model characterized by fructose overconsumption, aiming to uncover the underlying mechanisms of renal damage. Compared to the control diet group, the fructose-fed db/db mice exhibited more pronounced obesity yet demonstrated milder glucose intolerance. Plasma cystatin C levels were elevated in the fructose model compared to the control, and this elevation was accompanied by enhanced glomerular sclerosis, even though albuminuria levels and tubular lesions were comparable. Single-cell RNA sequencing of the whole kidney highlighted an increase in Lrg1 in glomerular endothelial cells (GECs) in the fructose model, which appeared to drive mesangial fibrosis through enhanced TGF-β1 signaling. Our findings suggest that excessive fructose intake exacerbates diabetic kidney disease progression, mediated by aberrant Lrg1-driven crosstalk between GECs and mesangial cells.",

      "abstract": "Consumption of foods with fiber and compounds can promote gastrointestinal health and reduce obesity complications. Therefore, treatment with common bean leaves (BL) against obesity was evaluated in mice with a high-fat and high-fructose diet (HFFD) for 14 weeks. The bromatological and phytochemical characterization of BL were determined. Afterwards, the animals were supplemented with BL (10%) or a standard diet (SD) as a strategy to encourage a healthy diet for 12 additional weeks. Changes in body composition, lipid profile, and intestinal integrity were analyzed. The characterization of BL stood out for its content of 27.2% dietary fiber, total phenolics (475.04 mg/100 g), and saponins (2.2 mg/100 g). The visceral adipose tissue (VAT) decreased in the BL group by 52% compared to the HFFD group. Additionally, triglyceride levels were 23% lower in the BL consumption group compared to the HFFD group. The improvement in lipid profile was attributed to the 1.77-fold higher fecal lipid excretion in the BL consumption group compared to the HFFD group and the inhibition of pancreatic lipase by 29%. Furthermore, BL supplementation reduced the serum levels of IL-6 (4.4-fold) and FITC-dextran by 50% compared with those in the HFFD group. Metabolic endotoxemia was inhibited after BL supplementation (-33%) compared to the HFFD group. BL consumption as a treatment in obese mice reduces adipose tissue accumulation and improves the lipid profile. Furthermore, we report for the first time that BL consumption improves intestinal integrity.",

      "abstract": "Accumulating evidence suggests that excess fructose uptake induces metabolic syndrome and kidney injury. Here, we primarily investigated the influence of catalpol on fructose-induced renal inflammation in mice and explored its potential mechanism. Treatment with catalpol improved insulin sensitivity and hyperuricemia in fructose-fed mice. Hyperuricemia induced by high-fructose diet was associated with increases in the expressions of urate reabsorptive transporter URAT1 and GLUT9. Treatment with catalpol decreased the expressions of URAT1 and GLUT9. Futhermore, treatment with catalpol ameliorated renal inflammatory cell infiltration and podocyte injury, and these beneficial effects were associated with inhibiting the production of inflammatory cytokines including IL-1β, IL-18, IL-6 and TNF-α. Moreover, fructose-induced uric acid triggers an inflammatory response by activiting NLRP3 inflammasome, which then processes pro-inflammatory cytokines. Treatment with catalpol could inhibit the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome as well. Additionally, TLR4/MyD88 signaling was activated in fructose-fed mice, while treatment with catalpol inhibited this activation along with promoting NF-κB nuclear translocation in fructose-fed mice. Thus, our study demonstrated that catalpol could ameliorate renal inflammation in fructose-fed mice, attributing its beneficial effects to promoting uric acid excretion and inhibit the activation of TLR4/MyD88 signaling.",

With the use of high-fructose corn syrup in the food industry, consumption of fructose, which may be a tumor promoter, has increased dramatically. We examined fructose-induced oxidative DNA damage in the presence of Cu(II), with or without the addition of H2O2. With isolated DNA, fructose induced Cu(II)-mediated DNA damage, including formation of 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-oxodG), to a greater extent than did glucose, and H2O2 enhanced the damage. In cultured human cells, 8-oxodG formation increased significantly following treatment with fructose and the H2O2-generating enzyme glucose oxidase. Fructose may play an important role in oxidative DNA damage, suggesting a possible mechanism for involvement of fructose in carcinogenesis.",

Herbal medicine has provided an alternative approach to treating T2D with limited access to formal healthcare. Tectona grandis is being used traditionally in the treatment of diabetes. The present study investigated the antidiabetic potential of T. grandis leaves in different solvent extractions, and the crude extract that demonstrated the best activity was further fractionated through solvent-solvent partitioning. The ethyl acetate fraction of the ethanol crude extract showed the best antidiabetic activity in inhibiting α-glucosidase, delaying glucose absorption at the small intestine's lumen, and enhancing the muscle's postprandial glucose uptake. The ethyl acetate fraction was further elucidated for its ability to reduce hyperglycemia in diabetic rats. The ethyl acetate fraction significantly reduced high blood glucose levels in diabetic rats with concomitant modulation in stimulated insulin secretions through improved pancreatic β-cell function, insulin sensitivity by increasing liver glycogen content, and reduced elevated levels of liver glucose-6-phosphatase activity. These activities could be attributed to the phytochemical constituents of the plant.",

Therefore, we compared the effects of consuming four different sugars on insulin sensitivity indices derived from oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTT).

Outcomes were analyzed to determine: (1) effects of the five SB; (2) effects of the proportions of fructose and glucose in all SB. (3) Results: Fructose-SB and the fructose component in mixed sugars negatively affected outcomes that assess hepatic insulin sensitivity, while glucose did not. The effects of glucose-SB and the glucose component in mixed sugar on muscle insulin sensitivity were more negative than those of fructose. (4) Conclusion: the effects of consuming sugar-SB on insulin sensitivity varied depending on type of sugar and ISI index because outcomes assessing hepatic insulin sensitivity were negatively affected by fructose, and outcomes assessing muscle insulin sensitivity were more negatively affected by glucose.",

      "abstract": "Maternal nutrient intake influences the health of the offspring via microenvironmental systems in digestion and absorption. Maternal high fructose diet (HFD) impairs hippocampus-dependent memory in adult female rat offspring. However, the underlying mechanisms remain largely unclear. Maternal HFD causes microbiota dysbiosis. In this study, we find that the plasma level of butyrate, a major metabolite of microbiota, is significantly decreased in the adult female maternal HFD offspring. In these rats, GPR43, a butyrate receptor was downregulated in the hippocampus. Moreover, the expressions of mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM), and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1α (PGC-1α) were downregulated in the hippocampus. The decreases of these functional proteins were reversed by fructooligosaccharides (FOS, a probiotic) treatment in adulthood. Astrocytes are critical for energy metabolism in the brain. Primary astrocyte culture from female maternal HFD offspring indicated that GPR43 and the mitochondrial biogenesis were significantly suppressed, which was reversed by supplemental butyrate incubation. The oxygen consumption rate (OCR) was reduced in the HFD group and rescued by butyrate. Intriguingly, the nuclear histone deacetylase 4 (HDAC4) was enhanced in the HFD group, suggesting an inhibitory role of butyrate on histone deacetylase activity. Inhibition of HDAC4 effectively restored the OCR, bioenergetics, and biogenesis of mitochondria. Together, these results suggested that the impaired butyrate signaling by maternal HFD could underlie the reduced mitochondrial functions in the hippocampus via HDAC4-mediated epigenetic changes.",
