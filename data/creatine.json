      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Biallelic pathogenic variants in PGM1 result in phosphoglucomutase 1 (PGM1) deficiency that is one of the congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDG) (PGM1-CDG). Phenotypic spectrum includes congenital malformations, and muscular, cardiac, hepatic, endocrine and hematologic phenotypes. Current treatment consists of D-galactose therapy that results in clinical and biochemical improvements. To improve fatigue, and exercise intolerance, we started creatine supplementation therapy. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We reviewed electronic patient chart. We applied Nijmegen Pediatric CDG Rating Scale (NPCRS) and The Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy Fatigue scale (FACIT-F). We measured creatine metabolism biomarkers. RESULTS: This is a 29-year-old female with PGM1-CDG, confirmed diagnosis by clinical exome sequencing. She has been treated with D-galactose therapy which did not improve her fatigue and exercise intolerance. She was started on creatine supplementation therapy at the age of 27 years which led to decreased daytime sleeping, increased exercise capacity and improvements in her NPCRS, and FACIT-F. Her plasma guanidinoacetate was low. She had elevated urine galactitol on D-galactose therapy. DISCUSSION: PGM1-CDG associated myopathy is likely due to combination of several factors including abnormal muscle carbohydrate metabolism, abnormal N-glycosylation of proteins involved in the muscle functions and creatine transport and altered muscle energy homeostasis. It was previously shown that creatine supplementation therapy improves myopathy in patients with mitochondrial cytopathies. We think that the use of creatine supplementation therapy coincided with improvements in fatigue and exercise intolerance subjectively and objectively in our patient."

      "abstract": "This case report and discussion pertain to a 17-year-old female patient with developmental delay and acute onset of psychosis, diagnosed with guanidinoacetate methyltransferase (GAMT) deficiency, a rare creatine biosynthesis disorder. The patient experienced auditory hallucinations, paranoia, and delusional misidentification syndromes (Capgras syndrome and reduplicative paramnesia), following a viral respiratory illness. The neurologic examination was nonfocal but included intermittent negative myoclonus, generalized stiff movements, and a mechanical gait, which initially suggested catatonia or autoimmune encephalitis. MRI of the brain was normal, as was her CSF profile, although EEG revealed diffuse slowing with frequent generalized spike waves. Sequential empiric treatments for catatonia and autoimmune encephalitis provided limited benefit. Subsequent biochemical and genetic testing confirmed GAMT deficiency, supported by a markedly decreased creatine peak on MR spectroscopy of the brain. This case highlights GAMT deficiency as a consideration in young patients with neuropsychiatric symptoms, particularly psychosis with atypical motor findings and a history of developmental delay. The rare presentation of delusional misidentification symptoms expands the spectrum of clinical findings described in patients with GAMT deficiency, a rare disorder reported in at least 130 individuals to date. Treatment with creatine and ornithine supplementation led to marked improvement, returning her incrementally toward baseline functioning. This case broadens the understanding of GAMT deficiency's phenotypic range and underscores the importance of metabolic testing in tandem with or closely following empiric but unsuccessful treatment trials, even when the initial clinical presentation suggests primary psychiatric, autoimmune, or inflammatory etiologies.",

      "abstract": "Celastrol is widely recognized as one of the most potent anti-obesity agents, and its ability to promote adipocyte thermogenesis is thought to be a key mechanism. However, the precise molecular targets through which celastrol modulates thermogenesis in human adipocytes remain unclear. In this study, we synthesized a celastrol-based small molecular probe and employed a combination of photoaffinity labeling (PAL), click chemistry, and Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) to identify its direct binding targets. Our results reveal that celastrol directly interacts with creatine kinase B-type (CKB), leading to an increase in CKB protein stability. This suggests that celastrol modulates the futile creatine cycle within human brown adipocytes, thereby contributing to thermogenesis. Collectively, our findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms by which celastrol promotes thermogenesis in human brown adipocytes. Notably, we demonstrated that celastrol targets CKB-mediated futile creatine cycle for the first time. These findings not only deepen our understanding of celastrol's role in weight loss but also provides a potential strategy for obesity treatment."

      "abstract": "Ionizing radiation-induced intestinal injury (IRIII) is a catastrophic disease lack of sufficient medical countermeasures currently. Regulation of the gut microbiota through dietary adjustments is a potential strategy to mitigate IRIII. Time-restricted feeding (TRF) is an emerging behavioral nutrition intervention with pleiotropic health benefits. Whether this dietary pattern influences the pathogenesis of IRIII remains vague. We evaluated the impact of TRF on intestinal radiosensitivity in this study and discovered that only daytime TRF (DTRF), not nighttime TRF, could ameliorate intestinal damage in mice that received a high dose of IR. Faecal metagenomic and metabolomic studies revealed that the intestinal creatine level was increased by approximate 9 times by DTRF, to which the Bifidobacterium pseudolongum enrichment contribute. Further investigations showed that creatine could activate the energy sensor AMP-activated protein kinase in irradiated enterocytes and induce phosphorylation of acetyl-CoA carboxylase, resulting in reduced production of polyunsaturated fatty acids and reduced ferroptosis after IR. The administration of creatine mitigated IRIII and reduced bacteremia and proinflammatory responses. Blockade of creatine import compromised the ferroptosis inhibition and mitigation of DTRF on IRIII. Our study demonstrates a radioprotective dietary mode that can reshape the gut microbiota and increase intestinal creatine, which can suppress IR-induced ferroptosis, thereby providing effective countermeasures for IRIII prevention.",

      "abstract": "Local immunotherapy stimulates immune responses against tumors while avoiding adverse effects associated with systemic administration. However, current strategies for tumor-targeted in situ immunotherapy are still limited. mRNA-based gene therapy represents a promising strategy. Gasdermin E (GSDME)-mediated pyroptosis is reported to exert anti-tumor immunity. Here, we synthetized mRNA encoding GSDME encapsulated by lipid nanoparticles (LNP-Gsdme). In situ delivery of LNP-Gsdme through intratumoral injection suppressed tumor growth, boosted monocyte infiltration and activated CD8+T cells. LNP-Gsdme induced immunogenic cell death (ICD) in tumor cells, releasing creatine as a metabolic damage-associated molecular pattern. Creatine elicited cGAMP-STING-type I interferon signaling pathway in monocytes and reprogrammed intratumoral monocytes toward an immunostimulatory phenotype, consequently potentiating CD8+T cell-mediated anti-tumor immune responses. Furthermore, creatine supplementation enhanced the antitumor efficacy of LNP-Gsdme. Our study uncovers creatine as an important metabolic biomarker of pyroptosis-induced ICD in tumors, providing new insights and a promising therapeutic approach for in vivo mRNA-based immunotherapies for cancer."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND Viral infections can cause a spectrum of muscle involvement, from mild myalgia to severe conditions like rhabdomyolysis. While benign muscle pain is common, viral myositis complicated by rhabdomyolysis and acute kidney injury is an uncommon but serious occurrence. If not promptly recognized and treated, these complications can result in significant morbidity and even mortality. Timely diagnosis and intervention are crucial to mitigating the risks. CASE REPORT We present the case of a 47-year-old man with a history of recent flu-like symptoms, who developed generalized muscle pain and weakness. Upon further evaluation, he was diagnosed with acute viral myositis. His condition was complicated by severe rhabdomyolysis, as evidenced by a markedly elevated creatine phosphokinase (CPK) level of 880 300 U/L, which subsequently led to acute kidney injury. Despite immediate intervention with aggressive intravenous fluid resuscitation, he required emergency hemodialysis secondary to electrolyte imbalances. Over the course of several weeks, he required ongoing dialysis, but with continued treatment his renal function gradually improved, and dialysis was discontinued after 1 month. CONCLUSIONS This case highlights the importance of early recognition and treatment of viral myositis complicated by rhabdomyolysis and acute renal failure. Aggressive management, including fluid resuscitation and hemodialysis, is crucial in preventing life-threatening complications.",

      "abstract": "The objective of the study was to determine the effect of sex, season, and breed on creatine kinase (CK) levels, carcass, and the physicochemical properties of village chickens slaughtered using the transverse neck incision (TNI). One hundred chickens were stratified based on sex, breed, and season and were randomly assigned to different treatment groups to assess their live weight, carcass weight, meat quality, and CK levels. Results indicated that sex influenced live and carcass weights, with cocks (P < 0.05) being heavier than hens. Seasonal variations had a more significant effect on weights and meat quality, with the hot-dry season yielding the highest (P < 0.05) weights and the rainy season the lowest (P < 0.05). Seasonal changes also affected (P < 0.05) pH, meat colour, cooking loss, and drip loss, creatine kinase levels. The Leghorn chickens exhibited the highest (P < 0.05) live weight, and the Australorp had the lowest (P < 0.05). The Orpington breed produced the firmest meat (P < 0.05), whereas the Australorp yielded the tenderest. The study suggests that season and genetic factors significantly influence meat quality in village chickens. Further research is recommended into the nutritional status and muscle fibre composition to enhance meat quality. These findings offer valuable insights for improving slaughter practices and meat production in resource-limited farming systems.",

METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted on the clinical and genetic data of two children diagnosed with GAMT deficiency-type CDS at the Children's Medical Center of Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, from December 2020 to December 2024. RESULTS: The two patients presented with symptoms in infancy, and both had compound heterozygous mutations in the GAMT gene. Case 1 exhibited seizures and intellectual disability, while Case 2 had intellectual disability and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy of cranial MRI in both patients indicated reduced creatine peaks. After creatine treatment, seizures in Case 1 were controlled, but both patients continued to experience intellectual disabilities and behavioral issues. As of December 2024, a total of 21 cases have been reported in China (including this study), and 115 cases have been reported abroad. All patients exhibited developmental delay or intellectual disabilities, with 66.9% (91/136) experiencing seizures, 33.8% (46/136) presenting with motor disorders, and 36.8% (50/136) having behavioral problems. Seventy-five percent (102/136) of patients received creatine treatment, leading to significant improvements in seizures and motor disorders, although cognitive improvement was not substantial. CONCLUSIONS: GAMT deficiency-type CDS is rare and presents with nonspecific clinical features. Timely diagnosis facilitates targeted treatment, which can partially improve prognosis.",

Patient advocacy organizations are moving beyond simply supporting community members and are taking the reins to improve the speed of diagnoses, initiate therapeutic discoveries, and lay the groundwork to ensure successful clinical trials. The Association for Creatine Deficiencies (ACD) is an international parent-led patient advocacy organization focused on the three ultra-rare neurodevelopmental monogenic disorders resulting in Cerebral Creatine Deficiency Syndromes (CCDS). These include X-linked creatine transporter deficiency (CTD), guanidinoacetate methyltransferase (GAMT) deficiency, and l-arginine:glycine amidinotransferase (AGAT) deficiency. While each is rare in its own right, the unified CCDS community is effectively advancing the field of CCDS with each disorder benefiting from progress made in the other two disease areas. ACD collaborators include caregivers, academic researchers, clinicians, industry partners, and policymakers. Since its founding in 2012, the organization has evolved and achieved significant milestones. These include advancements in disease diagnosis, investments in various therapeutic modalities, creation of a collaborative research community, a unified patient community contributing essential patient data, and repositories of patient-derived specimens. The initiatives of ACD are intended to create the earliest diagnosis possible through newborn screening, to have an effective treatment, and to make disease management strategies available to all members of the CCDS community, including those diagnosed at later stages and experiencing greater effects of the diseases."

While at present there are no effective treatments available, preclinical development and testing of gene therapy and other approaches to increase brain creatine are being actively pursued. In studying a mouse model of the disorder, [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose ([18F]FDG)-based positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) was performed to assess brain glucose metabolism in wild type and creatine transporter mutant mice (Slc6a8-/y). The findings demonstrate marked differences in glucose metabolism in the brains of wild type and Slc6a8-/y mice. In conducting behavioral phenotyping studies, notable abnormalities in behavior in the murine model led to additional studies in serotonin-mediated activity. Serotonergic signaling differences were detected between wild type and Slc6a8-/y mice using 4-(2'-methoxyphenyl)-1-[2'-(N-2″-pyridinyl)-p-[18F]fluorobenzamido]ethylpiperazine ([18F]MPPF). These data demonstrate that [18F]FDG-PET and [18F]-MPPF-PET may serve as appropriate and sensitive biomarkers that could be used to assess the efficacy of not only new approaches in treating mutations of the creatine transporter SLC6A8 and their effectiveness in normalizing brain metabolism but also in enhancing our understanding of the mechanism of brain dysfunction that occurs in this complex brain disorder.",

This study determined effects of dietary supplementation of creatine (Cr) to gestating gilts on fetal development, the number and ratio of primary and secondary muscle fibers, and on protein expression in endometrium and fetal biceps-femoris muscle, respectively in fetal pigs on d 60 and d 90 of gestation. METHODS: Reproductively mature gilts were synchronized to estrus using Matrix, observed for estrus (d 0), and artificially inseminated 12 h and 36 h later. Gilts were individually housed and fed 0.86 kg of 14% crude protein diet twice daily that meets nutritional requirements for pregnant gilts. Gilts were assigned to either basal diet control (CON) group, or Cr supplemented group (provided 30 g Cr monohydrate daily) from d 10 to either d 60 or d 90 of gestation. Gilts were euthanized and hysterectomized on either d 60 or d 90 of gestation. These protocols were completed in two replicates, as gilts were bred in spring and euthanized in summer or bred in fall and euthanized in winter (n = 20 gilts/replicate). Litter size, crown-rump length, sex, and fetal weight was recorded. Three female and male fetuses closest to mean litter weight were selected to assess effects of treatment on weight of fetal brain, kidney, liver, spleen, and biceps-femoris muscle. Data were analyzed to determine effects of treatment, days of gestation, replicate, and sex on litter size, fetal measurements, and incidence of intrauterine growth restriction. RESULTS: Dietary Cr supplementation increased fetal brain weight to body weight ratios on d 90 of gestation (P < 0.05) and fetal kidney weight to body weight ratios on d 60 of gestation (P < 0.01), while days of gestation had significant effect on expression of mitochondrial CK isoform in gilt endometria (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that dietary supplementation of Cr in gestating gilts enhanced development of select fetal organs and contribute to understanding roles of the Cr-CK-PCr system in pregnancy."

      "abstract": "PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Osteosarcopenia is an age-related condition characterized by reductions in bone mineral, muscle/lean mass, strength and functional ability which increases the risk of falls, fractures, frailty and premature mortality. One main contributing factor to osteosarcopenia is malnutrition. The purpose was to review recent evidence of creatine monohydrate (CrM) supplementation in older adults and to discuss the potential to manage osteosarcopenia. RECENT FINDINGS: Accumulating research shows that CrM supplementation, primarily when combined with exercise training, has the potential to serve as a viable intervention in the management of osteosarcopenia. Collectively, CrM supplementation during exercise training in older adults led to greater improvements in whole-body lean mass, lower-limb muscle density and bone geometry and muscle strength (primarily upper-body) compared to exercise training alone. However, no study has investigated the effects of CrM, with and without exercise training, in older adults with osteosarcopenia. SUMMARY: Given the positive findings of CrM on measures of muscle and bone in healthy older adults, there is potential for CrM to be added as an adjunct to exercise training in the management of osteosarcopenia. However, randomized clinical trials are needed to confirm the safety and efficacy of this nutrient in this clinical population.",

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: Athletes often use sport supplements to improve their physical and physiological performance. This randomized, double-blind, placebo (PL) -controlled study aimed to investigate the effects of combined versus single supplementation of creatine (Cr), beta-alanine (BA), and L-citrulline (L-Cit) during short sprint interval training (SSIT) on basketball players' physical and physiological performance over a period of 28 days. METHODS: Forty-eight basketball players were equally assigned to 6 groups of Cr (0.1 g/kg of Cr monohydrate daily), BA (4.8 g daily), L-Cit (6 g daily), combined supplementation, PL, and an active control group, and each group consisted of 8 participants. The training groups participated in SSIT (3 sets of 10 repetitions of 5-s all-out runs) sessions 3 times a week for 4 weeks. Physical (vertical jump, 20-m sprint, Illinois change of direction) and physiological (Wingate anaerobic power and cardiorespiratory fitness test) performance were evaluated before and after the training period. RESULTS: All training groups (Cr, BA, L-Cit, combined, and PL) showed significant improvements in physical and physiological performance over the 4-week intervention (P < .05). Interestingly, the supplement groups displayed significantly (P = .001) greater changes than the PL group, indicating better outcomes in performance adaptations. However, significant differences in performance variables were observed among the supplement groups. CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that short-term supplementation with Cr, BA, and L-Cit, as well as a combination of them during SSIT, can significantly improve the physical and physiological performance of basketball players compared to a PL.",

HYPOTHESIS: Combined TUA and Cr will have greater effect on physiological indicators and repetitive sprint performance recovery after exhaustive exercise under hot and humid conditions than single supplementation or placebo. STUDY DESIGN: Single-blind crossover randomized controlled study. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level 2. METHODS: Participants (12 sports students) were assigned randomly to 1 of 4 supplementation intervention groups: placebo (P), taurine (T), creatine (C), or taurine + creatine (T+C). Exercise protocol included exhaustion tests and repeated sprinting exercises were conducted in a laboratory environment at 35 °C/65% relative humidity. Heartrate, blood lactate (BLa), tympanic temperature, thermal sensation, and rating of perceived exertion were monitored throughout. Heartrate variability, time to exhaustion (TTE), reaction time, and countermovement jump (CMJ) height were tracked before and after exhaustion exercise and before sprint exercise. RESULTS: TTE was significantly higher in the T+C group than in the P group (P = 0.04). BLa and tympanic temperature increased rapidly in all 4 conditions, then decreased gradually, and T group peak values were higher than those of P group (P = 0.04; P < 0.01). CMJ decreased in the C and T+C groups (P = 0.04; P = 0.04) after exhaustive exercise, unlike other groups (P > 0.05). Indicators of repeated sprint exercise, peak power, mean power, and power decrement showed a decreasing trend within groups but no difference between groups (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: In this small student group, under hot and humid conditions, T+C supplementation significantly enhanced TTE. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: TAU, Cr, and their combined supplementation do not significantly improve repeated sprint performance after exhaustive exercise under hot and humid conditions."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Birth asphyxia-induced encephalopathy is a major cause of long-term neurological morbidity, including cognitive and motor deficits. A proposed treatment is maternal creatine supplementation for prophylactic neuroprotection. This study examined how maternal creatine supplementation with or without birth asphyxia affected the behaviour of spiny mice offspring. METHODS: On day 20 of gestation (mid-gestation; term = 39 days), dams were randomly allocated to either a daily diet containing 5% w/w creatine monohydrate or remained on standard rodent chow. On gestational day 38, dams underwent either control caesarean section where offspring were delivered and recovered immediately, or birth asphyxia whereby the pregnant uterus was excised and placed in a saline bath for 7.5 min, inducing global hypoxia. All offspring were then cross-fostered to a lactating dam. Behavioural assessments were then completed on recovered offspring from neonatal to adolescent/adult ages (postnatal day [PND] 3-41) using the open-field, elevated plus maze, and novel object recognition test. RESULTS: Offspring that underwent birth asphyxia displayed locomotor deficits and increased anxiety-like behaviour at PND 3-7 in the open-field test (p < 0.05) and impaired novel object discrimination at PND 18 (p < 0.05). Antenatal creatine exposure reduced anxiety-like behaviour irrespective of asphyxia in pups at PND 3, indicating an amelioration of the asphyxia-induced anxiety-like behaviour. In adolescence/adulthood, creatine and asphyxia-exposed offspring showed reduced object exploration (p < 0.0001). Antenatal creatine led to sustained reductions in anxiety-like behaviour in the elevated plus maze at adolescence and increased body weight, regardless of birth asphyxia exposure (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Antenatal creatine exposure following maternal dietary creatine supplementation decreased anxiety-like behaviour in spiny mice offspring. This change negated behavioural abnormalities caused by birth asphyxia in the neonatal period, though it may have broader influences on long-term emotional and information processing in offspring which warrants further investigation."

After a TBI, complex biomolecular signaling, diffuse axonal stretching, and glutamate excitotoxicity occur, along with other pathological sequelae. Creatine has been shown to improve cognitive functioning in healthy adults.

This study was designed to evaluate the effect of vitamin D3 on the serum CPK level and the incidence of rhabdomyolysis-induced AKI in patients with multiple trauma. METHODS: Patients with serum CPK levels <1000 IU/L were followed as the control 1 group. Subjects with serum CPK levels ≥1000 IU/L were randomly allocated to the control 2 or intervention group at Imam Hossein Medical Center, Tehran, Iran in 2020. Patients in the intervention group received a single dose of vitamin D3 (300,000 units) on the recruitment day. The serum level of CPK was recorded every 3 days for 14 days. Parametric and non-parametric tests were used to compare the CPK values between groups. RESULTS: Forty-six patients, consisting of 16, 15, and 15 in control 1, control 2, and intervention arms of the study were recruited, respectively. Unlike control groups, the significant steadily decreasing trend was seen only in the intervention group (P<0.001). This significant decrease in the intervention arm was observed on days 5 to 7 (P=0.001) and on days 8 to 10 (P<0.001) compared to the baseline. Patients in the intervention group had a lower number of AKI or need for dialysis (P=0.869 and P=0.670 for AKI and dialysis, respectively) than control group 2, although the differences were not significant. CONCLUSION: The current study revealed that vitamin D3, could prevent the increasing trend of CPK during the first days and accelerate the normalization of CPK in patients with elevated CPK due to multiple trauma.Trial Registration Number: IRCT20120703010178N23.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND Rhabdomyolysis occurs commonly in hospitalized patients due to many etiologies. It is characterized by elevated creatine kinase, weakness, and myalgias, with severe forms causing electrolyte imbalances. However, many of these patients have a mild disease course with no symptoms. Those with more severe disease often have associated acute kidney injury. When acute kidney injury occurs solely due to rhabdomyolysis, it is unlikely to cause the patient to require renal replacement therapy. Regardless of how common this disease is, little research has been done to determine prognosticating factors for renal recovery in the patients who do require renal replacement therapy. CASE REPORT We present the case a young patient who developed severe kidney damage from rhabdomyolysis, requiring renal replacement, and who had renal recovery in a relatively short time. Our patient's maximum creatine kinase was 1 353 105 IU/L. Yet regardless of this severe elevation, his kidneys showed full recovery in under 3 weeks. CONCLUSIONS We present a case of a patient with rhabdomyolysis and CK above one million. In our literature review, we found that exertion and genetic defects were found to cause CK elevations above one hundred thousand, but infection is perhaps the most common cause of such extreme elevations. Regardless of how high CK is, there are no consistent factors reported in the literature correlating with degree of and rate of renal recovery in these patients.",

The aim was to evaluate the effectiveness of creatine supplementation in improving exercise performance in active females. A secondary aim was to appraise the quality of research in this area. Five databases were searched from the earliest record to July 2024. Eligible studies used supplemental creatine as an intervention with physically active female participants and reported an exercise performance-related outcome. Study quality was appraised using the Critical Appraisal Skills Program randomised controlled trials checklist with four additional items related to methodological considerations for research with active females. Performance outcomes were categorised as strength/power, anaerobic, or aerobic. Of the 10,563 records identified, 27 studies were included. Participant calibre ranged from recreationally active to elite. Creatine interventions ranged from five days to 12 weeks and included a range of dosage strategies. Compared to placebo, 3/11 studies showed an improvement in strength/power outcomes, 4/17 showed an improvement in anaerobic outcomes, and 1/5 showed an improvement in aerobic outcomes. Study quality varied, but methodological considerations for research with female athletes were poorly addressed by most studies. Although some benefits were reported, most studies showed no improvement in performance compared to placebo. The heterogeneity in participant characteristics, performance tests, creatine intervention, insufficient consideration of the unique physiological characteristics of females, and an overall small evidence base limits our understanding of how creatine supplementation influences physical performance in active females.",

METHODS: We conducted a search of The Cochrane Library, PubMed, EMbase, and Web of Science databases to retrieve randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on the use of creatine phosphate sodium (CPS) in the treatment of viral myocarditis. The search was conducted up to April 2024. After screening the literature, extracting data, and evaluating the risk of bias in the included studies, we performed a meta-analysis using RevMan 5.4 and Stata17.0 statistical software. RESULTS: A total of 104 articles were retrieved, and 9 articles with a combined total of 1,116 patients were ultimately included in the meta-analysis. The results of the meta-analysis indicated that the overall efficacy rate in the phosphocreatine sodium treatment group was higher than that in the control group [RR = 1.22, 95%CI (1.15, 1.28), P<0.00001]. Furthermore, post-treatment levels of cardiac troponin I [MD = 0.1, 95%CI (0.07, 0.13), P<0.00001] and creatine kinase isoenzyme [MD = 9.43, 95%CI (7.04,11 .82), P<0 .00001] in the phosphocreatine treatment group were lower compared to those in the control group; both differences between groups were statistically significant. Additionally, there was no significant difference observed in adverse reaction incidence between the phosphocreatine sodium treatment group and conventional treatment group [RR = 1 .07, 95% CI (0 .68, 1 .67), P = O .77]. CONCLUSION: Creatine phosphate sodium treatment can significantly improve the therapeutic effect of patients with viral myocarditis, and can reduce the levels of cTnI and CK-MB.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Cerebral creatine deficiency disorders (CCDD) are rare diseases caused by defects in the enzymes L-arginine: glycine amidinotransferase (AGAT) or guanidinoacetate-N-methyltransferase (GAMT), which are involved in synthesis of creatine; or by a defect in the creatine transporter (CRTR), which is essential for uptake of creatine as important energy source into the target cells. Patients with CCDD can present with a variety of unspecific symptoms: global developmental delay, speech-language disorder, behavioral abnormalities and seizures. Early treatment initiation is essential in AGAT and GAMT deficiencies to achieve a favorable outcome. This study describes the CCDD patient cohort in a single center, and an analysis of the referrals to two Swiss laboratories in Lausanne and Zurich between 2015 and 2023 for the two marker metabolites guanidinoacetate and creatine. RESULTS: The patient cohort comprised 6 patients (defects: 2 GAMT, 4 CRTR), who were initially seen by different subspecialties depending on first symptoms. There was a diagnostic and therapeutic delay between 3 and 32 months (mean 13.8). Numbers of biomarker requests showed a constant increase during the study period, with a majority of tests performed in urine, the preferred sample for CCDD detection. Almost all samples (93.3%) were sent in by large hospitals (mainly from neurology, developmental pediatrics and metabolism) and only few (5.2%) by pediatricians in private practice, although those usually see the patients first. CONCLUSIONS: The data from this study demonstrate a relevant delay in identifying patients with these rare conditions, and a predominance of biomarker analysis requested from pediatric subspecialties that are involved in patient management often long after occurrence of symptoms. To reduce the diagnostic delay and the outcome of patients, the current practice of sample referral should be reflected and first-contact healthcare providers should be encouraged to initiate selective screening."

While creatine metabolism in cancer has been studied for several decades, emerging studies are beginning to clarify the sometimes-contradictory role creatine has in either the promotion or inhibition of cancer. On one hand, creatine can directly enhance anti-tumor CD8+ T-cell activity and induce tumor apoptosis, contributing to antitumor immunity. Conversely, other studies have shown that creatine can facilitate cancer cell growth and migration by providing an energy source and activating several signaling pathways. This review will examine what is known about creatine in cancer biology, with a focus on understanding its roles across different cellular compartments. Lastly, we discuss the emerging roles of creatine metabolism, providing exciting new insights into this often-overlooked pathway. This review highlights the complex role of creatine in cancer development and treatment, offering insights into its potential as both a therapeutic target and a risk factor in oncogenesis.",

      "abstract": "This study aimed to evaluate different combinations of three dietary supplements for potential additive or synergistic effects in an in vitro Parkinson's Disease model. The complex and diverse processes leading to neurodegeneration in each patient with a neurodegenerative disorder cannot be effectively addressed by a single medication. Instead, various combinations of potentially neuroprotective agents targeting different disease mechanisms simultaneously may show improved additive or synergistic efficacy in slowing the disease progression and allowing the agents to be utilized at lower doses to minimize side effects. We evaluated four possible combinations of the three selected supplements: tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA), co-enzyme Q10 (CoQ10), and creatine, chosen for their effects on different targets that had previously shown neuroprotective effects in preclinical models. We evaluated the following combinations: (1) TUDCA+CoQ10, (2) TUDCA+Creatine, (3) CoQ10 + Creatine, and (4) TUDCA+CoQ10 + Creatine. We used induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) derived human dopaminergic neurons from a patient with Parkinson's disease and healthy control, as well as microglial cells, to evaluate for an additive or synergistic effect of these combinations on neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation. We used neurofilament heavy chain, tubulin filament, and proinflammatory cytokines as metrics. We have identified a triple combination of these supplements that showed an additive protective effect across all these endpoints. Indeed, the agents in that combination could address the majority of the known pathways leading to neurodegeneration, such as accumulation of misfolded α-synuclein, mitochondrial dysfunction, reactive oxygen species, and neuroinflammation. We demonstrated that the combination of TUDCA, CoQ10, and creatine exerts an additive effect in in vitro models of a neurodegenerative disease, surpassing the efficacy of each compound individually. This combination shows strong potential as a candidate for further preclinical confirmatory studies and clinical trials as a neuroprotective treatment for patients with, or at risk for, Parkinson's disease."

      "abstract": "Creatine monohydrate supplementation (CrM) is a safe and effective intervention for improving certain aspects of sport, exercise performance, and health across the lifespan. Despite its evidence-based pedigree, several questions and misconceptions about CrM remain. To initially address some of these concerns, our group published a narrative review in 2021 discussing the scientific evidence as to whether CrM leads to water retention and fat accumulation, is a steroid, causes hair loss, dehydration or muscle cramping, adversely affects renal and liver function, and if CrM is safe and/or effective for children, adolescents, biological females, and older adults. As a follow-up, the purpose of this paper is to evaluate additional questions and misconceptions about CrM. These include but are not limited to: 1. Can CrM provide muscle benefits without exercise? 2. Does the timing of CrM really matter? 3. Does the addition of other compounds with CrM enhance its effectiveness? 4. Does CrM and caffeine oppose each other? 5. Does CrM increase the rates of muscle protein synthesis or breakdown? 6. Is CrM an anti-inflammatory intervention? 7. Can CrM increase recovery following injury, surgery, and/or immobilization? 8. Does CrM cause cancer? 9. Will CrM increase urine production? 10. Does CrM influence blood pressure? 11. Is CrM safe to consume during pregnancy? 12. Does CrM enhance performance in adolescents? 13. Does CrM adversely affect male fertility? 14. Does the brain require a higher dose of CrM than skeletal muscle? 15. Can CrM attenuate symptoms of sleep deprivation? 16. Will CrM reduce the severity of and/or improve recovery from traumatic brain injury? Similar to our 2021 paper, an international team of creatine research experts was formed to perform a narrative review of the literature regarding CrM to formulate evidence-based responses to the aforementioned misconceptions involving CrM.",

Expensive second-line treatments are then prescribed, causing a burden on the health system. Previous research showed that creatine supplementation may be a relatively inexpensive, safe, and effective way to mitigate statin toxicity to the muscle. Methods. We thus investigated the tolerability and effectiveness of creatine supplementation in consecutive patients with statin myopathy, as observed at our Cardiology or Neurology outpatient services for previous cardiac or cerebral ischemic disease. Results. We confirmed previous findings showing that creatine supplementation is safe and well tolerated even in this elderly population. Eleven of the thirteen enrolled patients completed the study, and only one patient interrupted the study because of a creatine-related issue (elevation of serum creatinine). Creatine supplementation significantly reduced the Shewmon and Craig's \"myopathy score\", while it did not reduce serum creatine kinase (CK), a marker of muscle structural damage. Notably, creatine supplementation was effective at a dose of 1 g. t.i.d., lower than usually prescribed in the international literature and within the recommendations of health agencies like the Italian Ministry of Health. Conclusion. Creatine supplementation may improve statin myopathy in its milder and/or earlier form when serum CK is not elevated. Since creatine is relatively inexpensive, its supplementation may be used instead of switching from statins to the very expensive second-line anti-cholesterol treatments."

This study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial evaluating the effectiveness of creatine supplementation for older people during seven days of hospitalization for stroke compared to usual care. METHOD: The primary outcome measures were changes in functional capacity, strength, muscle mass, and muscle degradation. The secondary outcomes were changes in serum biomarkers related to inflammation, fibrosis, anabolism, and muscle synthesis. In addition, a follow-up 90 days after the stroke verified functional capacity, strength, quality of life, and mortality. Following admission for an acute stroke, participants received either creatine (10 g) or a visually identical placebo (10 g) orally twice daily. Both groups received supplementation with protein to achieve the goal of 1.5 g of protein/kg of body weight/day and underwent daily mobility training during seven days of hospitalization. RESULTS: Thirty older people were included in two similar groups concerning baseline attributes (15-treatment/15-placebo). CONCLUSIONS: Creatine supplementation did not influence functional capacity, strength, or muscle mass during the first 7 days or outcomes 90 days after stroke. There were no serious adverse events associated with creatine supplementation. However, it decreased progranulin levels, raising a new possibility of creatine action. This finding needs further exploration to understand the biological significance of creatine-progranulin interaction.",

This study demonstrates that creatine (CR) induces M2 polarization of peritoneal macrophages, promoting angiogenesis, fibrogenesis and lesion progression in EM, offering new insight into potential therapeutic strategies. ABSTRACT: EM is a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by the growth of endometrium-like tissues outside the uterine cavity, with an unclear pathogenesis. The analysis of single-cell sequencing data revealed the pivotal role of peritoneal macrophages in the development of EM. We noted significant CR enrichment and synthesis in peritoneal macrophages of patients with EM compared with women without EM. To further investigate the mechanisms of CR in EM, we performed RNA sequencing and in vitro experiments. We found that CR reprograms M2 polarization by enhancing matrix metalloproteinases and anti-inflammatory cytokines, which are involved in angiogenesis, fibrogenesis, cell adhesion and tissue repair. The coculture of CR-treated macrophages promoted the migration and fibrogenesis of endometrial stromal cells, as well as the angiogenesis of HUVECs in vitro. In summary, this article reveals that CR might polarize M2 macrophages, promoting the initiation, fibrosis and angiogenesis of ectopic endometrial lesions, ultimately resulting in the development of EM. These findings underscore the crucial immunomodulatory role of CR in the pathogenesis of EM, offering a promising target for therapeutic intervention.",

Major clinical features include developmental delay and epilepsy. To date, fewer than 200 individuals with CRTR-D have been reported. As a result, there is little evidence for effective treatment. Available therapies are creatine precursors, with a mild effect on disease progression. Concerning epilepsy, standard management is recommended and no specific anti-seizure medication (ASM) has been shown to be effective in refractory cases. We report the case of a 28-year-old male patient with CRTR-D and childhood-onset refractory epilepsy. He had an average of 10-20 focal motor seizures with impaired consciousness per month. He had tried several ASMs without significant improvement. Treatment with cannabidiol (CBD) and clobazam (CLB) in combination was added. The patient became seizure-free from the first week, and up to 1 year of follow-up. Behavioral improvement was also noted by his caregivers. No adverse effects were reported. Very few cases of CRTR-D with refractory epilepsy have been reported. This calls for more extensive research and suggests a possible role for CBD in cerebral creatine metabolism and transport and valuable option for future studies. PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY: Creatine transporter deficiency (CRTR-D) is a rare genetic disorder causing mental, behavioral, and movement problems. More than half of patients also have seizures, but because there are fewer than 200 known cases, it is difficult to know the best treatment options. We present a 28-year-old man with CRTR-D who had severe developmental delays and frequent seizures since childhood, despite trying many medications. After starting cannabidiol and clobazam, he has been seizure-free for a year. Sharing this success might help other people with CRTR-D benefit from similar treatments.",

METHODS: A single-center retrospective analysis was performed on 552 acute AD (type A 329 patients, type B 223 patients). Outcomes were the incidence of in-hospital all-cause mortality. Kaplan-Meier curve was used to compare the all-cause death risk in two groups (normal CK-MB group and elevated CK-MB group). The Cox regression model and restricted cubic splines (RCS) were conducted to assess the relationship between CK-MB and outcomes. Stratified analysis was performed based on gender, age (<50 years or ≥ 50 years), and surgery or endovascular therapy. RESULTS: The Kaplan-Meier curves showed statistically significant differences in outcomes among the different CK-MB level groups for both acute type A and type B AD patients. Cox regression analysis revealed that the in-hospital mortality risk was significantly high in the elevated CK-MB groups for both acute type A and type B AD patients. The RCS curve revealed that CK-MB was non-linearly and J-shaped correlated with in-hospital all-cause mortality for acute type A AD patients, and linearly correlated with in-hospital all-cause mortality for acute type B AD patients. CONCLUSION: Baseline CK-MB elevations were associated with an increased risk of in-hospital all-cause mortality in acute type A and type B AD patients, and it was independently associated with poor prognosis in type A patients."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) is a major cause of perinatal brain injury. Creatine is a dietary supplement that can increase intracellular phosphocreatine to improve the provision of intracellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to meet the increase in metabolic demand of oxygen deprivation. Here, we assessed prophylactic fetal creatine supplementation in reducing acute asphyxia-induced seizures, disordered electroencephalography (EEG) activity and cerebral inflammation and cell death histopathology. METHODS: Fetal sheep (118 ± 1 days' gestational age [dGA]; 0.8 gestation) were implanted with electrodes to continuously record EEG and nuchal electromyogram activity. At 121 dGA, fetuses were randomly assigned to sham control (i.v. saline infusion without umbilical cord occlusion [UCO]; SalCon), continuous i.v. creatine infusion (6 mg/kg/h; CrUCO) or isovolumetric saline (SalUCO) followed by UCO at 128 ± 2 dGA that lasted until the mean arterial blood pressure reached 19 mmHg. Brain tissue was collected for histopathology after 72 hours of recovery. RESULTS: Creatine supplementation had no effects on basal systemic or neurological physiology. UCO duration did not differ between CrUCO and SalUCO. After reperfusion, CrUCO fetuses had improved EEG power and frequency recovery and reduced electrographic seizure incidence (SalUCO, 86% vs CrUCO, 29%) and burden. At 72 hours after UCO, cell death in the cerebral cortex and astrogliosis in the periventricular white matter were reduced in CrUCO fetuses compared with SalUCO. INTERPRETATION: Creatine supplementation reduced post-asphyxial seizures and improved EEG recovery. Improvements in functional recovery with creatine were associated with regional reductions in cell death and astrogliosis. Prophylactic creatine treatment has the potential to mitigate functional indices of HIE in the late gestation fetal brain. ANN NEUROL 2025;97:673-687.",

Probiotics may improve muscle function through gut-muscle axis, but their efficacy and mechanisms in treating sarcopenia remain unclear. This study investigated the impact of Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis Probio-M8 (Probio-M8) on old mice and sarcopenia patients. We analyzed 43 subjects, including gut microbiome, fecal metabolome, and serum metabolome, using a multi-omics approach to assess whether Probio-M8 can improve sarcopenia by modulating gut microbial metabolites. Probio-M8 significantly improved muscle function in aged mice and enhanced physical performance in sarcopenia patients. It reduced pathogenic gut species and increased beneficial metabolites such as indole-3-lactic acid, acetoacetic acid, and creatine. Mediating effect analyses revealed that Probio-M8 effectively reduced n-dodecanoyl-L-homoserine lactone level in gut concurrent with increased creatine circulation, to significantly enhance host physical properties. These findings provide new insights into probiotics as a potential treatment for sarcopenia by modulating gut microbiota metabolism.",

Therefore, we first proposed to reboot mitochondrial energy metabolism to treat IBD by capturing the double-sided factor of ROS and creatine (Cr)-assisted energy adjustment. Herein, an oral Cr-modified selenium-based hyaluronic acid (HA) nanogel (HASe-Cr nanogel) was fabricated for treatment of IBD, through ROS elimination and energy metabolism upgradation. More concretely, due to IBD lesion-specific positive charge and the high expression of CD44, HASe-Cr nanogel exhibited dual targeted inflammatory bio-functions, and ROS-driven degradation properties in high-yield ROS levels in inflammation areas. As expected, multifunctional HASe-Cr nanogel could effectively ameliorate IBD-related symptoms, such as mitochondrial biological function restoration, inhibition of M1-like macrophage polarization, gut mucosal reconstruction, microbial ecological repair, etc., thus excellently treating IBD. Overall, the proposed strategy underlined that the great potentiality of HASe-Cr nanogel by restarting mitochondrial metabolic energy in colitis lesions, providing new a pavement of mitochondrion-mediated colitis treatment in clinical applications.",

However, the potential effects of this combination on brain oxygenation in humans remain unknown. Aim: The primary objective of this randomized controlled pilot trial was to assess cerebral blood oxygenation indices following a 7-day administration of a mixture containing creatine and GAA in healthy adults. Methods: Nineteen apparently healthy young adults (mean age 21.2 ± 0.4 years; 9 females) were randomly assigned to receive either a mixture (consisting of 2 g of creatine and 2 g of GAA) or a placebo in a crossover design. Oxygen saturation (SpO2) and hemoglobin index (tHb) in the prefrontal cortex were assessed at rest (REST), during meditation that focused on mindful breathing (MED), during a three-component cognitive task (TASK), and during a post-task recovery (REC) before and after 7 days of supplementation. Results: Two-way ANOVA with repeated measures revealed statistically significant differences (treatment vs. time interaction) between interventions for SpO2 during the REST (F = 5.733, P = 0.028), MED (F = 5.897, P = 0.026), and REC phases (F = 6.715, P = 0.018), indicating that the creatine-GAA mixture was more effective than placebo in enhancing oxygen saturation in the prefrontal brain both before, during, and after a cognitive task. Conclusion: These promising findings are of considerable interest for nutritional neuroscience but require validation through well-designed longitudinal trials with larger sample sizes. The study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT06371651)."

      "abstract": "Following an application from Alzchem Trostberg GmbH, submitted for authorisation of a health claim pursuant to Article 13(5) of Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006 via the Competent Authority of Austria, the EFSA Panel on Nutrition, Novel Foods and Food Allergens (NDA) was asked to deliver an opinion on the scientific substantiation of a health claim related to creatine and improvement in cognitive function. The Panel considers that the food constituent, creatine, is sufficiently characterised. An improvement in cognitive function in one or more of its domains is a beneficial physiological effect. The applicant identified 21 human intervention studies on creatine supplementation and measures of cognitive function through a literature search. Two additional studies published after the search was conducted were identified through the reference list of a meta-analysis. In weighing the evidence, the Panel took into account that the acute effect of creatine on working memory, observed in two studies at 20 g/day for 5-7 days, was not seen at lower doses (2.2-14 g/day), or with continuous consumption (5 g/day for 6 weeks following a 5-day loading phase). Furthermore, the effect on response inhibition at 20 g/day for 7 days was an isolated finding among 10 intervention studies in healthy individuals, with no effects observed on other cognitive domains. The Panel also considered that the three intervention studies conducted in diseased individuals do not support an effect of creatine supplementation on cognition, and that the available evidence for a mechanism by which creatine could exert the claimed effect is weak. The Panel concludes that a cause-and-effect relationship has not been established between creatine supplementation and an improvement in cognitive function in one or more of its domains."

Methods: The clinical data (clinical presentation, brain imaging, creatine metabolism test and gene variants) of 5 patients admitted to Beijing Children's Hospital, Capital Medical University and diagnosed with CRTR deficiency associated with SLC6A8 gene variants from January 2016 to June 2024 were retrospectively analyzed. Results: A total of 5 patients, all male, presented with the onset of the disease at 1 year and 1 month old to 1 year and 10 months old, and diagnosis at 1 year and 3 months to 9 years old. All patients exhibited varying degrees of intellectual and physical developmental deficits, with autistic-like behaviors present in 2 patients and convulsive episodes present in 4 patients. The brain magnetic resonance imaging, of all 5 patients showed either poor or slightly delayed myelination. Additionally, the brain magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) imaging of 5 patients all showed decreased creatine peaks, and 4 patients had elevated urinary creatine levels indicated by blood and (or) urine creatine metabolism tests. There were 3 patients completed blood creatinine tests, all indicating reduction. Whole-exome sequencing was conducted on all 5 patients, and 4 unreported novel variants were identified: c.371G>C, c.1017-1G>A, c.912+1G>T and c.1016+2T>A. Following treatment with creatine, arginine, and glycine supplementation, no significant advancement was observed in motor and language development. Conclusions: CRTR deficiency associated with SLC6A8 gene variants manifests as developmental delay with or without seizures, with atypical clinical features, the presence of decreased blood creatinine levels and elevated urinary creatine levels. Combined with brain MRS and genetic testing results, patients can be diagnosed.",

      "abstract": "Depression, affecting millions of people worldwide, is a leading cause of disability globally. It affects not only daily functioning but also interpersonal relationships and overall health by increasing the risks of chronic physical and mental illnesses. Creatine, traditionally recognized for boosting physical performance through its role in producing adenosine triphosphate, has recently shown potential as an adjunctive therapy for treating depression. Creatine's ability to enhance brain energy metabolisms and provide neuroprotection suggests that it can alleviate mood disorders by improving mitochondrial function, increasing cellular resilience, and modulating neurotransmitter systems that regulate mood. This narrative review aims to critically evaluate the research on creatine supplementation for depression, focusing on its efficacy, mechanism of action, risks, and benefits as a treatment for mood disorders. It analyzes preclinical and clinical studies to understand creatine's potential as an adjunctive or alternative therapy for major depressive disorder and bipolar depression and underscores any gaps in current research. Both animal models and human trials indicate creatine's efficacy for the treatment of depression. Creatine supplementation reduces depressive symptoms, particularly when combined with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, and may improve brain energy metabolism and neuroplasticity. It is generally well tolerated, though caution is warranted due to potential side effects such as manic episodes in bipolar disorder and renal function impairment in patients with kidney dysfunction. Overall, creatine presents a promising addition to current depression treatments, though further research is needed to establish optimal dosing, long-term efficacy, and safety across diverse patient populations."

However, these therapies can cause immune-related adverse events (irAEs), including myositis, a rare but significant complication characterized by elevated creatine kinase (CK) and muscle weakness. We present the case of a 79-year-old male with a history of metastatic melanoma to the brain, previously treated with nivolumab and ipilimumab, who was admitted after an unwitnessed fall. Initial laboratory tests revealed significantly elevated CK levels (5277 U/L) and mildly elevated liver function tests (LFTs). Despite the absence of muscle pain or weakness upon presentation, the patient developed proximal muscle weakness and myalgias during hospitalization. Extensive workup, including negative autoimmune panels and imaging, raised suspicion of immune-related myositis given the recent ICI therapy. The patient was treated with prednisone, which resulted in a rapid decrease in CK levels and improvement of symptoms, supporting the diagnosis of ICI-related myositis."

Here, we use saturation transfer (ST) MRI via relayed nuclear Overhauser effects (glycoNOE) to detect abnormal changes in muscle glycogen of a GSD II mouse model. In addition to glycogen, the energy metabolites phosphocreatine (PCr) and creatine (Cr) were studied to assess the muscle disease. METHODS: Water saturation (Z-spectra) and 1H MRS were acquired at 9.4 T on the skeletal muscle of healthy control mice and homozygous acid  α $$ \\upalpha $$  -glucosidase (GAA) knock-out mice (ages of 2-48 weeks). The glycoNOE (-1 ppm), total creatine (tCr)* (+2 ppm, = a × [Cr] + b × [PCr]), and PCr (+2.5 ppm) from Z-spectra and the ratio between tCr and taurine signals (tCr/Tau) from 1H MRS spectra were quantified by using multi-pool Lorentzian fitting methods. The concentrations of the metabolites were also measured via tissue assays. RESULTS: The postnatal GSD II mice (age <12 weeks) showed a continued accumulation of muscle glycoNOE signal. GlycoNOE in adult GSD II mice (age ≥12 weeks) reached a plateau, at a level above 400% of that in normal mice. PCr, tCr*, and tCr/Tau gradually decreased in GSD II mice during the postnatal stage, then stabilized at levels comparable to adult control, yet PCr in adult GSD II mice was lower than that in controls. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that ST MRI of glycogen can provide in situ non-invasive biomarkers for GSD II disease progression, with the potential to study the progression and treatment response of GSDs.",

One potential intervention which has received much 'hype' over the past few decades to countermeasure these negative consequences of biological aging is creatine monohydrate supplementation. RECENT FINDINGS: From a skeletal muscle perspective, the combination of creatine monohydrate supplementation and resistance training provides 'hope' for older adults as it improves measures of lean mass, regional (limb) muscle thickness, upper- and lower-body muscle strength and functional ability. Further, there is some evidence that creatine (supplementation or habitual diet) provides a ray of 'hope' for improving some aspects of cognitive function. The majority of research suggests that creatine is more 'hype' than 'hope' for improving measures of bone mass in older adults. Creatine monohydrate supplementation provides some anti-sarcopenic benefits for older adults.",

PATIENTS AND METHODS: A multicenter database of JAK inhibitor and IL-6 inhibitor treatment was retrospectively searched between January 2016 to December 2022; 142 cases (117 females, 25 males, mean age: 63.8±13.0 years; range, 20 to 85 years), with 71 cases in each group, were extracted by propensity score matching using age, sex, body mass index, and CK at 0 weeks. The outlier rate was compared. Patients' background characteristics related to elevated CK levels at 24 weeks were investigated by univariate and multivariate analyses. RESULTS: Creatine kinase levels at 4 and 12 weeks were significantly higher with JAK inhibitors than with IL-6 inhibitors (four weeks, 72 vs. 87.5 IU/mL, p=0.016; 12 weeks, 71 vs. 95.5 IU/mL, p=0.028). The outlier rate (Grade 1) with JAK inhibitors increased significantly over time (0 weeks, 4.2%; four weeks, 18.1%; 12 weeks, 21.7%; 24 weeks, 18.3%; p=0.015), whereas that with IL-6 inhibitors increased slightly (0 weeks, 5.6%; four weeks, 9.2%; 12 weeks, 8.6%; 24 weeks, 8.5%; p=0.745), with a significant difference between the groups (p=0.035). No patients discontinued treatment due to myalgia or renal dysfunction. The factors significantly positively related to elevated CK levels at 24 weeks were male sex and creatinine. Those significantly negatively related were Steinbrocker stage and class, modified health assessment questionnaire scores, estimated glomerular filtration rate, and glucocorticoid dose. CONCLUSION: Mild CK elevations with JAK inhibitors are not a particular clinical problem. CK elevation might be specific to JAK inhibitors."

      "abstract": "Creatine transporter deficiency (CTD) is an inborn error of creatine (Cr) metabolism in which Cr is not properly distributed to the brain due to a mutation in the Cr transporter (CrT) SLC6A8 gene. CTD is associated with developmental delays and with neurological disability in children. Dodecyl creatine ester (DCE), as a Cr prodrug, is a promising drug to treat CTD after administration by the nasal route, taking advantage of the nose-to-brain pathway. In this study, the potential adaptive response to energy imbalance in glucose metabolism was investigated in CTD using both SLC6A8-deficient mice (CrT KO) and brain organoids derived from CTD patient cells. Longitudinal brain [18F]FDG PET imaging in CrT KO mice compared to wild-type mice demonstrated that CTD was associated with a significant loss and decline in brain glucose metabolism. In CrT KO mice, intranasal supplementation with DCE for a month significantly mitigated the decline in brain glucose metabolism compared to untreated (vehicle) animals. Mechanistic investigations in CrT KO mice and cerebral organoids derived from CTD patient cells suggest that intracellular trafficking of glucose transporter (Glut) may be altered by lack of activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). Consistency between observations in the CrT KO mouse model and cerebral organoids derived from CTD patient cells supports the value of this new model for drug discovery and development. In addition, these results suggest that [18F]FDG PET imaging may offer a unique and minimally-invasive biomarker to monitor the impact of investigational treatment on CTD pathophysiology, with translational perspectives.",

For the primary efficacy outcome of change in Patient Health Questionnaire-9 depression score at study endpoint, we used mixed-model repeated measures analysis of covariance. Logistic regressions were employed to assess acceptability (any-cause dropouts), tolerability (dropouts for adverse events), and safety (patients experiencing one or more adverse events). We calculated effect sizes adjusted for age, sex, and baseline depression score. One-hundred participants (50 females, mean age= 30.4 ± 7.4 years) with depression (mean PHQ-9 = 17.6 ± 6.3) were randomised to either creatine+CBT (N = 50) or placebo+CBT (N = 50). At 8 weeks, PHQ-9 scores were lower in both study arms, but significantly more so in participants taking creatine (mean difference= -5.12). Treatment discontinuations due to any cause and to adverse events, and proportion of participants with at least one adverse event were comparable between study arms. This hypothesis-generating trial suggests that creatine could be a useful and safe supplement to CBT for depression. Longer and larger clinical trials are warranted.",

      "abstract": "Molecular targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have produced unprecedented treatment response in cancer therapy for patients harboring specific oncogenic mutations. While the TKIs are mostly well tolerated, they were reported to increase serum levels of creatine kinase (CK) and cause muscle metabolism-related toxicity. CK is an essential enzyme involved in cellular energy metabolism and muscle function. Elevated serum CK levels can arise from both physiological and pathological factors, as well as triggered by specific drug classes. The incidence of serum CK elevation induced by a few approved TKIs (brigatinib, binimetinib, cobimetinib-vemurafenib combination [Food and Drug Administration, United States]; aumolertinib, and sunvozertinib [only approved by National Medical Products Administration, China]) were over 35%. CK elevation-related symptoms include myopathy, myositis, inclusion body myositis (IBM), cardiotoxicity, rhabdomyolysis, rash, and acneiform dermatitis. High-level or severe symptomatic CK elevation may necessitate dose reduction and indirectly dampen TKI efficacy. This review presents an updated summary about the prevalence rate and recent research about mechanisms leading to TKI-induced serum CK elevation in cancer patients. The utility of monitoring serum CK levels for predicting TKI-induced adverse effects and their management will also be discussed.",

Twenty-three apparently healthy young adults (mean age: 21.4 ± 0.6 years; 10 females) were randomly assigned to receive either a mixture (consisting of 2 g of creatine monohydrate and 2 g of GAA) or an equimolar amount of creatine monohydrate in a pretest-posttest control group experimental crossover design. After the intervention period, participants entered a 2-week washout phase to minimize any residual effects of the treatment. Body composition was assessed using a multifrequency bioelectrical impedance analysis at baseline (preadministration) and at the 7-day follow-up (postadministration). A significant interaction effect was found for extracellular mass (p=0.009), with creatine-GAA outperforming creatine in augmenting extracellular mass across the whole sample. In the male subsample, creatine was superior to the mixture in increasing intracellular water (p=0.049), whereas the mixture increased extracellular mass, contrasting with the reduction observed with creatine alone (p=0.008). No significant differences between interventions were reported in the female subsample (p > 0.05), indicating that adding GAA to creatine may produce unique, sex-specific effects on body composition. Further studies are needed to validate our findings across different demographic cohorts and various interventional regimens."

However, PD-1 inhibitors are associated with immune-related adverse events, some of which are rare and potentially life-threatening. Thus far, elevated creatine kinase (CK) and creatinine caused by a novel PD-1 inhibitor (sintilimab)-induced hypothyroidism has not yet been reported. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 63-year-old male patient with esophageal cancer who developed hypothyroidism accompanied by unexplained increases in CK and creatinine after sintilimab treatment. DIAGNOSIS: Since the increases in CK and creatinine paralleled the decrease in thyroxine, after excluding other potential conditions, we speculated that the muscular and renal dysfunction might be caused by sintilimab-induced hypothyroidism. INTERVENTIONS AND OUTCOMES: As the patient's thyroid function improved with levothyroxine replacement therapy, the levels of CK and creatinine concomitantly returned to normal. CONCLUSION AND LESSONS: The elevated CK and creatinine levels in this patient were caused by sintilimab-induced hypothyroidism. Our case highlights the importance of keeping PD-1 induced hypothyroidism in mind when patients present with unexplained increased levels of CK and creatinine. Hypothyroidism-related muscular and renal dysfunctions, which can be restored with thyroid hormone replacement, need to be identified early and treated promptly so that unnecessary examinations and treatments can be avoided in these patients.",

      "abstract": "Cerebral creatine deficiency syndromes (CCDS) are rare inherited metabolic disorders caused by defective biosynthesis or transport of creatine. These conditions are characterized by reduced accumulation of creatine in the brain, mild to severe intellectual disability, global developmental delay, and speech-language disorders. The amount of brain creatine reduction needed to cause symptoms is not known. Here we report a new patient with creatine transporter deficiency (CTD) who presented at 15 months of age with seizures and global delays with no speech at 3 years of age. Brain MRI was normal, but brain MRS indicated creatine levels reduced to about 20 % of normal. He had normal levels of creatine and guanidinoacetate in plasma, but increased creatine/creatinine ratio in urine. DNA sequencing identified a hemizygous c.832C > T (p.Arg278Cys) variant in the creatine transporter gene SLC6A8. Fibroblasts from this patient had about 25 % of normal creatine transport activity, a value much higher than that measured in patients whose variants introduced premature stop codons in SLC6A8. The child was started on supplements of creatine, glycine, and arginine. His speech improved dramatically, and he had no more seizures, even during episodes of fever. Despite the clinical improvement, a repeat MRS demonstrated similar levels of brain creatine. This study suggests that a reduction in creatine transporter activity to 25 % or less is sufficient to cause symptoms of brain creatine deficiency and that functionally milder forms of CTD might respond to supplements aimed at replenishing brain creatine.",

      "abstract": "Mutations in creatine transporter SLC6A8 cause creatine transporter deficiency (CTD), which is responsible for 2% of all cases of X-linked intellectual disability. CTD has no current treatments and has a high unmet medical need. Inspired by the transformational therapeutic impact of small molecule \"correctors\" for the treatment of cystic fibrosis, which bind to mutated versions of the CFTR ion channel to promote its trafficking to the cell surface, we sought to identify small molecules that could stabilize SLC6A8 as a potential treatment for CTD. We leveraged a novel chemoproteomic technology for ligand discovery, reactive affinity probe interaction discovery, to identify small-molecule fragments with photoaffinity handles that bind to SLC6A8 in a cellular environment. We synthesized a library of irreversible covalent analogs of these molecules to characterize in functional assays, which revealed molecules that could promote the trafficking of mutant SLC6A8 variants to the cell surface. Further medicinal chemistry was able to identify reversible drug-like small molecules that both promoted trafficking of the transporter and also rescued creatine uptake. When profiled across the 27 most prevalent SLC6A8 missense variants, we found that 10-20% of patient mutations were amenable to correction by our molecules. These results were verified in an endogenous setting using the CRISPR knock-in of selected missense alleles. We established in vivo proof-of-mechanism for correctors in a novel CTD mouse model with the P544L patient-defined variant knocked in to the SLC6A8 locus, where treatment with our orally bioavailable and brain penetrant tool corrector increased brain creatine levels in heterozygous female mice, validating correctors as a potential therapeutic approach for CTD.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) is a chronic medical condition with no specific pharmacological treatment. Creatine, a nutrient essential for maintaining energy homeostasis in the cells, is a candidate for interventions in ME/CFS. METHODS: Fourteen participants with ME/CFS received supplementation with 16 g creatine monohydrate for 6 weeks. Before starting creatine and on the last day of treatment, participants underwent brain magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) scanning of the pregenual anterior cingulate cortex (pgACC) and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), followed by symptom, cognition, and hand-grip strength assessments. RESULTS: Eleven participants completed the study. Creatine treatment increased creatine concentration in both the pgACC and DLPFC (p = 0.004 and 0.012, respectively), decreased fatigue and reaction time (RT) on congruent and incongruent trials of the Stroop test (p = 0.036 and 0.014, respectively), and increased hand-grip strength (p = 0.0004). There was a positive correlation between increases in pgACC creatine and changes in RT on Stroop congruent and incongruent trials (p = 0.048 and p = 0.022, respectively). Creatine was well tolerated, and none of the participants stopped treatment. CONCLUSION: Creatine supplementation over six weeks in ME/CFS patients increased brain creatine and improved fatigue and some aspects of cognition. Despite its methodological limitations, this study encourages placebo-controlled investigations of creatine treatment in ME/CFS.",

      "abstract": "Increased plasma creatine concentrations are associated with the risk of type 2 diabetes, but whether this alteration is associated with or causal for impairments in metabolism remains unexplored. Because skeletal muscle is the main disposal site of both creatine and glucose, we investigated the role of intramuscular creatine metabolism in the pathophysiology of insulin resistance in type 2 diabetes. In men with type 2 diabetes, plasma creatine concentrations were increased, and intramuscular phosphocreatine content was reduced. These alterations were coupled to reduced expression of sarcomeric mitochondrial creatine kinase 2 (CKMT2). In C57BL/6 mice fed a high-fat diet, neither supplementation with creatine for 2 weeks nor treatment with the creatine analog β-GPA for 1 week induced changes in glucose tolerance, suggesting that increased circulating creatine was associated with insulin resistance rather than causing it. In C2C12 myotubes, silencing Ckmt2 using small interfering RNA reduced mitochondrial respiration, membrane potential, and glucose oxidation. Electroporation-mediated overexpression of Ckmt2 in skeletal muscle of high-fat diet-fed male mice increased mitochondrial respiration, independent of creatine availability. Given that overexpression of Ckmt2 improved mitochondrial function, we explored whether exercise regulates CKMT2 expression. Analysis of public data revealed that CKMT2 content was up-regulated by exercise training in both humans and mice. We reveal a previously underappreciated role of CKMT2 in mitochondrial homeostasis beyond its function for creatine phosphorylation, independent of insulin action. Collectively, our data provide functional evidence for how CKMT2 mediates mitochondrial dysfunction associated with type 2 diabetes.",

Unfortunately, patient and caregiver perspectives have historically been overlooked in the COS development process, thus limiting their input into the outcome selection. We partnered with caregivers and health professionals to establish the first COS for CTD and GAMT. The COS developed includes seven outcomes (\"Adaptive Functioning\", \"Cognitive Functioning\", \"Emotional Dysregulation\", \"MRS Brain Creatine\", \"Seizure/Convulsions\", \"Expressive Communication\", and \"Fine Motor Functions\") for both CTD and GAMT, and an additional outcome for GAMT (\"Serum/Plasma Guanidinoacetate\") that are important to stakeholders and consequently should be considered for measurement in every clinical trial. Caregivers were valued partners throughout the COS development process, which increased community engagement and facilitated caregiver empowerment. We expect this COS will ensure a patient-centered approach for accelerating drug development for CTD and GAMT, make clinical trial results comparable, minimize bias in clinical trial outcome selection, and promote efficient use of resources."

Resistance exercise alone can counteract these changes; however, it is unknown if the addition of creatine supplementation can further protect against these ADT-induced toxicities. We compared the effects of creatine supplementation with resistance exercise versus resistance exercise alone in patients with prostate cancer undergoing ADT on LM, muscle strength, and physical function. DESIGN: A 12-week randomized trial. METHODS: Men with prostate cancer receiving ADT (n = 30) were randomized to either resistance exercise + placebo (PLA) or resistance exercise + creatine (SUPP), with both groups undertaking supervised exercise 3 days per week. Outcomes included whole body and appendicular LM and fat mass (FM) assessed by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, as well as muscle strength (chest press, seated low, leg press), and physical function (timed up-and-go, chair rise, 400-m walk) assessed at baseline and following the intervention. RESULTS: Patients were aged 59-84 years with a BMI of 28.6 kg·m-2. PLA completed a mean of 30 sessions (83 %) and SUPP a mean of 33 sessions (92 %). Despite similar within-group improvements (p < 0.05) in whole-body LM (PLA +0.6 kg, SUPP +1.3 kg), appendicular LM (PLA +0.5 kg, SUPP +0.6 kg), muscle strength (PLA +8.8-49.3 kg, SUPP +9.4-40.4 kg) and physical function, there were no between group differences (p = 0.078-0.951). No adverse events were reported due to creatine supplementation or resistance exercise. CONCLUSIONS: A short-term program of resistance exercise alone results in meaningful improvements in LM, muscle strength and physical function, with no additional effects of creatine supplementation.",

The underlying mechanisms are unknown, and no treatment has been curative. Using a recently developed creatine kinase inhibitor (CKi), we explored the role of this inhibitor on GBM biology in vitro. While CKi minimally impacted GBM cell proliferation and viability, it significantly affected migration. In established GBM cell lines and patient-derived xenografts, CKi ablated both the migration and invasion of GBM cells. CKi also hindered radiation-induced migration. RNA-seq revealed a decrease in invasion-related genes, with an unexpected increase in glutathione metabolism and ferroptosis protection genes post-CKi treatment. The effects of CKi could be reversed by the addition of cell-permeable glutathione. Carbon-13 metabolite tracing indicated heightened glutathione biosynthesis post-CKi treatment. Combinatorial CKi blockade and glutathione inhibition or ferroptosis activation abrogated cell survival. Our data demonstrated that CKi perturbs promigratory and anti-ferroptotic roles in GBM, identifying the creatine kinase axis as a druggable target for GBM treatment.",

METHODS: The serum cTnI and CK-MB concentrations of 292 children with critically ill children without primary cardiac disease in Yantai Yuhuangding Hospital between January 2021 and January 2024 were retrospectively analyzed within 24 h after entering the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU). The children were divided into normal and abnormal groups according to the myocardial marker results. The abnormal group was further divided into the cTnI-elevated, CK-MB-elevated, single-elevated (cTnI- or CK-MB-elevated) and double-elevated (cTnI- and CK-MB-elevated) groups. The differences in the clinical indicators and their relationships with prognosis for the groups were compared. RESULTS: The incidence of myocardial injury among the critically ill children without primary cardiac disease was 55.1%. The incidence of myocardial injury in children with infectious diarrhea combined with moderate and severe dehydration reached 85.19%. The pediatric critical illness score; frequency of use of vasoactive drugs; hypotension, shock, heart failure, respiratory failure, and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome; and mortality indexes differed significantly for the normal and abnormal myocardial marker groups (P < 0.05). The single-elevated and normal groups only showed a difference in mortality (P < 0.017). The cTnI and CK-MB concentrations were negatively correlated with prognosis (P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: Myocardial injury, as evidenced by elevated cardiac biomarkers, is common in critically ill children without primary cardiac illness. cTnI and CK-MB are associated with outcomes. Shock, heart failure, and multiple organ dysfunction syndromes are independently associated with simultaneous elevations of CK-MB and cTnI concentrations. Further prospective studies are needed to elucidate the clinical utility of these biomarkers."

The lysing of the muscle cells can lead to the release of cell contents that can lead to acute injury and other life-threatening conditions. Levetiracetam is an anticonvulsant commonly used in generalized and partial tonic-clonic seizures. Well-known side effects include agitation, depression, anxiety, irritability, rash, and somnolence; however, there are an increasing number of case reports that report rhabdomyolysis secondary to antiepileptic use. We present a case of a 27-year-old male with new-onset seizures who was started on levetiracetam therapy and found to have elevated creatine kinase (CK), which decreased only with tapering of the drug. Our case displays the importance of considering levetiracetam as a cause of rhabdomyolysis, supporting this rare side effect of the antiseizure medication. Rhabdomyolysis is a potentially life-threatening condition that can lead to irreversible renal damage if not managed properly."

METHODS: Fifteen women (37.8 ± 9.6 years; BMI, 38.8 ± 5.6 kg/m2) completed the intervention (creatine group = 7; placebo group = 8). Both groups followed a strength training program three times a week for 8 weeks. The dosage for both the creatine and placebo was 8 g prior to each exercise session. Body weight, skeletal muscle mass, fat mass, handgrip strength, and physical activity levels were measured before and after the intervention. RESULTS: The creatine group showed a reduction of 9.5 ± 1.5 kg in body weight, with a 0.72 ± 0.6 kg decrease in muscle mass and an 8.64 ± 1.2 kg reduction in fat mass. The placebo group had a reduction of 9.6 ± 3.5 kg in body weight, with a 0.6 ± 1.2 kg decrease in muscle mass and an 8.88 ± 3.2 kg reduction in fat mass, without significant differences between groups (p > 0.05). CONCLUSION: The pre-session strength exercise training creatine supplementation is not superior to placebo regarding body weight and fat mass losses and the attenuation of muscle mass loss during the first weeks of rehabilitation following bariatric surgery.",

Concurrent muscle hypertrophy or persistently elevated creatine kinase (CK) is rare. While muscle hypertrophy is commonly observed in myogenic diseases, such as muscular dystrophy, acromegaly, inflammatory myopathies, and hypothyroidism, reports of muscle hypertrophy caused by neuropathy are infrequent. We encountered a patient with persistently elevated CK levels and unilateral lower leg muscle hypertrophy associated with neuropathy. The patient had cauda equina syndrome symptoms and pain in the left lower leg. Lumbar spine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed central spinal stenosis, which was believed to be the cause of the symptoms. Lower-limb MRI revealed high signal intensity in the gastrocnemius muscle on fat-suppressed T2-weighted imaging. Surgical treatment improved the radiculopathy, hypertrophy, and pain in the left lower leg. During the one-year follow-up, improvement was confirmed with both MRI and nerve conduction studies. Calf muscle hypertrophy associated with neuropathy has been reported; however, no reports have demonstrated pre- and postoperative changes with MRI and nerve conduction studies. We report a patient with lower leg muscle hypertrophy and persistent CK elevation associated with neuropathy, along with a literature review."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Well-leg compartment syndrome (WLCS) can occur due to compression and lower limb circulation disturbances caused by the surgical position during the procedure. Although rare, with an incidence of 1 in 3500 surgeries performed in the lithotomy position, it can lead to serious complications. Therefore, prevention and early diagnosis are critical. Symptoms of WLCS, such as leg pain, swelling, paresthesia, and serum creatine kinase (CK) levels are useful for diagnosis. This study aimed to investigate the risk factors for postoperative CK elevation in laparoscopic or robot-assisted colorectal cancer surgery performed in the lithotomy-Trendelenburg position. METHODS: Postoperative CK levels were measured in 178 patients who underwent laparoscopic or robot-assisted colorectal cancer surgery between February 2022 and March 2023. We compared patient backgrounds, short-term outcomes, and thigh/calf circumferences between patients with CK levels ≥ 250 (n = 62) and those with CK levels < 250 (n = 116). We investigated risk factors for elevated CK levels using both univariate and multivariate analyses. RESULTS: Four patients with CK levels of 22405 U/L, 4685 U/L, 4050 U/L, and 3824 U/L reported symptoms, which improved with conservative treatment. The following independent prognostic factors were identified by multivariate analysis: male sex (odds ratio [OR], 4.403; 95% CI, 1.960 to 9.892), rectal surgery (OR, 2.779; 95% CI, 1.249 to 6.184), continuous head-down position duration ≥ 180 min (OR, 3.523; 95% CI, 1.552 to 7.997), and preoperative calf circumference ≥ 33 cm (OR, 2.482; 95% CI, 1.154 to 5.339). CONCLUSIONS: Risk factors for CK elevation after colorectal cancer surgery in the lithotomy position include male sex, rectal surgery, an extended continuous head-down position without position changes, and a larger preoperative calf circumference. This study highlights the potential importance of intraoperative position changes every 3 h for preventing elevated CK levels, although the preventive effect was not specifically examined.",

      "abstract": "Mitochondrial creatine kinase (mtCK) regulates the \"fast\" export of phosphocreatine to support cytoplasmic phosphorylation of ADP to ATP which is more rapid than direct ATP export. Such \"creatine-dependent\" phosphate shuttling is attenuated in several muscles, including the heart, of the D2.mdx mouse model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy at only 4 weeks of age. However, the degree to which creatine-dependent and -independent systems of phosphate shuttling progressively worsen or potentially adapt in a hormetic manner throughout disease progression remains unknown. Here, we performed a series of proof-of-principle investigations designed to determine how phosphate shuttling pathways worsen or adapt in later disease stages in D2.mdx (12 months of age). We also determined whether changes in creatine-dependent phosphate shuttling are linked to alterations in mtCK thiol redox state. In permeabilized muscle fibres prepared from cardiac left ventricles, we found that 12-month-old male D2.mdx mice have reduced creatine-dependent pyruvate oxidation and elevated complex I-supported H2O2 emission (mH2O2). Surprisingly, creatine-independent ADP-stimulated respiration was increased and mH2O2 was lowered suggesting that impairments in the faster mtCK-mediated phosphocreatine export system resulted in compensation of the alternative slower pathway of ATP export. The apparent impairments in mtCK-dependent bioenergetics occurred independent of mtCK protein content but were related to greater thiol oxidation of mtCK and a more oxidized cellular environment (lower GSH:GSSG). Next, we performed a proof-of-principle study to determine whether creatine-dependent bioenergetics could be enhanced through chronic administration of the mitochondrial-targeting, ROS-lowering tetrapeptide, SBT-20. We found that 12 weeks of daily treatment with SBT-20 (from day 4-∼12 weeks of age) increased respiration and lowered mH2O2 only in the presence of creatine in D2.mdx mice without affecting calcium-induced mitochondrial permeability transition activity. In summary, creatine-dependent mitochondrial bioenergetics are attenuated in older D2.mdx mice in relation to mtCK thiol oxidation that seem to be countered by increased creatine-independent phosphate shuttling as a unique form of mitohormesis. Separate results demonstrate that creatine-dependent bioenergetics can also be enhanced with a ROS-lowering mitochondrial-targeting peptide. These results demonstrate a specific relationship between redox stress and mitochondrial hormetic reprogramming during dystrophin deficiency with proof-of-principle evidence that creatine-dependent bioenergetics could be modified with mitochondrial-targeting small peptide therapeutics.",

Creatine (Cr) is a promising intervention to alleviate Dox-induced cardiotoxicity. This study aimed to examine the effects of Cr beforeDox on cardiac mitochondrial creatine kinase (MtCK). Male rats were randomly assigned to one of two 4-week Cr feeding interventions (standard Cr diet or Cr loading diet) or a control diet (Con, n = 20). Rats in the standard Cr diet (Cr1, n = 20) were fed 2% Cr for 4-weeks. Rats in the Cr loading diet (Cr2, n = 20) were fed 4% Cr for 1-week followed by 2% Cr for 3-weeks. After 4-weeks, rats received either a bolus injection of 15 mg/kg Dox or a placebo saline injection (Sal). Five days post-injections left ventricle (LV) was excised and analyzed for MtCK expression using Western blot and ELISA. A significant drug effect was observed for LV mass (p < 0.05), post hoc testing revealed LV mass of Con + Dox and Cr2 + Dox was significantly lower than Con + Sal (p < 0.05). A significant drug effect was observed for MtCK (p = 0.03) through Western blot. A significant drug effect (p = 0.03) and interaction (p = 0.02) was observed for MtCK using ELISA. Post hoc testing revealed that Cr2 + Dox had significantly higher MtCK than Cr1 + Sal and Cr2 + Sal. Data suggest that a reduction in LV mass and MtCK may contribute to Dox-induced cardiotoxicity, and Cr supplementation may play a potential role in mitigating cardiotoxicity by preserving mitochondrial CK.",

Baseline T-Hcy levels were 11.6 ± 3.1 μmol/L (95% confidence interval [CI], from 10.6 to 12.6). The intervention induced a mild reduction in T-Hcy levels across the monitoring period (p = 0.028), with T-Hcy levels after 1, 2, 3, and 6 months were 10.4 ± 3.0 μmol/L, 10.6 ± 2.9 μmol/L, 10.1 ± 2.7 μmol/L, and 9.3 ± 2.8 μmol/L, respectively. These findings suggest the overall tolerability of creatine-guanidinoacetic mixture in healthy adults, with homocysteine-increasing risk of no concern."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Patients with central core myopathy (CCM) can be at risk of exercise-induced rhabdomyolysis and myalgia. Despite its possible positive effects, physical training has been long avoided in these patients as no population-specific exercise adaption strategies have been developed. Here we present the case of a 17-year-old male CCM patient who underwent a 3-month training program tailored to a preliminary test aimed at assessing his physical exertion tolerance measured via changes in serum creatine kinase (CK). METHODS: The preliminary tolerance test consisted of three 25-minute sessions (one session per week) of physical exercise (aerobic, resistance and mixed) at an intensity quantified as level 6 of the Borg Category Ratio (CR) 0-10 scale. A blood sample to assess CK was conducted 36 h following eachsession. The intervention consisted of a training program (three sessions per week) including both resistance and aerobic exercises concomitant with a personalized nutritional plan. Before and after intervention, a battery of metabolic (indirect calorimetry, bioimpedance) and cardiopulmonary (CPET) tests were performed. RESULTS: After training, improvements of the anaerobic threshold (+6.9%), normalized VO2 max (+15%) and body composition (muscle mass, +1.1 kg; fat mass, -1.1 kg were observed without pain, rhabdomyolysis, and blood CK augmentation compared to pretraining values. CONCLUSION: Our results highlight that a mixed aerobic/resistance training, properly tailored and supported by a specific nutritional plan, may safely improve the physical fitness and body composition in a CCM patient. Dosing exercise-induced CK serum change following Borg CR-10 intensity assessment, may be useful to correctly tailor physical exercise in these patients."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: This study aimed to evaluate the effects of creatine monohydrate supplementation on cognitive function in adults and explore its potential role in preventing and delaying cognitive impairment-related diseases. METHODS: Following the PRISMA 2020 guidelines, a systematic review with meta-analysis was conducted. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published between 1993 and 2024 were retrieved from PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases. The study protocol was registered with PROSPERO (registration number: CRD42024533557). The impact of creatine supplementation on overall cognitive function, memory, executive function, attention, and information processing speed was assessed using standardized mean differences (SMD) and Hedge's g with 95% confidence intervals (CI). RESULTS: Sixteen RCTs involving 492 participants aged 20.8-76.4 years, including healthy individuals and patients with specific diseases, were selected. Creatine monohydrate was the form used in all included studies. Creatine supplementation showed significant positive effects on memory (SMD = 0.31, 95% CI: 0.18-0.44, Hedges's g = 0.3003, 95% CI: 0.1778-0.4228) and attention time (SMD = -0.31, 95% CI: -0.58 to -0.03, Hedges's g = -0.3004, 95% CI: -0.5719 to -0.0289), as well as significantly improving processing speed time (SMD = -0.51, 95% CI: -1.01 to -0.01, Hedges's g = -0.4916, 95% CI: -0.7852 to -0.1980). However, no significant improvements were found on overall cognitive function or executive function. Subgroup analyses revealed that creatine supplementation was more beneficial in individuals with diseases, those aged 18-60 years, and females. No significant differences were found between short- (<4 weeks) and long-term (≥4 weeks) interventions for improving cognitive function. Low-to-moderate risk of bias was found, and no significant publication bias was detected. The GRADE assessment indicates that the certainty of evidence for memory function is moderate, suggesting a reasonable level of confidence in the positive effects of creatine on memory. However, the evidence for processing speed, overall cognitive function, executive function, and attention is of low certainty, indicating that further research is needed to confirm these potential benefits. CONCLUSION: Current evidence suggests that creatine monohydrate supplementation may confer beneficial effects on cognitive function in adults, particularly in the domains of memory, attention time, and information processing speed. Larger robust clinical trials are warranted to further validate these findings. Furthermore, future research should investigate the influence of different populations and intervention durations on the effects of creatine monohydrate supplementation, as well as elucidate the precise mechanisms underlying its potential cognitive-enhancing properties."

      "abstract": "The hormonal changes in women influence creatine dynamics, emphasizing its potential importance during menstruation, pregnancy, postpartum, menopause, and postmenopause. Yet, limited research explores creatine's impact on female reproductive health at the population level. Our study investigated the relationship between dietary creatine intake and reproductive health indices in US women using data from the 2017-2020 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). We extracted a dataset containing females aged 12 years and above who provided details about their reproductive health and dietary habits. Daily creatine intake was quantified as a relative amount (mg per kg body mass) and did not include creatine from dietary supplements and pharmacological agents. A daily requirement for dietary creatine for healthy women was employed to classify respondents into two separate subpopulations: (1) suboptimal intake of creatine (<13 mg per kg body mass per day) or (2) recommended intake (dietary creatine ≥ 13 mg per kg body mass per day). A total of 4522 female participants from the NHANES study (age 44.5 ± 20.5 years) provided data on their reproductive health and dietary intake. The average daily creatine intake for the group was 10.5 ± 10.8 mg per kg body mass. The odds ratio for having irregular periods in women consuming ≥13 mg of creatine per kg body mass daily (recommended intake) compared to those with suboptimal intake was 0.75 (95% CI, from 0.66 to 0.86), indicating a significant association between higher intake of dietary creatine and lower risk of oligomenorrhea (p < .001). Moreover, women consuming less than 13 mg of creatine per kg body mass faced an increased risk of fetal macrosomia (OR 1.26; p = .04), pelvic infection (OR 1.68; p = .01), hysterectomy (OR 1.42; p < .001), oophorectomy (OR 1.54; p < .001), and receiving hormone replacement therapy (OR 1.26; p = .02). Consuming a creatine-rich diet has been linked to lower risks of reproductive issues in US women aged 12 and above. Those consuming ≥13 mg of creatine per kg body mass daily showed notably lower risks of irregular menstrual periods, obstetric conditions, and pelvic pathology. Further studies are needed to confirm these potential benefits."

We established a method to predict CK-MB mass from activity data based on a prospective pilot study in order to simplify multicentre trials. METHODS: 38 elective cardiac surgery patients without acute myocardial ischaemia and terminal renal failure were recruited. CK-MB mass and activity were determined in venous blood samples drawn preoperatively, postoperatively, 6 h post-op, and 12 h post-op. Linear regression and generalized additive models (GAMs) were applied to describe the relationship of mass and activity. Influences of demographic and perioperative factors on the fit of GAMs was evaluated. The agreement of predicted and measured CK-MB masses was assessed by Bland-Altman analyses. RESULTS: Linear regression provided an acceptable overall fit (r2 = 0.834) but showed deviances at low CK-MB levels. GAMs did not benefit from the inclusion of age, body mass index and surgical times. The minimal adequate model predicted CK-MB masses from activities, sex and sampling time with an r2 of 0.981. Bland-Altman analyses confirmed narrow limits of agreement (spread: 8.87 µg/l) and the absence of fixed (P = 0.41) and proportional (P = 0.21) biases. CONCLUSIONS: GAM-based modelling of CK-MB data in a representative patient cohort allowed to predict CK-MB masses from activities, sex and sampling time. This approach simplifies the integration of study centres with incompatible CK-MB data into multicentre trials in order to facilitate inclusion of CK-MB levels in statistical models."

METHODS: The databases EMBASE, PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane, and ClinicalTrials.gov were thoroughly searched without any restrictions on language. Review Manager 5.3 software was utilized to calculate relative risks with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for dichotomous data and mean differences or standardized mean differences with 95%CIs for continuous data. To evaluate publication bias, Egger's test was employed using Stata/SE software. RESULTS: This analysis included 26 studies comprising 28 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involving a total of 100,193 patients, and 4 different lipid-lowering therapy combinations. For events with creatine kinase >3ULN, evolocumab and alirocumab demonstrated significant advantages compared to inclisiran. Evolocumab showed the best results in terms of both new muscle symptom events and creatine kinase >3ULN.

In this intermission, one group underwent 20 sessions of WBC, delivered five times a week at -120°C for 3 min each, while the comparison group received no such treatment. Markers of muscle injury-serum myoglobin concentration, creatine kinase and lactate dehydrogenase activity and also uric acid, and cell-free DNA concentration-were measured before and after downhill runs.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Sarcopenia is an age-related condition characterized by progressive loss of muscle mass, strength, and function. The occurrence of sarcopenia has a huge impact on physical, psychological, and social health. Therefore, the prevention and treatment of sarcopenia is becoming an important public health issue. METHOD: 35 six-week-old male C57BL/6 mice were randomly divided into five groups, one of which served as a control group, while the rest of the groups were constructed as a model of sarcopenia by intraperitoneal injection of D-galactose. The intervention with lactoferrin, creatine, and their mixtures, respectively, was carried out through gavage for 8 weeks. Muscle function was assessed based on their endurance, hanging time, and grip strength. The muscle tissues were weighed to assess the changes in mass, and the muscle RNA was extracted for myogenic factor expression and transcriptome sequencing to speculate on the potential mechanism of action by GO and KEGG enrichment analysis. RESULT: The muscle mass (lean mass, GAS index), and muscle function (endurance, hanging time, and grip strength) decreased, and the size and structure of myofiber was smaller in the model group compared to the control group. The intervention with lactoferrin and creatine, either alone or combination, improved muscle mass and function, restored muscle tissue, and increased the expression of myogenic regulators. The combined group demonstrated the most significant improvement in these indexes. The RNA-seq results revealed enrichment in the longevity-regulated pathway, MAPK pathway, focal adhesion, and ECM-receptor interaction pathway in the intervention group. The intervention group may influence muscle function by affecting the proliferation, differentiation, senescence of skeletal muscle cell, and contraction of muscle fiber. The combined group also enriched the mTOR-S6K/4E-BPs signaling pathway, PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, and energy metabolism-related pathways, including Apelin signaling, insulin resistance pathway, and adipocytokine signaling pathway, which affect energy metabolism in muscle. CONCLUSIONS: Lactoferrin and creatine, either alone or in combination, were found to inhibit the progression of sarcopenia by influencing the number and cross-sectional area of muscle fibers and muscle protein synthesis. The combined intervention appears to exert a more significant effect on energy metabolism.",

Data from randomized controlled trials suggest that concomitant myalgia is rare in RA and does not lead to drug discontinuation. We describe the case of a 68-year-old Caucasian female with longstanding, multi-failure RA who started BARI and achieved disease remission. However, she developed a symptomatic CK increase, as well as a parallel increase in total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein, and triglycerides. Dechallenge-rechallenge demonstrated a plausible relationship between the clinical/laboratory abnormalities and BARI. In fact, when the drug was withdrawn, CK returned to normal and myalgia disappeared, whereas symptoms returned and CK levels increased when BARI was restarted. BARI may be rarely associated with symptomatic CK elevation, and this may pose clinical challenges, particularly for patients with multi-failure RA who achieved good disease control with BARI but required drug discontinuation due to intolerance.",

The kidneys are involved in the first step of creatine production. With kidney transplantation being the gold-standard treatment for end-stage kidney disease, kidney transplant recipients (KTR) may be at risk of impaired creatine synthesis. We aimed to compare creatine homeostasis between KTR and controls. Plasma and urine concentrations of arginine, glycine, guanidinoacetate, creatine and creatinine were measured in 553 KTR and 168 healthy controls. Creatine intake was assessed using food frequency questionnaires. Iothalamate-measured GFR data were available in subsets of 157 KTR and 167 controls. KTR and controls had comparable body weight, height and creatine intake (all P > 0.05). However, the total creatine pool was 14% lower in KTR as compared to controls (651 ± 178 vs. 753 ± 239 mmol, P < 0.001). The endogenous creatine synthesis rate was 22% lower in KTR as compared to controls (7.8 ± 3.0 vs. 10.0 ± 4.1 mmol per day, P < 0.001). Despite lower GFR, the plasma guanidinoacetate and creatine concentrations were 21% and 41% lower in KTR as compared to controls (both P < 0.001). Urinary excretion of guanidinoacetate and creatine were 66% and 59% lower in KTR as compared to controls (both P < 0.001). In KTR, but not in controls, a higher measured GFR was associated with a higher endogenous creatine synthesis rate (std. beta: 0.21, 95% CI: 0.08; 0.33; P = 0.002), as well as a higher total creatine pool (std. beta: 0.22, 95% CI: 0.11; 0.33; P < 0.001). These associations were fully mediated (93% and 95%; P < 0.001) by urinary guanidinoacetate excretion which is consistent with production of the creatine precursor guanidinoacetate as rate-limiting factor. Our findings highlight that KTR have a disturbed creatine homeostasis as compared to controls. Given the direct relationship of measured GFR with endogenous creatine synthesis rate and the total creatine pool, creatine supplementation might be beneficial in KTR with low kidney function.Trial registration ID: NCT02811835.Trial registration URL: https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02811835 .",

We report a case of a 39-year-old female with a history of EDS whose physical capabilities were severely impacted by their chronic pain and fatigue symptoms. After little progress was made with their current treatment plan of analgesics, manual therapy, exercise, and physical therapy, the patient was supplemented with creatine monohydrate due to its studied benefits in muscular strength and endurance for athletes. Following supplementation, the patient reported significant benefits in their muscular fatigue symptoms, allowing them to engage in daily activities and exercises more effectively. This case demonstrates a potential addition to the treatment of EDS that can improve a patient's quality of life."

In this study, we delve into the investigations of five distinct LMNA mutations, including three novel variants and two pathogenic variants identified in patients with muscular laminopathy. Our approach employs zebrafish models to comprehensively study these variants. Transgenic zebrafish expressing wild-type LMNA and each mutation undergo extensive morphological profiling, swimming behavior assessments, muscle endurance evaluations, heartbeat measurement, and histopathological analysis of skeletal muscles. Additionally, these models serve as platform for focused drug screening. We explore the transcriptomic landscape through qPCR and RNAseq to unveil altered gene expression profiles in muscle tissues. Larvae of LMNA(L35P), LMNA(E358K), and LMNA(R453W) transgenic fish exhibit reduced swim speed compared to LMNA(WT) measured by DanioVision. All LMNA transgenic adult fish exhibit reduced swim speed compared to LMNA(WT) in T-maze. Moreover, all LMNA transgenic adult fish, except LMNA(E358K), display weaker muscle endurance than LMNA(WT) measured by swimming tunnel. Histochemical staining reveals decreased fiber size in all LMNA mutations transgenic fish, excluding LMNA(WT) fish. Interestingly, LMNA(A539V) and LMNA(E358K) exhibited elevated heartbeats. We recognize potential limitations with transgene overexpression and conducted association calculations to explore its effects on zebrafish phenotypes. Our results suggest lamin A/C overexpression may not directly impact mutant phenotypes, such as impaired swim speed, increased heart rates, or decreased muscle fiber diameter. Utilizing LMNA zebrafish models for drug screening, we identify L-carnitine treatment rescuing muscle endurance in LMNA(L35P) and creatine treatment reversing muscle endurance in LMNA(R453W) zebrafish models. Creatine activates AMPK and mTOR pathways, improving muscle endurance and swim speed in LMNA(R453W) fish. Transcriptomic profiling reveals upstream regulators and affected genes contributing to motor dysfunction, cardiac anomalies, and ion flux dysregulation in LMNA mutant transgenic fish. These findings faithfully mimic clinical manifestations of muscular laminopathies, including dysmorphism, early mortality, decreased fiber size, and muscle dysfunction in zebrafish. Furthermore, our drug screening results suggest L-carnitine and creatine treatments as potential rescuers of muscle endurance in LMNA(L35P) and LMNA(R453W) zebrafish models. Our study offers valuable insights into the future development of potential treatments for LMNA-related muscular laminopathy.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: We report a rare case of primary clinical presentation featuring elevated creatine kinase (CK) levels in a neonate, which is associated with the LAMA2 gene. In this case, a heterozygous mutation in exon5 of the LAMA2 gene, c.715C>G (resulting in a change of nucleotide number 715 in the coding region from cytosine to guanine), induced an amino acid alteration p.R239G (No. 239) in the patient, representing a missense mutation. This observation may be elucidated by the neonatal creatine monitoring mechanism, a phenomenon not previously reported. CASE SUMMARY: We analysed the case of a neonate presenting solely with elevated CK levels who was eventually discharged after supportive treatment. The chief complaint was identification of increased CK levels for 15 d and higher CK values for 1 d. Admission occurred at 18 d of age, and despite prolonged treatment with creatine and vitamin C, the elevated CK levels showed limited improvement. Whole exome sequencing revealed the presence of a c.715C>G mutation in LAMA2 in the newborn, correlating with a clinical phenotype. However, the available information offers insufficient evidence for clinical pathogenicity. CONCLUSION: Mutations in LAMA2 are associated with the clinical phenotype of increased neonatal CK levels, for which no specific treatment exists. Whole genome sequencing facilitates early diagnosis."

CDS show brain creatine (Cr) deficiency, intellectual disability with severe speech delay, behavioral troubles, epilepsy, and motor dysfunction. AGAT/GAMT-deficient patients lack brain Cr synthesis but express the Cr transporter SLC6A8 at the blood-brain barrier and are thus treatable by oral supplementation of Cr. In contrast, no satisfactory treatment has been identified for Cr transporter deficiency (CTD), the most frequent of CDS. We used our Slc6a8Y389C CTD rat model to develop a new AAV2/9-2YF-driven gene therapy re-establishing the functional Slc6a8 transporter in rat CNS. We show, after intra-cisterna magna AAV2/9-2YF-Slc6a8-FLAG vector injection of postnatal day 11 pups, the transduction of Slc6a8-FLAG in cerebellum, medulla oblongata, and spinal cord as well as a partial recovery of Cr in these brain regions, together with full prevention of locomotion defaults and impairment of myocyte development observed in Slc6a8Y389 C/y male rats. While more work is needed to correct those CTD phenotypes more associated with forebrain structures, this study is the first demonstrating positive effects of an AAV-driven gene therapy on CTD and thus represents a very encouraging approach to treat the so-far untreatable CTD."

      "abstract": "Suspected adverse drug reactions (ADRs) during treatment with clozapine often prompt therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) in clinical practice. Currently, there is no official recommendation for pharmacogenetic (PGx) testing in the context of clozapine therapy. In this case report, we demonstrate and discuss the challenges of interpreting PGx and TDM results highlighting the possibilities and limitations of both analytical methods. A 36-year-old male patient with catatonic schizophrenia was treated with clozapine. He experienced multiple hospitalizations due to elevated creatine kinase (CK) levels (up to 9000 U/L, reference range: 30-200 U/L). With no other medical explanation found, physicians suspected clozapine-induced ADRs. However, plasma levels of clozapine were consistently low or subtherapeutic upon admission, prompting us to conduct a PGx analysis and retrospectively review the patient's TDM data, progress notes, and discharge reports. We investigated two possible hypotheses to explain the symptoms despite low clozapine plasma levels: Hypothesis i. suggested the formation and accumulation of a reactive intermediate metabolite due to increased activity in cytochrome P450 3A5 and reduced activity in glutathione S-transferases 1, leading to myotoxicity. Hypothesis ii. proposed under-treatment with clozapine, resulting in ineffective clozapine levels, leading to a rebound effect with increased catatonic symptoms and CK levels. After considering both data sources (PGx and TDM), hypothesis ii. appeared more plausible. By comprehensively assessing all available TDM measurements and examining them in temporal correlation with the drug dose and clinical symptoms, we observed that CK levels normalized when clozapine plasma levels were raised to the therapeutic range. This was achieved through hospitalization and closely monitored clozapine intake. Therefore, we concluded that the symptoms were not an ADR due to altered clozapine metabolism but rather the result of under-treatment. Interpreting TDM and PGx results requires caution. Relying solely on isolated PGx or single TDM values can result in misinterpretation of drug reactions. We recommend considering the comprehensive patient history, including treatment, dosages, laboratory values, clinic visits, and medication adherence."

Blood tests revealed renal damage and elevated creatine kinase (CK) levels, resulting in hospitalization. Although he received fluid replacement after admission, he did not urinate, and his CK levels increased to 420,000 U/L, necessitating hemodialysis. Subsequently, his CK levels gradually improved over time, accompanied by increased urine output.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: While rhabdomyolysis frequently leads to hospital admissions, typically following trauma, recurrent occurrences are relatively rare, accounting for just 10% of cases. For young patients experiencing repetitive episodes without an apparent cause, a comprehensive investigation into the possible etiologies is crucial. Recognizing the atypical nature of recurrent rhabdomyolysis is crucial and a thorough workup encompassing evaluations for potential endocrine, inflammatory, and metabolic etiologies is recommended. Additionally, acute kidney injury is a common complication with severe rhabdomyolysis, hence early recognition and intervention is crucial. CASE DESCRIPTION: Herein we present a case of a 30-year-old young African American male patient with recurrent rhabdomyolysis with the highest ever reported creatine kinase (CK) to our knowledge. A notable aspect of this case is the surprising absence of acute kidney injury, despite the severity of CK elevation. We also delve into the extensive workup done for rhabdomyolysis of unclear etiology. CONCLUSIONS: Our case underscores the importance of looking into non-traumatic factors behind recurrent rhabdomyolysis, especially in young patients. We also stress the significance of early detection and intervention, showcasing the potential to prevent acute kidney injury even in the presence of markedly elevated CK levels. Timely recognition and appropriate management can prove instrumental in mitigating the severity of complications associated with rhabdomyolysis."

      "abstract": "Creatine transporter deficiency (CTD) is an X-linked disease caused by mutations in the Slc6a8 gene. The impaired creatine uptake in the brain leads to developmental delays with intellectual disability. We hypothesized that deficient creatine uptake in CTD cerebral cells impact methylation balance leading to alterations of genes and proteins expression by epigenetic mechanism. In this study, we determined the status of nucleic acid methylation in both Slc6a8 knockout mouse model and brain organoids derived from CTD patients' cells. We also investigated the effect of dodecyl creatine ester (DCE), a promising prodrug that increases brain creatine content in the mouse model of CTD. The level of nucleic acid methylation was significantly reduced compared to healthy controls in both in vivo and in vitro CTD models. This hypo-methylation tended to be regulated by DCE treatment in vivo. These results suggest that increased brain creatine after DCE treatment restores normal levels of DNA methylation, unveiling the potential of using DNA methylation as a marker to monitor the drug efficacy."

Regular laboratory assessments are recommended throughout the treatment period to detect any potential complications. Objectives This study aims to present the alterations in laboratory parameters throughout the course of isotretinoin therapy and identify required diagnostic testing. Methods This study involved 136 patients undergoing isotretinoin treatment at doses of 0.3-0.5 mg/kg/day, with ages ranging from 18 to 41 years. A retrospective evaluation was conducted on biomarkers including aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT), creatine kinase (CK), triglycerides, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), hemoglobin, white blood cells, and thrombocytes. Levels of these parameters were analyzed prior to treatment and at the third month of treatment from the records of patients and the data were compared statistically. Moreover, the parameters of ALT, AST, CK, and GGT were graded objectively, and any alterations were noted in the patients. Results The levels of ALT, AST and GGT, along with triglycerides, total cholesterol, LDL-C, and thrombocyte levels showed significant elevation (p=0.001, p<0.001, p<0.001, p=0.001, p<0.001, p<0.001, and p=0.003, respectively). A significant decrease in HDL-C with hemoglobin was also noted (p=0.022, p=0.006, respectively). One patient (0.73%) exhibited grade 1 elevations in ALT, AST, and CK. One patient (0.73%) displayed grade 1 elevations in ALT and AST. One patient (0.73%) exhibited grade 1 elevations in AST and CK, while another patient (0.73%) had grade 1 elevation in AST and grade 3 elevation in CK. Furthermore, one patient (0.73%) had a grade 1 elevation exclusively in ALT, two patients (1.47%) had a grade 1 elevation exclusively in AST, and six patients (4.41%) exhibited a grade 1 elevation in CK only. No grade changes were observed in the GGT levels in the patients. Conclusion During isotretinoin treatment, changes in ALT and AST levels were more frequently associated with the muscle enzyme CK, while GGT levels remained unaffected. Therefore, GGT can be considered a reliable parameter for evaluating liver function in patients undergoing isotretinoin treatment."

Sixty male rats were equally divided into groups. The control group, aging group, EX-treated group, the CoQ10 group were administered (500 mg/kg) of CoQ10, the CrM group supplied (0.3 mg/kg of CrM), and a group of CrM concomitant with resistance exercise. Serum lipid profiles, certain antioxidant markers, electromyography (EMG), nudix hydrolase 3 (NUDT3) expression, creatine kinase (CK), and sarcopenic index markers were measured after 12 weeks. The gastrocnemius muscle was stained with hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) and myogenin. The EX-CrM combination showed significant improvement in serum lipid profile, antioxidant markers, EMG, NUDT3 gene, myogenin expression, CK, and sarcopenic index markers from other groups. The NUDT3 gene and myogenin expression have proven efficient as diagnostic tools for sarcopenia. Concomitant treatment of CrM and EX is preferable to individual therapy because it reduces inflammation, improves the lipid serum profile, promotes muscle regeneration, and thus has the potential to improve sarcopenia.",

Creatine is often co-administered with glucose to improve its potency yet whether glucose boost the efficacy of creatine in long COVID remains currently unknown. In this report, we investigate the effects of 8-wk creatine intake with and without glucose on patient-reported outcomes, exercise tolerance, and tissue creatine levels in patients with long COVID. Fifteen male and female long COVID adult patients (age 39.7±16.0 y; 9 women) with moderate fatigue and at least one of additional long COVID-related symptoms volunteered to participate in this randomized controlled parallel-group interventional trial. All patients were allocated in a double-blind parallel-group design (1 : 1 : 1) to receive creatine (8 g of creatine monohydrate per day), a mixture of creatine and glucose (8 g of creatine monohydrate and 3 g of glucose per day), or placebo (3 g of glucose per day) t.i.d. during an 8-wk intervention interval. Two-way ANOVA with repeated measures (treatment vs. time interaction) revealed significant differences in changes in total creatine levels between the groups, showing an interaction effect at two brain locations (right precentral white matter F=34.740, p=0.008; partial η2=0.72; left paracentral grey matter F=19.243, p=0.019; partial η2=0.88), with creatine and creatine-glucose outcompeted placebo to elevate creatine levels at these two locations. Several long COVID symptoms (including body aches, breathing problems, difficulties concentrating, headache, and general malaise) were significantly reduced in creatine-glucose group at 8-wk follow-up (p≤0.05); the effect sizes for reducing body aches, difficulties concentrating, and headache were 1.33, 0.80, and 1.12, respectively, suggesting a large effect of creatine-glucose mixture for these outcomes. Our preliminary findings suggest that supplying exogenous creatine with glucose could be recommended as an effective procedure in replenishing brain creatine pool and alleviating long COVID features in this prevalent condition.",

Brain-type creatine kinase (CK-BB) is an enzyme involved in brain energy homeostasis via the phosphocreatine-creatine kinase system. We previously identified PPD as directly bound to CK-BB and activated its activity in vitro. In this study, we explored the antidepressive effects of PPD that target CK-BB. First, we conducted time course studies on brain CK-BB, behaviors, and hippocampal structural plasticity responses to corticosterone (CORT) administration. Five weeks of CORT injection reduced CK-BB activity and protein levels and induced depression-like behaviors and hippocampal structural plasticity impairment. Next, a CK inhibitor and an adeno-associated virus-targeting CKB were used to diminish CK-BB activity or its expression in the brain. The loss of CK-BB in the brain led to depressive behaviors and morphological damage to spines in the hippocampus. Then, a polyclonal antibody against PPD was used to determine the distribution of PPD in the brain tissues. PPD was detected in the hippocampus and cortex and observed in astrocytes, neurons, and vascular endotheliocytes. Finally, different PPD doses were used in the chronic CORT-induced depression model. Treatment with a high dose of PPD significantly increased the activity and expression of CK-BB after long-term CORT injection. In addition, PPD alleviated the damage to depressive-like behaviors and structural plasticity induced by repeated CORT injection. Overall, our study revealed the critical role of CK-BB in mediating structural plasticity in CORT-induced depression and identified CK-BB as a therapeutic target for PPD, allowing us to treat stress-related mood disorders.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Muscle mass is important for metastatic prostate cancer survival and quality of life (QoL). The backbone of treatment for men with metastatic castration sensitive prostate cancer (mCSPC) is androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) with an androgen signaling inhibitor. ADT is an effective cancer treatment, but it facilitates significant declines in muscle mass and adverse health outcomes important to mCSPC survivors, such as fatigue, and reductions in physical function, independence, insulin sensitivity, and QoL. In non-metastatic CSPC survivors, resistance training (RT) preserves muscle mass and improves these related health outcomes, but the biggest barrier to RT in CSPC survivors of all stages is fatigue. Creatine monohydrate supplementation coupled with RT (Cr + RT) may address this barrier since creatine plays a critical role in energy metabolism. Cr + RT in cancer-free older adults and other clinical populations improves muscle mass and related health outcomes. Evidence also suggests that creatine supplementation can complement cancer treatment. Thus, Cr + RT is a strategy that addresses gaps in survivorship needs of people with mCSPC. The purpose of this parallel, double-blind randomized controlled trial is to test the effects of 52-weeks of Cr + RT compared with placebo (PLA) and RT (PLA + RT) on muscle mass, other related health outcomes, and markers of cancer progression. METHODS: We will carry out this trial with our team's established, effective, home-based, telehealth RT program in 200 mCSPC survivors receiving ADT, and evaluate outcomes at baseline, 24-, and 52-weeks. RT will occur twice weekly with elastic resistance bands, and an established creatine supplementation protocol will be used for supplementation delivery. Our approach addresses a major facilitator to RT in mCSPC survivors, a home-based RT program, while utilizing a supervised model for safety. DISCUSSION: Findings will improve delivery of comprehensive survivorship care by providing a multicomponent, patient-centered lifestyle strategy to preserve muscle mass, improve health outcomes, and complement cancer treatment (NCT06112990).",

      "abstract": "Metabolic reprogramming is a hallmark of cancer, enabling cancer cells to rapidly proliferate, invade, and metastasize. We show that creatine levels in metastatic breast cancer cell lines and secondary metastatic tumors are driven by the ubiquitous mitochondrial creatine kinase (CKMT1). We discover that, while CKMT1 is highly expressed in primary tumors and promotes cell viability, it is downregulated in metastasis. We further show that CKMT1 downregulation, as seen in breast cancer metastasis, drives up mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels. CKMT1 downregulation contributes to the migratory and invasive potential of cells by ROS-induced upregulation of adhesion and degradative factors, which can be reversed by antioxidant treatment. Our study thus reconciles conflicting evidence about the roles of metabolites in the creatine metabolic pathway in breast cancer progression and reveals that tight, context-dependent regulation of CKMT1 expression facilitates cell viability, cell migration, and cell invasion, which are hallmarks of metastatic spread.",

Advances in detection and treatment have resulted in an increased survival rate, meaning an increasing population experiencing declines in muscle mass and strength. Creatine supplementation has consistently demonstrated improvements in strength and muscle performance in older adults, though these findings have not been extended to cancer populations. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of short-term creatine supplementation on muscular performance in BC survivors. METHODS: Using a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized design, 19 female BC survivors (mean ± SD age = 57.63 ± 10.77 years) were assigned to creatine (SUPP) (n = 9) or dextrose placebo (PLA) (n = 10) groups. The participants completed two familiarization sessions, then two test sessions, each separated by 7 days, where the participants supplemented with 5 g of SUPP or PLA 4 times/day between sessions. The testing sessions included sit-to-stand power, isometric/isokinetic peak torque, and upper/lower body strength via 10 repetition maximum (10RM) tests. The interaction between supplement (SUPP vs. PLA) and time (Pre vs. Post) was examined using a group × time ANOVA and effect sizes. RESULTS: No significant effects were observed for sit-to-stand power (p = 0.471; ηp2 = 0.031), peak torque at 60°/second (p = 0.533; ηp2 = 0.023), peak torque at 120°/second (p = 0.944; ηp2 < 0.001), isometric peak torque (p = 0.905; ηp2 < 0.001), 10RM chest press (p = 0.407; ηp2 = 0.041), and 10RM leg extension (p = 0.932; ηp2 < 0.001). However, a large effect size for time occurred for the 10RM chest press (ηp2 = 0.531) and leg extension (ηp2 = 0.422). CONCLUSION: Seven days of creatine supplementation does not influence muscular performance among BC survivors.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a psychiatric condition characterized by a prolonged stress response to potentially life-threatening events long after the event has passed. Understanding factors related to recovery from traumatic life events may inform novel targets for intervention. There is emerging preclinical evidence that creatine (Cr), a molecule critical to brain bioenergetics, may be a neurobiological marker of stress reactivity and recovery. METHOD: 25 US Veterans (8 female) completed the Life Events Checklist for DSM-5, which assessed different types of traumatic events. Veterans were also asked to rate the subjective stress of each traumatic event on a 1-10 scale currently (Current Stress) and at the time the event occurred (Past Stress). Stress recovery was quantified as the difference between Current and Past Stress. Current PTSD symptoms were also assessed using the PTSD Checklist for DSM-5. Cr concentrations in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) were measured in the anterior cingulate cortex using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS). RESULTS: Higher levels of Cr were associated with self-reported stress recovery from participants' most traumatic life event. Cr was not related to number of different types of traumatic life events or current PTSD symptoms. LIMITATIONS: The sample size was relatively small. Stress recovery was measured via retrospective self-report. Future experimental work in humans should clarify the protective role of Cr in recovery from trauma. CONCLUSIONS: ACC concentrations of Cr may be an important neurochemical factor related to stress recovery. Future work should investigate Cr as a possible protective factor against the effects of traumatic stress.",

METHODS: This single-center observational study involved 76 chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) patients receiving imatinib treatment, focusing on evaluating drug and metabolite levels using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS-MS) instrumentation. Serum CK and creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB) levels were assessed using Colorimetric kits. RESULTS: CK and CK-MB levels were measured, CK showed a median value of 211.5 IU/l and CK-MB showed a median value of 4.4 IU/l. Comparing low and high CK groups, significant differences were found in peak and trough plasma concentrations of imatinib and its metabolites. Correlations between CK levels and pharmacokinetic parameters were explored, with notable associations identified. Binary logistic regression revealed predictors influencing the therapeutic response to imatinib and categorized expected CK levels into high or low, with peak levels of imatinib emerging as a significant predictor for CK level categorization. CONCLUSION: The study highlights the link between imatinib's pharmacokinetics and elevated CK levels, indicating a possible correlation between specific metabolites and improved treatment response. Individualized monitoring of CK levels and imatinib pharmacokinetics could enhance care for CML patients.",

The need for longitudinal data regarding DMD that could serve as a control for determining treatment efficacy in clinical trials has increased notably. The present study examined the longitudinal data of Japanese DMD patients collectively and assessed individual patients with pathogenic variants eligible for exon-skipping therapy. METHODS: Patients with DMD who visited Kobe University Hospital between March 1991 and March 2019 were enrolled. Data between the patients' first visit until age 20 years were examined. RESULTS: Three hundred thirty-seven patients were included. Serum creatine kinase levels showed extremely high values until the age of 6 years and a rapid decline from ages 7-12 years. Both the median 10-m run/walk velocity and rise-from-floor velocity peaked at the age of 4 years and declined with age. The values for respiratory function declined from the age of 11 years. The median left ventricular ejection fraction was >60% until the age of 12 years and rapidly declined from ages 13-15 years. Examination of the relationship between pathogenic variants eligible for exon-skipping therapy and longitudinal data revealed no characteristic findings. DISCUSSION: We found that creatine kinase levels and motor, respiratory, and cardiac functions each exhibited various changes over time. These findings provide useful information about the longitudinal data of several outcome measures for patients with DMD not receiving corticosteroids. These data may serve as historical controls in comparing the natural history of DMD patients not on regular steroid use in appropriate clinical trials.",

One hundred and twenty children with VMC were recruited and randomized into three groups (40 patients each). Group I received 1.0 g of CPS dissolved in 100 mL of 5% glucose injection intravenously 1 time/day; group II received 1.25 g of CPS dissolved in 125 mL of 5% glucose injection intravenously 1 time/day; group III received 1.5 g of CPS dissolved in 150 mL of 5% glucose injection intravenously 1 time/day; then all three groups were treated with combined use of immunoglobulin (300-400 mg/day) intravenously once a day; and all three groups were treated for 14 days. The clinical efficacy, cardiac function, serum inflammatory factor levels, immune function, and the occurrence of drug toxicity and adverse effects of the children in the three groups were compared after 14 days of treatment. All three groups achieved better therapeutic effects after treatment, in which the effective rate of the Group II and Group III was notably higher versus the Group I. Lower levels of cTnI, CK-MB, LDH, AST, IL-18, IL-6, IFN-γ, and LVEDD and higher CD3+, CD4+, and CD4+/CD8+, FS, and LVEF values were noted in the Group II and Group III versus the Group I, and the results were more pronounced in the high-dose group. The liver and kidney functions of the children in the three groups before and after treatment did not show any significant changes and the incidence of adverse reactions during the treatment period was low in all three groups. Children with VMC can be treated with high-dose CPS in combination with immunoglobulin, which can improve their cardiac function and immune function and reduce the inflammatory response with good overall therapeutic efficacy and fewer adverse effects.",

METHODS: An observational study was performed in China chronic hepatitis B patients receiving telbivudine therapy at 600 mg once daily. Plasma concentration was measured 12 h after taking telbivudine using ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry and SNPs located in RRM2B, TK2, and NME4 was detected by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. All statistical analyses were performed with R 4.3.1 and all graphs were drawn by Origin 2023b and P value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: A total of 140 patients receiving telbivudine therapy were recruited with a median plasma concentration of 952.49 (781.07-1238.98) ng/mL. The value of plasma concentration was proportional to the grade of creatine kinase elevation and the best telbivudine plasma concentration threshold to discriminate the grade 3/4 CK elevation was 1336.61 ng/mL. Multivariate analysis revealed that plasma concentration and rs3826160 were the independent risk factor of telbivudine-induced creatine kinase elevation. Patients with TC and CC genotype in rs3826160 not only had a higher incidence of creatine kinase elevation but also a higher plasma concentration than TT genotype carriers. CONCLUSION: Chronic hepatitis B patients with TC and CC genotype in rs3826160 have high telbivudine plasma concentration are at risk of elevated creatine kinase.",

      "abstract": "Hemodialysis has a detrimental effect on fat-free mass (FFM) and muscle strength over time. Thus, we aimed to evaluate the effect of creatine supplementation on the body composition and Malnutrition-Inflammation Score (MIS) in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) undergoing hemodialysis. An exploratory 1-year balanced, placebo-controlled, and double-blind design was conducted with hemodialysis patients (≥18 years). The creatine group (CG) received 5 g of creatine monohydrate and 5 g of maltodextrin per day and the placebo group (PG) received 10 g of maltodextrin per day. MIS and body composition were analyzed at three time points: pre, intermediate (after 6 months), and post (after 12 months). After 6 months, 60% of patients on creatine experienced an increase in FFM compared to a 36.8% increase for those on placebo. Moreover, 65% of patients on creatine increased their skeletal muscle mass index (SMMI) compared to only 15.8% for those on placebo. Creatine increased intracellular water (ICW) in 60% of patients. MIS did not change after the intervention. In the CG, there was an increase in body weight (p = 0.018), FFM (p = 0.010), SMMI (p = 0.022). CG also increased total body water (pre 35.4 L, post 36.1 L; p = 0.008), mainly due to ICW (pre 20.2 L, intermediate 20.7 L, post 21.0 L; p = 0.016). Long-term creatine supplementation in hemodialysis patients did not attenuate the MIS, but enhanced FFM and SMMI, which was likely triggered by an increase in ICW.",
