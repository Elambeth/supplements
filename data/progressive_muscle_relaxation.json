      "abstract": "Background/Objective: Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a chronic genetic disease affecting multiple body systems and having a significant impact on mental health and sleep. Patients with CF frequently suffer from anxiety, depression, and sleep disturbances, but non-pharmacological strategies are understudied. Although progressive muscle relaxation (PMR) has recognized benefits, its impact on CF remains insufficiently explored. The study aimed to analyze the effect of integrating PMR into a standard pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) program on mental health, sleep quality, and quality of life in adults with CF. Methods: A total of 22 adult patients with CF were randomly assigned to either the intervention group (PR + PMR) or the control group (PR only). Assessments were performed at baseline, after 21 days of intervention, and at the 48-day follow-up. Outcome measures included the CFQ-R for quality of life, the HADS for mental health, and the PSQI for sleep. Results: Compared to the control group, participants who practiced PMR experienced significant reductions in anxiety (p = 0.05) and depression (p = 0.02) at the final assessment. A significant improvement in sleep quality was also observed (p < 0.01). No relevant differences were found in pulmonary function or performance on the six-minute walk test. Conclusions: Integrating PMR into pulmonary rehabilitation programs may be an effective strategy for improving mental health and sleep in patients with CF. Due to its accessibility and ease of implementation, PMR could be adopted as a complementary method in the holistic care of these patients."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Although violence is reported in women with premenstrual syndrome (PMS), preventive interventions are among the essential responsibilities of nurses. This study aimed to determine the effect of progressive muscle relaxation exercises (PMRE) given to women with PMS on PMS symptoms and violent tendencies. METHODS: The study was conducted experimentally with a pre-test/post-test control group between January and August 2024 in a province located in the southeastern Anatolia region of our country. The study included 106 participants, 53 experimental and 53 control, who had PMS. Participants were provided with a PMRE application for eight weeks. Data were collected through the 'Personal Information Form, PMS Scale and Violence Tendency Scale (VTS).' Data were analysed using descriptive statistics, chi-square, independent samples t-test and one-way multivariate analysis of variance. RESULTS: Participants in the intervention group had significantly lower mean scores on the post-test PMS scale and the VTS than participants in the control group (p < 0.05). The difference between the PMS scale's pre-test and post-test mean scores was statistically significantly lower in the experimental group (P < 0.001). The difference between the groups was statistically significant in terms of the combined dependent variables, including the pre-test and post-test change in the mean scores of the PMS scale and the VTS (F(2,103) = 158.77, P < 0.001; V = 0.245; ηp2 = 0.755). This difference explained 75.5% of the variance in the dependent variable. CONCLUSION: PMRE administration has a high level of efficacy in reducing PMS and violence tendencies.

      "abstract": "Background: The increasing prevalence of kinesiophobia, or the fear of movement, among patients following meniscectomy has necessitated the exploration of effective rehabilitative interventions. Traditional methods of rehabilitation often do not adequately address the psychological components of recovery, leading to prolonged recovery times and decreased quality of life. Objective: The objective of this study is to explore the effectiveness of psychological and traditional Chinese medical techniques, including progressive muscle relaxation training (PMRT) and acupressure, in treating kinesiophobia among patients after meniscus surgery. Methods: This randomized clinical trial commenced in December 2021 at the Sports Medicine Department of a hospital in Gansu Province and concluded in February 2023. Seventy hospital inpatients with movement disorders who had undergone meniscus shaping surgery participated in the study (experimental Group 35 people, control Group 35 people). The control group received standard care. In addition to receiving routine care, the experimental group underwent an additional 30 min of PMRT and 5-10 min of acupressure. The kinesiophobia scores and pain scores were assessed using the Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia (TSK) and Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) before the intervention, the first day after the intervention, the fifth day after the intervention, and on the day of discharge. On the day of discharge, the Knee Society Score (KSS) was used to assess the knee joint function of the patients. Statistical analysis was performed using repeated measures ANOVA. Results: The study included 70 kinesiophobia patients following meniscoplasty, equally split between the experimental and control groups. Attrition resulted in 3 experimental group withdrawals and 2 from the control group, leaving 65 for the final analysis (32 experimental, 33 control). The average age of the patients was (67.03 ± 8.26) years, with an average BMI of (25.09 ± 2.88) kg/cm2. Females accounted for 66.10% of the participants. There were no statistically significant differences between the two groups in terms of their preintervention TSK scores, VAS scores, and other baseline data (p > 0.05).There were no statistically significant differences in the kinesiophobia scores (TSK scores) and pain scores (VAS scores) between the experimental group and the routine care group both before the intervention and on the first day after the intervention (p > 0.05). However, the fifth-day and discharge assessments revealed significant score improvements in the experimental group (p < 0.05), along with KSS scores indicating enhanced knee joint function compared to controls (p < 0.05). Conclusions: PMRT combined with acupressure effectively decreases kinesiophobia levels post-meniscoplasty, mitigates pain, fosters early functional exercise participation, and promotes knee joint function recovery.

METHODS AND FINDINGS: This parallel, randomised controlled trial involved 78 children requiring invasive dental treatment under local anaesthetic block, who were allocated into three groups: Progressive Muscle Relaxation, Autonomous Sensory Meridian Response, and Conventional Behaviour Guidance techniques. The primary outcome was reduction of dental anxiety, as measured by objective (pulse rate, oxygen saturation and blood pressure) and subjective (Visual Facial Anxiety Scale) parameters before, after intervention and during local anaesthesia by a blinded outcome assessor. RESULTS: Progressive Muscle Relaxation and Autonomous Sensory Meridian Response demonstrated a significant reduction in blood pressure during local anaesthesia (p = 0.009 and 0.042, respectively). Progressive Muscle Relaxation significantly reduced mean Visual Facial Anxiety scores after intervention (p < 0.001), whilst Autonomous Sensory Meridian Response significantly reduced these scores during injection (p = 0.002). CONCLUSION: The use of Progressive Muscle Relaxation and Autonomous Sensory Meridian Response resulted in a reduction in dental anxiety and can be used as adjuncts to basic behaviour guidance techniques.

      "abstract": "Background & objectives Diabetes distress (DD) is a mental condition that can develop in people with diabetes and shares characteristics with stress, anxiety, and depression. The aim was to determine the effect of Jacobson's Progressive Muscle Relaxation (PMR) therapy on DD, anxiety, glycemic control, hemodynamic and lipid measures among people with type 2 diabetes (T2DM). Methods A total of 80 participants were recruited for this prospective randomised intervention study and divided into two groups equally; group 1 (Control) (n=40) received general counselling for stress reduction and group 2 (Intervention) (n=40) received PMR therapy and general counselling for stress reduction. A pre-, and post-test was done with diabetes distress Scale (DDS) and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) Scales. Baseline data on anthropometric, hemodynamic, biochemical details were collected and repeated after three months. Thirty-six participants, with four dropouts in each group, reported for follow up. Diabetes medication regimens in both groups remained unchanged throughout the study period. Results There was a significant reduction in the total mean scores of DDS (Pre vs. Post) (3.8 vs. 1.6) and GAD Scale (17.9 vs. 6.3; P<0.0001) in the intervention group. The PMR therapy group showed a significant reduction in HbA1c, fasting and post prandial (PP) glucose levels with HbA1c (baseline vs. follow up; 9.2% vs. 7.6%), fasting (194.5 mg/dl vs. 142.4 mg/dl) and PP glucose levels (266.5 mg/dl vs. 175.5 mg/dl) (P=0.001) whereas control group showed an increase in HbA1c, fasting and PP glucose levels. The impact of PMR therapy was also reflected in the lipid profile. Seventy per cent of the intervention group participants followed PMR therapy regularly. Interpretation & conclusions Our study findings highlighted that PMR therapy had a positive effect on diabetes distress and anxiety among people with T2DM. It also improved glycemic control and can be used as an adjunctive to the medications for better management of T2DM.",

      "abstract": "AIMS: To evaluate the effects of passive music listening combined with progressive muscle relaxation on anxiety, depression, stress, coping, and quality-of-life in women with breast and gynaecological cancers receiving chemotherapy. METHODS: This was an assessor-blinded, randomised wait-list controlled trial. A total of 120 participants were randomly allocated into an intervention group or a wait-list control group. The intervention group received an intervention comprising training on passive music listening and progressive muscle relaxation, with once-daily self-practice at home for 3 weeks. The wait-list control group received the same intervention after the outcome assessment at week 6. All outcome data were collected before (T0) and 3 weeks (T1), 6 weeks (T2), and 12 months (T3) after randomisation. A generalised estimating equations model was used to compare the changes in each outcome at different time points. Process evaluation was conducted using data from the patient's self-report forms and interviews. RESULTS: The findings indicated that at T1 and T2, the intervention group's reductions in anxiety were significantly larger than those of the control group. Additionally, the intervention group exhibited significantly better decreases in depression at T2, stress at T1, and dysfunctional coping at T2, and a greater improvement in quality-of-life score at T1 and T2 when compared to the control group. Most of the interviewed participants provided positive feedback on the intervention. CONCLUSIONS: The intervention was beneficial for lowering anxiety, depression, and stress and increasing the quality-of-life of women receiving chemotherapy for breast and gynaecological cancers. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The trial was prospectively registered with ClinicalTrials.gov on 9 February 2022 (registration number: NCT05262621).",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Prevention of depression, stress, and anxiety is a serious concern of the World Health Organization and has been a research topic over the last decades. There is a close association found between children's mental health problems and parental stress, valid for biological and foster families. Evidence suggests that parents with children with disabilities are more stressed, depressed, or anxious than parents who do not have such children. In addition, the progressive muscle relaxation technique (PMR) is the easiest to learn and administer among the relaxation methods available for lowering stress, anxiety, and depression. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A randomized clinical trial (RCT) was adopted with an equivalent group pre-test and post-test design. The experimental group (n = 31) received ten sessions of Jacobson PMR, and the control group (n = 30) received treatment as usual (TAU). Data analysis: The researcher used frequency, percentage, mean, standard deviation, median, and interquartile range to describe the study subjects' demographic profile and clinical profile. Mann-Whitney U test, Kruskal-Wallis H test, and Spearman's Rho were used to find an association between socio-demographic and clinical variables in parents' stress, anxiety, and depression levels. Further, Spearman's Rho was used to find a correlation between stress anxiety and depression. In addition, the Chi-square test and Fisher's exact test were used to compare control and experimental groups with important socio-demographic and clinical variables. Further, Fridman's analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to assess PMR's effectiveness on group stress, anxiety, and depression. Finally, the Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare stress, anxiety, and depression levels between groups. RESULTS: Analysis revealed clinically and statistically significant (P < 0.05) reductions in the stress and anxiety scores of the parents after five sessions of the PMR technique. In addition, findings reveal that there is a statistically significant reduction (P < 0.001) in depression, anxiety, and stress scores after ten sessions of the PMR program among parents of adolescents with mental illness. CONCLUSION: The PMR program adopted in this study was highly effective in reducing stress, anxiety, and depression among parents of adolescents with mental illness."

Methods: We included 61 patients with long COVID-19 symptoms and randomly assigned them to two groups: PR only (group 1 with 30 subjects) and PR with PMR (group 2 with 31 subjects). The PR program consisted of gradual aerobic conditioning, strength training, and breathing exercises. Group 2 received additional 20 min daily sessions of progressive muscle relaxation techniques. Results: Following a 21-day intervention, it was observed that both groups had noteworthy improvements in lung function, exercise capacity, and sleep quality with statistical significance (p < 0.0001). Group 2 showed significant improvements in overall health (as measured by the General Health Questionnaire-12), patient health (as assessed by the Patient Health Questionnaire-9), general anxiety levels (as indicated by the Generalized Anxiety Disorders Scale-7), and sleep quality (as measured by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index), with statistical significance (p < 0.0001), compared to group 1. Moreover, the statistical analysis demonstrated no significant difference in exercise capacity improvement between group 1 and group 2, as indicated by a p-value of 0.1711. Conclusions: The addition of progressive muscle relaxation to pulmonary rehabilitation significantly enhances mental health outcomes, particularly in reducing anxiety and improving sleep quality, for patients with long-term COVID-19 symptoms. These findings suggest that incorporating PMR into PR programs offers a valuable non-pharmacological approach to improving overall patient well-being during long-term COVID-19 recovery."

Aim of our study was to determine whether progressive muscle relaxation affects anxiety and depression levels of pregnant women, pregnancy outcomes, labour pain and analgesic requirements. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 156 pregnant women were enrolled in a prospective non-randomized controlled cohort study. The control group received standard antenatal care and classes only, while the intervention group additionally received progressive muscle relaxation training once a week for six weeks. Anxiety, depression and current strain were measured in a pretest-posttest experimental design using self-report scales at baseline (1 st survey), 5 weeks later (2 nd survey) and during puerperium (3 rd survey). Numeric Rating scales were used for measuring labour pain and satisfaction with analgesic treatment in the 3 rd survey. RESULTS: Fifty complete questionnaires from each group were analysed. There were no differences in mental status between the groups at baseline. Progressive muscle relaxation training significantly reduced depression levels. Trait anxiety, reflecting a person's basic anxiety decreased significantly in both groups during puerperium. No differences in pregnancy outcomes, labour pain and analgesic requirements could be shown within both groups in general. Nonetheless, women attending more than five progressive muscle relaxation courses reported significantly less labour pain within the group and compared to controls. CONCLUSION: Pregnant women could benefit from progressive muscle relaxation training if used continuously. Relaxation methods should be a substantial part of prenatal care and available for everyone."

This study investigated the effectiveness of Progressive Muscle Relaxation (PMR) in improving the well-being of dementia caregivers. Caregivers of individuals with dementia (n = 57) participated in a 3-month intervention, engaging in PMR thrice weekly. Participants completed assessments of depression, anxiety, stress, and caregiver burden at pre-test and post-intervention period. The intervention led to significant reductions in anxiety, stress, depression, and caregiver burden among participants. Female caregivers reported to have higher levels of anxiety and stress compared to males. Caregivers under financial stress showed high levels of distress and increased caregiver burden. These promising findings suggest the need for further research with larger, multicenter samples. Notably, PMR is a readily implementable intervention by nurses, requiring minimal equipment and offering a cost-effective approach to supporting caregiver well-being.",

These outcomes were assessed at baseline, 1 month, 6 months, and 1 year. The paired t-test assessed changes in PSS-10 scores and sleep bruxism activity within the same group over different time points (baseline, 1 month, 6 months, and 1 year). The unpaired t-test compared scores between two groups (OD and SH & PMR) at each time point to evaluate intervention differences. The chi-square test compared gender distribution between both groups. RESULTS: PSS-10 scores were found to decrease with the OD at 1 month and 6 months compared to baseline and SH & PMR at all subsequent follow-ups. This decrease was not statistically significant (p > 0.05) between the OD and SH & PMR groups at all follow-ups. OD and SH & PMR significantly reduced bruxism episodes/hour and bursts/episode at all follow-ups (p < 0.05). There were no adverse effects related to any intervention. CONCLUSIONS: The OD and SH & PMR both effectively reduced PSS-10 scores over 6 months and significantly decreased bruxism episodes and bursts per episode. Both methods are safe and effective for managing sleep bruxism and reducing stress.",

MATERIAL AND METHODS: This is a single-blind, three-arm, parallel-group, randomized controlled trial. Data were collected between 01 October 2023, and 18 December 2023. The sample of the study consisted of 99 primiparous women who gave birth by cesarean section (NLP=33, PMRE=33, and control=33). Women were randomly assigned to the groups. Starting from the first mobilization time after cesarean section, NLP was applied to the NLP group and PMRE was applied to the PMRE group every eight hours for 48 h. In the control group, NLP or PMRE was not applied and the women were allowed to rest on their backs. The primary outcomes of the study were breastfeeding success and breastfeeding self-efficacy. RESULTS: The mean scores of breastfeeding success and breastfeeding self-efficacy measured over time were highest in the NLP group and lowest in the control group (p<.05). The mean scores of breastfeeding success and breastfeeding self-efficacy measured over time increased by 78.4 %, and 97.7 %, respectively, in the NLP group compared to the control group, 74.7 %, and 88.1 %, in the PMRE group compared to the control group, and 13.5 %, and 90.2 %, respectively, in the NLP group compared to the PMRE group (p<.05). CONCLUSION: NLP intervention may have a more positive effect on breastfeeding success and breastfeeding self-efficacy than PMRE intervention.

PURPOSE: The present study aimed to assess the effect of progressive muscle relaxation in reducing stress, anxiety, and depression levels in adolescents. DESIGN AND METHODS: A quasi-experimental design was performed. The study population consisted of 12th-grade students studying in two high schools in Turkiye. Adolescents were allocated to intervention and control groups in a ratio of 1:2, considering their preferences. A total of 88 students (intervention = 31; control = 57) completed the study. Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-42) were used to collect the data. Online progressive muscle relaxation was implemented in the intervention group over eight weeks. RESULTS: There was a statistically significant difference between the intervention and control groups regarding stress, anxiety, and depression pre-test mean scores. The correction of DASS-42 pre-test mean scores was performed by covariance analysis. There was a statistically significant difference in the post-test stress, anxiety, and depression mean scores of the adolescents in the intervention group according to the corrected DASS-42 pre-test mean scores. CONCLUSION: The study concluded that progressive muscle relaxation reduced stress, anxiety, and depression in adolescents. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: School nurses could implement progressive muscle relaxation to support adolescents in managing stress, anxiety, and depression.",

METHODS: Eligible patients with sarcopenia in our hospital were randomly assigned to a control group (n = 24) and an intervention group (n = 25). The control group received conventional dialysis treatment, while the intervention group underwent mindfulness meditation combined with progressive muscle relaxation training during the interdialysis period in addition to conventional dialysis treatment. The effect of the intervention was evaluated after 12 weeks. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in the baseline values of various parameters between the two groups. Exercise capacity (sit-to-stand test,handgrip,time to 10 sit-ups) significantly improved in the intervention group after 12 weeks (32.68 ± 8.32 vs 26.50 ± 6.83; 37.42 ± 10.12 vs 28.12 ± 8.51; 19.8 ± 5.40 vs 25.29 ± 7.18) (p < 0.05). In terms of the kidney disease quality of life (KDQOLTM) score, all other dimensions except sexual function, social functioning, burden of kidney disease and work status dimensions showed significant improvement compared to the baseline (p < 0.05). In the control group, only the dialysis staff encouragement (DSE) and patient satisfaction (PS) dimensions showed slight improvements compared to the baseline (p > 0.05). When compared with the control group, the intervention group showed significant improvements in 10 dimensions of exercise capacity and KDQOLTM scores for physical function, role-physical, general health, energy, symptom/problem list, sleep, DSE, pain, cognitive function, emotional well-being and patient PS after 12 weeks (61.30 ± 5.38 vs 42.98 ± 5.73; 57.50 ± 3.55 vs 50.70 ± 3.62) (p < 0.05).

METHODS: We conducted a pre-post self-controlled trial. Healthcare practitioners meeting the inclusion criteria underwent daily 30-min PMR sessions for seven consecutive days. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAMA) were used to assess the anxiety and sleep quality of subjects pre- and post-intervention. Statistical analysis was performed using the Wilcoxon test, Mann-Whitney U test, Kruskal-Wallis H test, and Spearman rank correlation. RESULTS: A total of 94 participants completed the study. No statistically significant differences in HAMA or PSQI total scores were observed between groups categorized based on demographic variables such as age, sex, and years of education (p > 0.05). The PSQI total score and its components (excluding sleep medication usage) exhibited a positive correlation with the HAMA total score and its psychological anxiety component (p < 0.05), and a correlation was observed between somatic anxiety manifestations and several components of the PSQI. The PSQI total scores before and after intervention were 10.0 (8.0, 13.0) and 8.0 (6.0, 9.0) respectively (p < 0.001); the HAMA total scores were 8.0 (5.0, 13.0) and 6.0 (4.0, 9.5) respectively (p < 0.001). The detection rates of poor sleep and anxiety states, along with their severity, significantly decreased post-intervention (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Healthcare practitioners experience prominent anxiety and sleep issues in the mobile cabin hospital. PMR can be an effective intervention for improving the anxiety and sleep quality of healthcare professionals during support periods in the mobile cabin hospital. However, trials with larger samples are necessitated to further affirm these preliminary findings."

Accordingly, this study aimed to detect the effect of guided mental imagery (GI) and progressive muscle relaxation (PMR) on sedation in patients undergoing noninvasive mechanical ventilation (NIV). This clinical trial study was carried out in the Shahid Modarres Hospital in 2022 and encompassed 80 patients with COVID-19 undergoing NIV, who were assigned to two intervention and control groups. The sedation survey scale was used to collect the required data. Before the intervention, the two groups completed the questionnaires, and then the relaxation program was presented during four sessions for the intervention group.

In this study, we investigated the effect of progressive muscle relaxation (PMR) exercises on vital signs and fatigue in kidney transplant patients. METHOD: We conducted a randomized controlled experimental study with 52 patients (intervention = 26, control = 26) who underwent kidney transplantation at a university hospital in Turkey and met the inclusion criteria. The \"Descriptive Characteristics Form\", \"Vital Signs Monitoring Form\", and \"Fatigue Severity Scale\" were used to record data on the patients. Then, the patients in the intervention group (baseline assessment) were trained to perform PMR exercises, asked to practice, and followed up (first follow-up). Patients were recommended to perform PMR exercises for 20 min every day for four weeks. The second follow-up in the second week after discharge and the third follow-up at the end of the fourth week were performed in the outpatient clinic. RESULTS: We found that the pulse rate, body temperature, and arterial blood pressure decreased over time and oxygen saturation increased in the patients of the intervention group. The PMR exercises decreased fatigue in these patients. The arterial blood pressure and oxygen saturation values differed significantly across different time points among the patients in the control group. The difference in the scores of fatigue severity between the pre-follow-up and the third follow-up in the control group was not significant. CONCLUSION: PMR exercises were found to be an effective nursing intervention in regulating vital signs and reducing fatigue in renal transplant patients.",

METHODS: Seventy-four patients diagnosed with lung cancer were included in this randomized controlled study. A total of 16 sessions of progressive muscle relaxation exercises were applied to the patients in the intervention group for a duration of 30 min, 2 days a week for 8 weeks. Patient Information Form, Medical Research Council Dyspnea Scale (MRC dyspnea scale), Pitssburg Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Visual Analog Scale- Pain (VAS-P) were used to collect data. RESULTS: Socio-demographic and disease characteristics were found to be similar in control and intervention groups.

The present study investigated the effects of sleep hygiene training (SH) and progressive muscle relaxation exercises (PMR) in children with ADHD. METHOD: 57 children aged 6-12 years with ADHD were randomly assigned to the SH and SH + PMR groups and completed the intervention consisting of group training and eight weeks of telephone interviews. The effects of both intervenitons were evaluated via parent, child and clinician report scales and neuropsychological tests. RESULTS: Both interventions resulted in significant positive changes in child sleep, ADHD symptoms, functioning, neuropsychological tests and parental sleep quality. Significant differences were found between the interventions in selective attention, peer problems and anxiety scores in favor of the SH + PMR group. CONCLUSION: SH may have positive effects on various clinical parameters as well as sleep problems in children with ADHD. Addition of PMR to SH may lead to further improvements in anxiety, peer problems and selective attention. SH and PMR may be a useful tool in the clinical management of children with ADHD with sleep problems.",

METHODS: The prospective randomized controlled study was conducted between March and September 2022 with 69 patients (intervention group: 34 patients, control group: 35 patients) in a hospital chemotherapy unit. During the data collection process, the \"Personal Information Form\" and \"Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI)\" were utilized. Patients in the intervention group performed PMRE twice a day for 8 weeks. Patients in the control group received routine care at the clinic without additional intervention. For data analysis, Student's t-test, Mann-Whitney U test, Fisher's exact test, and chi-square test were used. RESULTS: The sociodemographic attributes of patients within both the intervention and control groups exhibited comparability. However, notable distinctions emerged in the PSQI Global sleep score and PSQI subdimension scores, encompassing sleep latency and duration, subjective sleep quality, habitual sleep efficiency, sleep disturbance, and daytime dysfunction between the two groups. The study found a notable difference in scores between the patients in the intervention group and those in the control group. The patients who received the intervention had significantly lower scores (P < .001).

      "abstract": "In this study, university students with premenstrual syndrome (PMS) were evaluated for their responses to the practices of yoga and progressive muscle relaxation (PMR) to combat PMS, and the depression, anxiety, and stress associated with it. A total of 68 students participated in a randomized controlled trial. They were divided into four parallel groups: a yoga intervention group (n = 17), a PMR intervention group (n = 17), a yoga and PMR intervention group (n = 17), and a control group (n = 17). Data were collected between April 2022 and June 2022, from students who practiced only yoga, who practiced only PMR, and who practiced both yoga and PMR. A Personal Information Form, the PMS Scale, and the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale were used as measurement tools. The yoga and yoga + PMR groups had lower scores for the PMS Scale in the posttest than the other groups (p < .05). Depression, anxiety, and stress sub-dimension mean scores were lower in the yoga, PMR + yoga, and PMR groups compared to the control group (p < .05). The results suggest that yoga and PMR interventions are beneficial non-pharmacological treatments for PMS, depression, anxiety, and stress.Clinical Registration Name, Registration Number, Registration Date: The Effects of Yoga and Progressive Muscle Relaxation Exercises on Premenstrual Syndrome, NCT05396976, April 5, 2022.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Older adults encounter serious psychological challenges in addition to physical problems. Reducing stress and anxiety, along with promoting happiness, is critical to maintaining the mental health of the elderly. Jacobson's Progressive Muscle Relaxation (JPMR) will lead to peace of mind by relieving physical stress. The present study aimed to investigate the effect of JPMR on the anxiety and happiness of older adults. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A single-group pretest-posttest design as a type of quasi-experimental study was conducted on 34 older adults living in a nursing home in Rasht, the north of Iran, in 2021. The intervention was performed one session per week, for 8 weeks. The research instruments included the Geriatric Anxiety Inventory (GAI) and the Oxford Happiness Inventory (OHI). Descriptive statistics and the Wilcoxon test were used for data analysis. RESULTS: After the intervention, the Mean (Standard Deviation [SD](of anxiety was 4.91 (1.96), and the Mean (SD) (of happiness was 37.18 (7.92). The mean score of anxiety among older adults after the intervention was significantly lower compared to the before intervention (Z = -4.73, p < 0.001). In addition, the mean score of happiness of the samples after the intervention was significantly higher compared to the before intervention (Z = -5.09, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: JPMR has a positive effect on reducing anxiety and promoting happiness in the elderly. Developing training programs and allocating time to non-pharmacological treatments such as JPMR for the elderly living in nursing homes will help make them happier and healthier."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The rise in the prevalence of mental health problems among adults worldwide has raised concerns, highlighting the critical need for evidence-based mental health interventions that are accessible, comprehensive, and effective. Previous research suggests that Progressive Muscle Relaxation (PMR) is a promising intervention widely used to reduce mental health problems. Nevertheless, the current literature on the efficacy of PMR among adults globally is fragmented, indicating a potential gap in this research area. Hence, this paper aims to systematically compile the research evidence on the efficacy of PMR in adults for stress, anxiety, and depression. METHODS: The Scopus, Web of Sciences, PubMed, PsycINFO, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched from the earliest available evidence to 28th March 2023. The PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items of Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses) guidelines were followed, and the protocol was registered on the Open Science Framework. Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) Critical Appraisal Tools were used to assess the quality of the included studies. RESULTS: A total of forty-six (46) publications from sixteen (16) countries covering more than 3402 adults were included in the review. The results show that PMR are effective in reducing stress, anxiety, and depression in adults. When PMR is combined with other interventions, the combined techniques have also consistently exhibited enhanced efficacy. Moreover, findings also indicate that the efficacy of PMR is heightened when implemented in conjunction with other interventions, surpassing its standalone efficacy. FUNDING AND REGISTRATION: This research was supported/funded by the Ministry of Higher Education (MoHE) under the Fundamental Research Grant Scheme (FRGS) (FRGS/1/2020/SS0/UTM/02/23).

METHODS: The present study was a randomized, controlled, experimental trial. Participants were asked to complete the Prenatal Attachment Inventory (PAI) and the Edinburgh Postpartum Depression Scale (EPDS) at 35 weeks of pregnancy. Group assignment was done by stratified block randomization according to EPDS score (0-9, 10-30) and parity. Women in the experimental group received training in progressive muscle relaxation, postpartum depression, and maternal attachment via online video calls twice a week starting at 36-37 weeks of pregnancy. They were asked to complete the PMRE program from 36 weeks of pregnancy until 6 months postpartum, and online counseling was provided throughout this period. Participants completed the Maternal Postpartum Attachment Scale (MPAS) and the EPDS at 6 weeks postpartum. RESULTS: Mean PAI score was 64.24 ± 9.61 in the experimental group before the intervention and 62.14 ± 10.13 in the control group. The mean EPDS score of the experimental group was 9.12 ± 5.05 and the mean score of the control group was 9.77 ± 6.30 (P > 0.05). The mean MPAS score after the intervention was 13.92 ± 5.54 in the experimental group and 17.51 ± 6.12 in the control group. The mean EPDS score of the experimental group was 3.40 ± 3.00 and the mean score of the control group was 11.40 ± 5.91 (P < 0.05).

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Empirical evidence has shown that virtual reality (VR) scenarios can increase the effects of relaxation techniques, reducing anxiety by enabling people to experience emotional conditions in more vivid settings. OBJECTIVE: This pilot randomized controlled study aims to investigate whether the progressive muscle relaxation technique (PMRT) associated with a personalized scenario in VR promotes psychological well-being and facilitates the recall of relaxing images more than the standard complementary intervention that involves the integration of PMRT and guided imagery (GI). METHODS: On the basis of a longitudinal, between-subject design, 72 university students were randomly exposed to one of two experimental conditions: (1) standard complementary procedure (PMRT and GI exposure) and (2) experimental procedure (PMRT and personalized VR exposure). Individuals were assessed by a therapist before and after 7 training sessions based on measures investigating anxiety, depression, quality of life, coping strategies, sense of presence, engagement, and side effects related to VR exposure. Heart rate data were also collected. RESULTS: Differences in changes between the 2 groups after the in vivo PMRT session conducted by the psychotherapist (T1) were statistically significant for state anxiety (F1,67=30.56; P<.001) and heart rate (F1,67=4.87; P=.01). Individuals in the VR group obtained lower scores both before (t67=-2.63; P=.01; Cohen d=0.91) and after (t67=-7.23; P<.001; Cohen d=2.45) the relaxation session when it was self-administered by participants (T2). A significant reduction in perceived state anxiety at T1 and T2 was observed for both groups (P<.001). After the VR experience, individuals reported feeling higher engagement in the experience than what was mentioned by participants in the GI group (F1,67=2.85; P=.03; ηp2=0.15), and they experienced the environment as more realistic (F1,67=4.38; P=.003; ηp2=0.21). No differences between groups regarding sense of presence were found (F1,67=1.99; P=.11; ηp2=0.11). Individuals exposed before to the VR scenario (T1) referred to perceiving the scenario recalled in-imagination at T2 as more realistic than what those in the GI group experienced (F1,67=3.21; P=.02; ηp2=0.12). The VR group had lower trait anxiety levels than the GI group after the relaxation session during session 7 (T2; t67=-2.43; P=.02). CONCLUSIONS: Personalized relaxing VR scenarios can contribute to improving relaxation and decreasing anxiety when integrated with PMRT as a complementary relaxation method.

The purpose of this trial was to evaluate the effectiveness of the progressive muscle relaxation (PMR) technique in reducing CRP in patients receiving palliative care. METHODS: A total of 148 patients diagnosed with cancer and receiving palliative care were randomly allocated to either an intervention or control group. The intervention group received a 4-week daily course of PMR technique, while the control group received only usual care. Data was collected using a demographic and clinical characteristics form, as well as the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI). Blind evaluations were conducted prior to the start of the intervention (T0), at the end of the 4-week PMR intervention (T1), and at 1-month follow-up (T2). RESULTS: The results of this trial demonstrated a significant decrease in pain intensity scores for the PMR group compared to the control group at both T1 and T2 (p < 0.05). Furthermore, the PMR group also exhibited significant improvements in pain interference with general activity, mood, relations with others, sleep, and enjoyment of life scores compared to the control group at both T1 and T2 (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The results of this trial suggest that the PMR technique may be an effective intervention for reducing pain intensity and improving pain interference with life activities in cancer patients receiving palliative care. However, further research is needed to provide more robust evidence for the effectiveness of this intervention.Clinical trial registration number: NCT04436705. Registered at ClinicalTrials.gov."

TRIAL DESIGN: This study was based on a 4-arm parallel-group, randomized control design. METHODS: Sixty-four participants diagnosed with essential hypertension were randomly allocated into SBE, PMR, SBE-PMR, and Control groups, with 16 subjects each. All 3 groups received different treatments according to their name; however, the Control group received no treatment. Systolic and diastolic BP (SBP and DBP), HR, RR, and anxiety were all evaluated as the study outcomes using a digital sphygmomanometer and perceived stress scale (PSS) at baseline (pretest), 2nd week and 4th weeks post-intervention. A repeated measure analysis of variance test assessed intra-group comparison (overall) analyses across multiple time points. Bonferroni multiple comparison tests were used to analyze the mean differences between the groups. The confidence interval was kept at 95% for all the statistical analyses, that is, P < .05 is considered significant. RESULTS: There was a significant change in the HR (F = 239.04, P = .0001), RR (F = 167.74, P = .0001), SBP (F = 266.64, P = .0001), DSP (F = 279.80, P = .0001), and PSS (F = 473.42, P = .0001) as an outcome of baseline measurements versus (vs) the following weeks. There were significant (F = 48.57, P = .001) differences among different training on HR. The SBE vs SBE-PMR showed an insignificant difference (F = 48.54, P = 1.000). The RR showed significant differences (F = 32.05, 0.0001) between the SBE vs PMR, SBE vs Control, PMR vs Control, and SBE-PMR vs Control groups and insignificant differences for the SBE vs SBE-PMR and PMR vs SBE-PMR groups. The SBE vs SBE-PMR groups showed insignificant differences for DPP and SBP. However, PSS showed significant differences (F = 67.12, P = .0001) among the intervention groups except for the PMR and SBE-PMR groups. CONCLUSIONS: The combined interventions of SBEs and progressive muscle relaxation techniques can effectively reduce the heart rate, respiratory rate, BP, and anxiety in essential hypertensive patients compared to both techniques when given alone.",

This study aimed to investigate the feasibility, acceptability and preliminary effects of music intervention combined with progressive muscle relaxation on anxiety, depression, stress, and quality of life among breast and gynaecological cancer patients receiving chemotherapy. METHODS: The study was carried out from March to May 2022 in an oncology hospital in Vietnam. A single-blinded randomized controlled trial was conducted among 24 women with breast and gynaecological cancer undergoing chemotherapy. The intervention group (n = 12) received a face-to-face training program about music listening and progressive muscle relaxation skills. They then performed the self-practice daily at home for three weeks. The control group (n = 12) received standard care, including health assessment, regular health advice and nutrition consultation. Ten participants in the intervention group were interviewed with open-ended questions to explore the acceptability of the intervention. Anxiety, depression and stress were measured using the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale, while The Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General was used to evaluate the quality of life. The outcome measurements were collected at baseline (T0), post-intervention (3rd week, T1) and follow-up (6th week, T2). Appropriate descriptive statistics were used to depict the outcome measures across study time points. RESULTS: A total of 24 patients were eligible to join, and 20 of them completed the study. Greater reductions in anxiety, depression and stress were observed in the intervention group than in the control group at T1 and T2. Greater improvements on quality of life were found in the intervention group than control group at T1 and T2 with respect to T0. The content analysis supported the acceptable intervention of participants through two themes, perceived beneficial effects on psychological and physical health and willingness to keep practising in the future. CONCLUSIONS: Implementing music intervention combined with progressive muscle relaxation is feasible and had a trend in reducing anxiety, depression and stress levels. A larger scale randomized controlled trial is needed to confirm the effect of the intervention on outcomes. TRIAL REGISTRATION: This trial was registered on ClinicalTrials.gov with ID: NCT05262621.",

The present study aimed to compare the effect of internet-delivered short-term PMR (iPMR) and psychoeducation on mindful ability (MA), visceral hypersensitivity (VH), and symptoms of patients with IBS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This randomized clinical trial was performed on individuals with IBS in 2020, recruiting a total of 60 patients fulfilling the inclusion criteria. Prior to the intervention, the Freiburg Questionnaire- Short Form (FMI-SF), the Visceral Sensitivity Questionnaire (VSI), and the Gastrointestinal Symptoms Rating Scale (GSRS) were filled out for the patients. Patients were divided into iPMR and psychoeducation groups randomly. All training in both groups was accomplished via WhatsApp social network. FMI-SF, VSI, and GSRS questionnaires for patients were completed 1 month (post-test) and 2 months later (follow-up). The data was analyzed by SPSS-23 software and one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). RESULTS: Compared to the psychoeducation group, the MA of the iPMR group increased significantly in post-test and follow-up (43.06 ± 7.12 and 42.88 ± 6.28 vs 51.23 ± 11.7 and 56.74 ± 12.36 and P < 0.001) and their VH decreased significantly (37.85 ± 11.6 and 38.03 ± 11.8 vs 26.9 ± 6.45 and 22.46 ± 5.32 and P < 0.001). Also, their GSRS had significant decreases (43.27 ± 10.73 and 41.18 ± 9.31 vs 32.33 ± 8.21 and 25.79 ± 6.30 and P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: The findings showed iPMR in patients with IBS, in spite of a few sessions and internet-delivered approach, increased MA and decreased VH and gastrointestinal symptoms of them."

Tremor is a common movement disorder that can affect this patient population. The purpose of this case report was to describe the effects that progressive muscle relaxation, meditation, and mental practice-based interventions have on the treatment of chronic right upper extremity tremor in a patient post-TBI. CASE DESCRIPTION: A 47-year-old male with a traumatic brain injury presented with a resting and postural tremor of the right wrist flexors and deficits in cognition, sensation, proprioception, balance, and motor function. The patient's primary goal for therapy was to decrease the tremor to improve his quality of life and ability to perform activities of daily living. METHODS: Progressive muscle relaxation, breath-focused meditation, and mental practice-based intervention were administered to the patient. Active range of motion activities occurred during weekly in-person sessions and daily practice occurred at home. RESULTS: The patient demonstrated improvements in quality of life, self-ratings of tremor severity, ratings of tremor impact on ADL's, gross motor object manipulation, frequency of tremor via surface electromyography, and visual inspection of a spirograph. CONCLUSION: A combination of progressive muscle relaxation, meditation, and mental practice-based interventions appeared to positively impact tremor across physical and psychosocial domains in a patient with a chronic tremor. Further investigation is needed to verify these findings.",

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a randomized controlled trial with two groups and pre-test, post-test, and a two-month follow-up assessment. Included were 27 mothers randomly assigned to either the transdiagnostic therapy group or the PMR group (13 in the transdiagnostic group and 14 in the PMR group). The experimental group received eight sessions of transdiagnostic therapy while the control group received eight sessions of PMR. The participants completed the following scales: Emotion Regulation Questionnaire, Self-Compassion Scale, Maternal Role Adaptation Scale, and Work and Social Adjustment Scale. RESULTS: Transdiagnostic therapy was significantly more effective than PMR in improving emotion regulation strategies, self-compassion, maternal role adaptation, and social and work adjustment based on the between-group comparison conducted at post-test and follow-up (p < 0.01). CONCLUSION: Transdiagnostic therapy was shown to be effective in improving the emotional health of mothers with premature infants and was more effective than PMR techniques.",

      "abstract": "Mirror therapy is a widely used treatment for phantom limb pain (PLP) relief in patients with limb loss. Less common is progressive muscle relaxation (PMR), used mostly in other medical conditions (psychological, terminal cancer pain, etc). The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of a mirror therapy preceded by PMR intervention compared to mirror therapy preceded by unguided generic relaxation-mirror therapy in patients with lower limb amputation suffering from PLP. This pilot study was a single-blind, controlled, randomized trial. Thirty lower limb amputees suffering from PLP were recruited and randomly assigned to three groups respectively undergoing a PMR-mirror therapy rehabilitative intervention, generic relaxation-mirror therapy, and conventional physiotherapy (ConvPT). Selected items from Prosthesis Evaluation Questionnaire (PEQ) and the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) were used to test the pain features at the beginning and 1 week after 3 weeks of intervention. A decrease of about 65% was found in the rate and duration of PLP at the PEQ in PMR-mirror therapy with respect to generic relaxation-mirror therapy (about 30%) and ConvPT (about 6%). A decrease of about 90% in intensity (worst and average) of PLP in PMR-mirror therapy when compared to generic relaxation-mirror therapy (about 45%) and ConvPT (about 20%) was found at the BPI. We preliminary concluded, albeit with limitations due to the small sample of patients, that mirror therapy can improve PLP when associated with PMR. Further studies are required to confirm that PMR could be an effective technique for more successful PLP management.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Virtual reality (VR) is an innovative tool that can facilitate exposure to either stressful or relaxing stimuli and enables individuals who have difficulties visualizing scenes to be involved in a more realistic sensorimotor experience. It also facilitates multisensory stimulation, a sense of presence, and achievement of relaxation. VR scenarios representing visual and auditory elements of natural relaxing environments can facilitate the learning of relaxation techniques such as the progressive muscle relaxation technique (PMRT). A complementary standardized technique deployed to reduce anxiety symptoms is the integration of PMRT and guided imagery (GI). Exposure to a pleasant imaginary environment helps the establishment of an association between a relaxing scenario and the relaxation technique, consequently promoting relaxation. Empirical evidence has shown that VR scenarios can increase the effects of relaxation techniques by enabling people to experience emotional conditions in more vivid settings. OBJECTIVE: The main aim of this pilot study protocol is to investigate the impact on state anxiety of PMRT, associated with a personalized relaxing scenario in VR, and the role of VR scenarios in facilitating the recall of relaxing images and a sense of presence. A secondary aim is to understand if relaxing sessions administered via Zoom are more effective for managing anxiety and stress than a procedural setting based on audio-track guidance. METHODS: Based on a longitudinal, between-subject design, 108 university students will be randomly exposed to one of three experimental conditions: (1) PMRT via Zoom and GI exposure, (2) PMRT via Zoom and personalized VR exposure, and (3) PMRT based on audio-track guidance and personalized VR exposure. Individuals are assessed before and after 7 training sessions based on self-report questionnaires investigating anxiety, depression, quality of life, coping strategies, sense of presence, engagement, and side effects related to VR exposure. Heart rate data are also detected by an Mi Band 2 sensor. RESULTS: The experimental procedure is ongoing. In this paper, preliminary data from a sample of 40 participants will be illustrated. The experimental phase is expected to conclude in May 2023, and the final results of the research will be presented in June 2023. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study will help shape the experimental design to apply it on a subsequent randomized controlled trial, also considering clinical samples. This work is expected to measure whether VR is a more engaging and helpful technique in promoting relaxation and decreasing anxiety levels than GI, by making the visualization process easier and by helping people to face more realistic sensory experiences. Assessing the efficacy of the PMRT in alternative delivery modes may extend its applications, especially in situations where the standard procedure is more challenging to be administered. To our knowledge, no equivalent study has been published so far on this matter. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT05478941; https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT05478941.

Progressive muscle relaxation (PMR) exercises show promising treatment effects on mental health and sleep problems and overall QoL in COVID-19 patients. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of PMR exercises in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: Both experimental and non-experimental studies related to PMR and COVID-19 were systematically searched in the PubMed, Cochrane Library, PEDro and HINARI databases for studies published from the occurrence of the pandemic to December 2022. Study selection, methodological quality assessment and data extraction were carried out by 2 independent authors. Efficacy outcomes were evaluated for sleep quality, anxiety, depression, and QoL. The safety outcomes were evaluated based on adverse events reported. Review manager (RevMan 5.4, Cochrane collaboration) was used for the data analysis. RESULTS: Four studies with 227 subjects were included in this systematic review. The pooled results indicated that PMR interventions improved the sleep quality score standardized mean difference (SMD): -0.23; 95% confidence interval (CI): -0.54, 0.07; P = .13, level of anxiety SMD: -1.35; 95% CI -2.38, -0.32; P = .01 compared to the usual care. Depression level, disease severity and QoL were also improved following PMR interventions. Only 1 study reported worsening of 1 patient clinical status while all other studies did not report any adverse events during the interventions. CONCLUSIONS: PMR interventions can improve the sleep quality, anxiety, depression, disease severity and QoL in patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 in a short-term period compared to the usual care. However, there was indecision about the safety and long-term effects of PMR.",

To this end, the present study examined the effect of movement therapy and progressive muscle relaxation on the depression rate in depressed patients. In the present interventional study, 60 patients diagnosed with major depression and hospitalized at Moradi Hospital's psychiatric ward in Rafsanjan in 2020, with an age of at least 20 years, were randomly divided into two groups: the intervention group and the control group. The subjects in the intervention group attended 30 sessions of 30-45 mins, with the researcher performing a movement therapy program followed by 15 to 20 minutes of progressive muscle relaxation. The Beck Depression Inventory was used to measure the degree of depression along with clinical pre-and post-intervention interviews. The mean depression scores were 37.26±7.70 and 36.93±8.166 for the participants in the intervention group and control group before the intervention, indicating no statistically significant intergroup difference (P=0.871). The mean depression scores after the intervention for the subjects in the intervention group and control group were 8.01±5.22 and 22.96±9.43, respectively. The results showed a statistically significant difference between the groups (P=0.001), with a greater decrease in depression scores in the intervention group compared to the control group.

The participants were evaluated, before and after the intervention, by the following means: Competitive State Anxiety Inventory-2 (CSAI-2), to measure the pre-competitive anxiety state, i.e., how anxious each athlete felt just before the competition; Brunel Mood Scale (BRUMS), an instrument for early detection of overtraining syndrome; Recovery-Stress Questionnaire for Athletes (RESTQ-Sport), to identify the extent to which each athlete was physically or mentally stressed and the athlete's current capability for recovery; Athlete Burnout Questionnaire (ABQ), specifically developed for athletes. The IG athletes participated in 12 progressive muscle relaxation sessions, a practice for tensing or tightening a specific muscle until an ideal state of relaxation is reached. Each participant had blood pressure and heart rate measured before and after every session. The CG athletes were evaluated similarly to those in the IG but without relaxation. The results showed statistically significant differences in cognitive anxiety (p = 0.039) and specific stress (p = 0.016) between CG and IG before the intervention; in addition, a significant heart rate decrease (p < 0.01) between IG and CG was noted.",

From this perspective, it is of utmost importance to develop quick and effective intervention strategies to prevent numerous complications. This study aimed to investigate the effect of the progressive muscle relaxation technique, using the demonstration method on the stress and anxiety of nurses who care for COVID-19 patients. METHODS: This randomized clinical trial was conducted in 2021. Forty-six nurses working in two referral hospitals with wards for COVID-19 patients in Tehran, Iran recruited by convenience sampling method and then randomly assigned to experimental or control groups. The nurses in the experimental group educated the progressive muscle relaxation by the demonstration method, and they were encouraged to practice it. The Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-21 was utilized to measure the stress and anxiety levels in the nurses. RESULTS: Before the intervention, the levels of stress in the experimental and control groups were 13.91 ± 2.41 vs. 14.34 ± 2.74 (p = 0.571), and their anxiety was 13.34 ± 3.41 vs. 12.78 ± 2.21 (p = 0.510), respectively. After the intervention, the levels of stress in the experimental and control groups were 10.95 ± 2.01 vs. 14.17 ± 2.34 (p < 0.001), and their anxiety was 9.47 ± 2.37 vs. 12.91 ± 1.85 (p < 0.001), respectively. Moreover, the levels of stress and anxiety in the experimental group significantly diminished after intervention (p < 0.001), but no significant changes were observed in the control group (p > 0.05). CONCLUSION: Concerning the effectiveness of the progressive muscle relaxation technique in relieving the stress and anxiety of the nurses caring for COVID-19 patients, it is suggested to include this relaxation technique in nursing courses.",

Meta-analysis was performed using RevMan 5.4. RESULTS: Twelve RCTs sampling 1147 patients were included. PMRT showed significant effects of alleviating anxiety [standardized mean difference (SMD) = -1.32, 95% CI (-1.88, -0.75), P < 0.001] and pain [SMD = -1.02, 95% CI (-1.93, -0.11), P = 0.030], and improving QOL [SMD = 1.65, 95% CI (0.53, 2.76), P = 0.004] in cancer patients. Regarding depression, self-esteem, nausea, and vomiting, PMRT showed better effects compared to the control group. However, no significant effect of reducing fatigue was detected [SMD = -1.00, 95% CI (-2.27, 0.27), P = 0.120]. The overall quality of evidence was moderate to very low. CONCLUSION: PMRT is a promising complementary therapy that may improve the health-related outcomes of cancer patients. Future studies with rigorous research design are needed to obtain valid conclusions.",

DESIGN: A randomized controlled experimental design. METHODS: The experimental group was informed about progressive muscle relaxation (PMR) and an audio recording was provided. After the colonoscopy, abdominal pain (Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) pain) and distension (VAS distension) scores were assessed, then PMR was applied for 30 minutes and pain scores were determined again. VAS pain and VAS distension scores of the control group were determined after colonoscopy and 30 minutes later. VAS abdominal pain and VAS distension scores were evaluated at the 2nd, 4th, 8th, 12th, 16th, and 24th hour after the procedure on all patients. The day after the colonoscopy, post-test data were collected. FINDINGS: The pretest VAS pain and VAS distension mean scores were similar in the intervention and control groups (P > .05). The mean VAS pain and VAS distension scores decreased significantly in the intervention group post procedure (P < .05).

Although progressive muscle relaxation and guided imagery have been reported to improve emotional and physical health, the use of such approaches among nursing students rarely exist. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to examine the deferential effects of progressive muscle relaxation [PMR] and guided imagery [GI] on physical and emotional symptoms in nursing students taking their initial clinical training. METHODS: Using a three-group, randomized, single blinded study conducted in a large Jordanian university, 156 nursing students were randomly allocated into one of three study groups (PMR group, GI group, and control group). The physical symptoms and emotional symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress were assessed at baseline and end of the intervention. The study protocol was registered in ClinicalTrail.gov, identifier: xxxxxx. RESULTS: Using one-way MANOVA and post-hoc comparisons, the results showed that PMR and GI significantly reduced more physical symptoms than control condition although PMR was more effective than GI in this regard. GI significantly decreased more emotional symptoms such as anxiety, depression, and stress than PMR and control condition. PMR decreased anxiety, depression, and stress but the results were not statistically significant. CONCLUSION: The findings of this study support the ABC relaxation theory claiming that PMR im-proves better physical symptoms while GI improves better emotional symptoms. However, further studies using students from multiple settings are needed."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Test anxiety is prevalent among medical students and leads to impaired academic performance. Test-related attentional bias has been identified as an important maintaining factor in test-anxious individuals. AIM: To evaluate whether hypnosis and progressive muscle relaxation (PMR) could modify medical college students' test anxiety and attentional bias. METHODS: A total of 598 medical students were screened. The participants were divided into higher and lower test anxiety groups according to their scores on the test anxiety scale (TAS). Ninety medical college students with high TAS score were randomly assigned to a hypnosis or PMR group. Another 45 students with low TAS score were included, forming a baseline control group. The intervention was conducted weekly for 6 wk, and each session lasted approximately 30 min. The total intervention time and the number of intervention sessions for the hypnosis and PMR groups were equal. Data were collected at the pretest, posttest, and 2-mo follow-up. RESULTS: Hypnosis group participants had a significantly lower TAS score at posttest (t = -21.827, P < 0.001) and at follow-up (t = -14.824, P < 0.001), compared to that at pretest. PMR group participants also had a significantly lower TAS score at posttest (t = -10.777, P < 0.001) and at follow-up (t = -7.444, P < 0.001), compared to that at pretest. At the posttest level, the hypnosis group had a significantly lower TAS score than the PMR group (t = -3.664, P < 0.001). At the follow-up level, the hypnosis group also had a significantly lower TAS score than the PMR group (t = -2.943, P = 0.004). Clinically significant improvement was found in both the hypnosis and PMR groups (hypnosis = 64.0%; PMR = 62.22%). Hypnosis was more effective than PMR in reducing test anxiety among medical college students. Hypnosis could modify attentional bias toward threatening stimuli, but PMR could not. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that attentional bias plays an important role in test anxiety treatment."

METHODS: This study is a single-center, pretest-posttest, randomized controlled trial with a factorial design. The research sample consists of 108 women who were randomly divided into three groups: HE + PMR group (n = 36), PMR group (n = 36) and control group (n = 36). 90 women completed the study. The data were collected in three steps by using instruments of Personal Information Form, Visual Analog Scale and a diary for vasomotor symptoms, Women's Health Initiative Insomnia Rating Scale. RESULTS: Hot flash and night sweats frequency and severity scores/24 h, the VAS scores for hot flashes and night sweats, and the WHIIRS scores significantly improved more in the intervention groups compared to the control group (p &lt; 0,05). Compared to the group PMR, the group PMR + HE had a greater improvement with larger effect size in all measurements. CONCLUSIONS: PMR and HE counseling by nurses benefit perimenopausal women who suffer from insomnia and vasomotor symptoms. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: PMR combined with HE or PMR alone is effective in managing vasomotor symptoms and insomnia; therefore, they can easily be integrated into clinical practice.",

The present study was designed to determine the effectiveness of Jacobson's progressive muscle relaxation technique on maternal, fetal, and neonatal outcomes in women with non-severe preeclampsia (PE). METHODS: This is a randomized clinical trial conducted from March 21, 2021 to July 22, 2021 in the Kamali referral center in Karaj, Iran. A total of 88 eligible participants were assigned to intervention and control groups (44 in each group) via blocked randomization. The intervention group (6 groups of 6 participants and one group of 8 participants) received Jacobson's progressive muscle relaxation technique in addition to receiving routine care, twice a week for 6 weeks (4 face-to-face sessions and 8 online sessions). The control group only received routine perinatal care. A checklist collected data before and after the intervention. Data were analyzed in SPSS software v.23. To analyze the obtained data, independent t-test, Paired t-test, Mann-Whitney, Chi-square, and Fisher test were used. RESULTS: The results showed a statistically significant difference between intervention and control groups in terms of Systolic Blood pressure (SBP) (P < 0.001), Diastolic Blood pressure (DBP) (P < 0.001), 24-hour urine protein level (proteinuria) (P < 0.001). and Fasting Blood Sugar (FBS) (P < 0.001), birth Weight (BW) (P = 0.01), baseline Fetal heart rate (BFHR) (P < 0.001) and Number fetal movements based on non-stress test (NFMsN), during 20 min (P < 0.001) after intervention (P < 0.001).Also In the intervention group, the results showed a statistically significant difference in Amniotic Fluid Index (AFI) (P = 0.01), SBP(P < 0.001), DBP(P < 0.001), proteinuria (P < 0.001), FBS(P < 0.001), BFHR based on non-stress test (NST) (P < 0.001), and NFMsN during 20 min (P < 0.001) in the intervention group before and after the intervention. There was no statistically significant difference in the control group. CONCLUSION: This study's results showed the effectiveness of progressive muscle relaxation technique on the improvement of SBP, DBP, proteinuria, FBS, FHR and NFMsN during 20 min based on NST and BW in women with non-severe PE. Therefore, it is recommended to perform this technique in health centers."

In response to COVID-19 quarantine, stress, anxiety, and depression may easily develop which negatively affect immunity and decrease the patient's response against the COVID-19 virus. This study investigated the effect of an integrated intervention combining cognitive-behavioural stress management (CBSM) and progressive muscle relaxation (PMRs) on immune biomarkers and disease severity and progression in patients with COVID-19 and the period to which these changes last. Thirty patients with mild or moderate COVID-19 were randomly distributed into intervention and control groups. The intervention group performed an integrated intervention combining CBSM and PMRs. There were three outcome measures including blood immune markers, salivary immunoglobulin A, and Wisconsin scale (WIS). Two-week post-intervention, there were significant differences between groups in the WIS total score, Leucocytes, Lymphocytes, Interleukin-6, and Immunoglobulin-A. While there were non-significant differences between both groups in Interleukin-10 and TNF-α. The significant differences between groups in the WIS total score, Leucocytes, Lymphocytes, Interleukin-6, and Immunoglobulin-A significantly continued 1 week as a follow-up. This study concluded that performing an integrated intervention combining CBSM and PMRs for 2 weeks significantly increases immune biomarkers mainly Leucocytes, Lymphocytes, Interleukin-10, and Interleukin-6 along with S-IgA. Also, this protocol significantly decreases disease severity and associated stress, anxiety, and depression; and enhances the quality of life in patients with COVID-19.

METHODS: This was a nonrandomized controlled trial. Eligible patients had a primary or recurrent gynecological malignancy scheduled to be treated with surgery. The intervention consisted of three sessions (preoperation, postoperation, and predischarge) during the perioperative period. Firstly, before starting the first session of intervention, all patients completed three questionnaires including a Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), a Herth Hope Index (HHI), and a State Anxiety Inventory (SAI), and the intervention group patients also had to complete the SAI questionnaire again after completing the intervention. Secondly, after the second session of intervention, all patients completed the SAI questionnaire, with the intervention group completed the SAI questionnaire before the intervention. Thirdly, after the third session of intervention, all patients completed HHI and SAI questionnaires, with the intervention group completed the SAI questionnaire before the intervention. Also, to subjectively rate the benefit of expressive arts therapy, the intervention group additionally completed a separate, supplemental questionnaire. RESULTS: A total of 116 patients were enrolled and 110 included in the final analysis. No group differences were found for HHI scores between the intervention and control participants (Cohen's d = 0.19, P=0.31), although there was a substantial improvement in intervention participants' HHI scores compared to the standard care control participants. There was a statistically significant improvement in intervention participants' SAI from preintervention to postintervention of preoperation (Cohen's d = -0.23, P=0.002) and postoperation (Cohen's d = -0.34, P ≤ 0.001). However, no differences were observed for the predischarge period (Cohen's d = -0.09, P=0.118). Besides, a supplemental questionnaire indicated that 52 (98%) patients felt that expressive arts therapy was beneficial. CONCLUSIONS: Expressive art therapy combined with progressive muscle relaxation under music may be of some effect on alleviating perioperative anxiety in patients with gynecologic malignancies. Therefore, further relevant studies with large samples and multicenters are urgently needed to provide a reliable evidence-based basis for perioperative psychological care of patients with gynecologic malignancies and to promote rapid recovery of patients. It is recommended that further art therapy studies to examine the impact of patient-tailored arts therapy interventions on spiritual well-being in patients with gynecological malignancies, especially in the perioperative period."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Pediatric nursing students are expected to work hard to help children realize their full potential by giving care, knowing their growth process, and being responsive to their needs. Students should be able to communicate effectively and solve problems. Nurses who care for pediatric patients experience compassion fatigue as well as moderate to severe levels of work-related stress. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of progressive muscle relaxation exercise on anxiety among nursing students during pediatric nursing clinical training. METHODS: A quasi-experimental, pre-post study was conducted in the faculty of nursing at the Arab American University/Palestine. The sample of the study consists of 60 nursing students enrolled in the pediatric nursing course were selected through convenience sampling. This study was conducted on one group of nursing students that received Jacobson's progressive muscle relaxation exercise for five consecutive days per week for two weeks before entering the clinical environment. The S-anxiety scale (STAI Form Y-1) was applied to collect data before and after the intervention. RESULTS: The magnitude of anxiety after the progressive muscle relaxation exercise was greater reduced than before (t (59) = 21.1, P < 0.05). There was less anxiety post the program (M = 1.34 ± 0.36) than pre- program (M = 2.83 ± 0.35). CONCLUSION: The study findings indicated the positive influence of progressive muscle relaxation exercise on nursing students' anxiety levels in pediatric clinical settings. As a result, it is recommended that teaching programs on this approach be conducted for nursing students at nursing schools prior to the commencement of pediatric clinical practice in order to lessen anxiety."

      "abstract": "Sleep is critical for health, cognition, and restorative processes, and yet, many experience chronic sleep restriction. Sleep interventions have been designed to enhance overnight sleep quality and physiology. Components of these interventions, like relaxation-based progressive muscle relaxation (PMR), have been studied in isolation and have shown direct effects on sleep architecture, including increasing time in restorative, slow-wave sleep (SWS). These relaxation methods have been understudied in naps, which are effective fatigue countermeasures that reduce deleterious effects of chronic sleep restriction. We hypothesised that PMR should boost SWS in a nap, as compared to an active control. We used a between-subject design in which healthy young adults underwent PMR training or listened to Mozart music (control) prior to a 90-min nap opportunity. We assessed changes in the amount and lateralisation of SWS, as evidence suggests left hemispheric lateralisation may be a proxy for recuperative sleep needs, and changes to state-dependent anxiety and fatigue before and after the nap to assess intervention success. We found PMR participants spent ~10 min more in SWS, equivalent to 125% more time, than the control group, and concomitantly, significantly less time in rapid eye movement sleep. PMR participants also had greater right lateralised slow-wave activity and delta activity compared to the control suggesting a more well-rested brain profile during sleep. Further, pre-sleep anxiety levels predicted nap architecture in the intervention group, suggesting benefits may be impacted by anxiety. The feasibility and accessibility of PMR prior to a nap make this an interesting research avenue to pursue with strong translational application.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Low self-esteem and inefficiency are major problems in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients. A progressive muscle relaxation technique is one of the complementary therapies. The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of progressive muscle relaxation techniques on self-esteem and self-efficacy in MS patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This clinical trial was conducted on 100 MS patients were randomly divided into two groups of experimental (n = 50) and control (n = 50). The experimental group received progressive muscle relaxation techniques in eight 60-min sessions twice a week for 4 weeks. Rosenberg's Self-Esteem Scale and Self-Efficacy Scales of MS patients were completed before, immediately, and 4 weeks after the intervention. Data were analyzed using the SPSS software version 16. RESULTS: The mean score of self-esteem was not significantly different between the control (26.02 ± 5.83) and experimental (26.40 ± 6.06) groups before intervention (P = 0.247). The mean score of self-esteem in the control group (27.16 ± 7.45) and the experimental group (29.06 ± 6.61) immediately after the intervention (P = 0.083) was not significantly different. 4 weeks after the intervention, the mean scores of self-esteem in the control (26.96 ± 8.33) and the experimental (29.98 ± 7.02) groups were significantly different (P = 0.012). The mean score of self-efficacy was significantly different between the control (41.62 ± 4.46) and experimental (39.32 ± 4.31) groups before intervention (P = 0.010). The mean scores of self-efficacy in the control group (38.38 ± 5.07) and the experimental group (44 ± 4.46) immediately after the intervention (P < 0.001) and 4 weeks after intervention showed a significant difference between the control group (38.04 ± 5.46) and the experimental (46.40 ± 5.04) groups (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Due to the effect of progressive muscle relaxation on self-esteem and self-efficacy of MS patients, its safety and simplicity, this technique can be used as a complementary therapy to enhance the level of self-esteem and self-efficacy of MS patients."

We investigated the effects of progressive muscle relaxation (PMR) on postoperative pain, fatigue, and vital signs in patients with head and neck cancers. METHODS: All patients were hospitalized and randomly assigned to intervention or usual care groups. A generalized estimating equation was used to evaluate the PMR effects on pain and symptoms across the preoperative day to postoperative day 10. RESULTS: The PMR group displayed significantly lower overall pain and muscle tightness than control group along with the timeline of multiple measurements (p < 0.01). PMR significantly reduces sleep disturbances and levels of fatigue, anxiety, and depression compared with the control group with time trend (p < 0.01). PMR also lowered the respiratory rates and diastolic blood pressure (p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: PMR can reduce sleep disturbances and levels of pain, fatigue, muscle tightness, anxiety, and depression in patients with head and neck cancer undergoing major surgeries. Future study should focus on improving the effectiveness of the exercise and standardization of the application.

METHOD: This study was a three-arm, parallel, randomized controlled trial. 120 patients who underwent CABG surgery at two academic hospitals in an urban area of Iran were randomly allocated into three groups (40 per group): the BR, PMR, and control groups. Patients in the BR and the PMR groups performed relevant exercises twice a day for four weeks. Sleep quality was measured before and immediately after the intervention using Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. RESULTS: Within-group comparison in the BR (t = 3.51, p = 0.001) and the PMR (t = 4.58, p < 0.001) group showed that the overall sleep quality showed a significant improvement after the intervention when compared to baseline. The between-group comparison showed that both the BR and PMR groups showed significant improvements in subjective sleep quality (F = 3.75, p = 0.02), habitual sleep efficiency (F = 4.81, p = 0.01), and overall sleep quality (F = 5.53, p = 005) when compared to the control group after the intervention. However, no statistically significant differences were identified among the three study groups in terms of sleep latency, sleep duration, sleep disturbances, sleeping medication, and daytime dysfunction after the intervention (p > 0.05). CONCLUSION: The study showed that a four-week program of both PMR and BR can be effective in the overall improvement of sleep quality in patients following CABG.

RESULTS: Eighty-two patients were randomly assigned to receive escitalopram (n = 26), PMRT (n = 28), and placebo (n = 28). PMRT and escitalopram could effectively decrease number and duration of diurnal and nocturnal HFs in patients with breast cancer, with a better effect observed from escitalopram. They could both decrease the total score of MRS. CONCLUSION: Both escitalopram ad PMRT can reveal nocturnal and diurnal HFs in terms of frequency and duration in patients with breast cancer.",

Nurses need nonpharmacological methods rather than drugs to address women's emotional distress during the in vitro fertilization (IVF) process. The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of progressive muscle relaxation exercises and laughter therapy on the mental health and treatment outcomes of women receiving IVF treatment. This parallel-group, randomized controlled trial was conducted in a private IVF center. Participants were randomly assigned to the intervention group (IG; n = 71) and control group (CG; n = 70). The IG received progressive muscle relaxation and laughter therapy for 40 min in each session for 3-4 sessions, whereas the CG received routine care. Data were obtained from the patient information form, State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, Beck Depression Inventory, and medical records. The questionnaire was completed at recruitment (T1) and oocyte pick-up day (T2). In the evaluation performed on the day of the oocyte pick-up, depression and trait anxiety scores of the IG were found to be lower than those in the CG, and the effect size was small. Group × time interaction was significant for depression (large effect size) and trait anxiety (small effect size). The estradiol levels, the number of oocytes, transfer status, and pregnancy rates (according to a blood test) were similar between groups. Women receiving IVF treatment who received progressive muscle relaxation and laughter therapy demonstrated psychological changes; however, the treatment did not affect medical outcomes.",

It is a difficult-to-treat disorder because its exact causes are unknown. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to examine the effect of progressive muscle relaxation therapy (PMRT) on pain, fatigue, and stress in patients with fibromyalgia syndrome. METHODS: Thirty-seven patients with fibromyalgia syndrome (age: 20-65 years) were randomly allocated to the PMRT group (n1= 18, 2 men and 16 women) or non-PMRT group (n2= 19, 2 men and 17 women). The PMRT group received PMRT twice a week for 8 weeks and the non-PMRT group received conventional physical therapies such as electro-stimulation and heat therapies during this period. The outcome was evaluated before and after 8 week sofintervention using the Visual Analogue Scale, Multidimensional Assessment of Fatigue, Perceived Stress Scale, and measurement of the blood pressure and pulse rate. RESULTS: Pain and fatigue significantly decreased in the PMRT group compared with the non-PMRT group (both P< 0.001). In addition, perceived stress (P< 0.001), systolic blood pressure (P< 0.001), diastolic blood pressure (P< 0.05), and pulse rate (P< 0.001) significantly decreased in the PMRT group compared with the non-PMRT group.

This study aimed to examine the effect of progressive muscle relaxation (PMR) exercises on adaptation to old age and the quality of life of older people. METHODS: A randomized controlled trial design was used. The sample consisted of 45 older residents (21 intervention subjects, 24 controls) from a nursing home in a city of Turkey. The intervention group received progressive muscle-relaxation sessions twice weekly for 8 weeks, while the control group received routine care. All PMR exercises were led by the researcher. All participants were evaluated at baseline and after 8 weeks using the Assessment Scale of Adaptation Difficulty for the Elderly and the Nottingham Health Profile. RESULTS: As a result of PMR exercises performed for 8 weeks, the Assessment Scale of Adaptation Difficulty for the Elderly and Nottingham Health Profile total mean scores of the intervention group improved significantly (P < 0.001). No statistically significant difference was observed, however, when comparing the intervention and control groups in terms of the level of adjustment to old age and health-related quality of life, either at baseline or following the intervention (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: The results of this study indicate that progressive muscle relaxation can increase adaptation to old age and the quality of life and of older people in a nursing home.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Persons with multiple sclerosis (PwMS) often have reduced aerobic capacity and report fatigue as the most disabling symptom impacting their health-related quality of life (HRQoL). A multidisciplinary rehabilitation approach is recommended for successful management of symptoms, although there is little supporting evidence. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of a multimodal therapy approach, including endurance training and patient education, during a three-week inpatient rehabilitation stay, on HRQoL in PwMS at six months follow-up. Inpatient energy management education (IEME) + high-intensity interval training (HIIT) will be compared with progressive muscle relaxation (PMR) + moderate continuous training (MCT). METHODS: This study has a two-armed single-blind randomized controlled superiority trial design. One hundred six PwMS-related fatigue (relapsing-remitting or chronic progressive phenotypes; Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) ≤ 6.5) will be recruited at the Valens clinic, Switzerland, and randomized into either an experimental (EG) or a control group (CG). EG: participants will perform IEME twice and HIIT three times per week during the three-week rehabilitation stay. IEME is a group-based intervention, lasting for 6.5 h over three weeks. HIIT contains of five 1.5-min high-intensive exercise bouts on a cycle ergometer at 95-100% of peak heart rate (HRpeak), followed by active breaks of unloaded pedalling for 2 min to achieve 60% of HRpeak. CG: participants will perform PMR twice and MCT three times per week during the three-week rehabilitation stay, representing local usual care. PMR consists of six 1-h relaxation group sessions. MCT consists of 24-min continuous cycling at 65% of HRpeak. The primary outcome is HRQoL (Physical and Mental Component Summaries of the Medical Outcome Study 36-item Short Form Health Survey; SF-36), measured at entry to the clinic (baseline, T0), three weeks after T0 (T1) and at four (T2) and six (T3) months after T0. Secondary outcomes comprise cardiorespiratory fitness, inflammatory markers (measured at T0 and T1), fatigue, mood, self-efficacy, occupational performance, physical activity (measured at T0, T1, T2 and T3) and behaviour changes in energy management (measured at T2 and T3). DISCUSSION: This study will provide detailed information on a multimodal therapy approach to further improve rehabilitation for PwMS. TRIAL REGISTRATION: This trial was prospectively registered at ClinicalTrials.gov ( NCT04356248 ; 22 April 2020).",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Infertility is defined as the failure to achieve clinical pregnancy after 12 months of regular unprotected intercourse. It could be due to male or female factors, each requiring different treatment options. ART treatment exposes couples to numerous psychological stressors. Therefore, it has been recommended by the ESHRE Psychology and Counselling Guideline Development Group recently that psychosocial support should be offered as a complementary therapy during infertility treatments. In this context, the efficiency of different psychological interventions, such as cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT), deep breathing (DB), and progressive muscle relaxation (PMR), was evaluated in several clinical trials in terms of couples' mental health and pregnancy outcomes. OBJECTIVE AND RATIONALE: The neurophysiology of CBT, DB and PMR, which are used in interventional studies, in both men and women undergoing ART, has not yet been fully elucidated. This review represents a comprehensive report, aiming to collate novel insights into the neurobiological processes and physiological mechanisms that occur during the practice of CBT, DB and PMR. SEARCH METHODS: PubMed, Google Scholar and Cochrane Library were interrogated to conduct this comprehensive literature review. The search was carried out using combinations of MeSH terms and keywords: infertility, assisted reproductive techniques, IVF, ICSI, emotions, psychological stress, cognitive behavioural therapy, mind-body therapies and relaxation. Relevant information related to the mechanism of action of stress management techniques were obtained from original articles and reviews published in English without taking into consideration the time of publication. Moreover, as it was not the major focus of the review, only recent systematic reviews (2015-2019) pinpointing the effects of psychological interventions on infertility treatment outcomes were also retrieved from the above-mentioned databases. OUTCOMES: CBT, DB and PMR may modify the activity of stress-related brain regions such as the prefrontal cortex, amygdala, hypothalamus and hippocampus, as demonstrated by functional MRI and electroencephalogram studies. Furthermore, applying these techniques was associated with mood improvements and a decline in stress biomarkers, and, hypothetically, reducing stress biomarkers attenuates the stress-induced effects on ART outcomes. WIDER IMPLICATIONS: Increasing the knowledge of fertility staff, researchers and physicians regarding the mechanisms of action of these stress management techniques has several advantages. For instance, understanding the underlying neurophysiological pathways would assist practitioners to engage ART couples in the practice of these techniques. Also, it may enhance the quality of the support programmes and psychological research. Accordingly, this will ensure that these interventions reach their full potential and therefore improve clinical outcomes.",

Considering that this disease is highly contagious, patients need to be treated in isolation. This may lead to psychological symptoms such as anxiety and depression, and even sleep problems.This study is a clinical observation study.Participants included 79 COVID-19 patients admitted to a designated hospital for COVID-19 patients in Wuhan from February to March, 2020. Patients were selected and assigned to the control group and the observation group according to their wishes, with 40 and 39 cases in each group, respectively. The control group received routine treatment and nursing, and the observation group received progressive muscle relaxation training, in addition to the routine treatment and nursing. We compared scores of the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index Scale (PSQI), the Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7), and the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) before and after the intervention.There was no significant difference in PSQI, GAD-7, and PHQ-9 scores between the control group and the observation group before the intervention (P > .05). After the intervention, the difference in scores of PSQI, GAD-7, and PHQ-9 in the 2 groups were statistically significant (P < .05).Progressive muscle relaxation training can significantly reduce anxiety and depression and improve sleep quality in COVID-19 patients during isolation treatment.Progressive muscle relaxation training was shown to improve the treatment effect of patients and is worthy of clinical promotion.",

We assessed the feasibility and acceptability of progressive muscle relaxation (PMR) delivered by a smartphone application (app) in the Primary Care setting. METHODS: This pilot study was a non-blinded, randomized, parallel-arm controlled trial of adults with migraine and 4+ headache days/month. Eligible participants spoke English and owned a smartphone. All participants were given the RELAXaHEAD app which includes an electronic headache diary. Participants were randomized to receive 1 of the 2 versions of the app-one with PMR and the other without PMR. The primary outcomes were measures of feasibility (adherence to the intervention and diary entries during the 90-day interval) and acceptability (satisfaction levels). We conducted exploratory analyses to determine whether there was a change in Migraine Disability Assessment Scale (MIDAS) scores or a change in headache days. RESULTS: Of 139 participants (77 PMR, 62 control), 116 (83%) were female, mean age was 41.7 ± 12.8 years. Most patients 108/139 (78%) had moderate-severe disability. Using a 1-5 Likert scale, participants found the app easy to use (mean 4.2 ± 0.7) and stated that they would be happy to engage in the PMR intervention again (mean 4.3 ± 0.6). For the first 6 weeks, participants practiced PMR 2-4 days/week. Mean per session duration was 11.1 ± 8.3 minutes. Relative to the diary-only group, the PMR group showed a greater non-significant decline in mean MIDAS scores (-8.7 vs -22.7, P = .100) corresponding to a small-moderate mean effect size (Cohen's d = 0.38). CONCLUSION: Smartphone-delivered PMR may be an acceptable, accessible form of therapy for migraine. Mean effects show a small-moderate mean effect size in disability scores.",

Joint destruction, chronic pain, change in proprioception, stability problems and decreased range of motion are the most common problems seen in OA. Complementary therapies like yoga, graded motor imagery (GMI), progressive muscle relaxation (PMR) and Tai Chi are more effective in chronic conditions such as knee OA. AIMS: The purpose of this study was to evaluate and compare the effect of graded motor imagery and progressive muscle relaxation on mobility and function in patients with knee OA. METHODS: This study was a randomized controlled pilot trial conducted in a tertiary health center in Belagavi, Karnataka, India. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 11 patients with unilateral knee pain persisting for more than 12 months were included in the study. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomly assigned to 2 groups: the PMR group (n = 5) or the (GMI) group (n = 6). Patients in the PMR group practiced Jacobson's PMR and patients in the GMI group practiced explicit and mirror therapy. All patients were treated 5 times a week for 2 weeks. OUTCOME MEASURES: The outcome measures in this study were range of motion and the Western Ontario and McMaster University Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) score for assessing knee joint pain, function and stiffness. RESULTS: Results demonstrated knee flexion range (P = .046) and function WOMAC scores (P = .0062) were significantly better in the GMI group than in the PMR group. CONCLUSION: GMI and PMR were both beneficial for knee mobility and function but GMI was better than PMR in chronic knee OA.",

The PMR and AT interventions consisted of six 1 h sessions of individual training over 12 weeks, plus home practice. Recruitment, attrition, and completion rates were calculated. Depressive symptoms and quality of life were assessed at all times. Participants' perceptions of the interventions were collected in semi-structured interviews. RESULTS: Following the screening, 54/63 people met the inclusion criteria, and 42/54 were randomly allocated to the PMR group (n=14), AT group (n=14), and CG (n=14). Six participants (43%; 95% CI 18-71%) in the PMR group and 10 (71%; 95% CI 42-92%) in the AT group completed the intervention. Participants reported better emotion management and improvements in depressive symptoms and quality of life. CONCLUSIONS: The pilot study suggests that a randomized trial to test the effectiveness of these interventions is feasible. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01901016.",

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: To examine the effects of progressive muscle relaxation and mindfulness meditation on the severity of diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain (DPNP), fatigue, and quality of life in patients with type 2 diabetes. DESIGN: An assessor-blinded prospective randomized controlled trial. METHODS: Participants were randomly assigned to the relaxation group (RG; n = 28), meditation group (MG; n = 25), or control group (CG; n = 24). The mean age of participants was 64.2 ± 8.1 years in the RG, 61.6 ± 8.0 years in the MG, and 64.1± 6.6 years in the CG. Patients in the intervention groups performed progressive muscle relaxation or mindfulness meditation at their home for 12 weeks, 20 min daily. The CG received only an attention-matched controlled education on pancreas anatomy and diabetes. Data collection was performed at baseline and at weeks 12 and 14 using the VAS, FACIT Fatigue Scale (FACIT-F), and Neuropathic Pain Impact on Quality of Life Questionnaire (NePIQoL). FINDINGS: VAS scores were significantly lower in the RG and MG at week 12 (p < .05) and were statistically significant in the RG at week 14. Additionally, fatigue severity decreased significantly in the RG at weeks 12 and 14, compared to that in the CG (p < .05). While no significant difference was found in the quality of life scores between the study groups at weeks 12 and 14 (p > .05), a significant improvement in quality of life scores in the RG were provided at week 12 compared to those at baseline and week 14 (p < .05). CONCLUSIONS: Both progressive muscle relaxation and mindfulness meditation had a positive impact on providing pain relief in patients with DPNP. Moreover, progressive muscle relaxation also appeared to have a beneficial effect on fatigue. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Based on the results, progressive muscle relaxation and mindfulness meditation can be recommended as supportive therapies for the management of DPNP.",

      "abstract": "Persistent post-traumatic headache (PPTH) is often the most common injury after mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI), reported by 47-95% of patients. Progressive muscle relaxation (PMR) has level A evidence in preventing migraine and tension headaches. However, research on this behavioral therapy for PPTH, let alone smartphone delivered, is limited. We performed a single-arm study of prospective patients calling our Concussion Center between June 2017 and July 2018. Inclusion criteria were that subjects had to meet International Classification of Headache Disorders, 3rd Edition criteria for PPTH secondary to mTBI, have four or more headache days a month, be age 18-85 years and 3-12 months post-injury, own a smartphone, and not tried headache behavioral therapy within the year. We recorded baseline headache and neuropsychiatric data. Using the RELAXaHEAD smartphone application, which has a headache diary and PMR audio files, participants were instructed to record headache symptoms and practice 20 min of PMR daily. There were three monthly follow-up assessments. There were 49 subjects enrolled. Basic demographics were: 33 (67%) female with mean age 40.1 ± 14.6 [20, 75] years. Of the 49 subjects, 15 (31%) had pre-existing headaches. In 11 (22%) subjects, mTBI was sports related. Subjects reported 17.7 ± 9.3 [4, 31] headache days in the month before enrollment, and 49 (100%) experienced over three concussion symptoms. Participants inputted data in the RELAXaHEAD app on average 18.3 ± 12.0 days [0, 31] the first month. Number of participants who did PMR over four times per week was 12 (24.5%) the first month, 9 (22.5%) the second month, and 6 (15%) the third month. After 3 months, 17 (42.5 %) participants continued doing PMR. Participants cited time constraints, forgetfulness, application glitches, and repetitiveness as obstacles to practicing PMR. It is feasible to get PPTH subjects to practice behavioral therapy through low-cost smartphone-based PMR two times weekly. Future work will assess efficacy and examine how to optimize barriers to PMR.",

Some sleep-improving drugs may inhibit the respiratory system and worsen the condition. Prolonged bedside instruction may increase the risk of medical infections. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of progressive muscle relaxation on anxiety and sleep quality of COVID-19. METHODS: In this randomized controlled clinical trial, a total of 51 patients who entered the isolation ward were included in the study and randomly divided into experimental and control groups. The experimental group used progressive muscle relaxation (PMR) technology for 30 min per day for 5 consecutive days. During this period, the control group received only routine care and treatment. Before and after the intervention, the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Scale (STAI) and Sleep State Self-Rating Scale (SRSS) were used to measure and record patient anxiety and sleep quality. Finally, data analysis was performed using SPSS 25.0 software. RESULTS: The average anxiety score (STAI) before intervention was not statistically significant (P = 0.730), and the average anxiety score after intervention was statistically significant (P < 0.001). The average sleep quality score (SRSS) of the two groups before intervention was not statistically significant (P = 0.838), and it was statistically significant after intervention (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Progressive muscle relaxation as an auxiliary method can reduce anxiety and improve sleep quality in patients with COVID-19.",

METHODS: It was a randomized non-blinded controlled trial, including pre - and post assessments, comparing a 3-week relaxation intervention with the standard psychological care. Participants were recruited consecutively from two Public Pediatric Oncology - Hematology Departments in Cyprus and Greece. Fifty four parents of children hospitalized with a malignancy, were randomly assigned either to the intervention group (n = 29), receiving the Progressive Muscle Relaxation (PMR) and Guided Imagery (GI) Relaxation Techniques or to the control group (n = 25) receiving only the Standard Psychological Care by nurses and psychologists. Data were collected with the Questionnaire of 'Ways of Coping Checklist' (WofCC). RESULTS: The results showed that the intervention did not have an impact on the coping strategies that parents employed as these are reflected on the WofCC' factors. The results showed that parents in both intervention and control group prefer using positive ways of coping in stressful situations: positive approach, positive re-evaluation and prayer/daydreaming. CONCLUSIONS: The findings did not support the utilization of PMR and GI as coping strategies altering interventions in this clinical context. However, these findings should be interpreted in light of the short duration of the intervention that under these specific circumstances might have required a more lengthy approach for coping strategies to be altered. Furthermore, the stress relieving properties of these interventions could fortify (although not altering) existing coping strategies."

MATERIALS-METHOD: This randomized controlled interventional study was conducted in a hospital in Mersin, Turkey between October 2017 and July 2018. The study sample comprised 58 patients who were aged >18 years, conscious, had sickle cell disease, reported pain, and were treated with non-opioid or weak opioid analgesic based on the physician's recommendation (treatment group = 29, control group = 29). Data were collected by the individual presentation form and visual analog scale. During the study, both groups were treated with analgesics prescribed by the physician for three days. In addition to the analgesics, the treatment group was performed progressive muscle relaxation exercises for 30 minutes whereas the control group was rested. Pain level of both groups was evaluated at three time points every day for three days. In the study, frequency distributions and descriptive statistics were presented for categorical and numerical variables, respectively. Chi-square analysis, independent samples t-test, Mann-Whitney U test, three-way ANOVA, and Sidak test were used to analyze the difference between the variables. RESULTS: The mean age of the patients was 29.59 ± 6.94 years, and 53.4% of the patients were female and 69% were single. The mean pain score of the treatment group at the third time point on days 1, 2, and 3 was significantly lower than the control group (p < .05). There was no statistically significant difference between the two groups in terms of coping methods for pain, pain location, and complaints accompanying pain (p > .05). CONCLUSION: Progressive muscle relaxation exercises were found to be effective in the pain management of patients with sickle cell anemia.",

The goal of the present study was to compare the efficacy of IBM to progressive muscle relaxation (PMR) for the treatment of social anxiety disorder (SAD). Sixty-four participants with SAD were recruited from across the United States and randomly assigned to 8 internet-delivered twice-weekly sessions of IBM or PMR. Participants were administered assessments of primary symptom outcomes and interpersonal suicide risk factors at posttreatment and 3-month follow-up. IBM led to significantly lower negative interpretation bias than PMR at posttreatment but not follow-up. Both conditions experienced comparable reductions in social anxiety from pretreatment to follow-up (IBM d = 1.37, PMR d = 1.28). They also experienced significant reductions in depression and general anxiety that did not differ from one another. Additionally, IBM led to greater reductions in thwarted belongingness than PMR at posttreatment but not follow-up. Overall, these findings suggest IBM is not more effective than PMR for reducing social anxiety, though there was some evidence of its superiority in decreasing suicide risk. Limitations and directions for future research are discussed.",

This study assesses the efficacy of progressive muscle repose on stress and anxiety among primigravidae. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A randomized controlled study was conducted from May 2015 to June 2017 with 250 primigravidae. The women were assigned using a lottery method to intervention and control groups, 125 in each group. Information on background variables, pregnancy outcome, maternal complications, fetal complications, and postpartum depression was collected during the interval following delivery. PMR was the intervention (video) installed on one-to-one basis for two consecutive days. Pearson correlation, ANOVA, and regression analysis were used to evaluate the data to determine pregnancy outcome and performance of PMR. RESULTS: There was a significant reduction ((F3 = 24.81, p < 0.001) in all aspects of stress among the intervention and control groups during the posttest. The mean gestational age at birth was significantly different (F2 = 6.08, p = 0.014) in the control group. There was significant increase in the occurrence of fetal complications such as birth asphyxia (F2 = 5.67, p < 0.050), respiratory distress (F2 = 8.68, p < 0.050), and jaundice (F2 = 3.91, p < 0.050) in the control group. There was a negative correlation between PMR and stress (r = -0.22, p < 0.001), and PMR and state anxiety (r = -0.26, p < 0.001). There was an increased occurrence of maternal complications among the control group in comparison with the intervention group. CONCLUSIONS: The study suggests that PMR practice is useful during pregnancy to decrease stress, anxiety, and for reducing the occurrence of postpartum complications."

OBJECTIVES: This study investigated the influence of progressive muscle relaxation on the sensation of pain and the need for analgesics after orthopedic interventions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This nonrandomized pilot study tested 104 patients in the Clinic of Orthopedics at the Saarland University Medical Center in Homburg, Germany. The patients underwent total endoprosthesis (TEP) of the or the knee or spine surgery (laminectomy), and they had the option of choosing to use the technique of progressive muscle relaxation. All patients completed a questionnaire on the first, fourth, and ninth postoperative day. Data were collected on the maximum and minimum intensity of pain, duration of strong pain, length of hospital stay, and use of pain medication. These were compared by means of t tests for the group with progressive muscle relaxation and the group without progressive muscle relaxation. RESULTS: No significant difference was observed between the two groups regarding pain sensation analgesic dosage. There was a tendency for the length of hospital stay to be shorter in the group with progressive muscle relaxation. CONCLUSION: The positive effect of progressive muscle relaxation cannot be confirmed on the basis of the study data. Owing to the varying study design and implementation as well as the inclusion of heterogeneous patient groups, no conclusion can be drawn at present regarding the effectiveness of progressive muscle relaxation in common practice; therefore, further research is necessary.",

The aim of the study was to obtain data, documented test results as to the effciency of progressive muscle relaxation in the treatment of pain caused by temporomandibular joint disorders, as a supplement to previous methods using occlusal splint and other physical therapies. The study included 100 patients of both sexes, aged from 20 to 35 years who were diagnosed with pain due to temporomandibular joint disorders accompanied with high muscle tension of musticatory muscles which were treatment by relaxation therapy. All patients underwent physical examination, specialized functional examination of the masticatory system in accordance with the Polish version of the study RDC/TMD (The Research Diagnostic Criteria of Temporomandibular Disorders, Axis I - physical assessment, Axis II - assessment of psychosocial status and pain - related disability) and assessment of psycho emotional factor and stress, based on the survey developed for their own purpose. The results of the research were obtained using specialized statistical package \"R\" i386 3.2.3. The results of examinations a er relaxation therapy showed a significant reduction in the intensity of myofascial pain in all patients. Progressive muscle relaxation can be successfully used as an supportive therapy treatment of patient with dysfunction.",

Mindfulness-based interventions have shown to improve subjective parameters of stress and to reduce relapse rates in depressed patients. However, research on their effects on diurnal patterns of cortisol and associations with subjective outcomes is lacking. The present Ambulatory Assessment study investigated possible changes in daily rhythm cortisol parameters (cortisol awakening response (CAR), daily slope, total cortisol) in currently remitted individuals with recurrent depression who were randomized to a four-week mindfulness-based focused attention training (MBAT, n = 39) or a progressive muscle relaxation training (PMR, n = 39). A second aim was to investigate whether changes in cortisol were linked to improvements in affective and cognitive daily life states. On three weekdays before and after the intervention, seven saliva cortisol samples per day were collected. For analysis, multilevel models were applied. Results revealed no group-specific or general change in CAR and daily slopes from pre- to postintervention. In contrast, total cortisol increased across groups, which was however moderated by group and subjective improvement status. While cortisol increased irrespective of subjective improvement in PMR participants, MBAT participants with larger reductions in negative affect and rumination maintained their initial cortisol levels, whereas those with lower improvement paralleled the PMR group. Thereby, MBAT appeared to buffer an increase in overall cortisol secretion over time, but only in patients showing marked improvements in those affective and cognitive states that constitute core elements for depressive relapses in the vulnerability model of mindfulness-based cognitive therapy.",

The present study aimed to investigate the effect of progressive muscle relaxation on anxiety and sleep quality in burn patients. METHODOLOGY AND PARTICIPANTS: In this randomized controlled clinical trial, a total of 80 patients admitted to burn ward were enrolled using convenient sampling and randomly assigned to one of the experimental or control groups. In the experimental group, patients were intervened using Jacobson's relaxation technique 20-30min daily for three consecutive days. During this period, the control group received only routine care and treatment. Patients' anxiety and their sleep quality were measured and recorded before and after the intervention using the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) and St Mary's Hospital Sleep Quality Questionnaire (SMHSQ) respectively. Eventually, data analysis was conducted using SPSS version 20.0 software (IBM Corp., Armonk, N.Y., USA). RESULTS: The findings of the present study showed a statistically significant decrease in anxiety and improvement in sleep quality in the experimental group compared to the control group (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: Relaxation as a complementary method can be used along with modern medicine to reduce anxiety and improve sleep quality in burn patients.",

OBJECTIVE: We evaluated an intervention combining Progressive Muscle Relaxation (PMR) and music therapy on the decrease of before exams stress and the improvement of academic results. DESIGN AND METHODS: Randomized controlled trial including students from the Nursing Degree during the first semester of the 2017-2018 academic year. All participants were randomized to the control (CG) or the experimental group (EG). The CG took the exam as usual whereas in the EG, PMR and music therapy were performed before exams. Blood samples were drawn to investigate variations in biochemical parameters. The academic performance was assessed by the score obtained in the \"Clinical Nursing\" exam. RESULTS: We included 112 students (75% females, mean age 24.3 ± 6.2 years, 56 students in every group). There were no differences in any parameter during the first measurement. Regarding the second measurement, we observed a reduction in heart rate for the EG and an increase in blood pressure, heart rate, and cortisol for the CG. Indeed, these parameters were significantly higher compared to the EG. The EG had a mean score of 5.07 ± 1.59 in the Clinical Nursing exam, which was significantly higher compared to the CG (4.42 ± 1.58, p = 0.033). The proportion of fails in the CG was also higher (62.5% vs. 42.9%, p = 0.037). CONCLUSION: In this study including students from the Nursing degree, the combination of PMR and music therapy was effective for the control and decrease of stress before exams, and also demonstrated improvements in academic results.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Stress is often associated with the intake of energy-dense palatable foods. This trial examined the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of an 8-week worksite-based relaxation intervention to address psychological stress and unhealthy food intake. METHODS: Thirty-six men and women were exposed to an acute stressor, while physiological and psychological responses were assessed, prior to being offered a test meal. Participants were then randomised to a relaxation intervention (RELAX; face-to-face classes and daily home practice of progressive muscle relaxation and mindfulness meditation), or a wait-list control (CON). All measures were repeated after the intervention. RESULTS: Intervention compliance was high (80% ± 19% face-to-face; 79% ± 18% home practice), and each session acutely reduced perceived stress (p < .001) and increased relaxation (p < .001). After 8 weeks, trait mindfulness was increased (p = .025), along with reduced tension (p = .013) and increased relaxation (p < .05) post-acute stressor in the intervention group. There was no effect of the intervention on palatable eating, cravings, or energy intake at a laboratory test meal, with small associated effect sizes (d = 0.01-0.3). CONCLUSIONS: The program studied here is feasible and sessions transiently reduce perceived stress and improve mindfulness; however, the program may not influence the physiological response to an acute stressor or appetite and eating variables.",

The Emotional Freedom Techniques (EFT) are meridian-based psychotherapy known to cure many psychosomatic diseases, and progressive muscle relaxation (PMR) is a therapeutic method that relieves physical and psychological tension by repeated tensing and relaxation of the muscles. OBJECT: In this study, we compared the effects of EFT and PMR in patients with Hwabyung. DESIGN: 40 patients were enrolled and randomized to receive 4 weeks of group sessions with either EFT (n = 20) or PMR (n = 20). Evaluations were conducted pre- and post-treatment and at 4-week and 24-week follow-ups after session end. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The Hwabyung Scale, Visual Analogue Scale of Hwabyung Symptoms (VAS-HS), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), and State-Trait Anger Expression Inventory (STAXI) were administered as self-report tools. The analysis excluded 8 patients who never attended treatment and 1 patient meeting the exclusion criteria. RESULT: EFT (n = 15) and PMR (n = 16) improved Hwabyung symptoms (-13.95% and -11.46%, respectively), state anxiety (-12.57% and -12.64%, respectively), and depression (-32.11% and -18.68%, respectively) (p < 0.05 for all). Trait anger improved in EFT group (-13.4%, p = 0.004). There were no significant differences between the groups (p > 0.05) except for trait anger at post-treatment (p = 0.022 for between group).

METHODS: The participants were randomly assigned to either a 12-week (PMR) (n = 31) and MM (n = 32) interventions or control group (CG) (n = 29). The intervention groups continued PMR or MM for 20-min every day, for a total of 12 weeks. The CG received only a single time attention-matched education (15-min) on breast cancer before the start of the paclitaxel regimen. Data collection tools included the Patient Information Form, Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI), Brief COPE, and Functional Living Index-Cancer (FLIC). Data were collected at baseline, week 12, and week 14. RESULTS: A significant reduction in the BFI scores was reported in the PMR and MM groups when compared with the CG at weeks 12 and 14 (p = .002). Similarly, the use of emotional support and positive reframing sub-dimension scores of Brief COPE were significantly higher in the PMR and MM than in the CG at weeks 12 (p = .017) and 14 (p = .042). Furthermore, the planning and active coping sub-dimension scores were significantly higher in the PMR and MM than in the CG at week 14 (p = .000). Regarding QOL scores, no significant differences were observed between the groups at weeks 12 (p = .486) and 14 (p = .095). CONCLUSIONS: PMR and MM are effective interventions that if initiated concurrently with the adjuvant paclitaxel demonstrate similar effects on fatigue and coping styles.",

METHODS: This study used quasi experimental design with pre and post test with control group approach. One-hundred older adults with hypertension were divided into two groups using stratified random sampling and purposive sampling. RESULT: After 11 sessions of RESIK therapy in 6 days, the paired t-test showed a decrease in systolic blood pressure to 29.2 mmHg and a decrease in diastolic blood pressure to 16.2 mmHg. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, RESIK decreased systolic blood pressure p < 0,001, but it did not significantly decrease diastolic blood pressure p > 0.167. It is recommended that RESIK be used regularly for an older adult population with hypertension."

Preliminary data support that mind-body connections may improve sexual health outcomes through improving body image. OBJECTIVE: This randomized controlled trial compared hypnosis to progressive muscle relaxation (PMR). The primary outcome was body image at week 6 as measured by the Impact of Treatment Scale for women who have or have had breast or gynecologic cancer. INTERVENTIONS/METHODS: Consented participants were randomized 2:1 to hypnosis or PMR. Both arms consisted of three face-to-face sessions delivered by a trained therapist. Sessions were every 2 weeks for 6 weeks; participants practiced at home between sessions using an audio recording. RESULTS: Eighty-seven women were randomized, 59 to hypnosis and 28 to PMR. Both groups reported significant improvements on body image over time (within group effect size Cohen's d = 0.49-0.75) with no significant difference between groups (p = 0.15). Secondary outcomes were not significantly different between groups. The hypnosis group improved more in sexual satisfaction and sexual interest while the PMR group improved more in positive affect. CONCLUSIONS: Interventions facilitating mind-body connections such as hypnosis and PMR may help to improve body image. This study suggests that stress relieving strategies of hypnosis and PMR may contribute to providing a re-connection to one's body, improved positive affect, and overall better sexual health.",

The data collection tools were administered at baseline, at week four, eight and twelve. SETTING: Internal Medicine, Anaesthesia, and Coronary Intensive care Unit of a training and research hospital. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcome: Stress level. Secondary outcome: Fatigue severity and coping styles. RESULTS: Stress scores in the intervention group decreased significantly at week 8 and week 12 (p < 0.05). Similarly, the fatigue scores were observed to be significantly lower in the intervention group at week 8 and week 12 in comparison to those in the control group (p < 0.05). The scores of coping styles, obtained for the acceptance sub-dimension were significantly higher in the intervention group compared to the control group at week 4, 8, and 12 (p < 0.05). The use of instrumental support, venting and the emotional support scores were observed to be significantly higher in the intervention group compared to the control group at week 12 (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The results indicated that progressive muscle relaxation combined with music appears to be effective in decreasing stress and fatigue, and in improving the coping styles amongst intensive care nurses.

METHOD: Major databases were searched to find both published and unpublished studies from inception until April 2017, using Schizophren* AND Relax* as keywords, and studies published in Portuguese, English, Spanish, Italian, French were considered for inclusion in this review. Methodological quality was assessed by two independent reviewers using the Critical Appraisal Checklist for Randomized Controlled Trials from the Joanna Briggs Institute. RESULTS: From a total of 1172 studies, five studies, involving 216 adults with schizophrenia, met the inclusion criteria for this systematic review after assessment of their methodological quality. These studies reported benefits in experimental group participants after PMR intervention on anxiety (assessed with State anxiety inventory, Beck Anxiety Inventory and Spielberger Trait Anxiety Inventory), well-being (assessed with Subjective Exercise Experiences Scale) and personal and social functioning (assessed with Sheehan Disability Scale and Therapist Rating Scale). CONCLUSIONS: Evidence suggests that PMR was effective in adults diagnosed with schizophrenia, except in one study where was only effective when combined with education. Thus, PMR may be useful to decrease state anxiety, improve well-being and social functioning in adults diagnosed with schizophrenia. However, due to the diversity of clinical intervention designs of PMR (different number and length of sessions) and outcome assessment scales, no strong evidence was found in this systematic review."

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: To evaluate progressive muscle relaxation (PMR) as an intervention for anxiety, psychotic symptoms, and quality of life (QOL) in patients with chronic schizophrenia. DESIGN AND METHODS: Eighty patients were recruited from a Taiwanese psychiatry ward. The intervention group received group PMR; control group received treatment-as-usual. RESULTS: The results indicated that PMR might have a short-term effect on reducing anxiety, improving psychotic syndromes, and QOL among patients with chronic schizophrenia; however, the effectiveness at the 3-month follow-up was not evident. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Both the psychiatric patients and the health institutions may be able to list PMR as a clinical routine care, and then become a mental health practice strategy for mental patients to improve the quality of mental care. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING PRACTICE: Our studies suggest that prevention of severe mental illness among patients with schizophrenia requires PMR interventions. PMR had an immediate effect, and it is possible that a shorter intervention period using this approach would also be successful.",
