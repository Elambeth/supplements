      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN), an endogenous nucleotide essential for various physiological processes, has an unclear role and regulatory mechanisms in female germline stem cell (FGSC) development. RESULTS: We demonstrate that NMN significantly enhances FGSC viability and proliferation. Quantitative acetylation proteomics revealed that NMN markedly increases the acetylation of histone H4 at lysine 16 (H4K16ac). Subsequent chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) identified high mobility group box 1 (Hmgb1) as a downstream target of H4K16ac, a finding further validated by ChIP-qPCR. Knockdown of Hmgb1 reduced FGSC proliferation by disrupting cell cycle progression, inducing apoptosis, and decreasing chromatin accessibility. High-throughput chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C) analysis showed that Hmgb1 knockdown induced A/B compartment switching, increased the number of topologically associating domains (TADs), and decreased chromatin loop formation in FGSCs. Notably, the chromatin loop at the promoter region of Fyn proto-oncogene (Fyn) disappeared following Hmgb1 knockdown. ChIP-qPCR and dual-luciferase reporter assays further confirmed the interaction between Hmgb1 and the Fyn promoter. Importantly, Fyn overexpression reversed the inhibitory effects of Hmgb1 knockdown on FGSC proliferation. Proteomic analysis suggested this rescue was mediated through the phospholipase D (PLD) signaling pathway, as Fyn overexpression selectively enhanced the phosphorylation of PLD1 at threonine 147 without affecting serine 561. Furthermore, treatment with 5-fluoro-2-indolyldechlorohaloamide, a PLD inhibitor, nullified the pro-proliferative effects of Fyn overexpression. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings reveal that NMN promotes FGSC proliferation by activating the H4K16ac-Hmgb1-Fyn-PLD signaling pathway through epigenetic remodeling. These results deepen our understanding of FGSC proliferation and highlight potential therapeutic avenues for advancing FGSC applications in reproductive medicine."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The molecular mechanisms and optimal treatment strategies underlying hyperoxia-aggravated septic lung injury remain elusive. We explored the effects and mechanisms of nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) on hyperoxia-aggravated septic lung injury. METHODS: The rat and cellular models of sepsis-induced lung injury were established and subjected to hyperoxygenation treatment, followed by treatment with NMN, ferroptosis promoter, or inhibitor separately. The extent of lung injury was assessed based on histological examination, lung histological injury scores, wet/dry weight ratio of lung tissues, oxygenation indexes, TNF-ɑ and IL-6 levels, and cell viability. Meanwhile, ferroptosis was assessed through various methods. The levels of glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPx4) and 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) in lung tissues were determined by immunohistochemistry, while iron deposition was evaluated using Prussian blue staining. Fe2+, MDA, and GSH levels were also detected with the respective kits. The reactive oxygen species (ROS) level was measured by flow cytometry and immunofluorescence techniques. The protein and mRNA levels of GPx4 and ACSL4 were also detected. The relationship between sirtuin 6 (SIRT6) and GPx4 was clarified by using SIRT6 inhibitor and activator, as well as in combination with sh-GPx4. RESULTS: Hyperoxia exacerbated lung injury in rats subjected to cecal ligation and puncture (CLP). Hyperoxia also intensified damage to alveolar epithelial cells (AECs) in a lipopolysaccharide (LPS) model. However, NMN ameliorated these detrimental effects. Furthermore, LPS+Hyperoxia treatment significantly upregulated Fe2+, MDA, ROS, and ACSL4 levels, exacerbating oxidative damage. Also, LPS+Hyperoxia treatment downregulated GSH and GPx4 levels, thereby reducing antioxidant capacity. Additionally, Erastin, a ferroptosis promoter, further intensified oxidative stress damage and inflammatory response. However, ferroptosis inhibitor Fer-1 alleviated this damage. Similarly, NMN inhibited ferroptosis in hyperoxia-aggravated septic lung injury. Co-treatment with NMN and sh-GPx4 reversed the protective effect of NMN against LPS-stimulated injury exacerbated by hyperoxia in AECs. NMN supplementation increased SIRT6 expression in AECs. SIRT6 inhibition decreased GPx4 expression and raised ferroptosis markers, while SIRT6 activation had opposite effects. Co-treatment with SIRT6 activator and sh-GPx4 reversed the inhibitory effect on ferroptosis. CONCLUSION: Hyperoxia aggravates septic lung injury by inducing ferroptosis of AECs. NMN can mitigate hyperoxia-aggravated septic lung injury by up-regulating GPx4 through increasing SIRT6 and inhibiting ferroptosis of AECs."

      "abstract": "As an important bioactive substance in cells, nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) has been proven to play an important role in antiaging, treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, and cardioprotection. It presents a high potential for application in the research fields of functional foods, cosmetics, healthcare products, and active pharmaceuticals. With the increased demand, whether NMN can achieve large-scale industrial production has been a wide concern. The chemical synthesis method of NMN mainly faces the problems of separation, purification, and complex process control; in contrast, biosynthesis methods such as microbial fermentation and enzyme catalysis are considered to be the mainstream of the future industrial production of NMN due to the advantages of environmental friendliness, high efficiency, and simple separation. This review first describes the physiological functions of NMN and the related areas of its applications. Subsequently, it focuses on the research progress on different synthetic pathways of NMN in biosynthetic approaches, mining and modification of key enzymes, chassis cell design and optimization, and whole-cell catalysis. Meanwhile, the regulatory strategies, methods, and process control of the microbial synthesis of NMN are also elaborated, and the synthesis efficiencies of different chassis cells are systematically compared. Finally, this review summarizes the existing problems and challenges of microbial synthesis of NMN and proposes future strategies and directions to address these issues. This work provides technical references and a theoretical basis for researching efficient NMN microbial synthesis and application."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND & AIMS: Acute pancreatitis (AP) is a life-threatening condition, and hypertriglyceridemia (HTG) is recognized as a factor exacerbating AP and impeding pancreatic regeneration. Nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN), a precursor in the biosynthesis of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+), is extensively utilized to restore NAD+ levels. However, the impact of NMN on HTG-AP has not been previously addressed, which prompted our investigation into its effects and underlying mechanisms in this study. METHODS & RESULTS: Here, through bioinformatics analysis and in vivo experiments, we identified abnormalities in the thioredoxin system. In vitro studies revealed that NMN rescued oleic acid (OA)- and palmitic acid (PA)-induced mitochondrial dysfunction and cellular injury in pancreatic acinar cells by suppressing thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP) through NAD+/sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) signaling. Repeated administration of NMN significantly ameliorated P407 and caerulein (CER)-induced pancreatic injury and dysfunction in mice. Consistently, NMN exhibited the potential to reduce inflammatory responses, lower serum lipid levels, and mitigate the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). More importantly, sustained NMN treatment inhibited the NOTCH pathway and promoted M2-type macrophage dominance during the pancreatic repair phase, influencing early or late macrophage polarization, which significantly enhanced inflammation resolution. As expected, in vitro models using mouse bone marrow-derived macrophage (BMDM), RAW 264.7, and THP-1 cells confirmed that NMN influences macrophage phenotype through the NOTCH pathway. CONCLUSIONS: Therefore, NMN ameliorates pancreatic acinar cell injury via NAD+/SIRT1-mediated TXNIP suppression and may influence macrophage polarization by inhibiting NOTCH activation, offering a novel therapeutic strategy for the treatment and repair of HTG-AP.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury is the main pathophysiology of testicular torsion-detorsion (T/D). However, there is no safe and effective treatment for testicular I/R injury. METHODS: The levels of NAD+ related genes were measured in the sham group, I/R + saline-treated group, and I/R + NMN-treated group by quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR). Testicular NAD+, Malondialdehyde (MDA), and superoxide dismutase (SOD) were evaluated. The markers of testicular function, including sperm quality, testosterone secretion, and the number of germ cells, were compared between groups. The reactive oxygen species (ROS), apoptosis, and immune cells were analyzed by flow cytometry. The expression of inflammatory genes, germ cell markers, and the phosphorylation of p65 and STAT3 were assessed by qRT-PCR, immunofluorescence, and western blot, respectively. RESULTS: In this study, we analyzed the therapeutic potentials of NMN supplementation in testicular injury induced by torsion-detorsion in mice. NMN supplementation could increase testicular NAD+ content, increase serum testosterone levels, prevent Leydig cell and germ cell injury, and improve sperm quantity. Mechanistically, NMN supplementation relieved the sharply hostile immune microenvironment. Specifically, NMN supplementation could mitigate the oxidative stress and cell apoptosis in the I/R injured testes, downregulate the protein expression of p-p65 and p-STAT3 in inflammatory pathways, limit the excessive activation of inflammatory responses in testicular tissues, and reshape the inflammatory properties of macrophages and neutrophils. CONCLUSIONS: The beneficial effects of NMN supplementation indicated that boosting NAD+ may be a promising and safe strategy to improve clinical outcomes in I/R-induced testicular damage.",

      "abstract": "Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is known to induce cell injury and mitochondrial dysfunction, which are pivotal in neuroinflammation and related disorders. Recent studies have demonstrated the potential of nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP1) inhibitors to enhance mitochondrial function. However, the underlying mechanisms have not been fully elucidated. This study investigates the impact of NMN in conjunction with PJ-34, a PARP1 inhibitor, on LPS-induced mitochondrial damage, focusing on nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyl transferase 3 (NMNAT3) -PARP1 axis. The results showed that LPS treatment led to down-regulation of NMNAT3 (decreased 58.72% at 1 µM), up-regulation of PARP1 (enhanced 22.78% at 1 µM), thereby impairing mitophagy and mitochondrial function. The negative effects can be mitigated through supplementation with NMN and PJ-34. Specifically, compared to the LPS group, the expression of NMNAT3 increased by 63.29% and PARP1 decreased by 27.94% at a concentration of 400 µM NMN. Additionally, when 400 µM NMN was combined with 5 µM PJ-34, PARP1 expression decreased by 21.99%. Mechanistic studies reveal that NMN and PJ-34 counteracted the detrimental effects by promoting the binding of FoxO1 to the PINK1 promoter to activate the PINK1/Parkin mediated mitophagy pathway. Further experimental results demonstrate that the down-regulation of NMNAT3 can activate PARP1 and inhibit the initiation of autophagic processes. Consequently, targeting the NMNAT3-PARP1 signaling pathway holds promise for the development of novel therapeutic strategies to alleviate mitochondrial damage-related disorders.",

      "abstract": "Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) deficiency has been shown to cause pathogenesis of age-related functional decline and diseases. Investigational studies have demonstrated improvements in age-associated pathophysiology and disease conditions. However, invasive methods such as immunohistochemistry, metabolic assays, and polymerase chain reaction currently used to measure cell metabolism render cells unviable and unrecoverable for longitudinal studies and are incompatible with in vivo dynamic observations. We report a non-invasive optical technique to investigate the upregulation of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) in keratinocytes (both in vitro and ex vivo) upon administration of nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) coated microneedle (μNDs) implants. Our technique exploits intrinsic autofluorescence of cells and tissues using multiphoton microscopy. Additionally, μND coating formulations to date have been evaluated using fluorescence microscopy to determine the coated amount, often an imprecise correlation between fluorescence intensity and the coated amount on the μND surface. We also show that rheomechanical attributes of the coating formulation (containing two different viscosity enhancers: sucrose and carboxy methyl cellulose) affect the flow mechanics of the coating formulation at micron scale, and thus the amount of drug coated on the μND surface. In vitro keratinocyte cells were investigated with four concentrations of NMN (50, 250, 500 and 1000 μg), and evaluated with time-dependent NMN (500 μg) treatment at 0, 5, 10, 30, 60, 360 and 1460 min. We demonstrate that intracellular keratinocyte fluorescence of the endogenous NADH shows a decreasing trend in both the average fluorescence lifetime (τm) and the free unbound NADH (τ1), with increasing dosage of NMN administration. A similar trend in the average fluorescence lifetime (τm) of endogenous NAD(P)H was also seen in mouse ear skin ex vivo skin upon administration of NMN. We show a promising, minimally invasive, alternative delivery system for the NAD+ precursor molecule that can enhance patient compliance and therapeutic outcomes.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Chemotherapy-induced ovarian damage represents a major challenge for women of reproductive age undergoing cancer treatments. In mice, nicotinamide mononucleotide enhances the developmental competence of aged oocytes by preventing oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis; however, its potential to restore oocyte quality following chemotherapy-induced ovarian damage remains unexplored. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of nicotinamide mononucleotide treatment against the deleterious effects of chemotherapy and aging in mice and human oocytes. STUDY DESIGN: We used mouse models with different degrees of chemotherapy-induced ovarian damage, mimicking diminished ovarian reserve and premature ovarian insufficiency, and young healthy females as a reference group. Mice of each ovarian condition were treated with or without 2 g/L nicotinamide mononucleotide in drinking water for a complete cycle (4 weeks) or during the later stages (14 days) of folliculogenesis. After treatments, mice underwent ovarian hyperstimulation and were euthanized to collect ovaries and oocytes to evaluate follicular counts, oocyte quality, and maturation. Part of the collected metaphase II oocytes underwent in vitro fertilization and embryo culture to assess preimplantation embryo development. Finally, we also explored the benefits of in vitro nicotinamide mononucleotide supplementation in aged infertile patients using germinal vesicle oocytes from advanced maternal age (>38) and young (≤35 years old) women. Maturation and artificial oocyte activation potential were assessed following the germinal vesicle rescue approach. RESULTS: Nicotinamide mononucleotide supplementation over a complete folliculogenesis cycle (4 weeks) improved the quality of oocytes exposed to chemotherapy by recovering nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide levels (P=.006), redistributing mitochondria to promote proper meiotic spindle assembly, and ultimately, recovering fertilization rate (P=.003) in diminished ovarian reserve mice. In the premature ovarian insufficiency model, reduced reactive oxygen species abundance (P=.039), increased mitochondria quantity (P=.030), and improved expression of the DNA repair gene apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease 1 [Apex1] were found, thereby enhancing proper meiotic spindle formation and chromosome alignment. Similarly, when nicotinamide mononucleotide supplementation was restricted to the later stages of folliculogenesis (14 days), positive effects on oocyte quality were observed, though to a lesser extent. Increased nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide levels (P˂.001) and embryo development rates (P=.048) were found in the diminished ovarian reserve group, while reduced reactive oxygen species abundance (P=.040), and increased mitochondrial DNA copy number (P=.006) and DNA repair gene expression (Apex1: P=.041; AlkB homolog 2, alpha-ketoglutarate dependent dioxygenase (Alkbh2): P=.029) were observed in premature ovarian insufficiency mice. Finally, in vitro supplementation with 100 µM nicotinamide mononucleotide was able to improve the nuclear competence (P=.039) and parthenogenetic activation of immature oocytes from women with advanced maternal age (>38 years old). CONCLUSION: These results highlight the regenerative role of nicotinamide mononucleotide in mouse and human oocytes exposed to the deleterious effects of chemotherapy and aging, representing a potential therapeutic alternative for fertility preservation and aged patients seeking to achieve motherhood with autologous oocytes."

      "abstract": "Nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) is a widely investigated metabolic precursor to the prominent enzyme cofactor NAD+, where it is assumed that delivery of this compound results in its direct incorporation into NAD+via the canonical salvage/recycling pathway. Surprisingly, treatment with this salvage pathway intermediate leads to increases in nicotinic acid mononucleotide (NaMN) and nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide, two members of the Preiss-Handler/de novo pathways. In mammals, these pathways are not known to intersect prior to the production of NAD+. Here, we show that the cell surface enzyme CD38 can mediate a base-exchange reaction on NMN, whereby the nicotinamide ring is exchanged with a free nicotinic acid to yield the Preiss-Handler/de novo pathway intermediate NaMN, with in vivo small molecule inhibition of CD38 abolishing the NMN-induced increase in NaMN and nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide. Together, these data demonstrate a new mechanism by which the salvage pathway and Preiss-Handler/de novo pathways can exchange intermediates in mammalian NAD+ biosynthesis.",

Follicular fluid contains a diverse array of metabolites that play crucial roles in regulating GCs' proliferation and oocyte maturation, which are essential for follicle development and female fertility. However, the mechanisms behind metabolite heterogeneity and its effects on GCs' function remain poorly understood. Here, we identified elevated nicotinamide levels in the follicular fluid of high-prolificacy sheep, correlated with oxidative stress in GCs, by an integrated analysis. In vitro experiments demonstrated that supplementation with β-nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) significantly increased the levels of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) in GCs. NMN treatment effectively reduced Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced apoptosis and mitigated mitochondrial dysfunction, while also decreasing the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), thereby enhancing the activity of the antioxidant defense system. Importantly, NMN treatment improved the impairments in steroid hormone levels induced by LPS. Mechanistically, the protective effects of NMN against GCs function were mediated via the AMPK/mTOR pathway. Collectively, our findings elucidate the metabolic characteristics associated with sheep prolificacy and demonstrate that NMN effectively protects GCs from LPS-induced dysfunction and enhances ovarian responsiveness via the AMPK/mTOR pathway. These findings also position NMN as a potential novel metabolic biomarker in enhancing ovarian function."

      "abstract": "Age-related hearing loss (ARHL) is a widespread problem in the elderly, significantly impairing their quality of life. Despite its high prevalence, no fundamental treatment for ARHL has been established. Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) is required for various biological processes and tissue levels of the coenzyme NAD+ are known to decrease with age. A previous report suggested that declining NAD+ levels induce age-related diseases and NAD+ supplementation might be effective for treating or preventing age-related diseases. To clarify the effect of NAD+ supplementation on ARHL, C57BL/6J mice used as an animal model of ARHL were treated with nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN), a precursor of NAD+. Oral administration of NMN at 500 mg/kg/day effectively suppressed the development of ARHL in C57BL/6J mice. To elucidate the mechanism by which NMN administration suppressed the development of ARHL, NAD+-related metabolites were assessed, and a comprehensive transcriptomic analysis of the inner ear tissue was performed. NMN administration resulted in increased NAD+ levels in inner ear tissues and induced changes in the transcriptome, specifically in genes related to metal ion metabolism. These findings suggest that NMN administration enhanced NAD+ levels in inner ear tissues, modulating metal ion metabolism to potentially protect against oxidative stress. This study provides a novel therapeutic approach to mitigating ARHL through NAD+ supplementation.",

This study explores the effects of nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) in a letrozole-induced PCOS mouse model, focusing on metabolic regulation. Letrozole-induced aromatase inhibition elevated androgen and reduced bile acid levels, linking liver dysfunction and gut imbalance to PCOS. Letrozole-treated mice exhibited disrupted estrous cycles, ovarian congestion, and elevated testosterone. NMN intervention alleviated hyperandrogenism, ovarian abnormalities, and bile acid decline but did not fully restore the estrous cycle or improve lipid profiles. Metabolomic analysis showed that NMN partially reversed bile acid and lipid metabolism disturbances. These findings highlight NMN's protective role in reducing hyperandrogenism and ovarian cyst formation. However, effective PCOS treatment should target liver and gut metabolism, not just ovarian symptoms, to mitigate systemic effects. Bile acid dysregulation may play a key role in PCOS progression and warrants further investigation."

Here, we investigated whether elevated NAD(H) levels in oocytes enhance their quality and improve developmental competence following in vitro fertilization (IVF). Bovine cumulus-oocyte complexes (COCs) were matured in a culture medium supplemented with 0-100 μM nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN), a precursor of NAD(H). The addition of NMN caused an increase in intracellular NAD(H) and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate levels, leading to enhanced competence for development to the blastocyst stage after IVF. The increase in intracellular NAD(H) levels led to changes in the expression of mitochondria function-related genes. As a result, NMN supplementation increased the ratio of MitoTracker Orange fluorescence to nonyl acridine orange fluorescence, as well as adenosine triphosphate levels, while decreasing reactive oxygen species levels in the oocytes. NMN also lowered chromosome lagging during anaphase. These results suggest that increased NAD(H) levels in oocytes following NMN treatment enhances post-fertilization developmental competence through improved mitochondrial function.",

Decreased saliva secretion causes dryness in the oral cavity that makes swallowing difficult and increases the risk of aspiration pneumonia. There are few fundamental treatments for dry mouth. Here we investigated whether treatment of old mice with nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) improved factors associated with dry mouth. Young (16-week-old) and old (113-week-old) male mice were treated subcutaneously with saline or NMN (300 mg/kg) once every two days for four weeks and saliva secretion was measured. The amount of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) in salivary gland tissues was measured by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Gene expression in the intestinal tract and salivary glands was measured by real-time PCR. The population of cells with acetylation in the submandibular gland was quantified by immunohistological staining. SA-β-gal activity in the submandibular gland was measured to assess cell senescence. Statistical analysis was performed by one-way analysis of variance with Tukey post hoc analysis. The submandibular glands from old mice treated with NMN exhibited increased saliva secretion and NAD+ levels, which both decrease with aging. In addition, the submandibular glands from NMN-treated old mice had decreased acetylation, numbers of senescent cells, and levels of senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) factors, which all increase with aging, as well as increased aquaporin5 (AQP5) mRNA expression. NMN administration may improve dry mouth by regulating cellular senescence in the submandibular gland and increasing expression of AQP5, a water channel involved in saliva secretion, to inhibit age-related decreases in saliva secretion. It is necessary to elucidate further mechanism and confirm its effectiveness in humans.",

      "abstract": "Myocardial dysfunction is a decisive factor of death in septic patients. Cyclophilin F (PPIF) is a major component of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) and acts as a critical mPTP sensitizer triggering mPTP opening. In sepsis, decreased NAD+ impairs Sirtuin 3 function, which may prevent PPIF de-acetylation. Repletion of NAD+ with nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) reduces myocardial dysfunction in septic mice. In addition, administration of the mPTP inhibitor cyclosporine-A attenuated sepsis-induced myocardial dysfunction, and deletion of PPIF reduced lung and liver injuries in sepsis, leading to increased survival. It is plausible that NAD+ repletion with NMN may prevent mPTP opening in protecting septic hearts through PPIF de-acetylation and/or inhibition of mitochondrial ROS-mediated PPIF oxidation. In this study we investigated how NMN alleviated myocardial dysfunction in septic mice. Sepsis was induced in mice by injection of LPS (4 mg/kg, i.p.). Then mice received NMN (500 mg/kg, i.p.) or mito-TEMPO (0.7 mg/kg, i.p.) right after LPS injection, and subjected to echocardiography for assessing myocardial function. At the end of experiment, the heart tissues and sera were collected for analyses. In vitro experiments were conducted in neonatal mouse cardiomyocytes treated with LPS (1 µg/mL) in the presence of NMN (500 µmol/L) or mito-TEMPO (25 nmol/L). We showed that LPS treatment markedly increased mitochondrial ROS production and induced lysosomal dysfunction and aberrant autophagy in cardiomyocytes and mouse hearts, leading to inflammatory responses and myocardial injury and dysfunction in septic mice. NMN administration attenuated LPS-induced deteriorative effects. Selective inhibition of mitochondrial superoxide production with mito-TEMPO attenuated lysosomal dysfunction and aberrant autophagy in septic mouse hearts. Notably, LPS treatment significantly increased acetylation and oxidation of PPIF, which was prevented by NMN in mouse hearts. Knockdown of PPIF replicated the beneficial effects of NMN or mito-TEMPO on ROS production, lysosomal dysfunction, aberrant autophagy, and myocardial injury/dysfunction in sepsis. In addition, administration of NMN abrogated LPS-induced ATP5A1 acetylation and increased ATP5A1 protein levels and ATP production in septic mouse hearts. This study demonstrates that NMN modulates the interplay of mitochondrial ROS and PPIF in maintaining normal lysosomal function and autophagy and protecting ATP5A1 and ATP production during sepsis.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Premature ovarian insufficiency (POI) is a common clinical problem, but there is currently no effective treatment. NLRP3 inflammasome-induced pyroptosis is thought to be a possible mechanism of POI. Nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) has a certain anti-inflammatory effect, providing a promising approach for the treatment of POI. METHODS: Thirty female Sprague Dawley rats were randomly divided into a control group (n = 10) and a POI group (n = 20). Cyclophosphamide (CTX) was administered for 2 weeks to induce POI. Then the POI group was divided into two groups: the CTX-POI group (n = 10), which was given saline; and the CTX-POI + NMN group (n = 10), which was given NMN at a dose of 500 mg/kg/day for 21 consecutive days. At the end of the study, the serum hormone concentrations of each group were determined, and each group was subjected to biochemical, histopathological, and immunohistochemical analyses. In the in vitro experiment, cell pyroptosis was simulated by using lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and nigricin (Nig), and then KGN cells were treated with NMN, MCC950, and AGK2, and the levels of Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) and inflammatory factors Interleukin-18(IL-18) and Interleukin-1β(IL-1β) in the cell supernatants were detected, and the levels of pyroptosis-related factors in the cells were determined. RESULTS: In POI rats, NMN treatments can improve blood hormone levels and partially improve the number of follicles, enhance ovarian reserve function and ovarian index.The evidence is that the increase in NAD+ levels and the activation of SIRT2 expression can reduce the expression of NLRP3, Gasdermin D (GSDMD), Caspase-1, IL-18, and IL-1β in the ovary. CONCLUSION: NMN improves CTX-induced POI by inhibiting NLRP3-mediated pyroptosis, providing a new therapeutic strategy and drug target for clinical POI patients.",

We aimed to elucidate the effect of β-NMN on septic AKI. A cecal ligation and perforation (CLP)-induced sepsis-associated AKI mice model and a lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-triggered HK-2 cell model were established. Renal histopathology in mice with septic AKI without or with β-NMN treatment was detected using H&E staining. The contents of serum creatinine (Scr), blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and renal NAD+ were assessed with kits. Inflammation was evaluated by detecting the concentrations of TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6 using ELISA kits. Besides, TUNEL assay was used to examine apoptosis and apoptosis-associated proteins was measured using immunoblotting. Additionally, expression of genes in sirtuins (SIRTs) family in renal tissues was tested using RT-qPCR. HK-2 cell viability was detected using CCK-8 assy. Finally, SIRT3 was silenced to carry out the rescue experiments. As a result, NAD+ level was decreased in kidney tissues of mice with sepsis-associated AKI and HK-2 cells treated with LPS. β-NMN treatment increased NAD+ level and alleviated the inflammation and apoptosis in renal tissues. It could be observed that SIRT3 expression was notably downregulated in vivo and in vitro, which was upregulated by β-NMN supplementation. Further, interfering with SIRT3 expression mitigated the protective effects of β-NMN on the inflammation and apoptosis of HK-2 cells under LPS conditions. In summary, β-NMN alleviates sepsis-associated AKI by activating NAD+/SIRT3 signaling. Our findings provide evidence of β-NMN supplementation on improvement of sepsis-associated AKI."

      "abstract": "Colitis, accompanied by the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the intestinal tract, is a risk factor for colorectal cancer (CRC). Our previous studies indicate that nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) replenishment reduces chronic inflammation. In this study, we confirm that NMN supplementation reduces inflammatory cytokine levels and oxidative tissue damage in an azoxymethane/dextran sulfate sodium (AOM/DSS)-induced colitis-associated cancer (CAC) model. Mice treated with NMN developed fewer colon tumors than untreated animals under the same AOM/DSS treatment conditions. Quantitative proteomic analysis revealed a decrease in signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) expression in the CAC model. We demonstrate that STAT1 overexpression induces G1 arrest by downregulating CDK6 expression and suppressing tumor cell proliferation and migration. Of note, H2O2 induced trioxidation of the STAT1 protein and promoted its degradation, which was partially reversed by NMN supplementation. Upon H2O2 treatment, Cys155 in STAT1 was oxidized to sulfonic acid, whereas the mutation of Cys155 to alanine abolished ROS-mediated STAT1 degradation. These results indicate that oxidative stress induces STAT1 degradation in tumor cells and possibly in CAC tissues, whereas supplementation with NMN protects STAT1 from oxidation-induced degradation and prevents tumorigenesis. This study provides experimental evidence for the development of NMN-mediated chemoprevention strategies for CRC."

The combination of multi-target therapies to achieve optimal anti-arrhythmogenesis and improve the chances of successful translation for patient benefit has prompted considerable interest. This study examined the anti-arrhythmic effect of nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN)/ubiquinol combination treatment following myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (IR) injury in aged rats, with an emphasis on the role of oxidative stress and nitric oxide (NO). METHODS: Male Wistar rats (n=30, 22-24 months old, 400-450 g) were randomized into five groups with or without IR and/or NMN and ubiquinol, either alone or in combination. NMN (100 mg/kg/48 hours) was administered intraperitoneally for 28 days before IR, and ubiquinol (30 mg/kg) was injected intravenously at early reperfusion. Electrocardiographic signals were recorded during the ischemia and the first 30 minutes of reperfusion. Two hours after reperfusion, myocardial hemodynamic and LDH release were measured, and the left ventricle samples were obtained to evaluate oxidative stress markers and NO levels. RESULTS: NMN/ubiquinol combination treatment significantly minimized the occurrence and severity of IR-induced arrhythmias, improved myocardial function, and reduced LDH release (P<0.05). It also decreased MDA content, increased superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPX), and catalase (CAT) activities, and enhanced NO formation (P<0.05). This combined treatment showed greater efficacy than the single treatments. CONCLUSION: This study revealed the anti-arrhythmic effect of NMN/ubiquinol combination treatment in IR-treated aged rats, which may be associated with reduced oxidative stress and increased NO formation. This combinational approach deserves more investigation due to its potential to confer better anti-arrhythmic effect during aging."

Nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN), a precursor of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD +), plays crucial roles in energy metabolism, DNA repair, and gene expression. The purpose of this study is to investigate the protective effects and underlying mechanisms of NMN against ionizing radiation (IR)-induced testicular injury and spermatogenic dysfunction in an adult male mouse model. To assess the effects of NMN, single whole-body γ-ray irradiation is used to induce testicular injury and spermatogenic dysfunction in adult male mice. NMN is orally administered at 500 mg/kg before and after IR exposure. The structural and cellular damage to the testes caused by 5 Gy γ-ray irradiation, as well as the protective effect of NMN on testicular spermatogenic dysfunction, are evaluated. The serum hormone testosterone, LH, and FSH levels, as well as testicular NAD +, lactate, and pyruvate levels, are detected. Furthermore, the expressions of the apoptosis-related genes Bcl-2, Bax, and Caspase-3 and the rate-limiting enzymes HK2, PKM2, and LDHA, which are potentially associated with the mechanism of injury, are examined. The results demonstrate that 5 Gy γ-ray irradiation exposure causes a decrease in the serum testosterone, LH, and FSH levels in adult male mice, as well as in the testicular NAD +, lactate, and pyruvate levels, and causes damage to the testicular structure and cells. Morphometric analysis reveal a decrease in the testis mass, seminiferous tubule diameter, and height of the germinal epithelium. The sperm quantity, motility, and testicular volume are reduced in the 5 Gy group but are restored by NMN supplementation. NMN intervention downregulates the expressions of proapoptotic genes ( Bax and Caspase-3) and upregulates the expression of an antiapoptotic gene ( Bcl- 2). Sertoli cells marker genes ( WT-1, GATA-4, SOX9, and vimentin) and glycolysis rate-limiting enzyme-encoding genes ( HK2, PKM2, and LDHA) are significantly upregulated. In summary, NMN has a positive regulatory effect on testicular spermatogenic dysfunction in male mice induced by ionizing radiation. This positive effect is likely achieved by promoting the proliferation of spermatogenic cells and activating glycolytic pathways. These findings suggest that NMN supplementation may be a potential protective strategy to prevent reproductive damage to male subjects from ionizing radiation.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: β-nicotinamide mononucleotide stands out as an essential breakthrough in \"anti-aging\" and consistently leads the list of top-selling nutritional supplements in terms of quantity. As the metabolites of β-nicotinamide mononucleotide, the detection of nicotinamide and N1-methylnicotinamide is of great significance for evaluating the nutritional effect of dietary supplements of β-nicotinamide mononucleotide. However, due to the extremely low concentration of nicotinamide and N1-methylnicotinamide in vivo and the serious matrix interference in biological samples, there is an increasing demand for materials and methods of pre-treatment. RESULTS: In this study, Fe3O4@hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose@dodecylbenzenesulfonic acid magnetic fluid was synthesized for the first time, and it was used as pretreatment material to detect nicotinamide and N1- methylnicotinamide in urine samples by high performance liquid chromatography. Compared with other adsorption materials, Fe3O4@hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose@dodecylbenzenesulfonic acid nanoparticles are a kind of uniform magnetic fluid. Furthermore, they have more types and quantities of interaction sites (electrostatic interactions, hydrophobic interactions, hydrogen bonding interactions, and π-π interactions), so they own greater adsorption capacity. When the pH of the solution is 4, they can be adsorbed quickly within 10 s. The method successfully detected trace nicotinamide and N1-methylnicotinamide in urine samples in the linear range of 0.1-80 μg mL-1, the low detection limits were 0.30 ng mL-1 and 1.5 ng mL-1 respectively, and the quantification limits were 1.0 ng mL-1 and 5.0 ng mL-1, respectively. At the same time, the standard urine samples of nicotinamide and N1-methylnicotinamide showed satisfactory recovery rate 94.50-109.1 %. The results indicated that the established method can accurately and quantitatively determine trace nicotinamide and N1-methylnicotinamide in urine samples. SIGNIFICANCE: Consequently, low concentration of β-nicotinamide mononucleotide metabolites can be detected simultaneously, and the interference can be eliminated during the detection process, which provides an efficient and convenient pretreatment method and a rapid and sensitive detection method for the analysis of β-nicotinamide mononucleotide metabolites. What's more, it has a wide application prospect in the analysis of other similar metabolites in biological samples.",

Study variables included title, author, publication date, study year, number of patients, dosage, mean age, mean follow-up time, pre- and post-intervention reported outcomes, and rates of complications. Ten studies, including 437 patients, with a mean age of 58.0 years (35.1 to 81.1 years) and a mean follow-up time of 9.6 weeks (4 to 12 weeks) were included in this study. NMN dosages ranged from 150 to 1200 mg/day. Mean pre-intervention grip strength (two studies) and skeletal mass index (two studies) were 29.9 kilograms (kg) (range: 21.4-40.1 kg) and 7.4 kg/m2 (range: 6.9-7.65 kg/m2), respectively. Mean post-intervention grip strength and skeletal mass index were 30.5 kg (range: 21.7-41.9 kg) and 7.4 kg/m2 (6.8-7.64 kg/m2), respectively. There were no serious adverse effects observed. Moreover, of the reported side effects, they were determined to be independent of NMN supplementation. Therefore, patients taking NMN supplementation demonstrated non-significantly improved physical performance parameters. NMN is well tolerated with no serious adverse effects observed."

The anti-aging effects of NMN on muscle and liver functions in middleaged and elderly people are still unclear. OBJECTIVE: Based on available randomized controlled trials, we conducted a meta-analysis to evaluate the impact of NMN on muscle and liver functions in middle-aged and elderly individuals. METHODS: We conducted searches on three electronic databases (PubMed, Embase, Web of Science) for randomized controlled trials involving NMN interventions in middle-aged and elderly populations. Through the Cochrane Handbook, we assessed the specific methodological quality. All statistical analyses were obtained by Stata15, and statistical significance was set as P<0.05. RESULTS: There were 412 participants from 9 studies in this meta-analysis. Based on changes in gait speed (SMD: 0.34 m/s, 95%CI [0.03, 0.66] p = 0.033), NMN had significant effects on muscle mass. Moreover, NMN had a better effect on ALT (SMD: -0.29 IU/L, 95%CI [-0.55, -0.03] p = 0.028). Subgroup analysis indicated that administering a small dose of NMN exerted the most prominent impact on Homeostasis Model Assessment-Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR). CONCLUSION: NMN has positive efficacy in enhancing muscle function, reducing insulin resistance and lowering aminotransferase levels in middle-aged and elderly individuals. NMN is an encouraging and considerable drug for anti-aging treatment."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The beneficial effects of nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) on heart disease have been reported, but the effects of NMN on high-fat diet-induced hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and its mechanisms of action are unclear. In this study, we systematically explored the effects and mechanism of action of NMN in HCM using network pharmacology and molecular docking. METHODS: Active targets of NMN were obtained from SWISS, CNKI, PubMed, DrugBank, BingingDB, and ZINC databases. HCM-related targets were retrieved from GEO datasets combined with GeneCards, OMIM, PharmGKB, and DisGeNET databases. A Protein-protein Interaction (PPI) network was built to screen the core targets. DAVID was used for GO and KEGG pathway enrichment analyses. The tissue and organ distribution of targets was evaluated. Interactions between potential targets and active compounds were assessed by molecular docking. A molecular dynamics simulation was conducted for the optimal core protein-compound complexes obtained by molecular docking. RESULTS: In total, 265 active targets of NMN and 3918 potential targets of HCM were identified. A topological analysis of the PPI network revealed 10 core targets. GO and KEGG pathway enrichment analyses indicated that the effects of NMN were mediated by genes related to inflammation, apoptosis, and oxidative stress, as well as the FOXO and PI3K-Akt signaling pathways. Molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations revealed good binding ability between the active compounds and screened targets. CONCLUSION: The possible targets and pathways of NMN in the treatment of HCM have been successfully predicted by this investigation. It provides a novel approach for further investigation into the molecular processes of NMN in HCM treatment.",

      "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the deposition of β-amyloid (Aβ) plaques and neurofibrillary tangles composed of tau protein in the brain. These neuropathological hallmarks contribute to cognitive impairment by inducing neuronal loss in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus. Unfortunately, current therapeutic approaches only target symptomatic relief and do not impede disease progression. Nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN), a precursor of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+), has emerged as a promising candidate for the treatment of age-related neurodegenerative disorders. NMN supplementation could restore NAD+ levels, thereby alleviating neuronal damage and slowing the progression of AD and other aging-associated diseases. AD is closely associated with autophagic impairment and oxidative stress. Our in vivo experiments demonstrated that NMN could ameliorate pathological and behavioral impairments in AD mice. Specifically, NMN enhanced autophagy and promoted p-tau clearance. Meanwhile, NMN could activate the Nrf2/Keap1/NQO1 pathway, thereby reducing the oxidative stress. Immunofluorescence results demonstrated that NMN could alleviate neuronal damage in AD mice. Furthermore, in vitro results showed that the p-tau clearance and antioxidant stress effects of NMN were suppressed by autophagy inhibitor, chloroquine (CQ) or bafilomycin A1 (BafA1), in Aβ-induced PC12 cells. Lastly, when Nrf2 was knocked down, the antioxidant stress, autophagy enhancement, and p-tau clearance effects of NMN were all inhibited. In conclusion, our research indicates that NMN exerts therapeutic effect against AD by activating autophagy and the Nrf2/Keap1/NQO1 pathway through a mutual regulating mechanism of autophagy and antioxidative stress. These findings highlight the promising potential of NMN for the treatment of AD.",

Consequently, this study established a high-fat diet (HFD) obese model to investigate the lipid-lowering activity of NMN. The findings showed that NMN supplementation directly increased the NAD+ levels, and reduced HFD-induced liver injury and lipid deposition. NMN treatment significantly decreased total cholesterol (TC) and triglyceride (TG) in serum and liver, as well as alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and insulin levels in serum (p < .05 or p < .01).

      "abstract": "Depression is a prevalent psychiatric disorder with accumulating evidence implicating dysregulation of extracellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). It remains unclear whether facilitating endogenous ATP production and subsequently increasing extracellular ATP level in the mPFC can exert a prophylactic effect against chronic social defeat stress (CSDS)-induced depressive-like behaviors and enhance stress resilience. Here, we found that nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) treatment effectively elevated nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) biosynthesis and extracellular ATP levels in the mPFC. Moreover, both the 2-week intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection and 3-week oral gavage of NMN prior to exposure to CSDS effectively prevented the development of depressive-like behavior in mice. These protective effects were accompanied with the preservation of both NAD+ biosynthesis and extracellular ATP level in the mPFC. Furthermore, catalyzing ATP hydrolysis by mPFC injection of the ATPase apyrase negated the prophylactic effects of NMN on CSDS-induced depressive-like behaviors. Prophylactic NMN treatment also prevented the reduction in GABAergic inhibition and the increase in excitability in mPFC neurons projecting to the lateral habenula (LHb). Collectively, these findings demonstrate that the prophylactic effects of NMN on depressive-like behaviors are mediated by preventing extracellular ATP loss in the mPFC, which highlights the potential of NMN supplementation as a novel approach for protecting and preventing stress-induced depression in susceptible individuals.",

The toxic side effects of DOX, including DNA damage, oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction and cell apoptosis, are intricately linked to the involvement of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+). To assess the effectiveness of the NAD+ precursor nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) in counteracting the multi-organ toxicity of DOX, a mouse model was established through DOX administration, which led to significant reductions in NAD+ in tissues with evident injury, including the heart, liver and lungs. NMN treatment alleviated both multi-organ fibrosis and mortality in mice. Mechanistically, tissue fibrosis, macrophage infiltration and DOX-related cellular damage, which are potentially implicated in the development of multi-organ fibrosis, could be attenuated by NAD+ restoration. Our findings provide compelling evidence for the benefits of NMN supplementation in mitigating the adverse effects of chemotherapeutic drugs on multiple organs.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The number of patients with type 1 diabetes rises rapidly around the world in recent years. Maternal diabetes has a detrimental effect on reproductive outcomes due to decreased oocyte quality. However, the strategies to improve the oocyte quality and artificial reproductive technology (ART) efficiency of infertile females suffering from diabetes have not been fully studied. In this study, we aimed to examine the effects of nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) on oocyte maturation of mouse with type 1 diabetes mouse and explore the underlying mechanisms of NMN's effect. METHODS: Streptozotocin (STZ) was used to establish the mouse models with type 1 diabetes. The successful establishment of the models was confirmed by the results of body weight test, fasting blood glucose test and haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining. The in vitro maturation (IVM) rate of oocytes from diabetic mice was examined. Immunofluorescence staining (IF) was performed to examine the reactive oxygen species (ROS) level, spindle/chromosome structure, mitochondrial function, actin dynamics, DNA damage and histone modification of oocytes, which are potential factors affecting the oocyte quality. The quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR) was used to detect the mRNA levels of Sod1, Opa1, Mfn2, Drp1, Sirt1 and Sirt3 in oocytes. RESULTS: The NMN supplementation increased the oocyte maturation rate of the mice with diabetes. Furthermore, NMN supplementation improved the oocyte quality by rescuing the actin dynamics, reversing meiotic defects, improving the mitochondrial function, reducing ROS level, suppressing DNA damage and restoring changes in histone modifications of oocytes collected from the mice with diabetes. CONCLUSION: NMN could improve the maturation rate and quality of oocytes in STZ-induced diabetic mice, which provides a significant clue for the treatment of infertility of the patients with diabetes.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) is extensively utilized as an anti-aging agent and possesses anti-inflammatory properties. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) activates Toll-like receptor 4, a process modulated by intracellular signaling pathways such as the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. This study investigated the impact of NMN on osteogenesis in the presence of LPS. METHODS: To elucidate the role of NMN in osteogenesis in the context of Gram-negative bacterial infection after LPS treatment, we cultured a mouse pre-osteoblast cell line (MC3T3-E1) and subsequently incubated it with NMN and/or LPS. We then evaluated osteogenic activity by measuring alkaline phosphatase activity, assessing gene expression and protein levels, and performing Alizarin Red S staining and immunocytochemistry. RESULTS: MC3T3-E1 cells underwent successful differentiation into osteoblasts following treatment with osteogenic induction medium. LPS diminished features related to osteogenic differentiation, which were subsequently partially reversed by treatment with NMN. The restorative effects of NMN on LPS-exposed MC3T3-E1 cells were further substantiated by elucidating the role of Wnt/β-catenin signaling, as confirmed through immunocytochemistry. CONCLUSION: This study showed that infection with Gram-negative bacteria disrupted the osteogenic differentiation of MC3T3-E1 cells. This adverse effect was partially reversed by administering a high-dose of NMN. Drawing on these results, we propose that NMN could serve as a viable therapeutic strategy to preserve bone homeostasis in elderly and immunocompromised patients."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The present study aimed to investigate the effect of β-nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) supplementation on ram sperm quality during storage at 4°C in vitro. METHODS: Tris-citric acid-glucose solution containing different doses of NMN (0, 30, 60, 90, and 120 μM) was used to dilute semen collected from rams and it was stored at 4°C. Sperm motility, plasma membrane integrity as well as acrosome integrity were evaluated at 0, 24, and 48 h time points after storage at 4°C. In addition, sperm mitochondrial activity, lipid peroxidation (LPO), malondialdehyde (MDA) content, reactive oxygen species (ROS) content, glutathione (GSH) content, superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, and apoptosis were measured at 48 h time point after storage at 4°C. RESULTS: Results demonstrate that the values obtained for sperm motility, acrosome integrity, and plasma membrane integrity in the NMN treatments were significantly higher than control (p<0.05). The addition of 60 μM NMN significantly improved ram sperm mitochondrial activity and reduced LPO, MDA content, and ROS content compared to control (p<0.05). Interestingly, sperm GSH content and SOD activity for the 60 μM NMN treatment were much higher than those observed for control. NMN treatment also decreased the level of Cleaved-Caspase 3, Cleaved-Caspase 9, and Bax while increasing Bcl-2 level in sperm at 48 h time point after storage at 4°C. CONCLUSION: Ram sperm quality can be maintained during storage at 4°C with the addition of NMN at 60 μM to the semen extender. NMN also reduces oxidative stress and apoptosis. Overall, these findings suggest that NMN is efficient in improving the viability of ram sperm during storage at 4°C in vitro."

      "abstract": "Triocresyl phosphate (TOCP) was commonly used as flame retardant, plasticizer, lubricant, and jet fuel additive. Studies have shown adverse effects of TOCP on the reproductive system. However, the potential harm brought by TOCP, especially to mammalian female reproductive cells, remains a mystery. In this study, we employed an in vitro model for the first time to investigate the effects of TOCP on the maturation process of mouse oocytes. TOCP exposure hampered the meiotic division process, as evidenced by a reduction in the extrusion of the first polar body from oocytes. Subsequent research revealed the disruption of the oocyte cell cytoskeleton induced by TOCP, resulting in abnormalities in spindle organization, chromosome alignment, and actin filament distribution. This disturbance further extended to the rearrangement of organelles within oocytes, particularly affecting the mitochondria. Importantly, after TOCP treatment, mitochondrial function in oocytes was impaired, leading to oxidative stress, DNA damage, cell apoptosis, and subsequent changes of epigenetic modifications. Supplementation with nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) alleviated the harmful effects of TOCP. NMN exerted its mitigating effects through two fundamental mechanisms. On one hand, NMN conferred stability to the cell cytoskeleton, thereby supporting nuclear maturation. On the other hand, NMN enhanced mitochondrial function within oocytes, reducing the excess reactive oxygen species (ROS), restoring meiotic division abnormalities caused by TOCP, preventing oocyte DNA damage, and suppressing epigenetic changes. These findings not only enhance our understanding of the molecular basis of TOCP induced oocyte damage but also offer a promising avenue for the potential application of NMN in optimizing reproductive treatment strategies.",

In this study, we confirmed the previously observed effects of NMN treatment on glucose uptake and investigated its underlying mechanisms in various tissues and cell lines. Through the most comprehensive proteomic analysis to date, we discovered a series of novel organ-specific effects responsible for glucose uptake as measured by the IPGTT: adipose tissue growing (suggested by increased protein synthesis and degradation and mTOR proliferation signaling upregulation). Notably, we observed the upregulation of thermogenic UCP1, promoting enhanced glucose conversion to heat in intermuscular adipose tissue while showing a surprising repressive effect on mitochondrial biogenesis in muscle and the brain. Additionally, liver and muscle cells displayed a unique response, characterized by spliceosome downregulation and concurrent upregulation of chaperones, proteasomes, and ribosomes, leading to mildly impaired and energy-inefficient protein synthesis machinery. Furthermore, our findings revealed remarkable metabolic rewiring in the brain. This involved increased production of ketone bodies, downregulation of mitochondrial OXPHOS and TCA cycle components, as well as the induction of well-known fasting-associated effects. Collectively, our data elucidate the multifaceted nature of NMN action, highlighting its organ-specific effects and their role in improving glucose uptake. These findings deepen our understanding of NMN's therapeutic potential and pave the way for novel strategies in managing metabolic disorders.",

      "abstract": "Ageing is defined as the degeneration of physiological functions in numerous tissues and organs of an organism, which occurs with age. As we age, the gut undergoes a series of changes and weaknesses that may contribute to overall ageing. Emerging evidence suggests that β-nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) plays a role in regulating intestinal function, but there is still a lack of literature on its role in maintaining the colon health of ageing mice. In our research, Zmpste24-/- mice proved that NMN prolonged their life span and delayed senescence. This study was designed to investigate the effects of long-term intervention on regulating colon function in ageing mice. Our results indicated that NMN improved the pathology of intestinal epithelial cells and intestinal permeability by upregulating the expression of intestinal tight junction proteins and the number of goblet cells, increasing the release of anti-inflammatory factors, and increasing beneficial intestinal bacteria. NMN increased the expression of the proteins SIRT1, NMNAT2, and NMNAT3 and decreased the expression of the protein P53. It also regulated the activity of ISCs by increasing Wnt/β-catenin and Lgr5. Our findings also revealed that NMN caused a significant increase in the relative abundance of Akkermansia muciniphila and Bifidobacterium pseudolongum and notable differences in metabolic pathways related to choline metabolism in cancer. In summary, NMN supplementation can delay frailty in old age, aid healthy ageing, and delay gut ageing.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Chronic overconsumption of lipids followed by their excessive accumulation in the heart leads to cardiomyopathy. The cause of lipid-induced cardiomyopathy involves a pivotal role for the proton-pump vacuolar-type H+-ATPase (v-ATPase), which acidifies endosomes, and for lipid-transporter CD36, which is stored in acidified endosomes. During lipid overexposure, an increased influx of lipids into cardiomyocytes is sensed by v-ATPase, which then disassembles, causing endosomal de-acidification and expulsion of stored CD36 from the endosomes toward the sarcolemma. Once at the sarcolemma, CD36 not only increases lipid uptake but also interacts with inflammatory receptor TLR4 (Toll-like receptor 4), together resulting in lipid-induced insulin resistance, inflammation, fibrosis, and cardiac dysfunction. Strategies inducing v-ATPase reassembly, that is, to achieve CD36 reinternalization, may correct these maladaptive alterations. For this, we used NAD+ (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide)-precursor nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN), inducing v-ATPase reassembly by stimulating glycolytic enzymes to bind to v-ATPase. METHODS: Rats/mice on cardiomyopathy-inducing high-fat diets were supplemented with NMN and for comparison with a cocktail of lysine/leucine/arginine (mTORC1 [mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1]-mediated v-ATPase reassembly). We used the following methods: RNA sequencing, mRNA/protein expression analysis, immunofluorescence microscopy, (co)immunoprecipitation/proximity ligation assay (v-ATPase assembly), myocellular uptake of [3H]chloroquine (endosomal pH), and [14C]palmitate, targeted lipidomics, and echocardiography. To confirm the involvement of v-ATPase in the beneficial effects of both supplementations, mTORC1/v-ATPase inhibitors (rapamycin/bafilomycin A1) were administered. Additionally, 2 heart-specific v-ATPase-knockout mouse models (subunits V1G1/V0d2) were subjected to these measurements. Mechanisms were confirmed in pharmacologically/genetically manipulated cardiomyocyte models of lipid overload. RESULTS: NMN successfully preserved endosomal acidification during myocardial lipid overload by maintaining v-ATPase activity and subsequently prevented CD36-mediated lipid accumulation, CD36-TLR4 interaction toward inflammation, fibrosis, cardiac dysfunction, and whole-body insulin resistance. Lipidomics revealed C18:1-enriched diacylglycerols as lipid class prominently increased by high-fat diet and subsequently reversed/preserved by lysine/leucine/arginine/NMN treatment. Studies with mTORC1/v-ATPase inhibitors and heart-specific v-ATPase-knockout mice further confirmed the pivotal roles of v-ATPase in these beneficial actions. CONCLUSION: NMN preserves heart function during lipid overload by preventing v-ATPase disassembly.",

      "abstract": "Psoriasis is one of several chronic inflammatory skin diseases with a high rate of recurrence, and its pathogenesis remains unclear. Nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN), as an important precursor of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+), has been reported to be a promising agent in treating various diseases, its positive effects including those induced via its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. For this reason, we have aimed to explore the possible role of NMN in the treatment of psoriasis. Psoriasis models were constructed with imiquimod (IMQ) stimulation for 5 days in vivo and with M5 treatment in keratinocyte cell lines in vitro. NMN treatment during the IMQ application period markedly attenuated excess epidermal proliferation, splenomegaly, and inflammatory responses. According to GEO databases, Sirtuin1 (SIRT1) levels significantly decreased in psoriasis patients' lesion tissues; this was also the case in the IMQ-treated mice, while NMN treatment reversed the SIRT1 decline in the mouse model. Moreover, NMN supplementation also improved the prognoses of the mice after IMQ stimulation, compared to the untreated group with elevated SIRT1 levels. In HEKa and HaCaT cells, the co-culturing of NMN and M5 significantly decreased the expression levels of proinflammation factors, the phosphorylation of NF-κB, stimulator of interferon genes (STING) levels, and reactive oxygen species levels. NMN treatment also recovered the decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential and respiration ability and reduced mtDNA in the cytoplasm, leading to the inhibition of autoimmune inflammation. The knockdown of SIRT1 in vitro eliminated the protective and therapeutic effects of NMN against M5. To conclude, our results indicate that NMN protects against IMQ-induced psoriatic inflammation, oxidative stress, and mitochondrial dysfunction by activating the SIRT1 pathway."

However, whether the two compounds have the same or different efficacy against DNA damage is not clear. In the current study, we systematically compared the effects of NMN and NR on cisplatin-induced DNA damage in HeLa cells. METHODS: To evaluate the protective effects of NMN or NR, HeLa cells were pretreated with different doses of NMN or NR followed with 10 μM of cisplatin treatment. Cell viability was examined by Trypan blue staining assay. For observing the DNA damage repair process, HeLa cells were treated with 10 μM of cisplatin for 12 h, followed with 10 mM NMN or NR treatment for another 8, 16, 24, or 32 h, DNA damage levels were assessed for each time point by immunofluorescent staining against phosphor-H2AX (γH2AX) and alkaline comet assay. The effects of NMN and NR on intracellular NAD+ and reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels were also determined. RESULTS: NMN and NR treatment alone did not have any significant effects on cell viability, however, both can protect HeLa cells from cisplatin-induced decrease of cell viability with similar efficacy in a dose-dependent manner. On the other hand, while both can reduce the DNA damage levels in cisplatin-treated cells, NR exhibited better protective effect. However, both appeared to boost the DNA damage repair process with similar efficacy. NMN or NR treatment alone could increase cellular NAD+ levels, and both can reverse cisplatin-induced decrease of NAD+ levels. Finally, while neither NMN nor NR affected cellular ROS levels, both inhibited cisplatin-induced increase of ROS with no significant difference between them. CONCLUSION: NR have a better protective effect against cisplatin-induced DNA damage than NMN."

      "abstract": "Efficient bone reconstruction, especially of the critical size after bone damage, remains a challenge in the clinic. Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell (BMSC) osteogenic differentiation is considered as a promising strategy for bone repair. Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) regulating BMSC fate and cellular function enhance osteogenesis, but is hardly delivered and lack of targeting. Herein, a novel and biocompatible scaffold was fabricated to locally deliver a precursor of NAD+, nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) to the bone defect site, and its bone repair capability and healing mechanism were clarified. NMN-based hyaluronic acid methacryloyl hybrid hydrogel scaffold (denoted as NMN/HAMA) was prepared via photopolymerization. In vitro RT-qPCR analysis, western blotting, Elisa and alizarin red S staining assays demonstrated that the NMN/HAMA hybrid hydrogel regulated BMSCs cellular function in favour of osteogenic differentiation and mineralization by upregulating the mRNA and proteins expression of the osteogenic genes type I pro-collagen (Col-1), bone morphogenic protein 4 (BMP4), and runt-related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2) via the SIRT1 pathway. Implantation of such hybrid hydrogels significantly enhanced bone regeneration in rodent critical calvarial defect models. Furthermore, restoration of the bone defect with NMN administration was inhibited in Prx1 Cre+; SIRT1flox/flox mice, confirming that the NMN/HAMA hybrid hydrogel scaffold promoted bone regeneration via the SIRT1-RUNX2 pathway. These results imply that NMN-based scaffold may be a promising and economic strategy for the treatment of bone defects.",

HCC cells were treated with NMN (125, 250, and 500 μM), and then nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+ ) and NADH levels in HCC cells were measured to calculate NAD+ /NADH ratio. Cell proliferation, apoptosis, autophagy and ferroptosis were determined. AMPK was knocked down to confirm the involvement of AMPK/mTOR signaling. Furthermore, tumor-inhibitory effect of NMN was investigated in xenograft models. Exposure to NMN dose-dependently increased NAD+ level and NAD+ /NADH ratio in HCC cells. After NMN treatment, cell proliferation was inhibited, whereas apoptosis was enhanced in both cell lines. Additionally, NMN dose-dependently enhanced autophagy/ferroptosis and activated AMPK/mTOR pathway in HCC cells. AMPK knockdown partially rescued the effects of NMN in vitro. Furthermore, NMN treatment restrained tumor growth in nude mice, activated autophagy/ferroptosis, and promoted apoptosis and necrosis in tumor tissues. The results indicate that NMN inhibits HCC progression by inducing autophagy and ferroptosis via AMPK/mTOR signaling. NMN may serve as a promising agent for HCC treatment.",

This study aims to clarify if NMN can protect neurons from pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) or Mg2+-free-induced mitochondrial disorder and apoptosis via animal and cell models. We established a continuous 30-day PTZ (37 mg/kg) intraperitoneal injection-induced epileptic mouse model and a cell model induced by Mg2+-free solution incubation to explore the neuroprotective effects of NMN. We found that NMN treatment significantly reduced the seizure intensity of PTZ-induced epileptic mice, improved their learning and memory ability, and enhanced their motor activity and exploration desire. At the same time, in vitro and in vivo experiments showed that NMN can inhibit neuronal apoptosis and improve the mitochondrial energy metabolism function of neurons. In addition, NMN down-regulated the expression of mitochondrial fission proteins (Drp1 and Fis1) and promoted the expression of mitochondrial fusion proteins (Mfn1 and Mfn2) by activating the SIRT1-PGC-1α pathway, thereby inhibiting PTZ or Mg2+-free extracellular solution-induced mitochondrial dysfunction, cell apoptosis, and oxidative stress. However, combined intervention of SIRT1 inhibitor, Selisistat, and PGC-1α inhibitor, SR-18292, eliminated the regulatory effect of NMN pre-treatment on mitochondrial fusion and fission proteins and apoptosis-related proteins. Therefore, NMN intervention may be a new potential treatment for cognitive impairment and behavioral disorders induced by epilepsy, and targeting the SIRT1-PGC-1α pathway may be a promising therapeutic strategy for seizures.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN), an important transforming precursor of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+). Numerous studies have confirmed the neuroprotective effects of NMN in nervous system diseases. However, its role in spinal cord injury (SCI) and the molecular mechanisms involved have yet to be fully elucidated. METHODS: We established a moderate-to-severe model of SCI by contusion (70 kdyn) using a spinal cord impactor. The drug was administered immediately after surgery, and mice were intraperitoneally injected with either NMN (500 mg NMN/kg body weight per day) or an equivalent volume of saline for seven days. The central area of the spinal cord was harvested seven days after injury for the systematic analysis of global gene expression by RNA Sequencing (RNA-seq) and finally validated using qRT-PCR. RESULTS: NMN supplementation restored NAD+ levels after SCI, promoted motor function recovery, and alleviated pain. This could potentially be associated with alterations in NAD+ dependent enzyme levels. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) revealed that NMN can inhibit inflammation and potentially regulate signaling pathways, including interleukin-17 (IL-17), tumor necrosis factor (TNF), toll-like receptor, nod-like receptor, and chemokine signaling pathways. In addition, the construction of a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network and the screening of core genes showed that interleukin 1β (IL-1β), interferon regulatory factor 7 (IRF 7), C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 10 (Cxcl10), and other inflammationrelated factors, changed significantly after NMN treatment. qRT-PCR confirmed the inhibitory effect of NMN on inflammatory factors (IL-1β, TNF-α, IL-17A, IRF7) and chemokines (chemokine ligand 3, Cxcl10) in mice following SCI. CONCLUSION: The reduction of NAD+ levels after SCI can be compensated by NMN supplementation, which can significantly restore motor function and relieve pain in a mouse model. RNA-seq and qRT-PCR systematically revealed that NMN affected inflammation-related signaling pathways, including the IL-17, TNF, Toll-like receptor, NOD-like receptor and chemokine signaling pathways, by down-regulating the expression of inflammatory factors and chemokines."

      "abstract": "Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) is an essential element in cellular metabolism that regulates fundamental biological processes. Growing evidence suggests that a decline in NAD+ is a common pathological factor in various diseases and aging. However, its role in airway epithelial barrier function in response to asthma remains underexplored. The current study aims to explore the efficacy of restoring cellular NAD+ concentration through supplementation with the NAD+ precursor, nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN), in the treatment of allergic asthma and to investigate the role of SIRT3 in mediating the effects of NAD+ precursors. In this research, NMN alleviated airway inflammation and reduced mucus secretion in house dust mite (HDM)-induced asthmatic mice. It also mitigated airway epithelial barrier disruption in HDM-induced asthma in vitro and in vivo. But inhibition of SIRT3 expression abolished the effects of NMN. Mechanistically, HDM induced SIRT3 SUMOylation and proteasomal degradation. Mutation of these two SIRT3 SUMO modification sites enhanced the stability of SIRT3. Additionally, SIRT3 was targeted by SENP1 which acted to de-conjugate SUMO. And down-regulation of SENP1 expression in HDM-induced models was reversed by NMN. Collectively, these findings suggest that NMN attenuates airway epithelial barrier dysfunction via inhibiting SIRT3 SUMOylation in asthma. Blockage of SIRT3 SUMOylation emerges as for the treatment of allergic asthma.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: HIV-1-associated immune activation drives CD4+ T cell depletion and the development of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. We aimed to determine the role of nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN), the direct precursor of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) co-enzyme, in CD4+ T cell modulation during HIV-1 infection. METHODS: We examined HIV-1 integrated DNA or transcribed RNA, intracellular p24 protein, and T cell activation markers in CD4+ T cells including in vitro HIV-1-infected cells, reactivated patient-derived cells, and in HIV-1-infected humanized mice, under NMN treatment. RNA-seq and CyTOF analyses were used for investigating the effect of NMN on CD4+ T cells. FINDINGS: We found that NMN increased the intracellular NAD amount, resulting in suppressed HIV-1 p24 production and proliferation in infected CD4+ T cells, especially in activated CD25+CD4+ T cells. NMN also inhibited CD25 expression on reactivated resting CD4+ T cells derived from cART-treated people living with HIV-1 (PLWH). In HIV-1-infected humanized mice, the frequency of CD4+ T cells was reconstituted significantly by combined cART and NMN treatment as compared with cART or NMN alone, which correlated with suppressed hyperactivation of CD4+ T cells. INTERPRETATION: Our results highlight the suppressive role of NMN in CD4+ T cell activation during HIV-1 infection. It warrants future clinical investigation of NMN as a potential treatment in combination with cART in PLWH.

The results indicated that AlCl3-induced testicular damage, leading to reduced sperm quality, increased apoptosis, decreased cell proliferation, and impaired Sertoli cell function in rats. Additionally, glycolytic metabolism was observed to be hindered. However, after NMN treatment, there was a noticeable improvement in testicular damage among the rats, marked by increased sperm quality, reduced apoptosis, enhanced cell proliferation, improved Sertoli cell function, and an activated glycolytic metabolism. The findings of this study suggest that NMN alleviates testicular spermatogenesis impairment induced by AlCl3 exposure through the inhibition of spermatogenic cell apoptosis, promotion of spermatogenic cell proliferation, and activation of glycolytic pathways. The study contributes an experimental foundation for potential future clinical applications of NMN in cases of AlCl3-exposed spermatogenic dysfunction.",

      "abstract": "Vascular dementia (VD) is characterized with vascular cognitive impairment (VCI), which currently has few effective therapies in clinic. Neuronal damage and white matter injury are involved in the pathogenesis of VCI. Citicoline has been demonstrated to exhibit neuroprotection and neurorepair to improve cognition in cerebrovascular diseases. Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+)-dependent sirtuin (SIRT) signaling pathway constitutes a strong intrinsic defense system against various stresses including neuroinflammation in VCI. Our hypothesis is that the combined use of citicoline and the precursor of NAD+, nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN), could enhance action on cognitive function in VCI. We investigated the synergistic effect of these two drugs in the rat model of VCI by bilateral common carotid artery occlusion (BCCAO). Citicoline significantly enhanced neurite outgrowth in Neuro-2a cells, and the combination of citicoline and NMN remarkably induced neurite outgrowth in Neuro-2a cells and primary cortical neuronal cells with an optimal proportion of 4:1. In the rat model of BCCAO, when two drugs in combination of 160 mg/kg citicoline and 40 mg/kg NMN, this combination administrated at 7 days post-BCCAO significantly improved the cognitive impairment in BCCAO rats compared with vehicle group by the analysis of the Morris water maze and the novel object recognition test. This combination also decreased microglial activation and neuroinflammation, and protected white matter integrity indicated by the increased myelin basic protein (MBP) expression through activation of SIRT1/TORC1/CREB signaling pathway. Our results suggest that the combination of citicoline and NMN has a synergistic effect for the treatment of VD associated with VCI.",

However, the currently used treatments are associated with various challenges and the traditionally used dressings lack functional efficacy. Oxidative stress is believed to play a vital role in diabetic wound healing. Therefore, nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN), which is known for its antioxidant properties, offers the potential to accelerate the wound-healing process. Here, a thermosensitive composite hydrogel was synthesized by mixing Pluronic F127 and Pluronic F68 with an antibacterial component chitosan. The hydrogel exhibited favorable properties including a stable structure, appropriate solid-liquid phase change, loose porosity, slow-release, antibacterial properties, and biocompatibility. In vitro experiments demonstrated that the NMN-loaded temperature-sensitive hydrogel effectively promoted cell proliferation, migration, and angiogenesis and exhibited antioxidant activity. In diabetic thickness skin defect models, NMN-loaded temperature-sensitive hydrogel treatment significantly accelerated wound healing by promoting collagen synthesis, angiogenesis, and increased expression of vascular endothelial growth factor and transforming growth factor- β1. In summary, NMN-loaded temperature-sensitive hydrogel can promote diabetic wound healing in a simple, economical, effective, and safe manner, with potential application in treating diabetic wounds."

Ultra-high performance liquid chromatography coupled to triple quadrupole tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-ESI-QqQ-MS/MS) was established for the determination and targeted analysis of NMN, nicotinamide riboside (NR), nicotinic acid (NA), Nam, and NAD+ in YS01 cells. Satisfactory precision and accuracy values were achieved with recoveries above 70% for five analytes. A 5~100 times higher content of NMN in YS01 (0.24~103.40 mg/kg) than in some common foods (0.0~18.8 mg/kg) was found. Combined with genome sequencing and enzyme function annotation, target-acting enzymes, including nudC, ISN1, URH1, PNP, and SIR2, were identified, and the biosynthetic pathway of NMN via Nam was suggested. The initial addition of 3 g/L Nam in the culture medium effectively promoted the generation of NMN, which raised the content of NMN by 39%.

Major inflammatory mediators, including IL6 and PARP family members, were grouped into coexpressed gene modules and significantly downregulated under NMN exposure in poly(I:C)-activated conditions in both cell types. The Bayesian network analysis of module hub genes predicted common genes, including eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4B (EIF4B), and distinct genes, such as platelet-derived growth factor binding molecules, in HCAECs, which potentially regulate the identified inflammation modules. These results suggest a robust regulatory mechanism by which NMN alleviates inflammatory pathway activation, which may open up the possibility of a new role for NMN replenishment in the treatment of chronic or acute inflammation.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Chronic lung injury and dysregulated cellular homeostasis in response to particulate matter (PM) exposure are closely associated with adverse health effects. However, an effective intervention for preventing the adverse health effects has not been developed. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to evaluate the protective effects of nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) supplementation on lung injury and elucidate the mechanism by which NMN improved immune function following subchronic PM exposure. METHODS: Six-week-old male C57BL/6J mice were placed in a real-ambient PM exposure system or filtered air-equipped chambers (control) for 16 wk with or without NMN supplementation in drinking water (regarded as Con-H2O, Exp-H2O, Con-NMN and Exp-NMN groups, respectively) in Shijiazhuang City, China (n=20/group). The effects of NMN supplementation (500mg/kg) on PM-induced chronic pulmonary inflammation were assessed, and its mechanism was characterized using single-cell transcriptomic sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis of whole lung cells. RESULTS: The NMN-treated mice exhibited higher NAD+ levels in multiple tissues. Following 16-wk PM exposure, slightly less pulmonary inflammation and less collagen deposition were noted in mice with NMN supplementation in response to real-ambient PM exposure (Exp-NMN group) compared with the Exp-H2O group (all p<0.05). Mouse lung tissue isolated from the Exp-NMN group was characterized by fewer neutrophils, monocyte-derived cells, fibroblasts, and myeloid-derived suppressor cells induced by subchronic PM exposure as detected by scRNA-seq transcriptomic analysis. The improved immune functions were further characterized by interleukin-17 signaling pathway inhibition and lower secretion of profibrotic cytokines in the Exp-NMN group compared with the Exp-H2O group. In addition, reduced proportions of differentiated myofibroblasts and profibrotic interstitial macrophages were identified in the NMN-supplemented mice in response to PM exposure. Furthermore, less immune function suppression and altered differentiation of pathological cell phenotypes NMN was related to intracellular lipid metabolism activation. DISCUSSION: Our novel findings suggest that NMN supplementation mitigated PM-induced lung injury by regulating immune functions and improving lipid metabolism in male mice, providing a putative intervention method for prevention of human health effects associated with PM exposure. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP12259.",

      "abstract": "Nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN), a naturally occurring biologically active nucleotide, mainly functions via mediating the biosynthesis of NAD+. In recent years, its excellent pharmacological activities including anti-aging, treating neurodegenerative diseases, and protecting the heart have attracted increasing attention from scholars and entrepreneurs for production of a wide range of formulations, including functional food ingredients, health care products, active pharmaceuticals, and pharmaceutical intermediates. Presently, the synthesis methods of NMN mainly include two categories: chemical synthesis and biosynthesis. With the development of biocatalyst engineering and synthetic biology strategies, bio-preparation has proven to be efficient, economical, and sustainable methods. This review summarizes the chemical synthesis and biosynthetic pathways of NMN and provides an in-depth investigation on the mining and modification of enzyme resources during NMN biosynthesis, as well as the screening of hosts and optimization of chassis cells via metabolic engineering, which provide effective strategies for efficient production of NMN. In addition, an overview of the significant physiological functions and activities of NMN is elaborated. Finally, future research on technical approaches to further enhance NMN synthesis and strengthen clinical studies of NMN are prospected, which would lay the foundation for further promoting the application of NMN in nutrition, healthy food, and medicine in the future.

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: The burden of ocular diseases has been gradually increasing worldwide. Various factors are suggested for the development and progression of ocular diseases, such as ocular inflammation, oxidative stress, and complex metabolic dysregulation. Thus, managing ocular diseases requires the modulation of pathologic signaling pathways through many mechanisms. Nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) is a bioactive molecule naturally found in life forms. NMN is a direct precursor of the important molecule nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+), an essential co-enzyme required for enormous cellular functions in most life forms. While the recent experimental evidence of NMN treatment in various metabolic diseases has been well-reviewed, NMN treatment in ocular diseases has not been comprehensively summarized yet. In this regard, we aimed to focus on the therapeutic roles of NMN treatment in various ocular diseases with recent advances. METHODS: How we came to our current opinion with a recent summary was described based on our own recent reports as well as a search of the related literature. RESULTS: We found that NMN treatment might be available for the prevention of and protection from various experimental ocular diseases, as NMN treatment modulated ocular inflammation, oxidative stress, and complex metabolic dysregulation in murine models for eye diseases such as ischemic retinopathy, corneal defect, glaucoma, and age-related macular degeneration. CONCLUSION: Our current review suggests and discusses new modes of actions of NMN for the prevention of and protection from various ocular diseases and can urge future research to obtain more solid evidence on a potential future NMN treatment in ocular diseases at the preclinical stages.",

Nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) has a therapeutic effect on neurodegenerative diseases, but the role of NMN on NP-induced learning and memory impairment is not known. Here, we examined the mitigative effect of NMN on the impaired learning and memory ability of rats exposed to NP. The NP impaired learning and memory in rats, while the low-dose intervention with NMN significantly prolonged the step-through latency of the PAT and improved the NAMPT and NMNAT1 content in brain tissue. At the same time, the NMN intervention also increased the content of 5-HTR1A, 5-HTR4, and 5-HTR6 related to learning and memory in the hippocampus. In line with this, we found that the NMN intervention activated the SIRT1/MAO-A pathway in brain tissue. NMN intervention, especially at 125 mg/kg doses, may improve rats' NP-induced learning and memory impairment via the central 5-HT system and the NAD+/SIRT1/MAO-A pathway in the brain.",

Nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN), one of the precursors for nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) synthesis, reduces the brain features of AD, including neuroinflammation, mitochondrial abnormalities, synaptic dysfunction, and cognitive impairment. However, the impact of NMN on the gut flora of AD is still unknown. In the current study, we investigated the relationship between gut flora and NMN treatment in APP/PS1 transgenic (AD) mice through the 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) high-throughput sequencing analysis of mouse feces after being treated with NMN for 16 weeks. The results show that the NMN significantly changed the intestinal microbial community composition in AD mice. The NMN also increased the relative abundance of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs)-producing bacteria such as Lactobacillus and Bacteroides at the genus level by protecting intestinal health and improving AD. The overall results suggest novel therapeutic strategies for treating AD and highlight the critical role of gut microbiota in AD pathology, and layout the further research.",

So new treatment method needs to be taken to improve the treatment effect. MN supplementation is a potential promising new method for the treatment of insomnia, resulting in a rising need for methodological research towards verifying its efficacy. METHODS/DESIGN: We describe a proposal for a multicenter, patient-assessor-blinded, randomized controlled trial with two parallel arms. A total of 400 chronic insomnia patients will be allocated 1:1 to the intervention group (treatment with oral NMN 320 mg/day) or control group (treatment with oral placebo). All subjects are clinical chronic insomnia patients who meet all inclusion criteria. All subjects are treated by taking NMN or placebo. The primary outcome is the score on the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Secondary outcomes are the score on the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) and Epworth Sleeping Scale (ESS), the total sleep time (TST), sleep efficiency (SE), sleep latency, and REM sleep latency to assess sleep quality changes. Subjects are assessed at two time points: baseline and follow-up. The duration of the clinical trial is 60 days. DISCUSSION: This study will provide more evidence on the effects of NMN on improving sleep quality among patients with chronic insomnia. If proven effective, NMN supplement can be used as a new treatment for chronic insomnia in the future. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (chictr.org.cn) ChiCTR2200058001.

      "abstract": "Sepsis-associated encephalopathy (SAE) is one of the common serious complications in sepsis, and the pathogenesis of SAE remains unclear. Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) has been reported to be downregulated in the hippocampus and SIRT1 agonists can attenuated the cognitive dysfunction in septic mice. Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) is a key substrate to maintain the deacetylation activity of SIRT1. As an intermediate of NAD+, β-Nicotinamide Mononucleotide (NMN) has been reported to be promising in treating neurodegenerative diseases and cerebral ischemic injury. Thus we sought to investigate the potential role of NMN in SAE treatment. The SAE model was established by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) in vivo, and neuroinflammation model was established with LPS-treated BV-2 cells in vitro. Memory impairment was assessed by Morris water maze and fear conditioning tests. As a result, the levels of NAD+, SIRT1 and PGC-1α were significantly reduced in the hippocampus of septic mice, while the acetylation of total lysine, phosphorylation of P38 and P65 were enhanced. All these changes induced by sepsis were inverted by NMN. Treating with NMN resulted in improved behavior performance in the fear conditioning tests and Morris water maze. Apoptosis, inflammatory and oxidative responses in the hippocampus of septic mice were attenuated significantly after NMN administration. These protective effect of NMN against memory dysfunction, inflammatory and oxidative injuries were reversed by the SIRT1 inhibitor, EX-527. Similarly, LPS-induced activation of BV-2 cells were attenuated by NMN, EX-527 or SIRT1 knockdown could reverse such effect of NMN in vitro. In conclusion, NMN is protective against sepsis-induced memory dysfunction, and the inflammatory and oxidative injuries in the hippocampus region of septic mice. The NAD+/SIRT1 pathway might be involved in one of the mechanisms of the protective effect.",

The current study aimed to investigate whether nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) supplementation protected against the osteopenia in hindlimb unloading (HLU) rats in vivo and modeled microgravity-induced osteoblastic dysfunction in vitro. The 3-mo-old rats were exposed to HLU and intragastrically administered NMN every 3 days (500 mg/kg body weight) for 4 weeks. NMN supplementation mitigated HLU-induced bone loss, evidenced by greater bone mass and biomechanical properties and better trabecular bone structure. NMN supplementation mitigated HLU-induced oxidative stress, evidenced by greater levels of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide and activities of superoxide dismutase 2 and lesser malondialdehyde levels. Modeled microgravity stimulation using rotary wall vessel bioreactor in MC3T3-E1 cells inhibited osteoblast differentiation, which was reversed by NMN treatment. Furthermore, NMN treatment mitigated microgravity-induced mitochondrial impairments, evidenced by lesser reactive oxygen species generation and greater adenosine triphosphate production, mtDNA copy number, and activities of superoxide dismutase 2 and Complex I and II. Additionally, NMN promoted activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), evidenced by greater AMPKα phosphorylation.

Although the administration of nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN), a key NAD+ intermediate, has been shown to ameliorate metabolic disorders, such as insulin resistance and glucose intolerance, the direct effect of NMN on the regulation of lipid metabolism in adipocytes remains unclear. We here investigated the effect of NMN on lipid storage in 3T3-L1 differentiated adipocytes. Oil-red O staining showed that NMN treatment reduced lipid accumulation in these cells. NMN was found to enhance lipolysis in adipocytes since the concentration of glycerol in the media was increased by NMN treatment. Western blotting and real-time RT-PCR analysis revealed that adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) expression at both protein and mRNA level was increased with NMN treatment in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Whereas NMN increased SIRT1 expression and AMPK activation, an AMPK inhibitor compound C restored the NMN-dependent upregulation of ATGL expression in these cells, suggesting that NMN upregulates ATGL expression through the SIRT1-AMPK axis. NMN administration significantly decreased subcutaneous fat mass in mice on a high-fat diet. We also found that adipocyte size in subcutaneous fat was decreased with NMN treatment. Consistent with the alteration of fat mass and adipocyte size, the ATGL expression in subcutaneous fat was slightly, albeit significantly, increased with NMN treatment. These results indicate that NMN suppresses subcutaneous fat mass in diet-induced obese mice, potentially in part via the upregulation of ATGL. Unexpectedly, the reduction in fat mass as well as ATGL upregulation with NMN treatment were not observed in epididymal fat, implying that the effects of NMN are site-specific in adipose tissue. Thus, these findings provide important insights into the mechanism of NMN/NAD+ in the regulation of metabolism."

      "abstract": "The prognosis of myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury is poor in elderly patients. Aging increases the susceptibility of the heart to cell death from I/R injury and prevents the optimal effectiveness of cardioprotective modalities. Since the interaction of aging with cardioprotection is multifactorial, combination therapy may overcome the above-mentioned burden through correcting various components of the injury. Here, we explored the effects of nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN)/melatonin combination therapy on mitochondrial biogenesis and fission/fusion, autophagy, and microRNA-499 in the aged rat heart with reperfusion injury. Ex vivo model of myocardial I/R injury was established by coronary occlusion and re-opening in 30 aged male Wistar rats (400-450 g, 22-24 months old). NMN (100 mg/kg/48 h, intraperitoneally) was administered over 28 days before I/R, and melatonin (50 µM) was added to the perfusion solution at early reperfusion. CK-MB release and expression of mitochondrial biogenesis genes and proteins, mitochondrial fission/fusion proteins, autophagy genes, and microRNA-499 were assessed. NMN/melatonin combination therapy concomitantly decreased CK-MB release in aged reperfused hearts (P < .001). It also upregulated SIRT1/PGC-1α/Nrf1/TFAM profiles at both gene and protein levels, Mfn2 protein, and microRNA-499 expression, and downregulated Drp1 protein and Beclin1, LC3, and p62 genes (P < .05 to P < .001). The effect of combination therapy was greater than individual ones. Co-application of NMN/melatonin within the setting of I/R injury in the aged rat heart induced noticeable cardioprotection through modulation of a coordinated network including microRNA-499 expression along with mitochondrial biogenesis associated with SIRT1/PGC-1α/Nrf1/TFAM profiles, mitochondrial fission/fusion, and autophagy, therefore, appears to prevent the burden of myocardial I/R injury in elderly patients.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The metabolic and intracellular abnormalities in aging and diabetes cause loss of cardioprotection by routine interventions against myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. We aimed to evaluate the possible interaction of aging and type-2 diabetes mellitus with cardioprotection and the potential protective effect of a mitochondrial cocktail (melatonin/nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN)/ubiquinol) on myocardial I/R injury in aged diabetic rats. METHODS: Male Wistar rats (n = 108, 22-24 months old, 400-450 g) received high-fat diet/low dose of streptozotocin to induce type-2 diabetes, then were randomized into 9 groups of 12 rats each with/without I/R and/or melatonin, NMN, and ubiquinol, alone or in dual or triple combinations. Myocardial I/R was induced by LAD occlusion for 30 min followed by 24 h reperfusion. NMN (100 mg/kg/48 h, intraperitoneally) was administered for 28 days before I/R operation. Melatonin (10 mg/kg, intraperitoneally) and/or ubiquinol (30 mg/kg, intravenously) were administered at early reperfusion. Finally, hemodynamic index changes, infarct size, CK-MB levels, mitochondrial functional endpoints, and expression of mitochondrial biogenesis genes (SIRT-1/PGC-1α/NRF-2/TFAM) were assessed. RESULTS: The solo and dual applications of melatonin, NMN, and ubiquinol did not exert remarkable cardioprotective impacts. However, the triple combination improved myocardial function and decreased infarct size and CK-MB levels following myocardial I/R (P < .05 to P < .01). It also improved mitochondrial function and restored mitochondrial biogenesis genes (P < .01). CONCLUSIONS: Combination therapy with melatonin, NMN, and ubiquinol exerted significant cardioprotection and improved mitochondrial function and biogenesis via upregulation of SIRT-1/PGC-1α/NRF-2/TFAM profiles in aged diabetic rats and, thus, offers a promising strategy for providing noticeable cardioprotection against I/R injury also in aged diabetic patients.",

Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+ ) is an important molecule in energy and signal transduction, and NAD+ supplementation therapy is a new treatment for obesity in recent years. Liver kinase B1 (LKB1) is an energy metabolism regulator. The relationship between NAD+ and LKB1 has only been studied in the heart and has not yet been reported in obesity. Nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN), as a direct precursor of NAD+ , can effectively enhance the level of NAD+ . In the current study, we showed that NMN intervention altered body composition in obese mice, characterized by a reduction in fat mass and an increase in lean mass. NMN reversed high-fat diet-induced blood lipid levels then contributed to reducing hepatic steatosis. NMN also improved glucose tolerance and alleviated adipose tissue inflammation. Moreover, our data suggested that NMN supplementation may be depends on the NAD+ /SIRT6/LKB1 pathway to regulate brown adipose metabolism. These results provided new evidence for NMN in obesity treatment.",

The estrogenic actions of BBP have detrimental effects on humans and animals. In this study, the specific influence of BBP on mouse oocyte maturation was investigated using in vivo and in vitro models. The experiment first verified that BBP exposure significantly affected the rate of oocyte exclusion of the first polar body, although it did not affect germinal vesicle breakdown (GVBD) through in vitro oocyte culture system. Results of in vitro fertilization show that BBP exposure affects blastocyst rate. Subsequently, the results obtained by immunofluorescence staining technology showed that oocyte spindle organization, chromosomal arrangement and the distribution of cortical actin were disrupted by BBP exposure, and led to the failure of oocyte meiotic maturation and the subsequent early embryo development. Singe-cell transcriptome analysis found that BBP exposure altered the expression levels of 588 genes, most associated with mitochondria-related oxidative stress. Further analysis demonstrated that the detrimental effects of BBP involved the disruption of mitochondrial function and oxidative stress-induced early apoptosis. Nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) supplementation reduced the adverse effects of BBP. Collectively, these findings revealed a mechanism of BBP-induced toxicity on female reproduction and showed that NMN provides an effective treatment for BBP actions.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Chemotherapy-induced cognitive impairment (CICI) is a neurotoxic side effect of chemotherapy that has yet to have an effective treatment. OBJECTIVE: Using cisplatin, a platinum-based chemotherapy together with excitatory cortical neurons derived from human induced pluripotent cells (iPSCs) to model of CICI, our recent study demonstrated that dysregulation of brain NAD+ metabolism contributes to cisplatin-induced impairments in neurogenesis and cognitive function, which was prevented by administration of the NAD+ precursor, nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN). However, it remains unclear how cisplatin causes neurogenic dysfunction and the mechanism by which NMN prevents cisplatin-induced cognitive impairment. Given that mitochondrial dysfunction is thought to play a prominent role in age-related neurodegenerative disease and chemotherapy-induced neurotoxicity, we sought to explore if NMN prevents chemotherapy-related neurotoxicity by attenuating cisplatin-induced mitochondrial damage. RESULTS: We demonstrate that cisplatin induces neuronal DNA damage, increases generation of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) and decreases ATP production, all of which are indicative of oxidative DNA damage and mitochondrial functional defects. Ultrastructural analysis revealed that cisplatin caused loss of cristae membrane integrity and matrix swelling in human cortical neurons. Notably, pretreatment with NMN prevents cisplatin-induced defects in mitochondria of human cortical neurons. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that increased mitochondrial oxidative stress and functional defects play key roles in cisplatin-induced neurotoxicity. Thus, NMN may be an effective therapeutic strategy to prevent cisplatin-induced deleterious effects on mitochondria, making this organelle a key factor in amelioration of cisplatin-induced cognitive impairments."

      "abstract": "The occurrence and development of aortic aneurysms are accompanied by senescence of human aortic smooth muscle cells (HASMCs). Because the mechanism of HASMC senescence has not been fully elucidated, the efficacy of various antisenescence treatments varies. Decreased nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD + ) levels are one of the mechanisms of cell senescence, and there is a lack of evidence on whether increasing NAD + levels could alleviate HASMC senescence and further retard the progression of aortic aneurysms.We constructed an HASMC-based organ-on-a-chip microphysiological model. RNA sequencing was performed on cell samples from the vehicle control and angiotensin II groups to explore biological differences. We detected cellular senescence markers and NAD + levels in HASMC-based organ-on-a-chip. Subsequently, we pretreated HASMC using the synthetic precursor of NAD + , nicotinamide mononucleotide, and angiotensin II treatment, and used rhythmic stretching to investigate whether nicotinamide mononucleotide could delay HASMC senescence.The HASMC-based organ-on-a-chip model can simulate the biomechanical microenvironment of HASMCs in vivo, and the use of angiotensin II in the model replicated senescence in HASMCs. The senescence of HASMCs was accompanied by downregulation of the expression level of nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase and NAD + . Pretreatment with nicotinamide mononucleotide significantly increased the NAD + level and alleviated the senescence of HASMCs, but did not change the expression level of nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase.Our study provides a complementary research platform between traditional cell culture and animal experiments to explore HASMC senescence in aortic aneurysms. Furthermore, it provides evidence for NAD + boosting therapy in the clinical treatment of aortic aneurysms.",

      "abstract": "Nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) is a natural antioxidant approved as a nutritional supplement and food ingredient, but its protective role in silicosis characterized by oxidative damage remains unknown. In this study, we generated a silicosis model by intratracheal instillation of silica, and then performed histopathological, biochemical, and transcriptomic analysis to evaluate the role of NMN in silicosis. We found that NMN mitigated lung damage at 7 and 28 days, manifested as a decreasing coefficient of lung weight and histological changes, and alleviated oxidative damage by reducing levels of reactive oxygen species and increasing glutathione. Meanwhile, NMN treatment also reduced the recruitment of inflammatory cells and inflammatory infiltration in lung tissue. Transcriptomic analysis showed that NMN treatment mainly regulated immune response and glutathione metabolism pathways. Additionally, NMN upregulated the expression of antioxidant genes Gstm1, Gstm2, and Mgst1 by promoting the expression and nuclear translocation of nuclear factor-erythroid 2 related factor 2 (Nrf2). Gene interaction analysis showed that Nrf2 interacted with Gstm1 and Mgst1 through Gtsm2. Promisingly, oxidative damage mediated by these genes occurred mainly in fibroblasts. In summary, NMN alleviates silica-induced oxidative stress and lung injury by regulating the endogenous glutathione metabolism pathways. This study reveals that NMN supplementation might be a promising strategy for mitigating oxidative stress and inflammation in silicosis.",

Retinal ischemia is involved in enormous pathological processes including oxidative stress, reactive gliosis, and retinal functional deficits. Thus, maintaining retinal function by modulating those pathological processes may prevent or protect against vision loss. Over the decades, nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN), a crucial nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) intermediate, has been nominated as a promising therapeutic target in retinal diseases. Nonetheless, a protective effect of NMN has not been examined in cardiovascular diseases-induced retinal ischemia. In our study, we aimed to investigate its promising effect of NMN in the ischemic retina of a murine model of carotid artery occlusion. After surgical unilateral common carotid artery occlusion (UCCAO) in adult male C57BL/6 mice, NMN (500 mg/kg/day) was intraperitoneally injected to mice every day until the end of experiments. Electroretinography and biomolecular assays were utilized to measure ocular functional and further molecular alterations in the retina. We found that UCCAO-induced retinal dysfunction was suppressed, pathological gliosis was reduced, retinal NAD+ levels were preserved, and the expression of an antioxidant molecule (nuclear factor erythroid-2-related factor 2; Nrf2) was upregulated by consecutive administration of NMN. Our present outcomes first suggest a promising NMN therapy for the suppression of cardiovascular diseases-mediated retinal ischemic dysfunction.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) is a nucleotide that is commonly recognized for its role as an intermediate of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) biosynthesis with multiple pharmacological effects. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the protective effect of nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) against lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced acute lung injury (ALI). METHODS: We investigated the effect of NMN on ALI-induced inflammatory response, oxidative stress, and cell apoptosis. The ALI mouse model was performed by injecting LPS intratracheally at a dose of 10 mg/kg in 50 μL saline. Flow cytometry was used to detect neutrophil infiltration in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), and ELISA was used to detect the contents of inflammatory cytokines TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6 in BALF. Oxidative stress was evaluated by determining the superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity and malondialdehyde (MDA) content in lung tissue. ROS formation was analyzed by immunofluorescence. Western blotting was performed to detect apoptotic levels and p38MAPK/NF-κB phosphorylation levels in lung tissue. RESULTS: In the ALI mouse model, NMN showed a significant therapeutic effect compared to the LPS group. NMN attenuated the pathological damage and cell apoptosis in lung tissue, decreased the levels of TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 in BALF, and reduced the number of total cells and neutrophils in BALF. In addition, NMN attenuated the LPS-induced elevation of dry-to-wet ratio, MDA content, p38 MAPK and p65 NF-κB phosphorylation levels, and the SOD activity was increased by NMN treatment. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, the present study showed that NMN exerted a protective effect on LPS-induced ALI with anti-inflammatory, antioxidative, and antiapoptotic effects.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Gut microbiota dysbiosis induced by acute pancreatitis (AP) exacerbates pancreatic injury and systemic inflammatory responses. The alleviation of gut microbiota dysbiosis through faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is considered a potential strategy to reduce tissue damage and inflammation in many clinical disorders. Here, we aim to investigate the effect of gut microbiota and microbiota-derived metabolites on AP and further clarify the mechanisms associated with pancreatic damage and inflammation. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: AP rat and mouse models were established by administration of caerulein or sodium taurocholate in vivo. Pancreatic acinar cells were exposed to caerulein and lipopolysaccharide in vitro to simulate AP. KEY RESULTS: Normobiotic FMT alleviated AP-induced gut microbiota dysbiosis and ameliorated the severity of AP, including mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative damage and inflammation. Normobiotic FMT induced higher levels of NAD+ (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide)-associated metabolites, particularly nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN). NMN administration mitigated AP-mediated mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative damage and inflammation by increasing pancreatic NAD+ levels. Similarly, overexpression of the NAD+ -dependent mitochondrial deacetylase sirtuin 3 (SIRT3) alleviated the severity of AP. Furthermore, SIRT3 deacetylated peroxiredoxin 5 (PRDX5) and enhanced PRDX5 protein expression, thereby promoting its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities in AP. Importantly, normobiotic FMT-mediated NMN metabolism induced SIRT3-PRDX5 pathway activation during AP. CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS: Gut microbiota-derived NMN alleviates the severity of AP by activating the SIRT3-PRDX5 pathway. Normobiotic FMT could be served as a potential strategy for AP treatment.",

However, the high content of NMN in natural plants has not been fully explored as herbal medicines for drug development. Here, we identified that the leaf of Cinnamomum verum J. Presl (C. verum) was the highest NMN content among the Plant Extract Library (PEL) with food experience, using ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS). To validate this result, the extraction and quantitative analysis of bark, leaf, root, and stem of fresh C. verum was conducted. The results revealed that the bark had the highest NMN content in C. verum (0.471 mg/100 g). Our study shed light on the prospects of developing natural plants in the context of NMN as drugs for anti-aging and prevention of aging-related diseases. The future should focus on the development and application of C. verum pharmaceutical formulations.",

Retinal I/R injury is associated with pathological increases in reactive oxygen species and inflammation, resulting in retinal neuronal cell death. To date, effective therapies have not been developed. Nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN), a key nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) intermediate, has been shown to exert neuroprotection for retinal diseases. However, it remains unclear whether NMN can prevent retinal I/R injury. Thus, we aimed to determine whether NMN therapy is useful for retinal I/R injury-induced retinal degeneration. One day after NMN intraperitoneal (IP) injection, adult mice were subjected to retinal I/R injury. Then, the mice were injected with NMN once every day for three days. Electroretinography and immunohistochemistry were used to measure retinal functional alterations and retinal inflammation, respectively. The protective effect of NMN administration was further examined using a retinal cell line, 661W, under CoCl2-induced oxidative stress conditions. NMN IP injection significantly suppressed retinal functional damage, as well as inflammation. NMN treatment showed protective effects against oxidative stress-induced cell death. The antioxidant pathway (Nrf2 and Hmox-1) was activated by NMN treatment. In conclusion, NMN could be a promising preventive neuroprotective drug for ischemic retinopathy.",

Several studies have demonstrated that NAD+ levels can be efficiently replenished via nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) intake; additionally, the safety of its oral ingestion has been confirmed in recent clinical trials. However, the efficacy and safety of intravenous NMN administration in humans remain unclear. Therefore, we verified its safety in 10 healthy volunteers. Intravenous administration of NMN did not affect electrocardiograms, pulse, and blood pressure, nor did it affect metabolic markers in the liver, heart, pancreas, and kidneys. These results indicate that intravenous NMN administration is safe and beneficial in humans. Furthermore, NMN administration significantly increased blood NAD+ levels without damaging blood cells and significantly reduced blood triglyceride (TG) levels. These findings imply that intravenous administration of NMN may lead to the prevention and treatment of diseases associated with increased TG levels, such as fatty liver and diabetes."

      "abstract": "Combating the accumulated senescent cells and the healing of osteoporotic bone fractures in the older remains a significant challenge. Nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN), a precursor of NAD+, is an excellent candidate for mitigating aging-related disorders. However, it is unknown if NMN can alleviate senescent cell induction and enhance osteoporotic bone fracture healing. Here we show that NMN treatment partially reverses the effects of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) on human primary osteoblasts (HOBs): senescent cell induction, diminished osteogenic differentiation ability, and intracellular NAD+ and NADH levels. Mechanistically, NMN restores the mitochondrial dysfunction in HOBs induced by TNF-α evidenced by increased mitochondrial membrane potential and reduced reactive oxidative species and mitochondrial mass. NMN also increases mitophagy activity by down-regulating P62 expression and up-regulating light chain 3B-II protein expression. In addition, the cell senescence protective effects of NMN on HOBs are mitigated by a mitophagy inhibitor (Bafilomycin A1). In vivo, NMN supplementation attenuates senescent cell induction in growth plates, partially prevents osteoporosis in an ovariectomized mouse model, and accelerates bone healing in osteoporotic mice. We conclude that NMN can be a novel and promising therapeutic candidate to enhance bone fracture healing capacity in the older.",

However, the role of NMN and Sirt1 in focal glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) has not yet been elucidated. This study aimed to assess the protective effect of NMN treatment in mice with adriamycin (ADR)-induced FSGS.　Transient short-term NMN treatment was administered to 8-week-old ADR- or saline-treated BALB/c mice (Cont group) for 14 consecutive days. NMN alleviated the increase in urinary albumin excretion in the ADR-treated mice. NMN treatment mitigated glomerulosclerosis and ameliorated the reduced Sirt1 expression and elevated Claudin-1 expression in the kidneys of the mice. Moreover, this treatment improved the decrease in histone methylation and the expression level of Dnmt1 and increased the concentration of NAD+ in the kidney. Dnmt1 epigenetically suppressed the expression of the NMN-consuming enzyme nicotinamide mononucleotide adenyltransferase1 (Nmnat1) by methylating the E-box in the promoter region and repressing the NAD-consuming enzyme PARP1. Additionally, NMN downregulated the expression of Nmnat1 in the ADR-treated mice. Short-term NMN treatment in FSGS has epigenetic renal protective effects through the upregulation of Sirt1 and suppression of the NAD and NMN consumers. The present study presents a novel treatment paradigm for FSGS.",

However, acetylome-wide analysis in the aging process remains poorly studied in mammalian tissues. Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+), a hub metabolite, benefits health span at least in part due to the activation of Sirtuins, a family of NAD+-consuming deacetylases, indicating changes in acetylome. Here, we combine two antibodies for the enrichment of acetylated peptides and perform label-free quantitative acetylomic analysis of mouse livers during natural aging and upon the treatment of beta-nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN), a NAD+ booster. Our study describes previously unknown acetylation sites and reveals the acetylome-wide dynamics with age as well as upon the treatment of NMN. We discover protein acetylation events as potential aging biomarkers. We demonstrate that the life-beneficial effect of NMN could be partially reflected by the changes in age-related protein acetylation. Our quantitative assessment indicates that NMN has mild effects on acetylation sites previously reported as substrates of Sirtuins. Collectively, our data analyze protein acetylation with age, laying critical foundation for the functional study of protein post-translational modification essential for healthy aging and perhaps disease conditions.",

      "abstract": "Spermatogenic dysfunction is one of the major secondary complications of diabetes; however, the underlying mechanisms remain ill-defined, and there is no available drug or strategy for the radical treatment of diabetic spermatogenic dysfunction. Therefore, the objective of this study is to investigate the protective effects of nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) on testicular spermatogenic function in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic mice. The results show that oral administration of NMN significantly increases the body and testis weight and the number of sperms. Moreover, the abnormal sperm count and the rate of sperm malformation are significantly decreased compared with the saline-treated diabetic mice. Histological analysis reveals that NMN treatment significantly increases the area and diameter of seminiferous tubules, accompanied by an increased number of spermatogenic cells and sperms. Immunohistochemistry and qRT-PCR results show that NMN increases Bcl-2 expression and decreases Bax expression in the testis. NMN also increases the protein expression of Vimentin and the mRNA expressions of WT1 and GATA4. In addition, qRT-PCR, western blot analysis and immunohistochemistry results also show that NMN increases the expressions of glycolysis-related rate-limiting enzymes including HK2, PKM2, and LDHA. In summary, this study demonstrates the protective effects of NMN on the testis in an STZ-induced diabetic mice model. NMN exerts its protective effects via reducing spermatogenic cell apoptosis by regulating glycolysis of Sertoli cells in diabetic mice. This study provides an experimental basis for the future clinical application of NMN in diabetes-induced spermatogenic dysfunction.",

      "abstract": "Senescent cells have been demonstrated to have lower cellular NAD+ levels and are involved in the development of various age-related diseases, including age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Sodium iodate (NaIO3) has been primarily used as an oxidant to establish a model of dry AMD. Results of previous studies have showed that NaIO3 induced retinal tissue senescence in vivo. However, the role of NaIO3 and the mechanism by which it induces retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) senescence remains unknown. In this study, RPE cell senescence was confirmed to be potentially induced by NaIO3. The results showed that the number of senescence-associated-β-galactosidase (SA-β-gal-)-positive cells and the protein levels of p16 and p21 increased after NaIO3 treatment. Additionally, the senescent RPE cells underwent oxidative stress and NAD+ depletion. Furthermore, significant DNA damage and mitochondrial dysfunction were also detected in senescent RPE cells. The antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (NAC) could alleviate cellular senescence only by a minimal degree, whereas supplementation with nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) strongly ameliorated RPE senescence through the alleviation of DNA damage and the maintenance of mitochondrial function. The protective effects of NMN were demonstrated to rely on undisturbed Sirt1 signaling. Moreover, both the expression of senescence markers of RPE and subretinal inflammatory cell infiltration were decreased by NMN treatment in vivo. Our results indicate that RPE senescence induced by NaIO3 acquired several key features of AMD. More importantly, NMN may potentially be used to treat RPE senescence and senescence-associated pre-AMD changes by restoring the NAD+ levels in cells and tissues.",

Mast cells in the skin dermis could be activated by PMs that diffuse across the blood vessel after being inhaled. Mast cell degranulation in the dermis provides a kind of inflammatory insult to local fibroblasts. In this study, we evaluated human dermal fibroblast responses to conditioned medium from KU812 cells primed with PM. We found that PM promoted the production of proinflammatory cytokines in mast cells and that the cell secretome induced reactive oxygen species and mitochondrial reactive oxygen species production in dermal fibroblasts. Nicotinamide mononucleotide or coenzyme Q10 alleviated the generation of excessive ROS and mitochondrial ROS induced by the conditioned medium from PM-activated KU812 cells. PM-conditioned medium treatment increased the NF-κB expression in dermal fibroblasts, whereas NMN or Q10 inhibited p65 upregulation by PM. The reduced sirtuin 1 (SIRT 1) and nuclear factor erythroid 2-related Factor 2 (Nrf2) expression induced by PM-conditioned medium was reversed by NMN or Q10 in HDFs. Moreover, NMN or Q10 attenuated the expression of senescent β-galactosidase induced by PM-conditioned KU812 cell medium. These findings suggest that NMN or Q10 ameliorates PM-induced inflammation by improving the cellular oxidative status, suppressing proinflammatory NF-κB, and promoting the levels of the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory regulators Nrf2 and SIRT1 in HDFs. The present observations help to understand the factors that affect HDFs in the dermal microenvironment and the therapeutic role of NMN and Q10 as suppressors of skin aging.",

However, the synergy and transformation process of NMN has not been fully elucidated. In this study, oral administration of NMN (500 mg/kg) combined with resveratrol (50 mg/kg) or ginsenoside Rh2&Rg3 (50 mg/kg) was used to validate the efficacy of appropriate drug combinations in mice. Compared with NMN alone, NMN combined with resveratrol could increase the levels of NAD+ in the heart and muscle by about 1.6 times and 1.7 times, respectively, whereas NMN coupled with ginsenoside Rh2&Rg3 could effectively improve the level of NAD+ in lung tissue for approximately 2.0 times.

The present work aimed to investigate the ameliorative impact of combination therapy with nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) and troxerutin (TXR) on DOX-induced cardiotoxicity, with mitochondrial function/biogenesis and inflammatory response approach. METHODS: Male Wistar rats (n = 30, 250-300 g) were divided into groups with/without DOX and/or NMN and TXR, alone or in combination. Rats underwent 6 consecutive intraperitoneal injections of DOX (cumulative dose: 12 mg/kg). NMN (100 mg/kg/day; intraperitoneally) and/or TXR (150 mg/kg/day; orally) were administered for 28 days before DOX challenge. Seven days following the last injection of DOX, evaluation of cardiac histopathological changes, BNP and LDH levels, mitochondrial function (membrane potential, ROS generation, and ATP levels), expression of proteins involved in mitochondrial biogenesis (PGC-1α, NRF1, and TFAM), and inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6) was performed. RESULTS: Combination of NMN and TXR significantly decreased the severity of histopathological damages, and BNP and LDH levels (P < 0.01 to P < 0.001). It also restored mitochondrial functional endpoints, and expression of proteins involved in mitochondrial biogenesis (P < 0.05 to P < 0.001), and decreased inflammatory cytokines (P < 0.01 to P < 0.001). The positive impacts of this combination therapy were more potent as compared to monotherapies. CONCLUSIONS: These findings shed new light on the understanding of additive properties of NMN/TXR combination therapy in protecting against DOX-induced cardiotoxicity. The cardioprotective effect of this combination therapy may be mediated in part through the restoration of mitochondrial function/biogenesis associated with the PGC-1α/NRF1/TFAM pathway, and suppression of inflammatory response.",

      "abstract": "Peritonitis and subsequent sepsis lead to high morbidity and mortality in response to uncontrolled systemic inflammation primarily mediated by macrophages. Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) is an important regulator of oxidative stress and immunoinflammatory responses. However, the effects of NAD+ replenishment during inflammatory activation are still poorly defined. Hence, we investigated whether the administration of β-nicotinamide mononucleotide (β-NMN), a natural biosynthetic precursor of NAD+, could modulate the macrophage phenotype and thereby ameliorate the dysregulated inflammatory response during sepsis. For this purpose, C57BL6 mice were subjected to the cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) model to provoke sepsis or were injected with thioglycolate to induce sterile peritonitis with recruitment and differentiation of macrophages into the inflamed peritoneal cavity. β-NMN was administered for 4 days after CLP and for 3 days post thioglycolate treatment where peritoneal macrophages were subsequently analyzed. In the CLP model, administration of β-NMN decreased bacterial load in blood and reduced clinical signs of distress and mortality during sepsis. These results were supported by transcriptomic analysis of hearts and lungs 24 h post CLP-induction, which revealed that β-NMN downregulated genes controlling the immuno-inflammatory response and upregulated genes involved in bioenergetic metabolism, mitochondria, and autophagy. In the thioglycolate model, a significant increase in the proportion of CD206 macrophages, marker of anti-inflammatory M2 phenotype, was detected on peritoneal exudate macrophages from β-NMN-administered mice. Transcriptomic signature of these macrophages after bacterial stimulation confirmed that β-NMN administration limited the pro-inflammatory M1 phenotype and induced the expression of specific markers of M2 type macrophages. Furthermore, our data show that β-NMN treatment significantly impacts NAD + metabolism. This shift in the macrophage phenotype and metabolism was accompanied by a reduction in phagolysosome acidification and secretion of inflammatory mediators in macrophages from β-NMN-treated mice suggesting a reduced pro-inflammatory activation. In conclusion, administration of β-NMN prevented clinical deterioration and improved survival during sepsis. These effects relied on shifts in the metabolism of organs that face up an increased energy requirement caused by bacterial infection and in innate immunity response, including reprogramming of macrophages from a highly inflammatory phenotype to an anti-inflammatory/pro-resolving profile."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Obesity has become a common health concern around the world. Maternal obesity could cause poor reproductive outcomes due to chronic ovarian inflammation and decreased oocyte quality. However, the strategies to improve the poor reproductive outcomes of obese females have not been fully studied. In this study, we aimed to explore the effects and underlying mechanisms of nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) on oocyte quality and reproductive performance of obese mice. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The obese mouse model was established by feeding high-fat diet which was confirmed by body weight record, fasting blood glucose test and oral glucose tolerance test. The expression of ovary development related genes and inflammation related genes, including Lhx8, Bmp4, Adgre1, Ccl2, TNF-α, Gal-3, Clec10a and IL-10 in ovaries and the expression of Bax and Sod1 in oocytes were detected using quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR). The adipose size of abdominal fat tissue was determined with haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining. Immunofluorescence staining was performed to measure the ROS level, spindle/chromosome structure, mitochondrial function, actin dynamics and DNA damage of oocytes. RESULTS: The administration of NMN restored ovarian weight and reduced the adipose size of abdominal fat tissue and ovarian inflammation in high fat diet (HFD) mice. Furthermore, NMN treatment improved the oocytes quality partially by restoring the mitochondrial function and actin dynamics, reducing meiotic defects, DNA damage and ROS level and lipid droplet distribution of oocytes in HFD mice. On the long-term effect, NMN restored offspring body weight of HFD mice. CONCLUSION: NMN could improve the oocyte quality of HFD-induced obese mice.",

      "abstract": "Vascular cognitive impairment (VCI) is the second leading form of dementia after Alzheimer's disease (AD) plaguing the elder population. Despite the enormous prevalence of VCI, the biological basis of this disease has been much less well-studied than that of AD, with no specific therapy currently existing to prevent or treat VCI. As VCI mainly occurs in the elderly, the role of anti-aging drugs including metformin, rapamycin, and nicotinamide mono nucleotide (NMN), and the underlying mechanism remain uncertain. Here, we examined the role of metformin, rapamycin, and NMN in cognitive function, white matter integrity, microglial response, and phagocytosis in a rat model of VCI by bilateral common carotid artery occlusion (BCCAO). BCCAO-induced chronic cerebral hypoperfusion could cause spatial working memory deficits and white matter lesions (WMLs), along with increasing microglial activation and phagocytosis compared to sham-operated rats. We found the cognitive impairment was significantly improved in BCCAO rats pretreated with these three drugs for 14 days before BCCAO compared with the vehicle group by the analysis of the Morris water maze and new object recognition tests. Pretreatment of metformin, rapamycin, or NMN also increased myelin basic protein (MBP, a marker for myelin) expression and reduced SMI32 (a marker for demyelinated axons) intensity and SMI32/MBP ratio compared with the vehicle group, suggesting that these drugs could ameliorate BCCAO-induced WMLs. The findings were confirmed by Luxol fast blue (LFB) stain, which is designed for staining myelin/myelinated axons. We further found that pretreatment of metformin, rapamycin, or NMN reduced microglial activation and the number of M1 microglia, but increased the number of M2 microglia compared to the vehicle group. Importantly, the number of MBP+/Iba1+/CD68+ microglia was significantly reduced in the BCCAO rats pretreated with these three drugs compared with the vehicle group, suggesting that these drugs suppress microglial phagocytosis. No significant difference was found between the groups pretreated with metformin, rapamycin, or NMN. Our data suggest that metformin, rapamycin, or NMN could protect or attenuate cognitive impairment and WMLs by modifying microglial polarization and inhibiting phagocytosis. The findings may open a new avenue for VCI treatment."

      "abstract": "The nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) level shows a temporal decrease during the aging process, which has been deemed as an aging hallmark. Nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN), a key NAD+ precursor, shows the potential to retard the age-associated functional decline in organs. In the current study, to explore whether NMN has an impact on the intestine during the aging process, the effects of NMN supplementation on the intestinal morphology, microbiota, and NAD+ content, as well as its anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidative and barrier functions were investigated in aging mice and D-galactose (D-gal) induced senescent IPEC-J2 cells. The results showed that 4 months of NMN administration had little impact on the colonic microbiota and NAD+ content in aging mice, while it significantly increased the jejunal NAD+ content and improved the jejunal structure including increasing the villus length and shortening the crypt. Moreover, NMN supplementation significantly up-regulated the mRNA expression of SIRT3, SIRT6, nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), the catalytic subunit of glutamate-cysteine ligase (GCLC), superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2), occludin, and claudin-1, but down-regulated the mRNA expression of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α). Specifically, in the D-gal induced senescent IPEC-J2 cells, 500 μM NMN restored the increased mRNA expression of interleukin 6 (IL6ST), IL-1A, nuclear factor (NF-κB1), and claudin-1 to normal levels to some extent. Furthermore, NMN treatment significantly affected the mRNA expression of antioxidant enzymes including NQO1, GCLC, SOD 2 and 3, and GSH-PX1, 3 and 4. In addition, 200 μM NMN enhanced the cell viability and total antioxidant capacity and lowered the reactive oxygen species level of senescent IPEC-J2 cells. Notably, NMN restored the down-regulated protein expression of occludin and claudin-1 induced by D-gal. The above data demonstrated the potential of NMN in ameliorating the structural and functional decline in the intestine during aging.",

      "abstract": "The molecular mechanisms of blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption in the early stage after ischemic stroke are poorly understood. In the present study, we investigated the potential role of nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyltransferase 1 (NMNAT1) in ischemia-induced BBB damage using an animal middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model of ischemic stroke. Recombinant human NMNAT1 (rh-NMNAT1) was administered intranasally and Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) siRNA was administered by intracerebroventricular injection. Our results indicate that rh-NMNAT1 reduced infarct volume, improved functional outcome, and decreased BBB permeability in mice after ischemic stroke. Furthermore, rh-NMNAT1 prevented the loss of tight junction proteins (occludin and claudin-5) and reduced cell apoptosis in ischemic microvessels. NMNAT1-mediated BBB permeability was correlated with the elevation of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+)/NADH ratio and SIRT1 level in brain microvascular endothelial cells. In addition, rh-NMNAT1 treatment significantly decreased the levels of acetylated nuclear factor-κB, acetylated p53, and matrix metalloproteinase-9 in ischemic microvessels. Moreover, the protective effects of rh-NMNAT1 could be reversed by SIRT1 siRNA. In conclusion, these findings indicate that rh-NMNAT1 protects BBB integrity after cerebral ischemia via the NAD+/SIRT1 signaling pathway in brain microvascular endothelial cells. NMNAT1 may be a novel potential therapeutic target for reducing BBB disruption after ischemic stroke.",

However, age-induced changes of the acetylomic landscape and effects of NMN treatment on protein acetylation have not been reported. Here, we performed immunoprecipitation coupled with label-free quantitative LC-MS/MS (IPMS) to identify the acetylome and investigate the effects of aging and NMN on liver protein acetylation. In total, 7773 acetylated peptides assigned to 1997 proteins were commonly identified from young and aged livers treated with vehicle or NMN. The major biological processes associated with proteins exhibiting increased acetylation from aged livers were oxidation-reduction and metabolic processes. Proteins with decreased acetylation from aged livers mostly participated in transport and translation processes. Furthermore, NMN treatment inhibited the aging-related increase of acetylation on proteins regulating fatty acid β oxidation, the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and valine degradation. In particular, NAD (P) transhydrogenase (NNT) was markedly hyperacetylated at K70 in aged livers, and NMN treatment decreased acetylation intensity without altering protein levels. Acetylation at cytochrome 3a25 (Cyp3a25) at K141 was also greatly increased in aged livers, and NMN treatment totally arrested this increase. Our extensive identification and analysis provide novel insight and potential targets to combat aging and aging-related functional decline.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) is a representative anti-aging drug that, after long-term administration in mice, causes an increase in energy and lipid metabolism, improves eye function, immune response, and increases insulin sensitivity. However, the effects of NMN on skin pigmentation are still unknown. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we aimed to demonstrate the effects of NMN on melanogenesis. METHODS: NMN was applied to both young and aged melanocytes, and melanin production, protein expression, and mRNA levels were analyzed. A reconstituted human skin model was used to validate the effect of NMN on melanogenesis in vivo. RESULTS: NMN treatment showed no apparent effects on young melanocytes, however, in aged melanocytes, a marked reduction in melanin production was observed. NMN treatment also efficiently reduced melanin production in a reconstituted human skin with aged melanocytes. Genome-wide analysis showed the downregulation of melanogenesis-related cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)/Wnt signaling in aged melanocytes. Moreover, NMN treatment downregulated forskolin-induced expression of melanogenesis-related proteins, tyrosinase (TYR), tyrosinase-related protein (TRP)- 1, and TRP-2. Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+), an NMN product within the cells, also reduced cAMP/Wnt signaling in aged melanocytes. SLC12A6 was the most highly expressed gene among the SLC12A family members in melanocytes and was significantly influenced by NMN or NAD+ treatment, indicating that SLC12A6 protein is an NMN transporter in melanocytes. CONCLUSION: NMN reduces melanogenesis in aged melanocytes by downregulating the signaling of melanogenesis-associated receptors. Therefore, NMN is a human-friendly anti-melanogenic agent with the potential to aid in aging-related hyperpigmentation therapy.",

The pathology of AD involves in immune dysfunction and epidermal barrier disruption. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are found to be associated with AD, and play a role in the immunological abnormalities and dysfunctional skin barrier. Nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) plays an important role in oxidative stress related diseases, but its role in AD is unclear. METHODS: KM mice were treated with DNFB to induce AD-like lesion and typical applied with NMN for two weeks. The dermatitis score, the degree of itching and TEWL were evaluated during modeling. Epidermal thickness of skin lesions and histopathological changes were detected. Further, inflammatory factors, epidermal differentiation-related genes, oxidative stress indicators and JAK2/STAT5 signaling pathway were evaluated. NHEK cells were stimulated by TNF-α/IFN-γ after pre-treatment with NMN, then ROS levels, inflammatory factors and JAK2/STAT5 signaling pathway were detected. RESULTS: NMN exhibited potent anti-atopic activities, shown by alleviated AD-like symptoms, inhibited the increased expression of inflammatory cytokines and restored proteins and mRNA level of skin barrier genes. In addition, NMN inhibited TNF-α/IFN-γ-stimulated elevation of inflammatory chemokines, which was associated with blocking the activation of ROS-mediated JAK2/STAT5 pathway.

      "abstract": "Heat stress is directly correlated to mammary gland dysfunction in dairy cows, especially in summer. Abnormally high environmental temperature induces oxidative stress and apoptosis in bovine mammary epithelial cells (BMECs). Nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) has beneficial effects in maintaining the cellular physiological functions. In this study, we evaluate the protective effect of NMN on heat stress-induced apoptosis of BMECs and explore the potential underlying mechanisms. Our results showed that heat stress considerably decreased cell viability in BMECs, whereas pretreatment of BMECs with NMN (150 μM) for 24 h significantly alleviated the negative effects of heat stress on cells. NMN protected BMECs from heat stress-induced oxidative stress by inhibiting the excessive accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and increasing the activity of antioxidant enzymes. It also inhibited apoptosis by reducing the ratio of Bax/Bcl2 and blocking proteolytic the cleavage of Caspase-3 in heat stressed-BMECs. Importantly, NMN treatment could reduce mitochondrial damage through mediating the expression of mitochondrial fission and fusion-related genes, including Dynamin related protein 1 (Drp1), Mitochondrial fission 1 protein (Fis1), and Mitofusin1, 2 (MFN1, 2); and suppress endoplasmic reticulum stress through unfolded protein response regulator Glucose regulated protein 78 (GRP78), and downstream elements Recombinant activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) and C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP). Above all, our results demonstrate that NMN supplemention attenuates heat stress-induced oxidative stress and apoptosis in BMECs by maintaining mitochondrial fission and fusion, and regulating endoplasmic reticulum stress, which provides the convincing evidence that NMN has valuable potential in alleviating mammary gland injury of dairy cows caused by environmental heat stress.",

This study investigated the effects of the time-dependent intake of nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) on sleep quality, fatigue, and physical performance in older adults. This randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled study evaluated 108 participants divided into four groups (NMN_AM; antemeridian, NMN_PM; post meridian, Placebo_AM, Placebo_PM). NMN (250 mg) or placebo was administered once a day for 12 weeks. Sleep quality was evaluated using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. Fatigue was evaluated using the \"Jikaku-sho shirabe\" questionnaire. Grip strength, 5-times sit-to-stand (5-STS), timed up and go, and 5-m habitual walk were evaluated to assess the physical performance. Significant interactions were observed between 5-STS and drowsiness. 5-STS of all groups on post-intervention and drowsiness of the NMN_PM and Placebo_PM groups on mid- and post-intervention showed significant improvement compared with those in pre-intervention. The NMN_PM group demonstrated the largest effect size for 5-STS (d = 0.72) and drowsiness (d = 0.64). Overall, NMN intake in the afternoon effectively improved lower limb function and reduced drowsiness in older adults. These findings suggest the potential of NMN in preventing loss of physical performance and improving fatigue in older adults.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) precursors, nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN), or nicotinamide riboside (NR) extend healthspan and ameliorate some age-related conditions in model organisms. However, early-phase trials of NAD precursors have yielded varying results and their pharmacokinetics remain incompletely understood. Here, we report the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of MIB-626, a microcrystalline unique polymorph βNMN formulation. METHODS: In this double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 32 overweight or obese adults, 55-80 years, were block-randomized, stratified by sex, to 1 000-mg MIB-626 once daily, twice daily, or placebo for 14 days. NMN, NAD, and NAD metabolome were measured using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. RESULTS: Participant characteristics were similar across groups. MIB-626 was well tolerated and frequency of adverse events was similar across groups. Blood NMN concentrations on Day 14 in MIB-626-treated groups were significantly higher compared to placebo (1.7-times and 3.7-times increase above baseline in 1 000 mg once-daily and twice-daily groups in mean AUClast, respectively). MIB-626 treatment was associated with substantial dose-related increases in blood NAD levels. Blood levels of NAD metabolites were higher in NMN-treated participants on Days 8 and 14 than at baseline. Changes in NMN or NAD levels were not related to sex, body mass index, or age. Very little unmodified NMN was excreted in the urine. CONCLUSION: MIB-626 1 000 mg once-daily or twice-daily regimens were safe and associated with substantial dose-related increases in blood NAD levels and its metabolome. These foundational data that were obtained using a pharmaceutical-grade βNMN, standardized sample collection, and validated liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry assays, should facilitate design of efficacy trials in disease conditions.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The high levels of oxidative stress and apoptosis of pancreatic islet cells after severe burns lead to the dysfunction of islets and glucose metabolism disorders. Silent information regulator of transcription 1 (SIRT1) can decrease oxidative stress and apoptosis of islets in diabetes mellitus. This study aimed to investigate the role of SIRT1 on pancreatic islets and whether nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) can impact the function of pancreatic islets after severe burns. METHODS: A 30% total body surface area full-thickness burn model was established using male C57BL/6 mice, and mice were randomized into sham group, burn group, burn + NMN group and burn + NMN + EX-527 group. The concentration of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD), the expression of SIRT1, apoptosis induction, mitochondrial function and related signalling pathways of pancreatic islets at 24 h after severe burns were tested. RESULTS: Severe burns led to decreased NAD level and SIRT1 expression of pancreatic islets, increased apoptosis rate, and mitochondrial dysfunction of pancreatic islets. NAD repletion by NMN and upregulation of SIRT1 expression reduced the phosphorylation and acetylation levels of NF-κB p65 and burn-induced apoptosis. Meanwhile, the mitochondrial function of islets was rescued by NMN treatment through the SIRT1/UCP2 axis and SIRT1/PGC1-α axis. In addition, the fasting blood glucose decreased and glucose-stimulated insulin secretion was improved with NMN treatment after severe burns. This protective effect of NMN could be abolished by EX-527, the inhibitor of SIRT1. CONCLUSION: NMN can increase the concentration of NAD+ of pancreatic islets and regulate SIRT1 and its downstream targets, thereby reducing apoptosis, maintaining mitochondrial function and improving pancreatic islet function after severe burn injury.",

METHODS: We conducted an in-vitro study to examine the effects of NMN treatment on HG-treated HCECs. Cell viability was measured using trypan blue stain, mitochondrial membrane potential was measured using JC-1 stain, and intracellular reactive oxygen species and apoptosis assays were conducted using flow cytometry. Transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) and zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) immunofluorescence for tight junction examinations were conducted. Immunoblot analyses were conducted to analyze the expression of silent information regulator-1 (SIRT1), nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) of the SIRT1/Nrf2/HO-1 pathway. RESULTS: NMN increased cell viability by reducing cell damage, reducing apoptosis, increasing cell migration, and restoring tight junctions in HG-treated HCECs. By analyzing the expressions of SIRT1, Nrf2, HO-1, NMN demonstrated protective effects via the SIRT1/Nrf2/HO-1 pathway. CONCLUSIONS: NMN increases cell viability by reversing cell damage, reducing apoptosis, increasing cell migration, and restoring tight junctions in HG-treated HCECs, and these effects may be mediated by the SIRT1/Nrf2/HO-1 pathway.",

      "abstract": "As a redox-sensitive coenzyme, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) plays a central role in cellular energy metabolism and homeostasis. Low NAD+ levels are linked to multiple disease states, including age-related diseases, such as metabolic and neurodegenerative diseases. Consequently, restoring/increasing NAD+ levels in vivo has emerged as an important intervention targeting age-related neurodegenerative diseases. One of the widely studied approaches to increase NAD+ levels in vivo is accomplished by using NAD+ precursors, such as nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN). Oral administration of NMN has been shown to successfully increase NAD+ levels in a variety of tissues; however, it remains unclear whether NMN can cross the blood-brain barrier to increase brain NAD+ levels. This study evaluated the effects of oral NMN administration on NAD+ levels in C57/B6J mice brain tissues. Our results demonstrate that oral gavage of 400 mg/kg NMN successfully increases brain NAD+ levels in mice after 45 min. These findings provide evidence that NMN may be used as an intervention to increase NAD+ levels in the brain.",

      "abstract": "Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) replication is tightly regulated and necessary for cellular homeostasis; however, its relationship with mitochondrial metabolism remains unclear. Advances in metabolomics integrated with the rapid isolation of mitochondria will allow for remarkable progress in analyzing mitochondrial metabolism. Here, we propose a novel methodology for mitochondria-targeted metabolomics, which employs a quick isolation procedure using a hemolytic toxin from Streptococcus pyogenes streptolysin O (SLO). SLO isolation of mitochondria from cultured HEK293 cells is time- and labor-saving for simultaneous multi-sample processing and has been applied to various other cell lines in this study. Furthermore, our method can detect the time-dependent reduction in mitochondrial ATP in response to a glycolytic inhibitor 2-deoxyglucose, indicating the suitability to prepare metabolite analysis-competent mitochondria. Using this methodology, we searched for specific mitochondrial metabolites associated with mtDNA replication activation, and nucleotides and NAD+ were identified to be prominently altered. Most notably, treatment of β-nicotinamide mononucleotide (β-NMN), a precursor of NAD+, to HEK293 cells activated and improved the rate of mtDNA replication by increasing nucleotides in mitochondria and decreasing their degradation products: nucleosides. Our results suggest that β-NMN metabolism plays a role in supporting mtDNA replication by maintaining the nucleotide pool balance in the mitochondria.",

Sixty aged Wistar rats were randomly divided into five groups (n = 12), including sham, control, NMN, IPostC, and NMN + IPostC. Regional ischaemia was induced by 30-min occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) followed by 60-min reperfusion. IPostC was applied at the onset of reperfusion, by six cycles of 10-s reperfusion/ischaemia. NMN (100 mg/kg) was intraperitoneally injected every other day for 28 days before IR. Myocardial haemodynamics and infarct size (IS) were measured, and the left ventricles samples were harvested to assess cardiac mitochondrial function. The results showed that all treatments reduced lactate dehydrogenase release compared to those of the control group. IPostC alone failed to reduce IS and myocardial function. However, NMN and combined therapy could significantly improve myocardial function and decrease the IS compared to the control animals. Moreover, the effects of combined therapy on the decrease of IS, mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS), and improvement of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) were greater than those of stand-alone treatments. These results demonstrated that cardioprotection by combined therapy with NMN + IPostC was superior to individual treatments, and pretreatment of aged rats with NMN was able to correct the failure of IPostC in protecting the hearts of aged rats against IR injury.",

Nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN), as a precursor of NAD+, effectively regulate mitochondria metabolism in mice. However, roles of NMN in improving age-related diminished ovary reserve remain to be determined. In present study, 4, 8, 12, 24, 40-week old female ICR mice were collected and a 20-week-long administration of NMN was conducted to 40-week-old mice (60WN), meanwhile the control group is given water (60WC). First, we found that 20-week-long administration of NMN to 40-week-old mice exhibited anti-aging and anti-inflammatory effects on organ structures, along with the improvement of estrus cycle condition and endocrine function. The number of primordial, primary, secondary, antral follicles and corpora luteum of ovaries in 60WN group was significantly increased compared with those in 60WC group. Additionally, the protein and gene expressions of P16 of ovaries were significantly reduced in 60WN group than in 60WC group. the mitochondria biogenesis, autophagy level, and proteases activity enhanced in granulosa cells after 20-week-administration of NMN. Present results indicate that NMN has the potential to save diminished ovary reserve by long-term treatment, providing a basis for exploring the role of NMN in anti-ovarian aging by enhancing the mitophagy level of granulosa cells.",
