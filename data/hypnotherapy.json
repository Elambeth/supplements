      "abstract": "CONTEXT: Many people are frightened by the word \"cancer\" alone, and they often suffer from psychological disturbances such as tension, depression, and other cognitive issues. Precipitating variables include uncertainty and anxiety about the future, shifts in social roles, and physical problems or their management. AIM: The purpose of the study was to investigate the effectiveness of hypnotherapy in managing psychological disturbances like tension, depression, anger, and fatigue issues in persons with cancer. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: Nonrandomized controlled trials were conducted applying before and after control group research design. Matching based on mean and standard deviations was done. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Using a convenience sample approach, 57 cancer patients in all were chosen from a semigovernment cancer hospital. Of these 57 participants, 30 were placed in the first group and received medical care as well as hypnosis as an intervention. The second group, which included an additional 27 individuals, received only medical care. The Profile of Mood States (POMS), created by McNair, Lorr, and Droppleman in 1971, was presented to the participants. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS USED: The study employed the independent samples t-test and eta-squared statistics to examine the average difference in mood states between the experimental and control groups and to determine the extent of the intervention's impact. RESULTS: The findings indicate that directional hypotheses on dependent measures are accepted at df = 55, P < 0.005 (one-tailed). CONCLUSION: It proves that the intervention of hypnotherapy significantly affects the mental health of cancer patients. To be more specific, it increases the level of vigor and at the same time, it also decreases tension, depression, anger, fatigue, and confusion in patients.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Gut-directed hypnotherapy has been shown to be an effective treatment for irritable bowel syndrome, but prior studies have been small with variable delivery modalities. This systematic review and meta-analysis investigates the efficacy of gut-directed hypnotherapy for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) symptoms and the impact of delivery characteristics. METHODS: PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science were searched. Titles and abstracts, then full text articles, were screened for inclusion criteria. Studies were extracted and assessed for bias using the Cochrane Collaboration risk-of-bias tool. A meta-analysis was performed to assess the impact of gut-directed hypnotherapy on global IBS symptoms and pain. A sub-group analysis was conducted to assess the impact of gut-directed hypnotherapy delivery characteristics on IBS-related outcomes. RESULTS: Twelve studies in 11 papers met inclusion criteria, involving 1158 patients with IBS. Eight studies provided continuous measures sufficient for meta-analysis. On systematic review, all 12 studies found gut-directed hypnotherapy to be superior to the comparator; nine were statistically significant. On meta-analysis, gut-directed hypnotherapy improved global IBS symptoms (SMD 0.73 [-0.09-1.55], I2 93%). Gut-directed hypnotherapy with high-volume delivery and gut-directed hypnotherapy delivered in groups showed statistically significant improvement in global IBS symptoms (SMD 0.56 [0.29-0.83], I2 0%; SMD 0.41 [0.05-0.77], I2 61%). Gut-directed hypnotherapy also significantly improved pain more than its comparator groups (SMD 0.25 [0.01-0.49], I2 17%). CONCLUSION: Gut-directed hypnotherapy may improve global symptoms of IBS. In particular, GDH improved pain symptoms compared to other standard IBS interventions. GDH delivered in groups was effective at reducing global IBS symptoms compared to standard interventions."

Transitioning through critical developmental phases, 39 students who had experienced significant loss and demonstrated symptoms of prolonged grief participated in this randomized controlled trial. They were divided equally into three groups: those receiving EH, those undergoing CBT, and a control group placed on a waiting list. Assessments utilized the Prolonged Grief Scale and the Beck Depression Inventory to measure the interventions' impact on grief. Findings revealed significant improvements in both EH and CBT groups compared to the control, with EH showing marginally higher effectiveness in reducing grief symptoms. This research underlines EH's potential as a culturally adaptable and effective treatment for prolonged grief in a diverse academic setting, advocating for its broader application and further exploration across various populations."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: In France, benzodiazepines are widely prescribed and consumed for anxiety and sleep disorders. E2R (Emotion, Regression, Repair) hypnotherapy could be an alternative non-pharmacological method to reduce their long-term use. The aim of this study was to estimate indirectly the effect of E2R hypnosis on the withdrawal rate at month 12 post-hypnotherapy in patients on long-term treatment (>3 months) with benzodiazepines or related drugs. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Retrospective observational study using data on 73 patients treated with E2R hypnotherapy for anxiety, depression or sleep disorders extracted from the patient databases of some French general practitioners trained in E2R hypnosis. Prescription of benzodiazepines or related drugs was analyzed at inclusion and at month 12 after E2R hypnotherapy. RESULTS: At month 12, 79.5 % had reduced or stopped their consumption (mean reduction of 55 %): 57.5 % of patients had completely stopped taking benzodiazepines or related drugs (95 % CI: 45.4 %-69.0 %) and 21.9 % were using them occasionally, based on the general practitioners' prescriptions. The percentage of patients with antidepressant prescriptions also decreased from 49.3 % to 31.5 % and 44.4 % of initial users stopped taking antidepressants. No factor associated with drug withdrawal was identified. CONCLUSION: This observational study suggests that E2R hypnotherapy might be a promising and rapid approach for reducing or discontinuing benzodiazepines or related drugs, with results similar to those obtained with other non-pharmacological interventions. Controlled trials are needed to confirm its efficacy.",

Hypnotherapy has shown potential in effectively improving sleep disorders with fewer side effects. The purpose of this study was to explore the effectiveness of hypnotherapy on the quality of life of patients with sleep disorders. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A single-group pre- and post-test design with purposive sampling was used to invite 120 patients from the sleep center of a teaching hospital in central Taiwan to participate in the study. Participants were interviewed before and after hypnotherapy using a quality of life questionnaire and an open-ended question. RESULTS: The quality of life of the 72 participants significantly improved after listening to hypnosis with music (p < .05). Content analysis of the open-ended responses revealed that the hypnosis with music helped participants generate positive emotions, sleep better, and maintain good spirits. CONCLUSION: Listening to hypnosis with music can improve the quality of life for patients with sleep disorders. Patients can listen to the hypnosis with music at home or in a quiet place to fall asleep more easily. This study provides an innovative and effective intervention to alleviate sleep disorders and enhance the quality of life for patients.",

      "abstract": "This paper explores the use of hypnosis in tracing the etiology of Conversion Disorder (CD) in adolescents through hypnoanalysis, as well as outlining a structured workflow for hypnotherapy. A 16-year-old female high school student, who experienced sensations of earthquakes at any time and was unable to lie down to sleep, underwent multiple physical examinations across various hospitals without any identified cause. Conventional treatments with both Chinese and Western medicine were ineffective over a six-month period. Using hypnoanalysis techniques, the source of her condition was identified and treated through hypnosis, enabling the patient to develop a new state of self-suggestion and return to normal life. After six sessions of hypnotherapy, the hypnoanalysis process was completed, revealing the initial source of the patient's symptoms. The abnormal sensation of earthquakes disappeared, and her daily life and social functioning returned to normal. Follow-up over nearly 18months showed no recurrence. Hypnoanalysis plays a significant role in uncovering subconscious repression, trauma, and memory suppression leading to Conversion Disorder. Hypnotherapy may hold potential clinical value in the treatment of conversion disorders in adolescents."

      "abstract": "This randomized controlled trial examined the effectiveness of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and Ericksonian Hypnotherapy (EH) in reducing symptoms of depression and anxiety among individuals with subclinical levels of distress. A total of 150 participants were screened, and 45 eligible participants were randomized into three groups: CBT (n = 15), EH (n = 15), and a waitlist control group (n = 15). Interventions consisted of 12 weekly sessions, with assessments conducted at baseline, mid-intervention, and post-intervention using the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) and Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI). Both CBT and EH significantly reduced symptoms of depression and anxiety compared to the control group, with no significant differences in efficacy between the two interventions. CBT's structured approach demonstrated consistent improvements across both depression and anxiety, while EH showed a slightly faster reduction in anxiety symptoms at mid-intervention, highlighting its potential for addressing somatic and cognitive dimensions of anxiety. This study extends previous findings by focusing on a non-clinical population, emphasizing the potential of these interventions as early strategies for preventing symptom escalation. Unlike prior work primarily targeting diagnosed populations, this research underscores the applicability of CBT and EH in addressing subthreshold distress. Limitations include a small sample size, lack of follow-up assessments, and reliance on self-reported measures. Future research should explore long-term outcomes, larger samples, and the integration of CBT and EH. These findings contribute to the growing body of evidence supporting diverse psychotherapeutic modalities for early mental health intervention."

Although evidence is building on efficacy of mind-body approaches, we generally lack a thorough understanding of how they work. Despite being presented as separate treatment modalities, mind-body approaches often use overlapping treatment aspects with the same mechanism of action. There is evidence that yoga, meditation, and hypnotherapy may partly draw their benefit from creating an absorbed state of attention combined with suggestions for change. This has implications for clinical application of these treatments in patients with GI disease. We propose studies on mechanisms of mind-body approaches to develop more efficacious and more precise treatments for GI diseases.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Management of children with functional abdominal pain (FAP) or irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is difficult in primary care. When education and reassurance do not alleviate symptoms, primary care physicians lack treatment options for children with FAP or IBS. Home-based guided hypnotherapy is a promising treatment because of its accessibility. To address feasibility, it is of utmost importance to take experiences from children and their parents into account. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to explore children's and their parents' experiences with home-based guided hypnotherapy for children with FAP or IBS. METHODS: This qualitative study used open-ended questions from a questionnaire and in-depth semistructured interviews with children and their parents who had a hypnotherapy intervention prescribed. The interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. Data were collected and analyzed iteratively using thematic content analysis. RESULTS: A total of 76 children were eligible, and we collected questionnaire data from 56 children. A total of 23 interviews were conducted with 10 children and 15 parents. Six themes emerged from questionnaire data and interviews: impression of the exercises, not for everyone, influence of perceived effect, integrating exercises in daily life, content and practicalities of the website, and customization to personal preferences. Children with FAP or IBS experienced home-based guided hypnotherapy and the exercises differently, ranging from boring to fun. From interviews with the parents, it emerged that hypnotherapy is not suitable for everyone; for example, when children are very young or have a low developmental level, cannot sit still, cannot surrender to the exercises, or are too energetic or stressed, it might be difficult to comply. Experiences were shaped by the influence of a perceived effect and to which extent children were able to integrate exercises in daily life. The content and practicalities of the website also influenced experiences, and hypnotherapy that is adaptable to personal preferences, including by appearance and content, would be highly appreciated. CONCLUSIONS: The children and parents experienced home-based guided hypnotherapy differently, ranging from boring to fun. Hypnotherapy might be difficult or boring for some children. The children enjoyed hypnotherapy when they liked the topic or story, felt positive effects, could easily integrate exercises in daily life, or enjoyed the website in general. The children's experiences and adherence can be further improved by adding short exercises and customizing hypnotherapy to their personal preferences on the website's appearance and content. This could increase effectiveness but must be studied further."

A total of 745 nonduplicate publications were screened, and 63 papers were included for analysis. Based on 33 of these studies, 66.7% reported a positive impact of the hypnosis intervention for smoking cessation. Positive impact studies had longer average treatment duration, greater number of hypnotherapy sessions, and utilized both self-report and objective measures of smoking cessation outcome (40.9% of positive studies using both vs 20% of no impact studies). The efficacy of hypnotherapy for smoking cessation is positive; however, more studies using biologically confirmed abstinence and reduction in the number of cigarettes smoked are needed. Hypnotherapy is a useful approach for smoking cessation that warrants additional inquiry. Future studies are needed that assess treatment fidelity and hypnotizability, provide information on race/ethnicity, and report on side effects and adverse events.",

METHODS: This study included 69 participants with SAD who were assigned to three groups based on their scores on the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS). The experimental group (n = 23) received a hypnosis treatment once a week, for a total of six sessions, while the control group (n = 23) and the baseline group (n = 23) did not receive any treatment. To evaluate whether hypnosis could alleviate SAD and attention bias towards threatening stimuli, we employed questionnaires and an odd-one-out task accompanied by electroencephalography (EEG) recordings. RESULTS: Under the attention sensitivity conditions, the experimental group exhibited a reduced N170 and LPP at the posttest stage, and a similar N170 and LPP reduction under the attention disengagement conditions. Notably, the symptom improvements were positively correlated with the reduction in N170 and LPP amplitude across conditions. CONCLUSION: Hypnosis treatment modulates the early face processing and late emotional evaluation of threat-related stimuli in SAD patients. These findings suggest that N170 and LPP are important biomarkers for the treatment of SAD."

DGBI are highly prevalent in autistic children and are associated with worsening behaviour and anxiety. Treatments such as probiotics, prebiotics and gut-directed hypnotherapy (GDH) have shown efficacy in improving gut symptoms in children. The primary objective of the study was to compare changes in gastrointestinal (GI) scores following a 12-week intervention of synbiotics (prebiotic + probiotic) +/- GDH with a follow-up at 24 weeks. Secondary objectives included changes in behavioural and anxiety symptoms, while changes in gut microbiome composition were assessed as an exploratory objective. Children diagnosed with ASD aged 5.00-10.99 years (n = 40) were recruited and randomised (1:1) to a 12-week intervention of either synbiotics (SYN group) or synbiotics + GDH (COM group). Both the SYN and COM group experienced significant reductions in total GI scores post-intervention and at follow-up (p < 0.001), with no superiority of the COM treatment over the SYN treatment. The COM group showed beneficial reductions in anxiety scores (p = 0.002) and irritability behaviours (p < 0.001) which were not present in the SYN group. At follow-up, only those in the COM group maintained significant reductions in GI pain scores (p < 0.001). There were significant changes in gut microbiota such as increases in Bifidobacterium animalis and Dialister in both groups over time. In conclusion, synbiotics with or without GDH may help support standard care for autistic children who suffer comorbid DGBI. The trial was prospectively registered at clinicialtrials.gov on 16 November 2020 (NCTO4639141)."

In the past half-century, many studies have explored various psychotherapeutic approaches, including psychoanalytic, cognitive-behavioral and systemic psychotherapy, but hypnotherapy has not been addressed. This article presents the first analysis using current methods of verifying and understanding the dynamics of change in hypnotherapy, regarding to the therapeutic alliance. Luborsky et al.'s (1996) revised Helping Alliance Questionnaire (HAq-II) was administered to 59 patients in treatment with psychologists and psychiatrists using Ericksonian hypnosis. Our results suggest that the dynamics of the alliance in the first sessions of hypnotherapy involve factors related more to the therapist's adjustment to the patient than to the progress the patient makes in these initial sessions.",

      "abstract": "Hypnosis has been applied in healing procedures since the earliest of recorded history and today it is implemented in a wholesome concept Hypnotherapy (HT1). On a neurophysiological level, hypnosis has been associated with parts of the Default Mode Network (DMN2), but its effects on this network when induced in a treatment setting of a widespread disorder, namely depression, have never been investigated. Depression is associated with abnormal functional connectivity (FC3) of the DMN. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT4) has proven itself to be an effective treatment for depression; effects of CBT on DMN-related regions are heterogeneous. In the past years, HT was found to be a promising alternative or helpful adjunction. Yet, its underlying mechanisms remain to be unclear. In this original study 75 depressed patients receiving either CBT or HT were included and measured during resting-state before and after therapy with functional near-infrared-spectroscopy (fNIRS5). On symptom level, results show a significant reduction in both groups. On a neurophysiological level, first exploratory analyses hint toward treatment effects in two components of the DMN. However, these effects do not withstand correction for multiple testing. Still, our study is a first stepstone in the investigation of neural mechanisms of HT and offers first ideas about possible implications."

      "abstract": "Stigma is one of the chief reasons for treatment-avoidant behaviour among people with mental health conditions. Stigmatising attitudes are spread through multiple determinants, including but not limited to: (i) individual beliefs; (ii) interpersonal influences; (iii) local cultural values and (iv) shared culture such as depictions in television shows. Our research indicates that popular television shows are currently understudied vectors for narratives that alternately reify or debunk assumptions and stereotypes about people with mental health conditions. Although such shows are fictional, they influence perception by normalising 'common sense' assumptions over extended periods of time. Consequently, representations of patients, psychiatrists and treatments influence knowledge and understanding of mental health and treatment-seeking behaviour. While storytelling about sickness can inspire possibilities and bestow meaning on traumatic experiences, fictional narratives written without sufficient care can have the inverse effect of curtailing horizons and limiting expectations. Problematic portrayals of patients, mental health professionals and psychological interventions are often reductive and may increase stigma and prevent treatment-seeking behaviour. This article analyses the representation of hypnotherapy and electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) in Singaporean television dramas that attract a wide, mainstream audience. Our diverse team investigated dramas in all four of the official languages of Singapore: English, Mandarin Chinese, Bahasa Melayu and Tamil. We found that depictions of hypnotherapy tend to produce problematic images of mental health professionals as manipulative, able to read minds, engaging in criminal behaviour, lacking in compassion and self-interested. Meanwhile, representations of ECT typically focus on the fear and distress of the patient, and it is primarily depicted as a disciplinary tool rather than a safe and effective medical procedure for patients whose condition is severe and refractory to pharmacotherapy and behavioural interventions. These depictions have the potential to discourage treatment-seeking behaviour-when early intervention has found to be crucial-among vulnerable populations.",

The aim of this study was to perform a randomized control trial comparing the efficacy of a digitally delivered program with and without GDH in IBS. METHODS: Adults with IBS were randomized to a 42-session daily digital program with the GDH Program (Nerva) or without (Active Control). Questionnaires were completed to assess gastrointestinal symptoms through IBS Symptom Severity Scale (IBS-SSS), quality of life, and psychological symptoms (Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale-21) at regular intervals during the program and 6 months following the conclusion on the intervention. The primary end point was the proportion of participants with ≥50-point decrease in IBS-SSS between the interventions at the end of the program. RESULTS: Of 240/244 randomized participants, 121 received GDH Program-the median age 38 (range 20-65) years, 90% female, IBS-SSS 321 (interquartile range 273-367)-and 119 Active Control-36 (21-65), 91% female, IBS-SSS 303 (255-360). At program completion, 81% met the primary end point with GDH Program vs 63% Active Control ( P = 0.002). IBS-SSS was median 208 (interquartile range 154-265) with GDH and 244 (190-308) with control ( P = 0.004), 30% reduction in pain was reported by 71% compared with 35% ( P < 0.001), and IBS quality of life improved by 14 (6-25) compared with 7 (1-15), respectively ( P < 0.001). Psychological status improved similarly in both groups. DISCUSSION: A digitally delivered GDH Program provided to patients with IBS was superior to the active control, with greater improvement in both gastrointestinal symptoms and quality of life and provides an equitable alternative to face-to-face behavioral strategies.",

      "abstract": "Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a frequent health condition which can be associated with functional disability and reduced health-related quality of life. IBS is classified as a disorder of the brain-gut axis. IBS is a very heterogenous condition with regards to the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms, the clinical picture and the amount of functional impairment. Within a biopsychosocial model of IBS psychosocial factors can play a role in the in the predisposition, triggering and development of chronicity. Somatic or psychosocial or a mixture of both factors might predominate in an individual patient. Gut-directed hypnosis is a special type of medical hypnosis combining standardised gut-directed suggestions (hypnosis) with suggestions tailored to the psychological characteristics of the patient (hypnotherapy). Of brain-gut behavioral therapies, cognitive bahvioral-based interventions and gut-directed hypnosis have the largest evidence for both short-term and long-term efficacy in controlled trials for IBS and are recommended by current European and North American gastroenterology guidelines as second line treatment options. Standardised gut-directed hypnosis is available by audiotapes and can be part of a multicomponent self-management approach by digital health applications. It can be used - based on the patient's preferences-as first line therapy for mild forms of IBS. Severe forms of IBS require face-to-face interdisciplinary management. Standardised gut-directed hypnosis and hypnotherapy tailored to the individual patient can be part of this approach."

The Nerva app, developed by Mindset Health, shows promise for dissemination and implementation of evidence-based GDH intervention for IBS. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to describe the demographic and clinical characteristics of Nerva app users, examine usage patterns, and explore potential factors associated with Nerva app usage. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of data was conducted of 14,898 individuals who downloaded and used the Nerva app between January 2022 and September 2022. Descriptive statistics and Chi-square tests of independence were calculated to examine demographic/clinical characteristics, usage patterns, and their associations to program persistence. Simple linear regression models were used for correlations of GI symptoms severity scores to user persistence. RESULTS: Users predominantly identified as female (77.2%; n = 11,503) and had a mean age of 38.59 years old (SD = 13.38). Thirty-one percent of users persisted with the program, and a small statistically significant association was found between Nerva app program persistence and age, χ2 (6, N = 6745) = 164.82, p < 0.001, V = .16. CONCLUSIONS: The present study found promising adherence rates for the Nerva app program within the first six weeks of use. Statistics in prevalence estimates of IBS agree with previous literature and significant associations were found between user/clinical characteristics and Nerva app program persistence."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Cancer remains a leading cause of death in Australia. The number of new cancer cases diagnosed each year is expected to surpass 200,000 by 2033. This marks a significant increase from about 88,000 cases in 2000 to an estimated 165,000 cases in 2023. Despite advancements in treatment, emotional and psychological challenges in cancer care are often overlooked. This study focuses on hypnotherapy, a complementary therapy recognized for its efficacy for physical and emotional symptoms, yet underutilized in Australian cancer care. The research aims to explore patients' perceptions of hypnotherapy and identify barriers to its integration, contributing to the development of holistic, patient-centered cancer care models. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A qualitative study employing semi-structured interviews was conducted with 14 adult cancer patients (breast, lung, and colorectal) undergoing active treatment, selected through convenience sampling. The interviews were carried out from May 2022 to August 2023, focusing on participants' experiences and attitudes toward hypnotherapy among other complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) therapies. Thematic analysis using Braun and Clarke's six-step framework was applied to the data. RESULTS: Five themes were developed following analysis: 1) emotional roller coaster of cancer diagnosis, 2) participants' perspectives on hypnotherapy among other CAM modalities, 3) hypnotherapy as a psychological vs physiological support, 4) fringe benefits of hypnosis, and 5) the main hurdles: cost and lack of information. Participants expressed a diverse range of experiences and attitudes towards hypnotherapy and CAM, with a strong emphasis on the need for emotional support in cancer care. Although hypnotherapy was recognized for its potential to address both emotional and physical symptoms, its predominant use was for emotional well-being. Participants also highlighted the importance of attitudes and endorsements from healthcare providers in their decision-making process about CAM therapies. CONCLUSION: The study findings emphasize the need for a more integrative and patient-centered approach in cancer care that includes hypnotherapy as a non-pharmacological intervention for physical and particularly emotional support. Healthcare providers should be aware of the potential value of hypnotherapy and consider patient preferences in their recommendations. In addition, addressing the identified barriers could improve the accessibility and integration of hypnotherapy into cancer care protocols in Australia.",

While gut-directed hypnotherapy is effective for refractory disorders of gut-brain interaction, the required internal awareness and vulnerability may be challenging. Driven by our own clinical experiences, we conducted qualitative interviews with patients who identified as transgender or gender diverse and who had discontinued gut-directed hypnotherapy. Four main themes were generated from these interviews related to distress resulting from body awareness, difficulty with vulnerability, the importance of gender-affirming supports, and external barriers. Providers are encouraged to consider gender diversity, and more broadly body image, in discussion of hypnosis treatment."

A small trial reported statistically significant remission at one year (p = .04), but larger trials, including one with 63 patients, showed no significant gastrointestinal improvements. The first case series noted post-intervention reduction in the mediators of inflammation in rectal mucosal, without long-term monitoring. The second case series observed the absence of flare episodes in 12 of 13 ulcerative colitis patients during follow-up, possibly influenced by the simultaneous use of two drugs alongside hypnotherapy. Psychological outcomes, demonstrated no significant differences between hypnotherapy and control groups. While current literature doesn't decisively support hypnotherapy for managing IBD symptoms, it underscores the importance of further research, including randomized clinical trials, to thoroughly assess its effectiveness in this context.",

Studies meeting inclusion criteria, including randomized controlled trials (RCTs), were evaluated for methodological quality using the PEDro scale. The searches yielded a total of 84 results, from which 7 RCTs of high scientific quality were selected. Each article examined the impact of a hypnosis intervention during pregnancy and the results obtained during labor. The analysis covered the use of epidural anesthesia, pharmacological analgesia during labor, self-reported pain, labor duration, type of delivery, fear of childbirth, and childbirth experience. The results demonstrated benefits in reducing fear and pain during labor, along with an enhancement in the overall childbirth experience. Hypnotherapy can be a valuable resource for reducing fear and pain during labor and improving the lived childbirth experience."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Hot flashes are associated with a lower quality of life and sleep disturbances. Given the many consequences of hot flashes, it is important to find treatments to reduce them. Hypnotherapy, the use of hypnosis for a medical disorder or concern, has been shown in clinical trials to be effective in reducing hot flashes, but it is not routinely used in clinical practice. One solution to close this implementation gap is to administer hypnotherapy for hot flashes via a smartphone app. Evia is a smartphone app that delivers hypnotherapy for hot flashes. Evia has made hypnotherapy more widely accessible for women who are experiencing hot flashes; however, the app has yet to undergo empirical testing. Additionally, research on user characteristics is lacking. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to (1) determine the average age, stage of menopause, and length of menopause symptoms for users of the Evia app; (2) determine the characteristics of hot flashes and night sweats for users of the Evia app; (3) determine the self-reported sleep quality of users of the Evia app; (4) determine the self-reported mental health of users of the Evia app; and (5) determine the relationship between hot flash frequency and anxiety and depression for users of the Evia app. METHODS: This study analyzed data collected from participants who have downloaded the Evia app. Data were collected at 1 time point from a self-report questionnaire that assessed the demographic and clinical characteristics of users. The questionnaire was given to users when they downloaded the Evia app. Users of the Evia app fill out a questionnaire upon enrolling in the program and prior to beginning the intervention. This included 9764 users. RESULTS: Results showed that the mean age of users was 49.31 years. A total of 41.6% (1942/4665) of users reported experiencing 5 or more hot flashes per day, while 51.2% (1473/2877) of users reported having difficulty falling asleep each night and 47.7% (1253/2626) of users reported their sleep quality to be terrible. In addition, 38.4% (1104/2877) of users reported that they often feel anxious or depressed. There was a small, significant, and negative correlation between hot flash frequency and self-report frequency of anxiety and depression (r=-0.09). CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that the average age of app users is in line with the median age of natural menopause. A large percentage of users reported experiencing 5 or more hot flashes per day, reported difficulties with sleep, and reported experiencing depression and anxiety. These findings are in line with previous studies that assessed hot flash frequency and the consequences of hot flashes. This was the first study to report on the characteristics of users of the Evia app. Results will be used to optimize the hypnotherapy program delivered via the Evia app."

      "abstract": "UNLABELLED: Worldwide, more than eight million people die each year as a result of tobacco use. A large proportion of smokers who want to quit are interested in alternative smoking cessation methods, of which hypnotherapy is the most popular. However, the efficacy of hypnotherapy as a tobacco cessation intervention cannot be considered sufficiently proven due to significant methodological limitations in the studies available to date. The aim of the present study was to compare the efficacy of a hypnotherapeutic group program for smoking cessation with that of an established cognitive-behavioral group program in a randomized controlled trial. A total of 360 smokers who were willing to quit were randomly assigned to either hypnotherapy (HT) or cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) at two study sites, without regard to treatment preference. They each underwent a 6 weeks smoking cessation course (one 90 min group session per week) and were followed up at regular intervals over a 12 months period. The primary outcome variable was defined as continuous abstinence from smoking according to the Russell standard, verified by a carbon monoxide measurement at three measurement time points. Secondary outcome variables were 7 days point prevalence abstinence during the 12 months follow up and the number of cigarettes the non-quitters smoked per smoking day (smoking intensity). Generalized estimating equations were used to test treatment condition, hypnotic suggestibility, and treatment expectancy as predictors of abstinence. The two interventions did not differ significantly in the proportion of participants who remained continuously abstinent throughout the follow-up period (CBT: 15.6%, HT: 15.0%) and also regarding the 7 days abstinence rates during the 12 months follow-up (CBT: 21.2%, HT: 16.7%). However, when controlling for hypnotic suggestibility, CBT showed significantly higher 7 days abstinence rates. In terms of the continuous abstinence rates, it can be concluded that the efficacy of hypnotherapeutic methods for smoking cessation seem to be comparable to established programs such as CBT.

A total of 232 articles were identified through systematic search strategies in four databases. Following rigorous screening, 14 studies, varying from case studies to randomized controlled trials, were included in the final review. The age range of participants spanned from 18 to 70 years, and the number of female participants generally exceeded that of males in these studies. Hypnotherapy was found to be frequently used as an adjunct treatment alongside various types of psychotherapy such as cognitive behavioral therapy and often included techniques like hypnotic induction, ego strengthening, and self-hypnosis. The treatment duration varied from 3 sessions to as long as 20 weekly sessions. Most importantly, the majority of the studies found hypnotherapy to be effective in reducing symptoms of depression, with some studies suggesting it has superior effects to antidepressant treatment in areas such as overall health and vitality. This review highlights the potential of hypnotherapy as a viable treatment option for depression and highlights the need for further controlled studies to establish its efficacy.",

PURPOSE: In this paper, we will distinguish pseudoscientific claims from evidence-based uses of hypnotherapy. RESULTS: The use and acceptability of hypnotherapy has varied over history. Pseudoscientific uses, based on outdated theories that it can access the unconscious mind, have delegitimized hypnotherapy. Modern theories that hypnosis uses common social, emotional, and cognitive processes combined with evidence-based methods have re-established the use of hypnotherapy in many physical and mental health disorders and symptoms. Currently it is a widely accepted and recommended treatment for irritable bowel syndrome, with evidence building for many other applications. CONCLUSION: Hypnotherapy, as a pseudoscience, can become unethical and cause distress for the patient and their families. Hypnotherapy, as an evidence-based treatment, can be used as a powerful tool to treat physical and psychological symptoms related to medical ailments.",

This study aims to evaluate the impact of audio hypnotherapy on the psychological, exclusive breastfeeding behavior, the OXTR protein and mRNA expression gene OXTR in mothers of infants aged 0-6 months. This study employed a Pragmatic Randomized Controlled Trial design, conducted from November 2022 to May 2023 in 11 primary health centers. The study population included breastfeeding mothers with infants aged 0-6 months, with a total sample size of 70 respondents who were randomly divided into intervention (received audio hypnotherapy) and control groups (received standard care). The psychological condition was measured using the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale. Exclusive breastfeeding behavior was assessed based on both quality and quantity. Genetic factors were evaluated through mRNA OXTR expression using real-time PCR and protein OXTR levels using ELISA. Analyzing data using linear and logistic regression models. Both bivariate and multivariate analyses revealed significant differences in psychological condition (p < .0001). There were big differences in the exclusive breastfeeding behavior (p < .0001), as well as in the amounts of protein OXTR and mRNA expression of the OXTR gene (p < .0001). We recommend the implementation of audio hypnotherapy as an effective complementary therapeutic approach to manage the psychological well-being, exclusive breastfeeding behavior, the mRNA expression of the OXTR gene and levels of OXTR protein in mothers of infants aged 0-6 months.",

Due to the high prevalence and increasing numbers, along with problems in various aspects of the patient's life, new effective treatments are essential in this field. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study was a single-blinded randomized clinical trial. Thirty-four patients with major depressive disorder who were referred by clinical psychologists in the clinical psychology clinic of the Taleghani Hospital, Tehran, Iran, were selected by purposive sampling method and randomly assigned to the intervention and wait-list control groups. The Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale, the Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire, and the Mental Health Continuum Short Form were administered during the baseline and post treatment. Analyses of covariance and the repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) procedure were performed to determine the difference between study groups. RESULTS: The results of the analysis of covariance and repeated measures ANOVA showed a clinically significant decrease in difficulties in emotion regulation and a significant increase in mindfulness and mental health in the intervention group (P < 0.001). The mean score (standard deviation) of the difficulties in emotion regulation scores was 123.75 (21.10) in the experimental group at baseline and significantly decreased to 76.19 (26.45) and 68.00 (22.83) after the intervention and two-month follow-up, respectively (P < 0.001). Additionally, the mean scores (standard deviation) for mindfulness and mental health were 93.06 (8.23) and 19.63 (7.92), respectively, at baseline and significantly increased to 149.43 (16.99) and 51.62 (9.78), respectively, after the intervention and to 144.18 (20.55) and 48.50 (13.52) after a two-month follow-up (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: The results show that mindful hypnotherapy is an effective treatment for improving difficulties in emotion regulation, mindfulness, and mental health in patients with major depressive disorder."

This is likely due to the focus the hypnosis literature has had on the role played by the hypnotist/therapist and less on the phenomenological control (control over subjective experience) applied by the patient. Whilst early approaches to hypnosis and hypnotherapy included concepts such as autosuggestion and self-hypnosis, the role of the self has been largely overlooked. Here we aim to highlight the importance of the self in hypnotherapy and hypnosis by considering the concept of self-hypnosis and how it relates to hetero-hypnosis. We will show that: 1) historically the self was an important component of the concept of hypnosis; 2) extant theories emphasise the role of the self in hypnosis; 3) self-hypnosis is largely indistinguishable from hetero-hypnosis; 4) self-hypnosis is as effective as hetero-hypnosis. We also argue that highlighting the role of the self in hypnotherapy and hypnosis could increase feelings of self-efficacy, especially given that it can be considered a skill that can be advanced and implies self-control and not \"mind-control\". Highlighting the role of phenomenological control by the patient could also increase the uptake of hypnotherapy as treatment for various disorders.",

Despite its considerable evidence base, gut-directed hypnotherapy is not widely available and remains a limited resource. This emphasises the need to select patients who are most likely to benefit. AIM: To determine whether baseline patient characteristics were predictive of response to gut-directed hypnotherapy in patients with IBS METHODS: We conducted a secondary analysis of outcomes of 448 patients with refractory Rome III IBS who participated in a randomised study confirming non-inferiority of 6 compared to 12 sessions of gut-directed hypnotherapy. We compared baseline patient characteristics, including age, sex, IBS subtype, quality of life and IBS-Symptom Severity Scale (IBS-SSS), non-colonic symptom score and Hospital Anxiety and Depression (HAD) score between responders and non-responders. We defined response as ≥50-point decrease in IBS-SSS or ≥30% reduction in pain severity scores. RESULTS: Overall, 76.3% achieved ≥50-point decrease in IBS-SSS. Responders had a higher baseline non-colonic symptom score (p = 0.005). Those who achieved ≥30% improvement in abdominal pain scores (59.8%) had higher baseline IBS-SSS (p = 0.03), and lower baseline HAD-depression score (p = 0.012). Fifty-four patients (12%) dropped out of gut-directed hypnotherapy. Compared to completers, dropouts had higher baseline HAD-anxiety score (p = 0.034). CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that patients with a higher burden of gastrointestinal and extraintestinal symptoms are most likely to benefit from gut-specific behavioural intervention for refractory IBS. Clinical assessment of gastrointestinal, somatic and psychological symptom profiles may play a role in selecting patients for gut-directed hypnotherapy.",

MATERIALS: The sample consisted of 150 children (90 males, 60 females). Paper questionnaires, frequency meter, nitrous oxide dispenser in association with the use of the television were exploited. At the end of treatment, subjective pain was assessed using the VAS scale, while objective pain was assessed using the FLACC scale and heart rate. This made it possible to compare two experimental groups, one treated with nitrous oxide, and the other with hypnotherapy. The control group was treated with classic behavioural approach techniques. The results obtained were analysed by SPSS Software (Statistical Package for Social Science, version 27) and the inferences between the results were calculated for confirmation.

      "abstract": "UNLABELLED: A number of case studies describing hypnotherapy in the treatment of anxiety disorder patients have already been published. Only a few randomized controlled trials (RCTs) investigated the efficacy of hypnotherapy but focused mainly on symptoms rather than specific mental disorders. The goal of this study was to investigate whether hypnotherapy (HT) was superior to a waitlist control group (WL) in the reduction of agoraphobia-related symptoms. Further goals were to report the feasibility of hypnotherapy as well as attrition and completion rates and detect (epi-)genetic variables, which might play a role in treatment outcome. This pilot study was based on a monocentric two-armed randomized controlled rater-blind clinical trial that was conducted between 2018 and 2020 with a waitlist control group. A total of 36 patients diagnosed with agoraphobia were randomized to either HT or WL. Patients in HT received individual outpatient treatment with hypnotherapy with 8 to 12 sessions for a period of 3 months. Patients in WL received HT after 3 months. Agoraphobia-related symptoms were assessed at baseline, after the treatment, and 3 months later in both groups with a clinician rating. The primary hypothesis concerning the difference between groups in the individual percentage symptom reduction could be confirmed in the intention-to-treat, not the per-protocol sample. Additionally, we applied repeated-measures analyses of variance and found a higher symptom decrease in HT compared with WL patients in three of the five imputed datasets. The dropout rate was low, and satisfaction with the treatment was high. HT patients experienced a strong symptom reduction after receiving hypnotherapy. WL patients improved slightly during the waiting period. The COMT Val108/158Met genotype had an effect on the agoraphobia-related symptoms as well as on COMT DNA methylation levels. This is the first study to indicate that hypnotherapy performed better than a waitlist control group regarding the reduction in anxiety symptoms in an RCT. Future studies should confirm the efficacy of hypnotherapy and compare the treatment with a standard treatment for anxiety disorders in a larger trial. Future studies should also investigate whether hypnotic susceptibility is associated with COMT Val108/158Met genotype and could predict treatment success for HT.

The primary objective of this pilot trial was to evaluate feasibility and acceptability of virtually delivered hypnotherapy to determine the parameters for a future definitive trial. METHODS: This prospective, single-site, randomized controlled pilot and feasibility trial compared a 7-week course of virtually delivered adjunctive gut-directed hypnotherapy to standard medical treatment only for adults with Crohn's disease. Primary outcomes were study feasibility and intervention acceptability. Secondary outcomes were objective disease activity and patient-reported outcomes. Assessments took place at five time-points: baseline, post-intervention, and follow-up three-, six-, and 12-months post-intervention. KEY RESULTS: Recruitment took place between July 2020 and August 2021 at a tertiary hospital. Recruitment was initially slow and subsequently expanded to community settings. Thirty-seven participants were enrolled in the trial: 95% were retained at post-intervention and 76% at 12-months. Completion of online assessments was high (97-100% across all time-points) whilst objective data collection was low (34-44%). Most intervention participants completed all hypnotherapy sessions (88%) and reported being extremely satisfied (73%), despite 60% experiencing technical issues. CONCLUSION & INFERENCES: Virtually delivered hypnotherapy was acceptable to participants. Certain aspects of the trial including online assessment were feasible, while recruitment and objective data collection were challenges. Undertaking a future definitive trial will require broader recruitment scope and significant funding for widespread objective data collection.

In a randomized-controlled study comparing the efficacy of hypnotherapy (HT) with cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for mild to moderate depressive episodes, a non-inferiority of HT compared to CBT could be found. The aim of this study was to examine depressive symptomatology in the long-term course three and a half years after end of the treatment. METHODS: A total of 152 randomized patients received outpatient individual psychotherapy with 16 to 20 sessions over a period of six months. All were invited to participate in a follow-up three and a half years after the end of treatment where depressive symptoms were assessed via self- and clinician-ratings. In the per-protocol (PP) analysis, only those with available data were included, but a comparison of characteristics was made with individuals without participation in the follow-up survey. An additional intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis was conducted with multiple imputed data for missing data. RESULTS: A total of 71 subjects (46.7%) participated in the follow-up. The noninferiority in the percentage symptom reduction assessed with the clinician-rating of HT compared with CBT was confirmed in the PP and the ITT sample. The symptom improvement in self- and clinician-rating by the end of therapy persisted during the follow-up. Response rates and remission rates for both self- and clinician-ratings are reported. CONCLUSION: In this study, indications were found that HT was noninferior to CBT in the treatment of depression, even in the long term. Further studies should examine the efficacy of HT in larger multicenter samples and identify predictors of individual treatment success.",

      "abstract": "Sleep disturbance can negatively affect physical and psychological health. Hypnotherapy may be effective for improving sleep with fewer side effects than other treatments. The purpose of this systematic review is to comprehensively identify studies and evidence regarding hypnotherapy for sleep disturbances. Four databases were searched to identify studies examining the use of hypnotherapy for sleep in adult populations. The search yielded 416 articles, of which 44 were included. Qualitative data analysis revealed that 47.7% of the studies showed positive results regarding the impact of hypnotherapy for sleep, 22.7% showed mixed results, and 29.5% showed no impact. A subset of 11 studies that set sleep disturbance as an inclusion criterion and included suggestions for sleep were examined separately and had more favorable results, such that 54.5% showed positive results, 36.4% showed mixed results, and 9.1% showed no impact results. Hypnotherapy appears to be a promising treatment for sleep disturbance. Future studies should report effect sizes, adverse events, and hypnotizability and include sleep-specific suggestions, standardized measures, and descriptions of hypnotherapy intervention procedures.",

We report the first randomized controlled trial comparing the safety and efficacy of a self-administered, digital GDH treatment program with that of digital muscle relaxation (MR) in adults with IBS. METHODS: After a 4-week run-in period, patients were randomized to 12 weeks of treatment with digital GDH (Regulora), or digital MR accessed via a mobile app on a smartphone or tablet. The primary endpoint was abdominal pain response, defined as ≥30% reduction from baseline in average daily abdominal pain intensity in the 4 weeks following treatment. Key secondary outcomes included mean change from baseline in abdominal pain, stool consistency, and stool frequency. RESULTS: Of 378 randomized patients, 362 were treated and included in the efficacy analysis. A similar proportion of the GDH (30.4%) and MR (27.1%) groups met the primary endpoint, with no significant difference between the groups (P = .5352). Significantly more patients treated with GDH than MR were abdominal pain responders during the last 4 weeks of treatment (30.9% vs 21.5%; P = .0232) and over the entire treatment period (29.3% vs 18.8%; P = .0254). Improvements in abdominal pain, stool consistency, and stool frequency were consistent across IBS subtypes. No patients experienced serious adverse events or adverse events leading to study discontinuation. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with a digital GDH program led to an improvement in abdominal pain and stool symptoms in patients with IBS, supporting a role for this intervention as part of integrated care for IBS.

This qualitative study aims to explore individuals' experiences of losing weight through hypnotherapy and their perceived barriers and facilitators for healthy lifestyle changes. Semistructured interviews were conducted with 15 participants (11 women and 4 men; mean age of 23 years) who recorded having lost ≥5% weight after undergoing 3 hypnotherapy sessions previously at a public university in Terengganu, Malaysia. Each interview was audiotaped, transcribed, and analyzed using thematic analysis. The themes that emerged were the usefulness of hypnotherapy, barriers, and facilitators of healthy lifestyle changes. All participants contended that hypnotherapy played a role in their weight-loss journey through increased mindful eating and enhanced motivation to make lifestyle modifications. Barriers to healthy lifestyle changes included high costs of healthy foods and lack of support for healthy food sources in social and family settings. Hypnotherapy is essential as an adjunct tool in assisting weight loss. However, additional efforts are needed to improve support in the weight management journey.",

Hypnotherapy has been found to reduce pain associated with a range of disorders, including some with symptoms of chronic pain. AIM: The aim of this review is to systematically scope research investigating the use of hypnosis on chronic pelvic pain, quality of life, anxiety, depression and fatigue. METHOD: The scoping review was guided by the method described by Arksey and O'Mallee [1]. A systematic search was conducted in six databases. The Covidence Risk of Bias tool and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) quality assessment tool were used. RESULTS: Nine studies (four RCT's and five case series) were suitable for inclusion. Meta-analysis of the RCT's found no significant difference in pain or quality of life for the intervention group compared to controls. Only one study reported a reduction in pain after hypnotherapy and did not outperform controls. These results are limited due to lack of a standardised intervention and heterogeneity of the included studies. CONCLUSION: There is a need for further research using well designed randomized controlled trials with validated measures of pain, quality of life, anxiety, depression and fatigue. Hypnotherapy interventions utilised in further research should be grounded in evidence-based best practice for dealing with pain.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Children often present to primary care with functional abdominal pain (FAP) or irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), and around half still have abdominal complaints 1 year later. Hypnotherapy is an evidence-based treatment that is used in specialist care, but it lacks evidence in primary care. This study will investigate the (cost) effectiveness of home-based guided hypnotherapy for children with FAP or IBS in primary care. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We report the design of a pragmatic randomised controlled trial among children aged 7-17 years, diagnosed with FAP or IBS by their general practitioner (GP), with assessments over 12 months. The control group will receive care as usual (CAU) by their GP (eg, communication, education and reassurance), while the intervention group will receive CAU plus 3 months of home-based guided hypnotherapy via a website. The primary outcome will be the proportion of children with adequate relief from abdominal pain/discomfort at 12 months, analysed on an intention-to-treat basis. Secondary outcomes will include the adequacy of pain relief at 3 and 6 months, pain/discomfort severity, pain frequency and intensity, daily functioning and impact on function, anxiety and depression, pain beliefs, sleep disturbances, school absence, somatisation, and healthcare use and costs. We must include 200 children to determine a 20% difference in those with adequate relief (55% control vs 75% intervention). ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The Medical Ethics Review Committee of the University Medical Center Groningen, the Netherlands, approved this study (METc2020/237). The results will be disseminated to patients, GPs and other stakeholders via email, a dedicated website, peer-reviewed publications and presentations at national and international conferences. We plan to collaborate with the Dutch Society of GPs to implement the results in clinical practice. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT05636358.",

Going beyond its history and assumed neurophysiology, the chances of success for hypnotherapy will be outlined per pediatric speciality, accentuated by clinical research and experiences. Future implications and recommendations are given on extracting the positive effects of medical hypnotherapy for all pediatricians.    Conclusion: Medical hypnotherapy is an effective treatment for children with specified conditions such as abdominal pain or headache. Studies suggest effectiveness for other pediatric disciplines, from the first line up to third line of care. In a time in which health is defined as 'a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being', hypnotherapy stays an underrated treatment option for children. It is a unique mind-body treatment, which true potential still needs to be unraveled. What is Known: • Mind-body health techniques become a more relevant and accepted part of treatment in pediatric patients. • Medical hypnotherapy is an effective treatment for children with specified conditions such as functional abdominal pain. What is New: • Studies suggest the effectiveness of hypnotherapy in a high variety of pediatric symptoms and disease. • Hypnotherapy is a unique mind-body treatment which potential goes far beyond its current utilization.",

To accomplish this, you will need to input the experimental data into the trained model and compare the evaluation results from experts with the model's predictions.

      "abstract": "Remote hypnotherapy is a treatment that is increasingly being utilized internationally. Its adoption has been accelerated following the COVID-19 pandemic when infection control measures mandated its implementation. Remote hypnotherapy via video, rather than telephone therapy, appears to be more popular and effective, which appears to be acceptable to patients and - compared to face-to-face therapy - has the potential to improve access. In this state-of-the-art article, the authors therefore review the latest literature in this exciting field of remote teletherapy, discussing adoption of video hypnotherapy; its evidence, including efficacy compared to face-to-face therapy; patient satisfaction; advantages and disadvantages of teletherapy; as well as practical considerations and factors that should be considered when deciding on the mode of delivery. They also discuss training implications of the recent developments. Finally, they highlight areas for future research and development. Overall, it is likely that remote hypnotherapy via video platforms is here to stay long term and has potential to become the standard form of therapy worldwide. However, recent data suggest that there may still be a need for face-to-face therapy with patient choice being an important factor.",

Of the 152 randomized patients with current depression, 136 were available for the follow-up analyses. The course of self-rated depressive symptoms during follow-ups was analyzed with linear mixed-effects models. Time to a full remission, defined as eight consecutive weeks without depression, was compared between groups in a survival analysis. The self-reported depressive symptoms could be maintained on a low symptom level during the 12-month follow-up for both HT and CBT. Overall, both treatments achieved comparably high long-term remission rates of 73% after a median of 30 weeks. Outpatient psychotherapy with HT achieved good long-term results mostly comparable to CBT.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Hypnotherapy is a useful treatment for a variety of gastrointestinal conditions. While there is strong evidence for delivering other treatments virtually and in groups, there is no research thus far on delivering hypnotherapy in this format. Given the growth of both psychogastroenterology and telehealth, these methods should be explored as they have great potential for increasing access and cost-effectiveness of intervention. AIMS: This qualitative study was developed to help understand patients experiences in virtual, group-based, gut-directed hypnotherapy (GDH) in two different institutions. METHODS: Authors developed a qualitative interview with the assistance of two patient partners and then recruited patients from New York University and Dartmouth Health to participate. Interviews were completed one-on-one with patients who started and then completed GDH (≥5 visits) and who did not complete GDH (≤3 visits). Data were coded and then analyzed using thematic analysis. RESULTS: Twenty-one patients from NYU and Dartmouth participated in qualitative interviews. Broadly, patients reported coming to GDH because they believed in the importance of the mind-body connection or were desperate for treatment. Regardless of why patients came to GDH, they generally reported positive outcomes for GI symptoms and for other physical and mental health conditions. Most patients appreciated the group and virtual formats, though some concerns about inflexible schedules and lack of anonymity were voiced. Despite these concerns, there was broad support for virtual, group-based GDH and general excitement for behavioral health programming. CONCLUSION: Virtual, group-based GDH is an acceptable treatment for patients from rural and urban settings. Given the possible improvements in access and cost-effectiveness that this treatment modality can provide, GI practices may want to consider it in lieu of or in addition to the traditional one-on-one treatment format. Barriers and facilitators and recommendations for practice are discussed."

      "abstract": "This study was a randomized controlled design and examined the feasibility and effectiveness of mindful hypnotherapy on psychological inflexibility, pain acceptance, headache disability, and headache intensity in patients with chronic migraine headaches. The sample consisted of 38 females with chronic migraine who were randomly assigned to mindful hypnotherapy and medical treatment as usual groups. Psychological inflexibility pain scale (PIPS), chronic pain acceptance questionnaire-revised (CPAQ-R), headache disability inventory (HDI), diary scale for headache, and short-form McGill pain questionnaire 2 (SF-MPQ-2) were administered at baseline and post-treatment in both groups. The psychological inflexibility mean (SD) score was 81.00 (12.15) at baseline, which significantly decreased to 53.28 (17.06) after the intervention (p < 0.001). Additionally, the mean (SD) score of the pain acceptance was 46.44 (11.16), which significantly increased to 73.61 (15.65) in post-intervention (p < 0.001). Furthermore, the mean (SD) score of headache disability was 73.55 (19.48), which significantly decreased to 23.33 (19.88) in post-intervention (p < 0.001). Finally, headache intensity was 7.33 (0.98) and 5.78 (1.83), which significantly decreased to 2.77 (2.04), and 1.38 (1.48) after the intervention based on the Diary Scale for Headache and McGill Pain Questionnaire (SF-MPQ-2), respectively (p < 0.001). In conclusion, the results show that mindful hypnotherapy is a feasible and effective treatment for chronic migraine."

      "abstract": "Background: Patients with atopic dermatitis (AD) frequently use healthy lifestyle behaviors, although their benefits are unclear. This study's aim was to investigate the effectiveness of hypnotherapy, fasting with diet adjustments, and exercise in AD patients. Methods: In a four-armed randomized controlled monocenter open explorative clinical trial, adult patients with mild-to-moderate severe AD underwent, over 16 weeks, a five-session hypnotherapy group program (HTP), a five-session intermittent fasting with diet adjustment group program (IFDP), a five-session exercise group program (EP), or no study intervention (control) as add-on to topical corticosteroid use if required. Endpoints included subjectively perceived itching on a visual analogue scale (VAS, 0-100 mm); disease severity by SCORing Atopic Dermatitis (SCORAD); and adverse events (AEs). Endpoints were analyzed descriptively in the Full Analysis Set (FAS). Due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, relevant changes to the study protocol included online in addition to \"in-presence\" group interventions, closing the study arm EP and premature trial termination before randomization of 120 intended patients. Results: During the COVID-19 pandemic, study recruitment was poor. The FAS included 20 patients (17 female) with 35.0 ± 12.1 (mean ± standard deviation [SD]) years of age. At baseline, mean ± SD for HTP (n = 6), IFDP (n = 4), EP (n = 1), and control (n = 9) were VAS itching 63.2 ± 18.0, 65.0 ± 13.9, 43.0 mm, 62.1 ± 17.3; SCORAD 43.0 ± 13.6, 47.0 ± 21.0, 60.3, 39.1 ± 15.6. After 16 weeks, endpoints were VAS itching 26.0 ± 16.4, 31.7 ± 9.9, 23.0 mm, 39.3 ± 27.0; SCORAD 24.1 ± 12.2, 29.1 ± 19.1, 49.1, 25.5 ± 14.4. No serious AEs related to the interventions were observed. Conclusion: Despite very small groups, study results indicated potential beneficial changes to baseline in perceived itching intensity, disease severity, and disease-specific quality of life for HTP and IFDP. Therefore, further clinical trials should be performed investigating the effectiveness and safety of all interventions.

We aimed to evaluate patient experience and satisfaction following remote GDH. DESIGN: On completing 12 sessions of remote GDH via Skype using the Manchester protocol, patients with refractory IBS completed a feedback form on their experience. The proportion reporting positive outcomes (≥30% improvement in global IBS symptoms or abdominal pain, satisfaction, recommendation to family/friends) were compared by patient factors (age, gender, proximity, preferences). RESULTS: Of 52 patients completing the feedback form, 27 (52%) indicated that they would have opted for remote over face-to-face GDH, regardless of the pandemic situation. On a five-point scale (5=easy), patients rated the platform easy-to-use (mean 4.5±0.8) without impairment of communication (mean rating 4.6±0.8). Following remote GDH, 30/52 (58%) reported ≥30% global IBS symptom improvement, and 24/52 (46%) reported ≥30% pain reduction. 90% would recommend remote GDH to others. Only 39% felt they would have benefitted more from face to face. Those who would have chosen remote GDH regardless of the pandemic were more likely to be satisfied (p=0.01). Age, gender and proximity did not influence outcomes, satisfaction and likelihood of recommending remote GDH to others. Difficulties during remote sessions were infrequent in both those that were satisfied, and those that would have preferred face to face. CONCLUSION: These data support the need to continue developing remote GDH in the post-COVID era but suggest that there is still a role for face-to-face GDH, with patient choice being an important factor.",

      "abstract": "The E2R (Emotion, Regression, Repair) method is a pragmatic and innovative technique for treating psychological complaints. It is the result of the professional experience of two caregivers who have been training medical and paramedical colleagues since 2016 in this method. There is always an Emotion in the symptom that a patient presents. During the trance, the hypnotherapist uses it as a thread for age Regressions, often up to 3 years old. The patient can then identify a situation that triggered an identical experience. They self-reorganizes their emotional experience according to their needs, accompanied step by step by the therapist who follows the protocol of the repair loop. This new emotional reality experienced in trance replaces the factual reality of the previous trauma and reduces or even eliminates the present complaint through an adapted Repair. The E2R method works without taking a prior hypnotizability test. The need for change and the desire to engage in hypnotherapy are the only predispositions required, regardless of the complaint. A case study of a patient with chronic severe insomnia who received four sessions of hypnotherapy using the E2R protocol illustrates this approach and its benefits.",

Further, emotional well-being has been shown to reduce risk of death by nearly 20% (Cohen, et al., 2016). The lead article (Na et al., 2022) explores this issue and reports on a pilot study of hypnotic relaxation therapy for well-being (HRT-WB). Their findings demonstrate that 71% of participants achieved high levels of well-being or flourishing. In addition to this innovative study, several articles are included that increase access to scales that measure hypnotizability in French (Apelian, 2022), Russian (Kvitchasty 2022), and Spanish (Muñiz et al., 2022). Kasos et al. 2022 explore the role of hypnotizability in regard to skin conductance orienting response (SCR) in response to differing types of suggestions. Finally, Cordi and Rasch (2022) explore the role of hypnotizability in accurate perception of sleep, with findings suggesting sleep depth may be associated with slow wave sleep and interoceptive ability of accurately perceive sleep depth depending on hypnotizability. Together, these studies identify new applications of clinical hypnosis, increase the availability of scales to measure hypnotizability across cultures, and further understanding of hypnotizability.",

Results from this study indicated that adjunctive use of hypnotherapy with patients diagnosed with hyperemesis gravidarum experienced significantly reduced severity of nausea and frequency of vomiting compared to treatment-as-usual alone. Also, hospital stay was found to be shorter in the treatment group as compared to the control group.

For instance, gut-directed hypnotherapy (GDH), one of the most effective evidence-based treatments for IBS, is not recommended in Asian countries partly due to lack of population-specific outcome data. In this context, we evaluated the outcomes of GDH in an Asian population. METHODS: Consecutive British Asian patients with refractory IBS who received 12-sessions of GDH using the Manchester protocol were included. Patients were treated by a team including a therapist able to speak several Asian languages. All patients prospectively completed the following questionnaires before and after GDH: IBS symptom severity score (IBS-SSS), hospital anxiety and depression scale (HADS), non-colonic symptom score, and the quality-of-life (QOL) score. The primary outcome measure was response to GDH defined by ≥50-point reduction in IBS-SSS. Pre- and post-treatment data were compared statistically. RESULTS: Forty-four Asian patients with IBS (age 49 ± 13 years; 29 [66%] female; baseline IBS-SSS: 332.8 ± 94.6) completed GDH. Overall, 37 of 44 (84%) achieved a ≥50-point reduction in IBS-SSS and 25 of 44 (57%) achieved ≥30% reduction in abdominal pain scores. Following GDH, there were also significant mean improvements in IBS-SSS (-132.1, P < 0.0001), non-colonic symptom score (P < 0.0001), QOL score (P < 0.0001), HADS-anxiety (P < 0.0001), and HADS-depression (P < 0.0001), compared with baseline. CONCLUSION: Regardless of the ethnicity of the therapist, GDH was highly effective with similar response rates to outcomes in other IBS populations, supporting the development of GDH in Asian countries."

Beyond management concern for productivity, statutory protection is necessary to safeguard mental health, under the Australian Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) Act, organisations have a duty to eliminate or minimise risks to psychological (mental) health by designing effective workplace systems and Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) practitioners are central to the design and responsibility in managing these systems. Despite literature indicating the benefits of OHS workplace mental health initiatives, such as improved overall health, reduced absenteeism, increased job satisfaction and morale, there remains a lack of empirical research around program measurement, and their effectiveness in this area has been brought into question. The OHS function is interested in improving research around the relationship and connection between work performance and mental health but: there are few studies regarding performance outcomes of mental health OHS services within management journals and insufficient information around the prevalence of psychological morbidity in the workplace and its impact.

Pathobiome or gut dysbiosis is relevant for the pathogenesis of functional gastrointestinal disorders, such as IBS, chronic pain syndromes, and neurological and mental disorders. As a consequence, targeting the gut microbiota is emerging as a novel, effective therapeutic perspective. Among many treatment options, psychological interventions, including hypnosis, have been used to target the so-called psychobiome and its hypnotic analogue, i.e., hypnobiome, referring to their potential efficacy to modulate the mind-gut axis in IBS patients. A narrative review of the recent literature is provided and circumstantial evidence suggests that hypnobiome may represent a new promising frontier of hypnotherapy.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: We previously showed that standardized home-based gut-directed hypnosis exercises with compact disc (CD) is non-inferior to individual hypnotherapy (iHT) by a therapist in the treatment of children with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and functional abdominal pain (syndrome) (FAP(S)). Aim of this follow-up study was to investigate the long-term effects of standardized-hypnosis-recordings at home in comparison to iHT. METHODS: All participants from our previous randomized controlled trial were invited to complete: 1) an online standardized abdominal pain dairy, on which pain frequency and intensity were scored, and 2) an online questionnaire including adequate relief (AR), anxiety/depression scores, somatization, quality of life (QOL), pain beliefs, school and/or work absenteeism and health care utilization. RESULTS: 227 out of 250 (91%) participants completed this study. After a median duration of 6 years follow-up (5.8-6.2), 80.0% in the CD group vs 86.6% in the iHT group reported AR of their abdominal complaints (P=.22). Compared to the 1-year follow-up, AR percentages were stable. Treatment success was seen in 67.6% in the CD group vs 71.3% in the iHT group (P=.66). Anxiety and depression scores, somatization, pain beliefs, health care utilization and school/work absenteeism also improved significantly in both study groups compared with baseline. No differences were found in QOL-scores. CONCLUSIONS: Both home-based treatment with standardized-hypnosis-recordings and iHT given by a therapist show persisting positive results in more than 80% of children with IBS and FAP(S) after 6 years of follow-up. These results support the rationale for implementation of this easy-to-use, widely available and cost-effective home-treatment in daily practice.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Gut-directed hypnotherapy improves symptoms for patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Group hypnotherapy, as well as hypnotherapy administered by nurses, can increase treatment availability, but there are few comparisons between individual and group-based hypnotherapy. AIM: We aimed to evaluate and compare the effectiveness of nurse-administered hypnotherapy for IBS delivered individually or in groups. METHODS: IBS patients were randomised to individual or group hypnotherapy (8 sessions, 12 weeks). The primary endpoint was changes in severity of IBS symptoms. A responder was defined as reduction of IBS severity scoring system (IBS-SSS) ≥50 points at the end of treatment compared to baseline. The effects on extracolonic and psychological symptoms, and quality of life were also assessed. Symptoms were also followed up 6 months after treatment start. RESULTS: A total of 119 patients were randomised (61 individual, 58 group hypnotherapy). Patients reported improvements in IBS symptoms (IBS-SSS) (individual: 332 (273-401) (median, IQR), versus 216 (140-308), (p < 0.0001), group: 315 (239-382), versus 217 (149-314), (p < 0.0001)), with no differences between the groups (p = 0.16). Extracolonic symptoms, psychological symptoms and quality of life also improved, without clear differences between the groups. Sixty-nine percent of the individual hypnotherapy patients were responders after treatment versus 57% of the group hypnotherapy patients (p = 0.25). Symptom improvements were also seen at follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Nurse-administered gut-directed hypnotherapy, delivered individually or in groups, relieves IBS symptoms, improves psychological symptoms and quality of life. Group hypnotherapy can be an efficacious alternative, enabling more patients to benefit from the treatment (ClinicalTrials.gov ID no of study: NCT03432078).",

The present study aimed to determine the effect of hypnotherapy on the hospital anxiety in children with cancer. CASE PRESENTATION: This is a case report, in which a total of 3 female children with cancer were recruited using voluntary response sampling. Classical hypnotherapy was conducted for patients in eight treatment sessions with a one-month post-intervention follow-up. Participants completed the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) at five stages including before the intervention, third, fifth and eighth hypnotherapy sessions, and one month after the intervention. Data analysis was conducted using a statistical report on the recovery rate and effect size. CLINICAL DISCUSSION: The results showed that hypnotherapy had a significant and positive effect on the hospital anxiety, in the treatment and follow-up stages. CONCLUSIONS: Based upon the results, it can be stated that hypnotherapy is a promising approach in reducing the hospital anxiety in children with cancer."

The study adopted a three-arm randomized controlled trial design and achieved an effective sample size of 144. Self-reported psychological questionnaires were used to assess participants' IBS symptom severity, health-related quality of life, and coping patterns at baseline, immediately post-intervention, and 3 months after intervention. The evaluation focused primarily on IBS symptom severity and health-related quality of life, as well as on the illness coping patterns of symptom catastrophizing and symptoms-related social hypervigilance.The findings showed that significant improvements in IBS symptom severity occurred in all three types of study groups immediately after completion of the intervention (p < .05, ηρ2 = .20). However, only the traditional hypnotherapy groups and the Ericksonian hypnotherapy groups still had a notably significant decrease in symptoms 3 months after the intervention, whereas the educational talk groups had dropped back to pre-treatment symptom levels at the 3-month follow-up. The amplitude of change of symptom catastrophizing in the traditional hypnotherapy groups was stronger than that in the Ericksonian hypnotherapy groups after completion of the intervention, and the two types of hypnotherapy groups were significantly lower in symptom catastrophizing both immediately after the intervention and also 3 months post-intervention (p < .001, ηρ2 = .17). The other coping mechanism studied, symptoms-related social hypervigilance, showed a significant decline only in the Ericksonian hypnotherapy groups (ps < .001, ηρ2 = .45). Interestingly, in the traditional hypnotherapy groups, persons with higher hypnotic susceptibility showed significant improvement in symptom severity, health-related quality of life, and coping patterns following treatment. Notably, the effects from Ericksonian hypnotherapy for IBS diverged from the effects from traditional hypnotherapy. Finally, both Ericksonian hypnotherapy and traditional hypnotherapy appeared to have greater positive effects than educational talk did, but at different levels.",

METHODS: The quasi-experimental study was conducted from May 2019 to April 2020 in Islamabad and Rawalpindi, Pakistan, and comprised students aged 18-25 years at various universities and colleges in the twin cities. The participants were screened using deliberate self-harm inventory for >2 events without suicidal intention in line with the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 5th edition. They were then divided into two intervention and control groups. Over the following three months, the intervention group received cognitive behaviour hypnotherapy, while the control group did not receive any treatment. The groups were assessed post-intervention. The final phase comprised follow-up assessment of the condition. Data was analysed using SPSS 25. RESULTS: Of the 60 subjects, there were 30(50%) in each of the two groups. Overall, there were 41(68%) males and 19(32%) females. The majority of the subjects were aged 21-23 years 29(48%). More than 5 self-harm incidents were reported by 48(80%) subjects, while suicidal ideation was detected in 6(10%) students. The effect size of the study was good in terms of pre- and post-intervention values (d=4.90), the post-intervention and follow-up assessment values (d=0.32) and the pre-intervention and follow-up values (d=5.42). The comparison between treatment and no treatment groups indicated the effectiveness of treatment over no-treatment, F (1, 58) = 53.16, p < .001. CONCLUSIONS: Cognitive behaviour hypnotherapy was found to be effective in treating the nonsuicidal self-injury condition.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Burns and related procedures are painful and distressing for children, exposing them to acute and chronic sequelae that can negatively affect their physiological, psychological, and social functions. Non-pharmacological interventions such as distraction techniques are beneficial adjuncts to pharmacological agents for procedural pain, state anxiety, and itch in children with burns but have limitations (e.g. lack of research on burn-related itch, tailoring, and consensus on optimal treatment). Hypnotherapy is a non-pharmacological intervention that can be tailored for varied settings and populations with evidence of benefit for itch and superior effectiveness in comparison to other non-pharmacological interventions for children's procedural pain and state anxiety. Thus, children with burns can benefit from hypnotherapy as an adjunct to pharmacological agents. Yet, in paediatric burns, rigorous studies of effectiveness are limited and no studies have been identified that screen for hypnotic suggestibility, an important predictor of hypnotherapy outcomes. Considering potential barriers to the delivery of hypnotherapy in paediatric burns, the proposed study will examine the feasibility and acceptability of hypnotic suggestibility screening followed by hypnotherapy for procedural pain, state anxiety, and itch in children with acute burns. METHODS: An observational mixed-methods feasibility and acceptability study will be conducted over 15 weeks. Eligible children (N = 30) aged 4 to 16 years presenting to a paediatric burns outpatient centre in a metropolitan children's hospital in Australia with acute burns requiring dressing changes will be included. Eligible parents of children (N = up to 30) and clinicians who perform dressing changes (N = up to 20) will also be included. Child participants screened as having medium to high suggestibility as assessed by behavioural measures will receive hypnotherapy during dressing changes. A process evaluation will target feasibility and acceptability as primary outcomes and implementation (i.e. fidelity in delivery), reach, potential effectiveness, and adoption of evaluation procedures and intervention as secondary outcomes. DISCUSSION: Ethical approval was obtained from the Queensland Children's Hospital and Health Service ethics committee. Results will be published in peer-reviewed publications and conference proceedings. The findings will guide the design of future trials on the effectiveness of hypnotherapy and inform the development of child-centred hypnotic interventions in children with burns.

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Numerous studies have shown that hypnotherapy (HT) is effective in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) using traditional symptom severity end points. However, there is now interest in capturing the patient's perception of their illness and treatment because what patients expect from their treatment may differ from that of their healthcare provider. OBJECTIVE: To record patient perceptions and expectations of hypnotherapy as well as their symptom response. METHODS: 150 consecutive IBS patients (116 females, 34 males, aged 16-81 years) receiving hypnotherapy completed questionnaires recording IBS symptom severity, quality of life, noncolonic symptoms, anxiety and depression levels before and after treatment. Their expectations and perceptions of HT were also recorded, including a free text reflection. RESULTS: 121 patients (81%) responded to treatment consistent with our previous experience. Symptom severity scores, noncolonic symptoms, quality of life, anxiety and depression significantly all improved after HT (p < 0.001). Expectancy of an improvement with hypnotherapy was greater in those who did not respond to treatment (63%) than those who did (57%, p < 0.001). Scepticism and apprehension were common before treatment and replaced with enthusiasm afterwards. Free text responses after treatment were overwhelmingly positive. Patients also reported a variety of other benefits and even 20 of 29 symptom nonresponders (70%) still considered treatment worthwhile. CONCLUSION: Although initially perceived negatively, hypnotherapy improved symptoms and resulted in a wide range of additional benefits. Expectation did not necessarily influence outcome. Recording IBS symptoms alone does not fully capture the patient's experience of treatment and needs to be considered in future research."

These symptoms can be associated with other disorders such as depression, and drug treatments provide inadequate comfort for most people with them. OBJECTIVE: The study intended to examine the impact of hypnosis and hypnotherapy in the management of symptoms of people with multiple sclerosis (MS), such as stress, chronic pain, an inferior quality of life, and a lack of psychological well-being. DESIGN: The research team performed a systematic narrative review by searching the PubMed and Web of Science databases, including review articles and other studies for additional citations. SETTING: The study was conducted at our Scientific Institute for Research (IRCCS) in Messina. RESULTS: Only 14 of 121 publications met the inclusion criteria and were selected. Hypnotic treatment is an effective therapy that has beneficial impacts on the intensity of perceived pain, psychological well-being, mood disorders, and fatigue, and in addition, it significantly improves physical functioning in MS patients. The same effects haven't been obtained with other nonpharmacological techniques. CONCLUSION: Hypnosis is an appropriate psychological therapy for the management of MS patients' symptoms.",

      "abstract": "Hypnotherapy (HT) is a promising approach to treating depression, but so far, no data are available on the neuronal mechanisms of functional reorganization after HT for depressed patients. Here, 75 patients with mild to moderate depression, who received either HT or Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), were measured before and after therapy using functional near-infrared spectroscopy. We investigated the patients' cerebral activation during an emotional human gait paradigm. Further, rumination was included as predictor. Our results showed a decrease of functional connectivity (FC) between two regions that are crucial to emotional processing, the Extrastriate Body Area (EBA) and the Superior Temporal Sulcus (STS). This FC decrease was traced back to an activation change throughout therapy in the right STS, not the EBA and was only found in the HT group, depending on rumination: less ruminating HT patients showed a decrease in right STS activation, while highly ruminating patients showed an increase. We carefully propose that this activation change is due to the promotion of emotional experiences during HT, while in CBT a focus lay on activating behavior and changing negative cognitions. HT seemed to have had differential effects on the patients, depending on their rumination style: The increase of right STS activation in highly ruminating patients might mirror the improvement of impaired emotional processing, whilst the decrease of activation in low ruminating patients might reflect a dismissal of an over-compensation, associated with a hyperactivity before therapy. We conclude that HT affects emotional processing and this effect is moderated by rumination.",

There is some evidence to support the efficacy of hypnosis in treating insomnia but this evidence is based on methodologies of various strengths. This review aims to explore the methodological elements employed in hypnotherapy research to manage insomnia. METHOD: We performed a narrative review of the literature using systematic review methods focusing on treating insomnia with hypnosis. PubMed, Psycinfo, BASE and Cochrane databases and Google scholar were searched. RESULTS: Overall, 25 studies were included consisting of 10 case studies, 11 randomised, controlled trials and 4 pre and post intervention studies. The study designs, intervention, control and comparators were heterogeneous, as were the hypnosis definitions and techniques. Also, detailed descriptions of the hypnosis techniques were lacking. Most studies used non-quantifiable measurement criteria and sample numbers were too small to show significance or be representative. No double-blind study was found. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that the current research concerning the efficacy of hypnosis to relieve insomnia is lacking in key methodological elements. The evaluation research process requires robust methodology. We propose applying the IDEAL framework, which recommends research steps to evaluate non-pharmacological and other complex therapies to evaluate the efficacy of hypnosis to manage insomnia.",

While there are few effective treatment options for IBS in this age group, gut-focused hypnotherapy (GFH) has shown promise in several trials. Unfortunately, GFH is not widely available, and clinical data outside of trials are scarce. Here, we evaluated outcomes from GFH in patients with IBS, aged ≤18 years, from a tertiary referral centre. DESIGN/METHOD: Consecutive patients aged ≤18 years with severe IBS received 12 sessions of GFH, at weekly intervals, using the Manchester Protocol. Clinical outcomes data, including IBS Symptom Severity Score (IBS-SSS), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), Non-colonic Symptom Score and Quality-of-Life (QoL) score, were collected prospectively, and compared pre-GFH and post-GFH. Clinical response was defined as ≥50 point reduction in IBS-SSS. RESULTS: 32 young patients fulfilling Rome III diagnostic criteria for IBS (median age 16 (range 8-18) years, n=23/32 (72%) female individuals) completed GFH. At baseline, the mean duration of IBS was 5.9±0.9 years, and the mean IBS-SSS was 313±14. After GFH, 28/32 (88%) responded, with a mean overall reduction in IBS-SSS -159±16 (p<0.0001), and 24/32 (75%) achieved ≥30% reduction in abdominal pain scores. GFH also improved: non-colonic symptoms (p<0.0001), HADS-anxiety (p<0.0001), HADS-depression (p=0.0002) and QoL Scores (p<0.0001). CONCLUSION: GFH is highly effective in children and adolescents with IBS. Early intervention with GFH in childhood IBS may reduce the subsequent burden of this problem in adults."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND & AIMS: The potential effectiveness of gut-directed hypnotherapy (HT) is unknown for pediatric chronic nausea. This randomized controlled trial compared HT with standard medical treatment (SMT). METHODS: One hundred children (ages, 8-18 y) with chronic nausea and fulfilling functional nausea (FN) or functional dyspepsia (FD) criteria were allocated randomly (1:1) to HT or SMT, with a 3-month intervention period. Outcomes were assessed at baseline, at the halfway point, after treatment, and at the 6- and 12-month follow-up evaluation. Children scored nausea symptoms in a 7-day diary. The primary outcome was treatment success, defined as a reduction in nausea of 50% or more, at the 12-month follow-up evaluation. Secondary outcomes included adequate relief of nausea. RESULTS: After treatment and at the 6-month follow-up evaluation, there was a trend toward higher treatment success in the HT group compared with the SMT group (45% vs 26%, P = .052; and 57% vs 40%, P = .099, respectively). At 12 months, treatment success was similar in both groups (60% in the HT group and 55% in the SMT group; P = .667). In the FN group, significantly higher success rates were found for HT, but no differences were found in patients with FD. Adequate relief was significantly higher in the HT group than in the SMT group at the 6-month follow-up evaluation (children: 81% vs 55%, P = .014; parents: 79% vs 53%; P = .016), but not at the 12-month follow-up evaluation. CONCLUSIONS: HT and SMT were effective in reducing nausea symptoms in children with FN and FD. In children with FN, HT was more effective than SMT during and after the first 6 months of treatment. Therefore, HT and SMT, applied separately or in combination, should be offered to children with FN as a treatment option (Clinical trials registration number: NTR5814).",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Individual hypnotherapy (IH) is a recognised treatment for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). However, it is not widely available to patients due to its resource-intensive nature, lack of adequately trained therapists, and scepticism about hypnosis. Non-individualised hypnotherapy approaches, such as group and self-help hypnotherapy, could maximise existing therapist resources by treating more patients at the same time, thus widening patient access to treatment without incurring additional expenditure. AIMS: To investigate the research literature for non-individualised approaches to hypnotherapy for IBS and to determine their effectiveness for reducing symptom severity and/or providing adequate relief. METHODS: A literature review of published peer-reviewed studies was conducted. Quantitative research was selected to determine the effectiveness of the interventions. RESULTS: Ten studies were eligible for inclusion. Three delivered group hypnotherapy, three integrated hypnosis within a group concept, and four utilised a self-help home hypnotherapy treatment using audio recordings. Both group hypnotherapy for adults and the self-help home hypnotherapy treatment for children were effective interventions that may be non-inferior to IH for patients with mild-to-moderate symptoms. Treatment benefits were long-lasting. The evidence for the integrative group concept and home treatment for adults was less compelling. CONCLUSIONS: Group hypnotherapy for adults, and self-help hypnotherapy for children, may be cost-effective treatments that can widen access for patients with milder IBS in primary care settings. Further research is needed to determine the effectiveness of group hypnotherapy for patients with severe, refractory IBS.",

We evaluated the changes in Body Mass Indexes with hypnotherapy used to treat obesity. METHODS: A total of 230 subjects with a Body Mass Index of 25 and over, who completed a minimum of 10-week sessions, were included in the study. The participants were first identified with the information form and the Body Mass Index. Then, once a week hypnotherapy session was performed for at least 10 weeks. This study is a non-randomized prospective study examining the effect of hypnotherapy on body mass index. RESULTS: There was no statistically significant difference between the, dinner heavy meals and regular exercise or movement, and there was no statistically significant difference in terms of the baseline and endpoint of hypnotherapy (P = .777 and P = .770). There was a statistically significant difference in terms of sex and night feeding status at the beginning and end of hypnotherapy (P = .042 and P < .001). According to the Body Mass Indexes at the beginning and end of hypnotherapy; The initial Body Mass Index was 34.83 ± 5.81 and the end Body Mass Index was 32.61 ± 5.66. The difference was statistically significant (P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: It has been found that hypnotherapy is an effective method in the obesity treatment. It is easy to apply, cheap, effective, no side effect potential, the advantages of being added either alone or in other treatments.",

Their prevalence is at an alarming rate worldwide due to poor compliance with conventional treatment and high rates of relapse, thus increasing demand for an effective and safe alternative approach such as hypnotherapy. This study aimed to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of hypnotherapy for weight loss and to compare these among selected socio-demographics. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted among 30 students and staff of a public university in Terengganu, Malaysia using convenience sampling. Data analysis was carried out using SPSS 23.0. RESULTS: Among the respondents (age = 26.17 ± 8.23 years; female = 66.7%; students = 63.3%), 40.0% were overweight and 60.0% were obese. Results indicated excellent feasibility as determined by participants' satisfaction towards the clarity of hypnotherapist's voice (93.3%), the suitability of content (86.7%) and time spent for the session (90.0%). Good overall acceptability (>60.0%) was also reported regarding hypnotherapist professionalism, the environment and perceived usefulness of hypnotherapy. Obese individuals were significantly more satisfied towards the hypnotherapist environment than overweight respondents (p=0.015). Additionally, no adverse effects were reported after the intervention. CONCLUSIONS: This evidence signalled that hypnotherapy is a promising alternative tool in assisting overweight and obese individuals to lose weight. Extensive research is needed to substantiate its role in weight management programs for its full benefits.",

The aim of this study was to determine whether Hypnotherapy (HT) is not inferior to Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), the gold-standard psychotherapy, in the percentage reduction of depressive symptoms, assessed in mild to moderate Major Depression (MD). METHODS: This study reports the main results of a monocentric two-armed randomized-controlled rater-blind clinical trial. A total of 152 patients with MD were randomized to either CBT or HT receiving outpatient individual psychotherapy with 16 to 20 sessions for the duration of six months. The primary outcome was the mean percentage improvement in depressive symptoms assessed with the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) before and after treatment. RESULTS: The difference in the mean percentage symptom reduction between HT and CBT was 2.8 (95% CI=-9.85 to 15.44) in the Intention-to-treat sample and 4.0 (95% CI=-9.27 to 17.27) in the Per Protocol sample (N=134). Concerning the pre-specified non-inferiority margin of -16.4, both results confirm the non-inferiority of HT to CBT. The results for the follow-ups six and twelve months after the end of the treatment support the primary results. LIMITATIONS: For ethical reasons the trial did not include a control group without treatment; therefore we can only indirectly conclude that both treatment conditions are effective. CONCLUSION: This is the first study to demonstrate that HT was not inferior to CBT in MD, while employing rigorous methodological standards.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Inadequately treated pain and distress elicited by medical procedures can put children at higher risk of acute and chronic biopsychosocial sequelae. Children can benefit from hypnotherapy, a psychologically tailored intervention, as an adjunct to pharmacological agents to address the multiple components of pain and distress. Despite providing evidence on the effectiveness and potential superiority of hypnotherapy to other psychological interventions, research on hypnotherapy for pediatric procedural pain and distress has been predominantly limited to oncology and needle procedures. Plus, there is a lack of reporting of intervention manuals, factors influencing hypnotic responding, pain unpleasantness outcomes, theoretical frameworks, adverse events, as well as barriers and facilitators to the feasibility of delivering the intervention and study procedures. The proposed review aims to map the range and nature of the evidence on hypnotherapy for procedural pain and distress in children to identify gaps in literature and areas requiring further investigation. METHODS: This review will follow the Arksey and O'Malley (2005) methodology and incorporate additional scoping review recommendations by the Joanna Briggs Institute and Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses. Relevant studies will be identified through searching published literature databases (PubMed, Cochrane Library, PsycINFO, Embase, CINAHL, Scopus and Web of Science) and grey literature in addition to hand-searching of reference lists and key journals. Two authors will independently screen titles and abstracts of search results followed by full-texts review against eligibility criteria.

It is found in 8.4% of patients presenting as acute stroke. Treatment is difficult and recurrence rates are high. We introduced hypnotherapy as a therapeutic option in addition to standard stroke unit care. METHODS: This is an observational study of successive patients with functional neurological disorder presenting as acute stroke treated with hypnotherapy between 1 April 2014 and 1 February 2018. The diagnosis of functional neurological disorder was confirmed by clinical examination and computed tomography/magnetic resonance imaging. Hypnosis was delivered by a hypnotherapy trained stroke physician using imagery for induction. A positive response was defined as a National Institutes of Health Stroke score reduction to 0 or by ≥4 points posthypnotherapy. Costs were calculated as therapist time and benefits as reduction in disability/bed days. RESULTS: Sixty-eight patients (mean age 36.4 years, 52 (76%) females, mean baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke 5.0 (range 1-9)) were included. Two patients (3%) could not be hypnotized. Fifty-eight 58 (85%) responded, 47 (81%) required one treatment session, while 19% needed up to three sessions for symptomatic improvement. No adverse events were observed. Disability (modified Rankin Scale) reduced from a mean of 2.3 to 0.5 resulting in an average cost saving of £1,658 per patient. Most (n = 50, 86%) remained well without recurrence at six-month follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: In this case series, hypnotherapy was associated with rapid and sustained recovery of symptoms. A prospective randomized controlled study is required to confirm the findings and establish generalizability of the results.",

This study examines the impact of hypnotherapy delivery and participant characteristics on IBS outcomes. METHODS: This systematic review searched CINAHL, Cochrane Library, Conference Citation Index, Embase, PubMed, PsycARTICLES, PsychINFO, Science Citation index-expanded, Social Science Citation Index. Titles and abstracts, then full-text articles were screened against inclusion criteria: trials with a concurrent comparator of hypnotherapy in adults with IBS diagnosed using Manning or ROME criteria, which provided symptom data. Included studies were extracted and assessed for bias using Cochrane Collaboration 2011 guidance. Random-effects meta-analysis was conducted with sub-group analysis to assess the impact of delivery characteristics on outcomes. RESULTS: Twelve trials were included, 7 in the meta-analyses. Hypnotherapy reduced the risk of GGS, but this was not statistically significant, (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.24, [-0.06, 0.54], I2 66 %). Higher frequency of sessions (≥1/week) reduced GGS (SMD 0.45 [0.23,0.67] I2 0 %), as did higher volumes of intervention (≥8 sessions with ≥6 h of contact) (SMD 0.51 [0.27,0.76] I2 0 %) and group interventions (SMD 0.45 [0.03, 0.88] I2 62 %). Only volume of intervention produced a significant effect between the subgroups. CONCLUSION: This review suggests that high volume hypnotherapy is more beneficial than low and should be adopted for GDH. Both high frequency and group interventions are effective in reducing GGS in IBS. However, the sample size is small and more studies are needed to confirm this.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Many inflammatory bowel disease [IBD] patients in remission have persisting symptoms, compatible with irritable bowel syndrome [IBS-type symptoms]. We aimed to compare the effectiveness of gut-directed hypnotherapy vs standard medical treatment [SMT] for IBS-type symptoms in IBD patients. METHODS: In this multicentre, randomized, controlled, open-label trial, patients aged 12-65 years with IBD in clinical remission [global assessment] and biochemical remission [faecal calprotectin ≤100 µg/g, or ≤200 µg/g without inflammation at endoscopy] with IBS according to Rome III criteria were randomized to hypnotherapy or SMT. Primary outcome was the proportion with ≥50% reduction on a visual analog scale for symptom severity, as measured with the Irritable Bowel Syndrome Severity Scoring System [IBS-SSS] at week 40 [i.e. 6 months after finishing the intervention], compared to baseline. Secondary outcomes included total IBS-SSS score, quality of life, adequate relief, IBS-related cognitions, and depression and anxiety scores. RESULTS: Eighty patients were included, of whom 70 received at least one session of the allocated treatment and were included in the modified intention-to-treat-population. Seven patients were excluded because of missing baseline data required for the primary outcome. The primary outcome was met in nine [27%] of 33 patients randomized to SMT and nine [30%] of 30 patients randomized to hypnotherapy [p = 0.81]. Adequate relief was reported in 60% and 40% of subjects, respectively. Exploratory analyses of secondary outcomes revealed no apparent differences between the two treatment groups. CONCLUSIONS: Hypnotherapy was not superior to SMT in the treatment of IBS-type symptoms in IBD patients. Both treatment strategies are reasonable options from a clinical perspective.",

      "abstract": "Obesity and overweight problems are serious global health issues today and despite many efforts, the prevalence has continued to rise for decades. Interestingly, hypnotherapy has been gaining recognition as an effective treatment for obesity and overweight problems. This review compiles contemporary scientific research on the effectiveness of hypnotherapy for weight reduction. Scopus, PubMed and EBSCO Host databases were applied in the study. The search identified 119 articles, of which seven met the inclusion criteria. A total of 539 respondents (82.7% women and 17.3% men) between the ages of 17 and 67 years were represented in the seven studies. Most studies incorporated lifestyle changes, such as changes of dietary habit and behavioral recommendations in the hypnotic procedure. Their results suggested that the use of hypnotherapy not only promoted weight reduction during the treatment period but also after treatment cessation, and in some cases, one to ten kilograms were lost during follow-up periods. In addition, one study even showed increased physical activity among the hypnotised individuals. This use of hypnotherapy also improved respondents' eating behavior and quality of life. However, a definitive conclusion could not be drawn due to several methodological flaws and the limited number of published studies in this area. Therefore, further well-designed studies are needed to substantiate the effectiveness of hypnotherapy for this modern-day health problem.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Prior study of patients with urgency urinary incontinence by functional magnetic resonance imaging showed altered function in areas of the brain associated with interoception and salience and with attention. Our randomized controlled trial of hypnotherapy for urgency urinary incontinence demonstrated marked improvement in urgency urinary incontinence symptoms at 2 months. A subsample of these women with urgency urinary incontinence underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging before and after treatment. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to determine if hypnotherapy treatment of urgency urinary incontinence compared with pharmacotherapy was associated with altered brain activation or resting connectivity on functional magnetic resonance imaging. STUDY DESIGN: A subsample of women participating in a randomized controlled trial comparing hypnotherapy vs pharmacotherapy for treatment of urgency urinary incontinence was evaluated with functional magnetic resonance imaging. Scans were obtained pretreatment and 8 to 12 weeks after treatment initiation. Brain activation during bladder filling and resting functional connectivity with an empty and partially filled bladder were assessed. Brain regions of interest were derived from those previously showing differences between healthy controls and participants with untreated urgency urinary incontinence in our prior work and included regions in the interoceptive and salience, ventral attentional, and dorsal attentional networks. RESULTS: After treatment, participants in both groups demonstrated marked improvement in incontinence episodes (P<.001). Bladder-filling task functional magnetic resonance imaging data from the combined groups (n=64, 30 hypnotherapy, 34 pharmacotherapy) demonstrated decreased activation of the left temporoparietal junction, a component of the ventral attentional network (P<.01) compared with baseline. Resting functional connectivity differed only with the bladder partially filled (n=54). Compared with pharmacotherapy, hypnotherapy participants manifested increased functional connectivity between the anterior cingulate cortex and the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, a component of the dorsal attentional network (P<.001). CONCLUSION: Successful treatment of urgency urinary incontinence with both pharmacotherapy and hypnotherapy was associated with decreased activation of the ventral (bottom-up) attentional network during bladder filling. This may be attributable to decreased afferent stimuli arising from the bladder in the pharmacotherapy group. In contrast, decreased ventral attentional network activation associated with hypnotherapy may be mediated by the counterbalancing effects of the dorsal (top-down) attentional network.",

      "abstract": "Objective: This study aimed to investigate effects of hypnotherapy on weight loss and thus on leptin, adiponectin (ADP), and irisin levels in obese patients who presented to the psychiatry outpatient clinic to participate in hypnotherapy sessions to develop a healthy and balanced diet. Methods: The study sample included 32 individuals with a body mass index (BMI) of ≥30 and who completed the 10-week hypnotherapy. First, the Personal Information Form was handed out to the participants and then each participant's weight (in the morning on an empty stomach) and height were measured and BMI was determined. Five-milliliter blood samples were drawn before the first session, and then irisin, leptin, and ADP levels were measured using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method. Then, they participated in hypnotherapy sessions once a week for 10 weeks. At the end of the 10-week hypnotherapy, 5 mL of blood was taken again and the aforementioned biochemical analyses were performed. BMIs were measured again. Results: The mean BMI values of the patients were 33.43 ± 5.28 and 31.45 ± 4.98 at the beginning and end of the hypnotherapy sessions, respectively. Serum leptin, ADP, and irisin levels, which were 9.48 ± 5.48, 6.73 ± 3.27, and 1.43 ± 1.14, respectively, at the beginning of the hypnotherapy sessions, were 6.47 ± 2.69, 7.68 ± 3.34, and 1.53 ± 1.21, respectively, at the end of the hypnotherapy sessions. The results showed that BMI and serum leptin levels decreased significantly after the hypnotherapy sessions, whereas serum ADP and irisin levels increased significantly. Conclusions: This study indicates that hypnotherapy in obesity treatment leads to weight loss in obese patients and thus to considerable changes in leptin, ADP, and irisin levels. Hypnotherapy is easy to apply, cheap, and effective; has no potential for side effects; and can be applied both alone and in combination with other treatments. However, to confirm its effects, further studies should be conducted on this issue.",

Dr. Erickson's assessment was brief, just long enough to determine a general target. He used hypnotic induction to build responsiveness. He used evocative communication. He seeded ideas that, when presented later, had a powerful impact. He moved in small, strategic steps. The main intervention was designed to elicit dormant resources and adaptive states. He followed through, providing suggestions on how to use these resources. In presenting this case and our analysis of it, we highlight some of Dr. Erickson's methods and conceptualization of several intervention techniques.",

One of the common ways to cope with grief is alcohol or substance intake. The course and resolution of grief vary depending upon many factors. Hypnotherapy has been useful and effective in addressing grief reactions as well as associated manifestation, such as sleep problems, depressive features, or post-traumatic stress disorder. It might be a good choice of treatment while dealing with patients having underlying issues or maladaptive coping mechanisms. This is a single case study design hypothesized to indicate maladaptive coping of increased alcohol consumption to deal with the death of a young son. The case had been treated as alcohol dependent syndrome with multiple hospitalizations without addressing underlying grief. The treatment approach was changed, and grief was addressed using hypnotherapy. Clinical hypnotherapy helped address grief and facilitated the index case to accept the loss. This resulted in minimizing hospitalizations, abstinence and improved day-to-day functioning along with the use of adaptive mechanisms to cope with the loss. Clinical hypnotherapy is an effective intervention to deal with underlying conflicts or issues that may not be addressed directly in a therapy setting."

It illustrates the effectiveness of two methods of treatment integrated to make better prognosis in the treatment of a depressed Pakistani housewife aged 25 years, who had been suffering for a year. The sessions included hypnotic induction, teaching self-hypnosis with positive suggestions, mood monitoring, use of imagery and relaxation techniques along with specific strategies of brief CBT. Predominant feature of her clinical presentation was the belief of being unloved, and the negative thoughts of being devalued by the husband. Hypnotherapy contributed to achieving remarkable therapeutic progress in a relatively short time. At initial presentation, the depressive symptoms were extremely high as demonstrated by psychological assessment tests and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). Subsequent test results indicated that she had returned to normal level of functioning (81-90) as assessed through the Global Assessment of Functioning Scale (GAFS). At the time of reporting the case, she was in the follow-up phase. The case highlights the value of hypnosis as a tool of empowerment especially important to diminish depression when used as an adjunct with cognitive behaviour therapy.",

In addition to physical problems, the patients suffer from many psychological problems affecting their psychological well-being. The aim of the present study was to determine the effectiveness of group-based cognitive hypnotherapy on the psychological well-being of patients suffering from multiple sclerosis. This study was designed as a clinical trial with a pretest-posttest control group. From 60 patients diagnosed with multiple sclerosis referred to Beheshti hospital in Yasuj, Iran, 45 patients who met the inclusion criteria were selected by the convenience sampling method. The patients were randomly assigned to intervention (23 individuals) and control (22 individuals) groups through stratified random allocation. After completing the Ryff Scales of Psychological Well-Being, the intervention group attended eight sessions of group-based cognitive hypnotherapy on a weekly basis. The control group did not attend any intervention sessions. At the end of the eight intervention sessions, both groups completed the Ryff's Scale of Psychological Well-being again. The collected data were analyzed using the SPSS software (Version 23). Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) and two-way Analysis of variance (ANOVA) tests were used in order to compare the groups. The results indicated that cognitive hypnotherapy had a significant effect on the total score of psychological well-being (F (45, 1) = 6.07, p = .018, η2 = 0.12) and the dimension of environmental mastery (p < .05). Therefore, it is recommended to use hypnotherapy to promote the psychological well-being of patients suffering from multiple sclerosis.",

However, patients who are awake during the TAVI procedure can experience stress, anxiety, and pain, even when LACS is used. Clinical hypnotherapy is an anxiolytic intervention that can be beneficial for patients undergoing invasive surgery. This study aimed to assess the perioperative outcomes of adjunctive hypnotherapy undergoing transfemoral TAVI with LACS.Consecutive patients (n = 143) with symptomatic severe aortic stenosis who underwent transfemoral TAVI with LACS only (n = 107) or with LACS and hypnotherapy (n = 36) between January 2015 and April 2016 were retrospectively included in the study. The clinical outcomes were compared between the two groups. The LACS with hypnotherapy group had a significantly shorter length of stay in the intensive care unit (ICU; LACS only versus LACS with hypnotherapy: 4.0 (4.0-5.5) days versus 3.0 (3.0-5.0) days, P < 0.01). Moreover, the use of anesthetics (propofol and remifentanil) and norepinephrine was significantly lower in the LACS with hypnotherapy group (e.g., for propofol, LACS only versus LACS with hypnotherapy: 96.4 ± 104.7 mg versus 15.0 ± 31.8 mg, P < 0.001). The multiple regression analysis showed that being male, hypnotherapy, and the composite complication score were independently associated with the length of stay in the ICU.The adjunctive hypnotherapy on LACS among transfemoral TAVI patients may facilitate perioperative management. However, a prospective randomized study is necessary to confirm the efficacy of hypnotherapy among TAVI patients.",

Hypnotherapy is a penetration of the critical factors of the conscious mind, followed by the acceptance of a suggestion/idea or thought that causes changes in the behaviour of the mental-emotional order. CASE REPORT: We got a case of anxiety disorder that could be cured with hypnotherapy treatment. A 45-year-old male from Batak tribe with complaints of feeling anxious and not cured because the sufferer always thinks his disease, inflammation of the stomach. Often, the anxiety arose when the patient felt weak, and the heart palpitated as he in dying condition.

One of the main unified mind-body healing practices, which has a great remedial potential in different applications of health care like labor and delivery. Assessment of effectiveness of this procedure in various administered trials is not easy, due to methodologic challenges, like normalizing trial conditions and picking up sufficient sizes of sample. Applying techniques of hypnosis for childbirth within hospital settings makes women to easily overcome barriers associated with institutional policies or caregiver resistance. Potential analgesic and anxiolytic clinical hypnosis effects for childbirth deserve more clinical trials. In this regard, nurses who manage women pending labor and delivery could easily enhance their skills and related understandings for contributing to techniques of hypnotherapy."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Urgency urinary incontinence afflicts many adults, and most commonly affects women. Medications, a standard treatment, may be poorly tolerated, with poor adherence. This warrants investigation of alternative interventions. Mind-body therapies such as hypnotherapy may offer additional treatment options for individuals with urgency urinary incontinence. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate hypnotherapy's efficacy compared to medications in treating women with urgency urinary incontinence. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This investigator-masked, noninferiority trial compared hypnotherapy to medications at an academic center in the southwestern United States, and randomized women with non-neurogenic urgency urinary incontinence to weekly hypnotherapy sessions for 2 months (and continued self-hypnosis thereafter) or to medication and weekly counseling for 2 months (and medication alone thereafter). The primary outcome was the between-group comparison of percent change in urgency incontinence on a 3-day bladder diary at 2 months. Important secondary outcomes were between-group comparisons of percent change in urgency incontinence at 6 and 12 months. Outcomes were analyzed based on noninferiority margins of 5% for between group differences (P < 0.025) (that is, for between group difference in percentage change in urgency incontinence, if the lower bound of the 95% confidence interval was greater than -5%, noninferiority would be proved). RESULTS: A total of 152 women were randomized to treatment between April 2013 and October 2016. Of these women, 142 (70 hypnotherapy, 72 medications) had 3-day diary information at 2 months and were included in the primary outcome analysis. Secondary outcomes were analyzed for women with diary data at the 6-month and then 12-month time points (138 women [67 hypnotherapy, 71 medications] at 6 months, 140 women [69 hypnotherapy, 71 medications] at 12 months. There were no differences between groups' urgency incontinence episodes at baseline: median (quartile 1, quartile 3) for hypnotherapy was 8 (4, 14) and medication was 7 (4, 11) (P = .165). For the primary outcome, although both interventions showed improvement, hypnotherapy did not prove noninferior to medication at 2 months. Hypnotherapy's median percent improvement was 73.0% (95% confidence interval, 60.0-88˖9%), whereas medication's improvement was 88.6% (95% confidence interval, 78.6-100.0%). The median difference in percent change between groups was 0% (95% confidence interval, -16.7% to 0.0%); because the lower margin of the confidence interval did not meet the predetermined noninferiority margin of greater than -5%, hypnotherapy did not prove noninferior to medication. In contrast, hypnotherapy was noninferior to medication for the secondary outcomes at 6 months (hypnotherapy, 85.7% improvement, 95% confidence interval, 75.0-100%; medications, 83.3% improvement, 95% confidence interval, 64.7-100%; median difference in percent change between groups of 0%, 95% confidence interval, 0.0-6.7%) and 12 months (hypnotherapy, 85.7% improvement, 95% confidence interval, 66.7-94.4%; medications, 80% improvement, 95% confidence interval, 54.5-100%; median difference in percent change between groups of 0%, 95% confidence interval, -4.2% to -9.5%). CONCLUSION: Both hypnotherapy and medications were associated with substantially improved urgency urinary incontinence at all follow-up. The study did not prove the noninferiority of hypnotherapy compared to medications at 2 months, the study's primary outcome. Hypnotherapy proved noninferior to medications at longer-term follow-up of 6 and 12 months. Hypnotherapy is a promising, alternative treatment for women with UUI.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Functional dyspepsia (FD) is one of the most frequent functional gastrointestinal disorders and is defined using the Rome IV criteria as any combination of the following symptoms: postprandial fullness, early satiety, epigastric pain, and epigastric burning that are severe enough to interfere with the usual activities and occur at least 3 days per week over the past 3 months with an onset of at least 6 months before the presentation. The purpose of this systematic review is to analyze all the relevant studies in the literature that investigate the efficiency of hypnotherapy in FD. AREAS OF UNCERTAINTY: FD refractory to conservative treatment is a therapeutic challenge, and alternative treatment options are needed. Gut-oriented hypnotherapy has been reported an effective treatment for irritable bowel syndrome, but poorly tested in FD. DATA SOURCES: We performed a search in 6 bibliographic databases (PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Scopus, and LILACS) using customized search strategies for each engine. The search strategy included the following terms: (hypnosis, hypnotherapy, hypnotherapies, hypnogenesis, hypnotism, hypnotist, hypnotical suggestion, suggestion, and mesmerism) and {[functional and (dyspepsia or dyspeptic)] or FD}. RESULTS: Taking the aforementioned criteria into account, the result was a review of 4 articles analyzing the efficacy of hypnotherapy in the treatment of FD, published in the past 20 years. The initial search identified 398 articles, of which 37 potentially appropriate articles were reviewed. Of these 37 articles, 4 articles were included in the review. The benefits observed by numerous studies go beyond the field of digestive pathology, patients describing a general improvement in physical and mental health. CONCLUSIONS: Current studies analyzing the efficacy of hypnotherapy in FD provide encouraging data, but additional randomized controlled trials are needed before a firm position on the effectiveness of hypnosis in FD.",
