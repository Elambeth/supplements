      "abstract": "Metabolic syndrome (MetS) constitutes a spectrum of interconnected conditions comprising obesity, dyslipidemia, hypertension, and insulin resistance (IR). While a singular, all-encompassing treatment for MetS remains elusive, an integrative approach involving tailored lifestyle modifications and emerging functional food therapies holds promise in preventing its multifaceted manifestations. Our main objective was to scrutinize the efficacy of cranberry proanthocyanidins (PAC, 200 mg/kg/day for 12 weeks) in mitigating MetS pathophysiology in male mice subjected to standard Chow or high-fat/high-fructose (HFHF) diets while unravelling intricate mechanisms. The administration of PAC, in conjunction with an HFHF diet, significantly averted obesity, evidenced by reductions in body weight, adiposity across various fat depots, and adipocyte hypertrophy. Similarly, PAC prevented HFHF-induced hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia while also lessening IR. Furthermore, PAC proved effective in alleviating key risk factors associated with cardiovascular diseases by diminishing plasma saturated fatty acids, as well as levels of triglycerides, cholesterol, and non-HDL-C levels. The rise in adiponectin and drop in circulating levels of inflammatory markers showcased PAC's protective role against inflammation. To better clarify the mechanisms behind PAC actions, gut-liver axis parameters were examined, showing significant enhancements in gut microbiota composition, microbiota-derived metabolites, and marked reductions in intestinal and hepatic inflammation, liver steatosis, and key biomarkers associated with endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and lipid metabolism. This study enhances our understanding of the complex mechanisms underlying the development of MetS and provides valuable insights into how PAC may alleviate cardiometabolic dysfunction in HFHF mice."

      "abstract": "Background: The collection of microorganisms that colonize the human genital and urinary tract is referred to as the genitourinary microbiome. Urinary tract infections (UTIs), which predominantly affect women, are linked to alterations in the genitourinary microbiome. Cranberries (Vaccinium oxycoccos), rich in proanthocyanidins, and ascorbic acid (vitamin C), known for their urinary acidification properties, are commonly used for UTI prevention. However, their effects on the genitourinary microbiome remain inadequately characterized. This pilot study assesses the genitourinary microbiome composition in healthy women and evaluates the influence of cranberry and ascorbic acid supplementation. Methods: In a randomized, controlled, and open-label trial, 27 healthy women in their reproductive age (18-40 years) were assigned to three groups: cranberry (n = 8), ascorbic acid (n = 10), and control (n = 9). Urine samples were collected at three time points and processed for 16S rRNA gene amplicon-based microbial community composition analysis. Microbiome composition was compared within and between groups, and between study visits. Results: Sufficient microbial DNA was extracted from all midstream urine samples. The genitourinary microbiome was predominantly composed of Lactobacillus spp., as reported previously. No significant shifts in microbial composition were observed in response to cranberry or ascorbic acid supplementation, and no statistically significant differences were detected between the intervention and control groups or between study visits. Conclusion: The genitourinary microbiome of healthy women remained stable during cranberry or ascorbic acid supplementation. Further studies in patients with recurrent UTIs are needed to explore the potential impacts of these supplements on the genitourinary microbiome in disease states."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Complete dentures play an important role in restoring oral function and aesthetics, yet they may contribute to denture stomatitis, necessitating improved materials and hygiene practices. Cranberry extract, known for its antifungal properties, presents a promising avenue for preventing stomatitis when incorporated into novel denture materials. AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: This research aimed to assess the efficiency of cranberry extract-infused stereolithography (SLA) 3D-printable resins in preventing denture-induced stomatitis and compare their mechanical properties with conventional heat-cured denture base polymers. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifteen patients aged 45 to 60 with completely edentulous maxillary and mandibular arches received two sets of dentures: control dentures made from heat-activated polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) and treatment dentures made from cranberry-infused 3D-printed resin. Candidal colony-forming units (CFUs) and confocal microscopy were used to assess biofilm formation on 30 samples. For the evaluation of mechanical properties, 30 samples were made in each group, and the flexural strength and fracture toughness were examined for both the control and test groups. RESULTS: Significantly fewer CFUs were observed in 3D-printed dentures compared to PMMA dentures at 104 concentrations (p=0.03). Biofilm thickness was significantly lower in 3D-printed dentures (p=0.039), but volume fraction biofilm exhibited no discernible change (p>0.05). Surface coverage was significantly reduced in 3D-printed dentures (p=0.028). Flexural strength was higher in 3D-printed samples (124.25±2.67 MPa) compared to PMMA (109.76±9.35 MPa), with a statistically significant difference. Fracture toughness was also significantly higher in 3D-printed dentures (1.60±0.12) compared to PMMA (1.38±0.95) (p=0.028). CONCLUSION: Cranberry-infused 3D-printable resins demonstrate promise in dropping Candida adhesion and biofilm formation, potentially lowering the risk of denture stomatitis. Moreover, these resins exhibit superior mechanical properties compared to conventional denture base polymers, suggesting a potential alternative for prosthodontic applications."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are a global health concern, increasingly complicated by antibiotic resistance. Cranberry-derived bioactive compounds, particularly proanthocyanidins (PACs), have emerged as a promising non-antibiotic strategy for UTI prevention. This review examines their efficacy, mechanisms of action, and the evolving research landscape through bibliometric analysis. METHODS: A comprehensive literature review was conducted to assess the role of cranberry metabolites in UTI prevention, focusing on anti-adhesive and antimicrobial mechanisms. Additionally, a bibliometric analysis of publications from 1962 to 2024 was performed to evaluate research trends, collaboration networks, and thematic developments. RESULTS: Cranberry metabolites, particularly A-type PACs, flavonoids, and phenolic acids, inhibit Escherichia coli adhesion to urothelial cells, reducing UTI recurrence. Gut microbiota-driven transformation of PACs into bioactive metabolites enhances their efficacy, while cranberry oligosaccharides disrupt biofilm formation in high-risk populations. Bibliometric analysis reveals a surge in research interest post-2000, with increasing global collaborations and a focus on clinical applications. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Cranberry bioactives demonstrate significant potential in UTI management, yet variations in formulation, dosage, and metabolic bioavailability present challenges. The growing research interest underscores the need for standardized clinical studies to optimize therapeutic efficacy and establish evidence-based guidelines for their use."

      "abstract": "Cranberry fruit rot (CFR) is a major disease complex that significantly impacts cranberry crops, leading to substantial yield losses. Over the past decade, CFR has become increasingly problematic, particularly in high-yielding and newer cultivars, with reported losses ranging from 50% to 100%. Additionally, the cranberry industry faces increasing restrictions on the use of broad-spectrum fungicides, such as chlorothalonil and mancozeb, necessitating the exploration of alternative management strategies. This study, conducted from 2021 to 2024 at the University of Massachusetts-Amherst Cranberry Station, evaluated novel fungicides from FRAC Groups 7, 9, and 12. The active ingredients-benzovindiflupyr, pydiflumetofen, cyprodinil, and fludioxonil-were tested individually and in combination with azoxystrobin (FRAC 11). The efficacy of these fungicides in reducing CFR incidence and improving yield was assessed on cranberry cultivars 'Demoranville', 'Ben Lear,' and 'Stevens' with applications made at early, mid, and late bloom stages. Significant differences in fruit rot incidence and yield were observed in 2021, 2023 and 2024. Treatments containing pydiflumetofen, pydiflumetofen & fludioxonil, and benzovindiflupyr, when applied in combination with azoxystrobin, consistently resulted in lower rot incidence and higher yields. The treatment containing cyprodinil & fludioxonil plus azoxystrobin, tested only in 2021, also resulted in lower rot incidence and higher yield. These findings highlight the potential of novel fungicides from FRAC Groups 7, 9, and 12 as effective alternatives for CFR management. Their use could diversify the CFR management toolkit, mitigate fungicide resistance, and reduce environmental impacts, addressing the challenges posed by increasing fungicide regulations."

OBJECTIVES: This study investigated the effect of a whole cranberry fruit powder supplement on incidence of culture-confirmed UTI (primary outcome) in females with rUTI history. METHODS: This multicenter, 6-mo, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study enrolled 150 healthy females [18-65 y, body mass index (BMI) >17.5 and <35 kg/m2] with rUTI defined as ≥3 UTIs in the last year or ≤2 UTIs in the last 6 mo, excluding those with >5 UTIs in the last 6 mo. Participants consumed either 1 capsule of 500 mg/d of whole cranberry powder (Pacran) or placebo. Culture-confirmed UTIs (>108cfu/L) were assessed throughout the intervention period at unscheduled clinic visits whenever participants experienced UTI symptoms and at baseline, 3- and 6-mo clinic visits. Symptomatic suspected UTIs were defined as participant-reported UTI-associated symptoms at unscheduled visits. RESULTS: Whole cranberry powder capsules reduced culture-confirmed UTI risk compared with placebo by 52% (adjusted relative risk [RR]: 0.48; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.26, 0.87; P = 0.01); reduced Escherichia coli UTIs (RR: 0.49; 95% CI: 0.24, 1.01; P = 0.05); reduced incidence of UTI with urinary frequency and urgency symptomatology (RR: 0.29; 95% CI:0.13, 0.63; P < 0.01); delayed time to first UTI episode (adjusted hazard ratio [HR]: 0.36; 95% CI: 0.18, 0.74; P = 0.01); and reduced the mean total number of UTIs per participant (adjusted incidence rate ratio IRR: 0.41; 95% CI: 0.21, 0.79; P = 0.01). Significant differences between groups in incidence of symptomatic suspected UTIs and culture-confirmed dysuria were not observed. Exploratory scores for UTI-related female sexual matters, assessed in a subset of sexually active, consenting females, did not differ significantly between groups. No safety concerns were reported. CONCLUSION: This study shows that whole cranberry powder capsules do not impact safety markers and reduce the incidence of culture-confirmed UTI and several other UTI-related outcomes in healthy females with rUTI history. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov asNCT03042273.",

RESULTS: Serum and salivary TAC increased, and salivary MDA decreased in the I3 group compared with the control group. Additionally, serum MDA decreased in the I2 and I3 groups while serum TAC increased. Serum hs-CRP, IL-6, and TNF-α decreased in the I3 group compared with the baseline. Furthermore, serum hs-CRP and IL-6 decreased in the I3 group compared with the control group. After the intervention, PD and CAL significantly reduced in all the groups. CONCLUSION: The consumption of cranberry juice enriched with omega-3 can be helpful as adjuvant therapy with non-surgical periodontal treatment in decreasing serum levels of IL-6 and hs-CRP, as well as serum and salivary levels of MDA while also increasing serum and salivary levels of TAC."

This study aimed to evaluate the ameliorative effects of cranberry (CB) and vitamin C (Vit-C) on PB-induced reproductive toxicity in rats. METHODS: Forty male Wistar rats were divided into five groups. G1 was the negative control, while G2 received PB (160 mg/kg orally) for one month. Groups G3 and G4 received PB followed by CB (500 mg/kg) and Vit-C (27 mg/kg) treatments, respectively. G5 received PB followed by a combined CB and Vit-C regimen. The levels of catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione reduced (GSH), and malondialdehyde (MDA) were determined using standard biochemical assays. Histological changes in testicular tissues were assessed, and caspase-3 expression was quantified via immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: PB exposure increased MDA levels, reduced SOD and CAT activity, and disrupted testicular histology, with elevated caspase-3 expression indicating heightened apoptosis. Treatment with CB or Vit-C significantly restored antioxidant enzyme activities, reduced MDA levels, and ameliorated histological abnormalities. Co-treatment with CB and Vit-C yielded the most pronounced protective effects, including reduced caspase-3 expression and improved testicular structure. CONCLUSION: CB and Vit-C demonstrate significant protective effects against PB-induced testicular toxicity, likely due to their antioxidative and anti-apoptotic properties. Co-administration of these agents offers an effective strategy to mitigate reproductive toxicities associated with prolonged PB use.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Diabetic foot ulcers present a formidable challenge due to colonization by biofilm-forming microorganisms, heightened oxidative stress, and continuous wound maceration caused by excessive exudation. METHODS: To address these issues, we developed a robust, stretchable, electro-conductive, self-healing, antioxidant, and antibiofilm hydrogel. This hydrogel was synthesized through the crosslinking of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and chitosan (CH) with boric acid. To enhance its antimicrobial efficacy, graphene oxide (GO), produced via electrochemical exfoliation in a zinc ion-based electrolyte medium, was incorporated. For optimal antibiofilm performance, GO was functionalized with cranberry (CR) phenolic extracts, forming a graphene oxide-cranberry nanohybrid (GO-CR). RESULTS: The incorporation of GO-CR into the hydrogel significantly improved its stretchability (280% for PVA/CH/GO-CR compared to 200% for PVA/CH). Additionally, the hydrogel demonstrated efficient photothermal conversion under near-infrared (NIR) light, enabling dynamic exudate removal, which is expected to minimize retained exudate between the wound and the dressing, reducing the risk of wound maceration. The hydrogel effectively reduced levels of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced skin inflammation markers, significantly lowering the expression of NLRP3, TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1β by 39.2%, 31.9%, 41%, and 52.3%, respectively. Histopathological and immunohistochemical analyses further confirmed reduced inflammation and enhanced wound healing. CONCLUSION: The PVA/CH/GO-CR hydrogel exhibits multifunctional properties that enhance wound healing ulcers. Its superior mechanical, antibacterial, and anti-inflammatory properties and ability to promote angiogenesis make it a promising candidate for effective wound management in diabetic patients.",

Purpose: To explore the therapeutic effects and the molecular biology mechanism of exosomes derived from Vaccinium macrocarpon Ait (cranberry) (Va-exos) in the treatment of murine HFHS-POF. Methods: The exosomes from cranberry (Va-exos) were isolated, purified and fed to HFHS-POF model mice. The pathological changes in ovaries, livers, intestines were detected by H&E and Masson staining. The 16s rRNA-seq technique was used to investigate the changes in the gut microbiota and microecology. The mRNA and protein expressions of PANoptosis and their phosphorylation levels in ovarian granulosa cells were detected by qPCR and western blot. Results: Pathological examination showed that Va-exos not only significantly alleviated the symptoms of POF in model mice but also improved the intestinal barrier function and inhibited the production of inflammatory factors. The high-throughput sequencing results of 16s rRNA indicated that the relative abundances of Akkermansia and Allobaculum microorganisms in the intestines of the Va-exos group of mice significantly increased, while the relative abundances of uncultured-bacterium_f-Muribaculaceae, Dubosiella, and uncultured-bacterium_f-Lachnospiraceae microorganisms were significantly reduced. The FCM test results indicated that Va-exos significantly reduced necrosis, apoptosis, and accumulation of reactive oxygen species in ovarian granulosa cells (OGCs) of the HFHS POF mice. Finally, both qPCR and western-blot analyses indicated that Va-exos significantly attenuated the expression levels of key regulatory factors in the PANoptosis of OGCs in HFHS POF mice. Conclusion: We confirmed that oral administration of cranberry-derived exosomes attenuated murine POF by modulating the gut microbiota and decreasing ovarian granulosa cell PANoptosis.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Recently, research in the field of caries prevention is emphasizing upon identification of edible non-toxic compounds that can interfere with the formation of cariogenic biofilm. AIM: This trial aimed to assess the effectiveness of non-dialyzable material (NDM) containing cranberry mouth rinse (C-MR) on the Streptococcus mutans (S. mutans) counts and compare with that of a sodium fluoride (F-MR) mouth rinse. METHODS: 280 children (8-12 years old) were enrolled in this double-blind single center, parallel, one-month, IRB/IEC approved non-inferiority trial. The participants fulfilling the inclusion criteria were randomly allocated into one of the two groups: C-MR and F-MR. All participants were given verbal and written instructions about at-home mouth-rinsing regimen under parental supervision for a month. Dental plaque samples were collected before and after a month of mouth-rinsing and subjected to culture techniques. S. mutans counts were assessed and compared in both groups. Primary outcome was the difference in the S. mutans counts between two interventions. Both intention-to-treat (ITT) and per-protocol analysis were carried out using two-sample t test with equal variance. RESULTS: The mean S. mutans counts (after log transformation) in C-MR group were: 14.66 (90% CI 14.4,14.9) at baseline and 12.85 (90% CI 12.5, 13.2) colony-forming units/ml (CFU/ml) at one-month post intervention (p = 0.001); while these counts were 14.69 (90% CI 14.5, 14.9) at baseline and 12.71 (90% CI 12.3, 13.1) at one-month intervention in F-MR groups (p = 0.001). ITT analysis showed an inter- group difference of 0.14 CFU/ml (90% CI - 0.32,0.59) in post-SM counts between groups (p = 0.629). CONCLUSION: The study demonstrated that the cranberry mouth rinse was non-inferior to the fluoride mouth rinse in terms of S. mutans levels change. Cranberry-based mouth rinse can be used effectively to reduce the S. mutans counts in children. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Registration number in case of Clinical Trials-CTRI/2019/05/019395.",

      "abstract": "Cranberry is abundantly rich in anthocyanins, a type of flavonoid with potent antioxidant properties and the resistance against certain diseases. In this study, anthocyanin-rich cranberry extract was extracted, purified, and its components were analyzed. 92.18 % of anthocyanins was obtained and the total content of anthocyanins was 302.62 mg/g after AB-8 resin purification. Quantification analysis showed that the extract mainly contained cyanidin-3-galactoside, procyanidin B2 and procyanidin B4. Then we explored its effects on dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in mice. The supplementation of cranberry extract resulted in an alleviation of IBD symptoms, evidenced by improvements in the disease activity index (DAI), restoration of colon length and colonic morphology. Cranberry extract reversed the elevated iron and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels and restored glutathione (GSH) levels in IBD mice. Further analysis revealed that cranberry modulated ferroptosis-associated genes and reduced expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Although cranberry influenced the intestinal flora balance by reducing Proteobacteria and Escherichia-Shigella, and increasing Lactobacillus, as well as enhancing SCFAs content, these effects were not entirely dependent on intestinal flora modulation, as indicated by antibiotic intervention and fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) experiments. In conclusion, our findings suggest that the beneficial impact of cranberry extract on IBD may primarily involve the regulation of colonic ferroptosis, independent of significant alterations in intestinal flora."

      "abstract": "The treatment of infectious diseases typically includes the administration of anti-infectives; however, the increasing rates of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) have led to attempts to develop other modalities, such as antimicrobial peptides, nanotechnology, bacteriophages, and natural products. Natural products offer a viable alternative due to their potential affordability, ease of access, and diverse biological activities. Flavonoids, a class of natural polyphenols, demonstrate broad anti-infective properties against viruses, bacteria, fungi, and parasites. Their mechanisms of action include disruption of microbial membranes, inhibition of nucleic acid synthesis, and interference with bacterial enzymes. This review explores the potential of natural compounds, such as flavonoids, as an alternative therapeutic approach to combat infectious diseases. Moreover, it discusses some commonly used natural products, such as cranberry and D-mannose, to manage urinary tract infections (UTIs). Cranberry products and D-mannose both, yet differently, inhibit the adhesion of uropathogenic bacteria to the urothelium, thus reducing the likelihood of UTI occurrence. Some studies, with methodological limitations and small patient samples, provide some encouraging results suggesting the use of these substances in the prevention of recurrent UTIs. While further research is needed to determine optimal dosages, bioavailability, and potential side effects, natural compounds hold promise as a complementary or alternative therapeutic strategy in the fight against infectious diseases."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: With over 50% of women suffering from at least one episode of urinary tract infection (UTI) throughout their lifetime and an increasing prevalence of antimicrobial resistance, efforts need to be made to clearly identify the evidence supporting potential non-drug interventions. This study aims to compare the effects of cranberry juice, cranberry tablets, and increased liquids for the management of UTIs. METHODS: PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane CENTRAL were searched for randomised controlled trials. The primary outcome was the number of UTIs, and the secondary outcomes were UTI symptoms and antimicrobial consumption. A risk of bias assessment was performed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool, and the certainty of evidence was assessed using Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation. KEY FINDINGS AND LIMITATIONS: A total of 20 trials (3091 participants) were included, with 18 studies highlighting a 54% lower rate of UTIs with cranberry juice consumption than no treatment and a 27% lower rate than placebo liquid. Cranberry juice also resulted in a 49% lower rate of antibiotic use than placebo liquid and a 59% lower rate than no treatment, based on a network meta-analysis of six studies. The use of cranberry compounds also reduced the prevalence of symptoms associated with UTIs. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: With moderate to low certainty, the evidence supports the use of cranberry juice for the prevention of UTIs. While increased liquids reduce the rate of UTIs compared with no treatment, cranberry in liquid form provides even better clinical outcomes in terms of reduction in UTIs and antibiotic use and should be considered for the management of UTIs. PATIENT SUMMARY: With the increasing prevalence of antimicrobial-resistant UTIs, alternate non-drug treatment options for its management are required. Available evidence supports the use of cranberry compounds and increases in fluid intake for managing UTIs.",

The first years of life provide a window of opportunity to modulate the composition of the oral microbiota and prevent disease. OBJECTIVES: The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of a tablet containing inactivated Ligilactobacillus salivarius CECT 5317 and the cranberry extract on the development of caries in cariesactive preschool children. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study employed a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind design. Preschool children (N = 73) with at least one active carious lesion were enrolled and randomly assigned to the test group or the placebo group. The intervention period was 3 months. Caries was assessed according to the International Caries Detection and Assessment System (ICDAS) II criteria at baseline and after 9 months, and oral hygiene was evaluated with the simplified oral hygiene index (OHI-S). The salivary counts of Streptococcus mutans and Lactobacillus spp. were determined at baseline, and then after 3 and 9 months through the conventional cultivation on TYCSB and MRS agar, respectively. RESULTS: Sixty children completed the trial (a dropout rate of 19%). The baseline caries prevalence was high in both groups (~71%) and there were no major differences between the groups with regard to background variables. The 9-month incidence of initial carious lesions (ICDAS 1+2) was significantly lower in the test group as compared to the placebo group (p < 0.05). The plaque levels, and the salivary counts of S. mutans and Lactobacillus spp. remained unchanged in both groups throughout the study. CONCLUSIONS: A daily intake of a tablet containing a paraprobiotic and the cranberry extract reduced the 9-month incidence of initial non-cavitated carious lesions in caries-active preschool children. The present study is one of the first to show the impact of synbiotics on the development of caries in children.",

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: The aim of this narrative literature review was to summarize evidence regarding bacteriuria and urinary tract infections (UTIs) in patients living with a urinary diversion and the use of cranberry products for the prevention of these infections. METHODS: We searched for articles in the English language and available in full text to address the role of cranberry products in the management of UTIs in those with urinary diversions. We searched the electronic databases of MEDLINE, PubMed, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials between January 2003 and December 2023. Thirty-two elements were read in full and 9 elements that evaluated UTIs and/or the role of cranberries in preventing UTIs are included in this narrative review. RESULTS: Research indicates no significant difference in UTI rates, microbiology, or antibiotic sensitivity and resistance patterns between the different types of urinary diversions (orthoptic diversions, ileal conduit diversions, and continent cutaneous diversions). Similar to persons with an intact urinary tract, Escherichia coli (a prevalent coliform bacteria) was the most prevalent pathogen resulting in symptomatic UTIs. In addition, we found that E. coli strains persisted in urinary diversions involving reconstructed intestinal segments for prolonged periods of time despite antibiotic treatment. We found sparse evidence suggesting that cranberry products are effective for the prevention of UTIs after ileal conduit urinary diversion. CONCLUSIONS: There are inconsistencies in the definition of bacteriuria in the literature making it difficult to compare findings among the studies. Clinical guidance discussing the optimal method for obtaining a urine specimen from a urinary diversion and its management is limited. Research studies on the use of cranberry products to treat UTIs in persons living with a urinary diversion are urgently needed.",

PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus were searched to identify relevant articles published up to December 2023. In total, 3145 publications were reviewed and 16 of them were included for qualitative synthesis and meta-analysis. Stata 15.0 and Review Manager 5.4 were applied for statistical analyses. The results revealed a significant decrease in the total cholesterol to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio (TC/HDL-C) (MD = -0.24; 95% CI: -0.45, -0.04; peffect = 0.02) and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) (MD = -0.59; 95% CI: -1.05, -0.14; peffect = 0.01) with cranberry consumption. However, it did not influence total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), triglyceride (TG), fasting blood glucose (FBG), glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), and fasting insulin. In subgroup analysis, cranberry consumption in dried form (capsules, powder, and tablets) was found to significantly decrease the fasting insulin level (three studies, one hundred sixty-five participants, MD = -2.16; 95% CI: -4.24, -0.07; peffect = 0.04), while intervention duration, health conditions, and dosage of polyphenols and anthocyanins had no impact on blood lipid and glycemic parameters.

The current research was aimed to assess the nephroprotective portion of Vaccinium oxycoccos toward mice diabetic nephropathy induced by streptozotocin (STZ). V. oxycoccos was purchased and used for hydroalcoholic extraction. METHODS: Sixty male mice were subjected to STZ-intraperitoneal injection (45 mg/kg). After diabetes induction, mice were divided into five groups of diabetic control (received only STZ), non-diabetic control (received only citrate buffer), two V. oxycoccos treatment (received V. oxycoccos extract (200 and 400 mg/kg) oral daily by gavage), and metformin treatment (received metformin (500 mg/kg) oral daily by gavage). Glucose and weight of mice were checked weekly. RESULTS: After 28 days, the effect of V. oxycoccos extract on serum and urine parameters were assessed. STZ caused significant decreased in the mice body weight. Mice treated with the V. oxycoccos (400 mg/kg) harbored the lowest weight loss at day 28 (70.2±1.38 g). STZ caused significant increase in the mice FBS. Mice treated with the V. oxycoccos (400 mg/kg) harbored the lowest FBS at day 28 (189.2±1.20 mg/dL). Treatment of mice with V. oxycoccos (400 mg/kg) caused the lowest increase in the levels of cholesterol, HbA1c and triglycerides compared to the diabetic control mice. Compared to the diabetic control group, mice treated with V. oxycoccos (400 mg/kg) had the highest HDL, insulin, SOD, and GSH (p<0.05). The lowest serum BUN, CR, and UR were found in mice treated with V. oxycoccos (400 mg/kg). Anti-inflammatory effects of V. oxycoccos (400 mg/kg) was shown by the lowest TNF-α, IL-6, and TGF-β1 concentration in mice treated with V. oxycoccos (400 mg/kg). CONCLUSIONS: The current study disclosed that treatment with V. oxycoccos resulted in substantial development in the serum and urine parameters and also antioxidant and anti-inflammatory response of STZ-induced diabetic mice.",

This study investigated whether C-PACs' mitigation of bile reflux-induced transporter dysregulation mechanistically contributes to EAC prevention. RNA was isolated from water-, C-PAC- and reflux-exposed rat esophagi with and without C-PAC treatment. Differential gene expression was determined by means of RNA sequencing and RT-PCR, followed by protein assessments. The literature, coupled with the publicly available Gene Expression Omnibus dataset GSE26886, was used to assess transporter expression levels in normal and EAC patient biopsies for translational relevance. Significant changes in ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters implicated in therapeutic resistance in humans (i.e., Abcb1, Abcb4, Abcc1, Abcc3, Abcc4, Abcc6 and Abcc10) and the transport of drugs, xenobiotics, lipids, and bile were altered in the reflux model with C-PACs' mitigating changes. Additionally, C-PACs restored reflux-induced changes in solute carrier (SLC), aquaporin, proton and cation transporters (i.e., Slc2a1, Slc7a11, Slc9a1, Slco2a1 and Atp6v0c). This research supports the suggestion that transporters merit investigation not only for their roles in metabolism and therapeutic resistance, but as targets for cancer prevention and targeting preventive agents in combination with chemotherapeutics."

On days 1, 3, and 7 of the treatment, whether there was a decrease in the complaints was evaluated with a Likert-type scale. The recovery status of urinary tract infections and the well-being of patients were compared via antibiotic and cranberry groups. RESULTS: After the treatment, the leukocyte levels of the cranberry users were at the same level as those of the other group, and the rate of well-being and the portion of patients that reported to be \"very well\" on days 3 and 7 in the cranberry group was significantly higher compared with the fosfomycin group (p<0.05). CONCLUSION: Considering the results of this study, it was determined that the patient's complaints decreased from day 3 and their well-being increased with the use of cranberry only. Specifically, on day 7, the well-being of the cranberry group was higher than that of the fosfomycin group. For this reason, cranberry is a favorable alternative to antibiotics in uncomplicated and simple urinary tract infections.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The main function of the urinary tract is to form an impermeable barrier against urinary solutes and bacteria. However, this barrier can be compromised by urinary tract infections, most commonly caused by uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC). This can result in damage to the epithelial barrier, leading to decreased epithelial thickness, loss of tight junctions, loss of epithelial integrity, and apoptosis. Due to the rise in antimicrobial resistance, there is worldwide interest in exploring non-antibiotic agents as alternative therapy. METHODS: Using the Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cell line, a widely accepted epithelial cell model for the urinary tract, and the UPEC strain UTI89, this paper aimed to investigate the impact of UPEC on cell integrity, permeability, and barrier functions, and determine whether cranberry, D-mannose and ibuprofen could counteract the effects induced by UPEC. Furthermore, the study examined the protective potential of these agents against UPEC-induced increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression. RESULTS: The results demonstrated that UTI89 caused a marked reduction in cell viability and monolayer integrity. Cranberry (3 mg/mL) was protective against these changes. In addition, cranberry exhibited protective effects against UPEC-induced damage to cell barrier integrity, escalation of oxidative stress, and UPEC/TNFα-triggered PD-L1 expression. However, no effect was observed for D-mannose and ibuprofen in alleviating UPEC-induced cell damage and changes in ROS and PD-L1 levels. CONCLUSION: Overall, cranberry, but not D-mannose or ibuprofen, has a protective influence against UPEC associated damage in urinary epithelial cells."

Besides a wide selection of synthetic antidiabetic drugs, various plant-origin extracts are also available to support the treatment of T2DM. This study aimed to investigate and gain knowledge of the chemical composition and potential IR correction effect of American cranberry (Vaccinium macrocarpon Aiton) leaf extracts and formulate novel 3D-printed oral dosage forms for such extracts. The bioactivity and IR of L-arginine-loaded cranberry leaf extracts were studied in vivo in rats. The cranberry leaf extracts consisted of quinic, 3-caffeoylquinic (chlorogenic), p-coumaroylquinic acids, quercetin 3-O-galactoside, quercetin-3-O-glucoside, quercetin-3-xyloside, quercetin-3-O-arabino pyranoside, quercetin-3-O-arabinofuranoside, quercetin 3-O-rhamnoside, and quercetin-O-p-coumaroyl hexoside-2 identified by HPLC. In vivo studies with rats showed that the oral administration of the cranberry leaf extracts had a positive effect on insulin sensitivity coefficients under the insulin tolerance test and affected homeostasis model assessment IR levels and liver lipid content with experimental IR. A novel 3D-printed immediate-release dosage form was developed for the oral administration of cranberry leaf extracts using polyethylene oxide as a carrier gel in semi-solid extrusion 3D printing. In conclusion, American cranberry leaf extracts loaded with L-arginine could find uses in preventing health issues associated with IR."

Circulating (poly)phenol metabolites can act as mediators of these effects, but they are subjected to an extensive inter-individual variability. This study aimed to quantify both plasma and urine (poly)phenol metabolites following a 12-week intake of a cranberry powder in healthy older adults, and to investigate inter-individual differences by considering the existence of urinary metabotypes related to dietary (poly)phenols. Up to 13 and 67 metabolites were quantified in plasma and urine respectively. Cranberry consumption led to changes in plasma metabolites, mainly hydroxycinnamates and hippuric acid. Individual variability in urinary metabolites was assessed using different data sets and a combination of statistical models. Three phenolic metabotypes were identified, colonic metabolism being the main driver for subject clustering. Metabotypes were characterized by quali-quantitative differences in the excretion of some metabolites such as phenyl-γ-valerolactones, hydroxycinnamic acids, and phenylpropanoic acids. Metabotypes were further confirmed when applying a model only focused on flavan-3-ol colonic metabolites. 5-(3',4'-dihydroxyphenyl)-γ-valerolactone derivatives were the most relevant metabolites for metabotyping. Metabotype allocation was well preserved after 12-week intervention. This metabotyping approach for cranberry metabolites represents an innovative step to handle the complexity of (poly)phenol metabolism in free-living conditions, deciphering the existence of metabotypes derived from the simultaneous consumption of different classes of (poly)phenols. These results will help contribute to studying the health effects of cranberries and other (poly)phenol-rich foods, mainly considering gut microbiota-driven individual differences.",

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The polyberry gel was evaluated for various physicochemical parameters, in vitro permeability and stability, and the active phytoconstituents were quantified by High-performance thin layer chromatography (HPTLC). Total phenolic content, total antioxidants, and ascorbic acid were estimated in the two extracts by in vitro assays. Patients suffering from chronic periodontitis with probing pocket depth (PPD) up to 5 mm were divided into 3 groups of 21 patients each and treated with scaling and root planing (SRP) or SRP followed by subgingival placement of polyberry gel or tetracycline fibers (standard). Plaque Index (PI), Gingival Index (GI), PPD, Clinical Attachment Level (CAL), and the salivary aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels were recorded at baseline and after 1 month. RESULTS: A significant (P < 0.01) reduction in the periodontic disease parameters was observed in the standard and gel-treated groups between their baseline and 1-month time-interval readings. The polyberry gel treatment significantly (P < 0.05 for AST and P < 0.01 for the rest) attenuated the periodontitis-elevated PI, GI PPD, CAL, AST and CRP levels when compared with SRP at the end of the study and was comparable with tetracycline. CONCLUSION: The amelioration of periodontitis and gingival inflammation may be attributed to the potent antioxidant activity of the polyphenolic phytoconstituents of the gel. The polyberry gel may thus be used as a safe adjunct to SRP/tetracycline in chronic periodontitis."

MATERIAL AND METHODS: An aggregate of 60 extracted human mandibular molars was gathered and the buccal surface of each specimen was exposed to 2 mm of enamel surface for bleaching with chemical and photoactivated agents with the use of reversal solutions. Specimens were divided into six groups (n = 10) at random- Group 1: samples bleached with 40% HP with 10% ascorbic acid (reversal agent), group 2: ZP activated by PDT with 10% ascorbic acid (reversal agent), group 3: 40% HP with 6% cranberry solution as a reversal agent, group 4: ZP activated by PDT with 6% cranberry solution, group 5: 40% HP and group 6: ZP activated by PDT with no reversal agents. Resin cement restoration was performed via etch and rinse technique and SBS was estimated by using the universal testing machine, SMH by using Vickers hardness tester, and Ra by stylus profilometer. Statistical analysis was executed using the ANOVA test and the Tukey multiple tests (p<0.05). RESULTS: Enamel surface bleached with 40% HP reversed with 10% ascorbic acid displayed the highest SBS while 40% HP with no reversal agent use showed the least SBS. For SMH, ZP activated by PDT when applied on the enamel surface and reversed with 10% ascorbic acid showed the highest SMH while when bleached with 40% HP and reversed with 6% cranberry solution showed the least SMH value. For Ra, Group 3: samples bleached with 40% HP with 6% cranberry solution as reversal agent showed the highest Ra value while bleaching of enamel surface with ZP activated by PDT with 6% cranberry displayed the least Ra value. CONCLUSION: Bleached enamel surface with Zinc Phthalocyanine activated by PDT with the application of 10% ascorbic acid as reversal solution has demonstrated the highest SBS and SMH with acceptable surface roughness for bonding adhesive resin to the enamel surface.",

Measurements were collected from ewes (BW, BCS, and milk) and lambs (BW and body size). Milk from CVP ewes exhibited reduced milk fat and solids (p < 0.01) and increased concentrations of milk urea nitrogen (p = 0.02) when evaluated for the treatment-time. There was no significant difference in the BCS, protein, lamb BW, or growth measurements for treatment-time (p ≥ 0.05).

The most common treatment approach involves the use of antibiotics, although this solution is not always the most suitable, mainly because of the resistance that bacterial strains develop. Proanthocyanidins are a class of polyphenols, abundantly contained in cranberry extracts, which have shown beneficial effects in the treatment of urinary tract infections, due to their anti-adhesive properties toward bacteria, with respect to the membranes of the cells of the urothelium and intestine, thus reducing their virulence. In this work, we demonstrate via microscopy and scattering measurements how a mixture of cranberry and chondroitin sulfate can form a crosslinked structure with barrier properties. By using a design of experiment (DOE), we optimized the mass ratio to obtain a precipitate between cranberry extract and chondroitin sulfate in the presence of N-acetylcysteine and hyaluronic acid. By using transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) chambers, we confirmed the barrier properties of the best mixture obtained with the DOE. Lastly, the antibiofilm action was investigated against five strains of Escherichia coli with different antibiotic sensitivity. The precipitate displayed a variable inhibitory effect in biofilm formation with major effects in UTI with an antibiotic resistance profile."

Cranberries contain many rich bioactive components that may help fight cancer. The action of cranberry against some cancer types has been reported, however, its role in lung cancer has only been investigated in large-cell lung cancer. In this study, we expanded current research on the role of cranberry in LUAD. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A549 LUAD cancer cells were treated with commercial cranberry extract (CE). Proliferation of A549 cells was measured with a clonogenic survival assay and quick proliferation assay. Caspase-3 activity was used to evaluate apoptosis of A549 cells. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction was conducted to investigate the possible molecular mechanisms involved in the action of CE. RESULTS: Treatment of LUAD with CE reduced the percentage of A549 colonies. This was consistent with the decrease in the optic density of cancer cells after treatment with CE. Caspase-3 activity increased after treatment with CE. The anti-proliferative effect of CE on A549 cells correlated with reduced expression of pro-proliferation molecules cyclin E, cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2) and CDK4. The pro-apoptotic effect of CE on A549 cells correlated with the reduced expression of the anti-apoptotic molecule caspase 8 and FADD-like apoptosis regulator (FLIP). CONCLUSION: CE had an inhibitory effect on the growth of LUAD cells by modulation of both pro-proliferative and anti-apoptotic molecules. Our research hopes to guide future treatment options for LUAD.",

      "abstract": "Gut dysbiosis is common in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and is associated with uremic toxin production, inflammation, oxidative stress, and cardiovascular disease development. Therefore, healthy dietary patterns are essential modulators of gut microbiota. In this context, studies suggest that consuming berry fruits, rich in polyphenols and nutrients, may positively affect the gut microbiota, promoting the selective growth of beneficial bacteria and improving clinical status. However, studies on the effects of berry fruits on gut microbiota in CKD are scarce, and a better understanding of the possible mechanisms of action of berry fruits on gut microbiota is needed to guide future clinical studies and clinical practice in CKD. The objective was to discuss how berry fruits (blueberry, cranberry, raspberry, and strawberry) could be a therapeutic strategy to modulate the gut microbiota and possibly reverse the dysbiosis in CKD. Overall, available evidence shows that berry fruits can promote an increase in diversity by affecting the abundance of mucus-producing bacteria and short-chain fatty acids. Moreover, these fruits can increase the expression of mRNA involved in tight junctions in the gut such as occludin, tight junction protein 1 (TJP1), and mucin. Studies on the exact amount of berries leading to these effects show heterogeneous findings. However, it is known that, with 5 mg/day, it is already possible to observe some effects in animal models. Wild berries could possibly improve the uremic condition by reducing the levels of uremic toxins via modulation of the gut microbiota. In the long term, this could be an excellent strategy for patients with CKD. Therefore, clinical studies are encouraged to evaluate better these effects on CKD as well as the safe amount of these fruits in order to promote a better quality of life or even the survival of these patients.",

This growing challenge mandates the development of other future curative directions. The purpose of the present study is to investigate the efficacy of cranberry proanthocyanidins (PACs) in improving MetS pathological conditions and liver complications; C57BL/6J mice were fed either a standard chow or a high fat/high sucrose (HFHS) diet with and without PACs (200 mg/kg), delivered by daily gavage for 12 weeks. Our results show that PACs lowered HFHS-induced obesity, insulin resistance, and hyperlipidemia. In conjunction, PACs lessened circulatory markers of oxidative stress (OxS) and inflammation. Similarly, the anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory capacities of PACs were noted in the liver in association with improved hepatic steatosis. Inhibition of lipogenesis and stimulation of beta-oxidation could account for PACs-mediated decline of fatty liver as evidenced not only by the expression of rate-limiting enzymes but also by the status of AMPKα (the key sensor of cellular energy) and the powerful transcription factors (PPARα, PGC1α, SREBP1c, ChREBP). Likewise, treatment with PACs resulted in the downregulation of critical enzymes of liver gluconeogenesis, a process contributing to increased rates of glucose production in type 2 diabetes. Our findings demonstrate that PACs prevented obesity and improved insulin resistance likely via suppression of OxS and inflammation while diminishing hyperlipidemia and fatty liver disease, as clear evidence for their strength of fighting the cluster of MetS abnormalities."

Discriminant biomarkers in urine may explain urinary tract infection (UTI) preventive activities. We hypothesized that validated and annotated discriminant metabolites in human urine could be used as intake biomarkers in building predictive multivariate models to classify cranberry consumers. Urine samples were collected from 16 healthy women aged 18 to 29 years at baseline and after 3- and 21-day consumption of cranberry or placebo juice in a double-blind, crossover study. Urine metabolomes were analyzed using ultra high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with Orbitrap mass spectrometry. Paired and unpaired multivariate analyses were used to annotate or identify discriminant metabolic features after cranberry consumption. Twenty-six discriminant metabolic features (paired analysis) and 27 (unpaired analysis) after cranberry consumption in an open-label intervention were rediscovered in the blinded study. These metabolites included exogenous (quinic acid) and endogenous ones (hippuric acid). The paired analysis showed better model fitting with partial least-square discriminant analysis models built on all metabolites than the unpaired analysis. Predictive models built on shared metabolites by the unpaired analysis were able to classify cranberry juice consumers with 84.4% to 100% correction rates, overall better than the paired analysis (50%-100%). The double-blind study validated discriminant metabolites from a previous open-label study. These urinary metabolites may be associated with the ability of cranberries to prevent UTIs and serve as potential cranberry intake biomarkers. It reveals the importance of selecting the right predictive models to classify cranberry consumers with higher than 95% correction rates.",

      "abstract": "The use of antibiotics in the treatment of UTIs is contributing to resistance. Hence, the outcome of human clinical trials of nonantibiotic remedies for preventing or treating UTI is of significant interest. This systematic review aimed to identify, summarise and evaluate the evidence for the outcomes of different nonantibiotic options including cranberry, D-mannose and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). PubMed, Embase and Scopus were searched for manuscripts relating to nonantibiotic treatment of UTI including cranberry, mannose and NSAIDs. After title and abstract screening, data were extracted from 21 papers that were published in English and related to the treatment or prevention of uncomplicated UTI in adult women. We identified twelve papers examining the effects of cranberry, two papers examining D-mannose, two papers examining combination treatments (cranberry and D-mannose) and five manuscripts investigating the effects of NSAIDs. There is low-level evidence, from a small number of studies, supporting the use of D-mannose or combination treatments for potentially preventing UTIs in adult women without producing burdening side effects. However, larger and more randomised double-blinded trials are needed to confirm this. In comparison, the multiple studies of cranberry and NSAIDs produced conflicting evidence regarding their effectiveness."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a polygenic metabolic disease, characterized by high fasting blood glucose (FBG). The ability of cranberry (CRN) fruit to regulate glycemia in T2D patients is well known. Here, a cohort of 13 lines of the genetically diverse Collaborative Cross (CC) mouse model was assessed for the effect of non-dialyzable material (NDM) of cranberry extract in lowering fasting blood glucose. METHODS: Eight-week-old mice were maintained on either a standard chow diet (control group) or a high-fat diet (HFD) for 12 weeks, followed by injections of intraperitoneal (IP) NDM (50 mg/kg) per mouse, three times a week for the next 6 weeks. Absolute FBG (mg/dl) was measured bi-weekly and percentage changes in FBG (%FBG) between weeks 0 and 12 were calculated. RESULTS: Statistical analysis showed a significant decrease in FBG between weeks 0 and 12 in male and female mice maintained on CHD. However, a non-significant increase in FBG values was observed in male and female mice maintained on HFD during the same period. Following administration of NDM during the following 6 weeks, the results show a variation in significant levels of FBG lowering between lines, male and female mice and under the different diets. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that the efficacy of NDM treatment in lowering FGB depends on host genetic background (pharmacogenetics), sex of the mouse (pharmacosex), and diet (pharmacodiet). All these results support the need for follow-up research to better understand and implement a personalized medicine approach/utilization of NDM for reducing FBG.",

      "abstract": "The oral cavity harbors hundreds of microorganisms that may be uncontrolled and provoke several diseases. In this sense, periodontitis is a complex multifactorial disease with an essential microbial component in its etiology. Periodontal treatment involves mechanical control of the supra- and subgingival biofilm, but not all patients respond predictably to treatment. In this way, the biofilm chemical control helps in the reduction of periodontal pathogens during treatment or in the delay of bacterial re-colonization after scaling and root planning. Several products have been studied as adjunctive therapy and have shown promising results. Therefore, the present article reviews the biological effects of propolis, aloe vera, green tea, cranberry, calendula, myrrha and salvia that may support their use in the control of subgingival biofilm in patients with periodontitis. All the natural products cited above showed exciting results against microorganisms related to oral diseases, mainly periodontitis. These substances also have anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities. The natural agents propolis, aloe vera, green tea, cranberry, calendula, myrrha and salvia demonstrated potential to be used as oral hygiene products, based on their antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory actions."

      "abstract": "The Wisconsin Rapids Wastewater Treatment Plant (WRWWTP) is faced with a more stringent effluent phosphorus requirement that will drive capital investment between 2020 and 2025. The facility will need to achieve a monthly average value of 0.36 mg L-1 of total phosphorus (TP). While the facility has sufficient influent carbon to drive a conventional enhanced biological phosphorus removal (EBPR) configuration, the existing infrastructure makes the addition of influent selector zones cost prohibitive. Underutilized aeration basin capacity was repurposed for testing return activated sludge (RAS) fermentation. The WRWWTP began pilot testing of RAS fermentation in April 2021. The facility moved through a series of operational setpoints to optimize phosphorus removal in a sidestream RAS (SSR) configuration, including RAS diversion, decrease of DO in aeration basins and chemical dosing shutoff. One of the key implementations was the addition of cranberry syrup waste to provide additional carbon for RAS fermentation, converting the process to a SSR plus carbon (SSRC) configuration. By the end of the testing period, effluent total phosphorus was averaging less than 0.4 mg L-1 with no chemical addition. A model was developed in the SUMO platform and was used to capture orthophosphate trends during the testing period. The model investigated microbial population dynamics and found that the operational changes including RAS diversion, chemical dosing shutoff and cranberry syrup waste addition impacted the enrichment of phosphorus accumulating organisms (PAO). After performing a sensitivity analysis on hydrolysis parameters, the predicted hydrolysis rate around 1.8-1.9 mg COD g VSS-1 hr-1 was found to match the batch rate testing data. This is the first study where cranberry syrup waste was used to successfully enhance EBPR performance, resulting in 90% TP removal. While further research is needed regarding the composition of the waste matrix and the microbial community composition, this expands the routes for resource recovery in the field of wastewater treatment.",

In this study, cranberry pomace was hydrolyzed with Viscozyme® L, Pectinex® Ultra Tropical, Pectinex® Yieldmash Plus, and Celluclast® 1.5L (Novozyme A/S, Denmark). The soluble and insoluble dietary fiber was determined using the Megazyme kit, while the changes in mono-, disaccharide and oligosaccharides' contents were determined using HPLC-RI; the total phenolic contents were determined by Folin-Ciocalteu's Assay. Prebiotic activity, using two probiotic strains Lactobacillus acidophilus DSM 20079 and Bifidobacterium animalis DSM 20105, was investigated. The technological properties, such as hydration and oil retention capacity, were evaluated. The enzymatic treatment increased the yield of short-chain soluble saccharides. The highest oligosaccharide content was obtained using Viscozyme® L and Pectinex® Ultra Tropical. All of the tested extracts of cranberry pomace showed the ability to promote growth of selected probiotic bacteria. The insoluble dietary fiber content decreased in all of the samples, while the soluble dietary fiber increased just in samples hydrolyzed with Celluclast® 1.5L. The highest content of total phenolic compounds was obtained using Viscozyme® L and Pectinex® Ultra Tropical (10.9% and 13.1% higher than control, respectively). The enzymatically treated cranberry pomace exhibited lower oil and water retention capacities in most cases. In contrast, water swelling capacity increased by 23% and 70% in samples treated with Viscozyme® L and Celluclast® 1.5L, respectively. Enzymatically treated cranberry pomace has a different composition and technological properties depending on the enzyme used for hydrolysis and can be used in various novel food products."

      "abstract": "Vaccinium macrocarpon (cranberry) is a fruit that has an inhibitory effect on matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) present in dentin and saliva. The inhibition of MMPs has been shown to prevent dentin erosion. The aim of this study was to analyze the effect of cranberry juice on the reduction of dentin erosion in vitro. Specimens of bovine dentin (4×4×2 mm) were randomized and divided into 4 groups (n = 17/group): distilled water (C-control, pH 7.2); green tea extract solution containing 400 µm epigallo-catechin-gallate (EGCg, positive control, pH 4.5); 10% cranberry extract (CrE, pH 3.9), and cranberry juice (CrJ, Cranberry JuxxTM, pH 2.8). Specimens were submitted to erosive pH cycles for 5 days. Each day, four demineralizations were carried out with 0.1% citric acid (90 s). After the acid challenges, specimens were rinsed and kept in treatment solutions for 1 min; afterwards, they were rinsed and stored in artificial saliva for 1 h at 37°C (or overnight at the end of each day). After the experimental period of 5 days, dentin loss was evaluated by contact profilometry. Data were analyzed by ANOVA and Tukey's test (p < 0.05). Dentin loss (µm ± SD) was significantly lower for all treatments (EGCg = 9.93 ± 2.90; CrE = 12.10 ± 5.44; CrJ = 11.04 ± 5.70) compared to control (21.23 ± 11.96), but it did not significantly differ from each other. These results indicate that the commercial cranberry juice, despite its low pH, is able to reduce dentin erosion, which might be due to the ability of cranberry components to inhibit MMPs.",

However, our knowledge of the neuroprotective potential of cranberries is limited. Previously, we have demonstrated that CJ treatment controls oxidative stress in several organs, with the most evident effect in the brain. In this study, we examined the capability of CJ for protection against Parkinson's disease (PD) in a rotenone (ROT) rat model. Wistar rats were administered with CJ in a dose of 500 mg/kg b.w./day (i.g.) and subcutaneously injected with ROT (1.3 mg/kg b.w./day). The experiment lasted 45 days, including 10 days pre-treatment with CJ and 35 days combined treatment with CJ and ROT. We quantified the expression of α-synuclein and apoptosis markers in the midbrain, performed microscopic examination, and assessed postural instability to evaluate the CJ neuroprotective effect. Our results indicate that the juice treatment provided neuroprotection, as evidenced by declined α-synuclein accumulation, Bax and cleaved/active caspase-9 expression, and normalized cytochrome c level that was accompanied by the enhancement of neuronal activity survival and improved postural instability. Importantly, we also found that long-term administration of CJ alone in a relatively high dose may exert a deleterious effect on cell survival in the midbrain.",

These concerns necessitate alternatives to antibiotic use in the management of pediatric UTIs. This review seeks to evaluate non-antibiotic means of preventing UTI in the pediatric population. RECENT FINDINGS: The search for preventative alternatives to antibiotics has included D-mannose, cranberry, and probiotics. These products similarly work through competitive inhibition of uropathogens in the urinary tract. Pediatric studies exist highlighting the use of cranberry extract/juice and probiotics in UTI prevention, although significant heterogeneity amongst studies have limited overarching recommendations for their use. Data of D-mannose use is extrapolated from adult literature. More studies are required in the utility of each treatment, with some emphasis on larger sample sizes and clarifications regarding dosing and formulation.",

The 16S rRNA gene sequencing showed that the NT oral microbiome composition was different than that of STs at baseline (p = 0.012) but not after the intervention (p = 0.525). Principal coordinates analysis using unweighted UniFrac distance showed that CPE modified microbiome composition in NTs (p = 0.023) but not in STs (p = 0.096). The intervention also altered specific salivary protein levels (α-amylase, MUC-5B, and selected S-type Cystatins) with no changes in sensory perception. Correlation networks between oral microbiota, salivary proteins, and sensory ratings showed that the ST microbiome had a more complex relationship with salivary proteins, particularly proline-rich proteins, than that in NTs. These findings show that CPE modulated the oral microbiome of NTs to be similar to that of STs, which could have implications for oral health.",

However, whether daily consumption of whole cranberries will have sustained vascular benefits in healthy individuals is currently unknown. Objective: To investigate the vascular effects of acute and daily consumption of freeze dried whole cranberry in healthy men and how effects relate to circulating cranberry (poly)phenol metabolites. Methods: A double-blind, parallel-group, randomized controlled trial was conducted in 45 healthy male adults randomly allocated to 1 month daily consumption of either cranberry (9 g powder solubilized in water equivalent to 100 g of fresh cranberries, 525 mg total (poly)phenols) or control (9 g powder, no (poly)phenols). Flow-mediated dilation (FMD, primary outcome), pulse wave velocity (PWV), aortic augmentation index (AIx), blood pressure, heart rate, blood lipids, and blood glucose were assessed at baseline and at 2 h on day 1 and after 1 month. Plasma and 24 h-urine were analyzed before and after treatment using targeted quantitative LC-MS methods including 137 (poly)phenol metabolites. Results: Cranberry consumption significantly increased FMD at 2 h and 1-month (1.1% (95% CI: 1.1%, 1.8%); ptreatment ≤ 0.001; ptreatment × time = 0.606) but not PWV, AIx, blood pressure, heart rate, blood lipids, and glucose. Of the 56 and 74 (poly)phenol metabolites quantified in plasma and urine, 13 plasma and 13 urinary metabolites significantly increased 2 h post-consumption and on day 1, respectively, while 4 plasma and 13 urinary metabolites were significantly higher after 1-month of cranberry consumption, in comparison with control. A multi-variable stepwise linear regression analysis showed that plasma cinnamic acid-4'-glucuronide, 4-hydroxybenzoic acid-3-sulfate, 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid, 3'-hydroxycinnamic acid, and 5-O-caffeoylquinic acid were significant independent predictors of 2 h FMD effects (R2 = 0.71), while 3'-hydroxycinnamic acid, 4-methoxycinnamic acid-3'-glucuronide, 3-(4'-methoxyphenyl)propanoic acid 3'-sulfate, and 3-(4'-methoxyphenyl)propanoic acid 3'-glucuronide predicted the 1-month FMD effects (R2 = 0.52). Conclusions: Acute and daily consumption of whole cranberry powder for 1 month improves vascular function in healthy men and this is linked with specific metabolite profiles in plasma.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to investigate the impact of methenamine hippurate with cranberry capsules on rates of UTI after pelvic reconstructive surgery, among patients requiring short-term catheterization. STUDY DESIGN: In this randomized, double-blinded placebo-controlled trial, patients discharged with a catheter after pelvic reconstructive surgery were approached to participate. Participants were randomized to receive cranberry with methenamine or cranberry with placebo. Primary outcome was number of UTIs treated within 1 week after surgery. Secondary outcomes included incidence of UTIs treated within 6 weeks postoperatively, bacterial species on culture, urinary pH, catheter duration, patient adherence, and satisfaction. A sample size of 88 participants per arm was planned. RESULTS: From June 2019 to July 2021, 185 patients were randomized and 182 analyzed; 89 received placebo and 93 received methenamine. Both groups were similar. Incidence of UTI at 1 week was significantly higher in the placebo group (79.8%) compared with the methenamine group (66.7%; odds ratio, 1.97; 95% confidence interval, 1.01-3.87; P = 0.048). This difference increased by 6 weeks postoperatively (89.9% vs 72.0%; odds ratio, 3.45; 95% confidence interval, 1.51-7.87; P = 0.003). There were fewer pseudomonal UTIs in the methenamine group (P = 0.041). Duration of catheterization and urinary pH were similar. Overall adherence and level of satisfaction was high. CONCLUSIONS: In this high-risk population, methenamine was well tolerated and significantly reduced UTI rates. Methenamine with cranberry should be considered as an effective prophylactic therapy to reduce this common complication after pelvic surgery.",

      "abstract": "Esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) is a cancer characterized by rapidly rising incidence and poor survival, resulting in the need for new prevention and treatment options. We utilized two cranberry polyphenol extracts, one proanthocyanidin enriched (C-PAC) and a combination of anthocyanins, flavonoids, and glycosides (AFG) to assess inhibitory mechanisms utilizing premalignant Barrett's esophagus (BE) and EAC derived cell lines. We employed reverse phase protein arrays (RPPA) and Western blots to examine cancer-associated pathways and specific signaling cascades modulated by C-PAC or AFG. Viability results show that C-PAC is more potent than AFG at inducing cell death in BE and EAC cell lines. Based on the RPPA results, C-PAC significantly modulated 37 and 69 proteins in JH-EsoAd1 (JHAD1) and OE19 EAC cells, respectively. AFG treatment significantly altered 49 proteins in both JHAD1 and OE19 cells. Bioinformatic analysis of RPPA results revealed many previously unidentified pathways as modulated by cranberry polyphenols including NOTCH signaling, immune response, and epithelial to mesenchymal transition. Collectively, these results provide new insight regarding mechanisms by which cranberry polyphenols exert cancer inhibitory effects targeting EAC, with implications for potential use of cranberry constituents as cancer preventive agents.",

Estrogen-induced cholestasis is marked by a reduction in bile flow and the accumulation of bile acids in the liver as well as liver damage. The aim was to evaluate the hepatoprotective effect on EE-induced cholestasis in rats of Cranberry Water Extract (CWE). &lt;b&gt;Materials and Methods:&lt;/b&gt; Adult albino rats weighing approximately 150±10 g were divided into six groups of six animals each. As control groups, three groups (I, II and IV) and three experimental groups were used (III, V, VI). &lt;b&gt;Results:&lt;/b&gt; Oral administration for 15 days of CWE (150 mg kg&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; b.wt.) in EE-treated rats (100 μg kg&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; 5 days b.wt.) improved serum cholesterol, bile acid and TBIL as well as hepatic SOD and GPx significantly. Also, CWE inhibited ALP, ALT, γ-GT activity as well as levels of TNF-α, NO, MMP-2 and MMP-9 and MDA in comparison with the EE treatment rats. On the other hand, the liver TLR4, NF-κB and p38MAPK gene expression was down regulated group of rats administrated with cranberry extract when compared with the EE-treated rats. CWE's prophylactic action II is more pronounced than prophylactic one. The hepatoprotective effects of cranberry in restoring normal liver functional ability were also supported by histopathological examination of liver tissues. &lt;b&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/b&gt; The results show clearly that cranberry extract has a strong prophylactic effect in EE-induced cholestasis by normalizing the levels of TLR4, NF-κB and p38MAPK gene expression.",

The goal of this research was to encapsulate the nutraceutical (CBE), into bile salt augmented liposomes (BSALs) as a promising oral delivery system to potentiate its hepatoprotective impact against dimethylnitrosamine (DMN) induced liver injury in rats. The inclusion of bile salt in the liposomal structure can enhance their stability within the gastrointestinal tract and promote CBE permeability. CBE loaded BSALs formulations were fabricated utilizing a (23) factorial design to explore the impact of phospholipid type (X1), phospholipid amount (X2), and sodium glycocholate (SGC) amount (X3) on BSALs properties, namely; entrapment efficiency percent, (EE%); vesicle size, (VS); polydispersity index; (PDI); zeta potential, (ZP); and release efficiency percent, (RE%). The optimum formulation (F1) exhibited spherical vesicles with EE% of 71.27 ± 0.32%, VS; 148.60 ± 6.46 nm, PDI; 0.38 ± 0.02, ZP; -18.27 ± 0.67 mV and RE%; 61.96 ± 1.07%. Compared to CBE solution, F1 had attenuated DMN-induced hepatic injury, as evidenced by the significant decrease in serum level of ALT, AST, ALP, MDA, and elevation of GSH level, as well as SOD and GPX activities. Furthermore, F1 exhibited an anti-inflammatory character by suppressing TNF-α, MCP-1, and IL-6, as well as downregulation of VEGF-C, STAT-3, and IFN-γ mRNA levels. This study verified that when CBE was integrated into BSALs, F1, its hepatoprotective effect was significantly potentiated to protect the liver against DMN-induced damage. Therefore, F1 could be deliberated as an antioxidant, antiproliferative, and antifibrotic therapy to slow down the progression of hepatic damage.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND & AIMS: Patients with Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) have an imbalance in the gut microbiota that can lead to increase levels of lipopolysaccharides (LPS) and uremic toxins such as indoxyl sulfate (IS), p-cresyl sulfate (p-CS), and indole-3 acetic acid (IAA). Among the therapeutic options for modulating gut microbiota are the bioactive compounds such as polyphenols present in cranberry, fruit with potential antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. This clinical trial focuses on evaluating the effects of supplementation with a dry extract of cranberry on plasma levels of LPS and uremic toxins in non-dialysis CKD patients. METHODS: It was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Patients were randomized into two groups: the cranberry group received 500 mg of dry cranberry extract (2 times daily), and the placebo group received 500 mg of corn starch (2 times daily) for two months. LPS plasma levels were evaluated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and uremic toxins (IS, p-CS, and IAA) by high-performance liquid chromatography-fluorescence detection. Anthropometric measurements and food intake using the 24-h food recall technique were also evaluated before and after the intervention. RESULTS: Twenty-five participants completed two months of supplementation: 12 patients in the cranberry group (8 women, 56.7 ± 7.5 years, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 39.2 ± 21.9 mL/min); 13 patients in the placebo group (9 women, 58.8 ± 5.1 years, eGFR of 39.7 ± 12.9 mL/min). As expected, there was a negative association between glomerular filtration rate and p-CS and IS plasma levels at the baseline. No change was observed in the uremic toxins and LPS levels. CONCLUSION: Cranberry dry extract supplementation for two months did not reduce the LPS and uremic toxins plasma levels produced by the gut microbiota in non-dialysis CKD patients.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The oral microbiota is a significant risk indicator for oral diseases, such as dental caries and periodontal inflammation. Much attention is presently paid to the development of functional foods (e.g. beverages containing cranberry constituents, or foods containing probiotics) that may serve as adjuncts for oral disease treatments (e.g. periodontitis and caries). Cranberry fruit, due to its unique chemical composition and antimicrobial potential, is a possible ingredient of such foods. The study aimed to investigate the effects of cranberry juice (CJ) and a cranberry functional beverage (mixture of 80% v/v apple juice, 20% v/v cranberry juice, and 0.25 g/100 mL ground cinnamon; CFB) on the growth and metabolic activity of selected oral bacteria. METHODS: Serial dilution pour plate method (SDPP) was used to examine the effect of CJ and CFB on the growth of Actinomyces naeslundii, Streptococcus mutans, and Lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei. 48-h electrical impedance measurements (EIM) during the cultivation of A. naeslundii were applied to evaluate the utility of the method as a rapid alternative for the assessment of the antimicrobial potential of cranberry beverages. RESULTS: The tested bacteria differed in their susceptibility to the antimicrobial action of CJ and CFB, with L. paracasei subsp. paracasei being least vulnerable to CFB (according to SDPP). Although CJ at a concentration of 0.5 mL/mL, showed a bactericidal effect on the growth of S. mutans, A. naeslundii was more sensitive to CJ (SDPP). Its inhibitory effect on A. naeslundii was seen even at concentrations as small as 0.03125-0.125 mL/mL (SDPP and EIM). On the other hand, S. mutans seemed to be more vulnerable to CFB than A. naeslundii (SDPP). CONCLUSIONS: CFB may be considered an adjunct in the treatment of oral diseases due to its action against selected oral pathogens, and not against the presumably beneficial L. paracasei subsp. paracasei. Bioelectrical impedance measurements appear to be a quick alternative to evaluating the antimicrobial activity of fruit beverages, but their utility should be confirmed with tests on other bacteria.",

The patients were randomized to receive 144 mg cranberry capsule or placebo for 6 months. The primary efficacy of the treatment was lipid profile, glycemic measurements, and liver enzyme levels. RESULTS: The data were reported for 46 in the supplementation group and 48 in the placebo group. The patient's mean (SD) age was 43.16 (11.08) years. No significant differences between groups were observed regarding the post-intervention level of liver enzyme. The mean after-intervention levels of total cholesterol (p < 0.001) and triglyceride (p = 0.01) were significantly lower in the intervention group compared with the placebo group. At the end of the study, the mean insulin and HOMA-IR levels were significantly lower in the cranberry group compared with the placebo group.

      "abstract": "A daily consumption of cranberry juice (CJ) is linked to many beneficial health effects due to its richness in polyphenols but could also awake some intestinal discomforts due to its organic acid content and possibly lead to intestinal inflammation. Additionally, the impact of such a juice on the gut microbiota is still unknown. Thus, this study aimed to determine the impacts of a daily consumption of CJ and its successive deacidification on the intestinal inflammation and on the gut microbiota in mice. Four deacidified CJs (DCJs) (deacidification rates of 0, 40, 60, and 80%) were produced by electrodialysis with bipolar membrane (EDBM) and administered to C57BL/6J mice for four weeks, while the diet (CHOW) and the water were ad libitum. Different parameters were measured to determine intestinal inflammation when the gut microbiota was profiled. Treatment with a 0% DCJ did not induce intestinal inflammation but increased the gut microbiota diversity and induced a modulation of its functions in comparison with control (water). The effect of the removal of the organic acid content of CJ on the decrease of intestinal inflammation could not be observed. However, deacidification by EDBM of CJ induced an additional increase, in comparison with a 0% DCJ, in the Lachnospiraceae family which have beneficial effects and functions associated with protection of the intestine: the lower the organic acid content, the more bacteria of the Lachnospiraceae family and functions having a positive impact on the gut microbiota.",

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: Extensive inter-individual variability exists in the production of flavan-3-ol metabolites. Preliminary metabolic phenotypes (metabotypes) have been defined, but there is no consensus on the existence of metabotypes associated with the catabolism of catechins and proanthocyanidins. This study aims at elucidating the presence of different metabotypes in the urinary excretion of main flavan-3-ol colonic metabolites after consumption of cranberry products and at assessing the impact of the statistical technique used for metabotyping. METHODS: Data on urinary concentrations of phenyl-γ-valerolactones and 3-(hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid derivatives from two human interventions has been used. Different multivariate statistics, principal component analysis (PCA), cluster analysis, and partial least square-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA), have been considered. RESULTS: Data pre-treatment plays a major role on resulting PCA models. Cluster analysis based on k-means and a final consensus algorithm lead to quantitative-based models, while the expectation-maximization algorithm and clustering according to principal component scores yield metabotypes characterized by quali-quantitative differences in the excretion of colonic metabolites. PLS-DA, together with univariate analyses, has served to validate the urinary metabotypes in the production of flavan-3-ol metabolites and to confirm the robustness of the methodological approach. CONCLUSIONS: This work proposes a methodological workflow for metabotype definition and highlights the importance of data pre-treatment and clustering methods on the final outcomes for a given dataset. It represents an additional step toward the understanding of the inter-individual variability in flavan-3-ol metabolism.

We aimed to conduct the first meta-analysis to summarise current evidence on effects of cranberry supplementation on H. pylori eradication in H. pylori positive subjects. We searched the online databases up to December 2020. Four randomised clinical trials (RCT) were included with human subjects, investigating the effect of cranberry on H. pylori eradication. The pooled results were expressed as the OR with 95 % CI. Based on five effect sizes with a total sample size of 1935 individuals, we found that according to the OR, there was a positive effect of cranberry supplementation on H. pylori eradication, increasing the chance of H. pylori eradication by 1·27 times, but this relationship was not statistically significant (overall OR: 1·27; 95 % CI 0·63, 2·58). The results also indicated the moderate between-study heterogeneity (I2 = 63·40 %; P = 0·03) of the studies. However, there were no significant differences in some subgroup analyses in the duration of treatment, the duration of follow-up and the Jadad score. Our findings revealed that although cranberry had a positive effect on H. pylori eradication in adults, this effect was not statistically significant. Due to the small number of included studies and moderate heterogeneities, the potential of cranberry supplementation on H. pylori eradication should be validated in large, multicentre and well-designed RCT in the future.",

      "abstract": "The efficacy of cranberry (Vaccinium spp.) as adjuvant therapy in preventing urinary tract infections (UTIs) remains controversial. This study aims to update and determine cranberry effects as adjuvant therapy on the recurrence rate of UTIs in susceptible groups. According to PRISMA guidelines, we conducted a literature search in Web of Science, PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and the Cochrane Library from their inception dates to June 2021. We included articles with data on the incidence of UTIs in susceptible populations using cranberry-containing products. We then conducted a trial sequential analysis to control the risk of type I and type II errors. This meta-analysis included 23 trials with 3979 participants. We found that cranberry-based products intake can significantly reduce the incidence of UTIs in susceptible populations (risk ratio (RR) = 0.70; 95% confidence interval(CI): 0.59 ~ 0.83; P<0.01). We identified a relative risk reduction of 32%, 45% and 51% in women with recurrent UTIs (RR = 0.68; 95% CI: 0.56 ~ 0.81), children (RR = 0.55; 95% CI: 0.31 ~ 0.97) and patients using indwelling catheters (RR = 0.49; 95% CI: 0.33 ~ 0.73). Meanwhile, a relative risk reduction of 35% in people who use cranberry juice compared with those who use cranberry capsule or tablet was observed in the subgroup analysis (RR = 0.65; 95% CI: 0.54 ~ 0.77). The TSA result for the effects of cranberry intake and the decreased risk of UTIs in susceptible groups indicated that the effects were conclusive. In conclusion, our meta-analysis demonstrates that cranberry supplementation significantly reduced the risk of developing UTIs in susceptible populations. Cranberry can be considered as adjuvant therapy for preventing UTIs in susceptible populations. However, given the limitations of the included studies in this meta-analysis, the conclusion should be interpreted with caution.",

      "abstract": "Hazara virus (HAZV) belongs to the Nairoviridae family and is included in the same serogroup of the Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV). CCHFV is the most widespread tick-borne arbovirus. It is responsible for a serious hemorrhagic disease, for which specific and effective treatment and preventive systems are missing. Bioactive compounds derived from several natural products may provide a natural source of broad-spectrum antiviral agents, characterized by good tolerability and minimal side effects. Previous in vitro studies have shown that a cranberry (Vaccinium macrocarpon Ait.) extract containing a high content of A-type proanthocyanidins (PAC-A) inhibits the replication of herpes simplex and influenza viruses by hampering their attachment to target cells. Given the broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity of polyphenols and the urgency to develop therapies for the treatment of CCHF, we investigated the antiviral activity of cranberry extract against HAZV, a surrogate nairovirus model of CCHFV that can be handled in Level 2 Biosafety Laboratories (BSL-2). The results indicate that the cranberry extract exerts an antiviral activity against HAZV by targeting early stages of the viral replication cycle, including the initial adsorption to target cells. Although the details of the molecular mechanism of action remain to be clarified, the cranberry extract exerts a virucidal effect through a direct interaction with HAZV particles that leads to the subsequent impairment of virus attachment to cell-surface receptors. Finally, the antiviral activity of the cranberry extract was also confirmed for CCHFV. As a whole, the evidence obtained suggests that cranberry extract is a valuable candidate to be considered for the development of therapeutic strategies for CCHFV infections."

      "abstract": "Emerging cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors, including central vascular function and HDL efflux, may be modifiable with food-based interventions such as cranberry juice. A randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover trial was conducted in middle-aged adults with overweight/obesity (n = 40; mean BMI: 28.7 ± 0.8 kg/m2; mean age: 47 ± 2 years) and elevated brachial blood pressure (mean systolic/diastolic BP: 124 ± 2/81 ± 1 mm Hg). Study participants consumed 500 mL/d of cranberry juice (~16 fl oz; 27% cranberry juice) or a matched placebo juice in a randomized order (8-week supplementation periods; 8-week compliance break), with blood samples and vascular measurements obtained at study entry and following each supplementation period. There was no significant treatment effect of cranberry juice supplementation on the primary endpoint of central systolic blood pressure or central or brachial diastolic pressure. Cranberry juice significantly reduced 24-h diastolic ambulatory BP by ~2 mm Hg compared to the placebo (p = 0.05) during daytime hours. Cranberry juice supplementation did not alter LDL-C but significantly changed the composition of the lipoprotein profile compared to the placebo, increasing the concentration of large LDL-C particles (+29.5 vs. -6.7 nmol/L; p = 0.02) and LDL size (+0.073 vs. -0.068 nm; p = 0.001). There was no effect of treatment on ex vivo HDL efflux in the total population, but exploratory subgroup analyses identified an interaction between BMI and global HDL efflux (p = 0.02), with greater effect of cranberry juice in participants who were overweight. Exploratory analyses indicate that baseline C-reactive protein (CRP) values may moderate treatment effects. In this population of adults with elevated blood pressure, cranberry juice supplementation had no significant effect on central systolic blood pressure but did have modest effects on 24-h diastolic ambulatory BP and the lipoprotein profile. Future studies are needed to verify these findings and the results of our exploratory analyses related to baseline health moderators.",

Their molecular and genomic characterization is a result of the recent advent in next-generation sequencing technology. In the current research, extracts were prepared in different media, such as petroleum ether, methanol and ethanol. An extract of Vaccinium macrocarpon (cranberry) was used at a dose of 200-400 mg/kg by weight (B.wt). Levels of oxidative stress markers, i.e., superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione (GSH), advanced oxidation protein products (AOPPs) and malondialdehyde (MDA), were measured. A histopathological study of six vital organs in rats was also conducted. The results indicated that the antioxidant levels were lower in the group given only ethylene oxide (EtO) but higher in the groups receiving cranberry extract as a treatment. Major improvements were also observed in stress markers such as advanced oxidation protein products (AOPPs) and MDA following cranberry treatment. Histopathological changes induced by EtO were observed in the heart, kidney, liver, lung, stomach and testis and were reversed following cranberry treatment. The major toxic effects of EtO were oxidative stress and organ degeneration, as observed from various stress markers and histopathological changes. Our study showed that this extract contains strong antioxidant properties, which may contribute to the amelioration of the observed toxic effects.",

The main uropathogenic bacteria are members of the intestinal microbiota. A randomized cross-over experiment was done to investigate whether cranberry dietary supplementation affects concentrations of thermotolerant coliforms, Enterococcus spp. and Lactobacillus spp. in rat faeces. Thirteen rats, housed in individual cages, received successively two diets as pellets during 7 days each: a standard diet without polyphenols and the standard diet supplemented with cranberry powder containing 10.9 mg/100 g of PAC. There was a 7 days wash-out period in between with standard diet without polyphenols. Body weight and feed intake were recorded. Faeces were collected on the last day of treatment, and crushed to count the different bacterial populations using the most probable number method. Thermotolerant coliforms were grown in BGBLB tubes and on MacConkey agar. Enterococcus spp. were grown in Rothe and Litsky broths and on KF Streptococcus agar. Lactobacillus spp. were grown in Man Rogosa Sharpe broth. Body mass gains were not affected by cranberry supplementation. This is consistent with equal food intake, cranberry powder not providing significant energy supplement. Cranberry dietary supplementation was associated with changes in fecal concentrations of thermotolerant coliforms, and Enterococcus spp. in some rats, but did not induce significant changes in bacterial fecal concentrations in a global population of 13 rats. In conclusion, we did not observe any significant effect of dietary cranberry supplementation on the fecal microbiota of Wistars rats for a 7-day diet."

However, RT for GBM is largely ineffective at clinically safe doses, thus, the study of radiosensitizers is of great significance. MATERIALS AND METHODS: With accumulating evidence for the anticancer effect of compounds from cranberry, this study was designed to investigate if cranberry extract (CE) sensitizes GBM to RT in the widely used human glioblastoma cell line U87. We utilized clonogenic survival assays, cell proliferation assays, and caspase-3 activity kits. Potential proliferative and apoptotic molecular mechanisms were evaluated by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: We found that CE alone had little effect on the survival of U87 cells. However, RT supplemented by CE significantly inhibited proliferation and promoted apoptosis of U87 cells when compared with RT alone. The proliferation-inhibitory effect of RT/CE might be attributable to the up-regulation of p21, along with the down-regulation of cyclin B and cyclin-dependent kinase 4. This pro-apoptotic effect might additionally be attributable to the down-regulation of survivin. CONCLUSION: These results warrant further study of the potential radiosensitizing capacity of CE in glioblastoma and other cancer types.",

      "abstract": "The non-dialyzable material (NDM) of polyphenol-rich cranberry extract (CRE) powder (NDM-CRE) was studied for its effect of inducing body weight (BW) loss in 13 different mouse lines with well-defined genetically diverse backgrounds, named the collaborative cross (CC). From the age of 8 weeks, the mice were maintained on a high-fat diet (HFD) for 18 weeks, to induce obesity, and BW was measured biweekly. From week 12, CRE was injected intraperitoneally (IP) (50 mg kg-1) 3 times a week per mouse for a 6 week period. Statistical analysis results have shown a significant increase in body weight between week 0 and week 12; the increase in BW of 13 lines of mice on HFD was in the range of 10.41% to 68.65% for males and 9.78% to 64.74% for females. After injecting NDM-CRE extract, our analysis has shown an induced change in BW between week 12 and week 18. In males, NDM-CRE caused a significant decrease in BW of 5 out of the 13 lines in the range of -5.68% to -16.69% and a significant increase of 8.31% in BW of one male line, whereas in seven lines there was no significant decrease (-2.14% to -4.09%). In females, NDM-CRE caused a significant decrease in BW of 5 out of the 13 lines in the range of -3.90% to -11.83%, whereas in eight lines there were no significant changes in BW and it ranged between -1.50% and 4.90%. The broad-sense heritability (H2) and genetic coefficient of variation (CVg) were estimated and found to be between 0.71 and 0.81 for H2, and 0.18 and 0.24 for CVg of females and males, respectively, with respect to the efficacy of NDM-CRE on body weight reduction. Our results have shown that hosts with different genetic backgrounds respond differently to body weight increase, as well as to NDM-CRE treatment for body weight reduction. These results provide a platform for assessing more CC lines and mapping genes underlying the efficacy of the NDM-CRE treatment as a way of understanding pharmacogenomics.",

      "abstract": "Cranberry consumption has numerous health benefits, with experimental reports showing its anti-inflammatory and anti-tumor properties. Importantly, microbiome research has demonstrated that the gastrointestinal bacterial community modulates host immunity, raising the question of whether the cranberry-derived effect may be related to its ability to modulate the microbiome. Only a few studies have investigated the effect of cranberry products on the microbiome to date. Especially because cranberries are rich in dietary fibers, the extent of microbiome modulation by polyphenols, particularly proanthocyanidins (PACs), remains to be shown. Since previous work has only focused on long-term effects of cranberry extracts, in this study we investigated the effect of a water-soluble, PAC-rich cranberry juice extract (CJE) on the short-term dynamics of a human-derived bacterial community in a gnotobiotic mouse model. CJE characterization revealed a high enrichment in PACs (57%), the highest ever utilized in a microbiome study. In a 37-day experiment with a ten-day CJE intervention and 14-day recovery phase, we profiled the microbiota via 16S rRNA sequencing and applied diverse time-series analytics methods to identify individual bacterial responses. We show that daily administration of CJE induces distinct dynamic patterns in bacterial abundances during and after treatment, before recovering resiliently to pre-treatment levels. Specifically, we observed an increase of Akkermansia muciniphila and Clostridium hiranonis at the expense of Bacteroides ovatus after the offset of the selection pressure imposed by the PAC-rich CJE. This demonstrates that termination of an intervention with a cranberry product can induce changes of a magnitude as high as the intervention itself."

Cranberry supplements for consumer use are not regulated and can be formulated different ways using cranberry juice, pomace or various combinations. This can lead to consumer confusion regarding effectiveness of individual products. The current study compared two commercial supplement products, one made from cranberry juice extract and the other from a blend of whole cranberry. The influence of formulation and proanthocyanidin (PAC) solubility on in vitro and ex vivo P-fimbriated Escherichia coli bacterial anti-adhesion activity (AAA) was determined. Both supplement products as well as whole, frozen cranberries were chromatographically separated into crude polyphenolic, sugar and acid fractions. In vitro AAA testing of all fractions confirmed that only those containing soluble PACs elicited activity. The cranberry juice extract product had higher soluble PAC content than the whole cranberry blended product, which contained mainly insoluble PACs. The influence of soluble and insoluble PAC levels in each product on the urinary (ex vivo) AAA was determined following ingestion. The juice extract product was associated with significantly higher urinary AAA than that of the whole berry blended product when consumed once daily over the 1-week intervention period.",

      "abstract": "The high polyphenols content of cranberry accounts for its strong antioxidant activity underlying the beneficial health effects of this fruit. Rotenone (ROT) is a specific inhibitor of mitochondrial complex I in the brain which leads to the generation of oxidative stress. To date, there are few data indicating that toxicity of ROT is not limited to the brain but can also affect other tissues. We aimed to examine whether ROT-induced oxidative stress could be counteracted by cranberry juice not only in the brain but also in the liver and kidney. Wistar rats were given the combined treatment with ROT and cranberry juice (CJ) for 35 days. Parameters of antioxidant status were determined in the organs. ROT enhanced lipid peroxidation solely in the brain. The increase in the DNA damage was noticed in all organs examined and in leukocytes. The beneficial effect of CJ on these parameters appeared only in the brain. Additionally, CJ decreased the activity of serum hepatic enzymes. The effect of CJ on antioxidant enzymes was not consistent, however, in some organs, CJ reversed changes evoked by ROT. Summing up, ROT can cause oxidative damage not only in the brain but also in other organs. CJ demonstrated a protective effect against ROT-induced toxicity.",

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: Our objective was to assess the efficacy of a high dose cranberry proanthocyanidin extract for the prevention of recurrent urinary tract infection. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We recruited 145 healthy, adult women with a history of recurrent urinary tract infection, defined as ≥ 2 in the past 6 months or ≥ 3 in the past 12 months in this randomized, controlled, double-blind clinical trial. Participants were randomized to receive a high dose of standardized, commercially available cranberry proanthocyanidins (2 × 18.5 mg daily, n = 72) or a control low dose (2 × 1 mg daily, n = 73) for a 24-week period. During follow-up, symptomatic women provided urine samples for detection of pyuria and/or bacteriuria and received an appropriate antibiotic prescription. The primary outcome for the trial was the mean number of new symptomatic urinary tract infections during a 24-week intervention period. Secondary outcomes included symptomatic urinary tract infection with pyuria or bacteriuria. RESULTS: In response to the intervention, a non-significant 24% decrease in the number of symptomatic urinary tract infections was observed between groups (Incidence rate ratio 0.76, 95%CI 0.51-1.11). Post-hoc analyses indicated that among 97 women who experienced less than 5 infections in the year preceding enrolment, the high dose was associated with a significant decrease in the number of symptomatic urinary tract infections reported compared to the low dose (age-adjusted incidence rate ratio 0.57, 95%CI 0.33-0.99). No major side effects were reported. CONCLUSION: High dose twice daily proanthocyanidin extract was not associated with a reduction in the number of symptomatic urinary tract infections when compared to a low dose proanthocyanidin extract. Our post-hoc results reveal that this high dose of proanthocyanidins may have a preventive impact on symptomatic urinary tract infection recurrence in women who experienced less than 5 infections per year.

      "abstract": "The emergence and spread of extended-spectrum β-lactamases (ESBLs), metallo-β-lactamases (MBLs), or variant low-affinity penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) pose a major threat to our ability to treat bacterial infection using β-lactam antibiotics. Although combinations of β-lactamase inhibitors with β-lactam agents have been clinically successful, there are no MBL inhibitors in current therapeutic use. Furthermore, recent clinical use of new-generation cephalosporins targeting PBP2a, an altered PBP, has led to the emergence of resistance to these antimicrobial agents. Previous work shows that natural polyphenols such as cranberry-extracted proanthocyanidins (cPAC) can potentiate non-β-lactam antibiotics against Gram-negative bacteria. This study extends beyond previous work by investigating the in vitro effect of cPAC in overcoming ESBL-, MBL-, and PBP2a-mediated β-lactam resistance. The results show that cPAC exhibit variable potentiation of different β-lactams against β-lactam-resistant Enterobacteriaceae clinical isolates as well as ESBL- and MBL-producing E. coli We also discovered that cPAC have broad-spectrum inhibitory properties in vitro on the activity of different classes of β-lactamases, including CTX-M3 ESBL and IMP-1 MBL. Furthermore, we observe that cPAC selectively potentiate oxacillin and carbenicillin against methicillin-resistant but not methicillin-sensitive staphylococci, suggesting that cPAC also interfere with PBP2a-mediated resistance. This study motivates the need for future work to identify the most bioactive compounds in cPAC and to evaluate their antibiotic-potentiating efficacy in vivoIMPORTANCE The emergence of β-lactam-resistant Enterobacteriaceae and staphylococci compromises the effectiveness of β-lactam-based therapy. By acquisition of ESBLs, MBLs, or PBPs, it is highly likely that bacteria may become completely resistant to the most effective β-lactam agents in the near future. In this study, we described a natural extract rich in proanthocyanidins which exerts adjuvant properties by interfering with two different resistance mechanisms. By their broad-spectrum inhibitory ability, cranberry-extracted proanthocyanidins could have the potential to enhance the effectiveness of existing β-lactam agents.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: To determine the feasibility of conducting a randomised trial of the effectiveness of cranberry extract in reducing antibiotic use by women with symptoms of acute, uncomplicated urinary tract infection (UTI). DESIGN: Open-label feasibility randomised parallel group trial. SETTING: Four general practices in Oxfordshire. PARTICIPANTS: Women aged 18 years and above presenting to general practice with symptoms of acute, uncomplicated UTI. INTERVENTIONS: Women were randomly assigned using Research Electronic Data Capture in a 1:1:1 ratio to: (1) immediate antibiotics alone (n=15); (2) immediate antibiotics and immediate cranberry capsules for up to 7 days (n=15); or (3) immediate cranberry capsules and delayed antibiotics for self-initiation in case of non-improvement or worsening of symptoms (n=16). PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome measures were: rate of recruitment of participants; numbers lost to follow-up; proportion of electronic diaries completed by participants; and acceptability of the intervention and study procedures to participants and recruiters. Secondary outcomes included an exploration of differences in symptom burden and antibiotic use between groups. RESULTS: Four general practitioner practices (100%) were opened and recruited participants between 1 July and 2 December 2019, with nine study participants recruited per month on average. 68.7% (46/67) of eligible participants were randomised (target 45) with a mean age of 48.4 years (SD 19.9, range 18-81). 89.1% (41/46) of diaries contained some participant entered data and 69.6% (32/46) were fully complete. Three participants (6.5%) were lost to follow-up and two (4.4%) withdrew. Of women randomly assigned to take antibiotics alone (controls), one-third of respondents reported consuming cranberry products (33.3%, 4/12). There were no serious adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: It appears feasible to conduct a randomised trial of the use of cranberry extract in the treatment of acute, uncomplicated UTI in general practice.

      "abstract": "With the pressure to reduce antibiotics use in poultry production, cost-effective alternative products need to be developed to enhance the bird's immunity. The present study evaluated the efficacy of cranberry fruit by-products to modulate immunity in broiler chickens. Broiler Cobb 500 chicks were fed a control basal diet, basal diet supplemented with bacitracin (BACI, 55 ppm), cranberry pomace at 1% and 2% (CP2), or cranberry pomace ethanolic extract at 150 and 300 ppm (COH300) for 30 d. Blood sera were analyzed at days 21 and 28 of age for Ig levels by ELISA. The innate and adaptive immune-related gene expression levels in the liver and bursa of Fabricius were investigated at 21 d of age by quantitative polymerase chain reaction arrays. At day 21, the highest IgY level was found in the blood serum of the CP2-fed birds. In the liver, 13 of the 22 differentially expressed genes were downregulated across all treatments compared with the control. Expression of genes belonging to innate immunity such as caspase 1 apoptosis-related cysteine peptidase, chemokine receptor 5, interferon gamma, myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88, and Toll-like receptor 3 were significantly downregulated mainly in BACI- and COH300-fed birds. In the bursa, 5 of 9 genes associated with the innate immunity were differentially expressed. The expression of anti-inflammatory IL-10 gene was upregulated in all treatment groups in bursa compared with the control. The expression of transferrin gene was significantly upregulated in livers of birds fed COH300 and in bursa of birds fed BACI, indicating feeding practices and organ-dependant modulation of this gene in broiler. Overall results of this study showed that cranberry product feed supplementation modulated the innate immune and suppressed proinflammatory cytokines in broilers, providing a platform for future investigations to develop berry products in poultry feeding.",

The antibacterial effect was assessed by minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and survival populations of S. aureus strains after CA treatments. The changes in intracellular adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP) concentration, cell membrane potential, content of bacterial protein and cell morphology were analyzed to reveal possible action mode. Application potentials of CA as antimicrobial agent were assessed during storage of cooked pork and beef. The result showed that the MIC of CA against S. aureus strains was 5 mg/mL. Approximately 8 log CFU/mL of S. aureus strains can be completely inhibited after treatment with 2.0 MIC of CA for 0.5 h. Treatments of CA resulted in lower intracellular ATP and soluble protein levels, damaged membrane structure and leakage of cytoplasmic. Application of CA on cooked pork and beef caused a significant decrease in S. aureus counts and pH values, and color-darkening compared with control samples. These findings demonstrated that CA played an effective antimicrobial against S. aureus and had a potential as natural preservative to inhibit the growth of food pathogens.",

Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) in men older than 50 years is a common cause of LUTS. Here, we attempted to evaluate if CR is also effective for treating BPH using a BPH-induced rat model, which was orally administered CR. Male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 200-250 g were randomly divided into the following six groups (n = 9): noncastration group; castration group; BPH group; BPH and cranberry for 8-week (CR8W) group; BPH and cranberry for 4-week (CR4W) group; and BPH and saw palmetto group (saw palmetto). Compared with the BPH group, the CR8W group showed a significant decrease in prostate weight (by 33%), dihydrotestosterone (DHT) levels (by 18% in serum and 28% in prostate), 5-alpha reductase levels (18% reduction of type 1 and 35% of type 2), and histological changes. These results indicate that CR could attenuate BPH by inhibiting 5-alpha reductase and by reducing other biomarkers such as prostate weight and DHT levels. Thus, CR may be an effective candidate for the development of a functional food for BPH treatment. IACUC (USW-IACUC-R-2015-004).",

MATERIAL AND METHODS: This was a prospective cohort study of menopausal women recruited with a history of recurrent UTIs in the previous twelve months and who intended to treat their bladder problem without the use of antibiotics and/or anti-inflammatories. Women were proposed the use of an oral nutraceutical compound. The drug was taken for ten days, every month. Women were assigned to two parallel cohorts: patients using (group 1) or not using (group 2) this nutraceutical compound. The primary objective of the study was to evaluate the number of women with less than two infective episodes in the 6-month follow-up and less than three episodes in the 12-month follow-up. The secondary endpoints were to evaluate the reduction of related symptoms at 12-month follow-up, according to the Visual Analog Scale (VAS). RESULTS: At 6 months of therapy, the reduction in the number of patients with ≥ 2 UTIs was statistically significant (p < 0.05) compared to baseline only in group 1. At 12 months, the number of patients who were disease-free was significantly higher (p < 0.05) in group 1 compared to group 2. Moreover, the improvement of related symptoms was statistically significant (p < 0.05) in group 1, as shown by the reduction in the VAS scale value. CONCLUSIONS: In menopausal women, the combination of D-mannose, inulin, cranberry, bearberry, Olea europaea, Orthosiphon and Lactobacillus acidophilus SGL 11 per os represents a useful therapy for recurrent UTIs in women wanting a natural approach."

      "abstract": "Obesity is a chronic disease that has been causing serious problems all over the world. However, there is a lack of available therapeutic approaches to treat obesity. The FDA-approved drug orlistat has severe side effects, such as abdominal pain, flatulence and oily stool. As the therapeutic target of orlistat is pancreatic lipase, there is an urgent need for discovery of new pancreatic lipase inhibitors from natural sources that have reduced side effects compared with orlistat. In this study, ultrafiltration in combination with molecular simulation and spectroscopy was reported as an effective approach for identifying new pancreatic lipase inhibitors from anthocyanin-rich berry sources. Using this approach, four monomeric anthocyanins cyanidin-3-O-arabinoside (C3A), cyanidin-3-O-galactoside (C3Ga), peonidin-3-O-arabinoside (Pn3A) and peonidin-3-O-galactoside (Pn3Ga) from cranberries were discovered as potent pancreatic lipase inhibitors. These four cranberry anthocyanins were shown to form hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonds with pocket amino acid residues in molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations. C3A showed greater impact on secondary structures of the enzyme and showed higher binding capacity with the enzyme compared with C3Ga, Pn3A and Pn3Ga as observed by CD and fluorescence spectroscopy. The structure-activity relationships were then investigated and summarized as both the structures of the B ring and glycosyl group were related to the inhibitory activities of anthocyanins. In short, our results suggested that cranberry anthocyanins could be developed as food supplements to facilitate the prevention and treatment of obesity.",

So, we will evaluate the effects of concurrent omega-3 and cranberry juice supplementation along with standard antibiotic therapy on the eradication of Helicobacter pylori, gastrointestinal symptoms, some serum inflammatory and oxidative stress markers in adults with HP infection. METHODS: We will conduct a 4-week double-blinded randomized clinical trial. The subjects will be randomly stratified according to sex and BMI using a permuted block randomization procedure by Random Allocation Software (RAS). They will be assigned to one of the four study groups: (1) cranberry juice fortified with omega-3 Intervention (n=23), (2) cranberry juice intervention group (n=23), (3) placebo beverage fortified with omega-3 intervention group (n=23), and (4) placebo beverage intervention (control group) (n=23). All statistical analyses will be performed using IBM SPSS Statistics software. DISCUSSION: A combination of alternative therapies may have a synergistic effect compared to a single approach. It could potentially be more effective in promoting the efficacy of standard antibiotic therapy in eradicating HP infection.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Most women experience a urinary tract infection (UTI) at least once in their lifetime. The present study determined the efficacy and safety of a combination of Lactobacillus paracasei LC11, cranberry and D-mannose (Lactoflorene Cist®) in the prophylaxis of recurrent uncomplicated UTIs in premenopausal women. METHODS: This single-centre study enrolled premenopausal women aged 18-50 years with an acute UTI and a history of recurrent uncomplicated UTIs. Patients were first treated with fosfomycin (3 g once a day for 2 days) to eliminate any underlying infection, followed by treatment with Lactoflorene Cist® once a day for 10 days/month for 90 days (Group 1), Lactoflorene Cist® once daily for 90 days (Group 2) or no treatment (Group 3; control). The main study endpoint was the rate of UTI recurrence during the study period. Any adverse events with treatment were also recorded. RESULTS: A total of 55 women (mean age 39.3 years; range: 20-46) were enrolled in the study. A significantly higher proportion of patients in the control group experienced UTIs during the study period compared with the two treatment groups (52.9% vs 16.0% in Group 1 and 15.5% in group 2; p < 0.01). Similarly, a higher proportion of patients in Group 1 (65.8%) and Group 2 (68.7%) remained UTI-free during the study versus the control group. No adverse events were reported in the treated patients. CONCLUSION: Prophylactic treatment with Lactoflorene Cist® was effective and safe in the management of recurrent uncomplicated UTIs in premenopausal women.",

      "abstract": "Uncomplicated lower urinary tract infections are extremely common in women. Antibiotic treatment for acute episodes and for recurrence prophylaxis has its drawbacks and alternative therapies are sought in order to reduce the antimicrobial resistance phenomenon and the intestinal dismicrobism expansion. There are few studies on the effect of combination of cranberry extract with D-mannose in acute urinary tract infection management. In a pilot, randomized study 93 non-pregnant, otherwise healthy women, were enrolled with mean age of 39.77±10.36, diagnosed with uncomplicated lower urinary tract infection. Medical history, clinical examination, urine culture and a list of complaints were noted at the baseline visit. In a first phase of the study, treatment with either guideline recommended antibiotic alone or in association with the investigated product (cranberry extract plus D-mannose) was prescribed and all patients were clinically examined at day 7. All ameliorated and cured patients received in a second phase of the study, in a double-blind manner, prophylaxis with the investigated product or placebo for another 21 days, then a second clinical examination and a check of the list of complaints were performed. The cure rates were higher at day 7 when investigated product was added to antibiotic (91.6 vs. 84.4%). In resistant strains, a significantly higher cure rate was shown when the investigated product was added to antibiotic prescribed (88.8 vs. 37.5%, P<0.0001). The effect of cranberry extract plus D-mannose combination in acute urinary tract infection episodes seems to be promising. The significant cure rate registered in the patients with antibiotic-resistant urine cultures may be explained by a beneficial influence of the product on the antimicrobial sensitivity. Further studies are needed on this subject."

The aim of this study was to determine dosage effect of daily cranberry consumption on H. pylori suppression over time in infected adults to assess the potential of this complementary management strategy in a region with high gastric cancer risk and high prevalence of H. pylori infection. METHODS: This double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial on 522 H. pylori-positive adults evaluated dose-response effects of proanthocyanidin-standardized cranberry juice, cranberry powder, or their placebos on suppression of H. pylori at 2 and 8 weeks by 13 C-urea breath testing and eradication at 45 days post-intervention. RESULTS: H. pylori-negative rates in placebo, low-proanthocyanidin, medium-proanthocyanidin, and high-proanthocyanidin cranberry juice groups at week 2 were 13.24%, 7.58%, 1.49%, and 13.85% and at week 8 were 7.35%, 7.58%, 4.48%, and 20.00%, respectively. Consumption of high-proanthocyanidin juice twice daily (44 mg proanthocyanidin/240-mL serving) for 8 weeks resulted in decreased H. pylori infection rate by 20% as compared with other dosages and placebo (P < 0.05). Percentage of H. pylori-negative participants increased from 2 to 8 weeks in subjects who consumed 44 mg proanthocyanidin/day juice once or twice daily, showing a statistically significant positive trend over time. Encapsulated cranberry powder doses were not significantly effective at either time point. Overall trial compliance was 94.25%. Cranberry juice and powder were well-tolerated. CONCLUSIONS: Twice-daily consumption of proanthocyanidin-standardized cranberry juice may help potentiate suppression of H. pylori infection. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ChiCTR1800017522, per WHO ICTRP.",

      "abstract": "Generating formulations for the delivery of a mixture of natural compounds extracted from natural sources is a challenge because of unknown active and inactive ingredients and possible interactions between them. As one example, natural cranberry extracts have been proposed for the prevention of biofilm formation on dental pellicle or teeth. However, such extracts may contain phenolic acids, flavonol glycosides along with other constituents like coumaroyl iridoid glycosides, flavonoids, alpha-linolenic acid, n-6 (or n-3) fatty acids, and crude fiber. Due to the presence of a variety of compounds, determining which molecules (and how many molecules) are essential for preventing biofilm growth is nontrivial to ascertain. Therefore, a formulation that could contain natural, unrefined, cranberry extract (with all its constituent compounds) at high loading would be ideal. Accordingly, we have generated several candidate formulations including poly(lactic-co-glycolic) acid (PLGA)-based microencapsulation of cranberry extract (CE15) as well as formulations including stearic acid along with polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) or Ethyl lauroyl arginate (LAE) complexed with cranberry extracts (CE15). We found that stearic acid in combination with PVP or LAE as excipients led to higher loading of the active and inactive compounds in CE15 as compared with a PLGA microencapsulation and also sustained release of CE15 in a tunable manner. Using this method, we have been able to generate two successful formulations (one preventative based, one treatment based) that effectively inhibit biofilm growth when incubated with saliva. In addition to cranberry extract, this technique could also be a promising candidate for other natural extracts to form controlled release systems.Graphical abstract.",

      "abstract": "Cranberry (Vaccinium macrocarpon) is a distinctive source of polyphenols as flavonoids and phenolic acids that has been described to display beneficial effects against urinary tract infections (UTIs), the second most common type of infections worldwide. UTIs can lead to significant morbidity, especially in healthy females due to high rates of recurrence and antibiotic resistance. Strategies and therapeutic alternatives to antibiotics for prophylaxis and treatment against UTIs are continuously being sought after. Different to cranberry, which have been widely recommended in traditional medicine for UTIs prophylaxis, probiotics have emerged as a new alternative to the use of antibiotics against these infections and are the subject of new research in this area. Besides uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC), the most common bacteria causing uncomplicated UTIs, other etiological agents, such as Klebsiellapneumoniae or Gram-positive bacteria of Enterococcus and Staphylococcus genera, seem to be more widespread than previously appreciated. Considerable current effort is also devoted to the still-unraveled mechanisms that are behind the UTI-protective effects of cranberry, probiotics and their new combined formulations. All these current topics in the understanding of the protective effects of cranberry against UTIs are reviewed in this paper. Further progresses expected in the coming years in these fields are also discussed.",

      "abstract": "Cranberry pomace obtained from industrial juice production was characterized by proximate composition analysis and monosaccharide profile of the dietary fiber. Extraction of carbohydrates from pomace was investigated using microwave-assisted alkaline method and five commercial biocatalysts (pure endo-galactanase and four multienzyme biocatalysts). The extracts obtained from microwave-assisted approach had average total sugars yield of 21.3% and contained mostly oligosaccharides in the degree of polymerization range of 7 to 10. All multienzyme biocatalysts led to yields similar or higher than microwave-assisted approach (23.4% to 42.0%), but mainly generated shorter oligosaccharides with a degree of polymerization of 2 to 5. Compared to cranberry pomace dietary fiber, microwave-assisted extracts were enriched in pectic oligosaccharides, whereas the enzymatic extracts were enriched in glucans and had less rhamnose and galactose. Pomace ground for 5 min or more by ball mill assumed a powdery consistence. Longer milling did not affect particle size but increased their roughness. Such physical changes had no effect on the efficiency of multienzymatic treatment. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: The increased production of cranberries and cranberry products will continuously generate more pomace, a potentially valuable material for the generation of added-value products. Up to 60% to 70% of cranberry pomace is composed of plant cell wall material. The properties of naturally occurring plant cell wall polysaccharides and their corresponding oligosaccharides have been of a great interest, and many of them find application as functional food ingredients. Despite the fact that the cranberry pomace is rich in plant cell polysaccharides, it has been mainly explored as a source of phenolic antioxidants. This study reveals the efficiency of cranberry pomace as a source of nondigestible oligosaccharides. The use of microwave-assisted extraction and different biocatalysts for the enzymatic extraction led to oligosaccharides with well-defined monosaccharide composition and molecular weight distribution. The study of the effects of these extraction techniques on the yield and the characteristics of generated oligosaccharides would allow the modulation of their properties. As an overall, the findings of this study would contribute to lay the scientific ground for the development of innovative process for the isolation of nondigestible oligosaccharides as functional ingredients from cranberry pomace by products.",

This study aimed to evaluate cell viability, anti-inflammatory activity, and macrophage polarization properties of different cranberry concentrates. METHODS: THP-1 cells (monocytic line) were treated with phorbol myristic acid to induce macrophage differentiation. Human gingival fibroblasts (HFIB-G cell line), osteosarcoma-derived osteoblasts (SAOS-2 cell line), and induced macrophages were treated with cranberry concentrates at 25, 50, and 100 µg/mL for 120 seconds, 1 hour and 24 hours. Untreated cells at the same time points served as controls. For anti-inflammatory analysis, induced macrophages exposed to cranberry concentrates (A-type PACs) were stimulated with lipopolysaccharides (LPS) derived from E coli for 24 hours. Cell viability, interleukin (IL)-8, IL-1 ß, IL-6, and IL-10 expression of LPS-stimulated macrophages, and macrophage polarization markers were evaluated through determination of live-cell protease activity, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and immunofluorescence staining semi-quantification. RESULTS: Cranberry concentrates (A-type PACs) did not reduce HGF, SAOS-2, and macrophage viability after 24 hours of exposure. Pro-inflammatory cytokine expression (ie IL-8 and IL-6) was downregulated in LPS-stimulated macrophages by cranberry concentrates at 50 and 100 µg/mL. Anti-inflammatory IL-10 expression was significantly upregulated in LPS-stimulated macrophages by cranberry concentrates at 100 µg/mL after 24 hours of exposure. M1 polarization significantly decreased when LPS-stimulated macrophages were exposed to cranberry concentrates. High levels of positive M1 macrophages were present in all untreated control groups. M2 polarization significantly increased at all LPS-stimulated macrophages exposed to cranberry concentrates for 1 and 24 hours. CONCLUSION: Cranberry-derived proanthocyanidins may have the potential to act as an anti-inflammatory component in the therapy of periodontal and peri-implant diseases.",

OBJECTIVES: In light of the reported health benefits of the polyphenolic compounds in cranberry, we investigated the effects and mechanism of a cranberry polyphenolic extract (CPE) in high-fat diet (HFD)-fed obese mice. METHODS: The distributions of individual CPE compounds were characterized by HPLC fingerprinting. Male C57BL/6J mice (4 wk old) were fed for 16 wk normal diet (ND, 10% fat energy) or HFD (60% fat energy) with or without 0.75% CPE in drinking water (HFD + CPE). Body and adipose depot weights, indices of glucose metabolism, energy expenditure (EE), and expression of genes related to brown adipose tissue (BAT) thermogenesis, and inguinal/epididymal white adipose tissue (iWAT/eWAT) browning were measured. RESULTS: After 16 wk, the body weight was 22.5% lower in the CPE-treated mice than in the HFD group but remained 17.9% higher than in the ND group. CPE treatment significantly increased EE compared with that of the ND and HFD groups. The elevated EE was linked with BAT thermogenesis, and iWAT/eWAT browning, shown by the induction of thermogenic genes, especially uncoupling protein 1 (Ucp1), and browning-related genes, including Cd137, a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily (Tnfrsf9). The mRNA expression and abundance of uncoupling protein 1 in BAT of CPE-fed mice were 5.78 and 1.47 times higher than in the HFD group, and 0.61 and 1.12 times higher than in the ND group, respectively. Cd137 gene expression in iWAT and eWAT of CPE-fed mice were 2.35 and 3.13 times higher than in the HFD group, and 0.84 and 1.39 times higher than in the ND group, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Dietary CPE reduced but did not normalize HFD-induced body weight gain in male C57BL/6J mice, possibly by affecting energy metabolism.",

A previous pilot study suggested that cranberry capsules may decrease some of the symptoms of acute radiation cystitis. Here we further test their effectiveness in a multicentre double blinded placebo-controlled clinical trial. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 108 prostate cancer patients were recruited at three New Zealand hospitals between September 2016 and January 2019. Out of this cohort, 101 patients provided datasets for analysis (51 men on cranberry capsules and 50 men on beetroot-containing placebo capsules). Patients took two capsules each morning during RT and for 2 weeks after completion of RT. Three measures were used to assess cystitis severity: modified RTOG, O'Leary interstitial cystitis scale and a sensitive novel radiation induced cystitis assessment scale (RICAS). Cystitis severity was scored at baseline and weekly thereafter during RT and for two weeks after completion of RT. Radiation protocols were stratified to conventional fractionation or hypo-fractionated radiation therapy (CHHiP) to the prostate or radiation to the prostate bed. RESULTS: Cranberry capsules performed significantly worse than placebo capsules with respect to day time frequency and bladder control, using the more sensitive RICAS scale. No significant difference in cystitis severity was seen between patients receiving hypofractionation and those receiving conventional fractionation to the prostate gland. CONCLUSION: Cranberry capsules were not superior to beetroot-containing placebo capsules in managing radiation cystitis in our prostate patient cohort. RICAS may be a useful tool for measuring radiation cystitis in future studies.",

The aim of this study was to evaluate the absorption, metabolism and urinary excretion of cranberry flavan-3-ols through the targeted analysis of phenyl-γ-valerolactones and their related phenylvaleric acids, considering also their potential as biomarkers of flavan-3-ol intake and inter-individual variability in their appearance in plasma and urine. A six-arm acute crossover, randomized, double-blinded, controlled intervention trial was performed in ten healthy males who consumed a cranberry juice drink (375, 716, 1131, 1396, 1741 mg of total flavan-3-ols) or an isocaloric control drink with one-week washout. Plasma and urine were analyzed by UHPLC-ESI-QqQ-MS/MS and 22 compounds were identified. Glucuronide and sulfate conjugates of 5-(3',4'-dihydroxyphenyl)-γ-valerolactone were the main circulating and excreted metabolites after cranberry juice intake, with glucuronidation appearing to be the most favorable conjugation route. These compounds reached maximum plasma concentration at about 4-6 h. Plasma and urinary concentrations of the sum of the metabolites increased in relation to the amounts of cranberry flavan-3-ols provided by the drink, showing a clear and linear dose-dependent relationship and underscoring their potential as biomarkers of flavan-3-ol intake. A high inter-individual variability in circulating and urinary metabolite levels was observed and, interestingly, some subjects seemed to display a greater efficiency in metabolizing flavan-3-ols and producing phenyl-γ-valerolactones.",

The aim was to assess the efficacy of a mix of pumpkin seed extract, soy germ isoflavonoids, and cranberry (Novex®) in the management of mild to moderate LUTS in BPH patients. Male patients aged ≥40 years, who had had mild to moderate LUTS for >6 months at screening, with no previous therapy or who are still symptomatic despite current use of alpha-blockers, were recruited. Exclusion criteria were an IPSS >19 and an age >80 years. The mixed compound was administered orally, daily, for 3 months. Patients were evaluated by means of IPSS, urological quality of life (uQoL) index, and International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF-5) at 3 visits: baseline (visit 1), 30 days (visit 2), and 90 days after treatment (visit 3). Among 163 screened patients, 128 patients (61.8 ± 9.9 years) were recruited. IPSS improved from 15 (Q1 : 12-Q3 : 17) in visit 1, to 11 (Q1 : 8-Q3 : 14) in visit 2, and to 9 (Q1 : 6-Q3 : 12) in visit 3 (p < 0.001). uQoL improved from 4 (3-4) in visit 1, to 3 (2-3) in visit 2, and to 2 (1-2) in visit 3 (p < 0.001). The patients had an IIEF-5 score of 15 (12-18.7) in visit 1, 15 (12-18) in visit 2, and 17 (13-19) in visit 3 (p=0.99 visits 1 vs. 2, p=0.004 visits 2 vs. 3, and p=0.001 visits 1 vs. 3). Treating mild to moderate LUTS/BPH patients with Novex® might therefore relieve symptoms, improve the quality of life, and have a mild beneficial effect on erectile function."

RESULTS: This research group evaluated 4 topics: St. John's wort for treating (mild to moderate) depression, tomato extract as a platelet inhibitor, Rhodiola against stress-related fatigue and cranberries for the treatment of urinary tract infections. CONCLUSION: The findings were diverse and must be individually taken into account. Evidence for efficacy varies within and between the four examples. An explanation for the lack of reproducibility of findings from preclinical and clinical experiments might be the insufficient standardization of herbal medicines. There is no scientific reason why phytotherapy should not be investigated with the same rigor as conventional drugs to establish the efficacy and potential risks. Meanwhile, it is concluded that care is essential when using herbal medicine in the daily routine and informing patients about potential shortcomings and dangers of herbal medicines should be considered a duty of pharmacists and physicians.",

The aim of this study was to better define the mechanism by which cranberry triggers apoptosis in HL-60 cells. METHODS: The study was carried on cranberry extracts (CB). Anti-apoptotic B-cell lymphoma-2 (BCL-2) and pro-apoptotic BCL-2-associated death promoter death (BAD) proteins in cell lysates were detected through Western blotting techniques. Equivalent protein loading was confirmed through anti-α-tubulin antibody. RESULTS: The results showed that treatment of HL-60 cells with CB causes a significant increase in the levels of caspase-9 and caspases-3/7 and increased mitochondrial outer membrane permeability, leading to the release of cytochrome C and Smac. These apoptotic events were associated with a significant decrease in protein kinase B (AKT) phosphorylation, which caused significant increase in BAD de-phosphorylation and promoted a sequence of events that led to intrinsic apoptosis. CONCLUSION: The study findings have described a molecular framework for CB-initiated apoptosis in HL-60 cells and suggested a direction for future in vivo studies investigating the anticancer effect of cranberry.",

      "abstract": "Chicken eggshells can be used as an attractive dietary source of mineral compounds, including calcium (Ca). However, the effects of chicken eggshell powder (CESP) on berry fruit juices have not been studied to date. Therefore, the objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of its addition to juices from chokeberry and cranberry on their phytochemical properties. The juices were determined for contents of polyphenols (determined by ultra-efficient liquid chromatography coupled with a mass detector (UPLC-PDA-ESI-MS/MS)), macro- and microelements (by inductively coupled plasma - optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES)), and organic acids (by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC-PDA)) as well as for their antioxidative activity by radical scavenging capacity (ABTS) and ferric reducing antioxidative power (FRAP) assay, color profile (CIE L* a* b* system), and sensory attributes. The study results demonstrate that CESP addition to chokeberry and cranberry juices enriched them with minerals and increased their Ca content 25.7 times and 66.3 times, respectively, compared to the control samples. Juices supplementation with CESP significantly decreased their acidity and total organic acids content as well as increased their pH value. Chokeberry and cranberry juices supplementation with 1% CESP caused no significant changes in the amount of precipitate and their color, but it significantly improved their taste. For this reason, CESP addition in the amount of up to 1% can be suggested as the optimal supplementation of berry fruit juices. The study also demonstrated that CESP addition in the amount of up to 1% caused no significant differences in the content of polyphenolic compounds and in the antioxidative activity of juices, which can be deemed important from the viewpoint of their putative health benefits. In addition, the heat treatment of juices contributed to only a 4% loss of polyphenolic compounds from the CESP-supplemented juices compared to the 6% loss from the non-supplemented juices.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Consultations in primary care for symptoms of urinary tract infections (UTIs) are common and patients are frequently treated with antibiotics. Given increasing antimicrobial resistance, there has been interest in non-antibiotic treatment options for common infections. One such option is the use of cranberry extract to treat symptoms attributable to UTIs. METHODS: A target of 45 women consulting in primary care, with symptoms suggestive of an uncomplicated UTI for whom the practitioner would normally prescribe antibiotics, will be randomised to receive one of three treatment approaches: (1) immediate prescription for antibiotics; (2) immediate prescription for antibiotics plus a 7-day course of cranberry capsules and (3) cranberry capsules plus a delayed prescription for antibiotics to be used in case their symptoms do not get better, or get worse. Follow-up will be by daily rating of symptoms and recording of treatments used for 2 weeks in an online symptom diary. Interviews will be conducted with around 10-15 study participants, as well as with around 10-15 women who have experienced a UTI but have not been approached to take part in the study. Both groups will be asked about their experience of having a UTI, their thoughts on non-antibiotic treatments for UTIs and their thoughts on, or experience of, the feasibility trial. The primary objective is to assess the feasibility of undertaking a full trial in primary care of the effectiveness of cranberry extract to reduce antibiotic use for symptoms of acute uncomplicated UTI. The secondary objective is to conduct a preliminary assessment of the extent to which cranberry might reduce antibiotic use and symptom burden. DISCUSSION: This feasibility study with embedded interviews will inform the planning and sample size calculation of an adequately powered trial to definitively determine whether cranberry helps to alleviate the symptoms of acute uncomplicated UTIs in women and whether it can safely reduce antibiotic use.

Cranberry juice and related products have been used for the prevention of UTIs with varying degrees of success. In this study, a group of cranberry pectic oligosaccharides (cPOS) were found to both inhibit quiescence and reduce the population of persister cells formed by the uropathogenic strain, CFT073. This is the first report detailing constituents of cranberry with the ability to modulate these important physiological aspects of uropathogenic E. coli.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are one of the most common infections found in humans, with uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) being the most common cause. Prevention of UTI is a major global concern due to its recurrent nature, medical cost, and most importantly, the increased antimicrobial resistance among UPEC. The resistance in UPEC is mainly due to the Extended-Spectrum β-lactamases (ESBL), particularly the E. coli CTXM-15 type which is known for its rapid dissemination worldwide. Treatment options for E. coli CTXM-15 have become limited over recent years because of their multi-drug resistance, hence anti-virulent strategies based on herbal remedies, have considered as a viable option. The cranberry product, Cysticlean® capsules, contain 240 mg of proanthocyanins (PACs), which have been shown to significantly inhibit E. coli adherence, both in vitro and ex vivo, to uroepithelial cells. METHOD: In this study, the cephalosporin-resistant E. coli isolate NCTC 1553 (E. coli CTXM-15) was analysed by qRT-PCR (quantitative Reverse Transcriptase -Polymerase Chain Reaction) for the expression of virulence factors after treatment with Cysticlean®. qRT-PCR was carried out to detect virulence determinants encoding for toxins SAT, and USP, the iron acquisition system ChuA, the protectins SoxS, KPSM, TraT and RecA, the antibiotic resistance gene CTX-M (encode β-lactamases), and the transporters IdfB and HcaT. RESULTS: Cysticlean® significantly reduced the expression of all ten selected genes encoding for virulence factors and β-lactamases. CONCLUSION: Cranberry product Cysticlean® could represent a practicable alternative option for the prevention of recurrent UTI caused by multi-drug resistant E. coli CTXM-15, as the product acts on multiple bacterial targets.",

The capacity of A. actinomycetemcomitans to produce a leukotoxin (LtxA) that activates pyroptosis in macrophages and induces the release of endogenous danger signals is thought to play a key role in the disease process. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of cranberry proanthocyanidins (PACs) on gene expression and cytotoxic activities of LtxA. We showed that cranberry PACs dose-dependently attenuate the expression of genes making up the leukotoxin operon, including ltxB and ltxC, in the two strains of A. actinomycetemcomitans tested. Cranberry PACs (≥62.5 µg/mL) protected macrophages against the cytotoxic effect of purified LtxA. Moreover, cranberry PACs reduced caspase-1 activation in LtxA-treated macrophages and consequently decreased the release of both IL-1β and IL-18, which are known as damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) and contribute to the progression of periodontitis by increasing cell migration and osteoclastogenesis. In addition, cranberry PACs reduced the expression of genes encoding the P2X7 receptor and NALP3 (NACHT, LRR and PYD domains-containing protein 3), which play key roles in pore formation and cell death. Lastly, cranberry PACs blocked the binding of LtxA to macrophages and consequently reduced the LtxA-mediated cytotoxicity. In summary, the present study showed that cranberry PACs reduced LtxA gene expression in A. actinomycetemcomitans and neutralized the cytolytic and pro-inflammatory responses of human macrophages treated with LtxA. Given these properties, cranberry PACs may represent promising molecules for prevention and treatment of the aggressive form of periodontitis caused by A. actinomycetemcomitans.",

      "abstract": "The opportunistic pathogen Escherichia coli, a common member of the human gut microbiota belonging to the Enterobacteriaceae family, is the causative agent of the majority of urinary tract infections (UTIs). The gut microbiota serves as a reservoir for uropathogenic E. coli where they are shed in feces, colonize the periurethral area, and infect the urinary tract. Currently, front line treatment for UTIs consists of oral antibiotics, but the rise of antibiotic resistance is leading to higher rates of recurrence, and antibiotics cause collateral damage to other members of the gut microbiota. It is commonly believed that incorporation of the American cranberry, Vaccinium macrocarpon, into the diet is useful for reducing recurrence of UTIs. We hypothesized such a benefit might be explained by a prebiotic or antimicrobial effect on the gut microbiota. As such, we tested cranberry extracts and whole cranberry powder on a human gut microbiome-derived community in a gut simulator and found that cranberry components broadly modulate the microbiota by reducing the abundance of Enterobacteriaceae and increasing the abundance of Bacteroidaceae. To identify the specific compounds responsible for this, we tested a panel of compounds isolated from cranberries for activity against E. coli, and found that salicylate exhibited antimicrobial activity against both laboratory E. coli and human UTI E. coli isolates. In a gut simulator, salicylate reduced levels of Enterobacteriaceae and elevated Bacteroidaceae in a dose dependent manner.",

Clean-catch urine samples collected at the baseline and post-intervention (0-3, 3-6, 6-9, 9-12, 12-24, 24-30, 30-36 h) were tested for anti-adhesion effects with a mannose-resistant human red blood cell hemagglutination assay specific for P-type E. coli, or a T24 cell line model for type 1 E. coli. Urinary anti-adhesion activity against P-type E. coli after consumption of the cranberry chew was significantly greater (p < 0.05) than that observed with placebo chew at all time points except 24-36 h. Ex vivo anti-adhesion effects on type 1 E. coli were greater (p < 0.05) after cranberry chew consumption than placebo chew at 3-6 and 6-9 h urine collections. In conclusion, consumption of cranberry +health™ cranberry supplement exhibited greater ex vivo urinary anti-adhesion activity compared to placebo, suggesting that it may have the potential to help promote urinary tract health.",

In this study, we compared the inhibitory effects of cranberry polyphenol and volatile extracts and volatile standards on nitric oxide (NO) production in lipopolysaccharide (LPS) activated RAW 264.7 macrophages. Polyphenols were analyzed by HPLC/HPLC-MS and volatiles were analyzed by GC/GC-MS. The inhibition of NO production of the fresh cranberry polyphenol and volatile extracts and α-terpineol, linalool, linalool oxide, and eucalyptol standards at 2, 4, and 8-fold dilutions of their original concentrations in fresh cranberries was evaluated by treating these extracts/standards for 1 h before or after LPS application for 24 h. After inducing inflammation with LPS, the polyphenol treatments (317.8 and 635.7 μg g-1) and 1.8 μg g-1 volatile treatment lowered NO levels 46-62% compared to the positive control (P < 0.05). When the cells were treated with polyphenol and volatile extracts before inducing inflammation, the 635.7 μg g-1 and 317.8 μg g-1 polyphenol treatments and 1.8 μg g-1 and 0.9 μg g-1 volatile treatments lowered NO levels (13-52%) compared to the positive control (P < 0.05). Polyphenol and volatile extracts from cranberry were effective in reducing NO production whether applied before or after the application of LPS. α-Terpineol at a concentration found in fresh cranberries (1.16 μg mL-1) was also found to be effective in reducing NO production whether cells were treated before or after application of LPS. Future studies are needed to reveal the mechanisms by which volatile compounds, especially α-terpineol act to mitigate inflammation and to determine the bioavailability of terpenes.",

Natural products are the effectual carbon precursors to synthesize carbon dots with fascinating chemical and physical properties. In this study, the fluorescent sensor of carbon dots derived from cranberry beans without any functionalization and modification was developed. The carbon dots were prepared with a cheap, facile, and green carbon precursor through a hydrothermal treatment method. The synthetic process was toxic chemical-free, convenient, and environmentally friendly. To find the optimized synthetic conditions, the temperature, heating time duration, and carbon precursor weight were evaluated. The prepared carbon dots were characterized by UV light, transmission electron microscopy, Raman, Fourier transform infrared, UV-vis, and fluorescence spectroscopy. The resulting carbon dots exhibit stable fluorescence with a quantum yield of approximately 10.85%. The carbon dots emitted the broad fluorescence emission range between 410 and 540 nm by changing the excitation wavelength and were used for the detection of Fe3+ ions at the excitation of 380 nm. It is found that Fe3+ ions induced the fluorescence intensity quenching of the carbon dots stronger than other heavy metals and the Fe3+ ion detection can be achieved within 3 min. Spectroscopic data showed that the obtained carbon dots can detect Fe3+ ions within the wide concentration range of 30-600 μM with 9.55 μM detection limit."

      "abstract": "Increased consumption of fruits may decrease the risk of chronic inflammatory diseases including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Gut microbiota dysbiosis plays an important etiological role in IBD. However, the mechanisms of action underlying the anti-inflammatory effects of dietary cranberry (Vaccinium macrocarpon) in the colon and its role on gut microbiota were unclear. In this study, we determined the anti-inflammatory efficacy of whole cranberry in a mouse model of dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis, as well as its effects on the structure of gut microbiota. The results showed that dietary cranberry significantly decreased the severity of colitis in DSS-treated mice, evidenced by increased colon length, and decreased disease activity and histologic score of colitis in DSS-treated mice compared to the positive control group (p < 0.05). Moreover, the colonic levels of pro-inflammatory cytokine (IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α) were significantly reduced by cranberry supplementation (p < 0.05). Analysis of the relative abundance of fecal microbiota in phylum and genus levels revealed that DSS treatment significantly altered the microbial structure of fecal microbiota in mice. α diversity was significantly decreased in the DSS group, compared to the healthy control group. But, cranberry treatment significantly improved DSS-induced decline in α-diversity. Moreover, cranberry treatment partially reversed the change of gut microbiota in colitic mice by increasing the abundance of potential beneficial bacteria, for example, Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium, and decreasing the abundance of potential harmful bacteria, such as Sutterella and Bilophila. Overall, our results for the first time demonstrated that modification of gut microbiota by dietary whole cranberry might contribute to its inhibitory effects against the development of colitis in DSS-treated mice.",

Subjects received BKPro-Cyan or placebo twice-daily for 26 weeks. The primary endpoint was the proportion of subjects with recurrent UTI at the end of the study.Results: 115 subjects were screened; 90 were enrolled; 81 completed the study. After 26 weeks, a significantly lower number of women experienced recurrent UTIs with BKPro-Cyan compared to placebo (9.1 vs 33.3%; P = 0.0053). BKPro-Cyan produced statistically significant improvements compared to placebo for multiple secondary endpoints, including: greater number of subjects who experienced no UTIs (90 vs 67%; P < 0.05); longer time to first UTI (174 vs 90 days; P = 0.001); shorter duration of active UTI (5 vs 12 days; P = 0.009); Fewer subjects requiring antibiotics (3 vs 11; P < 0.05); and shorter median duration of antibiotic treatment (4 vs 7 days; P = 0.09).Conclusions: BKPro-Cyan was safe and effective for preventing recurrent UTI in pre-menopausal adult women.

      "abstract": "Obesity is characterized by abnormal or excessive fat accumulation, which leads to the development of metabolic syndrome. Because oxidative stress is increased in obesity, antioxidants are regarded as suitable agents for preventing metabolic syndrome. Here, we examined the impact of cranberry, which contains various antioxidants, on metabolic profiles, including that during the progression of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), in high-fat diet (HFD)-fed C57BL/6 mice. We observed that oxidative stress was diminished in mice that were fed HFD diets supplemented with 1 and 5% cranberry powder as compared with that in HFD-fed control mice. Notably, from 1 week after beginning the diets to the end of the study, the body weight of mice in the cranberry-treatment groups was significantly lower than that of mice in the HFD-fed control group; during the early treatment phase, cranberry suppressed the elevation of serum triglycerides; and adipocytes in the adipose tissues of cranberry-supplemented-HFD-fed mice were smaller than these cells in HFD-fed control mice. Lastly, we examined the effect of cranberry on NAFLD, which is one of the manifestations of metabolic syndrome in the liver. Histological analysis of the liver revealed that lipid-droplet formation and hepatocyte ballooning, which are key NAFLD characteristics, were both drastically decreased in cranberry-supplemented-HFD-fed mice relative to the levels in HFD-fed control mice. Our results suggest that cranberry ameliorates HFD-induced metabolic disturbances, particularly during the early treatment stage, and exhibits considerable potential for preventing the progression of NAFLD.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Ecological approaches to dental caries prevention play a key role in attaining long-term control over the disease and maintaining a symbiotic oral microbiome. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to investigate the microbial ecological effects of 2 interventional dentifrices: a casein phosphopeptide-amorphous calcium phosphate (CPP-ACP) dentifrice and the same dentifrice supplemented with a polyphenol-rich cranberry extract. METHODS: The interventional toothpastes were compared with each other and with an active control fluoride dentifrice in a double-blinded randomized controlled trial. Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) analysis was used to determine changes in the bacterial loads of 14 key bacterial species (8 caries associated and 6 health associated) in the dental plaque of trial participants after they used the dentifrices for 5 to 6 wk. RESULTS: From the baseline to the recall visit, significant differences were observed between the treatment groups in the bacterial loads of 2 caries-associated bacterial species (Streptococcus mutans [P < 0.001] and Veillonella parvula [P < 0.001]) and 3 health-associated bacterial species (Corynebacterium durum [P = 0.008], Neisseria flavescens [P = 0.005], and Streptococcus sanguinis [P < 0.001]). Compared to the fluoride control dentifrice, the CPP-ACP dentifrice demonstrated significant differences for S. mutans (P = 0.032), C. durum (P = 0.007), and S. sanguinis (P < 0.001), while combination CPP-ACP-cranberry dentifrice showed significant differences for S. mutans (P < 0.001), V. parvula (P < 0.001), N. flavescens (P = 0.003), and S. sanguinis (P < 0.001). However, no significant differences were observed in the bacterial load comparisons between the CPP-ACP and combination dentifrices for any of the targeted bacterial species (P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the results indicate that dentifrices containing CPP-ACP and polyphenol-rich cranberry extracts can influence a species-level shift in the ecology of the oral microbiome, resulting in a microbial community less associated with dental caries (Australian New Zealand Clinical Trial Registry ANZCTR 12618000095268). KNOWLEDGE TRANSFER STATEMENT: The results of this randomized controlled trial indicate that dentifrices containing casein phosphopeptide-amorphous calcium phosphate (CPP-ACP) and polyphenol-rich cranberry extracts were able to beneficially modulate the microbial ecology of dental plaque in a group of high caries-risk patients. This could contribute toward lowering the risk of developing new caries lesions, an important goal sought by patients, clinicians, and policy makers.",

      "abstract": "Non-typhoidal Salmonella enterica serovars continue to be an important food safety issue worldwide. Cranberry (Vaccinium macrocarpon Ait) fruits possess antimicrobial properties due to their various acids and phenolic compounds; however, the underlying mechanism of actions is poorly understood. We evaluated the effects of cranberry extracts on the growth rate of Salmonella enterica serovars Typhimurium, Enteritidis and Heidelberg and on the transcriptomic profile of Salmonella Enteritidis to gain insight into phenotypic and transcriptional changes induced by cranberry extracts on this pathogen. An ethanolic extract from cranberry pomaces (KCOH) and two of its sub-fractions, anthocyanins (CRFa20) and non-anthocyanin polyphenols (CRFp85), were used. The minimum inhibitory (MICs) and bactericidal (MBCs) concentrations of these fractions against tested pathogens were obtained using the broth micro-dilution method according to the Clinical Laboratory Standard Institute's guidelines. Transcriptional profiles of S. Enteritidis grown in cation-adjusted Mueller-Hinton broth supplemented with or without 2 or 4 mg/ml of KCOH were compared by RNASeq to reveal gene modulations serving as markers for biological activity. The MIC and MBC values of KCOH were 8 and 16 mg/mL, respectively, against all tested S. enterica isolates. The MIC value was 4 mg/mL for both CRFa20 and CRFp85 sub-fractions, and a reduced MBC value was obtained for CRFp85 (4 mg/ml). Treatment of S. Enteritidis with KCOH revealed a concentration-dependent transcriptional signature. Compared to the control, 2 mg/ml of KCOH exposure resulted in 89 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), of which 53 and 36 were downregulated and upregulated, respectively. The upregulated genes included those involved in citrate metabolism, enterobactin synthesis and transport, and virulence. Exposure to 4 mg/ml KCOH led to the modulated expression of 376 genes, of which 233 were downregulated and 143 upregulated, which is 4.2 times more DEGs than from exposure to 2 mg/ml KCOH. The downregulated genes were related to flagellar motility, Salmonella Pathogenicity Island-1 (SPI-1), cell wall/membrane biogenesis, and transcription. Moreover, genes involved in energy production and conversion, carbohydrate transport and metabolism, and coenzyme transport and metabolism were upregulated during exposure to 4 mg/ml KCOH. Overall, 57 genes were differentially expressed (48 downregulated and 9 upregulated) in response to both concentrations. Both concentrations of KCOH downregulated expression of hilA, which is a major SPI-1 transcriptional regulator. This study provides information on the response of Salmonella exposed to cranberry extracts, which could be used in the control of this important foodborne pathogen.",
