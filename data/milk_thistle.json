      "abstract": "Milk thistle, Silybum marianum (L.), is a well-known medicinal plant used for the treatment of liver diseases due to its high content of silymarin. The seeds contain elaiosome, a fleshy structure attached to the seeds, which is believed to be a rich source of many metabolites including silymarin. Segmentation of elaiosomes using only image analysis is difficult, and this makes it impossible to quantify the elaiosome phenotypes. This study proposes a new approach for semi-automated detection and segmentation of elaiosomes in milk thistle seed using the Detectron2 deep learning algorithm. One hundred manually labeled images were used to train the initial elaiosome detection model. This model was used to predict elaiosome from new datasets, and the precise predictions were manually selected and used as new labeled images for retraining the model. Such semi-automatic image labeling, i.e., using the prediction results of the previous stage for retraining the model, allowed the production of sufficient labeled data for retraining. Finally, a total of 6,000 labeled images were used to train Detectron2 for elaiosome detection and attained a promising result. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of Detectron2 in detecting milk thistle seed elaiosomes with an accuracy of 99.9%. The proposed method automatically detects and segments elaiosome from the milk thistle seed. The predicted mask images of elaiosome were used to analyze its area as one of the seed phenotypic traits along with other seed morphological traits by image-based high-throughput phenotyping in ImageJ. Enabling high-throughput phenotyping of elaiosome and other seed morphological traits will be useful for breeding milk thistle cultivars with desirable traits."

      "abstract": "Silybum marianum, known as milk thistle (MT), is traditionally used to manage liver diseases. This study aimed to investigate the role of MT extract topical application as a potential treatment for imiquimod (IMQ)-induced psoriatic lesions in mice with particular emphasis on phosphoinositol-3 Kinase (PI3K)/ protein kinase B (AKT)/ mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (KEAP1)/ nuclear factor erythroid-2-related factor (NRF2)/ nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) molecular cascades involvement. To address this aim, forty male Swiss albino mice were subdivided into four groups (n = 10 mice/group): control, IMQ model, standard group where mice were treated topically with IMQ, then the anti-psoriatic mometasone cream, and MT extract-treated group where mice were treated topically with IMQ followed by MT extract. In most measured parameters, MT extract, rich in silymarin, exhibited potent anti-psoriatic activity comparable to the standard cortisone treatment. MT extract mitigated dorsal skin erythema, scaling, and epidermal thickening, reflected by lowering the Psoriasis Area Severity Index (PASI) score. Moreover, it alleviated IMQ-induced splenomegaly. Mechanistically, the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway was the main functional pathway behind such improvements, where it was significantly inhibited by MT extract application. This led to NRF2 activation via KEAP1 downregulation with subsequent anti-inflammatory effect proven by reducing NF-κB, interleukin (IL)-23, and IL-17A and antioxidant ability proven by boosting the antioxidant glutathione and heme oxygenase-1. Such improvements were confirmed by alleviating the histopathological alteration. Thus, MT extract could be a promising therapeutic agent for psoriasis treatment by inhibiting PI3K/AKT/mTOR cascade, along with NRF2 signaling activation.",

      "abstract": "Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a chronic condition caused by several factors including thermally oxidized tallow. Various strategies have been considered to ameliorate NAFLD. However, the role of milk thistle (MT) in ameliorating NAFLD caused by thermally oxidized tallow has not been reported. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the ability of milk thistle to protect rabbits from the toxicity of oxidized tallow (OT). The rabbits were given OT and an extract of MT. The composition of MT was analyzed using HPLC-DAD, and tallow samples were studied using GC-MS. The study also examined liver histology, antioxidant levels, liver-related inflammatory markers, and serum lipid profile. The results showed that the major components of the MT extract were silybin B, formononetin-glucuronic acid, proanthocyanidin B1, silychristin B, silydianin, and isosilybin A. The group given OT showed elevated lipid profiles, lower antioxidant status, higher levels of hepatic inflammatory markers, and lower levels of anti-inflammatory markers. This group also had higher fat storage in the liver compared to the control or treatment groups. However, when MT was supplemented, the pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1, IL-4, IL-6, and TNF-α) and antioxidant status (CAT, SOD, GSH-Px, GSH, and TBARS) of the liver returned to normal. This suggests that MT extract is an excellent source of hepatoprotective compounds. It protects the liver by increasing antioxidant enzymes, decreasing pro-inflammatory cytokines, and increasing anti-inflammatory markers."

      "abstract": "Silibinin, or silybin, is a polyphenolic flavonoid and the main active component of silymarin, isolated from the seeds of the milk thistle plant (Silybum marianum). It has been shown to have antioxidant, antineoplastic, hepatoprotective, neuroprotective, anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, and antidiabetic effects. In this systematic review, a literature search was conducted from inception until January 2024 on major electronic databases (PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar) to identify studies assessing the effects of silibinin on diabetes and its associated complications in different molecular, cellular, animal, and clinical studies. Silibinin has been shown to improve diabetic conditions through a variety of mechanisms, including reducing insulin resistance (IR), lowering reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, and affecting glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, and glycogenolysis. Silibinin treatment reduced blood glucose (BG) levels, oxidative stress markers, and inflammatory cytokines while increasing glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1C) and antioxidative marker levels in various cellular and animal models of diabetes. It also ameliorated levels of triglyceride (TG), cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and high-density lipoprotein (HDL). Furthermore, silibinin has been identified as an effective treatment for diabetic complications, including hepatic damage, endothelial dysfunction, neuropathy, nephropathy, retinopathy, and osteoporosis. The promising anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antidiabetic, and insulin-sensitizing activities of silibinin were also supported in clinical studies. The administration of silibinin could possess multiple protective impacts in improving DM and its complications. Nevertheless, further well-designed investigations are necessary to better understand its mechanisms.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Data on the pharmacological treatment of gambling disorder are limited. Silymarin (derived from milk thistle) has antioxidant properties. The goal of the current study was to determine the efficacy and tolerability of silymarin in adults with gambling disorder. METHODS: Forty-three individuals (18 [41.9%] women; mean age=49.61 [±13.1] years) with gambling disorder entered an 8-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Dosing of silymarin ranged from 150 to 300 mg twice a day. The primary outcome measure was the Yale Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale Modified for Pathological Gambling (PG-YBOCS). Secondary outcome measures comprised the Gambling Symptom Assessment Scale and measures of depression and anxiety. Outcomes were examined using mixed-effect models. RESULTS: Silymarin did not statistically differentiate from the placebo on any of the outcome measures of interest, in terms of treatment group×time interactions. There was a robust response in the placebo group (57% reduction on the PG-YBOCS), and on average there was a 56% reduction in YBOCS score for the milk thistle. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this study do not support the use of silymarin/milk thistle in the treatment of gambling disorder but highlight the large placebo response seen in gambling disorder. Treatment interventions for gambling disorder need to better understand and address the placebo response. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02337634.",

      "abstract": "The trail aimed to explore the effect of dietary supplementation of Milk Thistle (MT) extract on growth performance and health status of growing rabbits exposed to serve heat stress condition, considering the economic efficiency of supplementation. A total of 96 weaned male rabbits were divided into 4 groups (24 rabbits/group). The first group received the basal diet without any supplementation and served as a control (MT0), while 2nd, 3rd and 4th groups supplemented with MT at levels of 5 (MT5), 10 (MT10) and 15 (MT15) g/kg diet, respectively, for 10 consecutive weeks. Both of growth performance and feed utilisation were significantly enhanced by the dietary treatment, the optimum dose of MT was 12 g/kg diet for average daily gain, specific growth rate and performance index. However, it was 13 g/kg diet for feed conversation ratio. The polynomial regression analysis showed that the lowest values of rectal temperature and respiration rate were observed at doses of 11 and 13 g/kg diet respectively. The dressing percentage and the relative weights of liver and total edible giblets were significantly improved by the treatment (p = 0.0416, 0.0112 and 0.0032, respectively), maximising in the MT10 group. The MT10 and MT15 groups showed higher erythrocytes and leucocytes counts and lower levels of urea, creatinine and total cholesterol compared to the control (p < 0.05). Liver functions significantly enhanced in aforementioned two treated groups, the liver ultrastructure represented normal cytoplasmic organelles, and nucleus and mitochondria in MT10 group, while the MT15 group showed hepatocytes with dilated nucleus with most cytoplasmic organelles appeared well organised and normal except few small cytoplasms vacuolated. The levels glutathione, superoxide dismutase, catalase and total antioxidant capacity as well as immunoglobulin M, and immunoglobulin G significant improved in the MT-Treated groups compared to the control (p < 0.05). Economically, MT supplemented diets improved the net revenue of fattened rabbits during the summer season. In conclusion, the supplementation of MT extract at levels of 10 or 15 g/kg diet enhanced growth performance, feed utilisation, dressing percentage, hemato-biochemical attributes, immunity and redox balance of heat stressed growing rabbits during the hot season.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) is a prevalent form of liver cancer that causes significant mortality in numerous individuals worldwide. This study compared the effects of milk thistle (MT) and nano-milk thistle (N-MT) on the expression of the genes that participate in apoptosis and cell cycle pathways in Huh-7 and HepG2 cells. METHODS: IC50 values of MT and N-MT were determined using the MTT assay. Huh-7 and HepG2 cell lines (containing mutant and wild-type TP53 gene, respectively) were incubated with MT and N-MT for 24h and 48h and the impact of MT and N-MT on the proliferation of these cell lines was evaluated through a comparative analysis. Cell cycle and apoptosis were assessed by flow cytometry after 24h and 48h treatment in the cell lines mentioned. Real-time PCR was used to analyze miR-155-3p, PHLDA1, SOCS2, TP53, P21, BAX, and BCL-2 expression in the cell lines that were being treated. RESULTS: N-MT reduces cancer cell growth in a time and concentration-dependent manner, which is more toxic compared to MT. Huh-7 was observed to have IC50 values of 2.35 and 1.7 μg/ml at 24h and 48h, and HepG2 was observed to have IC50 values of 3.4 and 2.6 μg/ml at 24 and 48h, respectively. N-MT arrested Huh-7 and HepG2 cells in the Sub-G1 phase and induced apoptosis. N-MT led to a marked reduction in the expression of miR-155-3p and BCL-2 after 24h and 48h treatments. Conversely, PHLDA1, SOCS2, BAX, and P21 were upregulated in the treated cells compared to untreated cells, which suggests that milk thistle has the potential to regulate these genes. N-MT reduced the expression of TP53 in Huh-7 cells after mentioned time points, while there was a significant increase in the expression of the TP53 gene in HepG2 cells. No gene expression changes were observed in MT-treated cells after 24h and 48h. CONCLUSION: N-MT can regulate cancer cell death by arresting cell cycle and inducing apoptosis. This occurs through the alteration of apoptotic genes expression. A reduction in the expression of miR-155-3p and increase in the expression of SOCS2 and PHLDA1 after N-MT treatment showed the correlation between miR-155-3p and PHLDA1/SOCS2 found in bioinformatics analysis. While N-MT increased TP53 expression in HepG2, reduced it in Huh-7. The findings indicate that N-MT can function intelligently in cancer cells and can be a helpful complement to cancer treatment.",

      "abstract": "Milk thistle (Silybum marianum (L.) Gaertn.) is among the top-selling botanicals used as a supportive treatment for liver diseases. Silymarin, a mixture of unique flavonolignan metabolites, is the main bioactive component of milk thistle. The biological activities of silymarin have been well described in the literature, and its use is considered safe and well-tolerated in appropriate doses. However, commercial preparations do not always contain the recommended concentrations of silymarin, failing to provide the expected therapeutic effect. While the poor quality of raw material may explain the low concentrations of silymarin, its deliberate removal is suspected to be an adulteration. Toxic contaminants and foreign matters were also detected in milk thistle preparations, raising serious health concerns. Standard methods for determination of silymarin components include thin-layer chromatography (TLC), high-performance thin-layer chromatography (HPTLC), and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with various detectors, but nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC) have also been applied. This review surveys the extraction techniques of main milk thistle metabolites and the quality, efficacy, and safety of the derived food supplements. Advanced analytical authentication approaches are discussed with a focus on DNA barcoding and metabarcoding to complement orthogonal chemical characterization and fingerprinting of herbal products."

Conventional studies have focused on the extraction of silybin with organic reagents, which was inapplicable to the food industry. This study aims to develop a fermented milk containing silybin and protein from the milk thistle seeds. A three step procedure was developed, comprising homogenization of milk thistle seeds, NaHCO3 heat treatment, and microbial fermentation. The silybin was characterized by high performance liquid chromatography, and the protein was quantified and electrophorized. It was found that the homogenization step was essential for the preparation of protein, and the NaHCO3 heat treatment was the crucial step in obtaining silybin. The optimal NaHCO3 treatment settings were 1% NaHCO3, 60°C, and 3 h, and the optimal strains for microbial fermentation were L131 (Rummeliibacillus stabekisii) and RS72 (Lactobacillus plantarum). The silybin yield in the fermented milk reached 11.24-12.14 mg/g seeds, accounting for 72.6-78.4% of the total silybin in the milk thistle seeds, and the protein yield reached 121.8-129.6 mg/g seeds. The fermented milk had a slightly sweet yoghurt-like flavor and could be used as a dietary supplement for silybin and protein."

Female White Hungarian ducks were randomly allocated to four dietary treatments consisting of the control diet (C), the control diet supplemented with 0.5% MS, 0.5% MSC, or 0.1% MO. The feeding of experimental diets did not result in mortality cases, clinical signs of mycotoxicosis, or in differences of clinical chemistry values of blood serum. The positive effect of MO on vacuolar hepatocyte degeneration exceeded that of the MSC on d14 and both MS and MSC on d42. Each treatment was equally effective in the decrease of the severity of solitary cell death and infiltration of lympho- and histiocytes in the liver on d28 as well as in the prevention of lymphocyte depletion in the spleen and bursa of Fabricius on d14. In conclusion, the applied treatments have been proven effective in the prevention of histopathological changes caused by DON and ZEN."

This patent review presents and discusses recent patents concerning the anticancer effects of S. marianum and silymarin. The data were gathered by searching an extensive literature review conducted in Google Scholar, PubMed, Scopus, Google Patent, Patent Scope, and US Patent. Milk thistle and silymarin have been used in a variety of medical, therapeutic, and pharmaceutical fields, according to a large number of documents and patents. Milk thistle and silymarin have been used as complementary treatments for cancers such as skin, prostate, and colorectal cancers, as well as hepatoprotective agents. Silymarin exerts a chemopreventive effect on reactivating cell death pathways by modulation of the antiapoptotic proteins and synergizing with agonists of death domain receptors. Based on the results of these patents, silymarin could be beneficial to oncology patients, especially for the treatment of the side effects of anticancer chemotherapeutics. Following the human propensity to use phytocompounds rather than medicines based on chemical constituents, special attention must be paid to tie the value of milk thistle and silymarin from basic science to clinical applications."

      "abstract": "Milk thistle, Silybum marianum, is a medicinal plant grown for its bioactive compounds with well-documented antioxidant and hepatoprotective properties. Milk thistle has a well-established pharmacological reputation for treatments of human liver disease, but it is also used in animals. This review summarizes the experimental evidence of milk thistle's effects on animals when administered as silymarin extract (feed additive) or a feed ingredient, if administered as seed or expeller/cake with the seed residue still containing the bioactive components. The use as a feed additive or feed ingredient is motivated by the complexity of silymarin registration as a veterinary drug. In farm animals, the drug improves the animals' performance and product quality and oxidative stability, supports liver function during the productive life-cycle, improves gut-health and morphology, and can reduce intestinal pathogens. In dogs and cats, the treatment is focused on acute and chronic liver diseases including the detoxification processes and support of drug treatments including chemotherapy. In equine athletes, milk seed cake showed positive effects and a faster return of cortisol to the resting values before exercise occurred. In aquaculture, it confirms its usefulness in supporting animal health and performance. In certain studies it is not clear what has been administered, and the composition and doses are not always clearly reported. A few studies reported no effects, but none reported problems connected to milk thistle administration. However, the overall picture shows that the use of milk thistle results in improved or restored health parameters or better animal performance.",

At present, since no Food and Drug Association (FDA) approved medication exists for NAFLD patients, bariatric surgery is indicated for the significant improvement in obesity-related comorbidities, such as NAFLD. However, alternative therapy is emerging to manage NAFLD. Problematically, many patients taking herbal remedies, such as Silymarin (milk thistle), with little/no understanding of its purported properties. METHODS: Fifty-two morbidly-obese (47.84 ± 6.48 kg m-2) patient candidates (mean age: 38.90 ± 10.28 years; n = 41 women and 11 men) for bariatric surgery with NAFLD were randomly assigned to determine the efficacy of eight weeks of Silymarin supplementation (140 mg four times daily for a total of 560 mg) on the aspartate transaminase (AST)/alanine transaminase (ALT) (AST/ALT) ratio, Fibrosis-4 (Fib-4) score, NAFLD score, sonographic grading, and fibroscan stages of NAFLD. RESULTS: Significant (p ≤ 0.05) improvements were found in AST/ALT ratio, BMI and sonographic grading. No significant change was found for fibroscan staging, Fib-4, and NAFLD scores. CONCLUSION: Silymarin improved ultrasound fatty liver grading and liver enzymes morbidly-obese patient candidates for bariatric surgery with NAFLD after only eight weeks, without any adverse effects."

The present study investigated the protective effects and possible mechanisms of milk thistle (Silybum marianum L.) and artichoke (Cynara scolymus L.) in treating NAFLD in type 2 diabetic rats. METHODS: The NAFLD was established in rats after four weeks of type 2 diabetes induction. The animals were treated with pharmaceutical preparations of milk thistle (Livergol®) and artichoke (Atheromod-B®) extracts for eight weeks. After the end of the intervention, oral glucose tolerance, the serum parameters of oxidative stress, liver functional tests, and lipid profiles were evaluated. Histopathological changes were assessed by hematoxylin and eosin staining. RESULTS: Treatment with preparations of milk thistle and artichoke nonsignificantly improved glucose tolerance in diabetic rats. Both preparations significantly improved serum superoxide dismutase activity and the level of malondialdehyde. Although treatment with milk thistle reduced serum activity of aspartate aminotransferase and serum levels of triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol, artichoke extracts only attenuated the serum level of TG. Milk thistle also effectively protected the liver from histological changes. CONCLUSIONS: Milk thistle could be a promising pharmacological option for the treatment of NAFLD. Nonetheless, long-term randomized clinical trials are necessary to confirm the observed results.",

      "abstract": "Cadmium (Cd+2) is a potential and widespread toxic environmental pollutant, mainly derived from a rapid industrial process that has inhibitory effects on growth, physiological, and biochemical attributes of various plant species, including medicinal plants such as Silybum marianum L. Gaertn commonly known as milk thistle. Plant signaling molecules, when applied exogenously, help to enhance/activate endogenous biosynthesis of potentially important signaling molecules and antioxidants that boost tolerance against various abiotic stresses, e.g., heavy metal stress. The present study documented the protective role of salicylic acid (SA;0.25 μM) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2; 10 μM) priming, foliar spray, and combinational treatments in reducing Cd+2 toxicity (500 μM) in milk thistle grown at two diverse ecological zones of Balochistan Province of Pakistan i.e., Quetta (Qta) and Turbat (Tbt). The morpho-physiological and biochemical attributes of milk thistle were significantly affected by Cd+2 toxicity; however, priming and foliar spray of SA and H2O2 significantly improved the growth attributes (root/shoot length, leaf area, and root/shoot fresh and dry weight), photosynthetic pigments (Chl a, b, and carotenoids) and secondary metabolites (Anthocyanin, Soluble phenolics, and Tannins) at both altitudes by suppressing the negative impact of Cd+2. However, the oxidative damage parameters, i.e., MDA and H2O2, decreased astonishingly under the treatment of signaling molecules, thereby protecting membrane integrity under Cd+2 stress. The morphological variations were profound at the low altitude (Tbt) as compared to the high altitude (Qta). Interestingly, the physiological and biochemical attributes at both altitudes improved under SA and H2O2 treatments, thus hampered the toxic effect of Cd+2. These signaling compounds enhanced tolerance of plants under heavy metal stress conditions with the consideration of altitudinal, and ambient temperature variations remain to be the key concerns."

The main phytochemical extract of the milk thistle plant is silymarin. It has optimistic, protective, and therapeutic properties. However, evidence about the role of milk thistle extracts in oral diseases is lacking. HIGHLIGHT: The pharmacology of milk thistle was overviewed. The role of the plant in some systemic diseases was reviewed. Furthermore, its role in various oral diseases was discussed. The presented articles described such effects in the context of periodontal disease, dental caries, oral candidiasis, oral lichen planus, oral cancer, and oral mucositis. Results on the promising effects of milk thistle extracts with a preference for silymarin were presented from different research designs. A summary of the previously used doses and the currently available pharmaceutical products was proposed for future research. CONCLUSION: Milk thistle has antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anticancer, antifungal, immunomodulatory, and other properties. The evidence from human research about the role of milk thistle in oral diseases is limited. Further studies, particularly clinical trials, to test milk thistle either as a potential treatment modality or a supplementary therapy for oral diseases on higher levels would be useful in the future.",

In this study four milk thistle ecotypes from Faisalabad (FSD), Gujranwala (GUJ), Quetta (QTA), and Kallar kahar (KK) having an altered achene color were analyzed under salt stress. Application of plant growth promoters (PGPs) is one of the solution for ameliorating the effect of salinity and increasing the quantity and quality traits of milk thistle, so ascorbic acid (AsA), thiourea (TU), and moringa leaf extract (MLE) were soil supplied after developing salinity stress (120 mM with irrigation) at germination stage. Predetermined levels were selected for PGPs such as AsA (500 µM), MLE (3%), and TU (250 µM). Results revealed that all yield related attributes were significantly decreased, while secondary metabolites, pericarp epidermis, pericarp parenchyma, and pericarp seed integument increased under salinity stress. Data suggested that PGPs treatment was helpful to alleviate the deleterious effects of salinity stress and enhance the milk thistle quality and quantity parameters.

In this work, we aimed to study the ability of 7β-hydroxycholesterol (7β-OHC) to trigger oxidative stress and cell death in human neuroblastoma cells (SH-SY5Y) then the capacity of Nigella sativa and Milk thistle seed oils (NSO and MTSO, respectively) to oppose 7β-OHC-induced side effects. The impact of 7β-OHC, associated or not with NSO or MTSO, was studied on different criteria: cell viability; redox status, and apoptosis. Oxidative stress was assessed through the intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, levels of enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidants, lipid, and protein oxidation products. Our results indicate that 7β-OHC (40 µg/mL) exhibit pr-oxidative and pro-apoptotic activities shown by a decrease of the antioxidant enzymatic activities and an increase of ROS production, lipid, and protein oxidation end products as well as nitrotyrosine formation and caspase 3 activation. However, under the pre-treatment with NSO, and especially with MTSO (100 µg/mL), a marked attenuation of oxidative damages was observed. Our study suggests harmful effects of 7β-OHC consisting of pro-oxidative, anti-proliferative, and pro-apoptotic activities that may contribute to neurodegeneration. NSO and especially MTSO showed potential cytoprotection against the cytotoxicity of 7β-OHC.",

All ten horses received one feeding form before the beginning of the experimental monitoring. All horses were exposed to heavy physical exercise (regular combined driving training) after 56 days of milk thistle seed cakes feeding (up to 400 g/day). Three blood samples were taken (before physical exercise; about 15 min and 60 min after physical exercise). Significant differences (p < 0.05) were detected in the values of AST, NEFA, cortisol and Pi in the experimental group. The exercise effect was detected in the values of albumin, lactate, cortisol, NEFA, and calcium.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Tuberculosis is an infectious disease caused by mycobacterium tuberculosis. It may occur in multiple parts and organs of the patients body, and the lung is the most common. It is a major health threat worldwide. Hepatotoxicity is a common adverse reaction of commonly used clinical anti-tuberculosis drugs, as well as one of the important factors leading to poor prognosis of tuberculosis. Milk thistle is a traditional Chinese medicine extract derived from the mature fruit of Silybum marianum. Clinical practice shows that milk thistle has a good anti-liver injury effect and can be used to prevent anti-tuberculosis drug-induced liver injury. However, there is a lack of evidence-based medicine. The research carried out in this protocol is to systematically evaluate the efficacy and safety of milk thistle preventive treatment of anti-tuberculosis drug-induced liver injury, and to improve the evidence-based basis for clinical application of milk thistle in the preventive treatment of anti-tuberculosis drug-induced liver injury. METHOD: Computer search of English databases (PubMed, the Cochrane Library, Embase, Web of Science) and Chinese databases (CNKI, VIP, Wanfang, China Biology Medicine disc (CBMdisc)) was performed. From the establishment of database to October 2020, 2 researchers independently extracted and evaluated the data included in the randomized controlled clinical research of milk thistle preventive treatment of anti-tuberculosis drug-induced liver injury, and used RevMan5.3 software to conduct a meta-analysis of the included literature. RESULT: In this research, the efficacy and safety of milk thistle preventive treatment of anti-tuberculosis drug-induced liver injury were evaluated by indicators such as the incidence of liver injury, bilirubin levels, and liver enzyme levels. CONCLUSION: In this research, reliable evidence-based evidence for the clinical application of milk thistle in the preventive treatment of anti-tuberculosis drug-induced liver injury was provided.

      "abstract": "The consumption of herbal-based supplements, which are believed to have beneficial effects on human health with no side effects, has become popular around the world and this trend is still increasing. Silybum marianum (L.) Gaertn, commonly known as milk thistle (MT), is the most commonly studied herb associated with the treatment of liver diseases. The hepatoprotective effects of active substances in silymarin, with silybin being the main compound, have been demonstrated in many studies. However, MT can be affected by toxigenic micro-fungi and contaminated by mycotoxins with adverse effects. The beneficial effect of silymarin can thus be reduced or totally antagonized by mycotoxins. MT has proven to be affected by micro-fungi of the Fusarium and Alternaria genera, in particular, and their mycotoxins. Alternariol-methyl-ether (AME), alternariol (AOH), beauvericin (BEA), deoxynivalenol (DON), enniatin A (ENNA), enniatin A1 (ENNA1), enniatin B (ENNB), enniatin B1 (ENNB1), HT-2 toxin (HT-2), T-2 toxin (T-2), tentoxin (TEN), and zearalenone (ZEA) seem to be most significant in MT-based dietary supplements. This review focuses on summarizing cases of mycotoxins in MT to emphasize the need for strict monitoring and regulation, as mycotoxins in relation with MT-based dietary supplements are not covered by European Union legislation.",

      "abstract": "Milk thistle cold press oil (MTO) is an herbal remedy derived from Silybum marianum which contains a low level of silymarin and mixture of polyphenols and flavonoids. The effect of MTO on the cardiovascular and metabolic complications of obesity was studied in mice that were fed a high-fat diet (HFD) for 20 weeks and treated with MTO for the final 8 weeks of the diet. MTO treatment attenuated HFD-induced obesity, fasting hyperglycemia, hypertension, and induced markers of mitochondrial fusion and browning of white adipose. Markers of inflammation were also attenuated in both adipose and the liver of MTO-treated mice. In addition, MTO resulted in the improvement of liver fibrosis. These results demonstrate that MTO has beneficial actions to attenuate dietary obesity-induced weight gain, hyperglycemia, hypertension, inflammation, and suggest that MTO supplementation may prove beneficial to patients exhibiting symptoms of metabolic syndrome. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Natural supplements are increasingly being considered as potential therapies for many chronic cardiovascular and metabolic diseases. Milk thistle cold press oil (MTO) is derived from Silybum marianum which is used as a dietary supplement in different parts of the world. The results of the present study demonstrate that MTO supplementation normalizes several metabolic and cardiovascular complications arising from dietary-induced obesity. MTO supplementation also had anti-inflammatory actions in the adipose as well as the liver. These results suggest that supplementation of MTO into the diet of obese individuals may afford protection against the worsening of cardiovascular and metabolic disease and improve inflammation and liver fibrosis.",

      "abstract": "The Fusarium mycotoxins deoxynivalenol (DON) and zearalenone (ZEA) frequently contaminate grain crops, especially maize, the basis of poultry's feed. Mycotoxins enter the food chain and induce pathological changes in edible tissues. Milk thistle (Silybum marianum) has been used for the treatment of liver disease in humans because of its antioxidant and hepatoprotective effects, but its utility in veterinary use is poorly examined. To investigate possible protective properties against mycotoxin caused oxidative stress in poultry, pressed form of milk thistle seed (0.5%) was tested in white, female, Hungarian ducks over a feeding period of 47 days. Ducks were separated into 3 groups. The first group was fed with normal diet. The second group was fed with normal diet contaminated with DON (4.9 mg/kg) and ZEA (0.66 mg/kg). The third group received mycotoxin contaminated feed with milk thistle supplementation. Histological examination, markers of the redox status and metal element concentration measurements were carried out. The results showed alterations in the histological examination and in the redox homeostasis markers as a short-term effect by strengthening the antioxidant system. Acute exposure of mycotoxins caused an oxidative stress, which induced an effective antioxidant defensive response of the organism indicated by the free sulfhydryl group content (from 0.72 ± 0.06 to 0.77 ± 0.11) and the reducing power (0.49 ± 0.06 to 0.52 ± 0.08) elevation. The short-term free radical injury may be compensated by the liver resulting in decreased lipid peroxidation markers (malondialdehyde concentration: from 16.86 ± 0.49 to 0.94 ± 0.15, conjugated diene concentration: from 0.21 ± 0.07 to 0.17 ± 0.03). Silymarin further strengthtened the antioxidant defense by the elevation of sulfhydryl groups concentration and reducing power property resulted in decreased total scavenger capacity. However the concentration of lipid peroxidation markers were further elevated by the used antioxidant treatment (MDA: 5.2 ± 0.35, DC: 0.26 ± 0.08). In conclusion, the mycotoxin-contamination activated effectively the antioxidant system. The milk thistle supplementation has cytoprotective effects according to the histological findings, activated the antioxidant system, however the elevation of lipid peroxidation products need further explanation.",

The antioxidant and anti-apoptotic potential of Silybum marianum is used along with vancomycin to reduce adverse effects on the kidney. Vero cells (monkey kidney cells) and mice were used to test S. marianum extract on vancomycin induced nephrotoxicity. Vero cells were treated with different concentrations of vancomycin and S. marianum for 24 h for determination of cytotoxic potential and mRNA levels of apoptotic genes p53 , p21, and cyt-c were measured. For in-vivo studies mice were divided into five groups; G1 control (untreated), G2 vehicle (olive oil), G3 vancomycin treated (300 mg/kg body weight), G4 (S. marianum; 400 mg/kg bodyweight and vancomycin 300 mg/kg bodyweight simultaneously) and G5 (S. marianum 400 mg/kg bodyweight and vancomycin 300 mg/kg bodyweight treatment started after day 4 of S. marianum treatment). After 10 days histopathological analysis of mice kidneys was performed, serum urea and creatinine were analysed and mRNA expression of p53 , p21, and cyt-c was evaluated. Expression of p53, p21, and cyt-c in Vero cells was elevated in response to vancomycin treatment, whereas after S. marianum administration expression of these genes reduced. Vancomycin showed apoptosis in cells at the concentration of 6 mg/ml (LC50). Urea and creatinine levels in mice were increased in response to vancomycin administration and kidney histology showed an abnormality in functional units. The apoptotic cells were very visible in kidney structure in vancomycin treated group. These symptoms were however relieved in groups where treatment of S. marianum extract was given. mRNA expression of p53 , p21, and cyt-c also reduced in S. marianum treated groups of mice. S. marianum extract has protective effects against renal damage from vancomycin induced oxidative stress and relieves symptoms may be by downregulating apoptotic genes.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: This paper presents a peculiar first case of an allergy to Silybum marianum (milk thistle) and Eragrostis tef (teff). Both teff and milk thistle have been presented in the literature (both domestic and foreign) in a positive light, the former as a new part of gluten-free diet, and the latter as a treatment for a number of conditions, particularly those of the liver. CASE PRESENTATION: A 29-year-old male presented at our clinic due to an episode of itching and burning in his mouth, swollen tongue, and difficulty swallowing following ingestion of teff flakes. He also reported sneezing, runny nose, watering and burning eyes, and wheezing following inhalation exposure to ground milk thistle. The patient's occupation is associated with exposure to these allergens. The patient underwent comprehensive allergy diagnostic assessments (including skin-prick testing, serum specific IgE levels, Faber test, spirometry, and acoustic rhinometry) and gastroenterological assessments. The diagnosis was established on skin tests with native allergens (milk thistle 16/35, teff flour 22/60, negative control 0/0, histamine 3/5) provided by the patient. There are no commercially available (standardized) tests for milk thistle or teff either in Poland or anywhere else in the world. CONCLUSIONS: Milk thistle is available in the form of dry, finely-ground preparations (which are used as additives to bread, soups, and yoghurts) and extracts (which are used as ingredients in over-the-counter herbal remedies). Teff is a gluten-free cereal whose grains are rich in methionine, calcium, iron, folic acid, and antioxidants. This case report presents milk thistle and teff as potentially new allergens. A literature review revealed no similar allergy cases in Poland or elsewhere in the world."

Results showed that overall feed intake, body weight, feed conversion ratio (FCR), and dressing percentage were significantly (P < 0.5) higher with MT-15 as compared with the other experimental treatments. Unlikely, significantly lower level of malondialdehyde (MDA) was observed with MT-15. Dietary supplementation of MT had no significant effect on paraoxonase activity in broiler.

      "abstract": "Herbal-based dietary supplements have become increasingly popular. The extract from milk thistle (Silybum marianum), is often used for the treatment of liver diseases. However, serious concerns exist regarding the efficacy, composition, as well as the safety of these over-the-counter preparations. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to investigate the composition as well as chemical and biological safety of 26 milk thistle-based dietary supplements purchased from both the U.S. and Czech markets between 2016 and 2017. The study was focused on a determination of the composition of active ingredients, as well as analyses of possible contaminants including: mycotoxins, plant alkaloids, and pesticide residues, as well as the microbial purity. High-throughput analyses were performed using advanced U-HPLC-HRMS techniques. Large differences in the silymarin content were observed among individual milk thistle preparations, often in contrast with the information provided by the manufacturers. In addition, substantial inter-batch differences in silymarin content were also demonstrated. In all milk thistle preparations tested, large numbers and high concentrations of mycotoxins and several pesticides, as well as the substantial presence of microbiological contamination were detected, pointing to serious safety issues. In conclusion, our results strongly indicate the need for strict controls of the composition, chemical contaminants, as well as the microbiological purity of commercial milk thistle extracts used for the treatment of liver diseases. Poor definition of these preparations together with contamination by biologically active substances may not only account for the inconsistency of clinical observations, but also be responsible for possible herbal-based dietary supplements-induced liver injury.",

We aimed to evaluate the effect of silymarin in the prevention of anti-TB DILI. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) up to 30th November 2018. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared silymarin and placebo to prevent anti-TB DILI were included. All statistical analyses were conducted using STATA 12.0 software. Standardized mean difference (SMD) and risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used to evaluate the effect of silymarin. The quality of included studies was assessed according to Cochrane handbook. Funnel plots and Egger's tests were carried out to evaluate publication bias. Sensitivity analysis was conducted to assess the influence of each study. RESULTS: A total of 1198 patients from five RCTs (585 with silymarin and 613 with placebo groups) were included. Overall, silymarin significantly reduced the occurrence of anti-TB DILI at week 4 [RR: 0.33, 95% CI (0.15, 0.75)]. In addition, silymarin exerted protective effect on liver function in patients undergoing anti-TB drugs [SMD = - 0.15, 95% CI (-0.24, -0.07), P < 0.001 (ALT); SMD =-0.14, 95% CI (-0.23, -0.06), P = 0.001(AST); SMD =-0.12, 95% CI (-0.20, -0.03), P = 0.008 (ALP)]. Silymarin led to similar AEs in placebo groups [OR: 1.09, 95% CI (0.86, 1.39), P = 0.47]. CONCLUSION: Prophylactic therapy of silymarin is contributed to a noticeably reduced risk of development of anti-TB DILI four weeks after the initiation. In addition, silymarin significantly improved the liver function in patients who are receiving anti-TB drugs.",

Milk thistle has antioxidant properties and showed promise in trichotillomania in a prior case report. The goal of the current study was to determine the efficacy and tolerability of silymarin in children and adults with trichotillomania. METHODS: Twenty individuals (19 [95.0%] women; 16 adults; mean age, 27.9 [11.5] years) with trichotillomania entered a 12-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study (6 weeks of milk thistle and 6 weeks of placebo with a 1-week wash-out in between). Dosing of milk thistle ranged from 150 mg twice a day to 300 mg twice a day. Subjects were assessed with the National Institute of Mental Health Trichotillomania Severity Scale (primary outcome), the Massachusetts General Hospital Hair Pulling Scale, Clinical Global Impression scale, and measures of depression, anxiety, and psychosocial functioning. Outcomes were examined using linear mixed models with a random intercept for subject and t tests. RESULTS: There were no statistically significant treatment type-by-time interactions for the main outcome measure, but significant effects were seen for secondary measures (eg, time spent pulling per day for the past week). From baseline to week 6, there was a significant decrease in Clinical Global Impression severity for the milk thistle group but not in the placebo group. CONCLUSIONS: This trial failed to show that milk thistle was more effective than placebo on the main outcome measure, but milk thistle did demonstrate significant improvements on select secondary outcome measures. These findings may shed light on important neurochemical targets worthy of future investigation.",

Gaertn.) compound silibinin may be an inhibitor of the angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) receptor which is expressed in differentiating embryonic stem (ES) cells and is involved in the regulation of cardiomyogenesis. In the present study, it was demonstrated that silibinin treatment decreased the number of spontaneously contracting cardiac foci and cardiac cell areas differentiated from ES cells as well as contraction frequency and frequency of calcium (Ca2+) spiking. In contrast, angiotensin II (Ang II) treatment stimulated cardiomyogenesis as well as contraction and Ca2+ spiking frequency, which were abolished in the presence of silibinin. Intracellular Ca2+ transients elicited by Ang II in rat smooth muscle cells were not impaired upon silibinin treatment, excluding the possibility that the compound acted on the AT1 receptor. Ang II treatment activated extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2), c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK), and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways in embryoid bodies which were abolished upon silibinin pretreatment. In summary, our data suggest that silibinin inhibits cardiomyogenesis of ES cells by interfering with Ang II signaling downstream of the AT1 receptor."

      "abstract": "The milk thistle compound Silibinin (i.e., a 1:1 mixture of Silybin A and Silybin B) stimulates vasculogenesis of mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells. Because vasculogenesis and leukopoiesis are interrelated, the effect of Silibinin on leukopoiesis of ES cells was investigated. Treatment of differentiating ES cells with hydrosoluble Silibinin-C-2',3-dihydrogen succinate dose-dependent increased the number of CD18+ , CD45+ , and CD68+ cells, indicating leukocyte/macrophage differentiation. Silibinin treatment activated phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), AKT (protein kinase B), signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), stimulated hypoxia-induced factor-1α (HIF-1α), and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2) expression and raised intracellular nitric oxide (NO). Western blot experiments showed that upon coincubation with either the PI3K inhibitor LY294002, the STAT3 inhibitor Stattic, the AKT antagonist AKT inhibitor VIII, or the NO inhibitor L-NAME, the Silibinin-induced expression of CD18, CD45, and CD68 was abolished. Moreover, the stimulation of HIF-1α and VEGFR2 expression was blunted upon STAT3 and PI3K/AKT inhibition. Treatment of differentiating ES cells with L-NAME abolished the stimulation of VEGFR2 and VE-cadherin expression achieved with Silibinin, indicating that NO is involved in vasculogenesis and leukocyte differentiation pathways. In summary, the data of the present study demonstrate that Silibinin stimulates leukocyte differentiation of ES cells, which is associated to vasculogenesis and regulated by PI3K/AKT-, STAT3-, and NO-mediated signaling.",

      "abstract": "Many natural compounds having antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity are a potential target for new therapies against chronic inflammatory syndromes. The oral administration of functional herbal supplements may become a prevention strategy or therapy adjuvant for susceptible patients. A case study is our milk thistle (Silybum marianum) extract rich in silymarin complex. A water-soluble microencapsulated powder system was developed by a spray drying technique to improve the poor silymarin bioactivity after oral administration. Sodium carboxymethylcellulose (NaCMC) was employed as coating/swelling polymer matrix and sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS) as the surfactant (1:1:0.05 w/w/w). A H₂O/EtOH/acetone (50/15/35 v/v/v) solvent system was used as liquid feed. The microsystems were capable of improving the in vitro dissolution and permeation rates, suggesting an enhancement of bioactivity after oral administration. The microsystems protect the antioxidant activity of silymarin after harsh storage conditions period and do not affect the anti-inflammatory properties of the raw extract (efficient already at lower concentrations of 0.312 mg/mL) to reduce dendritic cells (DCs) inflammatory cytokine secretion after lipopolysaccharide administration. This approach allows managing particle size, surface properties and release of bioactive agents improving the bioactivity of a herbal supplement and is also possibly applicable to many other similar natural products.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Several anti-arthritic drugs and synthetic antioxidants have wide pharmaceutical uses and are often associated with various side effects on the human health. Dietary seed oils and their minor components like policosanol may offer an effective alternative treatment for arthritic and oxidative-stress related diseases. The biological effects of seed oils were affected by different parameters such as the stage of seed maturity. Hence, this study seeks to determine the policosanol content, antioxidant and anti-arthritic activities of milk thistle (Silybium marianum L.) oil extracted at various stages of seed maturation. METHODS: Milk thistle oil samples were extracted from seeds collected at three maturation stages (immature, intermediate, and mature). The 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and 2,2'-azino-bis (3-ethyl-benzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS) radical scavenging assays were used to determine the antioxidant activity of the extracted oils. The anti-arthritic activity of oil samples was evaluated with bovine serum protein denaturation and egg albumin denaturation methods. Gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC-MS) was employed to determine the policosanol profile. RESULTS: Policosanol profile, antioxidant and anti-arthritic activities of milk thistle oil were influenced by the seed maturity stages. The oil extracted from the immature seeds had the highest total policosanol content (987.68 mg/kg of oil) and displayed the maximum antiradical activity (96.42% and 90.35% for DPPH test and ABTS assay, respectively). Nine aliphatic alcohols were identified in the milk thistle oil. The dominant poliosanol in the mature seed oil was octacosanol (75.44%), while triacontanol was the major compound (40.25%) in the immature seed oil. Additionally, the maximum inhibition of bovine serum protein denaturation (92.53%) and egg albumin denaturation (86.36%) were observed in immature seed oil as compared to mature seed oil. A high correlation was found between the total policosanol content, anti-arthritic activity and antioxidant capacity of oil. CONCLUSIONS: The milk thistle oil exhibited a potential anti-arthritic and antioxidant activities and that it might contribute to the protection of humans from a variety of diseases like rheumatoid arthritis. Also, it could serve as natural antioxidant and anti-arthritic agents for application in the food industries and pharmaceutic. Policosanol level in the seed oils might contribute to their anti-arthritic and antioxidant activities.",

Today, it is used for the same purpose in evidence-based medicine (EBM). Its main active ingredient is a complex of flavonolignans, known as silymarin. Silymarin is used as a hepatoprotective agent, but its potential therapeutic use in oncology patients has drawn attention only recently. PURPOSE: The aim of this review is to provide comprehensive information on the potential therapeutic effects of milk thistle in oncology patients and potential indications for its use as a supportive therapy either as an anticarcinogenic agent or as an agent that attenuates the side effects of oncological treatments. Evidence of its effects and its safety, and possible interactions with other cancer treatments are emphasized. Available findings are supported mainly by in vitro studies and the results of animal research, but the number of clinical trials in oncology patients is increasing. Based on the results of these studies, milk thistle or silymarin could be beneficial in oncology patients, especially for the treatment of the side effects of anticancer chemotherapeutics. Evidence from clinical studies shows that it has mainly beneficial effects in hepatotoxicity and radiotherapy-induced skin and mucosa damage at dosages of 160-600 mg daily.Key words: phytotherapy - drug-herb interactions - cancer - adverse effects - milk thistle - Silybum marianum This publication was written at Masaryk University as part of the project \"Experimental and translational pharmacological research and development\", number MUNI/A/1063/2016 with the support of the Specific University Research Grant, as provided by the Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of the Czech Republic in the year 2017.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of milk thistle (MT, Silybum marianum) and ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) or their combination on the activation of hepatic stem cells and on the severity of cholestasis liver injury in rats. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Under anesthesia, bile ducts of female Sprague Dawley rats were ligated (BDL) or had sham operation. BDL rats were administered saline, UDCA (15 mg/kg/d), MT (600 mg/kg/d), or UDCA+MT by gavage for 10 days. On the 11th day, rats were sacrificed and blood and liver samples were obtained. Serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), hepatic malondialdehyde (MDA) levels, and myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity were measured. Hepatic injury, a-smooth muscle actin expression, and stem cell markers c-kit, c-Myc, Oct3/4, and SSEA-1 were histologically determined. RESULTS: Histological scores, serum ALT, and hepatic MDA levels were higher in BDL group than in the sham rats, while all treatments significantly reduced these levels. The reduction in ALT was significantly greater in UCDA+MT-treated group than in other treatment groups. c-Kit, c-Myc, Oct3/4, and SSEA-1 were increased in saline-treated BDL group with respect to sham-operated control group, and these markers were significantly reduced in all treatment groups. CONCLUSION: In addition to a modulatory effect on the stem cell-induced regenerative response of the liver, UDCA, MT, and their combination demonstrated similar anti-inflammatory and antiproliferative effects on cholestasis-induced hepatic injury.",

Korean milk thistle, Cirsium japonicum var. maackii (Maxim.) Matsum has been employed in traditional folk medicine as diuretic, antiphlogistic, hemostatic, and detoxifying agents. AIM OF THE STUDY: The aim of current investigation was to evaluate hepatoprotective properties of the MeOH extract of the roots, stems, leaves and flowers of Korean milk thistle as well as four isolated flavonoids, luteolin, luteolin 5-O-glucoside, apigenin and apigenin 7-O-glucuronide during t-BHP-induced oxidative stress in HepG2 cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Hepatoprotective potential of the MeOH extracts and flavonoids derived from Korean milk thistle against t-BHP-induced oxidative stress in HepG2 cells were evaluated following MTT method. Incubating HepG2 cells with t-BHP markedly decreased the cell viability and increased the intracellular ROS generation accompanied by depleted GSH levels. Protein expression of heme oxygenase (HO-1) and nuclear factor-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf-2) was determined by Western blot. RESULTS: Our findings revealed that pretreating HepG2 cells with MeOH extracts and bioactive flavonoids significantly attenuated the t-BHP-induced oxidative damage, followed by increased cell viability in a dose-dependent manner. The results illustrate that excess ROS generation was reduced and GSH levels increased dose-dependently when HepG2 cells were pretreated with four flavonoids. Moreover, Western blotting analysis demonstrated that protein expressions of Nrf-2 and HO-1 were also up-regulated by flavonoids treatment. CONCLUSIONS: These results clearly demonstrate that the MeOH extracts and flavonoids from Korean milk thistle protected HepG2 cells against oxidative damage triggered by t-BHP principally by modulating ROS generation and restoring depleted GSH levels in addition to the increased Nrf-2/HO-1 signaling cascade. These flavonoids are potential natural antioxidative biomarkers against oxidative stress-induced hepatotoxicity.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Silybum marianum L. (Milk thistle) is native to the Mediterranean basin and is now widespread throughout the world. It's sprout is used as a herbal medicine for the treatment of liver disease for centuries. The seeds of milk thistle contain silymarin, an isomeric mixture of flavonolignans [silybin, silychristin, and silydianin]. Silymarin acts as a strong anti-hepatotoxic. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to evaluate the influences of potassium sulfate [K2SO4] fertilizer doses on polyphenol content, some nutrient elements, antioxidant and antimicrobial activities of milk thistle at experimental fields of Ordu University in Turkey. METHODS: The antimicrobial activities of seed ethanol extracts and seed oil were tested in vitro against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa), Escherichia coli, (E. coli) Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), Aspergillus niger (A. niger) and Candida albicans (C. albicans) using the disc diffusion method. Free radical scavenging activity of the ethanolic extracts of milk thistle was determined spectrophotometrically by monitoring the disappearance of 2, 2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazil (DPPH•) at 517 nm according to the method described by Brand-Williams et al.[17] The phenolic contents in the ethanolic extracts of milk thistle were determined according to the procedure described by Slinkard and Singleton[19] with a slight modification of using a Folin-Ciocalteu phenolic reagent. The amount of total flavonoid in the ethanolic extracts was measured by aluminum chloride [AlCl3] colorimetric assay. The ions in aerosol samples were determined by using Dionex ICS 1100 Series ion chromatography. RESULTS: Seed and seed oils obtained from obvious doses of potassium sulfate [0, 30, 60, 90 and 120 kg ha -1 fertilizer applications showed antimicrobial activities against E. coli, A. niger and P. aeruginosa. The application of 90 kg ha -1 of K2SO4 on seed oil resulted in the highest antimicrobial activities. At 100 µg mL-1 and 200 µg mL-1, except the highest potassium application [120 kg ha -1 extract, all extracts showed high and similar DPPH scavenging activity. The highest phenolic compounds were obtained with 30 kg ha -1 of K2SO4, whereas the use of 60 kg ha -1 caused the highest total flavonoid content. This plant is a good source of K+, Ca+2, PO4-3, and Cl-1. CONCLUSION: In this study, increasing doses of potassium sulfate had significant effect on element, polyphenol content, antioxidant and antimicrobial activities of the milk thistle. SUMMARY: All tested extracts were active against all tested microbial species.All extracts have shown high and similar DPPH scavenging activity.There was a gradual increase in the biological properties of the milk thistle seeds with rising levels of potassium sulfate.The milk thistle seeds are rather rich sources of K+, Ca+2, PO4-3 and Cl-1 potentially bioavailable for human consumption.

      "abstract": "Seeds of milk thistle, Silybum marianum (L.) Gaertn., are used for treatment and prevention of liver disorders and were identified as a high priority ingredient requiring a validated analytical method. An AOAC International expert panel reviewed existing methods and made recommendations concerning method optimization prior to validation. A series of extraction and separation studies were undertaken on the selected method for determining flavonolignans from milk thistle seeds and finished products to address the review panel recommendations. Once optimized, a single-laboratory validation study was conducted. The method was assessed for repeatability, accuracy, selectivity, LOD, LOQ, analyte stability, and linearity. Flavonolignan content ranged from 1.40 to 52.86% in raw materials and dry finished products and ranged from 36.16 to 1570.7 μg/mL in liquid tinctures. Repeatability for the individual flavonolignans in raw materials and finished products ranged from 1.03 to 9.88% RSDr, with HorRat values between 0.21 and 1.55. Calibration curves for all flavonolignan concentrations had correlation coefficients of >99.8%. The LODs for the flavonolignans ranged from 0.20 to 0.48 μg/mL at 288 nm. Based on the results of this single-laboratory validation, this method is suitable for the quantitation of the six major flavonolignans in milk thistle raw materials and finished products, as well as multicomponent products containing dandelion, schizandra berry, and artichoke extracts. It is recommended that this method be adopted as First Action Official Method status by AOAC International.",

Moreover, the antioxidant and cytotoxic activities of the SC-CO2 oil seeds extracts were evaluated in Caco-2 carcinoma cells. Pressure and temperature had a significant effect on oil and flavonolignans recovery, although there was not observed a clear trend. SC-CO2 with co-solvent extraction at 220 bars, 40 °C was the optimum treatment to recover oil (30.8%) and flavonolignans from milk thistle seeds. Moreover, linoleic (47.64-66.70%), and oleic (19.68-24.83%) acids were the predominant fatty acids in the oil extracts recovered from milk thistle under SC-CO2. In addition, SC-CO2 extract showed a high antioxidant activity determined by DPPH and ABTS tests. Cytotoxic activities of silychristin, silydianin and silybinin and the obtained SC-CO2 extract (220 bars, 40 °C) were evaluated against Caco-2 cells. The SC-CO2 extract inhibited the proliferation of Caco-2 cells in a dose-responsive manner and induced the highest percentage of mortality of Caco-2 cells (from 43 to 71% for concentrations from 10 up to 100 μg/ml of SC-CO2 oil seeds).",

      "abstract": "Women at high risk of developing breast cancer are prescribed selective estrogen response modulators, including raloxifene, as chemoprevention. Patients often seek complementary and alternative treatment modalities, including herbal products, to supplement prescribed medications. Milk thistle preparations, including silibinin and silymarin, are top-selling herbal products that may be consumed by women taking raloxifene, which undergoes extensive first-pass glucuronidation in the intestine. Key constituents in milk thistle, flavonolignans, were previously shown to be potent inhibitors of intestinal UDP-glucuronosyl transferases (UGTs), with IC50s ≤ 10 μM. Taken together, milk thistle preparations may perpetrate unwanted interactions with raloxifene. The objective of this work was to evaluate the inhibitory effects of individual milk thistle constituents on the intestinal glucuronidation of raloxifene using human intestinal microsomes and human embryonic kidney cell lysates overexpressing UGT1A1, UGT1A8, and UGT1A10, isoforms highly expressed in the intestine that are critical to raloxifene clearance. The flavonolignans silybin A and silybin B were potent inhibitors of both raloxifene 4'- and 6-glucuronidation in all enzyme systems. The Kis (human intestinal microsomes, 27-66 µM; UGT1A1, 3.2-8.3 µM; UGT1A8, 19-73 µM; and UGT1A10, 65-120 µM) encompassed reported intestinal tissue concentrations (20-310 µM), prompting prediction of clinical interaction risk using a mechanistic static model. Silibinin and silymarin were predicted to increase raloxifene systemic exposure by 4- to 5-fold, indicating high interaction risk that merits further evaluation. This systematic investigation of the potential interaction between a widely used herbal product and chemopreventive agent underscores the importance of understanding natural product-drug interactions in the context of cancer prevention.",

      "abstract": "Glycation is an ageing reaction of naturally occurring sugars with dermal proteins, with clinical signs appearing in vivo around age 30, and increasing steadily/regularly with age. The suppleness of the dermis is affected by the formation of bridges between proteins and sugars (Maillard's reaction). The accumulation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) in skin plays a very important role in skin ageing. Therefore, natural compounds or extracts that possess antiglycation activities may have great anti-ageing potential. In the present study, Silybum marianum flower extract (SMFE) was demonstrated to possess antiglycation activity. We found that SMFE inhibits glycation reaction between BSA and glucose. In addition, antiglycation activity of SMFE was confirmed in a human skin explants model. SMFE reduced Nε-(carboxymethyl) lysine (CML) expression, whereas SMFE stimulated fibrillin-1 expression compared to treatment with methyglyoxal. An active ingredient contributing to the observed activities was identified as silibinin. The antiglycation activity of silibinin was dose-dependent. The beneficial effects of silibinin may be applied to prevention or management of AGE-mediated pathologies, targeting in a pleiotropic and complementary way the biochemical and cellular bases of skin aging.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: A subcategory of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is characterized by accumulation of fat accompanied by inflammatory infiltration and hepatocellular damage. The active complex of milk thistle is a lipophilic extract from its seeds, comprising three isomers, collectively known as silymarin. Silymarin has demonstrated antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antifibrotic properties, and has been extensively studied in the treatment of liver diseases. The majority of published clinical research on silymarin has used Legalon(®) (Rottapharm/Madaus), containing the patented extract of milk thistle ETHIS-094™ (Euromed). The current study was undertaken to examine the effects of ETHIS-094™ in the Stelic Animal Model (STAM™), a validated and widely used animal model for NASH. METHODS: After 4 h fasting from 4 to 8 weeks of age, 15 male mice in whom NASH had been induced were orally administered, once daily, either (1) vehicle (saline) at a volume of 10 mL/kg, (2) vehicle supplemented with milk thistle at a dose of 500 mg/kg, or (3) vehicle supplemented with milk thistle at a dose of 1,000 mg/kg. RESULTS: Mean liver weight and the liver-to-body weight ratio were significantly (P < 0.01) decreased in the milk thistle high-dose group compared with the vehicle group. NAFLD activity score (NAS) tended to decrease in the milk thistle treatment groups compared with vehicle group, as did steatosis scores. CONCLUSION: Milk thistle extract administration induced a decreasing trend in NAS compared with the vehicle group. Milk thistle induced a numerical decrease of the steatosis score compared with vehicle, and this was accompanied by a statistically significant decrease in liver weight and the liver-to-body weight ratio, implying a potential anti-steatosis effect of milk thistle.",

Therefore, the aim of this work was to characterize specific bioactive components, phenolic compounds, in hydromethanolic extracts but also in infusions (the most commonly used preparations) obtained from the whole plant of milk thistle and artichoke. The phenolic profiles were accessed using HPLC-DAD-MS/ESI. Infusions of both species presented higher phenolic contents than the hydromethanolic extracts. Milk thistle presented a similar phenolic composition between the two preparations, revealing only differences in the quantities obtained. Nevertheless, artichoke revealed a slightly different profile considering infusion and hydromethanolic extracts. Apigenin-7-O-glucuronide was the major flavonoid found in milk thistle, while luteolin-7-O-glucuronide was the most abundant in artichoke. Therefore, infusions of both artichoke and milk thistle represent a good source of bioactive compounds, especially phenolic acids and flavonoids.",

      "abstract": "Cocaine is a powerful addictive drug, widely abused in most Western countries. It easily reaches various domains within and outside of the central nervous system (CNS), and triggers varying levels of cellular toxicity. No pharmacological treatment is available to alleviate cocaine-induced toxicity in the cells without side-effects. Here, we discerned the role of milk thistle (MT) seed extract against cocaine toxicity. First, we investigated acute cytotoxicity induced by treatment with 2, 3 and 4 mM cocaine for 1 h in astroglial, liver and kidney cells in vitro, and then in living shrimp larvae in vivo. We showed that astroglial cells are more sensitive to cocaine than liver, kidney cells or larvae. Cocaine exposure disrupted the general architecture of astroglial cells, induced vacuolation, decreased cell viability, and depleted the glutathione (GSH) level. These changes may represent the underlying pathology of cocaine in the astrocytes. By contrast, MT pretreatment (200 µg/ml) for 30 min sustained the cell morphological features and increased both cell viability and the GSH level. Besides its protective effects, the MT extract was revealed to be non-toxic to astroglial cells, and displayed high free-radical scavenging activity. The results from this study suggest that enhanced GSH level underlies cell protection, and indicate that compounds that promote GSH synthesis in the cells may be beneficial against cocaine toxicity.",

The active constituents of milk thistle supplements are believed to be the flavonolignans contained within the extracts. In vitro studies have suggested that some milk thistle components may significantly inhibit specific cytochrome P450 (P450) enzymes. However, determining the potential for clinically significant drug interactions with milk thistle products has been complicated by inconsistencies between in vitro and in vivo study results. The aim of the present study was to determine the effect of a standardized milk thistle supplement on major P450 drug-metabolizing enzymes after a 14-day exposure period. CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4/5 activities were measured by simultaneously administering the four probe drugs, caffeine, tolbutamide, dextromethorphan, and midazolam, to nine healthy volunteers before and after exposure to a standardized milk thistle extract given thrice daily for 14 days. The three most abundant falvonolignans found in plasma, following exposure to milk thistle extracts, were silybin A, silybin B, and isosilybin B. The concentrations of these three major constituents were individually measured in study subjects as potential perpetrators. The peak concentrations and areas under the time-concentration curves of the four probe drugs were determined with the milk thistle administration. Exposure to milk thistle extract produced no significant influence on CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, or CYP3A4/5 activities.",

Silymarin, a concentrated phenolic mixture from milk thistle (Silybum marianum) seeds, is used widely as a supportive agent in the treatment of a variety of liver diseases. In this study, the PPARγ activation potential of silymarin and its main constituents was investigated. Isosilybin A (3) caused transactivation of a PPARγ-dependent luciferase reporter in a concentration-dependent manner. This effect could be reversed upon co-treatment with the PPARγ antagonist T0070907. In silico docking studies suggested a binding mode for 3 distinct from that of the inactive silymarin constituents, with one additional hydrogen bond to Ser342 in the entrance region of the ligand-binding domain of the receptor. Hence, isosilybin A (3) has been identified as the first flavonolignan PPARγ agonist, suggesting its further investigation as a modulator of this nuclear receptor.",

      "abstract": "Silymarin is a bioflavonoid complex extract derived from dry seeds of Milk thistle [(Silybum marianum(L.) Gaemrnt. (Fam. Asteraceae/Compositaceae)] whose hepatoprotective effect has clinically been proved. Low toxicity, favorable pharmacokinetics, powerful antioxidant, detoxifying, preventive, protective and regenerative effects and side effects similar to placebo make silymarin extremely attractive and safe for therapeutic use. The medicinal properties of silymarin and its main component silibinin have been studied in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, sepsis, burns, osteoporosis, diabetes, cholestasis and hypercholesterolemia. Owing to its apoptotic effect, without cytotoxic effects, silymarin possesses potential applications in the treatment of various cancers. Silymarin is being examined as a neuro-, nephro- and cardio-protective in the damage of different etiologies due to its strong antioxidant potentials. Furthermore, it has fetoprotective (against the influence of alcohol) and prolactin effects and is safe to be used during pregnancy and lactation. Finally, the cosmetics industry is examining the antioxidant and UV-protective effects of silymarin. Further clinical studies and scientific evidence that silymarin and silibinin are effective in the therapy of various pathologies are indispensable in order to confirm their different flavonolignan pharmacological effects.",

      "abstract": "Osteoporosis is a progressive disease of the skeleton characterised by bone fragility due to a reduction in bone mass and possibly to alteration in bone architecture that lead to a propensity to fracture with minimum trauma. Most osteoporotic fractures occur at locations rich in trabecular or cancellous bone and usually related to post menopausal women. Recently, silymarin received attention due to its alternative beneficial effect on bone formation. It is a mixture of flavonoids with powerful antioxidant properties. This review focuses on the use of milk thistle or silymarin for the treatment of osteoporosis that may be related to fracture bone. Silymarin shows potent antioxidant herb that may modulate multiple genes in favour of helping to build bone and prevent bone loss. In the mouse fracture healing model, silymarin supplementation improved tibial healing with elevated BMD and serum levels of ALP and osteocalcin. Silymarin also demonstrated clear estrogenic antiosteoporotic effects in bone structure. Silymarin appears to play a crucial role to prevent bone loss and might regulate osteogenesis and may be beneficial for fracture healing. If silymarin is considered for the use of post menopausal women, it may be used for the treatment of osteoporosis. It would be of great benefit to postmenopausal women to develop an oestrogen antagonist that is as potent and efficacious as oestrogen in preventing bone loss without the major side effect associated with HRT.",

      "abstract": "Silibinin is the primary active constituent of a crude extract (silymarin) from milk thistle plant (Silybum marianum) seeds. We explored the ability of an oral milk thistle extract formulation that was enriched with a water-soluble form of silibinin complexed with the amino-sugar meglumine to inhibit the growth of non-small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) mouse xenografts. As a single agent, oral silibinin meglumine notably decreased the overall volumes of NSCLC tumors as efficiently as did the EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) gefitinib. Concurrent treatment with silibinin meglumine impeded the regrowth of gefitinib-unresponsive tumors, resulting in drastic tumor growth prevention. Because the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is required by a multiplicity of mechanisms of resistance to EGFR TKIs, we evaluated the ability of silibinin meglumine to impede the EMT in vitro and in vivo. Silibinin-meglumine efficiently prevented the loss of markers associated with a polarized epithelial phenotype as well as the de novo synthesis of proteins associated with the mesenchymal morphology of transitioning cells. Our current findings with this non-toxic, orally active, and water-soluble silibinin formulation might facilitate the design of clinical trials to test the administration of silibinin meglumine-containing injections, granules, or beverages in combination with EGFR TKIs in patients with EGFR-mutated NSCLC.",

Silymarin-rich milk thistle extract (MTE) and its component silibinin enhanced alkaline phosphatase activity of osteoblasts but reduced tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) activity of osteoclasts. The osteoprotective effects of MTE were comparable to those of estrogenic isoflavone. Low-dose combination of MTE and isoflavone had a pharmacological synergy that may be useful for osteogenic activity. This study attempted to reveal the suppressive effects of MTE on bone loss. C57BL/6 female mice were ovariectomized (OVX) as a model for postmenopausal osteopenia and orally administered 10 mg/kg MTE or silibinin for 8 weeks. The sham-operated mice served as estrogen controls. The treatment of ovariectomized mice with nontoxic MTE and silibinin improved femoral bone mineral density and serum receptor activator of nuclear factor- κB ligand/osteoprotegerin ratio, an index of osteoclastogenic stimulus. In addition, the administration of MTE or silibinin inhibited femoral bone loss induced by ovariectomy and suppressed femoral TRAP activity and cathepsin K induction responsible for osteoclastogenesis and bone resorption. Collectively, oral dosage of MTE containing silibinin in the preclinical setting is effective in preventing estrogen deficiency-induced bone loss.",

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Patients with advanced HCC not eligible for other therapies based on poor hepatic function were enrolled in a phase I study of silybin phosphatidylcholine. A standard phase I design was used with 4 planned cohorts, dose escalating from 2, 4, 8, to 12 g per day in divided doses for 12 weeks. RESULTS: Three participants enrolled in this single institution trial. All enrolled subjects consumed 2 g per day of study agent in divided doses. Serum concentrations of silibinin and silibinin glucuronide increased within 1 to 3 weeks. In all 3 patients, liver function abnormalities and tumor marker α-fetoprotein progressed, but after day 56 the third patient showed some improvement in liver function abnormalities and inflammatory biomarkers. All 3 participants died within 23 to 69 days of enrolling into the trial, likely from hepatic failure, but it could not be ruled out that deaths were possibly due to the study drug. CONCLUSION: Short-term administration of silybin phosphatidylcholine in patients with advanced HCC resulted in detectable increases in silibinin and its metabolite, silibinin glucuronide. The maximum tolerated dose could not be established. Since patients died soon after enrollment, this patient population may have been too ill to benefit from an intervention designed to improve liver function tests.",

      "abstract": "Because cancer is often treated with combination therapy, unexpected pharmacological effects can occur because of drug-drug interactions. Several drugs are able to cause upregulation or downregulation of drug transporters or cytochrome P450 enzymes, particularly CYP3A4. Induction of CYP3A4 may result in decreased plasma levels and therapeutic efficacy of anticancer drugs. Since the pregnane X receptor (PXR) is one of the major transcriptional regulators of CYP3A4, PXR antagonists can possibly prevent CYP3A4 induction. Currently, a limited number of PXR antagonists are available. Some of these antagonists, such as sulphoraphane and coumestrol, belong to the so-called complementary and alternative medicines (CAM). Therefore, the aim was to determine the potential of selected CAM (β-carotene, Echinacea purpurea, garlic, Ginkgo biloba, ginseng, grape seed, green tea, milk thistle, saw palmetto, valerian, St. John's Wort, and vitamins B6, B12, and C) to inhibit PXR-mediated CYP3A4 induction at the transcriptional level, using a reporter gene assay and a real-time polymerase chain reaction assay in LS180 colon adenocarcinoma cells. Furthermore, computational molecular docking and a LanthaScreen time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer (TR-FRET) PXR competitive binding assay were performed to explore whether the inhibiting CAM components interact with PXR. The results demonstrated that milk thistle is a strong inhibitor of PXR-mediated CYP3A4 induction. The components of milk thistle responsible for this effect were identified as silybin and isosilybin. Furthermore, computational molecular docking revealed a strong interaction between both silybin and isosilybin and PXR, which was confirmed in the TR-FRET PXR assay. In conclusion, silybin and isosilybin might be suitable candidates to design potent PXR antagonists to prevent drug-drug interactions via CYP3A4 in cancer patients.",

To assess different brands of commercially sold silymarin, 45 products were collected from local stores and analyzed for their silymarin content, antioxidant activities, and antiviral activity against HCV. Antioxidant activity was measured as radical scavenging activity using DPPH and by estimating their antioxidant capacity as trolox equivalent. Anti-HCV activity was measured in an HCV genotype 1b replication inhibition assay. Samples were found to vary widely in their silymarin content, with some samples having none or very low concentrations while silymarin represented higher than 80% of other samples. Both antioxidant and anti-HCV activity correlated with the overall level of silymarin."

OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of silymarin on liver disease activity in patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection unsuccessfully treated with interferon-based therapy. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted at 4 medical centers in the United States. Participants included 154 persons with chronic HCV infection and serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels of 65 U/L or greater who were previously unsuccessfully treated with interferon-based therapy. Enrollment began in May 2008 and was completed in May 2010, with the last follow-up visit completed in March 2011. INTERVENTION: Participants were randomly assigned to receive 420-mg silymarin, 700-mg silymarin, or matching placebo administered 3 times per day for 24 weeks. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome measure was serum ALT level of 45 U/L or less (considered within the normal range) or less than 65 U/L, provided this was at least a 50% decline from baseline values. Secondary outcomes included changes in ALT levels, HCV RNA levels, and quality-of-life measures. RESULTS: After 24 weeks of treatment, only 2 participants in each treatment group (P ≥ .99) met the primary outcome measure (3.8% [95% CI, 0.5% to 13.2%] for placebo, 4.0% [95% CI, 0.5% to 13.7%] for 420-mg silymarin, and 3.8% [95% CI, 0.5% to 13.2%] for 700-mg silymarin). The mean decline in serum ALT activity at the end of treatment did not differ significantly (P = .75) across the 3 treatment groups (mean decline, -4.3 [95% CI, -17.3 to 8.7] U/L for placebo, -14.4 [95% CI, -41.6 to 12.7] U/L for 420-mg silymarin, -11.3 [95% CI, -27.9 to 5.4] U/L for 700-mg silymarin); there likewise were no significant differences in HCV RNA levels (mean change, 0.07 [95% CI, -0.05 to 0.18] log10 IU/mL for placebo, -0.03 [95% CI, -0.18 to 0.12] log10 IU/mL for 420-mg silymarin, 0.04 [95% CI, -0.08 to 0.16] log10 IU/mL for 700-mg silymarin; P = .54) or quality-of-life measures. The adverse event profile of silymarin was comparable with that of placebo. CONCLUSION: Higher than customary doses of silymarin did not significantly reduce serum ALT levels more than placebo in participants with chronic HCV infection unsuccessfully treated with interferon-based therapy.

      "abstract": "The aim of this open-label, fixed-sequence study was to investigate the potential of the botanical supplement milk thistle (silymarin) to interact with the boosted protease inhibitor combination darunavir-ritonavir. Fifteen HIV-infected patients receiving antiretroviral therapy with darunavir-ritonavir (600/100 mg twice daily) for at least 4 weeks were included. Silymarin (150 mg every 8 h) was added to the antiretroviral treatment from days 1 to 14. Darunavir concentrations in plasma were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography immediately before and 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 h after a morning dose of darunavir-ritonavir on day 0 and darunavir-ritonavir plus silymarin on day 14. Individual darunavir pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated by noncompartmental analysis and compared between days 0 and 14 by means of the geometric mean ratio (GMR) and its 90% confidence interval (CI). The median age was 48 years (interquartile range, 44 to 50 years), and the median body weight was 70 kg (interquartile range, 65 to 84 kg). Silymarin was well tolerated, and all participants completed the study. The GMRs for darunavir coadministered with silymarin relative to darunavir alone were 0.86 (90% CI, 0.70 to 1.05) for the area under the concentration-time curve from 0 to 12 h, 0.83 (90% CI, 0.80 to 0.98) for the maximum concentration, and 0.94 (90% CI, 0.73 to 1.19) for the concentration at the end of the dosing interval. In summary, coadministration of silymarin with darunavir-ritonavir seems to be safe in HIV-infected patients; no dose adjustment for darunavir-ritonavir seems to be necessary.",

We examined the efficacy of silymarin on ethanol-induced oxidative stress, immunomodulatory activity, and vascular function in mice blood. Effectiveness of silymarin was compared with potent antioxidant ascorbic acid. In the present study, 8- to 10-week-old male BALB/c mice (20-30 g) were divided into the four groups of six each. One group were fed with ethanol (1.6 g/kg body weight), while second group were fed with ethanol (1.6 g/kg body weight) and silybin (250 mg/kg body weight), and the third group were exposed to ethanol (250 mg/kg body weight) and ascorbic acid (250 mg/kg body weight) per day for 12 weeks. The control group was fed with isocaloric glucose solution instead of ethanol. Ethanol exposure significantly increased thiobarbituric acid reactive substance (TBARS) and nitrite levels besides glutathione-S-transferase (GST) activity, and significantly decreased reduced glutathione (GSH) content and the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione reductase (GR), and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) in whole blood hemolyzate, while silymarin treatment significantly normalized these altered parameters. Silymarin significantly prevented ethanol-induced, elevated activities of interleukin (IL)-10, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, γ interferon (IFN-γ), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A, and transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1, as well as decreased IL-4 activity in mice blood.

      "abstract": "UNLABELLED: Milk thistle extracts have been used as medicinal herbs in the treatment of liver cirrhosis, chronic hepatitis (liver inflammation), and gallbladder disorders. Treatment claims also include lowering cholesterol levels; reducing insulin resistance; reducing the growth of cancer cells in breast, cervical, and prostate gland cancers; and antiviral activity. Other reported uses of milk thistle in folk medicine include as a treatment for malarial fever, bronchitis, gallstones, jaundice, peritonitis, uterine congestion, varicose veins, and as a milk production stimulant for nursing mothers. The roots soaked in water overnight are used in food, and the despined leaves are added to salads. Roasted milk thistle fruit has been used as a coffee substitute. Milk thistle extract was nominated for study by the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences because it is one of the most widely used herbs in the United States. Male and female F344/N rats and B6C3F1 mice were exposed to an ethanol/water extract of milk thistle fruit (milk thistle extract) containing approximately 65% silymarin in feed for 3 months or 2 years. Genetic toxicology studies were conducted in Salmonella typhimurium and Escherichia coli and mouse peripheral blood erythrocytes. 3-MONTH STUDY IN RATS: Groups of 10 male and 10 female rats were fed diets containing 0, 3,125, 6,250, 12,500, 25,000, or 50,000 ppm milk thistle extract (equivalent to average daily doses of approximately 260, 525, 1,050, 2,180, or 4,500 mg milk thistle extract/kilogram body weight to males and 260, 510, 1,050, 2,150, or 4,550 mg/kg to females) for 14 weeks. All rats survived to the end of the study. Mean body weights of exposed groups were within 10% of those of the controls. Feed consumption by exposed and control groups was similar. The sperm motility in 12,500, 25,000, and 50,000 ppm males was decreased by 5%, 11%, and 9%, respectively, relative to that of the controls; the total number of spermatid heads per testis decreased by 11%, 21%, and 9% in 12,500, 25,000, and 50,000 ppm males. No significant differences in estrous cyclicity were observed between exposed and control groups of female rats. No exposure-related histopathologic lesions were observed. 3-MONTH STUDY IN MICE: Groups of 10 male and 10 female mice were fed diets containing 0, 3,125, 6,250, 12,500, 25,000, or 50,000 ppm milk thistle extract (equivalent to average daily doses of approximately 640, 1,340, 2,500, 5,280, or 11,620 mg/kg to males and 580, 1,180, 2,335, 4,800, or 9,680 mg/kg to females) for 14 weeks. All mice survived to the end of the study. Mean body weights and feed consumption of all exposed groups were similar to those of the controls. Absolute and relative thymus weights were significantly decreased in 25,000 and 50,000 ppm males. No significant differences were observed between exposed and control groups, for sperm parameters of male mice, for estrous cyclicity of female mice, or for reproductive organ weights of male or female mice, when mice were administered milk thistle extract in feed at 12,500, 25,000, or 50,000 ppm. No exposure-related histopathologic lesions were observed. 2-YEAR STUDY IN RATS: Groups of 50 male and 50 female rats were fed diets containing 0, 12,500, 25,000, or 50,000 ppm milk thistle extract (equivalent to average daily doses of approximately 570, 1,180, or 2,520 mg/kg to males and 630, 1,300, or 2,750 mg/kg to females) for 105 to 106 weeks. Exposure to milk thistle extract had no effect on survival of male or female rats. Mean body weights of all exposed groups were similar to those of the controls throughout the study. Feed consumption by exposed groups of males and females was generally similar to that by the controls throughout the study. Significantly decreased incidences of mammary gland fibroadenoma, adenoma, or carcinoma (combined) occurred in females exposed to 25,000 or 50,000 ppm. Significantly increased incidences of clear cell and mixed cell focus of the liver occurred in 25,000 and 50,000 ppm females. The incidences of bile duct hyperplasia were significantly decreased in 50,000 ppm males and in all exposed groups of females, and the incidence of mixed inflammatory cell infiltration was significantly decreased in 50,000 ppm males. 2-YEAR STUDY IN MICE: Groups of 50 male and 50 female mice were fed diets containing 0, 12,500, 25,000, or 50,000 ppm milk thistle extract (equivalent to average daily doses of approximately 1,610, 3,530, or 7,770 mg/kg to males and 1,500, 3,175, or 7,180 mg/kg to females) for 105 to 106 weeks. Exposure to milk thistle extract had no effect on survival of male or female mice. The mean body weights of the 25,000 ppm groups were less than those of controls after week 25; mean body weights of 50,000 ppm groups were less than those of controls after week 12. Feed consumption by exposed groups of males and females was generally similar to that by the controls throughout the study. Significantly decreased incidences of hepatocellular adenoma and hepatocellular carcinoma occurred in 50,000 ppm males, and decreased incidences of hepatocellular adenoma or carcinoma (combined) occurred in 25,000 and 50,000 ppm males. GENETIC TOXICOLOGY: Five milk thistle extracts were tested independently in bacterial mutagenicity studies using a variety of S. typhimurium tester strains and one E. coli strain. Results were negative in three of the five studies, with and without exogenous metabolic activation. In two studies, milk thistle extract was mutagenic in S. typhimurium strain TA98 in the presence of exogenous metabolic activation enzymes. Silymarin, a major constituent of milk thistle extract, was positive in S. typhimurium strains TA98 and TA100, when testing occurred in the presence of exogenous metabolic activation enzymes. Silybin, another component of milk thistle extract, was negative in a S. typhimurium gene mutation assay, with and without liver S9 activation enzymes. Administration of milk thistle extract in feed for 3 months did not increase the frequencies of micronucleated normochromatic erythrocytes, an indication of chromosomal abnormalities, in the peripheral blood of male or female B6C3F1 mice. CONCLUSIONS: Under the conditions of these 2-year feed studies, there was no evidence of carcinogenic activity of milk thistle extract in male or female F344/N rats or B6C3F1 mice exposed to 12,500, 25,000, or 50,000 ppm. Exposure to milk thistle extract resulted in increased incidences of clear cell and mixed cell foci in the liver of female rats and decreases in body weights of exposed groups of male and female mice. Decreased incidences of mammary gland neoplasms occurred in exposed groups of female rats, and decreased incidences of hepatocellular neoplasms occurred in exposed groups of male mice.",

The active complex of MT is a lipophilic extract from the seeds of the plant and is composed of three isomer flavonolignans (silybin, silydianin, and silychristin) collectively known as silymarin. Silybin is a component with the greatest degree of biological activity and makes up 50% to 70% of silymarin. Silymarin is found in the entire plant but it is concentrated in the fruit and seeds. Silymarin acts as an antioxidant by reducing free radical production and lipid peroxidation, has antifibrotic activity and may act as a toxin blockade agent by inhibiting binding of toxins to the hepatocyte cell membrane receptors. In animals, silymarin reduces liver injury caused by acetaminophen, carbon tetrachloride, radiation, iron overload, phenylhydrazine, alcohol, cold ischaemia and Amanita phalloides. Silymarin has been used to treat alcoholic liver disease, acute and chronic viral hepatitis and toxin-induced liver diseases.",

      "abstract": "Changes in life style over the past several decades including much of the time spent outdoors and the use of tanning devices for cosmetic purposes by individuals have led to an increase in the incidence of solar ultraviolet (UV) radiation-induced skin diseases including the risk of skin cancers. Solar UV radiations are considered as the most prevalent environmental carcinogens, and chronic exposure of the skin to UV leads to squamous and basal cell carcinoma and melanoma in human population. A wide variety of phytochemicals have been reported to have substantial anti-carcinogenic activity because of their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. Silymarin is one of them and extensively studied for its skin photoprotective capabilities. Silymarin, a flavanolignan, is extracted from the fruits and seeds of milk thistle (Silybum marianum L. Gaertn.), and has been shown to have chemopreventive effects against photocarcinogenesis in mouse tumor models. Topical treatment of silymarin inhibited photocarcinogenesis in mice in terms of tumor incidence, tumor multiplicity and growth of the tumors. Wide range of in vivo mechanistic studies conducted in a variety of mouse models indicated that silymarin has anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties which led to the prevention of photocarcinogenesis in mice. This review summarizes and updates the photoprotective potential of silymarin with the particular emphasis on its in vivo mechanism of actions. It is suggested that silymarin may favorably supplement sunscreen protection, and may be useful for skin diseases associated with solar UV radiation-induced inflammation, oxidative stress and immunomodulatory effects.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Despite limited preclinical and clinical investigations, milk thistle (MT) is often used for the treatment of chemotherapy-associated hepatotoxicity. Limited treatment options exist for chemotherapy-related hepatoxicity. Given the wide use of MT, the authors investigated MT in both the laboratory and a clinical setting. METHODS: In a double-blind study, children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and hepatic toxicity were randomized to MT or placebo orally for 28 days. Liver function tests were evaluated during the study period. To assess MT in vitro, the authors evaluated supratherapeutic concentrations in an ALL cell line. RESULTS: Fifty children were enrolled. No significant differences in frequency of side effects, incidence and severity of toxicities, or infections were observed between groups. There were no significant changes in mean amino alanine transferase (ALT), aspartate amino transferase (AST), or total bilirubin (TB) at Day 28. At Day 56, the MT group had a significantly lower AST (P = .05) and a trend toward a significantly lower ALT (P = .07). Although not significantly different, chemotherapy doses were reduced in 61% of the MT group compared with 72% of the placebo group. In vitro experiments revealed no antagonistic interactions between MT and vincristine or L-asparaginase in CCRF-CEM cells. A modest synergistic effect with vincristine was observed. CONCLUSIONS: In children with ALL and liver toxicity, MT was associated with a trend toward significant reductions in liver toxicity. MT did not antagonize the effects of chemotherapy agents used for the treatment of ALL. Future study is needed to determine the most effective dose and duration of MT and its effect on hepatotoxicity and leukemia-free survival.",

      "abstract": "Milk thistle (Silybum marianum) has been used in humans for the treatment of liver disease because of its antioxidant properties and its ability to stabilize cell membranes and regulate cell permeability. To investigate possible hepatoprotective effects in birds, standardized extracts (80%) of silymarin from milk thistle were tested in white Carneaux pigeons (Columba livia). Pigeons were separated into 3 groups and fed diets formulated to provide milk thistle at a level of 0, 10, or 100 mg/kg body weight per day. After acclimation, the birds were challenged with B1 aflatoxin (3 mg/kg body weight for 2 consecutive days) by oral gavage. Liver function then was assessed by hematologic testing and plasma biochemical analysis, liver histopathology, and hepatobiliary scintigraphy. Results of histopathology and hepatobiliary scintigraphy showed no protective effects from milk-thistle administration. Aflatoxin challenge resulted in hepatic inflammation and necrosis, biliary-duct hyperplasia, and lymphocyte infiltration. All hepatobiliary scintigraphy elements increased significantly after aflatoxin challenge. Bile acid levels and plasma enzyme concentrations of aspartate aminotransferase, lactate dehydrogenase, alanine aminotransferase, and creatine phosphokinase all increased after aflatoxin exposure and were mostly unchanged with consumption of milk thistle. Only birds fed 10 mg/kg body weight milk thistle showed significant reductions in lactate dehydrogenase, alanine aminotransferase, and creatine phosphokinase concentrations after aflatoxin exposure. Our results show that consumption of milk thistle is not associated with hepatoprotective effects against acute B1 aflatoxin exposure in pigeons.",

      "abstract": "Silymarin encompasses a group of flavonolignans that are extracted from Silybum marianum (Asteraceae) fruits. The silymarins have previously been reported to lower low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels associated with high-fat diets. The present study reports the efficacy of the silymarins in inhibiting oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL) generation and subsequent scavenger receptor (SR) mediated monocyte adherence to oxLDL. The flavonolignans that comprise silymarin include silichristin (SC), silidianin (SD), silibinin (SBN), and isosilibinin (IS). These flavonolignans (300 microM) lowered oxLDL generation, measured by the thiobarbituric acid-reacting substances (TBARS) assay, by 60.0, 28.1, 60.0, and 30.1%, respectively. SBN treatment of LDL in the presence of copper sulfate (CuSO 4) resulted in a significant dose-dependent inhibition of monocyte adhesion. Inhibition was paralleled by a decrease in binding of anti-oxLDL antibodies recognized by U937 monocyte Fc gamma receptors (FcgammaR). These results showed that silymarin and SBN, likely through antioxidant and free radical scavenging mechanisms of action, inhibit the generation of oxLDL and oxidation-specific neoepitopes recognized by SR and FcgammaR expressed on monocytes/macrophages.",

      "abstract": "Phytochemicals have shown promise in inhibiting UV-induced oxidative stress, and therefore are considered as potent inhibitors of UV-induced oxidative stress-mediated skin diseases. We have shown previously that topical treatment of silymarin, a flavonoid from milk thistle (Silybum marianum), inhibits UV-induced oxidative stress in mouse skin. However, the cellular targets responsible for the inhibition of UV-induced oxidative stress by silymarin are not clearly defined. To address this issue, C3H/HeN mice were UV irradiated (90 mJ cm(-2)) with or without topical treatment with silymarin (1 mg cm(-2) skin area). Mice were killed 48 h later and skin samples collected. Flow cytometric analysis of viable dermal cells revealed that the number of infiltrating CD11b+ cells were the major source of oxidative stress (31.8%) in UV-irradiated skin compared with non-UV-exposed skin (0.4%). Treatment of silymarin inhibited UV-induced oxidative stress through inhibition of infiltrating CD11b+ cells. The analysis of myeloperoxidase also indicated that silymarin significantly (P < 0.001) decreased UV-induced infiltration of leukocytes, and this effect of silymarin was similar to that of intraperitoneal treatment of mice with monoclonal antibodies to CD11b. The inhibitory effect of silymarin, regardless of whether it is topically treated before or after UV irradiation, was of similar magnitude. Intraperitoneal administration of monoclonal antibodies to CD11b (rat IgG2b) to C3H/HeN mice inhibited UVB-induced oxidative stress generated by both epidermal and dermal cells as is evident by relative fluorescence intensity of oxidized rhodamine. Similar to the effect of anti-CD11b, silymarin also inhibited UV-induced oxidative stress in both epidermal and dermal cells. Further, CD11b+ and CD11b- cell subsets from UV-treated or silymarin+UV-treated mice were separated by immunomagnetic cell isolation technique from total epidermal and dermal single cell suspensions and analyzed for reactive oxygen species (ROS)/H2O2 production. Analytic data revealed that CD11b+ cell population from UV-irradiated skin resulted in significantly higher production of ROS in both epidermis and dermis than CD11b- cell population, and that silymarin inhibited UV-induced oxidative stress through targeting infiltrating the CD11b+ cell type in the skin.",

Randomised clinical trials have assessed whether extracts of milk thistle, Silybum marianum (L) Gaertneri, have any effect in patients with alcoholic and/or hepatitis B or C virus liver diseases. OBJECTIVES: To assess the beneficial and harmful effects of milk thistle or milk thistle constituents versus placebo or no intervention in patients with alcoholic liver disease and/or viral liver diseases (hepatitis B and hepatitis C). SEARCH STRATEGY: The Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register, The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and full text searches were combined (July 2007). Manufacturers and researchers in the field were contacted. SELECTION CRITERIA: Only randomised clinical trials in patients with alcoholic and/or hepatitis B or C virus liver diseases (acute and chronic) were included. Interventions encompassed milk thistle at any dose or duration versus placebo or no intervention. The trials could be double blind, single blind, or unblinded. The trials could be unpublished or published and no language limitations were applied. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: The primary outcome measure was mortality. Binary outcomes are reported as relative risks (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI). Subgroup analyses were performed with regard to methodological quality. MAIN RESULTS: Eighteen randomised clinical trials assessed milk thistle in 1088 patients with alcoholic and/or hepatitis B or C virus liver diseases. The methodological quality was low: only 28.6% of the trials reported high methodological quality characteristics. Milk thistle versus placebo or no intervention had no significant effect on mortality (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.15), complications of liver disease (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.09), or liver histology. Liver-related mortality was significantly reduced by milk thistle in all trials (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.29 to 0.88), but not in high-quality trials (RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.28 to 1.19). Milk thistle was not associated with a significantly increased risk of adverse events (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.46 to 1.50). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Our results question the beneficial effects of milk thistle for patients with alcoholic and/or hepatitis B or C virus liver diseases and highlight the lack of high-quality evidence to support this intervention. Adequately conducted and reported randomised clinical trials on milk thistle versus placebo are needed.",

We tested the hypothesis that consumption of silibinin or silipide, a silibinin formulation with pharmaceutical properties superior to the unformulated agent, affect breast cancer development in the C3(1) SV40 T,t antigen transgenic multiple mammary adenocarcinoma mouse model. Mice received silibinin or silipide (0.2% silibinin equivalents) with their diet from weaning, and tumour development was monitored by weekly palpation and the number and weight of neoplasms at the end of the experiment. Intervention neither promoted, nor interfered with, tumour development. The result suggests that promotion of carcinogenesis is not a feature of silibinin consistent across rodent models of mammary carcinogenesis.",

      "abstract": "Milk thistle extracts have been used as traditional herbal remedies for almost 2000 years. The extracts are still widely used to protect the liver against toxins and to control chronic liver diseases. Recent experimental and clinical studies suggest that milk thistle extracts also have anticancer, antidiabetic, and cardioprotective effects. This article reviews clinical trials of milk thistle conducted in the past 5 years including pharmacokinetic and toxicity studies, herb-drug interactions, and other safety issues. Several trials have studied the effects of milk thistle for patients with liver diseases, cancer, hepatitis C, HIV, diabetes, and hypercholesterolemia. Promising results have been reported in the protective effect of milk thistle in certain types of cancer, and ongoing trials will provide more evidence about this effect. In addition, new established doses and improvement on the quality and standardization of this herb will provide the much-awaited evidence about the efficacy of milk thistle in the treatment of liver diseases. Milk thistle extracts are known to be safe and well tolerated, and toxic or adverse effects observed in the reviewed clinical trials seem to be minimal. The future of milk thistle research is promising, and high-quality randomized clinical trials on milk thistle versus placebo may be needed to further demonstrate the safety and efficacy of this herb.",

      "abstract": "Extracts of milk thistle have been recognized for centuries as \"liver tonics\" and are well-known to prevent or reverse hepatotoxicity of reactive drug metabolites or naturally occurring toxins. Milk thistle extracts are now under intense study in the experimental therapeutics of cancer for chemoprevention, treatment, and amelioration of chemotherapy side effects. Precision in nomenclature, however, has lagged behind this progress. The crude commercial product of milk thistle is termed silymarin, a complex of at least 7 flavonolignans and 1 flavonoid that comprises 65% to 80% of milk thistle extract. From silymarin is derived silibinin, a semipurified fraction once thought to be a single compound but now recognized as a 1:1 mixture of 2 diastereoisomers, silybin A and silybin B. The distinction between silymarin and silibinin is not only important to understanding the historical literature, but thorough characterization and use of chemically defined mixtures in preclinical and clinical studies are essential to the progress of these botanical compounds as human therapeutics. As a result, we urge clinicians and preclinical investigators alike to exercise rigor in nomenclature and use pure compounds or precisely defined chemical mixtures in subsequent studies. Herein, we provide a guide to the proper nomenclature and composition of milk thistle extracts and discuss the known pharmacokinetic studies of these botanical medicines. The drug-interaction potential of these extracts appears to be quite low, and in fact, silibinin appears to synergize with the antitumor effects of some commonly used chemotherapeutics. However, some precautions are advised as high-dose, phase II studies are conducted.",

Silymarin, derived from the milk thistle plant, Silybium marianum, has been used in traditional medicine as a remedy for diseases of the liver and biliary tract. In the present study, the effect of hepatoprotective drug silymarin on body weight and biochemical parameters, particularly, antioxidant status of ethanol-exposed rats was studied and its efficacy was compared with the potent antioxidant, ascorbic acid as well as capacity of hepatic regeneration during abstention. Ethanol, at a dose of 1.6 g/kg body wt/day for 4 wks affected body weight in 16-18 week-old male albino rats (Wistar strain weighing 200-220 g). Thiobarbituric acid reactive substance (TBARS) level, superoxide dismutase (SOD), and glutathione-s-transferase (GST) activities were significantly increased, whereas GSH content, and catalase, glutathione reductase (GR) and GPx (glutathione peroxidase) activities significantly reduced, on ethanol exposure. These changes were reversed by silybin and ascorbic acid treatment. It was also observed that abstinence from ethanol might help in hepatic regeneration. Silybin showed a significant hepatoprotective activity, but activity was less than that of ascorbic acid. Furthermore, preventive measures were more effective than curative treatment.",

The randomized clinical trials were evaluated by components of methodological quality. RESULTS: Thirteen randomized clinical trials assessed MT in 915 patients with alcoholic and/or hepatitis B or C liver diseases. The methodological quality was low: only 23% of the trials reported adequate allocation concealment and only 46% were considered double blind. MT versus placebo or no intervention for a median duration of 6 months had no significant effects on all-cause mortality (relative risk (RR) 0.78, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.53-1.15), complications of liver disease, or liver histology. Liver-related mortality was significantly reduced by MT in all trials (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.29-0.88), but not in high-quality trials (RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.28-1.19). MT was not associated with a significantly increased risk of adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: Based on high-quality trials, MT does not seem to significantly influence the course of patients with alcoholic and/or hepatitis B or C liver diseases. MT could potentially affect liver injury. Adequately conducted randomized clinical trials on MT versus placebo may be needed.",

      "abstract": "Extracts from the seeds of milk thistle, Silybum marianum, are known commonly as silibinin and silymarin and possess anticancer actions on human prostate carcinoma in vitro and in vivo. Seven distinct flavonolignan compounds and a flavonoid have been isolated from commercial silymarin extracts. Most notably, two pairs of diastereomers, silybin A and silybin B and isosilybin A and isosilybin B, are among these compounds. In contrast, silibinin is composed only of a 1:1 mixture of silybin A and silybin B. With these isomers now isolated in quantities sufficient for biological studies, each pure compound was assessed for antiproliferative activities against LNCaP, DU145, and PC3 human prostate carcinoma cell lines. Isosilybin B was the most consistently potent suppressor of cell growth relative to either the other pure constituents or the commercial extracts. Isosilybin A and isosilybin B were also the most effective suppressors of prostate-specific antigen secretion by androgen-dependent LNCaP cells. Silymarin and silibinin were shown for the first time to suppress the activity of the DNA topoisomerase IIalpha gene promoter in DU145 cells and, among the pure compounds, isosilybin B was again the most effective. These findings are significant in that isosilybin B composes no more than 5% of silymarin and is absent from silibinin. Whereas several other more abundant flavonolignans do ultimately influence the same end points at higher exposure concentrations, these findings are suggestive that extracts enriched for isosilybin B, or isosilybin B alone, might possess improved potency in prostate cancer prevention and treatment.",

Randomised clinical trials have assessed whether extracts of milk thistle, Silybum marianum (L) Gaertneri, have any effect in patients with alcoholic and/or hepatitis B or C virus liver diseases. OBJECTIVES: To assess the beneficial and harmful effects of milk thistle or milk thistle constituents versus placebo or no intervention in patients with alcoholic liver disease and/or viral liver diseases (hepatitis B and hepatitis C). SEARCH STRATEGY: The Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register, The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and full text searches were combined (December 2003). Manufacturers and researchers in the field were contacted. SELECTION CRITERIA: Only randomised clinical trials in patients with alcoholic and/or hepatitis B or C virus liver diseases (acute and chronic) were included. Interventions encompassed milk thistle at any dose or duration versus placebo or no intervention. The trials could be double blind, single blind, or unblinded. The trials could be unpublished or published and no language limitations were applied. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: The primary outcome measure was mortality. Binary outcomes are reported as relative risks (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI). Subgroup analyses were performed with regard to methodological quality. MAIN RESULTS: Thirteen randomised clinical trials assessed milk thistle in 915 patients with alcoholic and/or hepatitis B or C virus liver diseases. The methodological quality was low: only 23% of the trials reported adequate allocation concealment and only 46% were considered adequately double-blinded. Milk thistle versus placebo or no intervention had no significant effect on mortality (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.15), complications of liver disease (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.09), or liver histology. Liver-related mortality was significantly reduced by milk thistle in all trials (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.29 to 0.88), but not in high-quality trials (RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.28 to 1.19). Milk thistle was not associated with a significantly increased risk of adverse events (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.46 to 1.50). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Our results question the beneficial effects of milk thistle for patients with alcoholic and/or hepatitis B or C virus liver diseases and highlight the lack of high-quality evidence to support this intervention. Adequately conducted and reported randomised clinical trials on milk thistle versus placebo are needed.",

A pre-treatment step involving refluxing with petroleum ether is usually performed before extraction of the silymarins using organic solvents. This paper compares the extraction of whole and defatted milk thistle seeds in various solvents as a function of temperature. The extraction of whole seeds of milk thistle with water at 50, 70 and 85 degrees C was also examined: the yield of silymarin increased with increasing water temperature. In most cases, ethanol at 60 degrees C recovered the largest quantities of silymarins. However, boiling water proved to be an efficient extraction solvent for the more polar silymarins such as taxifolin and silychristin, even when using whole seeds. Extractions of defatted seed meal with boiling ethanol returned maximum yields of 0.62, 3.89, 4.04, and 6.86 mg/g defatted seed of taxifolin, silychristin, silybinin A and silybinin B, respectively. When extracting defatted seed meal with ethanol, yields of taxifolin, silybinin A and silybinin B were, respectively, 6.8-, 0.95-, 1.7- and 1.6-fold higher than when extracting whole seeds. When extracting with boiling water, the yields of silychristin, silybinin A, and silybinin B were 380, 47 and 50% higher for whole seeds compared with defatted seeds.",

SUBJECTS: Ten healthy subjects. INTERVENTION: Indinavir 800 mg 3 times/day was given for four doses on days 1 and 2. Silymarin 160 mg 3 times/day was given on days 3-15. On day 16 and for one dose on day 17, both drugs were given at the same dosages.

Blood samples were collected -0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 hours after indinavir dosing and assayed by high-performance liquid chromatography. The final pharmacokinetic model had first-order absorption after a lag time, and two compartments with first-order elimination from the central compartment. When given alone and combined with silymarin, respectively, the geometric mean (95% confidence interval [CI]) steady-state indinavir area under the plasma concentration-time curve was 20.7 hr x mg/L (15.3-28.2 hr x mg/L) and 19.4 hr x mg/L (15.8-23.6 hr x mg/L) and the trough plasma concentration was 0.340 mg/L (0.232-0.497 mg/L) and 0.232 mg/L (0.129-0.419 mg/L).

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: Milk thistle, an herbal compound, is the dietary supplement taken most frequently by patients with chronic liver disease. We performed a systematic review of the literature to determine the efficacy and safety of this herb for the treatment of liver disease. METHODS: We searched English and non-English reports through July 1999 using thirteen databases and reference lists, and contacting manufacturers and technical experts. Reviewers independently screened all reports to identify randomized placebo-controlled trials that evaluated milk thistle for the treatment of liver disease. Outcomes of primary interest included mortality, histological findings on liver biopsy specimens, serum aminotransferase and albumin levels, and prothrombin times. RESULTS: Fourteen trials met inclusion criteria. Four trials reported outcomes for mortality among 433 participants. The overall summary odds ratio for mortality in the milk thistle group compared with placebo was 0.8 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.5 to 1.5; P = 0.6). Three trials assessed histology on liver biopsy; study quality was inversely associated with the likelihood of histological benefit for milk thistle compared with placebo. There were no differences in serum alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, or albumin levels, or prothrombin times, among participants assigned to milk thistle compared with those assigned to placebo. The only statistically significant difference was a greater reduction in alanine aminotransferase levels among patients with chronic liver disease assigned to milk thistle (-9 IU/L, 95% CI: -18 to -1 IU/L; P = 0.05), but this reduction was of negligible clinical importance and no longer statistically significant after limiting analyses to studies of longer duration or of higher quality. The frequency of adverse effects was low and, in clinical trials, indistinguishable from placebo. CONCLUSION: Treatment with milk thistle appears to be safe and well tolerated. We found no reduction in mortality, in improvements in histology at liver biopsy, or in biochemical markers of liver function among patients with chronic liver disease. Data are too limited to exclude a substantial benefit or harm of milk thistle on mortality, and also to support recommending this herbal compound for the treatment of liver disease.",

DESIGN: Prospective open-label drug interaction study. SETTING: Outpatient clinic. SUBJECTS: Ten healthy volunteers. Intervention. Blood samples were collected over 8 hours after the volunteers took four doses of indinavir 800 mg every 8 hours on an empty stomach for baseline pharmacokinetics. This dosing and sampling were repeated after the subjects took milk thistle 175 mg (confirmed to contain silymarin 153 mg, the active ingredient) 3 times/day for 3 weeks. After an 11-day washout, indinavir dosing and blood sampling were repeated to evaluate the offset of any potential interaction. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Indinavir concentrations were measured by using a validated high-performance liquid chromatography method. The following pharmacokinetic parameters were determined: highest concentration (Cmax), hour-0 concentration, hour-8 concentration (C8), time to reach Cmax, and area under the plasma concentration-time curve over the 8-hour dosing interval (AUC8). Milk thistle did not alter significantly the overall exposure of indinavir, as evidenced by a 9% reduction in the indinavir AUC8 after 3 weeks of dosing with milk thistle, although the least squares mean trough level (C8) was significantly decreased by 25%. CONCLUSION: Milk thistle in commonly administered dosages should not interfere with indinavir therapy in patients infected with the human immunodeficiency virus.",

Silymarin is a derivative from the milk thistle plant with few side effects that has been safely used for centuries to treat liver ailments. Since the 1970s, there has been a reemergence of the marketing and use of silymarin. Research results of some small studies suggest silymarin has hepatoprotective, antiinflammatory, and regenerative properties producing a beneficial effect for some types of hepatitis. It is unclear, however, whether silymarin might interfere with the effect of interferon or ribavirin. A well-designed, placebo-controlled study of a larger population is needed. It is certainly encouraging that a large collaborative study is currently underway for milk thistle therapy in hepatitis C. This study is funded by NCCAM, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), and the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK).

      "abstract": "Milk thistle extract is one of the most commonly used nontraditional therapies, particularly in Germany. Milk thistle is known to contain a number of flavonolignans. We evaluated the effect of silymarin, on the activity of various hepatic drug-metabolizing enzymes in human hepatocyte cultures. Treatment with silymarin (0.1 and 0.25 mM) significantly reduced the activity of CYP3A4 enzyme (by 50 and 100%, respectively) as determined by the formation of 6-beta-hydroxy testosterone and the activity of uridine diphosphoglucuronosyl transferase (UGT1A6/9) (by 65 and 100%, respectively) as measured by the formation of 4-methylumbelliferone glucuronide. Silymarin (0.5 mM) also significantly decreased mitochondrial respiration as determined by MTT reduction in human hepatocytes. These observations point to the potential of silymarin to impair hepatic metabolism of certain coadministered drugs in humans. Indiscriminate use of herbal products may lead to altered pharmacokinetics of certain drugs and may result in increased toxicity of certain drugs.",

      "abstract": "Several studies from our laboratory have shown the cancer chemopreventive and anti-carcinogenic effects of silymarin, a flavonoid antioxidant isolated from milk thistle, in long-term tumorigenesis models and in human prostate, breast and cervical carcinoma cells. Since silymarin is composed mainly of silibinin with small amounts of other stereoisomers of silibinin, in the present communication, studies were performed to assess whether the cancer preventive and anti-carcinogenic effects of silymarin are due to its major component silibinin. Treatment of different prostate, breast, and cervical human carcinoma cells with silibinin resulted in a highly significant inhibition of both cell growth and DNA synthesis in a time-dependent manner with large loss of cell viability only in case of cervical carcinoma cells. When compared with silymarin, these effects of silibinin were consistent and comparable in terms of cell growth and DNA synthesis inhibition, and loss of cell viability. Based on the comparable results of silibinin and silymarin, we suggest that the cancer chemopreventive and anti-carcinogenic effects of silymarin reported earlier are due to the main constituent silibinin.",

      "abstract": "Silymarin, derived from the milk thistle plant, Silybum marianum, has been used for centuries as a natural remedy for diseases of the liver and biliary tract. As interest in alternative therapy has emerged in the United States, gastroenterologists have encountered increasing numbers of patients taking silymarin with little understanding of its purported properties. Silymarin and its active constituent, silybin, have been reported to work as antioxidants scavenging free radicals and inhibiting lipid peroxidation. Studies also suggest that they protect against genomic injury, increase hepatocyte protein synthesis, decrease the activity of tumor promoters, stabilize mast cells, chelate iron, and slow calcium metabolism. In this article we review silymarin's history, pharmacology, and properties, and the clinical trials pertaining to patients with acute and chronic liver disease.",
