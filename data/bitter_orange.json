      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Mothers of neonates admitted to the intensive care unit are prone to sleep disorders due to stress and anxiety. Some herbs have anti-anxiety and sedative properties. This study aimed to investigate the effect of bitter orange blossom distillate on anxiety and sleep disorders in mothers with infants admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit. METHODS: This randomized controlled clinical trial was conducted from 2021 May 15 to 2022 February 2, on 60 mothers with NICU-admitted infants in one of the medical teaching centers affiliated with Babol University of Medical Sciences, Iran. Permuted block randomization was used to assign the mothers to the experimental (bitter orange blossom distillate syrup) and control groups (syrup prepared from water and sugar). Given the impossibility of blinding the participants, allocation concealment was used to prevent the researcher from predicting the future allocation of the samples to the groups. In addition, the statistical consultant received coded data pertaining to the type of intervention in each group. A demographic questionnaire, the Spielberger State and Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), and the General Sleep Disorder Scale were employed to collect data. We assessed the level of anxiety and sleep disorder (in both groups before the intervention and again after the last day of the intervention). Data were analyzed using SPSS V22 software. A P-value less than 0.05 were considered significant. RESULTS: The mean and standard deviation of the sleep disorder score in the intervention group from (50.26±5.81) to (44.70±6.94) and in the control group from (50.46±6.95) to (48.53±8.62) changed. The covariance test showed that bitter orange blossom distillate syrup has a significant effect on the improvement of sleep disorders (P = 0.01, Effect size = 0.09), but there was no significant difference in the State and Trait anxiety level of mothers (P = 0.122, 0.144 and Effect size = 0.04, 0.03) respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Due to the positive effect of bitter orange blossom distillate syrup on sleep disorders of mothers with hospitalized babies, this low-cost and low-risk intervention is recommended. TRIAL REGISTRATION: This study is registered at clinicaltrials.gov as Trial ID = IRCT20201209049666N1.",

The goals of our study were to give an overview of the safety and efficacy of p-synephrine, to systematically evaluate its efficacy regarding weight loss and to assess its safety, focusing on its cardiovascular side effects in a meta-analysis. PubMed, the Cochrane Library, Web of Science and Embase were searched for relevant studies. Only placebo-controlled, human clinical trials with synephrine intervention were included in the meta-analysis. The meta-analysis was reported according to the PRISMA guidelines using the PICOS format and taking into account the CONSORT recommendations. Altogether, 18 articles were included in the meta-analysis. Both systolic and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) increased significantly after prolonged use (6.37 mmHg, 95% CI: 1.02-11.72, p = 0.02 and 4.33 mmHg, 95% CI: 0.48-8.18, p = 0.03, respectively). The weight loss in the synephrine group was non-significant after prolonged treatment, and it did not influence body composition parameters. Based on the analyzed clinical studies, synephrine tends to raise blood pressure and heart rate, and there is no evidence that synephrine can facilitate weight loss. Further studies are needed to confirm evidence of its safety and efficacy.",

The NO0.25 group had a large improvement in growth efficiency at the end of the 60-day feeding cycle. Real-time PCR (Bio RAD, USA) system was used to detect variations in gene expression levels. Furthermore, NO supplementation of up to 0.25% in muscle tissue controlled the release of growth hormone (GH) and insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I). Furthermore, in the NO0.25 treatment category, immune response gene levels TNF-α, IL-8 and IL-1ß increased in head kidney tissue. In the histological examination of the liver and intestine, there were significant differences between fish fed with N1 and N1.5 diets. This study confirms that dietary supplementation of NO up to 0.25% can improve common carp growth efficiency and increase the expression of genes (GH and IGF-I) related to muscle growth, TNF-α, IL-8 and IL-1ß genes related to immune status, and liver and intestine histological status of common carp."

Once epilepsy and obesity are prevalent comorbid conditions and herb-drug interactions can compromise antiepileptic drugs safety, we aimed to evaluate the effects of C. aurantium extract on the pharmacokinetics of lamotrigine (LTG) in rats. In the first pharmacokinetic study, a single oral dose of C. aurantium extract (164 mg/kg; p.o.) was administered with a single oral dose of LTG (10 mg/kg; p.o.). In the following study, the C. aurantium extract was daily administered (164 mg/kg; p.o.) during 14 days followed by a single dose of LTG (10 mg/kg; p.o.) on the 15th day. From the pharmacokinetic analysis, no significant effects were observed after the co-administration of C. aurantium extract and LTG. After the 14-day pre-treatment period, the main effects of the extract were limited to a significantly decrease in the time to reach peak drug concentration (tmax;p < 0.05). Considering the minor effects induced by C. aurantium extract on the pharmacokinetics of LTG in rats, no relevant interactions are expected to occur in the clinical practice. Notwithstanding, C. aurantium safety in patients under LTG therapy should be further assessed in controlled clinical trials.",

Eligible postmenopausal women were allocated into one of two intervention groups or a control group (n = 52 per group) in a 1:1:1 ratio using a randomized block design. Intervention groups received 500 mg capsules containing only bitter orange or lavender flower powder, and the control group received 500 mg capsules containing starch. The Spielberger's State -Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) was used before and eight weeks after starting the intervention. Data analyses were based on intention to treat. RESULTS: A one-way ANOVA showed no significant difference in mean state anxiety (P = 0.254) and trait anxiety (p = 0.972) score among the three groups before the intervention. The general linear model, adjusted for baseline state and trait anxiety scores and confounding factors, showed significant differences among the groups in the mean state anxiety (P = 0.010) and trait anxiety (p = 0.041) score after eight weeks of treatment. Bitter orange significantly reduced the mean state-anxiety scores compared with the control group [Adjusted Mean Difference (aMD): -1.99 (95% Confidence Interval, -3.64 to -0.34)]. Lavender significantly reduced the mean state-anxiety scores compared with the control group as well [aMD: -2.45 (95% CI -4.13 to -0.77)] and Bitter orange significantly reduced the mean trait-anxiety scores compared with the control group [aMD: -1.76 (95% CI -3.45 to -0.06)]. Lavender significantly reduced the mean trait-anxiety scores compared with the control group as well [aMD: -2.05 (95% CI -3.76 to -0.33)]. There was no significant difference between bitter orange and lavender groups after intervention in the mean trait-anxiety (p = 0.731) or state-anxiety (p = 0.578) scores. CONCLUSION: The positive effect of bitter orange and lavender on anxiety in postmenopausal women suggests that they can be used to decrease anxiety in such women.",

      "abstract": "Bitter orange (Citrus aurantium L.) extracts are widely used in dietary supplements and bitter oranges are used in various juices and food products. p-Synephrine, the primary active constituent, comprises approximately 90% of total protoalkaloids. This study, performed per OECD 408 guidance, examined the 90-day subchronic safety/toxicity of an extract standardized to 50% p-synephrine at doses of 100, 300 and 1000 mg/kg/day to male and female rats. No adverse effects were observed with respect to any of the observed parameters of clinical signs, functional observations of sensory reactivity, grip strength and motor activity, ophthalmology, body weights, hematology, food consumption, urinalysis, organ weights, as well as gross and microscopic pathology at termination at any of the doses in either sex. Treatment at 1000 mg/kg body weight/day of the extract resulted in non-adverse effects including fully reversible signs of repetitive head burrowing in the bedding material and piloerection for short periods of time in both sexes immediately after administration, which gradually disappeared by treatment day-81. A slight and reversible elevation of BUN and urea levels in male rats, and slight to mild increase in the relative but not absolute heart weights of male and female rats was observed. Based on these results, the no-observed-effect-level (NOEL) for this bitter orange extract standardized to 50% p-synephrine was 300 mg/kg, while the no-observed-adverse-effect-level (NOAEL) was 1000 mg/kg. The results indicate a high degree of safety for this bitter orange extract."

This study was a randomized clinical trial conducted with 126 eligible primiparous patients. The pain severity of patients was measured at the time of enrolling in the study. In the intervention group, (aromatherapy) gauze squares were soaked in 4 ml of C. aurantium distillated water, and in the control group, gauze squares were soaked in 4 ml of normal saline; each gauze square was attached to the respective patients' collar. The intervention was repeated every 30 min. Pain severity was measured after the intervention at 3-4, 5-7, and 8-10 cm cervix dilatations. The two groups were standardized with regard to age, profession, education, desire to conceive, and number and severity of uterine contractions. The Bishop's score was also calculated. Before intervention, pain severity was the same for both groups, but following intervention, pain severity reduced in the intervention group at 3-4 centimeter (P < 0.05), 7-5 centimeter (P < 0.05), and 8-10 centimeter (P < 0.05) dilatations compared with that in the control group. The findings of the study revealed that aromatherapy using C. aurantium distillated water alleviates labor pain. This method is recommended because of its ease of use and low cost and because it is a non-aggressive method to reduce labor pain."

DESIGN: Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study. SETTING: University of Connecticut, Storrs Campus. SUBJECTS: Eighteen healthy volunteers aged 18 years or older. INTERVENTION: Subjects were given either placebo or bitter-orange dried-fruit extract (450 mg standardized to 27 mg of m- or p-synephrine) in phase 1. The opposite treatment was given during phase 2 after a washout period of at least 7 days. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The rate-corrected QT (QTc) interval and blood pressure were measured before dosing and at 1, 3, 5, and 8 hours after dosing. Mean+/-SD values of the maximum postdose values were compared between groups. Subjects receiving bitter-orange extract versus those receiving placebo had similar postdose QTc intervals (402+/-29 vs 403+/-24 msec, p=0.653), systolic blood pressure (114+/-10 vs 115+/-8 mm Hg, p=0.686) and diastolic blood pressure (68+/-9 vs 68+/-8, p=0.879). CONCLUSION: Bitter-orange dried-fruit extract standardized to m- or p-synephrine 27 mg did not significantly alter the QTc interval or blood pressure after a single dose was administered.

METHODS AND PATIENTS: Sixty patients participated in this study; they were classified into three groups (20 patients in each). All groups had comparable numbers of patients with tinea corporis, cruris, and pedis. Group 1 was treated with a 25% emulsion of oil of bitter orange (OBO) three times daily; group 2 was treated with 20% OBO in alcohol three times daily and group 3 was treated with pure OBO, once daily. Clinical and mycologic examinations were performed before therapy and every week until a complete cure had occurred. RESULTS: In group 1, 80% of patients were cured in 1 to 2 weeks and 20% in 2 to 3 weeks. In group 2, 50% were cured in 1 to 2 weeks, 30% in 2 to 3 weeks and 20% in 3 to 4 weeks. In group 3, 25% of patients did not continue the trial. Of the remaining patients, 33.3% were cured in one week, 60% in 1 to 2 weeks, and 6.7% in 2 to 3 weeks. Oil of bitter orange produced no side effects except mild irritation seen with the use of the pure form. CONCLUSIONS: An in vitro study showed that OBO (natural product) exerts fungistatic and fungicidal activity against a variety of pathogenic dermatophyte species. It is a promising, cheap, and available topical antifungal therapeutic agent.",
