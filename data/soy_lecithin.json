      "abstract": "This study investigated the effects of ultrasound-assisted soybean lecithin (SL) on the rehydration behavior and physical properties of egg white protein powder (EWPP) and its ability to enhance the efficacy of EWPP instant solubility. The results of rehydration, including wettability and dispersibility, indicated that ultrasound (200 W)-assisted SL (5 g/L) addition had the shortest wetting time and dispersion time, which were 307.14 ± 7.00 s and 20.95 ± 2.27 s, respectively. In terms of powder properties, the EWPP with added SL had lower lightness, moisture content and bulk density. In addition, the increase in average particle size, net negative charge, free sulfhydryl group content and surface hydrophobicity indicated that ultrasound treatment facilitated the protein structures unfolding and promoted the formation of SL-EWP complexes. Overall, our study provided a new perspective for the food industry regarding using ultrasound technology to produce instant EWPP with higher biological activity and more complete nutritional value."

      "abstract": "The low rehydration properties of commercial soy protein powder (SPI), a major plant-based food ingredient, have limited the development of plant-based foods. The present study proposes a treatment of soy lecithin modification combined with Alcalase hydrolysis to improve the rehydration of soy protein powder, as well as other processing properties (emulsification, viscosity). The results show that the soy protein-soy lecithin complex powder, which is hydrolyzed for 30 min (SPH-SL-30), has the smallest particle size, the smallest zeta potential, the highest surface hydrophobicity, and a uniform microstructure. In addition, the value of the ratio of the α-helical structure/β-folded structure was the smallest in the SPH-SL-30. After measuring the rehydration properties, emulsification properties, and viscosity, it was found that the SPH-SL-30 has the shortest wetting time of 3.04 min, the shortest dispersion time of 12.29 s, the highest solubility of 93.17%, the highest emulsifying activity of 32.42 m2/g, the highest emulsifying stability of 98.33 min, and the lowest viscosity of 0.98 pa.s. This indicates that the treatment of soy lecithin modification combined with Alcalase hydrolysis destroys the structure of soy protein, changes its physicochemical properties, and improves its functional properties. In this study, soy protein was modified by the treatment of soy lecithin modification combined with Alcalase hydrolysis to improve the processing characteristics of soy protein powders and to provide a theoretical basis for its high-value utilization in the plant-based food field."

      "abstract": "5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) is an antineoplastic agent known for its low bioavailability and limited cellular penetration, often resulting in adverse effects on healthy cells. Thus, finding vehicles that enhance bioavailability, enable controlled release, and mitigate adverse effects is crucial. The study focuses on encapsulating 5-FU within soy lecithin vesicles (SLVs) and assessing its impact on the carrier's properties and functionality. Results show that incorporating 5-FU does not affect SLVs' size or polydispersity, even postlyophilization. Liberation of 5-FU from SLVs requires system disruption rather than spontaneous release, with an encapsulation efficiency of approximately 43% determined using Square Wave Voltammetry. Cytotoxicity assays on colorectal cancer cells reveal SLV-based delivery's significant efficacy, surpassing free drug solution effects with 45% cell viability after 72 h vs 73% viability. The research addresses 5-FU's limited bioavailability by creating a biocompatible nanocarrier for efficient drug delivery, highlighting SLVs as promising for targeted cancer therapy due to sustained antiproliferative effects and improved cellular uptake. The study underscores the importance of tailored drug delivery systems in enhancing therapeutic outcomes and suggests SLV/5-FU formulations as a potential advancement in cancer treatment strategies.",

Ultrasonic power significantly affected the structure of the MFGM-SL complex, further promoting the unfolding of the molecular structure of the protein, and then increased solubility and surface hydrophobicity. Furthermore, the microstructure of mimicking MFG emulsions without sonication was unevenly distributed, and the average droplet diameter was large. After ultrasonic treatment, the droplets of the emulsion were more uniformly dispersed, the particle size was smaller, and the emulsification properties and stability were improved to varying degrees. Especially when the ultrasonic power was 300 W, the mimicking MFG emulsion had the highest encapsulation rate and emulsion activity index and emulsion stability index were increased by 60.88 % and 117.74 %, respectively. From the microstructure, it was observed that the spherical droplets of the mimicking MFG emulsion after appropriate ultrasonic treatment remain well separated without obvious flocculation. This study can provide a reference for the screening of milk fat globules mimicking membrane materials and the further utilization and development of ultrasound in infant formula.",

      "abstract": "RESEARCH BACKGROUND: Various approaches have been used to present functional lipids including lycopene in a palatable food form to consumers. However, being highly hydrophobic, lycopene is insoluble in aqueous systems and has a limited bioavailability in the body. Lycopene nanodispersion is expected to improve the properties of lycopene, but its stability and bioaccessibility are also affected by emulsifier type and environmental conditions such as pH, ionic strength and temperature. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: The influence of soy lecithin, sodium caseinate and soy lecithin/sodium caseinate at 1:1 ratio on the physicochemical properties and stability of lycopene nanodispersion prepared using the emulsification-evaporation methods before and after treatment at different pH, ionic strength and temperature were investigated. The in vitro bioaccessibility of the nanodispersions was also studied. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Under neutral pH conditions, nanodispersion stabilized with soy lecithin had the highest physical stability and the smallest particle size (78 nm), the lowest polydispersity index (PDI) value (0.180) and highest zeta potential (-64 mV) but the lowest lycopene concentration (1.826 mg/100 mL). Conversely, nanodispersion stabilized with sodium caseinate had the lowest physical stability. Combining the soy lecithin with sodium caseinate at 1:1 ratio resulted in a physically stable lycopene nanodispersion with the highest lycopene concentration (2.656 mg/100 mL). The lycopene nanodispersion produced by soy lecithin also had high physical stability under different pH range (pH=2-8) where the particle size, PDI and zeta potential remained fairly consistent. The nanodispersion containing sodium caseinate was unstable and droplet aggregation occurred when the pH was reduced close to the isoelectric point of sodium caseinate (pH=4-5). The particle size and PDI value of nanodispersion stabilized with soy lecithin and sodium caseinate mixture increased sharply when the NaCl concentration increased above 100 mM, while the soy lecithin and sodium caseinate counterparts were more stable. All of the nanodispersions showed good stability with respect to temperature changes (30-100 °C) except for the one stabilized by sodium caseinate, which exhibited an increased particle size when heated to above 60 °C. The combination of soy lecithin and sodium caseinate was found to increase the bioaccessibility of the lycopene nanodispersion. The physicochemical properties, stability and extent of the lycopene nanodispersion digestion highly depend on the emulsifier type. NOVELTY AND SCIENTIFIC CONTRIBUTION: Producing a nanodispersion is considered one of the best ways to overcome the poor water solubility, stability and bioavailability issues of lycopene. Currently, studies related to lycopene-fortified delivery systems, particularly in the form of nanodispersion, are still limited. The information obtained on the physicochemical properties, stability and bioaccessibility of lycopene nanodispersion is useful for the development of an effective delivery system for various functional lipids."

      "abstract": "To maximize the biological activity of branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs), it is necessary to find a new excipient agent to increase the bioavailability of BCAAs in protein mixtures. The aim of the current study was to investigate the effects of soy lecithin (SLC), zinc oxide (ZnO), and methylsulfonylmethane (MSM) on the bioaccessibility and intestinal transport of BCAAs from animal and plant protein mixtures (PMs) via an in vitro digestion model with human intestinal epithelial (Caco-2) cells. The bioaccessibility of total BCAAs in PMs considerably increased by 107.51 ± 1.50% with the addition of SLC, and the combined effects of SLC, ZnO, and MSM on enhancing the bioaccessibility of total BCAAs was observed (107.14 ± 0.18%). Interestingly, SLC showed a major role in binding bile acid, showing 65.78 ± 1.66% of binding capacity. Intestinal transport of BCAAs was measured to be at 100.48, 110.86, and 130.29 μg mL-1 for leucine, isoleucine, and valine, respectively, in PMs with SLC + ZnO + MSM, and it eventually amplified the amount of the total transported BCAAs (341.63 ± 6.34 μg mL-1), which was about 8.72 times higher than that of PM only. The cellular integrity of digesta-treated Caco-2 cells tended to decrease according to the incubation time, but it was recovered in the treatment of PM + SLC + ZnO + MSM, and nearly reached the control levels with 92.82 ± 0.53%. Results from the current study suggest that the co-consumption of proteins equally consisting of plant and animal sources with SLC, ZnO, and MSM could improve the bioavailability of total BCAAs, resulting in the improvement of health benefits.",

      "abstract": "We investigated a method to prepare liposomes; soy lecithin was dissolved in liquefied dimethyl ether (DME) at 0.56 MPa, which was then injected into warm water. Liposomes can be successfully prepared at warm water temperatures above 45 °C. The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of the obtained liposomes, size distribution, ζ-potential measurements by dynamic light scattering and the amount of residual medium were compared by gas chromatography using the conventional medium, diethyl ether. The size of the obtained liposomes was approximately 60-300 nm and the ζ-potential was approximately -57 mV, which was almost the same as that of the conventional medium. Additionally, for the conventional media, a large amount remained in the liposome dispersion even after removal by depressurization and dialysis membrane treatment; however, liquefied DME, owing to its considerably low boiling point, was completely removed by depressurization. Liquefied DME is a very attractive medium for the preparation of liposomes because it does not have the toxicity and residue problems of conventional solvents or the hazards of ethanol addition and high pressure of supercritical carbon dioxide; it is also environmentally friendly."

The use of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) has been the major chemotherapeutic treatment for colorectal cancer patients. However, the efficacy of 5-FU is limited by drug resistance, and bone marrow toxicity through high-level expression of thymidylate synthase, justifying the need for improvement of the therapeutic index. In this study, the effects of ultrasound on echogenic 5-FU encapsulated crude soy liposomes were investigated for their potential to address these challenges. Liposomes were prepared by thin-film hydration using crude soy lecithin and cholesterol. Argon gas was entrapped in the liposomes for sonosensitivity (that is, responsiveness to ultrasound). The nanoparticles were characterized for particle size and morphology. The physicochemical properties were also evaluated using differential scanning calorimetry, Fourier transform infrared and X-ray diffraction. The release profile of 5-FU was assessed with and without 20 kHz low-frequency ultrasound waves at various amplitudes and exposure times. The result reveal that 5-FU-loaded liposomes were spherical with an encapsulation efficiency of approximately 60%. Approximately 65% of 5-FU was released at the highest amplitude and exposure time was investigated. The results are encouraging for the stimulated and controlled release of 5-FU for the management of colorectal cancer."

In this study, different emulsification methods (high-speed homogenization, ultrasonic treatment and their combination) were employed for the preparation of emulsions stabilized by soybean protein isolate (SPI) and soy lecithin (SLT) at three ratios. The microstructure, hydrodynamic average diameter, ζ-potential, creaming stability and low-field nuclear magnetic resonance relaxation behaviors of emulsions were investigated. RESULTS: The results indicated that the influence of emulsification method was closely related to the ratio of SPI/SLT. Overall, the SPI-SLT-stabilized emulsion treated by ultrasound showed better stability and uniformity, while the combined treatment of high-speed homogenization and ultrasound was helpful in improving the uniformity and stability of SPI-stabilized Pickering emulsion. However, the SLT-stabilized emulsions all exhibited worse uniformity in terms of particle size distribution and polydispersity index. CONCLUSION: These results will be helpful for selecting an appropriate emulsification method and emulsifier to improve the stability of emulsions. © 2021 Society of Chemical Industry.",

The effect of membrane composition and concentrations on the degradation of liposomes prepared via the extrusion method was investigated. Liposomes were prepared using a mixture of SQ, cholesterol (CH) and Tween80 (TW80). Based on the optimal conditions, liposome batches were prepared in the absence and presence of SQ. Their physicochemical and stability behavior were evaluated as a function of liposome constituent. From the optimization study, the liposomal formulation containing 5% (w/w) mixed soy lecithin (ML), 0.5% (w/w) SQ, 0.3% (w/w) CH and 0.75% (w/w) TW80 had optimal physicochemical properties and displayed a unilamellar structure. Liposome prepared using the optimal formulation had a low particle size (158.31 ± 2.96 nm) and acceptable %increase in the particle size (15.09% ± 3.76%) and %trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (%TEAC) loss (35.69% ± 0.72%) against UV light treatment (280-320 nm) for 6 h. The interesting outcome of this research was the association of naturally occurring substance SQ for size reduction without the extra input of energy or mechanical procedures, and improvement of vesicle stability and antioxidant activity of ML-based liposome. This study also demonstrated that the presence of SQ in the membrane might increase the acyl chain dynamics and decrease the viscosity of the dispersion, thereby limiting long-term stability of the liposome.",

      "abstract": "This study used highly lipophilic agents with an aim to increase the oxidant inhibitory activity and enhance photothermal stability of a novel mixed soy lecithin (ML)-based liposome by changing the composition of formulation within the membrane. Specifically, the development and optimization of the liposome intended for improving Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC) value and %TEAC loss was carried out by incorporating a natural antioxidant, quercetin (QU). In this context, a focus was set on QU encapsulation in ML-based liposomes and the concentration-dependent solubility of QU was investigated and calculated as encapsulation efficiency (EE). To explore the combined effects of the incorporation of plant sterols on the integrity and entrapment capacity of mixed phospholipid vesicles, conjugation of two types of phytosterols (PSs), namely β-sitosterol (βS) and stigmasterol (ST), to mixed membranes at different ratios was also performed. The EE measurement revealed that QU could be efficiently encapsulated in the stable ML-based liposome using 0.15 and 0.1 g/100 mL of βS and ST, respectively. The aforementioned liposome complex exhibited a considerable TEAC (197.23%) and enhanced TEAC loss (30.81%) when exposed to ultraviolet (UV) light (280-320 nm) over a 6 h duration. It appeared that the presence and type of PSs affect the membrane-integration characteristics as well as photodamage transformation of the ML-based liposome. The association of QU with either βS or ST in the formulation was justified by their synergistic effects on the enhancement of the EE of liposomes. Parallel to this, it was demonstrated that synergistic PS effects could be in effect in the maintenance of membrane order of the ML-based liposome. The findings presented in this study provided useful information for the development and production of stable QU-loaded ML-based liposomes for food and nutraceutical applications and could serve as a potential mixed lipids-based delivery system in the disease management using antioxidant therapy."

      "abstract": "Felid semen has historically been frozen using an egg yolk-based cryopreservation medium. However, the use of egg introduces several potential concerns, such as variability in composition, microbial contamination, and regulatory issues. In the present study, our aim was to compare a chemically-defined, soy-based medium (SOY) to a commercial egg yolk-based medium (TEY) for the cryopreservation of sperm in four imperiled small cat species. Semen was collected from adult male cats (n = 6 black-footed cats; n = 6 sand cats; n = 4 fishing cats; and n = 7 Pallas' cats) via electroejaculation, split into two aliquots, and cryopreserved in SOY or TEY. Frozen-thawed samples were evaluated for sperm motility and rate of progressive motility (up to 24 h post-thaw) and acrosome status (0 and 6 h). No difference in post-thaw traits were observed between treatments in all four species. Heterologous IVF using oocytes collected laparoscopically from domestic cats demonstrated no difference among freezing treatments in percentage of mature oocytes that cleaved or the mean number of blastomeres at 48 h post-insemination. More spermatozoa frozen with SOY were bound to the zona pellucida in the sand cat (P = 0.018), but no treatment effect was observed in the other three species. These findings collectively demonstrate that SOY may be a preferable alternative to TEY for sperm cryopreservation in these four wild felid species.",

Lecithin that was derived from naturally occurring in soybeans (SL) has introduced some auspicious accomplishments to the drug carrying aspect, like effectual encapsulation, controlled release, and successful delivery of the curative factors to intracellular regions in which they procure these properties from their flexible physicochemical and biophysical properties, such as large aqueous center and biocompatible lipid, self-assembly, tunable properties, and high loading capacity. Despite the almost perfect properties as a drug carrier, liposome is known to be quite quickly eliminated from the body systems. The surface modification of liposomes has been investigated in many studies to overcome this drawback. In this review, we intensively discussed the surface-modified liposomes that enhancing the targeting, cellular uptake, and therapeutic response. Moreover, the recent applications of soy lecithin-derived liposome, focusing on cancer treatment, brain targeting, and vaccinology, are also summarized.",

      "abstract": "Soy lecithin has been shown to play a critical role in cell signaling and cellular membrane structure. In addition, it has been shown to increase biocompatibility, hydrophilicity, and decrease cytotoxicity. Gold nanoparticles have also shown to improve cellularity. Lecithin, gold nanoparticles, and polycaprolactone (PCL) solutions were electrospun in order to develop unique mesh materials for the treatment of osteoarthritis. The electrospinning parameters were optimized to achieve different solution ratios for fiber optimization. The amount of lecithin mixed with PCL varied from 30 wt.% to 50 wt.% . Gold nanoparticles (1% to 10% concentrations) were also added to lecithin-PCL mixture. The mechanical and chemical properties of the fiber mesh were analyzed via contact angle test, tensile mechanical tests, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Cell viability was measured using a WST-1 Assay. Scanning electron microscopy confirmed the successful formation of fiber mesh. The compositions of 40% soy lecithin with PCL in 40% solvent (40:40) resulted in the most well-formed fiber mesh. DSC melt temperatures were statically insignificant; uniaxial stresses and the moduli resulted in no significant difference between the test composition and pristine PCL compositions. WST-1 assay revealed all compositions were non-cytotoxic. Overall, the addition of lecithin increased hydrophilicity while maintaining cell viability and the mechanical and chemical properties of PCL. This study demonstrated that it is possible to successfully electrospin a lecithin, gold nanoparticle, and polycaprolactone scaffold for tissue engineering applications.",

Twelve dogs (n = 12) were selected, and semen was cooled and assessed after 2, 24, 48, 72, 96 or 120 h. At each time point, sperm were analyzed for kinetic patterns (using computer-assisted sperm analysis), mitochondrial activity (3'3- diaminobenzidine assay), lipid peroxidation (TBARS assay), DNA fragmentation (SCSA®) and plasma and acrosome membrane integrity (eosin/nigrosin and fast green/rose Bengal stains, respectively). The Control group (1814.4 ± 197.2) presented the highest rates of lipid peroxidation at 120 h. Conversely, progressive motility (42.8 ± 4%), linearity (45.4 ± 1%), and VAP (88 ± 3%) were higher in the Control group. In addition, there was lower mitochondrial activity in the Control group at 72 h. Therefore, our data show that lecithin used at these concentrations was not able to maintain sperm viability at as high qualities as would egg yolk. Moreover, the decrease in high mitochondrial activity and the persistence of sperm motility may indicate a compensatory mechanism in canine spermatozoa (i.e., glycolytic pathway). Furthermore, these higher lipid peroxidation indexes could indicate the necessity for future therapy using extenders and antioxidants over a long cooling time for dog sperm.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Lecithin is a complex mixture of phospholipids which compose lipid bilayer cell membranes. Lipid replacement therapy, or administration of phospholipids for the purpose of repairing the dmaged cell membranes, had been shown to alleviate fatigue. The present study aimed to investigate the effect of soy lecithin on fatigue in middle-aged women, as well as other menopausal symptoms and various health parameters. METHODS: This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study included 96 women aged 40 to 60 years who complained of fatigue. The participants were randomized to receive active tablets containing high-dose (1200 mg/day; n = 32) or low-dose (600 mg/day; n = 32) soy lecithin, or placebo (n = 32), for 8 weeks. The following parameters were evaluated: age, menopausal status, lifestyle factors, physical and psychological symptoms of menopause, subjective symptoms of insomnia and fatigue, body composition, cardiovascular parameters, and physical activities and objective sleep states obtained from actigraphy before and 4 and 8 weeks after treatment. Fatigue was evaluated using the Profile of Mood States (POMS)-brief, Menopausal Health-Related Quality of Life questionnaire, Chalder Fatigue Scale, and Brief Fatigue Inventory. RESULTS: Eighty-nine women completed the study. There were no significant differences in the changes in Chalder Fatigue Scale score (placebo vs low-dose vs high-dose groups: -2.9 ± 1.1, -3.2 ± 1.1, and -3.5 ± 1.0; P = 0.79). On the other hand, the improvements were greater in the high-dose group compared with the placebo group concerning vigor scores in the POMS-brief (1.9 ± 0.7 vs 0.2 ± 0.6; P = 0.02), diastolic blood pressure (-4.1 ± 1.8 vs 1.2 ± 1.9; P = 0.05), and cardio-ankle vascular index (-0.4 ± 0.2 vs 0.07 ± 0.1; P = 0.03) after 8 weeks of treatment. CONCLUSIONS: High-dose (1200 mg/day) soy lecithin not only increases vigor, but also lowers the diastolic blood pressure and cardio-ankle vascular index in middle-aged women who present with fatigue.

The results indicated that PTX-Lips were spherical in shape with a dynamic light scattering (DLS) particle size of 131 ± 30.5 nm. Besides, PTX was efficiently encapsulated in Lips, 94.5 ± 3.2% for drug loading efficiency, and slowly released up to 96 h, compared with free PTX. More importantly, cell proliferation kit I (MTT) assay data showed that Lips were biocompatible nanocarriers, and in addition the incorporation of PTX into Lips has been proven successful in reducing the toxicity of PTX. As a result, development of Lips using SL may offer a stable delivery system and promising properties for loading and sustained release of PTX in cancer therapy."

One-two months before the treatment beginning, blood samples were collected for total lipids and cholesterol fractions analysis. The results showed a reduction of 40.66% and 42.00% in total cholesterol and of 42.05% and 56.15% in LDL cholesterol after treatment for one and two months, respectively. A significant reduction in total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol concentrations was observed during the first month of treatment, suggesting that the administration of soy lecithin daily may be used as a supplemental treatment in hypercholesterolemia."

The efficacy of heat treatment with water and FLU mixtures was investigated on artificially inoculated pears for the control of post-harvest decay caused by blue (Penicillium expansum Link) and grey (Botrytis cinerea Pers. ex Fr.) mould. Treatment with 300 mg l(-1) FLU at 20 degrees C increased residues significantly when treatment time rose from 1 to 2 min; no further increase was recorded when dip time raised from 2 to 4 min.

Three peptides with amphiphilic surface-staying, membrane spanning, and both properties were designed and synthesized. The evaluation of pulmonary surfactant assay was performed by a hysteresis curve drawn upon the measurement for the surface tension-area curve with the Wilhelmy surface tensometer in vitro and the recovery of lung compliance for the pulmonary surfactant-deficient rat models in vivo. Lipid-mixture systems composed of octadecanol or soy lecithins containing no peptide were favorable hysteresis curves as compared with commercially available Surfacten, but were not prominent. The peptide-lipid mixture systems composed of a combination of the lipid mixture of alkyl alcohol or soy lecithin to which peptides designed were added were desirable hysteresis curves similar to Surfacten and amphiphilic Hel 13-5 peptide-lipids mixture systems were much more effective than the lipid mixture system. Particularly, the recovery of lung compliance treated with hydrogenated soy lecithin-fractionated soy lecithin PC70-palmitic acid-peptide Hel 13-5 (40:40:17.5:2.5, w/w) was comparable to that with Surfacten. Because the artificial pulmonary surfactant compositions of this study can be prepared at lower costs, they are useful for the treatment of respiratory distress syndrome and acute respiratory distress syndrome as well as for inflammatory pulmonary diseases, dyspnea caused by asthma, etc.",

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: The aim of the study was to determine the effect of a combination of medium chain triglycerides (caprylic, capric, caproic and lauric acids), linoleic acid (essential fatty acid), vitamins A and E and soy lecithin, through a morphometric study, on the wound healing kinetics of experimental cutaneous ulcers. METHODS: A total of 45 male Wistar rats were used, in which a skin flap of total thickness with an area of 4 cm2 was removed. The animals were divided randomly into 3 groups of 15 rats each, Control, Reference and Test groups, which were treated topically with 0.9% NaCl, a preparation of clostebol combined with neomycin sulfate and the test formulation, respectively. The wound areas were measured by digital planimetry at days zero, 3, 7 and 12 postoperative. Based on the wound area, we determined the degree of tissue repair and mean rate of repair at different time intervals. RESULTS: At day 3, an expansion of the wound area was observed in the Reference group and slight contraction in the Control and Test groups. On the subsequent days, the healing process, according to the degree of repair, proceeded in a linear manner, such that, at day 12, the healed area reached 77.95% of the initial ulcerated region in the Control group, 78.40% in the Reference group and 83.49% in the Test group, showing no significant differences. The overall mean rate of repair was equally similar at 12 days of treatment: 25.79 mm2/dia in the Control group, 25.42 mm2/dia in the Reference group and 27.38 mm2/dia in the Test group. CONCLUSION: The test preparation, applied topically on the experimentally induced cutaneous ulcers in rats, did not accelerate the process of tissue repair by secondary union.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To assess the effects of soy isoflavone protein concentrate and soy lecithin on endothelial function, measured as flow-mediated dilation (FMD) of the brachial artery in healthy postmenopausal women. DESIGN: This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover trial with 25 participants (mean age, 61 years; body mass index, 25.46 kg/m2). The women underwent endothelial function testing at baseline and after 4 weeks of randomly assigned treatment with intervening 4-week washout periods. Treatment assignments included soy isoflavone protein (25 g/day) and soy lecithin (20 g/day), soy isoflavone protein (25 g/day) and placebo lecithin, placebo protein and soy lecithin (20 g/day), and double placebo. FMD and serum lipid levels were assessed at baseline and the end of each 4-week treatment phase. RESULTS: Twenty-two women completed the trial. No statistically significant (P > 0.05) difference was seen in FMD between treatment groups. A trend was suggested with FMD highest after treatment with soy protein plus lecithin (7.50 +/- 9.85), followed by soy protein (5.51 +/- 10.11), soy lecithin (5.35 +/- 6.13), and lowest after placebo (4.53 +/- 7.84). Soy isoflavone protein and soy lecithin significantly increased the high-density lipoprotein/low-density lipoprotein ratio (soy isoflavone protein plus soy lecithin, 0.64 +/- 0.19, P < 0.0001; soy isoflavone protein plus placebo lecithin, 0.58 +/- 0.17, P = 0.0058; placebo protein plus soy lecithin, 0.65 +/- 0.18, P < 0.0001) relative to the baseline value (0.49 +/- 0.15). CONCLUSIONS: In this sample of healthy postmenopausal women, soy isoflavone protein and soy lecithin significantly improved the lipid profile. A favorable influence on endothelial function could not be confirmed.",

Further research investigated the influence of soy lecithin phosphatidylserine supplementation on mood and heart rate when faced with an acute stressor. In this study, we investigated the effects of soy lecithin phosphatidic acid and phosphatidylserine complex (PAS) supplementation on pituitary adrenal reactivity (ACTH, cortisol) and on the psychological response (Spielberger State Anxiety Inventory stress subscale) to a mental and emotional stressor. Four groups of 20 subjects were treated for three weeks with daily dosages of either 400 mg PAS, 600 mg PAS, 800 mg PAS, or placebo before exposure to the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST). Treatment with 400 mg PAS resulted in a pronounced blunting of both serum ACTH and cortisol, and salivary cortisol responses to the TSST, but did not affect heart rate. The effect was not seen with larger doses of PAS. With regard to the psychological response, 400 mg PAS seemed to exert a specific positive effect on emotional responses to the TSST. While the placebo group showed the expected increase in distress after the test, the group treated with 400 mg PAS showed decreased distress. These data provide initial evidence for a selective stress dampening effect of PAS on the pituitary-adrenal axis, suggesting the potential of PAS in the treatment of stress related disorders.",

      "abstract": "The current study was designed to investigate the hypocholesterolemic and anti-atherogenic properties of soy lecithin beyond its fatty acid content. In experiment 1, 18 cynomolgus monkeys were divided into three groups of six and fed diets which approximated either the average American diet (AAD), the American Heart Association (AHA) Step I diet, or a modified AHA (mAHA) Step I diet containing 3.4% soy lecithin for 8 weeks. Plasma samples were collected from food-deprived monkeys and analyzed for total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), very low- and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C), and triglyceride (TG) concentrations. Group comparisons revealed that monkeys fed the mAHA Step 1 diet had significantly lower plasma TC (-46%) and non-HDL-C (-55%) levels compared to the AAD diet, whereas monkeys fed the AHA Step 1 diet had lesser reductions in plasma TC (-21%) and non-HDL-C (-18%) levels. The monkeys fed the mAHA Step I diet had significantly lower plasma TC (-32%) and non-HDL-C (-45%) compared to the monkeys fed the AHA step diet. Also, only the mAHA Step I diet significantly reduced pre-treatment plasma TC and non-HDL-C levels by - 39 and -51% respectively with no significant effect on plasma HDL-C or TG levels. In experiment 2, 45 hamsters were divided into three groups of 15 and fed the following three modified non-purified diets for 8 weeks: a hypercholesterolemic diet (HCD) containing 10%, coconut oil and 0.05%, cholesterol, HCD plus 3.4%, soy lecithin (+SL), or the HCD with added levels of linoleate and choline equivalent to the +SL diet but no lecithin (-SL). Plasma lipids were determined as in experiment 1 and aortas were perfusion-fixed and Oil Red O stained for morphometric analyses of fatty streak area. Relative to the HCD group, the +SL-treated hamsters had significantly lower plasma TC (-58%), non-HDL-C (-73%) and aortic fatty streak area (-90%). Relative to the -SL group, hamsters fed the +SL diet had significantly lower plasma TC (-33%), non-HDL-C (-50%) and significantly reduced aortic fatty streak area (-79%). In conclusion, the first experiment suggests that the cholesterol-lowering efficacy of the AHA Step I diet can be enhanced with the addition of soy lecithin without reducing plasma HDL-C levels. whereas the second experiment suggest that the hypocholesterolemic, and in particular, the anti-atherogenic properties of soy lecithin cannot be attributed solely to its linoleate content.",

      "abstract": "Phospholipids (soy lecithin) are important in the emulsification of lipids and may be able to escape the rumen and influence the absorption of fatty acids in the small intestine. The objectives of this study were to determine the influence of dietary canola seed (high in unsaturated fatty acids) and soy lecithin in high-forage diets on performance, serum lipid metabolites, and carcass characteristics of growing ram lambs. Forty-three Hampshire- or Suffolk-sired ram lambs were weaned at 60 d of age (average 23.6 kg BW) and assigned to a 2 x 2 factorial arrangement of the following treatments (% of DM): 1) basal diet (control = BAS); 2) BAS with 6% whole canola seed (CS); 3) BAS with 4.9% deoiled soy lecithin (SL); and 4) BAS with 6% CS and 4.8% SL (CSSL). The BAS diet consisted of 70% forage and 30% concentrate and contained 15% CP and 2.2 Mcal of ME/kg. Lambs had ad libitum access to their diet to an average final BW of 52.1 kg. Lambs were bled by jugular venipuncture on d 0, at 4-wk intervals, and 1 d before slaughter. Dry matter intake was not affected by treatment; however, energy intake (Mcal of ME/d) was greater (P less than .01) for lambs fed SL. Feeding SL and(or) CS to growing ram lambs increased (P less than .02) serum lipid concentrations. Carcasses from lambs fed SL were fatter, as evidenced by greater dressing percentage and subcutaneous fat thickness. Feeding CS to growing lambs had little effect on performance and carcass characteristics compared with feeding SL, which resulted in greater energy intake and fatter carcasses.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Dry matter intake was reduced by infusion of soy lecithin as compared with infusion of water (18.1 and 21.1 kg/d, respectively). Plasma beta-hydroxybutyrate concentration was increased when cows received the myo-inositol or soy lecithin infusion, and plasma glucose was lower when cows received the choline or soy lecithin treatment. Infusion of soy lecithin caused approximately a twofold increase in plasma triglyceride-rich lipoprotein concentration. Milk fat percentage and milk fat yield were greater during soy lecithin infusion (3.54%, 1.11 kg/d) than during water (3.09%, .98 kg/d) or soy oil (3.06%, .98 kg/d) infusion. This resulted in greater 3.5% FCM yield during soy lecithin infusion (31.6 kg/d) than during water (29.5 kg/d) or soy oil (29.6 kg/d) infusion. Infusion of phospholipid with triglyceride allowed more fatty acid to be infused without causing diarrhea. Infusion of triglyceride in the presence of phospholipid increased milk fat synthesis whereas infusion of triglyceride alone did not.",
