      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Chronic telogen effluvium (TE) and androgenetic alopecia represent two prevalent forms of hair loss that can significantly impact individuals' quality of life. Insufficiency of essential micronutrients has been associated with hair loss. The objective of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of an oral supplement containing l-Cystine, Serenoa repens, Cucurbita pepo, Pygeum africanum, vitamins, and micronutrients in chronic TE (CTE) and androgenetic alopecia (AGA). METHODS: Eighty patients of both sexes aged 18-60 years with CTE or AGA were randomized to receive one capsule daily of the oral supplement or placebo for 6 months. Dermatological evaluations, clinical pictures and phototrichograms were done at baseline, 3 months and 6 months. The overall hair volume and appearance were assessed before and after treatment as well as subject's self-assessment via standardized questionnaire. RESULTS: Hair density increased by 9.9 hairs/cm2 after 3 months and 12.3 hairs/cm2 after 6 months in the oral supplement group and it is statistically significant when compared to placebo. Overall hair volume after 1, 3, and 6 months is better in the supplement group than in the placebo group. The oral supplement was well tolerated. No moderate or severe adverse events were reported. CONCLUSION: Oral supplementation can increase hair density, anagen hairs, and overall hair appearance in patients with AGA or CTE."

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Cross-sectional observationalstudy in which 115 patients with LUTS/BPHtreated for 6 months with P. africanum (Tebetane® compuesto)in real-world clinical practice conditions wereincluded. The primary objective was to assess thequality of life (QoL) according to changes in the scoresof item 8 of the International Prostate Symptom Score(IPSS) questionnaire (a score ≥ 4 indicates a significantimpairment of QoL). Secondary objectives includedimprovement of urinary symptoms, urinary flow, satisfactionand compliance with treatment as well astolerability. Data were collected in a single scheduledvisit at 6 months of treatment with P. africanum andwere compared with data registered in the medicalrecords at the beginning of treatment. RESULTS: After 6 months of treatment withP. africanum, the percentage of patient with significantimpairment of QoL was 22.6% as compared with45.2% at the initiation of treatment (P 0,-001). Theoverall IPSS score showed a mean decreas of -4,-5points (median -4,0, interquartile range [IQR] -7,-0 to-2,0) and 69 patients (60%) showed a clinically significantimprovement (reduction of ≥ 4 points). Therewere significant decreases in IPSS subscales of storage(mean -1,-8; median -2,-0, IQR -3,-0 to 0 (P 0,-001)and voiding (mean -1,-9; median -2,-0, IQR -3,-0 to 0)(P 0,-001) symptoms. The degree of satisfaction and compliance with treatment was high with mean scores(median) of 6,9 (7,0) and 9,2 (10), respectively in the1-10 visual analogue scale. Treatment-related adverseeffects did not occur. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with P. africanum during6 months improved significantly QoL and LUTS inpatients with BPH, with a high level of satisfaction andcompliance with treatment, without adverse events.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Extract of Pygeum africanum (PAE) is commonly used herbal medication in the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia. In Montenegro and neighboring countries, PAE is primarily advertised as dietary supplement in the treatment of erectile dysfunction. The purpose of this study was to broaden the current cognition concerning its safety profile. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Twenty-four adult male Wistar rats were used. The first control group (O) received water and second control group (OO) received olive oil for 30 days. The third and fourth groups (PA5 and PA10) were treated with PAE dissolved in olive oil (50 and 100mg/kg p.o. daily). The behavior of animals was observed continuously, bodyweight gain (BWG) was calculated weekly and the weight of selected organs was measured at the end of experiment. Total protein and glutathione content of the liver were analyzed. Standard biochemical analyses were also performed. RESULTS: BWG was higher in PA5 compared to both controls at all measuring intervals. Liver weight/body weight ratio was significantly higher in PA10 in comparison with O. Prostate weight/body weight ratio was lower in both PA5 and PA10 compared to OO, achieving statistical significance in PA5. The value of creatinine was higher in PA5 and PA10 compared to both control groups, but achieving statistical significance in PA10 only. LDH was also increased in PA5 and PA10 compared to both controls. CONCLUSIONS: Both dosage regimens of PAE, particularly PA10, caused some toxicological effects in Wistar rats after one month of application. Kidney, skeletal muscle and/or myocardium are suspected as target sites of PA toxicity most likely. In order to provide more reliable conclusion it is necessary to conduct an additional research on the basis of these findings.",

We used primary and organotypic cultures of human prostatic stromal myofibroblast cell line WPMY and prostatic epithelial cell line PNT2. We also used fresh benign prostatic tissue. The serum of a treated man induced decreases in the proliferation of primary cells, organotypic cells and WPMY cells but not PNT2 cells. We also analysed the effect of treated serum on the gene expression profile of WPMY cells. The transcriptome analysis revealed an upregulation of genes involved in multiple tumour suppression pathways and a downregulation of genes involved in inflammation and oxidative-stress pathways. The oral intake of Pygeum africanum resulted in serum levels of active substances that were sufficient to inhibit the proliferation of cultured myofibroblasts prostatic cells. This inhibition was associated with changes in the transcriptome.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Previous reports show that the herbal agent Pygeum africanum (PA) used to treat benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) inhibits proliferation of prostate stromal cells from BPH tissues. To determine underlying mechanisms, we compared proliferative and apoptotic responses to PA between BPH and non-BPH prostate stromal cells with a focus on the specific reaction displayed by stromal cell subsets. An interaction of PA with growth factors and hormones was also investigated. METHODS: Primary prostate stromal cells from BPH/LUTS patients undergoing open prostatectomy (n = 3) and patients without benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) undergoing cystectomy (n = 3) were treated with PA. Cells were characterized by immunofluorescence. Sensitivity to PA was determined using proliferation assays. Apoptosis, transforming growth factor B1 (TGFB1), fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2), vimentin, alpha smooth muscle actin (alphaSMA), and smoothelin expression were examined after PA treatment. Cell immunophenotype and proliferation were tested after incubating cells with PA plus either FGF2, TGFB1, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), dihydrotestosterone (DHT) or 17beta-estradiol (E2). RESULTS: Antiproliferative potency and apoptosis induced by PA on stromal cells were increased in BPH versus non-BPH cells. Apoptosis targeted alphaSMA+ cells, more abundant in BPH cells. Downregulation of TGFB1 expression was induced by PA. FGF2 increased cells sensitivity to PA. Incubation with other mitogenic factors like VEGF, DHT, and E2 decreased sensitivity to PA. Both TGFB1 and E2 blocked the antiproliferative activity of PA. CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that PA is antiproliferative and apoptotic on proliferative prostate fibroblasts and myofibroblasts but not on smooth muscle cells. Mechanisms of action include TGFB1 downregulation and inhibition of FGF2 specific signaling.",

The ligand-activated human androgen receptor (AR) is known to control the growth of the prostate gland. Inhibition of human AR is therefore a major goal in treatment of patients. Here, we characterize the compound N-butylbenzene-sulfonamide (NBBS) isolated from P. africanum as a specific AR antagonist. This antihormonal activity inhibits AR- and progesterone receptor- (PR) mediated transactivation, but not the related human glucocorticoid receptor (GR) or the estrogen receptors (ERα or ERβ). Importantly, NBBS inhibits both endogenous PSA expression and growth of human PCa cells. Mechanistically, NBBS binds to AR and inhibits its translocation to the cell nucleus. Furthermore, using a battery of chemically synthesized derivatives of NBBS we revealed important structural aspects for androgen antagonism and have identified more potent AR antagonistic compounds. Our data suggest that NBBS is one of the active compounds of P. africanum bark and may serve as a naturally occurring, novel therapeutic agent for treatment of prostatic diseases. Thus, NBBS and its derivatives may serve as novel chemical platform for treatment prostatitis, BPH and PCa.",

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-two adult Wistar male rats were treated daily for 8 weeks and grouped as follows: Control group (n = 6), Streptozotocin-induced diabetic group (n = 10), diabetes plus P. africanum group (n = 10), and control plus P. africanum group (n = 6). After diabetes induction for 4 weeks, the diabetes plus P. africanum and control plus P. africanum groups were fed with P. africanum (100 mg/kg, orally) in peanut oil for another 4 weeks. The catalase, superoxide dismutase activity, and malondialdehyde levels were measured as a marker of lipid peroxidation. The levels of inducible nitric oxide synthase were also evaluated. Urodynamic studies were performed to evaluate the functional changes of diabetic bladders after P. africanum treatment. RESULTS: The catalase and superoxide dismutase activities significantly increased (P < 0.05) and maleic dialdehyde levels significantly decreased from diabetic plus P. africanum group compared with diabetic group (P < 0.05). Immunohistochemical studies showed a significantly decreased number of inducible nitric oxide synthase-positive cells in diabetic plus P. africanum group compared with diabetic group (P < 0.05). In diabetic plus P. africanum group, maximal bladder volume significantly decreased, while bladder pressure and maximal bladder pressure significantly increased compared with diabetic group (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Early treatment with P. africanum could effectively suppress the oxidative stress status in diabetic bladder and may slow down the process of diabetic cystopathy.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Prostate cancer is an important public health problem. It is an excellent candidate disease for chemoprevention because prostate cancer is typically slow growing and is usually diagnosed in elderly males. Pygeum africanum (Prunus africana or Rosaceae) is an African prune (plum) tree found in tropical Africa. An extract from the bark of Pygeum africanum has been used in Europe as a prevention and treatment of prostate disorders including benign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH). More recently in the USA, the phytotherapeutic preparations of Pygeum africanum and Saw palmetto have been marketed for prostate health including prostate cancer prevention and treatment. METHODS: The anti-cancer potential of Pygeum africanum has been tested both in vitro (PC-3 and LNCaP cells) and in vivo (TRAMP mouse model). RESULTS: In tissue culture, ethanolic extracts (30%) of Pygeum africanum inhibited the growth of PC-3 and LNCaP cells; induced apoptosis and altered cell kinetics; down regulated ERalpha and PKC-alpha protein, and demonstrated good binding ability to both mouse uterine estrogen receptors and LNCaP human androgen receptors. TRAMP mice fed Pygeum africanum showed a significant reduction (P = 0.034) in prostate cancer incidence (35%) compared to casein fed mice (62.5%). CONCLUSION: Pygeum africanum, which is widely used in Europe and USA for treatment of BPH, has a significant role in regulation of prostate cancer both in vitro and in vivo and therefore may be a useful supplement for people at high risk for developing prostate cancer.",

This has spurred an interest in so-called alternative medicines, many of which continue to be used in spite of the more recent emergence of rationally targeted therapies. Nonetheless, in the case of plant extracts, the vast majority of these have not been subjected to the same rigorous pre-clinical pharmacological testing and large-scale clinical trials now required by health authorities. Furthermore, demonstration of their clinical efficacy in BPH has been hindered by trials of limited duration with a high placebo response. Beginning with a preliminary demonstration of in vitro inhibition of growth factor-mediated fibroblast proliferation with Pygeum africanum extract, a detailed series of in vitro and in vivo studies on prostate growth and bladder function were undertaken. These studies, reviewed herein, have permitted the identification of putative molecular targets of Pygeum africanum extract affecting both growth factor-mediated prostate growth as well as specific parameters of bladder function. These results, corroborated in part by short-term clinical efficacy, set the stage for a large-scale clinical trial to investigate the efficacy of Pygeum africanum extract in the treatment of lower urinary tract symptoms.",

In that sense, we have analyzed the results of a combination of Pygeum africanum and stinging nettle (Urtica dioica) extracts in patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), based in a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled protocol. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We have selected, according to inclusion and exclusion criteria, only patients with >or=50 years, presenting urinary symptoms assessed by the International Prostatic Symptoms Score (IPSS), with minimum score of 12, and Quality of Life (QoL) index of at least 3 points, rectal examination consistent with BPH, and maximum urinary flow rate (Q(max)) between 5 and 15 mL/s. Phytotherapic and placebo groups were formed by 27 and 22 patients, respectively. The major variables analyzed during the study were IPSS variation, Q(max), and side effects. Reduction of >or=30% and >or=50% in IPSS were the parameters used to define a clinically significant response (CSR). We have also analyzed >or=30% and >or=50% Q(max) increases. RESULTS: After six months of treatment we did not observe significant differences in clinical improvement potential between the phytotherapic combination and placebo groups. Percent IPSS drop of 21.6% in the phytotherapic group was similar to 19.7% obtained in the placebo group (p=0.928). Neither we observed any difference (p=0.530) for QoL improvement between phytotherapic (9.26%) and placebo (5.98%) groups. The alterations of Q(max) followed the trend line observed in clinical data, with no significant difference (p=0.463) in Q(max) increasing percent between phytotherapic (17.2%) and placebo (13.3%) groups. The CSR evaluation of clinical and urodynamic data was also similar between the groups. CONCLUSION: The combination of 25mg Pygeum africanum and 300mg stinging nettle extracts produced clinical and urodynamic effects similar to placebo in a group of HBP patients."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Pretreatment with oral tadenan (TAD) has been shown to possess a protective effect on bladder dysfunction-induced obstruction. We evaluated the functional influence of cotreatment and post-treatment with oral TAD on the frequency/volume characteristics of micturition of conscious rats stimulated with exogenous dihydrotestosterone (DHT) to induce experimental prostate growth. METHODS: Studies were done on 36 adult Sprague-Dawley male rats, treated daily for 6 weeks and grouped as follows: group 1, sesame oil during weeks 1 and 2, peanut oil during weeks 3 to 6; group 2, DHT (1.25 mg/kg subcutaneously) dissolved in sesame oil as vehicle during weeks 1 and 2 and peanut oil during weeks 3 to 6; group 3, DHT (1.25 mg/kg subcutaneously) dissolved in sesame oil as vehicle and TAD (100 mg/kg orally) in peanut oil during weeks 1 and 2 and TAD during weeks 3 to 6; and group 4, DHT in sesame oil during weeks 1 and 2 and TAD in peanut oil during weeks 3 to 6. The characteristics of frequency/volume were monitored biweekly and at the sixth week. RESULTS: Controls showed no significant changes from baseline values in volume or frequency during the entire study period. DHT treatment produced a significant increase in frequency (1.9 +/- 0.3 to 3.0 +/- 0.4/hr) and a significant decrease in volume (1.8 +/- 0.3 to 1.2 +/- 0.1 mL). In groups 3 and 4, no significant changes occurred in frequency or volume. By the sixth week of observation, the effects of DHT treatment decreased to control values in all groups. A significant increase in prostatic weight (1191 +/- 11 to 1434 +/- 17 mg/kg) was produced by DHT treatment and TAD cotreatment suppressed growth to 1390 +/- 8.4 mg/kg. CONCLUSIONS: TAD cotreatment or post-treatment suppressed the effects of DHT on micturition, and TAD cotreatment regressed a developing increase in prostatic weight. Post-treatment TAD administration did not reduce already established growth.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), nonmalignant enlargement of the prostate, can lead to obstructive and irritative lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS). The pharmacologic use of plants and herbs (phytotherapy) for the treatment of LUTS associated with BPH has been growing steadily. The extract of the African prune tree, Pygeum africanum, is one of the several phytotherapeutic agents available for the treatment of BPH. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the evidence whether extracts of Pygeum africanum (1) are more effective than placebo in the treatment of Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH), (2) are as effective as standard pharmacologic BPH treatments, and (3) have less side effects compared to standard BPH drugs. SEARCH STRATEGY: Trials were searched in computerized general and specialized databases (MEDLINE (1966-2000), EMBASE, Cochrane Library, Phytodok), by checking bibliographies, and by contacting relevant manufacturers and researchers. SELECTION CRITERIA: Trials were eligible if they (1) were randomized (2) included men with BPH (3) compared preparations of Pygeum africanum (alone or in combination) with placebo or other BPH medications (4) included clinical outcomes such as urologic symptom scales, symptoms, or urodynamic measurements. Eligibility was assessed by at least two independent observers. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Information on patients, interventions, and outcomes were extracted by at least two independent reviewers using a standard form. The main outcome measure for comparing the effectiveness of Pygeum africanum with placebo and standard BPH medications was the change in urologic symptoms scale scores. Secondary outcomes included change in urologic symptoms including nocturia and urodynamic measures (peak and mean urine flow, prostate size). The main outcome measure for adverse effects was the number of men reporting adverse effects. MAIN RESULTS: A total of 18 randomized controlled trials involving 1562 men met inclusion criteria and were analyzed. Only one of the studies reported a method of treatment allocation concealment, though 17 were double-blinded. There were no studies comparing Pygeum africanum to standard pharmacologic interventions such as alpha-adrenergic blockers or 5-alpha reductase inhibitors. The mean study duration was 64 days (range, 30-122 days). Many studies did not report results in a method that permitted meta-analysis. Compared to men receiving placebo, Pygeum africanum provided a moderately large improvement in the combined outcome of urologic symptoms and flow measures as assessed by an effect size defined by the difference of the mean change for each outcome divided by the pooled standard deviation for each outcome (-0.8 SD [95% confidence interval (CI), -1.4, -0.3 (n=6 studies)]). Men using Pygeum africanum were more than twice as likely to report an improvement in overall symptoms (RR=2.1, 95% CI = 1.4, 3.1). Nocturia was reduced by 19%, residual urine volume by 24% and peak urine flow was increased by 23%. Adverse effects due to Pygeum Africanum were mild and comparable to placebo. The overall dropout rate was 12% and was similar between Pygeum Africanum (13%), placebo (11%) and other controls (8%). REVIEWER'S CONCLUSIONS: A standardized preparation of Pygeum africanum may be a useful treatment option for men with lower urinary symptoms consistent with benign prostatic hyperplasia. However, the reviewed studies were small in size, were of short duration, used varied doses and preparations and rarely reported outcomes using standardized validated measures of efficacy. Additional placebo-controlled trials are needed as well as studies that compare Pygeum africanum to active controls that have been convincingly demonstrated to have beneficial effects on lower urinary tract symptoms related to BPH. These trials should be of sufficient size and duration to detect important differences in clinically relevant endpoints and use standardized urologic symptom scale scores.",

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: To conduct a systematic review and quantitative meta-analysis of the therapeutic efficacy and tolerability of Pygeum africanum in men with symptomatic benign prostatic hyperplasia. METHODS: Studies were identified through the search of Medline (1966 to 2000), Embase, Phytodok, the Cochrane Library, bibliographies of identified trials and review articles, and contact with relevant authors and drug companies. Randomized trials were included if participants had symptomatic benign prostatic hyperplasia, the intervention was a preparation of P. africanum alone or in combination with other phytotherapeutic agents, a control group received placebo or other pharmacologic therapies for benign prostatic hyperplasia, and treatment duration was at least 30 days. Two investigators independently extracted key data on design features, subject characteristics, and therapy allocation. RESULTS: A total of 18 randomized controlled trials involving 1,562 men met the inclusion criteria and were analyzed. Many studies did not report results in a method that permitted meta-analysis. Only 1 of the studies reported a method of treatment allocation concealment, although 17 were double-blinded. The mean study duration was 64 days (range 30 to 122). Compared with placebo in 6 studies, P. africanum provided a moderately large improvement in the combined outcome of urologic symptoms and flow measures as assessed by an effect size defined by the difference of the mean change for each outcome divided by the pooled standard deviation for each outcome (-0.8 SD [95% confidence interval (CI): -1.4 to -0.3]). Summary estimates of individual outcomes were also improved by P. africanum. Men were more than twice as likely to report an improvement in overall symptoms (risk ratio = 2.1, 95% CI: 1.40 to 3.1). Nocturia was reduced by 19% and residual urine volume by 24%; peak urine flow was increased by 23%. Adverse effects due to P. africanum were mild and similar to placebo. The overall dropout rate was 12% and was similar for P. africanum (13%), placebo (11%), and other controls (8%; P = 0.4 versus placebo and P = 0.5 versus other controls). CONCLUSIONS: The literature on P. africanum for the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia is limited by the short duration of studies and the variability in study design, the use of phytotherapeutic preparations, and the types of reported outcomes. However, the evidence suggests that P. africanum modestly, but significantly, improves urologic symptoms and flow measures. Further research is needed using standardized preparations of P. africanum to determine its long-term effectiveness and ability to prevent complications associated with benign prostatic hyperplasia.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Tadenan (a Pygeum africanum extract) is a drug used in the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia. Its effects on prostate fibroblast proliferation and bladder function after partial outlet obstruction have been demonstrated in various pharmacological studies. However, its effects at the molecular level are poorly documented. METHODS: Tadenan was dissolved in peanut oil. Rats were orally given two daily doses of the drug (1 or 10 mg/kg b.w.) for 4 days. Vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) binding, adenylyl cyclase stimulation, and expression of G-protein subunits were studied in rat prostatic membranes by established procedures. RESULTS: Tadenan treatment of castrated/testosterone-replaced rats was performed in order to interfere with prostatic cell proliferation. This experimental approach resulted in increases of: 1) VIP effect on adenylyl cyclase stimulation through alpha(s) G-subunit; 2) alpha(i) activation by low Gpp[NH]p doses (in the presence of forskolin); and 3) alpha(s), alpha(i1/2), and alpha(i3/0) levels. However, there were no modifications in membranes from quiescent, nonproliferating prostates (untreated rats). CONCLUSIONS: The observed regulatory role of Tadenan on various prostatic components of the adenylyl cyclase system, together with previous findings on protein kinase C-mediated signal transduction, open a complex array of possibilities of direct actions of this phytotherapeutic agent in the prostate.",

      "abstract": "In Europe, phytotherapeutic preparations have been prescribed for the treatment of symptomatic benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) for over 20 years [1-4]. In these countries, phytotherapeutic preparations represent approximately 1/3 of total sales of all therapeutic agents sold for the treatment of BPH. In France, and other countries, phytotherapeutic preparations are the most widely used drugs for the treatment of BPH. In Asia, Africa, and India, phytotherapy is considered a first-line treatment for BPH and has been utilized effectively for centuries. In the United States, the multimillion dollar sales of phytotherapeutic preparations for \"the health of the prostate and bladder\" attests to the widespread utilization of these agents [3, 4]. Two of the most popular phytotherapeutic agents that have undergone both clinical studies to determine their efficacy, and have been the subject of basic science studies to identify the mechanism(s) of action are Pygeum africanum (Tadenan), an extract from the bark of the African plum tree, and Serenoa repens (Permixon), a lipido-sterol extract of dwarf palm. Tadenan and Permixon are registered therapeutic agents of Debat Pharmaceuticals, and Pierre Fabre Medicament, respectively. Manufacture of both preparations are tightly controlled and subjected to strict quality control for stability of component composition. In regard to phytotherapeutic agents, each individual preparation (even from the same plant source) must be considered individually because of differences in the extraction techniques, preparation of products, composition, and biological activities. Thus, the clinical and biological activities of one preparation cannot be extrapolated to other preparations of the same plant source. Thus, studies described in this review which utilize the preparations that are manufactured by DEBAT (Pygeum africanum) or Pierre Fabre Medicament (Serenoa repens) are referred to by their trade names, Tadenan and Permixon, to differentiate them from other nonstandardized preparations of the same plants.",

Its efficacy and acceptability have been demonstrated in numerous open and placebo-controlled studies in large populations. The present open three-centre efficacy and safety study was conducted according to common protocol at urology clinics in the Czech and Slovak Republics and in Poland, in order to confirm the therapeutic profile of Pygeum africanum in conditions of daily practice, using International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) and flowmetry assessments. Men aged 50-75 years and in compliance with the selection criteria (including IPSS > or = 12, quality of life (QoL) score > or = 3, and maximum urinary flow < or = 15 ml/s) were first examined then recalled after two weeks during which no treatment was provided (washout and check of stability). If still compliant, they were entered at this point into a two-month period of treatment with Pygeum africanum extract 50 mg twice daily. There followed a further one-month period without treatment, the objective being to evaluate the persistence of any effects observed during the previous two months of Pygeum africanum administration. The primary efficacy parameter investigated was IPSS; the other efficacy parameters were QoL, nocturnal frequency, maximum urinary flow, average urinary flow, post-voiding residual volume and prostatic volume, after one and two months of Pygeum africanum treatment and one month after stopping treatment. A total of 85 patients were evenly distributed between the three centres and completed the entire study. At inclusion their mean IPSS was 16.17, QoL was 3.60 and nocturia was 2.6 times per night. The changes in subjective scores, IPSS and QoL after the two-month treatment period were highly statistically significant with mean improvements of 40% and 31%, respectively. Nocturnal frequency was reduced by 32% and the mean reduction was again highly statistically significant. Mean maximum urinary flow, average urinary flow and urine volume were also statistically significantly improved, but the modest improvement in post-voiding volume did not reach statistical significance. The improvements, which exceeded those observed with placebo in earlier studies, were maintained after one month without treatment indicating an interesting persistence of clinically useful activity. Prostatic volume and quality of sexual life remained unchanged throughout. No treatment-related adverse effects were observed. In conclusion, under conditions of daily practice, Pygeum africanum extract induces significant improvement in IPSS and uroflowmetry parameters. These positive effects are accompanied by a very satisfactory safety profile with the overall result of a substantial improvement in QoL.",

      "abstract": "The effect of a Pygeum africanum extract (Tadenan) (Pa), used in the treatment of micturition disorders associated with BPH, has been examined on the proliferation of rat prostatic stromal cells stimulated by different growth factors. EGF, bFGF, and IGF-I but not KGF are mitogenic for prostatic fibroblasts in culture. Pygeum africanum inhibits both basal and stimulated growth with IC50 values of 4.5, 7.7 and 12.6 micrograms./ml. for EGF, IGF-I and bFGF, respectively, compared to 14.4 micrograms./ml. for untreated cells, the inhibition being stronger towards EGF. Pygeum africanum inhibited the proliferation induced by TPA or PDBu in a concentration-dependent manner with IC50 values of 12.4 and 8.1 micrograms./ml. respectively. The antiproliferative effects of Pa were not ascribed to cytotoxicity. These results show that Pygeum africanum is a potent inhibitor of rat prostatic fibroblast proliferation in response to direct activators of protein kinase C, the defined growth factors bFGF, EGF and IGF-I, and the complex mixture of mitogens in serum depending on the concentration used. PKC activation appears to be an important growth factor-mediated signal transduction for this agent. These data suggest that therapeutic effect of Pygeum africanum may be due at least in part to the inhibition of growth factors responsible for the prostatic overgrowth in man.",

The patients were randomly assigned to receive two capsules of the standard dose of an urtica/pygeum preparation (300 mg of Urtica dioica root extract combined with 25 mg of Pygeum africanum bark extract) or two capsules containing half the standard dose twice daily for 8 weeks. After 28 days' treatment, urine flow, residual urine, and nycturia were significantly reduced in both treatment groups. After 56 days' treatment, further significant decreases were found in residual urine (half-dose group) and in nycturia (both groups). There were no between-group differences in these measures of efficacy. Five patients reported adverse effects of treatment; treatment was not discontinued in any patient because of side effects. It is concluded that half doses of the urtica/pygeum extract are as safe and effective as the recommended full doses.",

      "abstract": "This clinical study has been designed to evaluate the efficacy of an extract of Pygeum Africanum (Tadenan) (Roussel-Pharma) in patients suffering from prostatic hypertrophy or chronic prostatitis. The drug has been administrated to 18 patients, for 60 days, as double of standard dosage (200 mg/die per os, instead of 100 mg/die). Because of the high frequency of association of sexual disorders with those two pathologies, we have extended the study also to sexual disorders selecting patients suffering from prostatic hypertrophy or chronic prostatitis and, simultaneously, from sexual disturbances. No side effects have been observed during the treatment. The urinary disturbances have been evaluated by anamnesis and prostatic transrectal echography; sexual disorders have been evaluated by anamnesis and nocturnal penile tumescence and rigidity (NPTR) monitoring. Furthermore, dosage of serum levels of the hormones LH, FSH, Prolactin, 17 beta-Estradiol and Testosterone has been performed before and after therapy. Pygeum Africanum extract administration improved all the urinary parameters we investigated; prostatic echography relieved reduction of peri-urethral edema. Also an improvement of sexual behaviour has been obtained; but we have not found significant differences between serum hormonal levels before and after therapy, as well as for NPTR.",

Capsules containing 50 mg of Pygeum africanum extract or placebo were administered at a dosage of 1 capsule in the morning and 1 capsule in the evening over a period of 60 days. 263 patients were included in this study, which was carried out in 8 centres in Germany, France, and Austria. Evaluation was mainly based on quantitative parameters such as residual urine, uroflowmetry and the precise monitoring of diurnal and nocturnal pollakiuria. Treatment with the Pygeum africanum extract led to a marked clinical improvement: a comparison of the quantitative parameters showed a significant difference between the Pygeum africanum group and the placebo group with respect to therapeutic response. The characteristic subjective symptoms of micturitional disorders, which were evaluated by the patients in a qualitative manner, were also significantly improved by administration of Pygeum africanum extract. Overall assessment at the end of therapy, showed that micturition improved in 66% of the patients treated with Pygeum africanum extract, as compared with an improvement of 31% in the placebo group. The difference was significant at the statistical level of p less than 0.001. During therapy with Pygeum africanum extract, gastrointestinal side effects occurred in 5 patients. Treatment was discontinued in three of those cases.",
