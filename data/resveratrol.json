      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common endocrine disorder that affects 9-18 % of women, often associated with metabolic and renal complications. This study aimed to investigate the renoprotective effects of resveratrol (RSV) in a letrozole-induced rat model of PCOS, focusing on biochemical, histological, ultrastructural, and immunohistochemical alterations. METHODS: Thirty female rats were randomly divided into five groups: negative control, only RSV-treated, PCOS-induced (sham), metformin-treated, and RSV-treated. Serum testosterone, urea, and creatinine levels were assessed. Renal tissues underwent histological, immunohistochemical, ultrastructural, and morphometric analyses. Additionally, TGF-β1 mRNA expression was evaluated using qRT-PCR. RESULTS: Letrozole administration significantly elevated serum testosterone, urea, and creatinine levels, indicating PCOS-associated renal dysfunction. Histological and ultrastructural analysis revealed severe glomerular and tubular alterations in the sham group. The administration of RSV significantly restored renal architecture and function more effectively than metformin. Immunohistochemistry analysis showed that RSV reduced Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen (PCNA) overexpression and restored B-cell Lymphoma 2 (BCL-2) expression, suggesting a protective effect against cellular stress and apoptosis. Moreover, RSV significantly downregulated TGF-β1 expression, indicating its anti-fibrotic and anti-inflammatory role in PCOS-related renal damage. CONCLUSION: In a PCOS rat model, RSV protects effectively against letrozole-induced structural and functional renal damage. It demonstrates superior efficacy over metformin in restoring renal function, reducing apoptosis, and mitigating fibrosis. These findings suggest that RSV may serve as a potential adjunct therapy for preventing PCOS-associated renal complications, emphasizing the need for further investigations."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury (CIRI) exacerbates neuronal damage through mechanisms including apoptosis and autophagy dysregulation. Resveratrol (Res), a natural polyphenol with neuroprotective properties, may alleviate CIRI-induced damage by modulating key signaling pathways. This study investigates the therapeutic effects of Res on CIRI, focusing on its role in balancing apoptosis and autophagy via regulation of nuclear receptor subfamily 3 group C member 2 (NR3C2) and tripartite motif containing 28 (TRIM28). METHOD: In vivo, cognitive impairment, neurological dysfunction, cerebral infarction, neuronal damage, and inflammatory response were assessed in Sprague Dawley (SD) rats subjected to middle cerebral artery occlusion/reperfusion (MCAO/R) using the morris water maze, Longa and Bederson scores, 2,3,5-tripheny ltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining, hematoxylin and eosin staining, Nissl staining, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The expression of NR3C2 and TRIM28 were analyzed by real time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and western blot (WB). In vitro, Res effects on oxygen-glucose deprivation/reperfusion (OGD/R)-treated PC12 cells were evaluated using cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8), ELISA, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining, and WB. The relationship between NR3C2 and TRIM28 was validated using dual luciferase and chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (ChIP-qPCR). RESULT: Res treatment significantly improved cognitive performance in the morris water maze test, and the infarct area was reduced by 16.736%. It was accompanied by downregulation of NR3C2 and TRIM28 expression. In vitro, Res enhanced cell viability, reduced inflammatory responses and apoptosis (with a 17.70% decrease in cell apoptosis rate), and restored autophagy balance. Mechanistically, NR3C2 was shown to directly regulate TRIM28 transcription, mediating the observed neuroprotective effects. CONCLUSION: Res inhibits NR3C2 expression, which in turn directly regulates the transcription of TRIM28 through NR3C2, alleviating apoptosis and autophagy dysregulation induced by CIRI. This mechanism clearly demonstrates the important role of NR3C2 in CIRI and reveals its regulatory relationship with TRIM28. By uncovering the neuroprotective effects of Res, we provide new insights for the treatment of CIRI and lay the foundation for future targeted therapeutic strategies involving NR3C2 and TRIM28.",

      "abstract": "UNLABELLED: Studies show that the clinical symptoms of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are significantly reduced by treatment with medicinal plants, including plants with strong anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. The use of herbal medicines and supplements is considered to be suitable due to relatively mild side effects. Resveratrol is one of the most potent plant compounds found in both medicinal and non-medicinal plants, and it has strong anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. Therefore, the aim of the double-blind clinical study was to investigate the effects of resveratrol consumption on biochemical markers, hematological parameters, and some inflammatory cytokines in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: A total of 44 patients with COVID-19 were randomly assigned to receive 750 mg/day of resveratrol (n = 24) orally or placebo (n = 20) for 10 days. A permuted block randomized design (block size two) was used for randomization. The biochemical markers, hematological parameters, and plasma levels of Interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β), Interleukin-6 (IL-6), Interleukin-10 (IL-10), and Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) cytokines were measured at baseline and after 10 days. RESULTS: We observed a statistically significant reduction in the C-reactive protein (CRP) (P = 0.041), Fasting blood sugar (FBS) (P = 0.002), Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) (P = 0.034), IL-1β (P = 0.011), TNF-α (P = 0.001), and White blood cell (WBC) (P = 0.043), Platelet count (PLT) (P = 0.042), Neutrophils (NUT) (P = 0.015) and an increase in Lymphocyte (LYM) (P = 0.010) in the resveratrol treated group when compared with the placebo group. CONCLUSION: The present study demonstrated that resveratrol as an herbal supplement may be useful in reducing markers of inflammation, neutrophils, and low platelet count, as well as lowering blood glucose levels in patients with COVID-19. The trial was prospectively registered at IRCT.ir as IRCT20111119008129N13. Registration date: 2022-10-11."

      "abstract": "Resveratrol (RSV) is a natural ingredient used in the treatment of diabetes mellitus. However, the antidiabetic mechanism of RSV is not clear. In the present study the antidiabetic mechanism of RSV was investigated using mice with high-fat diet (HFD)-induced insulin resistance (IR). C57BL/6J mice were divided into the following three groups: Control (CON), HFD, and HFD + RSV (RSV, 100 mg/kg body weight/day). Mice were administered RSV for 6 weeks; then biochemical and histological parameters, as well as gene and protein expression were detected. Compared with the CON group, the circulating levels of blood glucose, insulin, triglycerides, total cholesterol and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and area under the glucose curve were increased (P<0.05), the quantitative insulin sensitivity check index was decreased (P<0.05), and lipid accumulation in skeletal muscle was increased in the HFD group. RSV treatment was able to reverse this process and promote the IRS-1/PI3K/AKT/GLUT4 signaling pathway. Moreover, DNA damage-inducible transcript 4 (DDIT4) expression was upregulated, while the expression levels of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and p70 ribosomal protein S6 kinase were downregulated in the HFD + RSV group compared with the HFD group (P<0.05). Cell experiments inhibiting DDIT4 or activating mTOR also confirmed the role of these pathways. In summary, RSV ameliorated IR and glucose as well as lipid metabolism, and promoted the IRS-1/PI3K/AKT/GLUT4 signaling pathway through the DDIT4/mTOR signaling pathway in mice with HFD-induced IR."

      "abstract": "The regulation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) protein by cancer cells can lead to uncontrol of cancer cell growth and cancer therapy resistance. The drug discovery of the anticancer agent 5-(3-hydroxy-4-methoxyphenethyl)-2-methoxy-3-methylphenol (SM-3), a derivative of resveratrol by substituting a methyl group at the hydroxy group of ring A and adding a methoxy group at the para position of ring B, shows promising potential for targeting autophagy to induce cell death and suppress cancer stem cells (CSCs) through the inhibition of the mTOR protein. In human lung cancer cells, SM-3 showed greater efficacy, with lower IC50 values of 72.74 ± 0.13, 67.66 ± 0.10, and 43.24 ± 0.11 µM in A549, H292, and H460 cells, respectively, compared to the parent compound, Resveratrol (Res). Moreover, the selectivity index (SI) values for BEAS2B cells compared to tumor cells treated with SM-3 were 10.99, 11.81, and 18.49 for A549, H292, and H460 cell lines, respectively. Therefore, SM-3 treatment led to reduced proliferation rates and colony formation in lung cancer cells. In our study, spheroids treated with SM-3 showed a higher proportion of dead spheroids compared to those treated with Res. Additionally, SM-3 treatment resulted in decreased expression of stem cell markers (CD133, CD44, and ALDH1A1) and transcription factors (OCT4, NANOG, and SOX2) in spheroids and organoids from human lung cancer cells by inhibiting the mTOR/pAkt pathway. SM-3 was also found to induce autophagic cell death, as indicated by Monodansylcadaverine staining, acidic vesicle formation, and the conversion of LC3BI to LC3BII. Using MM/GBSA calculations, SM-3 exhibited a stronger binding affinity (-25.09 kcal/mol) compared to Res (-18.85 kcal/mol). SM-3 also displayed greater stability during the entire simulation, maintaining lower RMSD values of 2-3 Å even after 80 ns. In summary, the introduction of methyl and methoxy functional groups on Res to create SM-3 effectively suppressed cancer spheroids and organoids formation in lung cancer cells by targeting the upstream mTOR/pAkt pathway.",

      "abstract": "Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is challenging modern antimicrobial therapy due to its high antimicrobial resistance. Nutraceuticals have gained a lot of interest and their incorporation into nanoparticles further improves their efficacy. This study aimed to evaluate the antibacterial activity of linalool-based lipid nanocapsules loaded with resveratrol (LIN-LNC-RES) as a synergistic strategy against MRSA. LIN-LNC-RES were prepared by the phase inversion temperature method and characterized for their colloidal properties, in vitro release, and stability. The antibacterial and antibiofilm activity against S. aureus and different MRSA clinical isolates were investigated. Furthermore, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) imaging for visualization of biofilm formation and bacterial membrane integrity as well as mechanistic investigation using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analysis were performed. LIN-LNCs-RES demonstrated favorable properties with a size of 35.19 ± 0.72 nm, PDI of 0.09 ± 0.02 and a zeta potential of -2.53 ± 0.07 mV with RES 98% EE. They showed a controlled release of RES over 24 h and were stable at 4 °C for 3 months. Compared to free drug, LIN-LNC-RES showed a 4-fold decrease in MIC values and 10-fold decrease in half maximal biofilm inhibitory concentration value. Biofilm eradication assay showed superiority of LIN-LNC-RES over RES against all isolates with disrupted bacterial membranes as revealed by SEM. Mechanistically, qRT-PCR showed that LIN-LNC-RES significantly reduced RNAIII gene expression as well as the expression of SaeRS two component system, potentially affecting quorum sensing and virulence factors expression. RES-loaded LIN-based nanosystem offers a great potential for combating MRSA infections, neutralizing its virulence activity hence, overcoming antimicrobial resistance.",

Therapeutic alternatives, such as the polyphenolic antioxidants curcumin and resveratrol in liposome form, or the drug dutasteride, could be effective for muscular activity. Objective: To measure the acute change in electrical muscle activation after administration of a combination of curcumin in liposomal form, resveratrol, and dutasteride in patients with ALS. Materials and methods: Patients with bulbar and spinal ALS were selected and randomly distributed into an intervention group (IG), which received an oral combination of curcumin in liposomal form/resveratrol® and dutasteride for 2 months, and a control group (CG), which received a placebo. Electrical activity to determine basal muscle activation and fasciculations was measured before and after the intervention using surface electromyography of the biceps brachii (BB), triceps brachii (TB), rectus femoris (RF), and tibialis anterior (TA). Within comparisons of pre and post-muscular variations in each group were conducted. Results: Electrical basal activity increased only for the IG in the right (p = 0.05; g = -0.45) and left (p = 0.004; g = -0.74) hemibody muscles and also presented less variation among them after treatment in the IG. For fasciculations, there was an increase in the total activation of the upper muscles in the IG (p = 0.017; g = -0.86) and for the lower muscles in the CG (p = 0.037; g = -0.68). The pattern of muscle activation remained constant in the IG but experienced variations in the CG."

      "abstract": "Background/Objectives: Millions of new diagnoses of breast cancer are made each year, with many cases having poor prognoses and limited treatment options, particularly for some subtypes such as triple-negative breast cancer. Resveratrol, a naturally occurring polyphenol, has demonstrated many anticancer properties in breast cancer studies. However, the mechanism of action of this compound remains elusive, although prior evidence suggests that this compound may work through altering cancer cell metabolism. Our objective for the current study was to perform untargeted metabolomics analysis on resveratrol-treated breast cancer cells to identify key metabolic targets of this compound. Methods: MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells were treated with varying doses of resveratrol and extracted for mass spectrometry-based untargeted metabolomics. Data preprocessing and filtering of metabolomics data from MCF-7 samples yielded 4751 peaks, with 312 peaks matched to an in-house standards library and 3459 peaks matched to public databases. Results: Pathway analysis in MetaboAnalyst identified significant (p < 0.05) metabolic pathways affected by resveratrol treatment, particularly those involving steroid, fatty acid, amino acid, and nucleotide metabolism. Evaluation of standard-matched peaks revealed acylcarnitines as a major target of resveratrol treatment, with long-chain acylcarnitines exhibiting a 2-5-fold increase in MCF-7 cells and a 5-13-fold increase in MDA-MB-231 cells when comparing the 100 µM treated cells to vehicle-treated cells (p < 0.05, VIP > 1). Notably, doses below 10 µM showed an opposite effect, possibly indicating a biphasic effect of resveratrol due to a switch from anti-oxidant to pro-oxidant effects as dose levels increase. Conclusions: These findings suggest that resveratrol induces mitochondrial metabolic reprogramming in breast cancer cells in a dose-dependent manner. The biphasic response indicates a potential optimal dosage for therapeutic effectiveness. Further research is warranted to explore the mechanisms underlying these metabolic alterations and their implications for precision nutrition strategies in cancer treatment."

      "abstract": "Pseudorabies virus (PRV) can infect most mammals and has caused significant economic losses in global pig production. The emergence of new mutants significantly reduces the protective effect of vaccination, indicating an urgent need for the development of specific therapeutic agents against PRV infection. In this study, we analyzed the changes in the cellular proteome after PRV infection in resveratrol-treated PK-15 cells using TMT quantitative proteomics combined with LC-MS/MS. The results identified the differential proteins osteopontin (iOPN) and interleukin-1 receptor accessory protein (IL-1RAP), which have significant biological implications. The regulation of OPN-IL-1β signaling by PRV infection was further studied through the OPN-ERK/JNK-IL-1β signaling axis. The transcriptional levels of OPN, C-JUN, IL-1RAP, and IL-1β, along with the protein levels of ERK, JNK, C-Jun, and their phosphorylated forms at 8, 12, and 16 h post-infection, were determined. The results showed that PRV infection inhibited the activation of this signaling axis, which was upregulated by resveratrol treatment. Down-regulation of OPN by siRNA increased PRV proliferation and inhibited the activation of the signaling axis, which was antagonized by resveratrol treatment. In PRV-infected mice, resveratrol treatment produced the same changes observed in vitro. The present study demonstrated that resveratrol can promote innate immune responses by regulating the OPN-ERK/JNK-IL-1β signaling axis, thereby activating host antiviral defenses against PRV infection. SIGNIFICANCE: Resveratrol targets the OPN-ERK/JNK-IL-1β axis to enhance innate immunity, offering a novel antiviral strategy against PRV infection. This study identifies OPN as a key regulator of host defense, linking ERK/JNK signaling to IL-1β-mediated antiviral responses. In vivo validation demonstrates resveratrol's therapeutic potential, reducing PRV replication and mortality in mice via immune pathway activation."

This study explores the innovative combination of resveratrol (RES), a phenolic compound, with sunitinib (SUNI), a multitarget tyrosine kinase inhibitor, for targeting human colon adenocarcinoma cell line HT-29. We identified a synergistic effect at a SUNI:RES ratio of 1:8, based on their half-maximal inhibitory concentration values. Increasing the dosage of the combined treatment led to a notable reduction in cell viability, observed in both two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional cell cultures. To improve RES therapeutic efficacy, drug-loaded polymeric nanoparticles (PLGA-RES) were successfully fabricated with an average diameter of 178.4 ± 4.6 nm. The combination of PLGA-RES and free SUNI at the optimal ratio exhibited enhanced anticancer activity, reducing cell viability by approximately 25 and 15% more than PLGA-RES and free SUNI alone, respectively, in 2D cultures. Moreover, this combination therapy demonstrated superior effectiveness in treating HT-29 spheroids over 24 and 48 h. These findings highlight the potential of this combined approach to improve colorectal cancer treatment outcomes."

      "abstract": "Resveratrol (RES), extracted from traditional Chinese medicinal plants, demonstrates notable potential in managing autoimmune diseases by modulating multiple pathways and targeting various immune cell subsets with minimal adverse effects. Current treatments for a novel form of myasthenia gravis (MG) face challenges such as inconsistent efficacy and numerous side effects. The exact mechanisms by which RES affects MG progression remain unclear. To investigate RES's impact on MG, an experimental model was created using Lewis female mice immunized with an antigenic emulsion from the 97-116 region of the rat AChR alpha subunit (R97-116 peptide). RES was administered orally in varying doses. Following treatment, the experimental autoimmune myasthenia gravis (EAMG) model was assessed through several metrics, including EAMG score, autoantibody levels, and antibody affinity via ELISA. Network pharmacology was employed to construct the RES action pathway. Validation of RES effects on immune cell pathways in immune organs was performed using Western blot, real-time PCR, immunofluorescence, and immunohistochemistry, with dendritic cells (DCs) in vitro confirming the pathway. Flow cytometry was used for immunophenotyping. RES mitigated EAMG clinical symptoms and reduced both autoantibody content and affinity in serum. Network pharmacology identified the Foxo1/Foxp3 pathway as integral to RES's therapeutic effects on MG. In the RES-treated group, Foxo1 and Foxp3 expression levels were elevated in the spleen, lymph nodes, and thymus. In vitro experiments indicated decreased Foxp3 expression following Foxo1 inhibition in DCs. Flow cytometry revealed an increase in regulatory DCs, reduced DC activation, and diminished lymphocyte proliferation stimulation. Concurrently, Treg levels increased while germinal center B cells decreased. RES can serve as a potential drug for the treatment of MG, as it can regulate DC cells and other immune cells by affecting the Foxo1/Foxp3 pathway.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Atherosclerosis (AS) poses a pressing challenge in contemporary medicine. Glycolysis is a crucial bioenergetic metabolic pathway that provides the primary energy source for endothelial cells. Resveratrol (Res) is a natural compound that has been shown to possess AS. However, the underlying mechanisms of its anti-atherosclerotic effects are not yet fully understood. METHODS: We established a balloon injury model of the common carotid artery in Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats and an ox-LDL endothelial cell injury model for in vivo and in vitro experiments, respectively. RESULTS: Our study showed that 14 days after balloon-induced injury to the carotid intima of SD rats in vitro, the levels of glycolysis-related proteins fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase 3 (PFKFB3), glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) and hexokinase 2 (HK2) were increased. Meanwhile, Res treatment improved intimal hyperplasia and reduced the levels of expression of these glycolysis-related proteins, and with higher concentrations of Res leading to more pronounced improvements. In vivo, in ox-LDL HUVECs, Res reduced glucose uptake and lactate production, inhibited apoptosis, and decreased the expression of PFKFB3, GLUT1, HK2, and p-AKT. After the addition of a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor, the we established a balloon injury model of the common carotid artery in SD rats and an ox-LDL endothelial cell injury model for in vivo and in vitro experiments, respectively, and expression levels of p-AKT were observed to increase. CONCLUSION: According to these findings, Resveratrol can reduce AS by influencing glycolysis and inhibiting apoptosis through the PI3K-AKT signalling pathway.",

      "abstract": "The KRAS G12D mutation is the most prevalent type of pancreatic cancer and is found in about 35% of patients. Numerous natural chemicals are frequently investigated in cancer treatment to decrease side effects. Resveratrol (RVT) is a polyphenol that can promote cancer cell apoptosis and improve chemotherapy efficacy in cancers. To enhance delivery rate and efficacy, the size of about 30 nm gold nanoparticles (GNPs) was synthesized and conjugated to resveratrol via polyvinylpyrrolidone (GRs) for high bioavailability. Compared to RVT and GNPs, GRs had less inflammatory response and less toxicity on RAW 264.7 cells. This suggests that the toxicity of resveratrol can be alleviated by conjugation with gold nanoparticles. The viability of the human pancreatic cancer cell line (AsPC-1) decreased in sequence of GRs > RVT > GNPs, suggesting an enhanced anticancer effect of the GRs compared to resveratrol (RVT) alone. In addition, the extent of apoptosis was much bigger with GRs compared to RVT and GNPs. The apoptotic effects were confirmed with cell cycle arrest and expression of apoptosis-related genes and proteins. Thus, GRs had a better extent of anticancer effect than RVT, suggesting that GRs be considered as one of the prospective anti-cancer drugs for pancreatic cancer treatment.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Bitter substances, such as resveratrol, alleviate depression by curbing inflammation, yet the mechanisms involved are obscure, not to mention a unified mechanism. Our previous research implies that the type 2 bitter taste receptors (Tas2rs) signaling pathway is crucial for the anti-inflammatory effect of resveratrol, potentially driving its antidepressant action. This study aims to illustrate the possible antidepressant mechanism of resveratrol via Tas2rs-mediated anti-inflammatory pathways which may reveal a common thread in therapeutic action of the bitter. METHOD: Firstly, resveratrol, a typical bitter polyphenol, was selected as a representative of bitter compounds. Then, a phylogenetic analysis and agarose gel electrophoresis of 35 Tas2rs in rats' brain was performed. Subsequently, we established a chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) model with administering resveratrol to evaluate impact of this polyphenol on depressive-like behaviors and the expression of Tas2rs. Meanwhile, inflammation-related proteins were measured within the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex (PFC) using qPCR and western blotting (WB). Further, we utilized qPCR, WB, and calcium (Ca2+) assay kit to scrutinize the expression of Tas2rs downstream signaling pathway in the aforementioned brain areas. Ultimately, proteomics analysis of hippocampus has been employed to speculated the holistic changes post-resveratrol intervention. RESULT: Our investigation has unveiled the considerable heterogeneity and pronounced cerebral expression of Tas2rs. It shows that depressive-like behaviors are induced by CUMS, with 2 Tas2rs in hippocampus and 1 Tas2r in PFC decreasing. Nevertheless, resveratrol exerts its antidepressant effect with 14 Tas2rs increasing in hippocampus but only 1 Tas2r in the PFC. During this process, among the Tas2rs that declined in the hippocampus and PFC following CUMS, only Tas2r123 in hippocampus exhibited a notable increase after resveratrol treatment. Meanwhile, we observe that resveratrol ameliorates the hippocampal inflammation incited by CUMS, an effect not observed in the PFC. Additionally, the Tas2rs downstream signaling pathway is highly involved in the anti-inflammatory property of resveratrol with the context of its antidepressant effect and our previous proteomics have supported these findings. CONCLUSION: The Tas2rs-mediated anti-inflammatory pathway in the hippocampus plays a pivotal role in the antidepressant effect of resveratrol. Concurrently, a Tas2rs mediated anti-inflammatory pathway paradigm has been provide for exploring the common mechanisms underlying the antidepressant and anti-inflammatory properties of bitter substances, offering a novel perspective on the pathophysiology of depression and promising avenues for innovative antidepressant therapies."

As confirmed by morphological analysis, the BSANPs were synthesized using desolvation techniques, resulting in spherical and smooth nanoparticles. Both RES-BSANPs and CS-RES-BSANPs exhibited stability for 90 days at ambient refrigerated temperatures. Through optimization using a Box-Behnken design, RES-BSANPs with favorable colloidal properties were achieved. Differential scanning calorimetry and powder X-ray diffraction confirmed the amorphous dispersion of RES within the nanocarriers. In vitro drug release studies demonstrated a biphasic release pattern aligned with the Korsmeyer-Peppas model, exhibiting both burst and sustained release phases. Stability tests indicated that RES-BSA-NPs and CS-RES-NPs remain stable at 4 °C. Ex vivo studies verified the safety of RES-loaded nanoparticles, and behavioral tests on the Wistar rat model showed that intranasally administered CS-RES-BSANPs were more effective than plain RES dispersion. These results emphasize the potential of biodegradable and mucoadhesive CS-RES-BSANPs as effective drug carriers for intranasal delivery to the brain, offering safety and high tolerability for Alzheimer's disease treatment."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Activated neutrophils can create structures known as neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs/ETs) consisting of nuclear components and granules. The ETOsis phenomenon leads to activating the platelets and coagulation factors. Accordingly, coagulation and fibrinolysis can be promoted. Resveratrol (RSV) is a botanical antioxidant with anti-inflammatory and anti-leukemia effects. The present study was conducted to assess the effect of RSV on the occurrence of ETOsis in the NB4 cell line. METHODS: Human acute promyelocytic leukemia cell line (NB4) were stimulated and treated by lipopolysaccharides (LPS) and RSV, respectively. Sytox green and a fluorescent microscope were used to assess the ETOsis in NB4 cells. Furthermore, the expression level of peptidylarginine deiminase 4 (PAD4) gene and the occurrence of ETOsis in NB4 cells were evaluated by real-time PCR and flow cytometry, respectively. Moreover, an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit was utilized to measure tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) cytokine. RESULTS: Following treatment with RSV, a significant decrease in PAD4 gene expression and TNF-α cytokine concentration in the supernatant of NB4 cell line culture medium was observed. Besides, the amount of ETOsis in the NB4 cells treated with LPS and RSV decreased. CONCLUSION: The findings demonstrated that RSV can inhibit the process of ETOsis in NB4 cells. By inhibiting the process of ETOsis, RSV may be able to reduce the bleeding and, consequently, the failure after treatment in acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) patients.",

Recent studies demonstrated the existence of Isorhapontigenin, a stilbene derivative, differs by its methoxylation pattern but shares a structure identical to resveratrol. Through a review of the literature and an in silico interpretation, the current review will be centered on the anti-inflammatory, anti-cancer, anti-obesity, and other medicinal properties of Isorhapontigenin. The Gnetum genus has species that have a very significant amount of Isorhapontigenin, such as Gnetum parvifolium. Tropical zones of Africa, Asia, and South America are home to the majority of the Gnetaceae family. Several investigations have reported the compound's benefits for health. Isorhapontigenin is very effective against anti-inflammatory, anticancer, antibacterial, antifungal, neuroprotective, antiviral, and antioxidant effects and could be a possible treatment drug. Using network pharmacology (ADME, Networking and Docking), the bioavailability of compound about disorders was examined. KeGG analysis and gene ontology (GO) demonstrated that Isorhapontigenin works via many immune system and cancer pathways. Human COX-1 receptor protein 6Y3C and receptor protein 1CX2 that had the best fit with the drug were used for docking analysis: Docking scores of - 8.2 and - 8.4 for Isorhapontigenin, respectively. In conclusion, Isorhapontigenin is a novel compound in the context of drug development."

      "abstract": "Osteoporosis is a prevalent metabolic bone disorder characterized by decreased bone mineral density and increased fracture risk, particularly among aging populations. While conventional pharmacological treatments exist, they often have adverse effects, necessitating the search for alternative therapies. Resveratrol, a naturally occurring polyphenol, has gained significant attention for its potential osteoprotective properties through various molecular mechanisms. This systematic review aims to comprehensively analyze the molecular pathways through which resveratrol protects against osteoporosis. Using an advanced search strategy in the Scopus, PubMed, and Web of Science databases, we identified 513 potentially relevant articles. After title and abstract screening, followed by full-text review, 28 studies met the inclusion criteria. The selected studies comprised 14 in vitro studies, 8 mixed in vitro and in vivo studies, 6 in vivo studies, and 1 cross-sectional study in postmenopausal women. Our findings indicate that resveratrol exerts its osteoprotective effects by enhancing osteoblast differentiation through the activation of the Phosphoinositide 3-Kinase/Protein Kinase B (PI3K/Akt), Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1), AMP-Activated Protein Kinase (AMPK), and GATA Binding Protein 1 (GATA-1) pathways while simultaneously inhibiting osteoclastogenesis by suppressing Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase (MAPK) and TNF Receptor-Associated Factor 6/Transforming Growth Factor-β-Activated Kinase 1 (TRAF6/TAK1). Additionally, resveratrol mitigates oxidative stress and inflammation-induced bone loss by activating the Hippo Signaling Pathway/Yes-Associated Protein (Hippo/YAP) and Nuclear Factor Erythroid 2-Related Factor 2 (NRF2) pathways and suppressing Reactive Oxygen Species/Hypoxia-Inducible Factor-1 Alpha (ROS/HIF-1α) and NADPH Oxidase 4/Nuclear Factor Kappa-Light-Chain-Enhancer of Activated B Cells (Nox4/NF-κB). Despite promising preclinical findings, the low bioavailability of resveratrol remains a significant challenge, highlighting the need for novel delivery strategies to improve its therapeutic potential. This review provides critical insights into the molecular mechanisms of resveratrol in bone health, supporting its potential as a natural alternative for osteoporosis prevention and treatment. Further clinical studies are required to validate its efficacy and establish optimal dosing strategies.",

The purpose of this study was to determine whether resveratrol induces protective effects against aging-induced cardiac remodeling, mitochondrial dysfunction, and mitochondria-mediated apoptosis in the heart. MATERIALS/METHODS: Thirty-two male Fischer 344 rats were divided into 4 groups: 2 groups that were orally treated with resveratrol (50 mg/kg/day) for 6 weeks (young and old resveratrol groups), and 2 control groups (young and old control groups). Mitochondrial function and mitochondria-mediated apoptotic pathway were analyzed in cardiac muscle fibers from the left ventricle. RESULTS: Resveratrol significantly reduced cardiac hypertrophy and remodeling in aging hearts. In addition, resveratrol significantly ameliorated aging-induced mitochondrial dysfunction (e.g., decreased oxygen respiration and increased hydrogen peroxide emission) and mitochondria-dependent apoptotic signaling (the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio, mitochondrial permeability transition pore opening sensitivity, and cleaved caspase-3 protein levels). Resveratrol also significantly attenuated aging-induced apoptosis (determined via cleaved caspase-3 staining and TUNEL-positive myonuclei) in cardiac muscles. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that resveratrol treatment has a beneficial effect on aging-induced cardiac remodeling by ameliorating mitochondrial dysfunction and inhibiting mitochondria-mediated apoptosis in the heart."

Despite the use of on-farm heat abatement systems, milk production and wellbeing remain suboptimal during spring and summer in North America. Resveratrol, a plant-based polyphenolic compound prevents inflammation and may protect cattle against the pathological effects of heat stress. We hypothesized that resveratrol supplementation would improve thermal homeostasis and productivity in heat-stressed dairy cows. A study was designed to establish the effects of resveratrol supplementation on lactating cows exposed to ambient temperature and relative humidity commonly observed in dairy herds in the Southeastern US during summer. First, second, and ≥ third lactation (n = 14, n = 11, n = 23) Holstein cows averaged (±SD) 41.0 ± 3.9 kg/d, 53.8 ± 6.0 kg/d, and 52.5 ± 8.8 kg/d of milk yield were housed in a sand-bedded freestall barn at University of Tennessee farm in June 2022. Cows were fed a common diet during a baseline period of 1 week followed by an adaptation period of 2 weeks, and a treatment period of 3 weeks. Cows were assigned to either control (CON (n = 24); no administration of resveratrol) or resveratrol administration (RES (n = 24); 0.5 g/d of resveratrol) during the adaptation and treatment periods. Resveratrol was administered to each individual cow in the RES treatment in the morning feeding. During the treatment period, cows did not receive heat abatement from sprinklers and fans. Rectal temperatures and respiratory rates were recorded thrice daily. Milking occurred twice daily, and milk samples were collected at 2 consecutive milkings twice weekly. Blood samples were collected once a week to determine plasma cytokine concentrations and fecal samples were collected once a week to determine water content. Body weights were recorded twice weekly. Data were analyzed using the MIXED procedure in SAS (SAS Institute Inc.). Fixed effects included main effects of treatment, parity, d, time, and all possible interactions with d and time as repeated measure, and animal as random effect. The autoregressive structure was used based on the lower AIC and BIC values. Baseline measurements were collected and included in the model as covariate. Regression analyses were used to determine the relationships of milk production with minimum and average THI and milk production with rectal temperature. During treatment period, cows experienced a daily increment in ambient temperature from 21 to 31°C and the mean THI was >72. Compared with CON, RES cows increased production of milk (35.1 ± 0.5 vs 34.4 ± 0.3 kg/d), lactose (1.66 ± 0.02 vs 1.60 ± 0.01 kg/d) and protein (0.94 ± 0.01 vs 0.90 ± 0.01 kg/d). Compared with CON, RES treatment reduced rectal temperature at noon (treatment × time interaction) and on d 9, 11, 12, 15 and 18 (treatment × day interaction). The respiratory rate increased in RES cows and this effect was more prominent in parity ≥3. The relationship between milk yield and maximum rectal temperature indicated that the decline in milk yield was lower in RES than in CON heat-stressed cows. The body weight increased in parity 1 cows treated with RES (638 ± 6 vs 607 ± 6 kg). Fecal moisture content was greater in RES than in CON animals. In summary, resveratrol improves production and wellbeing in heat-stressed lactating Holstein cows. Polyphenolic compounds may be useful feed additives to reduce detrimental effects of heat stress on commercial operations."

      "abstract": "Pathological mucus hypersecretion is an important clinical hallmark of chronic airway inflammatory diseases and yet there is a lack of effective therapeutic medicine. Resveratrol, a dietary polyphenol, has been shown to possess anti‑aging, antioxidation, anti‑inflammation and tumor prevention effects. However, the effect and underlying mechanism of resveratrol in lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced‑mucus hypersecretion remain to be elucidated. Among more than 20 mucin family members, mucin 5ac (MUC5AC) is a major glycoprotein in airway mucus. The present study investigated the therapeutic effects and mechanisms of resveratrol in LPS‑induced MUC5AC expression in human bronchial epithelial (NCI‑H292) cells and an acute inflammatory murine model. It found that resveratrol markedly attenuated LPS‑induced MUC5AC expression and reactive oxygen species production in NCI‑H292 cells. Moreover, resveratrol increased activation of nuclear factor erythroid‑2‑related factor 2 (Nrf2) and phosphorylation of mitogen‑activated protein kinase (MAPK). Notably, compared with negative control, knockdown of Nrf2 by small interfering RNA and specific inhibitors of ERK/p38 MAPK markedly abrogated the downregulative effect of resveratrol on LPS‑induced MUC5AC expression in NCI‑H292 cells. Additionally, in vivo effects on histopathology and gene expression were assessed in lung tissues collected after intratracheal instillation of LPS with or without resveratrol treatment. Western blotting of lung tissue samples confirmed that administration of resveratrol inhibited MUC5AC expression in LPS‑induced acute inflammatory mice, but increased Nrf2 expression along with phosphorylation of ERK and p38. Periodic acid‑Schiff's staining also showed that resveratrol suppressed mucin production. Compared with the LPS group, administration of resveratrol effectively decreased the numbers of inflammatory cells and neutrophils in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, as well as markedly alleviating the infiltration of exacerbated inflammatory cells in lung tissue. In conclusion, resveratrol exerted protective effects against LPS‑induced MUC5AC overexpression, inflammation and oxidative stress by activating ERK/p38 MAPK and Nrf2 pathway. Furthermore, the results suggested that resveratrol might be a potential therapeutic agent to inhibit airway mucus hyperproduction.",

      "abstract": "The concurrent presence of complex metabolic disorders such as obesity and diabetes within an individual is known as diabesity. Various organs are involved in metabolic chronic diseases like obesity, hypertension, and diabetes. In the last few years, the rise in diabetes cases has coincided with the rapid elevation in obesity rates, resulting in a global health crisis. Major risk factors playing a critical role in the spread of obesity include high-fat food consumption, high-calorie foods, and insufficient physical activity. Diabetes is strongly linked with obesity in terms of metabolic abnormalities and physiological processes, including inflammation. Diabetes type 2 (T2D) is caused primarily by insulin resistance and insufficient insulin release from beta cells of the pancreas. An obese or overweight individual has a strong association with insulin resistance, which in turn leads to the development of T2D. Metabolic stress due to nutrient overload releases different types of inflammatory mediators (such as TNF-α, IL-6, and SFRP4) from adipose tissues in obesity. Secreted frizzled-related protein 4 (SFRP4) is also an inflammatory mediator that impairs insulin secretion. SFRP4 acts as an early biomarker for diabesity expressed with interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β) in the adipose tissues that hinders the exocytosis of insulin-secreting granules from the pancreatic β-cells and is a potential target for preserving β-cell dysfunction and the diabesity treatment. In the current study, plant-based phytocompounds were identified and investigated in silico and in vivo for their ability to suppress the expression of SFRP4. In a diet-induced mouse model, short-listed compounds such as resveratrol and quercetin at higher and lower doses were found effective and significant in reducing the anti-inflammatory mediators and SFRP4 levels. Overall, the current study describes the expression of SFRP4, IL-6, and TNF-α, and its inhibition by various inhibitors. Moreover, the study's findings suggest that resveratrol and quercetin hold promise as potential treatments for diabesity.",

In vitro, pre-treatment of CPCs with increasing doses of fisetin and resveratrol (5μM-100μM) were non-cytotoxic, decreased the senescence index and dampened the expression of cellular senescence markers, p53 and p38MAPK. Additionally, SASP-related genes and proteins (MMP-9, MMP13) and inflammatory mediators (IL-1β, TGF-β, and IL-6) were downregulated. Further, in silico analysis confirmed the high binding affinity of these natural drugs to OA-related proteins. Overall, fisetin and resveratrol dampened the senescence of CPCs by downregulating the p53 effector protein and effectively reducing the SASP.

Using RER structure simulation, site-directed mutagenesis, and biochemical assays, we further determined the key amino acids in RER associated with RSV catalytic activity. Studies in animal models demonstrated that RER enhances RSV's ability to alleviate inflammatory bowel disease.

A POCD model was established in aged Sprague-Dawley rats using sevoflurane anesthesia and laparotomy. Rats were divided into four groups: control, POCD, RES, and POCD + RES. Cognitive performance was assessed using the Morris water maze. Hippocampal tissues were analyzed for neuronal condition using hematoxylin and eosin and Nissl staining. The expression levels of inflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress markers were quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The messenger RNA and protein levels of NRF2, KEAP1, HO-1, and SOD2 were measured using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blotting. RES treatment improved cognitive function, as evidenced by reduced escape latency and increased platform crossings in the Morris water maze. Histopathological analysis showed restoration of hippocampal structure and increased neuronal viability. RES significantly reduced proinflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-1 and IL-6 while increasing IL-10 levels. In addition, RES activated the NRF2/HO-1 pathway by upregulating NRF2, HO-1, and SOD2 expression while downregulating KEAP1. RES mitigates cognitive deficits in POCD by reducing neuroinflammation and oxidative stress through activation of the NRF2/HO-1 signaling pathway. These findings suggest RES is a potential therapeutic candidate for the treatment of POCD in elderly patients.",

Therefore, we urgently need a better way to treat gallstones. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the effects of resveratrol (Res) on cholesterol gallstone formation and explore its underlying mechanisms, focusing on its modulation of hepatic peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPAR-γ) expression, bile cholesterol saturation, and hepatic cholesterol metabolism. METHODS: Thirty-two male C57BL/6 mice were randomly divided into four groups: control, model, ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA), and Res groups. Res (100 mg/kg/day) and UDCA (100 mg/kg/day) were administered via gavage for 5 weeks. Gallbladder bile, liver, and gallbladder tissues were collected for bile cholesterol crystal analysis, bile lipid profiling, and histopathological examination. Protein expression levels of PPARγ and scavenger receptor class B type I (SR-BI) were analyzed using Western blotting and immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Mice fed on a high fat diet resulted in larger gallbladder (about 2 times in both long and width diameters compared to control group) and CG formation, while resveratrol treatment significantly reduced gallstone formation, improved gallbladder dilatation, and declined cholestasis symptoms. Res suppressed hepatic inflammation by downregulating the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) expression and inhibiting the synthesis of proinflammatory factors. Res alleviated liver lipid deposition. It also enhanced PPARγ and SR-BI expression, promoting cholesterol efflux and lowering cholesterol levels, thereby preventing CG formation in mice. CONCLUSION: Resveratrol demonstrates significant potential as a therapeutic agent for the prevention and treatment of cholesterol gallstone disease (CGD) by modulating hepatic cholesterol metabolism, reducing bile cholesterol saturation, and alleviating hepatic inflammation. Further studies are warranted to explore its clinical applicability in humans."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Resveratrol, a natural polyphenol compound, possesses anti-aging, anti-tumor, and vascular protective properties. These attributes are believed to stem from its influence on Sirt1, a member of the human Sirtuin family and a NAD+-dependent Histone Deacetylases (HDACs). OBJECTIVES: This study aims to quantitatively investigate the impact of Resveratrol supplementation on Sirt1 levels in adults by conducting a systematic review and meta-analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) involving Resveratrol supplementation. METHODS: The GRADE-assessed systematic review involved a comprehensive search of PubMed, EMBASE, MEDLINE, Scopus, Web of Science, Cochrane CENTRAL, and Google Scholar databases using related keywords, conducted from March 14th, 2024, to April 15th, 2024, to identify all RCTs investigating Resveratrol's effects on Sirt1. Effect sizes were quantified as mean differences (MD) or standardized mean difference (SMD), with standard deviations (SD) of outcomes. An overall effect estimate was derived using a random-effects model when ≥ 2 studies reported similar outcomes. Statistical heterogeneity was assessed through the calculation of I2 statistics. Additionally, a dose-response analysis was performed to assess potential dose-response relationships. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool for RCTs (RoB2.0). Publication bias was evaluated using Begg's test and a meta-regression using the year of publication as a moderator. RESULTS: Eleven RCTs examining the effects of Resveratrol on Sirt1 gene expression (4 RCTs), protein expression (5 RCs), and serum levels (3 RCTs) were included in the meta-analysis. The results showed no significant impact of Resveratrol on Sirt1 gene expression (SMD = 0.05; 95% CI: -0.24, 0.344, p = 0.73), protein expression (SMD = 0.3; 95% CI: -0.15, 0.77, p = 0.18), or serum levels (MD = -0.04; 95% CI: -0.235, 0.16, p = 0.7). However, subgroup analyses suggested a significant increase in Sirt1 gene expression in studies with an intervention duration of less than 12 weeks and evaluating blood tissue. Furthermore, the impact of Resveratrol on Sirt1 appeared to be influenced by the dosage regimen, with a significant effect for intervention duration. CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates that Resveratrol supplementation does not significantly influence human Sirt1 based on the overall meta-analysis. However, the dose-response analysis suggests that the effect of Resveratrol on Sirt1 depends on the dosage regimen."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a hematologic malignancy characterized by the BCR-ABL1 fusion gene, which drives the uncontrolled proliferation of myeloid cells. Despite advancements in treatment, resistance to conventional therapies remains a significant challenge. Resveratrol, a natural polyphenol, has garnered attention for its potential therapeutic properties, including its ability to modulate key genes and induce apoptosis in cancer cells. This study investigated the effects of resveratrol on apoptosis, cell cycle regulation, and DNA fragmentation in CML cells. METHODS: K562 CML cells were treated with resveratrol, and their effects were analyzed through CCK-8 assay for cell viability, TUNEL assay for DNA fragmentation, and real-time PCR for gene expression. Key apoptotic genes (BCL-2, AIF, BAX) were assessed alongside survival-related genes (CASP3, PGC1α, Cyclin-D1, p53) to evaluate resveratrol's anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic potential. RESULT: Resveratrol exhibited a time-dependent reduction in K562 cell viability, with IC₅₀ values decreasing from 282.2 µM at 24 hours to 107.1 µM and 102.4 µM at 48 and 72 hours, respectively. Apoptotic activity, assessed via the TUNEL assay, revealed significant DNA fragmentation in 55 ± 5% of treated cells, while control cells showed no fragmentation. Gene expression analysis demonstrated upregulation of pro-apoptotic genes, including BCL-2, AIF (p < 0.05), BAX (p < 0.01), and VDAC1 (4.5-fold, p < 0.001). Conversely, genes linked to cell survival and metabolism, such as CASP3, PGC1α, NDUFA9, Cyclin-D1, and p53, were slightly downregulated (p < 0.05), highlighting resveratrol's dual role in promoting apoptosis and inhibiting cell survival. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that resveratrol exerts anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects in CML cells by modulating key genes and induction of DNA fragmentation, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic agent for CML treatment.",

      "abstract": "Chronic kidney disease increases the risk of cardiovascular disease, partly due to uremic toxins, such as Kynurenine (KYN). While KYN contributes to tissue damage, its role in cardiomyocyte apoptosis and autophagy remains unclear. Resveratrol (RSV) can protect against oxidative stress and inflammation, whereas its specific effects on KYN-induced cardiomyopathy are less understood. This study aimed to investigate the role of KYN in cardiomyocyte apoptosis and autophagy and examine the protective effects of RSV against KYN-induced damage. H9C2 cardiomyocytes were cultured and treated with KYN in presence or absence of RSV or inhibitors of the AhR/Src/MAPKs pathway. Cell viability, apoptosis, mitochondrial membrane potential, and autophagy were assessed using MTT, TUNEL, JC-1, and autophagy detection assays. KYN induced apoptosis, and autophagy in H9C2 cells. RSV pretreatment reduced apoptosis but enhanced autophagy in KYN-treated cells. Inhibiting autophagy or blocking apoptosis, increased KYN-induced apoptosis and autophagy, respectively. Additionally, KYN treatment enhanced AhR activation and the phosphorylation of Src and MAPKs proteins, whereas RSV pretreatment decreased AhR activation and ERK phosphorylation. Inhibitors of p38 MAPK and JNK reduced expression of apoptotic proteins. AhR inhibition also reduced the phosphorylation of p38 MAPK and expression of apoptotic proteins while it enhanced autophagy-related protein expression in KYN treated H9C2 cells. In conclusion, our findings suggest that KYN induces cardiomyocyte apoptosis via the AhR/p38 MAPK pathway whereas RSV can protect against the KYN-induced apoptosis while promoting autophagy. Given the high cardiovascular risk in CKD patients, these findings provide in-sight into potential therapeutic strategies targeting KYN-induced cardiomyopathy.",

Consequently, resveratrol (RES) is gaining attention as an emerging therapeutic agent due to its exercise-like effects. However, RES's instability and low aqueous solubility have limited its applications. This research report focuses on the loading, solubilization, and sustained delivery of RES using a dendrimer complex loaded liposomal formulation. The safety and efficacy of formulation was studied by performing various assays. The DEN-RES complex loaded liposomes were optimized using a Quality by Design (QbD) approach whereas particle size, PDI and zeta potential were found to be 159.29 ± 0.58 nm, 0.206 ± 0.008, and -7.2 ± 0.14 mV, which followed first-order release kinetics for sustained RES release. The mRNA levels of the SIRT1 and AMPK genes were found to be upregulated by more than two folds, whereas the LIPO-DEN-RES downregulated the mRNA expression of PPARγ in adipocytes. Therefore, the modulation of mRNA levels detected in 3T3-L1 cells post-treatment with the LIPO-DEN-RES validates the formulation's potential in addressing obesity.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Fertility preservation is a critical concern for reproductive-age cancer survivors, as conventional cytotoxic therapies can cause irreversible damage to the reproductive system, potentially depriving them of the ability to have children in the future. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), including anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (anti-PD-1), have become a standard therapeutic approach for various malignancies. However, the impact of ICIs on reproductive function and fertility is not well understood and remains a largely unexplored domain. Resveratrol (RSV), a plant-derived compound, has shown potential as an nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2) agonist to counteract reproductive toxicity induced by various diseases, drugs, and environmental toxins. METHODS: Male C57BL6/J mice with B16 melanoma were assigned into four groups. RSV and ICI/RSV groups received RSV (40 mg/kg) orally every other day for one month, while controls received the vehicle. ICI and ICI/RSV groups were injected with anti-PD-1 antibody (10 mg/kg) weekly, and controls received IgG2b kappa antibody. Parameters like body and testicular weight, sperm concentration, and western blot for ferroptosis markers were measured. Furthermore, oxidative stress biomarkers, lipid oxidation factors, and gonadal hormone levels were quantified using commercial kits. RESULTS: Anti-PD-1 therapy caused male reproductive dysfunction, as evidenced by reduced sperm concentration, altered gonadal hormone levels, and disruption of blood-testis barrier (BTB) integrity. Furthermore, ferroptosis was a key mechanism in anti-PD-1-induced testicular dysfunction, characterized by disrupted iron homeostasis, elevated lipid peroxidation, and suppression of the system Xc-/glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) axis. Additionally, anti-PD-1 therapy diminished antioxidant defenses by inhibiting the NRF2 pathway, thereby increasing the susceptibility to ferroptosis. Crucially, RSV treatment ameliorated anti-PD-1-induced reproductive dysfunction. This was achieved by reducing T cell infiltration, lowering interferon-gamma levels, activating the NRF2 pathway, and maintaining iron and lipid homeostasis. CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates that anti-PD-1 triggers oxidative stress and ferroptosis in the testis, causing male reproductive dysfunction. RSV may offer protection against testicular toxicity associated with anti-PD-1, particularly through its antioxidant and anti-ferroptosis properties.",

      "abstract": "According to statistics, more than one-third of the global population currently experiences sleep problems, and about 10% of adults have been diagnosed with insomnia, a proportion that is increasing annually. Most currently used insomnia medications are not specifically developed but are discovered by chance, often resulting in unavoidable side effects like addiction. Thus, there is an urgent need to find safer and more effective therapeutic options. Resveratrol, a natural polyphenolic compound, shows significant potential in improving insomnia. Research shows that its effects may be achieved through multiple biological processes, including antiapoptosis, antioxidant activity, anti-inflammation, circadian rhythm regulation, modulation of neurotransmitters (gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), DA, 5-HT, cortisol), and increased levels of neurotrophic factor BDNF. Additionally, resveratrol's treatment of insomnia is closely linked to the SIRT1, AMPK, NF-κB, mTOR, PI3K/Akt, and MAPK pathways. This review summarizes the mechanisms of resveratrol in treating insomnia to provide researchers with a deeper understanding of its action, which can aid in the development of novel targeted drugs and offer innovative ideas and methods for clinical insomnia treatment.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers among women. Tumor cell proliferation is highly dependent on aerobic glycolysis, so regulating aerobic glycolysis in breast cancer cells is a promising therapeutic strategy. Resveratrol (Res), as a potential new anti-breast cancer drug, has been shown to regulate the glycolysis of cancer cells and inhibit the metastasis and recurrence of breast cancer. The nano drug delivery system can regulate the aerobic glycolysis metabolism by targeting the signaling factors and reaction products of the tumor aerobic glycolysis process to enhance the anti-tumor effect. METHODS: A new albumin-modified layered double hydroxide resveratrol dosage form (BSA@LDHs-Res) was synthesized by hydrothermal co-precipitation. Characterization was carried out to determine the successful synthesis of the nanocarrier system. The bioactivity, glycolytic activity and biocompatibility were examined by in vitro cellular assays; in vivo experiments were performed to further evaluate the anti-tumor effects of the BSA@LDHs-Res dosage form for breast cancer. RESULTS: In this study, we obtained for the first time a bovine serum albumin-modified BSA@LDHs-Res loaded dosage form, which was able to enter breast cancer cells SKBR3 and MDA-MB-231 via endocytosis and successfully escaped from lysosomal capture. BSA@LDHs-Res inhibited the proliferation, migration, and invasion of two types of breast cancer cells, induced apoptosis, and promoted the reduction of mitochondrial membrane potential and ROS. BSA@LDHs-Res inhibited the expression and viability of the key enzymes of glycolysis, hexokinase 2 (HK2), pyruvate kinase (PK), and lactate dehydrogenase, resulting in decreased glucose consumption, decreased lactate accumulation, and decreased intracellular ATP levels. BSA@LDHs-Res was examined in the mouse model with good anti-tumor effects. CONCLUSION: BSA@LDHs-Res is an efficient nanoreagent for the treatment of breast cancer. The albumin-modified resveratrol layered double hydroxide delivery system developed in this study will provide some theoretical references for further research and clinical application of tumor aerobic glycolysis.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Resveratrol (RES), a polyphenol with putative estrogen (E2) -like effects, is believed to counteract left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). However, how RES exerts its protection is not well understood, particularly when prominent risk factors, such as E2 depletion and pressure overload (PO), coexist. Here, we evaluated the impact of RES and E2 on angiogenesis and LVH in rats subjected to ovariectomy (OVX) and PO. METHODS: Three weeks after bilateral OVX induction, abdominal aortic banding was performed on Wistar female rats to trigger PO. The animals were treated with either RES or E2 for six weeks. Finally, the heart-to-body weight ratio (HW/BW), cell size, fibrosis, and atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) mRNA expression were assessed. Angiogenesis was determined by evaluating vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) mRNA and protein expression and by CD31 immunostaining. Serum E2 levels were also measured. RESULTS: OVX + PO caused more severe myocardial hypertrophy (HW/BW) and fibrosis compared with PO alone, but did not aggravate cell size and ANP mRNA expression. OVX blunted the angiogenic response to PO, with reduced VEGF expression. RES increased VEGF expression and CD31, and abrogated LVH and fibrosis. E2 treatment improved VEGF expression and fibrosis, but not to the same extent as RES. RES improved serum levels of E2 in OVX + PO rats. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that RES limits OVX-induced exacerbation of LVH and fibrosis in a PO model, and targets systemic E2 levels and myocardial angiogenesis as underpinning protective mechanisms. Thus, RES may provide cardioprotection for post-menopausal women.",

Oxidative stress (OS) seems to be involved in cases of AZS otherwise termed \"idiopathic,\" so antioxidant molecules have gained increasing interest in the treatment of infertility. In the present study, the in vitro effects of two different concentrations (12 and 30 µM) of resveratrol (RSV), a potent natural antioxidant, on sperm motility and OS counteragent of 154 subjects with AZS were evaluated. After 1 hour at 37 °C, the control group and the group treated with 12 µM of RSV showed a slight increase in progressive motility (PM) and a simultaneous decrease in non-progressive motility (NP). Conversely, the group treated with 30 µM of RSV showed a significant decrease in all motility parameters. Moreover, a significant decrease in Dichlorofluorescein (DCF) fluorescence intensity from controls (248.14 ± 111.16 a.u.) was observed both in group treated with 12 µM (152.47 ± 110.59 a.u., p < 0.0001) and 30 µM of RSV (128.06 ± 94.21 a.u., p < 0.0001). These findings support the hypothesis that excessive ROS reduction may lead to redox unbalance that could paradoxically worsen the seminal parameters of subjects with AZS when treated with excessive doses of antioxidants."

Two-dimensional cell culture is insufficient to simulate the protective effects of CAFs on tumors, resulting in experimental bias in drug efficacy assays. CAF-organoid co-culture model applied in this study may help solve this problem. Resveratrol (Res) has been found to suppresses BC growth, yet its effects on CAF-protected BC remain unknown. METHODS: Surgical resected BC tissues were harvested and established for BC organoids (BCOs, identified with pathological examination) and isolated for CAFs (identified with immunofluorescence) respectively. BCO-CAF co-culture system was established and was measured for the protection effects of CAFs on BCOs. The system was then treated with Res and tested for EdU proliferation assay and calcein-AM/PI viable/non-viable cell labeling. Biogenic analysis was performed and showed that VCAN from CAFs may be important in this process. Versican (VCAN) expression levels in CAFs with or without Res treatment were evaluated by immunohistochemistry, qRT-PCR, and Western blotting. RESULTS: 19 BCO cases were successfully cultured and confirmed with pathological examination. Res showed inhibitory effects on 15 of the 19 BCO cases (78.95 %). Although CAFs facilitated organoid growth of BCOs by 69.75 ± 14.78 %, Res treatment eliminated this effect and caused extensive cell death (84.97 % ±5.06 %) in CAF-coated BCOs, accompanied by a decrease in VCAN and TGF-β expression in CAFs. CONCLUSIONS: The anti-BC value of Res was further proved by showing its promising suppressive effects on BCOs with or without the presence of CAFs.",

Investigating the effectiveness of liposomal formulations in managing hyperlipidemia is essential. Resveratrol (RES)-loaded nanoliposomes present a promising new approach for hyperlipidemia treatment. In this study, we investigated the anti-hyperlipidemic potential of RES-loaded nanoliposomes in high-fat diet (HFD)-fed rats. The nanoliposomes were prepared using a thin-film hydration method. According to transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and dynamic light scattering (DLS) results, the mean size of prepared RES-loaded nanoliposomes were about 42 nm and 68 nm, respectively, with a zeta potential of -65.6 mV. The entrapment efficiency and loading content were 83.78% and 14.25%, respectively. Additionally, the RES-loaded nanoliposomes exhibited controlled release kinetics compared to the free RES form. Moreover, in a hyperlipidemic rat model induced by an HFD, orally administered RES-loaded nanoliposomes significantly reduced total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (VLDL-C), and triglycerides (TG), while concurrently increasing high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels. Additionally, liver damage induced by HFD was alleviated by RES-loaded nanoliposomes. The expression levels of Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) and TIR domain-containing adaptor-inducing interferon-β (TRIF) were assessed using fluorescence immunohistochemistry. Notably, RES-loaded nanoliposomes significantly reduced the expression of these protein. The effect of RES-loaded nanoliposomes was measured on body weight of HFD rats, demonstrting RES-loaded nanoliposomes hold promise for weight management. These findings underscore the potential of RES-loaded nanoliposomes as a safe and effective therapeutic option for hyperlipidemia."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Breast cancer is a widespread type of cancer found across the world. The use of chemotherapy in breast cancer treatment may result in side effects and the emergence of drug resistance. Hence, seeking new and efficient therapies that reduce adverse reactions is imperative. Recently, combination therapy has emerged as a fresh and innovative strategy in contrast to conventional treatment methods. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) serves as a highly effective and minimally invasive technique for addressing breast cancer, providing the option to be utilized either concurrently or in conjunction with other therapeutic approaches. Resveratrol (RES) is a polyphenol found in several food sources. Research has demonstrated that RES can inhibit cell proliferation and metastasis and trigger apoptosis in tumor cells. This research aimed to assess the impact of combining RES and photodynamic therapy on MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. METHODS: MDA-MB-231 cells were grown in culture and subsequently exposed to different methylene blue (MB) doses while subjected to laser irradiation (PDT). Following this treatment, the cells were exposed to different RES concentrations. Cell viability was assessed utilizing the MTT assay. Light and fluorescence microscopy (AO/EB staining) were employed to observe cell morphological alterations following exposure to RES and MB-PDT. Additionally, flow cytometry was utilized to investigate cell cycle progression and apoptosis induction. RESULTS: The findings indicated that the co-administration of MB-PDT and RES resulted in increased cytotoxic effects on MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells compared to the individual application of either treatment. DISCUSSION: The results of this study suggest that MB-PDT can reduce the dose and time of RES treatment and, therefore, can be indicated as a new approach for treating breast cancer cells.",

The efficacy of plant-derived polyphenolic compounds has been extensively demonstrated with respect to various aspects and recently proved to be effective at preventing and treating NAFLD. To describe the sources and functions of polyphenolic constituents and clarify the therapeutic effects of polyphenolic constituents on NAFLD, resveratrol (RSV), which has significant therapeutic effects, was selected for a comprehensive analysis. Bibliometric and network pharmacology analyses revealed a strong correlation between insulin resistance (IR), oxidative stress, steatosis, and NAFLD, as well as the significance of intestinal flora and therapeutic interventions for NAFLD. This study reviewed the mechanisms by which RSV acted against NAFLD and explored techniques to enhance its bioavailability. These findings offer new insights into the treatment of NAFLD and the development of innovative RSV formulations.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Growing evidence indicate that prenatal intermittent hypoxia (PIH) exposure can have an impact on the critical brain nerve development of the fetus, resulting in cognitive deficits in the offspring mice. Resveratrol, recognized for its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant capabilities, has potential to ameliorate synaptic dysfunction, which in turn may contribute to its positive influence on cognitive impairment. Nevertheless, the precise manner in which resveratrol mitigates cognitive deficits stemming from maternal hypoxia remains to be fully elucidated, including the specific mechanisms at play. METHOD: Pregnant C57BL/6J mice were exposed to intermittent hypoxia using the ProOx-100 animal hypoxia control system during late pregnancy for 7 consecutive days. Resveratrol treatment at 40 mg/kg dosage was given to the subjects between postnatal Days 60 and 88. Morris water maze test was utilized to assess the cognitive capabilities of the male offspring mice. ELISA was employed to measure the concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines within the hippocampal region of the mature offspring mice. The expression levels of the regulatory proteins SIRT1 and HIF-1α, along with the synaptic plasticity markers SYP, Arc, GAP-43, and PSD-95 were measured by employing western blotting and RT-qPCR. RESULTS: In male offspring subjected to PIH, there was a marked decline in learning and memory capabilities, accompanied by increased levels of IL-1, IL-6, and TNF-α within the hippocampal region. Administration of resveratrol notably ameliorated the cognitive deficits observed in these offspring and mitigated the heightened levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Furthermore, exposure to PIH was associated with a reduction in the expression of key proteins such as SIRT1, HIF-1α, Arc, GAP-43, PSD-95, and SYP within the hippocampal region, which were subsequently normalized following resveratrol intervention. CONCLUSION: The findings from our study indicate that resveratrol potently alleviates learning and memory impairments, the inflammatory response, and impairments in synaptic plasticity, which are induced by maternal intermittent hypoxia, by modulating the SIRT1/HIF-1α signaling pathway.",

      "abstract": "Resveratrol alleviates liver fibrosis in mice by upregulating IL-10 to reprogram the macrophage phenotype; however, the mechanism remains to be elucidated. Building on our previous work, in this study, we aimed to determine the role of the TLR2/MyD88/ERK and NF-κB/NLRP3 inflammasome pathways in mediating the effects of resveratrol on liver fibrosis and macrophage polarization. We investigated the expression of cytokines in these inflammasome pathways in a mouse model of liver fibrosis and resveratrol-treated macrophages. The results showed that expression of TLR2, MyD88, ERK, and NF-κB1 in liver tissues was increased in the fourth week after treatment with resveratrol but decreased in the fifth week. Similar results were obtained for the NF-κB/NLRP3 inflammasome pathway. The results also showed that cytokines in both the TLR2/MyD88/ERK and NF-κB/NLRP3 inflammasome pathways in macrophages were elevated after 24 h and reduced after 36 h of treatment with resveratrol. Immunofluorescence and nucleocytoplasmic separation assays showed that resveratrol inhibited the translocation of NF-κB from the cytoplasm to the nucleus in macrophages, and increased NF-κB1 was associated with inhibition of the TLR2/MyD88/ERK pathway. Silencing NF-κB1 increased the expression of TLR2, MyD88, and ERK. In conclusion, the TLR2/MyD88/ERK and NF-κB/NLRP3 inflammasome pathways are involved in the effect of resveratrol on macrophage polarization and the subsequent modulation of liver fibrosis. NF-κB1 acts as the common cytokine that coordinates the crosstalk between the two pathways. Our findings highlight the potential of the members of these pathways as therapeutic targets toward the treatment of liver fibrosis.",

      "abstract": "Physical exercise is an essential component of human health. In recent years, scientific research has focused on identifying natural compounds and formulating new supplements aimed at enhancing athletic performance, accelerating muscle recovery, and minimizing the damage caused by physical exertion. The use of antioxidants to counteract the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) following physical activity (PA) is already a widely adopted practice. Resveratrol (RES), a polyphenol belonging to the stilbene class, is well known for its potent antioxidant activity and anti-inflammatory effects primarily attributed to the activation of sirtuins. RES possesses multiple nutraceutical properties used for the prevention and treatment of inflammatory, cardiovascular, neoplastic, and infectious diseases, thus attracting attention to study its use in combination with physical exercise to promote well-being. Animal trials combining RES and PA have mainly reported improvements in muscle, energy, and cardiovascular functions. The data presented and discussed in this narrative review are from Pubmed, Scopus, and the Human Gene Database (search limited to 2011 to 2025 with the keywords RES, sirtuins, and physical activity altogether or in combination with each other). This review gathers several studies on RES focusing on its nutraceutical properties, epigenetic activities via sirtuins, and the potential benefits of combining RES with PA in maintaining health and well-being based on trials performed first in animals and later in humans. Human studies have been conducted on various populations, including active adults, sedentary individuals, patients with diseases, and elderly individuals. Some studies have confirmed the benefits of RES observed in animal experiments. However, in some cases, no substantial differences were found between RES supplementation and the control group. In conclusion, the benefits of RES on PA reported in the literature are still not fully evident, given the contrasting studies and the still limited number of trials, but both RES and PA are successful tools for the maintenance of health and wellbeing.",

      "abstract": "Neuronal hyperexcitability in the rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM), driven by oxidative stress, plays a crucial role in stress-induced hypertension (SIH). While resveratrol (RSV) is known for its antioxidant properties, its effects on RVLM neurons in SIH remain unclear. We investigated this using an SIH rat model exposed to electric foot shocks and noise stimulation for 15 days. Analysis of RVLM tissue revealed increased mitochondrial damage, oxidative stress, apoptosis, and dysregulated ferroptosis in SIH rats. RSV microinjection into the RVLM reduced blood pressure, sympathetic vascular tone, and neuronal excitability. Both in vivo and in vitro studies showed that RSV treatment alleviated mitochondrial oxidative stress, apoptosis, and ferroptosis through AMPK activation and subsequent Sirt3 upregulation. These therapeutic effects were blocked by either AMPK inhibition or Sirt3 knockdown. Our findings demonstrate that RSV attenuates SIH by activating the AMPK/Sirt3 pathway, thereby reducing RVLM oxidative stress and cell death."

      "abstract": "Diabetic wounds are a common complication of diabetes and pose a significant threat to human health. High glucose concentration in the wound remains a major obstacle, necessitating effective strategies to achieve sustained glucose consumption for synergistic diabetic wound therapy. In this study, an Au-based nanomaterial is developed that can adjust its morphology in different therapeutic processes. The prepared Au nanowire (ANW) can be converted into Au nanospheres (AS) under ultrasonic conditions by adjusting the amount of polyethylene glycol (PEG) on its surface for convenient delivery. Intriguingly, AS is depolymerized into ANW again in the wound area, prolonging the retention time, and ensuring continuous consumption of glucose. After constructing the morphologically switchable Au nanowire, a polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) is applied it to microneedle and co-delivered it with hemoglobin (Hb)-resveratrol (RES) nanoparticles for synergistic diabetic wound therapy. In a streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic mouse model, the microneedle degraded gradually, and the Hb-RES nanoparticles synergistically ameliorated hypoxia, scavenged ROS, and inhibited macrophage differentiation into pro-inflammatory M1 phenotypes. During this process, ANW continuously catalyzed glucose through its inherent glucose oxidase activity. Thus, this study provides novel insights into the long-term management of glucose concentration during synergistic diabetic wound healing.",

This illness has significant health risks as it easily relapses, thus, providing a considerable threat to human health. A number of inflammatory mediators, oxidative stress and role of gut microbes have been studied thoroughly to understand the exact pathophysiology behind the disease occurrence. Several conventional therapies are available for the treatment of ulcerative colitis but each one of them have one or the other side effect. Therefore, to overcome this limitation, we are moving ahead towards herbal drug therapies. The current review presents the emerging role of Resveratrol, a natural occurring polyphenol derived from plant species. It is associated with potential antioxidative and anti-inflammatory properties. Protective effects of Resveratrol in different ulcerative colitis induced animal models are discussed in this review. Various strategies to improve bioavailability of drug include encapsulation of drug in several nanocarriers. Although many animal models have proved the effectiveness of Resveratrol in the treatment of ulcerative colitis, further research on human subjects is still required to understand the exact mechanism and safety to establish its uses clinically."

Male Wister rats were divided into eight groups and fed with either a standard diet (control), high fructose (HF), high fat (HFAT), or a high- fructose high- fat (HF/HFAT) diet and supplemented with RSV (30 mg/kg/day) for 4 weeks. The food intake, body weight, glycemic parameters, lipid profile, oxidative stress were assessed. SIRT1 gene expression, PGC-1α, cyto-c and GLUT-4 were evaluated by qRT-PCR in adipose tissue of normal and obese rats. The body weight gain, serum fasting glucose, insulin, and HOMA-IR values were significantly higher in the HF and HF/HFAT groups than in the HFAT and control groups. Hyperlipidemia was observed in high calorie diets fed rats compared to control group. The levels of total cholesterol, triglycerides and LDL-c were significantly elevated while HDL- c was significantly decreased in HF & HF/HFAT groups compared to HFAT group. The levels of serum malondialdhyde (MDA) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity in adipose tissue were elevated in all groups compared to control group, particularly in the groups that were kept on a high fructose diets (HF, HF/HFAT). SIRT-1, PGC-1α, Cyto-c, and GLUT-4 genes levels were significantly down regulated in HF, HFAT & HF/HFAT groups compared to control group. Supplementation of T-RSV restored the alteration in carbohydrates-lipid metabolism as well as oxidative stress and upregulation of SIRT-1, PGC-1α, Cyto-c, and GLUT-4 genes. RSV is a promising treatment in the management of pathologic consequences of obesity from high-calorie diet consumption via molecular alteration of target genes.",

Resveratrol (RES) is a natural component, known for its anti-inflammatory and anti-osteoporotic effects. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the bone-protective and anti-osteoporotic effects of resveratrol in rats with chronic kidney disease-induced osteoporosis. The 5/6th nephrectomy (Nx) model of CKD was established. Resveratrol and alendronate (ALN), as standard drug, were administered for 45 days. Blood samples and femurs were collected and subjected to molecular analysis, micro-CT, and bone mechanical tests. The results showed a significant decrease in Ca levels but no significant changes in 1,25 vitamin D and phosphorus levels in untreated and treated CKD groups. Treatment with RES and ALN did not reverse the increase of serum parathyroid hormone while reducing the elevated FGF-23 levels. Unlike ALN, RES had no significant effect on increased alkaline phosphatas levels or decreased osteocalcin and OPG levels in CKD rats. Moreover, results showed that RES reversed the increase of RANKL and TRAP in serum and femur tissue close to the control level, leading to an improvement in bone strength and microarchitecture. In conclusion, the present study showed beneficial anti-osteoporotic effects of RES on CKD-induced osteoporosis.",

Ferroptosis, a form of regulated cell death characterized by iron-dependent lipid peroxidation, has been implicated in the progression of AS, particularly in macrophages. In the study, we constructed a macrophage targeted hybridization nanodrug of HMLRPP, which used Pit-loaded Poly(lactic-co-glycolic) acid (PLGA) nanoparticles (NPs) and Res-loaded liposomes as nano-core, then, coated with a macrophage membrane hybridized by hyaluronic acid. The nanodrug prolonged blood circulation time and achieved optimal Res and Pit accumulation in the atherosclerotic plaques by effectively evading immune system clearance. In vivo studies demonstrated that HMLRPP NPs significantly attenuated plaque progression, characterized by decreased plaque area, less lipid deposition, and increased collagen. Meanwhile, HMLRPP NPs inhibited macrophage ferroptosis by decreasing the expression of β-Hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase 1 (BDH1), Orosomucoid 1 (ORM1) and enhancing the expression of Ribosomal protein S27-like (RPS27L), which resulted in the alleviation of lipid accumulation and inflammation. Our data suggest that the HMLRPP nanodrug delivery system with ferroptosis-regulating capability provides a feasible therapeutic strategy for atherosclerosis.",

      "abstract": "African American women face a disproportionately big challenge from Triple Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC), the deadliest form of breast cancer, marking a critical issue in the fields of women's health and oncology in the United States. This group experiences a 40% higher mortality rate compared to women of other ethnicities, highlighting a significant disparity, and underscoring the urgent need for the development of targeted, effective treatments, specifically tailored to address these demographic women. Towards this, the efficacy of high intensity, short duration electrical pulses combined with Resveratrol (Resv), a natural polyphenol, as a novel therapeutic agent against TNBC is investigated. Electrical pulses facilitate enhanced drug transport through the opening of pores in cell membrane for those molecules that are normally non-permeable. This approach addresses the challenge of Resv's limited bioavailability and enhances its apoptotic potential. Employing MDA-MB-468 cell line, derived from an African American woman, this study investigates the effects of Resv and electrical pulses (EP) on TNBC cells. The TNBC cells were treated with Resv and subjected to eight pulses of multiple electric fields ranging from 500V/cm to 1200V/cm at 100μs, and at 1Hz, followed by assessments monitoring viability, colony formation, and intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels. The results indicate an 84% reduction in live cancer cell viability and a 4-fold increase in ROS levels with the combined treatment, suggesting a promising approach to alternative TNBC therapy. This research evaluates a natural bio compound, along with an advanced drug delivery system, targeting a reduction in mortality rates and improved quality of life for TNBC patients.",

However, a comprehensive analysis of these data is currently unavailable. This study aimed to systematically review the preclinical evidence regarding RES's effects on animal models of pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer via meta-analyses and optimised machine learning techniques. METHODS: Animal studies published from inception until June 30th 2024, were systematically retrieved and manually filtrated across databases including PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, Ovid MEDLINE, Scopus, and Cochrane Library. Methodological quality of the included studies was evaluated following the SYRCLE's RoB tool. Predefined outcomes included histopathology and relevant biochemical parameters for acute pancreatitis, and tumour weight/tumour volume for pancreatic cancer, comparing treatment and model groups. Pooled effect sizes of the outcomes were calculated using STATA 17.0 software. Machine learning techniques were employed to predict the optimal usage and dosage of RES in pancreatitis models. RESULTS: A total of 50 studies comprising 33 for acute pancreatitis, 1 chronic pancreatitis, and 16 for pancreatic cancer were included for data synthesis after screening 996 records. RES demonstrated significant improvements on pancreatic histopathology score, pancreatic function parameters (serum amylase and lipase), inflammatory markers (TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, and pancreatic myeloperoxidase), oxidative biomarkers (malondialdehyde and superoxide dismutase), and lung injury (lung histopathology and myeloperoxidase) in acute pancreatitis models. In pancreatic cancer models, RES notably reduced tumour weight and volume. Machine learning highlighted tree-structured Parzen estimator-optimised gradient boosted decision tree model as achieving the best performance, identifying course after disease induction, total dosage, single dosage, and total number of doses as critical factors for improving pancreatic histology. Optimal single dosage was 20-105 mg/kg with 3 to 9 doses. CONCLUSION: This study comprehensively demonstrates the therapeutic effects of RES in mitigating pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer in animal models. Anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidative, and anti-tumour growth properties are potential mechanisms of action for RES.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Resveratrol, a natural bitter polyphenol, exhibits significant antidepressant property. Numerous studies have linked its antidepressant effect to neuroplasticity enhancement or mitochondrial regulation. However, the interplay between these two mechanisms remains unclear. This study aims to elucidate the relationship among resveratrol's antidepressant effect, its regulatory impact on neuroplasticity and mitochondrial function, and to investigate the potential role of the type 2 bitter taste receptors (Tas2rs) in these processes. METHODS: A chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) model was used to induce depressive-like behaviors, while resveratrol was administered as an intervention. Following CUMS and resveratrol treatment, proteomic analysis combined with bioinformatics predicted significantly altered biological pathways in the hippocampus. The aforementioned predictions were validated using Western blotting (WB), Golgi staining, Nissl staining, and electron microscopy. Additionally, Tas2rs expression and calcium (Ca2 +) levels in the hippocampus were quantified using quantitative PCR, WB, and calcium assay kit. Finally, immunofluorescence (IF) colocalization was used to examine the association of Tas2r123 with mitochondrial outer membrane in hippocampus. RESULTS: Resveratrol significantly alleviated depressive-like behaviors induced by CUMS. Proteomic analysis revealed that resveratrol's therapeutic effects are associated with neuroplasticity-related and metabolic pathways, particularly with differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) predominantly localized in the mitochondria. Gene Ontology analysis of mitochondrial DEPs further revealed substantial changes in mitochondrial organization. Furthermore, molecular biology experiments validated these proteomics findings. Additionally, resveratrol also reversed the CUMS-induced downregulation of Tas2r123 mRNA and protein expression. Moreover, IF colocalization demonstrated a strong association between Tas2r123 and mitochondria. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that resveratrol may exert antidepressant property by modulating neuroplasticity through the Tas2r123-mitochondrial organization pathway. This study introduces a novel perspective linking Tas2rs to resveratrol's antidepressant mechanisms, potentially pave the way for future antidepressant therapies.",

      "abstract": "Chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) affects chicken immune system and welfare, causing huge losses of growth performance and welfare. Resveratrol (RSV), an antioxidant and anti-inflammatory natural plant polyphenol, is widely used for the prevention of stress related disease. The aim of this study is to explore the therapeutic effect of RSV on spleen damage in CUMS. We successfully constructed a CUMS model. A total of 288 healthy one-day-old chicks were used in this study and were divided in 3 groups, control, CUMS and CUMS+RSV group. During 42 days of age, spleen tissue samples were collected and analyzed. Transmission electron microscope (TEM), Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining, immunofluorescence, qRT- PCR, Western blots, immunohistochemical staining and RNA- sequencing (RNA-seq) technology was used to determine any changes and analyzed the mRNA and enrichment pathways. Histopathology and ultrastructure showed there was a severe damage of tissues. The results of RNA-seq showed that a total of 206, 267 and 211 DEGs were identified (log2 Fold Change| >1, P < 0.05) in control -vs- CUMS group, CUMS -vs- CUMS+RSV group and control -vs- CUMS+RSV group, respectively. Through Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis of the SDEGs, two immune/stress- related pathways including PPAR signaling pathway and neuroactive ligand receptor interaction were selected. The genes related to PPAR signaling pathway identified were PLIN1, MMP1, ANGPTL4 and FABP4 and Neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction genes were GRPR, NTSR1, KNG1 and AGT. The PLIN1, MMP1, ANGPTL4, FABP4, GRPR, KNG1 and AGT were up regulated and NTSR1 was down regulated in CUMS group. When compared to CUMS -vs- CUMS+RSV group, PLIN1, FABP4, KNG1 and AGT were down regulated genes and NTSR1 was up regulated gene. Taken together, KEGG pathway analyses of DEGs, verified by qRT-PCR and Western blots, the current study suggested that these data reveal the promising role of RSV in the prevention and therapy of a wide variety of tissue damage and PPAR signaling pathway, neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction in chronic unpredictable mild stress.",

      "abstract": "4-tert-octylphenol (4-t-OP) is an alkylphenolic environmental endocrine disruptor extensively distributed in the environment, posing potential hazards to living organisms. Research has demonstrated that 4-t-OP induces cardiac injury and abnormalities in embryonic development, which can adversely affect heart development. The excessive production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) triggered by 4-t-OP may result in DNA damage. Hence, we hypothesized that ROS-mediated DNA damage plays a crucial role in abnormal cardiac development in zebrafish embryos exposed to 4-t-OP, while resveratrol (RSV), a common antioxidant found in natural foods, may provide protection. In this study, we exposed zebrafish embryos at 2 h post-fertilization (hpf) to various doses of 4-t-OP in combination with relevant inhibitor/agonist therapies. Using microscopy, we observed morphological alterations in the cardiac structure of zebrafish embryos at 72 hpf. The underlying molecular mechanisms were assessed through immunofluorescence, DCFH-DA probe, MitoSOX™ staining, Quantitative polymerase chain reaction, and other methods. Our findings revealed that 4-t-OP caused dose-dependent cardiac defects in zebrafish embryos. The overexpression of ROS/mitochondrial ROS (mtROS) induced by 4-t-OP was significantly reduced by the addition of RSV or the ROS inhibitor N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC). Furthermore, the inclusion of RSV or NAC significantly mitigated cardiac deformities, cardiac apoptosis, and DNA damage. Additionally, the apoptosis inhibitor Ac-DEVD-CHO and the Wnt/β-catenin agonist CHIR99021 decreased 4-t-OP-induced cardiac abnormalities. Moreover, the naturally occurring small molecule chemical RSV provided protection against 4-t-OP-induced heart developmental injury. This study elucidates the molecular mechanisms by which 4-t-OP induces oxidative stress, DNA damage, and cardiac defects in the heart of zebrafish larvae through the ROS/Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. These findings present novel molecular targets for the prevention and therapy of congenital heart disease, as well as enhance our understanding of the cardiotoxic effects of 4-t-OP.",

New and effective treatment strategies are needed to improve outcomes for patients with prostate cancer. This study examined if resveratrol, a natural substance, could improve prostate cancer cell lines' response to flutamide, a standard antiandrogenic treatment for untreated prostate cancer, while minimizing adverse effects. METHOD: MTT assay was used to quantify resveratrol and flutamide IC50 values, Annexin-V/PI staining for apoptosis, PI staining for DNA cell cycle, and real-time PCR for BAX, BCL-2, VEGFC, HIF-1α, Snail1, E-Cadherin, and KLK3 mRNA levels Scratch-wound, colony-forming, and Hoechst staining analyzed cell migration, proliferation, and nucleus morphology. Spheroid creation in 3D was also considered. All tests used LNCaP, DU145, and PC3 prostate cancer cell lines at various stages. RESULTS: Resveratrol, when combined with flutamide, can reduce malignant cell migration, colony formation, and proliferation and promote apoptosis in prostate cancer cell lines. Even in androgen-unresponsive cell lines (DU145 and PC3), it may benefit flutamide prostate cancer treatment. Apoptosis genes (BAX) were upregulated in LNCaP, DU145, and PC3 cancer cell lines when administered alone or with flutamide. Additionally, flutamide might significantly lower BCL-2 levels in PC3 cells. When combined with flutamide, resveratrol increased apoptosis and altered the expression of genes involved in angiogenesis (VEGFC), epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT, Snail1 and E-Cadherin), and prostate cancer biomarker (KLK3) in prostate cancer cell lines. CONCLUSION: Resveratrol reduced the dose of flutamide in the treatment of prostate cancer cell lines (LNCaP, DU145, and PC3) and improved its side effects, as well as increasing the sensitivity of cells to flutamide treatment.",

METHODS: The study involved treating C2C12 cells with metformin and resveratrol, either alone or in combination, and analyzing their effects on myogenesis and irisin release. The activation of signaling pathways, including AMPK/SIRT1/PGC1α, as well as the relative mRNA and protein expression levels of MyoD, myogenin, and Myh were also assessed. RESULTS: Combination treatment with metformin and resveratrol significantly increased MyoD, myogenin, Myh, and FNDC5 expression compared with the group treated with metformin alone. The increase in irisin production was associated with phosphorylation of AMPK and upregulation of PGC-1α and SIRT1, indicating activation of the AMPK/SIRT1/PGC-1α pathway. The mRNA and protein expression levels of MyoD, myogenin, and Myh were also significantly higher in the combination treatment group compared to the metformin alone group. CONCLUSION: The combination of metformin and resveratrol effectively increased irisin release through the AMPK/Sirt1/PGC-1α pathway, suggesting that this combination treatment could enhance myogenesis.",

      "abstract": "Resveratrol (RSV) improves metabolic functions, but its tissue-specific effects on diabetes remain unclear. This study investigated RSV's impact on molecular pathways in an experimental model of diabetes in cardiac and skeletal muscles and adipose tissue. Wistar rats were assigned to control (C), control treated with RSV (RC), diabetic (D), and diabetic treated with RSV (RD). Diabetes was induced using streptozotocin and nicotinamide, and RSV was administered for six weeks. In diabetic rats, RSV treatment significantly reduced collagen accumulation in cardiac and skeletal muscle tissues compared to untreated diabetic controls, although it did not restore muscle mass. Adipose tissue in diabetic rats exhibited a significant reduction of 3.4 times in collagen levels following RSV treatment. However, this reduction was not associated with any measurable improvement in tissue function. In cardiac tissue, RSV downregulated phosphorylated protein kinase B (AKT)/AKT and phosphorylated ribosomal protein S6 (rpS6)/rpS6 while mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) activity remained unchanged. In skeletal muscle, RSV suppressed rpS6 phosphorylation without affecting (mTOR) signaling. RSV enhanced mTOR and Beclin-1 expression in adipose tissue, though metabolic dysfunction persisted. RSV reduced receptors for advanced glycation end-product expression in all tissues, indicating the modulation of hyperglycemia-driven pathways. RSV improved fibrosis and signaling pathways but failed to reverse abnormal tissue growth patterns, including cardiac hypertrophy, skeletal muscle atrophy, and adipose tissue atrophy.",

      "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder primarily characterized by the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. Mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and neuroinflammation are recognized as critical pathological mechanisms driving neurodegeneration in PD. Exosome (Exo)-based therapies, particularly those derived from human neural stem cells (hNSCs), offer promising neuroprotective effects due to their ability to transfer bioactive molecules that modulate cellular processes. Resveratrol (RES), a polyphenolic compound with potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, has been shown to enhance the therapeutic potential of stem cell (SC)-derived Exos. This study investigated the neuroprotective effects of RES-treated hNSCs-derived Exos (RES-hNSCs-Exos) on SH-SY5Y cells exposed to 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+), a neurotoxin commonly used to model Parkinsonian neurotoxicity. Treating SH-SY5Y cells with MPP+ led to significant reductions in cell viability, mitochondrial dysfunction, increased oxidative stress, and the activation of inflammatory pathways. Treatment with RES-hNSCs-Exos rescued SH-SY5Y cells from MPP+-induced toxicity by improving cell viability, enhancing ATP production, increasing mitochondrial biogenesis, and reducing reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. The findings also demonstrated the increased expression of essential genes involved in mitochondrial biogenesis, such as PGC1α, NRF1, and Tfam, indicating improved mitochondrial function in the presence of RES-hNSCs-Exos. Further analysis revealed that these protective effects were mediated by activating the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and Nrf2 signaling pathways, which promoted mitochondrial health and reduced oxidative stress. Moreover, RES-hNSCs-Exos treatment suppressed neuroinflammation by downregulating NLRP3 inflammasome activation and reducing the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1β and IL-18. In conclusion, the results suggest that RES-hNSCs-Exos exhibit potent neuroprotective effects against MPP+-induced neurotoxicity by enhancing mitochondrial function, reducing oxidative stress, and inhibiting neuroinflammation. These findings highlight the potential of hNSCs-Exos as a novel therapeutic strategy for neurodegenerative diseases like PD, with RES as a valuable enhancer of Exos efficacy."

Induced and inherited mouse models of retinal degeneration are valuable tools for investigating disease mechanisms and developing therapeutic interventions. This study investigated the potential of the antioxidant resveratrol to relieve photoreceptor degeneration using mouse models. Clinical studies have shown a potential association between thyroid hormone (TH) signaling and age-related retinal degeneration. Excessive TH signaling induces oxidative stress/damage and photoreceptor death in mice. C57BL/6 (rod-dominant) and Nrl-/- (cone-dominant) mice at postnatal day 30 (P30) received triiodothyronine (T3) via drinking water (20 µg/mL) with or without concomitant treatment with resveratrol via drinking water (120 µg/mL) for 30 days, followed by evaluation of photoreceptor degeneration, oxidative damage, and retinal stress responses. In experiments using Leber congenital amaurosis model mice, mother Rpe65-/- and Rpe65-/-/Nrl-/- mice received resveratrol via drinking water (120 µg/mL) for 20 days and 10-13 days, respectively, beginning on the day when the pups were at P5, and pups were then evaluated for cone degeneration. Treatment with resveratrol significantly diminished the photoreceptor degeneration induced by T3 and preserved photoreceptors in Rpe65-deficient mice, manifested as preserved retinal morphology/outer nuclear layer thickness, increased cone density, reduced photoreceptor oxidative stress/damage and apoptosis, reduced upregulation of genes involved in cell death/inflammatory responses, and reduced macroglial cell activation. These findings demonstrate the role of oxidative stress in photoreceptor degeneration, associated with TH signaling and Rpe65 deficiency, and support the therapeutic potential of resveratrol/antioxidants in the management of retinal degeneration."

      "abstract": "The ErbB2 signaling pathway plays a crucial role in cancer stem cells (CSCs), governing cancer aggressiveness and proliferation. Targeting ErbB2 holds promise for advancing cancer therapeutics. Resveratrol (RES) and its derivatives have been noted for their ability to target proteins that are involved in CSCs. In this investigation, we synthesize novel derivatives of RES, aim at elucidating structure-activity relationships (SARs) that could enhance the anticancer properties of the RES analogues, and explore their capacities to suppress CSCs. YI-12, an O-benzyl-substituted 1,3-diphenylpropane, demonstrated the most potent anticancer activity against lung cancer cells (A549 and H460), showing high potential inhibiting cancer colony formation. Interestingly, not only does YI-12 suppress CSCs-related proteins, indicated by decreased expression of CSC-enhancing molecules such as CD133-, OCT4-, and CSC-related protein β-catenin, but it also induces apoptosis in CSC-rich spheroids after treatment. Additionally, molecular docking and bioinformatic analysis suggest ErbB2 as a potential target of the compound with a strong binding affinity (-6.709 kcal/mol) compared to the reference compound TAK-285 (-5.563 kcal/mol). YI-12's capability to bind and inhibit ErbB2 leads to the suppression of PI3K and AKT. In conclusion, we highlight the novel resveratrol derivative YI-12 for its ability to inhibit CSCs through the ErbB2 signaling pathway. This compound represents a promising structure that should be further developed for potential use in anticancer therapy.",

Thirty 2-month-old male SD rats were randomly divided into normal group (Control), hindlimb unloading model group (Model), and hindlimb unloading+resveratrol administration group (Model+Res). The Model + Res group was injected intraperitoneally with 30 mg/kg of resveratrol, and the Control and Model groups were injected intraperitoneally with an equal volume of 0.9% NaCl. Liver tissues were collected after 28 days and analyzed for oxidative stress, inflammatory factors, energy metabolism indices, Na +-K +-ATPase and Ca 2+-Mg 2+-ATPase activity, and morphological changes were observed by hematoxylin-eosin staining. The protein expression levels of Bax, Bcl-2, p-PI3K, PI3K, p-AKT, and AKT were detected by Western blotting. Compared with the Control group, hepatocytes in the Model group showed swelling, abnormal morphology, nuclear consolidation, and cell membrane disruption. Oxidative stress, inflammatory factor levels, hepatic glycogen accumulation, and energy metabolism were increased in the liver tissues of the Model group, while resveratrol treatment significantly reversed these changes. The results of Western blotting showed that resveratrol significantly reduced the expression of Bax and increased the expression levels of Bcl-2, and the proteins of p-PI3K/PI3K and p-AKT/AKT expression levels. It is suggested that 28 days of hindlimb unloading treatment could lead to liver tissue injury in rats, which is manifested as oxidative stress, inflammatory response, energy metabolism disorder and increased apoptosis level, and resveratrol has a certain mitigating effect on this.",

However, the effect of resveratrol on chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) still lacks systematic research. This study aims to elucidate the potential mechanism of resveratrol against CRS disease through network pharmacology and further verify it through biological experiments in human nasal epithelial cells (HNEpCs). The potential targets and pathways of RES against CRS disease were predicted by network pharmacology and molecular docking. Furthermore, the inflammation of HNEpCs was induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The method of ELISA was used to detect changes in inflammatory factors and oxidative stress-related factors. The RT-qPCR method was adopted to analyze the changes of genes in related signaling pathways. As a result, 33 potential targets related to the effect of RES against CRS disease were obtained. According to the results of network pharmacology, it was shown that the effect of RES against CRS disease was closely related to the inflammation, oxidative stress, and apoptosis. A variety of results from cell experiments verified that RES can effectively inhibit the inflammation, oxidative stress and apoptosis of LPS-induced HNEpCs. Together, the present study systematically clarified the possible mechanisms of RES in the treatment of CRS and provided new ideas for the drug research of this disease.",

The current study aimed to investigate the probable beneficial role of RES on male reproduction in adult rats following prepubertal exposure to perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA). Healthy rats of the Wistar strain (23 days old) were allocated into four groups. Rats in group I did not receive any treatment, while rats in groups II, III, and IV received RES, PFOA, and RES + PFOA, respectively, between days 23 and 56 and were monitored for up to 90 days. Exposure to PFOA resulted in a significant reduction in spermiogram parameters, testicular 3β- and 17β-HSD activity levels, and circulatory levels of testosterone. A significant elevation in LPx, PCs, H2O2, and O2-, associated with a concomitant reduction in SOD, CAT, GPx, GR, and GSH, was noticed in the testes, as well as region-specific changes in pro- and antioxidants in the epididymides of exposed rats compared to controls. A significant increase in serum FSH and LH, testicular cholesterol levels, and caspase-3 activity was observed in PFOA-exposed rats compared to controls. Histological analysis revealed that the integrity of the testes was deteriorated in PFOA-exposed rats. Transcriptomic profiling of the testes and epididymides revealed 98 and 611 altered genes, respectively. In the testes, apoptosis and glutathione pathways were disrupted, while in the epididymides, glutathione and bile secretion pathways were altered in PFOA-exposed rats. PFOA exposure resulted in the down-regulation in the testes of 17β-HSD, StAR, nfe2l2, ar, Lhcgr, and mRNA levels, associated with the up-regulation of casp3 mRNA, and down-regulation of alpha 1 adrenoceptor, muscarinic choline receptor 3, and androgen receptor in the epididymides of exposed rats compared to the controls. These events might lead to male infertility in PFOA-exposed rats. In contrast, restoration of selected reproductive variables was observed in RES plus PFOA-exposed rats compared to rats exposed to PFOA alone. Taken together, we postulate that prepubertal exposure to PFOA triggered oxidative damage and altered genes in the testes and epididymides, leading to suppressed male reproductive health in adult rats, while RES, with its steroidogenic, antiapoptotic, and antioxidant effects, restored PFOA-induced fertility potential in rats."

Resveratrol, a stilbenoid produced by several plants including peanuts and grapes, reportedly exerts anticancer effects and can activate immune cells. The peanut sprout extract cultivated with fermented sawdust medium (PSEFS) is rich in resveratrol, leveraging its health benefits in terms of the dry weight of herbal products, thus maximizing the utilization of resveratrol's beneficial properties. Our study compared the efficacy of resveratrol and PSEFS and revealed that PSEFS significantly enhanced NK cell activation compared with an equivalent dose of resveratrol. We investigated the ability of PSEFS to potentiate NK cell anticancer activity, focusing on NK cell survival, tumor cell lysis, and NK cell activation in PSEFS-administered mice. Our findings suggest that PSEFS could be a potential NK cell booster for cancer immunotherapy."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Obesity, a progressively widespread disease with a multifaceted etiology, affects nearly 800 million people worldwide. Recent trials suggest that resveratrol, a polyphenolic compound, can be effective for metabolic risk markers and anthropometric parameters in Individuals with Obesity or Overweight. However, a comprehensive analysis is necessary to consolidate these results. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the impact of 4-week resveratrol supplementation on metabolic risk markers and anthropometric parameters in individuals with obesity or overweight. METHODS: A comprehensive search was executed across PubMed, Cochrane Library, Scopus, Google Scholar, and clinicaltrials.gov, yielding 43 studies after the omission of 20 duplicates. RevMan 5.4 software was used to statistically analyze randomized controlled studies to gauge the impact of resveratrol on the said outcomes in Individuals with Obesity or Overweight. Quality of bias and potential publication bias were measured using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool and CMA4 software, respectively. Certainty of the evidence was appraised using GRADEpro software. Data was quantified as the standardized mean difference (SMD) and 95 % confidence intervals (CI). RESULTS: The meta-analysis included 5 trials with 419 participants, evaluating the effect of intervention. Resveratrol showed no significant impact on triglycerides (SMD = 0.11, 95%CI [-0.14, 0.35], P = 0.39, I2 = 0 %), total cholesterol (SMD = 0.04, 95%CI [-0.26, 0.33], P = 0.82, I2 = 0 %), or HbA1c (SMD = 0.00, 95%CI [-0.99, 1.00], P = 0.99, I2 = 80 %). Similarly, no significant effect was observed for insulin levels (SMD = -0.00, 95%CI [-0.25, 0.24], P = 0.97, I2 = 0 %), AST (SMD = 0.15, 95%CI [-0.35, 0.65], P = 0.55, I2 = 0 %), or ALT (SMD = -0.03, 95%CI [-0.46, 0.39], P = 0.98, I2 = 0 %). Additionally, resveratrol had no significant effect on BMI (MD = 0.21, 95%CI [-0.970, 1.39], P = 0.70, I2 = 0 %). CONCLUSIONS: Our results tagged with p-value>0.05 are an evidence-based indication that resveratrol supplementation does not lead to significant improvements in metabolic or anthropometric parameters. This suggests that resveratrol may not be an effective standalone intervention for managing obesity-related outcomes. Therefore, future research should be redirected to evaluating its potential effects on other health metrics to elucidate its efficacy and therapeutic potential better."

Resveratrol has demonstrated beneficial effects in the prevention and treatment of depression. However, it remains unknown whether resveratrol administration can counteract depression-like behaviors by regulating the SIRT1/NF-κB signaling pathway. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Male C57BL/6 mice were randomly assigned to a control group, a depression group, and a resveratrol group. The depression model was established using chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) for 5 weeks. Behavioral tests were conducted to assess depressive-like behaviors. The expression levels of SIRT1 and NF-κB in the hippocampus of mice and BV2 microglial cells were measured. After 5 weeks of modeling, the results indicated that mice in the depression group exhibited significant depressive-like behaviors and inhibited activation of the SIRT1/NF-κB signaling pathway. In contrast, resveratrol administration effectively reversed these changes. Results from in vitro experiments showed that LPS stimulation increased microglial activity and downregulated the SIRT1/NF-κB signaling pathway in microglia; however, resveratrol treatment mitigated these effects. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our findings suggested that resveratrol can alleviate CUMS-induced depression-like behaviors via the activation of the Sirt1/NF-κB pathway in microglia."

      "abstract": "This study investigated the effect of resveratrol (RV) after thawing of ram sperm cryopreserved with or without the addition of antifreeze protein I (AFPI) on sperm quality during the 3 h incubation period. Each ram ejaculate was split into two aliquots, diluted in a TRIS egg yolk (TEY) extender supplemented with 0 (control) or 0.1 µg/mL AFPI, and then cooled and frozen. Thawed samples of both treatments were subdivided and incubated in Talp-Hepes medium with 0 (TEY and AFPI group) or 50 µM of RV (TEY + RV group and AFPI + RV group) for 3 h at 38 ºC. The sperm kinetics, capacitation status, plasma membrane integrity, mitochondrial activity, sperm-egg binding assay, and TBARS concentrations were evaluated at different intervals. Data were analyzed by mixed model, including the incubation time, AFP treatment, RV treatment, and their interactions as main effects, and the day of semen collection and the ram as random effects (P < 0.05; LS mean ± pooled SEM). The AFPI, RV treatments, and their interaction did not affect the average total motility (~ 17.1 ± 2.4%), progressive motility (~ 5.6 ± 1.4%), mitochondrial activity (~ 35.5 ± 2.3 arbitrary unit), plasma membrane integrity (~ 18.2 ± 2.4%), sperm binding capacity (~ 2.2 ± 0.1 sperm per mm2), TBARS concentrations (~ 1488.7 ± 27.4 ng/mL) and rates of capacitated (~ 27.5 ± 1.6%), non-capacitated (~ 20.9 ± 1.6%) and acrosome-reacted (~ 56.5 ± 4.1%) sperm. It was concluded that adding 0.1 µg/mL AFPI to the extender used for ram semen cryopreservation and/or further in vitro culture exposure to 50 µM RV did not improve in vitro sperm quality.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUNDS: Natural killer (NK) cell mediated cytotoxicity is a crucial form of anti-cancer immune response. Natural killer group 2 member D (NKG2D) is a prominent activating receptor of NK cell. UL16-binding protein 2 (ULBP2), always expressed or elevated on cancer cells, functions as a key NKG2D ligand. ULBP2-NKG2D ligation initiates NK cell activation and subsequent targeted elimination of cancer cells. Enhanced expression of ULBP2 on cancer cells leads to more efficient elimination of these cells by NK cells. Resveratrol (RES) is known for its multiple health benefits, while current understanding of its role in regulating cancer immunogenicity remains limited. This study aims to investigate how RES affects the expression of ULBP2 and the sensitivity of breast cancer (BC) cells to NK cell cytotoxicity, along with the underlying mechanisms. METHODS: The effects of RES on ULBP2 expression were detected with qRT-PCR, western blot, flow cytometry analysis and immunohistochemistry. The effects of RES on sensitivity of BC cells to NK cell cytotoxicity were evaluated in vitro and in vivo. The target gene of miR-17-5p were predicted with different algorithms from five databases and further confirmed with dual-luciferase reporter assay. Overexpression and knockdown experiments of miR-17-5p and MINK1 were conducted to investigate their roles in regulating ULBP2 expression and subsequent JNK/c-Jun activation. The JNK inhibitor sp600125 was utilized to elucidate the specific role of JNK in modulating ULBP2 expression. RESULTS: RES increased ULBP2 expression on BC cells, thereby augmenting their vulnerability to NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity both in vitro and in vivo. RES administration led to a reduction in cellular miR-17-5p level. MiR-17-5p negatively regulated ULBP2 expression. Specifically, miR-17-5p directly targeted MINK1, leading to its suppression. MINK1 played a role in facilitating the activation of JNK and its downstream effector, c-Jun. Furthermore, treatment with sp600125, a JNK inhibitor, resulted in the suppression of ULBP2 expression. CONCLUSIONS：: RES potentiates ULBP2-mediated immune eradication of BC cells by NK cells through the downregulation of miR-17-5p and concurrent activation of the MINK1/JNK/c-Jun cascade. This finding identifies RES as a potentially effective therapeutic agent for inhibiting BC progression and optimizing NK cell-based cancer immunotherapy.",

      "abstract": "Gastric ulcers affect 4 million people worldwide and occur when the stomach's defenses are compromised, allowing harmful agents, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and Helicobacter pylori, to damage the tissue. The naturally occurring polyphenol, trans-resveratrol (RESV), demonstrates promising potential for treating gastric diseases. However, its therapeutic application is limited by its photosensitivity and solubility. To overcome these challenges, RESV was encapsulated in a new nano-in-microparticle system comprised of chitosan nanoparticles incorporated into hyaluronic acid and alginate microparticles (RESV-MNP). RESV-MNP exhibited spherical morphology (~2 μm) and encapsulation efficiency of 79 %, releasing about 41 % of RESV within 24 h, showing a prolonged release profile compared to the free drug. Additionally, RESV-MNP interacted with porcine mucin in an acid environment. RESV-MNP showed no toxicity against AGS/MKN-74 cell lines in vitro and in acute toxicity tests using Galleria mellonella and hemolysis. RESV-MNP presented a minimum inhibitory and bactericidal concentration (MIC/MBC) of 3.9 μg/mL, eradicating H. pylori after 24 h. At 2×MIC, RESV-MNP completely eradicated H. pylori biofilm. In an in vitro infection assay, RESV-MNP reduced H. pylori load. The formulation effectively reduced the mortality rate of H. pylori-infected larvae in the G. mellonella model. Furthermore, RESV-MNP demonstrated gastroprotective effects, reducing the extent and severity of indomethacin-gastric lesions in rats.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Radiation-induced damage to the hematopoietic and gastrointestinal systems, especially the intestine, is a major concern for individuals exposed to whole-body radiation during an accident. Resveratrol has shown potential in mitigating radiation-induced toxicity, but its efficacy may be limited by its low bioavailability. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of resveratrol-loaded polymeric-based nanocapsules in mitigating radiation-induced injury in the hematopoietic system and intestine after whole-body exposure to radiation. METHODS: Sixty male mice were randomly divided into four groups: control, radiation (single dose of 7.2 Gy of X-ray) only, resveratrol-loaded polymeric-based nanocapsules (RES-ACN) only, and radiation plus RES-ACN. Mice were exposed to a single dose of 7.2 Gy of X-ray radiation. RES-ACN was administered to the mice starting 24h after irradiation up to day 7 post-irradiation. Then, blood and tissue samples were collected for complete blood count and histopathological and biochemical evaluation. Survival analyses were also conducted. RESULTS: The findings showed that RES-ACN significantly mitigated radiation-induced injury to the hematopoietic system and intestine. The histopathological evaluation showed the mitigation of villi shortening, inflammation, and mucous layer thickness following treatment with RES-ACN. Biochemical evaluation also demonstrated a significant increase in the activity of glutathione peroxidase and superoxide dismutase and a significant reduction in the concentrations of malondialdehyde and nitric oxide. Treatment with RES-ACN also showed a significant improvement in some of the blood parameters and increased survival compared to radiation only. CONCLUSION: The findings suggest that resveratrol-loaded polymeric-based nanocapsules can be an effective approach to mitigate radiation-induced damage to the hematopoietic system and intestine after whole-body exposure to X-ray radiation in mice. Further research is needed to explore the optimal dose and timing of resveratrol administration and to investigate the potential for clinical translation of this approach."

In total, 12 male normal birth weight (NBW) newborn piglets and 24 male IUGR newborn piglets were selected. They were weaned at 26 days of age and then divided into three treatments in a three-week trial: (1) NBW piglets fed a basal diet; (2) IUGR piglets fed a basal diet; (3) IUGR piglets fed a basal diet supplemented with 300 mg/kg RSV. Compared with NBW piglets, IUGR piglets showed decreased growth performance, altered redox status, impaired jejunal morphology, tight junction protein expression, energy production, and mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. RSV enhanced antioxidant defense capacity and improved jejunal morphology, ATP generation, and mitochondrial complex I content in IUGR weaned piglets. Dietary RSV supplementation alleviated the IUGR-induced jejunal injury in weaned piglets probably by improving redox status and mitochondrial function, suggesting that RSV has the potential to be a dietary intervention in the regulation of intestinal injury in IUGR piglets."

      "abstract": "Resveratrol, a plant-derived polyphenol, exhibits significant antidepressant effects and notably enhances neuroplasticity in neurological diseases. However, whether the antidepressant function of resveratrol is related to neuroplasticity remains uncertain, and the underlying mechanisms is poorly understood. This study aims to investigate the role and mechanism of resveratrol in neuroplasticity in depression. Here, we adopted the chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) model and resveratrol intervention by oral gavage. Thereafter, behavioral tests confirmed resveratrol's antidepressant effect, and Nissl staining, Golgi staining, and Western blotting (WB) were employed to assess the neuronal plasticity. Moreover, proteomic analysis and WB were used to screen and identify the key proteins. To investigate the downstream target of ELAV-like RNA-binding protein 4 (ELAVL4) (one of candidate genes), the RNA Interactome Database and the National Center for Biotechnology Information databases were utilized to predict the targets of ELAVL4. Finally, Quantitative PCR, WB, and Immunofluorescence were used to verify the prediction. Our results indicate that resveratrol alleviates CUMS-induced depressive-like behaviors accompanied by the restoration of impaired hippocampal neuroplasticity. Then, proteomic analysis shows that 351 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) decrease after CUMS, while 24 DEPs increase remarkably with the resveratrol treatment. Among which, ELAVL4 is downregulated by CUMS, simultaneously increasing after resveratrol intervention, which acts as a protective protein in this process. Finally, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (Bdnf) mRNA is predicted to be the potential target of ELAVL4 and validated by molecular technologies. In conclusion, our findings demonstrate that resveratrol's antidepressant efficacy is closely associated with ELAVL4, an RNA-binding protein, a mediated neuroplasticity pathway, potentially intersecting with the Bdnf mRNA. Overall, this research sheds light on the role of the ELAVL4-Bdnf mRNA pathway through neuroplasticity in resveratrol's antidepressant action, which provides an mRNA regulation perspective for the development of novel antidepressants and understanding depression pathology.",

This study aimed to evaluate the effect of RES supplementation on oxidative stress in patients with head and neck cancer (HNC) receiving home enteral nutrition (HEN). Methods: This randomized, single-center, open-label study involved 72 adult patients, with 40 completing the intervention. Participants in the intervention group received 400 mg of liposomal RES daily for 12 weeks alongside HEN, while the control group received HEN only. Body composition and oxidative stress markers-including total antioxidant capacity (TAC), malondialdehyde (MDA), superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and reduced glutathione (GSH)-were measured at baseline and after 12 weeks. Results: Significant increases in TAC and SOD activity were observed in both groups. GPx activity increased significantly only in the RES group. MDA levels rose in both groups but were more pronounced in the RES group. GSH levels showed no significant changes. Phase angle (PhA) increased significantly in the RES group, while no significant change was observed in the control group. Conclusions: RES supplementation may enhance antioxidant defenses, as evidenced by increased GPx activity and improvements in TAC and SOD levels, supporting oxidative balance in patients with HNC receiving HEN. The higher MDA levels in the RES group may reflect RES's dual antioxidant and pro-oxidant activities. Additionally, the observed increase in PhA suggests potential cellular health benefits. These findings highlight the potential of RES as a complementary antioxidant intervention in clinical oncology, warranting further investigation to clarify its therapeutic effects on oxidative stress and cellular health in cancer care.",

These could be beneficial in controlling potential side effects of orthodontic treatment, such as apical root resorption. Orthodontic tooth movement occurs as part of a sterile inflammatory response. However, dysregulation of this process can result in pathologically increased osteoclast activity in the radicular vicinity, leading to unwanted root resorption. Previous studies have shown that root cementum cells can modulate recruitment of osteoclast precursors and cementum repair. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We investigated the effect of resveratrol on mechanically stimulated murine cementoblasts (OCCM-30) with regards to cell viability, and mRNA expression and protein levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Furthermore, the modulation of central related kinases was investigated. RESULTS: Resveratrol increased viability of OCCM-30 in a time- and dose-dependent manner and significantly reduced upregulation of pERK and pAKT, upstream regulators of key cellular metabolic pathways. Furthermore, we describe for the first time that cementoblasts respond to compression with accelerated activation of STAT3 and increased translocation of NF-κB p65 into the nucleus. CONCLUSION: This study shows a regulation of pAKT and pERK by resveratrol in OCCM-30 cells without a negative effect on cell viability. Therefore, resveratrol may have the potential to modulate the periodontal response to mechanical stimulation.",

METHODS: This study included 50 dogs, 30 diagnosed with CVL and 20 healthy controls. Dogs were classified based on their treatment regime (receiving resveratrol [200 mg/dog/d] and/or allopurinol [10 mg/kg/d]). Clinical scores, anti-leishmanial antibody titers, and routine blood parameters were evaluated on days 0, 15, and 30 after treatment. RESULTS: Dogs treated with the combination therapy showed the most substantial improvements, with a 75.77% reduction in clinical scores and an 81.25% reduction in antibody titers. Dogs receiving allopurinol exhibited a 56.25% reduction in clinical scores, while those treated with resveratrol showed a 42.82% reduction. Antibody titers were less significantly reduced in the resveratrol group (67.5%) compared to the allopurinol group (45%). CONCLUSIONS: Combining resveratrol with allopurinol enhances the therapeutic efficacy for CVL, leading to significant clinical improvements and reductions in antibody titers. Resveratrol alone also demonstrates promising anti-leishmanial effects. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Resveratrol, either alone or in combination with allopurinol, offers a feasible and effective alternative for improving clinical outcomes in CVL. Its incorporation into standard protocols may enhance treatment strategies in veterinary medicine."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common chronic liver disorder which may progress from simple steatosis to liver failure. Patients with NAFLD have higher levels of systemic inflammation. Resveratrol, a natural polyphenolic compound, has been shown to have anti-inflammatory effects through various mechanisms. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of resveratrol supplementation on serum levels of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), adiponectin, fibroblast growth factor-21 (FGF-21) as well as high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) in patients with NAFLD. METHODS: In this double-blind randomized controlled trial, 50 adults with NAFLD aged 20-60 years were allocated into two groups; the intervention and the placebo group received two capsules per day each containing 300 mg resveratrol and placebo, respectively. Fasting blood samples and anthropometric measurements were collected for all patients at baseline and at the end of the trial. Cges in the outcomes were analyzed using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). RESULTS: After 12 weeks of intervention, resveratrol supplementation did not cause significant changes in serum levels of liver enzymes including alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) compared to the control group. No significant differences were observed in the serum levels of PAI-1, adiponectin, FGF-21, and hs-CRP between the two groups at the end of the study. CONCLUSIONS: Resveratrol supplementation for 12 weeks did not show favorable effects on serum levels of liver enzymes, PAI-1, adiponectin, FGF-21, and hs-CRP.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Our mechanistic understanding on metabolic beneficial effects of dietary polyphenols has been hampered for decades due to the lack of functional receptors for those compounds and their extremely low plasma concentrations. Recent studies by our team and others suggest that those dietary polyphenols target gut microbiome, and gut-liver axis and that hepatic fibroblast factor 21 (FGF21) serves as a common target for various dietary interventions. METHODS: Utilizing liver-specific FGF21 null mice (lFgf21-/-), we are asking a straightforward question: Is hepatic FGF21 required for curcumin or resveratrol, two typical dietary polyphenols, in exerting their metabolic beneficial effect in obesogenic diet-induced obesity mouse models. RESULTS: On low-fat diet feeding, no appreciable defect on glucose disposal was observed in male or female lFgf21-/- mice, while fat tolerance was moderately impaired in male but not in female lFgf21-/- mice, associated with elevated random and fasting serum triglyceride (TG) levels, and reduced hepatic expression of Ehhadh and Ppargc1a, which encodes the two downstream effectors of FGF21. On high-fat-high-fructose (HFHF) diet challenge, Fgf21fl/fl but not lFgf21-/- mice exhibited response to curcumin intervention on reducing fasting serum TG, and on improving fat tolerance. Resveratrol intervention also affected FGF21 expression or its downstream effectors. Metabolic beneficial effects of resveratrol intervention observed in HFHF diet-challenged Fgf21fl/fl mice were either absent or attenuated in lFgf21-/- mice. CONCLUSION AND SIGNIFICANCE: We conclude that hepatic FGF21 is required for curcumin or resveratrol in exerting their major metabolic beneficial effect. The recognition that FGF21 as the common target of dietary intervention, demonstrated in current as well as previous investigations, brings us a novel angle in understanding metabolic disease treatment and prevention. It remains to be further explored how various dietary interventions regulate FGF21 expression and function, via certain common or unique gut-liver or gut-brain-liver axis.",

      "abstract": "The role of inflammation and oxidative stress (OS) is significant in the progression and development of diabetic nephropathy (DN). Resveratrol (Res) has various pharmacological effects including anti-inflammatory and anti-OS. Tumor necrosis factor receptor-related factor (TRAF3) has been shown to have anti-inflammatory and anti-OS effects in a variety of diseases. This study investigated the potential mechanisms underlying the renoprotective effects of Res, with a special focus on the regulation of TRAF3 in the Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)-mediated nuclear factor kappaB (NF-κB) inflammatory signaling pathway. A high-fat diet combined with intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin (35 mg/kg) was used to induce type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in a rat model, and a high glucose (HG, 30 mmol/L)-treated glomerular thylakoid cell model was established in HBZY-1 rats. Res (40 mg/kg/day) was studied in vivo by gavage for 8 weeks and in vitro by treatment with Res (25, 50, and 100 μmol/L) for 48 hours. The degree of renal injury was evaluated by blood urea nitrogen (BUN), blood creatinine (Cr) and urine protein. Renal structure and glycogen changes were observed by hematoxylin and eosin and periodic acid Schiff staining (PAS). Inflammatory factors, including interleukin (IL)-1βt IL-6, monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP)-1, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), and oxidative stress markers, including superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and malondialdehyde (MDA), were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Immunoblotting was performed to detect TRAF3, TLR4, MyD88, phosphorylated (p)-IκBβ, p-p65, and p65. Protein blotting was applied for final mechanistic validation using lentiviral transfection of diabetes mellitus (DM) rats and high glucose-induced cells against TRAF3. As a result Res effectively ameliorated renal loss and renal histopathologic changes in DM rats, as evidenced by decreased BUN (P<0.01), Cr (P<0.01), urine protein (P<0.01), and renal structural lesions and reduced basement membrane glycogen (P<0.015). In terms of molecular mechanisms, Res was able to significantly promote the expression of TRAF3, which in turn inhibited the activation of the TLR4/NF-κB signaling pathway and reduced the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β, IL-6, MCP-1, and TNF-α (all P<0.01), thereby attenuating inflammatory responses in the kidney. In addition, Res significantly reduced OS in renal tissues and in the HG cell model, such as increasing SOD and CAT activities and decreasing MDA levels (all P<0.05). Silencing of TRAF3, on the other hand, partially reduced the anti-inflammatory and anti-OS effects of Res and activated the TLR4-mediated NF-κB signaling pathway. To sum up Res can alleviate DN by attenuating inflammation and OS, and the underlying mechanisms are related to TRAF3 in the TLR4/NF-κB-mediated anti-inflammatory pathway.",

This study presents an innovative core-shell carrier system via electrospray technology, characterized by a shell of poly(lactic acid-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) and a core consisting of polycaprolactone-polyethylene glycol (PCL-PEG) micelles encapsulating resveratrol (Res), and surface modified with fibronectin (FN). The created drug-loaded core-shell microspheres (for short, RPG@FN) with a size of 1.30 μm, are stable under physiological conditions and specifically target macrophages through the Arg-Gly-Asp peptide sequence of FN. We show that the RPG@FN microspheres can synergistically reduce inflammatory responses through ROS scavenging and macrophage M2 polarization, thus facilitating mitochondrial homeostasis restoration and modulating NF-κB and PI3K/Akt pathways by virtue of the integrated antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties of FN and Res. In an ALI mouse model, the developed RPG@FN significantly alleviates pulmonary edema and inflammatory cell infiltration, while repairing the inflammatory lung injury. This innovative RPG@FN system fully capitalizes on the therapeutic benefits of Res and FN with improved bioavailability, thus offering a promising option for effective ALI treatment.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Exposure to PM2.5 is associated with neurotoxicity and mitochondrial dysfunction. Resveratrol, a natural polyphenol, has demonstrated antioxidant and neuroprotective properties. Still, its efficacy in mitigating PM2.5-induced damage in human neural stem cells (hNSCs) and within a 3D scaffold system remains underexplored. OBJECTIVE: This study investigated the protective effects of resveratrol against PM2.5-induced damage in hNSCs and within a 3D scaffold system. METHODS: Assess cell viability using MTT and LIVE/DEAD assays and measure caspase activity by fluorescence analysis. Quantify gene and protein expression of key regulatory pathways using qPCR and Western blotting. Then, mitochondrial function was analyzed by measuring ATP production, mitochondrial mass, maximal respiratory rate, COX activity, membrane potential, TEM, and immunofluorescence staining. In addition, 3D scaffolds created by the CELLINK INKREDIBLE bioprinter were used to study the effect of resveratrol on PM2.5-induced hNSCs damage. RESULTS: Resveratrol significantly improved cell viability and reduced caspase-3 and caspase-9 activities in PM2.5-treated hNSCs. Resveratrol treatment upregulated TrKBR, PI3K, AKT, CREB, PPARα, PPARγ, SIRT1 and AMPK expression. It restored mitochondrial function by increasing ATP production, mitochondrial mass, maximal respiratory rate, COX activity, and membrane potential. Using a 3D scaffold demonstrated resveratrol's potential to maintain mitochondrial function and cellular health under PM2.5 exposure. CONCLUSION: Resveratrol can effectively reduce neurotoxicity and mitochondrial dysfunction caused by PM2.5 in hNSCs. Its protective effects against PM2.5-induced toxicity in hNSCs within a 3D bioprinted model highlight this study's translational potential. These findings emphasize its potential as a therapeutic agent against environmental neurotoxins and the development of neuroprotective strategies.",

Metabolism and transport of stilbenes can be conveniently investigated in grapevine cell culture since large amounts of trans-resveratrol are accumulated in the extracellular medium upon treatment with the elicitor methylated cyclodextrin, either alone or combined with methyl jasmonate. A proteomic approach on grapevine cell membrane fractions was performed to find trans-resveratrol transporter candidates. The candidate VvABCB15 was functionally characterized. Its stable expression in both yeast and Silybum marianum cells' heterologous systems led to increased trans-resveratrol transport in these hosts. Transient expression in Vitis cells showed an enhanced absorbent- or elicitor-assisted accumulation of extracellular trans-resveratrol in VvABCB15-expressing or VvGSTU10/VvABCB15-co-expressing cell suspension cultures. Experiments of transient expression in Vitis cell suspensions using light-switchable stilbene synthase (pHYH::VvSTS3) and VvABCB15 further confirmed the candidate's role as a trans-resveratrol transporter. VvABCB15-YFP fusion proteins in Nicotiana leaf showed localization in the plasma membrane, consistent with a functional role in trans-resveratrol transport. This is the first report to provide evidence for the involvement of an ABC transporter B type, VvABCB15, in trans-resveratrol transport to the extracellular medium of grapevine cells."

However, the primary challenge in gas therapy is the effective delivery of gas prodrug to targeted sites, as well as achieving precise spatial-temporal control over their release behavior. In this work, we provide a facile method to design ROS-responsive and mitochondrial targeting CO-delivery nanoplatform, based on the thiol-functionalized metal-organic framework (MOF), abbreviated as UiO-66-SH, incorporating the drug resveratrol (RES) for combined tumor therapy. After endocytosis by tumor cells and localization within the mitochondria, UiO@FeCO@RES was decomposed by ATP to release RES and generate CO gas via a Fenton-like reaction between hydroxyl radicals (·OH) and FeCO. RES acts as an ATPase inhibitor, disrupting the metabolism of the respiratory chain in tumor cell and thereby facilitating ATP-blocked metabolic therapy. In vitro experimental results demonstrate that the combination therapy, involving both RES drug and CO gas therapy, exhibits a synergistic effect against cancer cells. This synergistic strategy has endowed UiO@FeCO@RES as a promising material for biomedical applications."

This study aims to explore the impact of RES on muscle regeneration after injury through the regulation of antioxidant capacity and mitochondrial biogenesis. RES treatment significantly increased the ratio of tibialis anterior muscle mass to body weight, alongside reduced fasting glucose levels. Following cardiotoxin-induced injury, RES treatment improved muscle regeneration, characterized by greater formation of new fibers and better structural repair compared to the control. Notably, gene expression analyses demonstrated that RES-treated mice exhibited elevated levels of myogenic markers, such as paired box 7 (Pax7), myogenic factor 5 (Myf5), myoblast determination protein (MyoD), and Myogenin (MyoG). Concurrently, yes-associated protein (YAP) increased, underscoring its role in regulating satellite cell activity. Transcriptomic analysis identified enriched pathways related to muscle regeneration and mitochondrial biogenesis, with increased expression of mitochondrial transcription factors and higher mitochondrial DNA content in RES-treated mice. Furthermore, RES enhanced antioxidant capacity via the Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (KEAP-1)/nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2)/heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) signaling pathway, as indicated by elevated activities of total antioxidant capacity, Glutathione peroxidase (GSH-PX), and superoxidase dismutase (SOD). Collectively, these findings suggest that RES not only promotes muscle regeneration but also supports mitochondrial function and antioxidant defenses, positioning it as a food-derived pharmaceutical for targeting muscle repair after injury."

Their beneficial properties have been explored widely to treat various disorders. Phytochemicals like curcumin, catechin and resveratrol have been evaluated for their medicinal values and have promising potential in treating numerous diseases. In this study, we have elucidated the in vitro survival, proliferative and cytotoxic effects of these phytochemicals at selected range of concentrations on human umbilical cord derived Wharton's jelly mesenchymal stem cells (WJ-MSCs). METHODS: The human WJ-MSCs were extracted using explant culture method and characterized as per International Society for Cellular Therapy (ISCT) guidelines. To analyse the effect of different phytochemicals, the WJ-MSCs were treated with various concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 1000 µM and the viability, proliferative and toxicity effects were assayed using (3-(4,5-dimethylthioazolyl-2,5-diphenyltetrozolium bromide) MTT. RESULTS: Curcumin and catechin elicited no cytotoxic effect on WJ-MSCs after 48 hours of treatment between the concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 10 µM and the viability was maintained above 80 %. For both the phytochemicals, there was a significant decrease in the viability of WJ-MSCs after 50 µM. Resveratrol was well tolerated at higher doses till 100 µM with a viability above 90 % and cytotoxic effect was observed above 250 µM. CONCLUSION: Curcumin, catechin and resveratrol, affect the viability and proliferation of WJ-MSCs differently at varying concentrations. This data will be useful in deciding the dose of phytochemicals when employed concomitantly with stem cells to increase their efficiency.",

A meta-analysis was performed to assess the changes in levels of inflammation and oxidative stress in patients with T2DM. METHODS: Relevant literatures before November 6, 2024 were screened through Web of Science,Embase,the Cochrane Library and other sources (ClinicalTrials, ProQuest Dissertations and Theses). The quality of the literature was evaluated according to the Cochrane Handbook of Systematic Reviews. The study quality was assessed using the risk-of-bias 2 tool and the Grading of Recommendations Assessment,Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system. Review Manager 5.3 conducted meta-analysis of the data included in the literature. RESULTS: This meta-analysis was conducted in six randomized controlled trials involving 533 participants. Our results showed that supplementation with resveratrol significantly reduced C-reactive protein levels(SMD = -1.40, 95%CI(-2.60, -0.21), P = 0.02; Level of evidence: low), lipid peroxide levels (SMD = -0.99, 95%CI(-1.36, -0.61), P < 0.00001; Level of evidence: low), 8-isoprostanes(SMD = -0.79, 95%CI(-1.16, -0.42), P < 0.0001; Level of evidence: low) and oxidative stress score (SMD = -1.62, 95%CI(-2.49, -0.75), P = 0.0003; Level of evidence: very low).

However, no significant difference was observed in improving interleukin-6 levels (SMD = -1.35, 95%CI(-2.75, -0.05), P = 0.06; Level of evidence: very low), tumor necrosis factor α levels (SMD = -3.30, 95%CI(-7.47, 0.87), P = 0.12; Level of evidence: very low), superoxide dismutase levels (SMD = 0.39, 95%CI(-0.26, 1.04), P = 0.24; Level of evidence: very low), total antioxidant capacity levels (SMD = 0.39, 95%CI(-0.23, 1.00), P = 0.21; Level of evidence: very low) and malondialdehyde levels (SMD = -3.36, 95%CI(-10.30, 3.09), P = 0.29; Level of evidence: very low). CONCLUSION: Resveratrol improved inflammation and oxidative stress in T2DM patients to some extent. This provides a new idea and method for clinical treatment. However, due to the limitations of the study, more large-sample, multi-center clinical studies are needed to verify this conclusion.",

      "abstract": "Resveratrol, a polyphenolic compound known for its diverse biological activities, has demonstrated multiple pharmacological effects, including anti-inflammatory, anti-aging, anti-diabetic, anti-cancer, and cardiovascular protective properties. Recent studies suggest that these effects are partly mediated through the regulation of macrophage polarization, wherein macrophages differentiate into pro-inflammatory M1 or anti-inflammatory M2 phenotypes. Our review highlights how resveratrol modulates macrophage polarization through various signaling pathways to achieve therapeutic effects. For example, resveratrol can activate the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) pathway and inhibit the signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT3) and sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P)-YAP signaling axes, promoting M1 polarization or suppressing M2 polarization, thereby inhibiting tumor growth. Conversely, it can promote M2 polarization or suppress M1 polarization by inhibiting the NF-κB signaling pathway or activating the PI3K/Akt and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathways, thus alleviating inflammatory responses. Notably, the effect of resveratrol on macrophage polarization is concentration-dependent; moderate concentrations tend to promote M1 polarization, while higher concentrations may favor M2 polarization. This concentration dependence offers new perspectives for clinical treatment but also underscores the necessity for precise dosage control when using resveratrol. In summary, resveratrol exhibits significant potential in regulating macrophage polarization and treating related diseases."

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: To evaluate the 2-year outcomes of resveratrol oral supplement given as an adjunctive treatment in patients with wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD) that were treated with intravitreal injections of aflibercept. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In our retrospective study, 50 treatment-naïve patients suffering from wet-AMD were included. They were assigned to two subgroups of 25 patients each. Every participant was treated according to \"Pro Re Nata\" protocol; 3 monthly intravitreal injections of 2.0 mg aflibercept were applied followed by injections according to need. The patients in the second group also consumed daily two tablets of resveratrol enriched oral supplement (60 mg of resveratrol in total). For 2 years, the patients were monthly assessed with best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) measurement, fundus autofluorescence, optical coherence tomography (OCT) scans and OCT-angiography. The main endpoints were the change of BCVA, the number of anti-VEGF injections, the change of central foveal thickness values, and the expansion or new development of fibrosis. RESULTS: Between the studied groups, no significant differences were detected in the baseline demographic and clinical data (p>0.05 for all). Over the 24-month study period, both BCVA and central foveal thickness values did not differ significantly between the two groups. As for the number of applied injections, they were significantly fewer in the group of patients that were treated with the resveratrol supplement (9.32±1.37 vs 7.40±1.88, p<0.001). Notably, the frequency of fibrosis progression was significantly lower in the resveratrol group (p=0.04). CONCLUSION: In conclusion, our findings suggest that resveratrol oral supplement could be considered as a useful adjunctive aid to the established treatment in cases suffering from wet AMD, highlighting the superiority of the combination treatment regimen, since it was accompanied by lower rates of both intravitreal aflibercept injections and progression of macular fibrosis."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this work was to investigate whether resveratrol affects lead-induced oxidative damage in HT-22 cells, characterizing mechanisms and strategies for preventing and treating lead-induced neurotoxicity. METHODS: Various lead and resveratrol concentrations were applied to HT-22 cells over different time periods. First, we established the lead treatment (12.5, 50 and 200 μmol/L) and resveratrol (40 μmol/L) intervention model for the study. MTT was used to analyze HT-22 cell survival rate. The rates of cell death, mitochondrial membrane potential, lipid peroxidation, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation were all measured by flow cytometry. Cellular oxidant (MDA) and antioxidant (SOD, GSH-Px) levels were measured with test kits. Western blotting was used to assess the expression of proteins related to autophagy and apoptosis. RESULTS: Lead reduced HT-22 cell viability in a concentration/time-dependent manner. In addition, lead (200 μmol/L) decreased the protein expression of BCL2, while increasing PARP and BAX expression and apoptotic rate. Moreover, the lead-exposed group had significantly higher levels of ROS, lipid-ROS, and MDA than the control group. This was accompanied by increased MDA levels and decreased SOD, GSH-Px, and MMP levels in the lead-exposed cells. Furthermore, lead lowered SIRT1 protein expression, while increasing the levels of autophagy-related proteins, including P62, ATG5, Beclin-1 and LC3 Ⅱ/Ⅰ. Resveratrol (40 μmol/L), an agonist of SIRT1, restored the effects of lead (200 μmol/L) to levelsindistinguishable from controls. CONCLUSION: Resveratrol inhibited mitochondrial damage and restored the lead-induced block of autophagic flux and oxidative stress by activating SIRT1, thereby alleviating lead-induced damage in HT-22 cells.",

      "abstract": "Resveratrol, a bioactive phytoalexin, has been extensively studied as a pharmaceutical and nutraceutical candidate for the treatment of various diseases. Although its therapeutic effects have been largely attributed to its anti-oxidant properties, its underlying mechanisms and dose dependency are not well understood. Recent studies have shown that cell-free chromatin particles (cfChPs), which are released daily from billions of dying cells, can enter circulation and be internalized by healthy cells, wherein they trigger various damaging effects, including double-strand DNA breaks. Notably, deactivating cfChPs using a mixture of resveratrol and copper can neutralize their harmful effects. The addition of copper imparts a novel therapeutic property to resveratrol viz. the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which are capable of deactivating cfChPs without damaging the genomic DNA. This perspective article discusses how the deactivation of cfChPs via the ROS generated by combining resveratrol with copper can have multiple therapeutic effects. Exploiting the damaging effects of ROS to deactivate cfChPs and ameliorate disease conditions may be a viable therapeutic approach."

      "abstract": "Background and Objectives: High fructose intake is associated with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), a chronic liver disease that is on the rise worldwide. New alternatives for treatment, such as bioactive phytochemicals, are needed. The aim of this study was to investigate the beneficial role of resveratrol in treating non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Materials and Methods: Sixty male albino rats were allocated to three groups: group I, the normal control group; group II, the fructose-enriched diet group (FED), which was fed a 70% fructose diet for six weeks to induce NASH; and group III, the resveratrol-FED group (RES + FED), which was given the same FED diet plus an oral dose of 70 mg/kg resveratrol (RES) every day for an additional six weeks. We performed histological evaluations and assessed blood lipids and liver enzymes to study resveratrol's impact on NASH. Quantitative real-time PCR was used to assess the mRNA expression of nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) in the liver samples. ELISA was used to measure Beclin 1, AMPK, IL-6, and the DNA-binding activity of Nrf2. Oxidative stress indicators, including GSH, SOD, and MDA, were evaluated spectrophotometrically. Results: Resveratrol effectively alleviated the biochemical and histopathological abnormalities associated with NASH, improving autophagy by raising Beclin 1 levels while reducing inflammation by decreasing IL-6 levels. Furthermore, resveratrol restored the liver architecture and the oxidative balance, as evidenced by the decreased MDA levels and improved antioxidant status via elevated GSH and SOD activities, as well as the activation of the AMPK/Nrf2 signaling axis. Conclusions: This study specifically examines resveratrol's therapeutic effects in a high-fructose diet-induced NASH model, focusing on the AMPK/Nrf2 signaling pathway to address oxidative stress and autophagy, providing novel insights into its molecular mechanism of action. Resveratrol reduces NASH by boosting autophagy and activating the AMPK/Nrf2 pathway. These findings underscore the potential of resveratrol as a promising therapeutic agent that can support treatment alongside conventional medications in the management of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH).",

      "abstract": "In periparturient dairy cows, high non-esterified fatty acids (NEFAs) caused by a severe negative energy balance induce oxidative stress and metabolic dysfunction, which pose a severe challenge to the dairy industry. Resveratrol (RES) is a polyphenolic compound with antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and multiple other physiological effects. However, its effect on oxidative damage triggered by NEFAs in bovine mammary epithelial cells is rarely reported. This study aimed to investigate the antioxidant effects and underlying molecular mechanisms of RES in NEFA-challenged BMECs. The results showed that RES ameliorated NEFA-induced oxidative damage by upregulating antioxidant enzyme expression and reducing malondialdehyde (MDA) and reactive oxygen species (ROS). Furthermore, exogenous NEFAs resulted in a decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), cellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production, energy metabolism (NAD+/NADH ratio), abnormal mitochondrial structure and an increase in apoptosis levels. RES treatment restored mitochondrial function in NEFA-stressed BMECs, as evidenced by the increase in MMP, ATP generation and NAD+/NADH ratio accompanying the decline in mitochondrial structural abnormalities and cell apoptosis. In addition, in vivo studies in a mouse model of oxidative damage induced by high-fat diet (HFD) demonstrated that RES alleviated oxidative damage (decreased MDA content) and mitochondrial dysfunction (decreased expression of Drp1 and Fis1 and increased levels of Mfn2, Cyt C mRNA and ATP production) in mammary gland tissue. Overall, these findings suggested that RES could alleviate NEFA-induced oxidative damage in BMECs by modulating mitochondrial function, thereby contributing to the prevention and treatment of oxidative damage in perinatal dairy cows with a negative energy balance."

This approach aims to associate the advantages of hydrogels for topical administration of drugs and of lipid micelles that mimic skin composition for the delivery of poorly water-soluble compounds in combination therapy. Biomimetic micelles composed of L-α-phosphatidylcholine loaded with two distinct polyphenols (one non-flavonoid and one flavonoid) were produced using hot shear homogenisation followed by the ultrasonication method. All developed micelles were dispersed in a carbomer 940-based hydrogel to obtain three distinct semi-solid formulations, which were then characterised by analysing the thermal, rheological and textural properties. Olive pomace-based hydrogels were also produced to contain the same micelles as an alternative to respond to the needs of zero waste and circular economy. The thermograms showed no changes in the typical profiles of micelles when loaded into the hydrogels. The rheological analysis confirmed that the produced hydrogels achieved the ideal properties of a semi-solid product for topical administration. The viscosity values of the hydrogels loaded with olive pomace (hydrogels A) proved to be lower than the hydrogels without olive pomace (hydrogels B), with this ingredient having a considerable effect in reducing the viscosity of the final formulation, yet without compromising the firmness and cohesiveness of the gels. The texture analysis of both hydrogels A and B also exhibited the typical behaviour expected of a semi-solid system."

      "abstract": "Psoriasis is a chronic and incurable inflammatory skin disease usually requiring long-term disease management. Natural phytochemical resveratrol (RES) has been known for high efficiency and low toxicity, exhibiting good anti-psoriasis potential. However, its biological activity is limited by poor solubility, chemical instability, and insufficient skin retention. Herein, we developed an adhesive eutectogel loaded with RES constructed through electrostatic and hydrogen bonding cross-linking between cyclodextrin-levulinic acid supramolecular deep eutectic solvent (DES) and chitosan (CS). A series of characterizations combined with molecular dynamics simulations demonstrated that such DES not only significantly increased the solubility and stability of RES, but also acted as the cross-linker and plasticizer in eutectogel preparation. When applied to the skin surface, the eutectogel formed a soft film in situ that established tight contact with the skin, thereby enhancing RES sustained penetration into the skin. In an imiquimod-induced psoriasis-like mice model, the eutectogel effectively alleviated psoriasis symptoms, inhibited the excessive proliferation of keratinocytes, and regulated the expression of IL-23/IL-17 axis-related factors, whose therapeutic effect was better than that of commercially available calcipotriol ointment. Overall, The DES-strengthened eutectogel offers a promising topical drug delivery platform for psoriasis treatment and expands the applications of green polysaccharide medical materials.",
