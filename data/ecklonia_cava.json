      "abstract": "Steroids, which are often used to treat the inflammation associated with various skin diseases, have several negative side effects. As Ecklonia cava extract has anti-inflammatory effects in various diseases, we evaluated the efficacy of Ecklonia cava-derived extracellular vesicles (EVEs) in decreasing 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA)-induced inflammation. We determined the effect of the EVEs on the TLR4/NF-κB/NLRP3 inflammasome in human keratinocytes and mouse ear skin. TPA-treated human keratinocytes showed an increased expression of TLR4 and its ligands HMGB1 and S100A8. TPA also increased the expression of (1) NF-κB; (2) the NLRP3 inflammasome components NLRP3, ASC, and caspase 1; and (3) the pyroptosis-related factors GSDMD-NT, IL-18, and IL-1β. However, the expression of these molecules decreased in the TPA-treated human keratinocytes after EVE treatment. Similar to the in vitro results, TPA increased the expression of these molecules in mouse ear skin, and EVE treatment decreased their expression. The TPA treatment of skin increased edema, redness, neutrophil infiltration, and epidermal thickness, and EVE reduced these symptoms of inflammation. In conclusion, the EVEs decreased TPA-induced skin inflammation, which was associated with a decrease in the TLR4/NF-κB/NLRP3 inflammasome.",

      "abstract": "This study investigated the neuroprotective effect of 70% ethanol extract of Ecklonia cava (EE) in amyloid beta (Aβ)-induced cognitive deficit mice. As a result of analyzing the bioactive compounds in EE, nine compounds were identified using ultra-performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-Q-TOF-MS). In particular, the diekcol content was quantified by high-performance liquid chromatography with diode-array detection (DAD-HPLC). Biochemical analysis was performed on brain tissue to determine the mechanism of the cognitive function improvement effect of EE. The result showed that EE ameliorated learning and memory decline in behavioral tests on Aβ-induced mice. EE also attenuated oxidative stress by regulating malondialdehyde (MDA) content, reduced glutathione (GSH), and superoxide dismutase (SOD) levels. Similarly, EE also improved mitochondrial dysfunction as mitochondrial membrane potential, ATP production, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels. In addition, EE enhanced synapse function by modulating acetylcholine-related enzymes and synaptic structural proteins in the whole brain, hippocampus, and cerebral cortex tissues. Also, EE regulated Aβ-induced apoptosis and inflammation through the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) signaling pathways. Furthermore, EE protected neurotoxicity by increasing brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) production. These results suggest that EE may be used as a dietary supplement for the prevention and treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD)."

      "abstract": "This study explores the anti-obesity effects of the ethyl acetate extract of Ecklonia cava (EC-ETAC) on 3T3-L1 preadipocytes, focusing on its impact on adipogenesis, lipolysis, and adipose browning via the HO-1/Nrf2 pathway. Western blot analysis revealed that EC-ETAC significantly inhibited adipogenic transcription factors (PPARγ, C/EBPα, SREBP-1) and lipogenesis-related proteins (FAS, LPL). Concurrently, EC-ETAC enhanced lipolytic markers (p-AMPK, p-HSL) and adipose browning-related proteins (UCP-1, PGC-1α), indicating its role in promoting lipolysis and adipose browning. The inhibition of HO-1 by zinc protoporphyrin (ZnPP) significantly reversed these effects, underscoring the critical role of HO-1 in mediating the anti-obesity properties of EC-ETAC. Additionally, fluorescence measurements and Oil Red O staining confirmed the reduction of lipid accumulation and oxidative stress upon EC-ETAC treatment. These findings suggest that EC-ETAC exerts its anti-obesity effects by modulating the HO-1/Nrf2 pathway, which is crucial for regulating adipogenesis, lipolysis, and adipose browning. This study highlights the potential of EC-ETAC as a natural therapeutic agent for obesity management and supports further research into its clinical applications. By targeting the HO-1/Nrf2 pathway, EC-ETAC could offer a novel approach to enhancing energy expenditure and reducing fat mass, thereby improving metabolic health.",

      "abstract": "Nanoplastics (NPs), plastic particles ranging from 1 to 100 nm are ubiquitous environmental pollutants infiltrating ecosystems. Their small size and widespread use in various products raise concerns for human health, particularly their association with cardiovascular diseases (CVD). NPs can enter the human body through multiple routes, causing oxidative stress, and leading to the senescence and dysfunction of endothelial cells (ECs). Although there are potential natural compounds for treating CVD, there is limited research on preventing CVD induced by NPs. This study investigates the efficacy of Ecklonia cava extract (ECE) in preventing NPs-induced premature vascular senescence and dysfunction. Exposure of porcine coronary arteries (PCAs) and porcine coronary ECs to NPs, either alone or in combination with ECE, demonstrated that ECE mitigates senescence-associated β-galactosidase (SA-β-gal) activity induced by NPs, thus preventing premature endothelial senescence. ECE also improved NPs-induced vascular dysfunction. The identified active ingredient in Ecklonia cava, 2,7'-Phloroglucinol-6,6'-bieckol (PHB), a phlorotannin, proved to be pivotal in these protective effects. PHB treatment ameliorated SA-β-gal activity, reduced oxidative stress, restored cell proliferation, and decreased the expression of cell cycle regulatory proteins such as p53, p21, p16, and angiotensin type 1 receptor (AT1), well known triggers for EC senescence. Moreover, PHB also improved NPs-induced vascular dysfunction by upregulating endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) expression and restoring endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation. In conclusion, Ecklonia cava and its active ingredient, PHB, exhibit potential as therapeutic agents against NPs-induced premature EC senescence and dysfunction, indicating a protective effect against environmental pollutants-induced CVDs associated with vascular dysfunction.",

      "abstract": "Plant-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) elicit diverse biological effects, including promoting skin health. EVs isolated from Ecklonia cava (EV-EC) carry heat shock protein 70 (HSP70), which inhibits key regulators such as TNF-α, MAPKs, and NF-κB, consequently downregulating matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). Aging exacerbates oxidative stress, upregulating MAPK and NF-κB signaling and worsening extracellular matrix degradation in the skin. E. cava-derived phlorotannin (PT) mitigates MAPK and NF-κB signaling. We evaluated the impact of EV-EC and PT on skin rejuvenation using an in vitro keratinocyte senescence model and an in vivo aged-mouse model. Western blotting confirmed the presence of HSP70 in EV-EC. Treatment with EV-EC and PT in senescent keratinocytes increased HSP70 expression and decreased the expression of TNF-α, MAPK, NF-κB, activator protein-1 (AP-1), and MMPs. Oxidative stress was also reduced. Sequential treatment with PT and EV-EC (PT/EV-EC) yielded more significant results compared to individual treatments. The administration of PT/EV-EC to the back skin of aged mice mirrored the in vitro findings, resulting in increased collagen fiber accumulation and improved elasticity in the aged skin. Therefore, PT/EV-EC holds promise in promoting skin rejuvenation by increasing HSP70 expression, decreasing the expression of MMPs, and reducing oxidative stress in aged skin.",

      "abstract": "Hyperpigmentation due to ultraviolet (UV)-induced melanogenesis causes various esthetic problems. Phlorotannin (PT) and extracellular vesicles (EVs) derived from various plants suppress melanogenesis pathways. We used UV-exposed keratinocytes and animal skin to determine if co-treatment with PT and EVs from Ecklonia cava (EVE) could inhibit melanogenesis by reducing UV-induced oxidative stress and the expression of the thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP)/nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptor family pyrin domain containing the 3 (NLRP3)/interleukin-18 (IL-18) pathway, which are upstream signals of the microphthalmia-associated transcription factor. UV exposure increased oxidative stress in keratinocytes and animal skin, as evaluated by 8-OHdG expression, and this effect was reduced by co-treatment with PT and EVE. UV also increased binding between NLRP3 and TXNIP, which increased NLRP3 inflammasome activation and IL-18 secretion, and this effect was reduced by co-treatment with PT and EVE in keratinocytes and animal skin. In melanocytes, conditioned media (CM) from UV-exposed keratinocytes increased the expression of melanogenesis-related pathways; however, these effects were reduced with CM from UV-exposed keratinocytes treated with PT and EVE. Similarly, PT and EVE treatment reduced melanogenesis-related signals, melanin content, and increased basement membrane (BM) components in UV-exposed animal skin. Thus, co-treatment with PT and EVE reduced melanogenesis and restored the BM structure by reducing oxidative stress and TXNIP/NLRP3/IL-18 pathway expression."

      "abstract": "Ecklonia cava, a brown seaweed native to the East Asian coast, is known for its unique composition, including polysaccharides, polyphenols, and phlorotannins. Fucoidan is a sulfated polysaccharide widely used as a functional ingredient in foods. This study obtained crude polysaccharides (ECC_CPS) from E. cava celluclast enzymatic hydrolysate using ethanol precipitation. ECC_CPS increased cell viability during the proliferation of Hanwoo muscle satellite cells (HMSCs). The effect of ECC_CPS on the expression of proliferation-related markers was confirmed as MYF5 and MYOD expression significantly increased, whereas PAX7 expression was maintained. The evaluation of cell migration activity has a major impact on cell proliferation and differentiation, and the cell migration index significantly increased with ECC_CPS treatment (p < 0.01). This was related to the HGF/MET pathway and FAK pathway. Treatment with ECC_CPS promoted differentiation at the cell differentiation stage, thereby increasing the expression of differentiation markers, such as MYH2, MYH7, and MYOG (p < 0.001 or p < 0.01). Therefore, our findings imply that crude polysaccharide obtained from E. cava can be an additive ingredient that enhances the proliferation and differentiation of muscle satellite cells used in the manufacture of cultured meat products."

The anti‑tumor activity of an aqueous extract of E. cava (AEC) against colon carcinoma was evaluated by analyzing the alterations in tumor growth, histopathological structure and molecular mechanisms in CT26 tumor‑bearing BALB/cKorl syngeneic mice after administrating AEC for five weeks. AEC contained high total phenolic contents and demonstrated significant scavenging activity against 2,2‑diphenyl‑1‑picrylhydrazyl radicals. Marked anti‑tumor effects were demonstrated in the AEC‑treated CT26 cells. In the in vivo syngeneic model, the AEC treatment decreased the volume and weight of CT26 tumors, and expanded the necrotic region in the hematoxylin and eosin stained tumor sections. The inhibitory effects of AEC on tumor growth were reflected by the increased level of apoptotic proteins, inhibition of cell proliferation, suppression of metastasis ability and increase in tumor‑suppressing activity in CT26 tumor‑bearing BALB/cKorl syngeneic mice. The potential function of phlorotannin (PT), one of the primary active compounds in AEC, was demonstrated by the increased cytotoxicity, apoptosis and suppression of cell proliferation in PT‑treated CT26 cells. Overall, the results of the present study provide novel scientific evidence that AEC can suppress the growth of CT26 colon cancer by activating apoptosis, suppressing cell proliferation, inhibiting cell migration and enhancing the tumor‑suppressing activity.",

Neuroinflammation in the central nervous system plays an important role in the development and progression of neurodegenerative diseases. Polyphenol-rich natural products, such as Ecklonia cava (E. cava), are known to have anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties and can provide treatment strategies for neurodegenerative diseases by controlling neuroinflammation. We investigated the effects of an E. cava extract on neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration under chronic inflammatory conditions. Mice were pretreated with E. cava extract for 19 days and then exposed to E. cava with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) for 1 week. We monitored pro-inflammatory cytokines levels in the serum, inflammation-related markers, and neurodegenerative markers using Western blotting and qRT-PCR in the mouse cerebrum and hippocampus. E. cava reduced pro-inflammatory cytokine levels in the blood and brain of mice with LPS-induced chronic inflammation. We also measured the activity of genes related to neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. Surprisingly, E. cava decreased the activity of markers associated with inflammation (NF-kB and STAT3) and a neurodegenerative disease marker (glial fibrillary acidic protein, beta-amyloid) in the cerebrum and hippocampus of mice. We suggest that E. cava extract has the potential as a protective agent against neuroinflammation and neurodegenerative diseases.",

The aim of this work was to assess the therapeutic potential and underlying mechanism of action of dieckol (DK), isolated from Ecklonia cava, on renal damage induced by methylglyoxal (MGO) in mouse glomerular mesangial cells. The antiglycation properties of DK were evaluated using ELISA. We conducted molecular docking, immunofluorescence analysis, and Western blotting to confirm the mechanism by which DK prevents AGE-related diabetic nephropathy. DK treatment exhibited antiglycation properties through the inhibition of AGE production, inhibition of cross-linking between AGE and collagen, and breaking of its cross-linking. DK pretreatment exhibited protective effects on renal cells by suppressing MGO-induced intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation, intracellular MGO and AGE accumulation, activation of the apoptosis cascade and apoptosis-related protein expression, activation of receptor for AGE (RAGE) protein expression, and suppression of the glyoxalase system. Furthermore, DK exhibited a stronger binding affinity for RAGE than AGE, which was confirmed as exerting a competitive inhibitory effect on the AGE-RAGE interaction. These results demonstrated that DK is a potential natural AGE inhibitor that can be utilized to prevent and treat AGE-induced diabetic nephropathy."

The double-blind, randomized-controlled trial was conducted from November 2020 to April 2021 in Riyadh, in 20 prediabetic patients with no other health complications. Subjects were given 600 mg of seaweed extract in a single dose for acute effect investigation. PPBG and PPIL were measured immediately at intervals of 30, 60, 90, and 120 min following 75 g of carbohydrate consumption, iAUC and peak concentration were calculated accordingly. Insignificant differences were shown for PPBG levels between study groups at intervals of 30 and 60 min (p > .05). However, PPBG results were significantly lower in the intervention group compared to placebo of 90 and 120 min after carbohydrate (75 g) consumption. The mean (SD) of PPBG in the seaweed group at 90 and 120 min was 108.1 (±8.9) and 101.3 (±8.7), respectively, compared to the placebo group at 90 and 120 min with a mean of 122.2 (±16.9) and 112.9 (±12.1), respectively (p value at 90 min = 0.032) and (p value at 120 min = 0.024). iAUC of PPBG shows no significant differences between the study groups (p > .05). There was no significant difference in PPIL between study groups at all study measurements (p > .05). Discomfort symptoms were similar between study groups (p > .05). This study indicated that a single dose of 600 mg of E. cava extract has a lowering effect on postprandial blood glucose with no associated side effects. Further research should investigate the glycemic modulating effects of marine algal extracts in the long-term investigation."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Ecklonia cava is an edible marine brown alga harvested from the ocean that is widely consumed in Asian countries as a health-promoting medicinal food The objective of the present study is to evaluate the anti-asthma mechanism of a new functional food produced by bioprocessing edible algae Ecklonia cava and shiitake Lentinula edodes mushroom mycelia and isolated fractions. METHODS: We used as series of methods, including high performance liquid chromatography, gas chromatography, cell assays, and an in vivo mouse assay to evaluate the asthma-inhibitory effect of Ecklonia cava bioprocessed (fermented) with Lentinula edodes shiitake mushroom mycelium and its isolated fractions in mast cells and in orally fed mice. RESULTS: The treatments inhibited the degranulation of RBL-2H3 cells and immunoglobulin E (IgE) production, suggesting anti-asthma effects in vitro. The in vitro anti-asthma effects in cells were confirmed in mice following the induction of asthma by alumina and chicken egg ovalbumin (OVA). Oral administration of the bioprocessed Ecklonia cava and purified fractions suppressed the induction of asthma and was accompanied by the inhibition of inflammation- and immune-related substances, including eotaxin; thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP); OVA-specific IgE; leukotriene C4 (LTC4); prostaglandin D2 (PGD2); and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and other fluids and organs. Th2 cytokines were reduced and Th1 cytokines were restored in serum, suggesting the asthma-induced inhibitory effect is regulated by the balance of the Th1/Th2 immune response. Serum levels of IL-10, a regulatory T cell (Treg) cytokine, were increased, further favoring reduced inflammation. Histology of lung tissues revealed that the treatment also reversed the thickening of the airway wall and the contraction and infiltration of bronchial and blood vessels and perialveolar inflammatory cells. The bioprocessed Ecklonia cava/mushroom mycelia new functional food showed the highest inhibition as compared with commercial algae and the fractions isolated from the bioprocessed product. CONCLUSIONS: The in vitro cell and in vivo mouse assays demonstrate the potential value of the new bioprocessed formulation as an anti-inflammatory and anti-allergic combination of natural compounds against allergic asthma and might also ameliorate allergic manifestations of foods, drugs, and viral infections.",

      "abstract": "Obesity is becoming a global epidemic as a result of high-calorie food intake and unhealthy lifestyles. Different marine plants, especially brown algae (Ecklonia cava), are traditionally used to treat different health-related issues. The study was carried out to investigate the anti-obesity properties of E. cava 70% ethanol extract. To evaluate the anti-obesity effect of E. cava, both in vitro and in vivo tests were performed. E. cava suppresses pre-adipocyte 3T3-L1 differentiation in a dose-dependent manner. In HFD-induced obese rats' models, administration of E. cava 125, 250, and 500 mg/kg significantly decreases total body weight and organs, especially liver weight, in all treatment groups. Adipose tissue weight, including subcutaneous, epididymal, peritoneal, and mesenteric adipose tissue, was markedly reduced in E. cava-treated HFD rats in dose-dependent manners. In addition, liver-related biomarkers AST, ALP, ALT, and GGT were evaluated; the lower level of liver-related biomarkers indicates no liver injury or fatty liver issue in E. cava HFD treatment groups. In addition, E. cava treatment has significant effects on the expression of adipogenic and lipogenic (PPAR-γ, FAS, LPL, and SREBP-1c) genes. Altogether, these results show the anti-obesity effect of E. cava. We concluded that E. cava could be a potential candidate for the prevention of obesity-induced by a high-fat diet."

Here, we purified fucoidan fractions from a crude polysaccharide obtained after the crude polysaccharide of celluclast-assisted hydrolysate from Ecklonia cava (ECC). We evaluated the effect of ECC on lipid accumulation in differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes and investigated its anti-obesity effects in vivo in high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obese mice. In vitro Oil Red O staining revealed that treatment with ECC and its purified fucoidan fractions of celluclast assisted hydrolysate from Ecklonia cava (ECFs) remarkably reduced lipid accumulation in 3T3-L1 cells. ECF3 contained the highest contents of polysaccharides and sulfate compared with other fucoidan fractions. ECF3 treatment significantly reduced lipid accumulation in 3T3-L1 cells. Oral administration of ECC significantly reduced body weight, body weight gain, serum lipid content, and total white adipose tissue mass. Histological analysis revealed that ECC reduced lipid accumulation in EAT and liver tissues. Our findings suggest that the anti-obesity effects of ECC are associated with suppressing lipid accumulation in white adipose tissues and increased energy expenditure by upregulating the expression of thermogenic UCP1 and UCP3 in BAT. These results indicate that ECC and its ECFs possess anti-obesity properties and can be used in food and nutraceutical industries."

Stool-related parameters (including stool number, weight, and water contents), gastrointestinal motility, and length of intestine were significantly enhanced in the Lop+Pt-treated group as compared to the Lop+Vehicle-treated group. A similar recovery was detected in the histopathological and cytological structure of the mid-colon of Lop+Pt-treated rats, although the level of mucin secretion remained constant. Moreover, rats with Lop-induced constipation subjected to Pt treatment showed significant improvements in water channel expression, gastrointestinal hormone secretions, and expression of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors M2/M3 (mAChRs M2/M3) and their mediators of muscarinic cholinergic regulation. Furthermore, the Lop+Pt-treated group showed a significant recovery of Bifidobacteriaceae, Muribaculaceae, Clostridiaceae, and Eubacteriaceae families in fecal microbiota. Taken together, these results provide the first evidence that exposure of SD rats with Lop-induced constipation to Pt improves the constipation phenotype through the regulation of membrane water channel expression, GI hormones, the mAChR signaling pathway, and fecal microbiota.",

In this study, the effect of Ecklonia cava-extracted fucoidan (ECF) on the induction of anti-cancer immunity in the lung was examined by intranasal administration. In C57BL/6 and BALB/c mice, intranasal administration of ECF promoted the activation of dendritic cells (DCs), natural killer (NK) cells, and T cells in the mediastinal lymph node (mLN). The ECF-induced NK and T cell activation was mediated by DCs. In addition, intranasal injection with ECF enhanced the anti-PD-L1 antibody-mediated anti-cancer activities against B16 melanoma and CT-26 carcinoma tumor growth in the lungs, which were required cytotoxic T lymphocytes and NK cells. Thus, these data demonstrated that ECF functioned as a mucosal adjuvant that enhanced the immunotherapeutic effect of immune checkpoint inhibitors against metastatic lung cancer.",

The anti-inflammatory effect of the extract from brown algae Ecklonia cava was analyzed in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated human gingival fibroblasts (HGF-1), the most abundant cells in gingival tissue. The gene expressions of cyclooxygenase-2 and interleukin-6 were decreased by 78 and 50%, respectively, at 100 μg/mL Ecklonia cava extract (ECE) treatment. The gene expressions of matrix metalloproteases (MMP-2 and MMP-8) and chemokines (macrophage inflammatory protein 1-alpha and stromal cell-derived factor 1) were also significantly down-regulated by ECE treatment (p < 0.05). The increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in HGF-1 cells by LPS stimulation was decreased by 30% at 100 μg/mL ECE treatment. The mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway and the nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) signal activated by ROS were suppressed by ECE in a dose-dependent manner. ECE treatment (400 mg/kg, 8 weeks) significantly improved alveolar bone resorption in the ligature-induced chronic periodontitis rat model. ECE supplementation also lowered elevated mRNA expression of the receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappa B (RANKL)/osteoprotegerin (OPG) in the gingival tissue (p < 0.05). Therefore, ECE mitigated gingival tissue destruction and bone resorption associated with chronic periodontitis condition."

Among these, E. cava fucoidan (ECF) promoted an increase in the number of NK cells in the spleen and had the strongest effect on the activation of NK cells. Additionally, we observed that DC stimulation was required for NK cell activation and that ECF had the most potent effect on splenic dendritic cells (DC).

The brown alga Ecklonia cava Kjellman, an edible seaweed, contains many bioactives such as phlorotannins and fucoidans. Here, we evaluated the antioxidative, neuroprotective, and anti-apoptotic effects of E. cava extract (ECE), E. cava phlorotannin-rich extract (ECPE), and the phlorotannin dieckol on neuronal PC-12 cells. The antioxidant capacities of ECPE and ECE were 1,711.5 and 1,050.4 mg vitamin C equivalents/g in the ABTS assay and 704.0 and 474.6 mg vitamin C equivalents/g in the DPPH assay, respectively. The dieckol content of ECPE (58.99 mg/g) was approximately 60% higher than that of ECE (36.97 mg/g). Treatment of PC-12 cells with ECPE and ECE increased cell viability in a dose-dependent manner. Intracellular oxidative stress in PC-12 cells due to ECPE and ECE decreased dose-independently by up to 63% and 47%, respectively, compared with the stress control (323%). ECPE reduced the production of the pro-apoptotic proteins Bax and caspase-3 more effectively than ECE. Early and late apoptosis in PC-12 cells were more effectively decreased by ECPE than ECE treatments. From the results obtained in this study, we concluded that ECPE, which is rich in phlorotannins, including the marker compound dieckol, may be applied to the development of functional materials for improving cognition and memory.",

Moreover, eckol suppressed the production of the cytokines, interleukin (IL)-4, IL-5, IL-6, and IL-13 and the chemokine, thymus activation-regulated chemokine (TARC) by downregulating, IκB-α degradation and NF-κB nuclear translocation. Furthermore, it attenuated the passive cutaneous anaphylactic reaction induced by IgE/BSA-stimulation in the ear of BALB/c mice. These results suggest that eckol is a potential therapeutic candidate for the prevention and treatment of allergic disorders.",

In the present study, we evaluated the effects of Ecklonia cava extract (ECE), which contained rich phlorotannins, on inflammation and leptin resistance in the adipose tissue of a diet-induced obese model. Effects of ECE on fat deposition, inflammation, M1/M2 macrophage, and T-cell infiltrations were investigated, and leptin resistance and SOCS3 were also measured in adipose tissue. Furthermore, ECE attenuated the expression of inflammation-related receptors such as TLR4 and RAGE and leptin resistance by reducing SOCS3 expression, increasing expression of leptin receptor in adipose tissue, and increasing lipolysis. ECE showed antiadiposity and anti-inflammatory effects, attenuated leptin resistance, and increased lipolysis in the diet-induced obese model. This study shows that ECE is a suitable dietary supplement candidate for the prevention or treatment of obesity or obesity-associated diseases, especially inflammation-related diseases."

HaCaT cells were stimulated with tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) mixture, and treated with various concentration of eckol (25, 50, and 100 µg/ml). The expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines were analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), respectively. Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPKs) and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) signaling pathways regulate immune and inflammation responses. Phosphorylation of MAPKs and NF-κB, indicating activation of respective signaling pathways, was examined by western blot analysis. Treatment of TNF-α and IFN-γ promoted the mRNA expression and production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in HaCaT cells. However, eckol significantly suppressed the these mediators. Furthermore, activation of TNF-α/IFN-γ-induced MAPKs and NF-κB signaling pathway was inhibited by eckol treatment. Eckol also hampered the TNF-α/IFN-γ-mediated nuclear translocation of NF-κB p65 in HaCaT cells. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that eckol shows effective protective activity against TNF-α/IFN-γ-induced skin inflammation."

Oxidative stress caused by reactive oxygen species is associated with progressive neuronal cell damage and death in Alzheimer's disease, one of the most common neurodegenerative disorders. An edible brown seaweed, Ecklonia cava, contains a variety of biologically active compounds such as phlorotannins. In this study, we comparatively evaluated the total phenolic content, antioxidant capacity, and neuroprotective effects of the phlorotannin-rich extract from E. cava (PEEC). The total phenolic content of PEEC and dieckol was 810.8 mg gallic acid equivalents (GAE)/g and 996.6 mg GAE/g, respectively. Antioxidant capacity of PEEC was 1,233.8 mg vitamin C equivalents (VCE)/g and 392.1 mg VCE/g determined using ABTS and DPPH assays, respectively, while those of dieckol were 2,238.4 mg VCE/g and 817.7 mg VCE/g. High-performance liquid chromatography results revealed 48.08 ± 0.67 mg dieckol/g of PEEC. PEEC had neuroprotective effects in pheochromocytoma (PC-12) and human neuroblastoma (SH-SY5Y) cells against H2O2- and AAPH-induced oxidative damage, partly due to reduced intracellular oxidative stress. PEEC treatment inhibited acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase in a dose-dependent manner. Taken together, these findings suggest that PEEC is a good source of antioxidants and neuroprotective materials.",

      "abstract": "The hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) injury causes serious complications after the blood supply to the kidney is stopped during surgery. The main mechanism of I/R injury is the release of high-mobility group protein B1 (HMGB1) from injured tubular epithelial cells (TEC, TCMK-1 cell), which triggers TLR4 or RAGE signaling, leading to cell death. We evaluated whether the extracts of Ecklonia cava (E. cava) would attenuate TEC death induced by H/R injury. We also evaluated which phlorotannin-dieckol (DK), phlorofucofuroeckol A (PFFA), pyrogallol phloroglucinol-6,6-bieckol (PPB), or 2,7-phloroglucinol-6,6-bieckol (PHB)-would have the most potent effect in the context of H/R injury. We used for pre-hypoxia treatment, in which the phlorotannins from E. cava extracts were added before the onset of hypoxia, and a post- hypoxia treatment, in which the phlorotannins were added before the start of reperfusion. PPB most effectively reduced HMGB1 release and the expression of TLR4 and RAGE induced by H/R injury in both pre- and post-hypoxia treatment. PPB also most effectively inhibited the expression of NF-kB and release of the inflammatory cytokines TNF-α and IL-6 in both models. PPB most effectively inhibited cell death and expression of cell death signaling molecules such as Erk/pErk, JNK/pJNK, and p38/pp38. These results suggest that PPB blocks the HGMB1-TLR4/RAGE signaling pathway and decreases TEC death induced by H/R and that PPB can be a novel target for renal H/R injury therapy.",

In this study, osteoblastogenesis promoting effects of algal phlorotannin, phlorofucofuroeckol A (PFF-A), were evaluated. PFF-A was isolated from brown alga Ecklonia cava. The ability of PFF-A to enhance osteoblast differentiation was observed in murine pre-osteoblast cell line MC3T3-E1 and human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (huBM-MSCs). Proliferation and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity of osteoblasts during differentiation was assayed following PFF-A treatment along extracellular mineralization. In addition, effect of PFF-A on osteoblast maturation pathways such as Runx2 and Smads was analyzed. Treatment of PFF-A was able to enhance the proliferation of differentiating osteoblasts. Also, ALP activity was observed to be increased. Osteoblasts showed increased extracellular mineralization, observed by Alizarin Red staining, following PFF-A treatment. In addition, expression levels of critical proteins in osteoblastogenesis such as ALP, bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2), osteocalcin and β-catenin were stimulated after the introduction of PFF-A. In conclusion, PFF-A was suggested to be a potential natural product with osteoblastogenesis enhancing effects which can be utilized against bone-remodeling imbalances and osteoporosis-related complications.",

It has been previously shown that the extract of Ecklonia cava Kjellman, a perennial brown macroalga, can alleviate oxidative stress in epidermal keratinocytes exposed to PM less than 10 microns in diameter (PM10). The present study was undertaken to further examine the anti-inflammatory effects of E. cava extract and its major polyphenolic constituent, dieckol. HaCaT keratinocytes were exposed to PM10 in the presence or absence of E. cava extract or dieckol and analyzed for their viability, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) release, and gene expression of cyclooxygenase (COX)-1, COX-2, microsomal prostaglandin E2 synthase (mPGES)-1, mPGES-2, and cytosolic prostaglandin E2 synthase (cPGES). PM10 treatment decreased cell viability and increased the production of PGE2, and these changes were partially abrogated by E. cava extract. E. cava extract also attenuated the expression of COX-1, COX-2, and mPGES-2 stimulated by PM10. Dieckol attenuated PGE2 production and the gene expression of COX-1, COX-2, and mPGES-1 stimulated by PM10. This study demonstrates that E. cava extract and dieckol alleviate airborne PM10-induced PGE2 production in keratinocytes through the inhibition of gene expression of COX-1, COX-2, mPGES-1, and/or mPGES-2. Thus, E. cava extract and dieckol are potentially useful natural cosmetic ingredients for counteracting the pro-inflammatory effects of airborne PM."

The levels of nitric oxide (NO) and prostaglandin E2 were decreased by more than half on treatment with 100 μg/mL ECE. Downregulated tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin (IL)-1β, and IL-6 gene expression confirmed the anti-inflammatory properties of ECE. ECE treatment upregulated heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) expression by 6.3-fold and increased HO-1/nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf-2) signaling decreased nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) translocation. ECE administration (400 mg/kg) significantly reduced gingival index, restricted tooth mobility, and prevented alveolar bone loss (p < 0.05). These beneficial effects were due to decreased inflammatory cell infiltration, IL-1β production, and matrix metalloproteinase expression in gingival tissues. The ratio of receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB ligand (RANKL)/osteoprotegerin, a biomarker of periodontitis and osteolysis, was significantly decreased by ECE administration (p < 0.05). Thus, ECE has potential therapeutic effects for the alleviation of periodontal disease.",

In our efforts towards the development of potent multi-target, directed agents for AD treatment, major phlorotannins such as eckol, dieckol, and 8,8'-bieckol from Ecklonia cava (E. cava) were evaluated. Based on the in vitro study, all tested compounds showed potent inhibitory effects on BACE1 and AChE. In particular, 8,8'-bieckol demonstrated the best inhibitory effect against BACE1 and AChE, with IC50 values of 1.62 ± 0.14 and 4.59 ± 0.32 µM, respectively. Overall, kinetic studies demonstrated that all the tested compounds acted as dual BACE1 and AChE inhibitors in a non-competitive or competitive fashion, respectively. In silico docking analysis exhibited that the lowest binding energies of all compounds were negative, and specifically different residues of each target enzyme interacted with hydroxyl groups of phlorotannins. The present study suggested that major phlorotannins derived from E. cava possess significant potential as drug candidates for therapeutic agents against AD.",

Therefore, the inhibition of Aβ-induced neurotoxicity is a potential therapeutic approach for the treatment of AD. Ecklonia cava is an edible brown seaweed, which has been recognized as a rich source of bioactive derivatives, mainly phlorotannins. In this study, phlorotannins including eckol, dieckol, 8,8'-bieckol were used as potential neuroprotective candidates for their anti-apoptotic and anti-inflammatory effects against Aβ25-35-induced damage in PC12 cells. Among the tested compounds, dieckol showed the highest effect in both suppressing intracellular oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction and activation of caspase family. Three phlorotannins were found to inhibit TNF-α, IL-1β and PGE₂ production at the protein levels. These result showed that the anti-inflammatory properties of our compounds are related to the down-regulation of proinflammatory enzymes, iNOS and COX-2, through the negative regulation of the NF-κB pathway in Aβ25-35-stimulated PC12 cells. Especially, dieckol showed the strong anti-inflammatory effects via suppression of p38, ERK and JNK. However, 8,8'-bieckol markedly decreased the phosphorylation of p38 and JNK and eckol suppressed the activation of p38. Therefore, the results of this study indicated that dieckol from E. cava might be applied as a drug candidate for the development of new generation therapeutic agents against AD.",

The symptoms of PCOS are irregular menstrual cycles, weight gain, subfertility and infertility. However, because the etiology is unclear, management and treatment methods for PCOS are not well established. Recently, natural substances have been used for PCOS therapy. Ecklonia cava (E. cava) is a well-known natural substance that attenuates the effects of inflammation, allergies, and cancer. In this study, we investigated the effects of E. cava extract in rats with PCOS. When rats with letrozole-induced PCOS were exposed to the E. cava extract, the regular estrus cycle was restored, similar to that in placebo rats. Hormone levels, including the levels of testosterone, estrogen, luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), and anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH), were restored to their normal states. Histological analysis revealed that the polycystic ovary symptoms were significantly decreased in the E. cava-treated rats and were comparable to those of normal ovaries. At the transcriptional and translational levels, Ar, and Esr2 levels were markedly increased in the E. cava-treated rats with PCOS compared with the rats with letrozole-induced PCOS. These results suggest that the E. cava extract inhibits the symptoms of PCOS by restoring imbalanced hormonal levels and irregular ovarian cycles in letrozole-induced female rats."

      "abstract": "Ecklonia cava, an edible marine brown alga (Laminariaceae), is a rich source of bioactive compounds such as fucoidan and phlorotannins. Ecklonia cava extract (ECE) was prepared using 70% ethanol extraction and ECE contained 67% and 10.6% of total phlorotannins and dieckol, respectively. ECE treatment significantly inhibited receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB ligand (RANKL)-induced osteoclast differentiation of RAW 264.7 cells and pit formation in bone resorption assay (p ＜0.05). Moreover, it suppressed RANKL-induced NF-κB and mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling in a dose dependent manner. Downregulated osteoclast-specific gene (tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase, cathepsin K, and matrix metalloproteinase-9) expression and osteoclast proliferative transcriptional factors (nuclear factor of activated T cells-1 and c-fos) confirmed ECE-mediated suppression of osteoclastogenesis. ECE treatment (100 μg/ml) increased heme oxygenase-1 expression by 2.5-fold and decreased intercellular reactive oxygen species production during osteoclastogenesis. The effective inhibition of RANKL-stimulated osteoclast differentiation and oxidative stress by ECE suggest that ECE has therapeutic potential in alleviating osteoclast-associated disorders.",

E. cava contains various polyphenols with different functions, but few studies have compared the effects of these polyphenols. Here, we comparatively investigated four major compounds present in an ethanoic extract of E. cava. These four major compounds were isolated and their effects were examined on monocyte-associated vascular inflammation and dysfunctions. Pyrogallol-phloroglucinol-6,6-bieckol (PPB) significantly inhibited monocyte migration in vitro by reducing levels of inflammatory macrophage differentiation and of its related molecular factors. In addition, PPB protected against monocyte-associated endothelial cell death by increasing the phosphorylations of PI3K-AKT and AMPK, decreasing caspase levels, and reducing monocyte-associated vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation and migration by decreasing the phosphorylations of ERK and AKT. The results of this study show that four compounds were effective for reduction of monocyte-associated vascular inflammation and dysfunctions, but PPB might be more useful for the treatment of vascular dysfunction in diseases associated with poor circulation.",

This study was performed to evaluate the inhibition of the catalytic reaction of α-glucosidase by minor phlorotannin derivatives (1-5) from Ecklonia cava. These derivatives demonstrated inhibitory activity, with IC50 values ranging from 2.3 ± 0.1 to 59.8 ± 0.8 μM. Among the phlorotannins identified, compounds 2 and 3-5 were revealed to be non-competitive and competitive inhibitors, respectively. Furthermore, a fluorescence-quenching study of receptor-ligand binding was performed to calculate the kinetic parameters (Ksv, Kq, and K). These signal data indicated a 1:1 ratio of ligand-receptor binding. The binding conformations of the phlorotannin ligands were visually solved through molecular simulation. In conclusion, these minor phlorotannins may serve as α-glucosidase inhibitors targeted for the treatment of type 2 diabetes.",

The EEc was separated and purified with the digestive enzymes pectinase (Rapidase X‑Press L) and cellulase (Rohament CL) and its effects on the progression of HFD‑induced obesity were examined over 10 weeks. The mice were divided into 6 groups (n=10/group) as follows: Normal diet group, HFD group, mice fed a HFD with 25 mg/kg/day Garcinia cambogia extract and mice fed a HFD with 5, 25 or 150 mg/kg/day EEc (EHD groups). Changes in body weight, fat, serum lipid levels and lipogenic enzyme levels were determined. The body weight and liver weight were increased in the HFD group compared with those in the ND group, which was significantly reduced by EEc supplementation. In addition, significant reductions in epididymal, perirenal and mesenteric white adipose tissues were present in the EHD groups and all three EHD groups exhibited decreases in insulin, leptin and glutamate pyruvate transaminase levels compared with those in the HFD group. In addition, EEc treatment significantly decreased the serum and hepatic triglyceride levels compared with those in the HFD group. However, the levels of high‑density lipoprotein cholesterol/total cholesterol ration increased significantly in EHD‑25 and ‑150 groups compared with those in the HFD group. Changes in adipogenic and lipogenic protein expression in the liver was assessed by western blot analysis. The EHD‑25 and -150 groups exhibited reduced levels of CCAAT/enhancer‑binding protein α and peroxisome proliferator activated receptor γ. However, the phosphorylation ratios of AMP‑activated protein kinase and acetyl‑CoA carboxylase were significantly increased in the liver tissue obtained from the EHD (5, ‑25 and ‑150 mg/kg/day) groups compared with those in the HFD group. EEc supplementation reduced levels of sterol regulatory element‑binding protein‑1c, adipose fatty acid‑binding protein, fatty acid synthase and leptin, while it significantly increased glucose transporter type 4 and adiponectin protein levels in the liver tissues of all three EHD groups compared with those in the HFD group. Taken together, these results suggest that EEc exerts anti‑obesity effects by reducing body weight and the serum and hepatic levels of obesity‑associated factors. Thus, EEc supplementation reduces HFD‑induced obesity in C57BL/6N mice and has the potential to prevent obesity and subsequent metabolic disorders.",

Despite its wide use and beneficial properties, comprehensive toxicological information regarding EC extract is currently limited. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate acute toxicity, subchronic toxicity, and genotoxicity of enzymatic EC extract according to test guidelines published by Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. The acute oral LD50 values of this EC extract administered to rats and dogs were estimated to be more than 3000 mg/kg BW. In an oral 13-week toxicity study, changes in body weights of rats exposed to the EC extract up to 3000 mg/kg BW were found to be normal. In addition, repeated doses of EC extract failed to influence any systematic parameters of treatment-related toxic symptoms such as food/water consumption, mortality, urinalysis, hematology, serum biochemistry, organ weight, or histopathology. These results indicated that the no-observed-adverse-effect level for the EC extract was 3000 mg/kg/day for male and female rats. Data obtained from Ames test, chromosome aberration assay, and micronucleus assay indicated that EC extract was not mutagenic or clastogenic. Taken together, these results support the safety of enzymatic EC extract as a potential therapeutic for human consumption against various diseases.",

Previously, Ecklonia cava has shown anti-inflammatory and antioxidative effects. Our group aimed to investigate whether E. cava polyphenol extract (ECPE) improves renal damage in high fat diet (HFD)-induced obese mice through regulation of not only energy metabolism but also oxidative stress and inflammation. After obesity induction by HFD, the mice were treated with different dosages of ECPE (100 or 500 mg/kg/day) by gavage for 12 weeks. ECPE treatment lowered the protein levels related to lipid accumulation (SREBP1c, ACC & FAS), inflammation (NLRP3 inflammasome, NFκB, MCP-1, TNF-α & CRP), and oxidative stress (Nrf2, HO-1, MnSOD, NQO1, GPx, 4-HNE and protein carbonyls) in HFD induced obese mice. Moreover, ECPE supplementation significantly up-regulated renal SIRT1, PGC-1α, and AMPK, which are associated with renal energy metabolism. Consequently, the results provide novel insights into the anti-inflammatory roles of ECPE in obesity-induced renal inflammation.",

In this study, we investigated the effect of phloroglucinol on the control of blood glucose levels and the regulation of hepatic glucose production. Phloroglucinol significantly improved glucose tolerance in male C57BL/6J mice fed a high fat diet (HFD) and inhibited glucose production in mouse primary hepatocytes. The expression of phosphoenol pyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) and glucose-6-phosphatase mRNA and protein (G6Pase), enzymes involved in gluconeogenesis, were inhibited in liver tissue from phloroglucinol-treated mice and in phloroglucinol-treated HepG2 cells. In addition, phloroglucinol treatment increased phosphorylated AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)α in HepG2 cells. Treatment with compound C, an AMPKα inhibitor, inhibited the increase of phosphorylated AMPKα and the decrease of PEPCK and G6Pase expression caused by phloroglucinol treatment. We conclude that phloroglucinol may inhibit hepatic gluconeogenesis via modulating the AMPKα signaling pathway, and thus lower blood glucose levels.",

The components of Ecklonia cava (E. cava) were first separated and purified using the digestive enzymes pectinase (Rapidase® X‑Press L) and cellulase (Rohament® CL). We found that the EEc extract contained three distinct phlorotannins: eckol, dieckol and phlorofucofuroeckol-A. Among the phlorotannins, dieckol was the most abundant in the EEc extract at 16 mg/g. Then we examined the inhibitory effects of EEc extract treatment on differentiation‑related transcription factors and on adipogenesis‑related gene expression in vitro using 3T3-L1 adipocytes. 3T3‑L1 pre‑adipocytes were used to determine the concentrations of the EEc extract and Garcinia cambogia (Gar) extract that did not result in cytotoxicity. Glucose utilization and triglyceride (TG) accumulation in the EEc‑treated adipocytes were similarly inhibited by 50 µg/ml EEc and 200 µg/ml Gar, and these results were confirmed by Oil Red O staining. Protein expression of adipogenesis differentiation‑related transcription factors following treatment with the EEc extract was also examined. Only the expression of CCAAT/enhancer‑binding protein (C/EBP)α was decreased, while there was no effect on the expression of C/EBPβ, C/EBPδ, and peroxisome proliferator‑activated receptor γ (PPARγ). Treatment with the EEc extract decreased the expression levels of adipogenesis‑related genes, in particular sterol regulatory element binding protein‑1c (SREBP‑1c), adipocyte fatty acid binding protein (A‑FABP), fatty acid synthase (FAS) and adiponectin. These results suggest that EEc extract treatment has an inhibitory effect on adipogenesis, specifically by affecting the activation of the C/EBPα signaling pathway and the resulting adipogenesis-related gene expression.",

Side effects such as nephrotoxicity, neurotoxicity, and ototoxicity lead to dose limitations. Ecklonia cava polyphenol extract (ECP) is a molecule obtained from algae that live in seawater in the Far East. ECP has recently been shown to have protective effects against oxidative stress. The aim of this study was to evaluate the possible protective effects of ECP on cisplatin ototoxicity. METHODS: In this study, we investigated the protective effects of ECP against cisplatin-induced cell death in mouse-derived House Ear Institute Organ of Corti (HEI-OC1) cochlear cells. Cisplatin (100 μM) and 1, 10, and 25 μM doses of ECP were administered to the cells, and the protective effects of ECP at 24 and 72 hours were investigated. Cell viability was evaluated by the WST-1 (water soluble tetrazolium salt). RESULTS: Cisplatin (100 μM) reduced cell viability in both the 24th and 72nd hour evaluation. Although the 25 μM dose of ECP showed otoprotective effects in the 24th hour, in the 72nd hour this effect disappeared. Other doses of ECP showed no otoprotective effects in the 24th and 72nd hours. CONCLUSION: Although ECP showed some protective effects in the 24th hour against cisplatin ototoxicity, these effects disappeared by the 72nd hour. Further studies using recurrent and higher doses of ECP are required."

The result showed that the original E. cava (EC) led to the highest growth effects on three LABs (Lactobacillus brevis, L. brevis; Lactobacillus pentosus, L. pentosus; Lactobacillus plantarum; L. plantarum) and it was dose-dependent manners. Also, EC, its Celluclast enzymatic (ECC) and 100% ethanol extracts (ECE) showed the anti-bacterial activities on the fish pathogenic bacteria such as (Edwardsiella tarda; E. tarda, Streptococcus iniae; S. iniae, and Vibrio harveyi; V. harveyi). Interestingly, EC induced the higher production of the secondary metabolites from L. plantarum in MRS medium. The secondary metabolites produced by EC significantly inhibited the growth of pathogen bacteria. In further in vivo study, the co-treatment of EC and L. plantarum improved the growth and mortality of E. tarda-infected zebrafish as regulating the expression of inflammatory molecules such as iNOS and COX2. Taken together, our present study suggests that the EC plays an important role as a potential prebiotic and has a protective effect against the infection caused by E. tarda injection in zebrafish. Also, our conclusion from this evidence is that EC can be used and applied as a useful prebiotic.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: In the present study, role of increasing levels of Ecklonia cava (seaweed) supplementation in diets was investigated on growth performance, coefficient of total tract apparent digestibility (CTTAD) of nutrients, serum immunoglobulins, cecal microflora and intestinal morphology of weanling pigs. METHODS: A total of 200 weaned pigs (Landrace×Yorkshire×Duroc; initial body weight 7.08±0.15 kg) were randomly allotted to 4 treatments on the basis of body weight. There were 5 replicate pens in each treatment including 10 pigs of each. Treatments were divided by dietary Ecklonia cava supplementation levels (0%, 0.05%, 0.1%, or 0.15%) in growing-finishing diets. There were 2 diet formulation phases throughout the experiment. The pigs were offered the diets ad libitum for the entire period of experiment in meal form. RESULTS: The pigs fed with increasing dietary concentrations of Ecklonia cava had linear increase (p<0.05) in the overall average daily gain, however, there were no significant differences in gain to feed ratio, CTTAD of dry matter and crude protein at both phase I and phase II. Digestibility of gross energy was linearly improved (p<0.05) in phase II. At day 28, pigs fed Ecklonia cava had greater (linear, p<0.05) Lactobacillus spp., fewer Escherichia coli (E. coli) spp. (linear, p<0.05) and a tendency to have fewer cecal Clostridium spp. (p = 0.077). The total anaerobic bacteria were not affected with supplementation of Ecklonia cava in diets. Polynomial contrasts analysis revealed that villus height of the ileum exhibited a linear increase (p<0.05) in response with the increase in the level of dietary Ecklonia cava. However, villus height of duodenum and jejunum, crypt depth, villus height to crypt depth ratio of different segments of the intestine were not affected. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that Ecklonia cava had beneficial effects on the growth performance, cecal microflora, and intestinal morphology of weanling pigs."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Ecklonia cava is a brown alga that contains various compounds, including carotenoids, fucoidans, and phlorotannins. E. cava polyphenols (ECPs) are known to increase fibroblast survival. The human dermal papilla cell (hDPC) has the properties of mesenchymal-origin fibroblasts. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to investigate the effect of ECPs on human hair growth promotion in vitro and ex vivo. METHODS: MTT assays were conducted to examine the effect of ECPs on hDPC proliferation. Hair growth was measured using ex-vivo hair follicle cultures. Real-time polymerase chain reaction was performed to evaluate the mRNA expression of various growth factors in ECP-treated hDPCs. RESULTS: Treatment with 10 µg/ml purified polyphenols from E. cava (PPE) enhanced the proliferation of hDPCs 30.3% more than in the negative control (p<0.001). Furthermore, 0.1 µg/ml PPE extended the human hair shaft 30.8% longer than the negative control over 9 days (p<0.05). Insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) mRNA expression increased 3.2-fold in hDPCs following treatment with 6 µg/ml PPE (p<0.05). Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) mRNA expression was also increased 2.0-fold by 3 µg/ml PPE (p<0.05). Treatment with 10 µg/ml PPE reduced oxidative stress in hDPCs (p<0.05). CONCLUSION: These results suggest that PPE could enhance human hair growth. This can be explained by hDPC proliferation coupled with increases in growth factors such as IGF-1 and VEGF. Reducing oxidative stress is also thought to help increase hDPCs. These favorable results suggest that PPE is a promising therapeutic candidate for hair loss."

We investigated the effect of the polyphenol-rich fraction of E. cava produced from Gijang (G-CA) on nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in high-fat diet (HFD)-fed mice. C57BL6 mice were fed a HFD for six weeks and then the HFD group was administered 300 mg/kg of G-CA extracts by oral intubation for 10 weeks. Body weight, fat mass, and serum biochemical parameters were reduced by G-CA extract treatment. MRI/MRS analysis showed that liver fat and liver volume in HFD-induced obese mice were reduced by G-CA extract treatment. Further, we analyzed hepatic gene expression related to inflammation and lipid metabolism. The mRNA expression levels of inflammatory cytokines and hepatic lipogenesis-related genes were decreased in G-CA-treated HFD mice. The mRNA expression levels of cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase 1 (CYP7A1), the key enzyme in bile acid synthesis, were dramatically increased by G-CA treatment in HFD mice. We suggest that G-CA treatment ameliorated hepatic steatosis by inhibiting inflammation and improving lipid metabolism.",

      "abstract": "The aim of the present study was to examine the cytoprotective effect of Ecklonia cava against oxidative stress in C2C12 myoblasts. The ethanol extract of E. cava (EEEC) prevented hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂)-induced inhibition of the growth of C2C12 myoblasts and exhibited scavenging activity against intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) induced by H₂O₂. EEEC treatment attenuated H2O2-induced comet tail formation and phospho-histone γH2A.X expression. Furthermore, EEEC treatment enhanced the level of the phosphorylated form of nuclear factor erythroid 2- related factor 2 (Nrf2) and its nuclear translocation, which was associated with the induction of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) and NADPH-quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO-1). Zinc protoporphyrin IX, a HO-1 competitive inhibitor, significantly abolished the protective effects of EEEC against H₂O₂-induced ROS generation and growth inhibition in C2C12 myoblasts. Transient transfection with Nrf2-specific small interfering RNA restored the elevated HO-1 and NQO-1 expression and the phosphorylation of Nrf2 to near normal levels. The EEEC treatment also induced the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), and specific inhibitors of MAPKs abolished upregulated HO-1 and NQO-1, as well as the phosphorylation of Nrf2. Taken together, these data suggest that EEEC attenuates oxidative stress by activating Nrf2-mediated HO-1 and inducing NQO-1 via the activation of MAPK signaling pathways.",

METHODS: The anti-aging effects were examined in human fibroblast (CCD986sk), mouse myoblast (C2C12), and neuroblastoma (N2a) cell models, by employing various assays such as 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl hydrate (DPPH) scavenging, hydroxyl radical-mediated oxidation, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, enzyme activity, and immunocytochemistry observation. RESULTS: Our results show that HPE combined with DE (HPE:DE) strongly scavenged DPPH radicals and protected proteins against degradation by hydroxyl radical attack. HPE:DE effectively inhibited matrix metalloproteinase-1 expression, protein kinase C alpha expression, and elastinase activity. Furthermore, HPE:DE improved the expression of cognition-related genes (choline acetyltransferase and vesicular acetylcholine transporter). These events may proactively contribute to retard the aging processes and the abrupt physiological changes probably induced by mitochondrial dysfunction with aging. CONCLUSIONS: Based on these findings, we conclude that the combined treatment of HPE:DE may be useful for anti-aging therapy in which the accumulation of oxidative damage is the main driving force.",

Here, we examined the effects of ECP on the activities of alcohol-metabolizing enzymes and their regulating mechanisms in ethanol-treated hepatocytes. Isolated hepatocytes were incubated with or without 100 mM ethanol. ECP was dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide. ECP was added to cultured cells that had been incubated with or without ethanol. The cells were incubated for 0-24 h. In cultured hepatocytes, the ECP treatment with ethanol inhibited cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1) expression and activity, which is related to the production of ROS when large quantities of ethanol are oxidized. On the other hand, ECP treatment with ethanol increased the activity of alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) and aldehyde dehydrogenase. These changes in activities of CYP2E1 and ADH were suppressed by treatment with H89, an inhibitor of protein kinase A. ECP treatment with ethanol enhanced cyclic AMP concentrations compared with those of control cells. ECP may be a candidate for preventing ethanol-induced liver injury via regulating alcohol metabolic enzymes in a cyclic AMP-dependent manner.",

For butyrylcholinesterase, a new target for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, phlorofucofuroeckol-A (PFF-A), showed a particularly potent inhibitory activity (IC50 0.95 μM), which is over 100-fold greater than for acetylcholinesterase. These compounds inhibited glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta, which is related to the formation of hyperphosphorylated tau and generation Aβ. Bieckol and PFF-A inhibited amyloid precursor protein biosynthesis. PFF-A also showed very strong β-secretase inhibitory activity with IC50 of submicromole.

Eighty pre-diabetic male and female adults were enrolled in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial with parallel-group design. Subjects were randomly allocated into two groups designated as placebo and AG-dieckol (1500 mg per day). Compared with the placebo group, the AG-dieckol group showed a significant decrease in postprandial glucose levels after 12 weeks. The AG-dieckol group also showed a significant decrease in insulin and C-peptide levels after 12 weeks, but there was no significant difference between the AG-dieckol and placebo groups. There were no significant adverse events related to the consumption of AG-dieckol, and biochemical and hematological parameters were maintained within the normal range during the intervention period. In conclusion, these results demonstrate that AG-dieckol supplementation significantly contributes to lowering postprandial hyperglycemia and in reducing insulin resistance.

Triphlorethol-A significantly decreased the levels of 8-oxoG induced by H2O2, and this correlated with increases in OGG1 mRNA and OGG1 protein levels. Furthermore, siOGG1-transfected cell attenuated the protective effect of triphlorethol-A against H2O2 treatment. Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) is a transcription factor for OGG1, and Nrf2 combines with small Maf proteins in the nucleus to bind to antioxidant response elements (ARE) in the upstream promoter region of the OGG1 gene. Triphlorethol-A restored the expression of nuclear Nrf2, small Maf protein, and the Nrf2-Maf complex, all of which were reduced by oxidative stress. Furthermore, triphlorethol-A increased Nrf2 binding to ARE sequences and the resulting OGG1 promoter activity, both of which were also reduced by oxidative stress. The levels of the phosphorylated forms of Akt kinase, downstream of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), and Erk, which are regulators of OGG1, were sharply decreased by oxidative stress, but these decreases were prevented by triphlorethol-A. Specific PI3K, Akt, and Erk inhibitors abolished the cytoprotective effects of triphlorethol-A, suggesting that OGG1 induction by triphlorethol-A involves the PI3K/Akt and Erk pathways. Taken together, these data indicate that by activating the DNA repair system, triphlorethol-A exerts protective effects against DNA base damage induced by oxidative stress.",

In addition, BKE reduced lipid peroxidation, intracellular reactive oxygen species and nitric oxide levels in a dose dependent manner. Treatment with high glucose concentrations also induced the overexpression of inducible nitric oxide synthase, cyclooxygenase-2 and NF-κB proteins in HUVECs, but BKE treatment significantly reduced the overexpression of these proteins.

In the present study, we investigated the anti-tumor activity of dieckol and its molecular mechanism in ovarian cancer cells and in a xenograft mouse model . METHODS: MTT assay, PI staining, and PI and Annexin double staining were performed to study cell cytotoxicity, cell cycle distribution, and apoptosis. We also investigated reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and protein expression using flow cytometry and Western blot analysis, respectively. Anti-tumor effects of dieckol were evaluated in SKOV3 tumor xenograft model. RESULTS: We found that the E. cava extract and its phlorotannins have cytotoxic effects on A2780 and SKOV3 ovarian cancer cells. Dieckol induced the apoptosis of SKOV3 cells and suppressed tumor growth without any significant adverse effect in the SKOV3-bearing mouse model. Dieckol triggered the activation of caspase-8, caspase-9, and caspase-3, and pretreatment with caspase inhibitors neutralized the pro-apoptotic activity of dieckol. Furthermore, treatment with dieckol caused mitochondrial dysfunction and suppressed the levels of anti-apoptotic proteins. We further demonstrated that dieckol induced an increase in intracellular ROS, and the antioxidant N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) significantly reversed the caspase activation, cytochrome c release, Bcl-2 downregulation, and apoptosis that were caused by dieckol. Moreover, dieckol inhibited the activity of AKT and p38, and overexpression of AKT and p38, at least in part, reversed dieckol-induced apoptosis in SKOV3 cells. CONCLUSION: These data suggest that dieckol suppresses ovarian cancer cell growth by inducing caspase-dependent apoptosis via ROS production and the regulation of AKT and p38 signaling.",

The protective effects of 6,6'-bieckol (BEK), one of phlorotannin compound purified from Ecklonia cava against high-glucose-induced oxidative stress was investigated using human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), which is susceptible to oxidative stress. High glucose (30 mM) treatment induced HUVECs' cell death, but BEK, at concentration 10 or 50 μg/ml, significantly inhibited the high-glucose-induced cytotoxicity. Furthermore, treatment with BEK dose-dependently decreased thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, and nitric oxide level increased by high glucose. In addition, high glucose levels induced the overexpressions of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) proteins in HUVECs, but BEK treatment reduced the overexpressions of these proteins. These findings indicate that BEK is a potential therapeutic agent that will prevent diabetic endothelial dysfunction and related complications.",

To evaluate pain-related behavior, we performed the mechanical withdrawal threshold (MWT) and thermal hypersensitivity tests measured by von Frey filaments and a hot/cold plate analgesia meter. Pain-related behavior was also determined through analysis of ultrasonic vocalization. The results of experiments showed MWT values of the group that was treated with E. cava extracts by 300 mg/kg significantly increased; on the contrary, number of ultrasonic distress vocalization of the treated group was reduced at 6 h and 24 h after plantar incision operation (62.8%, p < 0.05). Moreover, E. cava 300 mg/kg treated group increased the paw withdrawal latency in hot-and cold-plate tests in the plantar incision rats. After 15 days of continuous treatment with E. cava extracts at 300 mg/kg, the treated group showed significantly alleviated SNI-induced hypersensitivity response by MWT compared with the control group. In conclusion, these results suggest that E. cava extracts have potential analgesic effects in the case of postoperative pain and neuropathic pain in rats.",

On the other hand, LPS-mediated NF-κB activity was inhibited by dieckol treatment. Moreover, results revealed that dieckol diminished LPS-mediated p65 nuclear translocation or IκBα phosphorylation dose-dependently, and reduced LPS-induced phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), significantly p38MAPK.

The crude fucoidan extract and purified fractions (EF1, EF2, and EF3) consisted mostly of different ratios of neutral sugars, proteins, sulfates, uronic acids, and their monosaccharide compositions were also significantly different. The backbone of the most immunoenhancing fraction, EF2, was mainly linked by (1→3)-linked fucopyranosyl and (1→4)-linked mannopyranosyl residues with sulfates at C-4 of fucopyranosyl units. The molecular weights of the crude fucoidan extract and purified fractions ranged from 8.3×10(3) to 442.6×10(3)g/mol. The crude extract, EF1 and EF2 stimulated RAW264.7 cells to produce considerable amounts of nitric oxide and cytokines.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Previous studies have reported the protective effects on skin elasticity of the edible marine seaweed Ecklonia cava, which acts through regulation of both antioxidative and anti-inflammatory responses. AIM: We evaluated the effect of E. cava and one of its components, dioxinodehydroeckol, on hair-shaft growth in cultured human hair follicles and on hair growth in mice. METHODS: The MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay was used to check cell viability of human dermal papilla cells (DPCs) and outer root sheath (ORS) cells after treatment with E. cava and its metabolite, dioxinodehydroeckol. Hair-shaft growth was measured using the in vitro hair-follicle organ-culture system, in the presence or absence of E. cava and dioxinodehydroeckol. Anagen induction activity was examined by topical application of E. cava to the dorsal skin of C57BL/6 mice. Insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1 expression was measured by reverse transcriptase PCR and ELISA. RESULTS: The proliferation activity was found to be highest for the ethyl acetate-soluble fraction of E. cava (EAFE) in DPCs and in ORS cells. Treatment with EAFE resulted in elongation of the hair shaft in cultured human hair follicles, and promoted transition of the hair cycle from the telogen to the anagen phase in the dorsal skin of C57BL/6 mice. In addition, EAFE induced an increase in IGF-1 expression in DPCs. Dioxinodehydroeckol, a component of E. cava, induced elongation of the hair shaft, an increase in proliferation of DPCs and ORS cells, and an increase in expression of IGF-1 in DPCs. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that E. cava containing dioxinodehydroeckol promotes hair growth through stimulation of DPCs and ORS cells.",

In this study, we evaluated the antiviral activity of five phlorotannins isolated from Ecklonia cava (E. cava) against PEDV. In vitro antiviral activity was tested using two different assay strategies: (1) blockage of the binding of virus to cells (simultaneous-treatment assay) and (2) inhibition of viral replication (post-treatment assay). In simultaneous-treatment assay, compounds 2-5 except compound 1 exhibited antiviral activities of a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC₅₀) with the ranging from 10.8 ± 1.4 to 22.5 ± 2.2 μM against PEDV. Compounds 1-5 were completely blocked binding of viral spike protein to sialic acids at less than 36.6 μM concentrations by hemagglutination inhibition. Moreover, compounds 4 and 5 of five phlorotannins inhibited viral replication with IC₅₀ values of 12.2 ± 2.8 and 14.6 ± 1.3 μM in the post-treatment assay, respectively. During virus replication steps, compounds 4 and 5 exhibited stronger inhibition of viral RNA and viral protein synthesis in late stages (18 and 24 h) than in early stages (6 and 12 h). Interestingly, compounds 4 and 5 inhibited both viral entry by hemagglutination inhibition and viral replication by inhibition of viral RNA and viral protein synthesis, but not viral protease. These results suggest that compounds isolated from E. cava have strong antiviral activity against PEDV, inhibiting viral entry and/or viral replication, and may be developed into natural therapeutic drugs against coronavirus infection.",

Therefore, the present study was designed to assess in vivo anti-inflammatory effect of fucoidan extracted from E. cava (ECF) using tail-cutting-induced and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated zebrafish model. Treating zebrafish model with tail-cutting and LPS-treatment significantly increased the ROS and NO level. However, ECF inhibited this tail-cutting-induced and LPS-stimulated ROS and NO generation. These results show that ECF alleviated inflammation by inhibiting the ROS and NO generation induced by tail-cutting and LPS-treatment. In addition, ECF has a protective effect against the toxicity induced by LPS exposure in zebrafish embryos. This outcome could explain the potential anti-inflammatory activity of ECF, which might have a beneficial effect during the treatment of inflammatory diseases.",

As a noncomparative study, forty-six individuals (M:F=22:24, mean age=54±11 years) with fasting total cholesterol concentration >240 mg/dL or low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) concentration >130 mg/dL were enrolled. Hip circumference (100±7 cm vs. 98±7 cm, P<.01), total cholesterol (244±25 mg/dL vs. 225±37 mg/dL, P<.01), LDL-C (161±24 mg/dL vs. 146±34 mg/dL, P<.01), and C-reactive protein (2.51±3.55 mg/L vs. 1.37±1.32 mg/L, P<.05) were significantly decreased without significant adverse effect. A differential assessment according to the presence [MetS(+) group, n=18] and absence [MetS(-) group, n=28] of MetS showed that Hb(A1c) decreased significantly following 12-week Seapolynol treatment in the MetS(+) compared with the MetS(-) group (-0.3%±0.5% vs. 0.1%±0.3%, P<.01). In conclusion, although our results showed that Seapolynol treatment is effective and safe without significant adverse events or abnormal laboratory findings during a 12-week period in individuals with hypercholesterolemia, more research in a larger population with a longer-term follow-up period in a randomized placebo-controlled study is needed to confirm the results.",

We have previously reported that the brown algae Ecklonia cava, which has anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory functions, decreased Aβ production and further aggregation in HEK293 cells expressing the APP Swedish mutation. Here, we show the reduction mechanism of Aβ production using the butanol extract of Ecklonia cava through the examination of expression and activity of alpha-, beta-, and gamma-secretase. Treatment with the extract resulted in the activation of alpha-secretase with a contrasting decrease in its mRNA and protein expression. This activation was consistent with the translocation of the extract into the plasma membrane of the secretase. Gamma-secretase activity was lowered by E. cava, and this effect may be due to the decreased expression of PSEN1 mRNA and protein. In addition, the basal nuclear location of PSEN1, which may affect chromosome missegregation in neurodegenerative disease, was reduced by the extract, despite the significance of this finding remains unclear. Taken together, these results led us to conclude that E. cava regulated the expression and activity of gamma-secretase and alpha-secretase, leading to a reduction in Aβ production by the stable cells. Our data indicate that E. cava is a novel natural-product candidate for AD treatment, although further in vivo studies are needed.",

      "abstract": "Pancreatic β cells are very sensitive to oxidative stress and this might play an important role in β cell death with diabetes. The protective effect of dieckol, one of the phlorotannin polyphenol compounds purified from Ecklonia cava (E. cava), against high glucose-induced oxidative stress was investigated by using rat insulinoma cells. A high-glucose (30 mM) treatment induced the death of rat insulinoma cells, but dieckol, at a concentration 17.5 or 70 µM, significantly inhibited the high-glucose induced glucotoxicity. Treatment with dieckol also dose-dependently reduced thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), the generation of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), and the nitric oxide level increased by a high glucose concentration. In addition, the dieckol treatment increased the activities of antioxidative enzymes including catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-px) in high glucose-pretreated rat insulinoma cells. Dieckol protected rat insulinoma cells damage under high glucose conditions. These effects were mediated by suppressing apoptosis and were associated with increased anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 expression, and reduced pro-apoptotic cleaved caspase-3 expression. These findings indicate that dieckol might be useful as a potential pharmaceutical agent to protect against the glucotoxicity caused by hyperglycemia-induced oxidative stress associated with diabetes.",

However, the effects of E. cava extracts on diet-induced obesity and type 2 diabetes have not been specifically examined. We investigated the effects of E. cava on body weight, fat content, and hyperglycemia in high-fat diet- (HFD) induced obese mice and sought the mechanisms involved. C57BL/6 male mice were fed a HFD (60% fat) diet or normal chow. After 3 weeks, the HFD diet group was given extracts (200 mg/kg) of E. cava harvested from Jeju (CA) or Gijang (G-CA), Korea or PBS by oral intubation for 8 weeks. Body weights were measured weekly. Blood glucose and glucose tolerance were measured at 7 weeks, and fat pad content and mRNA expression of adipogenic genes and inflammatory cytokines were measured after 8 weeks of treatment. G-CA was effective in reducing body weight gain, body fat, and hyperglycemia and improving glucose tolerance as compared with PBS-HFD mice. The mRNA expression of adipogenic genes was increased, and mRNA expression of inflammatory cytokines and macrophage marker gene was decreased in G-CA-treated obese mice. We suggest that G-CA reduces obesity and glucose levels by anti-inflammatory actions and improvement of lipid metabolism."

      "abstract": "Phlorotannins (marine algal polyphenols) have been reported to exhibit beneficial biological activities, serving as both antioxidants and anti-inflammatory agents. Among marine algae, Ecklonia cava, a member of the Laminariaceae, is a very popular food regarded as healthy in Korea and Japan. Recently, benefits afforded by phlorotannins in the treatment of various clinical conditions have been reported, but any therapeutic effects of such materials in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases such as stroke remain unclear. Also, the mechanisms of action of the algal components remain poorly understood. In the present in vivo study, administration of Ecklonia cava polyphenols (ECP) at 10 mg/kg and 50 mg/kg intraperitoneally (i.p.) significantly decreased infarct size and the extent of brain edema in the rat after induction of transient focal ischemia via middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). Further, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end-labeling (TUNEL) assay revealed dose-dependent blockage of neuronal apoptosis upon intravenous ECP treatment. Neurobehavioral tests performed over the 6 days after MCAO revealed a reduction in neurological motor performance in control animals, but administration of ECP (50 mg/kg i.p.) prevented this decline. In vitro, a significant neuroprotective effect of ECP was evident when cell viability was assayed after induction of H(2)O(2)-mediated oxidative stress, upon retinoic acid treatment, in the differentiated neuroblastoma cell line SH-SY5Y. Interestingly, ECP blocked the rise in cytosolic calcium, in a dose-dependent manner, in differentiated SH-SY5Y cells exposed to H(2)O(2). Together, the results suggest that ECP exerts neuroprotective effects in the focally ischemic brain by reducing Ca(2+)-mediated neurotoxicity."

      "abstract": "This study was conducted to evaluate the effect of Ecklonia cava, a marine alga native to Jeju Island in Korea, on the promotion of hair growth. When vibrissa follicles were cultured in the presence of E. cava enzymatic extract (which contains more than 35% of dieckol) for 21 days, E. cava enzymatic extract increased hair-fiber length. In addition, after topical application of the 0.5% E. cava enzymatic extract onto the back of C57BL/6 mice, anagen progression of the hair-shaft was induced. The treatment with E. cava enzymatic extract resulted in the proliferation of immortalized vibrissa dermal papilla cells (DPC). Especially, dieckol, among the isolated compounds from the E. cava enzymatic extract, showed activity that increased the proliferation of DPC. When NIH3T3 fibroblasts were treated with the E. cava enzymatic extract and the isolated compounds from the E. cava enzymatic extract, the E. cava enzymatic extract increased the proliferation of NIH3T3 fibroblasts, but the isolated compounds such as eckol, dieckol, phloroglucinol and triphlorethol-A did not affect the proliferation of NIH3T3 fibroblasts. On the other hand, the E. cava enzymatic extract and dieckol significantly inhibited 5α-reductase activity. These results suggest that dieckol from E. cava can stimulate hair growth by the proliferation of DPC and/or the inhibition of 5α-reductase activity.",

Intestinal Na(+)-dependent glucose uptake (SGU) and Na(+)-dependent glucose transporter 1 (SGLT1) protein expression was determined using brush border membrane vesicles (BBMVs). Glucose-induced insulin secretion was examined in pancreatic β-islet cells. The antihyperglycemic effects of EC, SGU, and SGLT1 expression were determined in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic mice. Results. Methanol extract of EC markedly inhibited intestinal SGU of BBMV with the IC(50) value of 345 μg/mL. SGLT1 protein expression was dose dependently down regulated with EC treatment. Furthermore, insulinotrophic effect of EC extract was observed at high glucose media in isolated pancreatic β-islet cells in vitro. We next conducted the antihyperglycemic effect of EC in STZ-diabetic mice. EC supplementation markedly suppressed SGU and SGLT1 abundance in BBMV from STZ mice. Furthermore, plasma insulin level was increased by EC treatment in diabetic mice. As a result, EC supplementation improved postprandial glucose regulation, assessed by oral glucose tolerance test, in diabetic mice. Conclusion. These results suggest that EC play a role in controlling dietary glucose absorption at the intestine and insulinotrophic action at the pancreas contributing blood glucose homeostasis in diabetic condition."

For that purpose, we prepared an enzymatic hydrolysate from E. cava (EHE) by using the carbohydrase, Celluclast. High-glucose (30 mM) treatment induced glucotoxicity, whereas EHE prevented cells from high glucose-induced damage then restoring cell viability was significantly increased. Furthermore, lipid peroxidation, intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and nitric oxide (NO) were overproduced as the result of the treatment by high glucose; however, these lipid peroxidation, ROS and NO generations were effectively inhibited by addition of EHE in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, EHE treatment increased activities of antioxidant enzymes including catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-px) in high glucose pretreated INS-1 pancreatic β-cells. EHE slightly reduced the expression of pro-apoptotic protein Bax induced by high glucose but increased the expression of Bcl-2, an anti-apoptotic protein.

METHODS: Diabetes was induced by a single intraperitoneal injection of STZ (90 mg/kg). Normal and diabetic mice were treated with 0%, 3%, and 5% EC diet for 4 weeks. Serum glucose and insulin concentrations, serum lipid profile, oral glucose tolerance test, and liver and pancreatic β-cell histopathological observations were performed. In addition, in vitro glucose-induced insulin secretion was determined using pancreatic β-islet cells. RESULTS: EC supplementation significantly and dose-dependently decreased serum glucose concentration, and improved glucose homeostasis in diabetic mice by preventing loss of β-cell mass resulting in increase of insulin secretion. The triglyceride and total cholesterol concentrations in the serum and liver were markedly reduced by EC treatment in STZ-diabetic mice. Moreover, LDL-, and HDL-cholesterol levels were ameliorated in EC supplemented diabetic mice. Liver steatosis induced by STZ was ameliorated by EC supplementation. Furthermore, in vitro insulinotrophic effect of EC extract was observed in pancreatic β-islets. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that EC is a potent and efficacious hypoglycemic and hypolipidemic agent, and prevents the loss of β-cell mass resulting in increase of insulin secretary capacity.",

We examined the effect of an Ecklonia cava extract on ethanol-induced liver injury. METHODS: Isolated hepatocytes and hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) were incubated with ethanol. Ecklonia cava polyphenol (ECP) was added to the cultures that had been incubated with ethanol. Male Wistar rats were fed a diet that included 0.02% or 0.2% ECP or no ECP. For a period of 3 weeks, the animals were given drinking water containing 5% ethanol and were also treated with carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) (0.1 ml/kg of body weight). RESULTS: In the cultured hepatocytes, the ECP treatment suppressed the ethanol-induced increase in cell death by maintaining intracellular glutathione (GSH) levels. In HSCs, ECP treatment suppressed the ethanol-induced increases in type I collagen and α-smooth muscle actin expression by maintaining intracellular levels of reactive oxygen species and GSH. We examined the effects of ECP on serum AST and ALT activity, as well as the progression of liver fibrosis in rats treated with ethanol and CCl4. ECP treatment suppressed plasma AST and ALT activities in the ethanol- and CCl4-treated rats. ECP treatment fully protected the rats against ethanol- and CCl4-induced liver injury.

A prevalence of type 2 diabetes and a high body mass index in cryptogenic cirrhosis may imply that obesity leads to cirrhosis. Here, we examined the effects of an extract of Ecklonia cava, a brown algae, on the activation of high glucose-induced hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), key players in hepatic fibrosis. Isolated HSCs were incubated with or without a high glucose concentration. Ecklonia cava extract (ECE) was added to the culture simultaneously with the high glucose. Treatment with high glucose stimulated expression of type I collagen and α-smooth muscle actin, which are markers of activation in HSCs, in a dose-dependent manner. The activation of high glucose-treated HSCs was suppressed by the ECE. An increase in the formation of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and a decrease in intracellular glutathione levels were observed soon after treatment with high glucose, and these changes were suppressed by the simultaneous addition of ECE. High glucose levels stimulated the secretion of bioactive transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) from the cells, and the stimulation was also suppressed by treating the HSCs with ECE. These results suggest that the suppression of high glucose-induced HSC activation by ECE is mediated through the inhibition of ROS and/or GSH and the downregulation of TGF-β secretion. ECE is useful for preventing the development of diabetic liver fibrosis.",

Dieckol shows both antitumor and antioxidant activity and thus is of special interest for the development of chemopreventive and chemotherapeutic agents against cancer. However, the mechanism by which dieckol exerts its antitumor activity is poorly understood. Here, we show that dieckol, derived from E. cava, inhibits migration and invasion of HT1080 cells by scavenging intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS). H2O2 or integrin signal-mediated ROS generation increases migration and invasion of HT1080 cells, which correlates with Rac1 activation and increased expression and phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK). Rac1 activation is required for ROS generation. Depletion of FAK by siRNA suppresses Rac1-ROS-induced cell migration and invasion. Dieckol treatment attenuated intracellular ROS levels and activation of Rac1 as well as expression and phosphorylation of FAK. Dieckol treatment also decreases complex formation of FAK-Src-p130C as and expression of MMP2, 9, and 13. These results suggest that the Rac1-ROS-linked cascade enhances migration and invasion of HT1080 cells by inducing expression of MMPs through activation of the FAK signaling pathway, whereas dieckol downregulates FAK signaling through scavenging intracellular ROS. This finding provides new insights into the mechanisms by which dieckol is able to suppress human cancer progresssion and metastasis. Therefore, we suggest that dieckol is a potential therapeutic agent for cancer treatment.",

      "abstract": "Marine plants have been reported to possess various pharmacological properties; however, there have been few reports on their neuropharmacological effects. Terrestrial plants have depressive effects on the central nervous system (CNS) because of their polyphenols which make them effective as anticonvulsants and sleep inducers. We investigated in this study the depressive effects of the polyphenol-rich brown seaweed, Ecklonia cava (EC), on CNS. An EC enzymatic extract (ECEE) showed significant anticonvulsive (>500 mg/kg) and sleep-inducing (>500 mg/kg) effects on the respective mice seizure induced by picrotoxin and on the mice sleep induced by pentobarbital. The phlorotannin-rich fraction (PTRF) from ECEE significantly potentiated the pentobarbital-induced sleep at >50 mg/kg. PTRF had binding activity to the gamma aminobutyric acid type A (GABA(A))-benzodiazepine (BZD) receptors. The sleep-inducing effects of diazepam (DZP, a well-known GABA(A)-BZD agonist), ECEE, and PTRF were completely blocked by flumazenil, a well-known antagonist of GABA(A)-BZD receptors. These results imply that ECEE produced depressive effects on CNS by positive allosteric modulation of its phlorotannins on GABA(A)-BZD receptors like DZP. Our study proposes EC as a candidate for the effective treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders such as anxiety and insomnia.",

ECE treatment significantly suppressed the migration and invasion of A549 cells in a concentration-dependent manner. It also strongly down-regulated the matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 activity of the cancer cells by gelatin zymography assay. For elucidating its mechanism of action in cancer cell metastasis, ECE was further investigated for various cell signalling pathways, including JNK, ERK, p38, and Akt. In this, ECE showed an anti-metastatic effect in a concentration- and time-dependent manner by the mechanism of suppression of Akt and p38, but not JNK and ERK. These results, for the first time, suggest that ECE (a polyphenol-enriched, highly anti-oxidative fraction of brown alga, E. cava) may have therapeutic potential in metastatic lung cancer, based on its strong inhibitory effects on the migration and invasiveness of A549 human lung adenocarcinoma cells."

Ninety-seven overweight male and female adults (average age 40.5 ± 9.2 yr and body mass index (BMI) of 26.5 ± 1.6 kg/m²) were enrolled in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial with parallel-group design. Subjects were randomly allocated into three groups designated as PC (placebo), LD (low-dose, 72 mg-ECP/day) and HD (high-dose, 144 mg-ECP/day). Both LD and HD groups showed significant decreases in BMI, body fat ratio, waist circumference, waist/hip ratio, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, total cholesterol/high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and atherogenic index (AI) after 12 weeks, as compared with the placebo group. The HD group also showed a significant increase in serum HDL cholesterol as compared with the placebo group. Only the HD group showed significant decreases in serum glucose and systolic blood pressure after 12 weeks. There was no significant adverse event related with ingestion of ECP, and serum biochemical and hematological parameters were maintained within normal range during the intervention period. In conclusion, these results demonstrated that ECP supplementation significantly contributed to lowering body fat and serum lipid parameters such as total and LDL cholesterols with dose dependence. Further studies using different populations, dosages or biological markers are highly recommended to better understand the physiological features of this polyphenol.",

We found that each EC extract inhibits LPS induced barrier permeability, expression of cell adhesion molecules, monocytes adhesion, and transendothelial migration to human endothelial cells. Further studies revealed that EC extracts suppress the production of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and activation of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB). Particularly, the antiinflammatory effects of ethyl acetate (EtOAc) and butanol (n-BuOH) extracts were better than those of other extracts.

In the present study, we investigated whether the brown alga Ecklonia cava has protective effects against high glucose-induced oxidative stress in Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). For that purpose, we prepared an enzymatic digest from E. cava (ECC) by using the carbohydrate, Celluclast. RESULTS: High glucose treatment induced HUVECs cell death, but ECC, at a concentration of 10 or 100 microg mL(-1), significantly inhibited the high glucose-induced cytotoxicity. Furthermore, treatment with ECC dose-dependently decreased thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), intracellular generation of reactive oxygen species, and the nitric oxide level increased by high glucose. In addition, ECC treatment increased activities of antioxidant enzymes including catalase, superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase in high-glucose pretreated HUVECs. High glucose levels induced the overexpression of inducible nitric oxide synthase, cyclooxygenase-2 and nuclear factor-kappa B proteins in HUVECs, but ECC treatment reduced the overexpression of these proteins. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that ECC is a potential therapeutic agent that will reduce the damage caused by hyperglycaemia-induced oxidative stress associated with diabetes.",

Moreover, the elevation of plasma ALT in diabetic rats was dramatically restored near to normal range by the treatment of ECM, whereas AST level was not meaningfully altered in any group throughout the experiment. The characteristic indications of diabetes, such as polyphagia and polydipsia, were greatly improved by ECM treatment as well. The mechanism of action of ECM appears to be, at least partially, mediated by the activation of both AMP-activated protein kinase/ACC and PI-3 kinase/Akt signal pathways.

The ethanolic (EtOH) extract and ethyl acetate (EtOAc) soluble fraction obtained from E. cava evidenced a marked inhibitory effect on mushroom tyrosinase at a concentration of 50 μg/mL. Repeated column chromatography of the active EtOAc fraction resulted in the isolation of three phlorotannins. Their structures were elucidated on the basis of spectroscopic techniques [1D and 2D nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)] and characterized as phloroglucinol (1), dioxinodehydroeckol (2), and 7-phloroeckol (3), respectively. Among the compounds, 7-phloroeckol (3) evidenced more potent tyrosinase inhibitory effect with an IC(50) value of 0.85 μM than arbutin (IC(50) = 243.16 μM) and kojic acid (IC(50) = 40.28 μM), which were used as positive controls. Lineweaver-Burk plots suggest that 7-phloroeckol plays as a noncompetitive inhibitor against tyrosinase. Furthermore, these compounds were evaluated for their inhibitory effects on IBMX-induced melanin formation in B16F10 melanoma cells. Treatment with 7-phloroeckol (6.25-100 μM) resulted in a significant inhibition of melanin production in the melanoma cells.

However, the molecular mechanisms underlying its anti-inflammatory action remain unclear. In the current study, we attempted to determine whether pretreatment with EC induces a significant inhibition of anti-inflammatory activity in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated murine BV2 microglia. Our results indicate that EC inhibits LPS-induced nitric oxide (NO) and prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) production in a concentration-dependent manner and inhibits inducible nitric oxide (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 in BV2 microglia without significant cytotoxicity. EC treatment significantly reduced nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) translocation and DNA-binding in LPS-stimulated BV2 microglia. This effect was mediated through the inhibition of the degradation of the inhibitor kappaB and by inhibition of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) phosphorylation, at least in part by inhibiting the generation of reactive oxygen species. Our data also indicate that EC extracts exert anti-inflammatory effects by suppressing proinflammatory cytokines. Collectively, these results suggest that EC suppresses the induction of cytokines by LPS, as well as iNOS and COX-2 expression, by blocking NF-kappaB and MAPK activation. These findings provide mechanistic insights into the anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective actions of EC in BV2 microglia.",

      "abstract": "We investigated whether the brown seaweed Alariaceae Ecklonia cava (E. cava) has immunological effects on splenocytes in vitro. For that purpose, we prepared an enzymatic extract from E. cava (ECK) by using the protease, Kojizyme. Here, ECK administered to ICR mice dramatically enhanced the proliferation of their splenocytes and increased the number of their lymphocytes, monocytes and granulocytes. In flow cytometry assays performed to identify in detail the specific phenotypes of these proliferating cells after ECK treatment, the numbers of CD4(+) T cells, CD8(+) T cells and CD45R/B220(+) B cells increased significantly compared to those in untreated controls. In addition, the mRNA expression and production level of Th1-type cytokines, i.e., TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma, were down-regulated, whereas those of Th2-type cytokines, i.e., IL-4 and IL-10, were up-regulated by ECK. Overall, this dramatic increase in numbers of splenocytes indicated that ECK could induce these cells to proliferate and could regulate the production of Th1- as well as Th2-type cytokines in immune cells. These results suggest that ECK has the immunomodulatory ability to activate the anti-inflammatory response and/or suppress the proinflammatory response, thereby endorsing its usefulness as therapy for diseases of the immune system.",

      "abstract": "Ecklonia cava (EC) is a brown alga that evidences radical scavenging activity, bactericidal activity, tyrosinase inhibitory activity, and protease inhibitory activity. However, its anti-allergic effects remain poorly understood. In the current study, we attempted to determine whether pretreatment with EC induces a significant inhibition of asthmatic reactions in a mouse asthma model. Mice sensitized and challenged with ovalbumin (OVA) evidenced typical asthmatic reactions, as follows: an increase in the number of eosinophils in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid; a marked influx of inflammatory cells into the lung around blood vessels and airways, and airway luminal narrowing; the development of airway hyperresponsiveness; the detection of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and Th2 cytokines, including IL-4 and IL-5 in the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid; and the detection of allergen-specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) in the serum. However, the administration of EC extract prior to the final airway OVA challenge resulted in a significant inhibition of all asthmatic reactions. We also demonstrated that EC extracts treatment resulted in significant reductions on matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) and Suppressor of cytokine signaling-3 (SOCS-3) expression and a reduction in the increased eosinophil peroxidase (EPO) activity. The treatment of animals with EC extracts resulted in a significant reduction in the concentrations of the Th2 cytokine (IL-4 and IL-5) in the airways, without any concomitant increase in the concentration of Th1 cytokines. These findings indicate that EC extracts may prove useful as an adjuvant therapy for allergic airway reactions via the inhibition of the Th2 response. Accordingly, this study may provide evidence that EC extract performs a critical function in the amelioration of the pathogenetic process of asthma in mice.",
