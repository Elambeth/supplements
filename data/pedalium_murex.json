      "abstract": "Pedalium murex commonly known as (large caltrops, bara gokhru) is a medicinal plant with potential therapeutic benefits. Hyperglycemia, a hallmark of diabetes, affects millions worldwide. Research on its leaf ethanol extract demonstrates potential for managing hyperglycemia in vitro and in vivo. Phytochemical analysis revealed secondary metabolites, including tannins, alkaloids, saponins, flavonoids, and polyphenols, with high levels of total flavonoids (287.5 ± 17.3 μg QEq./mg) and polyphenols (327.5 ± 17.2 μg QEq./mg). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) confirmed the granular nature of synthesized silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) with a size range of 20-40 nm, while transmission electron microscopy (TEM) showed spherical AgNPs (20-50 nm). Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) identified silver (66.75 %), carbon (22.02 %), and oxygen (11.23 %) as the primary components. The extract effectively neutralized DPPH-free radicals (39.57 ± 4.77 %), while the AgNPs showed greater efficacy (68.23 ± 5.37 %). Superoxide radical (O2•-) reduction was significant for both the extract (59.33 ± 0.17 %) and AgNPs (38.73 ± 0.21 %), highlighting potent antioxidant properties. Hydroxyl radical (●OH) scavenging was higher for the extract (63.72 ± 0.17 %) than for AgNPs alone (36.71 ± 0.29 %). The AgNPs showed significant antimicrobial activity, with inhibition zones of 16.27 ± 0.18 mm against Staphylococcus aureus and 11.23 ± 0.17 mm against Candida albicans at 80 μg/mL. In toxicity studies, P. murex-AgNPs were well tolerated in mice. In hyperlipidemic mice, treatment with P. murex-AgNPs (350 mg/kg and 700 mg/kg) significantly reduced cholesterol, triglycerides, and LDL-c levels without affecting HDL-c. These findings provide valuable insights into the therapeutic potential of P. murex-AgNPs for the treatment of hyperlipidemia and diabetes."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Pedalium murex (P. murex) is used in folk medicine for treatment of male infertility. However, scientific data on its safety are limited. OBJECTIVE: This study was carried out to assess the acute and repeated dose 28-day oral toxicity of the aqueous extracts from P. murex leafy stem and fruit in Wistar rats. METHODS: The acute toxicity test was performed according to the line 423 of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) guidelines. The rats were randomly divided into three groups (n = 3). The control group received distilled water, while the experimental groups were given at a single dose, 5000 mg/kg of each extract. The repeated dose 28-day oral toxicity was performed according to the line 407 of the OECD guidelines. 35 rats divided into 7 groups of 5 male rats each were daily treated for 28 days with each extract at 200 mg/kg, 400 mg/kg, and 800 mg/kg, respectively. The in-life parameters were recorded during the follow-up. At the end of this study, organ weights, hematology, biochemistry, and histology parameters were analyzed. RESULTS: In the acute oral toxicity test, there was no morbidity or mortality related to the treatments. Both extracts belong therefore to category 5 of the globally harmonized system (GHS) of classification. In the repeated dose 28-day oral toxicity test, both extracts did not alter animal's behavior. However, both extract administration led to proteinuria and renal damages. CONCLUSION: P. murex leafy stem and fruit aqueous extracts exhibited potential nephrotoxicity. Therefore, care should be taken when they are used over an extended period."

The current study aims to study the effect of ethyl acetate extract of P. murex (EAEP) and its fractionated compound pedalitin against urease production and UreC gene expression in Proteus mirabilis. The selected reference strain Proteus mirabilis (MTCC 425) and the isolates culture of Proteus mirabilis were subjected to study the antibacterial efficacy of P. murex. Expression analysis of P. mirabilis urease gene was successfully done by QPCR. The ethyl acetate extract effectively inhibit the reference Proteus mirabilis and bacterial isolates of Proteus mirabilis in the clinical samples studied. EAEP has showed more potent activity (56.7%) against urease enzyme and pedalitin also exhibited potent activity (30.1%). Using qPCR, the expression of UreC gene of P. mirabilis was controlled by EAEP and also its bioactive compound pedalitin. The present study clearly demonstrated the potency of P. murex in controlling the growth of pathogenic P. mirabilis and to control the expression of urease enzyme production as well as to restrict the urease gene expression in P. mirabilis."

      "abstract": "Pedalium murex (L.) is a traditional herb, commonly used for the treatment of kidney stone related problems. Struvite stone can swiftly grow and become 'staghorn calculi' in kidney and its associated areas, which is the most aching urological disorder. The present study investigated the anti-urolithiasis activities of ethyl acetate extract of P. murex L. (EAEP) against struvite crystal. The antibacterial activity of EAEP examined against several urease producing bacteria. It showed the minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) against Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus (>125). On the other hand, total mass, volume, number, growth rate and dissolution rate of synthesised struvite crystals were observed at different concentrations 0.5%, 0.75%, 1% of EAEP and without EAEP. In which, EAEP addition showed appreciably reduced struvite crystal. Alternatively, MgO (300 mg of EAEP/kg/body weight) induced urolithiasis of Wistar albino rat at the rate of 1 ml for 28 days. Various biochemical parameters in serum, urine and histological analysis of kidney were taken for evaluation. Significant results (p < 0.05) were observed in 1% EAEP (300 mg) treated group than cystone treated group. From the histological study, reduced renal damage and glomerular development were observed. Our experiment, P. murex L. enhances the reducing activity on struvite crystal and prevents the crystal formation both in-vitro and in-vivo. It can be suggesting that P. murex L. and its phyto-components could be used as remedy for the management of kidney stone by dissolving the struvite stone in kidney."

      "abstract": "Pedalium murex is widely practiced in Ayurveda for the treatment of sexual disorders, but their detailed scientific evaluations are still unexplored. Therefore, the present study was conducted to assess the effect of methanolic fruit fraction of P. murex (MfPm) against sulphasalazine (SSZ) induced male reproductive disruption. MfPm and Clomiphene citrate were orally administered to SSZ (100 mg/kg b.wt) induced infertile rats at the dose of 50 and 10 mg/kg b.wt, respectively, for 60 days. MfPm treatment promoted a significant (p < 0.01) improvement in fertility (~70%), sperm motility (21%), and sperm density (11.20% and 12.30%). MfPm administration restored the serum luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, and testosterone levels back to their normal range in a significant (p < 0.01) manner and also significantly (p < 0.01) altered the level of biochemical parameters in treated rats. Furthermore, histological examination showed an improvement in spermatogenesis, as well as regeneration in the testicular architecture observed with increased germinal and interstitial cell count in response to MfPm treated rats. In conclusion, the results suggest that MfPm showed a significant modulatory effect against SSZ induced male reproductive disruption via possible mode of action such as spermatogenic and androgenic nature, therefore, justifying the traditional use of this plant in the treatment of reproductive disruption.",

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: To evaluate effect of ethanolic extract of Pedalium murex Linn. fruits on experimental model of calcium oxalate nephrolithiasis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-six male Wistar albino rats were randomly divided in 6 groups.Normal controls received distilled water for 28 days. Other five groups received ethylene glycol(1% v/v) in distilled water for 28 days. Pedalium murex ethanolic extract was given 200 mg/kg and 400 mg/kg orally in distilled water for 28 days in prophylactic groups (III and IV) and from 15th to 28th days in treatment groups (V and VI). The urea, creatinine, random blood sugar, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin and calcium were measured on 28th day. 24 hr urinary oxalate and volume were measured on day 0 and 28. On day 28, kidneys were removed, weighed and subjected to histopathological examination. Calcium oxalate crystallization was evaluated by renal histopathology and in-vitro method of mineralization.All parameters were analyzed by Kruskal-Wallis or one-way ANOVA with post-hoc test. RESULTS: Pedalium murex showed significant improvement in renal function and kidney weight inprophylactic groups as compared to ethylene glycol controls. It did not show any effect on urinary oxalate, urine volume and any other serological parameters. Calcium oxalate crystallization was significantly reduced in all the Pedalium murex treated groups (P < .05). Calcium oxalate and phosphate mineralization were also inhibited by 33% and 57%. CONCLUSION: Ethanolic extract of Pedalium murex fruits possess significant activity for prevention of renal calculi.",

      "abstract": "ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Pedalium murex Linn. has been used as Vajikaran Rasayana (aphrodisiac) in traditional Indian medicine to treat male sexual dysfunction and impotency. AIM OF THE STUDY: The aim of this study was to investigate effects of P. murex fruits extract on sexual behaviors and testosterone level of male rats during and past withdrawal of treatment. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The extract (50, 100,150mg/kg body weight/day) and sildenafil citrate (5mg/kg body weight/day) were administered orally by gavages for 28 days to male Wistar albino rats. Penile erection index (PEI), mount latency (ML), intromission latency (IL), ejaculation latency (EL), mounting frequency (MF), intromission frequency (IF), post ejaculatory interval (PEjI) and serum testosterone levels were studied at day 0, 15, 28 during treatment. They were further evaluated after day 7 and 15 past discontinuation of the treatment. In-vitro nitric oxide release activity was also investigated in human corpus cavernosal cell line. RESULTS: The ethanolic extract significantly reduced the ML, IL, EL and PEjI (p<0.05). There was a significant increase in the PEI, MF and IF and serum testosterone level (p<0.05) throughout the period of study. Ethanolic extract produced a significant effect on sexual behavior and serum testosterone level past withdrawal of the treatment. In-vitro nitric oxide release was significantly higher in extract and sildenafil citrate compared to the control group. CONCLUSIONS: Present findings provide experimental in-vivo and in-vitro evidence that the ethanolic extract of P. murex fruits possesses aphrodisiac property. Study lends growing support for the traditional use of P. murex as a sexual stimulating agent and offers a significant potential for studying the effect on male sexual response and its dysfunctions. The findings justify the concept of Rasayana as rejuvenative tonics and support their role in prevention or delay of the aging process.",

      "abstract": "Pedalium murex Linn (family: Pedaliaceae) (P. murex) commonly known as Large Caltrops and Gokhru (India) is a shrub found in the Southern part, Deccan region of India and in some parts of Ceylon. Different parts of the plant are used to treat various ailments like, cough, cold and as an antiseptic. Interestingly, P. murex is reported traditionally to have an excellent cure in patients with reproductive disorders which are mainly impotency in men, nocturnal emissions, gonorrhoea as well as leucorrhoea in women. The plant has also benifited in complications like urinary track disorder as well as gastro intestinal tract disorders. Phytochemically the plant is popular for the presence of a considerable amount of diosgenin and vanillin which are regarded as an important source and useful starting materials for synthesizing steroidal contraceptive drugs and isatin alkaloids. Other phytochemicals reported in the plant includes quercetin, ursolic acid, caffeic acid, amino acids (glycine, histidine, tyrosine, threonine, aspartic acid and glutamic acid) and various classes of fatty acids (triacontanoic acid, nonacosane, tritriacontane, tetratriacontanyl and heptatriacontan-4-one). Pharmacologically, the plant have been investigated for antiulcerogenic, nephroprotective, hypolipidemic, aphrodisiac, antioxidant, antimicrobial and insecticidal activities. From all these reports it can be concluded that the plant were found to have a better profile with potential natural source for the treatment of various range of either acute or chronic disease. The overall database of our review article was collected from the scientific sources in regards with all the information of the research article for P. murex published so far.",

The antiulcer efficacy of the aqueous extract of leaves of Pedalium murex on ethanol induced gastric lesions was investigated in our studies. This has been substantiated by ascertaining the content of total acid, acid volume, total protein, ulcer index and glutathione. Ulceration was induced in 36 hours fasted rats by the administration of 80% ethanol (1 ml/kg) orally. The reference standard (famotidine, 3 mg/kg) and aqueous extract of leaves of Pedalium murex in doses of 50, 100, 200 mg/kg was given to different groups, one hour before the administration of ethanol. Marked gastric mucosal lesions were observed with ethanol. A perceptible elevation in ulcer index, total acidity, acid volume, total protein and diminution of glutathione was observed. Pretreatment with aqueous extract of leaves of Pedalium murex particularly at a dose of 200 mg/kg in a single schedule and 100 mg/kg for 15 and 30 days treatment annihilated these alterations and elevated the level of glutathione. Therefore the aqueous extract of leaves of Pedalium murex could be regarded as a favorable antiulcerogen which could be attributed to its content of flavonoids and mucilage.",
