      "abstract": "This study aimed to investigate the effects of Tai Chi Softball (TCSB) training on the physical health of older men, with a focus on improvements in muscle strength, flexibility, balance, and blood lipid profiles. A 12-week randomized controlled trial was conducted, recruiting 140 men aged 55-65 years. Participants were randomly assigned to either a Tai Chi Softball group (TCSBG, N = 70) or a control group (CG, N = 70). The TCSBG engaged in TCSB training sessions 4 to 5 times per week, with each session lasting 70 to 90 min, while the CG maintained their usual daily routines without any additional interventions. Measurements were taken before and after the intervention and included waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), handgrip strength (HS), sit-and-reach (SAR), single-leg stance (SLS), vital capacity (VC), heart rate, systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. The results revealed that after 12 weeks of TCSB training, participants in the TCSBG showed significant improvements (p < .05) in HS, SAR, and SLS, indicating enhanced muscle strength, flexibility, and balance, respectively. The VC also increased significantly, while both SBP and DBP decreased notably (p < .05). Moreover, significant reductions were observed in TC, TG, and LDL-C levels p < .05). In conclusion, TCSB training demonstrated efficacy in improving muscle strength, flexibility, balance, cardiorespiratory fitness, and blood lipid profiles in older men. These findings suggest that TCSB training can mitigate age-related declines in physical function and reduce cardiovascular risk in older men.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is a psychosomatic disorder characterized by persistent fatigue, primarily involving physical and mental exhaustion, with greater emphasis on the latter. This leads to a deterioration in concentration and memory. These symptoms affect cognitive functions, including attention and memory, to varying degrees. Previous research has shown that Tai Chi can help reduce fatigue in individuals with CFS. However, the relationship between alleviating CFS-related fatigue through Tai Chi and its impact on cognitive functions remains unclear. The effects of Tai Chi on cognitive functions in individuals with CFS have not been clinically validated, and its efficacy and safety have yet to be examined through large-scale randomized controlled trials. Therefore, this protocol outlines a pilot randomized, parallel, single-blind clinical trial designed to evaluate the impact of Tai Chi therapy on fatigue and cognitive functions in individuals with CFS, using both subjective and objective assessments. OBJECTIVE: This pilot study aims to explore the preliminary efficacy and safety of Tai Chi in reducing fatigue and improving cognitive function in patients with CFS, and to generate data to inform future large-scale trials. METHODS: We will conduct a randomized, analyst-blinded, parallel-controlled trial with a 12-week intervention period and a 4-week follow-up. Enrolled patients will be randomly assigned to either the Tai Chi group (30 patients) or the health education group (30 patients). The Tai Chi group will receive the 24-style simplified Tai Chi intervention, while the control group will receive a health education intervention. Following the 12-week intervention, a 4-week follow-up will be conducted. The Tai Chi group will train 3 times per week, consisting of 2 in-person sessions at the Physical Education Center of Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine and 1 self-directed session guided online by an instructor. The primary outcome measure is the 20-item Multi-Dimensional Fatigue Inventory (MFI-20). The secondary outcome measures include the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Attention Network Test (ANT), working memory performance (N-Back task), and magnetic resonance imaging. RESULTS: The research protocol and informed consent form were approved by the Shanghai Clinical Research Ethics Committee on March 18, 2024 (approval number SECCR2024-22-01). Participant recruitment began in April 2024. All interventions and concurrent data collection will be completed by October 2025, and the 4-week postintervention follow-up assessments will be finalized by the end of October 2025. Data management is still ongoing; therefore, data analysis has not yet been performed. CONCLUSIONS: As a pilot trial, the findings of this study will provide preliminary clinical evidence on the role of Tai Chi in improving cognitive function in patients with CFS and will serve as a foundation for designing future large-scale trials.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Mental fatigue is a prevalent issue, especially among college students, which significantly impacts learning efficiency. Existing interventions like caffeine use have side-effects, highlighting the need for alternative approaches. Tai Chi Chuan (TCC), a traditional Chinese mind -body exercise, shows promise in alleviating mental fatigue, yet its neural mechanisms on alleviating mental fatigue, particularly from the perspective of inhibitory control, remain unclear. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to fill this gap by investigating the effects of TCC on mental fatigue and cognitive function in college students using ERP measures based on the Go/NoGo task. METHODS: Fifty-two healthy college students were randomly assigned to the TCC group (n = 18), aerobic exercise (AE) group (n = 17), or control (CON) group (n = 17). Mental fatigue was induced via the Stroop task, followed by a 20-min intervention of TCC practice, ergometer exercise, or sitting rest. Reaction time (RT), Visual Analog Scale (VAS) scores, and EEG data were collected. RESULTS: The data showed that after the Stroop task, all groups exhibited signs of mental fatigue, with increased VAS scores and RTs. However, following the 20-min intervention, the TCC group demonstrated more significant improvements in VAS scores, RTs, and ERP components (such as increased NoGo-P3 and Go-P3 amplitudes, shortened Go-P3 latencies, and decreased NoGo-N2 amplitudes) compared to the AE and CON groups. CONCLUSION: These findings indicate that practicing TCC can effectively alleviate mental fatigue and facilitate cognitive recovery in college students after sustained cognitive tasks. This study provides new insights into the neural mechanisms of TCC's beneficial effects on alleviating mental fatigue."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Studies have revealed that Tai Chi can enhance cognitive functions among patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). However, the precise mechanisms underlying this improvement remain elusive. METHODS: Consequently, we conducted a study involving 54 elderly inpatients with MCI residing in a combined medical and elderly care facility in Chengdu, who were randomly divided into three groups: a control group engaging in daily living activities, a Tai Chi group that performed Tai Chi exercises in addition to control group activities, and a walking group that undertook walking activities as a supplement to the control group regimen. The intervention period lasted for 24 weeks, comprising 12 weeks of exercise and an additional 12 weeks of follow-up. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), Trail Making Test-A (TMT-A), Auditory Verbal Learning Test (AVLT), and biochemical assessments (measuring brain-derived neurotrophic factor, BDNF, and platelet factor 4, PF4) were administered to investigate overall cognitive function, executive function, memory capacity, and changes in serum concentrations of BDNF and PF4 before, after, and during the follow-up period. Data were analyzed using IBM SPSS 26.0, with statistical methods encompassing descriptive analysis, ANOVA, rank-sum test, repeated measures ANOVA, and generalized estimating equations. RESULTS: Our findings indicated that after 24 weeks of intervention, the Tai Chi group exhibited improvements in cognitive function, executive function, and memory compared to the control group. This enhancement may be attributed to an increased expression of serum BDNF. DISCUSSION: In conclusion, our study underscores the potential of Tai Chi in ameliorating cognitive function among elderly patients with mild cognitive impairment, thereby offering significant implications for clinical prevention and treatment strategies targeting this condition."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Qigong and Tai Chi (QTC) have been adopted by cancer patients as the complementary treatment to their conventional care. This umbrella review aimed to evaluate the clinical effectiveness of QTC in cancer patients' quality of life (QoL) and its safety. METHODS: Twenty-five databases were searched from their respective inception to March 2025. Systematic reviews (SRs) and meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing cancer patients' QoL after practicing QTC were included. The search strategy included Qigong, Tai Chi, quality of life, cancer, systematic review, and meta analysis. The extracted data was analyzed using standardized mean difference, mean difference, or odds ratio with 95% confidence intervals. RESULTS: Nine SRs were included in the qualitative analysis, and six of the SRs were included for the meta-analyses. Results showed that QTC may improve cancer patients' overall QoL, physiological scores (physical functioning, fatigue, and sleep quality), psychological scores (mental health and anxiety), and immunity, compared to the control groups. However, meta-analyses did not demonstrate significant differences in subgroup analyses of depression, although it showed that QTC may reduce depression in cancer patients. No serious adverse events of QTC were reported. CONCLUSION: QTC can be considered a safe intervention method for improving QoL in patients with cancer. Due to substantial heterogeneity, more rigorously-designed RCTs on QTC for cancer patients should be conducted, focusing on standardizing QTC practices and QoL instruments to assess QTC effects.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is an intermediate stage between normal aging and dementia. Emerging evidence has demonstrated that mind-body interventions may enhance cognitive function. To elucidate whether stand-alone Tai Chi Chuan (TCC) intervention confers domain-specific benefits on executive function, memory, and global cognition, further investigations should be conducted. PURPOSE: This systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) examined TCC's effects on global cognition, memory, and executive function, and its duration-response relationship in adults 60 years or older with MCI. METHODS: Seven electronic databases were searched for relevant literature, with English as the sole inclusion criterion for language. The methodological quality and risk of bias for all included RCTs were assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias (2.0) tool. The pooled effect sizes were evaluated using standardized mean differences (SMD) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). A p-value <0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: Nine of the 1,442 publications met the inclusion criteria, comprising RCTs involving 1,066 participants (68.95% female) with a mean age of 74.1 (±7.4) years. Long-term TCC demonstrated significant effects on global cognition (p < 0.001; SMD = 0.488; 95% CI: 0.222-0.754), whereas short-term TCC did not (p = 0.172; SMD = 0.682; 95% CI: -0.397-1.660). Overall, TCC showed significant global cognitive benefits (p = 0.003; SMD = 0.526; 95% CI: 0.184-0.869). Long-term memory showed no improvement (p = 0.214; SMD = 0.162; 95% CI: -0.094-0.417), while short-term memory improved significantly (p = 0.021; SMD = 1.010; 95% CI: 0.155-1.865). The overall effect of TCC on memory was significant (p = 0.005; SMD = 0.580; 95% CI: 0.178-0.982). Both short-term and long-term improvements in executive function were significant (p = 0.006; SMD = -0.791; 95% CI: -1.353 to -0.230). CONCLUSION: The study confirmed TCC's duration-dependent effects on global cognition in older adults (≥60 years) with MCI. Memory exhibited nonlinear temporal dynamics, characterized by short-term acceleration and long-term plateau, while executive function demonstrated temporal invariance with comparable efficacy across intervention durations.

A quasi-experimental pre-test and post-test design was used with 60 participants aged 60-80, divided into experimental and control groups. The experimental group practiced Tai Chi therapy under supervision for 14 days, while the control group received no intervention. Stress levels were measured using the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) before and after the intervention. Results showed a significant reduction in stress in the experimental group, with the mean pre-test score of 27.2 dropping to 10.1 post-intervention. In contrast, the control group showed no significant change. The t-test results confirmed Tai Chi's effectiveness in reducing stress (t = 10.43, p < 0.05) for the experimental group, with no significant association between stress reduction and demographic variables. These findings support Tai Chi as a beneficial intervention for managing stress among older adults."

This study aims to investigate the effects of a 9-week TCC training program on the executive function (EF), bilateral lower limb muscle activation symmetry, single-leg dynamic balance ability, and brain FC strength in elderly individuals. It provides valuable new insights into a field that has not been extensively explored before. After 9-week training intervention, (1) The TCC group showed significant improvements in the Y-balance Test (YBTs), with enhanced symmetry in single-leg dynamic balance between the bilateral lower limbs and a significant reduction in the laterality of lower limb muscle activation. (2) TCC training strengthened the FC of related brain regions during YBTs. When performing YBTs with the left and right legs separately, the laterality of the average brain FC strength between the two tasks was significantly reduced. (3) During EF tasks, the reaction time was significantly reduced, and the concentration of oxygenated hemoglobin in the prefrontal cortex increased. Studies have shown that TCC has significantly superior intervention effects compared to brisk walking in improving neuromuscular function in older adults. Through its multisensory integration training model, TCC simultaneously enhances neuromuscular coordination and brain network collaboration efficiency, promoting the adaptive reorganization of dynamic balance control.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Mind-body movement interventions such as qi gong, tai chi, and yoga are recommended in clinical practice guidelines to improve outcomes for several health conditions. However, use of these interventions for health conditions, or the integration of these interventions within healthcare settings, is low. A systematic synthesis of implementation determinants (i.e., barriers and facilitators) is needed to increase adoption. Similarly, determinants may influence other implementation outcomes, such as scalability or sustainability of these interventions in a healthcare system or community organization. Thus, in conducting this review we aim to identify determinants of qi gong, tai chi, and yoga use for health conditions. The secondary aim is to evaluate whether barriers and facilitators differ by intervention type, health condition, implementation setting, or implementation outcome. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We conducted a comprehensive search of electronic databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, CINAHL, PsycInfo) through May 2024 and a grey literature search (Google Scholar, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, ClinicalTrials.gov, the WHO Clinical Trials database) through March 2025. We will include original research articles in English that identify barriers and facilitators to adoption of qi gong, tai chi, and yoga by adults with health conditions. Study quality will be assessed using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool. We will code each article using a codebook informed by the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR), a comprehensive taxonomy of implementation determinants. Findings will be presented as a narrative synthesis. We will report on how barriers and facilitators may relate to intervention type (qi gong, tai chi, yoga), health condition (e.g., low back pain, fall prevention), implementation settings (e.g., primary care clinic, community organization) or implementation outcome (e.g., adoption, sustainability). ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethics approval will not be obtained for this review of published, publicly accessible data. The results from this systematic review will be disseminated through conference presentations and journal publications."

PURPOSE: This meta-analysis investigated the effects of TCQ on physical function and psychiatric symptoms in adults with schizophrenia or mood disorders. METHODS: Randomized clinical trials on the effect of TCQ on physical function or psychiatric symptoms in individuals with mental illness, published in English, Korean, or Chinese, were included. A systematic search of 17 electronic databases up to September 2024 was conducted. The risk of bias was assessed using Cochrane RoB 2.0. Data were analyzed through meta-analysis, subgroup analysis, and meta-regression. RESULTS: Nineteen randomized studies (n = 1243, mean age 53 years) reported outcomes on physical function (k = 11) and psychiatric symptoms (k = 18). The risk of bias assessment showed that 21.1% of studies had a low risk, 73.7% had some concerns, and 5.3% had a high risk. TCQ significantly improved physical function (Hedges' g = 0.53, 95% CI, 0.26-0.81) and psychiatric symptoms (Hedges' g = 0.63, 95% CI, 0.41-0.85) in individuals with serious mental illness (SMI), regardless of intervention duration and comparison type. TCQ showed no significant effect on physical function in individuals with schizophrenia but demonstrated a significant moderate effect in those with mood disorders (Hedges' g = 0.56, 95% CI, 0.32-0.80). TCQ significantly improved psychiatric symptoms in both groups (schizophrenia: Hedges' g = 0.64, 95% CI, 0.26-1.02; mood disorders: Hedges' g = 0.64, 95% CI, 0.33-0.96). Meta-regression indicated that the effects of TCQ on physical function covaries with those on psychiatric symptoms among individuals with SMI (Q = 21.43, df = 9, P = .011). CONCLUSIONS: TCQ effectively enhances physical function and psychiatric symptoms in individuals with schizophrenia or mood disorders. These findings support TCQ as an effective non-pharmacological intervention for individuals with SMI. Further studies should explore the underlying mechanisms by which TCQ improves psychiatric symptoms through physical function, leading to the development of targeted intervention strategies in this population.*PROSPERO international prospective register of systematic reviews, registration ID CRD42024581253.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Research shows that traditional Chinese exercises (TCEs) significantly improve anxiety and depression in older adults. However, studies on the effects of different exercise durations, frequencies, and intensities in this population are limited. This systematic review and meta-analysis evaluate the impact of TCEs on anxiety and depression, and explores the optimal exercise parameters, aiming to provide evidence for nonpharmacological treatment options in clinical practice. METHODS: As of August 2023, we conducted a literature search through 3 English electronic databases to identify relevant studies. We included studies that met our criteria. During the literature inclusion process, we used Review Manager 5.4 to create flow diagrams, assess the risk of bias, and perform statistical analyses. RESULTS: A total of 31 eligible studies involving 2501 participants were included. Compared with the control group, TCEs showed significant improvements in anxiety (standardized mean differences [SMD] = -0.93, 95% confidence interval [CI]: -1.78 to -0.08, P = .03, I2 = 96%) and depression (SMD = -1.14, 95% CI: -1.82 to -0.47, P = .03, I2 = 96%). Subgroup analyses indicated that an intervention duration of 12 to 16 weeks yielded the largest effect size for anxiety (SMD = -1.36, 95% CI: -2.36 to -0.36, P = .008), while the 24-week group showed the largest effect size for depression (SMD = -0.87, 95% CI: -1.43 to -0.30, P = .002). For intervention frequency, a regimen of 3 to 4 times per week produced the largest effect size for anxiety (SMD = -2.34, 95% CI: -4.69 to 0.02, P = .05), whereas a frequency of 5 to 7 times per week demonstrated the largest effect size for depression (SMD = -1.00, 95% CI: -1.83 to -0.17, P = .02). Regarding single-session exercise duration, a group exercising for 40 to 60 minutes showed the largest effect sizes for anxiety (SMD = -1.38, 95% CI: -2.40 to -0.37, P = .007) and depression (SMD = -0.75, 95% CI: -1.07 to -0.42, P < .00001). CONCLUSION: The results indicate that TCEs significantly alleviate anxiety and depression in older adults, with intervention frequency, intensity, and duration potentially influencing the outcomes. However, heterogeneity across studies was observed, primarily due to differences in intervention types and control group designs. These findings offer valuable guidance for future research directions.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The aging population in China is confronted with considerable challenges, with 14.71% of elderly individuals affected by mild cognitive impairment (MCI). The practice of Tai Chi has been demonstrated to enhance cognitive function, while sensory stimulation has been shown to facilitate neural activity. Nevertheless, the combined impact of Tai Chi and sensory stimulation on cognitive, sensory functions, and brain activation in older adults with MCI remains uncertain. This study aims to ascertain whether the integration of Tai Chi with sensory stimulation can facilitate more efficacious interventions for these outcomes. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The TaiChi-MSS (Tai Chi and Multisensory Stimulation for Cognitive Function) study is a multi-center, randomized controlled trial (RCT) conducted in Suzhou and Shanghai, enrolling 88 participants aged 60 years or older with MCI. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of four groups: Tai Chi, multisensory stimulation, Tai Chi combined with multisensory stimulation or control. The intervention will last 6 months, with follow-up assessments at 3, 6, and 9 months. Primary outcomes include cognitive and sensory assessments, assessed using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), domain-specific cognitive tests, Pure Tone Audiometry (PTA), and Sniffin' Sticks Odor Identification Test. Secondary outcomes involve brain activation, measured through functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) scans. fMRI will be used to assess brain structure and connectivity changes, focusing on neuroplasticity. Data will be analyzed using mixed-effects models. The False Discovery Rate (FDR) will be the correction method for multiple comparisons to control for the expected proportion of false positives. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This study was approved by the ethics committee of Shanghai University of Sport (No. 102772023RT200). The results of this study will be disseminated in peer-reviewed journals and presented at academic conferences."

      "abstract": "Background and Aim: Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), the leading cause of sudden death, are primarily driven by metabolic dysfunction, a core mechanism underlying their onset and progression. Emerging research suggests that Tai Chi, an ancient martial art, positively impacts metabolic health. Accordingly, we sought to conduct a systematic review to examine clinical evidence regarding the effectiveness and safety of Tai Chi in managing cardiometabolic risk factors (CRFs). Methods and Results: A comprehensive literature search of eight electronic databases identified randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that met predefined inclusion criteria, focusing on adults with CRFs such as obesity, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and glycemic dysregulation. Interventions involving Tai Chi were compared with nonexercise controls or other exercise modalities. Outcomes included lipid profiles, blood pressure, blood glucose, body composition, and adverse events. Results: Thirteen RCTs involving 1746 participants were included. Tai Chi significantly reduced triglycerides (TG) (mean difference [MD] = -0.20, p < 0.0001), fasting blood glucose (MD = -0.36, p = 0.025), DBP (MD = -4.49, p = 0.010), and waist circumference (MD = -3.34, p = 0.0001), while increasing high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (MD = 0.09, p < 0.0001) compared with nonexercise interventions. Compared with other exercises, Tai Chi reduced total cholesterol (MD = -0.33, p = 0.007) and TG (MD = -0.14, p = 0.0056). The Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations (GRADE) assessment indicated the overall quality of evidence supporting these findings was moderate. No serious adverse events were reported. Conclusion: Tai Chi is an effective and safe exercise intervention for managing CRFs, especially for populations unable to engage in high-intensity exercise. While Tai Chi demonstrates modest efficacy compared with other exercises, its safety and accessibility make it a valuable option in clinical practice. Further high-quality studies are needed to confirm long-term effects and optimize intervention strategies."

      "abstract": "Tai-Chi (TC) is a broadly used exercise that appeared to decrease the risk of falls. However, biomechanical mechanisms underlying the reduced fall risks following TC exercise remain unclear and hinder the ability to optimize TC intervention to target specific balance deficit disorders. In addition, combining TC gait exercise with ground support perturbation may be a viable approach to further challenge balance control compared to TC gait alone. The purpose of this study was to compare dynamic stability and limb support force production during comfortable walking speed (CWS), TC gait, and TC gait with medial (MED) and lateral (LAT) ground support perturbations in older and younger adults. Ten older adults and ten younger adults performed CWS, TC gait, LAT, and MED. Conditions involving TC gait showed decreased margin of stability (MoS) (main effect of condition, p ​< ​0.01) and increased vertical force impulse compared to CWS (p ​< ​0.01). Medial ground support perturbation induced the smallest MoS among all conditions. Older adults showed increased MoS compared to younger adults (p ​< ​0.01). These findings provided insight into how key balance control characteristics are modulated during TC exercise and indicate that combining ground support perturbation with TC may further challenge dynamic stability."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to systematically evaluate the effect of Tai Chi on the balance function, mobility function, and gait function (including gait endurance, gait amplitude, and gait speed) of the lower limbs in patients with Parkinson's disease. METHODS: The \"PICOS\" principle was used to search seven English and six Chinese databases. Search for relevant studies published up to September 11, 2023, from the date of database creation. Two authors independently screened all eligible studies. The included studies were assessed for risk of bias based on the criteria outlined in Cochrane Handbook 5.1.0. Quantitative statistics and meta-analyses were conducted using Review Manager 5.4 software. RESULTS: Th 18 studies that met the inclusion criteria, 16 of which were included in the meta-analysis, included a sample of 963 cases from four countries. The meta-analysis revealed that Tai Chi was effective compared with conventional medication in improving balance function (MD = 2.06, 95% CI [1.35, 2.78], P < 0.00001, I2 =0%), mobility function (MD = - 1.59, 95% CI [- 2.28, - 0.91], P < 0.00001, I2 =14%), and gait speed (SMD =0.59, 95% [0.28, 0.91], P = 0.0002, I2 =29%). However, there was no significant improvement in gait endurance (SMD = 0.14, 95% CI [-0.41, 0.68], P =0.62, I2 = 0%) or gait amplitude (SMD =0.30 , 95% CI [- 0.00, 0.61], P = 0.05, I2 =0%). Compared with other exercise therapies, Tai Chi was significantly superior in improving balance function (MD = 3.05, 95% CI [1.94, 4.16], P <0.00001, I2 = 38%), mobility function (MD =-0.70, 95%CI [- 1.23, - 0.17], P = 0.01, I2 = 0%), and gait range (SMD = 0.36, 95% CI [0.14, 0.58], P = 0.002, I2 = 45%). However, the advantage of improving gait speed (SMD =0.00, 95% CI [- 0.28, 0.29], P = 0.98, I2 =0%) was uncertain. CONCLUSION: Tai chi is a safe and effective rehabilitation intervention that can enhance the balance and mobility functions of the lower limbs in patients with Parkinson's disease.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Despite the similar knee osteoarthritis (KOA) prevalence among races and ethnicities, Hispanic patients with KOA are 30%-40 % less likely to receive treatments compared with their White counterparts. Tai Chi (TC) could be an accessible and affordable intervention for Hispanic individuals with KOA. This case series explored the effect of four optimal TC forms (OTC) on reducing KOA pain in Hispanic individuals. METHODS: Seven Hispanic adults with mild to moderate KOA were recruited. Their knee pain level during walking was evaluated before and after a two-week OTC training using the Visual Analog Scale and compared between assessments. RESULTS: The 2-week OTC training course was well received by our participants. The training reduced pain with a large effect size (4.14 ± 1.21 vs. 1.29 ± 1.70 cm, p < 0.027, Wilcoxon's r = -0.833). CONCLUSION: Our pilot results suggested that the 2-week, 4-form-based OTC program can significantly reduce the knee pain in Hispanic people with KOA. Our OTC program appears to be about 20% more effective in reducing knee pain than the existing TC-based program, which uses 10 TC forms over 12 weeks (1.27 vs. 1.06 in Hedge's g). The findings implied that the OTC program could be a promising alternative paradigm for Hispanic people with KOA to lower their pain. This case series could provide vital information for the design and execution of future large-scale and rigorous clinical trials to further test the effects of the OTC program in altering pain for Hispanic people with KOA.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Self-esteem is a psychological outcome that is positively related to mental and psychological health, one of the most important elements in nursing. Developing strategies for self-esteem promotion is therefore of great importance in nursing practice. Previous reviews suggested that exercise interventions such as Tai Chi practice may confer both mental and physical benefits in humans, but reviews on the effect of Tai Chi exercise on self-esteem of adults are lacking. Thus, this systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of Tai Chi interventions in promoting self-esteem among adults. METHODS: We included randomized controlled trials that investigated Tai Chi interventions in adults, where self-esteem and/or self-confidence were reported as outcomes. The literature search was conducted in ten electronic databases. Two independent reviewers performed abstract and full-text screening using Covidence. These reviewers also independently extracted data from the included studies, and conducted critical appraisal of their methodological quality, using the revised Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for randomized trials (RoB2). RESULTS: Eleven studies were included in the review, of which all were rated as having high risk of bias or some concerns in their methodological quality. Our meta-analysis demonstrated that Tai Chi intervention can significantly improve self-esteem among adults, where the post-intervention self-esteem score was higher among the intervention participants compared to the controls (standardized mean difference: 0.46; 95% CI: 0.18-0.74; p = 0.001). Sensitivity analyses by excluding studies not reporting data using means and standard deviations revealed similar findings. One study also showed a positive effect of Tai Chi intervention on self-confidence perception. CONCLUSIONS: Tai Chi interventions have a moderately positive effect on self-esteem among adults. Tai Chi exercise classes could be a potential strategy to implement within communities, especially among individuals in higher need to improve their self-esteem such as older adults and patients having chronic illnesses that have detrimental effects on their psychological well-being. However, given the high risk of bias in most studies, caution is advised before recommending widespread implementation. Further high-quality research, including qualitative studies exploring how Tai Chi can improve self-esteem, is needed to strengthen the evidence base."

MCI, often a precursor to dementia, presents an opportunity for early intervention. This study investigates the effects of Tai Chi combined with music therapy on the cognitive function in older adult individuals with MCI. METHODS: In this randomized controlled trial, 66 older adult participants with MCI were randomly assigned to one of the following three groups: a Control Group (CG), a Tai Chi Group (TCG), and a Tai Chi Combined with Music Group (TCMG), with 22 participants in each group. Cognitive function was evaluated over a 12-week intervention using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), and Stroop Color and Word Test. RESULTS: Baseline characteristics showed no significant differences among the groups. The TCG and TCMG exhibited significant improvements after 16-week intervention. The participants with TCG group improved in MoCA score (P = 0.005), attention accuracy (P = 0.031), and delayed recall (P = 0.003). The participants with TCMG showed notable enhancements in MoCA (P = 0.000), MMSE (P = 0.001), attention accuracy (P = 0.025), visuospatial and executive functions (P = 0.001), naming (P = 0.014), abstraction (P = 0.020), and delayed recall (P = 0.006). The CG experienced decreased language repetition ability (P = 0.042) and delayed recall (P = 0.030). CONCLUSION: Twelve weeks of Tai Chi combined with music therapy substantially improved cognitive function in older adult individuals with MCI. This combined intervention is more effective than Tai Chi alone, highlighting its potential as a non-pharmacological approach to enhance cognitive health in the aging population.",

This study aimed to determine whether acute Tai Chi practice enhances emotional memory and prefrontal cortex activation compared to cycling and a control condition. METHODS: Using a within-subjects crossover design, 36 healthy university students completed three interventions: Tai Chi, cycling, and a resting control condition. Emotional memory performance was assessed before and after each intervention, and cortical hemodynamics were measured using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). The correlation between oxyhemoglobin (Oxy-Hb) concentration in the prefrontal cortex and emotional memory accuracy was analyzed. RESULTS: Compared to cycling and the control group, the Tai Chi intervention showed: (1) a significantly higher accuracy of positive emotional memory; (2) a greater increase in Oxy-Hb concentration in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (L-DLPFC) during positive emotional memory tasks; (3) a stronger positive correlation between Oxy-Hb concentration in the L-DLPFC and emotional memory accuracy. In contrast, cycling improved positive emotional memory accuracy to a lesser extent, while the control group showed no significant changes. CONCLUSION: Tai Chi, compared to cycling and rest, significantly enhanced positive emotional memory and L-DLPFC activation. These findings highlight the unique potential of Tai Chi to improve emotional memory through increased cortical activation, suggesting its effectiveness as a cognitive-emotional intervention."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Tai Chi (TC) is widely acknowledged for its positive impact on improving motor function in older adults. Nevertheless, limited research has directly compared the effects of different TC styles on older adults with functional impairments. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the impact of different TC styles on motor function in older adults with functional impairments. METHOD: We searched five databases-PubMed, Scopus, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Web of Science, and Wiley Online Library-including studies published up to September 2024. The selection of literature adhered to PRISMA guidelines, with quality assessment independently carried out by two researchers. RESULTS: Fourteen studies met the inclusion criteria for this review. The analysis revealed that TC interventions for functionally impaired older adults primarily employed Yang-style, Sun-style, Chen-style, and simplified-style TC. The populations studied included individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), nonspecific low back pain (NS-LBP), preclinical disabilities, chronic diseases, poor balance, osteoarthritis (OA), Parkinson's disease (PD), sarcopenia, and those at risk of falls. The findings indicated that motor function in functionally impaired older adults were closely linked to balance, gait, mobility, strength, and fall rates. Among the various TC styles, Yang-style was the most frequently utilised intervention. CONCLUSION: This review examined four types of TC interventions and found strong evidence supporting the effectiveness of Yang-style TC in improving motor function in older adults with functional impairments. Additionally, five assessment methods-Single-Leg Stance (SL), Six-Minute Walk Test (6MWT), Timed Up and Go Test (TUGT), Chair Stand Test (CST), and Fall Efficacy Scale (FES)-were identified as suitable for evaluating this population. Based on the findings, it is recommended that individuals with functional impairments engage in Yang-style 24-movement TC, with an intervention duration of 12 weeks, practicing two to five times a week for 60 min each session.",

METHODS: A systematic search across four academic databases identified 16 studies with 1,877 participants. Data were expressed as weighted or standardized mean differences with 95% confidence intervals. RESULTS: A meta-analysis revealed significant improvements in Mini-Mental State Examination scores and Timed Up and Go results in patients with mild cognitive impairment following tai chi intervention. Subgroup analysis indicated that both communication technology-based tai chi and traditional tai chi produced varying improvements in cognitive and physical function. CONCLUSION: This study confirms the importance of tai chi for cognitive and physical functioning in patients with mild cognitive impairment. Compared with traditional tai chi, communication technology-based tai chi showed greater benefits in promoting rehabilitation. The effective and feasible interventions could improve the physical health of many older adult patients, these findings provide valuable insights and decision-making guidance for clinical practice and public health with older patients with mild cognitive impairment.

      "abstract": "IMPORTANCE: Sleep disorders and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) commonly coexist in older adults, increasing their risk of developing dementia. Long-term tai chi chuan has been proven to improve sleep quality in older adults. However, their adherence to extended training regimens can be challenging. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a neuromodulation technique that may enhance the benefits of exercise. OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether 1-Hz rTMS of the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex could enhance the clinical benefits of tai chi chuan in improving sleep quality and cognitive function among older adults with sleep disorders and MCI. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This 2-arm, sham-controlled, assessor-masked randomized clinical trial was conducted at a university hospital in China between October 2022 and February 2024. Adults aged 60 to 75 years with sleep disorders and MCI were eligible. Data analysis was performed from February to May 2024. INTERVENTION: Participants were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to an experimental group (tai chi chuan and 1-Hz rTMS) or a sham group (tai chi chuan and sham rTMS). Each participant received 30 sessions of personalized rTMS targeting the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and the sham group underwent the same procedure. The 2 groups received 30 sessions of 60 minutes of the 24-form simplified tai chi chuan, 5 times per week for 6 weeks. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcomes were subjective sleep quality assessed by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), in which scores range from 0 to 21, with lower scores indicating a healthier sleep quality, and global cognitive function assessed by the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), in which scores range from 0 to 30, with higher scores indicating less cognitive impairment. The secondary outcomes included measures of objective sleep actigraphy, anxiety and depression scales, and other cognitive subdomains. Assessments were performed at baseline, 6 weeks after the intervention, and at the 12-week follow-up. RESULTS: A total of 110 participants (mean [SD] age, 67.9 [4.6] years; 68 female [61.8%]) were randomized to the experimental group (n = 55) and the sham group (n = 55) and included in the intention-to-treat analysis. At 6 weeks after the intervention, compared with the sham group, the experimental group showed a lower PSQI score (between-group mean difference, -3.1 [95% CI, -4.2 to -2.1]; P < .001) and a higher MoCA score (between-group mean difference, 1.4 [95% CI, 0.7-2.1]; P < .001). The per-protocol dataset analyses and 12-week follow-up showed similar results. The generalized estimated equation model revealed an interaction effect between the PSQI score (mean difference, -2.1 [95% CI, -3.1 to -0.1]; P < .001) and the MoCA total score (mean difference, 0.9 [95% CI, 0.1-1.6]; P = .01). There were 7 nonserious, unrelated adverse events (experimental group: 2; sham group: 5) with no significant difference between the 2 groups. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this randomized clinical trial, the findings suggest that 1-Hz rTMS enhanced the clinical benefits of tai chi chuan in improving sleep quality and cognitive function among older adults with sleep disorders and MCI, which may be related to alterations in neural plasticity. These findings provide novel data on nonpharmacologic strategies for the rehabilitation of sleep disorders and may delay or even prevent MCI.

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: To form a unique body weight support-Tai Chi Yunshou (BWS-TCY) training method, apply it to the treatment of upper limb dysfunction after stroke, and provide a new safe and effective treatment method for the clinic. METHODS: A total of 93 subjects were recruited and randomly divided into conventional rehabilitation treatment (CRT) group, BWS-TCY group and traditional robot-assisted training (RAT) group in equal proportions. Subjects in the CRT group received 60 minutes of CRT daily. Subjects in the BWS-TCY group received 30 minutes of CRT and 30 minutes of BWS-TCY. Subjects in the RAT group received 30 minutes of CRT and 30 minutes of RAT. All interventions were conducted 5 days per week for 12 weeks. Outcome assessments included the Fugl-Meyer Upper Extremity Motor Function Assessment (FMA-UE), Wolf Motor Function Test (WMFT), absolute angular error (AAE), joint range of motion (JMA), modified Barthel Index (MBI), and stroke-related quality of life. Table (SS-QOL). Outcome measures were assessed at baseline, 4 weeks, 8 weeks, and 12 weeks later, and statistical analyzes were performed using two-way repeated measures analysis of variance. RESULTS: After 12 weeks of intervention, significant improvements were observed in all evaluation indicators for the three groups of subjects compared to before the intervention. The upper limb motor function (FMA-UE and WMFT) and proprioception (AAE) showed time effects, time × group interaction effects, and group effects. When comparing the groups, the FMA-UE in the BWS-TCY group, as well as the WMFT and MBI, showed statistically significant differences compared to the CRT group (P<0.05), but not statistically significant compared to the RAT group (P>0.05). The AAE of the BWS-TCY group showed no statistical difference (P>0.05) when compared to the CRT group and RAT group. Furthermore, a time effect was observed on the rotation direction (P<0.05), and pairwise comparison between groups revealed that the BWS-TCY group performed better than both the CRT group and the RAT group. After 12 weeks of intervention, there were time effects and interaction effects between BWS-TCY and daily living activities (MBI) and quality of life (SS-QOL), but no group effect was observed. There was no statistical difference between the two groups in SS-QOL. However, there was a statistical difference (P<0.01) in MBI between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: The 12-week BWS-TCY intervention has been shown to effectively improve upper limb motor function.

METHODS: This was a prospective clinical trial that involved 37 breast cancer patients who had completed surgery treatment. Participants' motor function, hematological examination, and self-rated questionnaire were assessed at the baseline and after the intervention. RESULTS: Through the 12-week TCC intervention, participants' weights (p = 0.981), body mass index (BMI) (p = 0.913), and blood pressure (p = 0.374 for systolic BP, p = 0.299 for diastolic BP) remained stable; waist-hip ratio significantly decreased (p < 0.001); and post-intervention pulse rate (p = 0.011) and vital capacity (p = 0.062) slightly increased. In the aspect of motor function, the value of sit and reach (p < 0.001), grip strength of both hands (p < 0.001), and most active range of motion of neck and shoulder joint (p < 0.001 for anteflexion and both left and right lateroflexion of neck joint, both left and right adduction and rear protraction of shoulder joint) increased after intervention. Arm girth (p < 0.05 for arm girth in left styloid process of ulna, 5 cm below left cubital crease, left and right cubital crease, 10 cm above left and right cubital crease, and left axilla) showed a shrinking trend after intervention. According to the questionnaire of Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), participants' sleep quality improved, and anxiety and depression remained stable after the trial (p = 0.021 for PSQI, p = 0.631 for anxiety, p = 0.182 for depression). Hematological examination of total protein (p = 0.016), albumin (p < 0.001), albumin-globulin ratio (A/G) (p < 0.001), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-CH) (p = 0.002), and apolipoprotein A1 (APOA1) (p < 0.001) increased after intervention. CONCLUSION: Motor function and sleep quality improved significantly after TCC intervention for 3 months in breast cancer patients. At the same time, some hematological metabolic biomarkers also changed better. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: ChiCTR2200061422. Date of registration: June 24th, 2022.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Frailty is a common geriatric syndrome worldwide, and its early identification and intervention have important clinical significance. Resistance training has been recommended as an efficient means to combat loss of muscle strength and mass; however, it is often not a prioritized option for older adults. Tai chi is a well-known traditional Chinese exercise that has a beneficial impact on physical performance, balance ability, metabolism, and immune function. AIMS: With the newly emerged concept of muscle-immune homeostasis, this study focused on determining the efficacy of tai chi prefrail older adults who develop immunosenescence. Furthermore, the proper timing of the exercise regimen for maximizing the therapeutic effect of tai chi has also been explored. METHODS: This 12-week, multicenter, randomized controlled trial (RCT) was conducted with participants between 60 and 75 years of age. A total of 144 prefrail participants were included in this study and were randomized (1:1:1:1) to four groups: (1) a control group with only health education, (2) a morning tai chi group, (3) a morning resistance training group, and (4) an afternoon tai chi group. The primary endpoints included physical performance, frailty index scores, muscle strength, and mass, and the secondary endpoints were the sarcopenia quality of life score, Berg balance scale score, bioenergetic anti-stress index (BASI), and immune risk profile (IRP). The data were analyzed according to the intention-to-treat protocol. DISCUSSION: The results of this investigation aided in determining whether tai chi effectively reversed the prefrail state of older adults and ameliorated biomarkers of immunosenescence. Furthermore, proper exercise timing was also determined to maximize the efficacy of physical training.

METHODS: This study was part of a randomized controlled trial where 41 community-dwelling PLWD received a Tai Chi exercise intervention in addition to usual care for 20 weeks. The measures used in this study included PLWD's QoL, global cognitive function, moderate physical activity, intention and confidence to attend classes, record of PLWD's and their carers' health conditions, and percentages of PLWD's Tai Chi class attendance and home practice during the intervention phase. Multiple linear regression, bivariate correlation, and independent sample t-test analyses were conducted to evaluate associations between these variables. RESULTS: PLWD's overall percentage of class attendance, M (SD) = 69.19 (29.95), demonstrated high adherence. Moreover, QoL of highly adherent PLWD was significantly higher than low adherents. Among all variables, PLWD's and carers' health conditions (β = -0.64; p < .001, β = -0.38; p < .001, respectively) were the dominating factors that reduced PLWD's Tai Chi adherence, while PLWD's moderate physical activity at baseline (β = 0.27; p = .02) was significant positive predictor. Significance/Implications: PLWD's and their carers' health issues must be addressed to enhance PLWD's exercise adherence and sustain good QoL."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Age-related decline in goal-directed behavior could be risky for older adults to maintain daily activities. Our previous studies have shown that long-term Tai Chi (TC) practice could improve motor performance and postural control during goal-directed tasks. However, there was a paucity of studies examining TC's effects on online control of goal-directed action. RESEARCH QUESTION: Do long-term TC practitioners have different kinematic characteristics in online control of goal-directed behavior compared to our control groups during precision fitting tasks? METHODS: 36 older adults were recruited for sedentary (SE), brisk walking (BW), and TC groups based on their exercise habits. Participants were required to fit a block (90 × 90 mm) through two different openings (130 × 130 mm and 100 × 100 mm) at two different distances (arm's length or 130 % of arm's length). Hand, trunk, and center of pressure (CoP) data were collected and analyzed, where velocities and timing variables were used to evaluate the manual motor control. RESULTS: We observed that: (1) TC group used significantly less time of completion in all three phases than SE and BW groups, especially in the ADJ phase when condition with more task constraints; (2) TC group demonstrated faster average hand velocity in all three phases than SE and BW groups; (3) TC group had a faster average trunk velocity than SE and BW groups and faster average CoP velocity than the BW group in the ADJ phase. SIGNIFICANCE: The long-term TC practitioners might exhibit better online control ability in the precision fitting task than the SE and BW groups, leading to more smooth and effortless goal-directed movement executions. Therefore, the long-term TC practice could be an effective intervention for maintaining precision manual motor control among older adults.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Academic environments are known for their high demands, often resulting in significant distress among employees. Thus, identifying effective intervention strategies to mitigate workplace stress is essential. The present study aims to evaluate the potential benefits of mind-body interventions (i.e., Yoga and Tai Chi) on the psychological wellbeing and perceived mental and physical health of female university employees. METHODS: A total of 166 female university employees and faculty members participated in 10 sessions of Tai Chi or Yoga. They completed self-report questionnaires assessing ruminative thoughts, somatic anxiety, general distress, perceived physical and mental health, and assertive and cooperative behaviors before and after the 10 Tai Chi/Yoga sessions. Additionally, participants completed a state anxiety questionnaire before and after Tai Chi/Yoga second and second-to-last lessons. RESULTS: Results showed significant differences between scores pre and post Tai Chi and Yoga programs, with lower ruminative thoughts (p = 0.007), lower somatic anxiety (p < 0.001), and higher perceived mental health (p = 0.038) at the end of the programs (i.e., after 10 sessions) compared to the beginning. Moreover, significant differences were found in state anxiety scores, with a reduction in state anxiety at the end of the second (p < 0.001) and second-to-last (p < 0.001) lessons compared to the start. CONCLUSION: Our findings highlight the potential positive impact of Tai Chi and Yoga programs on the psychological wellbeing and perceived mental health of female university employees. Immediate reductions in state anxiety following single sessions further underscore the potential of these practices for short-term stress relief. Overall, the results support the implementation of mind-body practices in workplace settings to promote a healthier work environment."

AIMS: To compare the therapeutic efficacy of an exercise intervention on physical performance, sleep efficiency, and quality of life in older adults with cognitive impairment. DESIGN: A three-arm randomized controlled trial. METHODS: This study recruited 81 older adults with mild to moderate cognitive impairment at a nursing home from December 2020 to July 2021. Participants were screened and randomized into three groups: a tai chi intervention group (n = 27), a conventional exercise intervention group (n = 27), and a waitlist control group with no intervention (n = 27). The intervention groups underwent 12 weeks of exercise intervention. Participants were assessed at weeks 0, 6, and 12. The primary outcome was the Short Physical Performance Battery score, and the secondary outcomes were sleep efficiency and quality of life. Statistical analysis was conducted with generalized estimating equations (GEEs). RESULTS: The mean age of the participants was 81.0 ± 7.4 years. The GEE analysis revealed that the Short Physical Performance Battery score, sleep efficiency, and quality of life were significantly higher in both intervention groups than in the control group at week 12, and physical performance improved significantly more in the tai chi group than in the conventional exercise group. CONCLUSIONS: Both exercise interventions improved physical performance, sleep efficiency, and quality of life in older adults with mild to moderate cognitive impairment. According to our results, tai chi may be a more effective therapeutic approach for cognitive impairment than conventional exercise.

We conducted a randomized controlled trial to examine feasibility and the relative efficacy of two 12-week in-person group treatments (Tai Chi and Wellness) to address GWI symptoms of chronic pain, fatigue, and changes in mood and cognitive functioning. METHOD: Male and female veterans were randomly assigned to Tai Chi (n = 27) or Wellness (n = 26) group interventions and assessed at four time points: baseline, post-treatment, 3-, and 9-month follow-up. Multilevel models with a treatment-by-time interaction term were utilized to evaluate treatment effects and changes in GWI-related outcomes over time. RESULTS: Satisfaction was high, there were no adverse events, and over half the participants attended 75% or more sessions with no significant differences between groups. For pain interference, analyses revealed a significant quadratic effect of time with no differences between treatment groups. For general fatigue and a cognitive test of trail making, no significant effects were detected. For depressed mood, linear and quadratic time effects and the group x linear time interaction were significant indicating greater reductions for Tai Chi participants. For a verbal learning test, linear and quadratic time and the group x quadratic time interaction significantly predicted total recall with Tai Chi participants demonstrating more rapid initial improvements. CONCLUSION: Findings indicate that both Tai Chi and Wellness are feasible and acceptable. Both interventions may have a salutary impact on pain interference, depression, and verbal learning with some advantages for Tai Chi."

METHODS: Searching six databases until October 20, 2024, including Embase, PubMed, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, SinoMed, and CNKI, for randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Participants were aged ≥60 and diagnosed with depression. Tai Chi served as the main intervention in the treatment group, with the control group receiving no exercise, or only health education. The primary outcomes focused on the improvement of depressive symptoms and quality of life. Data synthesis and meta-analysis were performed using Stata 15.1 software. The protocol of this study was registered on PROSPERO (ID: CRD42023479305). RESULTS: Tai Chi, as the main intervention, significantly improved depressive symptoms as measured by the Geriatric Depression Scale (WMD = -5.99, 95% CI: -10.80 to -1.19, p = 0.015) compared to no exercise or health education. Subgroup analysis favored a six-month duration of Tai Chi, showing even greater benefits (WMD = -9.79, 95% CI: -13.90 to -5.69, p < 0.001). However, Tai Chi did not demonstrate a significant advantage in improving participants' scores on the Hamilton Depression Scale (WMD = -1.04, 95% CI: -3.84 to 1.76, p = 0.468). CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that Tai Chi can significantly improve depressive symptoms and quality of life in elderly individuals with depression. As a daily exercise and mind-body therapy to alleviate the mood of the elderly, it is necessary to conduct more large-sample RCTs. Further research on the details of Tai Chi, such as movements, frequency, duration, and exercise periods, is essential for a dose-response relationship, contributing to the standardized promotion of Tai Chi."

METHODS: A literature search was conducted from 2004 to October 2024 in PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Google Scholar, Cochrane Library, and Chinese databases (CNKI and Wanfang) for randomised controlled trials in Chinese and English on Tai chi improving sleep quality in the older people. Data extraction and verification were performed by two independent researchers. Additionally, a meta-analysis of the mean difference (MD) and 95% confidence interval (CI) was conducted using RevMan 5.4. RESULTS: A total of nine randomised controlled trials involving 1,166 older participants were included. Compared with the control group, Tai chi significantly reduced the total Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) scores in the older people [MD =  - 1.53, 95% CI (- 2.18, - 0.89), p < 0.001], with heterogeneity results Q = 53.63, df = 12, and I2 of 78% (p < 0.001); Total weekly duration of Tai chi exercise: Less than 150 min reduced PSQI scores, but the difference was not statistically significant [MD =  - 1.47, 95% CI (- 3.89, 0.95), p = 0.23]. Between 150-300 min significantly reduced PSQI scores [MD =  - 1.54, 95% CI (- 2.00, - 1.08), p < 0.001]; Duration of Tai chi exercise programme: 8-12 weeks significantly reduced PSQI scores [MD =  - 1.93, 95% CI (- 2.60, - 1.25), p < 0.001]; 16-24 weeks significantly reduced PSQI scores [MD =  - 1.27, 95% CI (- 2.27, - 0.26), p = 0.01]; Single session duration of Tai chi exercise: 60 min significantly reduced PSQI scores [MD =  - 2.17, 95% CI (- 3.15, - 1.18), p < 0.001]; Less than 60 min (25-45 min) significantly reduced PSQI scores [MD =  - 0.92, 95% CI (- 1.63, - 0.20), p = 0.01]. CONCLUSION: Older individuals engaging in at least 150 min per week of Tai chi practice can improve sleep quality.

Previous studies found that 4-week 'exercise and Tai-chi snacking' as a viable alternative to traditional exercise is acceptable to healthy older adults. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of a 12-week progressive exercise and Tai-chi snacking programme on physical function and psychological outcomes in pre-frail older adults. DESIGN: Randomised controlled trial. SETTING: Community-dwelling older adults. PARTICIPANTS: 90 older adults with impaired strength and balance were recruited. Participants were randomly allocated to an intervention or waitlist control group. INTERVENTION: A 12-week progressive exercise and Tai-chi snacking programme. MEASUREMENTS: Physical function (the short physical performance battery (SPPB), single-leg balance test and sit-to-stand test) was remotely measured at participants' homes via video calls at baseline, 4-, 8-, and 12-weeks. The self-reported psychological outcomes were also assessed every 4 weeks using online questionnaires. A subset of 40 participants also completed in-person functional assessments, and 26 intervention participants underwent semi-structured interviews to feedback on their experiences. RESULTS: The 12-week progressive home-based exercise and Tai-chi snacking improved SPPB strength (estimated mean difference in week 4: 1.05; week 8: 0.79; and week 12: 0.79) and balance (estimated mean difference in week 4: 0.71; week 8: 0.57; and week 12: 0.65) at each timepoint compared to control group. Timed-up-and-go (estimated mean difference in week 4: 1.94; week 8: 1.58; and week 12: 1.1) and total SPPB scores (estimated mean difference in week 4: 2.24; week 8: 1.79; and week 12: 1.76) were also better in the intervention group compared to the control group in lab subset participants. Based on the qualitative findings, Participants found the programme accessible and beneficial, making it suitable for older adults and increasing self-efficacy in physical activities. CONCLUSION: The home-based exercise and Tai-chi snacking programme significantly improved lower extremity strength, balance, and mobility in pre-frail older adults. This programme is considered to be a beneficial, acceptable and easy implemented physical function intervention.",

Tai Chi significantly improved balance and physical function, particularly in the Berg Balance Scale (BBS), one-leg standing with eyes closed (OLS-C), and Timed up-and-go test (TUG). Fear of falling (FOF) also reduced, though changes in Tinetti Balance Test (TBT) and Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) were not statistically significant. CONCLUSION: Tai Chi effectively enhances balance and physical function in older adults, with notable potential for fall risk reduction. While some tests showed no significant effect, overall results support Tai Chi as a valuable intervention to promote older adults' health.

This article explores the impacts of a 7-posture W/A TCC instructional training program for healthcare providers that has been facilitated throughout the VA healthcare system since 2016. The purpose is to better understand the impact this training has on healthcare providers, including Recreational Therapists (RTs). A mixed-methods design exploring participant perspectives showed increased confidence levels following training in several key areas and no statistically significant differences between RTs compared to all other healthcare providers. Meaningful impacts described by participants are explored. Overall discussion focuses on this specific training program's unique applicability for directly influencing VA healthcare providers and the veterans being served. Overall results offer support for wheelchair/adaptive tai chi chuan training as one strategy that can be utilized to increase the success of holistic veteran healthcare."

OBJECTIVE: This meta-analysis aimed to assess the effect of Tai Chi and Baduanjin on breast cancer patients by summarizing and pooling the results of previous studies. METHODS: The PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Scopus and Cochrane Library and several databases were searched up to December 1, 2023, to identify high-quality RCTs. Relevant terms such as Tai Chi and Baduanjin were used as keywords. Stata 15.0 software and Review Manager (version 5.3; Cochrane Training) were used to screen the studies, extract the data, code the data, and perform the meta-analysis. The mean differences (MDs) and standardized mean differences (SMDs) with 95% CIs were used to calculate continuous variables. The Cochrane risk of bias assessment tool was used to evaluate the risk of bias. The PICOS framework was used to develop the following eligibility criteria: (i) population - breast cancer patients; (ii) intervention - Tai Chi and Baduanjin intervention; (iii) comparison - Tai Chi and Baduanjin group and different intervention (e.g., regular intervention, routine rehabilitation training, waiting list, sham Qigong, usual care, no intervention); (iv) outcomes - cognitive ability, shoulder joint function, anxiety, depression, fatigue, sleep quality, quality of life; and (v) study design - randomized controlled trial. RESULTS: From January 2013 to December 2023, we included a total of 16 RCTs involving 1247 patients. A total of 647 patients were in the experimental group and were treated with Tai Chi and Baduanjin, while 600 patients were in the control group and were treated with traditional methods. The results of our meta-analysis indicate that Tai Chi and Baduanjin yield outcomes that are comparable to those of traditional treatment methods. Specifically, Tai Chi and Baduanjin significantly increased cognitive function, increased shoulder joint function, improved sleep quality indicators and improved quality of life indicators. Furthermore, Tai Chi and Baduanjin significantly reduced anxiety symptoms, depression symptoms, and fatigue symptoms among breast cancer patients. Sensitivity analysis was performed, a funnel plot was constructed. No publication bias was indicated by Egger's or Begg's test. CONCLUSION: Overall, Tai Chi and Baduanjin are viable and effective nonpharmacological approaches for treating breast cancer patients, as they yield better results than traditional treatment methods. However, these findings should be interpreted with caution due to the limited number of controlled trials, small sample sizes, and low quality of the evidence.

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) is a chronic and debilitating illness with symptoms such as post-exertional malaise and cognitive dysfunction that can be challenging for patients to manage independently. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have examined mind-body and psychological approaches that teach patients coping skills for mitigating ME/CFS symptoms, including emerging literature on Qigong or Tai Chi instruction programs. This systematic review aims to summarize the characteristics of these trials and highlight potential areas for future optimization and refinement. METHODS: Ovid MEDLINE, Embase.com, Web of Science Core Collection, Cochrane CENTRAL, PsycINFO via Ovid, and ClinicalTrials.gov were searched in April 2023 using controlled vocabulary and keywords for the following eligibility criteria: Sample (ME/CFS), Design (RCT), Behavioral Intervention (mind-body or psychological interventions). Data extraction and reporting followed Cochrane and Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. RESULTS: \"Qigong\" and \"Tai Chi\" yielded 142 and 80 abstracts, respectively. Of the 222 abstracts, full texts were available for 5 RCTs of Qigong (k = 5; N = 481). Notably, no trials of Tai Chi utilized a randomized control design. Among the 5 Qigong RCTs, the publication range was from 2012 to 2023. Details regarding intervention components and effects were summarized. Qigong intervention sessions (median = 12, mode = 10, 12) tended to last between 1-2 hours and occur across 5-12 weeks (median = 7, mode = 5). The Qigong interventions were all delivered in groups and incorporated at-home practice. Daily practice was a requirement (k = 4) or an advisement (k = 1). Patient-reported outcomes suggest an emerging evidence base for diffuse benefits on physical and emotional health outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Qigong interventions are promising, yet relatively understudied, in improving ME/CFS symptom severity and frequency. Future trials must implement standardized eligibility criteria for ME/CFS history, integrate Qigong or Tai Chi with other empirically supported mind-body and psychological practices, and assess long-term resiliency outcomes relevant to ME/CFS survivorship."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Novel approaches to improve sleep disturbance in older adults are needed. Our study comprises a pioneering attempt to test the efficacy of Tai Chi (TC) combined with repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) in improving sleep disturbance in older adults. The influence of baseline depressive symptoms was tested in a subset of the sample. METHOD: In the randomized controlled trial, 152 participants were each allocated to one of the following groups: (1) TC plus active rTMS (n = 38), (2) TC plus sham rTMS (n = 38), (3) TC alone (n = 38), and (4) low-intensity physical exercise (PE) control group (n = 38). Four-week interventions were conducted for each group. The outcomes included insomnia severity, actigraphy-assessed and self-reported sleep parameters, mood states, and quality of life. Assessments were carried out at baseline (T0), post-intervention (T1), and 3-month follow-up (T2). RESULTS: Of the 152 randomized participants, the mean (SD) age was 67.68 (4.98) years, with 112 female (73.68%). The findings revealed that TC plus active rTMS induced a significant reduction in actigraphy-assessed sleep onset latency compared to TC plus sham rTMS at T1 and T2. In the subsample without depressive symptoms, the combination treatment exhibited a greater benefit in actigraphy-assessed sleep efficiency and wake time after sleep onset compared to both variables in the PE group and in the sham comparator group at T1, respectively. The other subsample with depressive symptoms showed the improvements with TC plus active rTMS, TC plus sham rTMS, and TC alone differed significantly from PE at T1 and T2. CONCLUSIONS: This study has demonstrated the positive effect of TC combined with rTMS on sleep disturbance in older adults. Specific sample characteristics should be considered when applying TC, either alone or combined with rTMS.",

We sought to evaluate whether a virtually delivered mind-body program integrating tai chi, qigong, and meditation (VDTQM) is effective for treating LBP. METHODS: This randomized controlled trial compared VDTQM (n=175) to waitlist control (n=175). Eligible participants were at least 18 years old, had LBP for at least 6 weeks, were not pregnant, had not previously taken tai chi classes, and had not undergone spine surgery within 6 months. The treatment group received a 12-week VDTQM program in live online 60-minute twice-weekly group classes from September 2022 to December 2022. All participants continued their usual activities and care. Primary outcome was pain-related disability assessed by the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) score. Secondary outcomes included pain intensity, sleep quality, and quality of life (QOL). Intent-to-treat analyses were conducted. RESULTS: Of the 350 participants 278 (79%) were female, mean age was 58.8 years (range: 21-92), 244 (69.7%) completed the 8-week survey, 248 (70.9%) the 12-week, and 238 (68%) the 16 -week. No participants withdrew due to adverse treatment effects. Compared with control group, treatment group experienced statistically and clinically significant improvement in ODI score by -4.7 (95% CI: -6.24 to -3.16, p<.01), -6.42 (95% CI: -7.96 to -4.88, p<.01), and -8.14 (95% CI: -9.68 to -6.59, p<.01) points at weeks 8, 12, and 16, respectively. Treatment group also experienced statistically significant improvement at all time points in the other outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Among adults with LBP, VDTQM treatment resulted in small to moderate improvements in pain-related disability, pain intensity, sleep quality, and QOL. Improvements persisted 1 month after treatment concluded. These findings suggest VDTQM may be a viable treatment option for patients with LBP.Trial registration: clincaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT05801588."

Although evidence-based psychological therapies are recommended as first-line PTSD treatments, a large proportion of individuals either drop out and/or do not achieve a therapeutic response. PTSD is increasingly recognized as a systemic disorder that impacts both physical and mental health, and mind-body approaches, such as Tai Chi, have shown promise. However, to date there have been no randomized clinical trials examining Tai Chi as a treatment for PTSD.Objective: To conduct a fully remote two-phased study designed to adapt, refine, and standardize two group treatments, Tai Chi and a Wellness comparison, for Veterans diagnosed with PTSD and chronic pain.Method: We deploy the project in two phases. In Phase One, we adapt both interventions for delivery via a videoconferencing platform. We then pilot the interventions in a 'dry run' with non-random assignment of 12 participants to Tai Chi or a Wellness comparison group. In Phase Two, we randomize 36 participants to one of the two group interventions. The feasibility and acceptability of the two remotely delivered interventions and assessment protocols are evaluated.Conclusions: This is the first study to our knowledge to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, adherence, and participant burden of the Tai Chi and Wellness comparison interventions for PTSD and chronic pain in Veterans. This information will facilitate the development of a future large, randomized control trial to evaluate the efficacy of Tai Chi to address PTSD and chronic pain in Veterans.",

METHODS: A randomized, controlled, exploratory clinical trial was conducted paired with a qualitative study of adherence management. A total of 20 overweight/obese participants were randomly assigned to a standard Tai Chi group (experimental) and a simplified Tai Chi group (control) for an 8-week intervention, 10 patients in each group, with a 12-month follow-up. BMI was calculated and exercise capacity including an isokinetic muscle strength and balance ability test were evaluated. Mental health was assessed using the General Well-Being Schedule (GWB), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and Coping Self Efficacy Scale (CSES) at baseline, 4th week, and 8th week, respectively. The qualitative research included open-interviews with Tai Chi practitioners and semi-structured interviews with subjects. RESULTS: The intervention was conducted in Haidian Park, Beijing, China from October 6, 2022, to January 1, 2023, without dropouts. After an 8-week intervention, the participants in the experimental group exhibited a significant decrease in BMI (P<0.05). Both groups demonstrated significant improvements in exercise capacity (P<0.05). The experimental group exhibited a significant enhancement in the GWB, PSQI and CSES (P<0.05). Only GWB had significant difference in the control group (P<0.05). The experimental group surpassed the control group in GWB and CSES (P<0.05). The adherence rate was 87.5% in the experimental group and 57.9% in the control group after 8 weeks intervention. Analysis on adherence identified 15 themes, the top 3 themes mentioned were as follows: mind-body effects, online and on-site guidance, training schedule (for subjects); mind-body effects, difficulties in practicing, and understanding of Tai Chi (for practitioners). CONCLUSIONS: Both interventions were effective in improving exercise capacity. Tai Chi, integrating both physical and mental conditioning, reduced weight, improved exercise capacity and mental happiness, and increased adherence, providing a sustainable exercise program (ChiCTR2200063599).",

      "abstract": "Background/Objectives: Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) and post-COVID syndrome (PCS) pose a substantial socioeconomic burden. The aim of this systematic review was to assess current evidence regarding the effect of the most popular forms of movement-based mindful exercises, i.e., qigong, tai chi, and yoga, on fatigue and associated symptoms in CFS and PCS. Methods: CINAHL, Embase, PsycINFO, PubMed, Scopus, and the Cochrane Library were searched from inception to October 2023. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) where qigong, tai chi, or yoga were compared with waitlist, no intervention, or active controls were included. Independent reviewers participated in data extraction, and evaluated risk of bias, spin of information, completeness of intervention description, and certainty of the evidence (GRADE). Meta-analyses were conducted. The primary outcome was the level of fatigue. Secondary measures were the severity of anxiety and depressive symptoms and sleep quality. Results were expressed as mean difference (MD) or standardized mean difference (SMD) with a 95% confidence interval (CI). Results: Thirteen RCTs with 661 participants were included, with most studies presenting a moderate or high risk of bias. Mindful exercises were more effective than control interventions to alleviate fatigue: SMD (95%CI) = -0.44 (-0.63 to -0.25), I2 = 48%, p < 0.0001. Positive effects were also observed for secondary outcomes. The certainty of the evidence was low or very low. Conclusions: Qigong, tai chi, and yoga may be effective to reduce fatigue and improve anxiety, depression, and sleep quality in adults with CFS or PCS. However, serious methodological concerns limit the clinical applicability of these findings."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) poses significant challenges to both patients and healthcare providers due to its progressive nature and adverse impact on respiratory function and quality of life (QoL). While pulmonary rehabilitation remains a cornerstone of non-pharmacological COPD management, additional interventions are needed to address patients' diverse needs and preferences. AIM: This study investigated the feasibility and potential benefits of a 12-week combining Tai Chi and Yoga (TY combining) program on cardiorespiratory and lung functions, functional fitness, and QoL in older males diagnosed with COPD. METHODS: Twenty-four male COPD patients (age: 70 ± 6 years) with moderate to severe disease were recruited and randomized into the TY combining group (n = 12) or control group (n = 12). Assessments were conducted at baseline and at week 12, including pulmonary function tests, quality of life measures, dyspnea, and fatigue. Functional fitness tests were assessed at baseline, week 4, week 8, and week 12. RESULTS: The TY combining program significantly improved pulmonary functions, functional fitness, quality of life, and fatigue over the 12-week intervention period. Notably, improvements in functional fitness parameters were observed after just four weeks of training, emphasizing the rapid benefits of the intervention. Moreover, the program exhibited high safety and feasibility, with no reported complications. CONCLUSION: The 12-week TY combining program represents a safe, feasible, and effective adjunctive therapy for COPD management in older male patients. By addressing multiple dimensions of health and functioning, including pulmonary and cardiovascular health, functional fitness, and quality of life, this holistic approach holds promise for optimizing outcomes in COPD patients. Further research is warranted to validate these findings and explore optimal implementation strategies in clinical practice.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Stroke survivors often face motor dysfunction, increasing fall risk. Lower extremity muscle weakness is a key factor affecting walking ability. Tai chi (TC) has been shown to improve muscle strength and mobility in patients with stroke more effectively than traditional walking training. However, existing TC programmes for stroke rehabilitation are often too simplified and fail to fully use TC's benefits. Additionally, subjective assessment scales are time-consuming and prone to bias. This study proposes integrating TC's early movement features with neurodevelopmental therapy, using surface electromyography and inertial measurement unit (IMU) sensors to thoroughly analyse diverse TC movements. Tailored exercises, based on stroke-induced impairments, will be objectively assessed through biomechanical analysis. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The study unfolds in two phases. The initial phase employs the IMU sensor and electromyography to objectively analyse TC's biomechanics, informing personalised rehabilitation plans aligned with distinct movement impairments. The second phase adopts a randomised, single-blind, parallel controlled trial design involving 60 patients with stroke randomly assigned to either the intervention or control group. The intervention group undergoes biomechanics-based TC training alongside routine rehabilitation for 12 weeks, practicing the 24-form TC three times weekly. The control group engages in routine rehabilitation thrice weekly for the same duration. Primary and secondary outcomes, including kinematic/dynamic data, surface electromyography, motion analysis, comprehensive the international classification of functioning, disability and health Core Set for Stroke, Modified Barthel Index and Fugl-Meyer Assessment, will be evaluated at baseline and post-intervention. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study has received approval from the Ethics Committee of Zhongda Hospital Southeast University (2023ZDSYLL378-P01). All prospective participants will receive comprehensive information regarding the study protocol, and their informed consent will be obtained before their participation. Additionally, the trial will be registered with the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry to ensure transparency and compliance with research regulations. Results from this study will be disseminated through peer-reviewed journals, conference presentations and public databases to ensure wide accessibility and to contribute to the advancement of medical knowledge.

With the increasing complexities in the transition from school to work, effective interventions that address both psychological and vocational needs are essential. METHODS: The study involved 70 senior college students, randomly assigned to either an intervention group that participated in an organized 8-week Tai Chi program based on positive youth development (PYD) or a control group with no intervention. RESULTS: Results indicated significant improvements in the intervention group in terms of both career adaptability and satisfaction of basic psychological needs, compared to the control group. Mediation analysis revealed that the increase in career adaptability induced by intervention was mediated by the satisfaction of basic psychological needs, underscoring the effectiveness of Tai Chi as a holistic intervention tool. DISCUSSION: This study contributes to the field by demonstrating that physical activity, particularly one embedded with deep cultural and philosophical significance like Tai Chi, can effectively enhance the career adaptability of college students. It advocates for the inclusion of PYD-based physical practices in developmental interventions aimed at preparing youth for the challenges of the modern workforce."

METHODS: Three parallel groups (T2DM with DD group, T2DM group, and healthy group) were recruited from December 10, 2022, to May 31, 2023. Participants in three groups conducted a motor task of tai chi chuan designed by Eprime 3.0, and fNIRS was used to monitor the brain activation, functional connectivity (FC), and lateralization of prefrontal and motor areas. Correlation analyses were performed to examine the relationship between depressive symptoms and the function of prefrontal and motor areas. RESULTS: Ninety elder adults (aged ≥ 60), including 30 patients with T2DM and MDD, 30 patients with T2DM, and 30 healthy subjects, were enrolled. In contrast with the patients with T2DM and healthy subjects, the patients with T2DM and MDD had decreased activation and abnormal lateralization in prefrontal and motor areas and decreased FC among supplementary motor area, motor area, and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). Furthermore, the oxyhemoglobin (HbO2) concentration value of DLPFC in patients with T2DM and MDD was negatively associated with scores of Hamilton Depression Scale-24 (HAMD-24). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with T2DM and MDD had characteristic functional changes in prefrontal and motor areas. DLPFC may be a potential target of diagnosis and intervention for patients with T2DM and MDD.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Osteoarthritis is a leading contributor to global disability. While evidence supports the effectiveness of Tai Chi in improving symptoms for people with hip/knee osteoarthritis, access to in-person Tai Chi classes may be difficult for many people. An unsupervised online Tai Chi intervention for people with osteoarthritis can help overcome accessibility barriers. The Approach to Human-Centered, Evidence-Driven Adaptive Design (AHEAD) framework provides a practical guide for co-designing such an intervention. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to develop an unsupervised online Tai Chi program for people with hip/knee osteoarthritis. METHODS: An iterative process was conducted using the AHEAD framework. Initially, a panel of Tai Chi instructors and people with osteoarthritis was assembled. A literature review was conducted to inform the content of a survey (survey 1), which was completed by the panel and additional Australian Tai Chi instructors to identify Tai Chi movements for potential inclusion. Selection of Tai Chi movements was based on 3 criteria: those that were appropriate (for people with hip/knee osteoarthritis aged 45+ years), safe (to be performed at home unsupervised), and practical (to be delivered online using prerecorded videos). Movements that met these criteria were then ranked in a second survey (survey 2; using conjoint analysis methodology). Survey findings were discussed in a focus group, and the Tai Chi movements for program use were identified. A draft of the online Tai Chi program was developed, and a final survey (survey 3) was conducted with the panel to rate the appropriateness and safety of the proposed program. The final program was developed, and usability testing (think-aloud protocol) was conducted with people with knee osteoarthritis. RESULTS: The panel consisted of 10 Tai Chi instructors and 3 people with osteoarthritis. The literature review identified Yang Style 24 as a common and effective Tai Chi style used in hip/knee osteoarthritis studies. Surveys 1 (n=35) and 2 (n=27) produced a ranked list of 24 Tai Chi movements for potential inclusion. This list was refined and informed by a focus group, with 10 Tai Chi movements being selected for inclusion (known as the Yang Style 10 form). Survey 3 (n=13) found that 92% (n=12) of the panel members believed that the proposed draft Tai Chi program was appropriate and safe, resulting in its adoption. The final program was produced and hosted on a customized website, \"My Joint Tai Chi,\" which was further refined based on user feedback (n=5). \"My Joint Tai Chi\" is currently being evaluated in a randomized controlled trial. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the use of the AHEAD framework to develop an unsupervised online Tai Chi intervention (\"My Joint Tai Chi\") for people with hip/knee osteoarthritis. This intervention is now being tested for effectiveness and safety in a randomized controlled trial.",

      "abstract": "Tai Chi (TC) practice has been shown to improve both cognitive and physical function in older adults. However, the neural mechanisms underlying the benefits of TC remain unclear. Our primary aims are to explore whether distinct age-related and TC-practice-related relationships can be identified with respect to either temporal or spatial (within/between-network connectivity) differences. This cross-sectional study examined recurrent neural network dynamics, employing an adaptive, data-driven thresholding approach to source-localized resting-state EEG data in order to identify meaningful connections across time-varying graphs, using both temporal and spatial features derived from a hidden Markov model (HMM). Mann-Whitney U tests assessed between-group differences in temporal and spatial features by age and TC practice using either healthy younger adult controls (YACs, n = 15), healthy older adult controls (OACs, n = 15), or Tai Chi older adult practitioners (TCOAs, n = 15). Our results showed that aging is associated with decreased within-network and between-network functional connectivity (FC) across most brain networks. Conversely, TC practice appears to mitigate these age-related declines, showing increased FC within and between networks in older adults who practice TC compared to non-practicing older adults. These findings suggest that TC practice may abate age-related declines in neural network efficiency and stability, highlighting its potential as a non-pharmacological intervention for promoting healthy brain aging. This study furthers the triple-network model, showing that a balancing and reorientation of attention might be engaged not only through higher-order and top-down mechanisms (i.e., FPN/DAN) but also via the coupling of bottom-up, sensory-motor (i.e., SMN/VIN) networks."

      "abstract": "An imbalance between the generation of reactive oxygen species and the body's antioxidant defense mechanisms is closely related to the development and progression of Parkinson's disease (PD). Considering that physical exercise is a potential therapeutic intervention for modulating oxidative stress markers and cognitive function in PD, the primary purpose of this study was to compare the effects of different long-term exercise modalities on antioxidants and cognitive performance in patients with PD. In addition, the secondary purpose was to explore whether changes in the levels of these biochemical markers are associated with alterations in cognitive performance pre- and post-intervention. In all, 61 participants were randomly divided into the aerobic exercise (AE, n=20), Tai Chi exercise (TCE, n=21), or control (n=20) group. Blood samples were collected before and after a 12-week intervention period for the analysis of antioxidant markers [leukocyte 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), catalase (CAT), glutathione (GSH), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), oxidized glutathione (GSSG), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and uric acid (UA)]. Cognitive function was evaluated using the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). Although no significant changes were observed in the activity of 8-OhdG, GSH-Px, GSSG, GSH:GSSG ratio, SOD, and cognitive performance in the AE and TCE groups, the 12-week AE intervention led to a significant increase in CAT and GSH levels, along with a significantly decrease in UA levels among individuals with PD. Conversely, the TCE intervention resulted in a significant increase in GSH levels. However, SOD activity and MMSE scores were significantly decreased after 12 weeks in the control group. The correlations between changes in MMSE scores and changes in the levels of GSH and UA prior to and after the intervention reached significance in the AE group. Thus, long-term AE and TCE might serve as effective strategies for reducing oxidative damage and preserving cognitive function in PD, with AE exhibiting greater benefits compared with TCE. These findings hold potential clinical relevance as complementary measures to standard medical treatments and alternative therapies, such as antioxidant supplements and dietary adjustments, particularly for individuals in the early stages of PD.",

However, the mindful essence of TCC is rarely emphasized during popularization. This makes it difficult for beginners to benefit from it. The present study aimed to examine the effects of a Mindfulness-enhanced Tai Chi Chuan (MTCC) intervention, which enhances mindfulness components embedded within TCC, on mental and physical health among beginners. METHODS: A randomized controlled trial was conducted with 119 healthy college students new to Tai Chi Chuan training. Participants were assigned to either the MTCC group or the TCC group. Both interventions consisted of 10 weekly 90-min training sessions, with the MTCC group emphasizing and enhancing mindfulness components. Outcome measures included mindfulness, depression, anxiety, stress, and physical fitness, assessed at baseline and post-intervention. RESULTS: The results showed that the MTCC group had significantly greater improvements than the TCC group in mindfulness, anxiety, stress, and health-and skill-related physical fitness. There were no significant differences between the two groups in depression. CONCLUSION: The findings suggest that compared to TCC, MTCC can effectively promote individuals' physical fitness and provide additional benefits to mental well-being. MTCC can be recommended as an accessible and beneficial intervention for beginners to improve mental health and strengthen their bodies.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Music has frequently been used in movement exercises to enhance health benefits. However, scientific evidence regarding the application of music to Tai Chi practice is limited. OBJECTIVE: This scoping review aims to understand how music has been used in Tai Chi practice and whether music could be applied to Tai Chi practice to help optimize its benefits. METHODS: PubMed, CINAHL, CNKI, and Weipu databases were searched. We included studies that compare Tai Chi practice experience or health outcomes between individuals practicing Tai Chi with music and those practicing Tai Chi without music. Studies published through September 2022 were identified. Two researchers (YD and YH) independently performed study selection and data extraction. Thematic analysis was used to summarize and categorize the findings of the included studies. RESULTS: Seven studies were included in this review. All 7 included studies are experimental studies. Practicing Tai Chi with music might lead to positive perceptions of Tai Chi practice (eg, motivation, concentration, enjoyment, compliance, and performance) and higher evaluations of Tai Chi instructional quality, especially for Tai Chi beginners. The effects of incorporating music into Tai Chi practice on health outcomes are inconclusive due to the heterogeneities of the sample size, and the intervention components, lengths, and frequencies of the included studies. CONCLUSIONS: Applying music to Tai Chi practice may result in positive Tai Chi practice experience and adherence, particularly for beginners, which could help improve the dissemination and implementation of Tai Chi interventions for public health. However, whether applying music to Tai Chi practice leads to synergetic effects on health outcomes needs further investigation."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Tai chi has been used to treat different forms of osteoporosis and increase bone density without the use of pharmaceuticals. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to use bibliometric analysis to methodically examine trends and hotspots of tai chi treatment for osteoporosis in order to generate references for further investigation. METHODS: The articles on Tai Chi to treat osteoporosis was obtained from China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Wan Fang, Web of Science (WOS) and PubMed between inception and November 8,2023. The annual publication volume, authors, institutions, and keywords, along with co-citation, clustering, and burst analysis, were analyzed using CiteSpace. RESULTS: Totally, 328 publications were included. The number of annual publications has been rising rapidly in recent years. Beijing University of Chinese Medicine and Shanghai University of Sport are two of the best universities for Tai Chi treatment in osteoporosis. This area of research is dominated by Zhou, Y; Yu, DH; Pence, BC and Qin,L. Core authors and core institutions having a relatively low level of collaboration indicates that there may be limited interaction and cooperation between these key players in the field. China had the highest volume of publications, followed by the United States. Furthermore, the majority of the study subjects and influence mechanism are the focus of current research in this field. CONCLUSION: Tai Chi in osteoporosis research field is in a stage of stable development. Universities and higher education institutions are the leading institutions in this field. China and the United States emerging as high productivity nations. The study of Tai Chi in osteoporosis not only focuses on the applicable population, effects and intervention methods, but also gradually shifts to the mechanism study such as \"secretion of beneficial factors\", \"physical exercise load\" and \"oxidative stress status\".",

The insights gained may inform personalized non-pharmacological interventions to enhance the management of cardiovascular health in this population to provide sustainable benefits and improve quality of life. (2) Methods: Forty postmenopausal middle-aged and elderly women were randomly assigned to an exercise or control group. The exercise group underwent a 24-week Tai Chi (BaFa WuBu) training intervention with real-time heart rate monitoring using Polar sensors. Pre- and post-intervention assessments included body composition, blood pressure, vascularity, and blood parameters measured with the Inbody 720, Vascular Endothelial Function Detector, and Arteriosclerosis. Data were analyzed using SPSS 26.0 and mixed-design ANOVA to assess the effects of time, group, and their interactions on study outcomes. (3) Results: After training through 24 weeks of Tai Chi (BaFa WuBu) intervention, compared with the control group, systolic blood pressure in the exercise group was significantly lower (p < 0.05), and the difference between left and right arm pulse pressure, left and right ankle mean arterial pressure, left and right side baPWV, left and right side ABI, TC, TG, LDL, and blood pressure viscosity were all very significantly lower (p < 0.01), and the diastolic blood pressure was significantly higher (p < 0.05). Compared with baseline values in the exercise group, systolic blood pressure, right and left arm pulse pressure difference, right and left ankle mean arterial pressure, right and left side baPWV, right and left side ABI, TC, TG, LDL, and blood pressure viscosity decreased very significantly (p < 0.01) and diastolic blood pressure and FMD increased very significantly (p < 0.01) in the exercise group after the intervention. (4) Conclusions: In our study, a 24-week Tai Chi (BaFa WuBu) program significantly improved vascular health in middle-aged and older postmenopausal women. This simplified Tai Chi form is gentle and effective, ideal for older adults. Regular practice led to reduced vascular obstruction, improved lipid metabolism, and enhanced vascular endothelial function, crucial for preventing vascular diseases. The real-time heart rate sensors used were pivotal, enabling precise monitoring and adjustment of exercise intensity, thereby enhancing the study's scientific rigor and supporting Tai Chi (BaFa WuBu) as a beneficial therapeutic exercise.",

However, it remains unclear whether a mind-body exercise, that is, Tai Chi exercise, can improve memory performance in older adults by improving their subjective and objective sleep. METHODS: A randomized controlled trial was conducted with participants (M = 67.36, 56-79 years) randomly assigned to Tai Chi and control groups. The primary outcomes were sleep, both subjectively reported and objectively assessed by actigraphy, and memory performance, as well as the mediating role of sleep in memory improvement with Tai Chi practice. RESULTS: Tai Chi exercise led to improvements in subjective sleep, as indicated by Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) (p < .001, Cohen's d = 0.62) and daytime dysfunction of the Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI) (p = .02, Cohen's d = 0.80), and in actigraphy-assessed sleep onset latency (p < .01, Cohen's d = 0.61), as well as improved memory performance on digit span forward (p < .001, Cohen's d = 1.20) and visual spatial memory tasks (p < .01, Cohen's d = 0.83) compared to the control group. Importantly, Tai Chi practice improved digit span forward memory performance through parallel mediation of both subjective sleep (i.e., daytime dysfunction of the PSQI) and objective sleep (i.e., sleep onset latency; b = 0.29, p < .01).

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Tai Chi (TC) holds a unique and valued place in promoting the physical and mental health of college students. Its significance is underscored by its incorporation as a compulsory physical education course in every university in China. TC, with its rich tradition, places a strong emphasis on posture control as a core sports ability. However, the students in Tai Chi Elective Course (TCEC) have very poor posture control ability. This study protocol investigates the potential of Tan Tui (TT) to address these issues, as TT is a fundamental skill for beginners of traditional Chinese martial arts and has a track record of enhancing lower limb strength and balance, making it a promising choice for improving posture control in TCEC. METHODS/DESIGN: To investigate the impact of different intensities of TT exercises on posture control in TCEC students, we have designed a randomized, double-blind, parallel-controlled trial. Seventy-six students in the TCEC will be randomly divided into low-intensity Tan Tui (LTT), medium-intensity Tan Tui (MTT), and high-intensity Tan Tui exercises group (HTT) and control group (CON), each with 19 people. The LTT group, MTT group, and HTT group will be given different intensity of TT exercises, and the CON group will be given regular TCEC. The intervention period will be 6 weeks (2 times a week, 20 min each time). At baseline (before), 4 weeks of intervention (middle), and 6 weeks of intervention (after), the Unipedal Stance Test (UST), the Star Excursion Balance Test (SEBT), 60°/s angular velocity knee joint flexion and extension relative peak torque (RPT), and knee joint position perception (KJPP) will be evaluated. DISCUSSION: This is the first randomized controlled trial protocol from the perspective of training intensity to evaluate the effect of different intensity of TT exercises on posture control of students in TCEC. Should our research reveal a significant intervention effect, the results will offer preliminary, higher-quality evidence supporting the positive impact of varying intensities of Tan Tui exercises on posture control in TCEC students.

The aim was to explore the biomechanical differences between the two exercises and provide theoretical support for the application of Tai Chi elastic band exercise in health intervention. METHODS: A total of 26 male participants were recruited and randomly divided into two groups in a 1:1 ratio. There were 13 participants in each Tai Chi elastic band exercise group and elastic band resistance training group. Both groups of participants used an elastic band to perform movement in the experiment. Experimental data were collected using the Vicon infrared motion capture system and Delsys surface EMG system. The AnyBody software was utilized to simulate the creation of a musculoskeletal model for both exercises. RESULT: The study found that the Tai Chi elastic band exercise group exhibited smaller horizontal abduction angle and flexion angle of the shoulder joint, as well as normalized RMS of the anterior deltoid and triceps brachii, compared to the elastic band resistance training group (P < 0.01); the Tai Chi elastic band exercise group exhibited greater elbow flexion angle, elbow flexion torque, and muscle strength of the infraspinatus, coracobrachialis, biceps brachii, brachialis and brachioradialis, compared to the elastic band resistance training group (P < 0.01); the Tai Chi elastic band exercise group exhibited smaller horizontal abduction angular velocity of the shoulder joint and a lower normalized RMS of the posterior deltoid, compared to the elastic band resistance training group (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: (1) The opening and closing movement of Tai Chi elastic band exercise is characterized by a large elbow flexion angle, a small shoulder joint horizontal angle and flexion angle, and a slow and uniform speed of movement. The reverse fly movement of elastic band resistance training is characterized by a large horizontal abduction angle of the shoulder joint, a large flexion angle of the shoulder joint, a small flexion angle of the elbow joint, and a fast and uneven speed. (2) The opening and closing movement exerts a greater torque on the elbow flexion, while the reverse fly movement exerts a greater torque on the shoulder joint horizontal abduction and external rotation. (3) The opening and closing movement provide greater stimulation to the infraspinatus, coracobrachialis, and elbow flexor, while the reverse fly movement provides greater stimulation to the posterior deltoid, anterior deltoid, subscapularis, and elbow extensor. In summary, the variation in joint angle, joint angular velocity, and hand position could be the factor contributing to the differences in joint torque and muscle activity between the opening and closing movement of Tai Chi elastic band exercise and the reverse fly movement of elastic band resistance training.",

We aimed to explore the effectiveness of Tai Chi in improving drug cravings, attention bias, and physical fitness in men with MUD compared with aerobic exercise. METHODS: A total of forty-eight participants (mean age 39.1 ± 8.7 years) were randomly assigned to either the Tai Chi group (TC) or the running group (RG). The TC performed 60 min of moderate-intensity (65-75% HRmax) Tai Chi exercise three times a week. The RG performed 60 min of moderate-intensity (65-75% HRmax) running on a treadmill three times a week. Before and after the intervention, drug cravings, attention bias, and physical fitness were evaluated. RESULTS: After 12 weeks, we found the TC significantly improved in attention bias (F (1, 43) = 6.023, p = 0.019, d = -0.42) and reaction time (F (1, 43) = 6.181, p = 0.017, d = -0.72). No significant improvement was found in other variables in the TC, compared to the RG (p > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The 12-week Tai Chi intervention improved attention bias and reaction time, compared to RG. Tai Chi exercise might be a potential auxiliary method for the rehabilitation for men with MUD."

      "abstract": "Objectives: Chronic nonspecific neck pain (CNNP) is prevalent among health care workers, with particularly high rates among nurses. Nurses experiencing CNNP often report decreased job satisfaction, increased absenteeism, and reduced productivity. In recent years, nonpharmacologic approaches have gained attention as effective treatments for the management of CNNP, with exercise and manual therapies representing two of the most common. Early evidence shows that multimodal treatments may be more effective than unimodal strategies. The purpose of this current study was to assess the feasibility and observe the clinical outcomes of combined multimodal chiropractic care (MCC) and Tai Chi (TC) for CNNP in nurses. Methods: A single-arm mixed-methods pilot trial was conducted including 16 weeks of MCC and TC in nurses with self-reported CNNP. Feasibility outcomes were recruitment, retention, and adherence to the interventions. Clinical outcomes of interest included neck pain and related disabilities. Secondary outcomes of interest were functional, affective, and work-related performance. Qualitative interviews were also conducted. Results: Of the 59 screened, 36 met the eligibility criteria, and 21 were enrolled. The retention rate was 71.4%, and adherence rates were 85.3% for MCC and 62.5% for TC classes. Multiple pain and disability-related outcomes exhibited modest improvement from baseline to 16-week follow-up. Qualitative analysis identified six emergent themes: (1) neck pain being an inherent part of nursing, (2) nurses push through their pain, (3) MCC relieves pain and is instructive for preventing pain, (4) TC provides overall relaxation, (5) both interventions increased body awareness and improved posture, and (6) scheduling difficulties were a key obstacle for participating. Conclusions: Observed reductions in neck pain and disability suggest the potential utility of combined MCC and TC interventions for managing CNNP. Along with qualitative feedback regarding facilitators and barriers to participation, the findings support and inform a future randomized trial evaluating the combined benefits of MCC and TC for CNNP in nurses.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The bone status of postmenopausal women is worsening. In fact, postmenopausal period is the high incidence stage of osteoporosis and falls. Notably, a recent study has pointed out that exercise can improve bone health in postmenopausal women. However, the effect of Tai Chi exercise on postmenopausal women is controversial. Therefore, a meta-analysis was designed to analyze the effect of Tai Chi exercise on bone health and fall prevention in postmenopausal women. METHODS: The researches on Tai Chi improving the bone health of postmenopausal women before August 31, 2023 were collected from Chinese and English databases, such as PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science, etc. The risk of bias of the included studies was assessed using the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for randomized trials. Besides, R software 4.3.1 was employed to analyze the effect sizes in the meta-analysis to summarize the impact of Tai Chi on vertebral bone mineral density, serum calcium, clinical balance scores, the number of falls, total falls, and health status scores in postmenopausal women. RESULTS: There were 12 studies eventually included in this meta-analysis. A total of 1,272 postmenopausal women were involved, including 628 in the experimental group (intervention with Tai Chi exercise) and 644 in the control group (without any intervention). Briefly, postmenopausal women practicing Tai Chi presented a significant increase in vertebral bone density [standardized mean difference (SMD) = 0.37, 95% confidence interval (CI) (0.04-0.71), P = 0.03] and health status score [SMD = 0.25, 95% CI (0.01-0.49), P = 0.04]. In contrast, there were no significant differences for postmenopausal women between the two groups in terms of serum calcium [SMD = -0.01, 95% CI (-0.39, 0.36), P = 0.77], clinical balance [SMD = 0.17, 95% CI (-0.01, 0.46), P = 0.23], number of falls [SMD = -0.61, 95% CI (-1.24, 0.02), P = 0.06] and total falls [odds ratio = 0.35, 95% CI (0.11-1.12), P = 0.07]. CONCLUSION: Tai Chi exercise can improve the bone mineral density of postmenopausal women, thereby maintaining bone health. Hence, Tai Chi exercise is necessary to prevent osteoporosis.",

A total of 90 individuals who have been clinically diagnosed with schizophrenia were assigned to two treatment groups, namely the Tai Chi treatment (TT) group and the routine treatment (RT) group. Following a 24-week duration of intervention, the data obtained from 32 patients in the TT group and 30 patients in the RT group were meticulously analyzed. At the commencement of the investigation and upon completion of the 24-week intervention, blood samples were gathered, and clinical evaluations were executed. In plasma, the identification of nine cytokines (IL-10, IFN-γ, IL-5, GM-CSF, TNF-α, IL-13, IL-4, IL-2, and IL-12) was conducted using the multiple primer suspension chip method. The clinical evaluations encompassed CGI, WHOQUOL-BREF, SOFS, PSS, BPRS, SAPS, SANS, and RBANS. In comparison to the RT group, the patients in the TT group demonstrated decreased levels of TNF-α and IL-5 (P < 0.05). Moreover, they encountered more pronounced advancements in SAPS, SANS, PSS, SOFS, and RBANS scores (P < 0.05). Additionally, a positive connection was detected between the plasma TNF-α level in the TT group and both the SANS score and the SPFS score (P < 0.05). Tai Chi has been shown to improve clinical symptoms in patients with schizophrenia as an add-on therapy, potentially through its effects on immunomodulatory pathways.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The arousal state has been demonstrated to be involved in the fundamental pathophysiological mechanism of sleep disturbances. Tai chi (TC) and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) have been documented to alleviate sleep disturbances by interfering with different arousal components. It is reasonable to assume that combining TC and rTMS could induce synergistic and longer-lasting benefits for sleep disturbances. METHODS: Thirty-eight older community-dwelling people were randomly assigned to one of three groups: TC plus rTMS (n = 12), TC alone (n = 13), and treat-as-usual (TAU) (n = 13). The interventions were conducted three times per week for 4 weeks for the two intervention groups. The primary outcome was the insomnia severity, while the secondary outcomes were the actigraphy-assessed sleep patterns, use of hypnotic medications, mood states, and quality of life. The mediator outcomes included self-reported somatic arousal and cognitive arousal as well as electroencephalogram (EEG)-assessed cortical arousal. The assessments were conducted at baseline (T0), post-intervention (T1), and 3-month follow-up (T2). RESULTS: Significant improvements in the insomnia severity were observed in the TC plus rTMS group compared with the TAU group at T1 (Cohen's d = 1.62, p = 0.003) and T2 (Cohen's d = 1.97, p < 0.001). In contrast, significant improvements in the TC alone group were found only at T2 (Cohen's d = 1.03, p = 0.010) when compared with the TAU group. Significant interaction effects were noted on the actigraphy-assessed sleep efficiency (p = 0.015) and total sleep time (p = 0.004), depression (p = 0.003) and stress scores (p = 0.002), and mental function in relation to quality of life (p = 0.042). However, none of the mediators elucidated how combining TC and rTMS could improve the insomnia severity. CONCLUSION: The research findings are expected to guide further clinical practice in the management of sleep disturbances among older adults using various interventions. Future studies are needed to unravel the underlying mechanism and optimize the protocol to maximize the therapeutic benefits.",

The Tai Chi group followed a tailored exercise protocol addressing ankle instability through a three-phase progression, while the control group had no intervention but continued their usual activities. Measurements, including Cumberland Ankle Instability Tool (CAIT), Star Excursion Balance Test (SEBT), Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia (TSK), Short Form-12 (SF-12), figure-8 hop test, and perceived treatment effect were assessed before and after the intervention. The Tai Chi group showed significant improvements in CAIT score and SEBT reach distance compared to the control group (p < 0.001). Tai Chi exercises also reduced TSK, improved figure-8 hop score, and enhanced the physical component of SF-12 (p < 0.005), with no significant effect on the mental component of SF-12 (p = 0.7).

METHODS: By collecting data from 12 databases up to December 2022, we conducted a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to evaluate the effects of Tai Chi on the physical function and psychological health among CHD patients. RESULTS: We analyzed twenty qualified studies involving 2095 patients. Meta-analyses revealed that compared with conventional therapy groups, those who participated in Tai Chi-based interventions demonstrated significant improvements in physical function as measured by six-minute walk test (6MWT) [mean difference (MD) = 56.40, 95% confidence interval (CI) (38.50, 74.29), p < 0.01], maximal oxygen consumption ( VO 2  max) [standardized mean difference (SMD) = 0. 57, 95% CI (0.12, 1.03), p = 0.01], New York Heart Association (NYHA) class [relative risk (RR) = 1.34, 95% CI (1.18, 1.53), p < 0.01] and physical health components (PHC) [SMD = 1.23, 95% CI (0.76, 1.69), p < 0.01]. Additionally, Tai Chi participants showed greater improvement than control groups across various psychological parameters including anxiety scales [SMD = -0.80, 95% CI (-1.33, -0.28), p = 0.003], depression scales [SMD = -0.77, 95% CI (-1.32, -0.23), p = 0.005] and mental health components (MHC) [SMD = 1.27, 95% CI (0.76, -1.78), p < 0.01]. The GRADEpro (Grade Guideline Development Tool) indicated evidence levels ranging from very low to moderate. CONCLUSIONS: The present meta-analysis demonstrates that mind-body rehabilitation exercises based on Tai Chi can improve both physical and psychological health outcomes for CHD patients. These findings suggest that this exercise pattern may be a potential option for cardiovascular rehabilitation.

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: A series of functional disorders commonly occur after stroke, of which upper limb dysfunction is the most difficult to recover. The upper limb rehabilitation effect of Tai Chi Yunshou(TCY) in the later stage of stroke has been confirmed by research. Body weight support-Tai Chi Yunshou (BWS-TCY) is based on TCY exercise and robotic exoskeletons offers most flexibility in deweighting and control strategy. This study is aimed to explore the effect of BWS-TCY on upper limb motor function in stroke based on neurobiomechanics. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A single-blind randomized controlled trial will be conducted on 36 stroke survivors who will be randomly assigned to three groups: experimental group, control group A and control group B. In addition, 12 healthy elderly people will be recruited into the healthy control group. Those in the experimental group will receive 20 min of CRT and 20 min of BWS-TCY training, while participants in the control group A will receive 20 min of CRT and 20 min of Robot-assisted training. Participants in the control group B will undergo 40 min of Conventional rehabilitation training (CRT) daily. All interventions will take place 5 days a week for 12 weeks, with a 12-week follow-up period. No intervention will be carried out for the healthy control group. Upper limb function will be assessed before and after the intervention using various rating scales (Fugl-Meyer Assessment, Wolf Motor Function Test, etc.), as well as neurobiomechanical analyses (surface electromyography, functional near-infrared brain function analysis system, and Xsens maneuver Capture System). Additionally, 10 healthy elderly individuals will be recruited for neurobiomechanical analysis, and the results will be compared with those of stroke survivors. DISCUSSION: The results of this study will offer initial evidence on the effectiveness and feasibility of BWS-TCY as an early intervention for stroke rehabilitation.

METHODS: A total of 72 perimenopausal women with depression were randomly selected from Lishi District and divided into a Tai Chi training group (36 cases) and a control group (36 cases). At the same time, 36 perimenopausal healthy women were randomly selected as the normal group. The Tai Chi training group was intervened with 24 simplified Tai Chi exercises, and the depression self-rating scale was used to evaluate the depression status. The levels of tryptophan (Trp) and kynurenine (KYN) metabolites in serum were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography-ultraviolet detection. RESULTS: Before the experiment, compared with the normal healthy group, the depression self-rating scale scores, serum KYN and quinolinic acid (QUIN) levels, and KYN/Trp ratio of the control group and Tai Chi group were significantly increased (p < .01), and the serum kynurenic acid (KYNA) level was significantly decreased (p < .01). After the experiment, compared with the normal healthy group, the depression self-rating scale scores of the Tai Chi group were significantly decreased (p < .01), the serum KYNA content was increased (p < .01), the serum KYN and QUIN contents were significantly decreased (p < .01), and the KYN/Trp ratio was significantly decreased (p < .01). CONCLUSION: Tai Chi training can significantly improve depression symptoms in perimenopausal women. The mechanism of Tai Chi training in improving depression symptoms in perimenopausal women may be achieved by regulating abnormal kynurenine metabolism.",

      "abstract": "Introduction Tai chi, an ancient Chinese martial art, was originally developed for combat and self-defense. Over time, it has evolved into both a sport and a form of exercise. This gentle, low-impact exercise involves performing a series of deliberate, flowing motions while focusing on deep, slow breaths. This study investigates the effects of chen tai chi and aerobic exercises on cognition, balance, cardiopulmonary fitness, and quality of life in older adults. Methodology This study employed a single-blinded randomized control trial design, enrolling 60 participants aged between 60 and 75 years. Participants were divided into three groups: Group A (aerobics), Group B (chen tai chi), and Group C (control). Exercise sessions were held four days per week over a period of four weeks. Evaluations included the Montreal Cognitive Assessment for cognition, a one-leg stand test for static balance, a Timed Up and Go Test for dynamic balance, a six-minute walk test for cardiopulmonary fitness, and a health-related quality-of-life scale. Assessments were conducted at baseline, immediately after the intervention, and at follow-up was taken after eight weeks. Results Post-intervention, improvements were observed in cognition and static balance across all groups. Within-group analysis revealed that the aerobics group experienced statistically significant enhancements in cognition (p = 0.0001) and static balance (p = 0.01). Although no statistically significant differences were found between groups in terms of dynamic balance, cardiopulmonary fitness, and quality of life, the within-group analysis showed significant improvements in the aerobics group in dynamic balance (p = 0.0009), cardiopulmonary fitness (p = 0.03), and quality of life (p = 0.0001). Conclusion Compared to chen tai chi and no intervention, the study concludes that aerobic exercise has a more pronounced effect on improving cognition, balance, cardiopulmonary fitness, and quality of life in older adults. Aerobic exercise is recommended as an effective method to prevent frailty and promote independence among the elderly."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effects of Tai Chi in the treatment of patients with chronic low back pain by Meta-analysis and to investigate its influencing factors. METHODS: The study searched eight databases (PubMed, Embase, The Cochrane Library, Web of Science, China Knowledge Network, Wanfang, VIP, and CBM) from inception to October 2023. Two investigators independently selected 10 eligible randomized controlled trials (RCT) against inclusion and exclusion criteria, followed by data extraction and study quality assessment by ROB 2. The outcomes of interest were pain intensity and disability. The studies were combined using meta-analysis when statistical pooling of data was possible. The quality of the evidence was assessed using the GRADE approach. RESULTS: 10 randomized controlled studies with a total sample of 886 cases were included, of which 4 (40%) were assessed as low risk of bias. The effect size of Tai Chi for chronic low back pain was [Weighted Mean Difference (WMD) with 95% Confidence Interval (CI) = -1.09 (-1.26, -0.92), p < 0.01], all achieving large effect sizes and statistically significant; the effect size for disability was [Standard Mean Difference (SMD) with 95% CI = -1.75 (-2.02, -1.48), p < 0.01], and the combined effect sizes of physical health and mental health for quality of life were [WMD (95% CI) = 4.18 (3.41, 4.95), p < 0.01; WMD (95% CI) = 3.23 (2.42, 4.04), p < 0.01] respectively. The incidence of adverse reactions was low. Meta regression and subgroup analysis showed that there was no significant effect on intervention measures (Tai Chi alone, Tai Chi as additional therapy, water Tai Chi), Tai Chi school (Chen and Yang) and the number of total intervention sessions (> 30 and ≤ 30). The evidence quality evaluation showed that the evidence of pain, physical health of quality of life and mental health score was medium quality, while the evidence of disability and adverse reactions was low quality. CONCLUSIONS: Tai Chi has an obvious effect of in relieving chronic low back pain. Tai Chi alone and Tai Chi as supplementary therapy have good effects. Tai Chi in water have not been verified. Chen style Tai Chi and Yang's Tai Chi, intervention more than 30 times or less than 30 times had no significant difference in the effect of intervention on CLBP.",

Exercise plays an important role in PD management, and recent studies have reported improvement in motor symptoms and cognitive function following aerobic and Tai Chi Chuan exercise. AIM: To explore the different effects of Tai Chi Chuan and aerobic exercise on the clinical motor status and neurocognitive performance of patients with early-stage PD. DESIGN: A randomized controlled trial. SETTING: Parkinson's Disease Center at Kaohsiung Chang Gung Memorial Hospital and National Cheng Kung University Hospital. POPULATION: Patients with idiopathic PD. METHODS: Fifty-six patients with PD were recruited and divided into three groups: aerobic exercise (AE, N.=14), Tai Chi Chuan exercise (TE, N.=16), and control (CG, N.=13). Before and after a 12-week intervention period, we used unified Parkinson's disease rating scale Part III (UPDRS-III) scores and neuropsychological (e.g., accuracy rates [ARs] and reaction times [RTs]) and neurophysiological (e.g., event-related potential [ERP] N2 and P3 latencies and amplitudes) parameters to respectively assess the patients' clinical motor symptoms and neurocognitive performance when performing a working memory (WM) task. RESULTS: Compared to baseline, UPDRS-III scores were significantly lower in the AE and TE groups after the intervention period, whereas those for the CG group were higher. In terms of the neurocognitive parameters, when performing the WM task after the intervention period, the AE group exhibited significantly faster RTs and larger ERP P3 amplitudes, the TE group exhibited an improvement only in ERP P3 amplitude, and the CG group exhibited a significantly reduced ERP P3 amplitude. However, neither the TE nor the AE group exhibited improved ARs and ERP N2 performance. CONCLUSIONS: The present study supported the distinct effectiveness of Tai Chi Chuan and aerobic exercise for improving motor symptoms and providing neurocognitive benefits in PD patients. CLINICAL REHABILITATION IMPACT: These results have important implications regarding the use of these exercise interventions for managing PD, particularly in the early stages.",

This review investigated the effect of Tai Chi on disease and symptom management in COPD patients. METHODOLOGY: This study was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Protocols (PRISMA-P). RESULTS: The results showed that the Qigong, Sun, and Yang styles of Tai Chi are used for COPD patients. Trials compared Tai Chi with routine care, pulmonary rehabilitation added to routine care, and mind-body breathing. Tai Chi interventions were usually administered for a duration of 12 to 24 weeks. The results indicate that Tai Chi positively affects lung functions, exercise capacity, multidimensional perceived social support, diaphragm strength, quadriceps strength in the legs, self-care, self-efficacy, dyspnea, fatigue, anxiety, and depression. CONCLUSION: Tai Chi is a safe and effective exercise for COPD patients with comorbidities. It is superior to mind-body breathing and routine care and as good as pulmonary rehabilitation but is easier to practice. However, longer-term studies with larger samples are needed to validate the findings of the study.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Coronary heart disease (CHD) is the leading cause of death in both developed and many developing countries. Exercise training is a fundamental component of cardiac rehabilitation programs for patients with CHD. This study aims to investigate the effects of a Tai Chi rehabilitation program, which is provided through a hybrid online and offline mode, on oxidative stress and inflammatory responses in patients with CHD. METHODS: A total of 34 patients with coronary heart disease were randomly assigned to two groups: an experiment group (n = 14, age 62.07 ± 9.076 years) and a control group (n = 20, age 61.90 ± 9.700 years). The experiment group underwent a 12-week Tai Chi cardiac rehabilitation program (TCCRP), while the control group followed a conventional exercise rehabilitation program (CERP) consisting of 1-h sessions, 3 times per week, for a total of 36 sessions. Participants were studied at baseline and post-intervention. The main assessments include the levels of Malondialdehyde (MDA), Superoxide dismutase (SOD), Tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α) and Interleukin-10 (IL - 10) in blood samples. Pearson correlation analysis was used, and the differences between the two groups were subsequently tested using two-way repeated ANOVA. Statistical significance was defined as a two-sided p-value of <0.05. RESULTS: The key finding of the study reveals that MDA was significantly reduced by 1.027 nmoL/mL. Additionally, the TCCRP showed significant improvements in SOD and IL-10, with values of 10.110 U/mL and 2.441 pg./mL, respectively. Notably, a significant positive correlation was found between SOD and IL-10 (r = 0.689, p = 0.006), while MDA showed a significant positive correlation with TNF-a (r = 0.542, p = 0.045). In contrast, the ECRP group only showed a significant improvement in SOD. CONCLUSION: The study conducted a 12-week program on TCCRP, which utilized a hybrid online and offline model for individuals with coronary heart disease. The program showed promising results in alleviating oxidative stress and inflammation, possibly by regulating the balance between oxidative and antioxidative factors, as well as pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory factors.",

DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This was a multicenter randomized controlled trial. One hundred community-dwelling old adults with aMCI were randomly assigned (1:1) to experimental (n = 50) and control groups (n = 50). INTERVENTION: The experimental group participated in TC exercise 5 times/week, with each session lasting 60 minutes for 12 weeks. Both experimental and control groups received health education every 4 weeks. MEASUREMENTS: The primary outcome was global cognitive function. Neurocognitive assessments, MRI examination, and large-scale proteomics analysis of peripheric exosome were conducted at baseline and after 12-week training. Outcome assessors and statisticians were blinded to group allocation. RESULTS: A total of 96 participants (96%) completed all outcome measurements. TC training improved global cognitive function (adjusted mean difference [MD] = 1.9, 95%CI 0.93-2.87, p <0.001) and memory (adjusted MD = 6.42, 95%CI 2.09-10.74, p = 0.004), increased right hippocampus volume (adjusted MD = 88.52, 95%CI 13.63-163.4, p = 0.021), and enhanced rest state functional connectivity (rsFC) between hippocampus and cuneus, which mediated the group effect on global cognitive function (bootstrapping CIs: [0.0208, 1.2826], [0.0689, 1.2211]) and verbal delay recall (bootstrapping CI: [0.0002, 0.6277]). Simultaneously, 24 differentially expressed exosomal proteins were detected in tandem mass tag-labelling proteomic analysis. Of which, the candidate protein low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1) was further confirmed by parallel reaction monitoring and ELISA. Moreover, the up-regulated LRP1 was both positively associated with verbal delay recall and rsFC (left hippocampus-right cuneus). CONCLUSION: TC promotes LRP1 release via exosome, which was associated with enhanced memory function and hippocampus plasticity in aMCI patients. Our findings provided an insight into potential therapeutic neurobiological targets focusing on peripheric exosome in respond to TC exercise.",

Tai Chi Rouli Ball, a traditional Chinese sport, is thought to have beneficial effects on physical health, but its impact on bone health in perimenopausal women is not well understood. Methods This study involved a randomized controlled trial with 52 perimenopausal women aged 45-55 years from community senior centers. Participants were divided into two groups: the Tai Chi Rouli Ball group and the control group. Baseline assessments of bone density, bone mineral content (BMC), and bone metabolism markers, including estrogen levels, were conducted. The Tai Chi Rouli Ball group underwent regular training for a specific period, while the control group did not receive any intervention. Post-experiment assessments were then compared to the baseline. Results Post-intervention, the Tai Chi Rouli Ball group showed a significant increase in spine bone density and BMC in various body parts, including the whole body, trunk/torso, and spine, compared to the control group. Bone metabolism indicators also improved, with increased levels of estrogen and a decrease in follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH). Calcium levels showed a significant increase, while other markers like alkaline phosphatase (ALP), phosphorus (P), and magnesium (Mg) had non-significant changes. Conclusions Tai Chi Rouli Ball exercise may positively influence bone health by improving bone density, BMC, and altering bone metabolism markers in perimenopausal women. These findings suggest that Tai Chi Rouli Ball could be a viable non-pharmacological approach to prevent osteoporosis in this demographic.",

Efforts have been made to improve the MCI and prevent its progression, including the introduction of Tai Chi, a Chinese traditional exercise. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to evaluate the efficacy of Tai Chi in attenuating MCI among the elderly population. Records investigating the effect of Tai Chi exercise intervention on cognitive function among elderly patients were searched systematically from PubMed, ScienceDirect, Google Scholar, and Europe PMC as of April 13, 2023. The risk of bias (RoB 2.0) quality assessment was employed in the quality appraisal of the studies included. Review Manager 5.4.1 was used for data extraction and meta-analysis, where the standard mean difference (SMD) and 95% confidence interval (95%CI) were computed. Eight randomized control trials with a total of 1379 participants were included in this meta-analysis. Six trials assessed Montreal Cognitive Assessment scores, where its pooled analysis suggested that Tai Chi was as effective as conventional exercise (SMD=0.15, 95%CI: -0.11 to 0.40, p=0.26). However, pooled analysis of the Mini-Mental Status Examination suggested that Tai Chi intervention more effectively improved cognitive function and reduced the rate of cognitive impairment in elderly patients (SMD=0.36, 95%CI: 0.18 to 0.54, p<0.01) as compared to the control group. This systematic review and meta-analysis suggest that, in some extent, Tai Chi is efficacious in improving cognitive function and slowing down the rate of cognitive impairment among elderly patients.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Insomnia contributes to inflammation in breast cancer survivors. This study evaluates whether insomnia treatment reverses inflammation in breast cancer survivors with insomnia. METHODS: Participants (n = 90) were randomized to 3 months of Tai Chi (n = 45) or cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I)(n = 45), and followed for one year post-intervention to 15 month endpoint. Our previous report found that Tai Chi as compared to CBT-I resulted in similar rates of insomnia response and remission over 15 months. Here, we analyze changes in plasma C-reactive protein and pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines, Toll-like receptor (TLR)-4 stimulated monocyte production of interleukin (IL)-6 and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF), and cellular pro-inflammatory and anti-viral gene expression (Conserved Transcriptional Response to Adversity RNA profile; CTRA) over 15 months. RESULTS: Insomnia treatment resulted in decreases in the TLR-4 stimulated monocyte production of IL-6, TNF, and their co-expression, as well as decreases in the CTRA profile, decreases inflammatory gene transcripts, and increases in anti-viral gene transcripts over 15 months (all P's < 0.01). In addition, as compared to CBT-I, Tai Chi resulted in greater decreases in plasma IL-6 (P < 0.05), and greater decreases in TLR-4 activated monocyte production of IL-6 and co-expression of IL-6 and TNF at 15 month endpoint. CBT-I resulted in greater increases in anti-viral gene transcripts. CONCLUSIONS: Administration of either CBT-I or Tai Chi effectively treats insomnia, and shows additional benefits of reducing cellular and genomic markers of inflammation, and increasing anti-viral genomic markers in breast cancer survivors with insomnia. Tai Chi, as compared to CBT-I, yields greater and more durable decreases in systemic- and cellular inflammation. Targeting insomnia might mitigate the risk of inflammation-related co-morbidities in breast cancer survivors.",

      "abstract": "CONTEXT: Dyspnea, a prevalent and debilitating symptom in patients with advanced lung cancer, negatively affects symptom burden and prognosis. Physical activity has emerged as a promising non-pharmacological intervention for managing dyspnea. OBJECTIVES: This study compared the effectiveness of two widely-recognized physical activity modalities, namely Tai Chi (TC) and aerobic exercise (AE) for treating dyspnea in patients with advanced lung cancer. METHODS: Patients with advanced lung cancer (n=226) were randomized into TC, AE, or control groups. There was no baseline dyspnea requirement for patients. The AE group received two 60-minute supervised sessions and home-based exercises per month, the TC group received 60-minute sessions twice weekly, and the control group received exercise guidelines for 16 weeks. The primary outcome (sleep quality) of the study has been previously reported. In this secondary analysis, we focused on dyspnea outcomes, including overall and lung cancer-specific dyspnea. Assessments were conducted at baseline (T0), 16 weeks (T1), and one year (T2). RESULTS: Compared to the control group, TC significantly improved overall dyspnea at T1 (between-group difference, -8.69; P=0.03) and T2 (between-group difference, -11.45; P=0.01), but not AE. Both AE (between-group difference, -11.04; P=0.01) and TC (between-group difference, -14.19; P<0.001) significantly alleviated lung cancer-specific dyspnea at T2 compared with the control group. CONCLUSION: Both TC and AE alleviate dyspnea severity in patients with advanced lung cancer, and continuous exercise can yield substantial improvements. Due to its multi-component nature, Tai Chi has a greater effect on dyspnea.",

Ninety-four elderly patients with T2DM were randomly divided into an RT group (RTG, n = 23), TC group (TCG, n = 24), combination intervention group (CIG, n = 24) and control group (CG, n = 23). All participants were given nutrition and medication. On this basis, RTG, TCG and CIG were administered for 24 weeks (3 times/week, 40 minutes/time). Observation indicators were malondialdehyde (MDA), superoxide dismutase (SOD), 8-hydroxy-2 deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), fasting plasma glucose (FPG), postprandial plasma glucose (PPG), haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and diabetes specific quality of life (DSQL). RT, TC and joint intervention can reduce the oxidative stress damage on elderly patients with T2DM to different degrees, control the levels of blood sugar and blood lipid and improve the quality of life. Compared with single intervention, combination intervention can further reduce the level of oxidative stress but has no additional benefits on blood glucose and lipid control and quality of life.",

This study aimed to compare the effectiveness of aerobic exercise and Tai Chi on perceived cognitive function and the mediating role of psychoneurological symptoms with perceived cognitive impairment. METHODS: In a subgroup of a parent randomized clinical trial, participants who reported cognitive impairment underwent a 16-week aerobic exercise (n = 49), Tai Chi (n = 48), and control (n = 54) groups. Measures included perceived cognitive function and psychoneurological symptoms (sleep disturbance, fatigue, anxiety, and depression) assessed at baseline (T0), 16-week (T1), and 1 year (T2). RESULTS: Participants in Tai Chi showed significant improvements compared to aerobic exercise and control groups in perceived cognitive function at T1 (AE: between-group difference, 6.52; P < 0.001; CG: 8.34; P < 0.001) and T2 (AE: between-group difference, 3.55; P = 0.05; CG: 5.94; P < 0.001). Sleep disturbance, fatigue, anxiety, and depression at month 12 explained 24%, 31%, 32%, and 24% of the effect of the intervention on cognitive function at month 12, respectively. Only anxiety at month 4 explained 23% of the intervention effect at month 12. CONCLUSIONS: Tai Chi demonstrated beneficial effects on cognitive function in advanced lung cancer survivors with perceived cognitive impairment. Improvement in cognitive function was mediated by reducing sleep disturbance, fatigue, anxiety, and depression, highlighting the importance of addressing these symptoms in future interventions to improve cognitive function, with anxiety playing a significant role at an earlier stage. IMPLICATIONS FOR CANCER SURVIVORS: Tai Chi is a potentially safe complementary therapeutic option for managing cognitive impairment in this vulnerable population.

Thirty-four male participants completed the study. RESULTS: A total of seven items had statistically significant differences at 12- and 16-week posttest, respectively: frailty index (p = 0.03; p = 0.03); Instrumental Activities of Daily Living Scale (p < 0.001; p < 0.001); and physical fitness, back (p < 0.001; p < 0.001); physical fitness, arm curl (p = 0.02; p < 0.001); physical activity (p < 0.001; p = 0.009); quality of life, physiological (p = 0.04; p < 0.001); and heart rate variability (p < 0.001; p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Results revealed substantial improvements in physical fitness, frailty conditions, self-care abilities, and quality of life, but not balance or lower limb flexibility, for the experimental group.

However, non-consistency exists in the results of the effect of Tai Chi training on standing balance control in older adults. This study aimed to use traditional and non-traditional methods to investigate the effect of Tai Chi on standing balance in older adults. METHODS: Thirty-six Tai Chi practitioners (TC group) and thirty-six older adults with no Tai Chi practice (control group) were recruited in this study. A Nintendo Wii Balance Board was used to record the center of pressure (COP) during standing balance over 20 s in the condition of eyes closed with three repetitions. The wavelet analysis, multiscale entropy, recurrence quantification analysis, and traditional methods were used to evaluate the standing balance control in the anterior-posterior (AP) and mediolateral (ML) directions. RESULTS: (1) Greater sway mean velocity in the AP direction and sway Path length were found in the TC group compared with the control group; (2) lower Very-low frequency band (0.10-0.39 Hz) and higher Moderate frequency band (1.56-6.25 Hz) in the AP and ML directions were found in the TC group compared with the control group; (3) greater complexity index (CI) and lower determinism (DET) in the AP and ML directions were observed in the TC group compared with control group; (4) greater path length linked with smaller Very-low frequency band in the AP and ML directions and higher Moderate frequency band in the AP direction in both groups; (5) greater path length linked with lower DET and higher CI in the AP direction only in the TC group. CONCLUSION: Long-term Tai Chi practice improved sensory reweighting (more reliance on the proprioception system and less reliance on the vestibular system) and complexity of standing balance control in older adults. In addition, greater sway velocity may be as an exploratory role in standing balance control of TC older adults, which correlated with greater complexity, but no such significant relationship in the control group. Therefore, the effects of Tai Chi practice on standing balance control in older adults may be attributed to the improvement of sensory reweighting and complexity rather than reduced sway velocity or amplitude."

Additionally, we perform moderator analysis to examine whether effects vary based on patient features, TCQ stimuli properties, or characteristics of research design. METHODS: Guided by PRISMA guidelines, we located articles published before August 31, 2023 using a combination of electronic database search and a complementary manual search through reference lists of articles and published reviews. Two separate multilevel meta-analyses with random-effects model were employed to estimate the overall effect of TCQ on depression and anxiety respectively. Further, multilevel meta-regression analysis was utilized to examine moderating effects based on moderators derived from patient features, TCQ stimuli properties, or characteristics associated with research design. Meta-analyses were performed in R4.0.0 and certainty of evidence with GRADEpro software. RESULTS: The TCQ intervention yielded a standardized mean effect size of 0.29 (95% CI, 0.18 to 0.40) for anxiety, indicating homogeneity among the included studies. Conversely, for depression, the standardized mean effect size was 0.35 (95% CI, 0.14 to 0.55), signifying heterogeneity: reductions were larger when the trial primary outcome, predominantly function-related outcomes, changed significantly between the TCQ and control group. CONCLUSIONS: TCQ practice exhibits small-to-moderate efficacy in alleviating depression and anxiety symptoms among cancer patients and survivors. Moreover, patients with depressive symptoms for whom TCQ intervention coupled with improvements in function-related outcomes manifested greater antidepressant effect.",

Lifestyle intervention strategies incorporating Tai Chi or conventional exercise have been shown to alleviate symptoms of insomnia and depression. However, the comparative efficacy of these exercise modalities in individuals with both disorders has yet to be determined. Therefore, the aim of this study is to examine the efficacy of Tai Chi and conventional exercise for reducing depressive symptoms in older adults with chronic insomnia and depressive symptoms, when compared to a health education control. METHODS: This study is a prospective, assessor-blinded, three-arm, parallel group, randomized controlled trial. Older adults aged ≥60 years with a diagnosis of chronic insomnia and depressive symptoms will be randomly assigned to a Tai Chi, conventional exercise or health education control condition on a 1:1:1 basis. Interventions will last for 3 months, with a 6-month follow-up period. The primary outcome is depressive symptoms, assessed using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. Secondary outcomes include subjective sleep quality, 7-day actigraphy, 7-day sleep diary, anxiety symptoms, quality of life, medication usage and physical function. All measurements will be conducted at baseline, 3 months and 9 months by outcome assessors who are blinded to group allocation. DISCUSSION: This study will compare the efficacy of Tai Chi and conventional exercise in improving depression outcomes in older adults with chronic insomnia and depressive symptoms. Our results will shed light on the clinical potential of these interventions for combating insomnia and depression in older adults."

Consequently, enhancing the sleep quality of this demographic population has become a pressing concern. The objective of this study was to investigate the influence of an 8-week Tai Chi exercise intervention in the sleep quality of older adults. METHODS: Sixty individuals aged 60 years and above, recruited from the community around Southwest University in Beibei District, Chongqing City, were randomly assigned to either a control group (30 participants) or an intervention group (30 participants). The control group adhered to their normal daily routines during the 8-week experimental period, while the intervention group engaged in a 60-min Tai Chi practice three times a week for 8 weeks. Sleep quality was assessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), and the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS). Additionally, the Polysomnographic Sleep Quality Monitoring System (PSG) was employed to monitor the sleep process before and after the Tai Chi intervention. RESULTS: After the experiment, significant differences were observed in PSQI and IEI scores between the intervention and control groups (p < 0.05). In the experimental group, the pre-post comparisons revealed a significant increase in time spent in bed (p < 0.05), total sleep time (p < 0.05), and non-REM sleep stage 2 (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The findings indicate that Tai Chi exercise may improve subjective reported sleep quality. In addition, Tai Chi exercise may alleviate general drowsiness, extend sleep duration, and optimize the sleep process and structure. Consequently, Tai Chi exercise may be a suitable exercise to improve sleep quality in older individuals."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: College students, undergoing crucial cognitive development, face challenges during the COVID-19 pandemic that impact their executive functions. While existing research indicates positive effects of Tai Chi (TC) on college students' cognitive abilities, there is a scarcity of studies investigating its impact on executive functions and frontal brain activity. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to compare the effects of 24-form simplified TC training on college students' executive functions and frontal brain electrical activity. The hypothesis posited that the TC group would exhibit superior performance compared to the control group during COVID-19 pandemic. METHOD: Seventy college students were randomly assigned to either TC group or control group, engaging in 36 sessions (3 sessions per week, 45 min each) over 12 weeks. Executive inhibitory control was assessed using the Stroop Color and Word Test, and resting brain electrical activity in the frontal area was recorded through Electroencephalography. RESULT: ACC was influenced by group, group-time interaction, and Stroop task-time interaction. RT was affected by time, task condition, task condition-time interaction, and task condition-group interaction. Notably, the TC group showed improved ACC (from 96.54 ± 3.27% to 98.90 ± 1.32%) and decreased RT (from 0.73 ± 0.12 to 0.66 ± 0.07 s), particularly in the inconsistent task. Regarding EEG band power, significant Group and Time interaction effects were found in F3-θ, F3-α, F3-β, F4-θ, and F4-α. Moreover, within the TC group, significant increases in F3-θ band power (from 4.66 ± 3.55 to 7.71 ± 8.44) and F4-θ band power (from 4.41 ± 2.82 to 8.61 ± 9.51) (10-3·μV·Hz) were noted pre-and post-tests. In the control group, significant decreases were observed in F3-α band power (from 5.18 ± 4.61 to 2.79 ± 2.11) and F4-α band power (from 5.57 ± 6.58 to 2.48 ± 1.95) (10-3·μV·Hz). CONCLUSION: The pandemic-induced panic may impact frontal lobe brain activity in college students. TC training not only improves executive inhibitory control but may also enhance localized brain activity, suggesting its potential as a holistic intervention for cognitive and neurological well-being during stressful periods."

We compared the effects for finding an optimal intervention. METHODS: We searched 12 databases, including PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) and so on, from their inception to January 13, 2023. Randomized controlled trials incorporating different types of Tai Chi for preventing falls in older adults were included. The outcome measures were the incidence of falls and Berg Balance Scale (BBS). Network meta-analysis (NMA) was conducted using Stata 15.1 based on a frequentist framework. RESULTS: Seventeen trials were eligible, including 3470 participants and four types of Tai Chi. They were 24-form simplified Tai Chi (24-form), Yang style Tai Chi (Yang style), Sun style Tai Chi (Sun style) and Tai Chi exercise program (TCEP). In paired meta-analysis, for incidence of falls, 24-form (Relative Risk (RR) = 0.59, 95% confidence interval (CI) [0.40, 0.86]) was more efficient than the control group. For BBS outcome, 24-form (MD (mean difference) = 2.32, 95% CI [1.42, 3.22]) was better than the control group. In the NMA, the results of incidence of falls were as follows: 24-form > Yang style > Sun style > control > TCEP. The rank probability of BBS was as follows: 24-form > TCEP > Yang style > control. CONCLUSION: Among the four types of Tai Chi studied, the 24-form simplified Tai Chi has shown better efficacy than other types.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Although Tai Chi (TC) is an evidence-based fall prevention training for older adults, its effective movements remain unclear, which may limit the practice of TC. The purpose of this study was to compare the effectiveness of TC lower extremity exercise (TC LEE), the 8-form Tai Chi (8-form TC), and a stretching control intervention for improving balance and functional mobility among older adults. METHODS: This was a randomized controlled trial. A total of 102 participants (79 ± 6 years old) were recruited from assisted living facilities. All participants were randomly assigned to the TC LEE (n = 40), 8-form TC (n = 31), and stretching (n = 31) groups in which they received the respective interventions for 16 weeks. The Berg Balance Scale (BBS), Timed Up and Go (TUG) test, and center of pressure (COP) measurements during quiet stance were collected prior to and following the 16-week interventions. Comparisons on all measurements were conducted among all groups. RESULTS: Significant improvements were found in BBS (P = 0.002), TUG test (P = 0.001), root mean square amplitude of COP displacement in the anterior-posterior (P = 0.001) and medial-lateral (P = 0.001) directions, and average COP speed in the anterior-posterior (P = 0.001) and medial-lateral (P = 0.001) directions after training in the TC intervention groups compared with the stretching group. The upper limit of the 95% confidence interval (CI) of differences in change scores on the BBS (-0.8 - 1.3 points) between the TC LEE group and the 8-form TC group was within equivalence margins (1.8 points), while the upper limit of the 95% CI of differences in change scores on the TUG test (0.1 - 2.1 s) exceeded the equivalence margin (0.7 s) with the TC LEE group having the larger change scores. CONCLUSION: TC LEE can improve balance and functional mobility in older adults, and may have greater effect than the 8-form TC on improving functional mobility as measured by the TUG test.

However, a majority of existing studies have employed the single routine (SR) protocol as the basis for health interventions. The extent to which the gong routine application (GRA) protocol achieves similar levels of exercise load stimulation as traditional single practice routines remains uncertain. Therefore, this study the distinct characteristics of autonomic load stimulation in these different protocols, thus providing a biological foundation to support the development of Tai Chi health promotion intervention programs. we recruited a cohort of forty-five university students to participate in the 15 min GRA protocol and SR protocol. We collected heart rate and heart rate variability indicators during periods of rest, GRA protocol, and SR protocol utilizing the Polar Scale. Additionally, we assessed the mental state of the participants using the BFS State of Mind Scale. In summary, the autonomic load is lower in the GRA protocol compared to the SR protocol, with lower sympathetic activity but higher parasympathetic activity in the former. Results are specific to college students, additional research is necessary to extend support for frail older adults. It is advised to incorporate GRA protocol alongside SR protocol in Tai Chi instruction. This approach is likely to enhance Tai Chi skills and yield greater health benefits.",

DATA SOURCE: This review followed the guidelines of the updated PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) 2020. A systematic search in five electronic databases (Medline via PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, PEDro, and OTseeker) was performed. STUDY INCLUSION AND EXCLUSION CRITERIA: Randomized control trials (RCTs) examining Tai Chi interventions to improve HRQoL in patients with neurodegenerative diseases published through March 2023 were included. DATA EXTRACTION: Data were extracted from each study by two independent researchers into a data extraction form based on the Cochrane recommendations. Methodological quality and risk of bias were assessed. DATA SYNTHESIS: A meta-analysis was performed using Review Manager 5.3 software. RESULTS: Of the 439 records that were screened, eight RCTs met the eligibility criteria. They assessed cognitive decline (n = 2) or Parkinson's disease (n = 6). RCT comparison groups included active interventions or usual care. The duration of Tai Chi therapy ranged from 8 to 24 weeks. A sensitivity analysis using a fixed effect model indicated that Tai Chi therapy significantly increased HRQoL [P < 001, SMD (95% CI) = .41 [.21, .60], I2 = 4%]. CONCLUSION: Tai Chi can effectively improve the HRQoL of people with neurodegenerative diseases, but the heterogeneity across intervention was relatively high. Further studies are needed as research into the benefits of Tai Chi in neurodegenerative disease rehabilitation is still limited.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Cognitive decline is an important and common complication in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) since it significantly reduces the quality of life. A breakthrough in treating and preventing cognitive decline in PD remains to be achieved. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of high-frequency and intensive multimodal training in improving motor and cognitive function. METHODS: Twenty-eight patients diagnosed with idiopathic PD completed a comprehensive neuropsychological test battery and were neurologically examined. The patients of the intervention group (n = 15) underwent 2 weekly sessions of Tai Chi therapy over 4 weeks and participated in an individually tailored training program consisting of two modules (smartphone-based speech training and cognitive training). A matched control group consisted of n = 13 patients with PD who received computer-assisted cognitive training. The data were analyzed with repeated-measures ANOVA. RESULTS: Four weeks of high-frequency training showed significant effects on verbal and figural episodic memory and visuospatial function in the intervention group.Compared to the control group, the cognitive performance of the intervention group improved significantly in visuospatial function and figural episodic memory. A significant improvement was also shown in the intervention group in the Tinetti Mobility Test and the Epworth Sleepiness Scale. The significant effects in the Tinetti mobility test remained after the 6 months follow-up. After the intervention, the patients reported high motivation and satisfaction with the multimodal training. CONCLUSION: In patients with PD, a multimodal training program not only improves gait and stability but may also contribute to improving cognition.

      "abstract": "Hypertension is a prevalent chronic condition worldwide that can impact patients' quality of life. Oral antihypertensive drugs are widely used to manage high blood pressure, primarily by regulating the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. Nevertheless, limited efficacy and low compliance represent significant obstacles, arising primarily from dose, duration, and medication type restrictions. Furthermore, the prolonged use of antihypertensive medication may result in dependence and adverse effects, without any substantial improvement in achieving targeted blood pressure leves. As a result, research has focused on using exercise therapy to treat hypertension. Tai Chi, a widely-practiced Chinese health exercise, has evolved into a form of exercise therapy that might help alleviate the risk associated with hypertension. Therefore, this article aims to outline the role of Tai Chi in preventing and managing hypertension.",

      "abstract": "IMPORTANCE: Prehypertension increases the risk of developing hypertension and other cardiovascular diseases. Early and effective intervention for patients with prehypertension is highly important. OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy of Tai Chi vs aerobic exercise in patients with prehypertension. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This prospective, single-blinded randomized clinical trial was conducted between July 25, 2019, and January 24, 2022, at 2 tertiary public hospitals in China. Participants included 342 adults aged 18 to 65 years with prehypertension, defined as systolic blood pressure (SBP) of 120 to 139 mm Hg and/or diastolic BP (DBP) of 80 to 89 mm Hg. INTERVENTIONS: Participants were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to a Tai Chi group (n = 173) or an aerobic exercise group (n = 169). Both groups performed four 60-minute supervised sessions per week for 12 months. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was SBP at 12 months obtained in the office setting. Secondary outcomes included SBP at 6 months and DBP at 6 and 12 months obtained in the office setting and 24-hour ambulatory BP at 12 months. RESULTS: Of the 1189 patients screened, 342 (mean [SD] age, 49.3 [11.9] years; 166 men [48.5%] and 176 women [51.5%]) were randomized to 1 of 2 intervention groups: 173 to Tai Chi and 169 to aerobic exercise. At 12 months, the change in office SBP was significantly different between groups by -2.40 (95% CI, -4.39 to -0.41) mm Hg (P = .02), with a mean (SD) change of -7.01 (10.12) mm Hg in the Tai Chi group vs -4.61 (8.47) mm Hg in the aerobic exercise group. The analysis of office SBP at 6 months yielded similar results (-2.31 [95% CI, -3.94 to -0.67] mm Hg; P = .006). Additionally, 24-hour ambulatory SBP (-2.16 [95% CI, -3.84 to -0.47] mm Hg; P = .01) and nighttime ambulatory SBP (-4.08 [95% CI, -6.59 to -1.57] mm Hg; P = .002) were significantly reduced in the Tai Chi group compared with the aerobic exercise group. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this study including patients with prehypertension, a 12-month Tai Chi intervention was more effective than aerobic exercise in reducing SBP. These findings suggest that Tai Chi may help promote the prevention of cardiovascular disease in populations with prehypertension.
