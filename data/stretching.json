      "abstract": "Polysaccharide-based hydrogels are widely utilized in the food industry and materials science due to their safety and abundance from natural sources. However, their functionality is often limited by poor mechanical properties, primarily due to their simple and isotropic structures. In this study, the stretching-dehydration (SD) processing was applied to create anisotropic structure and enhance the mechanical properties in polysaccharide-based hydrogels, specifically sodium alginate (SA), pectin (PE), gellan gum (GG), and curdlan (CU). Among these, low molecular weight sodium alginate (SA-L) hydrogel exhibited notable stretching-induced anisotropy and structural stability during dehydration. Furthermore, increasing the controlled strains (CSN) could improve anisotropy, stretching strength, and Young's modulus which reached up to 100 MPa in anisotropic SA-L hydrogel. The anisotropic hydrogels closely mimicked the microstructure of whole-muscle foods. Sensory evaluations highlighted the enhanced chewiness and hardness, suggesting the anisotropic hydrogels are promising candidates for emulating whole-muscle textures. This work highlights the potential of anisotropic hydrogels produced through simple SD treatment as advanced materials for both food and biomimetic applications.",

      "abstract": "AIMS: Dynamic muscle stretching exercises are one of the interventions frequently prescribed by physiotherapists for children with cerebral palsy (CP). However, there is wide variability in the exercise regimes used and limited evidence of their effectiveness. The SPELL trial will assess the clinical effectiveness of an individually tailored dynamic stretching programme, compared to usual care for ambulant children with spastic CP. METHODS: We are conducting a multicentre, two-arm, parallel group, superiority randomized controlled trial. We will recruit children aged four to 11 years with a diagnosis of spastic CP (bilateral or unilateral) and Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) levels I to III who are able to comply with assessment procedures and exercise programme with or without support. Participants will be recruited from at least 12 UK NHS Trust physiotherapy and related services. Participants (n = 334) will be randomized (centralized computer-generated one:one allocation ratio) to either: 1) a dynamic stretching exercise programme, with six one-to-one physiotherapy sessions over 16 weeks; or 2) usual NHS care, with a single physiotherapy session and an assessment, and advice regarding self-management and exercise. CONCLUSION: The primary outcome is functional mobility measured using the child-/parent-reported Gait Outcomes Assessment List (GOAL) at six months. Secondary outcomes are: joint range of motion (Cerebral Palsy Integrated Pathway protocol) and motor function (timed up and go test) at six months; functional mobility (GOAL) at 12 months; independence (GOAL subdomain A); balance (GOAL subdomain A, B, D); pain and discomfort (GOAL subdomain C); health-related quality of life (youth version of the EuroQol five-dimension questionnaire (EQ-5D-Y)); educational attendance; exercise adherence; and additional physiotherapy treatment at six and 12 months. The primary analysis will be intention to treat."

      "abstract": "Stretching a nerve more than 5% of its resting length for an extended period can result within changes dysfunction and ischemia. Nerve damage known as neuropathy can range from minor sensory changes like tingling or numbness to more severe injuries such as paralysis. 55-year-old male without significant past medical history experienced numbness, pain, and tingling in his left arm and forearm while lifting weights. An Electromyography-Nerve Conduction Study indicated multiple active root irritations on the left side at levels C5-C8. A Magnetic Resonance Image of the cervical spine showed a hyperintense signal lesion in the area of the cervical spinal cord from C2-C5 vertebrae, ruling out cervical myelitis. His symptoms gradually improved and were relieved for approximately 5 months with minimal signs, but recurred during daily activities. This second episode has lasted 12 months with ongoing treatment. After 12 months of follow-up, his issue has diminished but remains unresolved. It is uncommon to observe peripheral or peripheral-like symptoms in patients with recurrent peripheral neuritis and myelitis affecting only the left upper extremity. The study was approved by the ethics committee of Shiraz University of Medical Sciences with the code of IR.Sums.Med.Rec.1403.154. The patient signed the written informed consent form to document this case and include the accompanying images. It is unusual to see peripheral or peripheral-like symptoms in patients experiencing recurrent myelitis and peripheral neuritis and specifically affecting the left upper extremity. The exacerbation of symptoms when lying down on the affected side and stretching nerves is also significant. This unique presentation may be attributed to the reduced muscle mass in the proximal muscles of the upper extremity, making the nerve roots more susceptible to damage during weightlifting."

However, the effectiveness of tissue release and stretching strategies in managing pain and fatigue of neck muscles in employees affected by ns-CNP has not been assessed. METHODS: Thirty-nine employees who suffered from ns-CNP were randomly assigned to stretching, tissue release interventions or control group (n = 13). Neck pain and fatigue in neck extensors, upper trapezius, and sternocleidomastoid muscles were measured during 40 min of typing with a 45-degree head flexion at baseline and immediately after a 6-week intervention using visual analog scale and surface electromyography. RESULTS: Pain significantly decreased after 6 weeks of both interventions (p < 0.05). There were no significant within-group differences for right cervical muscle fatigue in the intervention groups, but a significant difference was noted in the control group at the 25th and 40th minutes (p < 0.05). Additionally, a significant difference was observed between the release and control group at the 30th, 35th, and 40th minutes (p < 0.05). Left cervical muscle fatigue significantly decreased at the 25th and 40th minutes only for the release group (p < 0.05). A significant difference was observed between the release and control groups at the 40th minute for the right upper trapezius (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Only the stretching group showed a significant difference with the control in the left sternocleidomastoid at the 10th and 15th minutes, and the release group with the control in the last 5-min. Stretching and release interventions could control neck pain and muscle fatigue in the 45-degree head flexion position."

      "abstract": "AIM: This study aims to evaluate the impact of adding bilateral hamstring muscle stretching to pressure pain threshold and ultrasound therapy, compared to using pressure pain threshold and ultrasound therapy alone, on pain reduction and maximum vertical mouth opening (MVMO) in individuals with temporomandibular disorders (TMD). MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 56 participants diagnosed with TMD were randomly allocated into 2 groups: The Experimental Group, which received bilateral hamstring stretching, pressure pain threshold application, and ultrasound therapy, and the control group, which received only pressure pain threshold and ultrasound therapy. The study included participants of both genders, aged between 18 and 35 years, with a previous history of TMD pain lasting no longer than 6 months. Assessments were conducted at baseline and after 5 treatment sessions per week over 1 week. Pain levels were measured using the visual analog scale (VAS), and MVMO was assessed using a vernier caliper. Data were recorded and statistically analyzed. RESULTS: The results showed a significant reduction in pain and an increase in MVMO in both groups. In the Experimental Group, the mean pain score on the VAS decreased from 6.8 ± 1.2 to 2.9 ± 1.1, whereas in the control group, it decreased from 6.7 ± 1.3 to 4.1 ± 1.2 (p < 0.001). Similarly, MVMO improved significantly, with an increase from 31.4 ± 2.6 mm to 39.8 ± 2.1 mm in the Experimental Group, compared to an increase from 31.2 ± 2.8 mm to 36.1 ± 2.4 mm in the control group (p < 0.001). The between-group comparison showed a significant difference in pain reduction and MVMO improvement in the Experimental Group compared to the control group (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Hamstring stretching combined with ultrasound therapy and pressure pain threshold application was significantly more effective in reducing TMD-related pain and improving MVMO than pressure pain threshold and ultrasound therapy alone. These findings indicate that integrating hamstring stretching into TMD treatment protocols could improve rehabilitation outcomes. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: The findings of this study highlight the potential benefits of integrating hamstring stretching into standard physiotherapy interventions for TMD. Given the significant improvements observed in pain reduction and MVMO, clinicians may consider including hamstring flexibility exercises in rehabilitation programs for TMD patients to achieve better functional outcomes.

In 'conventional self-stretching', the subject used the strength of their own hands to dorsiflex the toes and dorsiflex and evert the ankle. In 'weight-bearing stretching', the participants instead weight-bearing to facilitate the dorsiflexion. In this crossover trial, the participants were 13 healthy men. They performed either conventional self-stretching, weight-bearing stretching, or a control trial on different days. Before and then after the intervention, we measured the shear modulus of the FDL and TP using shear wave elastography as an index of muscle stiffness. To compare the changes in the shear modulus following the different stretching methods, we performed a two-way repeated measures analysis of variance with Holm correction with type of intervention and time of measurement as variables. A significant interaction was found for the shear modulus of the FDL. After weight-bearing stretching, the shear modulus was significantly lower than before the intervention and at the same timing in the control trial (p < 0.05). Conversely, no significant differences in the shear modulus of the FDL were observed before or after the control trial and conventional self-stretching (p > 0.05). Neither the main effects nor interactions were observed for the shear modulus of the TP, and no effect was observed by any interventions (p > 0.05). Weight-bearing stretching is suggested by these results to have some efficacy for the stretching of the FDL."

      "abstract": "One of the challenges of laparoscopic liver resection (LLR) is the exposure of the surgical field. We propose a new surgical approach to better expose the right liver, stretching of the ligamentum teres hepatis (SLTH), and we evaluated its clinical feasibility and limitations through a study analyzing relevant cases. Clinicopathologic data on patients who underwent laparoscopic right partial hepatectomy (LRPH) at our center were retrospectively collected, and subjects were 276 patients with liver space-occupying lesions who met the selection criteria and who underwent the new surgical approach (SLTH) or the conventional surgical approach (no stretching of the ligamentum teres hepatis, or NSLTH). After 1:1 propensity score matching (PSM), 102 patients in each cohort were selected for further analysis. There were no significant differences in the operating time or the duration of postoperative hospitalization between the SLTH cohort and the NSLTH cohort. The duration of detachment of the hepatic parenchyma and the duration of hepatic portal occlusion were significantly shorter in the SLTH cohort than in the NSLTH cohort. The intraoperative blood loss in the SLTH cohort was significantly less than that in the NSLTH cohort. Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels were significantly lower in the SLTH cohort than in the NSLTH cohort on day 5 postoperatively. Results confirmed that SLTH is a simple, safe, effective, and highly reproducible technique for the treatment of LRPH. SLTH may help to perform LRPH by increasing the level of laparoscopic exposure of the right liver and reducing bleeding and operating time."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The interest in and use of mechanical percussive massage treatment devices have grown immensely among clinicians and athletes. One purported benefit of these devices is the improvement of range of motion but whether these devices are more effective than traditional means of increasing muscle extensibility remains unexplored. PURPOSE: To examine the effect of mechanical percussive massage therapy applied to the hamstrings versus static stretching of the hamstrings on passive knee extension (PKE) range of motion. STUDY DESIGN: Randomized control trial. METHODS: Male Division II NAIA and Division III NCAA football players were recruited. Subjects were randomly assigned to one of three groups: control, mechanical percussive massage therapy, or static stretching. Passive hamstring extensibility was quantified in all groups using standard goniometric measurements before and after the intervention by measuring PKE three times in a 90-90 supine position. The mechanical percussive massage therapy group received five minutes of treatment to the hamstrings. The static stretching group received manual stretching of the hamstrings performed in the 90-90 supine position (3 repetitions of 30 seconds with 10-second rest between repetitions). The control group received no treatment. An ANOVA was used to investigate effects of the random interventions. RESULTS: Seventy-nine male collegiate football players, 37 NCAA Division III and 42 NAIA Division II (mean age 19.8 years +/- 1.2) participated in this study. A significant difference (p < .001) in pre- and post-PKE range of motion was noted for both the percussive mechanical massage therapy (5.8 degrees, SD+/- 3.32) and static stretching (6 degrees, SD+/- 3.29) groups. No significant difference was noted between the two treatment groups. The control group did not demonstrate a significant difference in pre and post-PKE (1.1 degrees, SD +/- 3.62). CONCLUSIONS: Static stretching and mechanical percussive massage therapy applied to the hamstrings produce significant immediate increases in PKE compared to a control group suggesting that static hamstring stretching, and mechanical percussive massage therapy are both viable options for acutely increasing hamstring extensibility. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: II."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Static stretching (SS) is routinely used in sports and clinical settings to increase joint range of motion (ROM). However, the mechanisms underlying improvements in ROM remain unclear. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to determine the effects of a single session (acute) and multiple sessions (chronic) of SS on stretch tolerance, passive stiffness and fascicle length, and whether such effects are moderated by specific training parameters and participant characteristics. A secondary aim was to explore the mechanisms associated with improved ROM. METHODS: Seven databases (CINAHL Complete, Cochrane CENTRAL, Embase, Emcare, MEDLINE, Scopus and SPORTDiscus) were systematically searched up to 6 June, 2024. Randomised and non-randomised controlled trials investigating the effects of acute (single session) or chronic (two or more sessions) SS on muscle-tendon unit structure (fascicle length), mechanical properties (stiffness) or stretch tolerance (maximum tolerable passive resistive torque) compared to non-stretching passive controls (adults aged ≥ 18 years) were included. The effects of SS were examined using a multi-level meta-analysis, with associations between changes in maximum tolerable passive resistive torque, stiffness and fascicle length with improvements in ROM examined using multivariate meta-regression. RESULTS: Data from 65 studies representing 1542 adults (71% male; mean ± standard deviation age = 26.1 ± 11 years) were included. We found a small decrease in overall stiffness following both acute (Hedges' g = 0.42, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.21, 0.63, p < 0.001) and chronic SS (Hedges' g = 0.37, 95% confidence interval 0.18, 0.56, p < 0.001), and a moderate increase in maximum tolerable passive resistive torque following chronic SS (Hedges' g = 0.74, 95% CI 0.38, 1.10, p < 0.001). Neither acute nor chronic SS had a significant effect on fascicle length. For acute SS, greater reductions in overall stiffness were found with moderate (p < 0.002) and high SS intensities (p = 0.02) compared with low-intensity SS, and in individuals with normal flexibility compared with those with poor flexibility at baseline (p < 0.001). Conversely, the effects of chronic SS on overall stiffness and maximum tolerable passive resistive torque were not moderated by stretching intensity, intervention length, baseline flexibility or sex (p > 0.05). Last, improved ROM following chronic SS was significantly associated with both decreased overall stiffness (g = 0.59, 95% CI 0.08, 1.10, p = 0.03) and increased maximum tolerable passive resistive torque (g = 0.74, 95% CI 0.41, 1.09, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: While both acute and chronic SS reduced overall stiffness, stretch tolerance only increased following chronic SS. Neither acute nor chronic SS altered fascicle length. The effect of acute SS on reduced overall stiffness was greater when stretching at a moderate or higher intensity and in those with normal flexibility. Increased ROM was significantly associated with decreased overall stiffness and increased stretch tolerance following chronic SS. Understanding the mechanisms underlying SS will assist coaches and clinicians in deciding whether and when to prescribe SS to their athletes and patients.

A scoping review of the literature was conducted in December 2024, using four databases. Experimental and clinical studies were included if they compared stretching exercises with non-stretching exercises for T2DM-related health outcomes. The primary search terms used were \"diabetes mellitus, type 2,\" \"muscle stretching exercises,\" and \"range of motion, articular.\". Eleven studies met our inclusion criteria. Eight studies focused on blood glucose levels, one of which assessed the functional capacity. The remaining studies investigated plantar pressure, shoulder joint mobility/pain/disability, and fatigue, with one study addressing each outcome. This review indicates that stretching exercises may affect a variety of health parameters, including blood glucose regulation, in patients with T2DM but emphasizes the need for further high-quality research to determine their effectiveness."

METHODS: Ninety adults with leg tightness and/or suspected sarcopenia (age: 66.8 ± 4.9 years) were randomly allocated to two subtypes of intervention at home: resistance-band exercise (RE) or eccentric exercise (ECC) for those with weakness; static or dynamic stretching for those with tightness; and static stretching plus ECC or no exercise for those with both muscle tightness and weakness. The program consisted of 3-6 weekly sessions over eight weeks. Blinded outcome assessments before and after the eight-week program and at the three-month follow-up included mobility performance via Timed Up-and-Go (TUG), and flexibility and strength tests, as well as measurement of stiffness. RESULTS: All groups had increased peak torque after eight weeks and improved TUG at the three-month follow-up (p < 0.05). Improved plantar flexor strength persisted at the three-month follow-up (p = 0.009). In addition, the RE and ECC groups had increased muscle thickness by 4.0 and 8.7% after eight weeks (p < 0.05). Hamstring flexibility increased in all exercise groups, except the RE group. Moreover, all six groups showed improved calf flexibility, whereas no changes in stiffness were noted. CONCLUSIONS: Increases in mobility performance, strength, and flexibility appeared due to learning effects and increased physical activity, rather than the specific training impact. However, strength-based programs may be recommended for older adults with suspected sarcopenia, as they provide additional benefits, such as short-lasting muscle hypertrophy."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Pulsed electromagnetic fields (PEMF) and stretching exercises are safe and noninvasive methods that could have a therapeutic effect on tissue healing. This study aimed to assess the effectiveness of these methods in treatment of muscle injury (INJ). METHOD: Rats were divided into 5 groups (Control, INJ, INJ + Exercise, INJ + PEMF, INJ + Exercise + PEMF). At the end of the experiment, genetic, histopathological, and immunohistochemical evaluations were made in the muscle tissue. RESULTS: Mononuclear cell infiltration, muscle degeneration, atrophy, and necrosis were found to be higher in the INJ group than in all groups (p < 0.001). On the 7th day, fibroblast growth factor (FGF) was found to be higher in the INJ group compared to both the control and the INJ + Exercise group (p < 0.05). On the 14th day, Vascular endothelial growth factor values were found to be higher in the injury group than the other groups except for the PEMF group (p < 0.05), and FGF values were higher in the injury group compared to all groups (p < 0.001). The expressions of transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-β1) and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) on the 7th and 14th days showed a significant increase in the INJ group compared to the other groups (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: In this study, it has been shown that PEMF and stretching exercise is effective in the treatment of muscle injuries as they balance the inflammatory process in the muscle, have a positive effect on muscle development, accelerate healing, prevent fibrosis development by reducing TGF-β1 signaling, and inhibit inflammatory-induced eNOS activity.",

      "abstract": "UNLABELLED: Tendon injuries represent a significant challenge to treat owing to their limited intrinsic reparative capacity. The use of mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) offers promising alternative therapeutic option to augments tendon repair. It is hypothesised that the activation of hypoxia inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1α), could facilitate the tendon repair process by promoting the proliferation and tenogenic differentiation of MSCs. To demonstrate this, a study was conducted incorporating the use of Roxadustat, a specific hypoxia mimetic mediator and cyclic uniaxial stretching at a frequency of 1 Hz and 8 % strain on adipose derived-mesenchymal stromal cells (ADMSCs). METHODS: Cellular morphology, proliferation rate, tenogenic protein and gene expression levels from 8 different treatment groups were compared. These groups include untreated ADMSCs (Control), Roxadustat pre-conditioned ADMSCs (ROX), ADMSCs subjected CAY10585 treatment only (CAY), Roxadustat pre-conditioned ADMSCs with CAY10585 inhibition (ROX+CAY), ADMSCs subjected to uniaxial stretching only (S), Roxadustat pre-conditioned ADMSCs with uniaxial stretching (ROX+S), ADMSCs subjected CAY10585 with uniaxial stretching (CAY+S) and primary tenocytes (Tenocytes). RESULTS: ROX+S group exhibited the highest expression of HIF-1α and demonstrated a significant up-regulation of collagen I and III expressions, increasing by 4.9 and 5.6-fold compared to ROX group, respectively. There is a significant increase of SCX, TNC, TNMD, COLI and COLIII expression in this combination treatment group; (SCX= 9.9, TNC= 12.6, TNMD= 7.0, COLI= 8.0 and COLIII= 10.0-fold). Conversely, the expression of the markers markedly reduced with HIF-1α inhibitor CAY10585. However, uniaxial stretching effectively counteracted the inhibitory effects of CAY10585 in the CAY+ S group, resulting in a 3.9-fold increase in SCX expression compared to CAY treatment alone. CONCLUSION: HIF-1α accumulation promotes superior tenogenic differentiation of ADMSCs, suggesting that the combination of Roxadustat and cyclic uniaxial stretching may be a potential therapeutic mediator in tendon repair strategies."

Hence, the aim of this study was to compare varying durations (40-, 80-, and 120-seconds) of antagonist (dorsiflexors) static stretching (SS) on agonist (plantar flexors: PF) muscle performance. In this randomized crossover study, 16 participants (six females) underwent four sessions (40-, 80-, 120-s dorsiflexors SS and control), with pre- and post-intervention measurements of slow (600/s) and fast (2400/s) PF isokinetic, isometric peak torque, total work, stiff leg drop jump (SDJ) performance (height, reactive strength index (RSI) and peak power), and tibialis anterior and soleus electromyography (EMG). Dorsiflexors SS protocol involved 1x40-s (40-s), 2x40-s (80-s), and 3x40-s (120-s). There were no significant pre- to post-intervention changes in any parameter. A main effect for time demonstrated an overall decrease in fast (p < 0.0001, 5.9%, d = 0.24) and slow (p = 0.05, 6.6%, d = 0.24) isokinetic peak torque, total work (p = 0.02, 5.1%, d = 0.20) and all SDJ measures (SDJ height: p = 0.02, 2.7%, d = 0.15, RSI: p < 0.0001, 5.9%, d = 0.23, peak power: p = 0.002, 4.4%, d = 0.22). Soleus EMG decreased from pre- to post-SS after 120-s in both isometric (p = 0.002, 13.6%, d = 0.73) and slow isokinetic (p = 0.002, 12.3%, d = 0.91) peak torque as well as 80-s with slow isokinetic peak torque (p = 0.02, 6.6%, d = 0.75). In summary, different durations of dorsiflexors SS (40-s, 80-s, 120-s) did not significantly influence PF performance. However, deficits associated with a main effect for time suggested possible testing effects as detected with the control condition.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The hamstring muscles play a crucial role in posture and movement, with interventions such as stretching and myofascial release commonly used to improve flexibility and muscle function. Emerging evidence suggests that targeting the hamstrings may influence distant structures like the masseter muscle through myofascial connections, highlighting the need for studies investigating these systemic interactions. AIM: To assess the immediate effects of hamstring stretching alone or combined with myofascial release of the hamstring muscle on masseter muscle activity, pressure pain threshold, active mouth opening, hamstring flexibility, and forward head flexed posture in recreationally active participants. METHODS: Thirty healthy young adults aged 18-25 years participated in this study. They were randomly assigned to two groups: one receiving static hamstring stretching and the other receiving stretching plus myofascial release. Masseter muscle activity was measured using surface electromyography. Pressure pain threshold (PPT), hamstring flexibility (maximum hip flexion and active knee extension), maximum mouth opening (MMO), and forward head posture [tragus-to-wall distance (TWD)] were assessed before and after the interventions. RESULTS: Treatment led to significant improvements in masseter muscle electromyography (EMG) activity (Group I: Right P = 0.001, Left P = 0.002; Group II: Right P < 0.001, Left P = 0.003) and active knee extension in both groups (Groups I and II: Right P < 0.001, Left P < 0.001), reflecting significant enhancements in muscle activity and flexibility. Mild improvements were also noted in masseter PPT (Group I: Right P = 0.037, Left P = 0.042; Group II: Right P = 0.035, Left P = 0.041), although MMO and TWD remained stable, indicating no significant changes posttreatment. Comparative analysis revealed no significant differences between the groups in response to interventions across all measured parameters, demonstrating that both groups experienced similar improvements and confirming the efficacy of the treatments administered. CONCLUSION: The study found that the treatments significantly improved masseter muscle activity and knee extension flexibility, with mild enhancements in pain thresholds. However, there were no significant effects on jaw opening (MMO) or posture (TWD). The lack of significant differences between the groups suggests that both treatment protocolsare equally effective. These findings indicate the potential for incorporating the interventions into clinical practice to improve musculoskeletal function in both the jaw and lower limbs.",

The hypothesis is that the total score of the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ-R) and other fibromyalgia symptoms will improve 6 weeks following the stretching intervention compared with usual care. METHODS: Fifty-eight adults under 65 years of age diagnosed with fibromyalgia will be recruited for this study. Participants will be randomised into an intervention group and a control group (waitlist). Randomisation will be stratified by sex. The intervention group will perform 6 weeks of daily stretching exercises for 6 min-a day. The control group will maintain usual care. A mHealth app will support stretching adherence. The primary outcome will be the total score of the Revised Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ-R). The secondary outcomes include regional and widespread pain sensitivity, range of motion, quality of life (SF-36), mental and physical functioning and adherence. Evaluations will be performed at baseline, following 6 weeks of daily stretches (primary endpoint) and 6 months after the termination of the intervention period (secondary endpoint). DISCUSSION: By investigating the clinical efficacy of a 6-week, novel, home-based stretching programme, we hope to provide applicable and generalisable knowledge about the efficacy of stretching exercises that can potentially help ease the burden of symptoms experienced by patients with fibromyalgia.

We aimed to examine the acute effects of static stretching on handgrip strength and wrist joint flexibility in older women. METHODS: Twenty physically active older women (68 ± 6 years) performed handgrip contractions and wrist joint flexibility assessments before and after a control condition (quiet resting) and an experimental condition of static stretching for 30 s. Peak force and rate of force development variables were obtained from each contraction. Wrist joint range of motion was determined from the flexibility assessments. RESULTS: There were no significant changes in handgrip peak force or rate of force development variables after the stretching treatment (p = .11-.88). There was, however, a significant stretch-induced increase in wrist joint range of motion (p < .01). CONCLUSION: These findings indicate that a 30-s bout of static stretching may be an effective intervention for increasing wrist joint flexibility without decreasing handgrip strength. Significance/Implications: The results of our study may have important implications for creating stretching interventions that can be used as part of a warm-up routine to help attenuate the negative effects of age on range of motion. Such interventions may be beneficial for improving functional performance and reducing the risk of injury in older populations."

      "abstract": "Static stretching immediately affects various neuromusculoskeletal components. Among quadriceps muscles, only the rectus femoris (RF) is stretched by hip extension and knee flexion. The aim of this study was to investigate the motor unit (MU) firing behaviors of two synergistic muscles after selective static stretching on only one side. Fourteen males (23.7 ± 2.4 years) performed knee extension tasks before and after the intervention: static stretching or control conditions. The static stretching protocol consisted of passive hip joint extension and knee joint flexion as selective stretching of the RF for 1 min, repeated for 6 sets, while a 6-min rest was applied as the control condition. MU firings of RF and the vastus lateralis (VL) were detected using high-density surface electromyography, and the MU recruitment threshold and firing rate were calculated during ramp-up contraction to 35% of maximal voluntary contraction. RF stiffness, evaluated by shear wave elastography, was significantly reduced after static stretching, and not VL stiffness (interaction: p = 0.037). There were main effects of time, but no interaction in the MU recruitment threshold of RF (p = 0.282), firing rates of either muscle (RF: p = 0.363, VL: p = 0.557), or maximal strength (p = 0.362), suggesting that these variables were changed after both conditions. However, an interaction was noted in the recruitment threshold of VL (p = 0.018), indicating that the decline in recruitment threshold of VL was greater in the static stretching (from 24.9 ± 6.3 to 21.7 ± 6.1 %MVC) than in the control condition (from 24.4 ± 6.7 to 22.3 ± 6.1 %MVC). These findings suggest that reducing muscle stiffness by static stretching in one muscle can enhance MU recruitment in the other synergist while the change was slightly small.",

We tested the hypothesis that executive function and attention would improve more after eccentric resistance exercise (ECC) than stretching exercise (STRETCH) training. Healthy older women (65-75 years) underwent either ECC (n = 14) or STRETCH (n = 14) intervention for 8 weeks. ECC consisted of seven exercises emphasizing eccentric contractions while STRETCH performed 12 stretching exercises, with supervised sessions undertaken twice weekly accompanied by a home-based program. Executive function and attention were assessed using the Stroop test of color naming (STCN) and conflicting color words, symbol digit modalities test, digit span test (DST), and trail making tests (TMT-A and TMT-B), and six physical function tests were undertaken before and after the 8-week training period. Fasting blood samples were obtained before and after the training. A significant (p < 0.05) group × time interaction effect was evident for STCN, DST, and TMT-A, with only ECC showing improvements (DST:14.7 ± 27% and TMT-A:10.2 ± 12%) from pre- to post-training. No significant changes in other cognitive function tests were found for either group. All physical function tests except one-leg balance test showed greater improvement (p < 0.05) for ECC than STRETCH. No significant changes in blood lipid profile and brain-derived neurotrophic factor were found, but serum glucose concentration and glycosylated hemoglobin decreased (p < 0.05) in ECC. These results suggest that a short-term body-weight eccentric exercise intervention was effective in enhancing components of cognitive and physical function of older women and may prove a useful strategy in combating age-related decline in cognitive and physical function.",

Both groups performed 3 sets of lunge exercises 5 times per week for 4 weeks. Each set comprised 10 repetitions. Static and dynamic balance, gait parameters, and the DGI were measured after 4 weeks of training. RESULTS: After 4 weeks of training, the foot intrinsic muscle dynamic stretching group showed significant improvement in all outcome measures compared with the baseline (P < .05). Furthermore, timed up and go, velocity, step length, stride length, and DGI showed greater improvement in the foot intrinsic muscle dynamic stretching group than in the standard lunge exercise group (P < .05).

The hmwPLLA ENCY generated from a concentration of 10% (w v-1) is demonstrated with uniform morphology with an average fiber diameter of 737.7 ± 72.2 nm and an average yarn diameter of 454.9 ± 3.5 µm. Compared with the unstretched hmwPLLA ENCY, increasing the hot-stretching temperature can significantly enhance the fiber orientation and crystallinity. Moreover, the mechanical properties of stretched ENCYs are obviously enhanced compared with the unstretched control. The fiber orientation and crystallinity of stretched ENCYs are also found to be significantly improved with the increase of hot stretching rate, further resulting in the obvious increase of breaking strength and Young's modulus. Importantly, the braided textiles made from stretched hmwPLLA ENCYs exhibited great biocompatibility by effectively guiding the cell alignment and supporting the cell adhesion and proliferation. In summary, the high performance hmwPLLA ENCYs show great potential for the future design and development of advanced biomedical textiles."

      "abstract": "Background/Objective: Maintaining sufficient ankle joint range of motion (ROM) contributes to efficient movement in sports and daily activities. Static stretching (SS), while effective, demands significant time, highlighting the need for alternative, time-efficient approaches to improve ROM. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of combined intervention (CI) using neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) and elastic tape versus SS. Methods: This randomized crossover trial was conducted in healthy university students. They underwent both interventions with a 1-week washout period. The CI entailed the application of elastic tape to the plantar surface of the foot coupled with NMES targeting the posterior lower leg muscles for 1 min. SS was administered for 5 min using a tilt table. Outcome measures included the dorsiflexion angle (DFA), finger-floor distance (FFD), straight leg raise (SLR) angle, plantar flexor strength (PFS), and knee flexor strength (KFS), assessed pre- and post-intervention. DFA was analyzed using equivalence testing with a predefined margin. Results: Both interventions yielded significant improvements in DFA, FFD, and SLR. The combination of NMES and elastic tape demonstrated equivalence to 5 min of SS in enhancing DFA. Neither intervention resulted in a significant reduction in PFS or KFS. Conclusions: The CI of NMES and elastic tape effectively and safely improves flexibility in a short time. Its time efficiency makes it a promising alternative to SS, especially for brief warm-ups or limited rehabilitation time. Further research should explore its long-term effects and broader applicability."

OBJECTIVE: This study compared the effects of percussion massage therapy (PMT), kinesiology tape (KT), and dynamic stretching (DS) on shoulder strength, proprioception, and functionality. METHODS: The KT group had kinesiology tape applied to the deltoid muscles. The DS group performed dynamic stretching in flexion and abduction. The PMT group received percussion massage on the deltoid muscles. Assessments included the Becure system for joint position sense (JPS), the Timed Functional Arm and Shoulder Test (TFAST), and a hand-held dynamometer for muscle strength. RESULTS: Significant improvements were observed in almost all JPS parameters for all groups (p < 0.05). Total TFAST scores improved in all groups. Muscle strength significantly improved in the DS group (p < 0.05), while PMT and KT groups showed no significant change (p > 0.05). Statistically significant differences were found between the groups (p < 0.05). JPS 30°, 60°, and 90° flexion parameters had effect sizes of 0.51, 0.64, and 0.49, respectively; JPS 30°, 60°, and 90° abduction parameters had effect sizes of 0.38, 0.46, and 0.45, respectively. The effect size for Total TFAST was 0.55, flexion muscle strength 0.59, and abduction muscle strength 0.68. DS was more effective for muscle strength, DS and PMT for functionality, and KT and PMT for proprioception (p < 0.017). CONCLUSIONS: PMT and KT were more effective for proprioception, PMT and DS were more effective for functionality, and DS was most efficient in enhancing muscle strength."

The present study was conducted to compare effects of breathing exercises alone and combined with breathing-stretching exercises on respiratory indices, disease severity and exercise capacity in COPD. This randomized clinical trial was conducted at Jahrom University of Medical Sciences in May-July, 2024. The research population included 32 COPD patients who were randomly divided into control (routine breathing exercises) and intervention (combined routine breathing and breathing-stretching exercises) groups using convenience sampling method. Training was performed twice a day for five days. The used tools included COPD assessment test, 6-Minute Walk Test, venous blood gas and pulse oximeter. The data were analyzed using SPSS 25.0 and Shapiro-wilk test, Chi-square test, independent t-test and paired t-test. The results showed a statistically difference in the mean PCO2, O2sat, severity and 6MWT scores before and after the intervention in both groups (P-value < 0.05). Pco2 and severity reduction and O2sat and 6MWT increased in intervention group was more significant related to control group. Combined routine breathing and breathing-stretching exercises, compared to improved COPD patients' respiratory indices, reduced disease severity and increased exercise capacity, more than using breathing exercises alone.

Currently, it is unknown if the order an individual performs FR and SS influences flexibility or whether flexibility is retained. This study aimed to determine if FR before, or, following SS influences passive hip flexion range of motion (ROM), and if changes are retained. DESIGN: Between-group experimental design. METHODS: Thirty-five participants with less than 90° of passive hip flexion ROM volunteered. Over 8 days, 6 days separated by 24 hours, and then 1 week (day 7) and 2 weeks (day 8) following the last treatment, ROM was measured before and following 1 of 5 treatments; FR/SS, SS/FR, SS, FR, or nothing (control). Participants laid supine on a table where a bubble inclinometer was placed on the tibia of the dominant leg with the hip passively flexed to establish pretreatment ROM. Participants then received the treatments. Passive hip flexion ROM was assessed from pretreatment on day 1 to posttreatment on day 6, day 7 (1 wk), and day 8 (2 wk). RESULTS: Passive hip flexion ROM increased for those receiving FR/SS, SS/FR, FR, and SS. ROM with FR and SS/FR was retained at day 7 but not day 8. Hip flexion ROM for FR/SS and SS were not retained at day 7 nor 8. SS/FR resulted in greater ROM than FR on day 6. SS/FR, FR/SS, SS, and FR were greater than the control at day 6. SS/FR was also greater than the control on days 7 and 8. CONCLUSION: This study revealed that FR the hamstring muscles after SS produces the greatest gains in passive hip flexion and would be appropriate in noninjured patients with less than 90°."

Delayed gastric emptying (DGE) is one of the most common complications following ppPD. In a retrospective analysis, intraoperative endoluminal pyloromyotomy (PM) was shown to be associated with a reduction in DGE rates. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this randomized controlled trial was to investigate the effect of intraoperative endoluminal PM on DGE after ppPD. METHODS: Patients undergoing ppPD were randomized intraoperatively to receive either PM or atraumatic stretching of the pylorus prior to creation of the duodenojejunostomy. The primary endpoint was the rate of DGE within 30 days after surgery. RESULTS: Sixty-four patients were randomly assigned to the PM group and 64 patients were assigned to the control group. There were no differences between the two groups regarding baseline characteristics. The DGE rate was 59.4% (76/126). In two patients (1.6%) DGE was not assessable. The most common DGE grade was A (51/126, 40.5%), followed by B (20/126, 15.9%) and C (5/126, 4.0%). The rate of DGE was 62.5% in the PM group versus 56.3% in the control group (odds ratio 1.41, 95% confidence interval 0.69-2.90; p = 0.34). The complication rate did not differ between both groups (p = 0.79) and there were no differences in quality of life on postoperative day 30. CONCLUSIONS: Intraoperative endoluminal PM did not reduce the rate or severity of DGE after ppPD compared with atraumatic stretching of the pylorus."

      "abstract": "Current pharmaceutical interventions for chronic pain are reported to be minimally effective, leading researchers to investigate non-pharmaceutical avenues for chronic pain treatment. One such avenue is resizing illusions delivered using augmented reality. These illusions resize the affected body part through stretching or shrinking manipulations and have been shown to give analgesic effects; however, the neural underpinnings of these illusions remain undefined. Steady-state evoked potentials (SSEPs) have been studied within populations without chronic pain undergoing hand-based resizing illusions, finding no convincing differences in SSEP amplitudes during illusory stretching. Here, we present comparable findings from a sample with chronic pain, who are thought to have blurred cortical representations of painful body parts, but again find no clear differences in SSEP amplitude during illusory stretching. However, no significant decreases in pain ratings were found following illusory resizing, and changes in SSEP amplitudes are thought to possibly reflect experiences of illusory analgesia. Despite a lack of illusory analgesia across the sample, several participants experienced clinically meaningful levels of pain reduction following illusory resizing, highlighting the potential of resizing illusions as an analgesia treatment avenue. Subjective illusory experience data showed significantly greater experiences of the illusion in the multisensory (visuotactile) condition compared to non-illusion conditions and a unimodal visual condition, replicating findings from participants without chronic hand-based pain. Exploratory analyses using subjective disownership data show that the multisensory condition did not elicit significant disownership experiences, demonstrating that the pain reductions seen in the multisensory condition do not arise from disownership of the limb, but more likely as a direct result of the illusory resizing manipulations.",

This study aimed to compare the diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) parameters of the quadriceps before and after stretching and to investigate correlations between the magnitudes of changes and IntraMAT ratios. METHODS: Twenty young males were included. Single axial DTI and T1-weighted imaging of the right mid-thigh region were conducted before and after rest and stretching. Individual quadriceps were segmented, λ1-3 and fractional anisotropy (FA) were measured using DTI, and the IntraMAT ratios were measured using T1-weighted imaging. To test an intervention-by-time interaction effect, two-way repeated-measures analysis of variance was conducted. The correlation coefficients between the changing λ1-3 and FA magnitude by stretching and the IntaMAT ratio were assessed. RESULTS: There was a significant interventions-by-time interaction effect in the λ1-3 and FA in the vastus medialis (VM). After stretching, in the VM, the λ1-3 values significantly decreased (mean difference, 0.07 mm2∙s-1∙10-3 for λ1-3), and the FA significantly increased (mean difference, 0.021). Furthermore, the decreasing λ2 and λ3 in the VM were significantly inversely correlated with the IntraMAT ratio (r = - 0.50 for both), and the increasing FA magnitude was significantly positively correlated with the IntraMAT ratio (r = 0.45). CONCLUSION: Stretching the quadriceps acutely decreased λ1-3 and increased FA in the VM, and the magnitude of the λ2, λ3, and FA changes were correlated with the IntraMAT ratio. Stretching the quadriceps could improve VM function, particularly in overweight and obese people."

This experimental, parallel group design study investigated the acute effects of PNF stretching on rectus femoris muscle stiffness and explored a potential dose-response relationship. METHODS: Thirty healthy young adults (23 females, 7 males) were randomly assigned to either a PNF stretching group (n = 15; 22.96 ± 2.2 years) or a control group (n = 15; 23.3 ± 2.1 years). Rectus femoris stiffness was measured using shear-wave elastography (Resona 7, Mindray, China) at two locations (distal and proximal) before and after the second, fourth, and sixth sets of PNF stretching. The protocol involved six sets, each with three 10-s stretches and 5-s maximal contractions. RESULTS: The results indicate that PNF stretching had no statistically significant effect on muscle stiffness, with no main effects of group (F = 0.05; p = 0.830) or time (F = 0.545; p = 0.653), and no significant interactions. However, the proximal location showed a substantially higher shear modulus compared to the distal location (F = 63.6; p < 0.001; η2 = 0.69), independent of group or time. DISCUSSION: These findings highlight a location-specific difference in muscle stiffness that was unaffected by the intervention. In conclusion, PNF stretching did not acutely reduce rectus femoris stiffness compared to passive rest, regardless of the number of stretching sets performed. Further research is needed to understand the muscle-specific effects of PNF stretching."

      "abstract": "Background/Objectives: The aim of this study was to examine the acute effects of foam rolling and traditional stretch treatments on physical performance and self-perceived fatigue in youth football players. Methods: The sample of participants consisted of 20 youth football players from the Serbia Under-17 league. Participants were randomly assigned to one of two groups, the Foam group (age: 16.6 ± 1.5 years) or the Stretch group (age: 16.9 ± 1.0 years), with each group consisting of 10 participants. The first measurement (I) was conducted before the match; then, the football players played the match, which was followed by the second measurement (II), and afterward, the groups performed their foam and stretch activities. The third measurement (III) was conducted 2 h after the recovery interventions, and the fourth measurement (IV) was conducted 24 h after the match. Players were tested for the following: linear sprints at 5 m, 10 m, and 20 m, squat jumps (SJs), countermovement jumps (CMJs), and arm-driven countermovement jumps (ACMJs). Participants also completed self-assessment questionnaires on fatigue (Hooper scales) and perceived exertion (Borg scales). Results: A 2 × 4 split-plot ANOVA revealed that there were no differences between the foam rolling and stretching treatments in any parameter of physical performance or self-perceived fatigue. However, a separate within-group analysis showed that the Foam group achieved significantly better sprint times in the third and fourth measurements (2 and 24 h post-match, respectively) compared to measurements taken immediately after the football match. Regarding self-perceived parameters, foam rolling reduced fatigue and stress at 2 and 24 h post-match. On the other hand, the stretching treatment only affected the stress parameter, which was reduced 24 h after the football match. Conclusions: These findings indicate that although there were no significant differences between treatments, foam rolling demonstrated certain advantages compared to stretching. Specifically, foam rolling may offer benefits in enhancing subjective recovery and reducing perceived exertion in young football players. However, these conclusions should be interpreted with caution, as the study was cross-sectional and involved a small sample of young football players."

Methods: Passive stretching with (ST+V) and without (ST) vibration (20 Hz) was performed in male Olympic youth skiing athletes (n = 8, age: 17.9 ± 1.0 years) using a single-blinded randomized cross-over design. Acute hip abduction, hip anteversion, knee extension, and hamstrings (stand and reach straight leg raise) range of motion (ROM) were assessed using a digital goniometer, while stiffness was examined via MyotonPRO. The skin temperature of the whole leg was captured with infrared thermography and analyzed in different segments. Results: Both stretching interventions increased ROM compared to the control group (CG) (p < 0.001-0.033, d = 1.0-1.6) without differences between ST+V and ST (p = 0.202-0.999). While skin temperature decreased in the CG and ST, ST+V maintained a constant temperature in the lower legs. Stiffness was not affected by both stretching interventions. Conclusions: The stretching intervention leads to significant increases in flexibility, while additional vibration did not further enhance the ROM."

A case-study was conducted on a competitive bodybuilder implementing long-duration, high-intensity stretching of the plantar flexors (60 min 6x/week for 12 weeks) in conjunction with their habitual RT. Ultrasound muscle architecture (muscle thickness [MT], fascicle length [FL], and pennation angle [PA]) measurements were collected at multiple sites at four weekly baseline sessions, six (mid) and 12 (post1) weeks following the commencement of the intervention, and a week after the intervention (post2) while isometric strength and range of motion (RoM) were obtained once at baseline, mid, post1, and post2. 2SD band plots were constructed to determine meaningful changes in MT, FL, and PA from the four baseline measures while percentage and absolute change across each timepoint were calculated for all variables. From baseline to post 1, RoM, strength, and MT increased 25.9%, 11.4%, and 7.4%-23.4%, respectively, while four MT and two PA sites exceeded the threshold for meaningful change. The combined stretching and RT protocols resulted in flexibility, strength, and MT adaptations; however, findings should be generalized with caution given the case-study nature of our investigation.",

To better understand the issues associated with existing associated rehabilitation devices, customer discovery conversations were conducted with 153 people in the healthcare ecosystem (60 patients, 30 caregivers, and 63 medical providers). These patients fell into two populations: spastic (stiff, clenched hands) and flaccid (limp hands). Focusing on the first category, a set of design constraints was developed based on the information collected from the customer discovery. With these constraints in mind, a powered wrist-hand stretching orthosis (exoskeleton) was designed and prototyped as a preclinical study (T0 basic science research) to aid in recovery. The orthosis was tested on two patients for proof-of-concept, one survivor of stroke and one of traumatic brain injury. The prototype was able to consistently open both patients' hands. A mathematical model was developed to characterize joint stiffness based on experimental testing. Donning and doffing times for the prototype averaged 76 and 12.5 s, respectively, for each subject unassisted. This compared favorably to times shown in the literature. This device benefits from simple construction and low-cost materials and is envisioned to become a therapy device accessible to patients in the home. This work lays the foundation for phase 1 clinical trials and further device development."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Due to the poor skin mobility of the heel, there are few reports on the efficacy and safety of skin-stretching devices in the treatment of soft-tissue defects of the heel. Redesigning the claws of the stretching devices may be one of the solutions to the problem. This study was designed to investigate the clinical effect of self-modified skin-stretching device in the treatment of soft-tissue defects in the heel. METHODS: From December 2017 to March 2022, 23 patients with heel soft-tissue defects were enrolled. There were 15 males and 8 females, with a mean age of 50 years (range, 28-73 years). Defect size, time of wound closure, duration of stretching time, and complications were documented. The American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) Ankle-Hindfoot score was used to evaluate functional outcomes, and pain was assessed by the visual analog scale (VAS) at the last follow-up. Statistical analysis was performed using t-tests and Mann-Whitney U test. RESULTS: The mean follow-up time was 14.2 months. Primary wound closure was performed in 6 patients and delayed wound closure in 17 patients. The average time of wound closure was 14.3 days, and the average duration of stretching time was 23.5 days. Complications were observed in 9 patients. Finally, all wounds were healed. At the last follow-up, the average AOFAS score was 86.7, with 9 excellent, 13 good, and 1 fair results. The mean VAS score was 2.6. CONCLUSIONS: Self-modified skin-stretching device is another option for treating heel soft-tissue defects. The technique can achieve good appearance and function with a low price and easy to install.",

      "abstract": "Hydrogen sulfide (H2S), one of the three gas signaling molecules, not only plays a vital role in mediating a series of cellular activities but also manifests exciting applications in clinical therapy. However, one main obstacle in using H2S as a gaseous therapeutic agent is to realize on-demand storage and delivery of gas, and thus, it is of great importance to develop H2S-donating vehicle platforms. Although a variety of polymer-based gas-releasing carriers have been designed, almost all the systems are limited to spherical structures. Here we explore the role of polymer self-assembled morphologies, especially toward those non-spherical nanostructures, on the H2S release capacity. A kind of tubular polymersomes (i.e. tubesomes), formed by the membrane stretching of polythionoester-containing block copolymer vesicles, exhibit enhanced cysteine-responsive H2S-releasing behavior in contrast to their spherical counterparts. Moreover, we found that the amount and rate of H2S release from diverse polymersomes is relied on the extent of membrane elongation, which allows us to regulate the gas releasing kinetics through tailoring the membrane geometries. More importantly, it is demonstrated that the tubesomes as polymer-type H2S donors have better anticancer performance than those spherical polymersomes. This would inspire new possibilities to boost gas therapeutic efficacy through shaping the morphology of gas nanovehicles.",

Despite the growing interest, most available cell-stretching devices are not compatible with automated live-cell imaging, indispensable for characterizing alterations in the dynamics of various important cellular processes. In this work, StretchView is presented, a multi-axial cell-stretching platform compatible with automated, time-resolved live-cell imaging. Using StretchView, long-term image acquisition of cells in the relaxed and stretched states is shown for the first time (experimental time of 12 h) without the need for human intervention. Homogeneous and stable strain fields are demonstrated for 18 h of cyclic stretching, highlighting the platform's versatility and robustness. As proof-of-principle, the effect of stretching on cell kinematics and spatiotemporal localization of the cell-cell adhesion protein E-cadherin is examined for MDCK cells in monolayer. First evidence of a monotonic increase in junctional E-cadherin localization upon exposure to stretch is presented using live-cell imaging data acquired during cyclic stretching, suggestive of an increase in barrier integrity of the monolayer. These findings highlight the potential of StretchView in providing insights into cell mechanobiology and beyond.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Subacromial impingement syndrome (SIS) is a common cause of shoulder pain and dysfunction. Modified posterior shoulder stretching exercises have been proposed as a treatment method aimed at improving shoulder function and reducing pain in patients with SIS. However, the efficacy of these exercises remains controversial, necessitating a systematic meta-analysis to comprehensively evaluate their effectiveness. METHODS: A systematic search was conducted across PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase, and Web of Science databases to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies evaluating the efficacy of modified posterior shoulder stretching exercises in patients with SIS. Inclusion criteria required that participants be diagnosed with SIS, the intervention be modified posterior shoulder stretching exercises, and key outcomes such as shoulder function improvement and pain relief be reported. Meta-analysis was performed using RevMan 5.3 software, calculating standardized mean differences (SMD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI), and heterogeneity and bias risk were assessed. RESULTS: A total of 10 RCTs with 628 patients were included. The modified posterior shoulder stretching exercises demonstrated significant effects in reducing pain at rest (SMD = -1.00, 95% CI: -1.85 to -0.15, P = .02) and during activity (SMD = -1.45, 95% CI: -2.49 to -0.41, P = .006). Additionally, the exercises showed positive effects in improving internal rotation (SMD = 0.49, 95% CI: 0.22-0.75, P = .0003) and external rotation range of motion (SMD = 0.29, 95% CI: 0.00-0.58, P = .05), as well as enhancing shoulder function (CMS score: SMD = 0.95, 95% CI: 0.64-1.25, P < .00001) and reducing disability (quick DASH score: SMD = -0.85, 95% CI: -1.12 to -0.58, P < .00001). Sensitivity analysis indicated high robustness of the results, and Egger test did not reveal significant publication bias (P > .05). CONCLUSION: Modified posterior shoulder stretching exercises are significantly effective in improving shoulder function and reducing pain in patients with SIS, with the study results showing high robustness and low risk of bias. However, further high-quality research is needed to validate these findings.",

      "abstract": "Over the past 20-30 years, numerous studies have expanded our understanding of the connective components within the human musculoskeletal system. The term \"fascia\" and, more specifically, the \"fascial system\" encompass a variety of connective tissues that perform multiple functions. Given the extensive scope of the topic of fascia and the fascial system, which cannot be fully addressed in a single article, this work will focus specifically on the role of fascia in tension transmission (mechanotransduction). This includes both the tensions generated by the contractile muscular component and the elastic recoil, which contribute to movement and posture in the human body. A functional alteration of the fascia, due to the high density of receptors within it, can trigger pain symptoms identified as myofascial pain; this typically manifests at so-called myofascial trigger points (MTrPs). This article presents a new hypothesis on how MTrPs may develop as a result of imbalanced tension loading on the fascial components arranged in series and parallel to the contractile muscular component. While the literature contains several studies on the manual manipulation of fascia, limited evidence is available regarding the treatment of fascial dysfunctions through alternative modalities, such as therapeutic exercises aimed at lengthening or shortening these structures. This work is divided into two parts: the first section provides an overview of the composition of fascia used for the transmission of tension forces and introduces the basis of the approach, using stretching techniques, to address dysfunctions related to excessive rigidity in the myofascial system. Additionally, a mechanical physiological basis is proposed for the various stretching methods described in the literature. The second part addresses the treatment of dysfunctions related to reduced rigidity in the fascial system through therapeutic exercise. The fascial training recommendations provided in this article are aimed at preventing and treating musculoskeletal disorders. They should be integrated with muscle-strengthening work, cardiovascular training, and coordination exercises. Developing a fascial network in the body that is both flexible and resistant to injury involves applying recent discoveries from the rapidly advancing field of fascia research into effective training programs. This paper aims to motivate physiotherapists, osteopaths, sports trainers, and other movement instructors to integrate these principles and adapt them within their professional practices."

Aerobic exercise has been shown to be primarily effective for glycemic control and gait disturbance owing to PAD. However, the safety and efficacy of exercise therapy in patients with PDR remain unclear. The purpose of this case report was to demonstrate the short-term effects of static stretching (SS) and daily walking over 10,000 steps on patients with T2DM presenting with PDR and PAD. The intervention consisted of 40 minutes of other-movement SS and in-hospital walking during a two-week hospitalization phase and 20-30 minutes of automatic SS and outdoor walking during a two-week home phase post-discharge. The walking conditions consisted of 10,000 steps/day, and the rate of perceived exertion was 11-12 on the Borg scale. Outcomes included the presence of a new intraocular hemorrhage and changes in intraocular pressure (IOP), blood pressure, fasting blood glucose level, biochemical parameters, cardio-ankle vascular index (CAVI), and ankle-brachial index. No new intraocular hemorrhage or increased IOP was observed during the intervention period, and blood pressure, glycemic control, and CAVI parameters improved. The results of the intervention in this case suggest that the combination of SS and walking exercises may be safe and effective."

      "abstract": "Stretching is a ubiquitous rehabilitation intervention for individuals with spinal cord injury (SCI), intended to reduce spasticity, maintain or improve joint range of motion, and prevent joint contractures. Although people with SCI report that stretching is their preferred approach to reduce spasticity, limited evidence supports the use of stretching for people with SCI, including short-term (< one hour) effects on spasticity. Further, the long-term effects and the effects of stretching on motor function have yet to be examined in humans with SCI. Evidence from pre-clinical studies in rats with SCI demonstrates that stretching impairs motor output, reduces spinal cord excitability, and abolishes walking function. This perspective paper discusses evidence of static stretching in humans and rats with SCI regarding the effects on range of motion, joint contractures, and effects on voluntary and involuntary (i.e., spasticity) motor output. Additionally, we aim to challenge assumptions regarding the use of stretching and encourage research to advance the understanding of this common rehabilitation approach. Research is needed to investigate underlying mechanisms of stretch-induced effects and to advance stretching protocols to optimize the potential beneficial effects of stretching for people with SCI."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: To investigate the acute (directly poststretching) and long-term (≥1 week of treatment) effects of stretching type, duration, and intensity on joint range of motion (ROM) and stiffness in ankle contractures. DATA SOURCES: PubMed, Embase.com, Clarivate Analytics/Web of Science Core Collection, EBSCO/SPORTDiscus, and EBSCO/CINAHL were searched for studies published in English from inception until September 12, 2023. STUDY SELECTION: Fifty-five studies that met the inclusion criteria were included, covering observational, controlled and noncontrolled studies. DATA EXTRACTION: Pre- and post-treatment ankle ROM and stiffness, and stretching duration, intensity, and type were extracted from each eligible treatment group by 1 reviewer. DATA SYNTHESIS: Most studies did not quantify stretching intensity and its effect was not tested. For the acute effects on ROM, 15 effect sizes were obtained from 11 studies. ROM increased more after constant-torque (95% confidence interval [CI] [1.35, 2.15]) than after constant-angle (95% CI [0.44, 1.40] or dynamic stretching (95% CI [0.50, 1.01]), F=11.99, P=.004, I2=0%, and increased with duration (95% CI [0.00, 0.05]), F=5.12, P=.011, I2=55%. Acute effects on joint stiffness could not be assessed. For the long-term effects, 54 and 12 effect sizes were estimated from 44 and 10 studies, for ROM and stiffness, respectively. No effect of stretching duration on either outcome was found (F=0.32, P=.57, I2=78% and F=0.74, P=.409, I2=5%, respectively). No effect of stretching type on stiffness was found (F=0.02, P=.888, I2=0%). Not enough information was available to assess the long-term effects of stretch type. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that constant-torque stretching acutely increases ROM more than constant-angle and dynamic stretching. To assess if these superior acute effects result in more substantial adaptations over time, future long-term studies should define stretching type more clearly. Also, torque and angle during stretching should be recorded as measures of intensity in future studies."

Foam roller with and without vibration as a warm-up intervention may have benefits for healthy populations, but the effect on applied to injured individuals is still lacking, especially in CAI. Therefore, we aimed to compare the acute effects of three warm-up interventions, including vibration foam rolling (VR), foam rolling (FR), and static stretching (SS) in adults with CAI. METHODS: This study was a randomized, counterbalanced crossover trial. Eligible sixteen adults with CAI received all three interventions (VR, FR, and SS) in unilateral CAI leg in a randomized order. Each intervention included 6 sets, 30 s each, targeting the ankle dorsiflexors and plantarflexors, with a 30-s rest time in between. Ankle dorsiflexion range of motion (DFROM), muscle strength, and ankle proprioception were measured before and immediately after each intervention. RESULTS: VR significantly improved ankle DFROM and muscle strength by over 30% compared to the pre-intervention, whereas FR improved DFROM by 23.68%, and SS did not improve DFROM. Additionally, VR was more significantly effective than SS in improving ankle DFROM and maximal strength. The ankle joint repositioning error angle did not have significantly different. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that VR and FR interventions may be incorporated into warm-ups for adults with CAI to improve ankle DFROM. Furthermore, VR offers additional benefits in increasing muscle strength, especially compared to SS.",

Still, only a few previous studies have evaluated the chronic effects of an SS intervention program in older adults, and the potential relationship between ROM changes and muscle stiffness changes is still unclear. This study aimed to investigate the effects of a 10- week SS intervention partially supervised program on joint range of motion (ROM) and tissue hardness in older adults. METHODS: The SS intervention program was conducted at least three times a week for 10 weeks in the ankle plantar flexor muscles of 24 community-dwelling older adults (73.8 ± 5.1 years; height: 156.0 ± 6.8 cm; body mass: 52.7 ± 8.0 kg). The SS intervention program consisted of 4 × 30-s repetitions. Ankle joint dorsiflexion (DF) ROM and tissue hardness of the medial gastrocnemius were measured before and after the 10-week SS intervention program. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The results showed that the 10-week SS intervention program significantly increased DF ROM (+9°, p < 0.01, Cohen's d = 1.37) and decreased tissue hardness (-0.9, p = 0.04, Cohen's d = -0.27). However, there was no significant correlation between these changes (r = 0.086, p = 0.561). The results of this study suggest that a 10-week SS intervention program can effectively increase DF ROM and decrease tissue hardness but that the increase in DF ROM is related to stretch tolerance rather than changes in tissue hardness."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: This study aimed to compare and examine the local and non-local effects of a foam rolling (FR) and static stretching (SS) intervention applied to the plantar flexor (PF). METHODS: Fourteen female participants were investigated. Each participant underwent three conditions in a random order at least 48h apart and at the same time of the day: Control (CC), SS, and FR. Each condition was performed unilaterally in the dominant PF for 4 sets (apart from CC). SS was performed for 30 s. The FR included 30 rolls (15 in each direction) over a period of 30 s. A rest of 30 s was provided between each set for all conditions. Outcome variables were ankle dorsiflexion range of movement (ROM), tissue hardness, localized bioimpedance analysis at 50 kHz (L-BIA), and pain pressure thresholds (PPT). Tissue hardness, L-BIA, and PPT were measured in the lower leg and thigh. Measures were assessed pre (T0), immediately post (T1), and 10-min after (T2) the intervention. RESULTS: No differences were found for time for the CC or between the T0 of each condition. Concerning the lower leg, ROM improved for SS and FR from T0 to T1 while returning to baseline in T2. A significant increase in PPT was observed only for SS in T1. L-BIA showed a significant increase for both phase angle and impedance only for FR in T1. Tissue hardness did not change for any group at any time-point. Concerning the thigh, no measure at any time point showed significant differences. CONCLUSION: Both, FR and SS were able to acutely improve ankle ROM. The observed changes were probably caused by a change in viscoelastic properties and local pain perception, without any variation in tissue morphology. FR was the only intervention to improve the intracellular-to-extracellular ratio and decrease fluids. Non-local effects were not observed."

      "abstract": "CONTEXT: Stretching and strengthening for rheumatoid arthritis of the hand (SARAH) is a progressive and individually designed recommended treatment exercise program. AIMS: The aim was to translate the SARAH hand exercise program into Gujarati and assess the adherence rate, usefulness, and understanding of the Gujarati SARAH exercise program. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Mixed-method qualitative study was conducted among 25 participants at the outpatient departments of Institute Nadiad and Niruj Rheumatology Clinic, Gujarat, and via professional contact, a telephonic semi-structured interview was conducted among 13 participants using an interview guide, and interviews were audio-recorded following transcription verbatim. Overall adherence rates of 25 participants to a 12-week exercise program were determined using the cross-sectional method. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS USED: IBM SPSS software version 23.0 was used for analyzing quantitative data, and NVivo Plus version 11 was used for qualitative data. RESULTS: The adherence rate was 97.22%. Participants completed all 72 sessions (n = 7) with an adherence rate of 100%. The least number of sessions completed was 25 (n = 2), with an adherence rate of 34% due to a lack of interest in exercising on a daily basis. Qualitative findings showed that the booklet is understandable, useful, and beneficial in terms of reducing symptoms and improving activities of daily life as well as occupational work. CONCLUSION: The translated strengthening and stretching for rheumatoid arthritis in the hand exercise booklet is effective and beneficial to patients who exercise at home. Participants can self-track their exercise by using dairy, which eliminates travel costs and attendance at clinic sessions."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Static stretching is widely used to increase flexibility. However, there is no consensus regarding the optimal dosage parameters for increasing flexibility. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to determine the optimal frequency, intensity and volume to maximise flexibility through static stretching, and to investigate whether this is moderated by muscle group, age, sex, training status and baseline level of flexibility. METHODS: Seven databases (CINAHL Complete, Cochrane CENTRAL, Embase, Emcare, MEDLINE, Scopus, and SPORTDiscus) were systematically searched up to June 2024. Randomised and non-randomised controlled trials investigating the effects of a single session (acute) or multiple sessions (chronic) of static stretching on one or more flexibility outcomes (compared to non-stretching passive controls) among adults (aged ≥ 18 years) were included. A multi-level meta-analysis examined the effect of acute and chronic static stretching on flexibility outcomes, while multivariate meta-regression was used to determine the volume at which increases in flexibility were maximised. RESULTS: Data from 189 studies representing 6654 adults (61% male; mean [standard deviation] age = 26.8 ± 11.4 years) were included. We found a moderate positive effect of acute static stretching on flexibility (summary Hedges' g = 0.63, 95% confidence interval 0.52-0.75, p < 0.001) and a large positive effect of chronic static stretching on flexibility (summary Hedges' g = 0.96, 95% confidence interval 0.84-1.09, p < 0.001). Neither effect was moderated by stretching intensity, age, sex or training status, or weekly session frequency and intervention length (chronic static stretching only) [p > 0.05]. However, larger improvements were found for adults with poor baseline flexibility compared with adults with average baseline flexibility (p = 0.01). Furthermore, larger improvements in flexibility were found in the hamstrings compared with the spine following acute static stretching (p = 0.04). Improvements in flexibility were maximised by a cumulative stretching volume of 4 min per session (acute) and 10 min per week (chronic). CONCLUSIONS: Static stretching improves flexibility in adults, with no additional benefit observed beyond 4 min per session or 10 min per week. Although intensity, frequency, age, sex and training status do not influence improvements in flexibility, lower flexibility levels are associated with greater improvement following both acute and chronic static stretching. These guidelines for static stretching can be used by coaches and therapists to improve flexibility. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: PROSPERO CRD42023420168.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Different treatments have been proposed for patients with deep gluteal syndrome (DGS). Stretching and compression exercises are commonly used to treat DGS. OBJECTIVE: To compare the effects of compression or stretching exercises on the flexion-relaxation response (electromyography signals of back muscles) in patients with DGS. METHODS: In this clinical trial with parallel groups, forty-five eligible patients were randomly allocated into three groups; compression exercise (ICE) (n = 15), stretching exercise (ISE) (n = 15) and control group (n = 15). All treatment groups (control, ICE and ISE) underwent 10 sessions of physiotherapy treatment at a frequency of three per week. The flexion-relaxation ratio (FRR) for back muscles was investigated as the primary outcome measure. RESULTS: No significant differences were detected in FRR of back muscles at the end of the study between three study groups (all p > 0.05). In all groups after interventions, no significant changes in FRR compared to the baseline values were observed (within changes were not significant; all p > 0.05). The pairwise comparisons of the between groups revealed that the disability scores in the ISE group compared to ICE, were significantly lower (F = 5.53; df = 2; P = 0.009). CONCLUSION: Neither stretching nor compression exercises affected FRR more than the control group in DGS patients. Between-group analyses suggest that ISE only has a more significant effect on improving the disability of patients with the deep gluteal syndrome.

The effects of combining radiofrequency (RF) therapy with static stretching (SS) on hamstring tightness have not been investigated. Therefore, we aimed to verify the superiority of combining RF and SS over SS alone by comparing their immediate effects on hamstring flexibility. METHODS: This randomized controlled study included 33 participants with hamstring tightness. The participants were allocated to the RF (intervention; n = 17) or sham (n = 16) group. The RF group underwent SS simultaneously with RF therapy. The sham group underwent SS with sham RF (powered off). The range of motion (ROM) for knee extension and five muscle properties (tone, stiffness, elasticity, relaxation, and creep) of the lateral and medial hamstrings were measured before and after the intervention. RESULTS: There was no significant difference in the ROM for knee extension (p = 0.295) between the RF and sham groups. The interaction between group and period (p > 0.05) was not significant for any of the muscle properties of the lateral and medial hamstrings besides lateral hamstring elasticity (p = 0.001). CONCLUSION: RF therapy in conjunction with SS for hamstring tightness produced different changes in muscle properties compared with SS alone. However, these changes did not produce differences in the ROM for knee extension.",

Thus, this systematic review aimed to compare the effectiveness of deep dry needling with stretching versus stretching alone on pain among patients with MTPs. METHODS: The PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and Scopus databases were searched to identify studies analysing the effect of deep dry needling in combination with stretching versus stretching alone for the treatment of pain. The Cochrane risk of bias 2 tool (RoB2) was used to assess the risk of bias, and the DerSimonian‒Laird method was applied to estimate the pooled standard effect sizes (ESs) and their 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs). RESULTS: Five randomized controlled trials were included in this systematic review, and their pooled ES for pain was -1.73 (95% CI: -3.06; -0.40). The RoB2 tool revealed that four studies had an unclear risk of bias, and one study had a high risk of bias. CONCLUSIONS: Adding deep dry needling to stretching for the treatment of MTP may be an effective approach for the treatment of pain in patients with MTPs. Further research is needed to clarify the ideal number of local twitch responses to perform during deep dry needling.",

      "abstract": "CONTEXT: Professional soccer players frequently experience fatigue due to the demanding nature of the sport. In this context, effective recovery strategies are essential for maintaining performance. Static stretching (SS) is commonly used in soccer, but its efficacy is debated. Vibration foam rolling (VFR) is a novel recovery technique that has not been extensively studied in soccer. OBJECTIVE: This research aimed to investigate the acute effects of VFR (3 sets of 45 s of rolling and 15 s of rest between sets) and SS (3 sets of 45 s and 15 s of rest between sets) on muscle contractile properties in professional soccer players. DESIGN: Eighteen players participated in this counterbalanced crossover study. Settings: After a 1-week washout period between sessions, the subjects completed the 2 condition trials (VFR or SS) in counterbalanced order following a training session, which had a duration of 77 min and a total distance of 6500 m covered. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Muscle contractile properties of the rectus femoris were assessed with tensiomyography before training (pre), immediately after training (post 1), and postrecovery intervention (post 2). Tensiomyography parameters included maximal radial muscle-belly displacement and contraction time and velocity. Data were analyzed using repeated-measures analysis of variance. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in the training load between groups during the training sessions (P > .05). Results showed that maximal radial muscle-belly displacement (P = .004) and contractiontime (P = .007) significantly decrease from pre (before training) to post 1 (after training). No significant main effects for group were obtained for all the variables (P > .05). However, both VFR and SS interventions effectively restored maximal radialmuscle-belly displacement (P = .011) and contraction time (P = .008) from post 1 (after) to post 2 (postrecovery intervention), suggesting reduced muscular stiffness. Contraction velocity remained unchanged after both interventions (P > .05). CONCLUSIONS: Therefore, these interventions could offer valuable advantages for posttraining neuromuscular acute recovery in professional soccer players.",

      "abstract": "Restless leg syndrome (RLS) is a neurological disorder characterized by an irresistible urge to move the legs, particularly during rest. It significantly affects the quality of life of hemodialysis patients with high prevalence in this population. While pharmacological treatments, especially dopamine agonists (DAs), are commonly used, they often come with side effects and augmentation phenomena. This systematic review examines the effectiveness of exercise interventions in managing RLS among hemodialysis patients. Eight studies, including randomized controlled trials and quasi-experimental studies, were analyzed. The interventions primarily consisted of aerobic exercises (cycling) and stretching exercises, with durations ranging from eight weeks to six months. The primary outcome measure was RLS severity, assessed using validated scales such as the International Restless Legs Syndrome Study Group (IRLSSG) scale or the Restless Legs Syndrome Questionnaire (RLSQ). Secondary outcomes included sleep quality, depression, and physical performance. The results consistently demonstrated that both aerobic and stretching exercises significantly reduced RLS severity and improved related outcomes. The intradialytic nature of some interventions offered a practical approach to incorporating exercise into patient routines. While exercise showed comparable efficacy to DAs in reducing RLS symptoms and improving depression scores, only DAs significantly enhanced sleep quality in one comparative study. These findings suggest that exercise interventions may be a viable non-pharmacological approach to managing RLS in hemodialysis patients, potentially complementing or reducing reliance on pharmacological treatments."

This study examined the impact of incorporating neurodynamic slump stretch and suboccipital muscle inhibition into passive static stretching on hamstring flexibility in individuals with short hamstrings. METHODS: 117 female participants were classified into three groups: the control group, which received passive static stretch of the hamstring muscle; the neurodynamic slump group, which received neurodynamic slump stretch with passive static stretch; and the suboccipital muscle inhibition group, which received suboccipital muscle inhibition with passive static stretch, for three sessions a week, 10 min each, for four weeks. The outcome measures were the popliteal angle test (PAT), straight leg raising (SLR) test, and forward bending test (FBT) at baseline, immediately following the first session and after four weeks. RESULTS: Statistically significant differences were found within groups (p < 0.001) for all outcome measures. Between the groups, there was a more significant improvement in the PAT and the SLR tests, favoring the neurodynamic slump and suboccipital muscle inhibition groups in comparison with the passive static stretch group (p < 0.001) with no significant difference between the two groups after the first session and at four weeks of treatment. However, the FBT showed no significant differences immediately following the first session or at four weeks of treatment (p > 0.05).

Disorders in this area can cause severe symptoms such as neck pain, restricted movement, and neurological issues such as headaches and balance problems. Exercise and physical activity improves muscle strength, flexibility, joint stability, reducing pain, and enhancing joint function, while specifically for the CV junction, exercise can relieve muscle tension, boost blood flow, and improve posture, although the specific impact on CV junction health remains underexplored. METHODS: A comprehensive literature search was conducted using databases MEDLINE, Cochrane, Lilacs, and ScienceDirect, alongside manual searches through reference lists. The review focuses on exercise and CV junction issues and includes randomized controlled trials, cohort or case-control studies, and systematic reviews. Primary outcomes include pain levels, joint mobility, function, and quality of life. RESULTS: Results yield four meta-analyses with corrective exercise and conventional exercise in improving forward head posture risk difference 0.00 (-0.09, 0.09) 95% confidence interval (CI), between cervical and thoracic exercises odds ratio 1.04 (0.59, 1.84) 95% CI.

OBJECTIVES: To determine the effect of chest expansion resistance exercise and respiratory muscle stretching on respiratory function and gait endurance in patients with stroke. METHODS: Thirty stroke patients were randomly assigned to a chest expansion resistance group (CERG), a respiratory muscle stretching group (RMSG), and a control group (CG). CERG and RMSG received chest expansion resistance and respiratory muscle stretching, respectively, 3 times a week for 8 weeks. Respiratory function, respiratory muscle strength, and gait endurance were measured before and after the intervention period. RESULTS: The experimental groups, CERG and RMSG, showed significant improvements in respiratory function variables (p < .05). For respiratory muscle strength variables, maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP) in the CERG and maximal expiratory pressure (MEP) in the RMSG showed significant changes compared to the CG (p < .05). Both CERG and RMSG also showed significant improvements in the 6MWT compared to the CG (p < .05). CONCLUSION: Chest expansion resistance exercise would be a more effective method, while both chest expansion resistance exercise and respiratory muscle stretching are helpful in improving respiratory function and gait endurance."

Across selected studies, we evaluated TCMA and ST using Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ) scores, pain symptoms, fatigue levels, and sleep quality as outcome measures. Compared with control groups, participants receiving TCMA and ST interventions showed significantly lower FIQ scores (Standard Mean Difference (SMD) = -3.01, 95% Confidence Interval (CI) [-4.83,-1.19]), improved pain symptoms (SMD = -0.77, 95% CI [-1.07,-0.47]), less fatigue (SMD = 1.31, 95% CI [0.50,2.11]), and enhanced sleep quality (SMD = -0.55, 95% CI [-0.97,-0.12]). Subgroup analyses revealed that, irrespective of intervention duration, both TCMA and ST interventions were effective in relieving pain symptoms in these patients. ST interventions showed significant improvement in fatigue symptoms, while TCMA interventions positively influenced sleep quality. These findings highlight potential non-pharmalogical benefits of TCMA and ST interventions in managing FMS. However, future research should explore the optimal duration, frequency, intensity, and types of interventions for TCMA and ST and design targeted exercise intervention programs to study the effects of these interventions on different characteristics of FMS patients. Attention should be given to the effects of short-term interventions on improving fatigue symptoms, sleep quality, and pain relief, to provide more personalized and effective FMS treatment plans.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: A combination of hamstring stretching and strengthening exercises may benefit patients with knee osteoarthritis by promoting pain relief and disability improvement. PURPOSE: The current study aimed to compare the effects of lateral hamstring strengthening and medial hamstring stretching with general hamstring stretching and general hamstring strengthening on pain, disability, and quality of life in patients with primary knee osteoarthritis and varus deformity. METHODS: Forty patients with knee osteoarthritis were randomly assigned to two groups: a general hamstring strengthening group (14 women, 6 men) and a selective hamstring strengthening group (16 women, 4 men). In the general hamstring strengthening group, participants performed hamstring stretching and strengthening exercises broadly. In contrast, the selective hamstring strengthening group specifically targeted lateral hamstring strengthening and medial hamstring stretching. The treatment program was conducted three times a week for 4 weeks. Pain and disability levels were evaluated before and after treatment using the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), quality of life was assessed using the Osteoarthritis Knee and Hip Quality of Life (OAKHQOL) questionnaire, and physical activity levels were determined using the Tegner activity scale. RESULTS: Both groups demonstrated significant improvement in all outcomes except for the quality of life subscale of the KOOS questionnaire (p = .98) in the general hamstring strengthening group. However, the selective hamstring strengthening group exhibited greater improvements in symptoms (p = .02, effect size (d) = 0.92) and pain subscales (p = .01, d = 0.80) according to the KOOS questionnaire. Additionally, the pain subscale (p = .02, d = 0.79) of the OAKHQOL questionnaire exhibited greater improvements in the selective hamstring strengthening group. Tegner activity scale scores significantly improved in both groups. CONCLUSION: Strengthening the lateral hamstring and stretching the medial hamstring muscles seem to be beneficial for reducing pain in patients with primary knee osteoarthritis and varus deformity. Attention to stabilization in frontal and horizontal planes in the knee joint might be better than simply evaluating the joint in the sagittal plane."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Non-specific LBP refers to back pain which arises from the spine, intervertebral discs and surrounding soft tissues in the absence of pathologic lesions. Most cases of non-specific LBP are not the result of a single injury from a high load, but the result of repetitive, cumulative micro-injuries. The aim of the study was to assess the effectiveness of strengthening, stretching and mixed exercises in patients with non-specific LBP and their impact on pain intensity. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We analysed 90 patients with non-specific LBP who performed prolonged sedentary work. Patients were qualified following history-taking, a physical examination and radiological evaluation if no pathology had been revealed on examination or on the available diagnostic imaging scans. The participants were randomly divided into 3 groups of 30 individuals each. The patients in each group performed one type of exercise (strengthening, stretching, mixed) for a period of 3 months. Both before starting and on completion of the exercise period, the patients were assessed with an original questionnaire as well as the Rolland-Morris, Oswestry and SF-12 scoring systems. RESULTS: Strengthening exercises were the most effective in reducing pain; on completion of the exercise period, pain assessed with the NRS scale was 2 points in the strengthening exercise group, 3 points, in the mixed group, and 4 points in the stretching group. The SF-12 questionnaire showed an improvement in the patients' health (increase in \"excellent\" and \"very good\" scores from 7% to 60%). According to the Oswestry disability questionnaire, strengthening exercises were the most effective (mean disability score of 4). CONCLUSIONS: 1. The use of strengthening exercises in patients with non-specific LBP most effectively improves function and reduces back pain. 2. The use of stretching and mixed exercises in patients with non-specific LBP improves function and reduces back pain, but to a lesser extent than strengthening exercises.",

[Participants and Methods] A randomized controlled trial was conducted with 96 healthy university students equally assigned to either a simultaneous NMES and static stretching group (Group S) or an NMES-only group (Group C). The gastrocnemius muscle was the target of both NMES and static stretching. Ankle dorsiflexion angle (DFA), forward flexion distance (FFD), and ankle plantar flexor strength (PFS) were measured before and directly following intervention. Outcomes in the two groups were evaluated using two-way analysis of variance. [Results] A significant time effect was observed for both DFA and FFD, whereas a significant interaction effect was observed for FFD only. Improvements in DFA were similar between the groups; however, improvements in FFD were significantly greater in Group S. PFS showed no significant interaction between the group and the time factor. [Conclusion] Our findings suggest that simultaneous intervention enhances flexibility. Despite targeting the gastrocnemius muscle, the observed improvement in hamstring flexibility may have been because of fascial connections. These findings support the efficacy and safety of NMES combined with static stretching for increasing flexibility."

      "abstract": "Background Plantar fasciitis is a common foot condition with multifactorial etiology. It is the most frequent cause of heel pain and has been categorized as an overuse syndrome. A clinical examination and history are crucial for diagnosis. There are several different forms of treatment available, two of which are frequently used: physical therapy and steroid injections. Recent research on platelet-rich plasma (PRP) has demonstrated encouraging outcomes and fewer side effects when compared to steroid injections. Methods A randomized controlled trial was conducted and randomization was done of indoor patients into two groups. Group 1, ending with odd numbers, was given PRP injections, and Group 2, ending with even numbers, was advised plantar-specific calf stretching exercises. Visual analog scale (VAS) scores were evaluated before and after the intervention and follow-up was done on the second, sixth, and 12th weeks. Results Comparing the VAS scores between the two groups, we found that in the pre-intervention phase, the VAS score of Group 1 was 5.4±0.56 and that of Group 2 was 5.4±0.59. In the post-intervention phase, the VAS score in Group 1 was 4.6±0.89, while in Group 2 it was 5.2±0.62. In the second week after intervention, the VAS score was observed to be 3.3±0.97 in Group 1, while in Group 2, it was 3.3±0.80. After the sixth week of intervention, the observed VAS score was 2.7±0.78, while in Group 2 it was 2.9±0.82. The mean VAS score after 12weeks of intervention was observed to be 2.3±0.91 in Group 1, while in Group 2, it was 2.2±0.80. Conclusion PRP injections and plantar-specific calf stretching exercises are equally effective in providing pain relief in plantar fasciitis. PRP injections have complications and problems which have been discussed. Exercises are devoid of such complications. No recurrences occurred in the exercise group and four cases had recurrence in the PRP group."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Stretching exercises are widely used for pain relief and show positive effects on musculoskeletal, nociplastic and neuropathic pain; the magnitude of altered pain sensitivity responses following regular stretching is currently unknown. This study aimed to investigate the effect of six weeks of regular stretching exercise on regional and widespread pain sensitivity and range of motion and the effect of stretching cessation on regional and widespread pain sensitivity and range of motion. METHODS: An experimental single-blind longitudinal repeated measures study. Twenty-six healthy adults were recruited. Regional and distant pressure pain thresholds and passive knee extension range of motion were measured at three points: before (baseline) and after six weeks (post-stretch) of daily bilateral hamstring stretching exercises and following four weeks of cessation (post-cessation) from stretching exercises. RESULTS: Participants had a mean ± standard deviation (range) age of 23.8 ± 2.1 (21-30) years. There was a 36.7% increase in regional (p = 0.003), an 18.7% increase in distant pressure pain thresholds (p = 0.042) and a 3.6% increase in range of motion (p = 0.002) between baseline and post-stretch measures. No statistically significant differences were found for regional (p = 1.000) or distant pressure pain thresholds (p = 1.000), or range of motion (p = 1.000) between post-stretch and post-cessation. A 41.2% increase in distant pressure pain thresholds (p = 0.001), a 15.4% increase in regional pressure pain thresholds from baseline to post-cessation (p = 0.127) and a 3.6% increase in passive knee extension range of motion (p = 0.005) were found from baseline to post-cessation. CONCLUSIONS: Six weeks of regular stretching exercises significantly decreased regional and widespread pain sensitivity. Moreover, the results showed that the hypoalgesic effect of stretching on regional and widespread pain sensitivity persisted following four weeks of cessation. The results further support the rationale of adding stretching exercises to rehabilitation efforts for patients experiencing nociceptive, nociplastic, and neuropathic pain. However, further research is needed to investigate how the long-term effects of stretching exercises compare with no treatment in clinical populations. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The trial was registered June 1st, 2021 at ClinicalTrials.gov (Trial registration number NCT04919681)."

      "abstract": "Introduction: Stretching exercises are important in both the prevention and treatment of nonspecific low back pain (NLBP). The aim of this trial was to determine whether an 8-week active hamstring stretching protocol combined with core stabilization and education regarding the maintenance of a neutral lumbar spine during activities could reduce NLBP and low back discomfort during prolonged sitting among young people. Methods: Participants (52 students aged 18-25) were randomly assigned to one of two groups: the Experimental group (the hamstring stretching group) and the Control group (only education). The intervention was conducted for 8 weeks. The primary outcome measures were pain intensity (VAS), low back discomfort (LBD), and functional disability (ODI). The secondary outcome measures were satisfaction with the intervention (GPE) and flexibility of the hamstring (SLR). Results: After the 8-week intervention in the E-group, results of VAS, ODI, and LBD were significantly lower comparing to baseline. In the C-group, no significant differences were observed. After the exercises program, there were differences between the E-group and C-group in VAS, LBD, GPE, and SLR tests (p < 0.05, p < 0.05, p < 0.05, and p < 0.0001, respectively). Conclusions: In conclusion, our study provides compelling evidence that an eight-week program of active hamstring stretching and core stabilization exercises can significantly reduce NLBP and musculoskeletal discomfort during prolonged sitting in young adults. These findings highlight the importance of targeted exercise interventions in managing and preventing NLBP, particularly among sedentary populations. Further research is warranted to confirm these findings and explore their applicability to broader populations and over extended periods."

      "abstract": "CONTEXT: Proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation stretching (PNFS) is suggested to improve the range of motion and flexibility as an active warm-up. Recently, the foam rolling (FR) methods have also emerged as a passive warm-up. However, the combined effects of PNFS and FR are still unclear, and no reports have compared their effects using thermal imaging. This study investigated the acute effects of combining nonvibration FR (NVFR) and vibration FR (VFR) prior to PNFS, in comparison with PNFS alone, on hamstring flexibility and thigh skin temperature. DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial. METHODS: Participants (n = 60) were randomly assigned to PNFS, NVFR + PNFS, VFR + PNFS, and control group (CG). Active knee-extension (AKE), sit and reach (SR) test, and thermal imaging were evaluated before (pre-int), immediately after (post-int), and 30-minutes after (post30-int) intervention. RESULTS: All intervention groups had a significant increase at all time periods (P < .001) except the CG in terms of AKE and sit and reach test (P > .05). Combined (NVFR + PNFS/VFR + PNFS) groups had also a significant increase in the post30-int compared with pre-int and post-int values of thigh skin temperature (P < .001). Combined groups, over time, had the best post30-int effect on increasing skin temperature. The study found a significant interaction effect between interventions and time across several measurements (P < .05). Combined groups showed more significant improvements in AKE compared to CG at post-int (P < .05). There is a similar change in AKE, SR test, and skin temperatures between combined groups and PNFS alone at both post-int and post30-int (P < .05). CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that using FR, with or without vibration, before PNFS does not provide an additional benefit in improving hamstring flexibility and thigh skin temperatures compared with PNFS alone.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Global Active Stretching is a relatively recent yet little studied stretching method. It differs from the most popular methods by targeting muscle chains and integrating stretching with muscle contractions, which may eventually avoid the post-stretching reduction of strength that occurs in other methods. OBJECTIVES: To verify the immediate effects of Global Active Stretching on muscle strength and flexibility in individuals with short hamstrings. METHODS: A single-blind randomised controlled trial was carried out on 30 volunteers with more than 20° in the active knee extension test, randomly assigned to three groups: the experimental group (Global Active Stretching exercise); the placebo group (Global Active Stretching initial position without stretching); and the control group (lying down). The active knee extension and fingertip-to-floor tests assessed hamstring and posterior chain flexibility. Hamstring and quadriceps strength were assessed using the peak torque evaluation in the Biodex System 4PRO®. Assessments took place before and immediately after the 15-minute intervention. The ANOVA and the paired t test were used (α = 0.05). RESULTS: The experimental group had a significant increase in flexibility in both the fingertip-to-floor test (8.3 cm) and the active knee extension test (6.3°) when compared to the placebo and control groups (p < 0.05), while no differences in strength were observed (p > 0.05). CONCLUSION: Global Active Stretching immediately increased hamstring flexibility without significantly reducing muscle strength. Thus, individuals seeking to enhance their short-term flexibility can benefit from this programme in a single session without compromising performance."

      "abstract": "IMPORTANCE: Stroke is a leading cause of disability worldwide and is often accompanied by complications such as spasticity. Static stretching (SS) is a common physiotherapy intervention for reducing spasticity, whereas dry needling (DN) is a novel approach. However, the combined effects of DN and SS on spasticity have not been thoroughly investigated. Given the pivotal effect of spasticity on daily activities, mitigating spasticity can significantly contribute to restoring patient independence. OBJECTIVE: This study will explore the impact of DN plus SS on spasticity, alpha motor neuron excitability, overall function, and quality of life in patients with chronic stroke. DESIGN, SETTING, AND POPULATION: A double-blind, randomized, sham-controlled trial will be conducted in patients with post-stroke spasticity in the plantar flexor muscles. Twentyeight participants will be randomly assigned to either an intervention or control group. The intervention group will receive DN (60s × 3 days/week; 1 week) plus SS (20 min × 5 days/ week; 1 week). The control group will undergo sham DN (60s × 3 days/week; 1 week) and SS (20 min × 5 days/week; 1 week). EXPOSURES: DN plus SS or sham DN plus SS. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Both groups will be assessed at baseline, immediately post-treatment, and after 1 week of follow-up. Outcome measures will include the Modified Modified Ashworth Scale, H-reflex latency, Hmax/Mmax ratio, active and passive ankle dorsiflexion range of motion, timed up and go test, and the EuroQol questionnaire. RESULTS: Results from this randomized, sham-controlled study will provide evidence for the effectiveness of DN in combination with SS for spasticity. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The additional impact of DN in conjunction with SS, a widely used method for reducing muscle tone, remains unclear and warrants investigation. This study, with a high level of evidence, aims to address this knowledge gap.",

      "abstract": "STUDY DESIGN: Preclinical pilot study. OBJECTIVES: To explore peripheral and central nociceptive mechanisms that contribute to muscle stretch-induced locomotor deficits following spinal cord injury. SETTING: Kentucky Spinal Cord Injury Research Center, Louisville, KY, USA. METHODS: Ten female Sprague-Dawley rats received moderate, 25 g/cm T10 contusion injuries and recovered for 4 weeks. Rats were divided into three groups: Morphine/Ibuprofen-treated, Acetaminophen/Baclofen-treated, and saline control. Each group received daily hindlimb muscle stretching during weeks 4, 5, 9, and 10 post-injury and drugs were administered with stretching during weeks 4 and 9 only. Locomotor function was assessed throughout the experiment using the BBB Open Field Locomotor Scale. Hindlimb responses including spasticity, writhing, and clonic-like vibrations during muscle stretching were classified and scored. RESULTS: Consistent with our previous studies, hindlimb muscle stretching caused significant deficits in locomotor recovery following spinal cord injury. Baclofen and Ibuprofen partially mitigated the stretching effect, but none of the drugs significantly prevented the drop in locomotor function during stretching. Interestingly, treatment with Baclofen or Ibuprofen significantly reduced hindlimb responses such as spasticity and writhing during stretching, while Morphine exacerbated clonic-like vibrations in response to stretching maneuvers. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that stretching may inhibit locomotor recovery through combined mechanisms of peripheral inflammation and sensitization of nociceptive afferents. When combined with central sprouting and loss of descending controls after SCI, this results in exaggerated nociceptive input during stretching. The inability of the applied clinical drugs to mitigate the detrimental effects of stretching highlights the complexity of the stretching phenomenon and emphasizes the need for further investigation.",

      "abstract": "Large-wound treatment often requires autologous skin grafting or skin flap transfer, causing iatrogenic secondary injuries. Thus, we have developed an automatic wound closure system that consists of a stretch module, microcontroller, and touch screen. Full-thickness wounds (8 × 14 cm) on Bama miniature pigs were manually closed by direct suture in control animals and with three different tension levels performed by the automatic device in the experimental animals. Wound-closure conditions, post-closure healing, and scars were evaluated. Post-operative microscopic changes in collagen fibers, local cell apoptosis, and changes in vascular density were compared between the two wound-closure techniques. In the control group and the first experimental group, which used a traction force of 15 N, primary wound closure could not be achieved. The other two experimental groups used a traction force of 30 N and 60 N and all wounds achieved primary closure. Collagen-fiber stretching was observed histologically in all groups and collagen-fiber breakdown occurred in some wounds when the traction force was 60 N. Scar hyperplasia was significantly reduced in the automatic wound closure system groups. The collagen content decreased, cell apoptosis increased, and vascular density decreased in local tissues in the early post-closure stage, but eventually recovered to normal-skin levels. In summary, we developed an automatic wound closure system that effectively and safely stretches dermal-collagen fibers under an appropriate traction force (30 N) and stretch wound-peripheral skin to cover the wound, achieve primary closure, and reduce scar hyperplasia.",

This study aimed to explore the auricular growth potential of patients with concha-type microtia at different ages after auricular cartilage stretching surgery. METHODS: A total of 66 patients with unilateral grade II and III concha-type microtia were involved in this prospective cohort study. All patients underwent auricular cartilage stretching surgery. Relevant data were collected before surgery, immediately after surgery, and at the last follow-up. RESULTS: The perimeter, width, and length of auricle, between each follow-up, was statistically significant, which supported the effect of surgery and auricular development. For patients in the grade II group, no statistical significance was found in the difference in the perimeter, width, and length between the affected and normal auricle. For the patients in the grade III group, the difference in the relevant indexes of the affected auricle was significantly different from those of the normal auricle. Between subgroups divided according to their age, the growth potential of affected auricle with the same degree of deformity was statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: Growth potential of the affected auricle of the grade II group was consistent with that of the normal auricle, which was significantly higher than that of the grade III group. For patients at different ages, auricles grew faster before 3 years of age. Surgical intervention improved the auricular aesthetics and released the auricular growth potential. Thus, surgical intervention should be recommend as early as possible.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Stretching improves range of motion and changes the viscoelastic properties of muscle-tendon units. We hypothesized that a regular stretching program would reduce the functional consequences of pain for employees working in echocardiographic, ultrasound, and interventional laboratories. This exploratory, proof-of-concept study was meant to inform expectations for future randomized, controlled studies. METHODS: In this unblinded, nonrandomized, observational study, we enrolled 196 health care professionals working in the interventional and echocardiographic laboratories in the departments of cardiology and radiology at Mayo Clinic and Mayo Clinic Health System to perform 15-minute neck, upper extremity, low back, and lower extremity stretches for 1 year. The functional consequences of pain were self-reported by using the Disability of Arm, Shoulder, and Hand; Neck Disability Index; and Roland-Morris Questionnaire, which was administered at baseline and at 1 year to measure response to stretching. Monitoring with an assessment plan for injuries was undertaken. Employees who were pregnant, unable to do exercises, or under active orthopedic treatment, were excluded. RESULTS: Of the 196 enrolled, 68 (35%) provided complete data at both baseline and follow-up. The majority of participants were over 40 years (n = 51; 72%) and female (n = 51; 72%). Participants performed stretches for 120.5 (IQR, 52-184) days over the year. The number of days of doing the stretches was well distributed across the study period with median quarters 1, 2, 3, and 4 of 32 (19-51), 32 (20-51), 31 (17-45), and 32.5 (12-47) days, respectively. The majority of participants (52.3%) stretched before, 18.9% stretched during and 28.8% stretched after work. Self-reported upper extremity disability improved in the treatment group with a significant decrease in the median Disability of Arm, Shoulder, and Hand score (5.2 to 2.6; P = .002). There was an absolute 4% decrease in the Neck Disability Index score, between baseline and 1-year follow-up (10% to 6%, P = .017). There was not a significant change in the Roland-Morris Questionnaire from baseline to follow-up (1 to 0; P = .287). No participant reported any stretch-related injuries. CONCLUSIONS: A routine stretching program may represent an attractive, low-cost, noninvasive option to reduce upper extremity musculoskeletal disability of employees working in the echocardiographic, ultrasound, and interventional laboratories. Larger randomized trials are needed to confirm the association."

      "abstract": "Fibromyalgia is one of the most prevalent chronic pain disorders. Fibromyalgia is characterised by generalised pain. In addition, patients with fibromyalgia often have co-morbidity. Since no cure is available, the treatment is based on symptom management, with physical exercise being the recommended first-line treatment. Different exercise modalities have been examined, including the practice of stretching exercises. The aim of the systematic review is to summarise the efficacy of stretching exercises on fibromyalgia symptoms and to study the content and the quality of the current evidence. The review followed the recommendations of the PRISMA statement. The search for articles was performed in April 2023. We searched on MEDLINE, PubMed, CINAHL, Web of Science, SCOPUS, AMED, PEDro, ClinicalTrials.gov and the Cochrane Collaboration Trials Register. The search was updated in March 2024. The protocol was registered in PROSPERO. Risk of Bias was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool, and quality assessment was performed using the GRADE approach. In total, 2586 studies were found in the database searches, of which nine were included in the analysis. The primary outcome was pain. Secondary outcomes were self-reported quality of life, fatigue and physical and mental functioning. The available evidence shows that stretching exercises may improve pain, health-related quality of life and physical and mental functioning, but the level of evidence is low. The main limitation is due to issues with the heterogeneity of the interventions and small sample sizes. Trial registration: PROSPERO registration number CRD42023399614. Key Points • Stretching exercises show promise in the treatment of fibromyalgia. They may improve pain, health-related quality of life, physical functioning and mental health, but the level of evidence is low. • This study goes beyond previous research by presenting a more comprehensive and detailed analysis of the content and methodological quality of the current evidence. • Further research with clearly outlined protocols must be carried out to advance our understanding of the benefits of stretching exercises on fibromyalgia symptoms.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Isometric training is used in sport, conventional physical activity and rehabilitation. Understandably, there is a great deal of research related to its effect on performance. It is known that the length of the muscle at the moment of contraction is a determinant of strength levels. In the literature we find research on isometric training in short muscle lengths, although it has not been studied in maximally shortened positions or the acute effects that occur after its application. Ballistic stretching (BS) is also popular in sport. Their execution involves actively reaching maximally shortened muscle positions. So far, isometric training has not been compared with protocols involving ballistic stretching. Considering the above, the aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of BS and voluntary isometric contraction at maximal shortening (VICAMS) on range of motion, strength and vertical jump. METHODS: The study involved 60 healthy, physically active individuals (40 and 52 years old) who were randomly assigned to three groups: BS, VICAMS and a control group (CG). To assess acute effects, before and after the intervention, active range of motion (AROM), maximal voluntary isometric force (MVIF) and countermovement jump height (CMJ) were determined. RESULTS: Time main effects and time*group interactions were found for all variables (p < 0.001). Between-group differences were shown for the VICAMS group after the intervention, with statistically significant higher AROM values compared to the other groups. MVIF values were also higher in the VICAMS group. Intra-group differences were observed for the VICAMS and Ballistic groups, as values on all variables increased from baseline. For the CMJ, intra-group differences showed that both the VICAMS and BS groups improved values compared to baseline values. CONCLUSIONS: The application of VICAMS induced acute improvements over BS in AROM, MVIF and CMJ. These results are important for coaches seeking immediate performance improvement and offer an optimal solution to the warm-up protocol.",

METHODS: Google Scholars, PubMed, Embase, Cochrane, MEDLINE, CNKI, Wanfang, and VIP were searched from inception to August 2023. We included randomized controlled trials that investigated the effectiveness of hamstring stretching exercises in patients with low back pain. The primary outcomes assessed were pain intensity, hamstring muscle flexibility, and function. Study selection, data extraction, and assessment of risk of bias were performed independently by two reviewers. RESULTS: Our searches retrieved 344 trials, of which 14 met the inclusion criteria for this review (n = 735 participants). The combined meta-analysis showed hamstring stretching resulted in lower pain scores (standardized mean difference = -0.72, 95% confidence interval: -1.35 to -0.09; I 2 = 89%, p = 0.03) in different categories of low back pain. Subgroup analysis showed that hamstring stretching led to a larger range of motion for cases of back pain with radiating pain (standardized mean difference = 2.39, 95% confidence interval: 1.76 to 3.02; I 2 = 0%, p < 0.001). The combined meta-analysis revealed that hamstring stretching resulted in lower Oswestry Disability Index scores in comparison to regular treatment, particularly in individuals suffering from low back pain across all subtypes (mean difference = -6.97, 95% confidence interval: -13.34 to -0.60; I 2 = 95%, p = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of hamstring stretching exercises in reducing pain intensity in various categories of low back pain and improving the straight leg raise in patients experiencing back pain with radiating pain. Additionally, it highlights the improvement in function for patients with back pain across all subtypes."

Oral splints are an accepted tool in the management of microstomia. However, the concepts of which oral splints to use, timing of initiation, and duration of treatment have not gained a consensus. This article reviews approaches to oral splinting and an alternative intraoral approach using splints designed to provide a graded, low load, multidirectional, and prolonged stretch specifically in facial burn survivors including those with mature scars. Two participants participated in a trial using oral splints placed inside the mouth at established contracture points. Participants were requested to use the splints for 1 h twice daily. Participants were photographed weekly producing 9 facial expressions, and distance between 13 facial landmarks was measured to evaluate change in tissue length. Numerical changes observed from beginning to end of the trial indicate positive and negative alterations, signifying lengthening or shortening of tissue. Negative changes denote reduction in distance between endpoints, while positive changes signify an increase. Participants verbalized functional improvements in oral motor and psychosocial function posttreatment. To date, oral splints can be custom fabricated for each individual patient. However, few oral splints are created to provide multidirectional stretch focusing on problem areas across the mid and lower face. The intraoral splints and regimen described here have the capability of providing a stretching intervention that could be applicable in various stages of burn recovery.",

However, its effect on the treatment of temporomandibular dysfunction (TMD) in patients with forward head posture (FHP) has not been fully investigated. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of PNF stretching exercises on the treatment of TMD in patients with FHP. METHODS: A prospective, randomized, double-blinded clinical trial. Twenty-four patients with TMD and FHP aged from 18-40 years were randomly assigned to PNF or control group. The PNF group composed of 12 patients received PNF stretching exercises of masticatory muscles in addition to routine physical therapy treatment (FHP correction exercises and ultrasound for the temporomandibular joint); the control group composed of 12 patients received routine physical therapy treatment only. Interventions were conducted twice a week for six weeks. Craniovertebral angle, pain threshold, pain intensity, temporomandibular joint ROM, and temporomandibular joint function were assessed for all participants before and after the intervention. The outcomes were analyzed using Two-way mixed MANOVA. For further multiple comparisons, post-hoc tests with the Bonferroni correction were performed. RESULTS: There was no significant difference between both groups pre-treatment (p> 0.05). Comparison between groups post-treatment revealed statistically significant differences in all outcome measures (p< 0.05) in favor of the PNF group. CONCLUSION: Adding PNF stretching exercises of masticatory muscles to routine physical therapy programs is an effective method for management of TMD in patients with FHP more than routine physical therapy programs alone.",

METHODS: We prospectively recruited 28 patients undergoing primary total hip arthroplasty from January 2021 to January 2023. The control group (13 patients) received a conventional rehabilitation protocol, while the intervention group (15 patients) received focused stretching exercises of the gluteus medius muscle in addition to the conventional rehabilitation protocol. Patients had preoperative and postoperative surface electromyography (sEMG) to assess muscle activity. RESULTS: Patients in the intervention group after surgery had better muscle activation according to sEMG during walking and during one leg stance compared to the control group. Also, patients from the intervention group had better strength of the gluteus medius muscle after surgery, but this did not reach statistical significance. CONCLUSIONS: The present prospective study demonstrated that implementation of focused gluteus medius muscle stretching results in statistically significantly higher muscle activation as measured by sEMG. The strength of the gluteus medius muscle is also higher as measured using a dynamometer, albeit not reaching statistical significance. Based on the findings of this sEMG study, it appears that focused stretching and strengthening of abductors muscles are beneficial.",

The study aimed to observe the therapeutic effect of static progressive stretching (SPS) combined with botulinum toxin type A (BTX-A) on knee joint stiffness in rats and its effect on the transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-β1)/small mother against decapentaplegic (Smad) pathway in the development of joint capsule fibrosis. Forty Sprague Dawley rats were randomly divided into the blank control group, model control group, SPS intervention group, BTX-A intervention group, and SPS combined with BTX-A intervention group. Except for the blank control group, the right knee joints of the other rats were surgically fixed with Kirschner wire internal immobilization in full flexion for four weeks to form joint flexion contracture and cause fibrotic stiffness of the joint. The therapeutic effect of each intervention was assessed by the range of motion (ROM) of the knee joint, joint stiffness, the number of total cells, and collagen deposition in the posterior joint capsule, as well as the protein level expressions of  TGF-β1, Smad2, Smad3, Smad4, p-Smad2/3, collagen I and III, and alpha smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) in the posterior joint capsule in the TGF-β1/Smad pathway. SPS combined with BTX-A was more effective in relieving joint fibrosis stiffness, improving the histopathological changes in the posterior joint capsule, and suppressing the high expression of target proteins and the overactivated TGF-β1/Smad pathway. The overactivated TGF-β1/Smad pathway was involved in the formation of knee joint fibrosis stiffness in rats. SPS combined with BTX-A was effective in relieving joint flexion contracture and fibrosis of the joint capsule. Moreover, the inhibition of the overactivated TGF-β1/Smad pathway may be the potential molecular mechanism for its therapeutic effect.",

METHOD: The study was conducted as a randomised controlled experimental study. The study included a total of 80 individuals diagnosed with multiple sclerosis (MS) with a mean age of 43.5 ± 9.62 years (experimental group) and 41.4 ± 10.4 years (control group). All individuals were treated once and evaluated before and after the session. After recording the sociodemographic characteristics, spasticity assessment was performed with the Modified Ashword Scale (MAS), balance assessment with the Berg Balance Scale (BBS), ambulation status with the Timed Up and Go Test (TUG), and posterior chain muscle mobility (PCMM) with finger-to-ground distance measurement. RESULTS: The TUG (time to complete the distance) measurements of the experimental group after treatment were lower than those of the control group (p < 0.05). The value of PCMM measurements of the experimental group before the treatment was lower than that of the control group (p < 0.001). The difference in positive increase in PCMM measurements in the experimental group was higher than that in the control group (p < 0.05). After the treatment, the MAS value in the left knee of the experimental group was lower than that of the control group (p < 0.05). DISCUSSION: Myofascial stretching exercises applied to individuals with MS made an acute contribution to ambulation status and mobility of posterior chain muscles. There was no difference in the evaluation of spasticity and balance.",

Further, lack of exercise causes obesity. Therefore, we created a stretching exercise protocol to prevent musculoskeletal disorders in elementary school (middle and upper grades) children during their growth period, when rapid bone development begins. Patients and Methods: We examined the effects on pain, injury, and flexibility. Fifty-three (boys: 34, girls: 19) students in grades 3-5 (ages 9-11) performed the stretching exercises at school thrice a week for one year, and we compared the results before and a year after the intervention. Results: A three-minute stretching exercise routine achieved an intensity of 4.6-4.9 metabolic equivalents (METs; equivalent to brisk walking). Obesity (P=1.000), flexibility problems (inability to bend forward [P=0.754] or squat problems [P=1.000]), bone/joint pain (P=1.000), and injury (P=1.000) did not significantly increase. Conclusion: Stretching exercises during the growth period may help prevent childhood musculoskeletal disorders, obesity, and flexibility loss."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The aim of the present study was to compare the effects of resistance training through full range of motion and static stretching (SS) of the hip and lower back extensors on flexibility and strength in healthy, physically active, adults. METHODS: Eighteen participants (age: 24.2 ± 3.0 years, body mass: 71.3 ± 8.9 kg, height: 172.8 ± 7.5 cm) were randomly assigned to either a Resistance Training (RT) (n = 6), SS (n = 6), or control (CON) group (n = 6). The sit & reach (S&R) flexibility test and maximum isometric straight legged deadlift (ISLDL) at 95% and 50% range of motion (ROM) were tested pre- and post-intervention with significance set at p < 0.05. Both groups conducted four to eight sets per session. Within each set, the RT group performed eight repetitions each lasting four seconds, while the SS group stretched continuously for 32 s. The rest periods between each set were 60-90 s. Consequently training volume and rest times were matched between the groups. RESULTS: The RT and SS groups achieved significant, large magnitude improvements in the S&R test compared to the CON group (p < 0.01 g = 2.53 and p = 0.01, g = 2.44), but no differences were observed between the RT and SS groups (p = 1.00). Furthermore, the RT group demonstrated a larger improvement in 50% and 95% ROM ISLDL compared to SS (p < 0.01, g = 2.69-3.36) and CON (p < 0.01, g = 2.44-2.57). CONCLUSION: Resistance training through a full ROM was equally effective as SS for improving S&R flexibility, but improved hip- and lower back extensor strength more than SS and the CON. The authors recommend using large ROM resistance training to improve hip and lower back extensor flexibility and muscle strength. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ISRCTN88839251, registered 24.

A total of 43 patients who had a stroke with grade 2 spasticity or higher on the Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS) in their upper-limb muscles were randomly assigned to the intervention (n = 21) or control group (n = 22). The former received structured stretching exercises after their BONT/A injections for 20 min, 5 days per week, for 6 months at a hospital, while the others conducted self-stretching exercises at home. The outcome measures were assessed before the intervention (T0) and after three (T1) and six months (T2). Significantly greater improvements in the MAS scores of the elbows, wrists, and fingers were found in the intervention group's patients at T1 and T2. The behavioral outcome measures, including shoulder pain, activities of daily living, and quality of life, and our electrophysiological studies also showed a significantly higher enhancement in this patient group. In conclusion, the structured stretching exercises plus BONT/A injections for six months showed a superior effect in relieving post-stroke upper-limb spasticity compared to self-stretching exercises.",

Twelve participants completed three randomized experimental trials (no intervention, StS intervention, and SC intervention). Except for the intervention segments, each trial included standardized warm-ups and SJs at three different angles. Data were collected using a 3-dimensional injury motion capture system, an electromyography (EMG) recording system, and a force platform. The collected EMG data were subjected to amplitude calculations, while force-time data were used for RFD computation. Neither StS nor SC significantly impacted the average or peak EMG amplitudes of the five muscles examined (p>0.05). However, at an initial knee-joint angle of 120°, the StS group demonstrated significantly lower RFD values at three distinct phases (0-50 ms, 50-100 ms, and 0-peakforce) compared to those seen in the SC and control groups (p<0.05). For activities starting with a knee-joint angle of 120°, it is recommended to either avoid StS or combine it with ten repetitive drop jumps to mitigate any potential negative impact on explosiveness.",

However, its application to promote orthotic treatment for patients with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) remains unknown. OBJECTIVE: This study was to explore the effect of pre-orthosis stretching exercises on spinal flexibility and initial in-orthosis correction for the patients with AIS. STUDY DESIGN: A pilot-controlled study. METHODS: An experimental group (EG) of 13 subjects (10 girls and 3 boys) with AIS allocating to self-stretching exercises and a control group (CG) of 19 AIS subjects (14 girls and 5 boys) with no stretching before orthosis fitting were recruited. The spinal flexibility of the EG was evaluated with an ultrasound imaging system and physical measurements. The initial in-orthosis correction rates between the 2 groups were compared with the independent t test, and the correlation analysis between the spinal flexibility measured from ultrasound images and physical measurement was performed with the Pearson correlation test. RESULTS: The initial Cobb angle of EG and CG were 25.70° ± 7.30° and 28.09° ± 5.58°, respectively. No significant difference was observed between the initial in-orthosis Cobb angle of EG (11.13° ± 6.80°) and CG (15.65° ± 9.10°) (p = 0.06). However, the spinal flexibility after stretching exercises was improved (p < 0.001), and the spinal flexibility changes measured with ultrasound and physical forward-bending method were significantly correlated (r = 0.57, p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Stretching exercises before orthotic treatment could improve the spinal flexibility but did not cause a better in-orthosis correction. A study with a larger sample size and longer follow-up period should be conducted to investigate the long-term effect of stretching exercises."

Pain and ROM variables have been published in different journals, and their acute effects are only known after treatment and the results are effective. This study examined the low back function variable 24, 48, and 72 hours after treatment. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to determine the effectiveness of Tepurak and deep tissue massaging with stretching (DTMS) on low back function in nonspecific low back pain (NSLBP) and conduct a comparison of the effectiveness of Tepurak versus DTMS for low back function in NSLBP. METHODS: This research is a quasi-experiment using a pre-test/post-test design to determine the difference in scores before and after treatment. The variable measured involved the low back function using the Oswestry Disability Index. Measurements were carried out four times at pre-test, 24, 48, and 72 hours after the treatments. This study used two different sample groups. The research sample consisted of 42 NSLBP sufferers who were randomly divided into two groups, A and B. Group A received Tepurak treatment, while Group B received DTMS treatment. These treatments were carried out in one treatment session. RESULTS: The results of the different treatments for the low back function variables in the Tepurak treatment have a p-value of 0.000. The results of the low back function variables in the DTMS treatment have a p-value of 0.000. The results of the comparison test of Tepurak versus DTMS therapy for the low back function variable had a p-value of 0.771. CONCLUSION: Both Tepurak and DTMS are effective in improving low back function in NSLBP cases. In comparison between Tepurak and DTMS, there was no significant difference in the effectiveness in improving low back function in NSLBP cases."

We compared stretching or meditation in a randomized-controlled trial (RCT). PATIENTS: We enrolled 98 patients with a history of >4 muscle cramps in the prior month from 7/22-7/23. We randomized patients 1:1 to stretching versus meditation for 35 days. Our primary outcome was the change in cramp severity measured by the visual analogue scale for cramps (VAS-cramps, scaled 0-10). Secondary outcomes included a patient global impression of change (PGIC), change in sleep quality and global HRQOL measured using the EQ-5D and VAS-global HRQOL. RESULTS: Overall, 48% of patients had cirrhosis, 40% had diabetes, 16% the median age was 63, most were women (67%) and 81% were college educated. Both arms experienced a reduction in cramp severity-a median of 1.44 (.58-2.29) points for stretching and 1.97 (1.01-2.93) points for meditation. These changes were significant changes from baseline (p = .001 for stretching, p < .0001 for meditation) but these changes were equivalent between arms (p = .4). The PGIC was improved: 1.33 (1.02-1.65) for stretching, 1.05 (.70-1.41) for meditation, p-difference .2. Sleep was also improved for both. HRQOL did not change according to the Eq5D; according to the VAS, HRQOL rose for meditation by 6 (.1-11.8) points but not for stretching. More patients recommended stretching than meditation (79.2% vs. 55.3%, p = .02). CONCLUSION: In a randomized trial, stretching and meditation both reduced cramp severity and improved sleep quality and global impression of change. While patients preferred stretching, there was no difference in effect between arms.",

The purpose of the present study was to determine the acute and chronic effects of static stretching (SS) on intramuscular hamstring stiffness. Thirty healthy active participants had acute changes in passive biceps femoris (BF), semimembranosus (SM), and semitendinosus (ST) stiffness measured at 25% (proximal), 50% (middle), and 75% (distal) muscle length, using shear-wave elastography, immediately after SS. Participants then completed 4 weeks of either a SS intervention (n = 15) or no intervention (CON, n = 15) with stiffness measured before and after the interventions. The acute and chronic effects of SS were compared between anatomical regions and between regions on the basis of their relative stiffness pre-intervention. Acutely, SS decreased stiffness throughout the BF and SM (p ≤ 0.05) but not the ST (p = 0.326). However, a regional effect of stretching was observed for SM and ST with greater reduction in stiffness occurring in stiffer muscular regions (p = 0.001-0.013). Chronically, SS increased BF and ST (p < 0.05), but not SM (p = 0.422) stiffness compared with CON, but no regional effect of stretching was observed in any muscle (p = 0.361-0.833). SS resulted in contrasting acute and chronic effects, acutely decreasing stiffness in stiffer regions while chronically increasing stiffness. These results indicate that the acute effects of SS vary along the muscle's length on the basis of the relative stiffness of the muscle and that acute changes in stiffness from SS are unrelated to chronic adaptations.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Cerebral palsy (CP) is the most common motor disability in children. The initial lesion to the developing brain may result in a myriad of neuromuscular comorbidities, including mobility deficiencies. The neuromuscular contributions to disability and rehabilitative frameworks specific to children with CP have been investigated separately. However, few reviews have examined the relationship between neuromuscular pathophysiology and rehabilitative frameworks among children with CP. Therefore, the purpose of this review was to investigate the impact of dynamic stretching orthoses and therapeutic exercise on range of motion (ROM), aerobic capacity, and mobility in relation to the neuromuscular contributions to disability in children with CP. METHODS: Reviews of PubMed, Google Scholar, and Web of Science were conducted to identify literature focusing on the neuromuscular pathophysiology contributing to disability in children with CP and rehabilitative frameworks associated with this population. The search used a combination of keywords and subject headings to include 'cerebral palsy', 'musculoskeletal', 'neuromuscular', 'spasticity', 'rehabilitation', 'exercise', 'aerobic', and 'orthosis'. Selected manuscripts featured original cross-sectional and longitudinal research and meta-analyses. KEY CONTENT AND FINDINGS: A total of 303 manuscripts were initially identified through search terms, with 182 articles excluded based on title and abstract evaluation, leaving 121 manuscripts for full-text analysis. Seven studies meeting the narrative review criteria were included. Evidence supporting the efficacy of dynamic stretching orthoses for improving lower extremity ROM is inconclusive. Aerobic and progressive resistive training may be beneficial for improving aerobic capacity and muscle strength in children with CP, which may result in enhanced mobility. CONCLUSIONS: Depending on the individual's clinical presentation, ROM and therapeutic exercise may be implemented to optimize function. Incorporating progressive resistive and aerobic exercises into a rehabilitation plan may improve mobility and aerobic capacity. As such, clinicians should consider resistance and aerobic exercise prescription as part of a long-term treatment plan for children with CP."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Abnormal posture (e.g. loss of lordosis) has been associated with the occurrence of musculoskeletal pain. Stretching tight muscles while strengthening the antagonists represents the most common method to treat the assumed muscle imbalance. However, despite its high popularity, there is no quantitative synthesis of the available evidence examining the effectiveness of the stretch-and-strengthen approach. METHODS: A systematic review with meta-analysis was conducted, searching PubMed, Web of Science and Google Scholar. We included controlled clinical trials investigating the effects of stretching or strengthening on spinal and lumbopelvic posture (e.g., pelvic tilt, lumbar lordosis, thoracic kyphosis, head tilt) in healthy individuals. Effect sizes were pooled using robust variance estimation. To rate the certainty about the evidence, the GRADE approach was applied. RESULTS: A total of 23 studies with 969 participants were identified. Neither acute (d = 0.01, p = 0.97) nor chronic stretching (d=-0.19, p = 0.16) had an impact on posture. Chronic strengthening was associated with large improvements (d=-0.83, p = 0.01), but no study examined acute effects. Strengthening was superior (d = 0.81, p = 0.004) to stretching. Sub-analyses found strengthening to be effective in the thoracic and cervical spine (d=-1.04, p = 0.005) but not in the lumbar and lumbopelvic region (d=-0.23, p = 0.25). Stretching was ineffective in all locations (p > 0.05). CONCLUSION: Moderate-certainty evidence does not support the use of stretching as a treatment of muscle imbalance. In contrast, therapists should focus on strengthening programs targeting weakened muscles."

      "abstract": "Fish transport workers in Indonesia lift loads more than the specified limits, both in weight and frequency. This could cause lactic acid accumulation, fatigue and reduced physical performance. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of stretching intervention on muscle tension, fatigue, strength, and lactic acid level in fish transport workers in Indonesia. A pre-experimental study design with one group (pre- and post-test) design was conducted among male fish transport workers at the Tawang fish auction, Weleri, Central Java, Indonesia, in June 2022 for two weeks. We created a 1.5-minute stretching exercise video based on the University of New Castle's Manual Handling guideline, involving hand, feet, and shoulder movements. Participants performed these exercises independently before and during work every two hours, guided by the video. Data on lactic acid, muscle tension, fatigue, and strength were collected before and after the 2-week intervention. Data analysis was performed using Wilcoxon and paired Student t-tests to compare the outcome between post- and pre-intervention. A total of 18 fish transport workers were included in the study. The results showed a statistically significant increase in lactic acid levels following the intervention (p=0.016). However, the increase in muscle tension was not statistically significant (p=0.292). There was a significant increase in fatigue levels after the intervention (p=0.000). This could suggest that the stretching intervention may have had an unintended effect of increasing fatigue among the participants. On the other hand, there was a statistically significant decrease in muscle strength after the intervention (p=0.003). In conclusion, this study suggests that while stretching exercises can affect lactic acid accumulation, fatigue, and muscle strength, they do not influence muscle tension. Therefore, it is advised for workers to incorporate stretching exercises into their daily routine to mitigate potential injury risks.",

AIMS: This study investigates brain activity in adults with cerebral palsy during painful and non-painful stretching to elucidate their pain processing characteristics. METHODS AND PROCEDURES: Twenty adults with cerebral palsy and 20 controls underwent EEG in three conditions: rest, non-painful stretching, and painful stretching. Time-frequency power density of theta, alpha, and beta waves in somatosensory and frontal cortices was analyzed, alongside baseline pressure pain thresholds. OUTCOMES AND RESULTS: Cerebral palsy individuals exhibited higher theta, alpha, and beta power density in both cortices during painful stretching compared to rest, and lower during non-painful stretching. Controls showed higher power density during non-painful stretching but lower during painful stretching. Cerebral palsy individuals had higher pain sensitivity, with those more sensitive experiencing greater alpha power density. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: These findings confirm alterations in the cerebral processing of pain in individuals with cerebral palsy. This knowledge could enhance future approaches to the diagnosis and treatment of pain in this vulnerable population.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The effect of percussion massage on hamstring flexibility is unknown. This study aimed to investigate the acute effects of percussion massage on hamstring flexibility and to compare its effectiveness with static stretching. METHODS: Fifty-four healthy individuals aged 18-25 years with at least 15 degrees of active knee extension were included in the study. The study was conducted between February and May 2022. The participants were randomly divided into 3 groups in this cross-randomization study as percussion massage (n=18), static stretching (n=18), and control (n=18). The Active Knee Extension test and the Sit and Reach test were used as evaluation parameters, and assessments were performed pre-intervention and 30 min post-intervention (acute). RESULTS: In both percussion and stretching intervention groups, the range of motion (ROM) gain in the Active Knee Extension test was statistically significant (p<0.05) compared to the control group. Active knee extension angle gain was similar between percussion and stretching interventions (p>0.05). It was found that hamstring flexibility improved significantly in both percussion massage and static stretching groups (p<0.05). However, considering the last measurement and flexibility gain values, it was found that percussion massage and static stretching had similar acute effects on hamstring muscle flexibility (p>0.05). CONCLUSION: Percussion massage had an acute positive effect on hamstring flexibility and ROM, and it was as effective as static stretching. Therefore, percussion massage devices are recommended as part of pre-exercise in a structured warm-up for increase in joint range of motion and flexibility.",

OBJECTIVE: To compare the effects of static stretching and Pilates stretching on the concentric muscle strength of the knee extensors and flexors. METHOD: 102 trained young adults were randomized into three groups: static stretching (n = 33); Pilates stretching (n = 34); control (n = 35). Isokinetic evaluation of the knee extensor and flexor muscles was performed at 60°/s and 180°/s, pre and post acute intervention with stretching. Interventions in the static stretching and Pilates stretching groups occurred in 3 sets x 30 s for each body region considered (a-knee extensor muscles; b-knee flexor muscles). The control group did not perform any intervention. RESULTS: No difference (p > 0.05) was observed between the groups after the intervention. There was only a significant intragroup improvement for the control group on the isokinetic muscle strength of the knee flexors at 180°/s, with a moderate effect size, considering the entire sample (p = 0.040; d = 0.42) and when considering only male gender (p = 0.010; d = 0.60). CONCLUSION: Static stretching or Pilates stretching performed as a warm-up did not impair or enhance the concentric muscle strength performance of the knee extensors and flexors. In this way, both forms of stretching can be considered as preparatory exercises before muscle strength training.",

Methods: Fourteen participants with plantar fasciitis were divided into a simple massage ball group (group A, n = 8) and an application-linked massage ball group (group B, n = 6). The application-linked massage ball sends information regarding the massages, such as the frequency and force of the massage on the foot, to the application on the patient's smartphone. All clinical outcomes were evaluated at the beginning of the study and 1-, 2-, and 3-month follow-up. The primary outcome measure was the Manchester-Oxford Foot Questionnaire (MOXFQ) score. Results: At the beginning of the study, the initial MOXFQ score was not significantly different between the two groups (p = 0.948). At each time point, the MOXFQ score of the whole population did not improve significantly compared to that of the initial state (p = 0.131). Generalized estimating equation modeling demonstrated that there was no significant difference in the improvement of the MOXFQ score between groups A and B during follow-up (p = 0.826). In addition, no group-by-time interactions were observed (p = 0.457). Conclusions: The efficacy of an application-linked massage ball for the treatment of plantar fasciitis was not as definite as that of a traditional simple stretching ball in patients whose symptoms persisted for at least six months. Future studies that include patients with acute plantar fasciitis are required."

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: Research supports physical activity as a method to heighten stress resistance and resilience through positive metabolic alterations mostly affecting the neuroendocrine system. High-intensity interval training (HIIT) has been proposed as a highly effective time-saving method to induce those changes. However, existing literature relies heavily on cross-sectional analyses, with few randomised controlled trials highlighting the necessity for more exercise interventions. Thus, this study aims to investigate the effects of HIIT versus an active control group on the stress response to an acute psychosocial stressor in emotionally impulsive humans (suggested as being strong stress responders). METHODS: The study protocol was registered online (DRKS00016589) before data collection. Sedentary, emotionally impulsive adults (30.69 ± 8.20 y) were recruited for a supervised intervention of 8 weeks and randomly allocated to either a HIIT (n = 25) or a stretching group (n = 19, acting as active controls). Participants were submitted to a test battery, including saliva samples, questionnaires (self-efficacy- and perceived stress-related), visual analogue scales (physical exercise- and stress-related), and resting electroencephalography and electrocardiography assessing their reaction to an acute psychological stressor (Trier Social Stress Test) before and after the exercise intervention. RESULTS: HIIT increased aerobic fitness in all participants, whereas stretching did not. Participants from the HIIT group reported perceiving exercising more intensively than those from the active control group (ƞp2 = 0.108, p = 0.038). No further group differences were detected. Both interventions largely increased levels of joy post-TSST (ƞp2 = 0.209, p = 0.003) whilst decreasing tension (ƞp2 = 0.262, p < 0.001) and worries (ƞp2 = 0.113, p = 0.037). Finally, both interventions largely increased perceived levels of general self-efficacy (ƞp2 = 0.120, p = 0.029). CONCLUSION: This study suggests that 8 weeks of HIIT does not change the psychoneuroendocrine response to an acute psychological stress test compared to an active control group in emotionally impulsive humans. Further replications of supervised exercise studies highly powered with active and passive controls are warranted.",

The purpose of this study was to assess the effects of adding thoracic manipulation to PGM and sleeper stretches on passive range of motion (PROM), joint mobility, and infraspinatus electromyographic (EMG) activity in shoulders with decreased internal rotation (IR) PROM. DESIGN: Randomized Sequential Intervention Laboratory Study. METHODS: Forty individuals with clinically significant IR loss attended two study sessions. Participants were randomized to receive five 30 seconds bouts of either grade III PGM or sleeper stretching. Following a seven-day washout period, all participants attended a second session and received a prescriptive supine HVLA manipulation targeting the T3-4 segment, followed by the previously randomized intervention. Outcome measures included internal rotation PROM, horizontal adduction PROM, posterior glenohumeral joint translation assessed via ultrasound imaging, and EMG activity of the infraspinatus during a PGM. All outcome measures were assessed pre- and immediately post-intervention and compared statistically. RESULTS: There were significant within-group, but not between-group, differences for IR and horizontal adduction PROM following a single session of PGM or sleeper stretch. When combined with thoracic manipulation, significantly smaller within session changes of IR PROM were observed for both PGM (mean difference 4.4, p=0.017) and sleeper stretches (mean difference 6.4, p=0.0005). There were no significant between group differences for horizontal adduction PROM, humeral head translation, or EMG activity across all time points. DISCUSSION: Both GH posterior mobilizations and sleeper stretches improved IR and horizontal adduction PROM in a single session. The addition of thoracic manipulation prior to local shoulder interventions resulted in smaller gains of both IR and horizontal adduction ROM. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level 2."

      "abstract": "AIM: Previous stretching studies mostly investigated effects on the skeletal muscle but comprehensive explorations regarding the role of the connective tissue are scarce. Since the deep fascia has been demonstrated to be sensitive to mechanical tension, it was hypothesized that the fascia would also respond to stretching, contributing to enhanced range of motion (ROM). METHODS: Forty (40) recreationally active participants (male: n = 25, female: n = 15) were included in the randomized controlled cross-over trial and allocated to different groups performing 5 min static (STAT) or dynamic (DYN) plantar flexor stretching or control condition (CC) in a random order. Pre- and immediately post-intervention, muscle and fascia stiffness, as well as muscle and fascia thickness were measured using high-resolution ultrasound and strain elastography. ROM was assessed in the ankle joint via the knee to wall test (KtW) and goniometer. RESULTS: STAT reduced both, muscle and fascia stiffness (d = 0.78 and 0.42, p < 0.001, respectively), while DYN did not reduce stiffness compared to the control condition (p = 0.11-0.41). While both conditions showed significant increases in the KtW (d = 0.43-0.46, p = 0.02-0.04), no significant differences to the CC were observed for the isolated ROM testing (p = 0.09 and 0.77). There was a small correlation between fascia stiffness decreases and ROM increases (r = - 0.25, p = 0.006) but no association was found between muscle stiffness decreases and ROM increases (p = 0.13-0.40). CONCLUSION: Our study is the first to reveal stretch-induced changes in fascia stiffness. Changes of fascia`s but not muscle`s mechanical properties may contribute to increased ROM following stretching.",

It is reported in the literature that high-volume stretching improves pectoralis muscles strength under supervised conditions while practical relevance is discussed. Therefore, the study objective was to compare the effects of volume equated, supervised- and self-administered home-based stretching on strength performance. METHODS: Sixty-three recreational participants were equally assigned to either a supervised static stretching, home-based stretching, or control group. The effects of 15 min pectoralis stretching, 4 days per week for 8 weeks, were assessed on dynamic and isometric bench press strength and force development. RESULTS: While there was a large magnitude maximal strength increase (p < 0.001-0.023, ƞ2 = 0.118-0.351), force development remained unaffected. Dynamic maximal strength in both groups demonstrated large magnitude increases compared to the control group (p < 0.001-0.001, d = 1.227-0.905). No differences between the intervention group for maximal strength (p = 0.518-0.821, d = 0.101-0.322) could be detected. CONCLUSIONS: The results could potentially be attributed to stretch-induced tension (mechanical overload) with subsequent anabolic adaptations, and alternative explanatory approaches are discussed. Nevertheless, home-based stretching seems a practical alternative to supervised training with potential meaningful applications in different settings."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Historically, in-person physical therapy serves as a foundational component of nonoperative treatment of adhesive capsulitis (AC). This study compares the effectiveness of an at-home high-intensity stretch (HIS) device to traditional physical therapy (PT) and to PT in combination with the HIS device. We hypothesize that the HIS device will be as effective as PT alone or as combination therapy in the first-line treatment of AC and use of the HIS device will exhibit improvement at higher rate. METHODS: Thirty-four patients with idiopathic adhesive capsulitis and a minimum of 12 months follow-up were included in this study. Patients were randomized into one of the three groups: HIS device, PT alone, or HIS device + PT. Passive range of motion (ROM), American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES), and Simple Shoulder Test (SST) scores were measured. Additionally, patient satisfaction, compliance and complications were recorded. Paired t-test, ANOVA and Chi-squared tests were used in analysis. RESULTS: Final ROM in all planes improved for all groups compared to baseline (p < 0.001), with only HIS device group able to restore > 95% of contralateral ROM in all planes at final follow-up. Patients with PT alone were on average slowest to improve ROM from baseline, at 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year in all planes except internal rotation. ASES and SST scores improved for all groups when compared to baseline (p < 0.001). Use of HIS-device resulted in greater improvement in SST and ASES Total scores compared to PT alone (p = 0.045, and p = 0.048, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Use of an at-home high-intensity stretching device for conservative treatment of idiopathic adhesive capsulitis improves outcomes in ROM and in ASES and SST scores both when used as an adjunct to physical therapy and when used alone. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The study protocol was registered at www. CLINICALTRIALS: gov (20/05/2022, NCT05384093).",
