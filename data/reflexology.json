      "abstract": "Objective: This study was conducted to examine the effects of massage and foot reflexology on the sleep of premature infants. Materials and Methods: The research was designed as a randomized controlled experimental study. The study population consisted of premature infants born at 30-37 weeks of gestation who were admitted to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit of a hospital in the Central Anatolia Region. The sample included 108 premature infants divided into three groups: Massage group (n = 36), Foot reflexology group (n = 36), and Control group (n = 36). Data were collected using a neonatal follow-up form and actigraphy. Massage and foot reflexology interventions were administered to the respective groups twice daily (Morning: 07:00-09:00 and Evening: 19:00-21:00) for 15 minutes each session over two consecutive days, making up a total of four sessions. The control group received routine nursing care without any additional intervention. Pre-test (once) and post-test (once) measurements of 24-h sleep durations were assessed using actigraphy for all groups. Results: Sleep duration in the massage group increased compared to pre-intervention (251 minutes) and the control group (272 minutes), while the sleep duration in the foot reflexology group similarly increased compared to pre-intervention (268 minutes) and the control group (266 minutes) (p < .001). Sleep efficiency also showed a significant increase post-intervention, rising to 73% in the massage group and 71.8% in the foot reflexology group compared to the control group (p < .001). Furthermore, the number of awakenings and wakefulness duration significantly decreased in the massage and foot reflexology groups compared to the control group (p < .05). Conclusion: The findings indicate that massage and foot reflexology are effective non-pharmacological methods for improving sleep duration and sleep efficiency while reducing wakefulness duration and the number of awakenings in premature infants."

      "abstract": "Introduction: In recent years, foot reflexology has been frequently used as a method to solve problems such as stress, pain, and depression. It has been observed that the studies focused on the effect of foot reflexology on the pregnancy and birth process. Research Aim: A meta-analysis of experimental trials evaluating the effectiveness of foot reflexology applied in the postpartum period on comfort and breastfeeding outcomes was conducted in the present study. Materials and Methods: A comprehensive electronic search was done through the PubMed, WoS, Wiley, ScienceDirect, Scopus, and Google Scholar databases to identify experimental articles. There was no time restriction when searching the database. The risk of bias was assessed using the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) critical appraisal checklist for quasi-experimental studies and the Cochrane risk of bias tool for randomized trials. The meta-analysis was conducted using Comprehensive Meta-Analysis. Cochran's Q test and Higgins' I2 were used to assess study heterogeneity. Results: Three studies, two randomized controlled trials and one quasi-experimental trial (n = 260), were included in the analysis. Foot reflexology applied to postpartum women was found to have positive effects on the LATCH (standardized mean difference [SMD]: 1.010, confidence interval [CI]: 0.752/1.269, Z = 7.664, p = 0.000), Visual Analogue Scale (VAS)-breast tension (SMD: 2.212, CI: 1.902/2.522, Z = 13.981, p = 0.000), VAS-breast heat (SMD: 2.240, CI: 1.928/2.552, Z = 14.086, p = 0.000), VAS-breast pain (SMD: 2.302, CI: 1.836/2.768, Z = 9.686, p = 0.000), postpartum comfort (SMD: 3.578, CI: 3.131/4.025, Z = 15.689, p = 0.000), and breastfeeding satisfaction (SMD: 1.492, CI: 1.178/1.806, Z = 9.318, p = 0.000) scores. Conclusions: This meta-analysis determined that the foot reflexology intervention increased breastfeeding success, satisfaction, and postpartum comfort levels and statistically significantly reduced the signs of breastfeeding onset."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Traditional foot reflexology impacts autonomic function by applying pressure to the foot. However, evidence of walking on foot reflexology path and its influence on autonomic function was limited. PRIMARY STUDY OBJECTIVE: The study aimed to ascertain whether walking on a foot reflexology path was feasible and how this would affect autonomic function. METHODS: This was a randomized, counterbalanced, open-label crossover trial. 24 healthy volunteers recruited, aged 18 - 26 years, were randomly assigned into 2 groups (n = 12 in each). After a washout period of 2 days, they switched to receive the opposite phase of intervention. SETTING: A holistic health centre in southern India. INTERVENTION: Walking on a foot reflexology path or walking on a plain surface for 15 minutes. OUTCOME MEASURES: Measures include feasibility, blood pressure, and heart rate variability. Participants were assessed at baseline, during walking, and 5 minutes after intervention. RESULTS: All participants completed the study with no adverse events, indicating the feasibility of the study. Participants were comfortable walking without any deviation in the horizontal and vertical accelerometry. There was a significant decrease in mean RR interval and percentage of differences between adjacent normal heartbeats that are greater than 50 milliseconds during walking on foot reflexology path and walking on plain surface compared to pre-intervention values (P < .05). At post-intervention, a significant increase in mean RR and percentage of differences between adjacent normal heartbeats that are greater than 50 milliseconds (P < .05) was noted, along with a significant decrease in heart rate, systolic blood pressure, and diastolic blood pressure only after walking on reflexology path when compared with pre-intervention values (P < .05). CONCLUSION: The findings indicate that walking on foot reflexology path is feasible and potentially helps to regulate cardiac vagal tone by reducing blood pressure and increasing heart rate variability compared to walking on plain surface."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVE: Colonoscopy is a standard diagnostic procedure, yet pre-procedural anxiety remains a prevalent concern. While pharmacological interventions are available, non-pharmacological approaches such as reflexology offer a promising alternative. Despite its therapeutic potential, comparative evidence on foot and hand reflexology in this setting is limited. This study aimed to evaluate their effects on pre-colonoscopy anxiety and physiological parameters. METHODS: This randomized clinical study was conducted from November 2022 to August 2023 at the Amir al-Momenin Educational and Therapeutic Center in Arak, Iran. A total of 105 patients were randomly assigned to three equal-sized groups (n = 35) using block randomization: foot reflexology, hand reflexology, and a control group. Patients in the intervention groups received a 30-min reflexology session. Anxiety levels were assessed using the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-Y1), a validated tool for measuring situational anxiety. Physiological indices, including systolic and diastolic blood pressure, heart rate, and arterial oxygen saturation (SpO2), were measured immediately before and after the intervention. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in clinical outcomes among the groups at baseline (p > 0.05). However, following the intervention, the mean anxiety scores in both reflexology groups (foot reflexology: 44.39 ± 5.21; hand reflexology: 45.6 ± 4.49) were significantly lower than that of the control group (48.05 ± 4.81) (p = 0.008), as determined by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). The anxiety reduction was more pronounced in the foot reflexology group than the hand reflexology group, although this difference did not reach statistical significance (p > 0.05). Additionally, post-intervention assessments revealed significant differences in systolic blood pressure (foot reflexology: 123.48 ± 16.40 mmHg; hand reflexology: 122.65 ± 14.97 mmHg; control group: 132.14 ± 18.48 mmHg) and heart rate (foot reflexology: 78.60 ± 9.54 bpm; hand reflexology: 78.25 ± 11.41 bpm; control group: 85.05 ± 10.82 bpm) across the groups (p < 0.05). However, no significant differences were observed for diastolic blood pressure or arterial oxygen saturation (SPO2) between groups (p > 0.05). CONCLUSION: The findings of this study indicate that reflexology, particularly foot reflexology, can significantly reduce anxiety and lead to improvements in physiological parameters, such as systolic blood pressure and heart rate, in patients undergoing colonoscopy. These results highlight the potential of reflexology as an effective complementary method for managing anxiety and enhancing patient comfort during medical procedures."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Sexual health is an essential part of women's lives at different ages. Pregnancy, childbirth, and breastfeeding can affect women's sexual function by inducing biological, psychological, and social changes. Due to the prevalence of sexual dysfunction in lactating women and the effects of reflexology therapies on it, this study was conducted to investigate the effect of foot reflexology on the sexual function of lactating women. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This randomized clinical trial was conducted in selected health centers of Isfahan in 2022 on 64 lactating women (32 women in each group of intervention and control). The samples were selected using the convenience sampling method and were randomly divided into two groups with a random number table. Each participant in the intervention group received 10 sessions of foot reflexology, and each session lasted for 50 minutes (25 minutes for each foot) and was held every three days. The female sexual function index (FSFI) questionnaire was completed before the intervention and four weeks after the end of it. The control group received routine care and completed the questionnaire before the intervention and 9 weeks later. Data were analyzed using SPSS version 20 and independent/paired t-tests. RESULTS: Data analysis showed that the subjects of the two groups were homogeneous in demographic and fertility characteristics at the beginning of the study. The total mean score of sexual function in the intervention group was 20.36 ± 4.16 before the intervention and 28.05 ± 2.89 after the intervention. In the control group, this score was 20.51 ± 3.75 before the intervention and 20.54 ± 3.71 nine weeks after it. A comparison of the total mean score of sexual function and dimensions showed a significant difference between the two groups four weeks after the intervention (p <0.001). In the intervention group, significant changes were observed in the total mean score of sexual function and its dimensions four weeks after the intervention compared to before the intervention. However, in the control group, there were no significant changes in this score and its dimensions nine weeks later compared to before the intervention. CONCLUSION: Based on the results of this study, lactating women in the two groups did not have a desirable sexual function before the intervention. However, foot reflexology in the present study could effectively improve the sexual function of women in the reflexology group. Therefore, it is recommended to employ foot reflexology therapy in health centers to help lactating women restore their sexual function."

      "abstract": "This editorial critically evaluates the application of foot reflexology as a treatment for sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) in infants, as proposed in a case report published in the World of Clinical Cases. SNHL is a condition characterized by damage to the cochlea or the neural pathways that transmit auditory information to the brain. The etiology of SNHL is often complex, involving genetic mutations, prenatal factors, or perinatal insults. Reflexology, an alternative therapy involving the application of pressure to specific points on the feet, is based on the hypothesis that these points correspond to different organs and systems in the body, including the auditory system. However, the biological plausibility and clinical efficacy of foot reflexology in addressing SNHL lack empirical support. This editorial examines the pathophysiology of SNHL, assesses the clinical claims of reflexology practitioners, and emphasizes the necessity of evidence-based approaches in treating infant hearing loss. While complementary therapies may provide ancillary benefits, they should not supplant validated medical treatments in managing SNHL in infants. Further research is needed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of foot reflexology and other alternative therapies in pediatric audiology."

      "abstract": "AIM: This study aimed to review massage, acupressure and reflexology interventions applied to haemodialysis patients with restless legs syndrome and to examine the effects of these interventions on sleep quality. DESIGN: A systematic review and meta-analysis. DATA SOURCES: A systematic literature search was conducted on databases ScienceDirect, Web of Science, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, EBSCO and PubMed. METHODS: The Modified Jadad scale was used. The statistical analysis was conducted using the Stata 15.0 software, with the aim of evaluating heterogeneity between studies using both chi-square and I2 statistics. The risk of bias in the included studies was assessed using both the Cochrane risk of bias assessment tool and statistical tests. A funnel plot was used to detect potential publication bias, which is indicated by an asymmetry in the plot. The Egger regression test was also performed to evaluate publication bias. RESULTS: Twelve studies were selected for the meta-analysis. All studies included in this meta-analysis were of good quality. In the subgroup analysis, it was determined that massage and acupressure reduced the severity of restless legs syndrome as a result of the intervention, while reflexology had no effect. Interventions did not affect the sleep quality of patients. Restless legs syndrome severity was significantly reduced in studies using oil and in studies that intervened for more than 15 min per session. CONCLUSION: Interventions applied to haemodialysis patients with restless legs syndrome can reduce the severity of restless legs syndrome. It is recommended to conduct randomised controlled trials that determine the effects of methods on restless legs syndrome severity and sleep quality in haemodialysis patients.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Patients with leukemia undergoing bone marrow aspiration (BMA) frequently experience considerable pain and anxiety, which may negatively impact physiological outcomes. Reflexology, a complementary therapeutic approach, has demonstrated effectiveness in reducing pain and anxiety across various medical procedures. This randomized clinical trial aimed to evaluate the impact of foot reflexology on pain, anxiety, and physiological indices in leukemia patients undergoing BMA. METHODS: This randomized clinical trial was conducted at Ayatollah Khansari Hospital in Arak between August 2021 and January 2023. Patients were randomly assigned to either a reflexology intervention group or a control group receiving routine care. The intervention group underwent a 30-min foot reflexology session. Pain was assessed using the Numeric Rating Scale (NRS), and anxiety levels were measured via the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI). Physiological indices, including systolic and diastolic blood pressure, heart rate, and arterial oxygen saturation, were measured before and after the intervention. RESULTS: Of the 72 patients, 68 completed the study (intervention: n = 35, control: n = 33). Post-intervention, the intervention group showed a significant reduction in systolic (p = 0.017) and diastolic blood pressure (p = 0.028), while the control group experienced no significant changes. Heart rate significantly increased in the control group (p = 0.030), but no significant change was observed in the intervention group (p = 0.977). Anxiety levels significantly decreased in the intervention group (p < 0.001), with a notable between-group difference (p = 0.006). Pain intensity was also significantly lower in the intervention group compared to the control group (p = 0.034). CONCLUSION: Foot reflexology is an effective intervention for reducing pain and anxiety in leukemia patients undergoing BMA. Reflexology may be considered a valuable, non-invasive supportive therapy for managing procedural pain and anxiety in oncology settings."

Acupuncture and foot reflexology, two alternative therapies rooted in traditional Chinese medicine, have gained recognition for their potential to address sleep issues and alleviate associated symptoms. METHODS: This single blinded, three-groups randomized controlled trial was navigated at Tohid Hospital, involving 132 leukemia patients divided into acupuncture (n = 44), foot reflexology (n = 44), and control (n = 44) groups via random card selection. All patients completed a demographic questionnaire and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) before the intervention. The acupuncture group received routine care along with twice-daily acupuncture at the SP6 point for four successive weeks. Reflexology group had daily ten-minute sittings for the same weeks using sweet almond oil on their feet. Control group continued by only routine cares. Post-intervention assessments were conducted using the same instruments after four weeks. RESULTS: The study analyzed patient demographics, finding no significant gender differences and a majority of high school graduates. All groups had similar proportions of singles, high employment rates, and urban residency. Average ages were comparable, with no significant pre-intervention sleep quality differences found. However, both acupuncture and reflexology groups showed significant improvements post-intervention, unlike the control group. While both interventions resulted in lower sleep quality scores compared to the control, no significant difference was observed between the acupuncture and reflexology groups. Trends indicated slight reductions in fatigue for the intervention groups, suggesting both therapies effectively improved sleep quality. CONCLUSION: Acupuncture and foot reflexology are suggested as simple and budget-friendly complementary methods that may improve sleep quality for those with leukemia. These therapies provide non-invasive methods to address sleep disturbances and improve overall well-being in leukemia patients.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Constipation is an important symptom that is common in patients using opioids and leads to major health problems among patients. Reflexology is one of the approaches utilized to manage constipation. OBJECTIVE: To examine the effect of reflexology socks on constipation in patients with opioid-induced constipation. METHODS: This study was designed as a single-blind, randomized, controlled experimental trial. The study was conducted with the participation of a total of 101 patients who were suffering from cancer and other noncancer diseases, using opioids, and complaining of constipation. The patients in the intervention group (n = 51) were advised to walk with reflexology socks for 4 weeks, whereas the patients in the control group (n = 50) were advised to walk only. RESULTS: It was found that the severity of opioid-induced constipation was lower in the intervention group than in the control group at the end of the fifth week ( P < .05). Additionally, after the application, the quality-of-life mean score was lower in the intervention group (mean, 48.46 ± 24.66) compared with control group (mean, 109.88 ± 10.62), and reflexology socks were effective in enhancing quality of life in the intervention group ( P < .05). CONCLUSIONS: This study concluded that reflexology socks were an effective approach to the management of constipation. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Reflexology socks may be more useful for patients to manage constipation because it is difficult to find a reflexologist, and reflexology sessions are charged and expensive. In this way, patients will wear reflexology socks comfortably and easily at home, and the severity of constipation will be alleviated."

With the advancement of modern medicine, we are increasingly committed to finding the specific physiological mechanisms of foot reflexes to treat diseases, thereby better proving the therapy's effectiveness. It has been reported that foot reflexes can activate the cerebral cortex and organs corresponding to the feet, stimulating blood flow, nutrition and nerves through neural and endocrine regulation to achieve the purpose of treating and preventing diseases and promoting health. The therapy shows unique potential and value, and provides a new perspective on integrating traditional medicine and modern medicine."

This study aimed to investigate the effect of foot reflexology on the volume and composition of breast milk in mothers of premature infants hospitalized in the neonatal intensive care unit. METHODS: This randomized clinical trial was conducted on 76 primiparous mothers whose premature infants up to 34 weeks were hospitalized in the neonatal intensive care unit of Ayatollah Rouhani Hospital from February 2023 to November 2023. Mothers in the intervention group received foot reflexology for 20 min on both feet (ten minutes per foot) for seven consecutive days every morning. On the first and seventh days of the study, both groups were compared in terms of milk volume (ml), triglycerides, cholesterol, albumin, total protein, and calcium (mg/dl). RESULTS: The mean difference in breast milk characteristics before and after the intervention in the control and intervention groups were as follows: in terms of breast milk volume 12.43 and 23.51 ml, triglyceride 418.37 and 406.21, cholesterol 5.48 and 3.67, albumin 1.02 and 0.35, total protein 1.89 and 4.59, calcium was -3.54 and -1.83 mg/dL; the net difference in breast milk volume in the intervention group compared to the control group increased, which was not statistically significant but was significant in terms of value. No significant difference was observed in other components of breast milk. CONCLUSION: In this single-center study, foot reflexology massage showed a trend towards increasing the volume of breast milk, total protein and calcium, although it was not statistically significant. Therefore, it needs further investigation. TRIAL REGISTRATION: IRCT, IRCT20221220056872N1. Registered 22 January 2023- prospective registered, https://irct.behdasht.gov.ir/trial/67512 .",

In this study, 497 articles were found, 4 were selected. 75% of the studies were based on the Ingham method of reflexology. The elements that demonstrate caring consciousness and enhance the healing effect of the therapy were foot grooming, use of essential oils, implementation of relaxation techniques, description of pressure points and combining other therapies. In 75% of the cases, foot reflexology was effective to reduce pain. Those authors who apply caring consciousness in the technique of reflexology obtained more significant results in the reduction of pain. The incorporation of external elements shows the intention of nursing to enhance the effects of the therapy, as well as the search for connection with the elderly."

PRIMARY STUDY OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to identify the effect of foot reflexology applied before chest tube removal on pain and anxiety levels in patients with coronary artery bypass graft surgery. METHODS/DESIGN: This study was a randomized controlled clinical trial. SETTING: This study was conducted in the cardiovascular surgery intensive care unit of the Baskent University Ankara Hospital. PARTICIPANTS: Patients, who underwent coronary artery bypass graft surgery, were randomly assigned either to the reflexology group or the control group (n = 28 individuals/group). INTERVENTION: The reflexology group received foot reflexology for 30 minutes in two sessions (first postoperative day and before chest tube removal). PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcomes of the surgery were pain, evaluated using a Numeric Pain-Rating Scale; and anxiety, evaluated using the Profile of Mood States Scale Tension-Anxiety Subscale. Pain and anxiety were determined on the first (before and after the reflexology) and second postoperative days (before and after the reflexology and immediately, 15 min, 1 hour (only pain level) after chest tube removal). RESULTS: The mean pain scores of the control and intervention groups were similar during chest tube removal, 15 minutes after, and 1 hour after (P > .05). Although mean anxiety scores were comparable after chest tube removal in both groups (P > .05), a significant difference was found 15 minutes later (P < .05). The increase in pain (P = .0001) and anxiety (P = .032) levels before and after the removal was significantly less in the intervention group compared to the control group, based on pain and anxiety scores. CONCLUSION: Foot reflexology significantly reduced the increase in pain and anxiety during chest tube removal in patients with coronary artery bypass graft surgery.",

METHODS: This study was conducted as a single blinded randomized placebo-controlled parallel-group trial. Data were collected using the \"Demographic Characteristics Form\", \"Richards-Campbell Sleep Scale\", \"State-Trait Anxiety Inventory\" and \"Nottingham Health Profile\". Individuals in the reflexology and placebo groups received massages for three weeks; three times a week, for 15 minutes on each foot. Participants in the reflexology and placebo groups were followed-up before the massage and after the ninth massage session. RESULTS: In the statistical evaluation of the sleep quality scale mean scores, after the ninth massage session, it was determined that the average sleep score of the reflexology massage group was higher than that of the placebo group. Additionally, the state anxiety level was found to be lower in the reflexology group compared to the placebo group. As for the quality of life after the ninth massage session, it was determined that there was an improvement in the reflexology massage group compared to the placebo group. CONCLUSIONS: This study has found that foot reflexology massage is effective in reducing anxiety levels, improving sleep, and enhancing the quality of life in patients undergoing hemodialysis treatment. The findings of this study may offer nurses greater awareness of the potential benefits of reflexology. In this way, more healthcare professionals can be encouraged to use reflexology in addition to other cares.",

Implementing non-invasive, non-pharmacological, and inexpensive complementary practices can benefit both the child and their family. Aim This study aimed to evaluate the impact of foot reflexology versus simple massage on vital signs, anxiety, and pain induced by blood transfusions in children with thalassemia. Materials and methods  An experimental study was conducted on 60 children with thalassemia; children aged 2-13 years were selected by systematic random sampling. The participants were separated into two groups: 30 children received foot reflexology and 30 children received a simple massage. Data were collected using a self-structured demographic profile, vital signs record sheet, standard Observational Scale of Behavioral Distress-Revised (OSBD-R) scale, and visual analog scale (VAS). Paired and unpaired t-tests were used to evaluate the effects of the interventions. The chi-square test was utilized to evaluate the relationship between demographic and dependent variables. Result Foot reflexology showed a significant difference (P < 0.05) in systolic and diastolic blood pressure and a highly significant difference (P < 0.0001) in anxiety and pain. The simple massage group showed a significant effect on temperature, anxiety, and pain. Both groups demonstrated a significant impact (P < 0.05) on systolic blood pressure and pain after the intervention. Conclusion  Most children were diagnosed with thalassemia during infancy, had a history of both parent's thalassemia minor, and were Rh+ve. Foot reflexology was more effective in reducing anxiety and pain than simple massage. Additionally, foot reflexology had a significant effect on systolic and diastolic blood pressure, while simple massage significantly affected temperature in children with thalassemia."

This study seeks to examine and compare the respective impacts of warm foot baths and foot reflexology on depression in patients undergoing radiotherapy. METHODS: A randomized clinical trial was conducted at Mashhad University of Medical Sciences in Iran in 2019, following CONSORT guidelines. Participants included non-metastatic cancer patients aged 18-60 undergoing a 28-day radiotherapy course. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either warm footbaths or foot reflexology as interventions, performed daily for 20 min over 21 days. The data were analyzed using appropriate statistical tests. RESULTS: Statistical analysis indicated no significant differences in demographic attributes between the two groups. Both interventions led to a significant reduction in depression scores post-treatment compared to pre-treatment assessments. Foot reflexology showed a greater reduction in depression scores compared to footbaths with warm water. CONCLUSIONS: Both warm footbaths and foot reflexology are effective in alleviating depression in patients undergoing radiotherapy, with foot reflexology showing a greater impact on improving depression levels. The study recommends foot reflexology as a preferred intervention for managing depression in these patients if conditions and facilities permit."

This review aims to comprehensively evaluate the potential of plantar reflexology as a complementary approach for managing headaches. METHODS: Employing a systematic approach, databases were scoured for studies on plantar reflexology's efficacy in headache management. From 23 initial contenders, three studies meeting the inclusion criteria, two randomized controlled trials and a pilot study, were examined for treatment efficacy and quality. RESULTS: Our review highlights three primary studies, collectively indicating a significant enhancement in treatment efficacy within the plantar reflexology groups when compared to control groups. These findings suggest that plantar reflexology exhibits potential as an effective complementary therapy for managing headaches. However, in light of these promising results, a more cautious approach is advisable. There is a pressing need for more rigorous and high-quality research to substantiate these outcomes in real-world contexts and applications. CONCLUSION: Plantar reflexology emerges as an option within the field of headache management. While its efficacy is promising, the specific mechanisms behind its action require further investigation. Positioned among a range of treatment modalities, plantar reflexology distinguishes itself as a safe and non-invasive alternative. This review underscores the necessity for additional research, encouraging the scientific community to delve into this intriguing avenue for headache relief and expand our comprehension of its potential advantages."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy of foot reflexology and Benson's relaxation on anxiety and physiologic parameters after cesarean surgery. DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial with three parallel arms. SETTING: Gynecologic ward of the Persian Gulf Martyrs Hospital in Bushehr, Iran, in 2020. PARTICIPANTS AND INTERVENTIONS: Women undergoing cesarean surgery (n = 135) were selected by convenience sampling and divided via block randomization into three groups of foot reflexology, Benson's relaxation interventions, and control group (n = 45 in each group). Interventions were performed 2 hours after cesarean surgery. MEASUREMENTS: Spielberger's State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, mercury sphygmomanometer, and pulse oximeter were used to collect the data. Anxiety was measured before and 30 minutes after the intervention. Physiologic parameters were measured before the intervention and immediately, 30 minutes, and 60 minutes after the intervention. Data were analyzed using inferential statistics. RESULTS: The mean score of situational anxiety after the intervention was significantly lower than before the intervention in the reflexology (t = 6.171; 95% confidence interval [CI] [5.66, 11.14]) and Benson's relaxation groups (t = 7.362; 95% CI [5.91, 9.85]). However, changes in the control group were not significant (t = 1.674; 95% CI [-0.24, 2.55]). Decreases in anxiety scores were similar in the two intervention groups. After intervention, in most measurement times, respiratory rate and pulse rate decreased in the two intervention groups compared to the control group, and arterial oxygen saturation and systolic blood pressure increased. CONCLUSION: Considering the effect of both interventions on decreasing anxiety and improving most physiologic parameters, it seems that foot reflexology and Benson's relaxation can be recommended after cesarean surgery.",

METHODS: The study was conducted with intensive care unit nurses at two hospitals in a city between September 2022 and April 2023. The study sample consisted of 42 nurses, 21 of whom had low back pain for at least 3 months and 21 of whom were controls. In the study, foot reflexology was applied to the intervention group for 20 minutes (10 minutes on each foot) once a week for 4 weeks. There was no intervention applied to the control group. Data were collected using the Personal Information Form, the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS), and the Visual Analog Scale (VAS). FINDINGS: Based on the change in the mean scores of the scale in the intervention and control groups over time, a statistically significant decrease was found between the pre-test (before foot reflexology) and post-test mean scores of the LBP-VAS (from 6.33 to 2.24, respectively) and the Fatigue Severity Scale (from 4.81 to 3.60, respectively) in the intervention group. Although there was no statistically significant difference between the perceived stress scale pre-test and post-test scores, it was found that there was a decrease in favor of the intervention group. CONCLUSION: Foot reflexology appears to offer promise as an effective method for ICU nurses to reduce lower back pain and fatigue.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Among leukemia patients, sleep disruptions are prevalent and can profoundly affect their overall quality of life. Acupressure and foot reflexology, modalities rooted in traditional Chinese medicine, have garnered attention for their potential to address sleep disturbances and mitigate associated symptoms. METHODS: This research utilized a randomized controlled trial with a pretest-posttest design involving 102 leukemia patients admitted to Imam Khomeini Hospital in Urmia. Participants were randomly allocated to 3 groups: acupressure (n = 34), reflexology (n = 34), or control (n = 34). Prior to the intervention, patients completed a demographic survey and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) for baseline assessments. Acupressure involved stimulation of the SP6 point twice daily for 10 minutes over 4 weeks, while reflexology entailed daily 10-minute sessions with sweet almond oil on the soles for the same duration. The control group received standard care without additional interventions. Following the 4-week intervention period, post-intervention evaluations were conducted using identical measurement tools. RESULTS: The findings underscored the efficacy of both acupressure and foot reflexology in significantly improving sleep quality within the intervention groups (P < .001). Initially, there were no notable differences in sleep quality among the 3 groups (P > .05). Subsequently, pairwise comparisons adjusted with Bonferroni corrections revealed significant disparities in sleep quality between the acupressure and reflexology groups compared to the control group (P < .001). However, post-intervention analysis indicated no statistically significant variance in enhancing sleep quality between the acupressure and foot reflexology groups (P < .05). CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that acupressure and foot reflexology interventions can enhance sleep quality in individuals with leukemia. These findings support the effectiveness of these complementary modalities, offering targeted relief and relaxation. While these non-invasive therapies show promise in improving well-being, further research is needed to confirm and expand upon these results due to study limitations.",

Foot reflexology has been reported to affect hearing recovery, but no physiological evidence has been provided. This lack of evidence hampers the acceptance of the technique in clinical practice. CASE SUMMARY: A girl was taken to North Sichuan Medical University Affiliated Hospital for a hearing screen by her parents. Her parents reported that her hearing level was the same as when she was born. The girl was diagnosed with sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) by a doctor in the otolaryngology department. After we introduced the foot reflexology project, the parents agreed to participate in the experiment. After 6 months of foot reflexology treatment, the hearing threshold of the girl recovered to a normal level, below 30 dB. CONCLUSION: Foot reflexology should be encouraged in clinical practice and for families of infants with SNHL."

METHOD: In this randomized controlled trial with three arms and a pretest-posttest design, 102 CLL patients were randomly allocated to acupressure (n = 34), reflexology (n = 34), or control (n = 34) groups. Pre-intervention assessments were conducted using a demographic questionnaire and a fatigue scale for cancer patients. The acupressure group received routine care with acupressure targeting the SP6 point for 10 min twice daily over four weeks. The reflexology group received daily 10-minute reflexology sessions over four consecutive weeks following the preparation and lubrication of the soles of their feet with sweet almond oil. Post-intervention assessments were administered to all groups using the same instruments. RESULTS: Results showed both acupressure and reflexology significantly reduced fatigue compared to the control group (P < 0.001). While differences were noted between acupressure, reflexology, and control groups initially, the post-intervention analysis revealed no significant variance between acupressure and reflexology in reducing fatigue (P < 0.05), suggesting similar improvement between acupressure and reflexology. CONCLUSIONS: Acupressure and reflexology are recommended as cost-effective and low risk complementary approaches for managing fatigue in chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients.

Studies have shown that foot reflexology can help relieve these symptoms. The objective of this current study is to systematically review the effects of foot reflexology on patients with MS. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of published literature in many databases, including PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library, from January 1, 2000, to January 27, 2022. With language restrictions, we included randomized controlled trials of foot reflexology interventions for MS that had any clinical or psychological symptom measurements as outcomes. The Cochrane risk-of-bias tool was used to assess evidence quality. Two authors independently screened titles and abstracts. Potential eligible articles were retrieved for full-text review. A third author checked for excluded records. All discrepancies were resolved through a discussion among the 4 reviewing authors. RESULTS: A total of 154 studies were identified; 9 studies with 545 MS patients were included in this review. The most frequently reported findings of foot reflexology intervention in individuals with MS were reductions in fatigue, pain, muscle spasms, stiffness, and psychological symptoms and improvement in bowel and bladder functions and quality of life. CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that foot reflexology could be a safe and effective modality to reduce the physical and psychological symptoms and also improve the quality of life for individuals with MS; however, well-designed, large-scale trials are required to confirm the effect."

METHODS: This randomized clinical trial was conducted on 135 women undergoing a C/S in the Gynecology Ward of Bushehr Persian Gulf Martyrs Hospital in Bushehr, Iran, in 2020. The participants were selected using convenience sampling, and randomly divided into three groups of foot reflexology, Benson relaxation, and control. The interventions were performed two hours post-operation and six hours after the first intervention. The pain score was measured and recorded immediately, and 30 and 60 minutes after each intervention. Breastfeeding frequency and duration were also assessed in the first 18 hours of birth. The infants' weight was assessed at birth and 10 days later. Data analysis was performed using inferential statistics, chi-square or Fisher's exact test, Kruskal-Wallis test, Mann-Whitney U or one-way ANOVA, Wilcoxon test and logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: There was a larger decrease in the pain score of the reflexology and Benson relaxation (P<0.01) groups after the first and second interventions, compared to the control group. The breastfeeding frequency was higher in the two intervention groups, compared to the control group (P<0.001). Furthermore, the rate of return to the birth weight in ten days of birth was higher in the reflexology (P<0.01) and Benson groups (P<0.05) than the control group. CONCLUSION: Both the reflexology and the Benson relaxation methods effectively decreased pain and increased breastfeeding frequency and the infant's weight gain.",

Reflexology is among the options of complementary medicine. METHOD: In March 2022 a systematic search was conducted searching five electronic databases (Embase, Cochrane, PsychInfo, CINAHL and Medline) to find studies concerning the use, effectiveness and potential harm of reflexology on cancer patients. RESULTS: From all 821 search results, 29 publications concerning 26 studies with 2465 patients were included in this systematic review. The patients treated with reflexology were mainly diagnosed with breast, lung, gastrointestinal and hematological cancer. Outcomes were mainly pain, quality of life, anxiety, depression, fatigue. The studies had moderate to low quality and reported heterogeneous results: Some studies reported significant improvements in above mentioned outcomes while other studies did not find any changes concerning these endpoints. CONCLUSION: Due to the very heterogeneous results and methodical limitations of the included studies, a clear statement regarding the effectiveness of reflexology on cancer patients is not possible. The current evidence indicates that reflexology is superior to passive control groups for pain, quality of life and fatigue, however, more studies with comparable active control groups are needed.",

We systematically searched eight databases for randomized controlled studies on the effects of foot reflexology massage on pregnant women. The inclusion criteria were as follow: participants were pregnant woman; the intervention is foot reflexology or foot massage; the control intervention is placebo, usual care, or no intervention; outcome indicators included pain, anxiety, birth satisfaction, duration of labor, blood pressure, pulse, and respiration; and study type was randomized controlled study. Studies that did not meet the above requirements were excluded. We assessed the quality of the included studies using the Physiotherapy Evidence Database scale, the risk of bias using the Risk of Bias 2.0 tool, and the level of evidence for the outcomes using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment Development and Evaluation. We used Review Manager 5.3 for data analysis and generated funnel plots to assess publication bias. In addition, sensitivity analysis was used to test the stability of the results. A total of 13 randomized controlled studies with 1189 participants were included in this study. Compared to the control group, foot reflexology massage reduced anxiety and pain in pregnant women, shortened the three stages of labor, and increased birth satisfaction. In addition, it also reduced the pulse rate and respiratory rate of pregnant women, but not for blood pressure. Foot reflexology massage can significantly reduce anxiety and pain, shorten the duration of labor, increase birth satisfaction, and stabilize vital signs in pregnant women. It is a safe and non-invasive form of complementary therapy.PROSPERO registered number: CRD42022359641. URL: https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/display_record.php?RecordID=359641 .",

Therefore, this study compared the effects of the Benson relaxation technique and foot reflexology massage on sleep quality of those patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this clinical trial study, 93 patients with systolic heart failure referred to Javad Al-Aeme heart clinic in Torbat Heydarieh were selected with purposive sampling method and divided into the foot reflexology massage, Benson relaxation technique, and control groups using the balanced blocking randomization method. The Benson relaxation technique and the foot reflexology massage were performed for 20 and 30 minutes three days per week for four weeks, respectively. The control group only received routine care. Sleep quality was measured by the Pittsburgh sleep quality index and then compared among the groups before and after the intervention. The data were analyzed using ANOVA, Tukey's post hoc tests, paired t test, and Chi-square at the significant level of p < 0.05. RESULTS: After interventions, the mean (SD) quality of sleep significantly increased in both intervention groups (Reflexology: pre-intervention 10.80 (3.40), post-intervention 6.60 (3.10), Benson relaxation: pre-intervention 15.50 (2.40) post-intervention 12 (2.60), compared to the control group (pre-intervention 10.50 (1.90) post-intervention 9.40(1.70) (p < 0.001). There was no significant difference between the two intervention groups (p = 0.53). CONCLUSIONS: The interventions improved the quality of sleep in patients with systolic heart failure. Therefore, these methods can be used as a suitable complementary treatment to improve the quality of sleep by nurses and midwives."

Reflexology is a nonpharmacologic method used to control pain and anxiety. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to examine the effects of reflexology hand massage and stroking massage on pain and anxiety in patients in the immediate postoperative period after CABG. METHODS: In this double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study, we compared the effects of a 20-minute hand-reflexology massage to placebo stroking massage on pain and anxiety in newly extubated patients in the intensive care unit who had undergone CABG surgery. Pain was measured by visual analog scale and anxiety by the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory before and at 5, 30, and 60 minutes post intervention. RESULTS: A total of 48 patients were enrolled: 24 in the intervention group and 24 in the placebo. Mean pain scores were significantly reduced in the group who received reflexology compared with the placebo group ( F = 36.569, P = .000). Mean anxiety scores were significantly reduced at 60 minutes for the reflexology group compared with the control group ( P = .000).

METHODS AND ANALYSIS: PubMed, Embase, Springer, Web of Science, the Cochrane Library, and reference lists of previous systematic reviews were searched for the eligible randomized controlled trials (RCT) from the inception date of each predefined database up to May 31st, 2023. Data were extracted, and methodological quality was evaluated by the Revised Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for randomized trials (RoB 2). The efficacy of treatment was assessed using pooled effect sizes (Hedges' g) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Meta-analysis was performed using the RevMan 5.4 manager, and publication bias was evaluated by Begg's test. RESULTS: The included a total of 13 RCTs in this review, of eleven was high risk of bias and two were low, reported the effects of reflexology on low back and/or pelvic pain (LBPP), labor pain, duration of labor, anxiety, fatigue, sleep quality, constipation symptoms, and ankle and foot edema in pregnancy. The effect sizes (Hedges' g) for reflexology in labor pain, duration of labor, anxiety, fatigue, and sleep quality showed statistical significance, which the meta-analysis also confirmed except for fatigue and sleep quality due to insufficient studies. CONCLUSION: Reflexology is probably effective and safe for labor pain, duration of labor, and anxiety in pregnancy, while the evidences for reflexology in LBPP, fatigue, sleep quality, constipation symptoms, and ankle and foot edema during pregnancy were insufficient. Based on the low to high quality of included studies, strong supportive evidence is not yet available. Rigorous-design and large-scale clinical trials should be conducted to provide higher-quality, reliable evidence."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND AIM: Fatigue is a common side effect of radiotherapy. While warm footbath and foot reflexology can both reduce fatigue, it is still unclear which method is more effective in reducing fatigue. This study aimed to compare the effects of warm footbath and foot reflexology on the fatigue of patients undergoing radiotherapy. METHOD: A randomized clinical trial study was conducted on 62 patients undergoing radiotherapy. Eligible patients were randomly assigned to the 2 groups. Patients in the footbath group immersed their feet in 41°C water for 20 minutes every night for 2 weeks starting from the seventh day of radiotherapy. Patients in the reflexology group received 20 minutes of foot reflexology every night for 2 weeks starting from the seventh day of radiotherapy. Fatigue was measured by the Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory (MFI) once on the seventh day of radiotherapy and 3 more times on days 7, 14, and 28 after the start of the intervention. Data were analyzed by SPSS20 and descriptive/inferential statistics. RESULTS: The total MFI score of both groups declined significantly over time (P < .001). The reflexology group indicated a significant reduction from 90.9 ± 3.2 in the pre-test to 56.0 ± 3.7 on the 28th day in, while the footbath group indicated it from 90 ± 2.6 in the pre-test to 71.4 ± 2.8 on the 28th day. CONCLUSION: Our results showed that foot reflexology and warm footbath reduced the fatigue of patients undergoing radiotherapy. However, foot reflexology was more effective in reducing the fatigue of patients undergoing radiotherapy than warm footbath. It is recommended that simple and low cost non-pharmacological interventions such as foot reflexology to decrease of side effect of radiotherapy among cancer patients should be widely performed.Trial registration: Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials (IRCT20190625044009N1).",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: In palliative care, the relief of discomfort is sought by an overall approach, combining prescribed medication and additional therapies, such as foot reflexology (FR). The main objective of this study was to assess the feasibility of FR in a population of inpatients in a palliative care unit (PCU).The precariousness of the patients led us to perform a feasibility study and not a cohort study from the outset. Its secondary objective was to assess the impact of an FR session on some symptoms of discomfort (anxiety, pain, troubled sleep, and psychological distress). METHODS: This is a feasibility study designed as a randomized controlled two-arm therapeutic trial. One arm tested FR, the other an active control, massage therapy (MT). The evaluators were blinded. RESULTS: FR was feasible for 14 patients out of the 15 included in the FR group (95% CI [68%; 100%]). These patients were in the palliative care phase of cancer, motor neuron disease, or terminal organ failure. Concerning the symptoms of discomfort, ESAS sleep quality score was on average 3.9 (± 2.5) before a session in the FR group. It was improved to an average of 3 (± 2.3) on the day after the session (effect-size = 0.38 [0.03; 0.73]). CONCLUSION: This study confirms the feasibility of an FR session for patients hospitalized in a PCU. It resulted in a slight improvement in sleep quality. For other discomfort symptoms such as anxiety, pain and distress, FR yielded a non-significant improvement. Significant results would have needed a larger cohort.",

This review aimed to synthesise evidence from randomised controlled trials (RCTs) examining the effectiveness of reflexology on mental health outcomes in people with cancer. METHODS: RCTs published in English and measuring stress, anxiety, depression or quality of life (QoL) were included. Eligible RCTs were identified through search of MEDLINE, Embase, Emcare, PsycINFO, Scopus, the Cochrane Library, OTseeker, PEDro (18 June 2021) and Google and Google Scholar (21 June 2021). The Critical Appraisal Skills Programme Randomised Controlled Trials Checklist was used to assess risk of bias. Meta-analysis and narrative synthesis were undertaken. The certainty of evidence was assessed by using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations (GRADE) framework. RESULTS: Fifteen RCTs (1356 adult participants) were included. Evidence for stress and anxiety (primary outcomes), as well as depression and QoL (secondary outcomes), were mixed and conflicting. The certainty of the evidence was low to very low. CONCLUSION: An unequivocal recommendation supporting reflexology cannot be made. Greater utilisation of well-established reporting guidelines, together with increased investment in well-designed, high-quality clinical research are required.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To verify the effect of foot reflexology on the electrical muscle activity of the lateral and medial gastrocnemius muscle, and to examine the distribution, plantar pressure, and body sway in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. METHODS: This pilot randomized controlled trial enrolled 17 volunteers who were clinically diagnosed with diabetes mellitus. The sample was assigned to one of two groups: the control group (CG, n = 7), who received information on foot care and health, and the intervention group (IG, n = 10), who received the application of foot reflexology on specific areas of the feet, for 10 consecutive days. There was blinding of the evaluator and the therapist. Surface electromyography (EMG) was used to assess the electrical activity of the medial and lateral gastrocnemius muscles in maximum voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC) and isotonic contraction (IC); baropodometry and stabilometry were used to analyze unloading, plantar weight distribution, and body sway. RESULTS: There was a statistically significant difference for the variables of maximum peak electrical activity of the left medial gastrocnemius (p = 0.03; effect size = 0.87 and power = 0.81) and left lateral gastrocnemius muscles (p = 0.04, effect size = 0.70 and power = 0.66) respectively, in the intragroup IC, and median frequency of the left medial gastrocnemius muscle in the intragroup MVIC (p = 0.03; effect size = 0.64 and power = 0.59), and in the variables intergroups of the total area on the right side (p = 0.04; effect size = 1.03 and power = 0.50) and forefoot area on the left side (p = 0.02; effect size = 0.51 and power = 0.16). CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that foot reflexology influenced some variables of the intergroup plantar distribution and intragroup EMG in the sample studied. There is a need for a placebo group, a larger sample and a follow-up to strengthen the findings of these experiments.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Obesity hypoventilation syndrome is one of the most serious outcomes of obesity-related respiratory difficulties, resulting in higher healthcare costs as well as increased cardio-respiratory morbidity and mortality. METHODS: Sixty-two males who had a high risk of obstructive sleep apnea according to the STOP-BANG Sleep Apnea Questionnaire were enrolled in the study. Their age is 50-60 years old, and they have a BMI of 35-40 kg/m2, daytime hypercapnia, and sleep breathing problems. The patients were divided into two equal groups at random reflexology fasting-mimicking diet groups. Weight, height, waist, and neck circumference were assessed at the beginning of the study and after two months of the intervention. Sleep quality was measured using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), which is used to evaluate sleep quality. The Maugeri Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome (MOSAS) questionnaire was used to assess a patient's quality of life. RESULTS: There was a significant change in the MOSAS and PSQI questionnaires for both groups post-intervention, as the p-value was less than 0.05. The percentage change in the MOSAS questionnaire score and PSQI questionnaire was higher in the mimic diet group than in the reflexology group. Also, the mimic diet group's weight and neck circumference were considerably reduced after the intervention, with no change in the reflexology group. CONCLUSIONS: Reflexology and a fasting-mimicking diet were found to have a substantial impact on enhancing the quality of life and sleep in people with obesity hypoventilation syndrome.",

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: Around three quarters of individuals undergoing chemotherapy self-report multiple symptoms. There is clinical trial evidence of effectiveness for acupuncture for commonly experienced symptoms, and emerging evidence for reflexology, but little is known about the effects of these therapies on multiple symptoms when implemented in a real world setting during active chemotherapy treatment. METHODS: This was a cohort study of participants receiving reflexology and/or acupuncture while attending chemotherapy. Participants received a 20 minute reflexology treatment or a 20 minute acupuncture treatment or a combination of both. Patient reported outcome measures were administered before and after the treatment using the Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale (ESAS). RESULTS: During the study period, 330 unique patients received a total of 809 acupuncture and/or reflexology treatments. Participants had, on average, 5.3 symptoms each which they reported as moderate to severe (≥4/10) using the ESAS at baseline. Following treatment, participants reported 3.2 symptoms as moderate to severe. The symptom change for all participant encounters receiving any therapy was statistically significant for all symptoms, and clinically significant (a reduction of more than 1) for all symptoms except financial distress, appetite, and memory. Clinically significant levels of global distress (&lt;3) were reduced in 72% of all participants receiving either therapy. No adverse events were recorded. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that acupuncture and reflexology administered alongside chemotherapy may reduce patient reported symptom burden and patient global symptom related distress. Future research would include an active control group, and consider confounding factors such as chemotherapy stage and medication.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Reflexology is commonly used as an adjunct to conventional treatment by patients with respiratory tract infections. The effect of reflexology needs to be tested in a full-scale randomized controlled study. Small early-phase trials can give an indication on whether full-size clinical trials are warranted. The objective of this study is to determine whether the study design is feasible in a full-scale study of reflexology as an add-on to usual care compared to usual care alone in acute rhinosinusitis, and further if there is a statistical indication of an effect of reflexology warranting a full-scale study. METHODS: 20 patients with symptoms compatible with acute rhinosinusitis, and an illness duration of 28 days or less were randomized to additional reflexology treatment along with usual medical care, or usual care alone. The patients scored how much each of 16 sinus-related symptoms bothered them in the past few days on a six-point scale (zero = no problem to five = severe problem). To determine if there is a statistical indication of an effect of reflexology warranting a full-scale study, the separation test was used. RESULTS: The methodology was considered feasible and could therefore be applied in a full-scale study of reflexology for acute rhinosinusitis. The mean reduction in symptom score from baseline to day two was 0.95 in the reflexology group and 0.78 in the control group. From baseline to day ten the mean reduction in symptom score was 2.12 in the reflexology group and 1.63 in the control group. A statistical indication of effect in a full-scale study in favor of reflexology was found from baseline to day ten but not from baseline to day two. CONCLUSIONS: The research methodology in this study could be used in a full-scale study of reflexology in acute sinusitis. The results from the separation test indicates an effect warranting a full-scale study of reflexology regarding effects in acute sinusitis ten days after treatment.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Foot reflexology is a treatment with the hypothesis that such massage stimulation on the feet may cause a therapeutic effect which should be helpful for smoking cessation. However, its mechanism of action in the brain of smoking people remains unknown. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is helpful for real-time brain activity detection. We aim to compare the brain activity effects of foot reflexology with fMRI between smoking and nonsmoking subjects. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We divided participants into experimental (smokers) and control groups (nonsmokers). Both groups received similar foot reflexology under the fMRI examination. Then, we compared the mean response score in each brain area before and after foot stimulation among groups and between groups. RESULTS: Five nonsmokers and fifteen smokers had completed the study. All participants were right-handed males, with a mean age of 38.6 years. The fMRI brain response in the areas correlated with foot stimulation, including the precentral gyrus of the frontal lobe and the postcentral gyrus of the parietal lobe, was present for all participants. The fMRI response outside the correlated area, including other parts of the frontal and parietal lobes, the temporal and occipital cortices, and the thalamus, was also found in all participants, but was not consistent. CONCLUSIONS: The fMRI of the brain is feasible and safe for demonstrating foot reflexology reactions. The response signal outside the correlated motor-sensory cortical area with foot reflexology may have clinical significance and may be helpful for smoking cessation. We suggest conducting a large-scale, randomized controlled trial to confirm these findings."

PURPOSE: This study aimed to compare the effect of reflexology and Swedish massage on restless leg syndrome and sleep quality in patients undergoing hemodialysis. METHOD: This is a randomized clinical trial conducted on 90 patients undergoing hemodialysis. The two intervention groups received either foot reflexology (n = 30) or Swedish massage (n = 30) for four weeks. In the sham group (n = 30), a simple touch of the knee down was performed with the same conditions as the intervention groups. Each sample completed the International Restless Leg Syndrome and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index Questionnaires before, immediately after, and one month after the intervention. RESULT: The results showed that immediately after the intervention, restless leg syndrome and sleep quality were significantly better in the foot reflexology massage group than the Swedish massage and sham groups (PRLS < 0.001, PPSQI < 0.001); also, changes in restless leg syndrome and sleep quality, respectively, before and one-month follow-up after the intervention were not significant in all three groups (PRLS = 0.47, PPSQI = 0.95), (PRLS = 0.91, PPSQI = 0.87). CONCLUSION: Reflexology and Swedish massage, as complementary methods, can improve the restless leg syndrome and sleep quality of patients undergoing hemodialysis. However, foot reflexology massage had been more effective."

A small but growing evidence base suggests that positive outcomes can be gained in the management and improvement of symptoms across a range of conditions. Biological plausibility is a key concept in the determination of the usefulness of therapies. Research which tests for safety and efficacy alongside the underpinning mechanism of action are therefore important. This paper explores the potential mechanism of action for the outcomes associated with reflexology treatment as reflected in the current evidence. The influences of therapeutic touch, relaxation, placebo effects and the similarities with other therapeutic methods of structural manipulation are considered. The lack of clarity around the precise definition of reflexology and the challenges of researching the therapy as a treatment tailored to individual need are discussed. A deeper understanding of the mechanism of action for reflexology may help to further develop research into safety and efficacy. Such an understanding may lead to the integration of knowledge which may provide both symptomatic support and longer term preventative health benefits.",

METHOD: The study was conducted in the Daytime Chemotherapy Unit of Gülhane Training and Research Hospital and Ankara Training and Research Hospital from June 28 to December 20, 2019, with intervention (n = 29) and control (n = 29) groups. Data were collected using the Patient Information Form, the Rhodes Index of Nausea, Vomiting and Retching, and the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory. Patients in the intervention group received reflexology for a total of 6 weeks, once a week. The patients in the control group did not receive any treatment other than the routine maintenance of the chemotherapy unit. RESULT: As a result, it was determined that 40% of all patients were 55 years or older. While nausea was observed in all patients in the intervention and control groups, vomiting was not noted in the vast majority of patients. Regarding the effect of reflexology on nausea and vomiting, although the mean scores of nausea, vomiting and retching experience, occurrence and distress in both groups were lower than the initial measurement, there was no difference between the groups. Based on the research findings, the State and Trait Anxiety mean scores in the intervention group decreased significantly, while they increased in the control group. CONCLUSION: The research showed that while reflexology did not affect nausea and vomiting in breast cancer patients receiving chemotherapy, it was helpful in reducing anxiety.",

It may increase the duration of labor, increase stress hormones, and affect maternal and new-born related outcomes. This study examined the effectiveness of combined breathing exercises, foot reflexology, and massage (BRM) interventions on labor pain, anxiety, labor duration, stress hormone levels, maternal satisfaction, maternal vital signs, and the new-born's APGAR scores. PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS: This single-blind-parallel randomized controlled trial (RCT) was conducted at the Maternity and Children Hospital (MCH), Makkah, Saudi Arabia, by recruiting primigravidae aged 20 to 35 years, without any medical complications, and who were block-randomized at six-centimeter cervical dilation and stratified by intramuscular pethidine. The intervention is BRM compared to standard care. The labor pain was measured via present behavioral intensity (PBI) and visual analogue scale (VAS), and the anxiety was measured via Anxiety Assessment Scale for Pregnant Women in Labor (AASPWL). The secondary outcomes were duration of labor, maternal stress hormone levels, maternal vital signs, maternal satisfaction, fetal heart rate, and APGAR scores. All outcomes were measured at multiple time-points during and after contraction at baseline, during BRM intervention, at 60, 120, and 180 minutes post-intervention. Generalized linear mixed models were used to estimate the intervention effects over time. RESULTS: A total of 225 participants were randomized for the control (n = 112) and intervention group (113). BRM lowered the labor pain intensity at 60 minutes after intervention during (1.3 vs 3.5, F = 102.5, p < 0.001) and after contraction (0.4 vs 2.4, F = 63.6, p < 0.001) and also lowered anxiety (2.9 vs 4.2, F = 80.4, p < 0.001). BRM correspondingly lowered adrenocorticotropic (ACTH) (133 vs 209 pg/mL, p < 0.001), cortisol (1231 vs 1360 nmol/mL, p = 0.003), and oxytocin (159 vs 121 pg/mL, p < 0.001). It also shortened the labor duration (165 vs 333 minutes, p < 0.001), improved vital signs, which resulted in higher APGAR scores, and increased maternal satisfaction. CONCLUSION: The labor unit management could consider adopting BRM as one of the non-pharmacological analgesia for healthy women in labor. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ISRCTN87414969, registered 3 May 2019."

Non-pharmacological treatment modalities to relieve afterpains are an important care priority. This study was conducted to investigate the effect of foot reflexology in the fourth stage of labor on afterpains in multiparous women. METHODS: This single-blind, randomized, clinical trial recruited 80 eligible pregnant women presenting to Allameh Bohlool Hospital in Gonabad and 17-Shahrivar Hospital in Mashhad, Iran, in 2019. In the first and second hours postpartum, the reflexology group received 10 min of general massage and specific reflexology massage on each foot on the uterine, pituitary, and solar plexus points. The control group received 10 min of general massage, and then rotational massage on a neutral point on the lateral side of the heel. The pain was measured every hour up to 4 h postpartum using a visual analogue  scale. The collected data were analyzed in SPSS-16 software at a significance level of P < 0.05. RESULTS: The median of the afterpain score in the first hour (P = 0.05) and second hour (P = 0.274) postpartum did not differ significantly between the two groups, but this score was lower in the reflexology group at the third hour (P < 0.001) and fourth hour (P < 0.001) postpartum. The mean total afterpain score in the 4 h postpartum was significantly lower in the reflexology group (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: The results revealed that foot reflexology in the fourth stage of labor has positive effects on relief from uterine afterpain. Reflexology is therefore recommended as a measure to reduce postpartum uterine afterpains.",

The aim of this study was to determine the effect of reflexology massage and passive music therapy intervention before burn dressing on pain, anxiety level and sleep quality. METHODS: This study was a randomized controlled trial. The study sample consisted of 36 patients who were hospitalized in the Burn Center of a University Hospital. After obtaining written consent, patients were enrolled to study according to inclusion criteria and then, divided into Reflexology Massage (n = 12), Reflexology Massage with Passive Music Therapy (n = 12) and Control (n = 12) groups using simple random allocation. In the experimental groups, in addition to standard care, interventions were performed for consecutive three days. Interventions were done before dressing for 40 min in the patient's room. The control group received only standard care during this time. Severity of pain in three groups was measured using \"Visual Analog Scale\" twice a day (before dressing change and 2 h after dressing change). Severity of state anxiety and sleep quality in three groups was measured using \"State Anxiety Scale\" and \"Richards-Campbell Sleep Questionnaire\" once a day (before dressing change). Severity of trait anxiety in three groups was measured using \"Trait Anxiety Scale\" for two times (before and after study). The drugs used by the patients for 3 days were recorded in the \"Opioid and Analgesic Drug Form.\" Data were analyzed using Pearson Chi-square, Independent Samples T-test, One-Way ANOVA, Bonferroni, Paired Sample T-Test, Repeated Measures ANOVA tests were used. RESULTS: The results showed no significant difference in severity of pain, anxiety, and sleep quality (p > 0,05) between the three groups on the first day. However, the mean pain scores showed a significant difference between the experimental and control groups in the third (p < 0,05) and fourth (p < 0001) days after intervention. Anxiety scores also showed a significant difference between the experimental and control groups on the fourth (p < 0001) day. Sleep quality of the experimental groups was higher than the control group on the fourth day (p < 00001). No significant difference using of opioid and analgesic drugs between the three groups (p > 0,05). CONCLUSIONS: Our results showed reflexology massage and passive music therapy before burn dressing reduced pain and anxiety level, and increased sleep quality.",

Memory impairment, headache, and muscle pain are the most important complications after ECT. This research aimed to determine the effect of reflexology on the headache and muscle pain intensity of patients after receiving ECT. Methods: This randomized controlled trial was conducted in Razi teaching hospital of Urmia, Iran. A total of 56 patients with depression receiving ECT were randomly assigned into two equal groups of control (n=28) and intervention (n=28). In the intervention group, reflexology was performed for 20 minutes at reflex points and, in the control group, only the conventional measures were taken. Pain intensity was measured with visual analogue scale (VAS) before and 1, 6, and 24 hours after the intervention. Data were analyzed using the SPSS software version 13. Furthermore, chi-square, Mann-Whitney, Wilcoxon, and repeated-measures tests were performed. Results: The mean difference in the severity of headache and muscle pain in the intervention group was significantly reduced compared to the control group. Moreover, the results demonstrated a significant difference between the mean headache and muscle pain in the two groups after the intervention. Conclusion: The results of this study showed the positive effect of reflexology on reducing the intensity of pain in patients receiving ECT. Thus, it is recommended that nurses, health care providers, and caregivers use reflexology to reduce pain in patients with depression receiving ECT."

Sensory deprivation in preterm infants hospitalized in the intensive care units affects their physiological and psychological development. Therefore, this study is an attempt to compare the effects of foot and palm reflexology on respiratory distress in infants subjected to noninvasive ventilation. METHODS: In this clinical study, 150 infants hospitalized at Fatemieh Hospital in Hamadan were randomly assigned to 3 groups. In the intervention groups, the reflexology massage to foot and palm was performed for 10 min within 3 days in 6 rounds. In the control group, leg warming was performed. In each group, the personal information checklist, the respiratory distress score, oxygen saturation percentage, and respiratory rate before and after the daily intervention were examined. Data analysis was performed using the standard statistical tests in SPSS. RESULTS: The results mirrored the statistically significant difference between the intervention and control groups 3 days into the intervention with regard to the average oxygen saturation percentage, respiratory rate, and the respiratory distress score (p < 0.05). When eliminating the effect of confounding variables, therapeutic intervention applied to palm compared to foot had a greater effect on reducing respiratory distress score in the studied infants. CONCLUSION: The reflexology massage method, especially palm reflexology massage, contributes to the mitigation of respiratory distress in preterm infants subjected to noninvasive ventilation. Hence, this low-cost and efficient intervention program can be recommended as a complementary method for preterm infants with respiratory distress.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Cancer is a chronic disease with an incidence of 24.5 million and 9.6 million deaths worldwide in 2017. Lung and colorectal cancer are the most common cancers for both sexes and, according to national and international recommendations, platinum-based chemotherapy is the reference adjuvant treatment. This chemotherapy can be moderately to highly emetogenic. Despite antiemetic therapy, chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) may persist. Moreover, cancer patients are increasingly interested in alternative and complementary medicines and have expressed the desire that nonpharmacological treatments be used in hospitals. Among alternative and complementary medicines, foot reflexology significantly decreases the severity of CINV in patients with breast cancer. OBJECTIVE: The primary aim of this study was to assess the benefits of foot reflexology as a complement therapy to conventional treatments regarding the severity of acute CINV in patients with digestive or lung cancer. The secondary objectives assessed were the frequency and severity of delayed CINV, quality of life, anxiety, and self-esteem. METHODS: This study was conducted between April 2018 and April 2020 in the Hospices Civils de Lyon, France. This was an open-label randomized controlled trial. Participants were randomized into two groups: the intervention group (ie, conventional care with foot reflexology; n=40) and the control group (ie, conventional care without foot reflexology; n=40). Foot reflexology sessions (30 minutes each) were performed on outpatients or inpatients. Eligible participants were patients with lung or digestive cancer with an indication for platinum-based chemotherapy. RESULTS: The severity of acute nausea and vomiting was assessed with a visual analog scale during the second cycle of chemotherapy. A significant increase of at least 2 points was observed for the control group (7/34, 21%; P=.001). Across all cycles, the foot reflexology group showed a trend toward less frequent delayed nausea (P=.28), a significantly less frequent consumption of antiemetic drugs (P=.04), and no significant difference for vomiting (P=.99); there was a trend toward a perception of stronger severity for delayed nausea in the control group (P=.39). Regarding quality of life and anxiety, there was no significant difference between the intervention group and the control group (P=.32 and P=.53, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: This study's results indicate that foot reflexology provides significantly better management of acute nausea severity and decreased consumption of antiemetic drugs in patients with lung or digestive cancer. In order to fulfill patients' desires to use nonpharmacological treatments and complementary and alternative medicines in hospitals, foot reflexology could be provided as a complementary intervention to conventional antiemetic drugs. Foot reflexology did not result in adverse effects. To assess the benefits of foot reflexology in routine practice, a larger study with several health care centers would be needed with a cluster randomized controlled trial.

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Hemodialysis patients experience sexual dysfunction due to the nature of their disease and its complications. Dialysis patients have reported sexual dysfunction as one of the most important stressors, which leads to many psychological and physiological problems. Sexual function in hemodialysis patients has been improved with pharmaceutical and nonpharmacological therapies. Foot reflexology is a complementary and alternative treatment that can be used in conjunction with contemporary care. By activating the chemical nerve system, reflexology may balance enzymes and regulate endocrine function. OBJECTIVES: To determine the effect of foot reflexology on the sexual function of hemodialysis patients. METHODS: This randomized controlled trial was conducted on 47 patients on chronic hemodialysis referred to Imam Reza Hospital in Sirjan, Iran, who were divided into two groups of reflexology (n = 24; male = 19 and female = 5) and sham (n = 23; male = 18, and female = 5). The intervention group received foot reflexology during dialysis for four weeks, three times a week, 30 minutes each time (15 minutes per foot). The sham group received nonspecific foot massage without applying pressure on standard reflex points with the same condition and duration as the intervention group. The international index of erectile function and female sexual function index was assessed before, immediately, and one month after the intervention. RESULTS: The results showed that immediately after the intervention, male orgasm function, sexual desire, and intercourse satisfaction in the reflexology group was significantly higher than those of the sham group. There was no significant difference between the two groups regarding erectile function and overall satisfaction. Furthermore, there was no significant difference between the two groups in terms of different aspects of female sexual function. CONCLUSIONS: Foot reflexology, as an effective intervention treatment, can reduce some aspects of sexual dysfunction of male patients under hemodialysis."

A randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial was conducted in a hemodialysis center with 48 beds in a high turnover hospital in an urban area of Iran. Intervention groups received reflexology (n = 35) and aromatherapy massage using lavender essential oil (n = 35) for 24 sessions, and the placebo group (n = 35) received simple foot massage. The restless legs syndrome rating scale was used to assess RLS severity in the groups before the intervention and after 4 and 8 weeks of the interventions. Results obtained by the mixed model analysis 3 * 3 (3 groups * 3 times) revealed the significant effect of time, group, and the time-group interrelationship (p = 0.001). Aromatherapy massage reduced the RLS severity, but reflexology did not appear to cause any significant reduction in it. Therefore, we suggest that aromatherapy massage be incorporated into routine care for relieving the ailment and suffering of patients undergoing hemodialysis."

METHODS: A pilot study was conducted with adult patients with cancer hospitalized on a 24-bed inpatient oncology unit. Using convenience sampling, 40 patients provided consent and were randomized into either the intervention or control group. Each group had a treatment session of 20-25 minutes in which pre- and postsession surveys were completed, with reflexology performed in the intervention group only. FINDINGS: Results show that foot reflexology significantly decreases pain for inpatients with cancer as compared to traditional nursing care alone. Although the effects on nausea are not statistically significant, they may be clinically relevant; the mean changes in pre- and postsession nausea ratings indicate at least some decreased nausea among patients in the intervention group.",

A 12-week sequential multiple assignment randomized trial comparing home-based reflexology and meditative practices on severity of fatigue and other symptoms was conducted among patients with cancer and their informal caregivers. Dyads were initially randomized to reflexology (N = 150), meditative practices (N = 150), or control (N = 47). If patient's fatigue did not improve (nonresponse) after 4 weeks of reflexology or meditative practices, the dyad was rerandomized to either add the other therapy or continue with the original therapy for weeks 5-8. Four decision rules (DRs) were compared: (1) Initiating reflexology, and if nonresponse on fatigue after 4 weeks, continue with reflexology for another 4 weeks, thus providing a higher dose; (2) Initiating reflexology, and if nonresponse on fatigue after 4 weeks, add meditative practices for the next 4 weeks; (3) Initiating meditative practices, and if nonresponse on fatigue after 4 weeks, continue meditative practices for another 4 weeks, thus providing a higher dose; and (4) Initiating meditative practices, and if nonresponse on fatigue after 4 weeks, add reflexology for the next 4 weeks. Symptoms were evaluated weekly using the M.D. Anderson Symptom Inventory (MDASI). Clinically, nurses can recommend either therapy since no differences were found among the 4 DRs, with the exception of lower severity for summed MDASI symptoms at week 8 for the use of reflexology only (DR-1) versus DR-2 (sequencing reflexology to meditative practices). Adding the other therapy for nonresponders after 4 weeks may not be warranted.",

METHODS: A randomized controlled, parallel-group trial study was conducted at the outpatient elderly health center in Bolu, Turkey. 48 adults aged 65 and over enrolled in the elderly health center were randomized into two groups in a ratio of 1:1 (experimental, n = 24; control, n = 24). Foot reflexology was performed for 12-week in the experimental group, whereas the control group continued their routine treatment and follow-up. The outcome measures included: (1) ankle brachial index, (2) diabetic peripheral neuropathy measured by a comprehensive foot exam, and (3) glycemic control by a glycated hemoglobin A blood test at baseline and after 12 weeks. RESULTS: Post-test diabetic peripheral neuropathy scores (p < 0.001) and glycated hemoglobin A levels (p = 0.002) decreased in the experimental group and increased in the control group. There was no significant between-group difference regarding post-test ankle brachial index scores (p = 0.726). Foot reflexology had a medium effect size on diabetic peripheral neuropathy (95% confidence interval 0.003-2.24; d = 0.51; p < 0.001) and glycated hemoglobin A (95% confidence interval 0.72-1.22; d = 0.52; p = 0.002).

MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study was a prospective, single-blind, randomized controlled trial with a pretest-posttest and a control group. The clinical trial was conducted at a university hospital in the Aegean region between October 2016 and June 2018. It was completed with 62 women, of whom 31 were in the intervention group and 31 were in the control group. Data were collected by using a personal information form, the Beck Anxiety Inventory, the Beck Depression Inventory, and the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30-version 3.0. RESULTS: Anxiety and depression levels were lower in the intervention group than in the control group. Besides, the quality of life was higher in the intervention group than in the control group. Reflexology significantly reduced symptoms due to chemotherapy, such as fatigue, pain, insomnia, and loss of appetite. Although there was a decrease in symptoms, such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and constipation immediately after reflexology, an increase in symptoms was observed in the intervention group two weeks later. CONCLUSION: These results showed that reflexology based on Watson's theory of human caring is effective in reduction of anxiety and depression and improves the quality of life in gynecological cancer patients during chemotherapy. It can be suggested that offering reflexology at certain intervals during chemotherapy will increase the duration of its effect.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Pruritus is a common skin manifestation in patients undergoing hemodialysis. Pruritus has a negative impact on the quality of life of patients receiving hemodialysis. This study was aimed to investigate the effect of foot reflexology massage on pruritus in hemodialysis patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A quasi-experimental study was conducted on 90 hemodialysis patients referred to Khatam-al-Anbiya and Ali-Ebne Abi-Taleb hospitals affiliated to Zahedan University of Medical Sciences in 2019. Patients with moderate-to-severe pruritus scores obtained from the Pruritus Severity Scale (PSS) were included in the study. They were randomly divided into intervention and control groups using shuffling cards or envelopes. The intervention group received nine sessions of foot reflexology massage 3 days a week for 20 min (10 min on each foot) with an emphasis on the solar plexus point. The participants in both groups again completed the PSS 48 h after the intervention. Data were analyzed using the SPSS version 24, independent t-test, Chi-square test, and paired t-test. RESULTS: The results of this study demonstrated that foot reflexology massage significantly reduced itching or pruritus in hemodialysis patients (P < 0.001). Pruritus scores in the control group were statistically significant (P < 0.001). There was no significant statistically difference between the two groups in terms of the pruritus scores before the intervention (P = 0.59). CONCLUSION: Our findings showed that the foot reflexology massage could relieve itching or pruritus in hemodialysis patients. It is, therefore, recommended that it can be used as an effective intervention technique to alleviate itching in hemodialysis patients."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Delirium is the most common neurologic disorder after cardiac surgery and affects both short and long-term outcomes. This study was conducted to evaluate the effect of foot reflexology massage on the incidence of delirium and sleep quality in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. METHODS: In this randomized clinical trial, 60 patients who were candidates for CABG surgery were randomly assigned into two equal groups (n = 30); intervention and control groups. In the intervention group, foot reflexology massage was done on each foot for 15 min, for two consecutive days. Delirium observation screening scale, the Richard Campbell sleep questionnaire (RSCQ), and pain intensity using VAS were compared. RESULTS: in the second postoperative day, delirium was observed in 8 (26.7 %) and 7 (23.3 %) of patients in the intervention and control groups, respectively (p > 0.05). The measured odds ratio for the effect of massage on delirium is 0.83 (95 %CI 0.71-2.69, p = 0.76). The difference in RSCQ scores was not significant between groups of intervention and control (68.32 ± 10.41 VS. 62.80 ± 11.86, P = 0.06). The pain intensity was lower in the intervention group (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Foot reflexology was not effective in reducing delirium and improving the sleep quality, but the pain intensity was decreased. It seems that the precise pathology and predicting model of delirium should be identified, and appropriate interventions should be planned accordingly.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Infantile colic and its accompanying crying represent a major source of stress and have negative physiological, emotional and psychological effects on infants and parents. The aim of this study was to examine the efficacy of foot reflexology for reducing symptoms of infantile colic. DESIGN: The study was conducted as a single-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial with a sample population of 45 infants diagnosed with infantile colic. METHODS: Simple randomization was used to select a reflexology (study) group (n = 20) and a placebo group of infants with colic (n = 25). The parents and biostatistician were blinded to group assessment. Foot reflexology, or stimulating reflex points on the foot, was implemented with the reflexology group. Placebo foot reflexology, or noneffective touch, was used with the placebo group. Over a two-week period, both interventions were performed four times for 20 min each time by the researcher. The researcher collected data using the information form, the Infant Colic Scale (ICS), and a diary of daily crying duration. RESULTS: The trial ended with the completion of the data. In each group, 20 infants were studied. The means of the Infant Colic Scale scores and daily crying duration were significantly lower in the foot-reflexology group than in the placebo foot-reflexology group (p < .001). Infants with colic in the reflexology group cried less and experienced fewer symptoms than before treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Foot reflexology is a non-invasive and safe nursing intervention that is effective for reducing crying duration and symptoms in infants with colic.",

Patients who experience all or some of these symptoms will often report reduced health-related quality of life (HRQOL) and poor sleep quality, which may lead to increased morbidity and mortality. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this pilot study is to evaluate the feasibility of a larger randomised controlled trial to determine the effect of foot reflexology on a cohort of patients undergoing hospital-based haemodialysis. DESIGN: A nonrandomised pilot study using a multimethod approach. PARTICIPANTS: Twenty patients undergoing hospital-based haemodialysis treatment. MEASUREMENTS: HRQOL and quality of sleep were measured using the SF-12 Health Survey and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Semi-structured interviews were completed with 10 patients, exploring their experiences, opinions and perceptions of the intervention. RESULTS: There was an increase in the mean scores examining the total physical health and mental health components of the SF-12. All corresponding p values were statistically significant following the intervention. The mean total sleep score postintervention signified positive changes in sleep quality, with the corresponding p values being statistically significant. The study established the feasibility of the intervention and the benefits for patients undergoing haemodialysis. CONCLUSION: This pilot study demonstrated the possibility of recruiting and retaining patients undergoing haemodialysis to a reflexology study. The study did not impact the haemodialysis routine and was positively received. The intervention showed statistically significant improvements in patients' HRQOL and sleep quality.",

However, the most debated and treatment-limiting adverse effect of ECT is amnesia. Therefore, due to the restriction of the use of drugs to manage amnesia in patients undergoing ECT, the present study investigated the effect of reflexology on amnesia. Methods: In this randomized controlled trial, 68 patients who met the inclusion criteria were randomly allocated to intervention and control groups. The intervention group received foot reflexology with olive oil 20 minutes a day for 3 days, while the control group was given a gentle foot rub with olive oil 20 minutes a day for 3 days. The amnesia rate of all patients was measured by the Galveston Orientation and Amnesia Test (GOAT) 30 minutes after the end of ECT. The data were analyzed using SPSS software version 11.5 and t-test, chi-squared test, and repeated measures ANOVA. Results: The results showed that reflexology significantly increased recalling scores in the intervention group compared to the control group. Foot reflexology seems to be effective in managing amnesia in patients after ECT. Conclusion: Foot reflexology, as a relatively simple, inexpensive, and non-invasive technique with few side effects, can be used to manage amnesia in patients after ECT."

      "abstract": "CONTEXT: Multiple Sclerosis (MS), occupies the first row among the diseases which leads to loss of neurological ability without depending on a trauma in the adults. Reflexology is one of complementary therapies based on activating a body's power to recover itself by special hand techniques applied to feet and hands. Positive changes in spasticity, pain, fatigue, depression, cortisol levels, anxiety, and blood pressure levels have been observed in MS patients after reflexology. OBJECTIVES: This study was conducted to determine the effect of reflexology on pain, fatigue and quality of life in MS patients. DESIGN: The study was conducted experimentally by taking pretest and repeated measurements on reflexology and control groups determined by simple randomization. SETTING: The study took place in the neurology clinics at two university hospitals in Turkey. PARTICIPANTS: Potential participants were 685 patients at the clinics who had been diagnosed with MS 6 months at least prior to the study. Of that group, 66 patients were included in the study, 33 in the intervention group and 33 in the control group. INTERVENTION: Reflexology was applied on each patient in the intervention group for 3 sessions a week for 12 weeks, and weekly pain and fatigue and monthly quality of life were evaluated. No intervention was made to the control group. Both groups received routine treatment. OUTCOME MEASURES: Measurements occurred at baseline, weekly and monthly throughout the trial, and postintervention. Pain and fatigue were evaluated weekly using a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) and the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS), respectively and quality of life was evaluated monthly using the Multiple Sclerosis Quality of Life-54 (MSQOL-54) scale. RESULTS: In the intervention group, significant decreases were observed in the pain scores from the seventh week and in the fatigue scores from the fifth week (P < .001). In the assessment of quality of life, the combined physical health and combined mental health scores were found to be higher in the intervention group than in the control group (P < .001). CONCLUSION: The study indicates that reflexology can be used as a complementary and alternative therapy to reduce pain and fatigue and enhance quality of life in MS patients.",

METHODS: This single-blind randomized controlled trial was performed on 90 women in Al-Zahra and Taleghani hospitals in Tabriz-Iran. Participants were randomly assigned into three groups; Intervention 1 (two 30-min massages at the effective point of pain for each sole), intervention 2 (one 30-min massage at the effective point of pain and one 30-min massage at the heel for each sole), and control (two 30-minute heel massages). Massage was performed once in 4-cm dilatation and the second time in 7-cm dilatation. The severity of pain and childbirth experience were measured by Visual Analogue Scale and Labor Agentry Scale, respectively. Partograph chart was used to measure the length of labor stages. RESULTS: The severity of pain in intervention group 1 was significantly lower than the control group (AMD: -1.7; 9% confidence interval: -2.8 to -0.6; p = 0.001), but there was no significant difference between intervention groups 1 and 2 (p = 0.066) and intervention group 2 and control (p = 0.336). A significant difference was observed between groups in terms of length of the third stage of labor (p = 0.04). There was no significant difference between groups in terms of mean childbirth experience score (p = 0.217), duration of active phase (p = 0.099), and second stage of labor (p = 0.114).

METHODS: In this quasi-experimental study, 60 healthy neonates were recruited and divided into a reflexology group (n=30) and a control (n=30) group. The study design was quasi-experimental since the randomisation method was not used in the assignment of newborns to the groups. While the reflexology group received foot reflexology for an average of 20min before heel lance, the control group received no intervention. The elicited data were analysed using descriptive statistics and independent t-test. RESULTS: The reflexology and the control groups were similar in terms of age, gestational week, Apgar score, weight, height, and sex (P>0.05). The Neonatal infant pain scale (NIPS) scores of the newborns in the reflexology group after the heel lance procedure were found to be significantly lower than those in the control group (P<0.05). It was also found that reflexology had a significant effect on the neonates' heart rate before heel lance (P<0.05) and a borderline effect during heel lance. Moreover, it was observed that the application of foot reflexology shortened the experimental-group neonates' crying periods after the procedural pain (P<0.05). However, reflexology had no statistically significant effect on the duration of heel lance in both groups (P>0.05). CONCLUSION: The application of foot reflexology before invasive procedures, such as heel lance in newborns, is an effective non-pharmacological method for reducing invasive pain. Thus, reflexology could be used to reduce neonates' pain and soothe them during painful procedures such as heel lance.",

SETTING: The study taken place in the labour room, Amrita Institute of Medical Sciences, Kerala, South India. PARTICIPANTS: 50 primigravida patients experiencing labour. RESEARCH DESIGN: A quasi-experimental study design was used. Subjects were selected by convenience sampling technique with the first 25 patients allocated to the experimental group and the successive 25 primigravida mothers to a time-control group, to avoid data contamination. INTERVENTION: Intervention consisted of foot reflexology applied by a trained therapist to five pressure points of both feet that correspond to the uterus. Total intervention time lasted 20 minutes. Control group rested quietly for 20 minutes to serve as a time control. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Pain associated with labour was recorded on a visual analogue scale immediately prior to intervention, and at 20- and 40-minutes postintervention. Patient satisfaction with reflexology treatment was recorded. RESULTS: Mean baseline pain score in foot reflexology group was significantly reduced across the study timeframe relative to control group (p < .001). Post hoc tests confirmed a reduction in labour pain at both the 20-min (p < .001, 95%CI 0.764-1.796) and 40-min (p < .001, 95%CI 0.643-1.677) time points. Eighty-one per cent of patients would recommend reflexology during labour. CONCLUSION: The findings showed that foot reflexology was effective in relief of labour pain, with a high degree of patient satisfaction in primigravida mothers."

DATA SOURCES: Datasets including PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, Google Scholar, CINAHL and two Chinese electronic databases (i.e., AiritiLibrary and China National Knowledge Infrastructure) were used to search from their inception to 31 January 2019. REVIEW METHODS: Studies which were randomized controlled trials that reported changes in sleep disturbances after the intervention among adults over 18 years old and written in the English or Chinese language were included. Two reviewers' independently assessed the eligibility, extracted data, and conducted a quality assessment. Based on the extracted data, two separate meta-analyses were performed. RESULTS: Forty-two articles with a total sample of 3,928 participants were included in the systematic review and were eligible for the meta-analysis. The most commonly employed outcome measurement tool was the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, followed by the therapeutic effect between the intervention and control groups (as evaluated by participants with sleep problems compared with those without sleep problems in each group after the intervention). Results revealed that foot reflexology resulted in a greater reduction in the sleep quality score compared with the controls (Hedges' g = -1.37; 95% confidence interval (CI) = -1.81~-0.94). As for the therapeutic effect, participants in the intervention group were less likely to have sleep problems than those in the control group (pooled odds ratio = 0.25; 95% CI = 0.19 ~ 0.31). CONCLUSION: The findings suggested that foot reflexology produced significant improvements in sleep disturbances. IMPACT: Foot reflexology is a non-invasive and convenient intervention and regularly receiving foot reflexology can be considered complementary therapy to improve the sleep quality of adults with sleep disturbances. Furthermore, healthcare providers can actively press the solar plexus and heart zones to alleviate sleep disturbances when performing foot reflexology.",

The samples randomly assigned to first intervention (reflexology), second intervention (body massage) and control groups using the block randomization. In the reflexology group, the relevant area on each foot was massaged for 15 min in a relaxed position. In the massage body group, the limbs were massaged with circular motion. The massage was performed once a day for 15 min and the control group did not receive any intervention. Physiological indicators were monitored using vital sign monitoring tools, and blood bilirubin levels were measured photo metrically (intravenous blood samples from the wrist). Finally, the data were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics and SPSS software version 18. RESULTS: The results showed that before the intervention there was no significant difference in the mean of physiological indicators and bilirubin level between the three groups (p > 0.05), but after the intervention the average percentage of arterial oxygen saturation and bilirubin levels were significantly improved in the intervention groups compared to the control group (p < 0.05), while the mean of heart rate and respiration rate between the three groups were not significant (p > 0.05). CONCLUSION: The results showed that reflexology and massage therapy can be effective in improving the condition of physiological indicators and blood bilirubin levels.",

METHODS: A single-blind randomized controlled experimental study was conducted with a total of 60 postpartum women in the reflexology application (n = 30) and control groups (n = 30). After the CS, the mothers in the control group were given approximately 3-h routine nursing care after recovering from the effects of anesthesia; the introductory information form was applied, and the Breastfeeding Charting System and Documentation Tool (LATCH) and visual analog scale (VAS) for the signs of the onset of lactation were implemented on the first and second days. Reflexology was applied to the women in the intervention group after an average of 3 h following the mother's condition had become stable and she had recovered from the effects of anesthesia. Reflexology was applied a total of 20 min - 10 min for the right foot, 10 min for the left foot - twice a day with 8-h intervals on the first and second days after CS. After the last reflexology application, the LATCH and VAS for the signs of the onset of lactation were applied. RESULTS: Of the women, 70% breastfed their babies within 60 min after delivery; 46.7% of the mothers received breastfeeding training and 81.7% needed support for breastfeeding after the CS. The LATCH breastfeeding scores of the women in the intervention group on both days were significantly higher compared to those of the women in the control group (p < 0.001). On the first day after the CS, apart from breast pain, there was no significant difference between the two groups in terms of breast heat and breast tension (p > 0.05). On the second day after the CS, apart from breast tension, there was no significant difference between the groups in terms of breast heat and breast pain (p < 0.05). In the study, women in the intervention group were found to have higher scores in terms of all three symptoms compared to the control group (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: In the study, it was determined that LATCH scores and signs of the onset of breastfeeding increased in the mothers who received reflexology after CS.",

In recent years, the use of complementary and alternative treatment methods has been increasing due to the fact that pharmacological treatment cannot control the pain in general, and its various side effects and cost. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of foot reflexology on low back pain of operating room nurses. This quasiexperimental study was conducted with 38 operating room nurses. The nurses in the experimental group were given a 30-minute reflexology protocol once a week for 4 weeks and their pain levels were assessed again at week 5. The control group nurses did not receive any intervention. Data were collected using a demographic information form and a visual analog scale (VAS). The low back pain of the nurses in the reflexology group decreased significantly at week 5 compared with week 1, whereas the severity of low back pain of the nurses in the control group did not change between weeks 1 and 5. There were no statistically significant differences between the groups in terms of the mean VAS pain score at week 1. However, the nurses in the reflexology group had significantly lower VAS pain mean scores at week 5 than the control group. In this study, reflexology significantly reduced the pain of nurses who had low back pain. Therefore, reflexology might be useful in controlling low back pain of operating room nurses.",

Although there are various pharmacological treatment choices for this condition, many patients fail to adhere to them, making non-pharmacological options attractive alternatives. Foot reflexology has been proven to decrease blood pressure (BP), but data are limited in patients with stage-2 HT. We conducted a randomized clinical trial to examine the effectiveness of foot reflexology in reducing BP and heart rate (HR). Stage-2 HT patients were enrolled and randomized into the intervention and the control groups (n = 47, each), the former of which underwent foot reflexology during a follow-up visit. Office BP and HR were measured before and at 15 and 30 min after the procedure in the intervention group and after resting in the control group. In the intervention group, systolic BP (SBP), diastolic BP (DBP), and HR at 15 min were significantly lower than at baseline: -3.29 mm Hg (95%CI; -5.64 to -0.93), -1.71 mm Hg (95%CI; -3.11 to -0.32), and -1.71 beats per min (bpm; 95%CI; -2.88 to -0.54), respectively. Similar trends were also observed at 30 min. However, when compared with the control group, only the reduction in HR was significant (-4.96 bpm; 95%CI, -9.63 to -0.28). We conclude that foot reflexology was effective in reducing HR in stage-2 HT patients and partially effective in reducing BP.",

METHODS: Electronic databases (PubMed, ClinicalKey, ScienceDirect, EMBASE, PsycINFO, and the Cochrane Library) were searched till August, 10, 2020, and the validity of the eligible studies was critically appraised. Randomized controlled trials comparing foot reflexology groups with control groups for adult depression, anxiety, and sleep quality were included. Twenty-six eligible studies were included to assess the effect of foot reflexology intervention on the reducing symptoms of depression and anxiety and improving quality of sleep, respectively, as the primary outcome. RESULTS: Twenty-six randomized controlled trials involving 2,366 participants met the inclusion criteria. The meta-analyses showed that foot reflexology intervention significantly improved adult depression (Hedges' g = -0.921; 95% CI: -1.246 to -0.595; P < 0.001), anxiety (Hedges' g = -1.237; 95% CI -1.682 to -0.791; P < 0.001), and sleep quality (Hedges' g = -1.665; 95% CI -2.361 to -0.970; P < 0.001). Metaregression reveals that an increase in total foot reflexology time (P = 0.002) and duration (P = 0.01) can significantly improve sleep quality. CONCLUSIONS: Foot reflexology may provide additional nonpharmacotherapy intervention for adults suffering from depression, anxiety, or sleep disturbance. However, high quality and rigorous design RCTs in specific population, along with an increase in participants, and a long-term follow-up are recommended in the future."

Despite remarkable improvement in asthma treatment, better education and guideline implementation strategies, there is growing interest in using complementary and alternative medicine, like reflexology and homeopathy. However, evidence supporting the effectiveness of homeopathy and reflexology in asthma treatment is not available. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of reflexology and homeopathy as adjunctive therapies in asthma. METHODS: In a single centre, randomised, investigator blinded, controlled study 86 asthma patients were enrolled. They were assigned to one of three study groups (conventional treatment alone or conventional treatment with addition of either homeopathy or reflexology). All patients received their asthma treatment during the study and were followed as usual by their general practitioner. The study assignment group of individual patients were blinded to the investigators, who made the clinical evaluation of asthma control. The primary outcome was the change in the asthma quality of life questionnaire (AQLQ) scores after 26 weeks. Secondary outcomes included asthma control questionnaire, EuroQol, forced expiratory volume in 1 sec, morning and evening peak expiratory flow, asthma symptoms, rescue medication use, and total medication score. RESULTS: Minor improvements in the AQLQ score were observed in all three groups. However, no statistically significant changes in AQLQ scores were seen within or between groups. Likewise, secondary outcomes did not differ between groups. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, the addition of homeopathy or reflexology to conventional treatment did not result in improved quality of life in asthma."

Design: A stratified random sample was selected, using an experimental design. Location: An outpatient Palliative Care Unit in Attica, Greece. Subjects: 88 patients suffering with cancer. Interventions: The sample was randomly divided into two equal groups, a reflexology and a relaxation group. The number of interventions for both groups was six 30-min weekly sessions. Outcome measures: The Greek Brief Pain Inventory (G-BPI) was used to measure pain, the Greek Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale for screening anxiety and depression, and finally the Short Form Health Survey was used to measure QoL. Measurements of the above tools were taken three times in both groups as follows: preintervention, at fourth and at sixth week of intervention. Results: Anxiety and depression for both groups exhibited a statistically significant decrease during the observation period (p < 0.001, η2 > 0.25) but at the sixth week, there was a more significant decrease in the reflexology group compared with the relaxation group (p = 0.062, η2 = 0.044 vs. p = 0.005, η2 = 0.096 for anxiety), (p = 0.006, η2 = 0.094 vs. p = 0.001, η2 = 0.138 for depression). QoL physical and mental component measurements were significantly greater for the reflexology group (p < 0.001, η2 = 0.168 and p = 0.017, η2 = 0.071, respectively). The baseline-to-sixth week G-BPI measurements were markedly decreased for the reflexology group (p = 0.207, η2 = 0.020). Conclusions: Both interventions, relaxation and reflexology, seemed to be effective in decreasing anxiety and depression in patients with cancer. However, reflexology was found to be more effective in improving QoL (physical component) and to have a greater effect on pain management than relaxation.",

AIM: This study aimed to investigate the effect of hand reflexology on pain and fatigue in patients after coronary angiography. DESIGN: A randomized controlled clinical trial. METHODS: This study was conducted on 90 patients in an angiography department of a referral hospital in an urban area of Iran. The patients were randomly divided into two interventions (n = 45) and control (n = 45) groups. Hand reflexology was performed for 20 minutes in the intervention group. Pain and fatigue in the groups were measured immediately, 4 and 6 hours after the intervention. RESULTS: Statistically significant differences were observed in pain and fatigue scores between the groups after the intervention (P = 0.001). The intervention had medium to large effects on the patients' pain and fatigue. Hand reflexology as a nonpharmacological and safe technique can be used by nurses along with other pharmacologic interventions in order to reduce patients' suffering related to invasive procedures.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Foot reflexology has been considered an important complementary therapy for many health-related symptoms, especially for some chronic conditions such as anxiety, stress, pain and fatigue. Some studies also showed that foot reflexology had a significant effect on functional constipation, whereas some studies did not. The effect of foot reflexology on functional constipation remains controversial. Therefore, an evidence-based systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials were conducted to investigate the effect of foot reflexology on functional constipation. METHODS: Randomised controlled trials were identified by searching five electronic databases and hand-searching eligible reference lists. Studies that reported the effect of foot reflexology on functional constipation were included. Two reviewers performed the study screening, quality assessment and data extraction. Any discrepancy was discussed with a third reviewer. Quantitative synthesis was conducted for the same outcome measurements by calculating weighted risk ratios. RESULTS: A total of 203 records were identified, of which seven were eligible. Overall, foot reflexology significantly increased the curative ratio, with a pooled risk ratio of 1.27 (95% CI: 1.16, 1.40, p < 0.00001). Three trials compared the improvement of constipation-related symptoms after intervention in both the experimental and control groups by evaluating the constipation-related symptom scores. The results all showed that foot reflexology can effectively improve constipation-related symptoms. However, one trial reported that foot reflexology had no significant effect on stool frequency and stool consistency. Two studies indicated that foot reflexology significantly reduced the recurrence rate of functional constipation. One study reported the effect of foot reflexology on compliance with the toilet training, diet and motivation. Nevertheless, no significant improvement was detected. CONCLUSION: Foot reflexology is an effective complementary therapy for treating functional constipation. However, because of the small number of included studies and their small sample sizes, the current evidence was insufficient to support the effectiveness of foot reflexology in reducing the recurrence rate, improving the constipation-related symptom, and compliance with toilet training, diet and motivation. Randomised controlled trials with long-term follow-up are needed for further investigation.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Burn-specific pain anxiety and sleep disorders are common factors in burned patients that affect wound healing process, as well as the severity of burn pain. This study aimed to investigate the effect of foot reflexology massage on burn-specific pain anxiety and sleep condition of patients hospitalized in the burn ICU. METHOD: In this randomized controlled clinical trial, 52 patients were assigned by permuted block randomization 1:1 to the intervention (n=26) and control (n=26) groups. The intervention group received 20min of foot reflexology massage during 3 days on their third, fourth and fifth days of hospitalization and 15min before changing wound dressings. Patients in the control group merely received routine care. The Burn-Specific Pain Anxiety Scale (BSPAS) was completed for three consecutive days before and after changing wound dressings, and St. Mary's Hospital Sleep Questionnaire (SMHSQ) was filled out for four consecutive days before changing wound dressings for patients in both groups. The data were analyzed by IBM SPSS 16 software, Chicago, independent t, Chi-square, Friedman, Mann-Whitney and Wilcoxon tests. FINDINGS: We found no significant difference between pain-anxiety in the two groups before the intervention. The trend of different days in each groups were compared with Friedman test and showed that pain anxiety (p<0.001), sleep latency (p<0.001), duration of the last day's sleep (p<0.001) and satisfaction of the last night sleep (p<0.001) had a significant difference. In addition, Mann-Whitney test results showed that there were significant differences between the two groups at different times in terms of the above variables (p<0.05). The effect size was=0.82 for pain anxiety between group after the intervention. CONCLUSION: Based on the results, foot reflexology massage can effectively reduce pain anxiety levels and improve sleep quality and quantity of patients with burn injuries; therefore, this non- pharmacological therapeutic method is recommended to be used in the burn ICUs.

      "abstract": "MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study was a parallel randomized controlled trial. Patients admitted to the transplantation ward participated in the study. Fifty-three eligible patients were allocated into the foot reflexology group (n = 26) and the control group (n = 27) by using the stratified randomization method. Finally, 25 participants in each group finished the study. The intervention group received foot reflexology for 30 minutes once a day for three consecutive days, and no reflexology was applied in the control group. The intervention started on the second day after surgery. Pain, fatigue, and quality of sleep were measured on the first, second (before intervention), third, fourth, and eleventh days after surgery. Data were collected using visual analogue scale for measuring pain and fatigue and Verran and Snyder-Halpern sleep scale for measuring quality of sleep. RESULTS: In each group, 25 patients finished the study. The mean pain score in the foot reflexology and control groups decreased from 9.44 ± 0.96 and 9.36 ± 0.91 on the day of surgery to 1.32 ± 0.94 and 4.32 ± 1.68 on the eleventh day after surgery, respectively. The mean fatigue score in the reflexology and control groups decreased from 8.76 ± 1.27 and 8.6 ± 1.26 on the day of surgery to 1.24 ± 1.2 and 3.92 ± 1.63 on the eleventh day after surgery, respectively. The mean sleep score in the foot reflexology and control groups increased from 33.38 ± 11.22 and 39.59 ± 12.8 on the day of surgery to 69.43 ± 12.8 and 56.27 ± 8.03 on the eleventh day after surgery, respectively. While pain, fatigue, and sleep quality scores improved in both groups, those in the intervention group showed significantly greater improvement compared with the control group (P < 0.001). No significant difference was found between the two groups in the use of acetaminophen on the first, second, third, fourth, and eleventh days after surgery (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: Foot reflexology may reduce pain and fatigue and improve sleep quality of patients after kidney transplantation."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this randomized three-arm controlled clinical trial, participants (n = 120) were randomly assigned to the intervention, placebo, or control groups. The intervention group received foot reflexology massage for 15 min. Agitation was assessed using the Richmond Agitation- Sedation Scale before the intervention (Time 1) and immediately (Time 2) and 10 min after the intervention (Time 3). Extubation time was measured as the time from gaining full consciousness to endotracheal extubation. RESULTS: Agitation reduced in all groups from Time 1 to Time 3 (p < 0.05); however, the intervention group showed a significantly higher reduction at Time 2 (p < 0.001) and Time 3 (p < 0.001). Also, extubation time was significantly shorter in the intervention group (p < 0.01).

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: One of the most important problems in burn patients was pain, especially in dressing changes. This pain can lead to anxiety in the patient. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of foot reflexology on pain and anxiety severity in burn patients. METHODS: This study was a randomized controlled trial, in which 66 patients with burn injuries referred to Vali-e-asr Hospital, Arak, Iran participated. After obtaining written consent, patients were enrolled to study according to inclusion criteria and then, divided into intervention (n = 33) and control (n = 33) groups using simple random allocation. In the intervention group, in addition to standard care, reflexology was performed for one week on Saturday, Monday and Wednesday (three times in a week). The intervention was done one hour before dressing change in a separate room for 30 min. The control group received only standard care during this time (both intervention and control groups were the same in the type of treatment, and reflexology was considered as an extra care in the intervention group). Severity of pain and anxiety in both groups was measured using visual analog scale twice a day (5-10 min before dressing change and 5-10 min after dressing change) for six days. SPSS software ver. 15 was used for statistical analysis. Mean and standard deviation were used for quantitative variables and qualitative variables were reported as frequency and percentage. Data were analyzed using Chi‑square, Mann-Whitney, Fisher's exact tests, and paired t-test. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was used to check the normality of data. RESULTS: The results showed no significant difference in severity of pain (p = 0.25) and anxiety (p = 0.37) between the two groups on the first day, before the intervention. In the following days, the results showed no significant difference between the two groups in the second and third treatments after intervention . However, the mean pain scores showed a significant difference between the two groups in the forth (p = 0.005), fifth (p = 0.001), and sixth (p = 0.001) days after intervention. Anxiety scores also showed a significant difference between the two groups on the fourth (p = 0.01), fifth (p = 0.001), and sixth (p = 0.001) days. CONCLUSIONS: Our results showed foot reflexology is an appropriate and safe intervention for management of pain and anxiety of burn patients. Therefore, it can be used as a complementary method alongside other methods.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Labour pain is among the severest pains primigravidae may experience during pregnancy. Failure to address labour pain and anxiety may lead to abnormal labour. Despite the many complementary non-pharmacological approaches to coping with labour pain, the quality of evidence is low and best approaches are not established. This study protocol describes a proposed investigation of the effects of a combination of breathing exercises, foot reflexology and back massage (BRM) on the labour experiences of primigravidae. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This randomised controlled trial will involve an intervention group receiving BRM and standard labour care, and a control group receiving only standard labour care. Primigravidae of 26-34 weeks of gestation without chronic diseases or pregnancy-related complications will be recruited from antenatal clinics. Eligible and consenting patients will be randomly allocated to the intervention or the control group stratified by intramuscular pethidine use. The BRM intervention will be delivered by a trained massage therapist. The primary outcomes of labour pain and anxiety will be measured during and after uterine contractions at baseline (cervical dilatation 6 cm) and post BRM hourly for 2 hours. The secondary outcomes include maternal stress hormone (adrenocorticotropic hormone, cortisol and oxytocin) levels, maternal vital signs (V/S), fetal heart rate, labour duration, Apgar scores and maternal satisfaction. The sample size is estimated based on the between-group difference of 0.6 in anxiety scores, 95% power and 5% α error, which yields a required sample size of 154 (77 in each group) accounting for a 20% attrition rate. The between-group and within-group outcome measures will be examined with mixed-effect regression models, time series analyses and paired t-test or equivalent non-parametric tests, respectively. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval was obtained from the Ethical Committee for Research Involving Human Subjects of the Ministry of Health in the Saudi Arabia (H-02-K-076-0319-109) on 14 April 2019, and from the Ethics Committee for Research Involving Human Subjects (JKEUPM) Universiti Putra Malaysia on 23 October 2019, reference number: JKEUPM-2019-169.
