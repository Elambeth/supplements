      "abstract": "BES1 (BRI1 EMS SUPPRESSOR 1) is a critical transcription factor involved in plant growth, development, and stress responses. Although BES1 genes have been characterized in several species, their roles in longan (Dimocarpus longan Lour.) remain unclear. This study identified and analyzed eight BES1 genes in the longan genome. Phylogenetic analysis classified these genes into four subgroups (I-IV), with conserved motifs and intron-exon structures indicating potential functional similarities within subgroups. Cis-element analysis revealed that the promoters of DlBES1 genes contain numerous hormone-related elements, including ABRE, TGACG, and TCA motifs, suggesting their involvement in hormonal signaling and stress responses. Expression profiling showed differential expression patterns of DlBES1 genes across nine tissues, with notable up-regulation in roots and seeds. Additionally, DlBES1 genes exhibited distinct expression trends under varying temperatures and in response to IAA treatment, indicating potential roles in temperature stress adaptation and hormone signaling. These findings provide novel insights into the regulatory mechanisms of BES1 genes in longan and highlight their potential significance in stress tolerance and growth regulation.",

      "abstract": "Compared to control longan, on day 6, DCC-treated longan presented 18 %, 2 %, 15 %, 34 %, 21 %, 26 % and 10 % higher levels of pulp breakdown index, fruit respiration rate, PGI, SDH, NAD, NADH and QH2, respectively. Meanwhile, DCC-treated longan displayed 25 %, 5 %, 8 % and 12 % higher activities of respiratory terminal oxidases including CCO, AOX, PPO and AAO, respectively. However, DCC-treated longan presented 9 %, 27 %, 24 %, 25 % and 16 % lower levels of NADK, G-6-PDH + 6-PGDH, NADP, NADPH and Q, respectively. These data indicate that DCC-hastened longan pulp breakdown occurrence was owing to the diminished PPP, and the elevated EMP, TCA cycle and CCP, thereby leading to an increased respiration rate. However, DS treatment displayed contrary effects, indicating DS restrained longan pulp breakdown occurrence through diminishing the respiration metabolism and depressing the respiration rate of fresh longan."

      "abstract": "Osteoporosis, a common disorder, is characterized by a systemic reduction in bone mass and structural integrity, resulting in brittle bones. Reducing bone loss and enhancing bone density through oral administration of biopharmaceuticals provides significant advantages, including convenience and non-invasiveness for patients. However, challenges such as poor absorption and enzymatic degradation necessitate the development of innovative drug delivery systems. This research introduces a core-shell hydrogel system inspired by the natural architecture of Longan fruit, constructed from pectin and chitosan biopolymers, designed to create biocapsules and sustain the release of biodrugs. In this system, salmon calcitonin (sCT) was encapsulated within mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) and incorporated into the core of the beads. The synthesis of the core-shell hydrogel beads was carefully regulated by adjusting the immersion time and concentration of the crosslinker. The hydrogel beads demonstrated durability, with the pectin shell effectively preventing rapid degradation in the stomach, while the chitosan layer enhanced adhesion to the intestinal walls, safeguarded sCT, and enabled sustained drug release over an extended period of up to 30 h. Furthermore, biocompatibility tests indicated minimal cytotoxicity and hemolysis. Cellular uptake assays demonstrated that the core-shell beads effectively encapsulated sCT and ensured its prolonged release to CT-26 cells. This study presents a promising platform for oral sCT delivery, offering enhanced efficacy, patient compliance, and a potential replacement for injection-based therapies."

      "abstract": "Heat stress can seriously affect plant growth and development. Ethylene response factors (ERFs) play important roles in plant development and physiological responses. Here, we identified DlERF6, an ERF family transcription factor that promotes heat tolerance in Dimocarpus longan. DlERF6 was strongly induced by heat stress and IAA treatment in longan roots. Overexpression of DlERF6 generated abundant, fast-growing hairy roots and enhanced longan heat stress tolerance by promoting IAA biosynthesis and reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging. Additional assays indicated that DlERF6 directly binds to the DlGH3.5 promoter and represses its expression. Overexpressing DlGH3.5 reduced hairy root number, root length, and heat tolerance, concomitant with a reduction in IAA content and ROS scavenging. Collectively, these results reveal the molecular mechanism through which the DlERF6-DlGH3.5 module regulates root growth and heat stress tolerance, providing a gene network that can be used for the genetic improvement of longan.",

      "abstract": "Dimocarpus longan Lour. is an evergreen tree of the genus Longan in the Sapindaceae family, native to tropical and subtropical regions. Longan embryonic development is closely related to fruit set and fruit quality. An in-depth study of the mechanism of longan embryonic development could therefore contribute to the development of the longan industry. DIMBOA is the principal compound representing benzoxazinoids (BXs), and is closely linked to auxin biosynthesis and signal transduction. Auxin is one of the crucial hormones for inducing somatic embryogenesis (SE) in plants. Previous research has shown that DIMBOA promotes morphogenesis in the early somatic embryogenesis of longan, but the specific regulatory mechanism has not yet been clarified. To elucidate the molecular mechanism by which DIMBOA affects early somatic embryogenesis in longan, we chose longan embryogenic cultures grown under 0 mg/L DIMBOA as the control group (the check, CK), and longan embryogenic cultures grown under 0.1 mg/L DIMBOA as the treatment group (D) to be analyzed by transcriptomic sequencing. A total of 478 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) are detected in check vs. D, of which 193 are upregulated and 285 are downregulated. These DEGs are significantly enriched in the biosynthetic and metabolic functions of various substances such as vitamin B6 (VB6) biosynthesis, phenylpropanoid pathways, and carbohydrate metabolism. DIMBOA affects SE processes in longan via TFs, including MYB, ZF, bHLH, LBD, NAC, WRKY, etc. After DIMBOA treatment, the expression of most of the key genes for IAA synthesis was significantly downregulated, VB6 content was significantly reduced, and H2O2 content was significantly increased. Therefore, it is suggested that DIMBOA directly or indirectly affects the H2O2 content through the VB6 metabolic pathway, thereby regulating the endogenous IAA level to modulate the early SE morphogenesis of longan."

      "abstract": "ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Alzheimer's disease (AD) belongs to the category of \"forgetfulness\" or \"dementia\" in traditional Chinese medicine, and is often caused by deficiency of five zang-viscera. Longan Aril (the aril of Dimocarpus longan Lour., LA) possesses properties beneficial for heart and spleen health, blood nourishment, and mind tranquility, suggesting its potential as a treatment for AD. This study aimed to investigate the therapeutic effects of Longan Aril polysaccharides (LAPs), a primary active constituent of LA, on lipopolysaccharides (LPS) and amyloid β-peptide (Aβ) induced immune tolerance in AD mice. Further, BV2 cells were employed to explore the mechanism of LAPs in improving immune tolerance. MATERIAL AND METHODS: LAPs were prepared by water extraction and alcohol precipitation. The monosaccharide composition was determined by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). An AD mouse model of immune tolerance was established by intraperitoneal (i.p) injection of LPS combined with intracerebroventricular (ICV) injection of Aβ25-35. The LAPs group mice received LAPs (1.4 g/kg) daily for 40 days. The anti-AD efficacy and mechanism of LAPs in vivo was evaluated by the Y maze, Morris water maze, Degenerating Neurons Stain (FJC staining), hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) staining, Nissl staining, measurements of lactate, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-10 (IL-10) secretion levels, immunofluorescence and western blot. Furthermore, the mechanism of LAPs in improving the function of immune-tolerant BV2 cells was explored in vitro using lactic acid kits, ELISA kits, and western blot. The phagocytic function of BV2 cells was evaluated by the fluorescent dye Alexa Fluor 488 labeled Aβ (AF448-Aβ). RESULTS: LAPs contained five monosaccharides. LAPs improved cognitive function and increased the number of Nissl bodies, lactate secretion, the IL-10 content, the relative fluorescence intensity of the IBA1 and AXL proteins, and the protein expression levels of AXL, Mertk, Glut1, HK2, PI3K, p-Akt/Akt, p-mTOR/mTOR and HIF-1α of immune-tolerant AD mice. LAPs also reduced the TNF-α content, and the protein expression level of CD68 in immune-tolerant AD mice. In vitro, LAPs elevated the IL-10 content and protein expression levels of PI3K, Akt, p-Akt, and HIF-1α, while reducing lactate secretion and the TNF-α content in immune-tolerant BV2 cells. LAPs promoted the phagocytic activity of BV2 cells, and their effects are completely inhibited by 2-DG and partially inhibited by BAY and Rapa. CONCLUSIONS: LAPs can enhance the cognitive abilities of immune-tolerant AD mice and diminish their pathological damage. The mechanism involves the regulation of glycolysis and the PI3K/Akt/mTOR/HIF-1α signaling pathway to promote microglial immune phagocytosis.",

      "abstract": "PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The massive processing of longan fruit consequently generates a significant quantity of by-products that are a nuisance to the environment. This review aims to tap these by-products for sustainable applications in treating hepatic diseases. RECENT FINDINGS: Ethnobotanical investigations show that longan fruit has been utilized in liver functioning for over two millennia and is supported by contemporary scientific findings. Recent studies highlighted that these by-products contain bioactive compounds that decrease oxidative stress and inflammation, key drivers of liver diseases, including liver fibrosis, hepatitis, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). These bioactive compounds modulate lipid metabolism, detoxification pathways, and oxidative stress-regulating metabolic pathways of hepatoprotection. In addition, using longan by-products provides a relatively more affordable nutraceutical substitute for synthetic pharmaceuticals. This literature revealed that polyphenolic compounds such as corilagin gallic acid, ellagic acid, and various flavonoids in longan by-products exhibit antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and immunomodulatory activities that benefit liver health through different pathways including unexplored mechanisms. However, this review recommends exploring the potential functional application of these by-products in food. It emphasizes the need for clinical validation of longan by-product therapies for liver diseases.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a chronic metabolic disease. The leaves of Dimocarpus longan Lour. (LYY), a well-known traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) with Guangxi national characteristics often used in simple recipes to treat DM has attracted increasing attention. In this study, we investigated the therapeutic effects of LYY in diabetic rats from a metabolomic perspective. METHODS: The type 2 diabetes (T2DM) rat model was induced by a high-sugar and high-fat diet (HSFD) combined with 40 mg/kg streptozotocin (STZ). After oral administration of LYY (10.7 g/kg) for 28 d, their weight, fasted blood glucose (FBG), blood lipid levels, and inflammatory factors were assessed. The feces, urine, and serum samples of the rats were collected, and proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H-NMR) technology was used to explore the changes in the sample's metabolism spectrum and analyze the relevant targeted metabolic pathways. RESULTS: Compared with the diabetes group, LYY rats significantly delayed the reduction of body weight and decreased the FBG level (P <0.01); the levels of total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), and low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C), IL-6, and TNF-α in serum significantly reduced (P < 0.05, 0.01), and the level of high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) significantly increased (P < 0.01). 2 candidate biomarkers were identified from feces samples, and 4 associated metabolic pathways were discovered. 13 potential biomarkers were screened from urine samples, leading to the identification of 16 related metabolic pathways. Similarly, 5 potential biomarkers were screened from serum samples, and 11 related metabolic pathways were found. CONCLUSION: LYY can regulate the metabolic disorder caused by T2DM by regulating amino acid metabolism, amino acid synthesis, and tricarboxylic acid cycle, which provides a specific reference for the clinical treatment of T2DM."

For this purpose, a total of 300 healthy fish (average initial weight: 13.70 ± 0.06 g) were randomly distributed into five experimental treatment groups: 0 g kg-1 (LP0), 10 g kg-1 (LP10), 20 g kg-1 (LP20), 40 g kg-1 (LP40), and 80 g kg-1 (LP80), all in triplicate, for 60 days. The results indicated that dietary supplementation with LP exhibited a significant influence (P < 0.05) in weight gain (WG), specific growth rate (SGR) and provided a better feed conversion ratio (FCR) in contrast to the control group (0 g kg-1 LP). Moreover, skin mucus and serum immune parameters (lysozyme and peroxidase activity) were significantly higher (P < 0.05) in fish fed with different LP concentrations at both 4 and 8 weeks. Similarly, analysis of mRNA transcripts of immune (IL-1, IL-8, and LBP) and antioxidant (GSTa, GPX, and GSR) gene expressions showed a significant upregulation (P < 0.05) in LP-fed diet groups compared to the control group. Based on the polynomial regression analysis the inclusion of LP at 46-49 g kg-1 can be used effectively in Nile tilapia diets for improving the growth, immunity, and immune-antioxidant gene expressions. All in all, our results prove that LP is a very promising feed supplement for the Nile tilapia in the context of aquaculture."

      "abstract": "SO2 fumigation treatment (commonly known as sulfur treatment, ST) is a key method in the postharvest preservation of imported and exported fresh longan fruits, effectively reducing pericarp browning and enhancing color. Nonetheless, distinctive aromas, often referred to as \"sulfur flavor\", may develop in the aril during the extended preservation period. This study employed \"Caopu\" longan as the test material and patented SO2-releasing paper (ZL201610227848.7) as a treatment to perform a 35-day low-temperature (5 °C) storage of the fruit. The changes in glucosinolates (GSLs) and associated metabolites in the aril of treated fruit (ST) were examined utilizing ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) detection and widely targeted metabolomics technology. The findings indicated that following 35 days of storage, nearly all control (CK) fruit pericarp turned to brown, resulting in an edible fruit rate of 75.41% and a commercial fruit rate of 0%. In contrast, the treated (ST) fruit demonstrated an edible fruit rate and a commercial rate of 99.44%, while the pericarp color changed from dark yellow-brown to light earthy yellow. The sulfur-containing metabolites identified in longan fruit aril predominantly consist of amino acids and their derivatives (60.44%), followed by alkaloids (15.38%), nucleotides and their derivatives (1.10%), and other types (23.08%), which include GSLs. SO2 treatment significantly reduced the content of oxidized glutathione in fruit aril but increased the content of GSLs and related amino acids and their derivatives. Via screening, 19 differential sulfur-containing metabolites were obtained between ST and CK, including 11 GSLs. The identified differential metabolites of GSLs were all increased, primarily comprising aliphatic GSLs, such as 1-hydroxymethyl glucosinolate, 2-Propenyl glucosinolate (Sinigrin), and 4-Methylsulfinylbutyl glucosinolate (Glucoraphanin). Pathway analysis showed that these differential metabolites were mainly involved in coenzyme factor synthesis, cysteine and methionine metabolism, and amino acid synthesis, among other pathways. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to reveal the causes of the special flavor of longan aril after SO2 treatment, which is a great concern for longan consumers. Moreover, this study provides a scientific basis for exploring the reasons and mechanisms for the development of the sulfur flavor in the SO2-treated fruits during postharvest storage."

      "abstract": "Although it has been established that polysaccharides have an effect on bone marrow haematopoiesis, it remains unclear how polysaccharides regulate bone marrow haematopoiesis during absorption and metabolism in vivo. In this study, the effect of a longan polysaccharide of large molecular weight (TLPL) on the gut microbiota of mice and its implications for the haematopoietic process in bone marrow was discussed. Here, the results show that after 21 days of TLPL consumption, the respective quantities of white blood cells, platelets, hemoglobin and bone marrow nucleated cells were determined to be 3.18 ± 1.71 (109 L-1), 1238.10 ± 164.41 (109 L-1), 135.10 ± 4.95 (g L-1), and 1.70 × 107, which reached 56.98%, 117.28%, and 47.74%, respectively, of the results for NC. TLPL both increased the thymus and spleen indexes by up to 2.08 ± 0.64 (mg g-1) and 6.49 ± 2.45 (mg g-1), respectively. Additionally, TLPL remodeled the gut microbiota with a significant increase in Lactobacillus in particular, and a significant increase in the level of the potential intestinal metabolite lactate was detected in the serum. Most importantly, a similarly significant up-regulation of the gene expression of the lactate receptor, Gpr81, in the myeloid cells was observed. These changes contributed to the activation of the secretion of various cytokines associated with haematopoiesis, with the levels of G-CSF, EPO, SCF and PF4 increased by 2.44 times, 1.14 times, 1.56 times and 1.13 times, respectively, compared to the MC group, which subsequently accelerated production of bone marrow cells and blood cells. The findings of this study reveal the unique mechanism of dried longan polysaccharides in ameliorating myelosuppression and provide a feasible strategy for the treatment of chemotherapy-induced myelosuppression with bioactive polysaccharides.",

      "abstract": "Harvested longan fruit is prone to pericarp browning, which restricts preservation quality and shortens fruit shelf life. The antioxidant system can defend against oxidative stress-mediated quality deterioration such as fruit browning. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of tert-butylhydroquinone (TBHQ) on anti-browning ability of longan fruit in association with redox metabolism. The results indicated that the application of 0.02% TBHQ significantly suppressed the progression of pericarp browning. In comparison with control, TBHQ treatment decreased the contents of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), superoxide radical (O2 -⋅), and malondialdehyde, and retained high levels of ascorbic acid (AsA), glutathione (GSH), total phenolics as well as 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl scavenging rate. Enhanced enzymatic activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), ascorbate peroxidase (APX), glutathione reductase (GR), monodehydroascorbate reductase, and dehydroascorbate reductase (DHAR), but decreased activities of polyphenol oxidase and peroxidase were also observed in TBHQ-treated fruit. Gene expression analysis indicated that redox metabolism-related genes, including DlSOD, DlCAT, DlGR, and DlAPX, were upregulated after TBHQ treatment. Correlation analysis suggested that antioxidants, including AsA, GSH, CAT, APX, SOD, and DHAR, were negatively correlated to reactive oxygen species production and percarp browning. These results suggest that TBHQ is effective in alleviating pericarp browning by increasing antioxidant capacity of longan fruit.",

      "abstract": "Compared to control longan, DCC-treated longan had higher pulp breakdown index, lower ATP, ADP and EC levels, and lower H+, Ca2+ and Mg2+-ATPase activities. On day 6, DCC-treated longan presented 18% higher pulp breakdown index, with 44%, 9% and 31% lower levels of ATP, ADP and EC, respectively. Additionally, DCC-treated longan showed 29%, 53%, 37% lower activity of H+-ATPase, 34%, 54%, 4% lower activity of Ca2+-ATPase, and 13%, 21%, 6% lower activity of Mg2+-ATPase in the membranes of plasma, vacuole, and mitochondria, respectively. Whereas, DS-treated longan manifested the opposite trends of DCC treatment. These results suggest that the accelerated pulp breakdown in DCC-treated longan was linked to energy deficiency and reduced energy production. However, DS treatment restrained pulp breakdown occurrence in fresh longan by maintaining a higher energy level through the elevated energy production and ATPase activity."

Additionally, DNP treatment increased the levels of PLD, lipase, LOX, PA, and SFA, and decreased the values of PC, PI, USFA, U/S, and IUFA, displaying higher cell membrane permeability and more severe cell membrane damage in longan pulp. Furthermore, DNP treatment weakened the levels of SOD, CAT, APX, AsA, GSH, TP, and TF, thereby exacerbating ROS outbreak and MDA production. These results indicate that DNP treatment destroyed the antioxidant system to cause ROS eruption. This disruption further disturbed the metabolisms of membrane lipids and cell wall polysaccharides, leading to the breakdown of cell membrane and cell wall, and eventually aggravated longan pulp softening and breakdown.

      "abstract": "Longan (Dimcarpus longan Lour.) is a kind of traditional fruit used as a medicine and a food. Fresh longan is primarily consumed as a fruit, whereas dried longan is commonly employed for medicinal purposes. The differences in the immunomodulatory activities and mechanisms of polysaccharides between dried and fresh longan remain unclear. The present study comparatively analyzed the mechanisms of macrophage activation induced by polysaccharides from dried (LPG) and fresh longan (LPX). The results revealed that LPG and LPX differentially promoted macrophage phagocytosis and the secretion of NO, TNF-α, and IL-6. RNA-seq analysis revealed that LPG and LPX differentially affected gene expression in macrophages. The LPG treatment identified Tnf and chemokine-related genes as core genes, while myd88 and interferon-related genes were the core genes affected by LPX. A comprehensive analysis of the differentially expressed genes showed that LPG initiated macrophage activation primarily through the TLR2/4-mediated TRAM/TRAF6 and CLR-mediated Src/Raf1 NF-κB signaling pathways. LPX initiated macrophage activation predominantly via the CLR-mediated Bcl10/MALT1 and NLR-mediated Rip2/TAK1 MAPK and NF-κB signaling pathways. Interestingly, the non-classical NF-κB signaling pathway was activated by polysaccharides in both dried and fresh longan to elicit a slow, mild immune response. LPG tends to promote immune cell migration to engage in the immune response, while LPX facilitates antigen presentation to promote T cell activation. These findings contribute insights into the mechanisms underlying the differences in bioactivity between dried and fresh longan and their potential applications in immune-enhancing strategies and functional-food development.",

Auxin is essential in the process of somatic embryogenesis (SE) in plants. In this study, we used bioinformatics, transcriptome data, exogenous treatment experiments, and qPCR analysis to study the evolutionary pattern of Bx genes in green plants, the regulatory mechanism of DlBx genes during early SE, and the effect of 2,4-dihydroxy-7-methoxy-1,4-benzoxazine-3-one (DIMBOA) on the early SE in Dimocarpus longan Lour. The results showed that 27 putative DlBxs were identified in the longan genome; the Bx genes evolved independently in monocots and dicots, and the main way of gene duplication for the DlBx was tandem duplication (TD) and the DlBx were strongly constrained by purification selection during evolution. The transcriptome data indicated varying expression levels of DlBx during longan early SE, and most DlBxs responded to light, temperature, drought stress, and 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) treatment; qRT-PCR results showed DlBx1, DlBx6g and DlBx6h were responsive to auxin, and treatment with 0.1mg/L DIMBOA for 9 days significantly upregulated the expression levels of DlBx1, DlBx3g, DlBx6c, DlBx6f, DlB6h, DlBx7d, DlBx8, and DlBx9b. The correlation analysis showed a significantly negative correlation between the expression level of DlBx1 and the endogenous IAA contents; DIMBOA significantly promoted the early SE and significantly changed the endogenous IAA content, and the IAA content increased significantly at the 9th day and decreased significantly at the 13th day. Therefore, the results suggested that DIMBOA indirectly promote the early SE by changing the endogenous IAA content via affecting the expression level of DlBx1 and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) content in longan."

Chemical prevention and control are very effective for production; therefore, it is crucial to study fate assessment and appropriate field efficacy before pesticide application on crops to appropriately assess the health and ecological risks linked with these agents. This study conducted Good Agricultural Practice (GAP) field trials and laboratory experiments to elucidate the dissipation, terminal residues, and efficacy of methoxyfenozide on litchi and longan in six locations throughout China. To detect methoxyfenozide residues on litchi and longan, a QuEChERS/UPLC-MS/MS-based method was designed. The initial methoxyfenozide levels in litchi and longan ranged from 2.21-2.86 to 0.83-0.95 mg kg-1 and indicated half-lives of 5.1-5.3 and 5.3-5.7 days, respectively. After 7 days of foliage treatment, the concentrations of terminal methoxyfenozide residue were 0.78-2.61 and 0.02-1.01 mg kg-1, which were less than the established maximum residue limit for methoxyfenozide in litchi and longan. The chronic (acceptable daily intake = 0.0055-0.0331%) dietary intake risk analysis for methoxyfenozide in longan and litchi indicated acceptable concentrations of terminal residue for the general population. Methoxyfenozide in litchi and longan was readily degraded in first-order kinetics models, the degradation rate on longan was higher than that on litchi, and their dietary risks were negligible to consumers. Two hundred forty grams per liter of methoxyfenozide suspension concentrate (SC) represents a highly efficacious insecticidal dose to control litchi and longan pests and indicates a significant application potential as it is rapidly degraded and linked with reduced post-treatment residue levels.",

However, studies on hormonal regulatory pathways and functional analysis during somatic embryogenesis (SE) in Dimocarpus longan is still unavailable. In this study, a total of 51 bZIP family members were systematically identified in the whole genome of longan, a comprehensive bioinformatics analysis of DlbZIP (bZIP family members of D. longan) was performed, and subcellular localization and profiles patterns after transiently transformed DlbZIP60 were analyzed. The combined analysis of RNA-seq, ATAC-seq and ChIP-seq showed that four members have different H3K4me1 binding peaks in early SE and differentially expressed with increased chromatin accessibility. Comparative transcriptome analysis of bZIPs expression in early SE, different tissues and under 2,4-D treatment revealed that DlbZIP family might involved in growth and development during longan early SE. The qRT-PCR results implied that DlbZIP family were subjected to multiple hormonal responses and showed different degrees of up-regulated expression under indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), abscisic acid (ABA) and methyl jasmonate (MeJA) treatments, which indicated that they played an important role in the hormone synthesis pathways associated with the early SE of longan. Subcellular localization showed that DlbZIP60 was located in the nucleus, and the contents of endogenous IAA, MeJA and ABA were up-regulated in transiently DlbZIP60 overexpressed cell lines. These results suggest that DlbZIP60 may mediate hormones pathways that functions the development during early SE in longan."

      "abstract": "GATA transcription factors, which are DNA-binding proteins with type IV zinc finger binding domains, have a role in transcriptional regulation in biological organisms. They have an indispensable role in the growth and development of plants, as well as in improvements in their ability to face various environmental stresses. To date, GATAs have been identified in many gene families, but the GATA gene in longan (Dimocarpus longan Lour) has not been studied in previous explorations. Various aspects of genes in the longan GATA family, including their identification and classification, the distribution of their positions on chromosomes, their exon/intron structures, a synteny analysis, their expression at different temperatures, concentration of PEG, early developmental stages of somatic embryos and their expression levels in different tissues, and concentrations of exogenous hormones, were investigated in this study. This study showed that the 22 DlGATAs could be divided into four subfamilies. There were 10 pairs of homologous GATA genes in the synteny analysis of DlGATA and AtGATA. Four segmental replication motifs and one pair of tandem duplication events were present among the DlGATA family members. The cis-acting elements located in promoter regions were also found to be enriched with light-responsive elements, which contained related hormone-responsive elements. In somatic embryos, DlGATA4 is upregulated for expression at the globular embryo (GE) stage. We also found that DlGATA expression was strongly up-regulated in roots and stems. The study demonstrated the expression of DlGATA under hormone (ABA and IAA) treatments in embryogenic callus of longan. Under ABA treatment, DlGATA4 was up-regulated and the other DlGATA genes did not respond significantly. Moreover, as demonstrated with qRT-PCR, the expression of DlGATA genes showed strong up-regulated expression levels under 100 μmol·L-1 concentration IAA treatment. This experiment further studied these and simulated their possible connections with a drought response mechanism, while correlating them with their expression under PEG treatment. Overall, this experiment explored the GATA genes and dug into their evolution, structure, function, and expression profile, thus providing more information for a more in-depth study of the characteristics of the GATA family of genes.",

In this study, the effect of GA3 spraying at different concentrations (10, 20, and 50 mg L-1) on the quality of on-tree preserved 'Shixia' longan was examined. Only 50 mg L-1 GA3 significantly delayed the decline of soluble solids (22.0% higher than the control) and resulted in higher total phenolics content (TPC), total flavonoid content (TFC), and phenylalanine ammonia-lyase activity in pulp at the later stages. The widely targeted metabolome analysis showed that the treatment reprogrammed secondary metabolites and up-regulated many tannins, phenolic acids, and lignans during the on-tree preservation. More importantly, the preharvest 50 mg L-1 GA3 spraying (at 85 and 95 days after flowering) led to significantly delayed pericarp browning and aril breakdown, as well as lower pericarp relative conductivity and mass loss at the later stages of room-temperature storage. The treatment also resulted in higher antioxidants in pulp (vitamin C, phenolics, and reduced glutathione) and pericarp (vitamin C, flavonoids, and phenolics). Therefore, preharvest 50 mg L-1 GA3 spraying is an effective method for maintaining the quality and up-regulating antioxidants of longan fruit during both on-tree preservation and room-temperature storage."

      "abstract": "Longan (Dimocarpus longan Lour.) is an economically important subtropical fruit tree. Its fruit quality and yield are affected by embryo development. As a plant seed germination marker gene, the germin-like protein (GLP) gene plays an important role in embryo development. However, the mechanism underlying the role of the GLP gene in somatic embryos is still unclear. Therefore, we conducted genome-wide identification of the longan GLP (DlGLP) gene and preliminarily verified the function of DlGLP1-5-1. Thirty-five genes were identified as longan GLP genes and divided into 8 subfamilies. Based on transcriptome data and qRT‒PCR results, DlGLP genes exhibited the highest expression levels in the root, and the expression of most DlGLPs was upregulated during the early somatic embryogenesis (SE) in longan and responded to high temperature stress and 2,4-D treatment; eight DlGLP genes were upregulated under MeJA treatment, and four of them were downregulated under ABA treatment. Subcellular localization showed that DlGLP5-8-2 and DlGLP1-5-1 were located in the cytoplasm and extracellular stroma/chloroplast, respectively. Overexpression of DIGLP1-5-1 in the globular embryos (GEs) of longan promoted the accumulation of lignin and decreased the H2O2 content by regulating the activities of ROS-related enzymes. The results provide a reference for the functional analysis of DlGLPs and related research on improving lignin accumulation in the agricultural industry through genetic engineering.",

We hypothesized that ε-poly-l-lysine (ε-PL) could enhance fruit disease resistance in longans. Through physiological and transcriptomic analyses, the results showed that, compared to P. longanae-infected longan fruit, ε-PL + P. longanae treatment reduced the disease development of longan fruits. Additionally, ε-PL + P. longanae treatment increased the contents of disease-resistant substances (lignin and H2O2) and the activities of disease-resistance enzymes (CHI, PAL, PPO, C4H, CAD, GLU, 4CL, and POD). Furthermore, the expressions of genes relevant to the phenylpropanoid biosynthesis pathway and plant-pathogen interaction pathway (Rboh, FLS2, WRKY29, FRK1, and PR1) were up-regulated by ε-PL + P. longanae treatment. These findings demonstrated that ε-PL treatment inhibited the disease development of postharvest longan fruits were associated with the increased accumulation of disease-resistant related substances, as well as the raised activities and genes expressions of disease-resistance related enzymes.",

      "abstract": "In the process of longan production and processing, a large amount of remnants is produced, such as dried longan pericarps and seeds, which have been reported to be rich in polyphenols but not effectively utilized. In this paper, the total phenolic contents in the remnants of longan pericarps and seeds were found to be 39.58 ± 3.54 and 69.53 ± 1.99 mg/g (DW), respectively, accounting for 60-80% of those in fresh samples. The contents of extractable condensed tannins (ECTs) in the remnants of longan pericarps and seeds were 19.25 ± 6.71 mg/g (DW) and 44.59 ± 2.05 mg/g (DW), respectively, accounting for 60-70% of the fresh samples. These data indicate that the polyphenols in the remnants of the sampled longan pericarps and seeds were effectively retained. The antioxidant capacity of ECTs from the longan pericarps and seeds was more than 60% of the fresh samples measured with the 1, 1-diphenyl-2-trinitrophenylhydrazine and ferric reducing ability of plasma methods. Further exploration showed that ECTs from the longan pericarps and seeds had significant inhibitory effects on Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Salmonella and Staphylococcus aureus. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the longan pericarp ECTs on all four studied bacteria was 3 mg/mL. The MIC of longan seed ECTs on Salmonella was 3 mg/mL, and that of the other three bacteria was 1.5 mg/mL. In view of the good antioxidant and antibacterial activities of longan pericarps and seeds, we applied them to the preservation of fresh-cut lotus roots. When the concentration of ECTs in the longan pericarps and seeds was 2 mg/mL and 1 mg/mL, respectively, the two kinds of ECTs showed an obvious preservative effect. After the ECT treatment of the lotus roots, their browning degree was reduced, their color was better maintained, their respiration was inhibited and their nutrient loss was reduced. Bacterial reproduction was inhibited, and cell senescence was slowed. Accordingly, the shelf life of ECT-treated fruits and vegetables can be effectively extended. Overall, we can suggest that ECTs from the remnants of dried longan pericarps and seeds could be used as natural preservatives for fresh-cut fruits and vegetables."

      "abstract": "The early auxin responsive small auxin up-regulated RNA (SAUR) family is an important gene family in the auxin signal transduction pathway. This study focused on the regulatory mechanism of DlSAUR genes during early somatic embryogenesis (SE) and its response to hormone treatment and abiotic stress. Mining of the available Dimocarpus longan Lour. (D. longan) genome sequence yielded 68 putative SAUR genes. Transcript profiles based on RNA-seq data showed that most of the 24 detected DlSAUR genes were highly expressed in the globular embryos (GE) (10) and most of them responded to heat stress and 2,4-D treatment. The results of qRT-PCR showed that most of DlSAUR genes were up-regulated under auxin inhibitor N-1-naphthylphthalamic acid (NPA) and auxin indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) treatments. Moreover, NPA could promote longan SE. The assay for ATAC-seq data analysis showed that chromatin accessibility of 19 of the 24 DlSAUR genes were open during early SE, and most DlSAUR genes differentially expressed during early SE were not associated with H3K4me1 signal enrichment. The DlSAUR32 was selected for subcellular localization and RNA-seq analysis, which encode a cell nuclear-localized protein. Dual-luciferase assays and transient transformation showed that the transcription factors (TFs) DlWRKY75-1 and DlWRKY75-2 might bind to the DlSAUR32 promoters to inhibition gene transcription. Transient overexpression of DlWRKY75-1 and DlWRKY75-2 decreased IAA content in N. benthamiana leaves. Thus, the regulatory network composed of DlSAUR32 and its related TFs may regulate the early longan SE and be involved in the auxin response regulatory pathway of longan.",

In this study, four-year-old 'Shixia' longan trees were injected in the trunk with potassium chlorate, and terminal buds were sampled and analyzed using transcriptomics and bioinformatics tools. To generate a reference longan transcriptome, we obtained 207,734 paired-end reads covering a total of 58,514,149 bp, which we assembled into 114,445 unigenes. Using this resource, we identified 3,265 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) that were regulated in longan terminal buds in response to potassium chlorate treatment for 2, 6 or 30 days, including 179 transcription factor genes. By reference to the Arabidopsis literature, we then defined 38 longan genes involved in flowering, from which we constructed the longan flowering pathway. According to RNA-seq data, at least 24 of these genes, which participate in multiple signaling pathways, are involved in potassium chlorate-stimulated floral induction, and the differential regulation in terminal buds of ten floral pathway genes (GI, CO, GID1, GA4, GA5, FLC, AP1, LFY, FT and SOC1) was confirmed by qRT-PCR. These data will contribute to an improved understanding of the functions of key genes involved in longan floral induction by potassium chlorate."

Previous studies have shown that LongShengZhi (LSZ) capsule can improve neurological outcomes in patients after AIS, yet those results have not been finally verified through rigorous randomized controlled trials. Thus, this trial was designed to further clarify the efficacy and safety of LSZ capsule for patients with AIS. Methods: LSZ capsule on Functional Recovery after Acute Ischemic Stroke (LONGAN) trial is a prospective, multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel-group, superiority trial that enrolls patients from stroke and rehabilitation units in China. We will enroll 1,376 patients aged 18 years or older with AIS within 7 days of symptom onset and a National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score of 4-15. Eligible patients will be randomized to receive either 2 g LSZ capsules three times a day or placebo LSZ capsules for 90 days. The primary outcome is the proportion of patients with favorable outcomes, as measured by the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) 90 days after randomization. The main safety outcome is the proportion of severe adverse events. Conclusion: This study will be the first randomized, double-blind trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of LSZ capsule in patients with AIS. In order to improve the transparency and reproducibility of the trial, the data will be analyzed in accordance with this pre-specified plan for statistical analysis to reduce bias due to selective analysis and reporting. This trial aims to provide high-quality evidence for the efficacy and safety of LSZ capsule for AIS."

(also called as longan) is a subtropical and tropical evergreen tree belonging to the Sapindaceae family and is widely distributed in China, Southeast Asia and South Asia. The pulp of longan fruit is a time-honored traditional medicinal and edible raw material in China and some Asian countries. With the advancement of food therapy in modern medicine, longan fruit pulp as an edible medicinal material is expected to usher in its rapid development as a functional nutrient. As one of the main constituents of longan fruit pulp, longan fruit pulp polysaccharides (LPs) play an indispensable role in longan fruit pulp-based functional utilization. This review aims to outline the extraction and purification methods, structural characteristics and biological activities (such as immunoregulatory, anti-tumor, prebiotic, anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory and inhibition of AChE activity) of LPs. Besides, the structure-activity relationship, application prospect and patent application of LPs were analyzed and summarized. Through the systematic summary, this review attempts to provide a theoretical basis for further research of LPs, and promote the industrial development of this class of polysaccharides."

On the contrary, ATP treatment for P. longanae-infected longan exhibited opposite effects. The above results imply that DNP accelerated P. longanae-induced pulp softening and breakdown of fresh longan, which was because DNP up-regulated the transcript levels of CWDEs-related genes, enhanced the CWDEs activities, and accelerated the degradation of cell wall polysaccharides (CWP). However, ATP suppressed longan pulp softening and breakdown caused by P. longanae, because ATP down-regulated the transcript levels of CWDEs-related genes, lowered the CWDEs activities, and reduced the CWP degradation.",

      "abstract": "The aims of this study were to evaluate the biological activities of black Dimocarpus longan Lour. seed extracts and develop a lamellar liquid crystal (LLC). Different solvents, including petroleum ether, ethyl acetate, and 95% v/v ethanol, were used in the maceration of black D. longan seeds. The inhibitory activities on matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1) and hyaluronidase were evaluated. The irritating potency of D. longan seed extracts was determined using the hen's egg chorioallantoic membrane test. The extract with the strongest anti-ageing activities and no irritant impact was examined for its chemical contents using high-performance liquid chromatography and incorporated into the LLC. Various factors affecting the LLC formulations, including surfactant types and amounts, thickening agent types and amounts, and various oil types, were investigated. The results demonstrated that the ethyl acetate extract (EtOAc) was the most potent inhibitor of MMP-1 (IC50 = 21.7 ± 5.4 µg/mL) and hyaluronidase (oleanolic acid equivalent = 0.44 ± 0.03 g per g extract). Interestingly, its MMP-1 inhibition was equivalent to that of oleanolic acid, corilagin, and gallic acid. Furthermore, its hyaluronidase inhibition was equivalent to that of gallic acid and ellagic acid. Gallic acid, which was the most abundant compound (15.6% ± 0.06% w/w) was suggested as the compound responsible for the biological activities of EtOAc extract. Considering its potential anti-skin ageing properties with no irritation of EtOAc extract, it was incorporated into the most suitable LLC, which was composed of 5% w/w Lexfeel® D5 oil, 0.5% w/w Carbopol® U21, 2% w/w Liquid Crystal Cream Maker, and 92.5% w/w DI water. The LLC containing EtOAc extract presented birefringence under a polarizing light microscope, indicating its crystallinity. The formulation had good stability after heating-cooling cycles in terms of external appearance, crystallinity, viscosity, and pH (5.5). As a result, it is recommended as a potential cosmeceutical formulation for anti-skin wrinkling. It is proposed that more research be conducted on the safety and efficacy of the treatment on human volunteers.",

      "abstract": "Longan (Dimocarpus longan Lour.) is a productive fruit crop with high nutritional and medical value in tropical and subtropical regions. The MYB gene family is one of the most widespread plant transcription factor (TF) families participating in the flowering regulation. However, little is known about the MYB TFs involved in the flowering process in longan and its regulatory network. In this study, a total of 119 DlR2R3-MYB genes were identified in the longan genome and were phylogenetically grouped into 28 subgroups. The groupings were supported by highly conserved gene structures and motif composition of DlR2R3-MYB genes in each subgroup. Collinearity analysis demonstrated that segmental replications played a more crucial role in the expansion of the DlR2R3-MYB gene family compared to tandem duplications, and all tandem/segmental duplication gene pairs have evolved under purifying selection. Interspecies synteny analysis among longan and five representative species implied the occurrence of gene duplication events was one of the reasons contributing to functional differentiation among species. RNA-seq data from various tissues showed DlR2R3-MYB genes displayed tissue-preferential expression patterns. The pathway of flower development was enriched with six DlR2R3-MYB genes. Cis-acting element prediction revealed the putative functions of DlR2R3-MYB genes were related to the plant development, phytohormones, and environmental stresses. Notably, the orthologous counterparts between Arabidopsis and longan R2R3-MYB members tended to play conserved roles in the flowering regulation and stress responses. Transcriptome profiling on off-season flower induction (FI) by KClO3 indicated two up-regulated and four down-regulated DlR2R3-MYB genes involved in the response to KClO3 treatment compared with control groups. Additionally, qRT-PCR confirmed certain genes exhibited high expression in flowers/flower buds. Subcellular localization experiments revealed that three predicted flowering-associated MYB proteins were localized in the nucleus. Future functional studies on these potential candidate genes involved in the flowering development could further the understanding of the flowering regulation mechanism."

A completely randomized design (CRD) with three replications was utilised. The growth performance and immune response were measured at weeks 4 and 8 post feeding, while the gene expressions were determined at the end of the feeding trial. The results revealed that administration of LS could significantly (P < 0.05) improve specific growth rate (SGR), weight gain (WG), and feed conversion ratio (FCR) in Nile tilapia as compared to the control group. However, no significant differences (P > 0.05) were observed in survival rates among treatments. LS-supplemented diets showed enhanced serum peroxidase activity (SPA), serum lysozyme activity (SLA), skin mucus lysozyme activity (MLA), and skin mucus peroxidase activity (MPA) at weeks 4 and 8 post-feeding, with the highest values observed in the LS20 diet (P < 0.05). Additionally, LS-supplemented diets significantly up-regulated (P < 0.05) immune and antioxidant related gene expressions (IL1, IL8, LBP, GSTa, GPX, and GSR) in the liver and intestine, with highest values observed in the LS20 treatment.

      "abstract": "ε-poly-l-lysine (ε-PL) holds a strong antibacterial property and is widely used for food preservation. However, the application of ε-PL to enhance fruit disease resistance in postharvest longans (Dimocarpus longan Lour.) has not been explored. The objective of this study was to explore the impact of ε-PL treatment on disease occurrence and energy metabolism of longans infected with Phomopsis longanae Chi (P. longanae). It was found that, in comparison with P. longanae-inoculated longans, ε-PL could decrease the fruit disease index and adenosine monophosphate (AMP) content, increase the amounts of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), adenosine diphosphate (ADP), and energy charge, and enhance the activities of adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) (such as H+-, Mg2+-, and Ca2+-ATPase) in the mitochondria, protoplasm, and vacuole. The results suggest that the higher levels of ATPase activity and energy status played essential roles in disease resistance of postharvest longan fruit. Therefore, the ε-PL treatment can be used as a safe and efficient postharvest method to inhibit the disease occurrence of longan fruit during storage at room temperature."

      "abstract": "Polyamines (PAs) play an important regulatory role in many basic cellular processes and physiological and biochemical processes. However, there are few studies on the identification of PA biosynthesis and metabolism family members and the role of PAs in the transition of plant embryogenic calli (EC) into globular embryos (GE), especially in perennial woody plants. We identified 20 genes involved in PA biosynthesis and metabolism from the third-generation genome of longan (Dimocarpus longan Lour.). There were no significant differences between longan and other species regarding the number of members, and they had high similarity with Citrus sinensis. Light, plant hormones and a variety of stress cis-acting elements were found in these family members. The biosynthesis and metabolism of PAs in longan were mainly completed by DlADC2, DlSAMDC2, DlSAMDC3, DlSPDS1A, DlSPMS, DlCuAOB, DlCuAO3A, DlPAO2 and DlPAO4B. In addition, 0.01 mmol∙L-1 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC), putrescine (Put) and spermine (Spm), could promote the transformation of EC into GE, and Spm treatment had the best effect, while 0.01 mmol∙L-1 D-arginine (D-arg) treatment inhibited the process. The period between the 9th and 11th days was key for the transformation of EC into GE in longan. There were higher levels of gibberellin (GA), salicylic acid (SA) and abscisic acid (ABA) and lower levels of indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), ethylene and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in this key period. The expression levels in this period of DlADC2, DlODC, DlSPDS1A, DlCuAOB and DlPAO4B were upregulated, while those of DlSAMDC2 and DlSPMS were downregulated. These results showed that the exogenous ACC, D-arg and PAs could regulate the transformation of EC into GE in longan by changing the content of endogenous hormones and the expression levels of PA biosynthesis and metabolism genes. This study provided a foundation for further determining the physicochemical properties and molecular evolution characteristics of the PA biosynthesis and metabolism gene families, and explored the mechanism of PAs and ethylene for regulating the transformation of plant EC into GE.",

In this study, a total of 69 CCCs family members, including 37 CYCs, 20 CDKs, five E2F/DPs, three KRPs, two RBs, one CKS and one Wee1, were identified from the longan genome. Phylogenetic and motifs analysis showed the evolutionary conservation of CCCs. Transcriptome dataset showed that CCCs had various expression patterns during longan early somatic embryogenesis (SE). Either CKS or CYCD3;2 silencing increased the expression of RB-E2F pathway genes, and the silencing of CYCD3;2 might induce the process of apoptosis in longan embryogenic callus (EC) cells. In addition, The qRT-PCR results showed that the expression levels of CDKG2, CYCD3;2, CYCT1;2, CKS and KRP1 were elevated by ABA, 2,4-D and PEG4000 treatments, while CDKG2 and CYCT1;2 were inhibited by NaCl treatment. In conclusion, our study provided valuable information for understanding the characterization and biological functions of longan CCCs.",

Neem (Azadirachta indica) is a medicinal plant considered the tree of the 21st century. In this study, we investigated the antioxidant and antimicrobial effects of propyl disulfide (PD), a major volatile compound in neem seed, against the pericarp browning (BI), microbial decay incidence (DI), and water loss of longan fruit. Fresh longan cv. Shixia samples were packaged in oriented polypropylene (OPP) and polyethene (PE) packages of different thicknesses (20, 40, and 60 µm). Sterile gauze was fixed inside the packages and 500 uL of PD was placed on them to avoid the direct contact of PD with fruit samples. Packages were sealed immediately to minimize vaporization and stored at 12 ± 1 °C for 18 days. Fruit samples packaged in open net packages served as controls. The results showed that fruit treated with PD in OPP and PE packages significantly prevented losses of water, DI, and BI compared to control treatment. PD also maintained the color, TSS values, TA values, pH values, high peel firmness, high TPC content, and high TFC content, and reduced the activity levels of PPO and POD. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) analysis indicated that the exocarp, mesocarp, and endocarp of longan peel were smooth, uniform, and compact with no free space compared to control, where crakes, a damaged and loose structure, and a lot of fungal mycelia were found. The shortest shelf life of 9 days was observed in control as compared to 18 days in OPP-20 and OPP-40; 15 days in OPP-60, PE-20, and PE-40; and 12 days in PE-60 packaging films. Therefore, PD as a natural antioxidant and antimicrobial agent, in combination with OPP-20 and OPP-40 polymeric films, could successfully be applied commercially to extend the postharvest shelf life of longan."

MCM1, AGAMOUS, DEFICIENS, Serum Response Factor (MADS)-box transcription factor family plays important roles for the flowering time, floral organ identity, and fruit development in plants. However, there is no systematic information of MADS-box family in longan. In this study, 114 MADS-box genes were identified from the longan genome, phylogenetic analysis divided them into type I (Mα, Mβ, Mγ) and type II (MIKC*, MIKC C ) groups, and MIKC C genes were further clustered into 12 subfamilies. Comparative genomic analysis of 12 representative plant species revealed the conservation of type II in Sapindaceae and analysis of cis-elements revealed that Dof transcription factors might directly regulate the MIKC C genes. An ABCDE model was proposed for longan based on the phylogenetic analysis and expression patterns of MADS-box genes. Transcriptome analysis revealed that MIKC C genes showed wide expression spectrums, particularly in reproductive organs. From 35 days after KClO3 treatment, 11 MIKC genes were up-regulated, suggesting a crucial role in off-season flower induction, while DlFLC, DlSOC1, DlSVP, and DlSVP-LIKE may act as the inhibitors. The gene expression patterns of longan fruit development indicated that DlSTK, DlSEP1/2, and DlMADS53 could be involved in fruit growth and ripening. This paper carried out the whole genome identification and analysis of the longan MADS-box family for the first time, which provides new insights for further understanding its function in flowers and fruit."

In this study, the effect of 0.4 mM melatonin (MLT) dipping on the quality and pericarp browning of longan fruits stored at low temperature was investigated. The MLT treatment did not influence the TSS content of longan fruits but lead to increased lightness and h° value while decreased a* value of pericarp. More importantly, the treatment significantly delayed the increase in electrolyte leakage and malonaldehyde accumulation, inhibited the activities of polyphenol oxidase and peroxidase, and thus retarded pericarp browning. In addition, the treatment significantly inhibited the production of O2 •- and H2O2 while promoted the accumulation of glutathione, flavonoids, and phenolics at earlier storage stages in longan pericarp. Interestingly, the activities of ascorbate peroxidase (APX) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) were significantly upregulated but activities of catalase were downregulated in the MLT-treated longan pericarp. MLT treatment effectively enhanced APX and SOD activities, increased flavonoid, phenolics, and glutathione content, protected cytomembrane integrity, inhibited the production of O2 •- and H2O2 and browning-related enzymes, and thus delayed the longan pericarp browning."

Pericarp, aril, and seed of both D. longan were macerated in 95% v/v ethanol. Their chemical compositions were investigated using a Folin-Ciocalteu assay, aluminum chloride assay, and high-performance liquid chromatography. Antioxidant activities were evaluated in terms of radical scavenging and iron (III) reduction capacity. An enzyme inhibition assay was used to evaluate the hyaluronidase inhibition. Inflammatory cytokine secretion was evaluated with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. After being exposed to a heating and ageing procedure, gallic acid and ellagic acid content were increased tenfold, while the corilagin content was doubled. Black D. longan seed extract was the most potent anti-hyaluronidase and antioxidant with the strongest free radical scavenging and reduction power, while black D. longan aril extract resulted in the highest inhibition of inflammatory cytokine secretion. Black D. longan contained more biologically active compounds and possessed more potent biological activities than conventional dried D. longan. Therefore, thermal ageing treatment is suggested for producing black D. longan, for which seed extract is suggested as a cosmeceutical active ingredient and aril extract for anti-inflammation.",

      "abstract": "Background: Longan is the fruit of Dimocarpus longan Lour. and the longan arillus has long been used in traditional Chinese medicine possessing various health benefits. However, the excessive intake of longan is found in daily life to cause \"shanghuo\" syndrome. \"Shanghuo\" has been linked to increased disease susceptibility. The present study thus aimed to investigate the toxicological outcomes after excessive longan treatment. Methods: Longan extract at a normal dosage of 4 g/kg and two excess dosages of 8 and 16 g/kg was orally administered to normal C57BL/6J mice for two weeks or to C57BL/6J mice with DSS-induced colitis. Mouse gut microbiome were analyzed by 16S rRNA sequencing. Short chain fatty acid (SCFA) contents in colonic contents were measured by GC-MS. Colon tissue was used for histopathological observation after H and E staining, detection of protein expression by western blot, analysis of gene expression by qPCR, and detection of apoptotic cells by TUNEL assay. ELISA was used for biochemical analysis in serum. Results: In normal mice, repeated longan intake at excess doses, but not the normal dose, increased infiltration of inflammatory cells, elevated serum levels of TNF-α and IL-6 and reduced production of SCFAs. In DSS-induced colitic mice, longan intake at 4 g/kg did not promote colitis in mice, while excessive longan (8 or 16 g/kg) aggravated colitis in mice, showing increased inflammation, more serious histological abnormalities, increased gut permeability, and increased epithelia injury when compared to DSS alone. Excessive longan induced a significant reduction of microbial diversity in colitic mice, accompanied with aggravated alterations of DSS-associated bacteria including the increase of Proteobacteria phylum and genera of Bacteroides, Akkermansia, Turicibacter and Escherchia-Shigella, and the decrease of norank_f__Muribaculaceae. The changed microbial compositions were accompanied with decreased SCFAs when longan was supplemented with DSS. The aggravated colon injury by excessive intake of longan in colitic mice was tightly correlated with the altered microbial communities and decreased SCFAs production. Conclusion: Excessive longan intake disturbs gut homeostasis and aggravates colitis via promoting inflammation and altering gut microbe compositions and associated metabolism in mice. Our findings warrant rational longan arillus consumption as a dietary supplement or herbal medicine."

The Parkinson's disease presents with impaired motor functions and loss of dopaminergic neurons. However, the treatment for Parkinson's disease is not established until now. This study aims to elucidate the therapeutic advantages of WIN-1001X on animal models of Parkinson's disease. WIN-1001X administration successfully relieved the Parkinsonism symptoms in 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced Parkinson's disease mice tested by rota-rod and pole tests. The loss of tyrosine hydroxylase activities in substantia nigra and striatum was also attenuated by administration of WIN-1001X. In mice with sub-chronical MPTP injections, autophagy-related proteins, such as LC3, beclin-1, mTOR, and p62, were measured using the immunoblot assay. The results were favorable to induction of autophagy after the WIN-1001X administration. WIN-1001X treatment on 6-hydroxydopamine-injected rats also exhibited protective effects against striatal neuronal damage and loss of dopaminergic cells. Such protection is expected to be due to the positive regulation of autophagy by administration of WIN-1001X with confirmation both in vivo and in vitro. In addition, an active compound, onjisaponin B was isolated and identified from WIN-1001X. Onjisaponin B also showed significant autophagosome-inducing effect in human neuroblastoma cell line. Our study suggests that relief of Parkinsonism symptoms and rescue of tyrosine hydroxylase activity in dopaminergic neurons are affected by autophagy enhancing effect of WIN-1001X which the onjisaponin B is one of the major components of activity.",

      "abstract": "The influences of Kadozan, a novel chitosan formulation, on the pulp breakdown and ROS metabolism in postharvest 'Fuyan' longans were studied. Compared with control longans, the longans treated with 1:500 Kadozan dilution (VKadozan: VKadozan + Water) exhibited the suppressed development of pulp breakdown, higher AsA and GSH amounts, higher activities of ROS-scavenging enzymes like SOD, CAT, APX and POD, higher reducing power, and higher scavenging ability for DPPH radical, but a lower MDA amount, lower levels of ROS including O2- and H2O2. These findings indicated that the application of 1:500 Kadozan dilution (VKadozan: VKadozan + Water) for harvested longans could enhance the ROS-scavenging capacity to decrease the generation and accumulation of ROS, and a lower level of ROS could slow down the peroxidation progress of membrane lipids, alleviate the damage of longan pulp cellular membrane structure, and ultimately suppress pulp breakdown occurrence of harvested longans.",

To date, multiple bZIPs have been identified and investigated in numerous plant species. However, few studies have characterized bZIPs from Dimocarpus longan Lour. In this study, nine bZIPs from D. longan were identified from RNA-Seq data and further verified using the NCBI conserved domain search tool and Pfam database. Bioinformatics tools were used to systematically analyse the physicochemical properties, protein structures, multiple sequence alignment, motif compositions, evolutionary relationships, secondary structures, subcellular localization, phosphorylation sites, signal peptides, GO annotations and protein-protein interactions of the DlbZIPs. The expression patterns of the nine DlbZIPs were evaluated by qRT-PCR in roots and leaves and in response to varying durations of a 38°C heat treatment. DlbZIP3, DlbZIP5, DlbZIP6 and DlbZIP7 were differentially expressed between root and leaf tissues. All nine DlbZIPs responded to heat treatment in both roots and leaves, but their specific expression levels differed. DlbZIP4 and DlbZIP8 were highly expressed in roots after heat treatment, whereas DlbZIP1 and DlbZIP5 were highly expressed in leaves after heat treatment. These findings lay a foundation for increasing active secondary metabolite content and improving abiotic stress tolerance in D. longan using transgenic technology.",

      "abstract": "ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Longan (Dimocarpus longan Lour.) is one of the most popular subtropical fruits. Various parts of longan, including seeds, pericarp and pulp, have long been used in traditional medicine in China, Thailand and other Asian countries. The pulp has high sugar, vitamin and mineral content as well as bioactive components. The seeds and pericarp have also been reported to contain beneficial polyphenolic compounds. Longan sugar extract from pulp (LGSP) is prepared as a conventional sugar product. Longan sugar extract from whole longan fruit (LGSW) is also offered as a health food and as a medicinal product. AIM OF THE STUDY: The objective of this study was to identify and compare potential health hazards of both LGSW and LGSP by testing for acute and chronic oral toxicity in rats. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In acute toxicity testing, an oral dose (20 g/kg) of either LGSW or LGSP was administered to groups of rats. Mortality and clinical signs of toxicity were observed for 24 h, and then daily for a total of 14 days. In the chronic toxicity test, either LGSW (1, 2.5 and 5 g/kg/day) or LGSP (5 g/kg/day) was administered orally for a period of 180 days. After that treatment period, the rats in the satellite groups which received the highest doses of either LGSW or LGSP were observed for an additional 28 days. The rats then underwent clinical observation, body and organ weight measurement, hematological and biochemical analyses, and histopathological examination. RESULTS: In the acute toxicity study, the oral administration of LGSP or LGSW in either pellet or syrup formulations did not cause mortality or any pathological abnormalities. In the chronic toxicity study, neither LGSW nor LGSP resulted in death or in any changes in behavior of the rats. All hematological and serum biochemical values of both the LGSW- and LGSP-treated groups were within the normal ranges. No histopathological abnormalities of any internal organs were observed. CONCLUSION: The safety of longan sugar extract made from whole fruit (pulp, seeds and pericarb) is comparable to that of longan sugar extract made from pulp alone.",

      "abstract": "DNA methylation plays essential roles in gene regulation, chromatin structure stability, gene imprinting, X chromosome inactivation and embryonic development. However, the dynamics and functions of DNA methylation during the early stage of longan (Dimocarpus longan) somatic embryogenesis (SE) are still unclear. In this study, we carried out whole genome bisulphite sequencing and transcriptome sequencing analyses for embryogenic callus (EC), incomplete compact pro-embryogenic cultures (ICpEC) and globular embryos (GE) in an early SE system. At a global level, the DNA 5-methylcytosine content in EC, ICpEC and GE was 24.59, 19.65 and 19.74%, respectively, suggesting a global decrease in DNA methylation from EC to ICpEC and then a slight increase from ICpEC to GE. Differentially methylated region (DMR) analysis showed that hypomethylation mainly occurred in CHH contexts. Gene ontology and Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes analysis of hypomethylated-CHH-DMR-associated genes revealed that zein biosynthesis, fatty acid biosynthesis, circadian rhythm and mitophagy pathways were involved in longan early SE. Expression patterns of DNA methyltransferase and demethylase genes during longan early SE suggested that the decrease in DNA methylation was probably regulated by DNA methyltransferase genes and the DNA demethylase gene REPRESSOR OF SILENCING 1 (ROS1). The correlation between DNA hypomethylation and gene expression revealed that decreased DNA methylation did not cause extensive changes in gene expression during early longan SE and that gene expression may be affected by methylation changes in gene and downstream regions. Inhibiting DNA methylation with 5-azacytidine treatment in EC promoted the formation of GE and enhanced the capability of longan SE. Our results suggest that DNA demethylation has important roles in longan SE development.",

However, inadequate precooling and sulfur dioxide fumigation resulted in unexpected losses and short shelf life. A L9(34) orthogonal test was conducted to screen out ideal dosage of sodium metabisulfite (factor A), precooling method (factor B), and precooling duration (factor C) to improve the storability of longan fruit stored for 48 hr at room temperature (RT) (25℃). The overall qualities of all of the treated longan fruits after a 48-hr storage (OQST) and during the 5-day shelf at 25℃ (OQSF) were better than those of the control fruits. The treated fruits showed brighter fresh color (higher L*, b*, C*, and h° values but lower a* value), higher flavonoid, and chlorophyll contents. Moreover, the SO2 residue was concentrated in pericarp but little in aril for any of the 12 treatments. The multivariate variance analysis showed that factor A was dominant to determine both of the OQST and OQSF, while factor B affected the OQST, and factor C affected the OQSF. In total, \"0.22% sodium metabisulfite + 4 hr precooling + uncovered precooling\" was considered to be an ideal treatment. These results would contribute to improving longan postharvest preservation technology."

This work intended to explicate the influences of hydrogen peroxide, acting as a ROS, on pulp softening, pulp breakdown, and cell wall polysaccharides metabolism in longan fruit during storage. Contrasted to the control group, hydrogen peroxide-treated samples exhibited lower firmness, lower amounts of CWM, ISP, CSP, hemicellulose and cellulose, but higher breakdown index, WSP amount, expression levels of DlPG, DlPE, Dlβ-Gal, DlCx and DlXET and activities of their corresponding enzymes (PG, PE, β-Gal, Cx, XET). These results suggested that hydrogen peroxide reduced longan pulp firmness due to the increased gene expression levels and enzymes activities related to cell wall polysaccharide degradation to boost their decomposition, thereby led to the accelerated pulp softening and the expedited pulp breakdown of harvested longans.",

Herein, using longan shell as precursor, 3-dimensional porous carbon with abundant and interconnected pores and moderate heteroatoms were obtained via simple carbonization and potassium hydroxide (KOH) activation treatment. The electrochemical performances of obtained 3-dimensional porous carbon were investigated as electrode materials in symmetric SCs with aqueous and solid electrolytes. The optimized material that is named after longan shell 3-dimensional porous carbon 800 (LSPC800) possesses high porosity (1.644 cm3 g-1) and N content (1.14 at %). In the three-electrode measurement, the LSPC800 displays an excellent capacitance value of 359 F g-1. Besides, the LSPC800 also achieves splendid specific capacitance (254 F g-1) in the two electrode system, while the fabricated SC employing 1 M Li2SO4 as electrolyte acquires ultrahigh power density (15930.38 W kg-1). Most importantly, LSPC800 electrodes are further applied into the SC adopting the KOH/polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) gel electrolyte, which reaches up to an outstanding capacitance of 313 F g-1 at 0.5 A g-1. In addition, for the all-solid-state SC, its rate capability at 50 A g-1 is 72.73% and retention at the 10,000th run is 93.64%. Evidently, this work is of great significance to the simple fabrication of 3-dimensional porous carbon and further opens up a way of improving the value-added utilization of biomass materials, as well as proving that the biomass porous carbons have immense potential for high-performance SCs application."

      "abstract": "Litchi (Litchi chinensis Sonn.) and longan (Dimocarpus longan Lour.) fruits have a succulent and white aril with a brown seed and are becoming popular worldwide. The two fruits have been used in traditional Chinese medicine as popular herbs in the treatment of neural pain, swelling, and cardiovascular disease. The pericarp and seed portions as the by-products of litchi and longan fruits are estimated to be approximately 30% of the dry weight of the whole fruit and are rich in bioactive constituents. In the recent years, many biological activities, such as tyrosinase inhibitory, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, anti-glycated, and anti-cancer activities, as well as memory-increasing effects, have been reported for the litchi and longan pericarp and seed extracts, indicating a potentially significant contribution to human health. With the increasing production of litchi and longan fruits, enhanced utilization of the two fruit by-products for their inherent bioactive constituents in relation to pharmacological effects is urgently needed. This paper reviews the current advances in the extraction, processing, identification, and biological and pharmacological activities of constituents from litchi and longan by-products. Potential utilization of litchi and longan pericarps and seeds in relation to further research is also discussed.",

      "abstract": "Crude water extract of the ground longan seeds which have been disposed in a large amount annually in Northern Thailand has been used in a simple and rapid microwave synthesis of ZnO nanoparticles. The particles were characterized by the UV-vis spectroscopy, Fourier-transformed infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, electron diffraction, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, and transmission electron microscopy and revealed to be pure hexagonal phase. Influences of zinc precursor in the extract, microwave power, and irradiation time on particle sizes were studied. The use of 800 W and 30 cycles of the microwave irradiation provided the ZnO particles of 10-100 nm in size with an active surface area, a band gap energy, and a zero-point charge of 35 m2·g-1, 3.42 eV, and pH 7.7, respectively, after the calcination. Photocatalytic efficiencies of the synthesized particles were evaluated through the decolorization of methylene blue, malachite green, methyl orange, and orange II, and proved to be on par with commercially available titanium dioxide (Arroxide®P-25) under the same conditions. The use of the longan seeds biowaste as a sustainable supply of natural reagents for the green synthesis of ZnO nanoparticles which can be employed further for waste water treatment of the local textile dyeing industry is therefore presented.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappa B ligand (RANKL)-induced nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) signaling pathway plays essential roles in osteoclast differentiation and may serve as an attractive target for the development of therapeutics for osteoporosis. PURPOSE: This study aimed to identify plant extracts that attenuated RANKL-induced NF-κB signaling pathway and examine their anti-osteoporotic effects in animal model systems. METHODS: Osteoclast differentiation was determined by western blot analysis, RT-PCR, and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) assay. The effect of Longan (Dimocarpus longan Lour.) fruit extract (LFE) on bone mineral density was evaluated by calcein staining in zebrafish and micro-CT analysis in ovariectomized (OVX) rat. RESULTS: LFE nullified RANKL-induced down-regulation of inhibitor of NF-κB, which keeps NF-κB sequestered in the cytosol, thereby inhibiting translocation of NF-κB to the nucleus, in RAW264.7 cells. In addition, LFE decreased the nuclear levels of c-Fos and nuclear factor of activated T-cells c1, which play crucial roles in RANKL-induced osteoclast differentiation, in RAW264.7 cells. LFE repressed RANKL-activated cathepsin K and TRAP expression in RAW264.7 cells, resulting in a reduction of the number of TRAP-positive multinucleated cells, without cytotoxicity. Furthermore, LFE increased bone mineralization in zebrafish and prevented bone loss in OVX rat. CONCLUSION: Collectively, our findings suggest that LFE exerts its anti-osteoporotic activity through inhibition of osteoclast differentiation and may have potential as a herbal therapeutic or preventive agent for the treatment of osteoporosis.",

      "abstract": "An active polysaccharide (LPD2) was isolated from longan pulp by comparing the effects of polysaccharides on the phagocytosis of macrophages. LPD2 was composed of arabinose, mannose, glucose, and galactose in a molar ratio of 0.25:0.49:1:0.5 with average molecular weight of 9.64 × 106 Da. The main linkages of the sugar residues of LPD2 were (1→4)-β-Glc and (1→6)-β-Man. LPD2 significantly enhanced the lymphocytes proliferation, phagocytosis and NO and IL-6 secretion by macrophage. The anti-TLR2 and anti-TLR4 mAbs markedly suppressed LPD2-mediated NO and IL-6 production. Furthermore, anti-TLR4 or anti-TLR2 plus anti-TLR4 treatment significantly decreased LPD2-induced increase of MyD88, IRAK4, TRAF6 and INOS mRNA expression. Moreover, western blotting analysis showed that LPD2 enhanced the expression of target proteins in MyD88/IRAK4-TRAF6- INOS pathways. These results suggested that LPD2 induced macrophage activation partly via the TLR2- and TLR4-mediated MyD88/IRAK4-TRAF6 signaling pathways. Knowing the structural features and activities of active polysaccharide of longan gives the insights into longan polysaccharide application as an immunomodulatory agent.",

      "abstract": "Light is an important factor that affects the synthesis of functional metabolites in longan embryogenic calli (ECs). However, analysis of the effect of light on functional metabolites in longan ECs via RNA sequencing has rarely been reported and their light regulation network is unclear. The contents of various functional metabolites as well as the enzymatic activities of superoxide dismutase and peroxidase and the level of H₂O₂ in longan ECs were significantly higher under blue light treatment than under the other treatments (dark, white). In this study, we sequenced three mRNA libraries constructed from longan ECs subjected to different treatments. A total of 4463, 1639 and 1806 genes were differentially expressed in the dark versus blue (DB), dark versus white (DW) and white versus blue (WB) combinations, respectively. According to GO and KEGG analyses, most of the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) identified were involved in transmembrane transport, taurine and hypotaurine metabolism, calcium transport and so forth. Mapman analysis revealed that more DEGs were identified in each DB combination pathway than in DW combination pathways, indicating that blue light exerts a significantly stronger regulatory effect on longan EC metabolism than the other treatments. Based on previous research and transcriptome data mining, a blue light signaling network of genes that affect longan functional metabolites was constructed and HY5, PIF4 and MYC2 were shown to be the key regulatory genes in the network. The results of this study demonstrate that the expression levels of phase-specific genes vary with changes in longan EC functional metabolites.",

Three LPs contained similar glycosidic linkage of →3)-α-l-Araf-(1→, →3,6)-β-d-Galp-(1→ and α-l-Rhap(l→, while they each contained specific glycosidic linkage of →4)-β-d-Glcp(l→, →4)-β-d-Galp-(1→ and →5)-α-l-Araf-(1→ in LP-H, LP-S and LP-SE, respectively. Moreover, LP-SE exhibited stronger stimulation than LP-H and LP-S on the proliferation of Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus bulgaricus, Lactobacillus fermentum and Leuconostoc mesenteroides. The results indicated three extraction methods had some effect on chemical composition and structure of polysaccharide.

Leguminous crops are often used for improving soil properties. An approximately 2-year-long field experiment in lateritic soil in South China was conducted to evaluate the effects of legume introductions on soil properties and carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) pools. Two leguminous and one non-leguminous plant species, including Arachis hypogaea L. (a leguminous oilseed crop species, DA), Stylosanthes guianensis (a perennial herbaceous leguminous species, DS) and Lolium perenne L. (an annual non-leguminous forage species, DL), were introduced into a D. longan orchard as three treatments and compared to the monoculture of D. longan (the control, D0). And the harvested biomass residues of the three cover plants were returned to their corresponding plots as green manure. Soil samples were collected from depths of 0-10 and 10-20 cm approximately 2 years after treatment application. The results showed that, compared with D0, DA significantly improved the contents of soil available phosphorus, dissolved organic carbon (DOC), total nitrogen, ammonium and the N pool. In addition, DS significantly increased the contents of DOC, microbial biomass carbon and ammonium in the soil. However, DL did not affect any soil properties or the C and N pools. In addition, neither DA nor DS altered the soil bulk density or the contents of available nitrogen, total organic carbon and the C pool. The improvement of soil properties by DS and DA was positively correlated with the plant residues amount, plant N content but negatively correlated with the plant C:N ratios. Besides, the plant growth of longan was significantly improved by DA. In conclusion, compared with that of S. guianensis, the introduction of A. hypogaea L. was more helpful for restoring and improving soil properties, N pool and longan growth within the young hillside orchard in South China."

In this study, the effect of preharvest 0.2% zinc sulfate (ZnSO4 ) spray on the storability of longan fruits was investigated. RESULTS: The preharvest ZnSO4 spray did not significantly influence the quality but increased the Zn content in longan pericarp by 12.5-fold. More importantly, the treatment significantly reduced the rotting rate, pericarp browning, and aril breakdown of longan fruits stored at room temperature and low temperature. Physiological and biochemical results indicated that the treatment resulted in higher water retention capacity and inhibited the degradation of cellulose, pectin, flavonoid, and phenolics of longan pericarp at the late stages of storage. Consistent with these results, the activity of cellulase, polygalacturonase, polyphenol oxidase, and lipoxygenase was significantly inhibited in the ZnSO4 -treated longan pericarp at the late stages of storage. CONCLUSION: Higher Zn content in the ZnSO4 -treated longan pericarp might help to enhance the resistance against microbial infection, inhibit the hydrolysis of cell wall components, and thus effectively protected the cell wall components, maintained the cellular compartmentation, and prevented the phenolics and flavonoid from degradation by browning-related enzymes. © 2018 Society of Chemical Industry.",

      "abstract": "Longan is an important fruit tree in the subtropical region of Southeast Asia and Australia. However, its blooming and its yield are susceptible to stresses such as droughts, high salinity, and high and low temperature. To date, the molecular mechanisms of abiotic stress tolerance and flower induction in longan have not been elucidated. WRKY transcription factors (TFs), which have been studied in various plant species, play important regulatory roles in plant growth, development, and responses to stresses. However, there is no report about WRKYs in longan. In this study, we identified 55 WRKY genes with the conserved WRKY domain and zinc finger motif in the longan genome. Based on the structural features of WRKY proteins and topology of the phylogenetic tree, the longan WRKY (DlWRKY) family was classified into three major groups (I⁻III) and five subgroups (IIa⁻IIe) in group II. Tissue expression analysis showed that 25 DlWRKYs were highly expressed in almost all organs, suggesting that these genes may be important for plant growth and organ development in longan. Comparative RNA-seq and qRT-PCR-based gene expression analysis revealed that 18 DlWRKY genes showed a specific expression during three stages of flower induction in \"Sijimi\" (\"SJ\"), which exhibited the \"perpetual flowering\" (PF) habit, indicating that these 18 DlWRKY genes may be involved in the flower induction and the genetic control of the perpetual flowering trait in longan. Furthermore, the RT-qPCR analysis illustrated the significant variation of 27, 18, 15, 17, 27, and 23 DlWRKY genes under SA (Salicylic acid), MeJA (Methyl Jasmonate), heat, cold, drought, or high salinity treatment, respectively, implicating that they might be stress- or hormone-responsive genes. In summary, we systematically and comprehensively analyzed the structure, evolution, and expression pattern of the DlWRKY genes. The results presented here increase our understanding of the WRKY family in fruit trees and provide a basis for the further elucidation of the biological function of DlWRKY genes in longan.",

In this report, we further examined the effects of LFP in a CRC spheroid model. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A liquid-overlay assay employing HT-29 spheroids was used to evaluate the effects of LFP on cancer cell tumorigenesis, viability, and apoptosis. Associated effects on signaling path ways (epidermal growth factor receptor [EGFR], Akt) and apoptotic regulators were measured using Western blot. RESULTS: Treatment with LFP up to 200 μg/ml inhibited tumor growth in a dose-dependent manner and induced prominent apoptosis as measured by annexin V staining. Cells treated with LFP showed decreased EGFR and Akt phosphorylation with decreased expression of B-cell lymphoma 2. CONCLUSION: The ability of LFP to induce apoptosis in CRC spheroids warrants further investigation of its composition and identification of tumor-active components.",

Fuyan) fruit and its relation to disease development. The results showed that, compared with the control samples, P. longanae-inoculated longans showed higher fruit disease index, lower content of pericarp cell wall materials (CWMs), as well as lower contents of pericarp cell wall components (chelate-soluble pectin (CSP), sodium carbonate-soluble pectin, hemicelluloses, and cellulose), but higher content of pericarp water-soluble pectin (WSP). In addition, the inoculation treatment with P. longanae significantly promoted the activities of CWDEs including pectinesterase, polygalacturonase, β-galactosidase, and cellulase. The results suggested that the P. longanae stimulated-disease development of harvested longans was due to increase in activities of pericarp CWDEs, which might accelerate the disassembly of pericarp cell wall components. In turn, resulting in the degradation of pericarp cell wall, reduction of pericarp mechanical strength, and subsequently leading to the breakdown of longan pericarp tissues. Eventually resulting in development of disease development and fruit decay in harvested longans during storage at 28°C."

Longan (Dimocarpus longan Lour.) is an important fruit tree in the subtropical region of Southeast Asia and Australia; however the characteristics of the UBC gene family in longan remain unknown. In this study, 40 D. longan UBC genes (DlUBCs), which were classified into 15 groups, were identified in the longan genome. An RNA-seq based analysis showed that DlUBCs showed distinct expression in nine longan tissues. Genome-wide RNA-seq and qRT-PCR based gene expression analysis revealed that 11 DlUBCs were up- or down-regualted in the cultivar \"Sijimi\" (SJ), suggesting that these genes may be important for flower induction. Finally, qRT-PCR analysis showed that the mRNA levels of 13 DlUBCs under SA (salicylic acid) treatment, seven under methyl jasmonate (MeJA) treatment, 27 under heat treatment, and 16 under cold treatment were up- or down-regulated, respectively. These results indicated that the DlUBCs may play important roles in responses to abiotic stresses. Taken together, our results provide a comprehensive insight into the organization, phylogeny, and expression patterns of the longan UBC genes, and therefore contribute to the greater understanding of their biological roles in longan.",

      "abstract": "While flavonoid metabolism's regulation under light conditions by structural genes and transcription factors is understood, the roles of microRNAs (miRNAs) in this pathway have been rarely reported. In this paper, the accurate control of light was firstly enabled through the specially designed plant growth chamber which ensures consistency and accuracy of the cultivation of longan ECs and the repeatability of the experiments. Then, longan ECs were cultured in this chamber for 25 days. The change of growth rate of longan ECs was compared under different light qualities (dark, blue, green, white, green), intensities (16, 32, 64, 128, 256 μmol ·m-2 ·s-1), and durations (8 h, 12 h, 16 h, 20h, 24h). Results indicated that longan ECs had a high growth rate in the condition of blue or green light, at intensity ranged from 16 μmol·m-2·s-1 to 64 μmol·m-2·s-1, and duration from 8 h to 16 h. In addition, the contents of total flavonoids, rutin, and epicatechin were determined. Results indicated that flavonoid contents of longan ECs reached the highest value under blue light, at 32 μmol·m-2·s-1 and 12h/d. Blue light promoted the accumulation of epicatechin, but inhibited the synthesis of rutin. Finally, the expressions of flavonoid pathway genes, miRNAs and target genes were analyzed by qPCR. These results indicated that miR393 and its target gene DlTIR1-3, miR394 and its target gene DlAlMT12, and miR395 and its target gene DlAPS1 had a negative regulating relationship under blue light in longan ECs. Furthermore, miR393, miR394, and miR395 acted on target genes, which negatively regulated flavonoid key genes DlFLS and positively regulated key genes DlCHS, DlCHI, DlF3'H, DlDFR, DlLAR, and finally affected the accumulation of flavonoids. The treatment of longan ECs under the blue light at the intensity of 32 μmol·m-2·s-1 for 12 h/d inhibited the expression of miR393, miR394 and miR395, which promoted the expression of target genes and the accumulation of flavonoids and epicatechin, but inhibited the synthesis of rutin.",

Compared with L. theobromae-inoculated longans, DNP treatment could promote the index of fruit disease, accelerate the decrease in energy charge, increase respiration rate and the activities of respiratory terminal oxidases like CCO, AAO and PPO, elevate contents of NAD and NADH, but decrease NAD kinase activity, as well as contents of NADP and NADPH; however, exogenous ATP supply acted contrarily.

Subsequently, the physicochemical properties and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitory activity of LP-UE were compared to those of longan pulp polysaccharides (LP) extracted by hot water (LP-H), ultrahigh pressure (LP-U) or enzymatic treatment (LP-E). Results demonstrated that the extraction yield, hexuronic acid content and AChE inhibitory activity of LP-UE was the highest among the four LP samples. LP-UE was primarily made up of arabinose, glucose, and galactose and was linked mainly by β-type glycosidic linkage. The FTIR spectrum of LP-UE was very similar to those of LP-H, LP-U, and LP-E.

GAD activity and GABA-T activity were different between cultivars after precooling. GABA concentrations in fruit increased after 3 days of 10% CO2 + 5% O2 treatment and then declined as storage time increased.

To date, several reliable reference gene validations have been reported in fruits trees, but none have been done on preharvest and postharvest longan fruits. In this study, 12 candidate reference genes, namely, CYP, RPL, GAPDH, TUA, TUB, Fe-SOD, Mn-SOD, Cu/Zn-SOD, 18SrRNA, Actin, Histone H3, and EF-1a, were selected. Expression stability of these genes in 150 longan samples was evaluated and analyzed using geNorm and NormFinder algorithms. Preharvest samples consisted of seven experimental sets, including different developmental stages, organs, hormone stimuli (NAA, 2,4-D, and ethephon) and abiotic stresses (bagging and girdling with defoliation). Postharvest samples consisted of different temperature treatments (4 and 22°C) and varieties. Our findings indicate that appropriate reference gene(s) should be picked for each experimental condition. Our data further showed that the commonly used reference gene Actin does not exhibit stable expression across experimental conditions in longan. Expression levels of the DlACO gene, which is a key gene involved in regulating fruit abscission under girdling with defoliation treatment, was evaluated to validate our findings. In conclusion, our data provide a useful framework for choice of suitable reference genes across different experimental conditions for RT-qPCR analysis of preharvest and postharvest longan fruits."

The AgNPs were characterized by UV-vis absorption spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and Fourier transform infrared spectroscope (FTIR). The bactericidal properties of the synthesized AgNPs were observed via the agar dilution method and the growth inhibition test. The cytotoxicity effect was explored on human prostate cancer PC-3 cells in vitro by trypan blue assay. The expressions of phosphorylated stat 3, bcl-2, survivin, and caspase-3 were examined by Western blot analysis. The longan peel extract acted as a strong reducing and stabilizing agent during the synthesis. Water-soluble AgNPs of size 9-32 nm was gathered with a face-centered cubic structure. The AgNPs had potent bactericidal activities against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria with a dose-related effect. AgNPs also showed dose-dependent cytotoxicity against PC-3 cells through a decrease of stat 3, bcl-2, and survivin, as well as an increase in caspase-3. These findings confirm the bactericidal properties and explored a potential anticancer application of AgNPs for prostate cancer therapy. Further research should be focused on the comprehensive study of molecular mechanism and in vivo effects on the prostate cancer."

      "abstract": "Energy status and respiration metabolism of \"Fuyan\" longan fruit treated by hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and their relationship to pericarp browning were studied. The results displayed that H2O2 significantly increased the respiration rate, increased activities of respiratory terminal oxidases like cytochrome C oxidase (CCO) and ascorbic acid oxidase (AAO), decreased NAD kinase activity, maintained lower contents of NADP and NADPH as well as higher amounts of NAD and NADH, and accelerated the decrease of energy charge. These results gave convincing evidence that the treatment of H2O2 for accelerating longan pericarp browning was due to an increase of energy deficiency, an increase of respiratory metabolic pathways of Embden-Meyerhof pathway (EMP) and tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, a decrease of pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) of respiratory pathway, and an increase of activities of respiratory terminal oxidases like CCO and AAO.",

Expression analysis of DlRan genes during somatic embryogenesis uncovered a high abundance of DlRan genes in early embryogenic cultures and heart- and torpedo-shaped embryos. The expression of DlRan genes in embryogenic calli was affected by exogenous 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid treatment.

In this study, we used cell-based herbal extract screening to identify longan fruit extract (LFE) as an activator of osteoblast differentiation. LFE up-regulated alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity, induced mineralization, and activated Runx2 gene expression in MC3T3-E1 cells. Furthermore, treatment of MC3T3-E1 cells with LFE promoted the phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase1/2 (Erk1/2); however, abrogation of Erk1/2 activation with PD98059 resulted in down-regulation of the phospho- SMAD1/5/8 and Runx2 levels, which in turn reduced the ALP activity. Our findings suggest that LFE exerts its osteogenic activity through activation of the ERK signaling pathway and may have potential as an herbal therapeutic or a preventive agent for the treatment of osteoporosis.",

However, the scientific evidence related to their effects on inflammation especially the possible cellular and molecular mechanisms of longan need to be clarified. AIM OF THE STUDY: To evaluate the anti-inflammatory effect of the various parts of longan including flower, seed, and pulp. The mechanisms and molecular targets involved in their effects were also investigated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Different longan extracts were analyzed for their bioactive compounds and evaluated for anti-inflammation. Corilagin, ellagic acid, and gallic acid were detected using HPLC-DAD. In vitro anti-inflammatory effect of longan extracts and their polysaccharides were examined by analyzing nitric oxide (NO) production in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated RAW264.7 macrophages. Expression of the proteins that involved in NO production was detected by Western blot. RESULTS: Flower extract contained the highest amounts of total phenolics, total flavonoids, proanthocyanidins, corilagin and ellagic acid when compared to seed and pulp extracts. The extracts of different longan parts inhibited LPS-induced NO production with different potency. The highest potency for the inhibition of NO production was shown with flower extract follow by seed and pulp (IC50=128.2, 1127.4, and 1260.2μgmL(-1), respectively). The mechanisms of this anti-NO production were associated with their NO scavenging effect and their decreasing the expression and catalytic activity of an inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). Moreover, these longan extracts suppressed LPS-induced degradation of IκBα and activation of NF-κB, activator protein-1 (AP-1), Akt, and mitogen activated protein kinases (MAPKs). CONCLUSION: These results suggest that the longan extracts possess anti-inflammatory property. Therefore, longan could provide potential dietary supplement for the treatment of inflammatory-related diseases.",

      "abstract": "MicroRNA160 plays a critical role in plant development by negatively regulating the auxin response factors ARF10, -16, and -17. However, the ways in which miR160 expression is regulated at the transcriptional level, and how miR160 interacts with its targets during plant embryo development, remain unknown. Here, we studied the regulatory relationships among endogenous target mimics (eTMs), and miR160 and its targets, and their involvement in hormone signaling and somatic embryogenesis (SE) in Dimocarpus longan. We identified miR160 family members and isolated the miR160 precursor, primary transcript, and promoter. The promoter contained cis-acting elements responsive to stimuli such as light, abscisic acid, salicylic acid (SA) and heat stress. The pri-miR160 was down-regulated in response to SA but up-regulated by gibberellic acid, ethylene, and methyl jasmonate treatment, suggesting that pri-miR160 was associated with hormone transduction. Dlo-miR160a, -a(∗) and -d(∗) reached expression peaks in torpedo-shaped embryos, globular embryos and cotyledonary embryos, respectively, but were barely detectable in friable-embryogenic callus. This suggests that they have expression-related and functional diversity, especially during the middle and later developmental stages of SE. Four potential eTMs for miR160 were identified. Two of them, glucan endo-1,3-beta- glucosidase-like protein 2-like and calpain-type cysteine protease DEK1, were confirmed to control the corresponding dlo-miR160a(∗) expression level. This suggests that they may function to abolish the binding between dlo-miR160a(∗) and its targets. These two eTMs also participated in 2,4-D and ABA signal transduction. DlARF10, -16, and -17 targeting by dlo-miR160a was confirmed; their expression levels were higher in friable-embryogenic callus and incomplete compact pro-embryogenic cultures and responded to 2,4-D, suggesting they may play a major role in the early stages of longan SE dependent on 2,4-D. The eTMs, miR160, and ARF10, -16, and -17 exhibited tissue specificity in 'Sijimi' longan vegetative and reproductive organs, but were not significant negatively correlated. These results provide insights into the possible role of the eTM-miR160-ARF10-16-17 pathway in longan somatic embryo development."

RESULTS: Two non-protein amino acids, α-aminoisobutyric acid (AIB) and β-aminoisobutyric acid (BAIB) at 100 and 1 mM were applied to longan fruit prior to storage for up to 8 days at 25 °C respectively. Contents of the major five phenolics (gallic acid, catechin, corilagin, epicatechin and gallocatechin gallate) were assayed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Physiological properties related to pericarp browning of longan fruit were investigated during storage. Respiration rate, membrane permeability, malondialdehyde (MDA) content, and activities of polyphenol oxidase (PPO) and peroxidase (POD) were down-regulated by AIB or BAIB treatments, with significantly lower pericarp browning index and higher proportion of edible fruit than the control. Moreover, exogenous application of AIB and BAIB maintained higher contents of catechin, corilagin, epicatechin and gallocatechin gallate, but lower content of gallic acid compared to the control in the pericarp of longan fruit during storage, which was associated with the oxidation of browning substrate. CONCLUSIONS: Pericarp browning was inhibited and storage life of longan fruit was extended effectively by AIB and BAIB treatments with AIB treatment being more significant than BAIB. The findings may provide a new strategy for controlling pericarp browning of harvested longan fruit."

      "abstract": "Infection with hepatitis C virus (HCV) results in hepatitis C, a disease characterized by chronic infection, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Currently, the standard therapy is a combination of pegylated interferon-α plus ribavirin with NS3 protease inhibitors. Addition of NS3 protease inhibitors to the standard therapy improves response rates; however, use of NS3 protease inhibitors is also associated with significant adverse effects and an increase in the overall cost of treatment. Therefore, there is a need to develop safe and inexpensive drugs for the treatment of HCV infections. In this study, we examined the antiviral activity of a crude extract from Dimocarpus longan leaves against HCV (genotype 2a strain JFH1). The D. longan crude extract (DL-CE) exhibited anti-HCV activity with a 50% effective concentration (EC50) of 19.4 μg/ml without cytotoxicity. A time-of-addition study demonstrated that DL-CE has anti-HCV activity at both the entry and post-entry steps and markedly blocks the viral entry step through direct virucidal activity with marginal inhibition of virion assembly. Co-treatment of DL-CE with cyclosporine A, an immunosuppressant or telaprevir, an NS3 protease inhibitor, resulted in additive and synergistic antiviral effects, respectively. Our findings suggest that DL-CE may be useful as an add-on therapy candidate for treating HCV infections.",

An alternative is the use of growth factors, but the high cost and potential tumorigenesis are the major obstacles. To ensure successful ACI therapy, it is of significance to find effective substituted pro-chondrogenic agent. Polysaccharides from plant extract have low toxicity and few undesirable side effects, which were reported to facilitate cartilage regeneration. In this study, we investigated the effect of Longan polysaccharides (LP) on rabbit articular chondrocytes through examination of the cell proliferation, morphology, viability, glycosaminoglycan synthesis and cartilage-specific gene expression. Results showed that close to the positive group which used the growth factor of TGF-β, LP could effectively promote chondrocytes growth and enhance secretion and synthesis of cartilage extracellular matrix by up-regulating expression levels of aggrecan, collagen II and sox9 compared to the negative control. Expression of collagen I gene was effectively down-regulated, demonstrating the inhibition of chondrocytes dedifferentiation by LP. Hypertrophy that might lead to chondrocyte ossification was also undetectable in LP groups. Range of 4.69-18.76 µg/ml was recommended dose of LP, among which the most profound response was observed with 9.38 μg/ml. All the evidences revealed that LP may replace the growth factors to be applied in ACI therapy. This study might provide a basis for development of a novel agent in the treatment of articular cartilage defect.",

We used these treatments to study the involvement of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in fruit abscission. Girdling plus defoliation decreased sugar concentrations in the fruit and pedicel and depleted starch grains in the chloroplasts in the cells of abscission zone. Prior to the occurrence of intensive fruit abscission, there was a burst in ROS in the pedicel, which peaked at 1 day after treatment (DAT), when H2O2 in the abscission zone was found to be chiefly located along the plasma membrane (PM). H2O2 was found exclusively in the cell walls 2 DAT, almost disappeared 3 DAT, and reappeared in the mitochondria and cell walls 4 DAT. Signs of cell death such as cytoplasm breakdown were apparent from 3 DAT. The burst of ROS coincided with a sharp increase in the activity of PM-bound NADPH oxidase in the pedicel. At the same time, activities of antioxidant enzymes including superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase, and peroxidase (POD) were all increased by the treatment and maintained higher than those in the control. Accompanying the reduction in H2O2 abundance, there was a sharp decrease in PM-bound NADPH oxidase activity after 1 DAT in the treated fruit. H2O2 scavenger dimethylthiourea (DMTU, 1 g L(-1)) significantly inhibited fruit abscission in detached fruit clusters and suppressed the increase in cellulase activity in the abscission zone. These results suggest that fruit abscission induced by carbohydrate stress is mediated by ROS. Roles of ROS in regulating fruit abscission were discussed in relation to its subcellular distribution."

Wulongling) of uniform one-aged seedlings grown in pots were selected to study specific proteins expressed in leaves under simulated acid rain (SiAR) stress and exogenous Ca(2+) regulation. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) results showed that there was a protein band specifically expressed under SiAR of pH 2.5 stress for 15 days with its molecular weight of about 23 kD. A 17 kD protein band specifically expressed after SiAR stress 5 days. Compared with pH 2.5, the pH 3.5 of SiAR made a less influence to protein expression. Two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE) results showed that six new specific proteins including C4 (20.2 kD pI 6.0), F (24 kD pI 6.35), B3 (22.3 kD pI 6.35), B4 (23.5 kD pI 6.5), C5 (21.8 kD pI 5.6), and C6 (20.2 kD pI 5.6) specifically expressed. C4 always expressed during SiAR stress. F expressed under the stress of pH 2.5 for 15 days and expressed in all pH SiAR stress for 20 days. The expression of proteins including B3, C5, and C6 was related to pH value and stress intensity of SiAR. The expression of B4 resulted from synergistic effects of SiAR and Ca. The expression of G1 (Mr 19.3 kD, pI 4.5), G2 (Mr 17.8 kD, pI 4.65), G3 (Mr 16.6 kD, pI 4.6), and G4 (Mr 14.7 kD, pI 4.4) enhanced under the treatment of 5 mM ethylene glycol tetraacetic acid (EGTA) and 2 mM chlorpromazine (CPZ).

Viscoelastic determination indicated that longan juice with 0.15% xanthan addition was optimal for a fruit drink. Colour parameters showed pressurised longan juice at 500 MPa was brighter and more transparent than fresh and other processed juices. PPO was completely inactivated in pasteurised juices, whereas in pressurised juices at 300 and 500 MPa, the activities were more than 100% and 95-99%, respectively. Bioactive components including ascorbic acid were significantly reduced according to treatment severities, whereas gallic and ellagic acids were relatively stable in all processed juices. Total phenols and DPPH radical-scavenging activity decreased significantly on pasteurisation, but were stable on pressurisation.",

The inhibitory effects of propyl gallate on the activity of mushroom tyrosinase and effects of propyl gallate on pericarp browning of harvested longan fruits in relation to phenolic metabolism were investigated. The results showed that propyl gallate could potently inhibit diphenolase activity of tyrosinase. The inhibitor concentration leading to 50% activity lost (IC50) was determined to be 0.685 mM. Kinetic analyses showed that propyl gallate was a reversible and mixed type inhibitor on this enzyme. The inhibition constants (K(IS) and K(I)) were determined to be 2.135 and 0.661 mM, respectively. Furthermore, the results also showed that propyl gallate treatment inhibited activities of PPO and POD in pericarp of harvested longan fruits, and maintained higher contents of total phenol and flavonoid of longan pericarp. Moreover, propyl gallate treatment also delayed the increases of browning index and browning degree in pericarp of harvested longan fruits. Therefore, application of propyl gallate may be a promising method for inhibiting tyrosinase activity, controlling pericarp browning, and extending shelf life of harvested longan fruits.",

The results showed that WLP exhibited radical scavenging, reducing activity and liposome protection activity. In addition, WLP also inhibited lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced nitric oxide (NO) production in macrophages. Further, administration of WLP, in the range of 100-400 mg/kg, showed a concentration-dependent inhibition on paw edema development following carrageenan (Carr) treatment in mice. The anti-inflammatory effects of WLP may be related to NO and tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α) suppression and associated with the increase in the activities of antioxidant enzymes, including catalase, superoxide dismutase, and glutathione peroxidase. Overall, the results showed that WLP might serve as a natural antioxidant and inflammatory inhibitor."

This study aims to evaluate antifungal activities of longan fruit extract in comparison to its active compounds. The results showed that longan seed exhibited antifungal activity against the opportunistic yeasts (Candida species and Cryptococcus neoformans). In contrast, longan pulp and whole fruit did not demonstrate any inhibitory effects. Ellagic acid showed the most potent antifungal activity followed by corilagin and gallic acid, respectively. Ellagic acid inhibited Candida parapsilosis and C. neoformans more effectively than Candida krusei and also some Candida albicans clinical strains. Baidam cultivar possessed higher antifungal activity (MIC=500-4000 μg/ml) as it contained higher contents of ellagic acid and gallic acid than Edor (MIC=1000-8000 μg/ml). For antibacterial activity, only corilagin and gallic acid possessed weak to moderate inhibitory effects against Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus mutans, respectively. Longan seed was then applied in the oral care products. Longan effervescent granule (5% extract) significantly reduced adhesion of C. albicans to acrylic strips. Mouthwash containing 0.5% extract exhibited good antifungal activity compared to a commercial product. These findings indicated that longan seed extract and its polyphenolic compounds can be used as an antifungal agent in oral care products for the treatment of opportunistic yeast infection.",

These analytes were extracted and interfering matrices removed with a single mixed-mode solid phase extraction under optimum conditions. The recoveries at three levels of concentration were in the range of 72-112%. The endogenous plant hormones were separated and quantified by liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS). Detection limits based on the signal-to-noise ratio ranged from 10 ng mL(-1) for gibberellin A4 (GA4) to 200 ng mL(-1) for IAA. Within the first week after potassium chlorate treatment, dry weight (DW) amounts in the treated longan shoot tips of four gibberellins, namely: gibberellin A1(GA1), gibberellic acid (GA3), gibberellin A19 (GA19) and gibberellin A20 (GA20), were found to increase to approximately 25, 50, 20 and 60 ng g(-1) respectively, all of which were significantly higher than those of the controls. In contrast, gibberellin A8 (GA8) obtained from the treated longan was found to decrease to approximately 20 ng g(-1)DW while that of the control increased to around 80 ng g(-1)DW. Certain CKs which play a role in leaf bud induction, particularly isopentenyl adenine (iP), isopentenyl adenosine (iPR) and dihydrozeatin riboside (DHZR), were found to be present in amounts of approximately 20, 50 and 60 ng g(-1)DW in the shoot tips of the control longan. The analytical results obtained from the two-month off-season longan flowering period indicate that high GA1, GA3, GA19 and GA20 levels in the longan shoot tips contribute to flower bud induction while high levels of CKs, IAA and ABA in the control longan contribute more to the vegetative development.",

      "abstract": "In the present work, two full length cDNAs of GH3 genes, named DlGH3.1 and DlGH3.2 were cloned from pericarp and aril tissues of the longan fruit, respectively. Three conserved motifs, SSGTSAGERK, YASSE and YRVGD, as a characteristic of the acyladenylate/thioester forming enzyme superfamily were observed in DlGH3.1 and DlGH3.2 proteins. DlGH3.1 mainly expressed in pericarp tissues while DlGH3.2 accumulated in both the pericarp and aril tissues during fruit growth and development. In addition, NAA treatment induced the expression of DlGH3.1 and DlGH3.2 in the pericarp tissues at 21 and 77days after anthesis (DAA), while only DlGH3.2 in the aril tissues could be induced by NAA at 77DAA. More importantly, ABA and ethrel treatments suppressed the accumulations of DlGH3.1 and DlGH3.2 in the pericarp tissues of longan fruit at 21DAA (a rapid growth stage of pericarp), but enhanced DlGH3.2 expression in the aril tissues at 77DAA (a fruit ripening stage). Furthermore, the expression patterns of DlGH3.1 and DlGH3.2 showed different tissue specificity. Thus, our results suggest that DlGH3.1 gene expression might be associated with pericarp growth, while DlGH3.2 accumulation is likely to be related to both pericarp growth and fruit ripening, and the responses of DlGH3s to plant growth hormones are different and dependent on fruit development stage and fruit tissue.",

However, the effect of LSP on the growth of human colorectal carcinoma cells (CRC) has not yet been evaluated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Polyphenols of longan seeds were extracted and measured by colorimetry. Four CRC cell lines (Colo 320DM, SW480, HT-29 and LoVo) were treated with LSP and assessed for viability by trypan blue exclusion, for cell cycle distribution by flow cytometry, for apoptosis by annexin V labelling and for changes in the levels of proteins involved in cell cycle control or apoptosis by immunoblotting. RESULTS: Total phenol content of LSP was 695 mg g(-1) and total flavonoids were 150 mg g(-1). LSP inhibited the proliferation (25 microg mL(-1)-200 microg mL(-1)) of Colo 320DM, SW480 and HT-29, but not LoVo. LSP inhibited the proliferation by blocking cell cycle progression during the DNA synthesis phase and inducing apoptotic death. Western blotting indicated that LSP blocks the S phase, reducing the expression of cyclin A and cyclin D1. Colo 320DM and SW480 treated with LSP also showed the activation of caspase 3 and increased Bax : Bcl-2 ratio. CONCLUSION: LSP induces S phase arrest of the cell cycle and apoptotic death in three CRC cell lines. The results indicate that LSP is a potential novel chemoprevention and treatment agent for colorectal cancer.",

The treatment of fresh longan fruit with SO2 fumigation combined with the suitable storage condition improved the overall longan fruit quality, especially on inner and outer peel tissue and aril color than no SO2 treatment. Treatment stabilizes peel color with no subsequent loss of color during storage (fruit color were bright-yellowish color). When the fruit showed during SO2 treatment, increasing of storage duration and temperatures, the dark color of inner and outer peel of longan fruit was appeared, this was correlated with the increasing of PPO activity. The activity of PPO enzyme in control fruit (no SO2 treatment) gradually lower than SO2 treatments. Fruit exposed to cool storage temperature (2 degrees C) exhibited a lower PPO enzymatic activity compared to those kept in high storage temperature (7 degrees C). Moreover, PPO enzymatic activity significantly increased over the storage durations The additional SO2 treatment no subsequent loss of weight of longan fruit during storage. However, the sulphite residues could detect immediately after SO2 treatment in all part of longan fruit, especially on aril tissue. The SEM evaluation found that the surface cracking was also impair the physiological function of the cuticle and increasing water permeability, which may cause water soaking at the inner side of the peel.

However, the effect of LFE treatment on the growth of colorectal cancer cells has not been evaluated. This study investigated the effect of LFE on two colorectal cancer cell lines, SW-480 and Colo 320DM, and the possible mechanisms involved. LFE-treated cells were assessed for viability by trypan blue exclusion, for in vitro tumorigenesis by seeding cells in soft agar to allow anchorage independent growth, for cell cycle distribution by flow cytometry, for loss of mitochondrial membrane potential by rhodamine 123 staining, for increased apoptosis by DNA fragmentation assay, and for changes in the levels of proteins involved in cell cycle control and apoptosis by immunoblotting. LFE (25-400 microg/ml) could inhibit proliferation in a dose- and time-dependent manner. The cell cycle of both LFE-treated cell lines showed obvious S phase block. Western blotting further showed the S phase block in these two cell lines was mainly due to cyclin E accumulation and cyclin A decrease. LFE treatment increased rhodamine 123-negative cells and DNA fragmentation in Colo 320DM cells but not in SW480 cells. Increased levels of the apoptosis activation protein, caspase 3, were also found in Colo 320DM cells. The activation of caspase 3 in LFE-treated SW480 cells was not significant. The caspase 3 activation in Colo 320DM cells by LFE was mediated by the suppression of Bcl-2 protein levels. LFE treatment could inhibit the proliferation and malignancy of colorectal cancer cell lines and was associated with S phase block of the cell cycle. An apoptotic mechanism induced by LFE involving a loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and caspase 3 activation was found in Colo 320DM cells but not in SW480 cells. The results of this study indicate that LFE has potential to be developed as a novel functional food or chemopreventive agent for colorectal cancer.",

      "abstract": "AIM OF THE STUDY: The fruit of Euphoria longan (Lour.) Steud. (Sapindaceae) is sweet and edible. Dried Euphoria longan fruit is prescribed as a tonic and for the treatment of forgetfulness, insomnia, or palpitations caused by fright in traditional Chinese medicine. The effects of aqueous extract of Euphoria longan fruit (ELE) on learning and memory and their underlying mechanisms were investigated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Aqueous extract of Euphoria longan fruit (ELE) was administered to ICR mice for 14 days. Piracetam was used as a positive control for its known memory-enhancing effects. Memory performances were assessed using the passive avoidance task. The expressions of phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (pERK) 1/2, phosphorylated cAMP response element binding protein (pCREB), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), doublecortin (DCX) and the incorporation of 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine (BrdU) in hippocampal dentate gyrus and CA1 regions were investigated using immunohistochemical methods. RESULTS: The step-through latency in the ELE-treated group was significantly increased compared with that in the vehicle-treated controls (P<0.05) in the passive avoidance task. Piracetam-treated group also showed enhanced cognitive performaces in the passive avoidance task. Immunohistochemical studies revealed that the number of cells immunopositive for BDNF, pCREB, or pERK 1/2 was significantly increased in the hippocampal dentate gyrus and CA1 regions after ELE treatment for 14 days (P<0.05). DCX and BrdU immunostaining also revealed that ELE significantly enhanced immature neuronal survival, but not neuronal cell proliferation in the subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus. CONCLUSIONS: The present results suggest that subchronic administration of aqueous extract of Euphoria longan fruit enhances learning and memory, and that its beneficial effects are mediated, in part, by BDNF expression and immature neuronal survival.",

      "abstract": "Recent evidence strongly suggests that oxidative stress due to redox imbalance is highly associated with metabolic syndrome. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of the supplementation of longan flower water extract (LFWE), which showed powerful antioxidative activity in vitro, on markers of metabolic syndrome in a fructose-fed rat model. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into four groups: group C, fed with standard Purina chow; group F, fed with high-fructose diet (HF) alone; group L, fed with HF plus LFWE 125 mg/kg bw per day by gavage; and group H, fed HF plus LFWE 250 mg/kg bw per day by gavage. The dietary manipulation lasted for 14 weeks. Results of our study showed that rats fed with HF resulted in oxidative stress and affected the antioxidant status including plasma thiobarbituric acid and liver antioxidant enzyme activity. Treatment with LFWE significantly augmented the antioxidant system. HF was able to cause insulin resistance and elevation of the blood pressure. The supplementation of LFWE ameliorated insulin resistance by enhancing the expression of insulin signaling pathway related proteins, including insulin receptor substrate-1 and glucose transporter 4. LFWE supplementation was also found to decrease systolic blood pressure. These findings indicate that longan flower water extract may improve the symptoms of metabolic syndrome in fructose-fed rats.",
