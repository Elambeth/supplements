      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION:  Evidence shows that poor glycemic control and diabetes are strongly associated with poor bone quality and fragility fractures. This study was conducted to record vitamin D (VD) levels and assess hip fracture severity in elderly hip-fractured patients with and without type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). METHODS:  We examined 114 patients over 65 years old with low-energy hip fractures, classified as extracapsular or intracapsular. Severe fractures were defined by Garden's classification for subcapital fractures and the AO/Orthopaedic Trauma Association classification for intertrochanteric fractures. Patients were divided into two groups: 49 with standard glycemic control (Group A) and 65 with impaired control (Group B). We measured parathyroid hormone (PTH), 25-hydroxyvitamin D, bone mineral density (BMD), hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), serum albumin (ALB), and Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR). RESULTS:  Gender and age had no significant differences. In Group A, 73.5% had osteoporosis, and 26.5% had osteopenia; in Group B, the figures were 66.2% and 33.8%, respectively (p = 0.402). VD levels were similar, with Group A averaging 10.03 ± 5.43 ng/mL and Group B 10.01 ± 5.09 ng/mL (p = 0.986). Group A's mean PTH level was 79.71 ± 57.64 ng/mL, while Group B's was 59.42 ± 45.57 ng/mL (p = 0.018). Among patients with diabetes, 60% were on oral medications, 6.2% on insulin alone, and 16.9% received a combination of treatments. Elderly diabetes patients with hip fractures, those using insulin, or those newly diagnosed with T2DM had lower VD levels. Based on regression analysis, VD is expected to decrease by 0.029 for every unit increase in PTH, concerning all the participants (95% confidence interval: 0.011-0.048). HbA1c and HOMA-IR levels showed significant differences (p < 0.001). Patients with diabetes experienced more unstable fractures (75.4% in diabetics vs. 67.3% in nondiabetics), though fracture type and severity were not statistically significant. More comminuted fractures were noted in patients on oral antidiabetic medications alongside insulin usage and those with less than five years of antidiabetic therapy. ALB levels were similar, with malnutrition prevalent in 75.5% of Group A and 75.4% of Group B patients. Patients with diabetes with malnutrition exhibited lower VD levels compared to those with normal ALB (p = 0.038). Patients with diabetes with poor glycemic control (HbA1c > 6.5%) had higher VD (10.09 ± 4.93 vs. 9.82 ± 5.57 ng/mL) and PTH (58.9 ± 49.99 vs. 50.73 ± 34.01 ng/mL) levels compared to those with adequate control (p values not significant). CONCLUSIONS:  Our study confirmed the paradox that patients with T2DM had increased BMD compared to age-adjusted nondiabetic counterparts. The difference in hip fracture severity was not statistically significant. ALB levels were similar, with malnutrition prevalent in both groups, although diabetic patients with malnutrition are correlated with lower VD levels. VD levels were similar in both groups, but PTH levels were significantly higher in nondiabetics. The relationship between T2DM and PTH remains controversial and needs further investigation. Clinicians should note that low VD levels do not accompany elevated PTH in patients with diabetes, and elevated PTH may indicate poorly controlled T2DM. VD deficiency, hypoalbuminemia, and impaired glycemic control are interconnected issues in elderly patients with low-energy hip fractures."

      "abstract": "Overactive bladder (OAB) is a common urological disorder, characterized by urinary urgency and frequency. However, the etiology and pathogenesis of OAB remain unclear. The objective of this study was to construct a Vitamin D-deficient rat model with the aim of clarifying the relationship between Vitamin D deficiency and the development of OAB, as well as investigating the potential mechanisms involved. The findings revealed that rats with vitamin D deficiency exhibited indications of OAB, including increased urinary frequency and urgency, as evidenced by void spot assay and cystometry. Furthermore, supplementation with vitamin D proved to be an effective intervention in alleviating these symptoms. The activation of RhoA/ROCK pathway was found in the bladder tissues and urine of rats with vitamin D deficiency. Moreover, supplementation with vitamin D led to a significant decrease in the expression levels of RhoA/ROCK pathway in both bladder tissue and urine. In conclusion, our study was the first to demonstrate that vitamin D deficiency is one of the etiological factors of OAB through the activation of the RhoA/ROCK signaling pathway, and that vitamin D supplementation has been shown to effectively alleviate OAB symptoms by inhibiting this pathway. Meanwhile, urinary RhoA may be a biomarker of OAB. Our present work makes a significant contribution to the clarification of the etiology and mechanism of OAB, as well as to the refinement of OAB treatment strategies."

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: Vitamin D supplementation during winter may protect children from acute respiratory tract infections (ARTI), especially at Northern latitudes where dermal vitamin D synthesis is negligible. This study aimed to investigate our hypothesis that vitamin D supplementation would have beneficial effects on ARTI in children during extended winter. METHODS: This study includes secondary analyses from a double-blinded, randomized, clinical 24-week trial, which investigated effects of vitamin D supplementation and normal vs. high dairy protein intake on children's growth and health. Baseline visits were conducted in Copenhagen, Denmark (55⁰N) from August-October 2019 and endpoint visits February-April 2020. Parents completed illness questionnaires at baseline and every 4 weeks during the intervention. In total, 200 healthy, white 6-8-y-old children were included and randomized to 20 µg/d vitamin D3 or placebo. RESULTS: Parents of 189 children (100 females (53%); mean (SD) age, 7.7(0.8) years) completed all ARTI questionnaires. Baseline serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D was 79.8(17.2) nmol/L, which increased by 9.4(17.0) nmol/L in the vitamin D group and decreased by 32.7(17.4) nmol/L in the placebo group. The vitamin D-supplemented children had 17% fewer sick days due to ARTI (risk ratio (RR), 0.83; 95% CI, 0.76-0.90; P < 0.001) compared with placebo. Children also had 43% fewer days with ARTI with fever (RR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.48-0.67; P < 0.001), vitamin D group compared with placebo. No differences were found in any of the other outcomes. CONCLUSION: Vitamin D supplementation reduced the number of days with ARTI. This supports a recommendation of vitamin D supplementation during extended winter at northern latitudes.

      "abstract": "Natural sources of vitamin D (VD), have been proposed to represent an alternative to synthetic vitamin D in nutritional interventions, also holding therapeutic potential in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). In this study lipidomics was used to comparatively investigate the molecular mechanisms behind the therapeutic effects of a natural VD formulation consisting of a Shitake mushroom extracts (NVD) and a synthetic cholecalciferol formulation (SVD) in HepaRG human hepatocytes exposed to free fatty acid (FFA)-induced lipotoxicity. The results demonstrate that the two VD formulations prevent lipotoxicity with similar efficacy, but different lipidomic fingerprints. Differentially expressed lipids in NVD' in vitro therapeutic effect indicated a reduced synthesis of cellular triglycerides; combined with a marked reshaping of glycerophospholipid metabolism and characteristic changes of the chain length and number of double bonds in the phosphatidylcholine pool that were absent in SVD treatment. Bioinformatics interpretation of lipidomics data associated NVD therapeutic properties to an enhanced insulin function and glycerophospholipid metabolism, whereas SVD was primarily associated with the inflammatory signaling and death pathways of the liver cell. These differences between the two VD formulations were further highlighted matching lipidomics data with gene microarray (transcriptomics) data available from previous studies on this experimental model; the resulting multiomics data identified lipid metabolism nodes specific for the multimolecular mechanisms of the two formulations which may deserve further pre-clinical investigation in the treatment of hepatocyte lipotoxicity."

Our review tries to provide a comprehensive summary of all the relevant articles in the area to assess the association of vitamin D deficiency with the development of DKD and the effect of vitamin D supplementation on the progression of DKD. METHODS: PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Cochrane Library and Web of Science were accessed from inception till June 2024 to obtain all the relevant meta-analyses assessing the function of vitamin D in the onset and prognosis of DKD. The summary data were extracted by two independent reviewers. A Measurement Tool to Assess Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR) 2 tool was used for the assessment of the methodological quality of the included meta-analyses. RESULTS: A total of 4579 articles were obtained from 5 databases in the initial search, of which 8 meta-analyses were included for the evidence synthesis. The methodological quality of the retrieved articles ranged from critically low to high. Serum vitamin D levels were significantly correlated with the prevalence of DKD. The review suggested that vitamin D supplementation could help in reducing proteinuria. However, no such changes were observed in other renal function parameters of DKD patients following vitamin D supplementation. CONCLUSION: The current evidence indicates that vitamin D supplementation could be beneficial in reducing proteinuria among DKD patients.PROSPERO registration number: CRD42022375194."

      "abstract": "Malignant tumors are heterogeneous diseases characterized by uncontrolled cell proliferation, invasion, metastasis, and/or recurrence of their malignancies. In particular, cancer stem cells (CSCs) within these tumors might be responsible for the property of invasiveness and/or therapies-resistance. CSCs are a self-renewing, awfully tumorigenic subpopulation of cancer cells, which are notorious for strong chemoresistance and are frequently responsible the aggravated invasion, metastasis, and/or recurrence. Developing targeting therapies against CSCs, therefore, may be deliberated a more encouraging mission for the greater cancer therapy. Innovation for a more potent anti-CSC treatment has been required as soon as possible. Interestingly, vitamin D could modulate the inflammatory condition of the tumor microenvironment (TME) by successfully affecting CSCs, which has an imperative role in determining the malignant phenotype of CSCs. In addition, vitamin D may also contribute to the regulation of the malignant behaviors of CSCs. Consistently, vitamin D could have potential applications for the significant inhibition of several tumor growths within various cancer therapies. The biological significance of vitamin D for CSCs regulation may be involved in the function of APRO family proteins. Therefore, vitamin D could be one of the innovative therapeutic modalities for the development of novel CSCs related tumor therapies.",

This study aimed to investigate both the separate and joint effects of vitamin D deficiency and sleep disorders on cardiovascular disease mortality, as well as all-cause mortality and cancer mortality. METHODS: We analyzed data from 24,566 adults in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) from 2005 to 2018. Sleep disorders were assessed using self-report questionnaires, and vitamin D levels were measured through serum total 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D]. Cox proportional hazards models were employed to evaluate the associations between separate and joint effects of vitamin D deficiency and sleep disorders with mortality outcomes. RESULTS: Over a median follow-up of 9.08 years, we included a total of 24,566 individuals, in this study. Among them, 2,776 cases were all-cause deaths, 858 were cardiovascular disease deaths, and 644 were cancer deaths. We found that Vitamin D deficiency was independently associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality, while sleep disorders were similarly associated with a higher risk of all-cause mortality. Notably, participants with both vitamin D deficiency and sleep disorders exhibited a significantly higher risk of all-cause mortality (HR, 2.31; 95% CI: 1.36-3.91) and cardiovascular mortality (HR, 2.39; 95% CI, 1.03-5.58) compared to those with only one or neither risk factor, even after adjusting for potential confounders. CONCLUSION: Our study highlights that the combination of vitamin D deficiency and sleep disorders was associated with an increased risk of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in adults. These findings might help to refine dietary and lifestyle intervention strategies for this population."

      "abstract": "Background/Objectives: Low testosterone levels and low vitamin D status are associated with increased cardiometabolic risk. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether vitamin D status determines the cardiometabolic effects of testosterone replacement therapy. Methods: The study population consisted of three groups of men with late-onset hypogonadism: vitamin D-naive individuals with 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels between 20 and 30 ng/mL (group I), males with 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels between 30 and 60 ng/mL receiving vitamin D supplementation because of previous low vitamin D status (group II), and vitamin D-naïve subjects with 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels between 30 and 60 ng/mL (group III). Circulating levels of total testosterone, 25-hydroxyvitamin D, glucose, insulin, lipids, uric acid, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), homocysteine, fibrinogen, and urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR) were assessed before and six months after intramuscular testosterone administration (250 mg every three weeks). Results: Group I differed from the remaining groups in baseline values of 25-hydroxyvitamin D, hsCRP, homocysteine, fibrinogen, UACR, and the Framingham Risk Score. In all three groups, testosterone injections increased plasma testosterone levels and had a neutral effect on 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration. In groups II and III, the drug improved insulin sensitivity and reduced LDL cholesterol, uric acid, hsCRP, homocysteine, fibrinogen, and UACR. In group I, the impact of testosterone was limited to a small decrease in HDL cholesterol and hsCRP. Only in groups II and III did testosterone reduce the Framingham Risk Score. There were no differences in the strength of testosterone action between both groups. In groups II and III, the replacement-induced changes in insulin sensitivity, LDL cholesterol, uric acid, hsCRP, homocysteine, fibrinogen, UACR, and the Framingham Risk Score positively correlated with 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration. Conclusions: The study results suggest that the cardiometabolic effects of exogenous testosterone in men with testosterone deficiency may be determined by vitamin D status.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune disease marked by joint damage and disrupted vitamin D signaling, leading to calcium deposition in joints. This study explores the therapeutic potential of Bavachin (BVN), a phytoestrogen from Psoralea corylifolia, in modulating vitamin D signaling in RA. METHODS: Vitamin D receptor (VDR) structure was modeled using SWISS-MODEL, AlphaFold, and I-TASSER, followed by docking with BVN and Estradiol (E2) via AutoDock Vina. BVN's effects on VDR mRNA and protein levels in RA-FLS were assessed by qRT-PCR and Western blot(WB). VDR-related BVN targets in RA were explored through protein-protein interaction (PPI) network and pathway analysis in Cytoscape. BVN's impact on RXRα expression and VDR-RXRα interaction was examined by WB and immunofluorescence. Alizarin staining evaluated calcium deposition, while qRT-PCR analyzed BVN's regulation of calcium-binding proteins. RESULTS: In silico analysis revealed a strong interaction of VDR with BVN with Gibbs-free energy of -7.2 Kcal/mol with prominent H-bonds. Further, in vitro study in RA-FLS revealed that BVN treatment increased VDR mRNA and protein expression. PPI and pathway enrichment analysis retrieved RXRα as the prominent protein to be targeted by BVN in Vitamin D signaling. BVN treatment also significantly upregulated RXRα expression and enhanced the interaction between VDR and RXRα. Further, BVN modulated associated calcium signaling, reduced calcium deposition in RA-FLS and significantly downregulated calcium-binding proteins CALB1, CALB2, NCX1, TRPV5, and TRPV6. CONCLUSION: Collectively, this study depicted a prominent therapeutic efficacy of BVN in targeting Vitamin D signaling and associated calcium deposition to alleviate RA pathogenesis.",

      "abstract": "The inhibitory effects of the tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) antibody infliximab (IFX) on colitis are well established. Since IFX dosing is weight-based and associated with various side effects, there is a growing interest in identifying combination therapies that can enhance its efficacy, particularly in overweight inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients, to maximize the anti-inflammatory effect while minimizing the required dose. Our research revealed that overweight IBD patients present decreased vitamin D levels in the intestinal epithelium alongside elevated TNF-α levels. In mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD) for four weeks, treatment with the vitamin D analog palicalcitol (PAL) reduced lipid synthesis and TNF-α production in intestinal epithelial cells (IECs). In a 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced experimental colitis model, PAL treatment mitigated TNF-α-induced damage to the intestinal epithelial barrier and reduced the activation of Th1 and Th17 cells in the lamina propria, thereby reducing colitis development in HFD-fed mice. Notably, the combination of IFX and PAL was more effective than IFX alone in treating colitis in these mice. Overall, our findings suggest that vitamin D inhibits TNF-α production by reducing lipid synthesis in IECs, thereby enhancing IFX therapy in overweight IBD patients.",

      "abstract": "Background/Objectives: The gonadotropin-lowering effects of metformin were found to be more pronounced in the case of coexisting hyperthyroidism and absent in patients with hypovitaminosis D. Thus, the aim of the current study was to determine whether vitamin D status determines pituitary effects of metformin in individuals with thyroid hyperfunction and elevated gonadotropin levels. Methods: This prospective cohort study included three matched groups of postmenopausal women with hyperthyroidism and prediabetes: women with 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels between 50 and 75 nmol/L (uncompensated vitamin D insufficiency), women with 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels between 75 and 150 nmol/L receiving exogenous calciferol due to previously diagnosed vitamin D deficiency/insufficiency (compensated vitamin D deficiency/insufficiency), and calciferol-naïve subjects with 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels between 75 and 150 nmol/L (the control group). Over the entire study period (six months), all the women were treated with metformin. At the beginning and at the end of this study, we determined 25-hydroxyvitamin D, glucose homeostasis markers, gonadotropins, estradiol, progesterone, TSH, free thyroid hormones, prolactin, ACTH, and IGF-1. Results: Before metformin treatment, except for the 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels, there were no between-group differences in the investigated markers. In all the study groups, metformin reduced plasma glucose, HOMA1-IR, glycated hemoglobin, and FSH, but these effects were more pronounced in both groups of women with normal vitamin D status than in women with uncompensated vitamin D insufficiency. The decrease in LH concentration was observed only in patients with compensated vitamin D deficiency/insufficiency and in the control group. There were no differences between the baseline and follow-up levels of the remaining hormones. The impact of metformin on gonadotropin concentrations positively correlated with their baseline values, free thyroid hormone levels, 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels, and metformin-induced changes in HOMA1-IR. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that low vitamin D status impairs the gonadotropin-lowering effects of metformin in individuals with hyperthyroidism."

      "abstract": "Periodontitis is a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by the destruction of tooth-supporting structures, influenced by immune system dysregulation, oxidative stress, and imbalances in bone metabolism. Given its multifactorial pathogenesis, bioactive compounds such as vitamin D, melatonin, and omega-3 fatty acids have emerged as potential adjuncts to periodontal therapy due to their immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidative properties. This narrative review explores the role of these three supplements in periodontal health, their potential in synergistic effects, and existing research gaps, providing a foundation for future studies on their clinical applications. Vitamin D is essential for calcium homeostasis, bone remodeling, and immune function. It modulates both innate and adaptive immune responses, enhancing antimicrobial peptide production and reducing inflammatory cytokine expression. Omega-3 fatty acids reduce the production of pro-inflammatory eicosanoids while promoting the synthesis of pro-resolving lipid mediators, contributing to bone preservation and immune balance. Melatonin, known for its antioxidant and osteogenic properties, supports bone remodeling by stimulating osteoblast proliferation and inhibiting osteoclast activity, while also regulating circadian rhythms, which may influence oral health. Although these bioactive compounds show promising effects in preclinical and clinical studies, significant knowledge gaps remain regarding optimal dosages, long-term efficacy, combined use, and standardized treatment protocols. Further clinical trials are necessary to elucidate their therapeutic value in periodontal disease management, especially those focused on their potential synergistic mechanisms. Understanding their synergistic mechanisms may open new avenues for adjunctive strategies in periodontal therapy."

      "abstract": "The role of serum 25-OH D3 (D3) in the physiology and regulation of the female genital system has gained significant research interest. Recent data have suggested that sufficient D3 levels are associated with improved outcomes of in vitro fertilization (IVF), although other studies failed to confirm so. Screening for D3 levels before IVF is becoming common practice in many IVF centres, and D3 insufficiency is treated with supplements before treatment. However, little is known about the effect of this intervention on D3 levels during endometrial preparation for frozen-embryo transfer (FET) cycles, especially regarding clinical outcomes. To examine the effect of vitamin D supplementation and the impact of vitamin D status in women undergoing FET cycles, a prospective study of infertile women undergoing FET cycles was carried out. Initial screening of D3 levels was performed in 252 infertile women before a FET cycle, and where insufficiency was found (<30 ng/mL) [115 (45.6%)], supplements were prescribed according to a standardized protocol. Serum D3 levels were measured at three distinct time-points: at the initiation of endometrial preparation (T1), embryo transfer (T2), and beta-hCG testing (T3). We found no significant difference in ongoing pregnancy [40 (34.8%) vs. 51 (37.2%); odds ratio (OR) 0.90, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.54-1.51; adjusted OR 1.04, 95% CI 0.58-1.83], live birth, positive β-hCG, clinical pregnancy, miscarriage, and ectopic pregnancy rates between D3-insufficient participants at T1 receiving vitamin D and D3-replete ones not receiving any supplementation (p-values >0.05). We also found no significant difference in ongoing pregnancy [21 (30.9%) vs. 66 (40.2%), and 17 (34.0%) vs. 51 (41.5%)] and the rest of the outcomes between D3-insufficient and replete participants at T2 and T3, respectively (p-values >0.05). In conclusion, this prospective cohort study of women undergoing FET cycles found no significant difference in ongoing pregnancy rates between D3-insufficient participants receiving supplementation at the beginning of endometrial preparation and replete ones receiving no supplementation. Large, high-quality trials are required to further investigate this hypothesis and compare the IVF outcomes between replete participants, insufficient participants receiving no supplementation, and insufficient participants receiving supplementation.",

      "abstract": "Vitamin D has the potential to therapeutically affect the endocrine parameters of premature ovarian insufficiency (POI) patients. Previous research has indicated that serum vitamin D levels tend to decline with age and in individuals with POI. However, the precise impact of vitamin D deficiency on female fertility, especially their ovarian function, remains unclear. Vitamin D receptor (VDR) deficiency mice provide a model to investigate the possible effect of vitamin D on female reproduction. In this study, we observed abnormal follicular development in the Vdr deficiency mice. This anomaly is associated with reduced expression of anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) and disrupted aromatase expression that disrupts the hormone secretion. Moreover, our findings indicate that Vdr deficiency disturbs redox balance, resulting in oxidative stress in the ovary, which further suppresses granulosa cell function and accelerates ovarian aging. Mechanistically, loss of Vdr inhibits de novo cholesterol synthesis by transcriptional repression of Hmgcr, and the antioxidant and anti-aging effects of the intermediate product 7-dehydrocholesterol (7-DHC) are also decreased. Treatment with 7-DHC effectively reduces ROS levels and alleviates aging in KGN cells deficient in Vdr. In conclusion, our results show that Vdr deficiency impairs follicle maturation and hormone secretion by accelerating granulosa cell aging, as a result of the reduced antioxidant and anti-aging effect of 7-DHC."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The cosmetic industry is booming with unorthodox therapies aimed at improving the appearance of beauty and strength. One such therapy is self-administered, intramuscular injections of paraffin oil for the purpose of increasing presumed muscular size. Paraffin oil injections are becoming frequent among younger male individuals, who inject up to several liters in (primarily) the upper extremities. However, paraffin oil leads to the formation of granulomas, which are rich in macrophages with an upregulated extrarenal 1-hydroxylation. These macrophages will rapidly and unimpededly convert inactive vitamin D (25OHD2) to active vitamin D (1,25OH2D3), thereby causing significant hypercalcemia and derivative disease. CASE PRESENTATION: In 2007, a Scandinavian male individual in his 20s had self-injected 1200 ml of paraffin oil into both biceps. Within 5 years, the oil had migrated and was then widely dispersed in his biceps and surrounding tissues, causing swelling and pain. By 2015, granulomas had formed at injection sites, and he was admitted to a hospital with severe hypercalcemia, which was managed with fluid therapy and slowly resolved. From 2015 to 2020, his calcium levels were intermittently elevated, and he experienced two episodes of nephrolithiasis requiring surgical intervention. In 2020, he was prescribed one dose oral vitamin D (6000 µg cholecalciferol) for suspected vitamin D deficiency based on a low serum 25OHD2. His episodic hypercalcemia increased, and he developed nephrolithiasis and exacerbated renal impairment. CONCLUSION: Unlike most other patients with low 25(OH)D2, patients with granulomatous disease should not routinely receive vitamin D supplementation, as this may aggravate hypercalcemia and hypercalcuria, causing nephrolithiasis and renal impairment.",

METHODS: This study was designed as a prospective, longitudinal study. We enrolled healthy adults with vitamin D deficiency. Baseline optical coherence tomography angiography parameters compared after vitamin D supplementation treatment. RESULTS: In the treated group, the mean whole, parafoveal, and perifoveal vessel density in deep capillary plexus were significantly reduced compared to the baseline (p=0.019, p=0.023, p=0.012, respectively). Additionally, the final whole, parafoveal, and perifoveal vessel density in deep capillary plexus were inversely related to the vitamin D changes (Spearman's rho:-0.516, p=0.024; Spearman's rho:-0.524, p=0.019; Spearman's rho:-0.569, p=0.012, respectively). Vascular parameters did not change in the untreated group compared to the baseline. CONCLUSION: Although the effects of some confounding factors, such as exposure time to sunlight and dietary vitamin D intake in the study, were not yet known, vitamin D supplementation therapy appeared to affect retinal microvasculature. Optic coherence tomography angiography might indicate noninvasively the effectiveness or sufficiency of vitamin D treatment at the microvascular level, although the observed changes in the retinal vessels are as yet not fully understood."

METHODS: Conducted in conformity with the PRISMA statement, a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials (RCT) was performed assessing postoperative hypocalcemia and postoperative symptomatic hypocalcemia. RESULTS: The search strategy yielded 3808 potentially relevant publications, with eight RCTs ultimately included. These eight trials included a total of 902 patients (22.73% male, n = 205/902), with a median age of 48.9 years (95% CI, 43.5-53.5). Four trials administered only vitamin D in the interventional arm, three trials administered both calcium and vitamin D in the interventional arm, and one trial administered vitamin D in the interventional arm and calcium in both arms. Pooled results from the eight included trials showed a reduced risk of postoperative hypocalcemia in the intervention arm (RR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.62-0.96; p = 0.02). When excluding the studies that administered calcium supplements in addition to vitamin D, the pooled results showed a similar reduced risk of postoperative hypocalcemia (RR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.57-0.96; p = 0.03). Analysis of six trials reporting the incidence of postoperative symptomatic hypocalcemia (n = 564) showed a reduced risk in the vitamin D arm, with or without calcium, compared to the control arm (RR, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.34-0.93; p = 0.023). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that preoperative vitamin D administration, with or without calcium carbonate, significantly reduces the risk of postoperative hypocalcemia and symptomatic hypocalcemia in patients undergoing total thyroidectomy."

In recent years, the protective role of vitamin D and its receptor signaling pathway in DKD has garnered widespread attention. Vitamin D plays an important role in the onset and progression of DKD by participating in the regulation of insulin secretion, inhibiting inflammatory responses, attenuating podocyte injury, modulating the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), and inhibiting renal interstitial fibrosis through its receptor (VDR). Studies on the use of vitamin D and its receptors in DKD have increased gradually in recent years, with a focus on the development of vitamin D analogs and the clinical application of VDR activators. This study reviewed the mechanisms of vitamin D and its receptor in diabetic nephropathy, as well as the potential for therapeutic applications and associated adverse effects. It also analyzed current research hotspots and development trends based on bibliometrics. Future research should focus on further optimizing vitamin D-based therapeutic strategies to achieve better clinical efficacy and safety.",

A high prevalence of varicose vein disease has been observed in obese patients in association with lower plasma levels of vitamin D. The present pilot study aimed to investigate the acute effects of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1,25(OH)2D3], the biologically active form of vitamin D, on oxidative stress in varicose veins obtained from both obese and non-obese patients undergoing cryostripping surgery for varicose vein ablation. Varicose venous samples treated or not with 1,25(OH)2D3 (100 nM, 12-h incubation) were analysed for reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation using the ferrous xylenol orange oxidation (FOX) assay and immunofluorescence technique. Additionally, the gene expression of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS), and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) was assessed via qPCR. We report a significant reduction in circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 [25(OH)D3] levels in obese as compared to non-obese patients. Ex vivo incubation of the venous samples with 1,25(OH)2D3 resulted in: (i) significant reduction in ROS level, (ii) upregulation of eNOS and nNOS expression, and (iii) downregulation of iNOS expression in both groups of patients. Vitamin D did not exhibit a ROS scavenger effect, and the antioxidant effect is presumably mediated via its receptor whose presence was confirmed in the varicose venous samples. In conclusion, vitamin D exerts protective effects in venous pathology, which may be beneficial in acute administration prior to the surgical intervention. Large clinical trials are required to assess the optimal dosage and time/duration of administration in patients with chronic venous disease with surgical indication."

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: The CALLY index integrates C-reactive protein (CRP), albumin and lymphocyte counts to accurately reflect the inflammatory, nutritional and immune status of the body. Multiple studies have indicated that the CALLY index plays a key role in a variety of diseases, especially asthma, and is closely associated with inflammatory response, airway remodeling and immune imbalance in asthma. Research has shown that vitamin D is associated with asthma susceptibility, severity, and control, and its levels may influence inflammatory and immune markers associated with the CALLY index, which may play a role in the association between the CALLY index and asthma. PATIENTS: Using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) from 2001 to 2010, the association between CALLY index and asthma and the role of vitamin D in American adults were analyzed in depth. Through multiple logistic regression, subgroup analysis, and other statistical means, the potential pathophysiological links between the three are revealed, providing theoretical support for the prevention and treatment of related diseases. RESULTS: A total of 17,946 individuals were included in this study, of which 2,317 were diagnosed with asthma. Fully adjusted multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that the CALLY index was significantly negatively associated with asthma, with an odds ratio (OR) of 0.996 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.993-0.999]. Specifically, each unit increase in the CALLY index was associated with a 0.996-fold reduction in asthma risk. In addition, mediation effect analysis showed that vitamin D partially mediated the association between the CALLY index and asthma, with a mediation ratio of 3.36%. CONCLUSION: This study reveals an association between the CALLY index and reduced risk of asthma in the US population and suggests that vitamin D plays an incomplete mediating role. This finding provides a new theoretical basis for the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of asthma and is expected to be a potential biomarker."

R language was utilized to integrate differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between hypertension samples and healthy control samples in GSE24752 and GSE75360 datasets, followed by GO analysis, KEGG enrichment analysis, and GSEA. Key genes were screened based on the expression levels of DEGs using logistic regression, LASSO regression, and support vector machine (SVM). A visualized protein-protein interaction regulatory network was constructed, and immune cell infiltration analysis was performed on integrated GEO datasets of hypertensive samples. Collect serum samples from hypertensive subjects and healthy control subjects for RT-qPCR detection of key gene expression. A total of 1005 DEGs were obtained from peripheral blood samples of 13 hypertension cases and 14 control samples. GO analysis, KEGG enrichment analysis, and GSEA revealed that the DEGs function synergistically in various biological pathways. LASSO regression and SVM identified six key genes related to pyroptosis (CASP7 (caspase-7), CYBB, NEK7, NLRP2, RAB5A, VDR (vitamin D receptor)). Immune infiltration analysis showed that activated B cell, effector memory CD8 T cell, immature B cell, MDSC, and T follicular helper cell accounted for the largest proportion of immune cells. RT-qPCR results indicated significantly higher relative expression levels of caspase-7 and vitamin D receptor in hypertensive samples compared to controls. These findings suggest that CASP7 and the vitamin D receptor gene may offer new research targets for the diagnosis and treatment of hypertension, and they also provide fresh evidence for the involvement of pyroptosis in hypertension.",

METHODS: We comprehensively searched the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform to identify registered RCTs that assessed the effects of vitamin D supplement on pain outcomes in people with primary dysmenorrhea or endometriosis. The primary outcomes of interest were pain severity/intensity, pain duration, pain medication usage and pain-related outcome measurements. RESULTS: Seven registered RCTs were included in this systematic review. These RCTs had diverse doses and treatment durations of vitamin D supplement used as intervention. They also had either high or some concerns of risk of bias, according to Cochrane risk of bias version 2 assessment. Substantial heterogeneities were generally observed across the seven RCTs. When measured using a validated tool visual analogue scale (VAS), pain severity was significantly lower at the end of treatment when compared with placebo (mean difference MD -1.12, 95% confidence interval [-2.16, -0.07], I2=81%, 5 studies, n = 308). This significant difference was observed in the primary dysmenorrhea RCTs, but not the endometriosis RCTs. CONCLUSION: This systematic review identified vitamin D may reduce pain associated with primary dysmenorrhea, though a low certainty of evidence was available. Future studies that use standardised doses and treatment duration in accordance with the latest clinical practice guidelines are needed to explore any potential benefits vitamin D may have for people with these conditions.",

      "abstract": "Tuberculosis is an infectious disease caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) and is a growing public health problem worldwide. Within the innate immune response, we highlight the secretion of the antimicrobial peptide LL-37, which is crucial for Mtb elimination in infected cells. Previous reports have shown that CEBPα activation induces LL-37 independently of its main inducer, vitamin D, under endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. In this study, we report that infection with Mtb causes ER stress in pulmonary epithelial cells and macrophages. The stress induces the activation of CEBPα, which in turn promotes the LL-37 expression. Furthermore, the participation of CEBPα is necessary for the correct clearance of Mtb in an in vitro infection model. We identify candidate drugs (mycophenolic acid, indapamide, and glibenclamide) capable of activating CEBPα and promoting LL-37 through in silico assays. The effect of the drugs was corroborated by gene and protein expression analysis. Finally, we observed that treatment with these drugs improves bacterial clearance in infected cells. Our results lead us to suggest CEBPα as a potential therapeutic target as an adjuvant in the standard treatment of tuberculosis, seeking a reduction in treatment time, and thus a lower appearance of drug resistance."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship between concentrations of vitamin D metabolites in follicular fluid and outcome of assisted reproductive technology (ART) treatment. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study including 116 women undergoing in vitro fertilization (IVF) or intra cytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) treatment. RESULTS: All measured vitamin D metabolites 25OHD3, 1,25(OH)2D3 and 24,25(OH)2D3 are detectable in follicular fluid. Follicular fluid concentration of the 24,25(OH)2D3 metabolite was higher than corresponding serum values, while the opposite phenomenon was observed for the 1,25(OH)2D3 metabolite. Local conversion is plausible as the vitamin D activating enzymes (CYP2R1 and CYP27B1) as well as the vitamin D receptor (VDR) are highly expressed in the developing follicle. Women who achieved a live birth had 29 % higher 24,25(OH)2D3 and 15 % higher 25OHD3 concentrations in their follicular fluid (18 ± 7.9 versus 14 ± 6.2 nmol/L, p = 0.008 and 71 ± 22 versus 62 ± 18 nmol/L, p = 0.025, respectively) compared to women not achieving a live birth. Moreover, women with a low (≤ 15 %) follicular fluid 1,25(OH)2D3/24,25(OH)2D3 ratio had a higher live birth rate compared to women with a medium (16-84 %) or high (≥ 85 %) ratio (live birth rate: 53 % vs 29 % and 12 %, respectively, p = 0.032). CONCLUSION: This study reveals that high levels of 24,25(OH)2D3 and low levels of the 1,25(OH)2D3/24,25(OH)2D3 ratio in follicular fluid are associated with increased live birth rates in women undergoing IVF/ICSI treatment. Conversion of vitamin D metabolites systemically or in the ovarian follicle may affect ART outcome. Further studies are warranted to support the findings from this pilot study and identify regulators of ovarian vitamin D metabolites."

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to assess whether Vitamin D (Vit D) supplementation affects local disease progression, as well as systemic inflammation, collagen degradation, and oxidative stress in adolescents affected by Keratoconus (KC) and Vit D deficiency. DESIGN: Prospective, interventional single-center study. SUBJECTS: Forty patients (age range, 12.2-19.9) presenting with both KC and Vit D insufficiency (<30 ng/mL) were included in the study. METHODS: Vit D was prescribed for 6 months as per standard of care. Follow-up visits were scheduled for 12 months. Each visit included the measurement of best spectacle-corrected visual acuity (BSCVA) , maximal keratometry (Kmax) , and thinnest corneal thickness (TCT) . Blood samples were collected at month 0 (M0) and month 6 (M6) to measure Vit D levels and systemic biomarkers of inflammation, collagen degradation, and oxidative stress by ELISA or RT-PCR; full RNA sequencing was performed on 20 patients at M0 and M6. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome of the study was the percentage of patients with a Kmax progression less than 1 diopter (D) throughout the entire study (i.e.: stable patients) . RESULTS: 65% of patients remained stable (75% of eyes) after 12 months. Specifically, BSCVA, Kmax, and TCT rates remained stable during the 12-month observational period. ELISA performed on blood plasma showed that Vit D upregulated the expression of VDBP. QPCR performed on peripheral leukocytes showed an increase in the expression of VDR and CD14 with no changes in the principal enzymes involved in Vit D activation/deactivation. ELISA and qPCR showed the modulation of collagen degradation and collagen crosslinking. Subgroup analysis with RNA sequencing showed differential response to Vit D treatment. Responder patients showed downregulation in inflammatory and platelet activation pathways, and upregulation of proteoglycan metabolism/biosynthesis enrichment. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings support the hypothesis that Vit D supplementation can affect KC progression in adolescent patients with Vit D insufficiency possibly through the modulation of systemic inflammation, inhibition of collagen degradation and promotion of proteoglycan synthesis. Our results strongly suggest that KC may be the ocular manifestation of a systemic disorder."

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: Vitamin D (Vit D) deficiency has been associated with both obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) as well as with their combination, known as overlap syndrome (OS). There is evidence that continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) may lead to an increase of Vit D levels in OSA patients. However, the effect of CPAP treatment on Vit D levels in OS patients has yet to be determined. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of one year of CPAP therapy on Vit D levels in patients with OS. METHODS: Vit D serum levels were measured in consecutive OS patients at baseline and after one year of CPAP therapy. Compliance with CPAP therapy was assessed by the data retrieved from the CPAP device. RESULTS: Vit D serum levels were measured in 46 OS patients (43 males). Among participants, 27 had good and 19 poor compliance with CPAP therapy. Results showed that serum Vit D levels increased after 12 months of CPAP therapy from 21.3 ± 8.4 to 23.8 ± 8.7 ng/ml (p = 0.001). Moreover, patients with good CPAP compliance demonstrated higher serum 25(OH)D levels compared to those with poor compliance (25.8 ± 7.6 versus 20.4 ± 9.6 ng/ml, respectively; p = 0.038). CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, 12 months of CPAP therapy improved Vit D serum levels in OS patients, more so in compliant patients.",

      "abstract": "Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common critical clinical disease with high morbidity and mortality rates. Ischemia-reperfusion (IR) is the main cause of AKI, and there is no effective treatment or prevention. Therefore, it is critical to screen for effective therapeutic agents and to find therapeutic targets. DKS26 is a derivative of oleanolic acid (OA) optimized for bioavailability while retaining the anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and anti-apoptotic properties of OA. This study aimed to investigate the therapeutic effects of DKS26 on AKI and its underlying molecular mechanisms. We established an AKI model in vivo and in vitro and observed that DKS26 had an ameliorative effect on IR or H/R-induced renal tubular epithelial cell injury and reduced oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis. Meanwhile, Swiss TargetPrediction and AutoDock Vina analysis revealed that DKS26 may interact with vitamin D receptors (VDR) through hydrogen bonding, suggesting that DKS26 may exert effects through VDR. In this study, we found that DKS26 treatment enhanced the stability of the VDR protein, promoted the binding of VDR to p-NF-κB P65Ser311, reduced the entry of p-NF-κB P65Ser311 into the nucleus, and inhibited the transcription of downstream inflammatory genes as well as their own expression, thus exerting its protective effect. In summary, these findings suggest that DKS26 may be a promising preventive strategy and provide a theoretical and experimental basis for AKI treatment.",

OBJECTIVE: To explore the relationship between Vitamin D and Vitamin A levels in children and identify any critical thresholds. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted from 2018 to 2021 in Ningbo, Zhejiang, China. Participants were children aged 0 to 14 years attending community health service centers for routine health check-ups. Multivariate linear regression analysis was conducted to ascertain the association between serum Vitamin D and Vitamin A levels. A smooth curve fitting approach was employed to analyze the dose-response relationship between Vitamin D and Vitamin A. RESULTS: A total of 4,752 participants were included. The study revealed significant variations in baseline Vitamin D and Vitamin A levels across different deficiency categories. Mean Vitamin D levels were lowest in the severe deficiency group (4.9 ng/mL) and highest in the normal group (34.8 ± 9.8 ng/mL), while mean Vitamin A levels were lowest in the deficiency group (226.6 ± 72.2 ng/mL) and highest in the normal group (263.3 ± 74.0 ng/mL). The study revealed a two-phase linear relationship with a significant threshold effect at a Vitamin D level of 28.289 ng/mL. Below this threshold, the association between Vitamin D and Vitamin A was strong (β = 2.935, 95% CI: 2.173, 3.696), while above the threshold, the association was significantly weaker (β = 0.737, 95% CI: 0.413, 1.061). The likelihood ratio test confirmed the significance of this threshold effect (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: The study concludes that a significant threshold at 28.289 ng/mL Vitamin D marks a point beyond which the association with Vitamin A levels plateaus, highlighting the importance of this threshold for optimizing vitamin status in children."

      "abstract": "Stress is associated with various health issues. Research has highlighted the relationship between chronic stress and male reproductive health. One of the primary mechanisms underlying stress-induced male reproductive dysfunction is impaired steroidogenesis. In the present study, we validated a chronic unpredictable stress (CUS) model and investigated testicular dysfunction in CUS rats. The CUS paradigm involved exposing rats to a variety of stressors daily for 8 weeks. Vitamin D (10 µg/kg/twice a week, p.o) was administered to CUS rats starting 2 weeks after the onset of stress exposure and continued until the end of study. The stress in rats was confirmed by the occurrence of anxiety and depressive-like behaviours through elevated plus-maze test & novelty-suppressed feeding test and rise in serum corticosterone levels. Testicular dysfunction in CUS rats was assessed via serum gonadotropins, testosterone, cytokines, oxidative stress, and testis-epididymis-sperm morphology. The reduction in steroidogenesis was confirmed via immunohistochemical analysis of 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase-3 (17β-HSD3), steroidogenic acute regulatory gene (StAR) and vitamin D receptor (VDR) expression. Further, we studied the role of vitamin D in alleviating stress-induced testicular damage and the potential mechanisms underlying steroidogenic alterations in CUS rats. Notably, vitamin D treatment prevented CUS-induced decline in testicular 17β-HSD3, StAR and VDR expression. Moreover, vitamin D ameliorated the CUS-induced reduction in serum testosterone levels. Histological assessment revealed that vitamin D prevented CUS-induced damage in sperm, testis and epididymis morphology. In conclusion, our findings suggest that CUS exposure induces testicular dysfunction, which can be prevented by vitamin D, potentially through the regulation of steroidogenic pathways."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Achieving a pCR serves as a biomarker indicating enhanced overall survival for breast cancer patients undergoing NST. Vitamin D enhances the antitumor effect of chemotherapeutics as demonstrated in cancer cells and animal models. In this prospective randomized clinical study, we aim to investigate the effect of oral vitamin D supplementation during neoadjuvant systemic therapy (NST) on pathologic complete response (pCR). METHODS: Between June 2019 and June 2023, an oral form of 50,000 IU vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) replacement was administered once a week during NST for the study group. RESULTS: There were 114 (50.2%) cases in the study group and 113 (49.8%) in the control group (totally 227 cases). Factors that positively influenced pCR were higher clinical T stage, higher AJCC clinical stage, Estrogen receptor negativity, progesterone receptor negativity, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 positivity, high Ki-67 expression (≥ 20%), hormone negative molecular subtypes, and vitamin D intake in univariate analysis. In the multivariate analysis, factors significantly affecting pCR were vitamin D intake (OR: 2.33, 95% CI 1.20-4.53; p = 0.013), hormone receptor negativity (OR: 2.22, 95% CI 1.11-4.43; p = 0.024), and Ki-67 ≥ 20% (OR: 3.27, 95% CI 1.03-10.34; p = 0.044). CONCLUSIONS: This is the first and only study to compare the effect of oral vitamin D supplementation on pCR during NST. Vitamin D supplementation during NST has a significant effect on pCR in breast cancer patients. Although this effect is not significant for axillary pCR, there is an almost significant correlation.

      "abstract": "Calcium and vitamin D are essential nutrients for maintaining skeletal health, yet deficiencies in these nutrients are particularly widespread in regions such as Asia and Africa. Inadequate intake of these nutrients in these areas has been associated with diminished bone integrity and a rising incidence of osteoporosis. This review examines the underlying mechanisms of bone loss driven by calcium and vitamin D deficiencies, emphasizing their crucial roles in bone metabolism. It also presents strategies to improve nutrient intake, such as fortification of staple foods and supplementation, along with lifestyle modifications including increased physical activity, sun exposure, and dietary education, to prevent bone loss effectively. Special consideration is given to vulnerable populations, including older adults, individuals with limited sun exposure, and those with dietary restrictions, who are at higher risk of deficiency. The review further evaluates public health strategies, including government-initiated fortification and educational programs, as essential measures for tackling widespread nutrient deficiencies. Lastly, it explores future avenues for addressing calcium and vitamin D deficiencies, including the potential role of digital health tools, personalized nutrition, and innovative public health policies to alleviate the global burden of bone-related diseases."

      "abstract": "We report on a 3-year and 5-month-old boy who was referred for suspected rickets, due to knee valgus deformity developed over the previous year. The child had a history of epilepsy well-controlled with phenobarbital. His psychomotor development and growth metrics were appropriate for his age. On admission, laboratory work-up revealed elevated alkaline phosphatase (1289 U/L) and parathyroid hormone (PTH) (417 pg/ml), normal corrected calcium (9,3 mg/dl) and creatinine (0,21 mg/dl), low phosphate (3,2 mg/dl), 25-hydroxy vitamin D (6 ng/ml) and 1-25 hydroxy vitamin D (13.4 pg/mL, nv 20-80) concentrations. Urinalysis indicated low tubular reabsorption of phosphate (TRP % 10,7), along with bicarbonate, uric acid and amino acid loss, consistent with renal Fanconi syndrome. Based on these results, a genetic form of renal tubular dysfunction was suspected, and thus a clinical exome sequencing was requested. In the meanwhile, the child was commenced on Joulie solution (70 mg/kg/day of phosphate), calcitriol (0.03 mcg/kg/die), and ergocalciferol (1000 IU daily). FGF-23 concentrations were found to be within the normal range, thus ruling out FGF23-dependent forms of rickets. Surprisingly, we observed a dramatic improvement in laboratory parameters within two weeks from the treatment initiation, including normalisation of phosphate and PTH concentrations and resolution of Fanconi syndrome, prompting discontinuation of phosphate supplements. Molecular analysis identified a de novo monoallelic mutation (C.1006 + 1 G>A) in the solute carrier family 34 member 1(SLC34A1) gene encoding a protein involved in actively transporting phosphate into cells via Na+ cotransport in the renal brush border membrane. However, even without phosphate substitution no further drops in serum phosphate concentrations and persistently normal proximal renal tubular function were observed. Moreover the rickets changes had almost healed six months after starting vitamin D supplementation. This case provides further evidence that vitamin D deficiency may rarely cause renal Fanconi syndrome, reversible upon vitamin D replacement. This is particularly relevant in children with risk factors for vitamin D deficiency, including use of anticonvulsants.",

Vitamin D deficiency has been suggested to influence cancer progression and survival outcomes in various malignancies. AIM: This study aimed to investigate the association between Vitamin D deficiency and disease progression as well as survival in patients diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted, including 151 patients diagnosed with pancreatic cancer between 2012 and 2022. Serum Vitamin D levels at the time of diagnosis were measured. Disease progression was evaluated through radiological assessments and clinical reports. Survival outcomes, including overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS), were analyzed using Kaplan-Meier survival curves and Cox proportional hazards regression models. RESULTS: Of the 151 patients, 84 (56 %) were identified as Vitamin D deficient at the time of diagnosis. The deficient group exhibited a significantly higher frequency of advanced-stage disease (stages III and IV) compared to the non-deficient group (p < 0.05). During the follow-up period, 66 (78.6 %) of Vitamin d-deficient patients and 56 (84.8 %) of non-deficient patients experienced disease progression (p = 0.51). Moreover, Kaplan-Meier analysis showed a non-significant trend toward shorter median PFS (8.95 months vs. 9.27 months, p = 0.51) and OS (17.64 months vs. 19.05 months, p = 0.616) in the Vitamin d-deficient group. CONCLUSION: Vitamin D deficiency is prevalent among patients with pancreatic cancer and appears to be associated with more advanced disease at diagnosis. Although a trend toward poorer survival outcomes was observed, the association between Vitamin D deficiency and OS/PFS did not reach statistical significance. Additional prospective studies are needed to confirm these findings and explore potential benefits of Vitamin D supplementation in pancreatic cancer management."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: In humans, vitamin D3 synthesis follows a day-night rhythm due to its UV-B-dependent production. RESULTS: As part of the VitDHiD intervention study, we identified 87 in vivo vitamin D target genes with circadian expression patterns in immune cells, forming a regulatory network centered on transcription factors and membrane receptors. These genes exhibit a narrow basal expression range, with 80% downregulated upon vitamin D3 supplementation. Clustering analysis revealed six distinct gene groups, with the two most prominent clusters driven by the transcription factor CSRNP1 (cysteine- and serine-rich nuclear protein 1) and GAS7 (growth arrest-specific 7), a known differentiation inducer. Among the 25 VitDHiD study participants, we identified two subgroups distinguished by significant differences in the responsiveness of 14 in vivo vitamin D target genes. These genes encode transcription factors like CSRNP1, as well as metabolic enzymes and transporters, including NAMPT (nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase), PFKFB3 (6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase 3), and SLC2A3 (solute carrier family 2 member 3). Notably, all 14 genes possess a vitamin D receptor-binding enhancer within a reasonable distance of their transcription start site. CONCLUSIONS: These findings highlight a novel link between vitamin D signaling and circadian gene regulation, with potential implications for personalized supplementation strategies.",

      "abstract": "Background: Childhood obesity is a public health issue worldwide, recognized as a complex condition associated with multiple deficiencies in nutrients, such as vitamin D deficiency, iron-deficiency anemia, or abnormalities in serum calcium or phosphorus levels, despite an excess caloric intake. Objective: This study aims to investigate the prevalence of these deficiencies in overweight/obese children and to assess the correlation between vitamin D/serum iron levels and body mass index (BMI). Methods: The observational study was conducted on 69 Romanian overweight and obese children, aged 2 to 17, admitted to the Pediatrics Department of \"Grigore Alexandrescu\" Hospital in Bucharest over a 15-month period. The age- and gender-specific BMI percentiles were used to classify participants into three groups: overweight (≥85th and <95th BMI percentile), obese (≥95th BMI percentile), and severely obese (>120% of 95th BMI percentile). Data analysis focused on identifying the need for screening and targeted treatment in this pediatric population. Results: Hypovitaminosis D (defined as a serum level of 25(OH)D < 30 ng/mL) prevalence was significantly higher in the severe obesity category (71.5%) compared to the obesity (69%) and overweight (61.5%) groups. Iron deficiency and iron-deficiency anemia were both more prevalent in overweight children, with rates of 50% and 38.5%, respectively. Negative moderate correlations were found both between serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels and children's age (r = -0.444, p-value < 0.0001), as well as between serum 25(OH)D levels and BMI (r = -0.31, p = 0.015), with no statistically significant correlation between serum iron level and BMI in this cohort (r = -0.02, p > 0.05). Conclusions: Severe obesity could be regarded as an associated factor for vitamin D insufficiency as this is highly prevalent in severely obese children, with 25(OH)D levels decreasing with the increase in BMI. Overweight children demonstrated an increased prevalence of iron deficiency in the overweight category, suggesting that the adipose tissue contributes to chronic inflammation, disrupting iron homeostasis. Given the high prevalence of nutritional deficiencies in this population, implementing systematic screening and treatment programs would be beneficial to prevent long-term adverse outcomes.",

      "abstract": "Background/Objectives: Vitamin D is classically associated with calcium and phosphate homeostasis, but recent research has expanded its role to include several new roles such as immune regulation, inflammation, and potential anti-cancer properties. The vitamin D receptor (VDR) is expressed in over 400 tissues, including those of the head and neck, implying a potential link between vitamin D and head and neck cancers (HNCs). Given the need for newer and better therapeutic approaches, this systematic review aims to synthesize existing clinical evidence on the relationship between vitamin D status and clinical outcomes in HNC patients. Methods and Results: A comprehensive literature search, across multiple databases including PubMed, Google Scholar and Science Direct, identified 187,642 studies related to vitamin D and cancer, from which 16 studies met the inclusion criteria. The inclusion criteria were English-language, full-text original research (2015-2025) on vitamin D's role in HNC progression and treatment, focusing on human studies. The findings indicate that vitamin D deficiency is highly prevalent among HNC patients, with rates ranging from 47% to 95%, particularly in advanced-stage cancers and those undergoing intensive treatment. Inverse association between vitamin D levels and HNC risk was reported, with higher serum 25(OH)D levels linked to a 30-32% reduction in cancer risk. Additionally, higher vitamin D levels correlated with improved survival rates and reduced recurrence, though some findings lacked statistical significance. Deficiencies were associated with higher rates of malnutrition and postoperative complications, reinforcing vitamin D's role in nutritional stability and surgical recovery. Conclusions: This systematic review highlights how common and significant vitamin D deficiency is among head and neck cancer (HNC) patients, exploring its possible role in cancer risk, prognosis, survival, treatment-related side effects, malnutrition, and post-surgical complications. The evidence suggests that while higher vitamin D levels are linked to better survival and fewer treatment-related issues, the benefits seem to level off beyond a certain point, indicating a more complex relationship. Additionally, vitamin D supplementation appears to help reduce chemoradiation side effects like mucositis, skin toxicity, dysphagia, and pain, ultimately improving patients' quality of life during treatment.",

      "abstract": "Chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) is a subtype of chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) characterized by bilateral nasal polyps, primarily affecting adults. It is often associated with hyposmia and asthma and driven by persistent Th2 inflammation, particularly in Caucasian patients. The disease is recurrent and significantly impacts quality of life, yet its pathophysiology remains poorly understood. Management includes intranasal steroids, short courses of systemic corticosteroids, surgery for refractory cases, and biologics. However, despite these treatment options, disease control remains challenging. Low vitamin D levels have been associated with worse clinical outcomes, while supplementation studies show promise in improving symptoms in deficient patients. Emerging research suggests that vitamin D modulates immunity, fibroblast activity, and epithelial integrity, potentially contributing to CRSwNP pathogenesis, though the exact mechanisms remain unclear. This review synthesizes current research on vitamin D's role in systemic and local inflammation in CRSwNP. By highlighting its potential therapeutic implications, this work aims to guide future research and inform clinical practice. Additionally, it may serve as a foundation for understanding the broader impact of vitamin D deficiency in sinonasal diseases and other atopic conditions."

This study investigates the relationship between vitamin D deficiency and the severity of purulent oropharyngeal infections, considering the need for surgical interventions and the duration of hospitalization. Materials and Methods: This retrospective study included patients diagnosed with peritonsillar phlegmons, laterocervical abscesses, and peritonsillar abscesses. Patients were categorized based on their vitamin D levels: deficiency (<30 ng/mL) and optimal levels (≥30 ng/mL). The clinical parameters, length of hospitalization, and type of treatment were analyzed. Statistical analyses included Student's t-test, the chi-square test, and ANOVA to assess differences between groups. Results: Patients with vitamin D (25(OH)D3) deficiency had a significantly longer hospital stay (8.50 days vs. 3.24 days, p = 0.001) and required more frequent surgical interventions (55.6% vs. 27.8%, p = 0.002) compared to those with optimal vitamin D levels. A trend toward more complex treatment regimens was also observed, although this relationship was not statistically significant (p > 0.05). Conclusions: These findings suggest that vitamin D (25(OH)D3) deficiency may contribute to a more severe course of oropharyngeal infections, increasing the need for invasive treatments and prolonging hospitalization. This highlights the importance of monitoring vitamin D (25(OH)D3) levels and the potential benefits of supplementation in preventing and managing severe upper respiratory tract infections."

The objective of this study was to investigate the influences of aerobic training (AT) and vitamin D (Vit D) supplementation on the lipid profile and spexin levels in a model of rats with type 2 diabetes (T2D). METHODS: A total of 56 male Wistar rats were divided into two groups: SHAM (non-diabetic control; n = 8) and diabetic (n = 48). The diabetic rats were further divided into six groups: AT with high doses of vitamin D (D + AT + HD; 10,000 IU/kg/week), AT with moderate doses of vitamin D (D + AT + MD; 5,000 IU/kg/week), high doses of vitamin D (D + HD; 10,000 IU/kg/week), moderate doses of vitamin D (D + MD; 5,000 IU/kg/week), AT receiving vehicle (sesame oil; D + AT + oil), and control (oil-receiving; D + C). To induce type 2 diabetes, rats were first fed a high-fat diet (HFD) for 2 weeks to induce obesity, followed by an intraperitoneal injection of 110 mg/kg nicotinamide and 55 mg/kg streptozotocin (STZ) dissolved in 0.1 M citrate buffer (pH 4.5). Blood samples were collected 48 h after the last training session under anesthesia for measuring spexin levels, and lipid profile parameters. Statistical analyses were performed using the paired t-test, one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), and Tukey post hoc test. RESULTS: Compared to the SHAM rats, there were significant increases in body weight, BMI, FI, and WC in the diabetic rats (p < 0.001). Also, there was a significant decrease in body weight, BMI, FI, and WC of the diabetic groups who received interventions, especially in D + AT + HD (body weight: -11.07%, BMI: -10.25%, FI: -19.16%, WC: -16.54%). The lipid profiles were significantly improved, with the lowest total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels and the highest high-density lipoprotein (HDL) levels being found in the D + AT + HD group compared with the D + C group (p < 0.05). Moreover, the D + AT + HD group had elevated spexin levels compared with the other diabetic groups, which may play a metabolic role. CONCLUSION: AT and Vit D supplementation effectively normalized serum lipids and increased spexin levels in T2D rats. These findings suggest that AT and Vit D supplementation may serve as potential therapeutic strategies for managing T2D and its associated complications. Further studies are needed to elucidate the underlying mechanisms and to evaluate the long-term effects of these interventions in humans."

The present study aimed to compare the clinical efficacy and safety of intralesional tuberculin purified protein derivative (PPD) and Vitamin D3 therapy in recurrent and recalcitrant extra-genital cutaneous warts. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This study was conducted as a prospective, randomized, comparative, and single-blind study. A total of 104 patients were randomly distributed into two treatment groups: Group A (Tuberculin PPD, n = 53) and Group B (Vitamin D3, n = 51). Each patient in Group A received an intralesional injection of 0.1 mL tuberculin PPD (5 Tuberculin Units), while each patient in Group B received an intralesional injection of 0.2 mL Vitamin D3 (Cholecalciferol containing 120,000 IU). The injections were given at the initial visit (week 0) and after every 2 weeks for a maximum of four sessions (weeks 2, 4, and 6). The largest wart was selected for intralesional therapy. The categorization of clinical response was done based on the percent reduction in the size of warts into complete (appearance of normal skin), marked (>50% reduction), moderate (<50% reduction), and inadequate (no change in warts) responses. Adverse effects (if any) were recorded during each patient visit. The final response was evaluated at 6 months follow-up from the last treatment session. RESULTS: Regarding the response of patients to tuberculin PPD therapy, out of a total of 53 patients, 40 (75.5%) showed a complete response. Regarding the response of patients to Vitamin D3 therapy, out of a total of 51 patients, 36 (70.6%) showed a complete response. However, the difference in the response to the treatment between the two groups was statistically insignificant (P = 0.402). CONCLUSION: Both intralesional tuberculin PPD and Vitamin D3 are effective and safe in the treatment of all recurrent and recalcitrant extra-genital cutaneous warts."

VDDR2A rickets are usually resistant to native or active vitamin D treatment because of impaired active calcium absorption against the calcium concentration gradient, which is a ligand-dependent VDR action in the small intestine. Alopecia due to an impaired skin follicular cycle is occasionally observed in patients with VDDR2A. Among the pathogenic VDR variants, most in the DNA-binding domain and some in the ligand-binding domain, which affect the dimerization of VDR with the retinoic X receptor, are associated with alopecia. Herein, we report a case of VDDR2A caused by compound heterozygous pathogenic variants of the DNA-binding domain of VDR. Active vitamin D treatment did not ameliorate genu varum, rachitic changes in the roentgenogram, or abnormal laboratory findings. However, oral administration of calcium lactate dramatically improved these findings. The patient also experienced hair loss at two months of age and multiple papules on the skin at two yr of age, which did not improve with vitamin D or calcium supplementation. We also report the histopathological findings of skin papules in this patient."

A lack of vitamin D (Vit. D) is linked to different pregnancy problems, including impaired placental development. Vitamin D has been shown to enhance fetal growth and lower the incidence of PE. AIM OF THE WORK: To better understand the pathophysiological mechanisms behind the PE disease and the therapeutic approaches used to manage it, this study examines the role of Vit. D in placental ischemia and its regulatory effects in Nitro L-arginine Methyl Ester (L-NAME) animal model of PE. METHODS: Fifty female rats in the estrus stage were mated with 30 male rats. Thirty female rats were pregnant and divided into three equal groups: control, Preeclampsia group (PE); using L-NAME for induction of PE, and Vit. D group from 7th day then induction by L-NAME at 10th day till end of pregnancy. Mean arterial Bp, proteinuria, oxidative stress markers, histological structure and immunohistochemical expression of Ki67 and VEGF, Morphometric study, and transmission electron microscopy(TEM) were assessed. The results of the current study suggested that, Vit. D supplementation could lower blood pressure, reduce oxidative stress, and restore angiogenic balance through vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and Ki67. CONCLUSION: For the first time, we conclude that vitamin D supplementation may not only have direct effects on blood pressure regulation and angiogenic hemostasis but also recover placental function, actually contributing to the prevention or management of PE."

Recent studies suggest a potential link between vitamin D and its metabolites in enhancing the effectiveness of H. pylori eradication therapies through their bactericidal properties. AIM: To investigate the correlation between the vitamin D levels and their influence on clinical management and treatment results of children patients, tested for H. pylori. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study was conducted on a cohort of 128 paediatric patients. They were divided into 2 groups, depending on whether positive (first group - A) or negative (second group - B) for H. pylori. To determine vitamin D levels, venous blood was taken from all participants from both groups. Group 1 included patients whose indexes were up to 10 ng/ml; Group 2 included patients whose indexes were from 10 ng/ml to 20 ng/ml; Group 3 levels were from 20 ng/ml to 30 ng/ml; and Group 4 indexes were over 30 ng/ml. The efficiency of the H. pylori eradication scheme in participants of these groups was evaluated. RESULTS: The mean values in Group A were higher than those in Group B: 17.1 and 14.9, respectively, p-value 0.03. Helicobacter pylori prevalence was higher in participants with vitamin D levels below 30 ng/ml. As a result of the study, it was established that vitamin D levels below 30 ng/ml in blood serum could be a predisposing factor in the spread of H. pylori in paediatric patients. At the same time, different levels of deficiency below 30 ng/ml did not affect the frequency of H. pylori infection. CONCLUSIONS: The obtained data can be used in developing guidelines for clinical management of children patients who are primarily diagnosed with H. pylori and require eradication therapy."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Postoperative hypocalcemia is a common complication following total thyroidectomy, leading to extended hospital stays, decreased patient quality of life, and increased healthcare costs. Recent research has explored the role of preoperative vitamin D deficiency in exacerbating this risk due to its impact on calcium homeostasis. METHODS: A prospective study was conducted at a tertiary care hospital in Southern India from March 2023 to May 2024. Patients undergoing total thyroidectomy were categorized into three groups based on their preoperative vitamin D status: Group A (Vitamin D sufficient), Group B (Vitamin D deficient with preoperative supplementation), and Group C (Vitamin D deficient without supplementation). Serum calcium levels were monitored preoperatively and postoperatively to assess for hypocalcemia. RESULTS: A total of 84 patients were included: Group A (n=38), Group B (n=23), and Group C (n=23). Preoperative vitamin D levels were significantly lower in Groups B and C compared to Group A. The incidence of postoperative hypocalcemia was highest in Group C (n=23; 56.5%), followed by Group A (n=38; 42.1%) and Group B (n=23; 34.8%), although differences were not statistically significant (p=0.315). However, clinical hypocalcemia was significantly higher in Group C (n=23; 56.5%) compared to Group A (n=38; 23.7%) and Group B (n=23; 21.7%) (p=0.013). CONCLUSION: Preoperative vitamin D deficiency is associated with an increased risk of postoperative hypocalcemia following total thyroidectomy. Preoperative supplementation in vitamin D-deficient patients may mitigate this risk, suggesting a potential benefit in routine assessment and correction of vitamin D status before surgery to optimize patient outcomes."

      "abstract": "PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Statin medications play a pivotal role in the primary and secondary prevention and management of cardiovascular disease due to their potent lipid-lowering and anti-inflammatory effects. Nevertheless, the clinical application of statins is often hampered by statin-associated muscle symptoms (SAMS), which deter patient adherence and treatment efficacy considerably. SAMS currently affects 10-20% of statin users, thus understanding potential mitigation strategies is crucial. This review focuses on the role of vitamin D in mitigating SAMS, given the growing interest in vitamin D deficiency as a potentially modifiable risk factor. RECENT FINDINGS: Despite observational suggestions linking vitamin D deficiency to heightened SAMS risk, recent studies have yielded conflicting results on the role of vitamin D supplementation in preventing SAMS. Some studies report an improvement in statin tolerance following vitamin D repletion. However, recent large-scale clinical trials, particularly the Vitamin D and Omega-3 trial (VITAL) report no significant benefit of vitamin D supplementation in preventing SAMS or reducing statin discontinuation rates, regardless of baseline vitamin D levels. SUMMARY: Observational data provides evidence for the use of vitamin D supplementation in SAMS management, however conflicting evidence in recent clinical trials do not support its routine use for preventing or treating SAMS. To explore alternative strategies in improving statin tolerance and adherence, this discourse aims to elucidate the current understanding the complex mechanisms underlying SAMS, the influence of serum vitamin D levels, and the implications for clinical management."

Even more, there is no consensus specific to vitamin D supplementation for the Indian population, and there are inconsistencies in the cut-off values for deficiency, severe deficiency, and insufficiency across various guidelines, which this evidence-based consensus seeks to resolve, thus guiding healthcare professionals in identifying, preventing, and managing vitamin D deficiency. An expert group of 41 endocrinologists from across India developed the consensus using the DELPHI method, achieving over 90% agreement on all recommendations. The consensus defines vitamin D deficiency, severe deficiency, and insufficiency, recommending supplementation strategies to maintain physiological 25(OH) D levels of 40-60 ng/mL (100-150 nmol/L). Tailored treatment regimens for neonates, infants, children, adolescents, adults, the elderly, pregnant and lactating women, and individuals with co-morbid conditions are provided to ensure optimal health for all age groups in India."

This retrospective cross-sectional study was performed on children receiving orthodontic treatment. Patients who had already undergone orthodontic treatment previously, those with syndromes, congenital anomalies, craniofacial deformities, and those with a previous history of dental trauma and bilateral agenesis/missing tooth/teeth were excluded. Panoramic radiographs were used for dental age evaluation according to the method proposed by Demirjian, Goldstein, and Tanner (1976). A delta [dental age minus chronological age (DA-CA)] was calculated to determine whether the patient's dental age was normal, delayed (negative values), or advanced (positive values). DNA isolated from buccal cells was used for genotyping genetic polymorphisms in PTH (rs694, rs307247, and rs6256), VDR (rs7975232), CYP27B1 (rs464653), and CYP24A1 (rs927650). A statistical analysis was performed and p<0.05 indicated statistical difference. A total of 79 orthodontic patients were included (44 (55.70%) girls and 35 (44.30%) boys). Demirjian, Goldstein, and Tanner's method (1976) overestimated the age of patients by 0.75 years. None of the genetic polymorphisms were associated with dental age (p>0.05). In conclusion, there is no association between genetic polymorphisms in PTH and genes involved in vitamin D synthesis and dental maturity.",

METHODS: In this ancillary study of the Diabetes Prevention with active Vitamin D trial, we examined clinical and experimental aspects to investigate the effects and mechanisms of eldecalcitol, an active form of vitamin D, in preventing sarcopenia. We examined changes in molecules involved in muscle synthesis and degradation pathways in muscle samples from 32 participants before and after 1 year of eldecalcitol or placebo treatment. The protein levels of molecules involved in muscle synthesis and degradation pathways were examined using western blotting. Additionally, the skeletal muscle and body fat volumes were measured using bioelectrical impedance analysis with a body composition analyzer. RESULTS: We found that eldecalcitol treatment for 1 year resulted in higher phosphorylation levels of mTOR and FOXO1 signaling pathways, which are associated with increased muscle mass and strength than those with placebo treatment. Body composition measurements at 1 year showed that the eldecalcitol group had significantly higher skeletal muscle mass (1.9 % vs. -3.4 %, p = 3.26E-9) and muscle strength (4.1 % vs. -0.7 %, p = 2.57E-17), and lower fat mass (-3.2 % vs. 1.8 %, p = 1.73E-12) than those in the placebo group. CONCLUSION: This study suggested that the active form of vitamin D regulates the protein synthesis and degradation pathways in human skeletal muscle and may help prevent sarcopenia.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Accumulating research has implicated that vitamin D (VD) may be important in the pathogenesis of Crohn's disease (CD), while the platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) is emerging as a biomarker in immune disorders. However, the synergistic effect of VD and PLR on treatment escalation in newly diagnosed CD patients remains unclear. Therefore, this study aims to assess the interaction between PLR and VD on the subsequent use of infliximab and/or immunosuppressants in patients with CD. METHODS: Newly diagnosed CD patients were selected from the Sir Run Run Shaw Hospital Inflammatory Bowel Disease Biobank (SRRSH-IBC). COX proportional hazards models were employed to assess the association between VD, PLR, and treatment escalation among CD patients. RESULTS: Among 108 newly diagnosed CD adult patients, vitamin D deficiency (VDD) was prevalent (78.7%). Compared to CD patients without VDD, those with VDD exhibited a higher risk of treatment escalation, i.e., using infliximab and/or immunosuppressants (HR = 3.22, 95% CI = 1.24-8.35, P = 0.016). There is a clear trend of decreasing risk of treatment escalation as VD levels elevating (HR = 0.26, 95% CI = 0.09-0.76, P for trend = 0.014). The stratified analysis revealed a noteworthy interaction between PLR and VD levels concerning treatment escalation. Baseline VDD amplified the risk of treatment escalation among patients with elevated PLR (HR = 4.17, 95% CI = 1.51-11.53, Pinteraction = 0.031). Similar trends were observed when VD levels were stratified into quartiles (highest quartile vs. lowest quartile: HR = 0.18, 95% CI = 0.05-0.62, P for trend = 0.014). CONCLUSION: This study underscores a significant interplay between VD levels and PLR in influencing treatment outcomes in CD. VDD exacerbates the risk of treatment escalation primarily in individuals with heightened PLR levels, highlighting the combined impact of vitamin D status and inflammation on disease progression of CD.",

METHODS: Despite the growing interest in vitamin D research, there is still uncertainty regarding clear recommendations for each high-risk category of premature infants concerning the optimal dosage, optimal product, and timing for initiating vitamin D supplementation to prevent VDD. RESULTS: An analysis of the literature suggests that early intervention for the optimal enteral supplementation of vitamin D is not only successful in achieving higher 25-hydroxi-vitamin D (25(OH)D) at one month but is also linked with improved outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: The traditional concepts and current recommendations for assessing vitamin D status and optimal supplementation need to be revised. Since parenteral nutrition, fortified mothers' own milk, and special formula for preterm infants cannot provide adequate vitamin D levels, initiating oral supplementation soon after birth is essential to correct VDD in preterm infants."

      "abstract": "Vitamin D was discovered as the cure for nutritional rickets, a disease of bone growth arising from inadequate intestinal calcium absorption, and for much of the 20th century, it was studied for its critical role in calcium homeostasis. However, we now recognize that the vitamin D receptor and vitamin D metabolic enzymes are expressed in numerous tissues unrelated to calcium homeostasis. Notably, vitamin D signaling can induce cellular differentiation and cell cycle arrest. Moreover, the vitamin D receptor and the enzyme CYP27B1, which produces the hormonal form of vitamin D, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25D), are expressed throughout the immune system. In addition, CYP27B1 expression in immune cells is regulated by physiological inputs independent of those controlling its expression in calcium homeostatic tissues. These observations have driven the development of 1,25D-like secosteroidal analogs and nonsecosteroidal analogs to separate the effects of vitamin D on cell differentiation and function from its calcemic activities. Notably, some of these analogs have had considerable success in the clinic in the treatment of inflammatory and immune-related disorders. In this review, we described in detail the mechanisms of vitamin D signaling and the physiological signals controlling 1,25D synthesis and catabolism, with a focus on the immune system. We also surveyed the effects of 1,25D and its analogs on the regulation of immune system function and their implications for human immune-related disorders. Finally, we described the potential of vitamin D analogs as anticancer therapeutics, in particular, their use as adjuncts to cancer immunotherapy. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Vitamin D signaling is active in both the innate and adaptive arms of the immune system. Numerous vitamin D analogs, developed primarily to minimize the dose-limiting hypercalcemia of the active form of vitamin D, have been used widely in preclinical and clinical studies of immune system regulation. This review presents a description of the mechanisms of action of vitamin D signaling, an overview of analog development, and an in-depth discussion of the immunoregulatory roles of vitamin D analogs.",

      "abstract": "Breast cancer is one of the leading reasons of mortality due to cancer globally. Estrogen receptor-positive (ER +) breast cancer being a significant subtype. The therapeutic potential of Vitamin D3 in cancer treatment has gained attention due to its ability to modulate key molecular targets and signaling pathways. This study investigates the anticancer mechanisms of Vitamin D3 in MCF-7 breast cancer cells using network pharmacology and omics technology approach. Utilizing protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks, we identified several critical protein targets involved in breast cancer progression, including ESR1, ESR2, PGR, IGF1R, and KDR. Pathway enrichment analyses highlighted Vitamin D3's impact on pivotal signaling pathways such as the PI3K/Akt pathway, estrogen receptor signaling, and apoptosis regulation. In vitro studies showed that Vitamin D3 significantly inhibited cell proliferation in MCF-7 cells. It also induced apoptosis and disrupted mitochondrial function. Flow cytometry analysis demonstrated a dose-dependent increase in apoptotic cell death and S-phase cell cycle arrest. Confocal imaging and mitochondrial membrane potential assays further supported the findings, indicating mitochondrial dysfunction and chromatin condensation. Additionally, gene expression analysis in breast invasive carcinoma tissues confirmed the relevance of ESR1 and PGR in hormone receptor-positive breast cancer. Histopathological studies on DMBA-induced mammary carcinoma revealed Vitamin D3's protective effects, reducing tumor malignancy severity through anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic actions. These findings provide strong evidence for Vitamin D3's potential as a multi-targeted therapeutic agent in breast cancer, suggesting further investigation into its clinical applications and combination strategies with existing therapies as an adjunct or alternative in the treatment."

Material/Methods: In a level 1 trauma centre, patients with fractures requiring surgical treatment after low-energy trauma were prospectively examined over a period of 12 months. Using radiographs of the thoracic and lumbar spine in two planes, previously unknown VFs were identified and categorised according to the classification for osteoporotic fractures (OFs) of the thoracolumbar spine. Results: A total of 106 patients with a mean age of 79.4 years participated in this study, and 112 previously unknown vertebral compression fractures were diagnosed in 57% (60/106) of the patients. In this group, lumbar vertebra 2 was the most frequently affected, and the majority of these VFs were classified as OF 2, which corresponds to an isolated endplate fracture with minimal involvement of the posterior wall. Furthermore, 26% (28/106) of the patients in the evaluation showed VFs at multiple levels. This study revealed no statistically significant difference in the prevalence of silent VFs between male and female patients (p = 0.055). Additionally, the analysis revealed that nearly 75% of patients exhibited vitamin D insufficiency. Conclusions: The high prevalence of silent VFs in elderly patients emphasises the necessity for systematic radiological investigations, irrespective of gender."

Overweight/obesity is associated with chronic inflammation, thereby contributing to adverse effects. Disturbingly, overweight and obesity are highly prevalent among pregnant women worldwide. Vitamin D (vitD) possess immunomodulatory effects and is believed to support healthy pregnancy. Endocrinological societies recommend empiric vitD supplementation in pregnancy but there is no consensus on the minimal supplementation dose METHODS: An adjacent study to GRAVIT-D (no. NCT04291313, ClinicalTrial.gov), a double-blinded randomized trial investigating the clinical benefits of increasing vitD supplementation in pregnancy from 400IU to 3600IU/day from gestational week 11-16 onwards. In a subgroup, (n = 156), multiplex ELISA targeting third-semester serum levels of IL-1β, IL-6, IL-10, TNFα, MCP-1, and IL-17A was performed. Inflammation signals were correlated with the vitD dose given, subsequently analysing the effect of vitD in relation to the pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI) within each treatment arm comparing the inflammatory response in WHO-defined BMI groups, < 25, 25-30 and > 30 kg/m2. MAIN RESULTS: High pre-pregnancy BMI was associated with increased IL6 and MCP1 in both the 400IU and the 3600 IU exposed group. IL1β levels increased with BMI if using a 400IU/day supplement. High dose vitD supplementation ameliorated BMI effects on IL1β. CONCLUSION AND PERSPECTIVES: Increased vitD supplementation during pregnancy may ameliorate some overweight/obesity-induced inflammatory activity. Further studies are needed to determine the vitD need in pregnancies complicated by obesity and overweight.",

Diagnosis is based on clinical observation and biochemical parameters. Treatment is pharmacological, however, if the skeletal deformities are severe, it is necessary a surgical correction. PRESENTATION OF CASES: We report two patients with hypophosphatemic rickets and severe varus knee. Both patients were surgically treated by bilateral femoral and tibial osteotomy, and stabilized with a uniplanar external fixator. No complications occurred in the post-operative period. The patients were clinically and radiographically checked thereafter over time. At last follow-up, 2 and 19 years after surgery, both patients were asymptomatic without recurrence of the deformity. DISCUSSION: In case of severe bone deformities caused by hypophosphatemic rickets, surgical approach is mandatory. Most authors agree that the ideal time to perform the operation is close to the end of bone maturity, to avoid the risk of recurrence of the deformities. However, in some young patients, with severe and progressive deformity, it is necessary to plan an early surgical correction in two or more stages, and multiple osteotomies should be planned. CONCLUSION: According to our results, we believe that surgical treatment should ideally be performed close to skeletal maturity, but in one of our cases with serious deformities of both lower limbs, an early surgical correction was necessary despite the young age."

      "abstract": "Background/aim: Frailty is increasingly recognized as a relevant prognostic factor in patients with cirrhosis, regardless of liver failure. Vitamin D deficiency is frequent in these patients and has been related to frailty and sarcopenia, but the impact of its supplementation on frailty in cirrhosis is unknown. The aim was to evaluate the effect of vitamin D supplementation on frailty in patients with decompensated cirrhosis and vitamin D deficiency or insufficiency. Methods: We included patients with cirrhosis who had vitamin D deficiency or insufficiency following their hospitalization for acute decompensation. Vitamin D was supplemented according to current recommendations, as were other micronutrients if necessary. Patients were followed for one year to evaluate changes at 6 and 12 months in frailty (Fried frailty index), health-related quality of life (SF-36, CLDQ) and mood (HADS). Body composition was assessed by DXA at baseline and at 12 months. Results: We included 39 patients, 27 of whom reached the 6-month follow-up. Serum vitamin D increased at 6 and 12 months (p < 0.001 compared to baseline). Fried frailty index improved at the 6-month visit (p = 0.004), and handgrip strength improved at 6 (p = 0.001) and 12 (p = 0.002) months, similarly in women and men. At 12 months, we observed an increase in body mass index, right arm lean mass and total fat mass. Conclusions: A multifactorial nutritional intervention, especially vitamin D supplementation after discharge in decompensated, vitamin D-deficient patients with cirrhosis, was associated with an improvement in frailty, muscular strength and lean muscle mass. However, the increase in fat mass strengthens the recommendation for diet, exercise and weight supervision.",

      "abstract": "Vitamin D (VD), an indispensable micronutrient renowned for its pivotal role in bone health, is increasingly recognized as a frontline therapy for bone-related disorders owing to its involvement in maintaining calcium/phosphorus levels. Beyond these benefits, VD exhibits a modulatory impact on redox imbalance, inflammation, and anti-apoptotic pathways implicated in brain-related disorders. Recent findings reveal a notable decrease in VD and its receptor expression in the cerebrospinal fluid of individuals with brain diseases, indicating a positive association between VD levels and normal brain function. Moreover, emerging reports underscore VD's potential in mitigating the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative diseases, including memory and motor impairments, mitochondrial dysfunction, and neuronal loss. Extensive in vitro and in vivo studies elucidate VD's multifaceted neuroprotective mechanisms, effectively mitigating neuronal damage and ATP deprivation, thus reducing mortality and morbidity. This review comprehensively examines VD's diverse attributes, encompassing antioxidative, anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic, and neurogenic effects. It provides contemporary insights into VD's efficacious actions at appropriate doses and exposures across diverse neurological experimental models. Furthermore, the clinical relevance of VD in treating patients with neurological diseases is explored. Overall, this review contributes to the exploration of potential neuroprotective agents and holds promise for improving human health outcomes in the future."

      "abstract": "Lymphomas represent a heterogeneous group of blood tumors, generally divided into non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) (90% of all lymphomas) and Hodgkin lymphoma (HL). High-grade NHL can rapidly progress so that new strategies and potentially therapeutical options are needed. Recently, it was shown that Vitamin D (VitD) inhibits the growth of cancer cells, controls their invasion and metastasis, and strengthens the antitumor activity of various types of chemotherapeutic anticancer agents. Therefore, we reviewed the recent literature about the influence of VitD and its analogues (VDAs) on the treatment and the prognosis of B-cell lymphomas. As to the in vitro studies in different cell lines, VitD3 and VDAs enhanced the anti-proliferative efficacy of various chemotherapeutics and increased the expression of VitD receptor. In in vivo studies, blood levels of VitD were considered: higher values of plasma bioavailable VitD were correlated with better progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS), while an unfavorable PFS and OS were observed in VitD deficient groups. No clinical trial was made on the analogs, thus confirming the absence of in vivo positive role of these synthetic drugs. In conclusion, higher levels of circulating VitD are related to improved OS, reduced cancer-specific mortality, and better disease-free survival. VitD and analogs showed also positive effects in in vitro studies, while only VitD was able to improve clinical parameters. Furthermore, a complex approach with plant-based diet, adequate levels for motor exercise, and/or eventual VitD supplementation could be a valuable strategy to challenge lymphomas.",

Vitamin D inhibits keloid fibroblast proliferation by reducing TGF-β-induced extracellular matrix formation, boosting matrix metalloproteinase activity, and reducing inflammation. AIM: To study the effect of intralesional and systemic Vitamin D3 injection on hypertrophic scars and keloids and whether vitamin D3 deficiency increases scarring. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This study included 30 hypertrophic scars and keloid patients divided into groups depending on serum vitamin D levels. Every patient was tested for vitamin D using ELISA. Group I: patients with vitamin D deficiency or insufficiency received a systemic injection of vitamin D (cholecalciferol 200 000 I.U.) once monthly for 3 months with a calcium oral supplement and intralesional vitamin D injections on hypertrophic scars and keloids. Group II: patients with sufficient vitamin D received only intralesional vitamin D injections. RESULTS: Vitamin D deficiency did not affect scar formation or severity (total Vancouver scar scale before assessment) with a p value > 0.05. All instances showed a substantial drop in vascularity, pliability, and total Vancouver scale score (p value < 0.05) following intervention, but no change in scar pigmentation or height. Scar assessment following intervention did not significantly differ between research groups (p > 0.05). CONCLUSION: Injection of vitamin on hypertrophic scars and keloids enhances vascularity and pliability in patients with sufficient serum vitamin D levels and those with deficient or insufficient serum vitamin D levels after improving them by systemic injection of vitamin D without any effect on height and pigmentation of scars.

      "abstract": "Besides its classical skeletal function, vitamin D plays a critical role in both skeletal muscle and the immune system. Interleukin-15 (IL-15), which is highly expressed, and secreted complexed with its receptor, IL-15Rα, by skeletal muscle, stimulates the development of immune cells and affects myogenesis and muscle mass. However, little is known about possible regulators of this myokine. To test whether vitamin D could be a regulator of muscle IL-15 and IL-15Rα expression, C2C12 myotubes were treated with vitamin D3 metabolites and analysis were performed in gastrocnemius muscles of rats treated with a single intraperitoneal dose of 1,25(OH)2D3. The role of VDR was investigated by siRNA technique in C2C12 myotubes and in gastrocnemius muscles of vitamin D receptor knockout (Vdr-KO) mice. Treatment of C2C12 myotubes with 1,25(OH)2D3 or 25(OH)D3 increased Il-15 gene expression in a dose-dependent manner and 1,25(OH)2D3 also moderately increased the relative Il-15 protein amount. Rats treated with a single dose of 1,25(OH)2D3 demonstrated a higher mRNA abundance of muscle Il-15 than controls. The 1,25(OH)2D3 effect on Il-15 was considerably weaker in C2C12 myotubes treated with Vdr-specific siRNA. Vdr-KO mice showed significantly lower muscle Il-15 mRNA than WT mice. Il-15Ra mRNA and Il-15/Il-15Rα protein abundance were unaffected by 1,25(OH)2D3-treatment or VDR functionality, and Cyp27b1 activity is not required for 25(OH)D3-mediated Il-15 gene expression. The results provide evidence for a regulatory role of hydroxyvitamin D3 metabolites on the Il-15 synthesis in skeletal muscle cells, which is largely mediated by the VDR."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Oxidative stress and neuroinflammation are crucial factors in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD). Vitamin D (Vit D) and canagliflozin (CAN) are known to have anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. Together, they target key molecular pathways involved in PD, including oxidative stress and neuroinflammation, specifically, the small GTPase protein (RAC1)/nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB)/nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) signaling, which regulates brain's oxidative stress and inflammation. This study investigates the effects of Vit D and CAN alone and in combination in a rat model of PD. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty male Wistar rats were assigned to five groups (n = 10), including control, rotenone (ROT), Vit D + ROT, CAN + ROT, and Vit D + CAN + ROT. We assessed weight changes, brain weight, neurobehavioral functions, biochemical markers, and immunohistopathology of brain tissues. RESULTS: The results showed that Vit D treatment was more effective than CAN in alleviating PD symptoms, with the combination of Vit D and CAN offering the best therapeutic outcome. This combination therapy significantly improved serum Vit D, striatal dopamine (DA) levels, antioxidant status (reduced glutathione (GSH) and catalase (CAT), reduced oxidative stress (malondialdehyde (MDA)), and ameliorated inflammation (tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin 6 (IL-6), and interleukin 10 (IL-10)). Additionally, the combination therapy modulated the expression of RAC1, NF-κB, Nrf2, vitamin D receptors (VDR), and vitamin D-binding protein (DBP) and immunoexpression of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), and α-synuclein (α-SYN). CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that Vit D and CAN synergistically modulate the RAC1/NF-κB/Nrf2 pathway, leading to improved neuroprotection in PD."

      "abstract": "As the global population ages, neurodegenerative diseases, particularly Alzheimer's disease (AD), have become a major public health concern. AD is the most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder, accounting for 60-80% of cases, and is characterized by progressive cognitive and memory decline due to neuronal loss. Current pharmacological treatments primarily offer symptomatic relief rather than a cure. Recent research has highlighted the role of vitamin D in neuroprotection, owing to its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and neuroprotective properties, as well as its ability to maintain blood-brain barrier integrity and regulate amyloid-beta (Aβ) clearance. Another emerging noninvasive therapeutic approach is Low-Level Laser Therapy (LLLT), a form of photobiomodulation (PBM) that has been shown to enhance neuronal function, reduce oxidative stress, inflammation, and Aβ deposition, and potentially increase vitamin D levels. This review examines the interplay between LLLT, vitamin D, and oxidative stress in AD pathophysiology. Findings suggest that LLLT can stimulate mitochondrial function, enhance synaptic plasticity, and improve cognitive performance in preclinical and clinical studies. Furthermore, LLLT has been reported to modulate immune responses, promote neurogenesis, and facilitate vitamin D synthesis by activating cytochrome c oxidase (CCO), which plays a crucial role in mitochondrial energy production. However, while promising, further in vivo and clinical trials are required to optimize treatment protocols and establish standardized guidelines for LLLT application, particularly in enhancing vitamin D levels, in AD patients.

      "abstract": "AIM: Moderate to severe asthma patients with sufficient and insufficient vitamin D serum level, respectively, were assessed with quality of life questionnaires before and after treatment with vitamin D added to their standard asthma treatment. METHODS: Patients with moderate to severe asthma have been divided into two groups based on a serum level of vitamin D as sufficient or insufficient level of vitamin D, respectively. During 12 months, a total of 120 patients with sufficient level of vitamin D as well as 120 patients with insufficient level were given treatment with 2000 IU vitamin D for a three-month period. Quality of life of all patients was assessed by Asthma Control Test (ACT), Asthma Quality of Life (AQOL) and the physician's assessment expressed through the Global Evaluation of Treatment Effectiveness (GETE), which were performed before and after the treatment with Vitamin D. RESULTS: Values of ACT and AQOL were higher after the treatment with vitamin D in both groups of patients. Values of GETE were lower after the treatment with vitamin D in both groups. All assessed components, psychological, physical, as well as the subjective feeling of control of the disease assessed by treating physicians, showed improvement after treatment. CONCLUSION: Adding vitamin D in the treatment regimen of moderate to severe asthma patients improves quality of life and general asthma treatment effectiveness."

      "abstract": "This study explored the interaction effects of dietary Vitamin A (VA) and Vitamin D3 (VD3) on growth performance, jejunal function, and tibia development in goslings, aiming to identify any synergistic outcomes that may reshape nutritional strategies for geese production. A total of 540 one-day-old male Jiangnan White goslings with similar body weight (82 ± 5 g) were randomly assigned into 9 treatments with five replicate pens per treatment and 12 birds per pen. The bird trial employed a 3 × 3, two-factorial treatment with three levels of VA (5000, 7000, and 9000 IU/kg) and three levels of VD3 (1000, 1500, and 2000 IU/kg) from one to 28 days of age. Main effects analysis indicated that birds fed 7000 IU/kg VA exhibited the highest ADG, BW, jejunal maltase activity and IL-10 content (P < 0.05), while 9000 IU/kg VA had the highest SOD activity and content of IL-6 and TNF-α in jejunal mucosa (P < 0.05). Both 7000 IU/kg or 9000 IU/kg VA increased the jejunal IL-1β content, relative expression of tight junction protein 1 (TJP1) mRNA, tibia defatted weight and ash weight (P < 0.05). Birds fed 2000 IU/kg VD3 exhibited the highest ADFI, while both 1500 or 2000 IU/kg VD3 increased jejunal maltase activity, and tibia ash content (P < 0.05). An interaction between VA and VD3 on ADFI, F/G, jejunal maltase activity, mucosal immune factors (IL-1β, IL-6, IL-10, TNF-α), tibia ash content, and bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2) expression. A simple effects analysis revealed that at a 5000 IU/kg VA, adding 1000 IU/kg VD3 decreased IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α (P < 0.05). At a 7000 IU/kg VA, adding 1500 or 2000 IU/kg VD3 decreased TNF-α, and increased jejunal maltase activity(P < 0.05). At a 9000 IU/kg VA, adding 1000 IU/kg VD3 decreased ADFI, F/G, jejunal maltase activity, tibia ash, and BMP-2, while IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α increased (P < 0.05). At a 9000 IU/kg VA, adding 2000 IU/kg VD3 increased IL-10 (P < 0.05). At a 1000 IU/kg VD3, adding 5000 IU/kg VA increased F/G, jejunal maltase activity and IL-10, while decreased IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α (P < 0.05), and adding 9000 IU/kg VA decreased tibia ash and BMP-2 (P < 0.05). At 1500 or 2000 IU/kg VD3, adding 7000 IU/kg VA increased jejunal maltase activity, IL-10 (P < 0.05). At a 2000 IU/kg VD3, adding 9000 IU/kg VA increased IL-6, and TNF-α (P < 0.05). In summary, a dietary level of 7000 IU/kg of VA and 2000 IU/kg of VD3 can be a balanced combination to optimize feed intake and conversion, jejunal function, and tibia mineralization, consequently enhancing growth performance in goslings."

      "abstract": "Preterm infants born to mothers with preeclampsia, a disease of vascular dysfunction, are at increased risk for bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Endothelial cells are critical in both maintaining proper vascular function and coordinating lung development. Understanding the mechanisms contributing to BPD in the setting of preeclampsia and how preeclampsia impacts pulmonary endothelial cells (PECs) in the newborn lung are required to decrease the burden of BPD. Vitamin D has been shown to improve lung angiogenesis and lung development in inflammatory models of BPD, but its therapeutic potential in the setting of preeclampsia is unknown. We hypothesized that intraamniotic (IA) treatment with the biologically active form of vitamin D, 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D [1,25(OH)2D], will preserve lung growth in an experimental model of BPD induced by antenatal exposure to soluble vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-1 [sFlt-1 (soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase 1)]. Fetal rats were exposed to saline (control), sFlt-1 alone, 1,25(OH)2D alone, or simultaneous sFlt-1 + 1,25(OH)2D via IA injection during the late canalicular stage of lung development and delivered 2 days later. IA treatment with 1,25(OH)2D in sFlt-1-exposed pups improved lung alveolar and vascular growth and function at 14 days of life. PECs orchestrate alveolar development, and we demonstrate that IA sFlt-1 exposure alone decreased in vitro growth and tube formation of PECs isolated from newborn pups and that PECs from pups coexposed to IA sFlt-1 and 1,25(OH)2D demonstrated increased growth and tube formation. We conclude that IA 1,25(OH)2D treatment improves distal lung development during sFlt-1 exposure through preservation of angiogenesis in the developing lung.NEW & NOTEWORTHY This study highlights that experimental BPD induced by intraamniotic sFlt-1 is associated with impaired growth in postnatal pulmonary endothelial cells. We demonstrate that 1,25(OH)2D may be a therapeutic option to improve lung development through enhancement of VEGF signaling and preservation of early pulmonary endothelial growth in the newborn rat lung.",

      "abstract": "Vitamin D receptor (VDR) agonists play a pivotal role in modulating immune responses and promoting melanocyte survival, making them potential candidates for vitiligo treatment. The VDR gene is integral to mediating the effects of vitamin D in the immune system, and disruptions in its structure due to missense mutations may significantly contribute to the pathogenesis of vitiligo. Missense single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) can alter the amino acid sequence of the VDR protein, potentially affecting its ligand-binding affinity and downstream signaling. Investigating these missense SNPs provides critical insights into the genetic underpinnings of vitiligo and may help identify biomarkers for early detection and precision-targeted therapies. This study explored the therapeutic potential of vitamin D analogs in vitiligo management, with a particular focus on their binding interactions and molecular efficacy. Using molecular docking and virtual screening, 24 vitamin D analogs were evaluated. Calcipotriol exhibited the highest binding affinity (-11.4 kcal/mol) and unique interactions with key residues in the VDR ligand-binding domain. Additionally, an analysis of structural variations stemming from missense mutations in the VDR gene highlighted potential impacts on receptor-ligand interactions, further emphasizing the importance of genetic factors in treatment response. These findings underscore the potential of calcipotriol to promote melanogenesis and modulate pigmentation in vitiligo. A comparative analysis identified structural variations influencing the efficacy of other analogs, such as calcitriol and tacalcitol. Although the in silico methods provided valuable insights, the study acknowledges the limitations of excluding dynamic cellular environments and emphasizes the need for experimental validation. Overall, this study enhances our understanding of VDR-targeted therapies, and calcipotriol is a promising candidate for further development in the management of vitiligo."

      "abstract": "The importance of maintaining adequate levels of vitamin D for optimal male sexual health is highlighted by recent evidence suggesting a link between vitamin D insufficiency and erectile dysfunction (ED). This review examines current research that indicates an association between decreased serum concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D), specifically levels below 20 ng/mL, and a higher prevalence of ED, including severe cases. Studies have shown a significant correlation between a decrease of 10 ng/mL in 25(OH)D levels and a 12% increase in the prevalence of ED. The active form of vitamin D, calcitriol, facilitates the synthesis of nitric oxide, a potent vasodilator crucial for penile erection. Additionally, vitamin D supplementation has been shown to improve erectile function by enhancing endothelial vasodilation and arterial blood flow. It is essential to maintain serum 25(OH)D levels within the recommended range of 20 to 50 ng/mL, given the connection between vascular disorders and ED. A comprehensive approach, including dietary changes, consistent physical activity, and lifestyle modifications, is necessary to prevent ED. While vitamin D deficiency may contribute to ED, it is crucial to recognize that ED is multifactorial and should be addressed by considering all underlying causes. Individuals consistently experiencing symptoms of ED are advised to consult healthcare professionals for appropriate therapeutic interventions. This review emphasizes the importance of considering serum vitamin D levels when assessing male sexual health and calls for further research to clarify the role of vitamin D in the etiology and treatment of ED."

We found differences in 25-hydroxyvitamin D and bone biomarkers between men and women during the year after hip fracture, underscoring the importance of vitamin D assessment in older men and pharmaceutical treatment to reduce bone resorption after hip fracture. PURPOSE: Less is known about recovery from hip fracture in men compared to women. We examined differences between men and women in 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) and bone turnover markers, and associations with bone mineral density (BMD) and physical function, during the year after a hip fracture. METHODS: Community-dwelling, ambulatory adults aged 65 years and over (157 men and 154 women) enrolled in the Baltimore Hip Studies 7th cohort were included. We analyzed 25OHD, C-terminal telopeptide (β-CTX-I), procollagen type I N-terminal propeptide (PINP), PTH, and femoral neck BMD at baseline, 2, 6, and 12 months after hip fracture, and short physical performance battery (SPPB) at 2, 6, and 12 months. RESULTS: During admission for hip fracture, median 25OHD levels were 15.2 ng/mL (IQR 10.0) in men compared with 23.9 ng/mL (IQR 13.4) in women and remained lower in men at 2, 6, and 12 months (all p < 0.001). β-CTX-I was higher in men on admission, and at 2 and 6 months (all p < 0.05), and PINP was higher in men at 6 months (p = 0.04), with no significant differences between men and women in PTH. Higher 25OHD and PINP concentrations in women only and lower β-CTX-I and PTH concentrations in both sexes were associated with greater BMD. Higher 25OHD concentrations were associated with higher SPPB scores in both sexes. CONCLUSIONS: These findings underscore the importance of vitamin D assessment in older men and missed opportunities in both sexes for vitamin D supplementation and pharmaceutical treatment to reduce bone resorption after hip fracture."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Vitamin D deficiency (VDD) has been thought to be a common modifiable risk factor for severity and clinical outcome during critical illness. The primary objective was to evaluate the effect of single high-dose vitamin D supplementation on mortality in critically ill vitamin D-deficient children. The secondary objective was to study the change in vitamin D levels after the intervention. DESIGN AND SETTING: This study was a randomized controlled trial conducted at the Department of Pediatrics of a Tertiary Care Hospital from May 2019 to March 2020. SUBJECTS AND INTERVENTION: Two hundred and fifty vitamin D-deficient children aged 1 month-12 years admitted in pediatric intensive care units (PICU) were randomized into 2 groups (group A received 10,000 U/kg cholecalciferol intramuscularly, group B received no intervention), with 125 in each group. MEASUREMENT: Baseline serum calcium, ionized calcium, serum phosphate, vitamin D and parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels were measured at the time of recruitment. Ionized calcium, and kidney function tests (KFT) were repeated at 24 and 72 hours, while vitamin D and PTH levels were repeated at 72 hours only. RESULTS: Both the groups were comparable for baseline characteristics. There was no statistically significant difference between mortality (p = 0.439), length of PICU stay (p = 0.57) need and duration of mechanical ventilation (p = 0.449) between 2 groups. The subgroup analysis between severe and less severe VDD had similar results. However, there was a significant increase in levels of vitamin D after intervention in group A at 72 hours (p = 0). CONCLUSION: Administration of single high dose of vitamin D increases the vitamin D levels but does not convincingly improve the outcomes in vitamin D-deficient critically sick children admitted in PICU.

However, the definition of vitamin D deficiency has varied, and the threshold used might have a major impact on clinical results. The purpose of this study was to investigate the threshold effect in the relationship between vitamin D deficiency and the incidence of postoperative hypocalcemia. METHODS: A meta-analysis was done following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses recommendations. Studies that examined preoperative vitamin D levels and assessed postoperative hypocalcemia in total thyroidectomy patients were included. The investigation explored 3 vitamin D insufficiency thresholds: 15, 20, and 30 ng/mL. Odds ratios for biochemical and clinical hypocalcemia were determined, and sensitivity analyses were conducted to ensure the findings were robust. The methodologic quality was assessed using the Quality In Prognosis Studies technique. RESULTS: Twenty-eight studies were included, with 4,944 patients, 80.4% of whom were female. The risk of having postoperative biochemical hypocalcemia was highest at the 15 ng/mL threshold (odds ratio 3.22, 95% confidence interval 1.69-6.12), and reduced as the threshold increased to 20 ng/mL (odds ratio 1.69, 95% confidence interval 1.17-2.45) and 30 ng/mL (odds ratio 1.87, 95% confidence interval 1.20-2.91). Similar patterns were seen in clinical hypocalcemia. CONCLUSION: This investigation demonstrates the existence of a threshold effect in the relationship between vitamin D deficiency and postoperative hypocalcemia after total thyroidectomy. The classification of vitamin D deficiency has a substantial impact on clinical outcomes, highlighting the significance of standardizing criteria to enhance preoperative treatment and patient care."

METHODS: The study included 30 pregnant women diagnosed with recurrent vaginitis in their first trimester (group I), who presented at least twice between 1.5.2019 and 1.5.2022 at the obstetrics and gynecology clinic, and 30 healthy pregnant women in their first trimester without any complaints (group II). The vagititis group was compared with the control group for serum levels of vitamin B12, homocysteine, folic acid, and vitamin D. RESULTS: A comparison of the results between the groups revealed the following: homocysteine levels (μmol/L) were 10.75 (6.38-24.90) in group I (vaginitis positive) and 9.32 (4.26-17.10) in group II (control); vitamin B12 levels (ng/L) were 149.00 (63.00-328.00) in group I and 261.00 (126.00-544.00) in group II; folate levels (μg/L) were 10.56 (3.93-23.33) in group I and 9.48 (3.53-24.10) in group II; vitamin D levels (ng/mL) were 36.54 (23.65-75.68) in group I and 52.45 (26.57-105.00) in group II. Statistically significant elevation in homocysteine levels was observed in the vaginitis group (group I) (p<0.05). Vitamin B12 and D levels were significantly lower in the vaginitis group (group I) (p<0.05). CONCLUSION: In pregnant women with recurrent vaginitis, the levels of homocysteine, vitamin B12, and vitamin D may play a role in the etiology of the condition, and vitamins B12 and D may be considered for use in treatment.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND/AIM: In Graves' disease (GD), an autoimmune disease, antibodies targeting the thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) receptor cause the production of excessive amounts of thyroid hormone. A significant association was reported between low 25-hydroxy [25(OH)] vitamin D3 (VitD) levels and various autoimmune disorders. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the effects of VitD deficiency and replacement therapy on laboratory and clinical parameters in GD patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty GD patients and 37 healthy controls were included in this study. The GD patients were divided into two groups: the nonreplacement group was administered antithyroid treatment only (n = 18), and the replacement group was administered antithyroid treatment + VitD replacement (n = 22). Clinical and laboratory data of all the participants were compared at the time of diagnosis and 3 months after treatment. RESULTS: Baseline serum VitD levels in the GD patients were significantly lower than the baseline serum VitD levels in the control group (16.1 ± 9.9 vs. 22.2 ± 8.5 ng/mL, p < 0.005). A significant improvement was observed in the serum VitD levels in the replacement group after three months (14.6 ± 8.3 vs. 40.4 ± 17.2 ng/mL, p < 0.001). A significant increase in the serum TSH levels and a significant decrease in the serum free triiodothyronine (fT3) and free thyroxine (fT4) levels were observed in the replacement and nonreplacement groups at the end of three months. However, there was no significant effect of VitD replacement on the serum TSH, fT3, and fT4 levels. There was no difference in the serum thyroid receptor antibodies levels between the replacement and nonreplacement groups. CONCLUSION: Although VitD deficiency was detected in the GD patients, there was no significant accelerating effect of VitD replacement on the thyroid hormone levels. These results need to be confirmed with studies that have larger patient numbers and longer follow-up periods.",

      "abstract": "Background: Data on the impacts of vitamin D deficiency on sarcopenia in pediatric patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), are lacking. We aimed to investigate the relationships between vitamin D levels and sarcopenia in patients with newly diagnosed IBD. Methods: A cross-sectional, retrospective study was conducted in a tertiary care children's hospital. Pediatric IBD patients who underwent magnetic resonance (MR) enteroclysis at the time of initial diagnosis were included. Total psoas muscle area (tPMA) at the L4/L5 intervertebral level was demonstrated on MR by scanning the right and left psoas muscle areas. Sarcopenia was defined as a measurement under the 10th percentile according to MR-derived reference values of tPMA percentile charts for healthy children aged 1-18 years. Vitamin D insufficiency was defined as a serum 25-OH-D level below 30 ng/mL and deficiency as that below 20 ng/mL. Collected data from demographic evaluation, clinic, and laboratory tests were statistically assessed. Results: According to the MR-derived reference values of tPMA, 85% (n = 33) of UC and 81% (n = 21) of CD patients had sarcopenia. The severe vitamin D deficiency ratio was 35.9% (n = 14) in UC and 38.5% (n = 10) in CD. We found that vitamin D levels were similar in patients with UC and CD, while they were significantly lower in the group below the 3rd percentile of tPMA (n = 41, median 9.8) than in the group between the 3rd and 10th percentiles (n = 13, median 16.9; p = 0.038). Conclusions: Formulating strategies to recognize and prevent sarcopenia, including the prevention and-if necessary-the treatment of vitamin D deficiency, could bring multi-faceted benefits."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Prolonged symptoms have been reported following both COVID-19 infection and vaccination, with some cases leading to myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS). Of 80 patients presenting to our hospital with postvaccination syndrome, 28 met the diagnostic criteria for ME/CFS. We conducted a retrospective study on these 28 patients. METHODS: We measured serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels in 28 patients who developed ME/CFS after COVID-19 vaccination between August 2022 and February 2024. Vitamin D replacement therapy included dietary counseling, sun exposure recommendations, and oral vitamin D supplementation. We evaluated changes in blood vitamin D levels and symptom improvement. RESULTS: At initial visit, 27 of 28 patients diagnosed with ME/CFS had insufficient or deficient serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels (16 ± 4 ng/mL, mean ± SD). Following vitamin D replacement therapy, we observed an increase in blood vitamin D levels (28 ± 5 ng/mL) associated with a decrease in ME/CFS diagnostic symptoms (from 10.3 ± 2.1 to 3.3 ± 2.0). Notably, 23 of 28 patients (82%) no longer met ME/CFS diagnostic criteria after the therapy. Among the symptoms, sleep problems showed the most improvement (71%), followed by autonomic symptoms (68%). CONCLUSIONS: For patients developing ME/CFS after COVID-19 vaccination with insufficient or deficient vitamin D levels, appropriate vitamin D replacement therapy under medical guidance may lead to symptomatic relief. We are preparing a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy of vitamin D replacement therapy in individuals with ME/CFS who have developed vitamin D deficiency following COVID-19 infection or vaccination.",

      "abstract": "We have previously shown that high-dose vitamin D3 improved weight gain and neurodevelopmental indices in children receiving standard therapy for uncomplicated severe acute malnutrition (SAM). Here we present results of a randomised placebo-controlled trial in Lahore, Pakistan, to determine whether two oral doses of 200,000 international units (IU) vitamin D3 (the first administered on or before the day of hospital discharge and the second administered 14 days later) would benefit children aged 6-59 months during the convalescent phase of complicated SAM. Eligible participants were individually randomised to intervention vs. control arms with a one-to-one allocation ratio and stratification by hospital of recruitment using computer-generated random sequences. Double-blinding to treatment allocation was maintained by concealing allocation from participants' parents or guardians, their medical care providers, and all trial staff. The primary outcome was mean weight-for-height or -length z-score (WHZ) at 2-month follow-up. Secondary efficacy outcomes included mean WHZ at 6-month follow-up and mean lean mass index, Malawi Development Assessment Tool (MDAT) scores and serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) concentrations at 2- and 6-month follow-up. The trial has now completed. 259 children were randomised (128 to vitamin D, 131 to placebo), of whom 251 (96.9%) contributed data to analysis of the primary outcome (123 allocated to vitamin D, 128 to placebo). At 2-month follow-up, participants allocated to vitamin D had significantly higher mean serum 25(OH)D concentrations than those allocated to placebo (adjusted mean difference [aMD] 100.0 nmol/L, 95% confidence interval [CI] 72.2-127.8 nmol/L). This was not associated with an inter-arm difference in mean WHZ at 2-month follow-up (aMD 0.02, 95% CI -0.20 to 0.23), or in any anthropometric or neurodevelopmental secondary outcome assessed at 2- or 6-month follow-up. The intervention was safe. In conclusion, high-dose vitamin D3 elevated mean serum 25(OH)D concentrations in children receiving standard therapy for complicated SAM in Pakistan, but did not influence any anthropometric or neurodevelopmental outcome studied. The trial was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov with the identifier NCT04270643.",

This systematic review was conducted according to the PRISMA 2020 guidelines. PubMed, Google Scholar, Embase, and Scopus databases were accessed in September 2024. All randomised clinical trials (RCTs) comparing two or more treatments for postmenopausal osteoporosis supplemented with vitamin D and/or calcium were accessed. Only studies that indicated daily vitamin D and/or calcium supplementation doses were accessed. Data from 37 RCTs (43,397 patients) were retrieved. Patients received a mean of 833.6 ± 224.0 mg and 92.8 ± 228.7 UI of calcium and vitamin D supplementation, respectively. The mean length of the follow-up was 25.8 ± 13.3 months. The mean age of the patients was 66.4 ± 5.6 years, and the mean BMI was 25.2 ± 1.6 kg/m2. There was evidence of a statistically significant negative association between daily vitamin D supplementation and gastrointestinal adverse events (r = - 0.5; P = 0.02) and mortality (r = - 0.7; P = 0.03). No additional statistically significant associations were evidenced. In postmenopausal women who undergo antiresorptive treatment for osteoporosis, vitamin D was associated with a lower frequency of gastrointestinal adverse events and mortality.

This study aimed to evaluate the effects of vitamin D supplementation on fatigue and disease activity in SLE patients. METHODS: Patients diagnosed based on EULAR/ACR 2019 criteria were divided into three groups: no supplementation, 4000 IU, and 8000 IU of vitamin D daily for six months. Clinical assessments included serum complement levels (C3 and C4), fatigue scores (Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy (FACIT)-Fatigue and Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS)), and disease activity (Safety of Estrogens in Lupus Erythematosus National Assessment-Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index (SELENA-SLEDAI)). RESULTS: Results showed significant increases in vitamin D levels and serum complement levels in the supplementation groups. Serum complement levels and fatigue scores improved significantly in both the 4000 IU and 8000 IU groups. Additionally, there was a slight reduction in SELENA-SLEDAI scores in the treated groups, but without statistical significance. CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that vitamin D supplementation positively affects fatigue and some parameters of disease activity in SLE patients, though its overall impact on disease activity needs further investigation."

Vitamin D deficiency is prevalent in the general population, and even more so in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients, in which it contributes to the development and progression of mineral and bone disorder. The landscape of vitamin D treatment has evolved, with several analogues now available, each possessing distinct pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties, efficacies and safety profiles. This diversity allows for tailored, personalized approaches to treatment in CKD patients. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of vitamin D, including its natural sources and metabolism, and examines the main available pharmacological vitamin D products. Particular emphasis is placed on their application in CKD management, highlighting how these compounds can be strategically used to address both vitamin D deficiency and secondary hyperparathyroidism, while also acknowledging the ongoing debate about their impact on bone health and other clinical outcomes."

The aim of the study is to compare the effects of calcifediol versus two different frequencies of cholecalciferol administration on vitamin D supplementation, and to identity the key parameters that predict response to treatment. METHODS: This retrospective, real-world cohort study included 105 patients, who were divided into three groups. Group 1 (n = 21) received cholecalciferol 50,000 international units (UI) once a month, Group 2 (n = 27) received cholecalciferol 25,000 UI every two weeks, and Group 3 (n = 57) received calcifediol 0.266 mg (mg) once a month. The primary outcome measured was the delta increase in 25(OH)D levels after 6 months of treatment, compared to pre-treatment levels. RESULTS: The study revealed a significant greater delta increase in 25(OH)D levels in Group 1, which received cholecalciferol 50,000 IU once a month, compared to the other two groups. However, multiple regression analysis indicated that neither the type of molecule nor the frequency of administration independently influenced the treatment outcome. Only pre-treatment serum 25(OH)D levels were found to significantly affect the outcome. Based on the receiver operating characteristic curve, serum 25(OH)D levels below 19.5 ng/dL were predictive of a doubling of pre-treatment values, with high sensitivity and specificity. CONCLUSION: Pre-treatment serum 25(OH)D levels are valuable for selecting patients who should undergo supplementation. This finding suggests the importance of tailoring therapy according to the degree of vitamin D deficiency.",

METHODS: Publications on vitamin D and cancer were retrieved from Scopus up to November 2024. English-language original and review articles were analyzed using Excel, VOSviewer, and Scimago Graphica, focusing on publication trends, citation impacts, and research themes. RESULTS: A total of 11,442 publications (80.01% original articles, 19.98% reviews; 51.24% open access) were analyzed. The United States of America led in publications (38.3%) and citations (56.2%), followed by China (7.7%) and the United Kingdom (7.2%) in output, and the United Kingdom (10.6%) and Germany (6.4%) in citations. Countries with the highest citations per document were Belgium (103.4), Slovenia (87.9), and Puerto Rico (76.6). The most frequently studied cancers in relation to vitamin D were breast, colorectal, prostate, skin, lung, ovarian, pancreatic, gastric, hepatocellular, thyroid, leukemia, multiple myeloma, bladder, lymphoma, osteosarcoma, cervical, endometrial, and glioblastoma, respectively. Cluster analysis revealed key patterns related to vitamin D: Calcitriol's chemopreventive role in breast, prostate, and colorectal cancers, dietary vitamin D for its involvement in ovarian cancer, vitamin D for regulation of cancer-related hypercalcemia, vitamin D deficiency links to inflammation-obesity-cancer risk, VDR polymorphisms affecting outcomes in lung and colorectal cancers, and vitamin D's photoprotective effects on skin malignancies, and vitamin D in ulcerative colitis-related cancer. The most cited articles emphasized optimal vitamin D levels and cancer prevention. CONCLUSION: This study highlights the extensive research on vitamin D and its complex links to cancer, emphasizing future prospects with a focus on precision medicine approaches, including targeted supplementation and genomic analyses, to better address individual variability in cancer prevention and treatment."

This study investigates how ApaI, BsmI, TaqI, and FokI SNPs affect IBD phenotype and progression. A total of 76 Crohn's disease (CD) and 68 ulcerative colitis (UC) patients were genotyped. On initial bivariate analysis, the AA genotype of ApaI was accompanied by higher rates of penetrating (B3) CD (36.7% vs. 8.7%; p = 0.012). The FokI SNP was associated with disease location, with the ff genotype predisposing to CD and affecting the upper GI (36.4% vs. 7.7%; p = 0.044) or the colon (90.9% vs. 50.8%; p = 0.038). Moreover, patients harboring the ApaI A allele (AA/Aa) experienced higher rates of steroid-refractory or steroid-dependent CD. In multivariate analyses, the aa genotype showed a protective effect against hospitalization (aOR = 0.17; p = 0.013) in CD, whereas the TT genotype emerged as an independent risk factor (aOR = 4.79; p = 0.044). Moreover, the aa genotype was independently associated with a decreased risk of IBD-related surgery (aOR = 0.055; p = 0.014). VDR SNPs, particularly ApaI, influence disease phenotype, progression, and treatment response in CD. The aa genotype of ApaI appears to confer protection against adverse disease outcomes.",

A 10-week trial was conducted with 288 Hy-Line Brown hens (56 weeks old) housed on the floor in 18 pens (16 hens per pen; 9 replicate pens per treatment). The control diet contained 4.5% Ca, while the AM/PM treatment had 4.1% in feed with additional Ca and vitamin D supplemented through PM drinking water, with other nutrients kept constant in both diets. Daily egg production and weekly feed and water consumption were recorded. Hen weight, welfare scores, and egg quality were assessed at weeks 5 and 10. Blood, ileal digesta, and tibia samples were collected (from 4 hens/pen) at week 10 for serum Ca and vitamin D, digestibility, and bone analyses. Liver and kidney weights, as well as keel bone scores, were also recorded at week 10. Hens on the AM/PM diet consumed significantly less water (171.23 vs. 196.85 mL/bird/day; p < 0.001) and had a significantly higher serum vitamin D (27.59 vs. 22.64 ng/mL; p = 0.014), with a tendency towards elevated serum calcium levels (31.99 vs. 29.74 mg/dL; p = 0.089) compared to the control group. No differences in laying performance, co-efficient of variance (CV%) in individual hen and egg weight, liver and kidney weight, or keel and tibia characteristics were observed between treatments (p > 0.05). Similarly, there was no treatment effect on egg quality, and welfare parameters at week 5 and 10, except for smaller eggs (57.13 vs. 57.96; p = 0.015), and reduced chest (0.96 vs. 1.16; p = 0.028) and belly feather damage (1.34 vs. 1.55; p = 0.021), respectively, in hens of the AM/PM treatment compared to the control at week 10. The AM/PM treatment improved ileal digestible energy as is (9.00 vs. 8.22; p = 0.022) and as dry matter (10.00 vs. 9.06; p = 0.014) compared to the control one. Overall, it demonstrated comparable performance to the control, with added benefits of reduced water intake, better feather condition and vitamin D level and energy digestibility."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Vitamin D receptor activators (VDRAs) are widely used in patients with osteoporosis; however, the frequency of acute kidney injury (AKI) due to VDRAs is unclear. This study aimed to investigate whether the incidence of AKI after VDRA initiation differed among patients with different renal functions. METHODS: The medical records of Japanese patients who were newly prescribed with VDRAs for osteoporosis at the Fujita Health University Hospital or Kyoto University Hospital between April 2012 and March 2022 were retrospectively reviewed in this study. The RIFLE (Risk, Injury, Failure, Loss of function, End-stage kidney disease) criteria were used to assess the incidence of AKI within 7 days after initiation of VDRA therapy. Additionally, the AKI algorithm was used to assess the incidence of AKI from 8 to 365 days after initiation of VDRA therapy. RESULTS: The incidence of AKI, as defined by the RIFLE criteria, was significantly higher in patients with normal renal function or end-stage renal failure than in those with mild renal decline (p < 0.05); the incidence of AKI, defined using the AKI algorithm, showed a similar trend. We found that the lack of serum calcium level monitoring before the initiation of VDRAs might be a risk factor for AKI defined by the RIFLE criteria (odds ratio = 2.004, p = 0.096). CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of AKI after the initiation of VDRA therapy was high, even if renal function was normal. Thus, our results suggest that monitoring serum calcium levels before the initiation of VDRA therapy is necessary, regardless of renal function.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Allergic rhinitis is a common disease affecting 10 percent people. Sleep, quality of life, and productivity at work are all significantly impacted by severe allergic rhinitis. An increase in allergic diseases has been associated with a lack of vitamin D. METHODS: It is a case control study in which all patients with allergic rhinitis were included and their vitamin d levels were evaluated. Case group was given vitamin d supplementation weekly and their TNSS score was evaluated against those control group where no supplementation was given. RESULTS: A total of 80 individuals were diagnosed with Allergic Rhinitis. At the time of presentation, the average age of the people was 24.5 years. The average TNSS value before therapy for the study group that took oral vitamin D3 medicine was 11.10 ± 2.10, and after treatment it dropped to 3.2 ± 0.5. The average TNSS score before to therapy was 12.40 ± 2.50 in the control group, which utilised medicines devoid of oral vitamin D3. DISCUSSION: The link between low vitamin D levels and an increased incidence of allergic disorders has recently attracted more attention on a worldwide scale. But studies on this area have shown contradictory results. The purpose of this study was to determine whether or not supplementing with vitamin D3 helped individuals suffering from allergic rhinitis. CONCLUSION: Vitamin D3 significantly improves the clinical manifestations of allergic rhinitis when administered. Noticeable clinical benefits are achieved when the therapy method for allergic rhinitis is changed by injecting vitamin D3."

Herein, we performed a retrospective analysis of serum samples from a phase-II randomized placebo-controlled trial involving a single large bolus of 10,000 IU/kg vitamin D3 ingested by critically ill children with VDD (25-OH-D < 50 nmol/L). Targeted and untargeted methods were used to comprehensively measure 6 vitamin D metabolites, 239 lipids, 68 polar metabolites, and 4 electrolytes using a multi-step data workflow for compound authentication. Complementary statistical methods classified circulating metabolites/lipids associated with vitamin D repletion following high-dose vitamin D3 intake (n = 20) versus placebo (n = 11) comprising an optional standard of care maintenance dose (< 1000 IU/day). There was a striking increase in median serum concentrations of 25-OH-D3 (4.7-fold), 3-epi-25-OH-D3 (24-fold) and their C3-epimer ratio (6.7-fold) in treated patients on day 3, whereas serum vitamin D3 peaked on day 1 (128-fold) unlike placebo. Treatment response differences were attributed to D3 bioavailability and C3-epimerase activity without evidence of hypercalcemia. For the first time, we report the detection of circulating 3-epi-D3 that was strongly correlated with vitamin D3 uptake (r = 0.898). Metabolomic studies revealed that vitamin D sufficiency (serum 25-OH-D >75 nmol/L) coincided with lower circulating levels of 3-methylhistidine, cystine, S-methylcysteine, uric acid, and two lysophosphatidylcholines 7 days after treatment. Rapid correction of VDD was associated with indicators of lower oxidative stress, inflammation, and muscle protein turn-over that may contribute clinical benefits in high-risk critically ill children.",

      "abstract": "IMPORTANCE: Vitamin D deficiency is a risk factor for multiple sclerosis (MS) and is associated with the risk of disease activity, but data on the benefits of supplementation are conflicting. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of high-dose cholecalciferol as monotherapy in reducing disease activity in patients with clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) typical for MS. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: The D-Lay MS trial was a parallel, double-blind, randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial in 36 MS centers in France. Patients were enrolled from July 2013 to December 2020 (final follow-up on January 18, 2023). Untreated patients with CIS aged 18 to 55 years with CIS duration less than 90 days, serum vitamin D concentration less than 100 nmol/L, and diagnostic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) meeting 2010 criteria for dissemination in space or 2 or more lesions and presence of oligoclonal bands were recruited. INTERVENTION: Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive oral cholecalciferol 100 000 IU (n = 163) or placebo (n = 153) every 2 weeks for 24 months. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome measure was disease activity, defined as occurrence of a relapse and/or MRI activity (new and/or contrast-enhancing lesions) over 24 months of follow-up, also analyzed as separate secondary outcomes. RESULTS: Of the 316 participants enrolled and randomized (median [IQR] age, 34 [28-42] years; 70% women), the primary analysis included 303 patients (95.9%) who took at least 1 dose of the study drug and 288 (91.1%) ultimately completed the 24-month trial. Disease activity was observed in 94 patients (60.3%) in the vitamin D group and 109 patients (74.1%) in the placebo group (hazard ratio [HR], 0.66 [95% CI, 0.50-0.87]; P = .004), and median time to disease activity was longer in the vitamin D group (432 vs 224 days; log-rank P = .003). All 3 secondary MRI outcomes reported significant differences favoring the vitamin D group vs the placebo group: MRI activity (89 patients [57.1%] vs 96 patients [65.3%]; HR, 0.71 [95% CI, 0.53-0.95]; P = .02), new lesions (72 patients [46.2%] vs 87 patients [59.2%]; HR, 0.61 [95% CI, 0.44-0.84]; P = .003), and contrast-enhancing lesions (29 patients [18.6%] vs 50 patients [34.0%]; HR, 0.47 [95% CI, 0.30-0.75]; P = .001). All 10 secondary clinical outcomes showed no significant difference, including relapse, which occurred in 28 patients (17.9%) in the vitamin D group vs 32 (21.8%) in the placebo group (HR, 0.69 [95% CI, 0.42-1.16]; P = .16). Results were similar in a subset of 247 patients meeting updated 2017 diagnostic criteria for relapsing-remitting MS at treatment initiation. Severe adverse events occurred in 17 patients in the vitamin D group and 13 in the placebo group, none of which were related to cholecalciferol. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Oral cholecalciferol 100 000 IU every 2 weeks significantly reduced disease activity in CIS and early relapsing-remitting MS. These results warrant further investigation, including the potential role of pulse high-dose vitamin D as add-on therapy. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01817166.",

This study intends to determine whether cisplatin plus vitamin D could be a more successful combination than standard monotherapy for non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) by targeting the transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β)/mothers against decapentaplegic homolog 4 (SMAD4) and janus kinase 2 (JAK2)/signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) signaling pathways and their downstream targets. Cytotoxic effects of vitamin D on MCF-7, MCFR-10, H1299, A549, and PC3 cell lines were evaluated by sulforhodamine-B (SRB) assay, indicating that H1299 and A549 were the most effected cell lines; hence, they were selected for more investigation. IC50 values of cisplatin against H1299 and A549 cells were established. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) was used to assess the expression levels of JAK2, STAT3, TGF-β, Smad4, matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2), and MMP-9 in both cell lines treated with vitamin D, cisplatin, or both. Results demonstrated remarkable expression of the aforementioned genes in H1299 and A549 cells, which was sharply decreased once the combination treatment was administered. Additionally, the protein expression of VEGF, MMP9, and angiotensin I, II is considerably inhibited by this combination. According to the obtained data, vitamin D and cisplatin combination therapy can target genes and proteins involved in cell adhesion, migration, and invasion.",

      "abstract": "The bone hormone fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) regulates renal phosphate reabsorption and the enzymatic production of active vitamin D3 [1,25(OH)2D3]. Therefore, FGF23 production in bone cells is closely regulated by 1,25(OH)2D3 acting via the vitamin D receptor (VDR). Skin cells can produce hydroxyvitamin D3 metabolites from its precursor D3 made through ultraviolet B light exposure. Interestingly, the expression of Fgf23 has been found in rodent skin, but its expression, regulation, and role in human skin are unclear. Therefore, we investigated whether hydroxyvitamin D3 metabolites regulate FGF23 in human skin cells. Primary adult and neonatal epidermal keratinocytes (HEKn), melanocytes (HEMn), dermal fibroblasts (HDFn), as well as human melanoma cells, HaCaT, HaCaT VDR KO, and A431 epidermoid cells, were used to assess FGF23 gene expression (quantitative reverse-transcription real-time PCR), cellular FGF23 protein (Western blot), or secreted FGF23 protein (ELISA) after treatment with hydroxyvitamin D3 metabolites. HaCaT cells treated with recombinant FGF23 were used to explore its function in skin. Human skin cells can synthesize FGF23. Treatment with 1,25(OH)2D3 significantly increased FGF23 mRNA levels in HaCaT and HDFn cells, and moderately in HEKn cells, mediated in part by the VDR. It also moderately enhanced mRNA levels of the FGF23-processing enzyme GALNT3 and stimulated secretion of hormonally active FGF23 from HaCaT cells. Treatment of HaCaT cells with FGF23 increased mRNA levels of the cholesterol- and vitamin D-metabolizing enzymes, CYP11A1 and CYP27A1. In conclusion, human skin cells express and secrete FGF23, which is regulated by 1,25(OH)2D3 acting in part by the VDR. FGF23 affects the expression of cutaneous sterol-metabolizing enzymes.NEW & NOTEWORTHY This study shows for the first time the expression and secretion of the FGF23 hormone by human skin cells. In addition, we identified the active vitamin D3 hormone, 1,25(OH)2D3, to be a potent regulator of dermal FGF23 expression and protein secretion, partly involving the vitamin D receptor. Furthermore, we provide initial evidence demonstrating that FGF23 upregulates the gene expression of CYP11A1 and CYP27A1 in keratinocytes.",

We hypothesized that vitamin D deficiency may present greater risk in KTR in those with greater burden of MetS features. METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated 1792 KTR with no treated diabetes at transplant between 1998 and 2018. Vitamin D was measured at ≥3 months post transplant. MetS features were defined by National Cholesterol Education Program, Adult Treatment Panel III (NCEP-ATP III) criteria. The primary outcome was treated post-transplant diabetes mellitus (PTDM) incidence. RESULTS: In 1792 non-diabetic KTR followed for 10956 patient-years, 237 patients developed PTDM. For KTR meeting NCEP-ATP-III criteria, with 4th-quartile 25(OH)D, there were 1.5 new diagnoses per 100 patient-years, versus 4.2 events per 100 patient-years in KTR with 1st-quartile 25(OH)D (p<0.001). In multivariate survival regression, vitamin D was, accounting for individual NCEP-ATP-III criteria, associated with PTDM (HR 0.93 per 10 nmol/mL 25(OH)D, p=0.007) independently of fasting blood sugar and HbA1c. In marginal effects analysis, MetS impact on PTDM increased as serum 25(OH)D levels decreased. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that decreased 25(OH)D is associated with increased PTDM, and this marginal impact worsens as KTR have an increased burden of MetS."

This study explored the combined effects of Vitamin D (VD) and dapagliflozin (Dap) on metabolic and renal complications in an HF/HS diet-induced rat model of metabolic syndrome. The combination therapy significantly improved insulin sensitivity, reduced fasting blood glucose levels, and alleviated renal injury markers such as blood urea nitrogen and creatinine. It also attenuated inflammation, lipid accumulation, and endoplasmic reticulum stress in renal tissues, as evidenced by reduced levels of inflammatory cytokines and key stress markers (GRP78 and CHOP). Importantly, the study highlights the novel synergistic potential of VD and Dap in addressing these complications through complementary mechanisms.

The animals were randomly distributed into four experimental groups (n = 8): Control: no treatment; Vit D: systemic Vit D administration through gavage; PBM: local irradiation with low-intensity laser therapy; Vit D/PBM: systemic Vit D administration through gavage and local irradiation with low-intensity laser therapy. The animals were euthanized 15 days after treatments. It was evaluated newly formed bone area (NFBA), percentage of mature and immature collagen fibers (picrosirius red staining and polarized light), immunohistochemical identification of tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP), transforming growth factor (TGF), and osteocalcin (OCN). Data were statistically analyzed (ANOVA, Kruskal-Wallis, p < 0.05). RESULTS: All experimental groups presented similar statistical results in the evaluated parameters. Some qualitative differences were observed, as follows. Groups PBM, Vit D, and Vit D/ PBM presented a slight amount of newly formed bone. Group Vit D presented a higher amount of mature collagen fibers. Groups Vit D and PBM presented higher immunoexpression of OCN than other experimental groups. CONCLUSION: It can be concluded that Vit D and PBM did not significantly increase the amount of bone tissue formed but showed a trend towards enhanced bone maturation in the early healing stages of critical-sized defects surgically created in rat calvaria."

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: Differentiated thyroid carcinoma (DTC) is the most frequent endocrine cancer, with a high incidence in young population. Patients with postoperative DTC are usually considered with increased risk of bone loss, possibly due to the thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) suppression therapy. However, it remains unclear whether vitamin D and calcium supplementation is beneficial on bone metabolism of young patients with vitamin D malnutrition after thyroidectomy of DTC. METHODS: In this one-year prospective study, adult men younger than 50 years or premenopausal women with DTC and vitamin D insufficiency or deficiency were enrolled after thyroidectomy, who were administered with daily supplements of 1000-2000 IU vitamin D3 and 600 mg of elemental calcium (calcium-D3) or not. Propensity score matching (PSM) was applied to identify baseline-matched cohorts. RESULTS: A total of 458 patients with a median age of 37 (range 21-50) years were enrolled, with 94 (20.5%) patients supplemented with calcium-D3. After PSM, we identified baseline-matched cohorts of 246 DTC patients, of which 82 patients were supplemented with calcium-D3 and 164 were not. After 12 months' supplementation, lower serum levels of β-CTX (0.27 ± 0.15 vs. 0.35 ± 0.18 ng/ml, P = 0.004), PTH (36.2 ± 12.7 vs. 45.2 ± 14.6 pg/ml, P < 0.001) and higher BMD at lumbar spine (1.8% vs. 0.7%, P = 0.050) and total hip (1.1% vs. -0.4%, P < 0.001) were observed compared to the control group. Among all the 458 patients, increase of 25OHD levels was closely associated with decrease of PTH, ALP and β-CTX levels and improvement in total hip BMD throughout the one-year study period. CONCLUSION: Vitamin D and calcium supplements can reduce PTH levels and bone loss, possibly contributing to protecting bone of young DTC patients with vitamin D malnutrition after thyroidectomy."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Vaccine-related myocarditis is recognized as a rare but important complication, especially after mass-scale mRNA COVID-19 vaccination. Knowledge regarding how to minimize the risk is limited. As NK cells can mediate acute myocarditis after mRNA COVID-19 vaccination and vitamin D may inhibit NK cells via cytokine modulation, we hypothesize that the myocarditis side effect is related to a hypovitaminosis D - mRNA vaccine - hypercytokinemia - NK cell axis, which is amendable to clinical intervention. METHODS: Biochemical, immunophenotypic and genotyping assays were performed to examine vitamin D status and immune profiles in 60 patients who had BNT162b2 vaccine-related acute myocarditis. RESULTS: A high incidence of hypovitaminosis D (73.3%) was observed in these individuals with vaccine-related myocarditis, particularly in those presented with chest pain or intensive care unit (ICU) admission. Moreover, vitamin D level was negatively associated with peak serum cardiac troponin T level during vaccine-related myocarditis. Genotypically, the GC (vitamin D binding protein) rs4588T allele which encoded the GC2 isoform of vitamin D binding protein was a risk allele, whereas the GC1S isoform was protective. Mechanistically, hypovitaminosis D was associated with higher levels of cytokines pivotal for natural killer (NK) cells (particularly interleukin-1β (IL-1β), IL-12, Interferon-γ (IFN-γ), and IL-8) and higher percentage of CD69+ NK cells in blood, which in turn correlated with chest pain presentation. CONCLUSION: These data support the hypothesis that vitamin D plays a crucial role in mitigating mRNA vaccine-related myocarditis by modulating proinflammatory cytokine milieu and subsequent unfavorable NK cell activation, laying a groundwork for preventive and treatment strategies.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Hypertension, the first global modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD) morbidity and mortality, is a consequential and remediable threat to the health of individuals and society. Therefore, we conducted this study to explore the role of calcium (Ca++), magnesium (Mg++), and vitamin D (Vit-D) supplementation as complementary therapies for hypertension, focusing on their effects on systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), and pulse rate. METHODS: This systematic review and meta-analysis examined relevant 6509 articles in PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Cochrane CENTRAL up to October 2024. The primary outcome was the difference in blood pressure measurements (systolic and diastolic) and the pulse rate. The extracted data were analyzed using Open Meta Analyst software. RESULTS: This systematic review and meta-analysis included 40 studies; of them, 24 studies were analyzed. Ca++ was associated with a significant drop in the DBP (MD: -2.04, 95% CI [-3.39, -0.69], P = 0.01), but not in the SBP (P = 0.34) or pulse rate (P = 0.84). Mg++ significantly reduced DBP (MD: -1.64, 95% CI [-3.19, -0.09], P = 0.04), but had no significant effect on the SBP (P = 0.16) or pulse rate (P = 0.81). The estimated effect of Vit-D showed a significant reduction in SBP (MD: -2.83, 95% CI [-5.47, -0.199], P = 0.04) and DBP (MD: -1.64, 95% CI [-2.97, -0.3], P = 0.01). CONCLUSION: Ca++ and Mg++ significantly reduced DBP but had no significant effect on SBP or the pulse rate. Whereas, vitamin D significantly reduced SBP and DBP.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients show high rates of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and mortality. In the general population, obesity, hypertension, and diabetes are known as the classical CVD risk factors. However, CKD patients have other predisposing CVD factors more associated with bone and mineral metabolism disorders (BMD). BMD originates from reduced 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D and hypocalcemia, which lead to secondary hyperparathyroidism, with increased parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels and hyperphosphatemia as the progression of renal damage. Due to their pleiotropic effects, vitamin D and its analogs, such as cholecalciferol, calcitriol, or paricalcitol, have proven effective in controlling BMD and CVD. On the other hand, visceral adiposity has been shown to increase the risk for CVD in both the general and CKD populations via complex autocrine and paracrine hormonal mechanisms. This seems to be the case with fat surrounding the epicardium. Although it has not been widely evaluated, the fat surrounding the kidneys, or the perirenal adipose tissue (PAT), could also share similarities with the epicardial in terms of its potential contribution to the CVD risk observed in these patients. We conducted a preliminary study to assess differences in PAT on a sample of patients with CKD presenting diverse CVD history and who were receiving different vitamin D-receptor activators. METHODS/RESULTS: An observational study was performed at UNIRENAL Center (Venezuela), from January to November 2015. Analytical and clinical parameters were evaluated. The PAT thickness was measured in centimeters through a B-mode ultrasound. Thus, we included 83 CKD patients treated with vitamin D or analogs (mean age 58.3 ± 16y); 57.83% were females. Nearly half of the sample was classified as CKD-G3 (n = 40). Prior history of CVD was present in 55.4% (N = 46) of participants. Must of the patients (n = 46;55.42%) receiving oral cholecalciferol (1000 IU/day) as part of the treatment for lower levels of vitamin D or BMD related to CKD (mainly elevated PTH), followed by those under calcitriol at 0.5 mcg/day (n = 27;32.53%), and around 12% (n = 10;12.05%) on paricalcitol (1 mcg/day). The mean treatment vintage was 20 ± 6 months for cholecalciferol, 18 ± 4 months for calcitriol, and 16 ± 2 months for paricalcitol. Those with a history of CVD (n = 46) showed higher levels of urea (mean 62.0vs45.2 mg/dl, p < 0.05), uric acid (mean 5.5vs4.3 mg/dl; p < 0.03), and iPTH (mean 186.2vs65.2pcg/dl; p < 0.05) than patients free of CVD events (n = 37). These findings were also in parallel with decreased renal function in the group with previous CVD history, as evidenced by a significantly lower eGFR (mean 53.55vs89.00 ml/min/1.73 m2,p < 0.001). Similarly, the mean PAT thickness was elevated in the group with a history of CVD in relation to those with no previous CVD events (0.99vs0.80 cm; SD ± 0.30;p ~ 0.05). The comparative analysis for the patients with prior cardiovascular events between the three treatments revealed that those on paricalcitol had lesser PAT accumulation than those treated with cholecalciferol or calcitriol (p < 0.05). In conclusion, our study shows that PAT thickness in CKD may be influenced by vitamin D analog-based treatment. Further research is needed to better understand the mechanistic links between PAT, BMD, and CVD in this population.",
