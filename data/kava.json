      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: As the primary cause of various preventable illnesses, smoking results in approximately five million premature deaths each year in the US and a multitude of adults living with serious illness. The majority of smokers know the health risks associated with smoking and intend to quit. However, quitting is very difficult partly because of insomnia and stress associated with it. Current tobacco cessation medications are not designed to address these problems, which may have contributed to their limited success in enabling cessation. Novel interventions are thus urgently needed to enhance success rates in tobacco cessation. Based on its historical usage and our preliminary data, kava is such a candidate. Kava, customarily enjoyed by South Pacific Islanders, is known for its relaxing effects, stress-relieving properties, and ability to enhance sleep. In the US, it is marketed and distributed as a dietary supplement due to its recognized calming properties. A pilot trial was performed among active smokers with a one-week ingestion of a kava supplement. The results for the first-time revealed kava's potential in enabling tobacco cessation with effects on a panel of biological signatures. The primary goal of this trial is to replicate kava's effects on the biological signatures of tobacco use, stress, and sleep in addition to its compliance and safety among those who smoke. METHODS: A double-blind randomized placebo controlled two-arm trial will enroll 76 smokers with intention to quit, who will consume AB-free kava at a dietary supplement dose or placebo, 3 times per day for 4 weeks with two follow-ups. DISCUSSION: The study will (1) monitor the adherence to and safety of AB-free kava consumption among smokers and evaluate changes in smoking habits, and (2) quantify a panel of non-invasive translatable biomarkers to objectively evaluate AB-free kava's holistic effects on biological signatures associated with tobacco use, stress, and sleep. We hypothesize that AB-free kava is a novel and promising intervention to facilitate tobacco cessation via its holistic effects associated with managing stress and insomnia during abstinence. If the results from this study support our hypothesis, kava could emerge as an affordable and accessible dietary supplement candidate for tobacco cessation.

      "abstract": "Kava consumption is a traditional practice in Polynesian and Micronesian cultures. It has recently gained popularity in the United States for therapeutic and recreational use. We report the following case. A man presented to the emergency department after a fall while intoxicated on kava. He was medically admitted for altered mental status, facial and clavicle fractures, and hyponatremia. Psychiatry was consulted for management of delirium. On interview, he reported consuming escalating amounts of kava for weeks despite attempts to stop. He was diagnosed with acute kava withdrawal with hyperactive delirium, treated with phenobarbital load (860 mg) and taper (390 mg). Continuous dexmedetomidine drip to hospital day 3 treated sympathetic activation and breakthrough agitation. By day 4, his delirium resolved and remained in remission until discharge. We performed a systematic review for reports of kava withdrawal, returning 9 studies. Eight assessed withdrawal symptoms after cessation of a low controlled dose of kava extract with no symptoms noted. One reported a case series of heavy kava users with seizure-like events. No publications discussed treatment of kava withdrawal. To our knowledge, this is the first publication to describe kava withdrawal syndrome and its effective treatment with phenobarbital.",

      "abstract": "Generalised Anxiety Disorder (GAD) is a prevalent, chronic mental health disorder. The measurement of regional brain gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) offers insight into its role in anxiety and is a potential biomarker for treatment response. Research literature suggests Piper methysticum (Kava) is efficacious as an anxiety treatment, but no study has assessed its effects on central GABA levels. This study investigated dorsal anterior cingulate (dACC) GABA levels in 37 adult participants with GAD. GABA was measured using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS) at baseline and following an eight-week administration of Kava (standardised to 120 mg kavalactones twice daily) (n = 20) or placebo (n = 17). This study was part of the Kava for the Treatment of GAD (KGAD; ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02219880), a 16-week intervention study. Compared with the placebo group, the Kava group had a significant reduction in dACC GABA (p = 0.049) at eight weeks. Baseline anxiety scores on the HAM-A were positively correlated with GABA levels but were not significantly related to treatment. Central GABA reductions following Kava treatment may signal an inhibitory effect, which, if considered efficacious, suggests that GABA levels are modulated by Kava, independent of reported anxiety symptoms. dACC GABA patterns suggest a functional role of higher levels in clinical anxiety but warrants further research for symptom benefit. Findings suggest that dACC GABA levels previously un-examined in GAD could serve as a biomarker for diagnosis and treatment response.",

      "abstract": "Kava is a South Pacific plant-based medicine with anxiolytic properties, but little is known about the impact kava has on gene expression or whether gene expression can serve as a marker of kava response. This study aimed to determine whether kava treatment alters the expression of genes with physiological relevance to anxiety pathophysiology and whether the baseline expression of these physiologically relevant genes modifies the efficacy of kava treatment. In this post hoc analysis, we examined the expression of 48 genes relevant to the pathophysiology of anxiety collected from a double-blind randomized controlled trial that assessed the efficacy of kava treatment in generalized anxiety disorder. Peripheral blood gene expression was measured in 71 (34 kava, 37 placebo) adults at baseline and in 40 (19 kava, 21 placebo) after 8 weeks of treatment by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Results revealed that kava decreased the expression of a subunit of the GABAA -rho receptor gene (GABRR2) and catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT), a gene related to catecholamine metabolism. Kava efficacy was not found to be modified by baseline (pretreatment) expression of relevant genes. Although these results did not withstand statistical correction for multiple comparisons and require external validation, they support the notion that kava's mechanism of action includes interaction with GABAergic and catecholaminergic systems.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: B-cell lymphoma, which originates from B cells at diverse differentiation stages, is the most common non-Hodgkin lymphoma with tremendous treatment challenges and unsatisfactory clinical outcomes. Flavokawain B (FKB), a naturally occurring chalcone extracted from kava, possesses promising anticancer properties. However, evidence on the effects of FKB on hematological malignancies, particularly lymphomas, remains scarce. PURPOSE: This study aimed to investigate the antilymphoma effect of FKB and its underlying mechanisms. STUDY DESIGN/METHODS: Proliferation assays, flow cytometry, and western blotting were employed to determine whether and how FKB affected B-cell lymphoma cell lines in vitro. Xenograft mouse models were established to evaluate the antilymphoma efficacy of FKB in vivo. RESULTS: FKB reduced the viability of a panel of B-cell lymphoma cell lines in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Mitochondrial apoptosis was markedly induced by FKB, as evidenced by an increased percentage of annexin V-positive cells, a loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, and cleavage of caspase-3 and PARP. Moreover, FKB inhibited BCL-XL expression and synergized with the BCL-2 inhibitor ABT-199. Mechanistically, FKB treatment decreased the phosphorylation of Akt, mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK3β), and ribosomal protein S6 (RPS6). Pharmacological blockage of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), Akt, or GSK3β potentiated the activity of FKB, indicating the involvement of the PI3K/Akt cascade in FKB-mediated inhibitory effects. In mouse xenograft models, the intraperitoneal administration of FKB significantly decreased lymphoma growth, accompanied by diminished mitosis and Ki-67 staining of tumor tissues. CONCLUSION: Our data demonstrate the robust therapeutic potential of FKB in the treatment of B-cell lymphoma.",

      "abstract": "ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Shrub kava has long been grown and utilized, primarily in the South Pacific region, for ceremonial, religious, and social occasions. It has been used as a pain reliever and muscle relaxant in medicinal practices from the eighteenth century. Interestingly, relatively low incidence of lung cancer may attribute to the high consumption of kava products in this region. AIM OF THE STUDY: Kava extracts were used to produce the kava chalcones Flavokawain A, B and C, which have a variety of bioactivities. In the present study, we show that Flavokawain A has positive effects on endometriosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The endometriosis rat model was surgically induced by the autologous transplantation of endometrial tissue. Rats were evaluated for clinical ratings and lesion volume following a 6-week Flavokawain A therapy. Peritoneal fluid and blood samples were taken and ELISA assay was used to measure the cytokines and chemokines levels. Transcriptional and expression levels of Akt, PI3K, NF-kB, iNOS, Bcl-2, Bax and caspase-3 were evaluated by Western blotting and RT-qPCR. Implanted tissue sections of the rats were also analyzed by immunofluorescent and histopathological staining. RESULTS: Lesion volumes and adhesion scores were successfully decreased. Blood and peritoneal fluid levels of associated cytokines and chemokines were markedly down-regulated. Besides, Flavokawain A also mediated cell apoptosis of endometrial implants. Additionally, VEGF expression was reduced, which inhibited the angiogenesis process. As for the expression of Akt, p-Akt, PI3K, p-PI3K, and NF-kB in endometriosis lesions, Flavokawain A significantly reduced them. CONCLUSION: Flavokawain A has beneficial effects on the surgically induced endometriosis rat model, by reducing inflammation, promoting apoptosis, and decreasing angiogenesis. Our findings suggest that these effects may be mediated through the regulation of PI3K/Akt and NF-κB signaling pathways.",

Prevention therefore is critical to help improve lung cancer management. Although tobacco control and tobacco cessation are effective strategies for lung cancer prevention, the numbers of current and former smokers in the USA and globally are not expected to decrease significantly in the near future. Chemoprevention and interception are needed to help high-risk individuals reduce their lung cancer risk or delay lung cancer development. This article will review the epidemiological data, pre-clinical animal data, and limited clinical data that support the potential of kava in reducing human lung cancer risk via its holistic polypharmacological effects.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Tobacco use is the leading cause of many preventable diseases, resulting in premature death or disease. Given that the majority of adult who smoke want to stop, this health burden could be significantly reduced if the success rate of tobacco cessation can be improved. In addition, most adults planning to quit were interested in trying complementary approaches to facilitating tobacco cessation, which is currently lacking. Therefore, there is an unmet and urgent need for novel interventions to improve the success of tobacco cessation. If such an intervention can reduce tobacco-associated lung carcinogenesis, that will be more desirable. The goal of this project is to develop a safe and effective kava-based intervention to enable tobacco cessation and reduce lung cancer risk, which will improve the health of smokers. METHODS: A randomized controlled trial will enroll 80 adults who currently smoke at least 10 cigarettes daily and randomize 1:1 into the placebo and AB-free kava arms, being exposed for 4 weeks, with a total of six visits (weeks 0, 1, 2, 4, 8, and 12) to evaluate the compliance and potential issues of AB-free kava use among the participants, explore the potential effect of the AB-free kava intervention on tobacco dependence, tobacco use, and lung carcinogenesis biomarkers. Participants will be enrolled during their primary care clinic visit. DISCUSSION: Primary care settings play a critical role in tobacco-related disease screening, counseling, and early intervention, as the majority of adults who smoke visit their physicians annually. Building upon our promising pilot human trial results in conjunction with ample compelling lab animal results, and consistent with evidence of kava's benefits from epidemiological data, this trial will evaluate the compliance of AB-free kava among adults who currently smoke with no intention to quit. The other exploratory aims include (1) whether AB-free kava intervention can reduce tobacco use and tobacco dependence; (2) whether AB-free kava use suppresses tobacco-induced carcinogenesis; and (3) the potential of the mechanism-based noninvasive biomarkers in precision AB-free kava intervention. The positive results from this study are expected to provide a great opportunity to effectively reduce smoking rates and tobacco-related diseases.

      "abstract": "Background: Piper methysticum, commonly called kava, has long been consumed in beverage form in the Pacific Islands. Kava use in the US has slowly increased since the 1990s, but is not assessed in major epidemiological surveys.Objectives: To analyze social-media posts about kava from current, past, and prospective users, for motivations, patterns of co-use, and effects.Methods: Text from Reddit posts, and accompanying metadata, were collected and thematically coded by two independent raters.Results: 423 posts were collected, spanning January 2006 through December 2021. Of the 1,211 thematic codes applied, 1,098 (90. 7%) were concordant. Motivations for use bifurcated into self-treatment (for psychiatric or physical health conditions) and recreation; these were not mutually exclusive. Kava was rarely considered strongly euphoriant, but was valued as an anxiolytic. Kava was frequently used with other substances, most commonly kratom. Kava was used at lower doses for self-treatment than for other purposes (pseudo-R2 = 0.11). Undesirable effects (gastrointestinal upset, fatigue) were mentioned, though less often than benefits. Hepatotoxicity, reported elsewhere as a rare, non-dose-related risk, was disputed on the basis of its not having been experienced by those posting.Conclusion: Kava appears to be conceptualized among Reddit posters as an anxiolytic with few risks or adverse effects. As it grows in popularity, especially among people who use other drugs that are more liable to misuse or addiction, it should be assessed in probability samples (i.e. in the major national drug surveys) and clinical practice for its risks, potential benefits, and possible drug-drug interactions.",

Furthermore, the in vitro inhibitory profile of Kava extract on MAO-B activity of mouse brain was evaluated. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE: Mice were treated with Kava extract (10, 40, 100 and 400 mg/kg) for 21 days by gavage. After behavioral analysis (plus maze test and open field), MAO activity in different mouse brain structures (cortex, hippocampus, region containing the substantia nigra and striatum) were performed. MAO-B inhibitory profile was characterized in vitro. RESULTS: The treatment with Kava extract (40 mg/kg) increased the percentage of entries of mice into the open arms. Ex vivo analysis showed an inhibition on MAO-B activity caused by Kava extract in cortex (10 mg/kg) and in the region containing the substantia nigra (10 and 100 mg/kg). In vitro, Kava extract also reversibly inhibited MAO-B activity with IC50 = 14.62 μg/mL and, increased Km values at the concentrations of 10 and 30 μg/mL and decreased Vmax value at 100 μg/mL. CONCLUSION: Kava extract showed different effects on MAO-B isoform depending on the brain structure evaluated. Therefore, the use of Kava extract could be promissory in pathologies where MAO-B is the pharmacological target."

      "abstract": "AIM: Prior to the kava ban of 2002, the indication for kava (Piper methysticum) extracts defined by the German Commission E was \"nervous anxiety, tension and restlessness\". In 2000, an observational trial was started in Germany with the aim of defining symptoms of these indications best treated with kava extract. The trial was interrupted and archived \"unevaluated\" in 2001 due to the upcoming safety debate on kava. The data from this study has now been analyzed in order to identify symptoms best treated with kava. METHODS: Documentation was available from 156 patients. Twelve typical symptoms of nervous anxiety, tension and restlessness were assessed on a five-item rating scale, together with the therapeutic context, the perceived time of onset of effects and the safety of application. RESULTS: The median duration of treatment was 28 days. All individual symptoms showed significant and clinically relevant improvements. The most effective results were seen for nervous tension and restlessness, with better effects in patients with acute versus chronic complaints. The safety of the treatment was found to be excellent, which included the assessment of laboratory data. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the study confirms the effective and safe short-term use of kava in the Commission E-defined indication of \"nervous anxiety, tension and restlessness\", especially in other than chronic cases. The clinical use of kava might be translated into context-related phobias according to ICD-10 F40, or to nervous tension (ICD10 R45.0) or restlessness and excitation (ICD-10 R45.1).",

Active compounds of Kava have previously been demonstrated to exert an antiproliferative effect through cell cycle arrest and promotion of apoptosis. Our aim was to investigate the in vitro effects of the main constituents derived from Kava on oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) activity. Gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GCMS) was used to characterise the main constituents of two Kava preparations. Cell proliferation was assessed in two human OSCC cell lines (H400 and BICR56) and in normal oral keratinocytes (OKF6) treated with the identified Kava constituents, namely Flavokawain A (FKA), Flavokawain B (FKB), yangonin, kavain and methysticin using an MTS in vitro assay. Cell migration at 16 h was assessed using a Transwell migration assay. Cell invasion was measured at 22 h using a Matrigel assay. Cell adhesion was assessed at 90 min with a Cytoselect Adhesion assay. The two Kava preparations contained substantially different concentrations of the main chemical constituents. Treatment of malignant and normal oral keratinocyte cell lines with three of the identified constituents, 10 μg/ml FKA, 2.5 μg/ml FKB and 10 μg/ml yangonin, showed a significant reduction in cell proliferation in both H400 and BICR56 cancer cell lines but not in normal OKF6 cells. Remarkably, the same Kava constituents induced a significant reduction of OSCC cell migration and invasion. We have demonstrated, for the first time, that Kava constituents, FKA, FKB and yangonin have potential anticancer effects on OSCC. This highlights an avenue for further research of Kava constituents in the development of future cancer therapies to prevent and treat OSCC.",

Although the reported effects of Kava drinking improving psychotic symptoms of patients when it was introduced to relieve anxiety in aboriginal communities, its effects on models of psychosis-like symptoms are not investigated. AIM OF THE STUDY: To investigate the effects of Kava extract on behavioral changes induced by amphetamine (AMPH) and its possible relation with alterations in monoamine oxidase (MAO) activity. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Mice received vehicle or Kava extract by gavage and, 2 h after vehicle or AMPH intraperitoneally. Twenty-five minutes after AMPH administration, behavioral (elevated plus maze, open field, stereotyped behavior, social interaction and Y maze) and biochemical tests (MAO-A and MAO-B activity in cortex, hippocampus and striatum) were sequentially evaluated. RESULTS: Kava extract exhibited anxiolytic effects in plus maze test, increased the locomotor activity of mice in open field test and decreased MAO-A (in cortex) and MAO-B (in hippocampus) activity of mice. Kava extract prevented the effects of AMPH on stereotyped behavior and, the association between Kava/AMPH increased the number of entries into arms in Y maze test as well as MAO-B activity in striatum. However, Kava extract did not prevent hyperlocomotion induced by AMPH in open field test. The social interaction was not modified by Kava extract and/or AMPH. CONCLUSION: The results showed that Kava extract decreased the stereotyped behavior induced by AMPH at the same dose that promotes anxiolytic effects, which could be useful to minimize the psychotic symptoms in patients.",

The potency of each extract was compared in terms of the intensity of seizure scores and onset time after pre-treating the zebrafish before the PTZ challenge. The results indicate that aqueous extract of Kava stems without peel after 45 min of pre-treatment exhibited anti-convulsive potential at the dose of 50 mg/L.

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: Oral mucositis is a debilitating inflammatory disorder observed in patients undergoing active cancer treatment, particularly cancer of the head and neck region. A key pathway believed to be involved in the pathogenesis of oral mucositis is the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). The identification of compounds that can inhibit this pathway may therefore be of benefit in treating this disorder. The kava plant (Piper methysticum) contains various constituents, including flavokawain A (FKA), flavokawain B (FKB), yangonin, methysticin and kavain. These constituents are known to be biologically active and possess anti-oxidative properties. This study therefore focused on examining these constituents for their effect on ROS formation in an in vitro oral mucositis model. METHODS: Cell proliferation was assessed in normal oral keratinocytes (OKF6) treated with and without kava constituents, namely FKA, FKB, yangonin, methysticin and kavain using an MTS in vitro assay. Oxidative stress was assessed by co-treating and pre-treating OKF6 cells with H2O2. The effects were quantified by analysis of ROS production, using a CM-H2DCFDA assay. RESULTS: Pre-treatment of cells for 24 h with 2.5 μg/ml kavain and 5 μg/ml FKA demonstrated a significant protective anti-oxidative effect. Similarly, FKB at a concentration of 2.5 μg/ml, demonstrated a trend of ROS reduction but was observed to be cytotoxic at concentrations greater than 5 μg/ml. Reduction in ROS production by methysticin and yangonin was compromised by their cell cytotoxicity. CONCLUSION: This was the first study to identify the anti-oxidative effects and safety of FKA and kavain with regard to oral keratinocytes, highlighting their potential use in the development of a preventative treatment for oral mucositis.",

First, we examined the impact of DHM on human colon cancer cell lines, which demonstrated that DHM inhibits proliferation, migration, and invasion and promotes apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in colon cancer cells in vitro. Using small hairpin RNA, we inhibited nucleotide-oligomerization domain-like receptor subfamily C3 (NLRC3)/phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway to elucidate the partial signaling of DHM-mediated tumor suppression. Additionally, using an ectopic human CRC model, we verified whether DHM inhibits tumor growth and angiogenesis via the NLRC3/PI3K pathway in vivo. Overall, DHM showed an inhibitory effect on CRC by altering cell proliferation, migration, invasion, apoptosis, cell cycle, and angiogenesis, possibly via the NLRC3/PI3K pathway. Thus, DHM may be a promising candidate for CRC therapy.",

The objective of this randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was to perform a larger, longer-term trial assessing the efficacy and safety of Kava in the treatment of generalised anxiety disorder and to determine whether gamma-aminobutyric acid transporter (SLC6A1) single-nucleotide polymorphisms were moderators of response. METHODS: The trial was a phase III, multi-site, two-arm, 16-week, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study investigating an aqueous extract of dried Kava root administered twice per day in tablet form (standardised to 120 mg of kavalactones twice/day) in 171 currently non-medicated anxious participants with diagnosed generalised anxiety disorder. The trial took place in Australia. RESULTS: An analysis of 171 participants revealed a non-significant difference in anxiety reduction between the Kava and placebo groups (a relative reduction favouring placebo of 1.37 points; p = 0.25). At the conclusion of the controlled phase, 17.4% of the Kava group were classified as remitted (Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale score < 7) compared to 23.8% of the placebo group (p = 0.46). No SLC6A1 polymorphisms were associated with treatment response, while carriers of the rs2601126 T allele preferentially respond to placebo (p = 0.006). Kava was well tolerated aside from poorer memory (Kava = 36 vs placebo = 23; p = 0.044) and tremor/shakiness (Kava = 36 vs placebo = 23; p = 0.024) occurring more frequently in the Kava group. Liver function test abnormalities were significantly more frequent in the Kava group, although no participant met criteria for herb-induced hepatic injury. CONCLUSION: While research has generally supported Kava in non-clinical populations (potentially for more 'situational' anxiety as a short-term anxiolytic), this particular extract was not effective for diagnosed generalised anxiety disorder.",

This study examined the MAO inhibition potential of kavain and other kavalactones from the roots of kava (Piper methysticum), a plant that has been used for its anxiolytic properties. (±)-Kavain was found to be a good potency in vitro inhibitor of human MAO-B with an IC50 of 5.34 µM. (±)-Kavain is a weaker MAO-A inhibitor with an IC50 of 19.0 µM. Under the same experimental conditions, the reference MAO inhibitor, curcumin, displays IC50 values of 5.01 µM and 2.55 µM for the inhibition of MAO-A and MAO-B, respectively. It was further established that (±)-kavain interacts reversibly and competitively with MAO-A and MAO-B with enzyme-inhibitor dissociation constants (Ki) of 7.72 and 5.10 µM, respectively. Curcumin in turn, displays a Ki value of 3.08 µM for the inhibition of MAO-A. Based on these findings, other kavalactones (dihydrokavain, methysticin, dihydromethysticin, yangonin, and desmethoxyyangonin) were also evaluated as MAO inhibitors in this study. Yangonin proved to be the most potent MAO inhibitor with IC50 values of 1.29 and 0.085 µM for MAO-A and MAO-B, respectively. It may be concluded that some of the central effects (e.g., anxiolytic) of kava may be mediated by MAO inhibition.",

Active compounds were extracted from kava, and secondary metabolites include kavalactones, chalcones, cinnamic acid derivatives and flavanones. It is thought that components of kava may exert an antiproliferative effect through cell cycle arrest and promotion of apoptosis. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review to summarize available evidence of the anticancer effects of kava components and investigate their potential use for oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) treatment. Eligible studies were identified through a comprehensive search of OVID EMBASE, OVID MEDLINE and Web of Science, as at April 2018. RESULTS: Of 39 papers that met the inclusion criteria, 32 included in vitro models and 13 included animal studies. A total of 26 different cancers were assessed with 32 studies solely assessing epithelial cancers, 6 mesenchymal cancers and 1 study including both. There was only one report assessing an OSCC cell line. Antiproliferative properties were demonstrated in 32 out of 39 papers. The most researched constituent of kava was flavokavain B followed by flavokavain A. Both were associated with increased expression of pro-apoptotic proteins and decreased expression of anti-apoptotic proteins. Further, they were associated with a dose-dependent reduction of angiogenesis. CONCLUSION: There was heterogeneity of study models and methods of investigation across the studies identified. Components of kava appear to present an area of interest with chemotherapeutic potential in cancer prevention and treatment, particularly for epithelial neoplasms. To date, there is a paucity of literature of the utility of kava components in the prevention and treatment of oral squamous cell carcinoma.",

METHODS: Databases PubMed, CINAHL, and PsycINFO were utilized to obtain clinical trials on Kava Kava and its effects on anxiety. A total of 11 articles met inclusion/exclusion criteria: 2 for Kava Kava vs. another anti-anxiety medication, 2 detailing additional adverse events, and 7 for Kava Kava vs. placebo. Mantel-Haenszel fixed-effects model was used to analyze the data, with responder rates being pooled to compute weighted risk ratios. RESULTS: Kava Kava was shown to be more effective than placebo in 3 of the 7 trials. A final risk ratio of 1.50 (95% CI: 1.12, 2.01) from responder rates was calculated in favor of the intervention from 5 clinical trials (n = 330). Adverse events were shown to be the same as placebo (P = 0.574), and laboratory values analyzing hepatotoxicity were no different when compared to baseline except in two studies. CONCLUSIONS: Kava Kava appears to be a short-term treatment for anxiety, but not a replacement for prolonged anti-anxiety use. Although not witnessed in this review, liver toxicity is especially possible if taken longer than 8 weeks.",

Identification of new anti-inflammatory compounds to treat arthritis is needed. We had previously demonstrated the beneficial effect of Kava-241, a kavain-derived compound, in the management of Porphyromonas gingivalis-induced periodontitis. The present study evaluated systemic and articular effects of Kava-241 in an infective arthritis murine model triggered by P. gingivalis bacterial inoculation and primed with a collagen antibody cocktail (CIA) to induce joint inflammation and tissular destruction. Clinical inflammation score and radiological analyses of the paws were performed continuously, while histological assessment was obtained at sacrifice. Mice exposed to P. gingivalis and a CIA cocktail and treated concomitantly with Kava-241 exhibited a reduced clinical inflammatory score and a decreased number of inflammatory cells and osteoclasts within joint. Kava-241 treatment also decreased significantly tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) in serum from mice injected with a Toll-like receptor 2 or 4 (TLR-2/4) ligand, P. gingivalis-lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Finally, bone marrow-derived macrophages infected with P. gingivalis and exposed to Kava-241 displayed reduced TLR-2/4, reduced mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-related signal elements, and reduced LPS-induced TNF-α factor (LITAF), all explaining the observed reduction of TNF-α secretion. Taken together, these results emphasized the novel properties of Kava-241 in the management of inflammatory conditions, especially TNF-α-related diseases such as infective RA.",

Clinical trials usually lasting for 4 weeks found generally good tolerability and safety; however, dermatologic, hepatologic, and cognitive adverse effects may occur. Some of these adverse effects are known to occur from the kavapyrones themselves, while others can be caused or exacerbated by use of substandard kava products.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is a chronic and debilitating condition characterized by persistent and overpowering anxiety. Treatment of GAD with antidepressants and benzodiazepines is only moderately effective and not free from side effects. Kava (Piper methysticum) has been explored as a potential phytotherapeutic option for GAD. OBJECTIVES: To perform a systematic review and meta-analysis of the available evidence on Kava as a treatment for GAD. METHODS: Systematic search of English-language publications from major databases for clinical trials reporting the effects of Kava for the treatment of GAD. RESULTS: Twelve articles were included in this review. Evidence supporting Kava as an effective treatment for GAD was found in two placebo-controlled trials and a reference-controlled trial. One negative trial demonstrated that Kava was not more effective than placebo. Meta-analyses of the results of three placebo-controlled trials (n = 130) favored Kava for GAD treatment with effect sizes between 0.59 and 0.99 (standard mean difference) without reaching statistical significance. Kava is an appealing treatment option to GAD patients who are more attune to natural remedies or lifestyle approaches to reduce stress. Positive patient experiences and improvement of vagal cardiac control due to Kava treatment were also reported in the literature. Kava is safe and well tolerated for short-term (4-8 weeks) therapeutic use at a dosage of 120-280 mg per day of Kavalactones, regardless of dosage schedule. CONCLUSIONS: Current evidence, although promising, is insufficient to confirm the effect of Kava for GAD treatment beyond placebo. New evidence is expected from a large, multisite ongoing trial.",

The purpose of the current study is to evaluate the hepatoprotective effect of yangonin, a product isolated from an edible botanical Kava against lithocholic acid (LCA)-induced cholestasis, and further to elucidate the involvement of farnesoid X receptor (FXR) in the anticholestatic effect using in vivo and in vitro experiments. The cholestatic liver injury model was established by intraperitoneal injections of LCA in C57BL/6 mice. Serum biomarkers and H&E staining were used to identify the amelioration of cholestasis after yangonin treatment. Mice hepatocytes culture, gene silencing experiment, real-time PCR and Western blot assay were used to elucidate the mechanisms underlying yangonin hepatoprotection. The results indicated that yangonin promoted bile acid efflux and reduced hepatic uptake via an induction in FXR-target genes Bsep, Mrp2 expression and an inhibition in Ntcp, all of which are responsible for bile acid transport. Furthermore, yangonin reduced bile acid synthesis through repressing FXR-target genes Cyp7a1 and Cyp8b1, and increased bile acid metabolism through an induction in gene expression of Sult2a1, which are involved in bile acid synthesis and metabolism. In addition, yangonin suppressed liver inflammation through repressing inflammation-related gene NF-κB, TNF-α and IL-1β. In vitro evidences showed that the changes in transporters and enzymes induced by yangonin were abrogated when FXR was silenced. In conclusions, yangonin produces protective effect against LCA-induced hepatotoxity and cholestasis due to FXR-mediated regulation. Yangonin may be an effective approach for the prevention against cholestatic liver diseases.",

METHODS: Experimental periodontitis was induced by oral gavage of Porphyromonas gingivalis (P. gingivalis) + type II collagen antibody (AB) in mice during 15 days. Mice were treated with Kava-241 concomitantly or prior to P. gingivalis gavage and compared to untreated mice. Comprehensive histomorphometric analyses were performed. RESULTS: Oral gavage with P. gingivalis induced mild epithelial down-growth and alveolar bone loss, while oral gavage with additional AB priming had greater tissular destruction in comparison with gavage alone (p < .05). Kava-241 treatment significantly (p < .05) reduced epithelial down-growth (72%) and alveolar bone loss (36%) in P. gingivalis+AB group. This Kava-241 effect was associated to a reduction in inflammatory cell counts within soft tissues and an increase in fibroblasts (p < .05). CONCLUSION: Priming with type II collagen antibody with oral gavage is a fast and reproducible model of periodontal destruction adequate for the evaluation of novel therapeutics. The effect of Kava-241 shows promise in the prevention and treatment of inflammation and alveolar bone loss associated with periodontitis. Further experiments are required to determine molecular pathways targeted by this therapeutic agent.",

We have shown that Flavokawain A (FKA) preferentially reduces the viabilities of HER2-overexpressing breast cancer cell lines (i.e., SKBR3 and MCF7/HER2) versus those with less HER2 expression (i.e., MCF7 and MDA-MB-468). FKA at cytotoxic concentrations to breast cancer cell lines also has a minimal effect on the growth of non-malignant breast epithelial MCF10A cells. FKA induces G2M arrest in cell cycle progression of HER2-overexpressing breast cancer cell lines through inhibition of Cdc2 and Cdc25C phosphorylation and downregulation of expression of Myt1 and Wee1 leading to increased Cdc2 kinase activities. In addition, FKA induces apoptosis in SKBR3 cells by increasing the protein expression of Bim and BAX and decreasing expression of Bcl₂, BclX/L, XIAP, and survivin. FKA also downregulates the protein expression of HER-2 and inhibits AKT phosphorylation. Herceptin plus FKA treatment leads to an enhanced growth inhibitory effect on HER-2 overexpressing breast cancer cell lines through downregulation of Myt1, Wee1, Skp2, survivin, and XIAP. Our results suggest FKA as a promising and novel apoptosis inducer and G2 blocking agent that, in combination with Herceptin, enhances for the treatment of HER2-overexpressing breast cancer.",

They have been used for more than 1000 years in social gatherings for the preparation of beverages with relaxing effects. During the colonial period, extract preparations found their way into Western medicinal systems, with experience especially concerning the treatment of situational anxiety dating back more than 100 years. It therefore came as a surprise when the safety of kava was suddenly questioned based on the observation of a series of case reports of liver toxicity in 1999 and 2000. These case reports ultimately led to a ban of kava products in Europe - a ban that has been contested because of the poor evidence of risks related to kava. Only recently, two German administrative courts decided that the decision of the regulatory authority to ban kava as a measure to ensure consumer safety was inappropriate and even associated with an increased risk due to the higher risk inherent to the therapeutic alternatives. This ruling can be considered as final for at least the German market, as no further appeal has been pursued by the regulatory authorities. However, in order to prevent further misunderstandings, especially in other markets, the current situation calls for a comprehensive presentation of the cardinal facts and misconceptions concerning kava and related drug quality issues.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Generalised anxiety disorder (GAD) is a chronic and pervasive condition that generates high levels of psychological stress, and it is difficult to treat in the long term. Current pharmacotherapeutic options for GAD are in some cases only modestly effective, and may elicit undesirable side effects. Through targeted actions on the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) pathway, the South Pacific medicinal plant kava (Piper methysticum) is a non-addictive, non-hypnotic anxiolytic with the potential to treat GAD. The evidence for the efficacy of kava for treating anxiety has been affirmed through clinical trials and meta-analyses. Recent research has also served to lessen safety concerns regarding the use of kava due to hepatotoxic risk, which is reflected in a recent German court overturning the previous kava ban in that country (which may in turn influence a reinstatement by the European Union). The aim of current research is to assess the efficacy of an 'aqueous noble cultivar rootstock extract' of kava in GAD in a larger longer term study. In addition, we plan to investigate the pharmacogenomic influence of GABA transporters on response, effects of kava on gene expression, and for the first time, the neurobiological correlates of treatment response via functional and metabolic imaging. METHODS/DESIGN: This clinical trial is funded by the Australian National Health and Medical Research Council (APP1063383) and co-funded by MediHerb (Integria Healthcare (Australia) Pty. Ltd). The study is a phase III, multi-site, two-arm, 18-week, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study using an aqueous extract of noble kava cultivar (standardised to 240 mg of kavalactones per day) versus matching placebo in 210 currently anxious participants with diagnosed GAD who are non-medicated. The study takes place at two sites: the Centre for Human Psychopharmacology (Swinburne University of Technology), Hawthorn, Melbourne, Australia; and the Academic Discipline of Psychiatry (The University of Queensland) based at the Royal Brisbane and Women's Hospital, Herston, Brisbane, Australia. Written informed consent will be obtained from each participant prior to commencement in the study. The primary outcome is the Structured Interview Guide for the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (SIGH-A). The secondary outcomes involve a range of scales that assess affective disorder symptoms and quality of life outcomes, in addition to the study of mediating biomarkers of response (assessed via genomics and neuroimaging). DISCUSSION: If this study demonstrates positive findings in support of the superiority of kava over placebo in the treatment of GAD, and also is shown to be safe, then this plant-medicine can be considered a 'first-line' therapy for GAD.

      "abstract": "The long term use of antiepileptic drugs possesses many unwanted effects; thus, new safe combinations are urgently mandated. Hence, the present study aimed to investigate the anticonvulsant effect of kava alone or in combination with a synthetic anticonvulsant drug, diazepam (DZ). To this end, female Wistar rats were divided into two subsets, each comprising 6 groups as follows: group (i) received 1% Tween 80 p.o. and served as control, while groups (ii) and (iii) received kava at two dose levels (100 and 200 mg/kg, p.o.). The remaining three groups received (iv) DZ alone (10 mg/kg p.o.) or kava in combination with DZ (v) (5 mg/kg, p.o.) or (vi) (10 mg/kg, p.o.). Results of the present study revealed that kava increased the maximal electroshock seizure threshold (MEST) and enhanced the anticonvulsant effect of diazepam following both acute and chronic treatment. Moreover, neither kava nor its combination with DZ impaired motor co-ordination either acutely or chronically. Furthermore, kava ameliorated both the reduction in locomotor activity as well as changes in liver function tests induced by chronic administration of DZ. Moreover, no elevation was shown in the creatinine concentration vs. control group following chronic administration of kava or DZ either alone or in combination with kava. In conclusion, the present study suggests the possibility of combining a low dose DZ with kava to reduce harmful effects and might be recommended for clinical use in patients chronically treated with this synthetic anticonvulsant drug."

In this study, we investigated the tumorigenesis-stage specificity of kava, the potential active compounds, and the underlying mechanisms in NNK-induced lung tumorigenesis in A/J mice. In the first experiment, NNK-treated mice were given diets containing kava at a dose of 5 mg/g of diet during different periods. Kava treatments covering the initiation stage reduced the multiplicity of lung adenomas by approximately 99%. A minimum effective dose is yet to be defined because kava at two lower dosages (2.5 and 1.25 mg/g of diet) were equally effective as 5 mg/g of diet in completely inhibiting lung adenoma formation. Daily gavage of kava (one before, during, and after NNK treatment) completely blocked lung adenoma formation as well. Kavalactone-enriched fraction B fully recapitulated kava's chemopreventive efficacy, whereas kavalactone-free fractions A and C were much less effective. Mechanistically, kava and fraction B reduced NNK-induced DNA damage in lung tissues with a unique and preferential reduction in O(6)-methylguanine (O(6)-mG), the highly tumorigenic DNA damage by NNK, correlating and predictive of efficacy on blocking lung adenoma formation. Taken together, these results demonstrate the outstanding efficacy of kava in preventing NNK-induced lung tumorigenesis in A/J mice with high selectivity for the initiation stage in association with the reduction of O(6)-mG adduct in DNA. They also establish the knowledge basis for the identification of the active compound(s) in kava.",

      "abstract": "Flavokawain A (FKA) is the predominant chalcone identified from the kava plant. We have previously shown that FKA preferentially inhibits the growth of p53 defective bladder cancer cell lines. Here, we examined whether FKA could inhibit bladder cancer development and progression in vivo in the UPII-SV40T transgenic model that resembles human urothelial cell carcinoma (UCC) with defects in the p53 and the retinoblastoma (Rb) protein pathways. Genotyped UPII-SV40T mice were fed orally with vehicle control (AIN-93M) or FKA (6 g/kg food; 0.6%) for 318 days starting at 28 days of age. More than 64% of the male mice fed with FKA-containing food survived beyond 318 days of age, whereas only about 38% of the male mice fed with vehicle control food survived to that age (P = 0.0383). The mean bladder weights of surviving male transgenic mice with the control diet versus the FKA diet were 234.6 ± 72.5 versus 96.1 ± 69.4 mg (P = 0.0002). FKA was excreted primarily through the urinary tract and concentrated in the urine up to 8.4 μmol/L, averaging about 38 times (males) and 15 times (females) more concentrated than in the plasma (P = 0.0001). FKA treatment inhibited the occurrence of high-grade papillary UCC, a precursor to invasive urothelial cancer, by 42.1%. A decreased expression of Ki67, survivin, and X-linked inhibitor of apoptotic proteins (XIAP) and increased expression of p27 and DR5, and the number of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL)-positive apoptotic cells were observed in the urothelial tissue of FKA-fed mice. These results suggest a potential of FKA in preventing the recurrence and progression of non-muscle-invasive UCC.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Osteosarcoma (OS) is the most common primary bone malignancy with a high propensity for local invasion and distant metastasis. Limited by the severe toxicity of conventional agents, the therapeutic bottleneck of osteosarcoma still remains unconquered. Flavokawain B (FKB), a kava extract, has been reported to have significant anti-tumor effects on several carcinoma cell lines both in vitro and in vivo. Its efficacy and low toxicity profile make FKB a promising agent for use as a novel chemotherapeutic agent. RESULTS: In the current study, we investigated the anti-proliferative and apoptotic effects of FKB against human osteosarcomas. Exposure of OS cells to FKB resulted in apoptosis, evidenced by loss of cell viability, morphological changes and the externalization of phosphatidylserine. Apoptosis induced by FKB resulted in activation of Caspase-3/7, -8 and -9 in OS cell lines, 143B and Saos-2. FKB also down-regulated inhibitory apoptotic markers, including Bcl-2 and Survivin and led to concomitant increases in apoptotic proteins, Bax, Puma and Fas. Therefore, the induction of apoptosis by FKB involved both extrinsic and intrinsic pathways. FKB also caused G2/M phase cell cycle arrest, which was observed through reductions in the levels of cyclin B1, cdc2 and cdc25c and increases in Myt1 levels. Furthermore, migration and invasion ability was decreased by FKB in a dose-dependent manner. The cytotoxicity profile showed FKB had significant lower side effects on bone marrow cells and small intestinal epithelial cells compared with Adriamycin. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, our evidence of apoptosis and cell cycle arrest by FKB treatment with less toxicity than the standard treatments provides an innovative argument for the use of FKB as a chemotherapeutic and chemopreventive compound. In vivo experiments utilizing FKB to reduce tumorigenesis and metastatic potential will be crucial to further justify clinical application.",

      "abstract": "Kava (Piper methysticum) is a plant-based medicine, which has been previously shown to reduce anxiety. To date, however, no placebo-controlled trial assessing kava in the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) has been completed. A total of 75 participants with GAD and no comorbid mood disorder were enrolled in a 6-week double-blind trial of an aqueous extract of kava (120/240 mg of kavalactones per day depending on response) versus placebo. γ-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) and noradrenaline transporter polymorphisms were also analyzed as potential pharmacogenetic markers of response. Reduction in anxiety was measured using the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAMA) as the primary outcome. Intention-to-treat analysis was performed on 58 participants who met inclusion criteria after an initial 1 week placebo run-in phase. Results revealed a significant reduction in anxiety for the kava group compared with the placebo group with a moderate effect size (P = 0.046, Cohen d = 0.62). Among participants with moderate to severe Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-diagnosed GAD, this effect was larger (P = 0.02; d = 0.82). At conclusion of the controlled phase, 26% of the kava group were classified as remitted (HAMA ≤ 7) compared with 6% of the placebo group (P = 0.04). Within the kava group, GABA transporter polymorphisms rs2601126 (P = 0.021) and rs2697153 (P = 0.046) were associated with HAMA reduction. Kava was well tolerated, and aside from more headaches reported in the kava group (P = 0.05), no other significant differences between groups occurred for any other adverse effects, nor for liver function tests. Standardized kava may be a moderately effective short-term option for the treatment of GAD. Furthermore, specific GABA transporter polymorphisms appear to potentially modify anxiolytic response to kava.",

Results showed no significant differences across groups for liver function tests, nor were there any significant adverse reactions that could be attributed to kava. No differences in withdrawal or addiction were found between groups. Interesting, kava significantly increased female's sexual drive compared to placebo (p = 0.040) on a sub-domain of the Arizona Sexual Experience Scale (ASEX), with no negative effects seen in males. Further, it was found that there was a highly significant correlation between ASEX reduction (improved sexual function and performance) and anxiety reduction in the whole sample.",

      "abstract": "OVERVIEW: Increasing concerns over the potentially impairing effects of prescriptive sedative drugs such as benzodiazepines on driving have been raised. However, other alternatives such as natural medicines may also carry similar risks with respect to driving safety. Kava (Piper methysticum) is a psychotropic plant commonly used both recreationally and medicinally in the United States, Australia, and the South Pacific to elicit a physically tranquilizing effect. To date no controlled study has tested a medicinal dose of kava versus placebo and a standard sedative drug on driving ability and driving safety. OBJECTIVE: Due to the need to establish the safety of kava in operating a motor vehicle, we compared the acute effects of the plant extract versus the benzodiazepine oxazepam and placebo using a driving simulator. METHODS: A driving simulator (AusEd) was used by 22 adults aged between 18 and 65 years after being randomly administered an acute medicinal dose of kava (180 mg of kavalactones), oxazepam (30 mg), or placebo one week apart in a crossover design trial. RESULTS: No impairing effects on driving outcomes were found after kava administration compared to placebo. Results on specific driving outcome domains revealed that the oxazepam condition had significantly slower braking reaction time compared to the placebo condition (p =.002) and the kava condition (p =.003). The kava condition had significantly fewer lapses of concentration compared to the oxazepam condition (p =.033). No significant differences were found between conditions for steering deviation, speed deviation, and number of crashes. Results were not modified by driving experience. On the Bond-Lader visual analogue sub-scale of alertness, a significant Treatment × Time interaction (p =.032) was found, with a significant reduction over time for oxazepam decreasing alertness (p <.001), whereas no significant reduction was found in the kava or placebo conditions. CONCLUSION: The results indicate that a medicinal dose of kava containing 180 mg of kavalactones does not impair driving ability, whereas 30 mg of oxazepam shows some impairment. Research assessing larger recreational doses of kava on driving ability should now be conducted.",

We therefore examined the potential effects of kava root extracts and its active components (kavalactones and flavokawains) on PCa growth and androgen receptor (AR) expression. PCa cell lines (LNCaP, LAPC-4, 22Rv1, C4-2B, DU145 and PC-3) with different AR expression, and a transformed prostate myofibroblast cell line (WPMY-1), were treated with a commercial kava extract, kavalactones (kawain, 5'6'-dehydrokawain, yangonin, methysticin) and flavokawain B. Expression of AR and its target genes (PSA and TMPRSS2) was examined. Two novel patient-derived PCa xenograft models from high grade PCa specimens were established by implanting the specimens into nude mice and passing tumor pieces through subcutaneous injection in nude mice, and then treated with kava extract and flavokawain B to examine their effects on tumor growth, AR expression and serum PSA levels. The kava extract and flavokawain B effectively down-regulated the expression of both the full-length AR and AR splice variants. The kava extract and kavalactones accelerated AR protein degradation, while flavokawain B inhibited AR mRNA transcription via decreasing Sp1 expression and the binding of Sp1 to the AR promoter. The kava root extract and flavokawain B reduce tumor growth, AR expression in tumor tissues and levels of serum PSA in the patient-derived PCa xenograft models. These results suggest a potential usefulness of a safe kava product or its active components for prevention and treatment of advanced PCa by targeting AR.",

Although SS cell lines have moderate chemosensitivity to isofamide and doxorubicin therapy, the clinical prognosis is still poor. In this article, we showed that flavokawain B (FKB), a novel chalcone from kava extract, potently inhibits the growth of SS cell lines SYO-I and HS-SY-II through induction of apoptosis. Treatment with FKB increased caspase 8, 9, and 3/7 activity compared to vehicle-treated controls, indicating that both extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic pathways were activated. Furthermore, FKB treatment of both cell lines resulted in increased mRNA and protein expression of death receptor-5 and the mitochondrial pro-apoptotic proteins Bim and Puma, while down-regulating the expression of an inhibitor of apoptosis, survivin in a dose-dependent manner. Our results suggest the natural compound FKB has a pro-apoptotic effect on SS cell lines. FKB may be a new chemotherapeutic strategy for patients with SS and deserves further investigation as a potential agent in the treatment of this malignancy.",

      "abstract": "Kava is a plant traditionally used for making beverages in Pacific Basin countries and has been used for the treatment of nervous disorders in the United States. The pharmacological activity of kava is achieved through kavalactones in kava extract, which include kawain, 7,8-dihydrokawain, yangonin, 5,6-dehydrokawain, methysticin, and 7,8-dihydromethysticin. Recent studies have shown that kava extract induces hepatic CYP1A1 enzyme; however, the mechanisms of CYP1A1 induction have not been elucidated, and the kavalactones responsible for CYP1A1 induction have not yet been identified. Using a combination of biochemical assays and molecular docking tools, we determined the functions of kava extract and kavalactones and delineated the underlying mechanisms involved in CYP1A1 induction. The results showed that kava extract displayed a concentration-dependent effect on CYP1A1 induction. Among the six major kavalactones, methysticin triggered the most profound inducing effect on CYP1A1 followed by 7,8-dihydromethysticin. The other four kavalactones (yangonin, 5,6-dehydrokawain, kawain, and 7,8-dihydrokawain) did not show significant effects on CYP1A1. Consistent with the experimental results, in silico molecular docking studies based on the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR)-ligand binding domain homology model also revealed favorable binding to AhR for methysticin and 7,8-dihydromethysticin compared with the remaining kavalactones. Additionally, results from a luciferase gene reporter assay suggested that kava extract, methysticin, and 7,8-dihydromethysticin were able to activate the AhR signaling pathway. Moreover, kava extract-, methysticin-, and 7,8-dihydromethysticin-mediated CYP1A1 induction was blocked by an AhR antagonist and abolished in AhR-deficient cells. These findings suggest that kava extract induces the expression of CYP1A1 via an AhR-dependent mechanism and that methysticin and 7,8-dihydromethysticin contribute to CYP1A1 induction. The induction of CYP1A1 indicates a potential interaction between kava or kavalactones and CYP1A1-mediated chemical carcinogenesis.",

Kava became popular as an anti-anxiety treatment in Western countries in the late 1990s, but it was subsequently banned in many places due to adverse reports of liver toxicity. This paper focuses on the responses to the bans by scientists involved in kava research, contrasting their evidential culture with that employed by clinicians and regulatory officials. Cultural constructions and social negotiations of risk are shown to be context-specific, and are shaped by professional, disciplinary, and organizational factors, among others. Though the science of hepatotoxicity is uncertain enough to allow for multiple interpretations of the same data, the biomedical/clinical narrative about kava remains dominant. This case study explores the influence of these cultural, social, and political factors on the production of scientific knowledge and the assessment of benefit/risk posed by comestibles.",

In these studies F344/N rats and B6C3F1 mice were administered Kava Kava extract orally by gavage in corn oil for two weeks, thirteen weeks or two years. Results from prechronic studies administered Kava Kava at 0.125 to 2g/kg body weight revealed dose-related increases in liver weights and incidences of hepatocellular hypertrophy. In the chronic studies, there were dose-related increases in the incidences of hepatocellular hypertrophy in rats and mice administered Kava Kava for up to 1g/kg body weight. This was accompanied by significant increases in incidences of centrilobular fatty change. There was no treatment- related increase in carcinogenic activity in the livers of male or female rats in the chronic studies. Male mice showed a significant dose-related increase in the incidence of hepatoblastomas. In female mice, there was a significant increase in the combined incidence of hepatocellular adenoma and carcinoma in the low and mid dose groups but not in the high dose group. These findings were accompanied by several nonneoplastic hepatic lesions.",

      "abstract": "Lung cancer is the most deadly malignancy in the US. Chemoprevention is potentially a complementary approach to smoking cessation for lung cancer control. Recently, we reported that a commercially available form of kava extract significantly inhibits 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK) and benzo(a)pyrene (BaP)-induced lung tumorigenesis in A/J mice at a dose of 10 mg per gram diet. In the present study, we examined the dose-dependent lung tumor inhibitory activities of kava and investigated potential active constituent(s). Mice treated with carcinogen alone contained 12.1±5.8 lung adenomas per mouse 22 weeks after final carcinogen administration. Mice that were fed diets containing kava at dosages of 1.25, 2.5, 5, and 10 mg/g of diet had 8.4±3.5, 6.6±3.5, 4.3±2.4, and 3.8±2.3 lung adenomas per mouse, respectively. This corresponds to a reduction of 31%, 46%, 65% and 69% in tumor multiplicity, which were all statistically significant (p < 0.05). Analyses of lung adenoma tissues derived from kava-treated animals revealed that kava significantly inhibited adenoma cell proliferation while it had no detectable effect on cell death, indicating that kava primarily suppressed lung tumorigenesis in A/J mice via inhibition of cell proliferation. Flavokawains A, B, and C, three chalcone-based components from kava, demonstrated greatly reduced chemopreventive efficacies even at concentrations much higher than their natural abundance, suggesting that they alone were unlikely to be responsible for kava's chemopreventive activity. Kava at all dosages and treatment regimens did not induce detectable adverse effects, particularly with respect to liver. Specifically, kava treatment showed no effect on liver integrity indicator enzymes or liver weight, indicating that kava may be potentially safe for long-term chemopreventive application.",

      "abstract": "Kava hepatotoxicity is a well described disease entity, yet there is uncertainty as to the culprit(s). In particular, there is so far no clear evidence for a causative role of kavalactones and non-kavalactone constituents, such as pipermethystine and flavokavain B, identified from kava. Therefore, novel enzymatic, analytical, toxicological, ethnobotanical and clinical studies are now required. Studies should focus on the identification of further potential hepatotoxic constituents, considering in particular possible adulterants and impurities with special reference to ochratoxin A and aflatoxins (AFs) producing Aspergillus varieties, which should be urgently assessed and published. At present, Aspergillus and other fungus species producing hepatotoxic mycotoxins have not yet been examined thoroughly as possible contaminants of some kava raw materials. Its occurence may be facilitated by high humidity, poor methods for drying procedures and insufficient storage facilities during the time after harvest. Various experimental studies are recommended using aqueous, acetonic and ethanolic kava extracts derived from different plant parts, such as peeled rhizomes and peeled roots including their peelings, and considering both noble and non-noble kava cultivars. In addition, ethnobotanical studies associated with local expertise and surveillance are required to achieve a good quality of kava as the raw material. In clinical trials of patients with anxiety disorders seeking herbal anxiolytic treatment with kava extracts, long-term safety and efficacy should be tested using traditional aqueous extracts obtained from peeled rhizomes and peeled roots of a noble kava cultivar, such as Borogu, to evaluate the risk: benefit ratio. Concomitantly, more research should be conducted on the bioavailability of kavalactones and non-kavalactones derived from aqueous kava extracts. To be on the side of caution and to ensure lack of liver injury, kava consuming inhabitants of the kava producing or importing South Pacific islands should undergo assessment of their liver function values and serum aflatoxin levels. The primary aim is to achieve a good quality of kava raw material, without the risk of adulterants and impurities including ochratoxin A and AFs, which represent the sum of aflatoxin B1, B2, G1 and G2. Although it is known that kava may naturally be contaminated with AFs, there is at present no evidence that kava hepatotoxicity might be due to aflatoxicosis. However, appropriate studies have yet to be done and should be extended to other mould hepatotoxins, with the aim of publishing the obtained results. It is hoped that with the proposed qualifying measures, the safety of individuals consuming kava will substantially be improved.",

Kava herbal dietary supplements have been implicated in several human liver failure cases leading to the ban of kava-containing products in several Western countries. In the US, the FDA has issued warnings about the potential adverse effects of kava, but kava dietary supplements are still available to consumers. In this study, we tested the potential of kava extract to potentiate APAP-induced hepatocyte cytotoxicity. In rat primary hepatocytes, co-treatment with kava and APAP caused 100% loss of cell viability, while the treatment of kava or APAP alone caused ∼50% and ∼30% loss of cell viability, respectively. APAP-induced glutathione (GSH) depletion was also potentiated by kava. Co-exposure to kava decreased cellular ATP concentrations, increased the formation of reactive oxygen species, and caused mitochondrial damage as indicated by a decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential. In addition, similar findings were obtained from a cultured rat liver cell line, clone-9. These observations indicate that kava potentiates APAP-induced cytotoxicity by increasing the magnitude of GSH depletion, resulting in oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction, ultimately leading to cell death. These results highlight the potential for drug-dietary supplement interactions even with widely used over-the-counter drugs.",

This effect is achieved from modulation of GABA activity via alteration of lipid membrane structure and sodium channel function, monoamine oxidase B inhibition, and noradrenaline and dopamine re-uptake inhibition. Kava is available over the counter in jurisdictions such as the USA, Australia and New Zealand. Due to this, a review of efficacy, safety and clinical recommendations is advised. OBJECTIVE: To conduct a comprehensive review of kava, in respect to efficacy, psychopharmacology, and safety, and to provide clinical recommendations for use in psychiatry to treat generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). METHODS: A review was conducted using the electronic databases MEDLINE, CINAHL, PsycINFO and the Cochrane Library during mid 2010 of search terms relating to kava and GAD. A subsequent forward search was conducted of key papers using Web of Science cited reference search. RESULTS: The current weight of evidence supports the use of kava in treatment of anxiety with a significant result occurring in four out of six studies reviewed (mean Cohen's d = 1.1). Safety issues should however be considered. Use of traditional water soluble extracts of the rhizome (root) of appropriate kava cultivars is advised, in addition to avoidance of use with alcohol and caution with other psychotropic medications. Avoidance of high doses if driving or operating heavy machinery should be mandatory. For regular users routine liver function tests are advised. CONCLUSIONS: While current evidence supports kava for generalized anxiety, more studies are required to assess comparative efficacy and safety (on the liver, cognition, driving, and sexual effects) versus established pharmaceutical comparators.",

      "abstract": "This review critically analyzes the clinical data of patients with suspected kava hepatotoxicity and suggests recommendations for minimizing risk. Kava is a plant (Piper methysticum) of the pepper family Piperaceae, and its rhizome is used for traditional aqueous extracts in the South Pacific Islands and for commercial ethanolic and acetonic medicinal products as anxiolytic herbs in Western countries. A regulatory ban for ethanolic and acetonic kava extracts was issued in 2002 for Germany on the basis of reports connecting liver disease with the use of kava, but the regulatory causality assessment was a matter of international discussions. Based on one positive reexposure test with the kava drug, it was indeed confirmed that kava is potentially hepatotoxic. In subsequent studies using a structured, quantitative and hepatotoxicity specific causality assessment method in 14 patients with liver disease described worldwide, causality for kava +/- comedicated drugs and dietary supplements including herbal ones was highly probable (n = 1), probable (n = 4) or possible (n = 9) regarding aqueous extracts (n = 3), ethanolic extracts (n = 5), acetonic extracts (n = 4), and mixtures containing kava (n = 2). Risk factors included overdose, prolonged treatment, and comedication with synthetic drugs and dietary supplements comprizing herbal ones in most of the 14 patients. Hepatotoxicity occurred independently of the used solvent, suggesting poor kava raw material quality as additional causative factor. In conclusion, in a few individuals kava may be hepatotoxic due to overdose, prolonged treatment, comedication, and probably triggered by an unacceptable quality of the kava raw material; standardization is now required, minimizing thereby hepatotoxic risks.",

Various possible pathogenetic factors have to be discussed and comprise metabolic interactions with exogenous compounds at the hepatic microsomal cytochrome P450 level; genetic enzyme deficiencies; toxic constituents and metabolites derived from the kava extract including impurities and adulterations; cyclooxygenase inhibition; P-glycoprotein alterations; hepatic glutathione depletion; solvents and solubilizers of the extracts; and kava raw material of poor quality. In particular, inappropriate kava plant parts and unsuitable kava cultivars may have been used sometimes for manufacturing the kava extracts instead of the rhizome of a noble cultivar of the kava plant (Piper methysticum G. Forster). In conclusion, kava hepatotoxicity occurred independently of the extraction medium used for the kava extracts and may primarily be attributed to daily overdose, prolonged treatment and to a few kava extract batches of poor quality; by improving kava quality and adherence to therapy recommendation under avoidance of comedication, liver injury by kava should be a preventable disease, at least to a major extent.",

      "abstract": "Limited success has been achieved in extending the survival of patients with metastatic and hormone-refractory prostate cancer (HRPC). There is a strong need for novel agents in the treatment and prevention of HRPC. We have shown that flavokawain B (FKB), a kava chalcone, is about 4- to 12-fold more effective in reducing the cell viabilities of androgen receptor (AR)-negative, HRPC cell lines DU145 and PC-3 than AR-positive, hormone-sensitive prostate cancer cell lines LAPC4 and LNCaP, with minimal effect on normal prostatic epithelial and stromal cells. FKB induces apoptosis with an associated increased expression of proapoptotic proteins: death receptor-5, Bim and Puma and a decreased expression of inhibitors of apoptosis protein: XIAP and survivin. Among them, Bim expression was significantly induced by FKB as early as 4 hr of the treatment. Knockdown of Bim expression by short-hairpin RNAs attenuates the inhibitory effect on anchorage-dependent and -independent growth and caspase cleavages induced by FKB. These findings suggest that the effect of FKB, at least in part, requires Bim expression. In addition, FKB synergizes with TRAIL for markedly enhanced induction of apoptosis. Furthermore, FKB treatment of mice bearing DU145 xenograft tumors results in tumor growth inhibition and increases Bim expression in tumor tissues. Together, these results suggest robust mechanisms for FKB induction of apoptosis preferentially for HRPC and the potential usefulness of FKB for prevention and treatment of HRPC in an adjuvant setting.",

Kava and St. John's wort (SJW) are the most commonly used herbal medicines in the treatment of anxiety and depressive disorders, respectively. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to conduct a comprehensive review of kava and SJW, to review any evidence of efficacy, mode of action, pharmacokinetics, safety and use in major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, seasonal affective disorder (SAD), generalized anxiety disorder, social phobia (SP), panic disorder (PD), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). METHODS: A systematic review was conducted using the electronic databases MEDLINE, CINAHL, and The Cochrane Library during late 2008. The search criteria involved mood and anxiety disorder search terms in combination with kava, Piper methysticum, kavalactones, St. John's wort, Hypericum perforatum, hypericin, and hyperforin. Additional search criteria for safety, pharmacodynamics, and pharmacokinetics were employed. A subsequent forward search was conducted of the papers using Web of Science cited reference search. RESULTS: Current evidence supports the use of SJW in treating mild-moderate depression, and for kava in treatment of generalized anxiety. In respect to the other disorders, only weak preliminary evidence exists for use of SJW in SAD. Currently there is no published human trial on use of kava in affective disorders, or in OCD, PTSD, PD, or SP. These disorders constitute potential applications that warrant exploration. CONCLUSIONS: Current evidence for herbal medicines in the treatment of depression and anxiety only supports the use of Hypericum perforatum for depression, and Piper methysticum for generalized anxiety.",

The significance of the qualitative element of our clinical trial is also explored. The Kava Anxiety Depression Spectrum Study (KADSS) is a 3-week placebo-controlled, double-blind, cross-over trial involving 60 adult participants (18-65) with elevated stable anxiety and varying levels of depressive symptoms. AIMS: The aims of KADSS are: (1) to determine whether an aqueous standardised extract of kava is effective for the treatment of anxiety; (2) to assess the effects of kava on differing levels of depression; and (3) to explore participants' experience of taking kava via qualitative research. The study also provides preliminary assessment of the safety of an aqueous extract of kava in humans. CONCLUSION: If results reveal that the aqueous kava preparation exerts significant anxiolytic effects and appears safe, potentially beneficial impacts may occur. Data supporting a safe and effective kava extract may encourage a re-introduction of kava to Europe, UK and Canada. This may provide a major socioeconomic benefit to Pacific Island nations, and to sufferers of anxiety disorders.",

      "abstract": "Flavokawain A is the predominant chalcone from kava extract. We have assessed the mechanisms of flavokawain A's action on cell cycle regulation. In a p53 wild-type, low-grade, and papillary bladder cancer cell line (RT4), flavokawain A increased p21/WAF1 and p27/KIP1, which resulted in a decrease in cyclin-dependent kinase-2 (CDK2) kinase activity and subsequent G(1) arrest. The increase of p21/WAF1 protein corresponded to an increased mRNA level, whereas p27/KIP1 accumulation was associated with the down-regulation of SKP2, which then increased the stability of the p27/KIP1 protein. The accumulation of p21/WAF1 and p27/KIP1 was independent of cell cycle position and thus not a result of the cell cycle arrest. In contrast, flavokawain A induced a G(2)-M arrest in six p53 mutant-type, high-grade bladder cancer cell lines (T24, UMUC3, TCCSUP, 5637, HT1376, and HT1197). Flavokawain A significantly reduced the expression of CDK1-inhibitory kinases, Myt1 and Wee1, and caused cyclin B1 protein accumulation leading to CDK1 activation in T24 cells. Suppression of p53 expression by small interfering RNA in RT4 cells restored Cdc25C expression and down-regulated p21/WAF1 expression, which allowed Cdc25C and CDK1 activation, which then led to a G(2)-M arrest and an enhanced growth-inhibitory effect by flavokawain A. Consistently, flavokawain A also caused a pronounced CDK1 activation and G(2)-M arrest in p53 knockout but not in p53 wild-type HCT116 cells. This selectivity of flavokawain A for inducing a G(2)-M arrest in p53-defective cells deserves further investigation as a new mechanism for the prevention and treatment of bladder cancer.",

      "abstract": "Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death, and chemoprevention is a potential strategy to help control this disease. Epidemiologic survey indicates that kava may be chemopreventive for lung cancer, but there is a concern about its potential hepatotoxicity. In this study, we evaluated whether oral kava could prevent 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK) plus benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P)-induced lung tumorigenesis in A/J mice. We also studied the effect of kava to liver. At a dose of 10 mg/g diet, 30-week kava treatment (8 weeks concurrent with NNK and B[a]P treatment followed by 22 weeks post-carcinogen treatment) effectively reduced lung tumor multiplicity by 56%. Kava also reduced lung tumor multiplicity by 47% when administered concurrently with NNK and B[a]P for 8 weeks. Perhaps most importantly, kava reduced lung tumor multiplicity by 49% when administered after the final NNK and B[a]P treatment. These results show for the first time the chemopreventive potential of kava against lung tumorigenesis. Mechanistically, kava inhibited proliferation and enhanced apoptosis in lung tumors, as shown by a reduction in proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), an increase in caspase-3, and cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). Kava treatment also inhibited the activation of nuclear factor kappaBNF-kappaB, a potential upstream mechanism of kava chemoprevention. Although not rigorously evaluated in this study, our preliminary data were not suggestive of hepatotoxicity. Based on these results, further studies are warranted to explore the chemopreventive potential and safety of kava.",

After a placebo run-in of 2 weeks, the trial had a crossover design testing SJW and Kava against placebo over two controlled phases, each of 4 weeks. The primary analyses used intention-to-treat and completer analyses. RESULTS: On both intention-to-treat (p = 0.047) and completer analyses (p = 0.003), SJW and Kava gave a significantly greater reduction in self-reported depression on the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II) over placebo in the first controlled phase. However, in the crossover phase, a replication of those effects in the delayed medication group did not occur. Nor were there significant effects on anxiety or quality of life. CONCLUSION: There was some evidence of antidepressant effects using SJW and Kava in a small sample with comorbid anxiety. Possible explanations for the absence of anxiolysis may include a potential interaction with SJW, the presence of depression, or an inadequate dose of Kava.",

RESULTS: Causality was unassessable, unrelated, or excluded in 16 patients owing to lack of temporal association and causes independent of kava or comedicated drugs. Low Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences scores additionally resulted in excluded or unlikely causality assessments (n=2), leaving a total of eight patients with various degrees of causality for kava +/- comedicated drugs. Only one out of these eight patients adhered to the regulatory recommendations regarding both daily dose (<or=120 mg kavapyrones) and duration of therapy (<or=3 months) and experienced toxic liver injury with a probable causality for kava. In six cases with kava overdose and/or increased duration of kava treatment causality for kava was possible (n=3) and for kava together with the comedicated drug(s) possible (n=2) or probable (n=1).

      "abstract": "Kava was well tolerated and considered as devoid of major side effects only until 1998 when the first report of assumed kava hepatotoxicity appeared. Causality of hepatotoxicity for kava +/- comedicated drugs was evident after the use of predominantly ethanolic and acetonic kava extracts in Germany (n=7), Switzerland (n=2), United States (n=1), and Australia (n=1) as well as after aqueous extracts in New Caledonia (n=2). Compliance regarding the recommendation for daily kava dose and duration was ascertained in only a few patients, including 2 from Germany and Switzerland. Since 450 millions of daily doses of kava extracts equating to 15 millions of monthly doses were sold in Germany and Switzerland, hepatotoxicity by kava appeared to be rare--similar to other herbal remedies, dietary supplements, and synthetic drugs. Risk factors were found in most patients and include daily kava overdose, prolonged therapy, and comedication with up to 5 other herbal remedies, dietary supplements, and synthetic drugs. Kava hepatotoxicity was not reported until 1998, thus raising the question of inferior quality of the kava raw material at times of the kava boom later on. Insufficiently defined regulatory guidelines to produce kava extracts are of some concern. Open questions refer not only to kava cultivars, but also to analytical methods and definitions of extract media and contents. Future strategies should therefore focus on the solution of a standard methodology of ascertaining quality that can assure a high degree of reliability in conjunction with actions by regulators, physicians, manufacturers, and producers. A medical advisory is also recommended as part of the labelling.",

      "abstract": "Kava-containing products remain popular in the United States and continue to be sold in health food stores and ethnic markets regardless of the fact that it was banned in Western countries such as Germany, France, Switzerland, Australia, and Canada, following reports of alleged hepatotoxicity. It is therefore critical to establish efficacy and verify adverse effects and/or herb-drug interactions for kava-kava (Piper methysticum). We have previously demonstrated that kava alkaloid, pipermethystine (PM), abundant in leaves and stem peelings, induces mitochondrial toxicity in human hepatoma cells, HepG2, as compared with the bioactive components, kavalactones (KL), abundant in the rhizome. The current study compared short-term toxic effects of PM in Fischer-344 (F-344) rats to acetone-water extracts of kava rhizome (KRE). Treatment of F-344 rats with PM (10 mg/kg) and KRE (100 mg/kg) for 2 weeks failed to elicit any significant changes in liver function tests or cause severe hepatic toxicity as measured by lipid peroxidation and apoptosis markers such as malondialdehyde, Bax, and Bcl-2. However, PM-treated rats demonstrated a significant increase in hepatic glutathione, cytosolic superoxide dismutase (Cu/ZnSOD), tumor necrosis factor alpha mRNA expression, and cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2E1 and 1A2, suggesting adaptation to oxidative stress and possible drug-drug interactions.",

Groups of 10 male and 10 female rats were administered kava extract by gavage at 0, 0.125, 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 g/kg/day. Increased gamma-glutamyl-transpeptidase (GGT) activities were observed in the 2.0 g/kg males and 1.0 and 2.0 g/kg females, as well as increased serum cholesterol levels in males and females at 0.5 g/kg and higher. Increases in incidence and severity of hepatocellular hypertrophy (HP) were noted in males at 1.0 g/kg and females at 0.5 g/kg and higher, as well as increased liver weights. Immunohistochemical analyses of the expression of cytochrome-P450 (CYP) enzymes in liver of the control and 1.0- and 2.0-g/kg-treated groups indicated decreased expression of CYP2D1 (human CYP2D6 homolog) in 2.0 g/kg females and increased expression of CYP1A2, 2B1, and 3A1 in 1.0 and 2.0 g/kg groups of both sexes. The no observed adverse effect levels were decided as 0.25 g/kg in both genders, based on neurotoxic effects, increases in GGT, cholesterol, liver weight, and HP and decreases in body weight. Kava-induced hepatic functional changes in the F344 rat might be relevant to human clinical cases of hepatotoxicity following exposure.",

Biopsy of the liver showed lobular and portal necroinflammatory activity without indication of cirrhosis. DIAGNOSIS: Due to these findings with proven T-cell activity (lymphocyte typing, neopterin determination) as well as the aetiopathology, this form of hepatitis with histological characteristics of a nutritive/medicinal toxic origin was classified as induced immunologic idiosyncratic hepatitis, possibly in terms of an antibody-negative autoimmune hepatitis. TREATMENT AND CLINICAL COURSE: Discontinuation of the existing medication and simultaneous onset of immunosuppressive combination therapy of cortisone, azathioprine and ursodeoxycholic acid resulted in normalisation of the liver parameters within a period of two months. CONCLUSION: On the one hand, it appears that simultaneous intake of St John's Wort possibly potentiates the toxicity of kavapyrones. On the other hand, an immune-mediated mechanism, induced by kava-kava, cannot be completely excluded in the present case. It must be stressed that in patients with autoimmune hepatitis, precise history of medication intake should also be available.",

While normal activation of NF-kappaB is required for cell survival and immunity, its deregulated expression is a characteristic of inflammatory and infectious diseases. In this study, we investigated the molecular mechanisms induced by lactones and chalcones isolated from Fijian kava (Piper methysticum) used in traditional medicine against urinary tract infections and asthma. In order to understand underlying regulatory mechanisms, inhibition of both NF-kappaB-driven reporter gene expression and TNFalpha-induced binding of NF-kappaB to a consensus response element was achieved at concentrations of 320 microM (flavokavain A), 175 microM (flavokavain B) and 870 microM (kavain and dihydrokavain). Moreover, kavain and flavokavains A and B treatment led to inhibition of both inhibitor of kappaB (IkappaB) degradation and subsequent translocation of p50 and p65 NF-kappaB subunits from the cytoplasm to the nucleus as shown by Western blot analysis. Additionally, kinase selectivity screening demonstrates that flavokavain A, but not kavain, nor flavokavain B, inhibits the IkappaB kinase (IKK) as well as PRAK (p38-regulated/activated kinase), MAPKAP-K3 (MAPK-activated protein kinase 3), DYRK1A (dual-specificity tyrosine-phosporylated and regulated kinase 1A) and Aurora B. Altogether, these results give a first insight into anti-inflammatory mechanisms triggered by traditionally used chemopreventive kava compounds.",

      "abstract": "The present interest and widespread use of herbal remedies has created the possibility of interaction between them and pharmaceutical drugs if they are used simultaneously. Before the recent reports of apparent hepatotoxicity associated with its use, kava (Piper methysticum Forst. F.), was one of the top 10 selling herbal remedies in Europe and North America. This adverse effect was not previously encountered with the traditional beverage which was prepared as a water infusion in contrast to the commercial products which are extracted with organic solvents. Kavalactones, the active principles in kava, are potent inhibitors of several of the CYP 450 enzymes, suggesting a high potential for causing pharmacokinetic interactions with drugs and other herbs which are metabolized by the same CYP 450 enzymes. Furthermore, some kavalactones have been shown to possess pharmacological effects, such as blockade of GABA receptors and sodium and calcium ion channels, which may lead to pharmacodynamic interactions with other substances which possess similar pharmacological proprieties. St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum L.), used extensively for the treatment of mild to moderate clinical depression, has long been considered safer than the conventional pharmaceutical agents. However, its ability, through its active constituents hypericin, pseudohypericin and hyperforin, to induce intestinal P-glycoprotein/MRD1 and both intestinal and hepatic CYP3A4 enzyme, could markedly reduce the distribution and disposition of their co-substrates. In addition, St. John's wort is a potent uptake inhibitor of the neurotransmitters serotonin, norepinephrine and dopamine all of which have a role in mood control. Consequently, the very real potential for a pharmacodynamic interaction between the herb and pharmaceutical drugs which share this mechanism of action and, like St. John's wort, are used for mood elevation. However, presently there is very little evidence to substantiate actual pharmacokinetic and/or pharmacodynamic interaction between drugs and kava or St. John's wort. This review provides a brief overview of the existing data on interactions of kava and St. John's wort with pharmaceutical agents and as a result reveals the urgent need for detailed investigations to identify clinically significant interactions for these herbal remedies that have the potential to cause adverse effects.",

However, it was withdrawn from the market in Switzerland and Germany due to cases of liver failure and 'unproven' efficacy. METHODS: A protocol for the meta-analysis based on patient source data was written, a literature search was done, and six placebo-controlled, randomized trials with the kava extract WS1490 were identified. The endpoints were the change in HAMA during treatment (continuous and binary). RESULTS: WS1490 has an effective success rate of OR=3.3 (95% confidence interval of 2.09-5.22) in patients with non-psychotic anxiety disorders. The continuous outcome supports this result: mean improvement with WS1490 by 5.94 (95% confidence interval -0.86 to 12.8) points on the HAMA scale better than placebo. Kava seems to be more effective in females and in younger patients. DISCUSSION: This meta-analysis has no publication bias, no remarkable heterogeneity and is based on trials with high methodological standards. It is concluded that WS1490, and possibly other kava extracts, are effective. Therefore they remain alternatives to benzodiazepines, selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and other antidepressants in the treatment of non-psychotic anxiety disorders.",

OBJECTIVES: The present study was undertaken to investigate the effects of kava-kava extract on the sleep-wake cycle in comparison with that of flunitrazepam using sleep-disturbed rats. METHODS: Electrodes for measurement of electroencephalogram (EEG) and electromyogram (EMG) were implanted into the frontal cortex and the dorsal neck muscle of rats. EEG and EMG were recorded with an electroencephalogram. SleepSign ver.2.0 was used for EEG and EMG analysis. Total times of wakefulness, non-rapid eye movement (non-REM) and REM sleep were measured from 09:00 to 15:00. RESULTS: A significant shortening of the sleep latency in sleep-disturbed rats was observed following the administration of kava-kava extract at a dose of 300 mg/kg, while no effects were observed on the total waking and non-REM sleep time. On the other hand, flunitrazepam showed a significant shortening in sleep latency, decrease in total waking time and increase in total non-REM sleep time. Although the effects of flunitrazepam were antagonized by the benzodiazepine receptor antagonist flumazenil, the effect of kava-kava extract was not antagonized by flumazenil. Kava-kava extract showed a significant increase in delta activity during non-REM sleep in sleep-disturbed rats, whereas a significant decrease in delta power during non-REM sleep was observed with flunitrazepam. Flumazenil caused no significant effect on the changes in delta activity induced by both kava-kava extract and flunitrazepam. CONCLUSIONS: Kava-kava extract is an herbal medicine having not only hypnotic effects, but also sleep quality-enhancement effects.",

The efficacy of the plant for treatment of anxiety states was recently acknowledged in randomized controlled trials. Although these trials support the safety of Kava for short term usage, a major concern was raised in accordance with emerging reports that relate Kava use to major hepatic damage, including a few cases of fulminant hepatitis that required liver transplantation or ended in death. As a result, most medical authorities in the West restricted or banned Kava use. This review discusses evidence of efficacy and safety in the use of Kava for treating patients with anxiety, as well as its meaning in the therapeutic context and patient-doctor dialogue.",

The objectives of this study are to evaluate explanatory beliefs about reasons for generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), and to evaluate the extent to which subjects thought different approaches might be most helpful, in a study of botanical treatment. DESIGN: Post hoc analysis of data from two similarly randomized controlled clinical trails. SETTING: Psychiatric research clinic in an academic medical center. SUBJECTS: Fifty-one (51) outpatients participating in two randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trials of kava in GAD. INTERVENTIONS: Kava and placebo. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Hamilton Anxiety Scale and Global Improvement Scale. RESULTS: Subjects thought their conditions were largely related to personality factors, stressful life experiences, or cognitive patterns. These beliefs correlated positively with treatment response, whereas endorsement of belief in an energy imbalance or biologic abnormality correlated negatively with improvement. CONCLUSION: Subjects felt more strongly that cognitive patterns, personality and stress were causative of their GAD and of greatest relevance to recovery. Biologic/genetic factors were somewhat relevant, whereas the importance of energy imbalance and spiritual/religious factors were minimal. When treating patients, it is important to consider the patient's belief systems regarding the disorder, as well as credibility of treatment.",

In the active treatment group, the total score of the Hamilton anxiety scale (primary efficacy variable), showed a therapeutically relevant reduction in anxiety versus placebo (more than 4 points). In the secondary variables studied, HAMA 'somatic and psychic anxiety' subscales, the Erlangen anxiety, tension and aggression scale (EAAS), the brief personality structure scale (KEPS), the adjective checklist (EWL 60-S) and clinical global impressions scale (CGI), a trend in favour of the active treatment was detectable. WS 1490 was well tolerated and showed a safety profile with no drug-related adverse events or post-study withdrawal symptoms. It can be concluded that the applied 150 mg WS 1490 per day is an effective and safe treatment of non-psychotic anxiety syndromes in the described population.",

      "abstract": "Kava herbal supplements have been recently associated with acute hepatotoxicity, leading to the ban of kava products in approximately a dozen countries around the world. It is suspected that some alkaloids from aerial kava may have contributed to the problem. Traditionally, Pacific Islanders use primarily the underground parts of the shrub to prepare the kava beverage. However, some kava herbal supplements may contain ingredients from aerial stem peelings. The aim of this study was to test the in vitro effects of a major kava alkaloid, pipermethystine (PM), found mostly in leaves and stem peelings, and kavalactones such as 7,8-dihydromethysticin (DHM) and desmethoxyyangonin (DMY), which are abundant in the roots. Exposure of human hepatoma cells, HepG2, to 100 microM PM caused 90% loss in cell viability within 24 h, while 50 microM caused 65% cell death. Similar concentrations of kavalactones did not affect cell viability for up to 8 days of treatment. Mechanistic studies indicate that, in contrast to kavalactones, PM significantly decreased cellular ATP levels, mitochondrial membrane potential, and induced apoptosis as measured by the release of caspase-3 after 24 h of treatment. These observations suggest that PM, rather than kavalactones, is capable of causing cell death, probably in part by disrupting mitochondrial function. Thus, PM may contribute to rare but severe hepatotoxic reactions to kava.",

METHODS: In a multicenter, randomized, double-blind clinical study, 61 patients received daily doses of 200 mg WS 1490 or placebo over a period of 4 weeks. Efficacy was measured by the sleep questionnaire SF-B, the Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAMA), the Bf-S self-rating scale of well-being and the Clinical Global Impressions (CGI) scale. RESULTS: The confirmatory analysis of the two primary efficacy variables, the differences of sleep questionnaire SF-B sub-scores 'Quality of sleep' and 'Recuperative effect after sleep' after 4 weeks of double-blind treatment compared to baseline, demonstrated statistically significant group differences in favor of kava extract WS 1490 (P=0.007 and P=0.018, respectively). Superior effects of kava extract were also present in the HAMA psychic anxiety sub-score (P=0.002). More pronounced effects with respect to the self-rating of well-being and the global clinical evaluation also indicated superior therapeutic efficacy of kava extract. Safety and tolerability were good, with no drug-related adverse events or changes in clinical or laboratory parameters. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that sleep disturbances associated with non-psychotic anxiety disorders can be effectively and safely treated with kava extract WS 1490.",

During randomized treatment the total score of the Anxiety Status Inventory (ASI) observer rating scale showed more pronounced decreases in the WS 1490 group than in the placebo group. Although a treatment group comparison of the post-treatment ASI scores was not significant (p > 0.05), an exploratory analysis of variance across the differences between treatment end and baseline, with center as a second factor, showed superiority of the herbal extract over placebo (p < 0.01, two-sided). 73% of the patients treated with WS 1490 exhibited ASI score decreases > 5 points versus baseline, compared to 56% for placebo. Significant advantages for WS 1490 were also evident in a structured well-being self-rating scale (Bf-S) and the Clinical Global Impressions (CGI), while the Erlangen Anxiety, Tension and Aggression Scale (EAAS) and the Brief Test of Personality Structure (KEPS) showed only minor treatment group differences. Although the results show consistent advantages for WS 1490 over placebo in several psychiatric scales and indicate significant improvements in the patients' general well-being, the differences versus placebo were not as large as in previous trials which employed 300 mg/d of the same extract. WS 1490 was well tolerated, with no influence on liver function tests and only one trivial adverse event (tiredness) attributable to the study drug.",

Intoxication from recreational doses of kava has not been studied. The performance of individuals intoxicated from drinking kava (n=11) was compared with a control group (n=17) using saccade and cognitive tests. On average, intoxicated individuals had consumed 205 g of kava powder each (approximately 150 times clinical doses) in a group session that went for 14.4 h and ended 8 h prior to testing. Intoxicated kava drinkers showed ataxia, tremors, sedation, blepharospasm and elevated liver enzymes (GGT and ALP), together with saccadic dysmetria, saccadic slowing and reduced accuracy performing a visual search task that only became evident as the task complexity increased. Kava intoxication is characterized by specific abnormalities of movement coordination and visual attention but normal performance of complex cognitive functions.

OBJECTIVES: To investigate the extent to which physicians comply with the recommended daily dose (RDD) of an antidepressant such as kava and the consequences of this behaviour with regard to the safety and efficacy of frequently prescribed kava extracts (Trade names: Antares, Laitan and Kavasporal forte). METHOD: The analysis was carried out using the patient database MediPlus, which provides anonymous access to a representative and valid panel of physicians and patients in Germany. RESULTS: Prescriptions for Antares showed that the RDD of 1 tablet per day was exceeded in 58.2% of the cases, while those for Laitan showed that the RDD of 1 capsule per day was significantly exceeded in 75.6% of the cases; a one-off prescription was issued in 66% of the cases. As a result, the required effect diminished very quickly. Prescriptions for Kavasporal forte showed that the daily dosage of 2 capsules per day complied with the recommendations in only 49.1% of the cases; in 38.8% of the cases, the dosage dropped below the respective recommendation. As a consequence, the lower-dosed Kavasporal forte was prescribed for longer periods than the higher-dosed Antares and Laitan. CONCLUSIONS: In the case of a low-dosage recommendation, we saw a trend to over-dose in prescribing behaviour, which increases the risk of undesirable adverse reactions. On the other hand, we saw a trend to under-dose in the case of a higher dosage recommendation. This fact may explain the unexpected inefficacy of the therapy. These trends affected the duration of therapy, whereby a dosage lower than the RDD was prescribed for a longer period than a dosage higher than the RDD.",

Recent clinical trials suggest that kava has therapeutic value for the treatment of anxiety. Demonstration of kava's anxiolytic effects in animals under controlled conditions would provide additional support for its clinical potential as an anxiolytic and would facilitate investigation of its mechanism(s) of action. OBJECTIVES: This study systematically characterized the acute dosage-dependent anxiolytic and sedative effects of kava extract in well established quantitative murine behavioral assays and compared kava- and diazepam-induced behavioral changes. METHODS: Various doses of an ethanolic extract of kava root or diazepam were administered intraperitoneally to BALB/cByJ inbred mice. Behavioral changes were measured in the mirrored chamber avoidance assay and elevated plus-maze assay. Reduced latency to enter and increased time spent in a normally avoided environment operationally defined anxiolysis. Sedation was defined by a significant decrease in locomotor activity in a circular arena. RESULTS: Kava extract produced statistically significant dose-dependent anxiolytic-like behavioral changes in both assays of anxiolysis. ED(50) values for kava-induced increases in time spent inside the mirrored chamber and on the open arms of the plus maze were 125 mg/kg and 88 mg/kg, respectively. Kava extract also caused a profound decrease in locomotor activity (ED(50) of 172 mg/kg). Flumazenil, a competitive benzodiazepine receptor antagonist, blocked both the anxiolytic and sedative effects of diazepam, but had no effect on kava's behavioral actions. CONCLUSIONS: Kava extracts produce significant murine anxiolytic-like behavioral changes and sedation that are not mediated through the benzodiazepine binding site on the GABA(A) receptor complex.",

      "abstract": "Kava is a perennial shrub native to some islands of the South Pacific and has been cultivated for centuries to prepare a psychoactive beverage from its rhizoma by means of extraction. Subsequently, kava extracts are commonly used as herbal anxiolytic drugs also in many other countries all over the world including European ones and the USA. Toxicological and clinical studies have shown that kava extracts are virtually devoid of toxic effects with the exception of rare hepatotoxic side effects reported in few patients. When assessed primarily by the British regulatory authority MCA but also by us, a critical analysis of the suspected cases (n = 19) in Germany reveals that only in 1 single patient a very probable causal relationship could be established between kava treatment and the development of toxic liver disease due to a positive result of an unscheduled reexposure test, whereas in another patient there might be a possible association. Out of the remaining 17 cases 12 patients were not yet assessable due to insufficient data and in 5 other cases a causal relationship was unlikely or could be excluded. The German regulatory authority might therefore well be advised to provide now additional information for those 12 patients with so far unsatisfactory data, facilitating a more appropriate assessment of causality. Nevertheless, in the meantime physicians and patients should continue to keep an eye on possible hepatotoxic side effects in the course of kava treatment, to stop the treatment alredy at first suspicion and to start with a careful diagnostic work up ruling out all other causes.",

      "abstract": "Kava pyrones have been sold in Germany as OTC anxiolytics until June 2002, when all preparations with a kava pyrone content of more than 10(-4) of a homeopathic stock solution were withdrawn. Other countries in which kava pyrones have been used as anxiolytics, namely GB and the USA, have not followed suit. Kava pyrone anxiolytics have been positively reviewed by the Cochrane Collaboration; also newer German clinical studies have indicated pharmacological anxiolysis at the recommended doses. To use the first choice of treatment, psychotherapy, for all uncomplicated cases of pathological fear does not appear to be realistic. Current data about kava pyrone toxicity are unclear. Judging from the few well documented cases of kava pyrone hepatotoxicity (appr. 2 out of 36) in Germany and Switzerland, an immunologically mediated idiosyncratic mechanism appears to be most likely, especially at higher doses, whereas a direct toxic mechanism is much less likely. No direct results are available for the incidence of kava pyrone-related adverse drug effects. From spontaneously reported cases the incidences of adverse drug reactions cannot be obtained, a rough estimation indicates the incidence of hepatotoxicity to be comparable to those of benzodiazepines. Taken together, the withdrawal of kava pyrone-based anxiolytics appears to be an ill founded over-reaction given the lack of superior therapeutic alternatives. Neither the case evaluations presented by the BfArM (Bundesamt für Arzneimittel und Medizinprodukte = Federal Office for Drugs and Medical Products) nor the complete rejection of proof for therapeutic efficacy of kava pyrone anxiolytics are scientifically well founded.",

METHOD: 129 out-patients received either 400 mg Kava LI 150, 10 mg Buspirone or 100 mg Opipramol daily for 8 weeks. At week 9, subjects were seen to check for symptoms of withdrawal or relapse. Primary outcome measures comprised the HAMA scale and the proportion of responders at week 8. Secondary measures were the Boerner Anxiety Scale (BOEAS), SAS, CGI, a self-rating scale for well-being (Bf-S), a sleep questionnaire (SF-B), a quality-of-life questionnaire (AL) and global judgements by investigator and patients. RESULTS: In 127 patients (ITT) no significant differences could be observed regarding all efficacy and safety measures. About 75% of patients were classified as responders (50% reduction of HAMA score) in each treatment group, about 60% achieved full remission. CONCLUSION: Kava-Kava LI150 is well tolerated and as effective as Buspirone and Opipramol in the acute treatment of out-patients suffering from GAD.",

      "abstract": "Kava extracts are obtained from the rhizoma of the kava shrub (Piper methysticum) and contain various pyrones which are used as herbal anxiolytic remedies for generalized anxiety syndromes of low and intermediate grades. The commonly recommended daily dose of 60-120 mg kavapyrones and the duration of the therapy of up to 3 months should not be increased without consultation of a physician and were not followed by most patients, since herbal drugs are considered by the population not only as effective but also as safe. Whereas kava extracts are well tolerated by most patients and rare side effects are rapidly reversible upon drug discontinuation, there are suspected hepatotoxic reactions reported during the last years in temporal and not necessarily causal association with a therapy with kava extracts. Almost 80 % of the patients took kavapyrones in overdose (maximally 480 mg/d) and/or for a prolonged time of more than 3 months up to 2 years. Additional risks factors include co-medication with up to 5 other chemically defined or herbal drugs with in part potentially hepatotoxic properties as well as a genetic deficiency of the hepatic microsomal cytochrome P450 2D6. Severe clinical courses with liver transplantation and possible fatal outcome occurred in 7 patients with overdose and/or long duration of the therapy with kavapyrones. Preventive measures should therefore include a dose of 120, maximally 210 mg kavapyrones per day for 1 month, maximally 2 months, as well as a prescription by a physician. Laboratory test (ALT and gamma-GT) should be done before and during the therapy, and co-medication and alcohol consumption should be avoided. With these measures the hepatotoxic risks under the treatment with kavapyrones might be minimized which are also available via internet and from abroad with possible severe consequences when taken without medical supervision.",

We report a case of acute hepatitis associated with the use of kava kava, derived from the root of the pepper plant, Piper methysticum. It is used in the United States as an antianxiety and sedative agent. CASE REPORT: A previously healthy 14-year-old female was admitted to the hospital with hepatic failure. Initial therapy, including plasmapheresis, was unsuccessful and she deteriorated. She ultimately required a liver transplant and now remains well. The liver biopsy showed hepatocellular necrosis consistent with chemical hepatitis. A work-up for alternative causes of liver failure was negative. The patient gave a history of taking a kava kava-containing product for four months. The use of kava kava and liver failure, is supported by kava kava use, a negative work-up for alternative causes of liver failure, and histological changes in the liver. CONCLUSIONS: Health care professionals need to be aware of the possibility of kava kava-induced hepatotoxicity. The toxicity of these alternative remedies emphasizes the importance of surveillance programs and quality control in the manufacture of these products. Clinicians must remain aware of the toxic potential of herbal products and always inquire about their intake in cases of unexplained liver injury.",

Hormone replacement therapy or neuroactive drugs represent useful treatments for these disturbances but may be contraindicated or not accepted. Herein it was investigated the efficacy of Kava-Kava, an extract of Piper Methysticum, on mood of perimenopausal women. DESIGN: A 3-months randomized prospective open study investigating in perimenopausal women modifications induced by calcium supplementation (control; n=34), calcium plus Kava-Kava at the dose of 100 mg/day (n=15) or calcium plus Kava-Kava at the dose 200 mg/day (n=19). Anxiety was evaluated by the State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI); depression by the Zung's scale (SDS), and climacteric symptoms by the Greene's scale. Evaluations were performed at baseline and after 1 and 3 months. RESULTS: In the control group during the 3 months, anxiety, depression and climacteric symptoms tended to decline, but not significantly. During Kava-Kava anxiety declined (P<0.001) at 1 (-3.8+/-1.03) and 3 (-5.03+/-1.2) months, depression declined at 3 months (-5.03+/-1.4; P<0.002) and climacteric score declined (P<0.0006) at 1 (-2.87+/-1.5) and 3 (-5.38+/-1.3) months. Only the decline of anxiety induced by Kava-Kava was significantly greater than that spontaneously occurring in controls (P<0.009). CONCLUSIONS: The present data indicate that, in perimenopausal women, administration of Kava-Kava induces an improvement of mood, particularly of anxiety.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Constraints on resources and time often render treatments for anxiety such as psychological interventions impracticable, while synthetic anxiolytic drugs are effective, but are often burdened with adverse events. Options which are effective and safe would be of considerable interest and a welcome addition to the therapeutic repertoire. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness and safety as reported in rigorous clinical trials of kava extract compared with placebo for treating anxiety. SEARCH STRATEGY: All publications describing (or which might describe) randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of kava extract for anxiety were sought through electronic searches on EMBASE, MEDLINE, AMED (British Library), CISCOM (Research Council for Complementary Medicine, London), Central/CCTR and CCDANCTR. The search terms that were used were kava, kawa, kavain, Piper methysticum and Rauschpfeffer (German common name for Piper methysticum). Additionally, manufacturers of kava preparations and experts on the subject were contacted and asked to contribute published and unpublished material. Hand-searches of relevant medical journals (Erfahrungsheilkunde 1996 - 2002, Forsch Komplementärmed Klass Naturheilkd 1994 - 2002, Phytomed 1994 - 2002, Alt Comp Ther 1995 - 2002), conference proceedings (e.g. FACT - Focus on Alternative and Complementary Therapies 1996 - 2002) and our own files were conducted. The searches were updated to August 2002. No restrictions regarding the language of publication were imposed. SELECTION CRITERIA: To be included studies were required to be randomised, controlled trials (RCTs), i.e. trials with a randomised generation of allocation sequences, and conducted placebo-controlled and double-blind, i.e. trials with blinding of patients and care providers. Trials using oral preparations containing kava extract as the only component (mono-preparation) were considered. Trials using single constituents of kava extract alone, assessing kava extract as one of several active components in a combination preparation or as a part of a combination therapy were excluded. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Data were extracted systematically according to patient characteristics, interventions and results. Methodological quality of all trials was evaluated using the standard scoring system developed by Jadad and colleagues. The screening of studies, selection, data extraction, validation and the assessment of methodological quality were performed independently by the two reviewers. Disagreements in the evaluation of individual trials were resolved through discussion. MAIN RESULTS: Eleven trials with a total of 645 participants met the inclusion criteria. The meta-analysis of six studies using the total score on the Hamilton Anxiety scale as a common outcome measure suggests a significant reduction in patients receiving kava extract compared with patients receiving placebo (weighted mean difference: 5.0, 95% confidence interval: 1.1 to 8.8; p = 0.01; n = 345). Adverse events as reported in the reviewed trials were mild, transient and infrequent. REVIEWER'S CONCLUSIONS: Compared with placebo, kava extract appears to be an effective symptomatic treatment option for anxiety. The data available from the reviewed studies suggest that kava is relatively safe for short-term treatment (1 to 24 weeks), although more information is required. Further rigorous investigations, particularly into the long-term safety profile of kava are warranted.",

In this pilot study, 24 patients suffering from stress-induced insomnia were treated for 6 weeks with kava (LI-150), 120 mg daily. This was followed by a 2-week 'wash-out' period off treatment, and then, five patients having dropped out, 19 received valerian (LI-156), 600 mg daily, for another 6 weeks. Then there was a further 2-week period off treatment, and a final 6 weeks of treatment of these 19 patients with the two compounds combined (kava + valerian). Stress was measured in three areas: social, personal and life events; insomnia in three areas also: time to fall asleep, hours slept and waking mood. Total stress severity was significantly relieved by both compounds individually (p < 0.01), with no significant differences between them; and there was also improvement with the combination, significant in the case of insomnia (p < 0.05). On direct questioning, 16 patients (67%) reported no side effects on kava, 10 (53%) on valerian and 10 (53%) on the combination. The 'commonest' effect was vivid dreams with kava + valerian (4 cases (21%)) and with valerian alone (3 cases (16%)), followed by gastric discomfort and dizziness with kava (3 cases each (3 %)). These results are considered to be extremely promising but further studies may be required to determine the relative roles of the two compounds for such indications.

      "abstract": "Anxiety disorders are among the most common psychiatric disorders that affect all age groups of the general population. Currently, the preferred treatment is with pharmacological drugs that have antidepressant or anti-anxiety properties. However, these agents have numerous and often serious adverse effects, including sedation, impaired cognition, ataxia, aggression, sexual dysfunction, tolerance and dependence. Withdrawal reactions on termination after long-term administration are also a major limiting factor in the use of these agents. Herbal remedies, including kava (Piper methysticum), have been shown to be effective as alternative treatments, at least in mild to moderate cases of anxiety. Kava is a social and ceremonial herb from the South Pacific. It is available in the west as an over-the-counter preparation. Its biological effects, due to a mixture of compounds called kavalactones, are reported to include sedative, anxiolytic, antistress, analgesic, local anaesthetic, anticonvulsant and neuroprotective properties. The pharmacological properties of kava are postulated to include blockade of voltage-gated sodium ion channels, enhanced ligand binding to gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) type A receptors, diminished excitatory neurotransmitter release due to calcium ion channel blockade, reduced neuronal reuptake of noradrenaline (norepinephrine), reversible inhibition of monoamine oxidase B and suppression of the synthesis of the eicosanoid thromboxane A(2), which antagonises GABA(A) receptor function. Clinical studies have shown that kava and kavalactones are effective in the treatment of anxiety at subclinical and clinical levels, anxiety associated with menopause and anxiety due to various medical conditions. Until recently, the adverse effects attributed to kava use were considered mild or negligible, except for the occurrence of a skin lesion. This disorder, called kava dermopathy, occurs only with prolonged use of large amounts of kava and is reversible on reduced intake or cessation. Rare cases of interactions have occurred with pharmaceutical drugs that share one or more mechanisms of action with the kavalactones. In the past few years, about 35 cases of severe liver toxicity associated with kava intake have been reported in Europe and the US. However, a direct causal relationship with kava use has been difficult to establish in the majority of the cases, and there is insufficient evidence to implicate kava as the responsible agent. Nevertheless, until further research clarifies any causality, kava should be used with caution.",

To our knowledge, there are only few data concerning the efficacy of Kava-Kava in animal tests of anxiety. This study was carried out to compare the anxiolytic potential of Kava-Kava extract LI 150 with diazepam. Acute effects of diazepam and a Kava-Kava preparation, compared to their respective controls, were examined in Wistar rats using the elevated plus maze (X-maze). The time spent on open arms, the percentage of open-arm visits and parameters describing the risk assessment were evaluated. LI 150 (120-240 mg/kg p.o.) affected the behaviour measured in the X-maze test, inducing an anxiolytic like behaviour similar to diazepam (15 mg/kg p.o.).

In the opinion of the authors, all articles from this collection containing data that could inform the neurological and cognitive sequelae of kava use were included for the purpose of this review. RESULTS: The use of kava occurs among indigenous populations in the South Pacific and in northern Australia, while also being used throughout the western world as a herbal medicine. Animal studies show that kava lactones alter neuronal excitation through direct interactions with voltage-dependent ion channels, giving rise to kava's muscle relaxant, anaesthetic, anxiolytic and anticonvulsive properties. Several isolated cases of psychotic and severe dystonic reactions following kava use suggest that kava also has psychoactive properties, yet there is no conclusive evidence that kava interferes with normal cognitive processes. CONCLUSIONS: Kava is effective in the treatment of tension and anxiety. There may be risk-factors for severe motor and psychiatric responses to kava use, although these are not well-understood. Given the increasingly widespread use of kava, further investigation is necessary to gain an understanding of its immediate neuropsychiatric effects and long-term cognitive effects.",

      "abstract": "Drug and alcohol abuse is one of the United States' most expensive and damaging health risk. The financial and social costs of addiction have led to a significant investment in prevention and treatment in an effort to reduce the incidence and prevalence of drug abuse. One important area of research is the chemistry of craving. It is assumed that if the neurological process of craving can be interrupted, then addiction can be successfully treated. The active ingredients found in kava, known as kavapyrones, have been found to bind to many sites in the brain that are associated with addiction and craving. In an effort to determine if kava can decrease the craving associated with substances of abuse, a craving survey and pilot study were completed where cravings of alcohol, tobacco, cocaine, and heroin were examined. The preliminary findings suggest that kava may reduce the craving associated with addiction. In one investigation, the participants reported a reduction in their desire for their drug of choice. In another investigation, a standardized amount of kavapyrones led to an apparent difference in abstinence between the experimental and placebo groups for alcohol. The studies presented are considered preliminary and exploratory, and intended only as a precursor to future, more systematic and large-scale investigations. If the findings are confirmed, kava may be a useful component to the treatment of addictions, especially for Native Hawaiian and Pacific peoples.",

Weekly efficacy assessments [Hamilton Anxiety Scale, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), Self Assessment of Resilience and Anxiety (SARA)] and safety evaluations were conducted. Improvement was observed with both treatments but no differences were found in the principal analysis. Post-hoc analyses revealed significant differences based on baseline anxiety severity, whereby kava was superior on the SARA in low anxiety and placebo was superior on the HADS and SARA in high anxiety. Both treatments were well tolerated. Although kava was not superior to placebo, it would be premature to rule it out as efficacious in GAD.",

Literature searches were conducted in four electronic databases and the reference lists of all papers located were checked for further relevant publications. Information was also sought from the spontaneous reporting schemes of the WHO and national drug safety bodies and ten manufacturers of kava preparations were contacted. Data from short-term post-marketing surveillance studies and clinical trials suggest that adverse events are, in general, rare, mild and reversible. However, published case reports indicate that serious adverse events are possible including dermatological reactions, neurological complications and, of greatest concern, liver damage. Spontaneous reporting schemes also suggest that the most common adverse events are mild, but that serious ones occur. Controlled trials suggest that kava extracts do not impair cognitive performance and vigilance or potentiate the effects of central nervous system depressants. However, a possible interaction with benzodiazepines has been reported. It is concluded that when taken as a short-term monotherapy at recommended doses, kava extracts appear to be well tolerated by most users. Serious adverse events have been reported and further research is required to determine the nature and frequency of such events.",

This article provides a clinically oriented overview of the efficacy and safety of ginkgo, St. John's wort, ginseng, echinacea, saw palmetto, and kava. Wherever possible, assessments are based on systematic reviews of randomized clinical trials. Encouraging data support the efficacy of some of these popular herbal medicinal products, and the potential for doing good seems greater than that for doing harm. The published evidence suggests that ginkgo is of questionable use for memory loss and tinnitus but has some effect on dementia and intermittent claudication. St. John's wort is efficacious for mild to moderate depression, but serious concerns exist about its interactions with several conventional drugs. Well-conducted clinical trials do not support the efficacy of ginseng to treat any condition. Echinacea may be helpful in the treatment or prevention of upper respiratory tract infections, but trial data are not fully convincing. Saw palmetto has been shown in short-term trials to be efficacious in reducing the symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia. Kava is an efficacious short-term treatment for anxiety. None of these herbal medicines is free of adverse effects. Because the evidence is incomplete, risk-benefit assessments are not completely reliable, and much knowledge is still lacking.",

This study examined whether the herbal anxiolytic, kava, produces improvement in vagal control in generalized anxiety disorder. Before and after treatment with placebo (n = 7) or kava (n = 6), two indices of vagal control were measured under supine conditions using power spectral analysis: baroreflex control of heart rate (BRC) and respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA). Significantly more patients treated with kava showed improved BRC compared to the placebo group (p < 0.05). Furthermore, the magnitude of improvement in BRC was significantly correlated with the degree of clinical improvement (p < 0.05). RSA did not respond to treatment. These preliminary findings suggest that kava might exert a favourable effect on reflex vagal control of heart rate in generalized anxiety disorder patients. The parallel clinical and BRC responses may reflect an underlying common effect of this herbal anxiolytic.",

These dosage adjustments were followed by 3 weeks of monotherapy with WS1490 or placebo. Outcome measures were the differences between baseline and end of treatment on the Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAMA) and on a subjective well-being scale (Bf-S), as well as the benzodiazepine withdrawal symptoms. Changes in the Erlanger Anxiety, Tension and Aggression Scale (EAAS) and Clinical Global Impressions (CGI) were analyzed as secondary measures. Treatment safety was checked by interviews, adverse event reports and laboratory investigations. Forty patients (2x20) were included into the study. WS1490 was superior to placebo regarding the HAMA (P=0.01) and Bf-S (P=0.002) total scores and all secondary efficacy measures. The tolerance of WS1490 was not inferior to placebo. The study confirms the anxiolytic efficacy and good tolerance of WS1490 and shows that a further symptom reduction is possible after a change-over from benzodiazepine treatment.",
