      "abstract": "The skin, as the outermost layer of the body, serves as a crucial protective barrier against environmental insults while maintaining homeostasis. Atopic dermatitis (AD), a chronic inflammatory skin disorder characterized by recurrent eczema and type 2 inflammation, affects a significant global population. The pathophysiology of AD is closely linked to skin barrier dysfunction, which contributes to increased permeability, immune dysregulation, and microbial imbalances. Historically, skin barrier research has centered on the stratum corneum (SC) and intercellular lipids within the epidermis, primarily conceptualized through the \"brick-and-mortar\" model. However, recent advancements have revealed a more intricate interplay among various barrier components. Two key determinants of skin barrier-SC pH and SC ceramides-have gained substantial attention. Elevated SC pH leads to enhanced serine protease activity, impaired lipid metabolism, and microbiome dysbiosis, all of which exacerbate barrier dysfunction and inflammation in AD. Concurrently, alterations in SC ceramide profiles and structures compromise skin barrier function. Emerging evidence underscores the potential of SC pH and ceramides as biomarkers for disease progression and as therapeutic targets for barrier restoration. Advances in lipid analyses and non-invasive pH assessment offer promising prospects for personalized dermatologic interventions. This review explores the complex interactions of SC pH and ceramides in AD pathogenesis, discussing their implications for predicting disease flares, guiding treatment strategies, and identifying novel drug targets. A deeper understanding of these mechanisms could pave the way for next-generation therapeutic approaches in AD and other skin barrier-related disorders."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Ceramides are known for their harmful, cell-autonomous effects in cigarette smoke (CS)-triggered chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), yet their potential role as intercellular signals in COPD pathogenesis remains unclear. This study aims to investigate whether ceramides act as cell-nonautonomous mediators of COPD development by transmitting metabolic stress from pulmonary macrophages to endothelial cells (ECs), compromising endothelial function and thereby orchestrating the pulmonary inflammation. METHODS: We analyzed single-cell RNA sequencing data from human lung tissues and bulk RNA sequencing data from alveolar macrophages (AMs) in COPD patients to investigate the transcriptomic profiles of ceramide biosynthesis enzymes. The expression changes of several key enzymes were validated in human lung sections, AMs isolated from CS-exposed mice, and cigarette smoke extract (CSE)-treated macrophages. Ceramide levels in macrophages and their extracellular vesicles (EVs) were quantified using mass spectroscopy lipidomics. EVs were further characterized by transmission electron microscopy and nanoparticle tracking analysis. The uptake of macrophage-derived EVs by ECs and their effects on endothelial barriers were evaluated in vitro using a co-culture system and in vivo using a CS-exposed COPD mouse model. RESULTS: CS exposure upregulated enzymes involved in de novo ceramide biosynthesis in pulmonary macrophages, increasing levels of long- and very long-chain ceramides. These ceramides were packaged into EVs and delivered to ECs, where they disrupted gap junctions, increased endothelial permeability, and impaired EC migration. Silencing these enzymes involved in de novo ceramide biosynthesis in pulmonary macrophages could block this metabolic communication between macrophages and ECs mediated by EV-delivered ceramides, protecting EC function from CS exposure. When intratracheally administered to CS-exposed mice, these ceramide-rich macrophage-derived EVs exacerbated COPD by facilitating endothelial barrier disruption. CONCLUSION: Our study uncovered a novel mechanism in COPD pathogenesis, where pulmonary macrophages propagate CS-induced metabolic stress to ECs via ceramide-laden EVs, leading to endothelial barrier dysfunction. This intercellular pathway represents a potential target for therapeutic intervention in COPD.",

      "abstract": "Recent evidence has shown that increased levels of circulating long-chain ceramides predict atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease independently of cholesterol1,2. Although targeting ceramide signalling may provide therapeutic benefits beyond the treatment of hypercholesterolaemia, the underlying mechanism by which circulating ceramides aggravate atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease remains elusive. Here we examine whether circulating long-chain ceramides activate membrane G-protein-coupled receptors to exacerbate atherosclerosis. We perform a systematic screen that combines G-protein-signalling quantification, bioinformatic analysis of G-protein-coupled receptor expression and functional examination of NLRP3 inflammasome activation. The results suggest that CYSLTR2 and P2RY6 are potential endogenous receptors of C16:0 ceramide-induced inflammasome activation in both endothelial cells and macrophages. Inhibition of CYSLTR2 and P2RY6 genetically or pharmacologically alleviates ceramide-induced atherosclerosis aggravation. Moreover, increased ceramide levels correlate with the severity of coronary artery disease in patients with varying degrees of renal impairment. Notably, CYSLTR2 and P2RY6 deficiency mitigates chronic-kidney-disease-aggravated atherosclerosis in mice without affecting cholesterol or ceramide levels. Structural analyses of ceramide-CYSLTR2-Gq complexes reveal that both C16:0 and C20:0 ceramides bind in an inclined channel-like ligand-binding pocket on CYSLTR2. We further reveal an unconventional mechanism underlying ceramide-induced CYSLTR2 activation and the CYSLTR2-Gq interface. Overall, our study provides structural and molecular mechanisms of how long-chain ceramides initiate transmembrane Gq and inflammasome signalling through direct binding to CYSLTR2 and P2RY6 receptors. Therefore, blocking these signals may provide a new therapeutic potential to treat atherosclerosis-related diseases."

      "abstract": "The brain is rich in lipids, and disorders or abnormalities in lipid metabolism can induce neurotoxicity. Ceramides are the central intermediates of sphingolipid metabolism. This study was designed to investigate the potential lipotoxicity of ceramides in brain ischemia. First, a pseudo-targeted lipidomics analysis of plasma samples from stroke patients found significantly elevated levels of long-chain ceramides. A similar observation was made in mice subjected to permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (pMCAO) surgery. In cultured cells, it was found that the altered ceramides were mainly derived from astrocytes via de novo pathway, and SPTLC2 was a key regulator because Sptlc2 knockdown largely blocked ceramide production. Ceramides induced astrocyte activation and triggered oxidative stress to impair mitochondrial homeostasis by increasing mitochondrial permeabilization. Moreover, ceramides triggered the formation of voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC) oligomers in the mitochondrial outer membrane, through which mtDNA was released into the cytoplasm. Similar to oxygen and glucose depletion treatment, ceramides also increased cGAS activity and STING protein expression. However, this activity was diminished in the presence of the mitochondrial ROS scavenger SKQ1, indicating the involvement of oxidative stress in ceramide action. By facilitating cGAS/STING signaling cascades, ceramides resultantly induced interferon response to aggravate inflammatory damage in the ischemic brain. To address the impact of ceramides on brain ischemic injury in vivo, ceramide generation was blocked in the brain by injection of AAV9-Sptlc2 shRNA in pMCAO mice. Sptlc2 knockdown in the brain reduced ceramide generation and attenuated brain ischemic damage with astrocyte inactivation. As expected, Sptlc2 deficiency effectively blocked cGAS/STING pathway-dependent interferon responses. Together, these findings suggest a new therapeutic strategy for pharmacological intervention to attenuate neuroinflammation.",

      "abstract": "Ceramide has transitioned from an incidental discovery to a vital element in skincare, becoming a thoroughly studied compound in the quest to treat skin conditions. Creating a moisture barrier, preserving hydration, regulating pH, controlling inflammation, and enhancing skin functions and appearance are among its established benefits. It is often used medically to repair skin barrier defects, as observed in inflammatory skin conditions like atopic dermatitis (AD) and dry skin types. Furthermore, ceramide and its metabolites are commonly used as predictors before disease manifestation and for prognostication processes, thus can be used as biomarker for clinical diagnosis as well. In the last couple of decades, momentum was also seen in the pre-clinical studies involving anti-cancer and nanotechnology field, whereby ceramide was also used as a drug, a carrier, or even adjunct formulation to increase efficacy of treatment such as chemotherapy. Approaches to increase ceramide levels include directly replenishing lost ceramides with natural extracts, synthetic pseudo-ceramides, or ceramide-like analogues, as well as using supplements that stimulate the body's natural ceramide production. Although ceramide is a well-known treatment in skincare and for common skin conditions like AD and psoriasis, its development and related pharmacology for severe skin conditions, such as skin cancer, remain in pre-clinical stages. Hence, the purpose of this research is to explore the role of ceramide in skin health and its application in common skin diseases.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Ceramides are essential epidermal constituents that play a critical role in skin moisturization treatment as a raw material in cosmetics formulation. Recently, ceramides have been known to be frequently applied in various cosmetic formulations. Despite ceramide's beneficial characteristics, academic research regarding ceramides and their skin absorption remains insufficient. Therefore, our study conducted clinical research employing Raman spectroscopy to investigate the effects of ceramides on skin absorption to enhance the understanding of ceramides' dermatological functionality and their topical application in cosmetics science. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty healthy individuals with dry skin have participated in this clinical trial. In this double-arm designed trial, the test group received an investigational product with ceramides (5000 ppm) and a control group received an investigational product without the ceramides while all other components remained identical. The subjects visited the clinical research center and acclimatized for 30 min in constant humidity and temperature for equilibrium, subsequently conducting a measurement. Before the trial, the research subject's target site (lower arm area) was kept clean, devoid of any cosmetic administering 24 h before the trial when investigational product was topically applied. RESULTS: Our findings with Raman spectroscopy statistically demonstrate that skin absorption amount, speed and depth for both groups improved overall (p < 0.05) after administration of the investigational product. Notably, the test group received an investigational product with ceramides (5000 ppm) indicating superior effectiveness across all parameters compared to a control group from comparison analysis of each parameter (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: This study concludes that ceramide-containing cosmetics provide a beneficial effect on skin absorption via visual and statistical results of Raman spectroscopy analysis.",

New biomarkers, such as ceramides, may help in the diagnosis and treatment of this disease. This study included 73 ACE patients for whom the SARS-CoV-2 infection was verified. Two subgroups were formed: the favorable outcome subgroup and the fatal outcome subgroup. Plasma samples were collected from all patients at the time of admission for a metabolomic analysis. The analysis of metabolites revealed that the ceramide levels were significantly lower in the fatal outcome subgroup than in the survivor subgroup. Therefore, determining ceramide levels in patients with ACEs in conjunction with COVID-19 may help assess the prognosis of these patients and manage their risks."

      "abstract": "Ceramides are a family of lipids constituted by a sphingoid base and a fatty acid. In the skin, they are mainly present in the stratum corneum where, with cholesterol and free fatty acids, they constitute the inter-corneocyte lipids. With the other lipid groups, they play a key role in the formation of dense lamellar structures between adjacent corneocytes, collectively ensuring the vital efficient barrier to water evaporation and protection from foreign agents´ penetration. Changes in ceramide level and relative composition, with potential impairment of lipid arrangement, have been evidenced in different skin conditions and skin diseases. Therefore, use of suitably formulated ceramides has been proposed for topical treatment to help re-structure damaged lipid arrangement and repair impaired skin barrier function. Nonetheless, the formulation of ceramides in products necessitates specific processes such as heating to high temperature before their introduction in the final formula. In this review on the structure, the role and the potential of ceramides for skincare, we point out the necessity of rigorous process when formulating ceramides into the final product. We demonstrate the counterproductive effects of undissolved ceramides on skin barrier repair capacity of the formulas, when assessed in different in vitro models of disrupted skin barrier.",

      "abstract": "The selection for rapid growth in chickens has rendered meat-type (broiler) chickens susceptible to develop metabolic syndrome and thus inflammation. The sphingolipid ceramide has been linked as a marker of oxidative stress in mammals, however, the relationship between sphingolipid ceramide supply and oxidative stress in broiler chickens has not been investigated. Therefore, we employed a lipidomic approach to investigate the changes in circulating sphingolipid ceramides in context of allopurinol-induced oxidative stress in birds. Day zero hatched chicks (n = 60) were equally divided into six groups; an unsupplemented control, an allopurinol group (25 mg/kg body weight), a conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) group where half of the oil used in the control diet was substituted for a CLA oil mixture, a CLA and an allopurinol group utilizing the same dose of CLA and allopurinol, a berberine (BRB) group consisting of berberine supplementation (200 mg/kg feed), and a BRB and allopurinol group, utilizing the same dose of BRB and allopurinol. Conjugated linoleic acid and berberine were utilized to potentially enhance antioxidant activity and suppress the oxidative stress induced by allopurinol treatment. Body weight, plasma uric acid, nonesterified fatty acids (NEFA) and sphingolipid ceramides were quantified. Allopurinol induced an inflammatory state as measured by a significant reduction in plasma uric acid - an antioxidant in birds as well as a metabolic waste product. Results showed that both total and saturated sphingolipid ceramides declined (p < 0.05) with age in unsupplemented chicks, although plasma ceramides C16:0 and 18:0 increased in concentration over the study period. Simple total and saturated sphingolipid ceremide's were further decreased (p < 0.05) with allopurinol supplementation, however, this may be an indirect consequence of inducing an inflammatory state. Neither CLA or BRB were able to significantly attenuate the decline. The administration of allopurinol specifically targets the liver which in birds, is the primary organ for fatty acids synthesis. For this reason, sphingolipid ceramide production might have been unwittingly affected by the addition of allopurinol."

The combined use of moisturizers and topical anti-inflammatory drugs is essential for alleviating atopic dermatitis. We have developed a topical anti-inflammatory drug with a steroid and a moisturizer with heparinoid, both in lamellar structure-based formulations containing synthetic pseudo-ceramides. Here, assessed the efficacy of this combination in the treatment of atopic dermatitis. METHODS: We included 22 patients with mild to moderate atopic dermatitis and subjected them to a seven-week treatment with the test formulations, followed by a four-week post-treatment period. RESULTS: Clinical findings and the quality of life of participants remarkably improved after one week of treatment. Furthermore, skin hydration and transepidermal water loss considerably improved at weeks one and three, respectively. The Cer [NP]/[NS] ratio, an indicator of epidermal turnover, substantially increased during the treatment period and remained elevated even thereafter. The improvement in stratum corneum function was distinctive in participants with lower barrier function. CONCLUSION: These findings indicated that the combined use of the anti-inflammatory drug and moisturizer, both in lamellar structure-based formulations, is effective in treating atopic dermatitis in patients with fragile barrier function."

      "abstract": "The cannabinoid-type I (CB1) receptor functions as a double-edged sword to decide cell fate: apoptosis/survival. Elevated CB1 receptor expression is shown to cause acute ceramide accumulation to meet the energy requirements of fast-growing cancers. However, the flip side of continual CB1 activation is the initiation of a second ceramide peak that leads to cell death. In this study, we used ovarian cancer cells, PA1, which expressed CB1, which increased threefold when treated with a natural compound, bis(palmitoleic acid) ester of a glycerol (C2). This novel compound is isolated from a marine snail, Conus inscriptus, using hexane and the structural details are available in the public domain PubChem database (ID: 14275348). The compound induced two acute ceramide pools to cause G0/G1 arrest and killed cells by apoptosis. The compound increased intracellular ceramides (C:16 to 7 times and C:18 to 10 times), both of which are apoptotic inducers in response to CB1 signaling and thus the compound is a potent CB1 agonist. The compound is not genotoxic because it did not induce micronuclei formation in non-cancerous Chinese hamster ovarian (CHO) cells. Since the compound induced the cannabinoid pathway, we tested if there was a psychotropic effect in zebrafish models, however, it was evident that there were no observable neurobehavioral changes in the treatment groups. With the available data, we propose that this marine compound is safe to be used in non-cancerous cells as well as zebrafish. Thus, this anticancer compound is non-toxic and triggers the CB1 pathway without causing psychotropic effects.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Topical therapy is the mainstay treatment of acne, and topical retinoids such as tretinoin, tazarotene, and adapalene are recommended as the first-line therapy for mild to moderate acne. However, the cutaneous irritations may occur, and the dermocosmetics are recommended to prevent side effects of anti-acne drugs and adhere to treatment. Thus, this study aims to compare the efficacy and tolerability of ceramides and niacinamide-containing moisturizer (CCM) versus hydrophilic cream in combination with topical anti-acne treatment in mild to moderate acne vulgaris. METHODS: This was an 8-week, randomized, double-blinded, split face study in 40 patients assigned for topical anti-acne medications (5% benzoyl peroxide and 0.1% adapalene gel), then randomly applied CCM or hydrophilic cream. All patients were followed at week 0, 2, 4, and 8 for acne improvement, adverse reactions, biometric, and biophysical evaluation. RESULTS: CCM could significantly improve the non-inflammatory, inflammatory, and total acne lesions compared with hydrophilic cream after week 8 of treatment. Interestingly, there was an improvement of global worst score, hemoglobin index, melanin index, TEWL, skin hydration, sebum production, and skin surface pH, with no statistically significant differences between the two treatments. No serious side effects from clinical application of CCM and hydrophilic cream in mild to moderate acne vulgaris patients. CONCLUSION: Ceramide and niacinamide-containing moisturizer in combination with anti-acne medication can significantly improve acne lesions and decrease cutaneous irritations toward a satisfactory treatment outcome of mild to moderate acne vulgaris.",

      "abstract": "AIMS: Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) is the best documented cardiovascular risk predictor and at the same time serves as a target for lipid-lowering therapy. However, the power of LDL-C to predict risk is biased by advanced age, comorbidities, and medical treatment, all known to impact cholesterol levels. Consequently, such biased patient cohorts often feature a U-shaped or inverse association between LDL-C and cardiovascular or overall mortality. It is not clear whether these constraints for risk prediction may likewise apply to other lipid risk markers in particular to ceramides and phosphatidylcholines. METHODS AND RESULTS: In this observational cohort study, we recorded cardiovascular mortality in 1195 patients over a period of up to 16 years, comprising a total of 12 262 patient-years. The median age of patients at baseline was 67 years. All participants were either consecutively referred to elective coronary angiography or diagnosed with peripheral artery disease, indicating a high cardiovascular risk. At baseline, 51% of the patients were under statin therapy. We found a U-shaped association between LDL-C and cardiovascular mortality with a trough level of around 150 mg/dL of LDL-C. Cox regression analyses revealed that LDL-C and other cholesterol species failed to predict cardiovascular risk. In contrast, no U-shaped but linear association was found for ceramide- and phosphatidylcholine-containing markers and these markers were able to significantly predict the cardiovascular risk even after multivariate adjustment. CONCLUSION: We thus suggest that ceramides- and phosphatidylcholine-based predictors rather than LDL-C may be used for a more accurate cardiovascular risk prediction in high-risk patients."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a highly prevalent chronic inflammatory skin condition. In Malaysia, a prevalence of 13.4% was reported for children between one and six years of age, one of the highest prevalence rates of AD in Asia. Many guidelines recommended moisturisers as the mainstay of treatment strategy for AD. Selecting an effective and suitable moisturiser for people with AD plays a crucial role in avoiding acute exacerbation of AD and achieving remission. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Given that an array of active ingredients and topical vehicles for moisturisers are available in the market, this review summarised the roles of ceramides and multivesicular emulsion (MVE) technology in managing AD to help guide treatment decisions. RESULTS: Ceramides are essential in maintaining the skin permeability barrier and hydration, modulating skin immunity through anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial defence system, and regulating cellular functions. Low levels and altered structures and composition of ceramides, compromised skin permeability barrier and increased transepidermal water loss were commonly observed in AD patients. Most clinical studies have shown that ceramidedominant moisturisers are safe and effective in adults and children with AD. MVE technology offers an attractive delivery system to replenish ceramides in the SC, repairing the compromised skin permeability barrier and potentially improving patient compliance. CONCLUSION: Recommending clinically proven therapeutic moisturisers with the right ingredients (level, ratio, structure and composition), alongside an effective sustained release delivery system, to AD patients is one key strategy to successful disease control and flare prevention, subsequently reducing the disease burden to patients, families and societies.",

      "abstract": "Metabolic Syndrome (MS) is a rapidly growing medical problem worldwide and is characterized by a cluster of age-related metabolic risk factors. The presence of MS increases the likelihood of developing atherosclerosis and significantly raises the morbidity/mortality rate of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) patients. Early detection of MS is crucial, and biomarkers, particularly blood-based, play a vital role in this process. This cross-sectional study focused on the investigation of certain plasma ceramides (Cer14:0, Cer16:0, Cer18:0, Cer20:0, Cer22:0, and Cer24:1) as potential blood biomarkers for MS due to their previously documented dysregulated function in MS patients. A total of 695 ACS patients were enrolled, with 286 diagnosed with MS (ACS-MS) and 409 without MS (ACS-nonMS) serving as the control group. Plasma ceramide concentrations were measured by LC-MS/MS assay and analyzed through various statistical methods. The results revealed that Cer18:0, Cer20:0, Cer22:0, and Cer24:1 were significantly correlated with the presence of MS risk factors. Upon further examination, Cer18:0 emerged as a promising biomarker for early MS detection and risk stratification, as its plasma concentration showed a significant sensitivity to minor changes in MS risk status in participants. This cross-sectional observational study was a secondary analysis of a multicenter prospective observational cohort study (Chinese Clinical Trial Registry, https://www.who.int/clinical-trials-registry-platform/network/primary-registries/chinese-clinical-trial-registry-(chictr), ChiCTR-2200056697), conducted from April 2021 to August 2022."

      "abstract": "Ceramides, crucial sphingolipids in cellular biology, play various roles ranging from structural membrane integrity to signaling pathway regulation. Structurally, a ceramide consists of a fatty acid connected to a sphingoid base. The characteristics of the fatty acid chain, including length and saturation, determine the physiological properties of the ceramide. Ceramides typically fall into the following categories based on chain length: medium, long, very-long, and ultra-long. Among them, two very-long-chain ceramides, Cer(24:1(15Z)) and Cer(24:0), have been extensively studied, and they are known for their regulatory functions. However, the hydrophobic natures of ceramides, arising from their long hydrocarbon chain impedes their solubilities and levels of cellular delivery. Although ω-pyridinium ceramide analogs (ω-PyrCers) have been developed to address this issue, ω-PyrCers with very-long fatty acid chains or unsaturation have not been developed, presumably due to limited access to the corresponding ω-bromo fatty acids required in their syntheses. In this study, we prepared the ω-PyrCers of Cer(24:1(15Z)) and Cer(24:0), PyrCer(24:1(15Z)) and PyrCer(24:0), respectively. The key in the synthesis is the Wittig reaction to prepare the ω-bromo fatty acid with an appropriate chain length and (Z)-double bond position. Preliminary evaluation of the PyrCer(24:1(15Z)) and PyrCer(24:0) revealed their potential in hepatocellular carcinoma treatment.",

However, the mechanism of ceramides regulating cell death in plants remains unclear. Here, we found that ceramides accumulated in mitochondria of accelerated cell death 5 mutant (acd5), and expression of mitochondrion-localized ceramide kinase (ACD5) suppressed mitochondrial ceramide accumulation and the acd5 cell death phenotype. Using immuno-electron microscopy, we observed hyperaccumulation of ceramides in acer acd5 double mutants, which are characterized by mutations in both ACER (alkaline ceramidase) and ACD5 genes. The results confirmed that plants with specific ceramide accumulation exhibited localization of ceramides to mitochondria, resulting in an increase in mitochondrial reactive oxygen species production. Interestingly, when compared with the wild type, autophagy-deficient mutants showed stronger resistance to ceramide-induced cell death. Lipid profiling analysis demonstrated that plants with ceramide accumulation exhibited a significant increase in phosphatidylethanolamine levels. Furthermore, exogenous ceramide treatment or endogenous ceramide accumulation induces autophagy. When exposed to exogenous ceramides, an increase in the level of the autophagy-specific ubiquitin-like protein, ATG8e, associated with mitochondria, where it directly bound to ceramides. Taken together, we propose that the accumulation of ceramides in mitochondria can induce cell death by regulating autophagy.",

Without a functional ATP-binding cassette, sub-family A, member 4 (ABCA4), there is an elevation of all-trans-retinal and prolonged buildup of all-trans-retinal adducts, resulting in a retinal degenerative disease known as Stargardt-1 disease. Even in this monogenic disorder, there is significant heterogeneity in the time to onset of symptoms among patients. Using a combination of molecular techniques, we studied Abca4 knockout (simulating human noncoding disease variants) and Abca4 knock-in mice (simulating human misfolded, catalytically inactive protein variants), which serve as models for Stargardt-1 disease. We compared the two strains to ascertain whether they exhibit differential responses to agents that affect cytokine signaling and/or ceramide metabolism, as alterations in either of these pathways can exacerbate retinal degenerative phenotypes. We found different degrees of responsiveness to maraviroc, a known immunomodulatory CCR5 antagonist, and to the ceramide-lowering agent AdipoRon, an agonist of the ADIPOR1 and ADIPOR2 receptors. The two strains also display different degrees of transcriptional deviation from matched WT controls. Our phenotypic comparison of the two distinct Abca4 mutant-mouse models sheds light on potential therapeutic avenues previously unexplored in the treatment of Stargardt disease and provides a surrogate assay for assessing the effectiveness for genome editing.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease (AD) is associated with hyperphosphorylated tau (pTau) propagation between neurons along synaptically connected networks, in part via extracellular vesicles (EVs). EV biogenesis is triggered by ceramide enrichment at the plasma membrane from neutral sphingomyelinase2 (nSMase2)-mediated cleavage of sphingomyelin. We report, for the first time, that human tau expression elevates brain ceramides and nSMase2 activity. METHODS: To determine the therapeutic benefit of inhibiting this elevation, we evaluated PDDC, the first potent, selective, orally bioavailable, and brain-penetrable nSMase2 inhibitor in the transgenic PS19 AD mouse model. Additionally, we directly evaluated the effect of PDDC on tau propagation in a mouse model where an adeno-associated virus (AAV) encoding P301L/S320F double mutant human tau was stereotaxically-injected unilaterally into the hippocampus. The contralateral transfer of the double mutant human tau to the dentate gyrus was monitored. We examined ceramide levels, histopathological changes, and pTau content within EVs isolated from the mouse plasma. RESULTS: Similar to human AD, the PS19 mice exhibited increased brain ceramide levels and nSMase2 activity; both were completely normalized by PDDC treatment. The PS19 mice also exhibited elevated tau immunostaining, thinning of hippocampal neuronal cell layers, increased mossy fiber synaptophysin immunostaining, and glial activation, all of which were pathologic features of human AD. PDDC treatment reduced these changes. The plasma of PDDC-treated PS19 mice had reduced levels of neuronal- and microglial-derived EVs, the former carrying lower pTau levels, compared to untreated mice. In the tau propagation model, PDDC normalized the tau-induced increase in brain ceramides and significantly reduced the amount of tau propagation to the contralateral side. CONCLUSIONS: PDDC is a first-in-class therapeutic candidate that normalizes elevated brain ceramides and nSMase2 activity, leading to the slowing of tau spread in AD mice.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Elevated plasma ceramides and microvascular dysfunction both independently predict adverse cardiac events. Despite the known detrimental effects of ceramide on the microvasculature, evidence suggests that activation of the shear-sensitive, ceramide-forming enzyme NSmase (neutral sphingomyelinase) elicits formation of vasoprotective nitric oxide (NO). Here, we explore a novel hypothesis that acute ceramide formation through NSmase is necessary for maintaining NO signaling within the human microvascular endothelium. We further define the mechanism through which ceramide exerts beneficial effects and discern key mechanistic differences between arterioles from otherwise healthy adults (non-coronary artery disease [CAD]) and patients diagnosed with CAD. METHODS: Human arterioles were dissected from discarded surgical adipose tissue (n=166), and vascular reactivity to flow and C2-ceramide was assessed. Shear-induced NO and mitochondrial hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production were measured in arterioles using fluorescence microscopy. H2O2 fluorescence was assessed in isolated human umbilical vein endothelial cells. RESULTS: Inhibition of NSmase in arterioles from otherwise healthy adults induced a switch from NO to NOX-2 (NADPH-oxidase 2)-dependent H2O2-mediated flow-induced dilation. Endothelial dysfunction was prevented by treatment with sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) and partially prevented by C2-ceramide and an agonist of S1P-receptor 1 (S1PR1); the inhibition of the S1P/S1PR1 signaling axis induced endothelial dysfunction via NOX-2. Ceramide increased NO production in arterioles from non-CAD adults, an effect that was diminished with inhibition of S1P/S1PR1/S1P-receptor 3 signaling. In arterioles from patients with CAD, inhibition of NSmase impaired the overall ability to induce mitochondrial H2O2 production and subsequently dilate to flow, an effect not restored with exogenous S1P. Acute ceramide administration to arterioles from patients with CAD promoted H2O2 as opposed to NO production, an effect dependent on S1P-receptor 3 signaling. CONCLUSION: These data suggest that despite differential downstream signaling between health and disease, NSmase-mediated ceramide formation is necessary for proper functioning of the human microvascular endothelium. Therapeutic strategies that aim to significantly lower ceramide formation may prove detrimental to the microvasculature.",

Taurine is also present in the skin and is involved in maintaining skin homeostasis by exerting osmoregulatory and antioxidant effects. Previous studies have indicated that taurine treatment is effective against age-, ultraviolet- or detergent-induced skin dysfunction. To determine the mechanism responsible for the beneficial actions of taurine in the skin, the present study aimed to evaluate the effects of taurine on epidermal components (ceramides and filaggrin) and on the dermal extracellular matrix, in three-dimensionally (3D) cultured epidermis and dermal fibroblasts, respectively. These cells were cultured in the presence of 3-50 mM taurine, and cells or culture medium were collected for analysis. The effects of taurine on transepidermal water loss (TEWL) in the skin and the expression of inflammatory cytokines, including IL-1α, IL-1β and IL-1 receptor antagonist, were investigated in acetone-treated 3D-cultured epidermis using a Tewameter and reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR), respectively. The mRNA expression levels of MMP-1 and hyaluronic acid (HA) production were measured in skin dermal fibroblasts using RT-qPCR and ELISA, respectively. Taurine was found to suppress acetone-induced elevation in TEWL in 3D-cultured epidermis. Taurine also stimulated the mRNA expression of ceramide synthase 4 and filaggrin, a major structural protein in the stratum corneum, in 3D-cultured epidermis. In skin dermal fibroblasts, taurine inhibited the IL-1α-stimulated mRNA and protein expression of MMP-1. In addition, taurine treatment increased HA synthase-2 mRNA expression and in turn HA production. Results from the present study suggest that the protective effect of taurine on the skin is associated with the enhancement of epidermal barrier component expression and modulation of dermal extracellular matrix metabolism."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Specific ceramides have been identified as risk markers for cardiovascular disease (CVD) years before onset of disease. Treatment with the glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1RA) liraglutide has been shown to induce beneficial changes in the lipid profile and reduce the risk of CVD. Reducing lipotoxic lipids with an antidiabetic drug therapy could be a path towards precision medicine approaches for the treatment of complications to diabetes. In this post-hoc study, an investigation was carried out on the effect of liraglutide on CVD-risk associated ceramides in two randomized clinical trials including participants with type 2 diabetes (T2D). METHODS: This study analyzed plasma samples from two independent randomized placebo-controlled clinical trials. The first trial, Antiproteinuric Effects of Liraglutide Treatment (LirAlbu12) followed a crossover design where 27 participants were treated for 12 weeks with either liraglutide (1.8 mg/d) or placebo, followed by a four-week washout period, and then another 12 weeks of the other treatment. The second clinical trial, Effect of Liraglutide on Vascular Inflammation in Type-2 Diabetes (LiraFlame26), lasted for 26 weeks and followed a parallel design, where 102 participants were randomized 1:1 to either liraglutide or placebo. Heresix prespecified plasma ceramides were measured using liquid chromatography mass spectrometry and assessed their changes using linear mixed models. Possible confounders were assessed with mediation analyses. RESULTS: In the LiraFlame26 trial, 26-week treatment with liraglutide resulted in a significant reduction of two ceramides associated with CVD risk, C16 Cer and C24:1 Cer (p < 0.05) compared to placebo. None of the remaining ceramides showed statistically significant changes in response to liraglutide treatment compared to placebo. Significant changes in ceramides were not found after 12-weeks of liraglutide treatment in the LirAlbu12 trial. Mediation analyses showed that weight loss did not affect ceramide reduction. CONCLUSIONS: It was demonstrated that treatment with liraglutide resulted in a reduction in C16 Cer and C24:1 Cer after 26 weeks of treatment. These findings suggest the GLP-1RA can be used to modulate ceramides in addition to its other properties. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinicaltrial.gov identifier: NCT02545738 and NCT03449654.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease (AD) is associated with prion-like tau propagation between neurons along synaptically connected networks, in part via extracellular vesicles (EV). EV biogenesis is triggered by ceramide enrichment at the plasma membrane from neutral sphingomyelinase2(nSMase2)-mediated cleavage of sphingomyelin. We report, for the first time, that tau expression triggers an elevation in brain ceramides and nSMase2 activity. METHODS: To determine the therapeutic benefit of inhibiting this elevation, we evaluated the efficacy of PDDC, the first potent, selective, orally bioavailable, and brain-penetrable nSMase2 inhibitor, in the PS19 tau transgenic AD murine model. Changes in brain ceramide and sphingomyelin levels, Tau content, histopathology, and nSMase2 target engagement were monitored, as well as changes in the number of brain-derived EVs in plasma and their Tau content. Additionally, we evaluated the ability of PDDC to impede tau propagation in a murine model where an adeno-associated virus(AAV) encoding for P301L/S320F double mutant human tau was stereotaxically-injected unilaterally into the hippocampus and the contralateral transfer to the dentate gyrus was monitored. RESULTS: Similar to human AD, PS19 mice exhibited increased brain ceramides and nSMase2 activity; both were completely normalized by PDDC treatment. PS19 mice exhibited elevated tau immunostaining, thinning of hippocampal neuronal cell layers, increased mossy fiber synaptophysin immunostaining, and glial activation, all pathologic features of human AD. PDDC treatment significantly attenuated these aberrant changes. Mouse plasma isolated from PDDC-treated PS19 mice exhibited reduced levels of neuron- and microglia-derived EVs, the former carrying lower phosphorylated Tau(pTau) levels, compared to untreated mice. In the AAV tau propagation model, PDDC normalized the tau-induced increase in brain ceramides and significantly decreased tau spreading to the contralateral side. CONCLUSIONS: PDDC is a first-in-class therapeutic candidate that normalizes elevated brain ceramides and nSMase2 activity leading to the slowing of tau spread in AD mice."

The CASPID study utilizes two longitudinal cohorts - the Pathobiology of Prediabetes in a Biracial Cohort (POP-ABC)/Pathobiology and Reversibility of Prediabetes in a Biracial Cohort (PROP-ABC) and the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP)/DPP Outcomes Study (DPPOS). Normoglycemic POP-ABC/PROP-ABC were followed for 10 years for progression to prediabetes and offered lifestyle intervention to reverse prediabetes. The DPP/DPPOS participants had prediabetes at enrollment, were randomized to placebo, lifestyle intervention, or metformin treatment, and followed for 11 years for progression to T2DM. Using a case-control design, we analyze 76 targeted plasma sphingolipids as predictors of progression from NGR to prediabetes (Aim 1), prediabetes to T2DM (Aim 2), response to interventions (Aim 3), and development of diabetes complications (Aim 4). A sample size of 600 subjects provides >80% power to detect a 20% difference in sphingolipid profiles between comparison groups (alpha = 0.01). At enrollment, POP-ABC participants had a mean age of 47.7 ± 9.00 years, body mass index (BMI) 30.4 ± 6.10 kg/m2, fasting glucose 92.9 ± 6.90 mg/dL, and 2-h glucose 130 ± 28.8 mg/dL; DPP participants had a mean age of 51.9 ± 9.44 years, BMI 33.7 ± 6.33 kg/m2, fasting glucose 106 ± 7.88 mg/dL, and 2-h glucose 164 ± 16.9 mg/dL. Among normoglycemic participants, those with parental history of T2DM had significantly higher baseline levels of total sphingomyelins, and lower levels of total ceramides and sphingosine, compared with control subjects without familial diabetes history. As the first such study in longitudinal human cohorts, CASPID will elucidate the role of sphingolipids in the pathogenesis of dysglycemia and facilitate the discovery of novel predictive and prognostic biomarkers.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The common inflammatory disease multiple sclerosis (MS) is a disease of the central nervous system. For more than 25 years autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (AHSCT) has been used to treat MS. It has been shown to be highly effective in suppressing inflammatory activity in relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) patients. This treatment is thought to lead to an immune system reset, inducing a new, more tolerant system; however, the precise mechanism behind the treatment effect in MS patients is unknown. In this study, the effect of AHSCT on the metabolome and lipidome in peripheral blood from RRMS patients was investigated. METHODS: Peripheral blood samples were collected from 16 patients with RRMS at ten-time points over the five months course of AHSCT and 16 MS patients not treated with AHSCT. Metabolomics and lipidomics analysis were performed using liquid-chromatography high-resolution mass spectrometry. Mixed linear models, differential expression analysis, and cluster analysis were used to identify differentially expressed features and groups of features that could be of interest. Finally, in-house and in-silico libraries were used for feature identification, and enrichment analysis was performed. RESULTS: Differential expression analysis found 657 features in the lipidomics dataset and 34 in the metabolomics dataset to be differentially expressed throughout AHSCT. The administration of cyclophosphamide during mobilization and conditioning was associated with decreased concentrations in glycerophosphoinositol species. Thymoglobuline administration was associated with an increase in ceramide and glycerophosphoethanolamine species. After the conditioning regimen, a decrease in glycerosphingoidlipids concentration was observed, and following hematopoietic stem cell reinfusion glycerophosphocholine concentrations decreased for a short period of time. Ceramide concentrations were strongly associated with leukocyte levels during the procedure. The ceramides Cer(d19:1/14:0) and Cer(d20:1/12:0) were found to be increased (P < .05) in concentration at the three-month follow-up compared to baseline. C16 ceramide, Cer(D18:2/16:0), and CerPE(d16:2(4E,6E)/22:0) were found to be significantly increased in concentration after AHSCT compared to prior to treatment as well as compared to newly diagnosed RRMS patients. CONCLUSION: AHSCT had a larger impact on the lipids in peripheral blood compared to metabolites. The variation in lipid concentration reflects the transient changes in the peripheral blood milieu during the treatment, rather than the changes in the immune system that are assumed to be the cause of clinical improvement within RRMS patients treated with AHSCT. Ceramide concentrations were affected by AHSCT and associated with leukocyte counts and were altered three months after treatment, suggesting a long-lasting effect.",

      "abstract": "Different studies corroborate a role for ceramide synthases and their downstream products, ceramides, in modulation of apoptosis and autophagy in the context of cancer. These mechanisms of regulation, however, appear to be context dependent in terms of ceramides' fatty acid chain length, subcellular localization, and the presence or absence of their downstream targets. Our current understanding of the role of ceramide synthases and ceramides in regulation of apoptosis and autophagy could be harnessed to pioneer the development of new treatments to activate or inhibit a single type of ceramide synthase, thereby regulating the apoptosis induction or cross talk of apoptosis and autophagy in cancer cells. Moreover, the apoptotic function of ceramide suggests that ceramide analogues can pave the way for the development of novel cancer treatments. Therefore, in the current review paper we discuss the impact of ceramide synthases and ceramides in regulation of apoptosis and autophagy in context of different types of cancers. We also briefly introduce the latest information on ceramide synthase inhibitors, their application in diseases including cancer therapy, and discuss approaches for drug discovery in the field of ceramide synthase inhibitors. We finally discussed strategies for developing strategies to use lipids and ceramides analysis in biological fluids for developing early biomarkers for cancer.",

      "abstract": "A key requirement in forming the water permeability barrier in the mammalian epidermis is the oxidation of linoleate esterified in a skin-specific acylceramide by the sequential actions of 12R-lipoxygenase, epidermal lipoxygenase-3, and the epoxyalcohol dehydrogenase SDR9C7 (short-chain dehydrogenase-reductase family 7 member 9). By mechanisms that remain unclear, this oxidation pathway promotes the covalent binding of ceramides to protein, forming a critical structure of the epidermal barrier, the corneocyte lipid envelope. Here, we detected, in porcine, mouse, and human epidermis, two novel fatty acid derivatives formed by KOH treatment from precursors covalently bound to protein: a \"polar\" lipid chromatographing on normal-phase HPLC just before omega-hydroxy ceramide and a \"less polar\" lipid nearer the solvent front. Approximately 100 μg of the novel lipids were isolated from porcine epidermis, and the structures were established by UV-spectroscopy, LC-MS, GC-MS, and NMR. Each is a C18 fatty acid and hydroxy-cyclohexenone with the ring on carbons C9-C14 in the polar lipid and C8-C13 in the less polar lipid. Overnight culture of [14C]linoleic acid with whole mouse skin ex vivo led to recovery of the 14C-labeled hydroxy-cyclohexenones. We deduce they are formed from covalently bound precursors during the KOH treatment used to release esterified lipids. KOH-induced intramolecular aldol reactions from a common precursor can account for their formation. Discovery of these hydroxy-cyclohexenones presents an opportunity for a reverse pathway analysis, namely to work back from these structures to identify their covalently bound precursors and relationship to the linoleate oxidation pathway.",

Ceramides are involved in atherosclerosis progression, cardiovascular events, and renal damage. Almost no studies have been conducted on the relationship between ceramide concentrations and AKI events. Therefore, we evaluated the association between plasma ceramide level at admission and AKI in patients with ACS undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention. METHODS: We enrolled 842 ACS patients from the Prospective Multicenter Study for Early Evaluation of Acute Chest Pain. AKI was defined using the criteria from the 2012 Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes. Eleven C16-C26 ceramides were measured using the high-performance liquid chromatography interfaced to tandem mass spectrometer procedure. Logistic regression models were used to evaluate relationships between ceramides and AKI risk. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC) was used to evaluate differences between ceramides. RESULTS: Overall, 139 (16.5%) patients developed AKI during hospitalisation. Patients who developed AKI had higher levels of Cer(d18:1/16:0), Cer(d18:1/18:0), Cer(d18:1/20:0), Cer(d18:1/21:0), Cer(d18:1/24:1), and Cer(d18:1/24:2) than patients who did not (P < 0.05). In risk-factor adjusted logistic regression models, these ceramides were independently associated with AKI risk (P < 0.05). Cer(d18:1/24:2) had the highest odds ratio of 3.503 (Q4 vs. Q1, 95% confidence interval: 1.743-7.040, P < 0.001). Ceramides had AUCs of 0.581-0.661 (P < 0.001) for AKI. Each ceramide combined with the Mehran risk score (AUC: 0.780) had AUCs of 0.802-0.808, greater than the Mehran risk score alone. CONCLUSION: Long-chain and very-long-chain ceramide levels may help determine the high AKI risk beyond traditional assessments.",

We determined the effects of Fenretinide on LDLR-/- mice fed high-fat/high-cholesterol diet ± Fenretinide, a model of atherosclerosis and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Fenretinide prevented obesity, improved insulin sensitivity and completely inhibited hepatic triglyceride accumulation, ballooning and steatosis. Moreover, Fenretinide decreased the expression of hepatic genes driving NAFLD, inflammation and fibrosis e.g. Hsd17b13, Cd68 and Col1a1. The mechanisms of Fenretinide's beneficial effects in association with decreased adiposity were mediated by inhibition of ceramide synthesis, via hepatic DES1 protein, leading to increased dihydroceramide precursors. However, Fenretinide treatment in LDLR-/- mice enhanced circulating triglycerides and worsened aortic plaque formation. Interestingly, Fenretinide led to a fourfold increase in hepatic sphingomyelinase Smpd3 expression, via a retinoic acid-mediated mechanism and a further increase in circulating ceramide levels, linking induction of ceramide generation via sphingomyelin hydrolysis to a novel mechanism of increased atherosclerosis. Thus, despite beneficial metabolic effects, Fenretinide treatment may under certain circumstances enhance the development of atherosclerosis. However, targeting both DES1 and Smpd3 may be a novel, more potent therapeutic approach for the treatment of metabolic syndrome.",

The study of this disease and the underlying biological mechanism is gaining momentum. Multiple pieces of conclusive evidence show that ceramides are involved in the occurrence and development of diabetes. The present review focuses on the function of ceramides, a type of sphingolipid signaling molecule, to provide a brief description of ceramides and their metabolism, discuss the significant roles of ceramides in the healthy skin barrier, and speculate on the potential involvement of ceramides in the pathogenesis and development of diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs). Understanding these aspects of this disease more thoroughly is crucial to establish how ceramides contribute to the etiology of diabetic foot infections and identify possible therapeutic targets for the treatment of DFUs.",

      "abstract": "Autoimmune rheumatic diseases (AIRDs) constitute a set of connective tissue disorders and dysfunctions with akin clinical manifestations and autoantibody responses. AIRD treatment is based on a comprehensive approach, with the primary aim being achieving and attaining disease remission, through the control of inflammation. AIRD therapies have a low target specificity, and this usually propels metabolic disturbances, dyslipidemias and increased cardiovascular risk. Ceramides are implicated in inflammation through several different pathways, many of which sometimes intersect. They serve as signaling molecules for apoptosis, altering immune response and driving endothelial dysfunction and as regulators in the production of other molecules, including sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) and ceramide 1-phosphate (C1P). With lipid metabolism being severely altered in AIRD pathology, several studies show that the concentration and variety of ceramides in human tissues is altered in patients with rheumatic diseases compared to controls. As a result, many in vitro and some in vivo (animal) studies research the potential use of ceramides as therapeutic targets in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), ankylosing spondylitis, systemic lupus erythematosus, fibromyalgia syndrome, primary Sjögren's syndrome, systemic sclerosis, myositis, systemic vasculitis and psoriatic arthritis. Furthermore, the majority of ceramide synthesis is diet-centric and, as a result, dietary interventions may alter ceramide concentrations in the blood and affect health. Subsequently, more recently several clinical trials evaluated the possibility of distinct dietary patterns and nutrients to act as anti-ceramide regimes in humans. With nutrition being an important component of AIRD-related complications, the present review details the evidence regarding ceramide levels in patients with AIRDs, the results of anti-ceramide treatments and discusses the possibility of using medical nutritional therapy as a complementary anti-ceramide treatment in rheumatic disease.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Cancer patients who exhibit cachexia lose weight and have low treatment tolerance and poor outcomes compared to cancer patients without weight loss. Despite the clear increased risk for patients, diagnosing cachexia still often relies on self-reported weight loss. A reliable biomarker to identify patients with cancer cachexia would be a valuable tool to improve clinical decision making and identification of patients at risk of adverse outcomes. METHODS: Targeted metabolomics, that included panels of amino acids, tricarboxylic acids, fatty acids, acylcarnitines, and sphingolipids, were conducted on plasma samples from patients with confirmed pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) with and without cachexia and control patients without cancer (n=10/group, equally divided by sex). Additional patient samples were analyzed (total n=95) and Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analyses were performed to establish if any metabolite could effectively serve as a biomarker of cachexia. RESULTS: Targeted profiling revealed that cachectic patients had decreased circulating levels of three sphingolipids compared to either non-cachectic PDAC patients or patients without cancer. The ratio of C18-ceramide to C24-ceramide (C18:C24) outperformed a number of other previously proposed biomarkers of cachexia (area under ROC = 0.810). It was notable that some biomarkers, including C18:C24, were only altered in cachectic males. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings identify C18:C24 as a potentially new biomarker of PDAC-induced cachexia that also highlight a previously unappreciated sexual dimorphism in cancer cachexia."

      "abstract": "Acid sphingomyelinase (Asm) and acid ceramidase (Ac) are parts of the sphingolipid metabolism. Asm hydrolyzes sphingomyelin to ceramide, which is further metabolized to sphingosine by Ac. Ceramide generates ceramide-enriched platforms that are involved in receptor clustering within cellular membranes. However, the impact of cell-intrinsic ceramide on T cell function is not well characterized. By using T cell-specific Asm- or Ac-deficient mice, with reduced or elevated ceramide levels in T cells, we identified ceramide to play a crucial role in T cell function in vitro and in vivo. T cell-specific ablation of Asm in Smpd1fl/fl/Cd4cre/+ (Asm/CD4cre) mice resulted in enhanced tumor progression associated with impaired T cell responses, whereas Asah1fl/fl/Cd4cre/+ (Ac/CD4cre) mice showed reduced tumor growth rates and elevated T cell activation compared to the respective controls upon tumor transplantation. Further in vitro analysis revealed that decreased ceramide content supports CD4+ regulatory T cell differentiation and interferes with cytotoxic activity of CD8+ T cells. In contrast, elevated ceramide concentration in CD8+ T cells from Ac/CD4cre mice was associated with enhanced cytotoxic activity. Strikingly, ceramide co-localized with the T cell receptor (TCR) and CD3 in the membrane of stimulated T cells and phosphorylation of TCR signaling molecules was elevated in Ac-deficient T cells. Hence, our results indicate that modulation of ceramide levels, by interfering with the Asm or Ac activity has an effect on T cell differentiation and function and might therefore represent a novel therapeutic strategy for the treatment of T cell-dependent diseases such as tumorigenesis.",

The results indicated that the mean life span of Cers-treated C. elegans were dose-dependent in the range of 0.10-0.50 mg/mL. Additionally, Cers improved nematode motility, reduced lipofuscin accumulation, and enhanced resistance to heat stress and antioxidant enzyme activity. Genetic studies showed that Cers treatment had altered nematode gene expression. In addition, insulin/IGF-1 and jnk-1/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways successfully demonstrated the longevity effects of Cers intake. In short, these results suggest that Cers enhance the resistance of C. elegans and prolong its life span.",

      "abstract": "CONTEXT: Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is a complex disorder in which metabolic abnormalities are associated with reproductive dysfunction. Women with PCOS have increased ceramide concentrations. Previous studies demonstrated that treating metabolic abnormalities of PCOS with metformin improved glucose effectiveness after 12 weeks. OBJECTIVE: We evaluated whether, in women with PCOS, lower baseline ceramide, diacylglycerol (DAG), and triacylglycerol (TAG) concentrations were associated with improved metabolic response to metformin. METHODS: Women (n = 29), aged 29 ± 5 years and diagnosed with PCOS by the NIH criteria underwent an intravenous glucose tolerance test (IVGTT) before and after 12-week treatment with metformin (1500 mg per day). Metabolic responders were defined by improved glucose effectiveness, specifically, the ability of glucose to stimulate uptake and suppress production, after metformin treatment. RESULTS: Twelve weeks of metformin resulted in weight loss (-1.7 ± 2.6 kg, P < 0.01) and a reduction in BMI (-0.6 ± 0.9 kg/m2, P < 0.01) with no change in HbA1c. The concentrations of Cer(d18:1/22:0), Cer(d18:1/24:0), total ceramides, total Cer(d16:0), total Cer(d18:2), DAG, dihydrosphingomyelin (DHSM), and TAG decreased after metformin treatment (P < 0.05). Baseline total Cer(d16:0) concentration <204.1 pmol/mL was 82% sensitive (AUC 0.72, P = 0.03) and total DHSM concentration <32237 pmol/mL was 100% specific (AUC 0.73, P = 0.03) in predicting improved metabolic response to metformin, as measured by IVGTT. CONCLUSION: Lower total Cer(16:0) and DHSM concentrations are associated with a beneficial metabolic response to metformin in women with PCOS. Based on the known association between higher ceramide levels and type 2 diabetes, the data suggest that metformin improves metabolic parameters in women with mild metabolic derangements."

      "abstract": "One of the classic hallmarks of cancer is the imbalance between elevated cell proliferation and reduced cell death. Ceramide, a bioactive sphingolipid that can regulate this balance, has long been implicated in cancer. While the effects of ceramide on cell death and therapeutic efficacy are well established, emerging evidence indicates that ceramide turnover to downstream sphingolipids, such as sphingomyelin, hexosylceramides, sphingosine-1-phosphate, and ceramide-1-phosphate, is equally important in driving pro-tumorigenic phenotypes, such as proliferation, survival, migration, stemness, and therapy resistance. The complex and dynamic sphingolipid network has been extensively studied in several cancers, including breast cancer, to find key sphingolipidomic alterations that can be exploited to develop new therapeutic strategies to improve patient outcomes. Here, we review how the current literature shapes our understanding of how ceramide synthesis and turnover are altered in breast cancer and how these changes offer potential strategies to improve breast cancer therapy.",

As obesity progresses, certain ceramide molecular species accumulate in metabolic tissues and cause cell-type-specific lipotoxic reactions that disrupt metabolic homeostasis and lead to the development of cardiometabolic diseases. Several mechanisms for ceramide action have been inferred from studies in vitro, but only recently have we begun to better understand the acyl chain length specificity of ceramide-mediated signaling in the context of physiology and disease in vivo. New discoveries show that specific ceramides affect various metabolic pathways and that global or tissue-specific reduction in selected ceramide pools in obese rodents is sufficient to improve metabolic health. Here, we review the tissue-specific regulation and functions of ceramides in obesity, thus highlighting the emerging concept of selectively inhibiting production or action of ceramides with specific acyl chain lengths as novel therapeutic strategies to ameliorate obesity-associated diseases.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: assessing cardiovascular and mortality risk with conventional biomarkers is challenging in oldest-old due to multimorbidity and polypharmacy. Ceramides are bioactive lipids shown to predict mortality in late middle-aged cohorts. OBJECTIVE: to assess whether plasma ceramides have independent prognostic value for mortality among oldest-old (85+). DESIGN: longitudinal cohort study (Helsinki Businessmen Study, HBS) with a 3.5-year follow-up. SETTING AND SUBJECTS: survivors of HBS (125 men born in 1919-1934) visited the clinic for laboratory and clinical examination. METHODS: functional status including physical (short physical performance battery) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) cognitive performance was assessed and laboratory examinations included a large set of biomarkers. Plasma ceramide concentration (Cer(d18:1/16:0)) was measured using a targeted liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry assay. Mortality was retrieved from national registers. RESULTS: median age was 88 years, two-thirds had multimorbidity and 59% were on statin treatment. During the follow-up, 22 (18%) men died. In a model adjusted for variables associated with mortality in the whole cohort at P < 0.20 (log glucose, SPPB, MoCA and statin use), Cer(d18:1/16:0) as a continuous trait was associated with increased mortality: hazard ratio (HR) per 1 SD 1.64 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.23-2.18). Compared with the bottom tertile of Cer(d18:1/16:0), HR of mortality was 5.44-fold (95% CI 1.17-25.3) in the top tertile. CONCLUSIONS: these data raise the hypothesis that plasma ceramide concentrations and especially Cer(d18:1/1:60) may offer a clinically useful biomarker to evaluate prognosis in very old age. Such biomarkers are needed for geriatrics, where multimorbidity and pharmacotherapies, such as statins are prevalent hampering assessment of prognosis using conventional methods.",

      "abstract": "Metabolic syndrome increases risk of complicating co-morbidities. Current clinical indicators reflect established metabolic impairment, preventing earlier intervention strategies. Here we show that circulating sphingolipids are altered in the very early stages of insulin resistance development. The study involved 16 paired overweight but healthy monkeys, one-half of which spontaneously developed metabolic syndrome over the course of 2 years. Importantly, animals did not differ in adiposity and were euglycemic throughout the study period. Using mass spectrometry, circulating sphingolipids, including ceramides and sphingomyelins, were detected and quantified for healthy and impaired animals at both time points. At time of diagnosis, several ceramides were significantly different between healthy and impaired animals. Correlation analysis revealed differences in the interactions among ceramides in impaired animals at diagnosis and pre-diagnosis when animals were clinically indistinguishable from controls. Furthermore, correlations between ceramides and early-stage markers of insulin resistance, diacylglycerols and non-esterified fatty acids, were distinct for healthy and impaired states. Regression analysis identifies coordinated changes in lipid handling across lipid classes as animals progress from healthy to insulin resistant. Correlations between ceramides and the adipose-derived adipokine adiponectin were apparent in healthy animals but not in the metabolically impaired animals, even in advance of loss in insulin sensitivity. These data suggest that circulating ceramides are clinically relevant in identifying disease risk independent of differences in adiposity, and may be important in devising preventative strategies.",

The drug FTY720 mimics S1P bioactivity, but its efficacy in treating AD is unclear. Two doses of FTY720 (0.1 mg / kg and 0.5 mg / kg daily) were given by oral gavage for 15 weeks to transgenic mouse models of familial AD carrying human apolipoprotein E (APOE) APOE3 (E3FAD) or APOE4 (E4FAD). After 12 weeks of treatment, animals were subjected to behavioral tests for memory, locomotion, and anxiety. Blood was withdrawn at different time points and brains were collected for sphingolipids analysis by mass spectrometry, gene expression by RT-PCR and Aβ quantification by ELISA. We discovered that low levels of S1P in the plasma is associated with a higher probability of failing the memory test and that FTY720 prevents memory impairments in E4FAD. The beneficial effect of FTY720 was induced by a shift of the sphingolipid metabolism in the brain towards a lower production of toxic metabolites, like ceramide d18:1/16:0 and d18:1/22:0, and reduction of amyloid-β burden and inflammation. In conclusion, we provide further evidence of the druggability of the sphingolipid system in AD.",

In general, pre-menopausal women tend to have a better prognosis than men. Explaining why this occurs is not a simple matter. For decades, sex hormones like estrogens (Es) have been identified as one of the leading factors driving these sex differences. Indeed, Es seem protective in women as their decline, during and after menopause, coincides with an increased CV risk and HF development. However, clinical trials demonstrated that E replacement in post-menopause women results in adverse cardiac events and increased risk of breast cancer. Thus, a deeper understanding of E-related mechanisms is needed to provide a vital gateway toward better CVD prevention and treatment in women. Of note, sphingolipids (SLs) and their metabolism are strictly related to E activities. Among the SLs, ceramide and sphingosine 1-phosphate play essential roles in mammalian physiology, particularly in the CV system, and appear differently modulated in males and females. In keeping with this view, here we explore the most recent experimental and clinical observations about the role of E and SL metabolism, emphasizing how these factors impact the CV system.",

      "abstract": "Ceramides and phosphatidylcholines (PCs) are bioactive lipids and lipid bilayer membrane components. Distinct ceramides/PCs (ratios) predict cardiovascular outcome in patients with coronary artery disease. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are proposed biomarkers for cardiovascular disease and contain ceramides/PCs. Ceramides/PCs have not been studied in patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy (CEA) nor in EVs. We therefore investigated whether levels of ceramides/PCs in plasma and EVs are associated with postoperative risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) following CEA. In 873 patients undergoing CEA of the Athero-Express biobank, we quantitatively measured seven ceramides/PCs in preoperative blood samples: Cer(d18:1/16:0), Cer(d18:1/18:0), Cer(d18:1/24:0), Cer(d18:1/24:1), PC(14:0/22:6), PC(16:0/16:0) and PC(16:0/22:5) in plasma and two plasma EV-subfractions (LDL and TEX). We analyzed the association of ceramides, PCs and their predefined ratios with the three-year postoperative risk of MACE (including stroke, myocardial infarction and cardiovascular death). A total of 138 patients (16%) developed MACE during the three-year follow-up. In the LDL-EV subfraction, higher levels of Cer(d18:1/24:1) and Cer(d18:1/16:0)/PC(16:0/22:5) ratio were significantly associated with an increased risk of MACE (adjusted HR per SD [95% CI] 1.24 [1.01-1.53] and 1.26 [1.04-1.52], respectively). In the TEX-EV subfraction, three ratios Cer(d18:1/16:0)/Cer(d18:1/24:0), Cer(d18:1/18:0)/Cer(d18:1/24:0) and Cer(d18:1/24:1)/Cer(d18:1/24:0) were positively associated with MACE (adjusted HR per SD 1.34 [1.06-1.70], 1.24 [1.01-1.51] and 1.31 [1.08-1.58], respectively). In conclusion, distinct ceramides and PCs in plasma EVs determined in preoperative blood were independently associated with an increased 3-year risk of MACE after CEA. These lipids are therefore potential markers to identify high-risk CEA patients qualifying for secondary preventive add-on therapy.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory skin disorder. Oral or subcutaneous methotrexate (MTX) is a first-line antipsoriatic treatment, whose adverse effects can be observed even at low doses. To minimize systemic side effects, antipsoriatic drugs should be administered topically, since they could permeate the stratum corneum. As liquid crystals with lamellar phase (LP) can be helpful in promoting skin permeation, this work evaluated two MTX-loaded LPs (C1CH and C1CHCE), based on stearic acid, cholesterol and ceramides, like topical treatments for mice with imiquimod-induced psoriasis. METHODS: C1CH and C1CHCE were topically administered to mice with imiquimod-induced psoriasis. Dexamethasone cream was used as positive treatment control. Skin histology and inflammation biomarkers were assessed. KEY FINDINGS: C1CH and C1CHCE exhibited marked immunomodulatory effects and induced extensive microstructural skin remodelling on the epidermis and dermis. These formulations increased keratinization score, epidermis thickness, inflammatory infiltrate, hair follicle hypertrophy and vascular congestion in the dermis. C1CH and C1CHCE also attenuated IL-10 upregulation and upregulated IL-1, IFN-γ, TNF-α and prostaglandin E2 levels, as well as myeloperoxidase, N-acetyl-β-d-glucosaminidase and cyclooxygenase 2 activity compared with untreated psoriatic animals. CONCLUSION: Although liquid crystals have been reported as good options for carrying topical drugs, they need to be carefully assessed on a case-by-case basis.",

The lesion was very painful and had a negative impact on the patient's sleep and mood. Following the initial surgical debridement and treatment with collagenase ointment, the wound showed delayed healing, an increase in necrotic tissue, and purulent discharge, requiring a second surgical debridement that revealed a deeper involvement of the wound. After a month with poor therapeutic response, it was decided to change the treatment to the application of gauzes embedded in an ointment rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), ceramides, and antimicrobial peptides, Curefini® ointment. After 30 days of treatment, a 50% reduction of the initial wound diameter was obtained with a positive impact on the patient's quality of life, together with a reduction of incidental and spontaneous local pain resulting in better night rest and a return of appetite and strength. During the treatment course, the patient did not suffer any local or systemic infection in connection with the wound. After one month, the patient could discontinue the use of opioid analgesics. A 95% closure of the lesion was achieved in 45 days. This case highlights the therapeutic efficacy of the treatment of cavitated wounds with a product based on natural ingredients that helps reduce pain and promotes granulation and reepithelialization."

      "abstract": "Variants in multiple lysosomal enzymes increase Parkinson's disease (PD) risk, including the genes encoding glucocerebrosidase (GCase), acid sphingomyelinase (ASMase) and galactosylceramidase. Each of these enzymes generates ceramide by hydrolysis of sphingolipids in lysosomes, but the role of this common pathway in PD pathogenesis has not yet been explored. Variations in GBA1, the gene encoding GCase, are the most common genetic risk factor for PD. The lysosomal enzyme cathepsin B has recently been implicated as an important genetic modifier of disease penetrance in individuals harboring GBA1 variants, suggesting a mechanistic link between these enzymes. Here, we found that ceramide activates cathepsin B, and identified a novel role for cathepsin B in mediating prosaposin cleavage to form saposin C, the lysosomal coactivator of GCase. Interestingly, this pathway was disrupted in Parkin-linked PD models, and upon treatment with inhibitor of ASMase which resulted in decreased ceramide production. Conversely, increasing ceramide production by inhibiting acid ceramidase activity was sufficient to upregulate cathepsin B- and saposin C-mediated activation of GCase. These results highlight a mechanistic link between ceramide and cathepsin B in regulating GCase activity and suggest that targeting lysosomal ceramide or cathepsin B represents an important therapeutic strategy for activating GCase in PD and related disorders.",

However, accumulating clinical evidence have shown that ceramides are playing a detrimental role in the pathogenesis of several diseases including cardiovascular disease, type II diabetes and obesity, collectively referred to as cardiometabolic disease. Therefore, it has become necessary to study in depth the role of ceramides in the pathophysiology of such diseases, aiming to tailor more efficient treatment regimens. Furthermore, understanding the contribution of ceramides to the pathological molecular mechanisms of those interrelated conditions may improve not only the therapeutic but also the diagnostic and preventive approaches of the preceding hazardous events. Hence, the purpose of this article is to review currently available evidence on the role of ceramides as a common factor in the pathological mechanisms of cardiometabolic diseases as well as the mechanism of action of the latest ceramides-targeted therapies."

Glucocorticoids are normally employed in the therapeutical management of these pathologies. However, they have shown a poor safety profile and reduced treatment efficiency. The main objective of this review is to, within the framework of the limitations of the currently available therapeutical approaches, establish the relevance of nanocarriers as a safe and efficient delivery strategy for glucocorticoids and ceramides in the topical treatment of skin disorders with barrier impairment."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Pro-apoptotic and pro-inflammatory ceramides are crucially involved in atherosclerotic plaque development. Local cellular ceramide accumulation mediates endothelial apoptosis, especially in type 2 diabetes mellitus, which is a major cardiovascular risk factor. In recent years, large extracellular vesicles (lEVs) have been identified as an important means of intercellular communication and as regulators of cardiovascular health and disease. A potential role for lEVs as vehicles for ceramide transfer and inductors of diabetes-associated endothelial apoptosis has never been investigated. METHODS AND RESULTS: A mass-spectrometric analysis of human coronary artery endothelial cells (HCAECs) and their lEVs revealed C16 ceramide (d18:1-16:0) to be the most abundant ceramide in lEVs and to be significantly increased in lEVs after hyperglycemic injury to HCAECs. The increased packaging of ceramide into lEVs after hyperglycemic injury was shown to be dependent on neutral sphingomyelinase 2 (nSMase2), which was upregulated in glucose-treated HCAECs. lEVs from hyperglycemic HCAECs induced apoptosis in the recipient HCAECs compared to native lEVs from untreated HCAECs. Similarly, lEVs from hyperglycemic mice after streptozotocin injection induced higher rates of apoptosis in murine endothelial cells compared to lEVs from normoglycemic mice. To generate lEVs with high levels of C16 ceramide, ceramide was applied exogenously and shown to be effectively packaged into the lEVs, which then induced apoptosis in lEV-recipient HCAECs via activation of caspase 3. Intercellular transfer of ceramide through lEVs was confirmed by use of a fluorescently labeled ceramide analogue. Treatment of HCAECs with a pharmacological inhibitor of nSMases (GW4869) or siRNA-mediated downregulation of nSMase2 abrogated the glucose-mediated effect on apoptosis in lEV-recipient cells. In contrast, for small EVs (sEVs), hyperglycemic injury or GW4869 treatment had no effect on apoptosis induction in sEV-recipient cells. CONCLUSION: lEVs mediate the induction of apoptosis in endothelial cells in response to hyperglycemic injury through intercellular transfer of ceramides.",

The present study aimed to explore whether disturbed glycolipids metabolism in the nervous system is present in patients with a neuroinflammatory disorder, encephalo-myelo-radiculo-neuropathy (EMRN), because most EMRN patients have been reported to exhibit autoantibodies against neutral glycolipids. Although molecular pathogenesis of this disorder remains unknown, we tried to search the immunochemical abnormalities in this disorder. ELISA for activated peripheral C5 complement and mass spectrometry analysis of cerebrospinal fluid clearly disclosed a significant upregulation of active C5 complement, C5a levels in sera as well as a significant accumulation of species-specific ceramides but not sphingomyelin in cerebrospinal fluid from EMRN patients. Furthermore, we confirmed the occurrence of anti-neutral glycolipids antibodies in all EMRN patients. Thus, the present study might indicate the pathophysiology of this disorder is the dysregulation of glycolipids metabolism and abnormal production of autoantibodies against neutral glycolipids resulting in the abnormal complement activation, although molecular basis for these sphingolipids dysregulation and the occurrence of autoantibodies against glycolipids remains to be elucidated at present. The present study implicates a new therapeutic strategy employing anti-ceramide and/or anti-complement therapy for this disorder.",

Ceramides, which are central components of sphingolipid metabolism, are involved in plant development and defense. However, the mechanistic link between ceramides and downstream signaling remains unclear. Here, the mutation of alkaline ceramidase in a ceramide kinase mutant acd5 resulted in spontaneous programmed cell death early in development and was accompanied by ceramide accumulation, while other types of sphingolipids, such as long chain base, glucosylceramide, and glycosyl inositol phosphorylceramide, remained at the same level as the wild-type plants. Analysis of the transcriptome indicated that genes related to the salicylic acid (SA) pathway and oxidative stress pathway were induced dramatically in acer acd5 plants. Comparison of the level of reactive oxygen species (ROS), SA, and ceramides in the wild-type and acer acd5 plants at different developmental stages indicated that the acer acd5 mutant exhibited constitutive activation of SA and ROS signaling, which occurred simultaneously with the alteration of ceramides. Overexpressing NahG in the acer acd5 mutant could completely suppress its cell death and ceramide accumulation, while benzo-(1,2,3)-thiadiazole-7-carbothioc acid S-methyl ester treatment restored its phenotype again. Moreover, we found that the plasma membrane of acer acd5 mutant was the main site of ROS production. Ceramides accumulated in the plasma membrane of acer acd5, directly binding and activating the NADPH oxidase RbohD and promoting hydrogen peroxide generation and SA- or defense-related gene activation. Our data illustrated that ceramides play an essential role in plant defense.",

In the current study, C57BL/6 mice were randomly divided into three groups, namely, the control, DOX, and DOX+periplocymarin groups. The cardiac function and apoptosis were measured. Our results revealed that periplocymarin administration greatly improved the DOX-induced cardiac dysfunction manifested by the ejection fraction (EF%), fractional shortening (FS%), left ventricular posterior wall thickness (LVPW), left ventricular anterior wall thickness (LVAW), left ventricular (LV) mass, and attenuated DOX-induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis assessed by hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining, and western blotting. Further study using H9c2 cells revealed that the pretreatment of periplocymarin suppressed DOX-induced apoptosis evidenced by annexin V staining. Moreover, liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis demonstrated that DOX lead to an accumulation in serum ceramide, and the pre-treatment of periplocymarin could reverse this phenomenon. Network pharmacology also demonstrated that ceramide metabolism was involved in the process. Consistently, real-time PCR showed that periplocymarin significantly abolished the induction of the genes involved in the de novo synthesis of ceramide, i.e., CerS2, CerS4, CerS5, and CerS6, and the induction was attributed to the treatment of DOX. Collectively, these results suggested that periplocymarin reduced cardiomyocyte apoptosis to protect hearts from DOX-induced cardiotoxicity and the de novo synthesis of ceramides was involved in this process."

Tyrosol (TYR) is a dietary phenolic compound known to possess cardioprotective effects per se or through its in vivo active metabolite hydroxytyrosol. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of the co-administration of white wine (WW) and TYR on circulating levels of ceramides and other lipids in humans at high CVD risk. Volunteers underwent a randomized controlled crossover clinical trial (4-week duration per intervention) with three different interventions: control, WW, and WW enriched with a capsule of TYR (WW + TYR). Endothelial function cardiovascular biomarkers and plasma lipidomic profile were assessed before and after each intervention. It was found that the WW + TYR intervention resulted in lower levels of three ceramide ratios, associated with an improvement of endothelial function (Cer C16:0/Cer C24:0, Cer C18:0/Cer C24:0, and Cer C24:1/Cer C24:0), when compared to the control intervention. Moreover, WW + TYR was able to minimize the alterations in plasma diacylglycerols concentrations observed following WW. Overall, the results obtained show that the antioxidant TYR administered with WW exerts beneficial effects at the cardiovascular level, in part by modulating blood lipid profile."

Biallelic mutations in the KDSR gene may cause erythrokeratoderma variabilis et progressive-4, later specified as PERIOPTER syndrome, emphasizing a characteristic periorifical and ptychotropic erythrokeratoderma. We report another patient with compound heterozygous mutations in KDSR, born with generalized harlequin ichthyosis, which progressed into palmoplantar keratoderma. To determine whether patient-associated KDSR mutations lead to KDSR substrate accumulation and/or unrecognized sphingolipid downstream products in stratum corneum (SC), we analyzed lipids of this and previously published patients with non-identical biallelic mutations in KDSR. In SC of both patients, we identified 'hitherto' unobserved skin ceramides with an unusual keto-type sphingoid base in lesional and non-lesional areas, which accounted for up to 10% of the measured ceramide species. Furthermore, an overall shorter mean chain length of free and bound sphingoid bases was observed-shorter mean chain length of free sphingoid bases was also observed in lesional psoriasis vulgaris SC, but not generally in lesional atopic dermatitis SC. Formation of keto-type ceramides is probably due to a bottle neck in metabolic flux through KDSR and a bypass by ceramide synthases, which highlights the importance of tight intermediate regulation during sphingolipid anabolism and reveals substrate deprivation as potential therapy.",

      "abstract": "Cardiometabolic diseases (CMD) represent a growing socioeconomic burden and concern for healthcare systems worldwide. Improving patients' metabolic phenotyping in clinical practice will enable clinicians to better tailor prevention and treatment strategy to individual needs. Recently, elevated levels of specific lipid species, known as ceramides, were shown to predict cardiometabolic outcomes beyond traditional biomarkers such as cholesterol. Preliminary data showed that physical activity, a potent, low-cost, and patient-empowering means to reduce CMD-related burden, influences ceramide levels. While a single bout of physical exercise increases circulating and muscular ceramide levels, regular exercise reduces ceramide content. Additionally, several ceramide species have been reported to be negatively associated with cardiorespiratory fitness, which is a potent health marker reflecting training level. Thus, regular exercise could optimize cardiometabolic health, partly by reversing altered ceramide profiles. This short review provides an overview of ceramide metabolism and its role in cardiometabolic health and diseases, before presenting the effects of exercise on ceramides in humans."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Treatment with glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) can reduce risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in persons living with type 2 diabetes, however the mechanisms explaining this cardiovascular benefit are still debated. We investigated changes in the plasma lipidome following treatment with the GLP-1 RA liraglutide. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In a double-blind placebo-controlled trial, we randomized 102 persons with type 2 diabetes to liraglutide or placebo for 26 weeks. Fasting blood plasma was collected at baseline and at end-of-treatment. The lipidome was measured using liquid-chromatography-coupled mass-spectrometry as a secondary end point in the study. Treatment response of each lipid was tested with lipid-specific linear mixed-effect models comparing liraglutide with placebo. Bonferroni p<7.1e-03 was employed. The independence of the findings from clinical covariates was evaluated with adjustment for body mass index, HbA1c, fasting status, lipid-lowering treatment and change in lipid-lowering treatment during the trial. RESULTS: In total, 260 lipids were identified covering 11 lipid families. We observed significant decreases following liraglutide treatment compared with placebo in 21 lipids (p<7.1e-03) from the following lipid families: ceramides, hexocyl-ceramides, phosphatidylcholines, phosphatidylethanolamines and triglycerides. We confirmed these findings in adjusted models (p≤0.01). In the liraglutide-treated group, the individual lipids were reduced in the range of 14%-61% from baseline level, compared with 19% decrease to 27% increase from baseline level in the placebo group. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with placebo, liraglutide treatment led to a significant downregulation in ceramides, phospholipids and triglycerides, which all are linked to higher risk of CVD. These findings were independent of relevant clinical covariates. Our findings are hypothesis generating and shed light on the biological mechanisms underlying the cardiovascular benefits observed with GLP-1 RAs in outcome studies, and further strengthen the evidence base for recommending GLP-1 RAs to prevent CVD in type 2 diabetes.

Ceramides (Cer) maintain skin barrier functions, which are disrupted in lesional skin of AD patients. However, Cer status during the pre-lesional phase of AD is not well defined. Using a variation of human AD-like preclinical model consisting of a 7-day topical exposure to ovalbumin (OVA), or control, we observed elevation of Cer C16 and C24. Skin mRNA quantification of enzymes involved in Cer metabolism [Cer synthases (CerS) and ceramidases (Asah1/Asah2)], which revealed augmented CerS 4, 5 and 6 and Asah1. Given the overall pro-apoptotic nature of Cer, local apoptosis was assessed, then quantified using novel morphometric measurements of cleaved caspase (Casp)-3-restricted immunofluorescence signal in skin samples. Apoptosis was induced in response to OVA. Because apoptosis may occur downstream of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, we measured markers of ER stress-induced apoptosis and found elevated skin-associated CHOP protein upon OVA treatment. We previously substantiated the importance of mast cells (MC) in initiating early skin inflammation. OVA-induced Cer increase and local apoptosis were prevented in MC-deficient mice; however, they were restored following MC reconstitution. We propose that the MC/Cer axis is an essential pathogenic feature of pre-lesional AD, whose targeting may prevent disease development.",

      "abstract": "Ceramides are a class of sphingolipid that is the backbone structure for all sphingolipids, such as glycosphingolipids and phosphosphingolipids. While being a minor constituent of cellular membranes, ceramides are the major lipid component (along with cholesterol, free fatty acid, and other minor components) of the intercellular spaces of stratum corneum that forms the epidermal permeability barrier. These stratum corneum ceramides consist of unique heterogenous molecular species that have only been identified in terrestrial mammals. Alterations of ceramide molecular profiles are characterized in skin diseases associated with compromised permeability barrier functions, such as atopic dermatitis, psoriasis and xerosis. In addition, hereditary abnormalities of some ichthyoses are associated with an epidermal unique ceramide species, omega-O-acylceramide. Ceramides also serve as lipid modulators to regulate cellular functions, including cell cycle arrest, differentiation, and apoptosis, and it has been demonstrated that changes in ceramide metabolism also cause certain diseases. In addition, ceramide metabolites, sphingoid bases, sphingoid base-1-phosphate and ceramide-1-phosphate are also lipid mediators that regulate cellular functions. In this review article, we describe diverse physiological and pathological roles of ceramides and their metabolites in epidermal permeability barrier function, epidermal cell proliferation and differentiation, immunity, and cutaneous diseases. Finally, we summarize the utilization of ceramides as therapy to treat cutaneous disease.",

We investigated the performance of ceramides and ceramide score (CERT) in hypertensive patients at high CV risk. METHODS: Seven ceramides were analyzed using ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry in 920 essential hypertension patients at high CV risk, who visited Beijing Anzhen Hospital from September 2016 to September 2018 (median age: 49 years, 562 males). All patients were followed up for major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), which included incident acute coronary syndrome, heart failure, stroke, and CV death. RESULTS: During mean 2.3-year follow-up, 71 patients experienced MACE. Cer(d18:1/16:0), Cer(d18:1/22:0), and Cer(d18:1/24:0) were highly significant in predicting MACE [multiadjusted hazard ratios (95% confidence interval, CI) per SD were 1.76 (1.34-2.30), 0.55 (0.41-0.73), and 0.66 (0.47-0.92), respectively]. Compared with traditional variables (comprising presence of CV risk factors, hypertension-mediated organ damage, and comorbidities), a novel CERT for hypertensive patients (CERT-HBP), composed of Cer(d18:1/16:0), Cer(d18:1/24:1), and their ratios to Cer(d18:1/24:0) and Cer(d18:1/22:0), respectively, increased the C-statistic from 0.751 (95% CI, 0.697-0.806) to 0.791 (95% CI, 0.737-0.845), P = 0.010.

      "abstract": "Sphingolipids have key functions in plant membrane structure and signaling. Perturbations of plant sphingolipid metabolism often induce cell death and salicylic acid (SA) accumulation; SA accumulation, in turn, promotes sphingolipid metabolism and further cell death. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we show that the Arabidopsis thaliana lipase-like protein ENHANCED DISEASE SUSCEPTIBILITY 1 (EDS1) and its partner PHYTOALEXIN DEFICIENT 4 (PAD4) participate in sphingolipid metabolism and associated cell death. The accelerated cell death 5 (acd5) mutants accumulate ceramides due to a defect in ceramide kinase and show spontaneous cell death. Loss of function of EDS1, PAD4 or SALICYLIC ACID INDUCTION DEFICIENT 2 (SID2) in the acd5 background suppressed the acd5 cell death phenotype and prevented ceramide accumulation. Treatment with the SA analogue benzothiadiazole partially restored sphingolipid accumulation in the acd5 pad4 and acd5 eds1 double mutants, showing that the inhibitory effect of the pad4-1 and eds1-2 mutations on acd5-conferred sphingolipid accumulation partly depends on SA. Moreover, the pad4-1 and eds1-2 mutations substantially rescued the susceptibility of the acd5 mutant to Botrytis cinerea. Consistent with this, B. cinerea-induced ceramide accumulation requires PAD4 or EDS1. Finally, examination of plants overexpressing the ceramide synthase gene LAG1 HOMOLOGUE2 suggested that EDS1, PAD4 and SA are involved in long-chain ceramide metabolism and ceramide-associated cell death. Collectively, our observations reveal that EDS1 and PAD4 mediate ceramide (especially long-chain ceramide) metabolism and associated cell death, by SA-dependent and SA-independent pathways.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Obesity is associated with increased cardiovascular risk; however, the potential role of dysregulations in the adipose tissue (AT) metabolome is unknown. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to explore the role of dysregulation in the AT metabolome on vascular redox signaling and cardiovascular outcomes. METHODS: A screen was conducted for metabolites differentially secreted by thoracic AT (ThAT) and subcutaneous AT in obese patients with atherosclerosis (n = 48), and these metabolites were then linked with dysregulated vascular redox signaling in 633 patients undergoing coronary bypass surgery. The underlying mechanisms were explored in human aortic endothelial cells, and their clinical value was tested against hard clinical endpoints. RESULTS: Because ThAT volume was associated significantly with arterial oxidative stress, there were significant differences in sphingolipid secretion between ThAT and subcutaneous AT, with C16:0-ceramide and derivatives being the most abundant species released within adipocyte-derived extracellular vesicles. High ThAT sphingolipid secretion was significantly associated with reduced endothelial nitric oxide bioavailability and increased superoxide generated in human vessels. Circulating C16:0-ceramide correlated positively with ThAT ceramides, dysregulated vascular redox signaling, and increased systemic inflammation in 633 patients with atherosclerosis. Exogenous C16:0-ceramide directly increased superoxide via tetrahydrobiopterin-mediated endothelial nitric oxide synthase uncoupling and dysregulated protein phosphatase 2 in human aortic endothelial cells. High plasma C16:0-ceramide and its glycosylated derivative were independently related with increased risk for cardiac mortality (adjusted hazard ratios: 1.394; 95% confidence interval: 1.030 to 1.886; p = 0.031 for C16:0-ceramide and 1.595; 95% confidence interval: 1.042 to 2.442; p = 0.032 for C16:0-glycosylceramide per 1 SD). In a randomized controlled clinical trial, 1-year treatment of obese patients with the glucagon-like peptide-1 analog liraglutide suppressed plasma C16:0-ceramide and C16:0-glycosylceramide changes compared with control subjects. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate for the first time in humans that AT-derived ceramides are modifiable regulators of vascular redox state in obesity, with a direct impact on cardiac mortality in advanced atherosclerosis.

      "abstract": "Post-hepatectomy liver dysfunction is a life-threatening morbidity that lacks efficient therapy. Bioactive lipids involved in macrophage polarization crucially regulate tissue injury and regeneration. Herein, we investigate the key bioactive lipids that mediate the cytotherapeutic potential of polarized-macrophage for post-hepatectomy liver dysfunction. Untargeted lipidomics identified elevation of ceramide (CER) metabolites as signature lipid species relevant to M1/M2 polarization in mouse bone-marrow-derived-macrophages (BMDMs). M1 BMDMs expressed a CER-generation-metabolic pattern, leading to elevation of CER; M2 BMDMs expressed a CER-breakdown-metabolic pattern, resulting in upregulation of sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P). After infusing M1- or M2-polarized BMDMs into the mouse liver after hepatectomy, we found that M1-BMDM infusion increased M1 polarization and CER accumulation, resulting in exaggeration of hepatocyte apoptosis and liver dysfunction. Conversely, M2-BMDM infusion enhanced M2 polarization and S1P generation, leading to alleviation of liver dysfunction with improved hepatocyte proliferation. Treatment of exogenous CER and S1P or inhibition CER and S1P synthesis by siRNA targeting relevant enzymes further revealed that CER induced apoptosis while S1P promoted proliferation in post-hepatectomy primary hepatocytes. In conclusion, CER and S1P are uncovered as critical lipid mediators for M1- and M2-polarized BMDMs to promote injury and regeneration in the liver after hepatectomy, respectively. Notably, the upregulation of hepatic S1P induced by M2-BMDM infusion may have therapeutic potential for post-hepatectomy liver dysfunction.",

      "abstract": "ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) remains one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide. The identification of novel metabolic and imaging biomarkers could unveil key pathophysiological mechanisms at the molecular level and promote personalized care in patients with acute coronary syndromes. We studied 38 patients with STEMI who underwent primary percutaneous coronary intervention and thrombus aspiration. We sought to correlate serum ceramide levels with micro-CT quantified aspirated thrombus volume and relevant angiographic outcomes, including modified TIMI thrombus grade and pre- or post-procedural TIMI flow. Higher ceramide C16:0 levels were significantly but weakly correlated with larger aspirated thrombus volume (Spearman r = 0.326, p = 0.046), larger intracoronary thrombus burden (TB; p = 0.030) and worse pre- and post-procedural TIMI flow (p = 0.049 and p = 0.039, respectively). Ceramides C24:0 and C24:1 were also significantly associated with larger intracoronary TB (p = 0.008 and p = 0.001, respectively). Receiver operating characteristic analysis demonstrated that ceramides C24:0 and C24:1 could significantly predict higher intracoronary TB (area under the curve: 0.788, 95% CI: 0.629-0.946 and 0.846, 95% CI: 0.706-0.985, respectively). In conclusion, serum ceramide levels were higher among patients with larger intracoronary and aspirated TB. This suggests that quantification of serum ceramides might improve risk-stratification of patients with STEMI and facilitate an individualized approach in clinical practice."

OBJECTIVE: We sought to investigate whether a lactic acid/ceramide lotion improves the texture and appearance of dry skin through moisturization and desquamation. METHODS: This was a randomized, single-center, controlled, evaluator-blinded, within-subject comparison of a lactic acid/ceramide lotion versus no treatment. The lotion was applied twice daily for 14 days, with evaluations performed on Days 1, 2, and 14. A total of 56 healthy female subjects, older than 50 years of age, with Fitzpatrick Skin Types I through VI and dry, rough skin on the anterior shins (defined as Grades 3-4 by investigator evaluation) were included in the study. Assessments of change in skin appearance following desquamation and moisturization by D-SQUAME® analysis and an investigator assessment on the Dry Skin Scale were performed on Days 1, 2, and 14. Additionally, subjects completed a self-assessment questionnaire on Day 1 and Day 14. Safety was assessed via spontaneous reporting and review of subject diaries. RESULTS: Clinical and statistically significant superiority to no treatment in terms of enhancing moisturization and desquamation per D-SQUAME® analysis at Day 2 and Day 14 (-2.51 and -3.07 from baseline, respectively; p<0.0001) was achieved. Treatment success as assessed by the investigator (via the Dry Skin Scale) and subject's self-assessment also indicated statistically significant improvements were achieved with the lactic acid/ceramide lotion (p<0.0001). No adverse events were reported during the study. CONCLUSION: The lactic acid/ceramide lotion provided a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in moisturization and desquamation. CLINICALTRIALS.GOV IDENTIFIER: NCT04085809."

      "abstract": "Ceramides are bioactive lipids that have an important role in many cellular functions such as apoptosis and inflammation. During the past decade emerging clinical data have shown that ceramides are not only of great biochemical interest but may also have diagnostic utility. Ceramides have shown independent predictive value for negative cardiovascular outcomes as well as for the onset of type 2 diabetes. Based on abundant published data, risk score using the concentrations of circulating ceramides have been developed and adapted for routine clinical practice. Currently serum ceramides are used clinically as efficient risk stratifiers for primary and secondary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (CVD). A direct cause-effect relationship between CVD and ceramide has not been established to date. As ceramide-specific medications are being developed, conventional strategies such as lipid lowering agents and lifestyle interventions can be used to reduce overall risk. Ceramides can identify a very high-risk coronary heart disease category of patients in need for more intense medical attention, specifically those patients at higher risk as highlighted in the 2019 European Society of Cardiology guidelines for stable chronic coronary syndrome patients. In addition, the ceramide risk score may be used as a decision-making tool in primary prevention patients with moderate CVD risk. Finally, the ceramide risk score may have a unique utility as a motivational tool to increase patient's adherence to medical therapy and lifestyle changes.",

We aimed to evaluate the effects of dietary anthocyanins on plasma ceramides and to disentangle whether the alterations in ceramides could be related with those in other cardiometabolic risk factors in the dyslipidemia. METHODS: In a randomized double-blinded placebo-controlled trial, 176 eligible dyslipidemia subjects were randomly assigned into four groups receiving placebo, 40, 80, or 320 mg/day anthocyanins, respectively for 12 weeks. RESULTS: A total of 169 subjects completed the study. After 12-week intervention, dietary anthocyanins dose-dependently reduced plasma concentrations of all six ceramide species in the dyslipidemia subjects (all Ptrend values < 0.05). Specifically, 320 mg/day anthocyanins effectively lowered plasma N-palmitoylsphingosine (Cer 16:0, mean change: -28.3 ± 41.2 versus 2.9 ± 38.2, nmol/L, P = 0.018) and N-tetracosanoylsphingosine (Cer 24:0, mean change: -157.1 ± 493.9 versus 10.7 ± 439.9, nmol/L, P = 0.002) compared with the placebo. The declines in plasma Cer 16:0 and Cer 24:0 were significantly correlated with the decreases in plasma non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (nonHDL-C, Spearman's r = 0.32, P = 0.040 for Cer 16:0; Spearman's r = 0.35, P = 0.026 for Cer 24:0), apolipoprotein B (Spearman's r = 0.33, P = 0.031 for Cer 16:0; Spearman's r = 0.48, P = 0.002 for Cer 24:0), and total cholesterol (Spearman's r = 0.34, P = 0.026 for Cer 16:0; Spearman's r = 0.31, P = 0.042 for Cer 24:0) after 12-week 320 mg/day anthocyanin administration. Besides, we found that anthocyanins at 320 mg/day also markedly enhanced cholesterol efflux capacity in the dyslipidemia, the changes of which were positively associated with the reductions in Cer 16:0 (Spearman's r = 0.42, P = 0.006) independent of HDL-C and apolipoprotein A-I. CONCLUSIONS: Reductions in plasma Cer 16:0 and Cer 18:0 after 12-week anthocyanin intervention were dose-dependently associated with improvements in plasma lipids and cholesterol efflux capacity in the dyslipidemia.

OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to explore the associations between plasma Cer and atherosclerotic burden evaluated by Synergy Between Percutaneous Coronary Intervention with Taxus and Cardiac Surgery (SYNTAX) score. METHODS AND RESULTS: A retrospective series of 248 ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) patients undergoing interventional procedures and plasma ceramides measurement were enrolled. Rapid resolution liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (RRLC-Q-TOF/MS) was used to evaluate plasma Cer concentrations. SYNTAX score was automatically calculated on the SYNTAX website (http://www.syntaxscore.com/). Patients with STEMI had higher plasma MACEs-related ceramide levels than normal donors (p < .001). Pearson correlation analysis showed positive correlations between SYNTAX score and Cer(d18:1/16:0) (r = 0.176, p = .006), Cer(d18:1/18:0) (r = 0.290, p < .001), Cer(d18:1/24:1) (r = 0.209, p = .001) and Cer(d18:1/24:0) (r = 0.134, p = .036). Adjustments for all traditional risks, higher Cer(d18:1/16:0) level (per SD increase, β (95%CI) =10.681 (1.912-19.923), p = .032), Cer(d18:1/18:0) level (per SD increase, β (95%CI) =38.830 (15.444-62.126), p = .001), Cer(d18:1/24:1) level (per SD increase, β (95%CI) =6.122 (1.640-10.605), p = .008) (except for and Cer(d18:1/24:0) level (per SD increase, β (95%CI) =0.999 (-0.508-2.506), p = .193)) were independently associated with higher levels of SYNTAX score. CONCLUSIONS: Elevated plasma levels of Cer (d18:1/16:0), Cer(d18:1/18:0) and Cer(d18:1/24:1)) are independent predictors for a high atherosclerotic burden in patients with STEMI.

The purpose of this study was to provide evidence of the benefits of a cream and equivalent lotion containing skin lipids in a multi-vesicular emulsion for the management of dry skin. The hypothesis was that the test cream and test lotion could sustain skin moisturization for longer than traditional emollients by sustainably delivering skin lipids. METHODS: A double-blind intra-subject vehicle-controlled single open-application test on the lower legs in people with dry, atopic dermatitis (atopic eczema)-prone, skin was conducted. There were six treatment sites, three per lower leg in each participant, which were treated with the test cream, the test lotion, three reference creams commonly prescribed in the UK and no treatment as a control. After baseline measurements of skin hydration, 100 μl of the test/reference creams was applied to each of the relevant treatment sites (random site allocation). Following treatment, measurements of skin hydration and scoring of visual dryness was conducted at timed intervals (3, 6, 12 and 24 h post-product application). RESULTS: The test cream and lotion both significantly increased skin hydration and reduced skin dryness for at least 24 h following a single application compared to a no treatment control site. Compared to three reference emollient creams the test cream and test lotion were the only products capable of sustaining clinically meaningful improvements in skin moisturization for 24 h. CONCLUSION: The sustained moisturization imparted by the test products reduces the need for frequent emollient application, often requiring 3-4 applications per day for traditional emollients, and should reduce the high burden of managing dry skin conditions like atopic dermatitis."

      "abstract": "Cardiac dysfunction in T2D is associated with excessive FA uptake, oxidation, and generation of toxic lipid species by the heart. It is not known whether decreasing lipid delivery to the heart can effect improvement in cardiac function in humans with T2D. Thus, our objective was to test the hypothesis that lowering lipid delivery to the heart would result in evidence of decreased \"lipotoxicity,\" improved cardiac function, and salutary effects on plasma biomarkers of cardiovascular risk. Thus, we performed a double-blind randomized placebo-controlled parallel design study of the effects of 12 weeks of fenofibrate-induced lipid lowering on cardiac function, inflammation, and oxidation biomarkers, and on the ratio of two plasma ceramides, Cer d18:1 (4E) (1OH, 3OH)/24:0 and Cer d18:1 (4E) (1OH, 3OH)/16:0 (i.e., \"C24:0/C16:0\"), which is associated with decreased risk of cardiac dysfunction and heart failure. Fenofibrate lowered plasma TG and cholesterol but did not improve heart systolic or diastolic function. Fenofibrate treatment lowered the plasma C24:0/C16:0 ceramide ratio and minimally altered oxidative stress markers but did not alter measures of inflammation. Overall, plasma TG lowering correlated with improvement of cardiac relaxation (diastolic function) as measured by tissue Doppler-derived parameter e'. Moreover, lowering the plasma C24:0/C16:0 ceramide ratio was correlated with worse diastolic function. These findings indicate that fenofibrate treatment per se is not sufficient to effect changes in cardiac function; however, decreases in plasma TG may be linked to improved diastolic function. In contrast, decreases in plasma C24:0/C16:0 are linked with worsening cardiac function.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Ceramides (Cer) are an atherogenic substance. However, the associations between specific plasma Cer levels and culprit plaque morphology in ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) patients are unclear. METHODS: The study consisted of two parallel cohorts. 100 consecutive patients with STEMI were screened as discovery cohort. In the validation cohort, we separately screened 30 normal donors, 30 stable angina pectoris (SAP) and 315 STEMI patients. All STEMI patients underwent emergency percutaneous intervention (PCI) and optical coherence tomography (OCT) examination for culprit plaque. Based on established diagnostic criteria, STEMI patients were classified into plaque rupture (PR) and plaque erosion (PE) group, respectively. Rapid resolution liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (RRLC-Q-TOF/MS) was used to evaluate plasma Cer levels of the screened patients. RESULTS: STEMI patients had higher plasma Cer(d18:1/16:0), Cer(d18:1/18:0), Cer(d18:1/24:1) and Cer(d18:1/24:0) levels than normal donors and SAP patients (p < 0.001, p < 0.001, p < 0.001, p < 0.001, respectively). Plasma Cer levels were significantly higher in STEMI patients with PR than with PE (p < 0.001, p < 0.001, p = 0.008 and p = 0.006, respectively). The frequency of PR increased with increasing tertiles of plasma Cer (adjusted p for trend = 0.004, 0.044, 0.021 and 0.133, respectively). The fully adjusted per SD odds ratios (95% confidence interval) for PR were 9.375 (2.496-35.215) for Cer(d18:1/16:0), 3.586 (1.588-8.089) for Cer(d18:1/18:0), 8.171 (1.764-37.857) for Cer(d18:1/24:1), and 3.831 (1.288-11.289) for Cer(d18:1/24:10). CONCLUSIONS: The study documented novel, positive and independent associations between plasma Cer concentrations and the presence of PR, suggesting plasma Cer may act as potential biomarkers for PR to improve risk stratification.",

We analyzed colorectal cancer patients to evaluate sphingolipid profiles in the blood, colorectal cancer (CRC) tissues, and healthy surrounding colorectal tissues of the same patient, simultaneously, using liquid chromatography coupled with triple quadrupole mass spectrometry. Furthermore, we measured protein expression of de novo ceramide synthesis enzymes and mitochondrial markers in tissues using western blot. We confirmed the different sphingolipid contents in colorectal cancer tissue compared to healthy surrounding tissues. Furthermore, we showed changed amounts of several ceramides in more advanced colorectal cancer tissue and found a prominently higher circulating level of several of them. Moreover, we observed a relationship between the amounts of some ceramide species in colorectal cancer tissue and plasma depending on the stage of colorectal cancer according to TNM (tumors, nodes, metastasis) classification. We think that the combined measurement of several ceramide concentrations in plasma can help distinguish early-stage lesions from advanced colorectal cancer and can help produce a screening test to detect early colorectal cancer.",

      "abstract": "Dysfunctional skin barrier plays a key role in the pathophysiology of atopic dermatitis (AD), a common inflammatory skin disease. Altered composition of ceramides is regarded as a major cause of skin barrier dysfunction, however it is not clear whether these changes are intrinsic or initiated by inflammation and aberrant immune response in AD. This study investigated the levels of free sphingoid bases (SBs) sphingosine and sphinganine and their ceramides and glucosylceramide in the stratum corneum (SC) and related them to skin barrier function, disease severity and local cytokine milieu. Ceramides were measured in healthy skin, and lesional and non-lesional skin of AD patients by a novel method based on deacylation of ceramides which were subsequently determined as corresponding sphingoid bases by using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The cytokine levels were determined by multiplex immunoassay. Atopic skin showed increased levels of most investigated markers, predominantly in lesional skin. The largest difference in respect to healthy skin was found for glucosylceramide with respective median values of 0.23 (IQR 0.18-0.61), 0.56 (IQR 0.32-0.76) and 19.32 (IQR 7.86-27.62) pmol/g protein for healthy, non-lesional and lesional skin. The levels of investigated ceramide markers were correlated with disease severity (scoring atopic dermatitis, SCORAD) and skin barrier function (trans-epidermal water loss, TEWL) and furthermore with cytokines involved in innate, Th-1, and Th-2 immune response. Interestingly, the strongest association with SCORAD was found for sphinganine/sphingosine ratio (r = -0.69, p < 0.001; non-lesional skin), emphasizing the importance of SBs in AD. The highest correlation with TEWL was found for glucosylceramide (r2 = 0.60, p < 0.001), which was investigated for the first time in AD. Findings that the changes in SBs and ceramide levels were predominant in lesional skin and their association with disease severity and cytokine levels suggest an immune-system driven effect. a novel analysis method demonstrates a robust and simple approach that might facilitate wider use of lipid biomarkers in the clinics e.g., to monitor (immune) therapy or dissect disease endotypes.",

      "abstract": "Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a multifactorial, heterogeneous disease associated with epidermal barrier disruption and intense systemic inflammation. Previously, we showed that exosomes derived from human adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ASC-exosomes) attenuate AD-like symptoms by reducing multiple inflammatory cytokine levels. Here, we investigated ASC-exosomes' effects on skin barrier restoration by analyzing protein and lipid contents. We found that subcutaneous injection of ASC-exosomes in an oxazolone-induced dermatitis model remarkably reduced trans-epidermal water loss, while enhancing stratum corneum (SC) hydration and markedly decreasing the levels of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-4, IL-5, IL-13, TNF-α, IFN-γ, IL-17, and TSLP, all in a dose-dependent manner. Interestingly, ASC-exosomes induced the production of ceramides and dihydroceramides. Electron microscopic analysis revealed enhanced epidermal lamellar bodies and formation of lamellar layer at the interface of the SC and stratum granulosum with ASC-exosomes treatment. Deep RNA sequencing analysis of skin lesions demonstrated that ASC-exosomes restores the expression of genes involved in skin barrier, lipid metabolism, cell cycle, and inflammatory response in the diseased area. Collectively, our results suggest that ASC-exosomes effectively restore epidermal barrier functions in AD by facilitating the de novo synthesis of ceramides, resulting in a promising cell-free therapeutic option for treating AD.",

OBJECTIVES: Determine whether circulating sphingolipids, particularly ceramides, are associated with alterations in the gut microbiome among obese patients with increased diabetes risk. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional and longitudinal retrospective analysis of a dietary/weight loss intervention. Fasted serum was collected from 49 participants (41 women) and analyzed by HPLC-MS/MS to quantify 45 sphingolipids. Shotgun metagenomic sequencing of stool was performed to profile the gut microbiome. RESULTS: Confirming the link to deteriorated glucose homeostasis, serum ceramides were positively correlated with fasting glucose, but inversely correlated with fasting and OGTT-derived measures of insulin sensitivity and β-cell function. Significant associations with gut dysbiosis were demonstrated, with SM and ceramides being inversely correlated with gene richness. Ceramides with fatty acid chain lengths of 20-24 carbons were the most associated with low richness. Diet-induced weight loss, which improved gene richness, decreased most sphingolipids. Thirty-one MGS, mostly corresponding to unidentified bacteria species, were inversely correlated with ceramides, including a number of Bifidobacterium and Methanobrevibacter smithii. Higher ceramide levels were also associated with increased metagenomic modules for lipopolysaccharide synthesis and flagellan synthesis, two pathogen-associated molecular patterns, and decreased enrichment of genes involved in methanogenesis and bile acid metabolism. CONCLUSION: This study identifies an association between gut microbiota richness, ceramides, and diabetes risk in overweight/obese humans, and suggests that the gut microbiota may contribute to dysregulation of lipid metabolism in metabolic disorders.",

A split site, double-blinded, randomized, controlled study was conducted in 24 senile subjects (91.7% females, mean age 54.83 ± 5.45 years) with mild to moderate xerosis, who were randomized to receive ceramide-containing moisturizer or hydrophilic cream, daily applied on each side of the shin.

After 28 days of twice-daily application, more significant improvement on skin hydration, barrier function, and skin pH was observed in those with ceramide-containing moisturizer at all-time points. At day 28, there was a statistically significant decrease of hemoglobin index, wrinkle, and texture on the ceramide treated side. The 7-day post-moisturizing efficacy on the ceramide treated side was superior for skin hydration, TEWL, skin pH, and wrinkle.

      "abstract": "Resistance to insulin is a pathophysiological state related to the decreased response of peripheral tissues to the insulin action, hyperinsulinemia and raised blood glucose levels caused by increased hepatic glucose outflow. All the above precede the onset of full-blown type 2 diabetes. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), in 2016 more than 1.9 billion people over 18 years of age were overweight and about 600 million were obese. Currently, the primary hypothesis explaining the probability of occurrence of insulin resistance assigns a fundamental role of lipids accumulation in adipocytes or nonadipose tissue (muscle, liver) and the locally developing chronic inflammation caused by adipocytes hypertrophy. However, the major molecular pathways are unknown. The sphingolipid ceramide is the main culprit that combines a plethora of nutrients (e.g., saturated fatty acids) and inflammatory cytokines (e.g., TNFα) to the progression of insulin resistance. The accumulation of sphingolipid ceramide in tissues of obese humans, rodents and Western-diet non-human primates is in line with diabetes, hypertension, cardiac failure or atherosclerosis. In hypertrophied adipose tissue, after adipocytes excel their storage capacity, neutral lipids begin to accumulate in nonadipose tissues, inducing organ dysfunction. Furthermore, obesity is closely related to the development of chronic inflammation and the release of cytokines directly from adipocytes or from macrophages that infiltrate adipose tissue. Enzymes taking part in ceramide metabolism are potential therapeutic targets to manipulate sphingolipids content in tissues, either by inhibition of their synthesis or through stimulation of ceramides degradation. In this review, we will evaluate the mechanisms responsible for the development of insulin resistance and possible therapeutic perspectives."

Wild type (WT) and NE knockout (NE KO) mice were fed with western diet (WD) for 24 weeks to establish NASH model. The severity of liver injury in NASH mice was assessed by biochemical analysis, liver triglyceride (TG) quantitation and histological scoring. The gene and protein expression was detected by quantitative real-time PCR, immunohistochemical and immunofluorescence staining (IHC/IF) and western blot analysis. After 24 weeks, WD induced WT (WD-WT) mice had significantly up-regulated NE protein in the liver. Moreover, body weight, liver/body weight, serum and hepatic TG, liver histological score, and hepatic inflammatory factors expression were significantly higher in WD-WT mice than those in low fat diet (LFD) induced WT mice, and these effects were markedly improved by NE KO. In addition, we found incereased expression of ceramides and serine palmitoyltransferase subunit 2 (SPT2) in WD-WT mice could be reversed by NE KO. Up-regulating expression of ceramides and SPT2 by active NE treatment was also found in mice primary hepatocytes. Collectively, these findings indicated that NE KO ameliorated WD induced NASH, and this beneficial effect was due, at least in part, to the potential of NE in regulating hepatic ceramides metabolism.",

      "abstract": "Ceramides are central intermediates of sphingolipid metabolism that can activate a variety of tumor suppressive cellular programs, including cell cycle arrest, senescence and apoptosis. Indeed, perturbations in ceramide generation and turnover are frequently linked to cancer cell survival and resistance to chemotherapy. Consequently, the potential of ceramide-based therapeutics in the treatment of cancer has become a major focus of interest. A growing body of evidence indicates that ceramides can act directly on mitochondria to trigger apoptotic cell death. However, molecular details of the underlying mechanism are scarce. In our recent study (Dadsena S et al., 2019, Nat Commun 10:1832), we used a photoactivatable ceramide probe combined with computer simulations and functional studies to identify the voltage-dependent anion channel VDAC2 as a critical effector of ceramide-induced mitochondrial apoptosis. Collectively, our findings provide a novel molecular framework for how ceramides execute their widely acclaimed anti-neoplastic activities."

      "abstract": "AIM: Recent prospective studies have identified distinct plasma ceramides as strong predictors of major adverse cardiovascular events in patients with established or suspected coronary artery disease (CAD). Currently, it is uncertain whether higher levels of distinct plasma ceramides are associated with greater angiographic severity of coronary-artery stenoses in this patient population. METHODS: We measured six previously identified high-risk plasma ceramide species [Cer(d18:1/16:0), Cer(d18:1/18:0), Cer(d18:1/20:0), Cer(d18:1/22:0), Cer(d18:1/24:0) and Cer(d18:1/24:1)] in 167 consecutive patients with established or suspected CAD, who underwent urgent or elective coronary angiography. RESULTS: Approximately 77% of patients had a significant stenosis (≥50%) in one or more of the main coronary arteries, the majority of whom (∼60%) had a significant stenosis in the left anterior descending (LAD) artery. Of the six measured plasma ceramides, higher levels of plasma Cer(d18:1/20:0) (adjusted-odds ratio 1.39, 95%CI 1.0-1.99), Cer(d18:1/22:0) (adjusted-odds ratio 1.57, 95%CI 1.08-2.29) and Cer(d18:1/24:0) (adjusted-odds ratio 1.59, 95%CI 1.08-2.32) were significantly associated with the presence of LAD stenosis≥50%, after adjustment for age, sex, smoking, pre-existing CAD, hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidaemia, lipid-lowering therapy, estimated glomerular filtration rate and plasma C-reactive protein levels. Almost identical results were found even after excluding patients (n=15) with acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction. Similar results were also found when patients were categorized according to the Gensini severity score. CONCLUSION: Our cross-sectional study shows for the first time that higher levels of specific plasma ceramides are independently associated with a greater severity of coronary-artery stenoses in the LAD artery in patients who had suspected or established CAD.",

OBJECTIVE: To investigate if overeating SFA- and PUFA-enriched diets lead to differential liver fat accumulation in overweight and obese humans. DESIGN: Double-blind randomized trial (LIPOGAIN-2). Overfeeding SFA vs PUFA for 8 weeks, followed by 4 weeks of caloric restriction. SETTING: General community. PARTICIPANTS: Men and women who are overweight or have obesity (n = 61). INTERVENTION: Muffins, high in either palm (SFA) or sunflower oil (PUFA), were added to the habitual diet. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Lean tissue mass (not reported here). Secondary and exploratory outcomes included liver and ectopic fat depots. RESULTS: By design, body weight gain was similar in SFA (2.31 ± 1.38 kg) and PUFA (2.01 ± 1.90 kg) groups, P = 0.50. SFA markedly induced liver fat content (50% relative increase) along with liver enzymes and atherogenic serum lipids. In contrast, despite similar weight gain, PUFA did not increase liver fat or liver enzymes or cause any adverse effects on blood lipids. SFA had no differential effect on the accumulation of visceral fat, pancreas fat, or total body fat compared with PUFA. SFA consistently increased, whereas PUFA reduced circulating ceramides, changes that were moderately associated with liver fat changes and proposed markers of hepatic lipogenesis. The adverse metabolic effects of SFA were reversed by calorie restriction. CONCLUSIONS: SFA markedly induces liver fat and serum ceramides, whereas dietary PUFA prevents liver fat accumulation and reduces ceramides and hyperlipidemia during excess energy intake and weight gain in overweight individuals.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Lupus nephritis (LN) is the most common organ manifestation in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and associated with a poor prognosis. Still, a noninvasive but reliable method to diagnose LN has not been established. Thus, we evaluated whether blood sphingolipids could serve as valid biomarkers for renal injury. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, 82 participants were divided into three groups: 36 healthy controls and 17 SLE patients without renal injury (both: estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) ≥ 80 ml/min/1.73 m2 and albumin/creatinine ≤ 30 mg/g) and 29  LN patients. LN patients were identified by renal biopsies and impaired renal function (eGFR < 80 ml/min/1.73 m2 and albumin/creatinine ratio > 30 mg/g). Venous blood was collected from all participants and sphingolipid levels in plasma and serum were measured by LC-MS/MS. RESULTS: Most interesting, concentrations of some specific ceramides, C16ceramide (Cer), C18Cer, C20Cer and C24:1Cer, were elevated in both, plasma and serum samples of patients suffering from biopsy-proven LN and impaired renal function, compared to healthy controls as well as SLE patients without renal injury. C24:1dhCer levels were elevated in plasma and serum samples from LN patients compared to SLE patients. Sphingosine levels were higher in plasma and serum of LN patients compared to healthy controls, but not compared to SLE patients. Sphinganine concentrations were significantly elevated in serum samples from LN patients compared to healthy controls and SLE. S1P and SA1P levels were higher in plasma samples of SLE and LN patients compared to healthy controls. Subsequent ROC analyses of plasma and serum data of the most altered ceramide species (C16Cer, C18Cer, C20Cer, C24:1Cer) between LN patients and SLE patients display a high diagnostic differentiation with significant AUCs especially for C24:1Cer serum levels. Further, C24:1Cer serum levels were not affected by glucocorticoid treatment and did not correlate with other renal markers, such as serum creatinine, eGFR and albumin/creatinine ratio. CONCLUSION: Our data reveal that chain-length specific ceramides in blood, most likely C24:1Cer levels in serum, could act as potent biomarkers for renal impairment in patients suffering from SLE.",

      "abstract": "Silybin is a flavonolignan extracted from Silybum marianum (milk thistle) with hepatoprotective, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory activity. Several studies have shown that silybin is highly effective to prevent and treat different types of cancer and that its antitumor mechanisms involve the arrest of the cell cycle and/or apoptosis. An MTT assay was performed to study cell viability, lipid peroxidation, extracellular NO production, and scavenger enzyme activity were studied by Thiobarbituric Acid-Reactive Species (TBARS) assay, NO assay, and MnSOD assay, respectively. Cell cycle and apoptosis analysis were performed by FACS. miRNA profiling were evaluated by real time PCR. In this study, we demonstrated that Silybin induced growth inhibition blocking the Hepg2 cells in G1 phase of cell cycle and activating the process of programmed cell death. Moreover, the antiproliferative effects of silybin were paralleled by a strong increase of the number of ceramides involved in the modulation of miRNA secretion. In particular, after treatment with silybin, miR223-3p and miR16-5p were upregulated, while miR-92-3p was downregulated (p < 0.05). In conclusion, our results suggest that silybin-Induced apoptosis occurs in parallel to the increase of ceramides synthesis and miRNAs secretion in HepG2 cells.",

      "abstract": "Physical inactivity increases the risk to develop type 2 diabetes, a disease characterized by a state of insulin resistance. By promoting inflammatory state, ceramides are especially recognized to alter insulin sensitivity in skeletal muscle. The present study was designed to analyze, in mice, whether muscle ceramides contribute to physical-inactivity-induced insulin resistance. For this purpose, we used the wheel lock model to induce a sudden reduction of physical activity, in combination with myriocin treatment, an inhibitor of de novo ceramide synthesis. Mice were assigned to 3 experimental groups: voluntary wheel access group (Active), a wheel lock group (Inactive), and wheel lock group treated with myriocin (Inactive-Myr). We observed that 10 days of physical inactivity induces hyperinsulinemia and increases basal insulin resistance (HOMA-IR). The muscle ceramide content was not modified by physical inactivity and myriocin. Thus, muscle ceramides do not play a role in physical-inactivity-induced insulin resistance. In skeletal muscle, insulin-stimulated protein kinase B phosphorylation and inflammatory pathway were not affected by physical inactivity, whereas a reduction of glucose transporter type 4 content was observed. Based on these results, physical-inactivity-induced insulin resistance seems related to a reduction in glucose transporter type 4 content rather than defects in insulin signaling. We observed in inactive mice that myriocin treatment improves glucose tolerance, insulin-stimulated protein kinase B, adenosine-monophosphate-activated protein kinase activation, and glucose transporter type 4 content in skeletal muscle. Such effects occur regardless of changes in muscle ceramide content. These findings open promising research perspectives to identify new mechanisms of action for myriocin on insulin sensitivity and glucose metabolism.",

Ceramides are primarily recognized as lipid bilayer building blocks, but recent work has shown that these endogenous molecules are important intracellular signalling mediators and may exert some diabetogenic effects via molecular pathways involved in insulin resistance, β-cell apoptosis and inflammation. In the present review, we consider the available evidence on the possible roles of ceramides in diabetes mellitus and introduce eight different molecular mechanisms mediating the diabetogenic action of ceramides, categorized into those predominantly related to insulin resistance vs those mainly implicated in β-cell dysfunction. Specifically, the mechanistic evidence involves β-cell apoptosis, pancreatic inflammation, mitochondrial stress, endoplasmic reticulum stress, adipokine release, insulin receptor substrate 1 phosphorylation, oxidative stress and insulin synthesis. Collectively, the evidence suggests that therapeutic agents aimed at reducing ceramide synthesis and lowering circulating levels may be beneficial in the prevention and/or treatment of diabetes and its related complications.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Ceramides have been implicated in the pathophysiology of HIV infection and cardiovascular disease. However, no study, to our knowledge, has evaluated circulating ceramide levels in association with subclinical cardiovascular disease risk among HIV-infected individuals. METHODS: Plasma levels of 4 ceramide species (C16:0, C22:0, C24:0, and C24:1) were measured among 398 women (73% HIV+) and 339 men (68% HIV+) without carotid artery plaques at baseline from the Women's Interagency HIV Study and the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study. We examined associations between baseline plasma ceramides and risk of carotid artery plaque formation, assessed by repeated B-mode carotid artery ultrasound imaging over a median 7-year follow-up. RESULTS: Plasma levels of C16:0, C22:0, and C24:1 ceramides were significantly higher in HIV-infected individuals compared with those without HIV infection (all P<0.001), and further analysis indicated that elevated ceramide levels were associated with antiretroviral therapy use, particularly protease inhibitor use, in HIV-infected individuals (all P<0.001). All 4 ceramides were highly correlated with each other ( r=0.70-0.94; all P<0.001) and significantly correlated with total-cholesterol ( r=0.42-0.58; all P<0.001) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol ( r=0.24-0.42; all P<0.001) levels. Of note, C16:0 and C24:1 ceramides, rather than C22:0 and C24:0 ceramides, were more closely correlated with specific monocyte activation and inflammation markers (eg, r=0.30 between C16:0 ceramide and soluble CD14; P<0.001) and surface markers of CD4+ T-cell activation. A total of 112 participants developed carotid artery plaques over 7 years, and higher levels of C16:0 and C24:1 ceramides were significantly associated with increased risk of carotid artery plaques (relative risk [95% CI]=1.55 [1.29, 1.86] and 1.51 [1.26, 1.82] per standard deviation increment, respectively; both P<0.001), after adjusting for demographic and behavioral factors. After further adjustment for cardiovascular disease risk factors and immune activation markers, these associations were attenuated but remained significant. The results were consistent between men and women and between HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected participants. CONCLUSIONS: In 2 HIV cohorts, elevated plasma levels of C16:0 and C24:1 ceramides, correlating with immune activation and inflammation, were associated with antiretroviral therapy use and progression of carotid artery atherosclerosis.",

It is well understood that daily use of gentle cleansers and moisturizers may help to restore and maintain an optimal skin barrier function. A cohort study of patients with dry skin was developed to evaluate efficacy of daily use of a ceramide containing cleanser and cream that also has salicylic acid. Methods: Thirty-five adults with mild-to-moderate dry skin conditions were recruited from four dermatology centers in Canada. With consent, the subjects received twice daily treatment with the ceramides containing cleanser and cream that also has salicylic acid. Physician and subject assessed skin condition comparing baseline versus (day 0) versus day 28 (end) was scored using the Dry skin classification scale and the Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale (GAIS). Subjects also rated satisfaction, product features, quality of life aspects, safety, and tolerability. Results: Thirty-four subjects completed the treatment and study period; one was lost to follow up. Daily use of the evaluated cleanser and moisturizer significantly improved skin condition when comparing day 0 versus day 28 (+/- 5 days (end)) results. Both the physicians and subjects using the dry skin classification scale and GAIS scored a significant improvement of the dry skin condition.

      "abstract": "In the last 30 years, ceramides have been found to mediate a myriad of biological processes. Ceramides have been recognized as bioactive molecules and their metabolizing enzymes are attractive targets in cancer therapy and other diseases. The molecular mechanism of action of cellular ceramides are still not fully established, with insights into roles through modification of lipid rafts, creation of ceramide platforms, ceramide channels, or through regulation of direct protein effectors such as protein phosphatases and kinases. Recently, the 'Many Ceramides' hypothesis focuses on distinct pools of subcellular ceramides and ceramide species as potential defined bioactive entities. Traditional methods that measure changes in ceramide levels in the whole cell, such as mass spectrometry, fluorescent ceramide analogues, and ceramide antibodies, fail to differentiate specific bioactive species at the subcellular level. However, a few ceramide binding proteins have been reported, and a smaller subgroup within these, have been shown to translocate to ceramide-enriched membranes, revealing these localized pools of bioactive ceramides. In this review we want to discuss and consolidate these works and explore the possibility of defining these binding proteins as new tools are emerging to visualize bioactive ceramides in cells. Our goal is to encourage the scientific community to explore these ceramide partners, to improve techniques to refine the list of these binding partners, making possible the identification of specific domains that recognize and bind ceramides to be used to visualize the 'Many Ceramides' in the cell.",

DESIGN: Retrospective case-control study and in vitro mouse oocyte study. SETTING: University-affiliated hospital and university laboratory. SUBJECTS: Twenty-seven infertile patients diagnosed with endometriosis and 20 infertile patients who did not have endometriosis; BALB/c female mice. INTERVENTION(S): None. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): PF sphingolipid concentrations. Number of metaphase II (MII) mouse oocytes. RESULT(S): Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry revealed 11 significantly elevated PF sphingolipids in infertile women with severe endometriosis compared with infertile women without endometriosis (change >50%, false discovery rate ≤10%). Logistic regression analysis identified three very-long-chain ceramides potentially associated with EAI. Functional studies revealed that very-long-chain ceramides may compromise or induce murine MII oocyte maturation. The oocyte maturation effects induced by the very long-chain ceramides were triggered by alterations in mitochondrial superoxide production in a concentration-dependent manner. Scavenging of mitochondrial superoxide reversed the maturation effects of C24:0 ceramide. CONCLUSION(S): EAI is associated with accumulation of PF very-long-chain ceramides. Mouse studies demonstrated how ceramides affect MII oocyte maturation, mediating through mitochondrial superoxide. These results provide an opportunity for direct functional readout of pathophysiology in EAI, and future therapies targeted at this sphingolipid metabolism may be harnessed for improved oocyte maturation.",

      "abstract": "KEY POINTS: Insulin sensitivity (as determined by a hyperinsulinaemic-euglyceamic clamp) decreased 15% after reduced activity. Despite not fully returning to baseline physical activity levels, insulin sensitivity unexpectedly, rebounded above that recorded before 2 weeks of reduced physical activity by 14% after the recovery period. Changes in insulin sensitivity in response to reduced activity were primarily driven by men but, not women. There were modest changes in ceramides (nuclear/myofibrillar fraction and serum) following reduced activity and recovery but, in the absence of major changes to body composition (i.e. fat mass), ceramides were not related to changes in inactivity-induced insulin sensitivity in healthy older adults. ABSTRACT: Older adults are at risk of physical inactivity as they encounter debilitating life events. It is not known how insulin sensitivity is affected by modest short-term physical inactivity and recovery in healthy older adults, nor how insulin sensitivity is related to changes in serum and muscle ceramide content. Healthy older adults (aged 64-82 years, five females, seven males) were assessed before (PRE), after 2 weeks of reduced physical activity (RA) and following 2 weeks of recovery (REC). Insulin sensitivity (hyperinsulinaemic-euglyceamic clamp), lean mass, muscle function, skeletal muscle subfraction, fibre-specific, and serum ceramide content and indices of skeletal muscle inflammation were assessed. Insulin sensitivity decreased by 15 ± 6% at RA (driven by men) but rebounded above PRE by 14 ± 5% at REC. Mid-plantar flexor muscle area and leg strength decreased with RA, although only muscle size returned to baseline levels following REC. Body fat did not change and only minimal changes in muscle inflammation were noted across the intervention. Serum and intramuscular ceramides (nuclear/myofibrillar fraction) were modestly increased at RA and REC. However, ceramides were not related to changes in inactivity-induced insulin sensitivity in healthy older adults. Short-term inactivity induced insulin resistance in older adults in the absence of significant changes in body composition (i.e. fat mass) are not related to changes in ceramides.",

      "abstract": "Objective- Ceramides are sphingolipids involved with cellular signaling. Synthesis of ceramides occurs in all tissues. Ceramides accumulate within tissues and the blood plasma during metabolic dysfunction, dyslipidemia, and inflammation. Elevations of ceramides are predictive of cardiovascular mortality. We sought to verify the utility of plasma concentrations of 4 ceramides: N-palmitoyl-sphingosine [Cer(16:0)], N-stearoyl-sphingosine [Cer(18:0)], N-nervonoyl-sphingosine [Cer(24:1)], and N-lignoceroyl-sphingosine [Cer(24:0)] in predicting major adverse cardiovascular events in a diverse patient population referred for coronary angiography. Approach and Results- Plasma ceramides were measured in 495 participants before nonurgent coronary angiography. Coronary artery disease, defined as >50% stenosis in ≥1 coronary artery, was identified 265 (54%) cases. Ceramides were not significantly associated with coronary artery disease. Patients were followed for a combined primary end point of myocardial infarction, percutaneous intervention, coronary artery bypass, stroke, or death within 4 years. Ceramides were significantly predictive of outcomes after adjusting for age, sex, body mass index, hypertension, smoking, LDL (low-density lipoprotein) cholesterol, HDL (high-density lipoprotein) cholesterol, triglycerides, serum glucose, and family history of coronary artery disease. The fully adjusted per SD hazard ratios (95% confidence interval) were 1.50 (1.16-1.93) for Cer(16:0), 1.42 (1.11-1.83) for Cer(18:0), 1.43 (1.08-1.89) for Cer(24:1), and 1.58 (1.22-2.04) for the ceramide risk score. Conclusions- Elevated plasma concentrations of ceramides are independently associated with major adverse cardiovascular events in patients with and without coronary artery disease.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Recent studies have suggested that specific plasma ceramides are independently associated with major adverse cardiovascular events in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD), but it is currently unknown whether plasma ceramide levels are associated with stress-induced reversible myocardial ischemia. METHODS: We measured six previously identified high-risk plasma ceramide molecules [Cer(d18:1/16:0), Cer(d18:1/18:0), Cer(d18:1/20:0), Cer(d18:1/22:0), Cer(d18:1/24:0), and Cer(d18:1/24:1)] in 167 consecutive patients with established or suspected CAD who underwent either exercise or dypiridamole myocardial perfusion scintigraphy (MPS) for various clinical indications. Plasma ceramide levels were measured by a targeted liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry assay both at baseline and after MPS. RESULTS: Seventy-eight patients had inducible myocardial ischemia on stress MPS. Women had significantly higher circulating levels of basal and post-stress Cer(d18:1/16:0) and Cer(d18:1/18:0) compared to men, whereas all other plasma ceramides did not differ between the sexes. Of the six measured plasma ceramides, basal Cer(d18:1/24:1) showed the strongest association with the presence of stress-induced myocardial perfusion defects in univariate analysis (unadjusted-odds ratio 1.48 per 1-SD increment, 95% confidence interval 1.08-2.04). Notably, after adjustment for age, sex, smoking, dyslipidemia, hypertension, diabetes, prior history of CAD, left ventricular ejection fraction, and type of stress testing (exercise vs. dypiridamole), all measured ceramides, except for plasma Cer(d18:1/24:0), were independently associated with the presence of inducible myocardial ischemia. CONCLUSIONS: Distinct plasma ceramides are positive and independent predictors of stress-induced myocardial perfusion defects in patients with established or suspected CAD referred for clinically indicated MPS. Further research is needed to examine whether distinct plasma ceramides could be a useful therapeutic target for treatment and management of CAD.",

We conducted a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy of a cream compound formulated in order to reduce the oral isotretinoin side effects (redness, dryness, itching) in patients affected by severe acne of the face. METHODS: Twenty-seven patients undergoing treatment with 0.5-1 mg/kg/day for papulo-pustular or nodulo-cystic acne were randomized to additionally receive a cream composed of 8% omega-ceramides, hydrophilic sugars, 5% niacinamide applied twice daily (group A) or placebo cream (group B) applied 2 times per day. RESULTS: During the whole treatment period and after 6 months of treatment, patients in the group A showed a greater reduction of dryness, itching and redness compared to the group receiving the placebo cream.

In this study, we examined the effects of EPA ethyl ester (EPA-E) on diet-induced AD in hairless mice. Oral administration of EPA-E ameliorated skin barrier dysfunction and pruritus in AD mice.

We investigated whether ceramides are detectable in tracheal aspirates (TAs) of preterm infants and differ between infants with or without BPD. METHODS: Infants born ≤ 32 weeks of gestational age in need of mechanical ventilation in the first week of life were included. TAs were obtained directly after intubation and at day 1, 3, 5, 7, and 14. Ceramide concentrations were measured by tandem mass spectrometry. At 36 weeks postmenstrual age BPD was defined as having had ≥ 28 days supplemental oxygen. RESULTS: 122 infants were included, of which 14 died and 41 developed BPD. All infants showed an increase in ceramides after the first day of intubation. The ceramide profile differed significantly between preterm infants who did and did not develop BPD. However, the ceramide profile had no additional predictive value for BPD development over GA at birth, birth weight and total days of mechanical ventilation. CONCLUSIONS: Ceramides are measurable in TAs of preterm born infants and may be an early marker for BPD development.",

Toxins that are released from S. aureus mediate many of these effects. Here, we aimed to identify molecular mechanisms how α-toxin, a major S. aureus toxin, induces inflammation. METHODS: Macrophages were isolated from the bone marrow of wildtype and acid sphingomyelinase-deficient mice, stimulated with S. aureus α-toxin and activation of the acid sphingomyelinase was quantified. The subcellular formation of ceramides was determined by confocal microscopy. Release of cathepsins from lysosomes, activation of inflammasome proteins and formation of Interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and Tumor Necrosis Factor-α (TNF-α) were analyzed by western blotting, confocal microscopy and ELISA. RESULTS: We demonstrate that S. aureus α-toxin activates the acid sphingomyelinase in ex vivo macrophages and triggers a release of ceramides. Ceramides induced by S. aureus α-toxin localize to lysosomes and mediate a release of cathepsin B and D from lysosomes into the cytoplasm. Cytosolic cathepsin B forms a complex with Nlrc4. Treatment of macrophages with α-toxin induces the formation of IL-1β and TNF-α. These events are reduced or abrogated, respectively, in cells lacking the acid sphingomyelinase and upon treatment of macrophages with amitriptyline, a functional inhibitor of acid sphingomyelinase. Pharmacological inhibition of cathepsin B prevented activation of the inflammasome measured as release of IL-1β, while the formation of TNF-α was independent of cathepsin B. CONCLUSION: We demonstrate a novel mechanism how bacterial toxins activate the inflammasome and mediate the formation and release of cytokines: S. aureus α-toxin triggers an activation of the acid sphingomyelinase and a release of ceramides resulting in the release of lysosomal cathepsin B and formation of pro-inflammatory cytokines.",
