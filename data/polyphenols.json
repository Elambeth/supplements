      "abstract": "In recent years, green waste polyphenols (GWPs) have attracted global attention due to their abundant renewable resources and excellent antibacterial properties. We analyzed the research progress on the antimicrobial properties of natural polyphenol composites (including polyphenol-metal nanoparticles, polyphenol nanofiber membranes, polyphenol-polymer membranes, and polyphenol hydrogels) in environmental applications. The waste sources of polyphenols and the latest extraction technologies were systematically summarized, and a universal hydrodynamic cavitation-integrated membrane technology combined with polyphenol extraction and purification process was initially constructed. The inhibitory effects of GWPs on pathogenic bacteria and the antibacterial properties of polyphenol composites in the environmental field were systematically analyzed. These composites exhibited outstanding antimicrobial performance, effectively inhibiting E. coli and S. aureus by up to 100%, especially in water treatment and air filtration. In addition, the advantages, challenges, and prospects for the application of green waste polyphenol antibacterial materials (GWPAMs) in the environmental field are discussed. With high efficiency, low toxicity, antimicrobial resistance, and sustainable antimicrobial properties, GWPs exhibit significant application potential in the \"resource recycling-pollution control-ecological restoration\" synergistic system within the environmental field. Future work should focus on the green synthesis of polyphenol composites, conducting systematic and thorough investigations on their antibacterial mechanisms, and enhancing their antibacterial properties in agriculture, waste treatment, and soil remediation, to improve their environmental adaptability and sustainable application value."

      "abstract": "Agrimonia pilosa Ledeb. (APL), a traditional Chinese herb frequently employed by Professor Zhou Zhongying, a master of traditional Chinese medicine, for colorectal cancer treatment, is rich in polyphenols with potential anti-tumor properties. To elucidate its bioactive components, this study developed a two-step purification process combining macroporous resin adsorption and liquid-liquid extraction to enrich polyphenols from APL (APLs). The adsorption/desorption mechanisms of APLs on macroporous resins were systematically investigated through resin screening, adsorption kinetics, and thermodynamics. The Langmuir isotherm model confirmed the adsorption process as spontaneous and exothermic. Pseudo-second-order kinetics effectively described the adsorption behavior of D101 resin. Optimized adsorption and column elution parameters were established, followed by liquid-liquid extraction for further purification. The components were compared and analyzed by ultra-performance liquid chromatography and quadrupole time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-Q-Zeno-TOF-MS/MS). It was preliminarily identified that 29 polyphenols were mainly concentrated in water-saturated n-butanol (BEA) and ethyl acetate (ECA) extract fractions. Quantitative analysis using ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-triple quadrupole liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (UHPLC-C-QTRAP-MS/MS) revealed higher contents of catechin (66.67 ± 1.33 ng·mg-1), hyperoside (382.56 ± 3.65 ng·mg-1), and chlorogenic acid (10.60 ± 0.05 ng·mg-1) in BEA compared to ECA (46.00 ± 2.00, 239.40 ± 2.60, and 3.42 ± 0.01 ng·mg-1, respectively). In vitro experiments demonstrated that BEA exhibited superior antiproliferative activity (IC50: 434.5 μg·mL-1) and significantly inhibited CT26 tumor cell migration compared to ECA (IC50: 672.5 μg·mL-1). The enhanced biological activity of BEA may be due to its higher polyphenol content, suggesting that these compounds mediate their anti-tumor effects through different biochemical pathways. This work lays the foundation for exploring the multi-target mechanism of anti-tumor effects of APLs.",

      "abstract": "Background/Objectives:Argania spinosa L. Skeels is a Moroccan endemic plant widely used by the local population as folk medicine. This study aimed to investigate the effects of Argan fruit pulp on lipid metabolism disorders and liver steatosis in hypercaloric diet-fed mice. Methods: Animals were treated with the Argan fruit pulp extract and its fractions for 12 weeks at 100 and 200 mg Kg-1 BW daily. The analysis was conducted on lipid levels in plasma, liver, feces, and bile as well as on glycemia. The liver glutathione, malondialdehyde, and antioxidant enzyme activities were assessed. The hepatic steatosis was evaluated by measuring transaminases and alkaline phosphatase activities and examining histological sections. The polyphenol profiles were determined using HPLC-DAD. Possible underlying mechanisms in the hypolipidemic and hepatoprotective activities were predicted by molecular docking. Results: The crude extract and its aqueous fraction (rich in protocatechuic and gallic acids) significantly restored plasma lipids and glucose levels. Indeed, total cholesterol level (TCHO) was decreased in the liver but increased in bile and feces. The treatment also reduced body weight and liver and adipose tissue mass and prevented liver steatosis. The ethyl acetate fraction exhibited no effect on lipid metabolism but significantly prevented liver oxidative stress. The crude extract and its fractions appear to be nontoxic (LD50 > 5000 mg Kg-1) in mice. The phenolic acids demonstrated strong binding affinity to key targets involved in regulating lipid homeostasis, including ABCA-1, LXR, CYP7A1, HMH-CoA reductase, and PCSK-9. However, the identified flavonoids exhibited high affinities to targets involved in oxidative stress defense (SOD, CAT, and CYP2E1). Conclusions: The Argan fruit pulp, particularly its polyphenols, could be a promising natural approach for preventing cardio-metabolic diseases by improving lipid metabolism and reducing liver oxidative stress."

      "abstract": "The numerous side effects and adverse health implications associated with chemotherapies have long plagued the field of cancer care. Whilst in some cases a curative measure, this highly toxic intervention consistently scores poorly on quantitative measures of tolerability and safety. Of these side effects, cardiac and microvascular defects pose the greatest health risk and are the leading cause of death amongst cancer survivors who do not succumb to relapse. In fact, in many low-grade cancers, the risk of recurrence is far outweighed by the cardiovascular risk of morbidity. As such, there is a pressing need to improve outcomes within these populations. Polyphenols are a group of naturally occurring metabolites that have shown potential vasoprotective effects. Studies suggest they possess antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities, in addition to directly modulating vascular signalling pathways and gene expression. Leveraging these properties may help counteract the vascular toxicity induced by chemotherapy. In this review, we outline the main mechanisms by which the endothelium is damaged by chemotherapeutic agents and discuss the ability of polyphenols to counteract such side effects. We suggest future considerations that may help overcome some of the published limitations of these compounds that have stalled their clinical success. Finally, we briefly explore their pharmacological properties and how novel approaches could enhance their efficacy while minimising treatment-related side effects.",

      "abstract": "Intestinal inflammation entails a multifactorial pathophysiology, frequently treated by using anti-inflammatory drugs with severe side effects. At the same time, bioactive compounds present in plant materials and derived residues could contribute to reducing the use of such medications in terms of dosage and treatment length. Thus, the phytochemicals of winery byproducts, mainly represented by (poly)phenols, display significant anti-inflammatory and antioxidant potential. However, the functionality of bioaccessible fractions remains underexplored. This study uncovers the capacity of bioaccessible (poly)phenols of winery byproducts to modulate inflammatory mediators and secondary oxidative stress (OS). After in vitro simulated digestion, bioaccessible (poly)phenols exhibited significant inhibitory capacity of nitric oxide, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, and TNF-α production and prevented OS, lowering reactive oxygen species (ROS) resulting from disturbed cell metabolism while preserving the molecular machinery of cells, involving glutathione, catalase, superoxide dismutase, and glutathione peroxidase. The results retrieved suggested the relevance of specific profiles for efficiently preventing inflammation."

      "abstract": "The aim of this study was to extract watermelon rind (WR) pectin (WRP) and watermelon rind polyphenols (WRE) and evaluate the effect of pectin/sodium alginate composite films (WRPSA) with or without WRE on strawberry preservation. WRP was extracted using citric acid, whereas WRE was obtained through ethyl acetate extraction. The extracted WRP was characterized for composition and structural properties, multi-angle laser light scattering (MALLS), Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), x-ray diffraction (XRD), ζ-potential analysis, and rheological measurements. The pectin/SA film (WRPSA) and pectin/SA composite film containing WRE (WRPESA) were prepared. Both films were analyzed for physical properties and structurally characterized. Strawberries were wrapped with either WRPSA, WRPESA, or no treatment (exposed) and stored under lightproof conditions at 4°C for 12 days. The results showed that WRP was a low-ester pectin (degree of methylation [DM] = 38.7%) with a molecular weight of 683 kDa. WRP had typical polysaccharide characteristic peaks and good thermal stability that could be used as a film-forming substrate. WRPESA showed better mechanical strength and antioxidant capacity than that of WRPSA, indicating that WRE showed synergistic effects on the improvement of composite films. Additionally, WRPESA effectively reduced strawberry softening, color deterioration, and weight loss, in addition to the delay in the dynamic changes in sugar content and pH and accumulation of malondialdehyde (MDA). WRPESA also helped maintain the total phenolic content of the strawberries. These findings suggest that watermelon byproducts could be valorized for sustainable food packaging, reducing both agricultural waste and reliance on synthetic materials. Practical Application: This article confirmed the feasibility of a sequential extraction process for watermelon rind pectin and polyphenols, which can later be applied to industrial production lines to increase the utilization rate of watermelon rind. The practical application value of this research lies in the development of biodegradable packaging materials. By extracting pectin and polyphenols from watermelon rind, the resulting films can effectively extend the shelf life of strawberries and reduce food waste. Furthermore, this study promotes the utilization of agricultural waste, enhances the nutritional value of food, and provides new opportunities for local economic development. Additionally, it offers a scientific basis for advancing sustainable packaging technology and food preservation innovations, which is significant for environmental protection and healthy consumption.",

This systematic review and meta-analysis studied the impact of probiotics and polyphenols on heart failure biomarkers, focusing on potential improvements in heart function and inflammation. METHODS: We analyzed studies published in Embase, PubMed and Cochrane library from 2012 to 2024, focusing on randomized controlled trials. Our findings are drawn from 5 studies on probiotics, involving 401 participants, and 3 studies on polyphenols with a total of 140 participants. The analysis included assessments of LVEF, hs-CRP, creatinine and NT-proBNP levels in intervention and control groups. RESULTS: The probiotics or polyphenols from the included studies did not demonstrate significant changes in the health indicators analyzed for heart failure patients compared to placebo. CONCLUSIONS: The systematic review suggested that while the concept of dietary management for heart failure is promising, further research is necessary to validate the efficacy of probiotics and polyphenols as supplementary therapies in heart failure care, by analyzing more diverse health outcomes and patient populations.",

In the present paper, we reviewed recent advances of natural polyphenols in aging and common age-related diseases and the current technological methods to improve the bioavailability of natural polyphenols. The results showed that natural polyphenols have the potential to prevent or treat aging and common age-related diseases through multiple mechanisms. Nanotechnology, structural modifications, and matrix processing could provide strong technical support for the development of natural polyphenols to prevent or treat aging and age-related diseases. In conclusion, natural polyphenols have important potential in the prevention and treatment of aging and age-related diseases."

      "abstract": "UNLABELLED: Mpox is a globally prevalent disease that has triggered multiple epidemics over the past few decades, leading to moderate rates of hospitalisation and mortality. Recently, it has re-emerged in several countries, including the Democratic Republic of Congo, and appears to be spreading at an unprecedented pace. The disease is caused by zoonotic double-stranded DNA viruses. Due to its similarities with smallpox, distinguishing between the two can be challenging, though the smallpox vaccine typically provides immunity against Mpox. At the time of writing, no approved treatment for Mpox exists; however, several promising candidates have demonstrated the ability to inhibit viral replication, including resveratrol-a polyphenolic compound found in red wine. This study employs molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations to assess the effectiveness and stability of nine resveratrol analogues. Additionally, 2D and 3D pharmacophore models were developed for the highest-ranked docked compounds, leading to a composite pharmacophore. A structure-activity relationship analysis was also conducted using these top-performing compounds. The findings suggest that two compounds- (9) [1,1'-biphenyl]-3,4',5-triol and (11) {3-hydroxy-5-[2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethenyl]phenyl}oxidanesulfonic acid-exhibit strong binding affinity, with compound 11 potentially forming a stable complex with the thymidylate kinase of the vaccinia virus.

Intake of phytochemicals from fruits and vegetables is an effective way to improve IBD, but how these bioactivators regulate gut microbiota to exert healthy effects remains unclear. Here, we found that pretreatment with CiLi juice, particularly its polyphenol component, alleviated dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis while preserving intestinal barrier integrity. CiLi polyphenols (CL_PP) reduced inflammation and oxidative stress in colon tissue and enriched fecal short-chain fatty acids. Importantly, CL_PP significantly regulated the gut microbiome diversity, increasing beneficial bacteria (e.g., Clostridia_UCG-014, f_Muribaculaceae and Ileibacterium_valens) while decreasing harmful bacteria (Escherichia-Shigella and Romboutsia). Multiomics analysis revealed that CL_PP upregulated bioactive lipid metabolites, particularly those derived from polyunsaturated fatty acids (e.g., resolvin D2, prostaglandin A1, and glycerophosphocholine) related gene expressions (Pltp, Alox15 and Pld4). Additionally, CL-PP downregulated the oxidative stress markers (oxidized glutathione and glutathione peroxidase 3), and immune cell markers (CD8 and CD68). Fecal microbiota transplantation confirmed that the fecal microbiota from CL_PP-treated mice exhibited anti-colitis effects. These effects were diminished in antibiotic-treated mice, underscoring the importance of the gut microbiota in mediating the CL_PP's anti-inflammatory benefits. This study suggests that CL_PP is a potential modulator of gut microbiome dysbiosis for the prevention and treatment of colitis.",

The results showed that DHNPs, averaging 275.7 nm, were primarily composed of polysaccharides and high content of polyphenolic compounds (∼25%), with covalent and non-covalent interactions forming between them. Saponification increased the polyphenol release, and metabolomics identified 252 polyphenolic compounds, with 195 showing a relative increase post-treatment, including caffeic acid and (-)-catechin. An in vitro intestinal absorption test using Caco-2 cell monolayer model demonstrated that DHNPs-bound polyphenols exhibited significantly higher permeability (27.90%) compared to free polyphenols (12.38%), indicating that endocytosis may serve as a potential pathway through which DHNPs enhance polyphenol absorption.

This study investigated the effects of tea polyphenols (TPs) fumigation and microporous packaging (MP) during 10 days at 10 °C and 90-95% RH. The results indicated that the preservation effects followed the order TP + MP > MP > TP > CK, with the TP + MP treatment effectively controlling the degradation rate of chlorophyll and delaying leaf yellowing. In addition, TP + MP treatment increased the activity of antioxidant enzymes, especially catalase (CAT) and ascorbate peroxidase (APX), and also enhanced non-enzymatic systems (flavonoids, total phenolics, and ascorbic acid). Pearson's correlation analysis showed a positive correlation between the decline in postharvest quality of leaf-vegetable sweet potatoes and the increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels. This study provided a robust theoretical and technical foundation for the development of effective postharvest preservation strategies for leaf-vegetable sweet potatoes."

      "abstract": "Breast cancer remains a major global health challenge, necessitating innovative preventive and therapeutic strategies. Emerging evidence such as clinical trials suggests that the combination of exercise and polyphenol intake exerts synergistic effects in mitigating breast cancer progression by modulating key molecular pathways. Exercise enhances immune function, reduces inflammation, and regulates cellular metabolism, while polyphenols, natural compounds found in various plant-based foods, exhibit antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-carcinogenic properties. Together, these interventions influence apoptosis, oxidative stress, and ferroptosis which play crucial roles in breast cancer pathophysiology. This review explores the molecular mechanisms underlying the combined impact of exercise and polyphenols on breast cancer prevention and treatment. Understanding the interplay between exercise and polyphenols at the molecular level could pave the way for novel, non-invasive therapeutic strategies. Future research should focus on optimizing exercise regimens and dietary interventions to maximize their anti-cancer benefits. By bridging molecular insights with clinical applications, this review aims to provide a foundation for incorporating lifestyle-based interventions into breast cancer management. Our findings collectively highlight the promising potential of combining curcumin supplementation with exercise as a multifaceted approach to breast cancer treatment. The synergistic effects observed in various studies suggest that integrating lifestyle modifications with dietary interventions may enhance therapeutic efficacy and mitigate cancer progression. Further clinical investigations are warranted to validate these results and explore their applicability in human subjects. The evidence supports a holistic strategy for breast cancer management that could improve patient outcomes and quality of life during treatment."

      "abstract": "Based on the perspective of whole sorghum food, the polyphenols migration process was analyzed during microwave-combined cooking treatment utilizing wide metabolomics, simulated reactions, and molecular docking. Microstructure confirmed that microwave broke the grain cells, resulting in the elevated polyphenols contents. Flavonoids were significantly released by microwave (e.g. arbutin, eriodictyol-7-o-glucoside, narirutin, and naringenin-7-o-glucoside), which regulated the antioxidant activity of sorghum. Simulated co-gelatinization reaction revealed that polyphenols interacted non-covalently with starch, resulting in higher levels of polyphenols being retained during cooking (711.12 mg GAE/100 g). Molecular docking results exhibited that 6 flavonoids could also bind to the kafirin via hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interaction during cooking. Meanwhile, the γ-mangostin also possessed stabilized root-mean-square deviation and outstanding binding free energies. The effective retention of bioactive components under synergetic microwave and cooking treatment highlights the potential of natural ingredients in food processing, promoting a more natural approach to modern cereal nutrition."

      "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive cognitive decline, memory loss, and behavioral changes. It poses a significant global health challenge. AD is associated with the accumulation of amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) in the brain, along with chronic inflammation, dysfunctional neurons, and synapse loss. While the prevalence of AD continues to rise, the current FDA-approved drugs offer only limited effectiveness. Emerging evidence suggests that obesity, insulin resistance (IR), and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are also implicated in AD pathogenesis, with epidemiological studies and animal models confirming the impact of IR on Aβ accumulation, and high-fat diets also exacerbating Aβ accumulation. Since neuroinflammation activated by Aβ involves the nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of the activated B cell (NF-κB) pathway, the inhibition of NF-κB and NLRP3 inflammasome activation are potential therapeutic strategies in AD. Bioactive compounds, including polyphenols (resveratrol, epigallocatechin-3-gallate, curcumin, and quercetin), and omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, show promising results in animal studies and clinical trials for reducing Aβ levels, improving cognition and modulating the signaling pathways implicated in AD. This review explores the interplay between obesity, IR, inflammation, and AD pathology, emphasizing the potential of dietary compounds and their role in reducing inflammation, oxidative stress, and cognitive decline, as viable strategies for AD prevention and treatment. By integrating epidemiological findings, observational studies, and clinical trials, this review aims to provide a comprehensive understating of how metabolic dysfunctions and bioactive compounds influence AD progression.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Liver injury and uveitis pose severe threats to human health. Owing to the close relationship of physiology and pathology between the liver and the eyes, cases in which both conditions occur simultaneously are not uncommon in clinical settings, significantly complicating treatment. However, no suitable comorbid animal model has been reported, and research on the pathological mechanisms of this comorbidity is lacking. Prunella vulgaris L., a well-known traditional Chinese medicine renowned for its liver-clearing and eye-brightening properties. Prunella vulgaris polyphenols (PVPs) hold promise for improving liver injury and uveitis. However, research exploring their dual therapeutic effects within a single organism remains lacking, leaving the key active components and mechanisms of action largely uninvestigated. PURPOSE: This exploratory study aimed to establish a rat model of liver injury combined with uveitis and investigated its pathological mechanisms, evaluating the therapeutic efficacy of PVPs in alleviating liver injury combined with uveitis in rats. Additionally, it explored the mechanism of action and identified key active ingredients of PVPs, offering potential new directions for the development of clinical therapeutic drugs. METHODS: A rat model of liver injury with uveitis was established through intraperitoneal d-GalN/LPS injection. Metabolomics and proteomics were applied to investigate pathological mechanisms, followed by validation using acylcarnitine and S100A9 inhibitors. PVPs were administered to evaluate therapeutic effects and explore mechanisms involved in alleviating liver injury and uveitis. Network pharmacology combined with molecular docking identified critical active components in PVPs. Subsequent animal experiments verified the efficacy of the representative component in improving liver injury and uveitis. RESULTS: d-GalN/LPS (150 mg/kg : 1 mg/kg) induced significant liver injury and uveitis in rats. Metabolomics analysis pointed to acylcarnitine as a key metabolite, and its inhibition reduced inflammation. Proteomics analysis implicated S100A9 in inflammation and immunity. Then, we intervened with S100A9 inhibitors in the model rats. The results suggested that the pathological mechanism of liver injury and uveitis caused by d-GalN/LPS involved the upregulation of S100A9 expression, an increase in PP2A activity, the inhibition of AMPK phosphorylation, and the downregulation of CPT1A, leading to the accumulation of acylcarnitine and promoting the inflammatory response in the liver and retina. Further, experiments involving PVPs demonstrated dose-dependent improvements in liver injury and uveitis caused by d-GalN/LPS. The underlying mechanism of action involved suppression of S100A9 expression, reduction of PP2A activity, activation of AMPK, upregulation of CPT1A, and subsequent reduction in acylcarnitine accumulation in both the liver and retina. This mechanism effectively alleviated the inflammatory effects induced by d-GalN/LPS. Network pharmacology and molecular docking analyses pinpointed several key active components of PVPs-namely, rosmarinic acid, salviaflaside, esculetin, 2-hydroxycinnamic acid, 3,4-dihydroxybenzaldehyde, and 7,8-dihydroxycoumarin-that play significant roles in mitigating liver injury and uveitis. Follow-up experiments using the representative active component rosmarinic acid in rats confirmed its efficacy in improving symptoms of d-GalN/LPS-induced liver injury and uveitis, further validating the therapeutic potential of these key active components. CONCLUSIONS: This study successfully established a rat model of liver injury combined with uveitis and confirmed the efficacy of PVPs in alleviating this condition. Furthermore, it determined that the underlying mechanism involves regulation of the S100A9-PP2A-AMPK pathway, with rosmarinic acid identified as a key active compound. These findings provide a basis for clinical studies on liver-eye comorbidities and offer critical evidence for further research and drug development of PVPs in liver-clearing and eye-brightening.",

      "abstract": "Obesity has emerged as a critical global health challenge in recent decades, driving increased scientific interest in honey as a sugar alternative. Despite its perceived nutritional benefits, the inherent high fructose-glucose ratio in honey continues to raise concerns regarding metabolic implications for overweight individuals. In this study, Amur linden honey (LH) was evaluated as a low-glycemic-index (GI) dietary intervention, demonstrating significant anti-obesity effects through murine model. Subsequently, nine principal polyphenols (PC) were identified by metabolomics and proven anti-obesity activity in cellular assays, suggesting their potential role in mediating the biological effects of LH. Notably, the anti-obesity effects of LH were more pronounced as compared to the equivalent amount of glucose and fructose, and this effect was further facilitated by addition of the PC. Furthermore, LH and HP (LH with the addition of PC) attenuate obesity by modulating gut microbiota, promoting production of SCFA especially acetate and propionate etc., and activating the AMPK/PI3K/AKT pathways. The present study revealed that LH, enriched with diverse bioactive compounds, presents the potential to be a healthy and safe sugar substitutes due to its positive effects on the obesity."

      "abstract": "Breast cancer is the most common type of malignancy among women worldwide. Significant achievements have been made in diagnostic tools and cancer treatments in the past decade; however, the complexity and heterogeneity of certain breast cancer subtypes often lead to drug resistance and metastatic progression. Owing to their low toxicity and high variety, natural products and their derivatives are becoming increasingly valuable sources for small-molecule anticancer drugs. Polyphenols are becoming more widely known for their role in breast cancer prevention and as adjuvants in conventional treatment strategies. Therefore, this review focuses on the antitumor effects of curcumin, resveratrol, and polydatin on breast cancer. According to the main databases, only in vitro and preclinical studies with solid scientific backgrounds and reports of protective effects on breast cancer treatment were included. Curcumin, resveratrol, and polydatin have antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anticancer effects; indeed, they improve drug efficacy; reduce chemoresistance, angiogenesis, and tumor growth; and induce apoptosis, autophagy, and cell cycle arrest in breast cancer through multiple molecular pathways, including the suppression of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), NF-κB, PI3K/Akt/mTOR, c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), MAPK, ERK1/2, and STAT signaling pathways; the inhibition of cyclins and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and MMP-9; and the activation of p53 and microtubule-associated protein light chain 3 (LC3)."

      "abstract": "Tea polyphenols are a class of natural plant compounds with potent antioxidant properties, and their critical role in regulating lipid metabolism has been demonstrated in numerous studies. However, systematic research on the effects of tea polyphenols on lipid metabolism in lion-head geese remains limited. In this study, we examined the impact of tea polyphenols on lipid metabolism in geese through an integrative analysis of transcriptomics and metabolomics. A total of 240 healthy male lion-head geese with similar body weights at 1 day of age were randomly allocated into two treatment groups (6 replicates per group, with 20 geese per replicate). The control group received a basal diet, while the experimental group was supplemented with 1000 mg/kg of tea polyphenols (50.4 % catechin purity) in the basal diet for 18 weeks. The results indicated that serum total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) activities were significantly increased (P < 0.05), while malondialdehyde (MDA) levels were significantly decreased (P < 0.05) in the tea polyphenol group compared to the control group. Additionally, serum triglycerides (TG), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activities were significantly lower (P < 0.05) in the tea polyphenol group than in the control group. Hepatic transcriptomic analysis further revealed that tea polyphenols significantly modulated the expression of several genes involved in lipid metabolism, including angiopoietin-like 4 (ANGPTL4), which plays a role in regulating lipid homeostasis, as well as glycerophosphodiester phosphodiesterase domain containing 2 (GDPD2), immunoglobulin heavy chain (IGH), proto-oncogene protein c-fos (FOS), and matrix metallopeptidase 1 (MMP1), etc. Serum metabolomic analysis also demonstrated significant alterations in lipid metabolites induced by tea polyphenols, including the downregulation of fatty acyl metabolites such as L-Palmitoylcarnitine and Hexadecanal. Moreover, the combined analysis revealed a strong positive correlation between ANGPTL4 and the organic compounds of steroidal saponins, such as Glucoconvallasaponin B, and negative correlations with glycerophospholipid metabolites, such as LysoPC (P-16:0). The comprehensive analysis suggests that the inclusion of tea polyphenols in the diet enhances the antioxidant capacity of lion-head geese, improves hepatic lipid profiles, and regulates lipid metabolism via modulating lipid metabolism-related genes and metabolites."

The flavor results suggested that fermentation and TP reduced undesirable flavor substances (e.g. nonanal, decanal, and 3-methylbutanal), while the interaction between some volatile organic compounds produced by fermentation and protein flavor-binding sites was enhanced. Fermentation unfolded protein structures, increasing binding sites for TP and improving flavor-binding efficiency. Additionally, strong electrostatic repulsion introduced by fermentation improved the dispersion and stability of the EWP system. This approach provides a promising strategy for deodorizing and solubilizing EWP, advancing its potential in food processing.",

MRPP was able to improve the structural morphology of hepatocytes and pancreatic β-cells in diabetic mice. Its hypoglycemic mechanism may involve the upregulation of GLUT-4 and IRS-1 genes expression in the PI3K and AMPK signaling pathways, downregulation of GSK-3β, AMPK, PI3K, and AKT genes expression, and enhancement of the activity of enzymes related to glycogen synthesis and glucose metabolism. Research findings on 16S rRNA suggest that MRPP has the ability to alter the composition of the gut microbiota, impede the growth of harmful bacteria, and foster the growth of beneficial bacteria. Therefore, MRPP was capable of reshaping the specific gut microbial community and supporting its application as a novel supplement in functional foods for the treatment of T2D."

      "abstract": "The chicken's gastrointestinal tract is home to complex and diverse microbial communities that can be manipulated to enhance health and productivity. Although polyphenols have recently attracted the attention of researchers due to their potent antioxidant capabilities, their impact on the gut microbiota remains largely unexplored. Hence, in this study, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of the effects of dietary supplementation with polyphenol-rich extract from shredded, steam-exploded pine particles (PSPP) on growth, meat quality, and gut microbial dynamics in broiler chickens. Supplementation of PSPP was found to significantly improve birds' FCR until the third week of the trial but only marginally affected meat quality. Based on metataxonomic analyses of the cecal microbiotas of broilers fed increasing concentrations of PSPP, dietary PSPP modulated the composition of the cecal microbiota of the birds with a concomitant increase of Bacteroidetes and a decrease in the Firmicutes population. Similar trends were observed for the proportions of Alistipes and Faecalibacterium at the genus level. Additionally, 43 unique bacterial species were detected in the cecal microbiome of birds fed with PSPP. However, microbial diversity did not vary significantly among treatment groups. A particularly interesting finding was the specialization observed in the microbiome of birds receiving PSPP supplementation. Microbial co-occurrence network analyses revealed substantial modifications in their network structure when compared to control birds. Families like Rikenellaceae and Eubacteriaceae were notably absent, and the number of microbial interactions was drastically lower in the PSPP-fed group. Microbial taxa modeling revealed that the impact of increasing dietary PSPP levels primarily affected genus-level taxa, showing a decreasing trend. Overall, this offers compelling evidence that continuous PSPP supplementation may not only alter the composition of intestinal microbes but also have a profound effect on the interactions among different microbial species. Conversely, PSPP had minimal effects on broilers' performance and meat quality."

      "abstract": "Polyphenols (PFs) are compounds found in fruits and vegetables, known for their health-related benefits, mainly including antioxidant, antiinflammatory, and anticancer properties. However, their efficacy is limited by poor bioavailability due to issues like low solubility, rapid metabolism, and extensive excretion. Thus, research has focused on improving delivery systems, such as, for example, nanoparticles, hydrogels, cocrystals, or conjugation with carrier molecules, which may protect PFs from degradation, improve solubility, and/or facilitate targeted delivery to cancer cells. PFs are promising in modulating cancer-related pathways like cell proliferation and death, or metastatic invasion, though their translation to patients is hindered by bioavailability and complex cancer mechanisms. This review analyzes factors that affect PF bioavailability, evidences of in vivo effects in animal models and their mechanisms, results from clinical trials, and strategies to enhance bioavailability. The idea that PFs need to directly interact with the cancer cell is challenged. Future research aims to optimize delivery systems, combine PFs with standard treatments, and explore their epigenetic effects, modulation of the tumor microenvironment, and interactions with gut microbiota. Advances in personalized medicine and structural modifications to improve stability and absorption could further enhance PF anticancer potential. Despite challenges, PFs remain a promising avenue for complementary oncotherapy solutions."

      "abstract": "Neurodegenerative diseases are a group of diseases that share common features, such as the generation of misfolded protein deposits and increased oxidative stress. Among them, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), whose pathogenesis is still not entirely clear, is a complex neurodegenerative disease linked both to gene mutations affecting different proteins, such as superoxide dismutase 1, Tar DNA binding protein 43, Chromosome 9 open frame 72, and Fused in Sarcoma, and to altered iron homeostasis, mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and impaired glutamate metabolism. The purpose of this review is to highlight the molecular targets common to ALS and ferroptosis. Indeed, many pathways implicated in the disease are hallmarks of ferroptosis, a recently discovered type of iron-dependent programmed cell death characterized by increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) and lipid peroxidation. Iron accumulation results in mitochondrial dysfunction and increased levels of ROS, lipid peroxidation, and ferroptosis triggers; in addition, the inhibition of the Xc- system results in reduced cystine levels and glutamate accumulation, leading to excitotoxicity and the inhibition of GPx4 synthesis. These results highlight the potential involvement of ferroptosis in ALS, providing new molecular and biochemical targets that could be exploited in the treatment of the disease using polyphenols.",

VOCs varied with temperature and origin, but alcohols and terpenes were predominant in all samples. Hetian cumin exhibited the highest VOC content and stability under specific treatments, divided into an ambient temperature treatment (AMB) and a 70 °C heat treatment. A cluster analysis revealed high similarity between replicates and significant differences among the samples. A Venn diagram comparison showed that 70 °C processing reduced the number of common VOCs among the three origins from 36 to 19, which is a decrease of 47.22%, indicating a significant impact of heating on cumin VOCs and possibly promoting the formation of new compounds. Finally, utilizing the varying abilities of different types of polyphenols to inhibit heterocyclic aromatic amines (HAAs), six polyphenolic compounds, identified as sesamin, 6-caffeoylsucrose, apigenin, eschweilenol C, kaempferol glucuronide, and luteolin, were preliminarily determined to play an active role in the β-carboline HAA simulation system.",

Coffee peel contains abundant phytochemicals and possesses hypolipidemic and anti-inflammatory activities. The present study aimed to elucidate the preventive effect of coffee peel polyphenols (CPPs) on nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) from the perspective of CB1 signaling. Male C57BL/6J mice were fed a high-fat and high-cholesterol diet and CPPs (200/400 mg/kg/day) for 8 weeks. Serum biochemical indexes and liver pathological analysis were used to evaluate the effect of CPPs on NAFLD. Untargeted/targeted lipidomics analyses were used to evaluate the levels of endocannabinoid ligands and ceramides in serum and liver. The expression levels of proteins were detected by using Western blotting analysis. Administration of CPPs significantly improved hepatic steatosis, insulin resistance and biomarkers of liver function. Meanwhile, CPPs administration indicated reductions in endocannabinoid ligands, including anandamide and 2-arachidonoylglycerol levels, associated with blockade of CB1 overexpression. Blockage of CB1 signaling depleted hepatic C16:0- and C18:0-ceramide concentrations by enhancing ceramide metabolism. The reductions in hepatic ceramide concentrations contributed to down-regulating sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c and up-regulating proliferator activated receptor alpha, leading to decrease de novo lipogenesis and increase fatty acid β-oxidation in the liver, respectively. This study demonstrated a novel mechanism that CPPs could ameliorate NAFLD through modulating CB1-ceramide axis."

Clinically, this malignancy is considered to be one of the most difficult-to-treat cancers, owing to its resistance to common therapies like chemotherapy and radiotherapy, and few targeted therapies are available. There is currently an unmet need for treatment of EC. Polyphenols are naturally occurring plant secondary metabolites in response to environmental threats and injury. Epidemiological evidence suggests that long-term consumption of a polyphenol-rich diet is inversely associated with the risk of cancer. Currently, natural polyphenols have received increased attention for their potential therapeutic effects on EC. In this review, we summarize and discuss recent progress in the therapeutic potential of natural polyphenols in EC, as well as their sources, oral bioavailability, and pharmacokinetics. We review natural polyphenols combined with approved chemotherapy and radiotherapy to overcome challenges faced by either monotherapy. We also discuss the current challenges and future directions to accelerate the clinical application of natural polyphenols in EC. We concluded that natural polyphenols represent promising candidates for the management of EC. Well-designed randomized controlled studies are warranted to verify the efficacy and safety of natural polyphenols for EC. Knowledge gained from this review will outline possible future research directions and should help to develop new therapeutics for this disease.",

      "abstract": "Edible fungi, specifically Morels (Morchella spp.), are esteemed for their high concentration of bioactive compounds, with polyphenols being a notable component. This research focused on optimizing the ultrasound-assisted deep eutectic solvent extraction method to obtain polyphenols from Morels. The optimized process yielded 6.95 ± 0.18 mg/g of polyphenols, with optimal conditions identified as a solid-liquid ratio of 29.92 g/mL, a water content of 31.32%, an extraction temperature of 36.31°C, and a 10-min ultrasonic exposure duration. The Morchella polyphenols (MPs) demonstrated significant antioxidant and hypoglycemic activities. The phenolic compounds of MPs were analyzed via ultra performance liquid chromatography high-resolution/mass spectrometry (UPLC-HRMS/MS). Network pharmacology analysis identified caffeic acid as the main active compound, with core genes such as ALB, TNF, and EGFR. The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway enrichment analyses indicated that the hypoglycemic effects of MPs are likely linked to the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway. Collectively, these findings highlight the potential of Morchella spp. as a promising source of functional foods for managing Type 2 diabetes mellitus. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: The study introduces an environmentally sustainable approach to extract polyphenols from Morels (Morchella spp.), which have shown their potent antioxidant and hypoglycemic effects. The Morchella polyphenols could serve as functional food ingredients or natural supplements for managing Type 2 diabetes mellitus, providing a sustainable and health-oriented alternative for the food and nutraceutical industries.",

HE staining showed in MIRI edema of cardiomyocytes, localized inflammatory cell infiltration, unclear outline of cells and cell fragmentation, and some cardiomyocytes were seen to have disordered arrangement of tissues. PPA markedly lowered the morphological alterations in MIRI. The levels of levels of IL-1β and TNF-α in MIRI were significantly elevated; however, PPA reduced these cytokine concentrations compared to MIRI. Western blot analysis demonstrated that MIRI increased the relative protein expression levels of Wnt and β-catenin. Treatment of MIRI with PPA resulted in a significant decrease in protein expression levels of Wnt and β-catenin. The involvement of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway in MIRI was further affirmed with the use Wnt inhibitor group (XAV939) that also diminished protein expression levels of Wnt and β-catenin."

Treatment effectiveness is diminished in severe vasculogenic ED, particularly in patients with diabetes mellitus, highlighting the need for exploring alternative/complementary interventions. Among them, dietary phenolic compounds are known for their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. This systematic review focuses on catechin (EGCG), quercetin, resveratrol, and curcumin and their influence on the pathophysiology of ED. Following PRISMA 2020 guidelines (PROSPERO registration number CRD42023402016) searches across PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science until October 2024 were conducted using relevant keywords. Inclusion criteria required original articles in English, while in silico studies, review articles, editorials, and original studies lacking essential polyphenol administration information were excluded. After an initial search that located 409, 445, and 285 publications in each database respectively, rigorous screening resulted in 26 publications comprising animal, ex vivo, and in vitro studies. Their quality was assessed using GRADE and SYRCLE ROB tools, revealing an overall \"medium-high\" or \"high quality.\" These polyphenols consistently demonstrated improvements in erectile function, encompassing behavioral, functional, molecular, and hormonal aspects. However, limitations were identified, such as the predominant reliance on animal models and in vitro trials, which may not precisely reflect human physiological responses. Further clinical investigations are needed to ascertain data translational potential, standardize dosages, and establish safe and effective prescription recommendations. Prioritizing clinical trials is essential for validating the widespread applicability and efficacy of polyphenols in managing ED."

METHODS: The clinical records of 91 peri-implantitis patients treated at the North China University of Science and Technology Affiliated Hospital and Tangshan Hongci Hospital were analyzed retrospectively. Forty-one patients who received PDT alone were assigned to the control group, while the other 50 patients receiving both PDT and TP were allocated to the study group. Periodontal indices, inflammatory factors, swallowing function, pain, MOS 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36) scores, therapeutic effect and adverse reactions were compared between the two groups. RESULTS: Post therapy, significant reductions in the modified plaque index (mPLI), modified sulcus bleeding index (mSBI), probing depth (PD), and clinical attachment level (CAL) were observed in both groups (P<0.05), with more notable decreases in the study group (P<0.05). Besides, the levels of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6) as well as interleukin-1β (IL-1β) also decreased notably in both groups (P<0.05), with notably lower levels in the study group (P<0.05). SF-36 scores across all dimensions significantly improved in both groups (P<0.05), with the study group demonstrating more substantial improvements (P<0.05). Swallowing function scores significantly decreased in both groups (P<0.05), with a more marked improvement in the study group (P<0.05). Similarly, the VAS scores of both groups significantly decreased post-treatment (P<0.05), especially the study group (P<0.05). In contrast to the control group, a notably higher overall response rate was observed in the study group (P=0.020), while no significant inter-group difference was observed in the total incidence of adverse reactions (P=0.683). CONCLUSION: PDT plus TP is more effective than PDT alone in treating peri-implantitis. This combined approach significantly reduces inflammation, improves periodontal health, and enhances quality of life, without increasing the incidence of adverse reactions. These findings suggest its potential for broader clinical application."

However, its effectiveness has been limited by the occurrence of dose-related renal, myocardial, and bone marrow toxicities. The clinical use of DOX is associated with nephrotic syndrome characterized by heavy proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia, and hyperlipidemia. DOX-induced changes in the renal tissue of rats include increased glomerular capillary permeability and tubular atrophy. Several lines of evidence suggest that reactive oxygen species and oxidative stress have been associated with DOX-induced renal damage. The mechanism of DOX-induced nephrotoxicity is believed to be mediated through free radical formation, iron-dependent oxidative damage of biological macromolecules, and membrane lipid peroxidation. Polyphenols are present in high concentration in fruits and vegetables. They have been shown to have potent antioxidant and cytoprotective effects in preventing endothelial apoptosis caused by oxidants. Treatment with polyphenols has been shown to prevent liver damage and suppress overexpression of inducible nitric oxide synthase, which is induced by various inflammatory stimuli. In addition, epidemiological studies have suggested that the intake of polyphenols may be associated with a reduced risk of DOX-induced nephrotoxicity by modulating inflammatory cytokines, apoptosis, oxidative stress, and oxidative DNA damage. Therefore, in the present review, we examined the influence of polyphenols on DOX-induced nephrotoxicity."

Although surgery is the primary treatment option for gastric cancer, adjuvant chemotherapy improves survival in patients following surgery. Proverbially, plant polyphenols have many beneficial health effects, including anticancer properties. Extensive studies have shown that plant polyphenols exhibit potential anticancer effects against gastric cancer in vitro and in vivo, as well as very few human studies. However, this topic has not yet been reviewed. The present review shows that the potential anticancer effect of plant polyphenols on gastric cancer was preliminarily attributed to their antiproliferative, antimetastatic, and antiangiogenic effects and modulations of apoptosis, autophagy, and intracellular reactive oxygen species. Moreover, conventional therapeutics combined with plant polyphenols make gastric cancer cells more sensitive to conventional therapy. We also discuss challenges and opportunities in translating plant polyphenol-based therapy to clinical applications. The content provided in this review is of interest to pharmacologists, ethnobotanists, and oncologists who are involved in phytomedicine."

      "abstract": "Hexavalent chromium [Cr(VI)] presents substantial environmental and health hazards due to its pronounced toxicity and mobility in soils. Traditional chemical reduction methods for Cr(VI) are often inadequate for treating chromium-contaminated soils, as they may fail to fully reduce Cr(VI), leading to incomplete remediation. Consequently, there is a critical need to develop more efficient and environmentally sustainable methods for the treatment of hexavalent chromium. This study explores an innovative approach using microwave-enhanced reduction of soil iron minerals facilitated by tea polyphenols to achieve transformational fixation of Cr(VI). The microwave-assisted treatment (0.5 wt% TP combined with MW at 700 W for 10 min) significantly reduced Cr(VI) concentrations in iron-rich soil from 363.4 mg kg-1 to 0.3 mg kg-1, achieving a removal rate of 99.9%, compared to TP treatment alone (0.5 wt%). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analyses revealed that the enhanced removal efficiency of Cr(VI) by microwave-assisted tea polyphenols is attributable to the accelerated reduction of soil iron minerals by the polyphenols. Furthermore, microwave enhancement facilitated the transformation of Cr into more stable forms, such as Cr2O3 and FeCr2O4. Additionally, the Cr(VI) content in the treated soil remained below 3 mg kg-1 after 360 days of atmospheric exposure, indicating sustained immobilization. This study demonstrates that the integration of tea polyphenols with microwave irradiation constitutes a promising strategy for the remediation of Cr(VI)-contaminated soils.",

      "abstract": "The complex nature of osteoarthritis (OA), driven by the intricate interplay of genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors, necessitates the development of a single treatment method, which is highly challenging. The long-term use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and corticosteroids often leads to adverse side effects like kidney damage and stomach ulcers. Major health threats like obesity and aging create a milieu of chronic low-grade inflammation and increased mechanical stress on the joints resulting in cartilage deterioration. Additionally, postmenopausal women with lower circulating 17β-estradiol levels experience accelerated joint deterioration due to increased immune activity resulting in the increased production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, with elevated MMP expression and decreased type II collagen synthesis. Polyphenols are nature's gifted magic molecules, which possess diverse biological properties like anti-oxidant, anti-bacterial, anti-inflammatory, estrogenic, and insulin-sensitizing effects, which can manage and treat all the multi-factorial contributing factors of OA effectively. Certain polyphenols can act as phytoestrogens and mimic the effects of natural estrogen by binding to ERα and ERβ and can act as SERMs and prevent degradation of the articular cartilage thereby alleviating osteoarthritic conditions. These molecules downregulate the expression of various pro-inflammatory cytokines, apoptotic genes, and matrix-degrading proteases (MMPs) while upregulating major ECM proteins like type II collagen, aggrecan, and proteoglycans in various osteoarthritic animal models. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the molecular mechanisms involved in OA development and also explores the therapeutic potential of different polyphenols in mitigating joint inflammation and their protective effect in inhibiting the degradation of cartilage extracellular matrix (ECM) and enhancing joint homeostasis."

      "abstract": "Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a global health problem due to its high death and morbidity worldwide, which is characterized by an incompletely reversible limitation in airflow that is not fully reversible. Unfortunately, Western medical treatments are unable to reverse the progressive decline in lung function. Importantly, polyphenolic compounds isolated from Chinese herbal medicine exhibited therapeutic/interventional effects on COPD in preclinical studies. This review systematically analyzed the pathogenesis of COPD, such as inflammation, oxidative stress, protease/antiprotease imbalance, aging, cell death, and dysbiosis of gut microbiota. Moreover, this review summarized the regulatory mechanisms of natural polyphenolic compounds for the treatment of COPD. Several studies have demonstrated that natural polyphenolic compounds have therapeutic effects on COPD by regulating various biological processes, such as anti-inflammatory, reduction of oxidative damage, anti-cell death, and inhibition of airway hyperglycemia. Mechanistically, this review found that the promising effects of natural polyphenolic compounds on COPD were mainly achieved through modulating the NF-κB and MAPK inflammatory pathways, the Nrf2 oxidative stress pathway, and the SIRT1/PGC-1α lung injury pathway. Furthermore, this review analyzed the efficacy and safety of natural polyphenolic compounds for the treatment of COPD in clinical trials, and discussed their challenges and future development directions. In conclusion, this review combined the latest literature to illustrate the various pathogenesis and interrelationships of COPD in the form of graphs, texts, and tables, and sorted out the functional role and mechanisms of natural polyphenols in treating COPD, with a view to providing new ideas and plans for the in-depth research on COPD and the systemic treatment of COPD with Chinese herbal medicine."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Because aberrant Rho GTPase signaling has been associated with multiple cancers, it was investigated as a potential target for liver cancer treatment drugs. The important medicinal plant Hippophae rhamnoides, found in the Karakoram Mountains, is believed to contain polyphenols that inhibit RhoA protein, thus potentially eliciting effects against liver cancer. METHODS: Polyphenols were identified in the methanolic extract of H. rhamnoides with HPLC, then screened for their anticancer potential against the RhoA protein through molecular docking and molecular dynamic simulations. The RMSD and RMSF values for each selected compound were determined, and ADMET characteristics were analyzed. RESULTS: The polyphenols gallic acid, salicylic acid, caffeic acid, kaempferol, rutin, quercetin, coumarin, ferulic acid, sinapic acid, HB acid, vanillic acid, and chlorogenic acid were found in the methanolic extract of H. rhamnoides. On the basis of Lipinski's rule of five, the Vina score, and the cavity size, we chose five ligands with favorable features for further research. Caffeic acid was the most promising compound, on the basis of favorable ADMET qualities, and the best docking score and MD simulation results. CONCLUSION: Caffeic acid remained intact and bound the protein structure throughout the simulation run, thus demonstrating a robust interaction between the protein and ligand, and indicating a possible inhibitory effect. Therefore, this compound might have the greatest ability to inhibit the RhoA protein. Further research is required to examine caffeic acid as a potential medication option for future drug development."

Current therapeutic options are limited and may cause adverse side effects, highlighting the need to develop safer and more effective formulations. Therefore, the objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of a formulation based on the bioactive fraction of Bacopa procumbens (BFNB), conjugated with gold nanoparticles, on hair growth through the modulation of apoptosis in C57BL/6 mice. Methods: The potential biological activities of the secondary metabolites of B. procumbens present in BFNB were analyzed in silico. In vivo experiments evaluated the expression of pro-apoptotic markers p53, caspase 3-p11, caspase 9-p10, and Bax, as well as anti-apoptotic marker Bcl-2, through Western blotting. Immunohistochemistry further assessed the expression and localization of some of these markers. Additionally, molecular docking and interactomic analyses were performed, complemented by functional enrichment, to explore molecular pathways modulated by the evaluated proteins. Results: In silico analyses suggested that BFNB metabolites are involved in the modulation of hair growth, hair fragility, and apoptosis. This finding was supported by in vivo experiments in mice, where BFNB significantly decreased the expression of p53, caspase 3-p11, caspase 9-p10, and Bax while increasing Bcl-2 levels. Immunohistochemistry showcased a reduction in pro-apoptotic markers in dermal and follicular bulb cells. Furthermore, molecular docking studies identified BFNB metabolites as potential direct modulators of these key proteins, strengthening evidence of their role in apoptotic regulation. The interactomic analysis highlighted 50 proteins associated with apoptosis, and functional enrichment underscored key processes such as p53 signaling, regulation of the apoptosome, and mitochondrial membrane involvement in the intrinsic apoptosis mechanism, among other pathways. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that BFNB effectively modulates apoptosis through key molecular mechanisms, highlighting its potential as an innovative therapy for promoting hair growth."

Due to the natural and non-invasive approach of phytotherapy, research for novel alternatives, such as polyphenols, to treat skin disorders is a subject of interest in modern medicine. Polyphenols, in particular, have been considered because of their anti-inflammatory, antitumoral, antimicrobial, and antioxidant properties, low molecular weight, and lipophilic nature that enables the passage of these compounds through the skin barrier. This review discusses the treatment of common dermatological diseases such as acne vulgaris, fungal infections, dermatitis, alopecia, and skin cancer, using polyphenols as therapeutic and prophylactic options. The specific molecules considered for each disorder, mechanisms of action, current clinical trials, and proposed applications are also reviewed."

The search was conducted in various databases for articles published in the last 10 years, with strict inclusion and exclusion criteria. Of the 490 articles found, 40 were considered relevant. Acne vulgaris is a common dermatological disorder characterised by inflammation of the sebaceous glands, often resulting in the development of pimples, cysts, and scarring. Conventional treatments, including antibiotics and topical retinoids, frequently demonstrate limitations such as side effects, resistance, and insufficient skin absorption. Recent advancements in nanotechnology have enabled the creation of innovative drug-delivery systems that enhance the effectiveness and reduce the adverse effects of anti-acne medications. Polyphenols and flavonoids, natural bioactive compounds with notable anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and antibacterial properties, are recognised for their therapeutic effectiveness in acne treatment. However, their practical application is hindered by insufficient solubility, stability, and bioavailability. The incorporation of these compounds into nanoparticle-based delivery systems has shown promise in resolving these challenges. Various nanoparticle platforms, including lipid-based nanoparticles, polymeric nanoparticles, and solid lipid nanoparticles, are evaluated for their ability to improve the stability, controlled release, and targeted delivery of polyphenols and flavonoids to the skin. The advent of polyphenol and flavonoid-loaded nanoparticles marks a new acne therapy era."

Recently, the Omani medicinal plant Anogeissus dhofarica (now Terminalia dhofarica) was attributed to the genus Terminalia based on phylogenetic studies. Leaves, bark, and extracts of T. dhofarica are traditionally used for various medicinal purposes, including wound treatment and personal hygiene. In the present study, the phytochemical profile of leaves from T. dhofarica was evaluated by ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with electrospray ionization high-resolution mass spectrometry (UHPLC-ESI-HRMS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Simple phenolics, polyphenolics (e.g., flavonoids and tannins) and their glucosides were characterized as major metabolite classes. In addition, 20 phenolics were isolated and structurally identified. Nine of these compounds were never described before for T. dhofarica. For the first time, we provide complete NMR data for 1-O-galloyl-6-O-p-coumaroyl-d-glucose (1). Biological screening demonstrated moderate efficacy against the Gram-negative bacterium Aliivibrio fischeri, the phytopathogenic fungus Septoria tritici, and the oomycete Phytophthora infestans. In summary, the data expand the knowledge of the phytochemistry of the underexplored species T. dhofarica and underscore its potential for therapeutic applications, particularly in the context of traditional medicine.",

This study's scope is to examine the possible association between total and individual (poly)phenol intake, major dietary sources, and the severity of multiple sclerosis (MS) in a cohort of MS patients. Participants' demographics, physical activity, smoking, and dietary information were collected, alongside clinical parameters including the Expanded Disability Status Score (EDSS), Multiple Sclerosis Severity Score (MSSS), MS phenotype, and current therapy. A validated 110-item food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) was used to assess participants' habits. The (poly)phenol content of foods was estimated using the Phenol-Explorer database. Data from 106 participants were analyzed. A high intake of vegetables was associated with a 4.6-fold higher probability of mild MS (95% CI: 1.49, 14.28), whereas no association was found for other food and beverage sources. Hydroxycinnamic acids were significantly related to MSSS (OR: 6.55, 95% CI: 2.15, 19.92). Although coffee intake differed significantly between patients with mild and severe MS (90.5 ± 53.9 vs. 59.4 ± 40.8 mL/d, respectively), linear regression analysis did not confirm an association with MSSS. A higher intake of hydroxycinnamic acids and vegetables may impact MS severity. Coffee's role remains unclear and needs to be further investigated."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Doxorubicin (DOX) is a powerful chemotherapeutic agent commonly employed in cancer treatment. However, its clinical utility is constrained by dose-dependent cardiotoxicity, which can result in heart failure and sudden cardiac death. The molecular mechanisms of DOX-induced cardiotoxicity (DIC) include oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and the activation of cell death pathways, including ferroptosis. There is an urgent need for effective therapeutic strategies to mitigate DIC. METHODS: This study investigates the cardioprotective effects of Astragalus Polyphenols (ASP), a bioactive compound extracted from Astragalus membranaceus. In the context of DIC, we utilized AC16 and H9C2 cardiomyocytes to establish a DIC model and assessed the effects of ASP on cell viability, oxidative stress, mitochondrial function, and the PI3K/AKT/NRF2 signaling pathway. The expression of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), markers of cardiac injury, was also evaluated. RESULTS: ASP treatment significantly reversed DOX-induced reductions in cell viability and mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) while also decreasing the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Additionally, ASP also downregulated the expression of ANP and BNP, indicating a protective effect on cardiomyocytes. Furthermore, ASP activated the PI3K/AKT/NRF2 pathway, which was suppressed by DOX. Inhibition of this pathway using LY294002 and ML385 abolishes the protective effects of ASP, suggesting that ASP mediates its effects through the PI3K/AKT/NRF2 signaling axis. CONCLUSION: ASP exhibits a protective effect against DOX-induced cardiotoxicity by regulating the PI3K/AKT/NRF2 pathway to reduce oxidative stress and preserve mitochondrial function. These findings suggest that ASP may serve as a potential therapeutic agent to alleviate DIC. Our results provide a novel strategy to protect the heart in patients undergoing DOX chemotherapy.",

Therefore, mitigating the oxidative stress induced by fluorosis has become a significant research concern. Consequently, how to relieve oxidative stress caused by fluorosis is an urgent matter. In the present study, intestinal porcine epithelial (IPEC-J2) cells were chosen to explore the underlying mechanism of tea polyphenols (TPs) on F-induced oxidative stress. The results show that the cytotoxicity of IPEC-J2 cells induced by F presented a dose-dependent manner according to cell viability. Additionally, F treatment inhibited the activity of T-SOD, CAT, and GSH-Px as well as their transcription levels, increased the reactive oxygen (ROS) formation and cell damage rates, and then promoted cell apoptosis through the results of TUNEL and mitochondrial membrane potential detection when compared with the IPEC-J2 cells from the control group. As the main antioxidant ingredient in tea, TPs alleviated F-induced cell oxidation and apoptosis via blocking F-induced ROS generation and LDH's release, as well as promoting the transcription of tight junction (TJ) proteins and the activities of antioxidant enzymes in IPEC-J2 cells. These results provide a new treatment strategy for F-induced intestinal oxidative impairment."

      "abstract": "Neurodegenerative diseases comprise a group of chronic, usually age-related, disorders characterized by progressive neuronal loss, deformation of neuronal structure, or loss of neuronal function, leading to a substantially reduced quality of life. They remain a significant focus of scientific and clinical interest due to their increasing medical and social importance. Most neurodegenerative diseases present intracellular protein aggregation or their extracellular deposition (plaques), such as α-synuclein in Parkinson's disease and amyloid beta (Aβ)/tau aggregates in Alzheimer's. Conventional treatments for neurodegenerative conditions incur high costs and are related to the development of several adverse effects. In addition, many patients are irresponsive to them. For these reasons, there is a growing tendency to find new therapeutic approaches to help patients. This review intends to investigate some phytocompounds' effects on neurodegenerative diseases. These conditions are generally related to increased oxidative stress and inflammation, so phytocompounds can help prevent or treat neurodegenerative diseases. To achieve our aim to provide a critical assessment of the current literature about phytochemicals targeting neurodegeneration, we reviewed reputable databases, including PubMed, EMBASE, and COCHRANE, seeking clinical trials that utilized phytochemicals against neurodegenerative conditions. A few clinical trials investigated the effects of phytocompounds in humans, and after screening, 13 clinical trials were ultimately included following PRISMA guidelines. These compounds include polyphenols (flavonoids such as luteolin and quercetin, phenolic acids such as rosmarinic acid, ferulic acid, and caffeic acid, and other polyphenols like resveratrol), alkaloids (such as berberine, huperzine A, and caffeine), and terpenoids (such as ginkgolides and limonene). The gathered evidence underscores that quercetin, caffeine, ginkgolides, and other phytochemicals are primarily anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and neuroprotective, counteracting neuroinflammation, neuronal oxidation, and synaptic dysfunctions, which are crucial aspects of neurodegenerative disease intervention in various included conditions, such as Alzheimer's and other dementias, depression, and neuropsychiatric disorders. In summary, they show that the use of these compounds is related to significant improvements in cognition, memory, disinhibition, irritability/lability, aberrant behavior, hallucinations, and mood disorders."

      "abstract": "Prostate cancer (PCa) can remain asymptomatic for years, complicating early detection and effective intervention. Predictive, Preventive, and Personalized Medicine (3PM) provides a transformative framework for addressing these challenges by integrating novel biomarkers, targeted prevention, and individualized therapies. Recent studies highlight the pivotal role of dysregulated microRNAs (miRNAs) and epigenetic alterations in cancer progression and metastasis. miRNAs, as non-coding RNAs approximately 22 nucleotides in length, regulate gene expression through translational inhibition or mRNA degradation. Dysregulated miRNAs are linked to the overexpression of oncogenic proteins and suppression of tumor suppressor genes in malignancies. Polyphenols such as curcumin, quercetin, resveratrol, and green tea catechins (EGCG) have demonstrated potential in modulating miRNA expression and reversing aberrant epigenetic modifications. Despite their established anticancer effects, the clinical application of polyphenols in stratified patient groups, particularly in primary and secondary cancer prevention, remains underexplored. Beyond their anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, polyphenols modulate early epigenetic and biogenetic events critical for cancer prevention and therapy. By targeting predictive biomarkers and improving therapy response, polyphenols contribute significantly to 3PM by enabling early diagnostics, mitigating risks, and personalizing treatments. This review evaluates current knowledge of polyphenols' impact on miRNAs and epigenetics in PCa and explores their potential applications within the 3PM framework, emphasizing predictive diagnostics, targeted prevention, and personalized treatment strategies."

      "abstract": "YAP-Zn, CGA-Zn and phlorizin-Zn complexes were prepared by thinned-young apple polyphenols (YAP), chlorogenic acid (CGA), and phlorizin with zinc chloride. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H NMR), and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) were employed to characterize the structures of the three ligands and their respective complexes. The results showed that zinc ions were complexed with phenolic hydroxyl and carboxyl groups of YAP at a ratio of 1:3, and the thermal stability of the complexes were improved compared to the YAP. YAP and YAP-Zn have minimum inhibitory concentration against P. gingivalis (8.00 mg/mL and 2.00 mg/mL), with viability of 47.89 % and 36.94 %, respectively. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and flow cytometer observation revealed that YAP-Zn could cause more significant changes of the P. gingivalis cells and induce cell death, compared with YAP treatment. With the increase of YAP and YAP-Zn concentrations, the permeability of the outer membranes (OM) and inner membranes (IM) of P. gingivalis dramatically increased and the membrane potential (MP) decreased, and the YAP-Zn treatment was even more. These results demonstrated that YAP-Zn exhibited stronger antibacterial activity against P. gingivalis compared to the YAP. It is speculated that the complexation of YAP with zinc ions enhanced the thermal stability and antibacterial activity of YAP. YAP-Zn complexes are expected to use an antibacterial agents for halitosis-related bacteria in dental care.",

      "abstract": "Neosalanx taihuensis (N. taihuensis) is an important freshwater fish species, rich in nutrients and proteins. However, myofibrillar proteins (MPs), as the major component of muscle, are prone to oxidative denaturation. Tea polyphenols (TPs), as natural antioxidants, have broad applications in the area of aquatic product manufacturing. The research examined the impacts of three typical catechins, namely epicatechin (EC), epigallocatechin (EGC), and epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), on the structure and gel characteristics of MP from N. taihuensis under oxidative treatment conditions. In comparison to the oxidized group, all three TP compounds notably slowed down the oxidation process of MP and decreased the production of oxidative products. Additionally, TP addition induced changes in the MP structure, with further exposure of hydrophobic regions. Furthermore, TP treatment notably enhanced the functional properties of MP gels, including optimized gel strength, improved water holding capacity (WHC), and altered rheological properties. Among the three TP compounds, EGCG, due to its higher number of phenolic rings, formed complexes with MP that exhibited greater antioxidant activity. The research results indicated that the WHC of the EGCG group had increased by 17.06 % compared to the oxidized group, and the decrease in amino content reached as much as 40.09 %. Finally, molecular docking simulations were performed to explore the ways in which TP and MP interact. This study not only uncovers the relationship between polyphenol types and MP structure, but also confirms the enormous potential of TP as antioxidants in the improvement of N. taihuensis surimi products."

      "abstract": "Aging is a major risk factor for neurodegenerative diseases. With aging of the global population, the prevalence of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD), has increased worldwide. Unfortunately, the available therapeutic options for these neurodegenerative diseases are limited, most of which only provide symptomatic relief and have potentially serious side effects. Epidemiological studies have shown that green tea consumption is associated with a lower prevalence of cognitive decline and decreased risk of AD and PD, providing an attractive preventive and therapeutic option. Polyphenols are major bioactive components in green tea, which contribute to the beneficial effects of green tea. Accumulating data suggest that green tea polyphenols (GTPs) have neuroprotective properties that inhibit the pathological development of neurodegenerative diseases; however, the underlying mechanisms are not yet completely understood. This paper reviews both in vitro and in vivo evidence that demonstrates the neuroprotective effects of GTPs against neurodegenerative diseases, with the main focus on AD and PD, and summarizes the possible molecular mechanisms by which GTPs impede the progression of neurodegeneration. In particular, this review highlights the modulation of GTPs on the common mechanisms involved in pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases, including oxidative stress-mediated neuronal toxicity, impaired proteostasis, and metal ion dyshomeostasis. The potential of using GTPs in the intervention of neurodegenerative diseases is also discussed, hopefully, providing useful insights into novel preventive and therapeutic strategies for these diseases.",

      "abstract": "Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive subtype with poor prognosis. Recently, polyphenols derived from the husk of T. acornis (HTA) have shown promise as potential cancer treatment agents. This study aimed to explore the anti-TNBC effects and mechanisms of HTA polyphenols in vitro using MDA-MB-231 TNBC cells, a representative cell line of this type. Initially, we assessed the impact of HTA polyphenols on cell proliferation, invasion, migration, cell cycle, and apoptosis. Key active compounds, 1,2,3,6-tetra-O-galloyl-beta-d-glucose (TGG) and gallic acid (GA), were identified for their anti-TNBC properties. Transcriptome data analysis, GO annotation, KEGG enrichment, and protein-protein interaction (PPI) analysis revealed significant pathways in HTA polyphenol-treated MDA-MB-231 cells. A total of 3312 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified, including 19 related to the Fanconi anemia (FA) pathway. Many of these DEGs are primarily involved in processes such as DNA replication, cell cycle regulation, and extracellular matrix (ECM)-receptor interactions. Consistent with these changes, FANCD2 and FANCG, among the 19 DEGs, were found to be downregulated in cells treated with HTA polyphenols, TGG, and GA. This was confirmed by western blotting and immunofluorescence assays. In conclusion, HTA has a significant anti-TNBC effect by inhibiting cancer occurrence and development. The underlying molecular mechanism may be associated with its modulation of the FA pathway. Overall, these findings underscore the potential of HTA polyphenols as a therapeutic agent or functional food for TNBC patients.",

      "abstract": "Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a complex disease that can lead to a variety of life-threatening secondary health conditions. Current treatment strategies primarily revolve around tight glucose control, which is difficult to achieve and often turns out to be dangerous because of possible hypoglycemic events. Numerous long-term studies have demonstrated that complex pathways, including low-grade inflammation due to fluctuating glucose levels, are involved in the progression of the disease and the development of secondary health conditions. Growing clinical evidence supports the effectiveness of using multiple medications, possibly in combination with insulin, to effectively manage T2DM. Despite the huge, largely untapped potential therapeutic benefit of polyphenols, there remains a general skepticism of the practice. However, for any evidence-based clinical intervention, the balance of benefits and risks takes center stage and is governed by biopharmaceutics principles. In this article, we outline the current clinical perspectives on pharmaceutical drug combinations, rationale for early initiation of insulin, and advantages of novel dosage forms to meet the pathophysiological changes of T2DM, emphasizing the need for further clinical studies to substantiate these approaches. We also make the case for traditional medicines and their combinations with pharmaceutical drugs and outline the inherent challenges in doing so, while also providing recommendations for future research and clinical practice. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Type 2 diabetes is associated with life-threatening secondary health conditions that are often difficult to treat. This review provides an in-depth account of preventing/delaying secondary health conditions through combination therapies and emphasizes the role of effective delivery strategies in realizing the translation of such combinations. This review builds the case for the importance of polyphenols in diabetes, determines the reasons for skepticism, and discusses potential combinations with pharmaceutical drugs.",

Polyphenols are among their major bioactive components. This study aimed to explore the anti-obesity properties and mechanisms of raw (R-TP) and ripened (F-TP) Pu-erh tea polyphenols. RESULTS: The results showed that R-TP and F-TP significantly reduced body weight, improved insulin resistance, and enhanced glucose and lipid metabolism in high-fat-diet (HFD)-induced obese mice. Mild differences were observed in their impact on fat metabolism, carbohydrate metabolism, and inflammation levels. Both R-TP and F-TP were able to restore the disrupted intestinal flora caused by HFD treatment, returning them to a composition and levels similar to those of normal mice. Interestingly, the gut microbiota of all the mice could be reclassified into three enterotypes (enterotype Type-1, Type-2, and Type-HFD). Lactobacillaceae predominated in Type-1. Lactobacillaceae, Muribaculaceae, and Lachnospiraceae were the most common in Type-2. Type-HFD was primarily composed of Atopobiaceae, Lachnospiraceae, Lactobacillaceae, Ruminococcaceae, and Erysipelotrichaceae. The small differences in the effects of R-TP and F-TP may be due to variations in enterotypes. CONCLUSION: These findings indicate that R-TP and F-TP can alleviate obesity by regulating the enterotype of gut microbiota, suggesting that they possess the potential for application in the treatment of obesity and the development of anti-obesity agents. © 2025 Society of Chemical Industry.",

METHODS: This study utilized ultrasonic-assisted extraction to optimize the extraction of polyphenols from honeysuckle leaves through response surface methodology (RSM). Enzyme inhibition and fluorescence quenching experiments were conducted to examine the inhibitory activity and binding behavior of the extracted polyphenols. RESULTS: The results indicated that the optimal conditions for polyphenol extraction were as follows: ethanol concentration, 64%, liquid-solid ratio, 45 mL/g, ultrasonic power, 700 W, ultrasonic time, 6 min. Under these conditions, the yield of polyphenols from honeysuckle leaves was 9.16 ± 0.19%, which closely aligns with the predicted value of 9.18%. The total phenolic content of the polyphenol extracts was 20.6 ± 0.67%, with chlorogenic acid and luteoloside contents measuring 5.65 ± 0.40% and 2.51 ± 0.14%, respectively. The inhibitory effect of polyphenol extracts (IC50, 0.14 ± 0.01 mg/mL) on α-glucosidase was better than that of chlorogenic acid (IC50, 0.55 ± 0.02 mg/mL). Fluorescence quenching experiments indicated that the polyphenol extracts interact with α-glucosidase, resulting in alterations to the microenvironment of amino acid residues. DISCUSSION: This interaction can reduce the binding affinity between the substrate and α-glucosidase, thereby contributing to the objective of lowering postprandial hyperglycemia. Our research results can provide reference for the development and utilization of honeysuckle leaves."

This study aimed to evaluate the effect of this food on the early stages of colon carcinogenesis induced by 1,2-dimethylhydrazine (DMH) at 20 mg kg-1. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were administered either water or a suspension of Arbequina table olives (OA; 3.85 g kg-1) by gavage at 10 mL kg-1 for 49 days. Each group was then divided into two subgroups that received subcutaneous injections of the carcinogen (DMH+/Olives- and DMH+/Olives+) or the solvent (DMH-/Olives- and DMH-/Olives+) on days 8, 15, and 22. Analysis by LC-MS of AO enabled us to calculate the administered doses of PT (12.38 mg kg-1) and P (4.02 g kg-1) as well as the colon content of these compounds. At the end of the intervention, we found 5.1% of PT and 0.2% of P of the administered dose in the colonic content of the DMH+/Olives+ group. The highest concentrations were for maslinic and oleanolic acids (321 ± 67 and 84.8 ± 14.3 nmol g-1, respectively) followed by hydroxytyrosol (3.31 ± 0.24 nmol g-1). The supplementation with AO reduced aberrant crypt foci by 54.1%, and mucin depleted foci by 35.7% compared to the control group. The daily consumption of table olives exerts chemopreventive activities by reducing preneoplastic intestinal lesions, which might be explained, at least in part, by the significant concentrations of PT and P remaining in the colon.",

Despite the widespread use of gemcitabine (Gem)-based chemotherapy as the first-line treatment for PC, its efficacy is often compromised by significant drug resistance. 1,2,3,4,6-Pentagaloyl glucose (PGG), a natural polyphenol, has demonstrated potential in sensitizing PC cells to Gem. However, its clinical application is limited by poor water solubility and bioavailability. In this study, we developed a novel PGG-based nanocarrier (FP) using a straightforward, one-step self-assembly method with Pluronic F127 and PGG. Our results showed that FP induced DNA damage and immunogenic cell death (ICD) in both in vitro cell experiments and patient-derived organoid models, exhibiting potent anti-tumor effects. Furthermore, in mouse KPC and PDX models, FP, when combined with Gem, showed enhanced Gem sensitization compared to pure PGG, largely due to increased DNA damage and ICD induction. These findings demonstrate the potential of FP to improve the stability and utilization of PGG as effective Gem sensitizers in the treatment of pancreatic cancer, providing a promising pathway for clinical application and translational research."

We examine the molecular pathways through which polyphenols exert their effects, including their influence on oxidative stress modulation, inflammatory responses, cellular proliferation, apoptosis, and estrogen receptor signalling. Additionally, this review addresses innovative nano-based drug delivery systems such as nanoparticles, liposomes, niosomes, and phytosomes that enhance the stability, bioavailability, and targeted delivery of polyphenols. These advanced formulations aim to overcome challenges related to polyphenol degradation, low solubility, and rapid systemic clearance, thereby enhancing their therapeutic efficacy. Through a detailed analysis, we assess the contributions of various nanocarriers in optimizing the delivery of polyphenols specifically to breast cancer cells while minimizing systemic toxicity. The evidence presented highlights the potential of polyphenols in breast cancer management, further supported by nanoformulations that improve both stability and delivery efficiency."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Diet composition is important for health, especially during critical periods such as pre-gestation (P), gestation (G), or lactation (S), due to its potential impact not only on the mother but on the offspring. The Mediterranean diet includes many healthy foods rich in fiber and/or polyphenols, such as whole grains, fruits, vegetables, beans, and nuts. The present preclinical study assesses the impact of a diet rich in fiber and polyphenols (HFP diet) during one of those three periods (P, G, or S, three weeks each) on the rat gene expression of the small intestine obtained at the end of the lactation period. METHODS: This analysis was performed by the mRNA two step PCR amplification by random primers and poly-T, followed by library generation and HiSeq X-Ten Illumina sequencing (Seqplexing), and further confirmed by Real time PCR and ELISA. RESULTS: The results showed a broad number of genes significantly modulated after the HFP diet compared to the reference diet, with a higher number of genes modulated when the supplementing period was closer to the analysis day (S > G > P). Notably, genes involved in immune signaling, intestinal absorption, and cell growth were among those more significantly affected by the HFP dietary intervention. The HFP diet influenced the expression of key genes such as ferritin, fatty acid synthase, apelin, and complement proteins, among others. There was a unique gene modified in all the intervention periods (Family with Sequence Similarity 117 Member A, Fam117A, which codifies a protein with unknown function), indicating that this molecule may participate critically in the effects induced by fiber and polyphenols during these periods. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, in rats, the influence of diet for a three-week period around birth is able to modulate the intestinal gene expression, and consequently, maternal health, which can eventually have an indirect impact on the offspring.",

      "abstract": "Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), a serious metabolic disorder, is a worldwide health problem due to the alarming rise in prevalence and elevated morbidity and mortality. Chronic hyperglycemia, insulin resistance, and ineffective insulin effect and secretion are hallmarks of T2DM, leading to many serious secondary complications. These include, in particular, cardiovascular disorders, diabetic neuropathy, nephropathy and retinopathy, diabetic foot, osteoporosis, liver damage, susceptibility to infections and some cancers. Polyphenols such as flavonoids, phenolic acids, stilbenes, tannins, and lignans constitute an extensive and heterogeneous group of phytochemicals in fresh fruits, vegetables and their products. Various in vitro studies, animal model studies and available clinical trials revealed that flavonoids (e.g., quercetin, kaempferol, rutin, epicatechin, genistein, daidzein, anthocyanins), phenolic acids (e.g., chlorogenic, caffeic, ellagic, gallic acids, curcumin), stilbenes (e.g., resveratrol), tannins (e.g., procyanidin B2, seaweed phlorotannins), lignans (e.g., pinoresinol) have the ability to lower hyperglycemia, enhance insulin sensitivity and improve insulin secretion, scavenge reactive oxygen species, reduce chronic inflammation, modulate gut microbiota, and alleviate secondary complications of T2DM. The interaction between polyphenols and conventional antidiabetic drugs offers a promising strategy in the management and treatment of T2DM, especially in advanced disease stages. Synergistic effects of polyphenols with antidiabetic drugs have been documented, but also antagonistic interactions that may impair drug efficacy. Therefore, additional research is required to clarify mutual interactions in order to use the knowledge in clinical applications. Nevertheless, dietary polyphenols can be successfully applied as part of supportive treatment for T2DM, as they reduce both obvious clinical symptoms and secondary complications.",

The effects of the extraction conditions of (poly)phenols from Ribes magellanicum fruits, before and after TT, on their antioxidant and antiglycation effects were assessed. (Poly)phenol-enriched extracts (PEEs) from raw and TT (90 °C, 1 h) Ribes magellanicum were extracted using three solvent mixtures (ethanol/water/acetic acid) with increasing water content (0, 24, and 49%) and three solvent-to-solid ratios (5, 10, and 20 mL/g). PEEs of raw samples showed increased values of total (poly)phenols (TPC), TEAC, and FRAP and decreased IC50 values of fluorescent advanced glycation end products (AGEs) with increasing water content. An increase in TPC and FRAP values was observed for TT samples, but an increase in the IC50 values of fluorescent AGEs for PEEs with increasing water content was observed. Antiglycation activity (IC50 raw/IC50 TT) depended on the solvent-to-solid ratio and the extracting solvent. HPLC-DAD-MS analysis of raw and TT samples showed degradation of anthocyanins, flavonoid fragmentation, and oxidation as the main changes in the phenolic composition of TT samples. We show that TT affects the (poly)phenolic composition of R. magellanicum, producing a decrease in the antiglycation activity when extractions are performed with increasing water content, despite increasing TPC and FRAP activity.",

This study investigates the anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic properties of hesperidin (HE) and a polyphenol mixture from Navelina oranges (OE) in human hepatocytes (Hepa-RG) and hepatic stellate cells (LX-2), in order to elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms. In Hepa-RG cells, HE treatment increased expression of cannabinoid receptor 2 (CB2R), which was associated with down-regulation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases (p38 MAPK) but had minimal impact on cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) levels. Conversely, OE treatment not only enhanced CB2R levels and reduced p38 MAPK, but also promoted a significant reduction in both COX-2 and TGF-β levels, suggesting that OE might be more effective in mitigating inflammatory and fibrotic processes than HE. In LX-2 cells, HE treatment caused a notable decrease in both COX-2 and TGF-β levels, reflecting its efficacy in targeting fibrosis-associated inflammation. OE treatment, on the other hand, reduced Nuclear Factor-Kappa B p65 (NF-κB) expression, a critical transcription factor involved in inflammatory responses, though it did not significantly affect COX-2. LX-2 cells induced to fibrosis with TGF-β and treated with HE and OE showed a reduction in the expression levels of several fibrosis markers. In addition, HE and OE showed antioxidant effects by increasing protein levels of Cu, Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD1), Mn superoxide dismutase (SOD2) and catalase (CAT) and influencing the state of lipid peroxidation. Further research is needed to explore the effects of the treatments in activated hepatic stellate cells and in vivo liver disease models.",

      "abstract": "The effect of polyphenols on the texture and flavor of egg yolk hot gel (EY) was studied. Tea polyphenols (TP), rosmarinic acid (RE), and curcumin (CC) showed significant antioxidant properties during egg yolk processing and could effectively reduce lipid oxidation products (decreased by 68.9%, 76.4%, and 58.61%, respectively) and protein oxidation products (decreased by 47.49%, 37.47%, and 52.51%, respectively) and volatile odor components (styrene, nonanal and 1-octene-3-ol). In addition, these polyphenols enhanced the hot gel properties of the yolk, but did not significantly change the taste of the yolk. This improvement could be attributed to hydrophobic interactions, hydrogen bonds and ionic bonds formed between polyphenols and egg yolk proteins. These interactions produced a more stable structure that was less likely to unfold during heat treatment. As a result, exposure to free sulfhydryl groups, free amino acids and free fatty acids was minimized, thus reducing oxidation reactions."

This approach aims to associate the advantages of hydrogels for topical administration of drugs and of lipid micelles that mimic skin composition for the delivery of poorly water-soluble compounds in combination therapy. Biomimetic micelles composed of L-α-phosphatidylcholine loaded with two distinct polyphenols (one non-flavonoid and one flavonoid) were produced using hot shear homogenisation followed by the ultrasonication method. All developed micelles were dispersed in a carbomer 940-based hydrogel to obtain three distinct semi-solid formulations, which were then characterised by analysing the thermal, rheological and textural properties. Olive pomace-based hydrogels were also produced to contain the same micelles as an alternative to respond to the needs of zero waste and circular economy. The thermograms showed no changes in the typical profiles of micelles when loaded into the hydrogels. The rheological analysis confirmed that the produced hydrogels achieved the ideal properties of a semi-solid product for topical administration. The viscosity values of the hydrogels loaded with olive pomace (hydrogels A) proved to be lower than the hydrogels without olive pomace (hydrogels B), with this ingredient having a considerable effect in reducing the viscosity of the final formulation, yet without compromising the firmness and cohesiveness of the gels. The texture analysis of both hydrogels A and B also exhibited the typical behaviour expected of a semi-solid system."

      "abstract": "ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Toona sinensis fruit polyphenols (TSFP) are polyphenols that have been separated and extracted from mature Toona sinensis fruits. TSFP anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective properties have demonstrated promise. However, the underlying mechanisms require more elucidation. STUDY AIM: The aim of this study is to investigate the mechanisms by which TSFP alleviates cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury (CIRI) through the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and NOD-,LRR- and pyrin domain-containing protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome pathways on middle cerebral artery occlusion/reperfusion (MCAO/R) rats. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The TSFP neuroprotective effect was evaluated using transmission electron microscope (TEM), 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC), neurological function, and hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) staining. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and immunofluorescence were used to measure the TSFP influence on inflammation. In addition, a Western blot assay was performed to assess the NLRP3 inflammasome and MAPK pathway proteins expressions in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and hippocampus, and double immunofluorescence methods were used to identify gasdermin D (GSDMD) secretion in neurons. RESULTS: The TSFP group in the MCAO/R model had improved levels of cerebral infarction and brain pathological damage. The TEM demonstrated that TSFP ameliorated ischemia-induced neuronal pyroptosis, and there was a significant decrease in the expressions of NLRP3, the apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing Caspase recruitment domain (ASC), cysteine aspartate-specific protease-1 (caspase-1), and GSDMD in the TSFP groups. TSFP reduced the phosphorylation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2), promoted the phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 5 (ERK5), and reduced the phosphorylation of c-Jun amino terminal kinase (JNK) in the hippocampus. The results also revealed that TSFP significantly lowered the interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and interleukin-1β (IL-18) expressions and attenuated glial cell activation caused by ischemia in the PFC and hippocampus DG areas. CONCLUSION: This study provided evidence for the efficacy of TSFP in the treatment of CIRI, with potential mechanisms that involved the control of the MAPK signaling pathways and NLRP3 inflammasome/pyroptosis, which highlights the potential benefits of TSFP in the treatment of CIRI.",

Traditionally, the plant is used to treat chronic ailments like diabetes and diverse wounds, including gastric and mouth ulcers, and injuries from tiger bites. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to assess the efficacy of P. fulgens root extract rich in polyphenolics in healing diabetic foot ulcer (DFU) in rats. METHODS: DFU was induced in streptozotocin-nicotinamide diabetic rat feet by open excision wound model. Rats were divided into eight groups (n = 6/group): normal, negative control, plain gel (placebo) control, 1% silver sulfadiazine, and P. fulgens treated with topical ethyl acetate (EAPF, 5% and 10%) and methanol extract (MEPF, 5% and 10%). The morphological, histological and various biochemical parameters associated with the wound healing process such as connective tissue repair and oxidative stress biomarkers were evaluated. RESULTS: Topical application of EAPF 10% and MEPF 10% over 21 days significantly (p < 0.05) reduced ulcer area in DFU rats compared to negative control. Furthermore, the extracts treated group notably (p < 0.05) increased levels of connective tissue biomarkers (total protein, hydroxyproline, hexosamine, and hexuronic acid) and antioxidant components (SOD and GSH), while significantly (p < 0.05) decreasing levels of lipid peroxidation (LPO) in foot tissue homogenate. Histological analysis of rats treated with the extracts revealed significant evidence of tissue repair, characterised by enhanced epithelial and collagen formation, along with decreased polymorphonuclear infiltration and edema. CONCLUSION: In summary, treatment with EAPF 10% significantly improved foot ulcers by modulating oxidative stress and connective tissue biomarkers in DFU animals."

METHODS: The metabolic and genetic effects of three heat stress-regulated mung bean polyphenols on mouse small intestinal epithelial Mode-k cells were investigated by metabolomics-transcriptomics correlation analysis at different heat stress levels. RESULTS: Lipid metabolism, energy metabolism, and nervous system pathways were the key metabolic regulatory pathways. Under the heat stresses of 39 °C, 41 °C, and 43 °C, the key pathways regulated by mung bean polyphenols on intestinal epithelial Mode-k cells were choline metabolism, pyrimidine metabolism, and the retrograde endorphin signalling pathway in cancer, respectively. FoxO, Rap1, and PI3K-Akt signalling pathways were the key environmental regulatory signalling pathways. Mung bean polyphenols can alleviate heat stress-induced cells at 39 °C by inhibiting cell apoptosis and promoting lipid and amino acid accumulation. Mung bean polyphenols can alleviate the threat of cell death caused by heat stress at 41 °C by regulating heat shock proteins, inhibiting mitochondrial function and some nerve disease-related genes. The threat of cell death by heat stress at 43 °C can be alleviated by regulating nerve-related genes. CONCLUSIONS: This study confirmed that mung bean polyphenols can regulate heat stress.

      "abstract": "Though ubiquitous in nature, polyphenols gained scientific prominence only after the pioneering work of researchers like E. Fischer and K. Freudenberg, who demonstrated their potential beyond traditional applications, such as in the leather industry. Today, these bioactive compounds are recognized for their diverse therapeutic roles, including their use as adjuvants in cancer treatment, cancer prevention, and their anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. Additionally, polyphenols have demonstrated benefits in managing obesity, cardiovascular diseases, and neuromodulation. Their synthesis is influenced by environmental and genetic factors, with their concentrations varying based on the intensity of these variables, as well as the stage of ripening. This review provides a comprehensive overview of polyphenols, covering their classification, chemical structures, and bioavailability. The mechanisms influencing bioavailability, bioaccessibility, and bioactivity are explored in detail, alongside an introduction to their bioactive effects and associated metabolic pathways. Specific examples, such as the bioavailability of polyphenols in coffee and various types of onions, are analyzed. Despite their promising biological activities, a significant limitation of polyphenols lies in their inherently low oral bioavailability. However, their systemic circulation and the bioactive by-products formed during digestion present exciting opportunities for further research and application."

      "abstract": "Background: The research is aimed at exploring the potential of marigold petal tea (MPT), rich in polyphenol contents, against oxidative stress and obesity in a rat model following a high-fat-sugar diet (HFSD). Methods: The MPT was prepared through the customary method of decoction and was subjected to analysis for its polyphenol composition using reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC). Two specific doses of MPT, namely, 250 and 500 mg/kg body weight (BW), were chosen for the study-referred to as MPT-250 and MPT-500, respectively. Result: The main phenolic acids and flavonoids identified in MPT, with concentrations exceeding 10 mg/100 mL of tea, included catechin, rutin, salicylic acid, gallic acid, sinapic acid, chlorogenic acid, cinnamic acid, and ellagic acid. The total phenolic (TP) and total flavonoid (TF) contents in MPT were measured to be 5.53 and 7.73 mg/g, respectively. Additionally, MPT demonstrated a 57.2% scavenging capacity with 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl radical. Notably, the administration of a higher dose (MPT-500) showed a significant reduction in body mass index (BMI) and a 51.24% reduction in the rate of increase in BW compared to the HFSD group. The findings indicated that all the treatment groups, that is, orlistat treatment (OT), MPT-250, and MPT-500 groups, experienced reduced levels of serum total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), and markers of lipoproteins in contrast to the HFSD group. Moreover, MPT helped restore the levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and reduced glutathione (GSH), thereby demonstrating its potential in combating oxidative stress. The MPT-500 group also displayed decreased liver and kidney weights and an improved atherogenic index when compared to the HFSD group. Conclusion: The results clearly indicate that a high dosage of MPT showed antiobesity activity which was comparable to the same effects produced by the conventional drug orlistat.",

      "abstract": "Marine microalgae are emerging as promising sources of polyphenols, renowned for their health-promoting benefits. Recovering polyphenols from microalgae requires suitable treatment and extraction techniques to ensure their release from the biomass and analytical methodologies to assess their efficiency. This review provides a comprehensive comparison of traditional and cutting-edge extraction and analytical procedures applied for polyphenolic characterization in marine microalgae over the past 26 years, with a unique perspective on optimizing their recovery and identification. It addresses (I) cell disruption techniques, including bead milling, high-speed homogenization, pulsed electric field, ultrasonication, microwave, freeze-thawing, and enzymatic/chemical hydrolysis; (II) extraction techniques, such as solid-liquid extraction, ultrasound and microwave-assisted extraction, pressurized-liquid extraction, and supercritical CO2; (III) analytical methods, including total phenolic and flavonoid content assays and advanced chromatographic techniques like GC-MS, HPLC-DAD, and HPLC-MS. Key findings showed bead milling and chemical hydrolysis as effective cell disruption techniques, pressurized-liquid extraction and microwave-assisted extraction as promising efficient extraction methods, and HPLC-MS as the finest alternative for precise phenolic characterization. Unlike previous reviews, this study uniquely integrates both extractive and analytical approaches in one work, focusing exclusively on marine microalgae, a relatively underexplored area compared to freshwater species, offering actionable insights to guide future research and industrial applications.",

Here, we aimed to explore combination of proteasome inhibitor; bortezomib (BTZ) with natural antioxidants (AOs); polyphenols like caffeic acid (CFA), resveratrol (RES), fucoidan (FD), and synthetic AO; sodium selenite (Na2SeO3) for cellular cytotoxicity in breast cancer cell lines; MCF-7 and MDA MB-231. The combination of RES + BTZ, FD + BTZ, and Na2SeO3 + BTZ showed synergism while CFA showed antagonism with BTZ. The EC50 values of different combinations were found to be significantly less than the individual AOs in ABTS and DPPH assay. Furthermore, the effect of combination of drugs on migratory properties of MCF-7 cells were evaluated by in-vitro wound healing assay, resulting in the reduction of such behavior. In support of this, RT-qPCR was performed to analyze differential gene expressions of apoptotic and Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT) markers with and without treatment. In results, the combination of Na2SeO3 + BTZ reduced the expression of Bcl-XL and N-Cad causing cytotoxicity and suggested that the combination of Na2SeO3 + BTZ (IC50 = 1.40 ± 0.45 μM) could be a better option among other combinations for breast cancer therapy. Overall, the outcome indicates that the combination of BTZ with AOs may yield potential therapeutic benefit.",

      "abstract": "Breast cancer poses a substantial health challenge for women globally. Recently, there has been a notable increase in scholarly attention regarding polyphenols, primarily attributed to not only the adverse effects associated with conventional treatments but also their immune-preventive impacts. Polyphenols, nature-derived substances present in vegetation, including fruits and vegetables, have received considerable attention in various fields of science due to their probable wellness merits, particularly in the treatment and hindrance of cancer. This review focuses on the immunomodulatory effects of polyphenols in breast cancer, emphasizing their capacity to influence the reaction of adaptive and innate immune cells within the tumor-associated environment. Polyphenols are implicated in the modulation of inflammation, the enhancement of antioxidant defenses, the promotion of epigenetic modifications, and the support of immune functions. Additionally, these compounds have been shown to influence the activity of critical immune cells, including macrophages and T cells. By targeting pathways involved in immune evasion, polyphenols may augment the capacity of the defensive system to detect and eliminate tumors. The findings suggest that incorporating polyphenol-rich foods into the diet could offer a promising, collaborative (integrative) approach to classical breast cancer remedial procedures by regulating how the defense mechanism interacts with the disease.",

      "abstract": "Acute leukemia is a prevalent cancer worldwide and is classified into two distinct forms. Currently, various therapies have been developed for this disease; however, the issues of recurrence, resistance to treatment, and adverse effects require the exploration of novel treatments. Polyphenols, classified into four categories, are secondary metabolites originating from plants that demonstrate diverse metabolic features such as anticancer, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant activities. Consequently, they have attracted attention for therapeutic and preventive measures. Research indicates that dietary polyphenols can mitigate the disease burden of acute leukemias by influencing the molecular pathways associated with the disease and its inflammatory processes. Furthermore, owing to their antioxidant properties, they can reduce the amounts of reactive oxygen species generated from the disrupted molecular pathways in these malignancies. The therapeutic actions of polyphenols can facilitate disease recovery by interrupting the cell cycle and causing apoptosis by activating pro-apoptotic genes. In conclusion, the intake of dietary polyphenols, due to their convenience and availability, coupled with the positive outcomes associated with their use in conjunction with conventional therapies, may function as an efficient therapeutic and preventive measure for acute leukemia.",

      "abstract": "The incorporation of polyphenols into food systems provides various health benefits, yet their stability and bioactivity are often compromised by processing conditions. In this study, we advanced the pH-driven method for processing highly pH-sensitive polyphenols, such as quercetin, by optimizing operating conditions, including minimizing oxygen exposure and reducing operating times. As a result, an improved post-pH-driven (PPD) method was developed to encapsulate pH-sensitive quercetin into nanoemulsions with an encapsulation efficiency exceeding 95%, indicating that this method could be broadly applicable for incorporating various polyphenols. For example, it has been successfully applied to upcycle plant polyphenols from peanut skin into nanoemulsions, serving as a representative food model. The PPD method demonstrated superior performance compared to a conventional water-based method, achieving 1.8 times higher remaining percentage of total polyphenolic content. Additionally, the PPD-based nanoemulsions exhibited significantly enhanced antioxidant properties, with DPPH and ABTS radical scavenging activities increasing by 3.7 and 2.8 times, respectively, compared to the water-based method. These findings underscore the potential of the PPD method as a versatile and efficient approach for developing polyphenol-powered foods by upcycling plant byproducts and improving processing efficiency."

      "abstract": "Diarrheal irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-D) is a chronic bowel condition that leads to intestinal dysfunction and is typically accompanied by diarrhea, stomach pain, and abdominal distension. Ribes nigrum L. polyphenols (RNPs), which are natural plant polyphenols, are the subject of this study, which aims to assess their potential in improving IBS-D and to explore the underlying mechanisms through a network pharmacology analysis and 16S rRNA sequencing. Next, mice models of diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel were established, and the mice with IBS-D were treated with RNPs. The effect of RNPs was then evaluated in terms of body weight, abdominal withdrawal reflex (AWR), Bristol score, fecal water percentage, diluted fecal volume, total intestinal transit time, immune index, histopathological observation, and changes in inflammatory factors. Finally, 16S rRNA sequencing and reverse q-RTPCR were utilized to evaluate the components that mediate the impact of RNPs on IBS-D. It was found that when RNP treatment was administered to mice with IBS-D, they decreased the water content in their stools, raised their immunological scores, and decreased the amount of inflammatory substances in their bodies. Moreover, through 16S rRNA sequencing, it was shown that the RNP treatment increased the relative abundances of Bacteroides, Alloprevotella, and Alistipes, which led to the remodeling of gut microbiota. In summary, RNPs significantly improved the conditions of mice with IBS-D by inhibiting the FoxO pathway and enhancing gut microbiota. This study concludes that RNPs could significantly improve the symptoms of mice with IBS-D through these means."

The results showed that the influence of different HPP treatment conditions on copigmentation was not significant. HPP treatment did not significantly affect the λmax, peak absorption, color parameters, and Mv-3-O-gal anthocyanin content when applied alone or in combination with CA and Epi. However, the color intensity and a* value of Mv-3-O-gal with GA decreased by 3.2% (p < 0.05). The absorption peak, color, and content of Mv-3-O-ara were not affected by HPP alone or during copigmentation with CA, Epi, and GA. In addition, CA had the best effect on the co-coloring of Mv-3-O-gal, while GA was more successful in affecting Mv-3-O-ara during the storage period. Molecular dynamics simulations indicated that the aromatic ring of CA was closest to the A-C plane of Mv-3-O-gal (3.70 Å), resulting in a closer π-π stacking distance and higher bond energy. The favorable impact of GA on Mv-3-O-ara was because the A-C plane aromatic ring of Mv-3-O-ara and the aromatic D ring of GA formed \"sandwich\" stacking. The results indicated that combining HPP with polyphenols improved color and could be used to process raw materials containing malvidin, such as blueberries."

The development of natural food sources and multi-targeted drugs for the treatment of UC is imminent. Portulaca oleracea L. (PO), as a vegetable, has been shown in studies to have an anti-UC effects. However, the relationship between the abundant active ingredients contained in Portulaca oleracea L. and the improvement of intestinal barrier, gut microbiota and metabolites is unclear. In the present study, Portulaca oleracea L. which was found to be rich in phenolic acid-based active ingredients, were effective in alleviating dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced body weight loss, disease activity index (DAI) score and colon length in mice. It also decreased C-reactive protein (CRP) and myeloperoxidase (MPO) responses, reduced the permeation of fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-dextran, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and evans blue (EB), and improved histopathological scores. Meanwhile, in vitro and in vivo validation revealed the protective effects of purslane on the intestinal barrier indicators ZO-1, Occludin and Claudin-1, and inhibited the expression of inflammation-associated iNOS and NLRP3 proteins through the NF-κB signaling pathway. In addition, purslane increased the diversity of the intestinal flora, enhancing the proportion of the genera Butyricoccus, Dorea and Bifidobacterium and decreasing the percentage of Bacteroides, Turicibacter and Parabacteroides. Serum metabolomics analysis showed that the imbalance of 39 metabolites was significantly reversed after PO deployment. Enrichment analysis showed that Pentose phosphate pathway and Pyruvate metabolism pathway were the key pathways of PO against UC. Overall, purslane effectively improved the intestinal barrier disruption and intestinal inflammation by inhibiting the NF-κB signaling pathway, and adjusted the disorder of gut microbiota and metabolites to exert anti-UC effects.",

The study used whole mackerel fish and analyzed the sensory characteristics, physicochemical properties, and microstructure of the puree. As storage time increased, significant changes occurred in the puree, including increased levels of thiobarbituric acid value, protein carbonyl, and free radicals. The water holding capacity, whiteness, and pH value of the puree decreased. However, the addition of TP helped to preserve the quality of the mackerel puree, particularly in the later stages of storage. This was evidenced by reduced oxidation of lipids and proteins, minimal color change, and a more compact microstructure. The study also revealed that TP contributes to the development of a gel network within the mackerel puree, enhancing water retention and sensory qualities. These findings suggested that TP treatment has potential for preserving mackerel puree during refrigeration."

      "abstract": "Di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) is a commonly used plasticizer known for its toxic effects on the male reproductive system. Green tea polyphenols (GTPs), recognized for their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, have demonstrated protective effects on various organs, but the mechanisms by which GTPs mitigate DEHP-induced testicular damage remain unclear. Healthy male C57BL/6J mice were divided into five groups: control, DEHP, DEHP + GTP treatment, GTP, and oil groups. Testicular histopathological changes were assessed using hematoxylin-eosin (H&E), periodic acid-Schiff (PAS), and Masson staining. Ultrastructural alterations were examined through transmission electron microscopy. High-throughput sequencing was performed to analyze the expression of mRNA, miRNA, and lncRNA and construct an lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA regulatory network for identifying key regulatory axes. Mice in the DEHP group exhibited significant testicular damage, including reduced sperm count, mitochondrial deformation, and endoplasmic reticulum dilation. GTP treatment notably improved testicular structural integrity, restored sperm count, and alleviated mitochondrial and endoplasmic reticulum damage. Additionally, DEHP significantly increased activated CD8+ T cells, which were reduced with GTP treatment. High-throughput sequencing revealed that GTP treatment exerted protective effects through the regulation of six key lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA axes. GTPs significantly protect against DEHP-induced testicular damage, and the lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA regulatory axes play a potential role in this process.",

      "abstract": "Polyphenols are the main group of phytochemicals with several biological activities. Due to the adverse effects of conventional solvent extraction methods, innovative extraction techniques have been used as alternatives to overcome these problems. High voltage electric discharge (HVED) is an eco-friendly innovative extraction technique based on the phenomenon of electrical breakdown in water. This technique induces physical and chemical processes, leading to product fragmentation, cellular damage, and liberation of bioactive compounds. HVED treatment can extract polyphenols at lower temperatures and shorter times than the conventional solvent extraction methods. This review summarizes the effect of HVED processing parameters on the recovery and stability of polyphenols from plant sources. Hydroethanolic solutions improve the HVED-assisted extraction of polyphenols compared to water. Moreover, acidic solvents are suitable for the high recovery and protection of polyphenols during electric discharges. This study revealed the efficacy of the HVED technique in extracting polyphenols for their utilization in the food and pharmaceutical industries."

The necessity for alternative therapeutic approaches is underscored by the fact that although present medicines are successful, they frequently result in considerable adverse effects. Naturally occurring substances included in fruits and vegetables called polyphenols have been shown to have the capacity to control important inflammatory pathways including NF-κB and JAK/STAT, which are essential for the pathophysiology of IBD. The processes by which polyphenols, such as curcumin, EGCG, resveratrol, and quercetin, reduce inflammation are examined in this article. Polyphenols may have therapeutic advantages by blocking the synthesis of cytokines and the activation of immune cells by targeting these pathways. Preclinical study indicates a reduction in intestinal inflammation, which is encouraging. However, more clinical research is needed to determine the clinical relevance of polyphenols in the therapy of IBD, especially with regard to their long-term safety and bioavailability.",

Five diets were formulated to contain various levels of FPPP: FP0 (no FPPP), FPPP inclusion at 0.015% (FP1), 0.030% (FP2), 0.060% (FP3), and 0.120% (FP4). The results indicated there were no significant variations in weight gain rate (WGR), specific growth rate (SGR), and feed conversion rate (FCR) of shrimp in all treatment groups (p > 0.05), but the survival (SR) of shrimp was significantly higher in all groups with the addition of FPPP (p < 0.05). Compared with FP0 group, the contents of total protein (TP) and globulin (GLB) in serum biochemical indexes of FP3 and FP4 groups were significantly increased, and the content of blood urea nitrogen (BUN) was significantly decreased (p < 0.05). Compared with FP0 group, the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), alkaline phosphatase (AKP), acid phosphatase (ACP), and lysozyme (LZM) in the hepatopancreas and serum of FP3 and FP4 groups were significantly increased (p < 0.05). Similarly, the activities of glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC), and phenoloxidase (PO) in the hepatopancreas and serum of FP2 group were significantly higher than those of FP0 group (p < 0.05). In addition, the content of malondialdehyde (MDA) in the hepatopancreas and serum of shrimp in FPPP-added groups was decreased (p < 0.05). Compared with FP0 group, the expression levels of SOD, CAT, glutathione S-transferase (GST), LZM, prophenoloxidase (ProPO), penaeidin-3 (Pen3), Crustin, immune deficiency (Imd), Toll, and Relish genes were significantly upregulated in the hepatopancreas of shrimp in FP3 and FP4 groups (p < 0.05). Additionally, increasing the addition level of FPPP resulted in a more compact hepatosomal arrangement of the shrimp's hepatopancreas, a more visible star-shaped lumen structure, and a significantly higher number of B cells. Finally, the cumulative SR of shrimp in FPPP groups was significantly higher than that in FP0 group after 7 days of infection with Vibrio alginolyticus (p < 0.05). In summary, dietary supplementation of FPPP can improve SR, immunity, and hepatopancreatic health and resistance to Vibrio alginolyticus of L. vannamei."

      "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD), a progressiveneurodegenerative condition is marked by extensive damage in the brain and dementia. Among the pathological hallmarks of AD is beta-amyloid (Aβ). Production of toxic Aβ oligomers production and accumulation in the brain is among the characteristic features of the disease. The abnormal accumulation Aβ is initiated by the catalytic degradation of Amyloid Precursor Proteins (APP) by Beta Amyloid Cleaving Enzyme 1 (BACE1) to generate insoluble amyloid plaques. The abnormal proteins are mitochondrial poison which disrupt the energy production and liberate excessive free radicals causing neuronal damage and mutations. Consequently, targeting Aβ-associated pathways has become a focus in the pursuit of developing effective AD treatments. An obstacle faced by many medications used to treat neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) is the restricted permeability across the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Unfortunately, no anti-amyloid drug is clinically approved till now. Recent advancements in nanotechnology have provided a possible solution for delivering medications to specific targets. By integrating natural products with nano-medicinal approaches, it is possible to develop novel and highly efficient therapeutic strategies for the treatment of AD.",

      "abstract": "In this study, we describe the effect of cocoa polyphenol extract (CPE, from flavanols-rich cocoa) on myogenic differentiation in murine myoblasts (C2C12 cells) exposed to H2O2. The myogenic program was monitored using morphological, ultrastructural, and molecular approaches. Treatment with 100 μM of H2O2 for 1 h decreased cell viability. C2C12 (D1) exposed to H2O2 shows more apoptotic and necrotic cells, and mitochondria appear emptied, with cristae heavily damaged. To evaluate the effect of CPE on myoblast viability and myotube formation, 10 μg/mL of CPE were added 24 h prior to H2O2 treatment and cells were supplemented with fresh CPE every 24 h during differentiation. Supplementation with CPE protected C2C12 myoblasts from H2O2-induced oxidative damage both at early (D1) and late (D6) phases of differentiation, preventing cell death and mitochondrial damage. The number of mitochondria (per area of cell surface) increased 2-fold in both control and in CPE-supplemented and mitochondria in myotubes D6 showed a greater extension of mitochondrial cristae than mitochondria in D1. At D1 and D6 the monolayers showed surface and inner cell features relatively comparable to the untreated control suggesting that CPE supplementation significantly mitigated the effect of H2O2. Preliminary data obtained by the myogenic index (Giemsa staining) suggested that CPE-supplemented cells were partially protected from H2O2-induced myogenesis inhibition. The CPE supplementation seems to preserve the mitochondrial integrity and the myogenic differentiation ability of oxidatively injured C2C12 ensuing further nutraceutical perspectives.",

The antibacterial effect and mechanism of fermented pomegranate peel polyphenols (FPPPs) on V. alginolyticus were investigated. The results indicated that FPPPs had a strong inhibitory effect on the growth of V. alginolyticus, and their minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) were 2 and 4 mg/mL. FPPPs significantly reduced biofilm formation and biofilm metabolic activity in V. alginolyticus, down-regulated the expression levels of lafA, lafK, fliS and flaK genes involved in flagellar synthesis and inhibited swimming and swarming motility (p < 0.05). Meanwhile, under the treatment of FPPPs, the activities of catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) in V. alginolyticus were significantly reduced, and the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and extracellular malondialdehyde (MDA) were significantly increased (p < 0.05). FPPPs also resulted in a significant increase in alkaline phosphatase (AKP) activity, protein and nucleic acid content, as well as conductivity from V. alginolyticus cultures. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images further revealed that V. alginolyticus treated with FPPPs showed leakage of intracellular substances, abnormal cell morphology and damage to cell walls and cell membranes, with the severity of the damage in a clear dose-dependent manner. Therefore, FPPPs can be used as a promising food-grade antibacterial agent, notably in seafood to control V. alginolyticus."

Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy examination confirmed the preservation of the triple helical structure of collagen. A scanning electron microscopy study showed that both materials had a porous structure. The incorporation of DfTf into the freeze-dried collagen matrix increased the aggregation of collagen fibers to a higher extent than the incorporation of TfG5, resulting in a more compact structure of the material containing DfTf. It was found that NIH/3T3 mouse fibroblasts were attached to, and relatively evenly spread out on, the surface of both newly obtained membranes. In addition, it was shown that the membranes enhanced skin wound healing in rats with a chemical burn induced by acetic acid. The treatment with the materials led to a faster reepithelization and granulation tissue formation compared with the use of other agents (collagen without polyphenols and buffer saline). It was also found that, in the wound tissue, the level of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) was significantly higher and the level of low-molecular-weight SH-containing compounds (RSH) was significantly lower than those in healthy skin, indicating a rise in oxidative stress at the site of injury. The treatment with collagen membranes containing polyphenols significantly decreased the TBARS level and increased the RSH level, suggesting the antioxidant/anti-inflammatory effect of the materials. The membrane containing TfG5 was more effective than other ones (the collagen membrane containing DfTf and collagen without polyphenols). On the whole, the data obtained indicate that collagen materials containing DfTf and TfG5 have potential as powerful therapeutic agents for the treatment of burn wounds.",

      "abstract": "Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a complex and often debilitating condition that significantly impacts the gastrointestinal system and the overall quality of life of those affected. IBS is characterized by a variety of distressing symptoms, including cramping, abdominal pain, and irregular bowel movements, underlined by an intricate interplay of immune system dysfunction in its pathology. Numerous studies highlight an increased cellular immune response, with elevated levels of proinflammatory cytokines, mucosal alterations due to immune imbalance, and visceral hypersensitivity. Notably, studies indicate increased levels of proinflammatory cytokines, immune imbalances that lead to mucosal changes, and heightened visceral sensitivity. The roles of effector and regulatory T cells are particularly intriguing, as their modification appears to amplify inflammation and may even contribute to autoimmune disorders. This overview of systematic reviews explores the connections between IBS and immune responses, with a focus on immune cell alterations and proliferation of lymphocytes and mast cells in affected individuals. Furthermore, we explore various aspects of IBS management, including its pharmacological approaches. A systematic search of PubMed and Web of Science yielded 676 articles, which were ultimately narrowed down to 9 key studies that met our inclusion criteria. These studies collectively underscore the activation of the immune system with the degranulation of the mast cells in patients with IBS, where the release of inflammatory mediators can compromise intestinal permeability, exacerbating symptoms further. Additionally, we examine the multifaceted management strategies for IBS, emphasizing the potential therapeutic benefits of dietary polyphenols as antioxidants. The present study aims to enhance our understanding of IBS and offer insights into more effective treatment strategies for this challenging condition.",

      "abstract": "Polyvinylpolypyrrolidone (PVPP) is commonly employed for fining in fruit wine brewing. This study aimed to investigate the impact of PVPP pretreatment on the formation of fermentation aroma and polyphenol distribution in Rosa roxburghii Tratt (RRT) wine. A significant effect of PVPP on polyphenol adsorption was observed, and polyphenol families or subfamilies such as flavanols and flavonols showed specific affinity for PVPP, decreasing by over 19 % and 30 %, respectively. Furthermore, it was the first time to demonstrate a significant enhancement in the ester content of the corresponding RRT wine after PVPP treatment, particularly in imparting sweet and fruity esters (increased by over 40 %). In contrast, the RRT wine treated with PVPP exhibited a significant reduction of over 20 % in the concentration of higher alcohols, particularly reflected in the green and chemical aromas. This indicates that PVPP treatment could promote the transformation of RRT wine aroma from green and chemical to sweet and fruity. Correlation analysis revealed a positive relationship between the concentration of higher alcohols and most phenolic compounds in RRT wine, while quercetin 3-glucoside, rutin, and polydatin were negatively correlated with esters that can impart fruit flavor and floral aroma to fruit wine. As a practical insight into fruit wine fermentation, PVPP fining before fermentation is more likely to alter the phenolic compositions of RRT wine, thereby influencing its aroma characteristics. Specifically, polyphenols associated with energy metabolism of yeast could have stimulated the formed fluxes of esters. The association between the formation of esters and higher alcohols with phenolic compounds will provide new information on the impact of clarification treatments on yeast-derived volatile metabolites in RRT wine and hold promise in improving the aroma of RRT wine by modulating polyphenol composition through pre-clarification.",

      "abstract": "The seeds of Theobroma cacao L. are rich in antioxidant flavonoids such as flavan-3-ols, which are valued for their health benefits. In this context, it is of interest to improve flavanol content in cocoa extracts. The present study aimed at improving the clarification process of an aqueous cocoa extract using protein precipitation and filtration. Five pH modifications and two bentonite amounts were tested for their effects on protein precipitation and flavanol content. Micro- and ultrafiltration as a subsequent step was done by testing three different ceramic membranes (30, 80, and 200 nm). Lower pH in pre-treatment reduced protein content and kept flavanols constant, while at higher pH, flavanols were reduced up to 40%. Larger membrane pores enhanced polyphenol permeation, while smaller pores limited protein permeation. Adjusting pH to the isoelectric point increased protein adsorption, improving filtration quality despite decreased permeate flux. However, membrane fouling results in higher permeate quality due to increased selectivity. Furthermore, the addition of bentonite during filtration reduced both protein and flavanol content in the permeate, similar to the effects seen in the pre-treatment of the supernatant. Optimizing pH and membrane pore size enhances the recovery and quality of polyphenols during filtration, balancing protein removal and flavanol retention."

      "abstract": "Osteoporosis induces severe oxidative stress and disrupts bone metabolism, complicating the treatment of bone defects. Current therapies often have side effects and require lengthy bone regeneration periods. Hydrogels, known for their flexible mechanical properties and degradability, are promising carriers for drugs and bioactive factors in bone tissue engineering. However, they lack the ability to regulate the local pathological environment of osteoporosis and expedite bone repair. Polyphenols, with antioxidative, anti-inflammatory, and bone metabolism-regulating properties, have emerged as a solution. Combining hydrogels and polyphenols, polyphenol-based hydrogels can regulate local bone metabolism and oxidative stress while providing mechanical support and tissue adhesion, promoting osteoporotic bone regeneration. This review first provides a brief overview of the types of polyphenols and the mechanisms of polyphenols in facilitating adhesion, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and bone metabolism modulation in modulating the pathological environment of osteoporosis. Next, this review examines recent advances in hydrogels for the treatment of osteoporotic bone defects, including their use in angiogenesis, oxidative stress modulation, drug delivery, and stem cell therapy. Finally, it highlights the latest research on polyphenol hydrogels in osteoporotic bone defect regeneration. Overall, this review aims to facilitate the clinical application of polyphenol hydrogels for the treatment of osteoporotic bone defects.",

      "abstract": "Hyperlipidemia, hepatic steatosis, and hyperglycemia are prevalent metabolic disorders closely linked to obesity. The objective of this research was to examine the potential advantageous impacts of polyphenols extracted from Prunus salicina L. fruit (PSFP) on hyperlipidemia, hepatic steatosis, and hyperglycemia induced by a high-fat diet (HFD), as well as to elucidate the underlying mechanisms involved. Male C57BL/6J mice, free from specific pathogens, were assigned randomly into three groups. These groups were then subjected to a 14-week dietary intervention, including a low-fat diet, an HFD, or an HFD plus with PSFP via intragastric administration. The obesity-related biochemical indexes were evaluated. To assess alterations in gut microbiota resulting from PSFP treatment, 16S rRNA sequencing was performed. UPLC-ESI-MS/MS assay identified 162 distinct polyphenolic compounds in PSFP. The administration of PSFP significantly reduced both body weight gain and hyperlipidemia induced by HFD. In addition, PSFP ameliorated hepatic steatosis induced by HFD and enhanced liver function in mice. PSFP treatment also ameliorated HFD-induced insulin resistance and hyperglycemia, evidenced by the observed decrease in fasting serum concentrations of glucose and insulin, improved insulin sensitivity, and restored glucose tolerance. Moreover, PSFP modulated the composition and abundance of specific microbial genus, including Lachnospiraceae NK4A136 group, Akkermansia, Parabacteroides, Enterococcus, Adlercreutzia, and Roseburia. Correlation analysis indicated significant associations between gut microbiota and physiological indices associated with obesity. These findings suggested that PSFP supplementation ameliorated HFD-induced hyperlipidemia, hepatic steatosis, and hyperglycemia, potentially through modulating the gut microbiota composition and abundance of specific taxa.",

      "abstract": "Hemorrhagic Cystitis (HC) presents a significant therapeutic challenge due to the dynamic fluid environment and cyclical mechanical stress within the bladder. Tissue-adhesive hydrogels have shown promise in treating HC; however, maintaining strong adhesion and mechanical integrity under these fluctuating conditions remains a critical obstacle. Herein, we designed a robust bladder-adhesive hydrogel by leveraging the affinity of tea polyphenols (TP) for damaged tissues and their ability to rapidly enhance the stability of photo-crosslinked silk fibroin methylacryloyl (SFMA) through abundant hydrogen bonding. The resulting SFMA/TP hydrogel could withstand high compressive and tensile loads while maintaining efficient under-urine adhesion, achieving up to 15.1 kPa to adapt to the dynamic mechanical environment of the bladder. Furthermore, urea dissociation disrupted hydrogen bonding, enabling the SFMA/TP hydrogels to exhibit urea-responsiveness and effective biodegradation both in vitro and in vivo within the bladder. In a rat model of cyclophosphamide-induced HC, this under-urine hydrogel adhesive demonstrated superior hemostatic effects and promoted healing by modulating inflammation, enhancing neovascularization, and facilitating smooth muscle formation. Overall, this bladder-adaptive hydrogel adhesive represents a minimally invasive therapeutic option for HC by offering targeted and sustained treatment within the bladder environment.",

(OP) are medicinal plants used in Djibouti. They were evaluated to determine their total phenolic content (TPC), flavonoid content (TFC), and phytochemical profile using HPLC-MS/MS. Additionally, their antioxidant capacity was assessed through five various methods. Enzymatic activities were also measured, focusing on acetylcholinesterase (AChE), butyrylcholinesterase (BChE), α-amylase, α-glucosidase, and tyrosinase. OP extract had the highest TPC and exhibited the best antioxidant capacity, whereas OB and BC extracts had the highest TFC. Twenty-seven compounds were identified and quantified by LCMS. GE extract demonstrated the highest AChE activity, whereas OP extract had the highest BChE activity. BC was most active against α-amylase and α-glucosidase, and only GE and OP extracts showed tyrosinase inhibition in vitro. In silico analysis, the compounds were optimized and docked to the human tyrosinase-related protein 1 using AutoDock Vina, with absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination to evaluate their suitability based on key therapeutic criteria. Chlorogenic, neochlorogenic, gallic acids, and quercetin emerged as promising tyrosinase inhibitors. These plants can be a viable source in the prevention and treatment related to tyrosinase enzyme inhibition.",

      "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD), a prevalent neurodegenerative disorder, predominantly affects individuals over the age of 65 and poses significant challenges in terms of effective management and treatment. The disease's pathogenesis involves complex molecular pathways including misfolded proteins accumulation, neuroinflammation, and synaptic dysfunction. Recent insights have highlighted the role of microRNAs (miRNAs) as critical regulators within these pathways, where they influence gene expression and contribute to the pathophysiological landscape of AD. Notably, emerging research has demonstrated that polyphenols, including curcumin, might modulate miRNA activity, thus offering a novel approach to mitigate AD symptoms and progression. This review explores the potential mechanisms through which polyphenols regulate miRNA expression and activity, specifically focusing on autophagy enhancement and inflammation reduction in the context of AD. We provide a detailed examination of key studies linking miRNA dysregulation to AD pathogenesis and discuss how polyphenols might correct these aberrations. The findings presented here underscore the therapeutic potential of polyphenols in AD treatment via miRNA modulation, pointing to new directions in disease management strategies and highlighting the need for targeted research into miRNA-based interventions.",
