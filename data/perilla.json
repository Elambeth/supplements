      "abstract": "Gout, a prevalent arthritic disease, can be mitigated by adenosine deaminase (ADA) inhibitors that reduce uric acid production. In this study, the extraction process of rosmarinic acid (RA) from Perilla frutescens L. (P. frutescens) was optimized, and the best yield was 2.22 mg/g. Quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) model was used to predict ADA inhibitors (ADAIs) in potential foods. The random forest model constructed by ChemoPy descriptor was the best (AUC = 0.9648), and five candidate compounds (including RA) were screened. The inhibitory activity of RA on ADA was confirmed in vitro (IC50 = 55.11 μM). Molecular docking showed that ADAIs and ADA were stably bound through hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interaction. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation verified the dynamic stability of ADAIs and ADA complexes. This study provides a theoretical basis for RA from P. frutescens extract as a potential compound for the treatment of gout and for the rapid screening of foodborne ADAIs."

      "abstract": "Psoriasis, a chronic inflammatory skin disorder, remains challenging to treat due to poor skin barrier penetration, limited efficacy, and adverse effects of current therapies. Natural plant-derived extracellular vesicle-like particles (EVPs) have emerged as biocompatible carriers for bioactive molecules. Among various medicinal plants screened, Perilla frutescens leaf-derived EVPs (PLEVPs) exhibited strong anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects. By incorporating PLEVPs into a hydrogel formulation, we enhanced their stability, retention at psoriatic lesions, and transdermal delivery efficiency. In vivo studies demonstrated that the PLEVPs markedly alleviated psoriasis symptoms in both preventive and therapeutic mouse models, outperforming conventional treatments. This effect was attributed to reduced oxidative stress, modulation of Treg cells, and promotion of keratinocyte apoptosis. Transcriptomic analysis revealed enrichment of the interleukin-17 (IL-17) signaling pathway, a major driver of psoriasis, while small RNA sequencing identified pab-miR396a-5p, an endogenous microRNA (miRNA) within PLEVPs, as a key regulator. Mechanistic studies showed that pab-miR396a-5p targets the 3'-untranslated region of plant heat shock protein 83a, a homolog of mammalian heat shock protein 90, leading to the suppression of nuclear factor-kappa B and Janus kinase/signal transducers and activators of transcription signaling, inhibiting the IL-17 signaling pathway. Validation using lipid nanoparticles encapsulating pab-miR396a-5p mimics confirmed comparable therapeutic effects. This study highlights the potential of plant-derived EVPs as carriers of endogenous miRNAs, enabling interkingdom communication and offering a scalable platform for psoriasis therapy."

      "abstract": "Nanoplastics, infiltrating soil ecosystems through diverse pathways such as agricultural practices, sludge application, and atmospheric deposition, present significant potential risks to global ecological systems. Through adsorption, iron oxide nanoparticles (IONPs) could reduce toxicity and bioavailability of nanoplastics in polluted soil ecosystems. However, little is known about how interactions between IONPs and polystyrene nanoplastics (PSNPs) affect plant growth. This study revealed that iron oxide nanoparticles (IONPs) effectively mitigated the uptake of polystyrene nanoplastics (PSNPs) in Perilla frutescens, demonstrating a substantial reduction of PSNPs accumulation by 46.15% in roots and 24.83% in stems. Furthermore, IONPs application significantly improved plant growth parameters, with notable increases of 20.40% in plant height and 34.22% in biomass compared to plants exposed solely to PSNPs.Compared with PSNPs alone, application of PSNPs + IONPs enhanced plant photosynthetic parameters, reduced the quantity of osmotic substances and reduced the activity of antioxidant enzymes. KEGG analysis was concentrated on photosynthetic metabolism and flavonoid synthesis. Further analysis combined with metabolic pathways revealed that IONPs treatment improved plant growth by up-regulating photosystem genes (PsbP, Psak, and PetC) and flavonoid synthesis genes (CHS, CHI, and F3H). Overall, IONPs enhance Perilla frutescens growth by upregulating photosystem-related genes and mitigate PSNPs-induced oxidative stress through flavonoid biosynthesis pathway activation. The present study provides new insights that will aid development of nano iron fertilizers capable of improving the adverse effects of nano plastics on agricultural production."

      "abstract": "The mechanism of L-perilla alcohol(L-POH) in intervening hypoxic pulmonary hypertension(HPAH) was discussed based on network pharmacology, and experimental verification. The active components and potential targets of the volatile oil of Rhodiola tangutica(VORA) in the intervention of HPAH were screened by network pharmacology. The biological process of Gene Ontology(GO) and the signaling pathway enrichment of Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes(KEGG) were analyzed for the core targets, and a &quot;component-common target-disease&quot; network was constructed. Four active components were screened from VORA: L-POH, linalool, geraniol, and(-)-myrtenol. The core targets for treating HPAH were HSP90AA1, AKT1, ESR1, PIK3CA, EP300, EGFR, and JAK2. GO enrichment analysis mainly involved biological processes such as reaction to hypoxia, heme binding, and steroid binding. KEGG enrichment analysis mainly involved hypoxia-inducing factor 1(HIF-1) signaling pathway, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/protein kinase B(PI3K/AKT) signaling pathway, and Janus kinase/activator of signal transduction and transcription(JAK/STAT) signaling pathway. The vasodilation effects of the four active components were screened by perfusion experiment of extracorporeal vascular rings, and the mechanism of the main active component L-POH was studied by channel blockers. The inhibitory effects of the four active components on the proliferation of pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells(PASMCs) induced by hypoxia were screened by cell proliferation experiment, and the mechanism of the main active component L-POH was studied by flow cytometry, cell cycle experiment, and Western blot. The results showed that L-POH could directly act on vascular smooth muscle to relax pulmonary arterioles, induce ATP-sensitive potassium channels to open, and inhibit extracellular Ca~(2+) influx through voltage-gated calcium channels to relax blood vessels. In addition, L-POH could inhibit the abnormal proliferation of PASMCs induced by hypoxia and promote its apoptosis, and its mechanism may be related to the increase in Bax protein expression and the decrease in p-JAK2, p-STAT3, Bcl-2, and cyclinA2 protein expression. In summary, L-POH can interfere with HPAH by relaxing pulmonary arterioles and inhibiting the proliferation of smooth muscle cells.",

      "abstract": "Background: Adequate sleep is essential for maintaining cognitive function, as evidenced by literature. Perilla frutescens var. acuta Kudo (PF) is a traditional medicinal herb reported to improve vascular cognitive impairment and induce sedation. However, the effects of PF on cognitive impairment caused by sleep deprivation (SD) have not yet been evaluated. This study aims to evaluate the effects of fermented PF (FPF) and its underlying mechanisms in a model of SD-induced cognitive impairment. Methods: Mice were subjected to SD to establish cognitive impairment, and FPF was administered once daily for 3 days. Cognitive performance was assessed using Y-maze and passive avoidance tests, followed by molecular mechanisms analyses. Results: FPF treatment improved SD-induced cognitive impairment, as evidenced by increased spontaneous alternation and extended latency time. Histological analysis revealed that SD impaired the hippocampus, and this impairment was alleviated by FPF treatment. FPF demonstrated antioxidant activity by increasing glutathione levels and decreasing malondialdehyde levels. Furthermore, the decreased levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) observed in sleep-deprived mice were restored with FPF treatment. FPF also enhanced the phosphorylation of tropomyosin receptor kinase B, extracellular signal-regulated kinase, and cAMP response element-binding protein. Conclusions: These results indicate that FPF may have beneficial effects on SD-induced cognitive impairment by protecting against oxidative stress and increasing BDNF expression.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Fatty acids can be protected by changing their structure or form against microbial activity, and the different forms of fatty acids can modulate the ruminal biohydrogenation rate and contribute to the desired fatty acid profile in milk fat. OBJECTIVES: The study investigated the effects of perilla (Perilla frutescens) dietary supplementation in the diet in different technological forms (seed, oil and formaldehyde-treated oil) on milk, plasma and ruminal fatty acid composition, and milk quality in lactating goats. METHODS: The four dietary treatments consisted of (1) no supplementation, basal diet (CON); (2) perilla supplementation as seed at 44.7 g/kg (consisting of 20 g/kg oil (PS)); (3) perilla supplementation as oil at 20 g/kg (PO); (4) perilla supplementation as formaldehyde treated oil at 20 g/kg (protected perilla oil [PPO]). The experiment was implemented in a double 4 × 4 Latin square trial design, and sampling was carried out for 7 days after 21 days of adaptation. RESULTS: Performance parameters were not affected by P. frutescens supplementation to the diet. PO decreased milk fat, whereas PPO increased milk fat. Milk cholesterol was not affected by P. frutescens dietary supplementation. Perilla oil supplementation in different forms to the diet did not affect ruminal pH, VFA and methane production. Perilla oil supplementation in different forms to the diet did not also affect the concentration of blood serum glucose, cholesterol and non-esterified fatty acids. Perilla supplementation to the diet increased the milk conjugated linoleic acid (CLA), C18:3n-3, C22:5n-3, C20:5n-3, C22:6n-3 and polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) concentrations, and PPO group showed the greatest values. Ruminal palmitic (C16:0) acid was decreased, and in perilla groups, stearic acid (C18:0) concentration had the lowest, and ruminal c-9, t-11 CLA concentration had the highest value in PPO. CONCLUSIONS: It has been found that the most effective form of perilla oil in increasing milk quality is that with formaldehyde treatment (protected form). Perilla oil, which is a rich source of omega 3 in the diet, can be used to increase milk quality in goats without adversely affecting performance, ruminal fermentation and blood parameters.",

Astragalus membranaceus Fisch. ex Bunge (A. membranaceus), Nigella sativa L. (N. sativa), and Perilla frutescens (L.) Britton (P. frutescens) are plant species used in traditional medicine for the treatment of various diseases. Their potential to act as immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory, and anti-allergic agents makes them interesting for investigating their clinical potential in alleviating the symptoms of allergic diseases. Allergy affects a large number of people; according to some sources more than 30% of the world population suffer from some type of allergic reaction, with pollen allergy as the most common type. Treatment is usually pharmacological and may not be completely effective or have side effects. Thus, we are seeking traditional medicine, mostly medicinal plants, with promising potential for alleviating allergy symptoms. A literature overview was conducted employing databases such as Scopus, PubMed, Web of Science, Springer, and Google Scholar. This manuscript summarizes recent in vivo preclinical and clinical studies on three species with immunomodulatory activity, provides a comparison of their anti-allergic effects, and underlines the potential of their application in clinical practice. The obtained results confirmed their efficacy in the in vivo and clinical studies, but also emphasize the problem of phytochemical characterization of the species and difference between tested doses. More clinical trials with standardized protocols (defined active molecules, dosage, side effects) are required to obtain safe and effective herbal drugs."

A herb, perilla frutescens, is an effective treatment for pulmonary inflammatory diseases with anti-inflammatory effects; however, its mechanism of action remains unclear. AIM OF THE STUDY: The purpose of this study was to investigate the therapeutic effect and underlying mechanism of perilla frutescens leaf extracts (PLE), in the treatment of ALI by focusing on its ability to treat inflammation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In vivo and in vitro models of ALI induced by LPS. Respiratory function, histopathological changes of lung, and BEAS-2B cells damage were assessed upon PLE. This effect is also tested under conditions of KAT2A over expression and KAT2A silencing. RESULTS: PLE significantly attenuated LPS-induced histopathological changes in the lungs, improved respiratory function, and increased survival rate from LPS stimuation background in mice. PLE remarkably suppressed the phosphorylation of STAT3, AKT, ERK (1/2) and the release of cytokines (IL-6, TNF-α, and IL-1β) induced by LPS via inhibiting the expression of KAT2A. CONCLUSIONS: PLE has a dose-dependent anti-inflammatory effect by inhibiting KAT2A expression to suppress LPS-induced ALI n mice.

Despite the known nutritional value, the reason behind the higher 18:3 content in tetraploid perilla seeds remained unexplored. Gamma irradiation yielded mutants with altered seed fatty acid composition. Among the mutants, DY-46-5 showed a 27% increase in 18:2 due to the 4-bp deletion of PfrFAD3b, and NC-65-12 displayed a 16% increase in 18:2 due to the loss of function of PfrFAD3a through a large deletion. Knocking out both copies of FATTY ACID DESATURASE3 (PfrFAD3a and PfrFAD3b) simultaneously using CRISPR/Cas9 resulted in an increase in 18:2 by up to 75% and a decrease in 18:3 to as low as 0.3% in seeds, emphasizing the pivotal roles of both genes in 18:3 synthesis in tetraploid perilla. Furthermore, diploid Perilla citriodora, the progenitor of cultivated tetraploid perilla, harbors only PfrFAD3b, with a fatty acid analysis revealing lower 18:3 levels than tetraploid perilla. In conclusion, the enhanced 18:3 content in cultivated tetraploid perilla seeds can be attributed to the acquisition of two FAD3 copies through hybridization with wild-type diploid perilla.",

      "abstract": "The gap between serious soil heavy metals pollution and inefficient soil remediation threatens human health. This study proposed a method to improve the phytoremediation efficiency using bamboo vinegar (BV) solution and the potential mechanism was discussed. The results demonstrated that the application of BV increases the content of cadmium (Cd) in vacuole and cell wall hemicellulose 2 in leaves of Perilla frutescens. Simultaneously, it enhanced enzyme activities of superoxide dismutase and catalase in leaves. Therefore, this process alleviated the damage of Cd to functional tissues of Perilla frutescens, thus improving the tolerance of plants to Cd. Moreover, the BV application reduced the Cd content bound by root cell wall pectin fractions and insoluble phosphate, subsequently improving the ability of oxalic acids to carry Cd to the aerial parts. Consequently, the aerial parts obtained a larger amount of Cd enrichment. Overall, the Transfer Factor of Cd from roots to stems and enrichment of Cd in Perilla frutescens were maximally increased by 57.70 % and 54.03 % with the application of 50-fold and 300-fold diluted BV under 2 mg·L-1 Cd stress, respectively. The results can provide a theoretical basis for the promotion of phytoremediation of Cd-contaminated soil treatment technology.",

The covalent binding between PPI and phosphate groups induced conformational changes, facilitating the interaction between PPI and PA. The formed phosphorylated PPI-PA conjugates (LPPI-PA) exhibited a reduced particle size of 196.75 nm, promoting their adsorption at the interface. HIPEs prepared by LPPI-PA conjugates showed higher storage stability due to decreased droplet size, increased interfacial protein adsorption content (90.48%), and the formation of an interconnected network within the system. Additionally, the combination of LPPI and PA anchored PA to the interface, significantly inhibiting lipid oxidation in HIPEs as evidenced by low levels of lipid hydroperoxide (30.33 μmol/g oil) and malondialdehyde (379.34 nmol/g oil). This study holds significant implications for improving the stability of HIPEs.",

In this paper, polyvinyl chloride (PVC) were used to simulate the MPs exposure environment, and the combined effects of MPs + Cu on the germination of perilla seeds were analyzed. The results showed that low concentrations of Cu promoted seed germination, while medium to high concentrations exhibited inhibition and deteriorated the morphology of germinated seeds. The germination potential, germination index and vitality index of 8 mg • L-1 Cu treatment group with were 23.08%, 76.32% and 65.65%, respectively, of the control group. The addition of low concentration PVC increased the above indicators by 1.27, 1.15, and 1.35 times, respectively, while high concentration addition led to a decrease of 65.38%, 82.5%, and 66.44%, respectively. The addition of low concentration PVC reduced the amount of PVC attached to radicle. There was no significant change in germination rate. PVC treatment alone had no significant effect on germination. MPs + Cu inhibited seed germination, which was mainly reflected in the deterioration of seed morphology. Cu significantly enhanced antioxidant enzyme activity, increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) and MDA content. The addition of low concentration PVC enhanced SOD activity, reduced MDA and H2O2 content. The SOD activity of the Cu2+8 + PVC10 group was 4.05 and 1.35 times higher than that of the control group and Cu treatment group at their peak, respectively. At this time, the CAT activity of the Cu2+8 + PVC5000 group increased by 2.66 and 1.42 times, and the H2O2 content was 2.02 times higher than the control. Most of the above indicators reached their peak at 24 h. The activity of α-amylase was inhibited by different treatments, but β-amylase activity, starch and soluble sugar content did not change regularly. The research results can provide new ideas for evaluating the impact of MPs + Cu combined pollution on perilla and its potential ecological risk.",

The resulting nanoparticles, called PFRAE-AgNPs, were characterized using various analytical techniques. The UV-Vis spectrum confirmed the formation of PFRAE-AgNPs, and the FTIR spectrum indicated the participation of rosmarinic acid in their synthesis and stabilization. The XRD pattern revealed the crystal structure of PFRAE-AgNPs, and the TEM analysis showed their spherical morphology with sizes ranging between 20 and 80 nm. The DLS analysis indicated that PFRAE-AgNPs were monodispersed with an average diameter of 44.0 ± 3.2 nm, and the high negative zeta potential (-19.65 mV) indicated their high stability. In the antibacterial assays, the PFRAE-AgNPs showed potent activity against both Gram-positive (Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus) and Gram-negative (Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) bacterial pathogens, suggesting that they could be used as a potential antibacterial agent in the clinical setting. Moreover, the antioxidant activity of PFRAE-AgNPs against DPPH and ABTS radical scavengers highlights their potential in the treatment of various oxidative stress-related diseases. PFRAE-AgNPs also demonstrated significant anticancer activity against a range of cell lines including human colon cancer (COLO205), human prostate carcinoma (PC-3), human lung adenocarcinoma (A549), and human ovarian cancer (SKOV3) cell lines suggesting their potential in cancer therapy. The nanoparticles may also have potential in drug delivery, as their small size and high stability could enable them to cross biological barriers and deliver drugs to specific target sites. In addition to the aforementioned properties, PFRAE-AgNPs were found to be biocompatible towards normal (CHO) cells, which is a crucial characteristic for their application in cancer therapy and drug delivery systems. Their antibacterial, antioxidant, and anticancer properties make them promising candidates for the development of new therapeutic agents. Furthermore, their small size, high stability, and biocompatibility could enable them to be used in drug delivery systems to enhance drug efficacy and reduce side effects.",

This study aimed to investigate the protective effect and antioxidant activity of PFA on busulfan-induced testicular dysfunction, histological damage, oxidative stress (OS), sperm quality, and hormone levels using a mouse model. MATERIALS AND METHODS: C57BL/6 male mice were divided into four groups: control, busulfan-only treated, and varying concentrations of PFA (100 and 200 mg/kg) with busulfan. In the busulfan group, 40 mg/kg of busulfan was intraperitoneally injected to induce azoospermia. Mice were orally administered PFA for 35 consecutive days after busulfan administration. Samples were collected and assessed for testis/body weight, testicular histopathology, sperm quality, serum hormone levels, and OS to evaluate the effects of PFA treatment on spermatogenesis dysfunction induced by busulfan. RESULTS: The busulfan-induced testicular dysfunction model showed reduced testis weight, adverse histological changes, significantly decreased sex hormones and sperm quality, and attenuated OS. These results indicate that PFA treatment significantly increased testis weight, testis/body weight, epididymal sperm count, motility, and testosterone level compared with busulfan alone. PFA treatment also attenuated the busulfan-induced histological changes. Furthermore, compared with mice treated with busulfan alone, PFA supplementation upregulated the testicular mRNA expression of the antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase 1 (Sod1) and glutathione peroxidase 1 (Gpx1), with a decrease in malondialdehyde (MDA) production and an increase in SOD and GPx activities. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that PFA exerts a protective effect against testicular damage by attenuating OS induced by busulfan. Our results suggest that PFA is a potentially relevant drug used to decrease the side effects induced by busulfan on testicular function and sperm during cancer chemotherapy."

We sought to elucidate the active compounds, the targets, and underlying mechanisms of PF leaf in the treatment of allergic asthma by using experimental pharmacology and network pharmacology. An OVA-allergic asthma murine model was constructed to evaluate the effect of PF leaf on allergic asthma. And the network pharmacology and western blotting were performed to evaluate its underlying mechanisms in allergic asthma. PF leaf treatment significantly improved the lung function of OVA model mice and mitigated lung injury by significantly reducing of OVA-specific immunoglobulin E in serum, and interleukin 4, interleukin 5 and tumor necrosis factor alpha in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. 50 core targets were screened based on 8 compounds (determined by high performance liquid chromatography) through compound-target- disease network. Furthermore, MAPK signaling pathway was identified as the pathway mediated by PF leaf with the most potential against allergic asthma. And the WB results showed that PF leaf could down-regulate the expression of p-ERK, p-JNK and p-p38, which was highly consistent with the predicted targets and pathway network. In conclusion, this study provides the evidence to support the molecular mechanisms of PF leaf on the treatment of allergic asthma using network pharmacology and in vivo experiments."

Purple perilla frutescens extract (PPE) possesses various bioactive compounds such as α-asarone, chlorogenic acid and rosmarinic acid. This study examined whether PPE and α-asarone improved dyslipidemia-associated inflammation and inhibited atheroma formation in apolipoprotein E (apoE)-deficient mice, an experimental animal model of atherosclerosis. MATERIALS/METHODS: ApoE-deficient mice were fed on high cholesterol-diet (Paigen's diet) and orally administrated with 10-20 mg/kg PPE and α-asarone for 10 wk. RESULTS: The Paigen's diet reduced body weight gain in apoE-deficient mice, which was not restored by PPE or α-asarone. PPE or α-asarone improved the plasma lipid profiles in Paigen's diet-fed apoE-deficient mice, and despite a small increase in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol, and very LDL were significantly reduced. Paigen's diet-induced systemic inflammation was reduced in PPE or α-asarone-treated apoE-deficient mice. Supplying PPE or α-asarone to mice lacking apoE suppressed aorta atherogenesis induced by atherogenic diet. PPE or α-asarone diminished aorta accumulation of CD68- and/or F4/80-positive macrophages induced by atherogenic diet in apoE-deficient mice. Treatment of apoE-deficient mice with PPE and α-asarone resulted in a significant decrease in plasma cholesteryl ester transfer protein level and an increase in lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase reduced by supply of Paigen's diet. Supplementation of PPE and α-asarone enhanced the transcription of hepatic apoA1 and SR-B1 reduced by Paigen's diet in apoE-deficient mice. CONCLUSIONS: α-Asarone in PPE inhibited inflammation-associated atheroma formation and promoted hepatic HDL-C trafficking in dyslipidemic mice."

Therefore, there is a need for the development of highly efficient drugs. Recent studies have shown that some extracellular vesicles (EVs) derived from cell cultures possess anti-cancer activity and hold great potential as cancer therapeutics. However, the use of mammalian cell cultures for EV production results in low productivity and high costs. To address this issue, extracellular vesicles derived from perilla leaves (Perex) were isolated and investigated for their anti-cancer activity in various cancer cells. Initially, a high concentration of Perex with a low level of impurities was successfully purified through a combination of ultrafiltration and size-exclusion chromatography. Perex exhibited potent anti-cancer activities, inhibiting the proliferation, migration, and invasion of MDA-MB-231 cancer cells, which have high levels of caveolin-1 compared to other cancer and normal cells. This selective attack on cancer cells with high levels of caveolin-1 reduces unwanted side-effects on normal cells. Considering its high productivity, low production cost, selective anti-cancer activity, and minimal side-effects, Perex represents a promising candidate for the therapeutic treatment of breast cancer.",

HPLC analysis revealed that caffeic acid (CA) and rosmarinic acid (RA) are the two main phenols in PLE, and reduced OSCC cell viability in a dose-dependent manner. The optimal CA/RA combination ratio was 1:2 at concentrations of 300-500 μM but had no synergistic inhibitory effect on the viability of OSCC cells. CA, RA, or their combination effectively suppressed interleukin (IL)-1β secretion by OSCC OC3 cells. Long-term treatment with CA and CA/RA mixtures, respectively, induced EGFR activation, which might cause OC3 cells to become EGFR-dependent and consequently increased the sensitivity of OC3 cells to a low dose (5 μM) of the EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor gefitinib. Chronic treatment with CA, RA, or their combination exhibited an inhibitory effect more potent than that of low-dose (1 μM) cisplatin on the colony formation ability of OSCC cells; this may be attributed to the induction of apoptosis by these treatments. These findings suggest that perilla phenols, particularly CA and RA, can be used as adjuvant therapies to improve the efficacy of chemotherapy and EGFR-targeted therapy in OSCC.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The present study aimed to investigate the molecular mechanism through which Perilla essential oil treats acute lung injury (ALI) through network pharmacology, molecular docking, and in vitro assays. METHODS: Relevant ALI targets of the active ingredients of Perilla essential oil were predicted using the SwissTargetPrediction database and meta TarFisher database. These ALI targets were then screened using GeneCards and DisGeNET, and differentially expressed ALI target genes were identified using the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. Next, key targets were enriched using Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG). Protein-protein interaction network analysis was performed to obtain targets with the highest degree values for molecular docking with Perilla essential oil active ingredients. For in vitro experiments, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was used to induce an ALI inflammation model using RAW264.7 cells. The model cells were then treated with Perilla essential oil to detect the protein expression levels of vascular endothelial factor (NO), tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α), and p65 nuclear transcription factor in them. RESULTS: Sixty-eight key targets of Perilla oil were identified for the treatment of ALI. These targets were found to be involved in biological processes related to peptides, response to lipopolysaccharides, the positive regulation of cytokine production, etc., using GO. The signaling pathways found to be associated with the targets included the AGE-RAGE signaling pathway in diabetic complications, the NF-kappa B signaling pathway, and small cell lung cancer and other inflammatory signaling pathways. The five key targets that showed good binding activity with Perilla oil active ingredients included TNF, RELA, PARP1, PTGS2, and IRAK4. In vitro assays showed that Perilla essential oil could significantly reduce NO and TNF-α levels and inhibit the phosphorylation of nuclear transcription factor P65, thus inhibiting the activation of NF-κB signaling pathway. Conclusion Perilla essential oil can play a role in the treatment of ALI by inhibiting the activation of the NF-κB signaling pathway and preventing an excessive inflammatory response. This study thus provides a reference for the in-depth study of the mechanisms through which Perilla essential oil treats ALI.",

IMI-induced phenylpropanoid metabolism disorder resulted in an 8%, 17%, 25%, 10%, 65%, and 29% reduction in phenylalanine, coniferyl aldehyde, ferulic acid, cafestol, p-coumaraldehyde, and p-coumaric acid levels, respectively. Under the treatment of exogenous NSe, the levels of these metabolites were increased by 16%, 32%, 22%, 22%, 92%, and 29%, respectively. The application of exogenous NSe increased the levels of these metabolites and improved the biochemical disorder and quality of P. frutescens leaves by optimizing the phenylpropanoid metabolic pathway and enhancing the antioxidant system. Overall, the results suggest that foliar application of NSe could alleviate the oxidative stress toxicity induced by IMI and improve the quality of P. frutescens."

      "abstract": "The present study reports the biomimetic synthesis of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) using a simple, cost effective and eco-friendly method. In this method, the flavonoid extract of Perilla frutescens (PFFE) was used as a bioreduction agent for the reduction of metallic silver into nanosilver, called P. frutescens flavonoid extract silver nanoparticles (PFFE-AgNPs). The Ultraviolet-Visible (UV-Vis) spectrum showed a characteristic absorption peak at 440 nm that confirmed the synthesis of PFFE-AgNPs. A Fourier transform infrared spectroscopic (FTIR) analysis of the PFFE-AgNPs revealed that flavonoids are involved in the bioreduction and capping processes. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns confirmed the face-centered cubic (FCC) crystal structure of PFFE-AgNPs. A transmission electron microscopic (TEM) analysis indicated that the synthesized PFFE-AgNPs are 20 to 70 nm in size with spherical morphology and without any aggregation. Dynamic light scattering (DLS) studies showed that the average hydrodynamic size was 44 nm. A polydispersity index (PDI) of 0.321 denotes the monodispersed nature of PFFE-AgNPs. Further, a highly negative surface charge or zeta potential value (-30 mV) indicates the repulsion, non-aggregation, and stability of PFFE-AgNPs. PFFE-AgNPs showed cytotoxic effects against cancer cell lines, including human colon carcinoma (COLO205) and mouse melanoma (B16F10), with IC50 concentrations of 59.57 and 69.33 μg/mL, respectively. PFFE-AgNPs showed a significant inhibition of both Gram-positive (Listeria monocytogens and Enterococcus faecalis) and Gram-negative (Salmonella typhi and Acinetobacter baumannii) bacteria pathogens. PFFE-AgNPs exhibited in vitro antioxidant activity by quenching 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) free radicals with IC50 values of 72.81 and 92.48 µg/mL, respectively. In this study, we also explained the plausible mechanisms of the biosynthesis, anticancer, and antibacterial effects of PFFE-AgNPs. Overall, these findings suggest that PFFE-AgNPs have potential as a multi-functional nanomaterial for biomedical applications, particularly in cancer therapy and infection control. However, it is important to note that further research is needed to determine the safety and efficacy of these nanoparticles in vivo, as well as to explore their potential in other areas of medicine.",

The ethanol extract of P. frutescens leaves was the most cytotoxic for the prostate cancer cells. From high-performance liquid chromatography analysis, rosmarinic acid was identified as the major metabolite in the leaf extracts. Network analysis revealed interactions from multiple affected targets and pathways of the metabolites. From gene ontology enrichment analysis, P. frutescens leaf metabolites could significantly affect 14 molecular functions and 12 biological processes in five cellular components. Four (4) KEGG pathways, including for prostate cancer, and six (6) Reactome pathways were shown to be significantly affected. The molecular simulation confirmed the interactions of relevant protein targets with key metabolites, including rosmarinic acid.

However, phenolic chemicals are still abundant in pressed perilla seed meal (PSM), which was previously thought to be useless after oil extraction. In our study, PSM was extracted using five solvents (water and 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100% ethanol) based on different ethanol concentrations, and its antioxidant activity, phenolic compounds, and inhibitory effects against key enzymes related to diabetes mellitus were evaluated. The 75% ethanol extract had higher phenolic (105.58 mg GAE/g DW) and flavonoid (66.52 mg QE/g DW) contents and showed better antioxidant and inhibitory effects against α-glucosidase and α-amylase. Analysis of the phenolic compounds of the five extracts by HPLC indicated the presence of apigenin, rosmarinic acid, benzoic acid, caffeic acid, and vanillic acid. Therefore, because of its high antioxidant activity and inhibitory capacity against enzymes relevant to diabetes, the 75% ethanol extract of perilla seed meal has the most potential to be used as a functional or nutraceutical food in the prevention and treatment of oxidation and diabetes."

      "abstract": "ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Traditional Chinese medicine posits that affect-mind ill-being is the primary cause of depression, with Qi movement stagnation as its pathogenesis. As such, clinical treatment for depression should prioritize regulating Qi and relieving depressive symptoms. The pharmacological properties of traditional Chinese medicine indicate that Perilla frutescens may have potential therapeutic effects on depression and other neuropsychiatric diseases due to its ability to regulate Qi and alleviate depressive symptoms. Although previous studies have reported the antidepressant effects of Perilla frutescens, the mechanism underlying PFEO inhalation-mediated antidepressant effect remains unclear. AIM OF THE STUDY: The aim of this investigation is to elucidate the antidepressant mechanisms of PFEO by examining its effects on monoamine neurotransmitters and the BDNF/TrkB signaling pathway. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The CUMS rat model of depression was established, and the depressive state of the animals was assessed through sucrose preference and forced swim tests. ELISA assays were conducted to determine monoamine neurotransmitter levels in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex of rats. Immunohistochemistry, western blotting, and RT-PCR experiments were employed to investigate the BDNF/TrkB signaling pathway's regulation of depression via PFEO inhalation. RESULTS: It has been observed that inhalation administration of PFEO can significantly enhance the preference for sugar water in CUMS rats and reduce their immobility time during forced swimming. Additionally, there was an increase in the levels of monoamine transmitters in both the hippocampus and cerebral cortex of these rats. Furthermore, there was an upregulation in the expression levels of BDNF and TrkB positive cells as well as BDNF and TrkB proteins within both regions, along with increased BDNF mRNA and TrkB mRNA expression levels. CONCLUSION: The antidepressant effect of PFEO via inhalation administration is speculated to be mediated through the monoamine neurotransmitters and BDNF/TrkB signaling pathway.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Dermatophyte caused by Trichophyton mentagrophytes is a global disease with a growing prevalence that is difficult to cure. Perilla frutescens (L.) Britt. is an edible and medicinal plant. Ancient books of Traditional Chinese Medicine and modern pharmacological studies have shown that it has potential anti-fungi activity. This is the first study to explore the inhibitory effects of compounds from P. frutescens on Trichophyton mentagrophytes and its mechanism of action coupled with the antifungal activity in vitro from network pharmacology, transcriptomics and proteomics. METHODS: Five most potential inhibitory compounds against fungi in P. frutescens was screened with network pharmacology. The antifungal activity of the candidates was detected by a broth microdilution method. Through in vitro antifungal assays screening the compound with efficacy, transcriptomics and proteomics were performed to investigate the pharmacological mechanisms of the effective compound against Trichophyton mentagrophytes. Furthermore, the real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was applied to verify the expression of genes. RESULTS: The top five potential antifungal compounds in P. frutescens screened by network pharmacology are: progesterone, luteolin, apigenin, ursolic acid and rosmarinic acid. In vitro antifungal assays showed that rosmarinic acid had a favorable inhibitory effect on fungi. The transcriptomic findings exhibited that the differentially expressed genes of fungus after rosmarinic acid intervention were mainly enriched in the carbon metabolism pathway, while the proteomic findings suggested that rosmarinic acid could inhibit the average growth of Trichophyton mentagrophytes by interfering with the expression of enolase in the glycolysis pathway. Comparison of real-time PCR and transcriptomics results showed that the trends of gene expression in glycolytic, carbon metabolism and glutathione metabolic pathways were identical. The binding modes and interactions between rosmarinic acid and enolase were preliminary explored by molecular docking analysis. CONCLUSION: The key findings of the present study manifested that rosmarinic acid, a medicinal compound extracted from P. frutescens, had pharmacological activity in inhibiting the growth of Trichophyton mentagrophytes by affecting its enolase expression to reduce metabolism. Rosmarinic acid is expected to be an efficacious product for prevention and treatment of dermatophytes."

ZSY. Seedlings at the six-leaf stage were grown in hydroponics and treated with 0 (control), 10 µM, 180 µM, and 360 µM CdCl2 for 7 days; then, the differences in Cd tolerance and accumulation and physiological and metabolic responses were evaluated among \"ZSY\" and its parents. At high Cd dose, the growth of \"ZSY,\" such as fresh weight, plant height, and root length, was evidently better than \"78-04.\" In contrast to P. frutescens and \"78-04,\" \"ZSY\" could accumulate more Cd in shoots than roots. Under the same treatment, \"ZSY\" accumulated greater amounts of Cd in both shoots (195-1523 mg kg-1) and roots (140-1281 mg kg-1) than \"78-04\" (shoots: 35-89 mg kg-1, roots: 39-252 mg kg-1), followed by P. frutescens (shoots: 156-454 mg kg-1, roots: 103-761 mg kg-1). BCF and TF values of \"ZSY\" reached 38-195 and 1.2-1.4, which were far higher than those of \"78-04\" (BCF: 2.2-35.3, TF: 0.35-0.9). Perilla frutescens was found with BCF and TF of 11-156 and 0.5-1.5. Cd stress obviously promoted the production of ROS and MDA in seedlings but reduced chlorophyll contents, especially in \"78-04.\" As a response to Cd stress, \"ZSY\" had higher SOD and CAT activities when compared to P. frutescens and \"78-04,\" while \"78-04\" produced more POD and proline than those of P. frutescens and \"ZSY.\" Cd stress could affect the production and accumulation of alkaloids and phenolic compounds in root (endodermis and cortex) and mesophyll. At high Cd doses, P. frutescens and \"ZSY\" had more alkaloids in tissues than \"78-04.\" Phenolic compounds in \"78-04\" were more obviously inhibited compared with P. frutescens and \"ZSY.\" These secondary metabolites may play an important role in eliminating oxidative damage and enhancing Cd tolerance and accumulation in \"ZSY\" and P. frutescens. Results indicated that distant hybridization could be one of effective methods for introducing excellent genes from metal-hyperaccumulators into high biomass species, creating plants with superior phytoremediation potential.",

Microgreens of P. frutescens were grown under light and dark conditions and harvested after 10, 15, 20, and 25 days of each treatment. Although dry weight values of microgreens gradually increased from 10 to 25 days of both treatments, the microgreens grown under light treatment possessed slightly higher levels of dry weight than those grown in the dark. Rosmarinic acid and total phenolic content (TPC) were also analyzed using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and Folin-Ciocalteu assay. The accumulation patterns of rosmarinic acid and TPC gradually increased and decreased, respectively, in P. frutescens microgreens grown in continuous darkness. The highest accumulation was observed in microgreens grown for 20 days. However, rosmarinic acid and TPC values were not significantly different in microgreens grown under light conditions. According to the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical inhibition assay, the extracts of P. frutescens microgreens were confirmed to be strong antioxidants, and their ability to scavenge DPPH radicals was positively correlated with the total phenolic content in the microgreens after 10, 15, 20, and 25 days of both treatments. Considering the relatively higher values of dry weight, rosmarinic acid, TPC, and DPPH assay, P. frutescens microgreens after 20 days of darkness and 20 days of light treatment, respectively, were selected for screening antibacterial activity using nine pathogens. Both microgreen extracts showed strong antibacterial activity against pathogens. In particular, the extracts of microgreens grown for 20 days under light treatment showed higher antimicrobial effects. Therefore, the light treatments for 20 days, as well as the darkness treatment for 20 days, were the best conditions for P. frutescens microgreen production because of their high levels of dry weight, phenolics, and biological activities."

      "abstract": "Previous studies have indicated that the adrenergic receptor signaling pathway plays a fundamental role in chronic stress-induced cancer metastasis. In this study, we investigated whether an ethanol extract of Perilla frutescens leaves (EPF) traditionally used to treat stress-related symptoms by moving Qi could regulate the adrenergic agonist-induced metastatic ability of cancer cells. Our results show that adrenergic agonists including norepinephrine (NE), epinephrine (E), and isoproterenol (ISO) increased migration and invasion of MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells and Hep3B human hepatocellular carcinoma cells. However, such increases were completely abrogated by EPF treatment. E/NE induced downregulation of E-cadherin and upregulation of N-cadherin, Snail, and Slug. Such effects were clearly reversed by pretreatment with EPF, suggesting that the antimetastatic activity of EPF could be related to epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) regulation. EPF suppressed E/NE-stimulated Src phosphorylation. Inhibition of Src kinase activity with dasatinib completely suppressed the E/NE-induced EMT process. Transfecting MDA-MB-231 cells with constitutively activated Src (SrcY527F) diminished the antimigration effect of EPF. Taken together, our results demonstrate that EPF can suppress the adrenergic agonist-promoted metastatic ability of cancer cells by inhibiting Src-mediated EMT. This study provides basic evidence supporting the probable use of EPF to prevent metastasis in cancer patients, especially those under chronic stress.",

      "abstract": "Objectives: This study aimed to evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of PE extracts developed for the purpose of relieving pain and improving knee joint function on semi-healthy people with mild knee joint pain. Methods: A randomized, double-blind, two-arm, single-center, placebo-controlled clinical trial was conducted. Individuals with knee joint pain and a visual analogue scale (VAS) score < 50 mm were included in the study, and participants with radiological arthritis were excluded. Participants were administered either PFE or a placebo capsule (700 mg, twice a day) orally for eight weeks. The comparisons of the changed VAS score and Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis (WOMAC) scores between the PFE and placebo groups were primary outcomes, while the five inflammation-related laboratory tests including cartilage oligomeric matrix protein, cyclooxygenase-2, neutrophil and lymphocyte ratio, high sensitive C-reactive protein, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate were secondary outcomes. Also, a safety assessment was done. Results: Eighty participants (mean age, 38.4 ± 14.0, male: female, 28:52) were enrolled; 75 completed the trial (PFE 36 and placebo 39). After eight weeks, both VAS and WOMAC scores were reduced in the PFE and placebo groups. The changed scores were significantly higher in the PFE group compared to the placebo group: 19.6 ± 10.9 vs. 6.8 ± 10.5; VAS scores (p < 0.001), and 20.5 ± 14.7 vs. 9.3 ± 16.5; total WOMAC scores (p < 0.01) including the sub-scores for pain, stiffness, and functions. No significant changes were reported in the five inflammation-related laboratory parameters. All adverse events were considered minor and unlikely to result from the intervention. Conclusion: Eight weeks of PFE intake was more effective than placebo in reducing knee joint pain and improving knee joint function in sub-healthy people with mild knee joint pain, and there were no major safety concerns.

      "abstract": "Excessive stress plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of mood disorders such as depression. Fermented natural products have recently attracted attention because of their health benefits. We evaluated the antidepressant-like efficacy of fermented Perilla frutescens (FPF), and its underlying mechanisms, in sleep deprivation (SD)-induced stress mice. SD-stressed mice revealed a remarkable increase in the immobility time in both forced swimming test and tail suspension test; this increase was ameliorated by treatment with FPF at doses of 100 and 150 mg/kg. FPF treatment also reduced the level of stress hormones such as corticosterone and adrenocorticotropic hormone. Additionally, FPF increased the levels of serotonin and dopamine which were significantly decreased in the brain tissues of SD-stressed mice. The increased expression of proinflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-α and IL1β, and the decreased expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the stressed mice were significantly reversed by FPF treatment. Furthermore, FPF also increased phosphorylation of tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB), extracellular regulated protein kinase (ERK), and cAMP response element binding protein (CREB). Among the six components isolated from FPF, protocatechuic acid and luteolin-7-O-glucuronide exhibited significant antidepressant-like effects, suggesting that they are major active components. These findings suggest that FPF has therapeutic potential for SD-induced stress, by correcting dysfunction of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and modulating the BDNF/TrkB/ERK/CREB signaling pathway.",

      "abstract": "The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of Perilla frutescens, alone or in combination with Lactobacillus plantarum a214 or citric acid, on forage oat silage quality, bacterial and fungal microbiological profile during ensiling and aerobic exposure. With the exception of Perilla frutescens, all additives could improve silage quality of forage oat based on lower ammonia-nitrogen content and higher residual of water soluble carbohydrates during anaerobic fermentation compared to control silage, especially in Perilla frutescens combined with citric acid (CAPF). Lactobacillus was the dominant bacteria in all silages, while CAPF group increased the relative abundance of Lactobacillus lindneri and Lactobacillus brevis compared to control silage. The application of Perilla frutescens suppressed the relative abundance of yeasts such as Pichia fermentans and Wickerhamomyces anomalus in response to aerobic exposure, especially in CAPF treatment, leading to high acetic acids and lower dry matter loss, as well as good aerobic stability. Therefore, Perilla frutescens, alone or in combination with citric acid, has potential to improve aerobic stability of forage oat silage by shifting bacterial and fungal community composition, and can be used as new additive to prepare high-quality silage for animal production."

Previous findings suggest that P. frutescens (L.) can alleviate renal injury, but its effects and mechanisms underlying alleviation of TMAO-induced kidney damage remain unclear. In this study, a TMAO injury model, in vivo and in vitro, was established to clarify the effects and mechanisms of P. frutescens in alleviating TMAO-induced kidney injury. The results show that TMAO (60 mM/L) can induce the activation of apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1)-c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), thus aggravating downstream cell apoptosis in vitro. The study also found that P. frutescens aqueous extract (PFAE) (5 mg/mL) can inhibit TMAO-induced apoptosis by downregulating ASK1-JNK phosphorylation. In the in vivo experiments, it was demonstrated that TMAO can increase the levels of blood urea nitrogen and cystatin C, aggravating renal tubular epithelial apoptosis. The results also show that PFAE can reduce TMAO-induced renal damage by inhibiting ASK1-JNK phosphorylation in vivo. Our findings confirmed that P. frutescens can alleviate TMAO-induced renal tubule apoptosis by regulating ASK1-JNK phosphorylation, indicating that P. frutescens may be an effective treatment for alleviating TMAO damage in CKD.",

Five-week-old male C57BL/6J mice were divided into HD (high-fat diet control), HDD (high-fat diet along with dextran sodium sulfate [DSS] administration), HDD + FO, HDD + PO, and HDD + OO where HDD + FO, HDD + PO, and HDD + OO groups were treated with fish oil (FO), PO, and olive oil (OO), respectively. Biochemical analysis of serum, quantitative polymerase chain reaction, and western blotting of colon tissue were conducted to measure inflammatory marker levels. Administration of DSS resulted in colon shortening and a higher disease activity score than HD group. These symptoms were significantly reversed in the oil-treated groups. The body weight loss after DSS administration was significantly lower in the HDD + PO and HDD + OO groups than in the HDD and HDD + FO groups. PO significantly attenuated the levels of tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin (IL)-6, and IL-1β in the serum and colon. The mRNA expression levels of proinflammatory markers in the colon were reduced, whereas those of tight junction proteins and epithelial defense barrier-associated markers were increased by PO treatment. The protein expression of p-p65 was significantly lower in the PO-treated group than the HDD group. In summary, this study revealed that PO improved colitis in the DSS-induced mouse model, indicating its potential role in managing conditions such as ulcerative colitis.",

      "abstract": "Asthma is a highly prevalent and heterogeneous chronic respiratory disease and is often treated with inhaled corticosteroids or in combination with a β2-adrenergic receptor (β2-AR) agonist. However, around 5% of asthma remains uncontrolled, and more effective antiasthmatic drugs with known mechanisms are in high demand. Herein, we immobilized β2-AR on the polystyrene amino microsphere surface in a one-step fashion. The successful immobilization of β2-AR was verified by scanning electron microscopy and chromatographic analysis. We screened rosmarinic acid (RA) as the bioactive compound targeting β2-AR in Perilla frutescens (L.) Britton by mass spectroscopy. The binding constant between RA and β2-AR was determined to be 2.95 × 104 M-1 by adsorption energy distribution and frontal analysis. The antiasthmatic effect and mechanism of RA were examined on a murine model of allergic asthma induced by ovalbumin (OVA) and aluminum hydroxide. The results showed that RA significantly reduced lung inflammatory cell numbers, the production of Th2 cytokines, and the secretion of total IgE, OVA-specific IgE, and eotaxin. The decreased inflammatory cell infiltration and mucus hypersecretion were associated with the inhibition of the NF-κB signaling pathway. Moreover, the mRNA expression levels of AMCase, CCL11, CCR3, Ym2, and E-selectin in the lung tissues were effectively reduced. It is the first time that RA was proven to target β2-AR and be effective in counteracting allergic airway inflammation via the NF-κB signaling pathway. Therefore, the immobilized β2-AR preserves the potential in screening antiasthmatic compounds from herbal medicine, and RA can be developed as an effective agent for the treatment of allergic asthma.",

In view of their molecular mechanisms were not well understood, we integrated the metabolomic and transcriptomic analyses of the light-sensitive perilla variety under different light intensity. The perilla leave color were obviously affected under different treatments. Totally 140 flavonoid metabolites and 2461 genes showed steady change, among which 60 flavonoid metabolites were increased accumulation and 983 genes were upregulated expression under elevated light intensity treatment. Light treatment prominently affected the expression of genes involved in the main anthocyanin metabolites accumulation in perilla leaves. Using WGCNA analysis, we identified 4 key genes in anthocyanin biosynthesis pathway (CHI, DFR, and ANS) and 147 transcription factors (MYB, bHLH, bZIP, ERF, and NAC) involved in malonylshisonin biosynthesis. Among them, 6 MYBs and 4 bZIPs were predicted to play important roles in light regulation of malonylshisonin biosynthesis based on phylogenetic construction, correlation analysis, cis-acting element identification and qPCR verification. The identified key genes and regulatory factors will help us to understand the potential mechanism of photo-regulated anthocyanin accumulation in perilla."

In this research, two pairs of 7,7'-cyclolignan enantiomers, possessing a cyclobutane moiety, (+)/(-)-perfrancin [(+)/(-)-1] and (+)/(-)-magnosalin [(+)/(-)-2], were separated from P. frutescens leaves. The present study achieved the chiral separation and determined the absolute configuration of (±)-1 and (±)-2. Compounds (+)-1 and (-)-1 have notable anti-inflammatory effects by reducing the secretion of pro-inflammatory factors (NO, TNF-α and IL-6) and the expression of pro-inflammatory mediators (iNOS and COX-2).

      "abstract": "In order to expand the applications of plant protein in food formulations, enhancement of its functionalities is meaningful. Herein, the effects of ultrasonic (20 KHz, 400 W, 20 min)-assisted pH shift (pH 10 and 12) treatment on the structure, interfacial behaviors, as well as the emulsifying and foaming properties of perilla protein isolate (PPI) were investigated. Results showed that the solubility of PPI treated by ultrasonic-assisted pH shift (named UPPI-10/12) exceeded 90 %, which was at least 2 and 1.4 times that of untreated PPI and ultrasound-based PPI. Meanwhile, UPPI-10/12 possessed higher foamability (increasing by at least 1.2 times) and good emulsifying stability. Ultrasonic-assisted pH shift treatment decomposed large PPI aggregates into tiny particles, evident from the dynamic light scattering (DLS) and atomic force microscopy results. Besides, this approach induced a decrease in α-helix of PPI and an increase in β-sheet, which might result in the exposure of the hydrophobic group on the structural surface of PPI, thus leading to the increase of surface hydrophobicity. The smaller size and higher hydrophobicity endowed UPPI-10/12 faster adsorption rate, tighter interfacial structure, and higher elastic modulus at the air- and oil-water interfaces, evident from the cryo-SEM and interfacial dilatational rheological results. Thus, the emulsifying and foaming properties could evidently enhance. This study demonstrated that ultrasonic-assisted pH shift technique was a simple approach to effectively improve the functional performance of PPI.",

      "abstract": "Airway respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is usually caused by a severe pulmonary infection. However, there is currently no effective treatment for ARDS. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has been shown to effectively treat inflammatory lung diseases, but a clear mechanism of action of TCM is not available. Perilla fruit water extract (PFWE) has been used to treat cough, excessive mucus production, and some pulmonary diseases. Thus, we propose that PFWE may be able to reduce lung inflammation and neutrophil infiltration in a lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated murine model. C57BL/6 mice were stimulated with LPS (10 μg/mouse) by intratracheal (IT) injection and treated with three doses of PFWE (2, 5, and 8 g/kg) by intraperitoneal (IP) injections. To investigate possible mechanisms, A549 cells were treated with PFWE and stimulated with LPS. Our results showed that PFWE decreased airway resistance, neutrophil infiltration, vessel permeability, and interleukin (IL)-6 and chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2 (CCL2/MCP-1) expressions in vivo. In addition, the PFWE inhibited the expression of IL-6, CCL2/MCP-1, chemokine (CXC motif) ligand 1 (CXCL1/GROα), and IL-8 in vitro. Moreover, PFWE also inhibited the MAPK/JNK-AP-1/c-Fos signaling pathway in A549 cells. In conclusion, we demonstrated that PFWE attenuated pro-inflammatory cytokine and chemokine levels and downregulated neutrophil recruitment through the MAPK/JNK-AP-1/c-Fos pathway. Thus, PFWE can be a potential drug to assist the treatment of ARDS."

      "abstract": "Vascular dementia (VaD) is characterized by a time-dependent memory deficit and essentially combined with evidence of neuroinflammation. Thus, polyphenol-rich natural plants, which possess anti-inflammatory properties, have received much scientific attention. This study investigated whether Perilla frutescens leaf extract (PFL) exerts therapeutic efficacy against VaD. Sprague Dawley rats were divided into five groups: SO, sham-operated and vehicle treatment; OP, operated and vehicle treatment; PFL-L, operated and low-dose (30 mg/kg) PFL treatment; PFL-M, operated and medium-dose (60 mg/kg) PFL treatment; and PFL-H, operated and high-dose (90 mg/kg) PFL treatment. Two-vessel occlusion and hypovolemia (2VO/H) were employed as a surgical model of VaD, and PFL was given orally perioperatively for 23 days. The rats underwent the Y-maze, Barnes maze, and passive avoidance tests and their brains were subjected to histologic studies. The OP group showed VaD-associated memory deficits, hippocampal neuronal death, and microglial activation; however, the PFL-treated groups showed significant attenuations in all of the above parameters. Using lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated BV-2 cells, a murine microglial cell line, we measured PFL-mediated changes on the production of nitric oxide (NO), TNF-α, and IL-6, and the activities of their upstream MAP kinases (MAPKs)/NFκB/inducible NO synthase (iNOS). The LPS-induced upregulations of NO, TNF-α, and IL-6 production and MAPKs/NFκB/iNOS activities were globally and significantly reversed by 12-h pretreatment of PFL. This suggests that PFL can counteract VaD-associated structural and functional deterioration through the attenuation of neuroinflammation."

After 12 months of intervention, the POAC group showed generally higher cognitive index scores than the PO group. The beneficial effects of combined supplementation on cognitive function were associated with increased ALA and eicosapentaenoic acid levels in red blood cell plasma membranes, increased serum biological antioxidant potential, and decreased serum triglyceride, glucose, and N-(epsilon)-carboxymethyl-lysine (CML), an advanced glycation end-product and biochemical marker of oxidative stress levels. The effects of combined supplementation on cognitive function also showed a significant negative correlation with serum CML levels after 12 months of intervention. Our findings suggest that combined long-term supplementation with PO and A. cordifolia more effectively ameliorates age-related cognitive decline than PO alone. These findings may serve as a basis for the development of new supplements for brain health. Clinical Trial Registry, UMIN000040863.",

      "abstract": "Previous studies have examined the effects of n-3 fatty acid intake in supplement form or fish oil capsules, but there are few studies based on other foods. Perilla oil is a traditional Japanese seed oil rich in n-3 fatty acids. This randomised trial aimed to determine the appropriate n-3 fatty acid dose through consumption of perilla oil, which improves gut function and microbiota in trained athletes, and the amount of fat fuel required to provide energy to athletes involved in high-intensity training to improve athletic performance. Thirty-six female athletes training six times per week were randomly assigned to three groups according to perilla oil intake: 9 g/d (high oil intake (HOI)), 3 g/d (low oil intake (LOI)) and placebo-supplementation (PLA) groups. The HOI and LOI groups had perilla oil-containing jelly and the PLA group had placebo jelly for 8 weeks. Gut microbiota, constipation score and urinary biochemical index were measured pre- and post-intervention. The spoilage bacteria, Proteobacteria, significantly decreased (P = 0·036, d = 0·53), whereas Butyrate-producing bacteria, Lachnospiraceae, significantly increased (P = 0·007, d = 1·2) in the HOI group. Urinary indoxyl sulphate significantly decreased in the HOI group only (P = 0·010, d = 0·82). Changes in the constipation score were significantly lower in the HOI group (P = 0·020) and even lower in the LOI group (P = 0·073) than in the PLA group; there were significant differences between groups (P = 0·035). Therefore, perilla oil intake may improve gut function and microbiota in athletes, with higher doses resulting in further improvement."

      "abstract": "Psoriasis is reported to be a common chronic immune-mediated skin disease characterized by abnormal keratinocytes and cell proliferation. Perilla leaves are rich in essential oils, fatty acids, and flavonoids, which are recognized for their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. In this study, the alleviating effect of essential oil (PO) extracted from Perilla frutescens stems and leaves on imiquimod (IMQ) -induced psoriasis-like lesions in BALB/c mice were investigated. Results showed that PO ameliorated psoriasis-like lesions in vivo, reduced the expression of lymphocyte antigen 6 complex locus G6D (Ly-6G), which is a marker of neutrophil activation, and inhibited the expression of inflammatory factors interleukin 1 (IL-1), interleukin 6 (IL-6), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), and cyclooxygenase 2 (COX2). In addition, PO significantly decreased the expression of cytokines such as IL-6, IL-1, interleukin 23 (IL-23), interleukin 17 (IL-17), and nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB). Furthermore, the down-regulation of mRNA levels of psoriasis-related pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-17, interleukin 22 (IL-22), IL-23, interferon-α (IFN-α), and Interferon-γ (IFN-γ) was observed with the treatment of PO. All results show a concentration dependence of PO, with low concentrations showing the best results. These results suggest that PO effectively alleviated psoriasis-like skin lesions and down-regulated inflammatory responses, which indicates that PO could potentially be used for further studies on inflammation-related skin diseases such as psoriasis and for the treatment of psoriasis such as psoriasis natural plant essential oil resources.",

Patients were enrolled in a 12-month randomized, double-blind, parallel-armed study. Randomized participants in the PO group received soft gelatin capsules containing 1.47 mL (0.88 g of ALA) of PO daily, and those in the PO + ponkan powder (POPP) group received soft gelatin capsules containing both 1.47 mL of PO and 1.12 g ponkan powder (2.91 mg of nobiletin) daily. At the end of intervention, the POPP group showed significantly higher cognitive index scores than the PO group. The pro-cognitive effects of POPP treatment were accompanied by increases in ALA and docosahexaenoic acid levels in red blood cell plasma membranes, serum brain-derived neurotropic factor (BDNF) levels, and biological antioxidant potential. We demonstrate that 12-month intervention with POPP enhances serum BDNF and antioxidant potential, and may improve age-related cognitive impairment in healthy elderly people by increasing red blood cell ω-3 fatty acid levels.

Perilla frutescens (L.) Britt., an important traditional medicinal plant with excellent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, is widely used for the treatment of respiratory disease in China. However, its protective activity and mechanism against COPD airway inflammation have not been fully studied. Here, the anti-inflammatory effects of the PLE were investigated, and its underlying mechanisms were then elucidated. The presented results suggested a notable effect of the PLE on airway inflammation of COPD, by significantly ameliorating inflammatory cell infiltration in lung tissue, lessening leukocytes (lymphocytes, neutrophils, and macrophages) and inflammatory mediators (interleukin 4 (IL-4), IL-6, IL-17A, interferon γ (IFN-γ), and tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α)) in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) of cigarette smoke (CS)/lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced COPD mice in vivo and inhibiting the production of inflammatory factors (nitric oxide (NO), IL-6, and TNF-α) and intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 cells in vitro. For further extent, PLE treatment significantly suppressed the expression and phosphorylation of TLR4, Syk, PKC, and NF-κB p65 in vivo and their mRNA in vitro. Subsequently, by co-treating with their inhibitors in vitro, its potential mechanism via TLR4/Syk/PKC/NF-κB p65 signals was disclosed. In summary, the obtained results indicated a noteworthy effective activity of the PLE on COPD inflammation, and partly, the TLR4/Syk/PKC/NF-κB p65 axis might be the potential mechanism."

Cold stratification is thought to be the most effective treatment and is customarily performed for 2 weeks to induce germination of perilla mericarps. However, this procedure requires an additional 2 weeks before sowing and cultivation, thereby decreasing cultivation efficiency. To address this problem, germination experiments were conducted in this study in order to identify a shorter and more efficient pretreatment strategy for germination of perilla mericarps. Pretreatment with sulfuric acid (10 min versus 1 min) and gibberellin (8 h and 1 h versus 5 min, at a rate of 100 versus 10 ppm) were performed using mericarps from pure strains of perilla. As a result, sulfuric acid treatment tended to reduce the germination rate, while gibberellin treatment resulted in an equivalent or similar germination rate as cold stratification. Gibberellin treatment was also found to be effective in mericarps with a relatively old harvest date and low germination energy. Considering the convenience and safety of the treatment process as well as the results of the germination experiments, these findings suggest that a short period of gibberellin treatment could help shorten the process of perilla cultivation.",

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: Perilla frutescens (L.) Britt., a traditional edible-medicinal herb in China, has been used to treat cardiovascular and cerebrovascular (cardio-cerebrovascular) diseases for thousands of years. However, knowledge of the mechanisms underlying the effects of essential oil from P. frutescens (EOPF) in the treatment of cardio-cerebrovascular diseases is lacking. The promotion of angiogenesis is beneficial in the treatment of ischemic cardio-cerebrovascular diseases. The current study investigated the pro-angiogenic role of EOPF and its main component perillaldehyde in sunitinib-injured transgenic Tg (flk1:EGFP) zebrafish embryos and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) for the first time. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The pro-angiogenic effects of EOPF and perillaldehyde were observed in vivo using transgenic Tg (flk1:EGFP) zebrafish embryos and in vitro using HUVECs. Cell viability, proliferation, migration, tube formation, and protein levels were detected by MTT, EdU staining, wound healing, transwell chamber, and Western blot assays, respectively. RESULTS: EOPF and perillaldehyde exerted a significant stimulatory effect on the formation of zebrafish intersegmental vessels (ISVs). Moreover, EOPF and perillaldehyde promoted proliferation, migration, and tube formation in sunitinib-treated HUVECs. Additionally, our findings uncovered that the pro-angiogenic effects of EOPF and perillaldehyde were mediated by increases in the expression ratios of p-ERK1/2 to ERK1/2 and Bcl-2 to Bax. CONCLUSION: The present study is the first report to provide clear evidence that EOPF and perillaldehyde promote angiogenesis by stimulating repair of sunitinib-injured ISVs in zebrafish embryos and promoting proliferation, migration, and tube formation in sunitinib-injured HUVECs. The underlying mechanisms are related to increased p-ERK1/2 to ERK1/2 and Bcl-2 to Bax expression ratios. EOPF and perillaldehyde may be used in the treatment of cardio-cerebrovascular diseases, which is consistent with the traditional application of P. frutescens.",

      "abstract": "Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a chronic progressive disease that seriously threatens human health. Some patients will continue to progress into the CKD stage 3-5 (also called chronic renal failure), which is mainly manifested by a decline in renal function and multi-system damage. Perilla frutescens (L.) Britton. (Lamiaceae) is one of the most widely used traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) herbs in CKD, especially in CKD stage 3-5. But its active components and mechanisms are still unclear. In this study, we used network pharmacology to analyze the active components of P. frutescens and the main therapeutic targets for intervention in CKD stage 3-5. Then, the key components were selected for enrichment analysis and identified by high performance liquid chromatograph (HPLC). Finally, we verified the critical components through molecular docking, and in vitro experiments. The results show that 19 main active components of P. frutescens were screened, and 108 targets were intersected with CKD stage 3-5. The PPI network was constructed and found that the core nodes AKT1, TP53, IL6, TNF, and MAPK1 may be key therapeutic targets. Enrichment analysis shows that related targets may be involved in regulating various biological functions, and play a therapeutic role in CKD stage 3-5 by regulating apoptosis, T cell receptor, and PI3K-AKT signaling pathways. Molecular docking indicates that the key active components were well docked with its corresponding targets. Five active components were identified and quantified by HPLC. According to the results, luteolin was selected as the critical component for further verification. In vitro experiments have shown that luteolin can effectively alleviate adriamycin (ADR)-induced renal tubular apoptosis and suppress AKT and p53 phosphorylation. The effects of luteolin to reduce apoptosis may be mediated by inhibiting oxidative stress and downregulating the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and p53 pathways. In general, we screened and analyzed the possible active components, therapeutic targets and pathways of P. frutescens for treating CKD. Our findings revealed that luteolin can reduce renal tubular epithelial cell apoptosis and may be the critical component of P. frutescens in the treatment of CKD. It provides references and direction for further research."

Therefore, to increase the health value and price of PS and PSM, we focused on the biological effects of perilla seed oil (PSO) and rosmarinic acid-rich fraction (RA-RF) extracted from PSM for their role in preventing oxidative stress and inflammation caused by TNF-α exposure in an A549 lung adenocarcinoma culture model. The A549 cells were pretreated with PSO or RA-RF and followed by TNF-α treatment. We found that PSO and RA-RF were not toxic to TNF-α-induced A549 cells. Both extracts significantly decreased the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in this cell line. The mRNA expression levels of IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, TNF-α, and COX-2 were significantly decreased by the treatment of PSO and RA-RF. The Western blot indicated that the expression of MnSOD, FOXO1, and NF-κB and phosphorylation of JNK were also significantly diminished by PSO and RA-RF treatment. The results demonstrated that PSO and RA-RF act as antioxidants to scavenge TNF-α induced ROS levels, resulting in decreased the expression of MnSOD, FOXO1, NF-κB and JNK signaling pathway in a human lung cell culture exposed to TNF-α.",

To optimize a quick, easy, cheap, effective, rugged, and safe method, the recoveries at each step were evaluated. The steps improved the recoveries of chlorpyrifos, chlorpyrifos oxon, diazinon, diazoxon, and 2-isopropyl-6-methyl-4-pyrimidinol up to 80% or more by removing interferents, but diethyl phosphate was almost lost during the partition procedure, and the 3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridinol recovery was below 65%. Therefore, the compounds were evaluated using different solvent compositions based on a quick polar pesticides method; note that 100% methanol showed acceptable extraction results. The optimized method provided method detection limits ranging from 0.03 to 1.22 ng/g and good linearities (R2  > 0.996). The recovery values were between 82.1 and 113.3%. The intra- and interday reproducibility was evaluated to be within 8.6 and 9.9%, respectively. The method was applied to determine the degradation efficiency of chlorpyrifos and diazinon and their by-products formed during plasma treatment.",

Perilla seed oil (PSO) is a rich source of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids with health promotional effects. However, the effects of PSO on gut microbiota/inflammation and metabolic disturbance in HFD-induced obesity have not been investigated. Therefore, we aimed to compare the effects of different doses of PSO and metformin on gut microbiota/inflammation, and metabolic parameters in HFD-fed rats. METHODS: Thirty-six male Wistar rats were fed either a normal diet or an HFD for 24 weeks. At week 13, HFD-fed rats received either 50, 100, and 500 mg/kg/day of PSO or 300 mg/kg/day metformin for 12 weeks. After 24 weeks, the metabolic parameters, gut microbiota, gut barrier, inflammation, and oxidative stress were determined. RESULTS: HFD-fed rats showed gut dysbiosis, gut barrier disruption with inflammation, increased oxidative stress, metabolic endotoxemia, and insulin resistance. Treatment with PSO and metformin not only effectively attenuated gut dysbiosis, but also improved gut barrier integrity and decreased gut inflammation. PSO also decreased oxidative stress, metabolic endotoxemia, and insulin resistance in HFD-fed rats. Metformin had greater benefits than PSO. CONCLUSION: PSO and metformin had the beneficial effect on attenuating gut inflammation and metabolic disturbance in obese-insulin resistance.",

      "abstract": "Perilla seed oil (PSO) has a special aromatic odor, which is unpleasant to the personal preferences of some consumers. To this end, this article evaluated the differences in volatile organic compounds (VOCs), physicochemical characteristics, and fatty acid composition of PSO treated with ethanol (PSO-EA), activated carbon (PSO-AC), and activated kaolin (PSO-AK). The results showed that in the PSO, PSO-EA, PSO-AC, and PSO-AK samples, the content of linolenic acid, oleic acid, and linoleic acid hardly changed. Among the physicochemical characteristics of the four samples, the color difference between PSO and PSO-EA was greater than the color difference between PSO and PSO-AC, PSO-AK. The three treatment methods had the greatest impact on the PSO peroxide value but had little effect on other indicators. Gas chromatography-ion mobility spectrum results identified 28 known volatiles, of which aldehydes, alkenals, alcohols, ketones, and esters were the main groups. Fingerprint analysis found that PSO had an aromatic odor, which includes 1-hexanol, hexanal, and 2-pentylfuran; the removal effect of ethanol on VOCs in PSO was better than that of activated carbon and activated kaolin. The difference between the four oil samples was found from the strength of the VOCs' signals in a two-dimensional map. From the principal components analysis and the \"nearest neighbor\" fingerprint analysis, it was found that PSO is generally quite different from PSO-EA, PSO-AC, and PSO-AK, while in the \"nearest neighbor\" fingerprint analysis, PSO-AC and PSO-AK are similar in general. In short, PSO will have better applications in the food field. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: Treatment of PSO with ethanol, activated carbon, and activated kaolin is conducive to the comprehensive utilization of edible resources. In this work, ethanol, activated carbon, and activated kaolin were used to remove VOCs in PSO, and PSO-EA, PSO-AC, and PSO-AK were obtained. The perilla seed oil after these three treatment methods was tested for VOCs, physicochemical characteristics, and fatty acid composition. They can meet the needs of more consumers without affecting the fatty acid composition in the PSO, and have broad development prospects.",

Results showed that ultrasonic treatment reduced the particle size, induced the exposure of hydrophobic groups and changes in the secondary structure and tertiary conformation of PPI. However, the molecular weight and the crystalline regions were remained unchanged. Apart from this, ultrasonic treatment improved the solubility, water/oil holding capacity, foaming and emulsifying capacity of PPI. Furthermore, the emulsions prepared by ultrasonic-treated PPI possessed the highest stability, which might be due to the smaller droplets size and reduced droplets attraction by higher proportion of interfacial adsorbed protein. This findings will provide a new insight into the application of ultrasonic to improve the stability of PPI-stabilized emulsions.",

The increased surface hydrophobicity and free sulfhydryl content were observed in DHPM-treated PPI, which may be caused by the comformation changes of PPI. Furthermore, DHPM treatment would not cause the degradation of the main subunits and the variation of crystalline regions in PPI, but enhancing the thermal stability of PPI at 90 MPa and 120 MPa. Functional properties analysis indicated that DHPM treatment at 120 MPa was more effective in improving the solubility, foaming and emulsifying capacities of PPI.

Perilla leaves contain a high concentration of phytochemicals such as perillaldehyde (PA) and rosmarinic acid (RA). The effects of UV-B radiation intensity (0.05-0.2 W m-2, UV-BBE: 0.041-0.083 W m-2), duration (3 or 6 h), and irradiation method (continuous or intermittent) for artificial nocturnal lighting using UV-B fluorescent lamps were evaluated on growth, flowering, and leaf phytochemical concentration in greenhouse-grown perilla. Under continuous UV-B irradiation at 0.1 W m-2 for 3 or 6 h, leaf color changed from red to green and leaf fresh weight decreased, compared with the control treatment. No leaf color change was observed under the 3-h treatment with UV-B radiation at 0.05 W m-2, wherein leaf fresh weight was similar to that of the control. Furthermore, RA concentration under continuous UV-B irradiation at 0.05 W m-2 for 3 h increased two-fold compared to that under control treatment, while PA concentration was not affected by UV-B irradiation. Thus, our data showed that continuous UV-B irradiation at 0.05 W m-2 for 3 h could effectively produce RA-rich perilla leaves without reducing in phenotypic quality or productivity. However, a 6-h intermittent illumination inhibited flowering without altering phytochemical concentration."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: While severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection presents with mild or no symptoms in most cases, a significant number of patients become critically ill. Remdesivir has been approved for the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in several countries, but its use as monotherapy has not substantially lowered mortality rates. Because agents from traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) have been successfully utilized to treat pandemic and endemic diseases, we designed the current study to identify novel anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents from TCM. METHODS: We initially used an antivirus-induced cell death assay to screen a panel of herbal extracts. The inhibition of the viral infection step was investigated through a time-of-drug-addition assay, whereas a plaque reduction assay was carried out to validate the antiviral activity. Direct interaction of the candidate TCM compound with viral particles was assessed using a viral inactivation assay. Finally, the potential synergistic efficacy of remdesivir and the TCM compound was examined with a combination assay. RESULTS: The herbal medicine Perilla leaf extract (PLE, approval number 022427 issued by the Ministry of Health and Welfare, Taiwan) had EC50 of 0.12 ± 0.06 mg/mL against SARS-CoV-2 in Vero E6 cells - with a selectivity index of 40.65. Non-cytotoxic PLE concentrations were capable of blocking viral RNA and protein synthesis. In addition, they significantly decreased virus-induced cytokine release and viral protein/RNA levels in the human lung epithelial cell line Calu-3. PLE inhibited viral replication by inactivating the virion and showed additive-to-synergistic efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 when used in combination with remdesivir. CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrate for the first time that PLE is capable of inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 replication by inactivating the virion. Our data may prompt additional investigation on the clinical usefulness of PLE for preventing or treating COVID-19.",

However, there is still a lack of detailed information concerning the content of phenolic compounds in these leaves. Since some flavonoids were found as a conjugated form, leaves were used untreated or hydrolyzed using β-glucuronidase for analysis. Enzymatic hydrolysis method successfully identified some polyphenols, which have not been reported before. Scutellarin, a flavone glucuronide with a molecular mass similar to that of luteolin 7-O-glucuronide, was present in egoma leaves. Scutellarin was the second most abundant polyphenolic compound, after rosmarinic acid. Egoma leaves at the top of the plant contained a higher amount of rosmarinic acid and scutellarin compared to that in the leaves below. The difference in plant growth stage also influenced the rosmarinic acid and scutellarin contents, while the time of harvesting during the day did rosmarinic acid contents only. This is the first time that scutellarin, a traditional Chinese medicine, widely used for the treatment of cerebrovascular disease, was quantitatively determined in egoma leaves. The present study may help adding value to egoma leaves, developing dietary supplements, functional foods, and cosmetics.",

We recently reported that dietary intake of perilla seed oil (PO), a rich source of α-linolenic acid (LNA, C18:3, ω-3), helps in maintaining good mental health in adults. This study aimed to investigate the impacts of dietary PO intake on cognitive functions and mental health in healthy, elderly Japanese individuals. Seventy-five healthy volunteers aged 64-84 years were randomly divided into two groups: a control group and a PO-administered group. At baseline and at 12 months of intervention, cognitive function, mental health condition, fatty acid profile of the red blood cell plasma membranes (RBC-PM), and serum biochemical parameters were evaluated. Results showed that serum biological antioxidant potential and LNA levels in the RBC-PM at 12 months after the trial were significantly higher in the PO group compared to the control group. Further, both the cognitive function measures, as evaluated by the Frontal Assessment Battery test and the apathy scores, tended to be improved after 12 months in the PO group. Our results demonstrate that dietary PO intake enhances the antioxidant potential and prevents the age-related cognitive and mental decline in healthy elderly individuals by enhancing the blood LNA levels."

In the study, the antiallergic asthma effects of Perilla leaf extract (PLE) were investigated, and the underlying mechanism was also explored. Results showed that PLE treatment significantly attenuated airway inflammation in OVA-induced asthma mice, by ameliorating lung pathological changes, inhibiting recruitment of inflammatory cells in lung tissues and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), decreasing the production of inflammatory cytokines in the BALF, and reducing the level of immunoglobulin in serum. PLE treatment suppressed inflammatory response in antigen-induced rat basophilic leukemia 2H3 (RBL-2H3) cells as well as in OVA-induced human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Furthermore, PLE markedly inhibited the expression and phosphorylation of Syk, NF-κB, PKC, and cPLA2 both in vivo and in vitro. By cotreating with inhibitors (BAY61-3606, Rottlerin, BAY11-7082, and arachidonyl trifluoromethyl ketone) in vitro, results revealed that PLE's antiallergic inflammatory effects were associated with the inhibition of Syk and its downstream signals NF-κB, PKC, and cPLA2. Collectively, the present results suggested that PLE could attenuate allergic inflammation, and its mechanism might be partly mediated through inhibiting the Syk pathway.",

      "abstract": "Skin wound healing is essential for recovery from injury, and delayed or impaired wound healing is a severe therapeutic challenge. Keratinocytes, a major component of the epidermis, play crucial roles in reepithelialization during wound healing including cell proliferation. Recent studies have shown that compounds from natural products have candidates for healing skin injury. Isoegomaketone (IK), isolated from leaves of Perilla frutescens var. crispa (Lamiaceae), has various bioactivities. However, the effect of IK on cutaneous wound healing processes has not been studied yet. In this study, we demonstrated that IK exhibits therapeutic wound healing effects using the human keratinocyte cell line HaCaT. Notably, IK promoted cell proliferation and migration in a dose-dependent manner in vitro, and treatment with 10 μM IK upregulated these processes by approximately 1.5-fold after 24 h compared with the control. IK induced the activation of the MAPK/ERK pathway and cell cycle progression to the S and G2/M phases. Thus, this study demonstrates IK as a potential candidate to upregulate wound healing that may provide therapeutic benefits to patients with delayed wound healing."

      "abstract": "Yes-associated protein (YAP)/WW domain-containing transcription factor (TAZ) is critical for cell proliferation, survival, and self-renewal. It has been shown to play a crucial oncogenic role in many different types of tumors. In this study, we investigated the antitumor effect of the extracts of Perilla frutescens var. acuta (Odash.) Kudo leaves (PLE) on Hippo-YAP/TAZ signaling. PLE induced the phosphorylation of YAP/TAZ, thereby inhibiting their activity. In addition, the treatment suppresses YAP/TAZ transcriptional activity via the dissociation of the YAP/TAZ-TEAD complex. To elucidate the molecular mechanism of PLE in the regulation of YAP activity, we treated WT and cell lines with gene knockout (KO) for Hippo pathway components with PLE. The inhibitory effects of PLE on YAP-TEAD target genes were significantly attenuated in LATS1/2 KO cells. Moreover, we found the antitumor effect of PLE on MDA-MB-231 and BT549, both of which are triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cell lines. PLE reduced the viability of TNBC cells in a dose-dependent manner and induced cell apoptosis. Further, PLE inhibited the migration ability in MDA-MB-231 cells. This ability was weakened in YAP and TEAD-activated clones suggesting that the inhibition of migration by PLE is mainly achieved by regulating YAP activity. Taken together, the results of this study indicate that PLE suppressed cell growth and increased the apoptosis of breast cancer (BC) cells via inactivation of YAP activity in a LATS1/2-dependent manner."

We aimed to investigate analgesic, anti-inflammatory and anti-ulcer activities of PFO and PFO-supplemented soybean milk (PFO-SM) in animal models. Analgesic activity was assessed in acetic acid-induced writhing in mice, while anti-inflammatory activity was performed in ethyl phenylpropiolate (EPP)-induced ear edema and carrageenan-induced hind paw edema in rats. Anti-ulcer effects were conducted in water immersion stress, HCl/ethanol and indomethacin-induced gastric ulcer in rats. Distinctly, PFO, containing 6.96 mg ALA and 2.61 mg LA equivalence/g, did not induce acute toxicity (LD50 > 10 mL/kg) in mice. PFO (2.5 and 5 mL/kg) and PFO-SM (0.05 mL PFO equivalence/kg) inhibited incidences of writhing (16.8, 18.0 and 32.3%, respectively) in acetic acid-induced mice. In addition, topical applications of PFO (0.1 and 1 mL/ear) significantly inhibited EPP-induced ear edema (59.3 and 65.7%, respectively) in rats, while PFO-SM slightly inhibited ear edema (25.9%). However, PFO and PFO-SM did not inhibit carrageenan-induced hind paw edema in rats. Indeed, PFO (2.5 and 5 mL/kg) significantly inhibited gastric ulcers in rats that induced by water immersion stress (92.4 and 96.6%, respectively), HCl/ethanol (74.8 and 73.3%, respectively) and indomethacin (68.8 and 88.9%, respectively), while PFO-SM did not. PFO displayed potent analgesic, anti-inflammatory and anti-ulcer properties, while PFO-SM exerted only analgesic properties. Thus, Thai PFO and its functional drink offer potential benefits in treatment of analgesic, inflammatory diseases and gastric ulcer.",

Perilla leaves extract (PLE) exerted significant therapeutic effect against allergic asthma inflammation through Syk inhibition. But the active chemical ingredients from PLE are complex and unclear, it is difficult to fully elucidate its pharmacological mechanisms. METHODS: A method was established for rapid screening and characterization of active ingredients from PLE that targeted Syk, with which three potential active ingredients were identified. By using OVA-induced allergic asthma mouse model in vivo, OVA-induced human PBMCs inflammation model and DNP-IgE/BSA-induced RBL-2H3 cells model in vitro, the effects and mechanisms of PLE and its active components were evaluated. RESULTS: Using Syk-affinity screening method, roseoside (RosS), vicenin-2 (Vic-2) and rosmarinic acid (RosA) were identified from PLE. In vitro, PLE and its ingredients showed significant inhibitory activities against Syk, with their mixture (Mix, prepared by RosS, Vic-2 and RosA in accordance with their ratio in Syk-conjugated beads bound fraction) showing a stronger inhibitory activity. RosS, Vic-2 and RosA also showed significant effects on allergic asthma, and a synergistic effect of Mix was observed. Moreover, treatment with PLE, RosS, Vic-2, RosA, and Mix significantly inhibited the expression and phosphorylation of Syk, PKC, NF-κB p65, and cPLA2 in allergic mice lung tissue and in RBL-2H3 cells. CONCLUSION: PLE may alleviate allergic airway inflammation partly through the multiple components synergistic targeting on Syk and its downstream inflammatory pathway."

PSM protein was hydrolyzed independently by using five proteases, and their functional and biological properties were analyzed. PSM protein hydrolysate exhibited high solubility at most of the tested pH values, and the trypsin-treated hydrolysate exhibited the highest water and oil absorption capacity. The neutrase-treated hydrolysate was most effective in scavenging the 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazine radicals, whereas the pepsin-treated hydrolysate showed the highest angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitory effect, and anti-inflammatory activity. Trypsin-treated hydrolysate exhibited the highest scavenging activity against of 2,2'-azinobis-(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid radicals with the IC50 of 109.72 µg/mL. The results of the present study suggest that the type of protease used for the treatment significantly influences the functional properties and biological activities of the resulting PSM protein hydrolysates."

      "abstract": "In this study, the influence of in vitro gastrointestinal digestion on the Perilla frutescens leaf extract (PFLE) were measured. Results revealed that total phenolic content (TPC) and total flavonoid content (TFC) were significantly decreased after simulated digestion (ca. 53% of phenolics and 40% of flavonoids). The IC50 value of DPPH· scavenging activity and ABTS+ scavenging ability increased by 23% and 56%, respectively, while ferric reducing antioxidant power reduced by 53%. For the inhibition ability on α-glucosidase, acetylcholinesterase, and MCF-7 cell proliferation, their IC50 values increased by 360%, 197%, and 25%, respectively. Three phenolic acids and one flavonoid in PFLE were quantified by high-performance liquid chromatography. Overall, although significant losses of the active components and biological activities occurred during in vitro gastrointestinal digestion, it still showed the potential as an oral agent for treatment and prevention of oxidative stress, cancer, diabetes, and Alzheimer's disease. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: As an important annual herbaceous plant with rich biochemical compounds and many biological functions, Perilla frutescens leave is widely used in the food and traditional Chinese medicine. However, the dynamic changes of its active compounds and activities during the digestion process are unclear. In this study, the digestion results in significant loss of the active ingredients and biological activities of P. frutescens leaf extract (PFLE), particularly in the gastric digestion. In addition, PFLE remains to show certain antioxidant activity, α-glucosidase inhibitory ability, acetylcholinesterase inhibitory ability, and MCF-7 cell proliferation inhibitory ability after digestion. Therefore, this research might facilitate further research and development of P. frutescens.",

A total of 60 one-day-old chicks of ROSS 308 (initial body weight of 44.8 ± 0.4 g) were randomly allotted to four treatment groups (15 replicate cages with 1 broilers per cage) in a period of 5 weeks. Dietary treatments included control (CON) basal diet (corn-soybean meal-based diets) and test diets in which PSM was included at 0.5% (T1), 1% (T2), or 2% (T3) to gradually replace soybean meal. At the end of experiment, all broilers were slaughtered for collecting breast and thigh meat. At 5 weeks, T2 and T3 treatment groups had higher (p < 0.05) body weights than CON and T1 treatment groups. Weight gain was increased (p < 0.05) in T2 and T3 treatment groups. Feed intake was decreased (p < 0.05) in T3 treatment group. Broilers in T2 treatment group had lower (p < 0.05) feed conversion ratio than those in other treatment groups. In proximate composition of breast meat, there was no significant (p > 0.05) difference in moisture and ash. Fat composition of breast meat was significantly (p < 0.05) increased in T2 and T3 treatment groups. Regarding meat quality, broilers fed T3 diet had higher (p < 0.05) water holding capacity than those fed other diets. Regarding fatty acids composition of thigh meat, broilers fed T3 diet had higher (p < 0.05) linolenic acid than those fed other diets. In conclusion, soybean meal replaced by 2% perilla seed meal in broiler diet can improve growth performance, meat quality, and fatty acids composition of thigh meat in broilers. Perilla seed meal can be a lot of potential alternatives feedstuff for soybean meal in this study."

Male C57BL/6J mice (5 weeks old) were divided into four groups: normal diet, HD, HD supplemented with fish oil (FO), and HD supplemented with PO, and were fed experimental diets for 16 weeks. PO significantly ameliorated (P < .05) the HD-induced colon inflammation as indicated by the increased colon length and low macroscopic score. PO increased the number of Bifidobacteria and reduced the number of Enterobacteriaceae, which in turn resulted in the lowering of endotoxin levels. Proinflammatory cytokines in serum and colon such as interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-α were also decreased by PO treatment. In addition, PO suppressed the expression of cyclooxygenase 2 and inducible nitric oxide, and inhibited the activation of nuclear factor-κB in the colon while increasing the expression of the tight junction protein, Zonula occludens-1. The gene expression of GPR120, a membrane receptor activated by omega-3 fatty acids, was increased in the oil-treated groups. Altogether, PO improved HD-induced colon inflammatory conditions, and the effects were similar to those of FO, confirming that PO is a potential omega-3 fatty acid source for dietary supplements.",

      "abstract": "Perilla oil has been considered to have excellent potential for treating various diseases due to its contents of beneficial fatty acids, such as α-linolenic acid, oleic acid and linoleic acid. The therapeutic effects and molecular mechanism of an α-linolenic acid-enriched cold-pressed perilla oil (LEP) on hepatic steatosis of an obesity model were investigated by analyzing alterations in fat accumulation and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-mediated autophagy, in high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity C57BL/6N mice treated with LEP for 16 weeks. Although no significant alterations were detected in body weight and most organ weights, the liver weight and accumulation of lipid droplets in the liver section were significantly lower in HFD + LEP treated group as compared to the HFD + Vehicle treated group. Reduced mRNA expression levels of adipogenesis and lipogenesis regulating factors, including the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)γ, CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP)α, fatty acid synthase (FAS), and adipocyte fatty acid-binding protein 2 (aP2) were observed after LEP treatment for 16 weeks, while the levels of lipolysis were remarkably increased in the same group. Moreover, the LEP-treated groups showed suppression of ER stress-regulating factors, such as the C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP), eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2α (eIF2α), inositol-requiring protein 1 (IRE1)α, and Jun-N-terminal kinase (JNK) during anti-hepatic steatosis effects. The expression level of the microtubule-associated protein 1A/1B-light chain 3 (LC3) protein and phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT/ mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway for the autophagy response showed a significant decrease in the HFD+LEP-treated group. Furthermore, ER stress-mediated autophagy was accompanied with enhanced phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), JNK, and p38 protein in the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase signaling pathway. Taken together, the results of the present study indicate that treatment with LEP inhibits hepatic steatosis in the HFD-induced obese model through regulation of adipogenesis and lipolysis. We believe our results are the first to show that the anti-hepatic steatosis activity of α-linolenic acid from cold-pressed perilla oil might be tightly correlated with the amelioration of ER stress-mediated autophagy.",

Thai perilla (Perilla frutescens) nutlets are rich in phenolic compounds and flavonoids that exert potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. We found that the ethyl acetate (EA) and ethanol (Eth) extracts of Thai perilla nutlets contain phenolic compounds such as luteolin, apigenin, chryseoriol and their glycosides, which exhibit antioxidant activity. The goal of the present study was to investigate the effects of the extracts on endothelial activation and EMPs generation in tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α)-induced EA.hy926 cells. We found that TNF-α (10 ng/ml) activated EA.hy926 cells and subsequently generated EMPs. Pre-treatment with the extracts significantly attenuated endothelial activation by decreasing the expression of the intracellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) in a dose-dependent manner. Only the Eth extract showed protective effects against overproduction of interleukin-6 (IL-6) in the activated cells. Furthermore, the extracts significantly reduced TNF-α-enhanced EMPs generation in a dose-dependent manner. In conclusion, Thai perilla nutlet extracts, especially the Eth extract, may have potential to protect endothelium against vascular inflammation through the inhibition of endothelial activation and the generation of endothelial microparticles (EMPs).",

Healthy Japanese volunteers aged 30-60 years (n = 60) were randomized to PLP and placebo groups. The PLP group consumed PLP dried using a microwave under reduced pressure, and the placebo group consumed pectin fiber daily for 6 months. Home blood pressure, serum biochemical parameters, and fatty acid profiles of erythrocyte plasma membranes were analyzed. Plasma Ox-LDL levels significantly decreased in the PLP group but not in the placebo group. Mean changes in the biological antioxidant potential and alpha-linolenic acid levels in the erythrocyte plasma membrane were significantly increased in the PLP group than in the placebo group. In subjects with prehypertension (systolic blood pressure [SBP] ³ 120 mmHg), the mean reduction in morning or nocturnal SBP was significantly greater in the PLP group than in the placebo group.

      "abstract": "Perilla oil (PO), rich in α-linolenic acid (LNA, C18:3, ω-3), is increasingly alleged to have numerous health benefits in humans. However, the current reports detailing the effects of PO on human mental health are not adequate. Therefore, in the current investigation we compared the effects of PO or placebo treatment on the mental condition of healthy adult Japanese volunteers. At baseline and after 12 months of treatment, mental health condition was assessed using the Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS) and Apathy Scale, and serum biochemical parameters were determined. From baseline to 12 months of intervention, both SDS depression and apathy scores improved significantly in the PO-administered group. Compared to those of control group, serum norepinephrine and serotonin levels after 12 months decreased in the PO-administered group. The enhanced mental state observed in PO-subjects was accompanied by LNA level increases in erythrocyte plasma membranes. Our data demonstrate that PO intake enhances blood LNA levels and may maintain healthy mental conditions in adult subjects."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: In Western countries functional dyspepsia (FD) has a prevalence of 10-20% among adults and although many drugs are currently available for use within clinical practice, FD remains an important challenge for physicians. Recently, food supplements that are ginger-based, along with other botanicals, have been proposed to be a possible natural alternative to pharmaceutical drugs to empirically counteract the symptoms of FD. METHODS: We have therefore retrospectively analyzed the efficacy and safety profiles of a nutraceutical containing, in addition to a highly standardized ginger root extract, a multi-fractionated botanical obtained from Perilla frutescens leaf containing an innovative bouquet of compounds, including hydrophilic polyphenols and the lipophilic terpenoid perilla ketone. RESULTS: The results of our single-group study, obtained from patients with a diagnosis of FD who were treated with the perilla/ginger nutraceutical, demonstrated a good efficacy profile, with a significant reduction observed in nearly all evaluated symptoms (epigastric pain, heartburn, gastric reflux, nausea, borborygmi, early satiety, diarrhea/constipation) starting from the first week of treatment that was further improved after 2 weeks. The treatment was well tolerated with very mild side effects (flatulence, meteorism, gastric burning, difficulty in falling asleep) lasting 3-4 days, which disappeared without stopping the treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Despite all the limitations of our pragmatic study, we believe that the perilla and ginger supplement we have used can be considered a valid tool for an empirical approach to treating patients with FD, especially when a non-conventional drug treatment is preferable to the patient and considered suitable by the physician.",

We examined the effect of PL, RG, and PF (PRP), a most effective herbal formula deduced from constitutive ingredient herbs of Antai Yin which is composed of PRP, on the leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) expression and endometrial receptivity. RESULTS: The combination of the extracts from PRP induced the LIF expression in Ishikawa cells and increased the adhesion between Ishikawa and JAr cells. In addition, PRP-induced attachment of JAr cells onto Ishikawa cells and expression of adhesion molecules, ITGAV, ITGB5, CD44s, and L-selectin, are significantly reduced by knock-down of LIF expression. CONCLUSION: Induced by the combination of the PRP extracts, the adhesion between trophoblast and endometrial cells are mediated by expression of LIF and adhesion molecules. Thus, we suggest the combination of the PRP extracts may be a novel therapy for enhancing embryo implantation rate.",

In DSS-treated mice, dietary supplementation with PL mitigated DAI and colon shortening. The dietary PL also reduced colonic levels of inflammatory and angiogenic mediators, such as interleukin-1β, interleukin-6, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, macrophage inflammatory protein-2, leukotriene B4, inducible nitric oxide synthase, cyclooxygenase-2, basic fibroblast growth factor, and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1). Treatment of HUVEC with ethanol extract of PL attenuated LPS-stimulated increases in ICAM-1 levels, monocyte adhesion, invasion, and tube formation. This study suggests that dietary PL effectively inhibited DSS-induced acute colitis in mice, and its anti-angiogenic activities may partially contribute to the inhibition."

In this study, the protective effects of USM on UVB-induced skin aging were investigated in Hs68 cells. UVB irradiation decreased cell viability by 26% compared to the control. However, USM blocked UVB-induced cytotoxicity. Moreover, USM treatment significantly decreased the UVB-induced production of reactive oxygen species and attenuated the UVB-induced production and mRNA expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) by inhibiting the phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinases and activator protein 1 (AP-1). Furthermore, UVB exposure led to a 49.4% reduction in collagen synthesis. However, USM treatment restored collagen synthesis through upregulation of the transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β)/Smad2/3 pathways. These data indicate that USM regulates the production of MMPs and collagen by modulation of the TGF-β/Smad pathway and AP-1 activity, suggesting that USM may be a useful anti-photoaging ingredient."

Animals were randomly divided into four groups: control, CAIA, CAIA + SFE-M (100 mg/kg/day), and CAIA + SFE-W (100 mg/kg/day). The mice were subjected to the respective treatments via oral gavage once daily for 4 days. Mice treated with SFE-M developed less severe arthritis than the CAIA mice. They showed significantly improved arthritic score, paw volume, and paw thickness compared to the CAIA mice from days 3 through 7. Furthermore, histopathological analysis of ankle for inflammation showed that SFE-M treatment reduced inflammatory cell infiltration and edema formation. Similarly, the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) in the whole blood was 37% lower in mice treated with SFE-M compared with the CAIA mice. However, treatment with SFE-W did not result in any significant difference compared with the CAIA group. In conclusion, SFE-M treatment delays the onset of arthritis and alleviates its clinical manifestations in CAIA mice.",

The type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) model was successfully established using a high-fat and high-sugar diet combined with a single low-dose of streptozocin (STZ). PerO intervention reduced the levels of fasting blood glucose and the level, size and accumulation of lipid droplets, increased the insulin level and diminished the body weight loss. PerO pretreatment markedly promoted the serum levels of alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase alanine (AST) and inhibited the levels of glucose (GLU), glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD), triglycerides (TGs) and total cholesterol (TC). Moreover, PerO treatment enhanced the expression of phosphoinositide-3 kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (AKT) and activated the expression of glucose transporter 4 (Glut4) and phospho-AKT serine/threonine kinase (p-AS160) in the liver. Additionally, PerO treatment distinctly decreased the abundance of Aerococcus and facilitated the richness of Alloprevotella in the intestine, as well as accelerated the restoration of the gut microflora diversity. Thus, PerO regulates intestinal microbiota and alleviates insulin resistance through the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway in type-2 diabetic KKAy mice and may be a potential functional food for diabetic treatment.",

Gellan gum derivatives may enhance plant growth and development, but have never been used under stress conditions. Perilla (Perilla frutescens, Lamiaceae) is a source of valuable bioproducts for the pharmaceutical, cosmetic, and food industries. However, there is not much information on the use of biostimulators in perilla cultivation. In this work we investigated the effects of oligo-gellan and salt (100 mM NaCl) on the yield and quality of red perilla (P. frutescens var. crispa f. purpurea) leaves. Plants grown under stress showed inhibited growth, smaller biomass, their leaves contained less nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, total polyphenol and total anthocyanins, and accumulated considerably more sodium than control plants. Treatment with oligo-gellan under non-saline conditions stimulated plant growth and the fresh weight content of the above-ground parts, enhanced the accumulation of nitrogen, potassium, magnesium and total polyphenols, and increased antioxidant activity as assessed by DPPH and ABTS assays. Oligo-gellan applied under saline conditions clearly alleviated the stress effects by limiting the loss of biomass, macronutrients, and total polyphenols. Additionally, plants pretreated with oligo-gellan and then exposed to 100 mM NaCl accumulated less sodium, produced greater amounts of photosynthetic pigments, and had greater antioxidant activity than NaCl-stressed plants. Irrespective of the experimental treatment, 50% extract effectively inhibited growth of Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus. Both microorganisms were the least affected by 25% extract obtained from plants untreated with either NaCl or oligo-gellan. In conclusion, oligo-gellan promoted plant growth and enhanced the quality of red perilla leaves and efficiently alleviated the negative effects of salt stress.",

In particular, exposure to UV-A is a major cause of photoaging. We have previously isolated 2',3'-dihydroxy-4',6'-dimethoxychalcone (DDC) from green perilla leaves as an activator of the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor-2 (Nrf2)-antioxidant response element (ARE) and demonstrated the protective effects of DDC both in vitro and in vivo in PC12 cells and Parkinson's disease models, respectively. In this study, we used HaCaT cells to examine the effects of DDC on ROS production and cell damage induced by UV-A. Our results indicated that UV-A irradiation in HaCaT cells increased ROS production in an energy-dependent manner. In addition, cell viability decreased in an energy-dependent manner 24 h after UV-A irradiation. However, treatment with DDC 24 h prior to UV-A irradiation significantly suppressed UV-A radiation-induced ROS production. In addition, DDC showed cytoprotective effects when used 24 h before and after UV-A irradiation. Treatment with DDC for 24 h also increased the expression levels of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) in a concentration-dependent manner. Pretreatment with the HO-1 inhibitor followed by DDC treatment before UV-A irradiation for 24 h reduced ROS production and the cytoprotective effect. These results suggest that DDC increases the expression levels of HO-1 and protects HaCaT cells through the suppression of UV radiation-induced ROS production.",

We have previously reported that 2',3'-dihydroxy-4',6'-dimethoxychalcone (DDC), a component of green perilla, enhances cellular resistance to oxidative damage through the activation of the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)-antioxidant response element (ARE) pathway. Here, we investigated the effects of DDC on cortical neuronal death induced by Aβ. When Aβ and DDC had been preincubated for 3 h, the aggregation of Aβ was significantly suppressed. In this condition, we found that DDC provided a neuroprotective action on Aβ-induced cytotoxicity. Treatment with DDC for 24 h increased the expression of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), and this was controlled by the activation of the Nrf2-ARE pathway. However, DDC did not affect Aβ-induced neuronal death under any of these conditions. These results suggest that DDC prevents the aggregation of Aβ and inhibits neuronal death induced by Aβ, and although it activates the Nrf2-ARE pathway, this mechanism is less involved its neuroprotective effect.",

      "abstract": "Perilla oil (PO) and linseed oil (LO) are very rich in nutrients and have great potential market value. Using the Cremophor RH40-Span80 preparation system to make a perilla oil nanoemulsion (PON) or linseed oil nanoemulsion (LON) can improve the bioavailability and stability of these oils. The effect of different reaction conditions on the stability of the emulsion was investigated. The results showed that the PON and LON have good stability at pH ≥ 7, different storage temperatures (4 °C, 25 °C, 37 °C and 55 °C) and different NaCl concentrations (0, 2, 4, 6, 8 M). Meanwhile, it was found that the content of the lipid peroxidation product malondialdehyde (MDA) in the nanoemulsion did not change significantly over 7 days, further demonstrating the stability of the nanoemulsion. Through anti-inflammatory and antibacterial tests, it was found that the PON and LON have an effective inhibitory effect on inflammation; moreover, the PON inhibits the growth of Escherichia coli, Salmonella enteritidis and Pseudomonas tolaasii, and the LON has an inhibitory effect on Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas tolaasii (inhibition zone > 10 mm). In addition, we found that there were no pathological differences in the heart, liver, spleen and kidney of Kunming mice between the PO and PON groups and the LO and LON groups. Furthermore, after intraperitoneal injection of P 407 into mice, the comparison between PON and PO and between LON and LO showed that the blood lipid levels of the mice in the PON and LON treatment groups increased, indicating that the absorption capacity of the small intestine of the mice for the PON and LON was enhanced. Therefore, the preparation of the PON and LON has good development prospects and opens up opportunities in the development of the food industry."

      "abstract": "With a complex etiology involving multiple factors, the condition known as itch is a primary symptom of many skin diseases. Current treatment methods are ineffective for addressing itches caused by dry skin, for example. We developed a botanical extract, ACTPER, made from a mixture of Actinidia arguta and Perilla frutescens, which have traditionally been used to treat itch. The quality of ACTPER as a research agent was controlled in our experiment by cell-based bioassays, as well as by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), using two chemical markers. In the acetone-induced dry skin mice model, the oral administration of ACTPER alleviated dry skin-related skin properties and itching behavior. The RNA and protein expression of the filament aggregating protein (filaggrin) gene, a key factor involved in the regulation of skin barrier function, was significantly increased, as measured by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and immunofluorescence assay. To understand the underlying mechanism(s) at the molecular level, HaCaT cells, a human keratinocyte-derived cell line, were treated with various concentrations of ACTPER. We found that the protein expression of filaggrin was indeed upregulated by ACTPER in a dose dependent manner. Data from experiments involving the reporter plasmid containing the xenobiotic response element (XRE), and the chemical antagonist for the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), indicated that the ACTPER-mediated upregulation of filaggrin was controlled through the activation of the AhR signaling pathway. The molecular docking simulation study predicted that ACTPER might contain chemical compounds that bind directly to AhR. Taken together, our results suggest that ACTPER may provide the platform, based upon which a variety of safe and effective therapeutic agents can be developed to treat itch.",

The functional group composition, morphology, and pH stability of the synthesized CQDs were systematically investigated. And based on fluorescence quenching of CQDs, the as-prepared CQDs were innovatively developed as an effective \"signal-off\" fluorescent probe for selective and sensitive detection of silver ion (Ag+) with two linear ranges of 0-10 and 10-3000 nM, and a detection limit 1.4 nM. The specificity and selectivity of this fluorescent probe were also verified through challenging the detection by using similarmetallic cations or in real water samples. In addition, the as-prepared CQDs exhibit a low cytotoxicity and a good biocompatibility, revealing its potential bioimaging applications in living cells."

Fluxapyroxad was diluted 2,000-fold and penthiopyrad was diluted 4,000-fold. Each solution was sprayed 3 times onto crops at 7-d intervals before harvest. Leaf samples were collected at 3 h (0 d), 1, 3, 5 and 7 d after the third and final treatment. The recovery ranges of fluxapyroxad and penthiopyrad and their metabolites were 74.2%-104.1%. Pesticide residue analyses indicated that fluxapyroxad and penthiopyrad residues in perilla leaves dissipated over time. The persistence of fluxapyroxad and penthiopyrad residues 7 d after the final spray were 50.0% ± 4.9% and 44.2% ± 2.8% of those measured 3 h (0 d) after the final spray, respectively. The percent acceptable daily intake (%ADI)-which was assessed according to the daily food intake by Koreans according to age-was < 7.3%. Therefore, it was determined that the health risk was low. The perception that residual pesticides are present in large amounts in perilla leaf has led to consumer concern. However, in this study, the amounts of pesticide in perilla leaf decreased over time. Although it has been hypothesized that the risk of pesticide intake would be higher in younger children, the results actually suggest the opposite. Therefore, the pesticides in question are considered to be safe for use on perilla leaves.",

We have previously reported that the PF sprout extract (PFSE) is effective in treating hyperglycemia. However, the role of PFSE on glomerular mesangial cells (MCs) proliferation and the extracellular matrix (ECM) accumulation in a diabetic condition are still unclear. Therefore, in this study, we have investigated the role of PFSE on cell proliferation and ECM accumulation in murine glomerular MCs (MMCs), cultured under a high glucose (HG) condition. PFSE treatment attenuated HG-induced MMCs proliferation and hypertrophy. Moreover, the HG-induced ECM protein, collagen IV and fibronectin, overexpression was abolished by the PFFSE treatment. In addition, PFSE inhibited reactive oxygen species (ROS) overproduction and NOX2 and NOX4 expression in MMCs under a HG condition. Our data further revealed the involvement of mesangial cell damage in AMP-activated kinase (AMPK) activation. PFSE strongly activated AMPK in MMCs under hyperglycemic conditions. These results suggest that PFSE inhibits HG-medicated MC fibrosis through suppressing the activation of NOX2/4 and the AMPK activation mechanism. PFSE may be useful for the prevention or treatment of diabetic nephropathy.",

This study aimed to investigate the toxicity profile of Perilla seed oil (PSO), which is the main constituent of Perilla seeds in rodents and Beagle dogs. No significant treatment-associated toxicity or mortality was observed at PSO dosages of up to 50 g/kg and 20 g/kg in KM mice and Wistar rats, respectively, suggesting that PSO was well tolerated by the experimental rodents. Sub-chronic oral toxicity of PSO was studied in dogs at doses of 3, 6 and 12 g/kg/d for 90 days followed by a 30 day recovery period. The results indicated that the body weight increased in all-dose groups more than control group, typical of animals on diets rich in fatty acids. Treatment-related side effects, including changes in hematology and serum biochemistry parameters, histopathology of liver and lymph glands, were observed in the high and moderate-dose dogs. However, these changes disappeared after the doses were withdrawn during the recovery period, except for alteration of liver in the high-dose group. In conclusion, the \"no observed adverse effect level\" (NOAEL) of oral administration of PSO for 90 days in Beagle dogs was considered to be 3 g/kg/d.",

We investigate neuroprotective effects of perilla seed oil as an additional treatment in patients with mild to moderate dementia. METHOD: A double-blind, randomized-control trial (perilla seed oil versus placebo) in patients with mild to moderate dementia was conducted. Perilla seed oil or placebo was added on with standard treatment for six months. Cognitive function was compared at nine months after enrollment. RESULT: 182 patients, with 94 in the experimental group and 88 in the placebo group, were able to complete the study. Cognitive function is not significantly different compared between groups. However, the total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol were significantly lower in the experimental group. Perilla seed oil had no adverse effect to kidney, liver, blood components or glucose metabolism. CONCLUSION: Perilla seed oil as additional neuroprotective therapy in patients with mild to moderate dementia does not improve cognitive function. Perilla seed oil significantly reduced total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol. A clinical trial is needed to prove the benefit of cholesterol-lowering effects with perilla seed oil in human.",

We investigated the effect of perilla oil on obesity-induced hepatic and vascular changes in high-fat diet (HFD)-fed mice and provided underlying mechanisms for potential therapeutic applications. Tomato and paprika extract was added to prevent the oxidation during storage of perilla oil. HFD-fed mice were orally administered palm or perilla oil for 90 days. Food intake, body and liver weight, and serum cholesterol levels were measured. Arterial and hepatic lipid accumulation was determined by histological staining. Hepatic triglyceride levels and the expression of proteins regulating lipid metabolism were analyzed. Food intake and body weight were not different between palm oil-treated and perilla oil-treated mice. Serum cholesterol level was significantly lower in perilla oil-treated mice compared with palm oil-treated mice. HFD-induced lipid accumulation was also lower in thoracic aorta and liver by perilla oil compared with palm oil. Perilla oil also decreased hepatic triglyceride level without changing the liver weight. Perilla oil treatment increased the AMP-activated protein kinase and acetyl-CoA carboxylase phosphorylation and the lipolytic protein levels, whereas it decreased the lipogenic protein levels in the liver. In conclusion, perilla oil reduced serum cholesterol and arterial and hepatic lipid accumulation in HFD-fed mice. The data suggest that perilla oil improves the balance of lipogenic and lipolytic protein expression, and ameliorates obesity-induced metabolic disorders and cardiovascular diseases.",

In this study, the antiobesity effect of PE was studied in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes and C57BL/6J mice fed high-fat diets. Triglyceride quantification and Oil Red O staining in matured adipocytes revealed that PE reduced lipid accumulation in differentiated adipocytes by downregulating adipogenic gene and upregulating lipolytic gene expressions. Mice were fed normal diet, high-fat diet and high-fat diet supplemented with different concentrations of PE. Treatment with PE significantly prevented body weight gain, improved serum lipids, hepatic lipids and reduced the epididymal fat. Furthermore, in the adipose tissue and liver, expression of genes related to lipolysis and fatty acid β-oxidation were upregulated in PE- treated mice. Thus, our results suggested that PE has antiobesity effects in rodents and can be effective in obesity management. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: Purple perilla, rich in polyphenols such as rosmarinic acid, showed lipid lowering in adipocyte cells and prevented body weight gain in mice. Therefore we conclude that purple perilla may be a potential candidate for the development of functional foods or nutraceuticals in managing obesity in humans.",

Oxidative stress plays a major role in the neurodegenerative cascade, leading to the irreversible mechanism in dementia. Perilla seed oil is extracted from its seeds and contains a high source of antioxidative substances such as omega-3 fatty acid. With its prominent antioxidative property, perilla seed oil demonstrates neuroprotective effects against dementia in preclinical studies. We aim to prove the feasibility and safety of perilla seed oil as an additional antioxidative therapy in patients with dementia. This single-centered, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial randomized 239 patients with clinical diagnosis of mild to moderate dementia according to the Thai Mini-Mental State Examination (TMSE) score of 10 to 23 or the Thai Montreal Cognitive Assessment score of 12 to 25. Either two capsules containing 500 milligrams of perilla seed oil or similarly appearing two capsules containing 500 milligrams of olive oil (placebo) four times daily was added to conventional standard treatment of dementia for six months. Clinical side effects and routine laboratory results at baseline and after treatment were compared between both groups. Nausea and vomiting were the most common clinical side effects (3%) found equally in both groups. Three patients in the placebo group prematurely discontinued the medication, while only one patient in the treatment group quit the medication early. However, about 5% of patients in both groups could not comply with the regimen of the treatment. The routine laboratory results, including complete blood counts, kidney function tests, and liver function panels, at baseline and after treatment, were not significantly different in both groups. In conclusion, perilla seed oil was feasible and safe to add on with standard treatment in patients with mild to moderate dementia. Further study is needed to confirm its benefit to use as additional antioxidative therapy in patients with dementia."

      "abstract": "Perilla seed protein (PSP) was extracted from defatted perilla seed meal and applied in oil-in-water (O/W) emulsions as an emulsifier. We investigated the influences of protein concentration (0.25⁻1.5 wt %), pH (3.0⁻9.0), NaCl concentration (0⁻350 mmol/L) and thermal treatment (70⁻90 °C, 30 min) on the physical characteristics of O/W emulsions, including volume-average diameter, ζ-potential, interfacial protein concentration, microstructure and so on. Results showed that increasing PSP concentration would decrease the d4,3 and a 1.0 wt % PSP concentration was sufficient to ensure the stability of emulsion. Under pH 3.0⁻9.0, emulsions were stable except at pH 3.0⁻5.0 which was proximal to the isoelectric point (pH 4.5) of PSP. At high NaCl concentrations (250⁻350 mmol/L), the emulsions exhibited relatively lower absolute ζ-potential values and a large number of aggregated droplets. A moderate thermal treatment temperature (e.g., 70 °C) was favorable for the emulsion against aggregation and creaming. However, when 90 °C thermal treatment was performed, a clear layer separation was observed after 2 weeks storage and the emulsion showed a poor stability. The findings of this work are of great importance for the utilization and development of PSP as an emulsifier for food emulsions.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Current evidence supports that inflammatory reaction in the hippocampus is a potential cause of major depressive disorder (MDD). Perilla aldehyde (PAH), a major constituent from Perilla frutescens, has been reported to have anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant activity. The aim of this study is to explore the antidepressant-like effect and the underlying mechanism of PAH on the rats model induced by chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS). METHODS: CUMS rats model was built to tested their depressive-like behaviors. The levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines were tested. Proteins were analyzed by Western blot and Immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: We found that treatment with PAH (20, 40 mg/kg) and fluoxetine (FLU, 10 mg/kg) significantly improved the sucrose consumption, immobility time in forced swim test (FST), as well as locomotor activity in open-field test (OFT). The levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in hippocampus were also suppressed effectively by PAH and FLU administration. Western blot analysis showed the up-regulated levels of TXNIP, NLRP3, Cleaved caspase-1 and p-NF-κB p65 in the hippocampus in rats exposed to CUMS paradigm, while different degrees of down-regulation in their expression were detected after PAH (20, 40 mg/kg) and FLU (10 mg/kg) treatment respectively. The results from histopathological examination further demonstrated that PAH (20, 40 mg/kg) and FLU (10 mg/kg) treatment reversed the alteration of TRX, NLRP3 and Cleaved caspase-1 induced by CUMS procedure. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrated that PAH exhibited antidepressant-like effect in CUMS-induced rats model of depression, which might be mediated by TXNIP/TRX/NLRP3 pathway.",

      "abstract": "This study was carried out to evaluate the neuroprotective activity of polysaccharide extracts isolated from Perilla frutescens (PEPF) in H2O2-treated HT22 hippocampus cells. The PEPF treatment was found to increase the anti-oxidant activities of HT22 hippocampus cells. PEPF treatment resulted in a significant protection of HT22 hippocampus cells against H2O2-induced neurotoxicity, this protection ultimately occurred through an inhibition of ROS-mediated intracellular Ca2+ levels leading to MAPKs and NF-κB, as well as the accumulation of PI3K/AKT and Nrf2-mediated HO-1/NQO1 pathways. Furthermore, PEPF not only decreased the expression of Bax, cytochrome c, and cleaved caspases-3, -8, and -9, but also increased the expression of PARP and Bcl-2 in the H2O2-treated HT22 hippocampus cells, which overall contributed to the neuroprotective action. PEPF retains its mitochondrial membrane potential and reduces the elevated levels of sub-G1 phase and apoptotic morphological features induced by H2O2. It also reduces the malondialdehyde levels and enhances the intracellular SOD activity.",
