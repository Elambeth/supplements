      "abstract": "Osteoarthritis (OA) is a chronic degenerative musculoskeletal condition associated with progressive loss of hyaline cartilage, subchondral bone remodelling, and inflammation. Despite ongoing research, no United States Food and Drug administration (USFDA) approved drugs for OA are available. The current investigation explores the potential of glucosamine sulphate endorsed ibuprofen nanocrystals loaded polymeric gel (IBU-GS-NCs gel) for its anti-inflammatory and disease-modifying capabilities in the osteoarthritic rat model. IBU-GS-NCs were engineered by using the anti-solvent precipitation method that later exhibited particle size 34.57 ± 0.79 nm, zeta (ζ) potential -2.81 ± 0.6 mV, and drug content 7.05 ± 0.19 %. On the other hand, IBU-GS-NCs gel demonstrated 0.507 ± 0.029 % drug loading with spreadability and viscosity close to marketed diclofenac emulgel. Next, the amount of IBU infused through the rat skin in ex vivo permeation study from IBU-GS-NCs gel and IBU gel was calculated to be 479.59 ± 6.28 µg/cm2 and 255.91 ± 4.44 µg/cm2, respectively after 24 h with 1.87-fold increment. Steady-state flux and permeability coefficient for IBU-GS-NCs gel through rat skin were 31.70 ± 0.11 µg/cm2h and 63.41 ± 0.23×10-3 cm/h, respectively. In contrast to the positive control, the representative radiograph for IBU-GS-NCs gel-treated osteoarthritic rats indicated regeneration of articular cartilage with the absence of osteophytes. Histological evaluation of IBU-GS-NCs gel illustrated marked recovery in articulate cartilage thickness as well as glycosaminoglycan (GAG) level. Western blot analysis for synovial tissue of positive control displayed a 9.01, 2.66, 2.51 and 5.75-fold increase in COX-2, TNF-α, and IL-1β, Col2a1 respectively as compared to normal control. In contrast, IBU-GS-NCs gel-treated rats demonstrated 6.28, 4.06, 2.81 and 5.54-fold reduction in COX-2, TNF-α, IL-1β, and Col2a1 respectively compared to positive control. These findings advocate for improved anti-inflammatory and cartilage protective potential of IBU-GS-NCs gel. In conclusion, IBU-GS-NCs gel may be a potential candidate for translating into a clinically viable product to offer effective treatment for knee OA."

      "abstract": "Mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS) types III A and C are inherited neurodegenerative disorders resulting from the lack of a specific enzyme involved in heparan sulfate (HS) catabolism, leading to the accumulation of partially-degraded HS fragments. At present, there are no approved treatments and death is commonly in the second decade of life. Several therapies have undergone pre-clinical evaluation for these conditions, including substrate reduction therapy, with the most studied compound of this class being the isoflavone genistein. However, findings from a Phase III clinical trial demonstrated that high dose oral genistein did not significantly improve neurodevelopmental outcomes in patients with MPS III (Sanfilippo syndrome). Here, we have tested an N-acetylglucosamine analogue, 4-deoxy-N-acetylglucosamine peracetate, as a novel substrate reduction therapy for HS-storing lysosomal storage disorders such as MPS III. Treatment with this compound significantly reduced HS levels in cultured MPS IIIA patient and mouse fibroblasts in a time- and dose-dependent manner. MPS IIIC Drosophila fed 4-deoxy-N-acetylglucosamine peracetate contained significantly less HS relative to those raised on control diets. Likewise, improvements in HS load within the MPS IIIA mouse brain suggests that the compound crossed the blood-brain barrier after oral administration. Although long-term studies are needed, these findings indicate that 4-deoxy-GlcNAc peracetate may be beneficial in slowing the accumulation of HS and may represent a novel substrate reduction therapeutic for MPS III and potentially other HS-storing disorders."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic disease that requires pharmacological therapy to achieve remission. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of glucosamine selenium (GASe) on chronic colitis and reveal the underlying regulatory mechanisms. METHODS: We evaluated the cumulative toxicity of GASe by gavage in mice for 40 days. Dextran sulfate sodium (DSS; 2.5%) was added to drinking water to induce chronic colitis, and GASe was administered to mice with chronic DSS colitis. 16S rRNA sequencing was performed to investigate the influence of GASe on gut microbiota, followed by diversity and LDA Effect Size (LEfSe) analyses. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) associated with chronic DSS colitis were identified based on the expression profiling from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database and were subjected to functional enrichment analysis. Next, the effects of GASe on pyroptosis and chemokine signaling pathways were studied in vitro and in vivo. RESULTS: GASe had no significant toxicity in mice, and administration of low-GASe and high-GASe increased the length of the colon, inhibited the expression of IL-12, IL-6, and TNF-α, and improved colonic tissue structure. Low-GASe improved the diversity of the gut microbiota and mainly affected the Burkholderiaceae family, Paenalcaligenes genus, and Erysipelatoclostridium genus. Low-GASe and high-GASe suppressed the pyroptosis-related proteins NLRP3, GSDMD, and caspase-1. Furthermore, we identified 114 DEGs from the GSE87466 and GSE53306 datasets and these DEGs were mainly enriched in the chemokine signaling pathway and some inflammatory pathways. Further experiments showed that administration of GASe inhibited the chemokine signaling pathway in chronic DSS colitis mice and NCM460 cells. DISCUSSION: This study reveals abnormalities in the gut microbiota, pyroptosis, and chemokine signaling pathways involved in chronic colitis and may provide GASe as an alternative supplement for chronic colitis management."

      "abstract": "Cancer, ranking just below cardiovascular diseases, is a leading cause of mortality worldwide. The key to enhancing survival rates among cancer patients lies in the early detection, removal, and treatment of tumors. However, the broad-spectrum nature of current treatments, including chemotherapy and radiation therapy, results in significant collateral damage to healthy cells and tissues. In this context, hyperbranched polymers present a promising avenue for more targeted therapy. These polymers can be loaded with chemotherapeutic drugs and modified with specific ligands to selectively target cancer cells via glucose transporters, which are overexpressed in many cancer types. To enhance the delivery of drugs to cancer cells, we have engineered an N-acetyl glucosamine conjugated version of this polymer. The characterization of these nanocarriers was evaluated using various techniques, including 1H NMR, dynamic light scattering, and FTIR spectroscopy. Additionally, confocal microscopy was utilized to compare the accumulation of doxorubicin in cancer cells using both the N-acetyl glucosamine-conjugated and unmodified versions of H40 Boltorn™. Our observations indicated a superior accumulation of doxorubicin in cells treated with the modified H40 polymer. Further evaluation of the drug-loaded nanocarriers was conducted on MDA-MB-231 and 4T1 breast cancer cell lines, focusing on their cytotoxic effects. This suggests that the targeted delivery of anticancer drugs using the modified H40 Boltorn™ nanocarriers significantly enhances the ability to kill breast cancer cells, offering a more efficient and selective approach to chemotherapy that minimizes impact on healthy tissues and cells."

      "abstract": "To explore the therapeutic efficacy of L-glutamine (L-Gln) on pathological progression and clinical symptoms of osteoarthritis (OA), and compare with glucosamine sulfate (GS), and celecoxib (CXB). Rats were administered sodium chloride, L-Gln, GS, or CXB via gavage for eight weeks starting from the fifth week after sham operation or Anterior Cruciate Ligament Transection (ACLT) + Medial Meniscectomy (MMx). Then the severity of knee OA in rats was evaluated by serological analysis, histological examination and imaging examination. In addition, patients with mild primary OA were administered L-Gln, GS, or CXB orally for 12 weeks in accordance with the randomization principle. The efficacy end points were the change from baseline to week 24 in the pain and physical function subscale scores of the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities OA Index (WOMAC), and Lequesne score. Treatment with L-Gln alleviated the increased concentration of serum cartilage degradation markers caused by OA in rats. Histological tests showed improvement in knee joint cartilage destruction after treatment. Three-dimensional CT scans and reconstructions revealed a reduction in osteophyte formation and subchondral bone loss. L-glutamine performed as well as or better than glucosamine sulfate and celecoxib in all comparative measures among the three treatment groups. In clinical trials, the WOMAC pain and physical function subscale scores, as well as the Lequesne score, decreased from baseline in all three patient groups during follow-up, with no significant differences observed between the groups. Our research indicates that L-Gln is comparable to GS and CXB in improving the pathological progression and clinical efficacy of OA, which makes it a promising drug for the treatment of osteoarthritis.",

METHODS: Present study utilized inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) to adjust for confounders in this cohort study. Participants were classified based on glucosamine use, and primary and secondary outcomes included all-cause mortality, liver cirrhosis, cardiovascular disease, cerebrovascular disease, and chronic kidney disease (CKD) incidences. Cox proportional hazards models were used to assess hazard ratios and 95 % confidence intervals. RESULTS: We found that glucosamine significantly reduces all-cause mortality in MASLD and MetALD cohorts after IPTW adjustment (P < 0.001). Additionally, glucosamine use was associated with lower liver cirrhosis incidence in MASLD both before (P = 0.003) and after IPTW adjustment (P = 0.046). Glucosamine also decreased cardiovascular disease risk in MASLD (P < 0.001) and MetALD (P = 0.037) cohorts, though it showed no significant impact on cerebrovascular disease incidence. Furthermore, glucosamine use was associated with a significantly lower incidence of CKD in the MASLD cohort (P = 0.034) and the entire cohort (P = 0.030), but not in the No steatotic liver disease cohort or MetALD cohort. CONCLUSION: The findings suggest that glucosamine could be a beneficial supplementary therapy for managing steatotic liver diseases, particularly for patients at high risk for cardiovascular and renal complications. Further clinical trials are required to validate these potential benefits.",

      "abstract": "Although glucosamine (GlcN) exhibits antitumor effects, its mechanism of action remains controversial. Additionally, its impact on hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is not well understood. This study aimed to investigate the antitumor effects of GlcN and its underlying mechanism in a mouse HCC cell line, Hepa1-6. GlcN treatment significantly inhibited Hepa1-6 cell proliferation. Gene expression analysis revealed that GlcN upregulated Chop and Bax while downregulating Bcl2, indicating the involvement of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-induced apoptosis in the antiproliferative effects of GlcN. GlcN also increased the expression of FoxO1 and FoxO3, known tumor suppressors in various cancers. Furthermore, GlcN treatment elevated the levels of LC3II (an autophagy marker) and AMP-activated protein kinase activity, suggesting intracellular energy shortage. Indeed, GlcN treatment significantly suppressed glycolytic flux, lactate, and ATP production. Supplementing GlcN treatment with a high glucose concentration (20 mM) significantly attenuated its effect. We postulate that GlcN inhibits Hepa1-6 cell growth by inducing ER stress-induced apoptosis and autophagy and by inhibiting aerobic glycolysis (the Warburg effect), a key hallmark of cancer metabolism. Given that glucose transporter 2 (GLUT2), which is abundantly expressed in hepatocytes, has a high affinity for GlcN, these effects may result from GlcN competing with glucose for hepatocyte uptake by GLUT2. Our novel findings have potential implications for HCC treatment."

Despite GS is often used for OA treatment due to its cartilage preservation and minimum side effects, the molecular mechanism behind its interactions remains unknown. METHODS: Molecular docking was conducted to analyze the interactions between glucosamine sulfate and genes associated with OA such as matrix metalloproteinase-3 (MMP-3), MMP-9, and interleukin-4 (IL-4). Additionally, a cell viability assay using RAW 264.7 cells was performed to evaluate the toxicity of glucosamine sulfate at various concentrations. RESULTS: Molecular docking results revealed that glucosamine sulfate has a good binding affinity and stable interactions with MMP-3, MMP-9, and IL-4, indicating that it may have inhibitory effects on targeted genes. Nevertheless, the cell viability assay analysis demonstrated that glucosamine sulfate had considerable toxic effects in RAW 264.7 cells at highest concentrations. CONCLUSIONS: Glucosamine sulfate exhibited stable molecular interactions with genes associated to OA development. However, GS toxicity at high concentrations necessitates future research studies to optimize dosing and assess its therapeutic safety in OA treatment.",

This systematic review and network meta-analysis (NMA) aimed to identify the most effective glucosamine combination therapy for KOA patients. Methods: Frequentist random-effects models were employed for this NMA, with standardized mean differences (SMDs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) calculated for primary outcomes. We incorporated an SMD value of 0.40 as a minimum clinically important difference (MCID) to interpret the pain outcome. Confidence in evidence was evaluated using CINeMA. Results: Thirty randomized controlled trials (RCTs) covering 5265 patients were included. Glucosamine with omega-3 (G + omega-3, SMD -2.59 [95% CI -4.42 to -0.75], moderate quality) and glucosamine with ibuprofen (G + ibuprofen, SMD -2.27 [95% CI -3.73 to -0.82], moderate quality) significantly reduced overall pain compared to placebo. Similarly, glucosamine + chondroitin sulfate + methylsulfonylmethane showed effectiveness in pain reduction (SMD -2.25 [95% CI -3.84 to -0.67], low-quality). None of the other interventions met the MCID threshold for overall pain reduction. Moreover, clustered ranking results showed that glucosamine with omega-3 interventions was more effective than others in reducing overall pain and adverse events. Conclusions: For KOA, combining glucosamine with omega-3 and ibuprofen effectively reduces pain and may lower NSAID side effects, improving treatment guidelines and decision-making for better patient care."

METHODS: The study was designed retrospectively and included patients who underwent MOWHTO due to gonarthrosis, the MF method performed on these patients, and HA + GC treatments applied in addition to MF. Three groups consisting of 79 patients were formed: only HTO (Group 1), HTO + MF (Group 2), and HTO + MF + HA + GC (Group 3). The groups were compared using knee injury and osteoarthritis outcome score (KOOS), visual analog scale (VAS) for pain, and range of motion (ROM). The associations between the degree of correction and function and pain were evaluated. Additionally, the KOOS subparameters were compared between the groups. RESULTS: There were significant improvements in the postoperative KOOS and VAS scores in all three groups (p < 0.05). However, the ROM did not improve in Group 1. There was no significant difference in the postoperative KOOS, VAS, or ROM values ​​between Groups 2 and 3, but these values ​​were significantly better in Groups 2 and 3 than in Group 1 (p < 0.05). When the degree of correction increased, there were no significant positive changes in the postoperative KOOS or VAS score in Group 1, unlike in the other two groups (p < 0.05). In corrections of ≥ 10°, while there was no significant difference in the postoperative KOOS or VAS score ​​between Groups 2 and 3, these parameters significantly improved in these two groups compared to Group 1 (p < 0.05). Among the KOOS subparameters, pain and activities of daily living scores ​​were greater in Groups 2 and 3 than in Group 1 (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: In MOWHTO, MF is a sufficient treatment method that improves the patient's clinical condition without requiring additional treatments such as HA and GC.

      "abstract": "Glucosamine (GlcN) is one of the dietary supplements used in the treatment of osteoarthritis. Endogenously, GlcN is synthesized from glucose through the hexosamine pathway. In addition to ameliorating arthritis, several biological functions of GlcN have been reported, including insulin resistance in skeletal muscle. However, the regulatory role of GlcN in skeletal muscle development is not clear. We therefore investigated the effect of GlcN on myoblast proliferation, differentiation, and myotube development and their underlying mechanisms in C2C12 cells. Myoblast proliferation was measured by MTT assay. The expressions of MyoD, myogenin (MyoG), and myosin heavy chain (MyHC) were identified as determinants of myoblast differentiation. Expressions of atrogin-1 and muscle RING-finger protein-1 (MuRF-1) were identified as markers of myotube atrophy. The results show that treatment with GlcN significantly reduced myoblast proliferation and phosphorylation of Stat3 and S6K. These findings suggest that GlcN can inhibit growth of myoblasts through inhibiting phosphorylation of Stat3 and S6K. In addition, GlcN significantly suppressed the expression of MyoD, MyoG, and MyHC, as well as myotube formation. Pretreatment of C2C12 myoblast cells with ER stress inhibitors significantly blocked GlcN-inhibited MyHC expression and myotube formation. It can be concluded that GlcN suppressed myogenic differentiation via a pathway that involved ER stress. Moreover, GlcN decreased myotube diameter and expression of MyHC, as well as increased MuRF-1 in C2C12 myotubes. Meanwhile, GlcN also reduced the expressions of phosphorylated Akt and mTOR were stimulated after GlcN treatment in C2C12 myotubes. Thus, GlcN induced skeletal muscle atrophy by inhibiting the protein synthesis pathway. Chronic GlcN infusion also caused skeletal muscle atrophy in mice. In conclusion, GlcN regulated important stages of skeletal muscle development through different signaling pathways.",

Molecules reducing inflammation and angiogenesis hold promise for CRC prevention and treatment. N-Palmitoyl-d-glucosamine (PGA), a natural glycolipid analog with anti-inflammatory properties, has shown efficacy against acute colitis. Micronized PGA (mPGA) formulations exhibit superior anti-inflammatory activity. This study investigates the in vivo anti-angiogenic and protective effects of mPGA in a mouse model of colitis-associated CRC induced by azoxymethane/dextran sodium sulfate (AOM/DSS). CRC was induced in C57BL/6J mice using intraperitoneal azoxymethane followed by three cycles of 2.5% dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) in drinking water. Mice were treated with mPGA (30-150 mg/kg) with or without the PPARα inhibitor MK886 (10 mg/kg). At Day 70 post-azoxymethane injection, mice underwent anesthetized endoscopic colon evaluation. Post-mortem analysis of tumorigenesis and angiogenesis was performed using histological, immunohistochemical, and immunoblotting techniques. mPGA improved disease progression and survival rates in a dose- and PPARα-dependent manner in AOM/DSS-exposed mice. It reduced polyp formation, decreased pro-angiogenic CD31, pro-proliferative Ki67, and pro-inflammatory TLR4 expression levels, and inhibited VEGF and MMP-9 secretion by disrupting the pAkt/mTOR/HIF1α pathway. mPGA increased colon PEA levels, restoring anti-tumoral PPARα and wtp53 protein expression. Given its lack of toxicity, mPGA shows potential as a nutritional intervention to counteract inflammation-related angiogenesis in CRC.",

At 3 days post-injury (dpi), there was noticeable structural damage to brain tissue and reduced neuronal proliferation in the telencephalon that persisted until 30 dpi. Neurobehavioral deficits observed at 3 dpi included decreased exploratory and social activities and impaired learning and memory (L/M) functions; all of these resolved by 7 dpi. The injury led to a reduction in telencephalic phosphorylated cAMP response element-binding protein and O-GlcNAcylation, both of which were restored by 30 dpi. There was an increase in GFAP expression and nuclear translocation of NF-κB p65 at 3 dpi, which were not restored by 30 dpi. The injury caused decreased O-GlcNAc transferase and increased O-GlcNAcase levels at 3 dpi, normalizing by 30 dpi. Glucosamine (GlcN) treatment at 3 dpi significantly restored O-GlcNAcylation levels and L/M function, also reducing GFAP activation. Glucose treatment recovered L/M function by 7 dpi, but inhibition of the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway by 6-diazo-5-oxo-L-norleucine blocked this recovery. These findings suggest that the O-GlcNAc pathway is a potential therapeutic target for addressing L/M impairment following traumatic brain injury in zebrafish.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Among the medications used to treat knee osteoarthritis (OA), oral patented crystalline glucosamine sulfate (pCGS) and platelet-rich plasma (PRP) have become popular alternatives to painkillers or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Although studies have shown that pCGS and PRP improve clinical outcomes, no study has compared outcomes between these optional treatments. We compared functional performance outcomes from baseline to the 1-year follow-up (FU) between oral pCGS and PRP in patients with knee OA. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Three hundred eighty-two patients receiving oral pCGS and 122 patients receiving PRP injections were enrolled for a review of functional performance outcomes, including a five-time sit-to-stand test (5xSST), time up-and-go test (TUGT), and 3-minute walk distance test (3MWDT). The patients were followed up for one year. The pCGS group received 1500 mg daily, whereas the PRP group received 2 cycles of intra-articular injections at week 0 and week 6. Using propensity score matching based on age, sex, height, weight, BMI, and Kellgren and Lawrence (KL) classification, all three functional performance outcomes were compared between the baseline (pretreatment), 6-week, 12-week, 24-week, and 1-year FUs. RESULTS: With a ratio of 2:1 (pCGS: PRP), 204 patients in the pCGS group were matched with 102 patients in the PRP group. Compared with the baseline levels, the PRP group showed significant improvements in 5xSST and TUGT outcomes from 6 weeks and significant improvements in 3MWDT outcomes from 12 weeks, whereas the pCGS group showed significant improvements in TUGT outcomes from 6 weeks and significant improvements in 5xSST and 3MWDT outcomes from 12 weeks. At the 24-week and 1-year FU, both groups showed significant improvements in all three functional performance tests without adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: Although the PRP group showed faster improvements in 5xSST outcomes at six weeks, from the 12-week to 1-year FU, both the pCGS and PRP groups showed significant improvements in 5xSST, TUGT, and 3MWDT outcomes. As the use of PRP is more complicated and invasive than the use of oral pCGS, the benefits and drawbacks of selecting PRP over pCGS in knee OA treatment should be examined.",

OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study was to investigate the action of CGS on the progression of chemically induced osteoarthritis in the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) of rabbits by evaluating the serum levels of tumour necrosis factor (TNF-α) and collagen in the articular discs. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A sample of 36 male rabbits was divided into three groups: control (CG), osteoarthritis (OG) and treatment (TG). The disease was induced by intra-articular injection of sodium monoiodoacetate (10 mg/mL) in the OG and TG groups bilaterally. After 10 days, the TG animals received subcutaneous injection of chondroitin sulphates and glucosamine (7.5 mg/kg) and the OG and CG received saline solution (50 μL). Euthanasia times were subdivided into 40 and 100 days. Collagen quantification was performed by biochemical and histological analysis and for the quantification of serum levels of TNF-α, an enzyme immunoassay was used. RESULTS: The TG showed an increase in the collagen area of the articular disc when compared to the CG and the OG. The increase collagen concentration in the discs did not show a statistically significant difference between the groups. Post-treatment TNF-α levels were significantly lower in TG compared to OG. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that CGS treatment delayed the degeneration of the collagen in the TMJ articular disc and reduced serum TNF-α levels, indicating a preventive effect on OA progression.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Cold-dampness-type knee osteoarthritis is a common middle-aged and elderly disease, but its pathogenesis is not fully understood, and its clinical treatment has limitations. Glucosamine sulfate capsules are commonly used for treating arthritis, and San Bi Tang is a classic formula of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) that has the effects of warming yang, dispelling dampness, relaxing muscles, and activating collaterals. This research hypothesized that the combination of modified San Bi Tang and glucosamine sulfate capsules could enhance the clinical efficacy of treating cold-dampness-type knee osteoarthritis through complementary effects. AIM: To analyze the clinical efficacy of San Bi Tang combined with glucosamine sulfate capsules when treating cold-dampness-type knee osteoarthritis. METHODS: A total of 110 patients with cold-dampness-type knee osteoarthritis were selected as research subjects and randomly divided into a control group and an experimental group of 55 cases each. The control group received only treatment with glucosamine sulfate capsules, while the experimental group received additional treatment with modified San Bi Tang for a duration of 5 wk. The patients' knee joint functions, liver and kidney function indicators, adverse reactions, and vital signs were evaluated and analyzed using SPSS 26.0 software. RESULTS: Before treatment, the two groups' genders, ages, and scores were not significantly different, indicating comparability. Both groups' scores improved after treatment, which could indicate pain and knee joint function improvement, but the test group had better scores. The TCM-specific symptoms and the clinical efficacy of the treatment in the test group were higher. Before and after treatment, there were no abnormalities in the patients' liver and kidney function indicators. CONCLUSION: The combination of modified San Bi Tang and glucosamine sulfate capsules is superior to treatment with sulfated glucosamine alone and has high safety."

ETM-loaded CS nanoparticles (ETM-CS-NPs) were developed using the ionic gelation of CS with tripolyphosphate (TPP). Utilising Zeta-sizer and scanning electron microscopy, the ETM-CS-NPs were evaluated for particle size (PS), zeta potential (ZP), surface morphology, polydispersity index (PDI), entrapment efficiency (EE) and drug loading (DL). Drug and polymer interactions in NPs were assessed using Fourier transform infra-red spectroscopy. The response surface approach and Design-Expert software optimised the ETM-CS-NPs. Using RSM, the effects of independent variables such as the amount of CS, the amount of TPP, and the amount of glacial acetic acid on PS, PDI and ZP were analysed. The optimal combination of PS (354.8 nm), PDI (0.509), ZP (43.7 + mV), % EE (70.3 ± 1.3) and % DL (9.1 ± 0.4) has been identified for the optimised ETM-CS-NPs. ETM-CS-NPs' anticoagulant activity was evaluated using activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), prothrombin time (PT) and thrombin time (TT) assays. In conclusion, a practical and consistent method has been established, and its application has been proven in vitro, indicating its utility for future studies of the biological distribution of ETM-CS-NPs in vivo for specific antithrombotic treatments.",

METHODS: Ninety-two female Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were divided into 4 groups i.e. protamine sulfate (PS), N-acetylcysteine (NAC), and glucosamine-treated PS (GPS), and normal saline control (NC) were used. We induced hyperactivity in rats via intravesical infusion of PS and potassium chloride (KCl), whereas the NC group underwent a sustained intravesical saline infusion for 1 h. N-acetylcysteine (NAC), a potential antioxidant as well as anti-inflammatory agent was employed as positive control. Cystometrography (CMG) was then conducted to determine urodynamic parameters, i.e., leak point pressure (LPP, n = 48) and inter-contractile interval, the duration between two voids (ICI, n = 32). RESULTS: LPP was significantly elevated in the GPS group (mean ± SD: 110.9 ± 6.2 mmHg) compared to the NC (81.0 ± 32.5 mmHg), PS (40.3 ± 10.9 mmHg), and NAC group (70.3 ± 19.4 mmHg). The cystometrogram data also reveals a prolonged ICI in the GPS group (241.3 ± 40.2 s) compared to the NC group (216.0 ± 41.7 s), PS group (128.8 ± 23.6 s), and NAC group (193.8 ± 28.3 s). CONCLUSION: This preliminary study implies the ameliorative impact of GPS treatment on OAB in terms of improved urodynamic parameters, including LPP and ICI.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Observational studies have associated glucosamine, used to treat joint pain and osteoarthritis, with reductions in cancer incidence, although their study design was affected by selection bias. We assessed this association using a study design that mitigates this selection bias. METHODS: We used the UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink to identify a cohort of patients diagnosed with osteoarthritis during 1995 through 2017. The prevalent new-user cohort design was employed to match glucosamine initiators with non-users on time-conditional propensity scores, who were observed until cancer incidence. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of cancer incidence were estimated to compare glucosamine initiators with non-users. RESULTS: The study cohort of patients with osteoarthritis included 20,541 glucosamine initiators who were matched to 20,541 non-users. Over an average follow-up of eight years, the overall incidence rate of any cancer was 16.4 per 1,000 per year. The HR of any cancer incidence with glucosamine treatment was 0.97 (95% CI 0.91-1.02) compared with non-users. For lung cancer, the HR with glucosamine treatment was 0.99 (95% CI 0.83-1.18), whereas it was 1.11 (95% CI 0.93-1.33) for colorectal cancer, 1.07 (95% CI 0.93-1.23) for breast cancer in women, and 1.03 (95% CI 0.88-1.22) for prostate cancer. CONCLUSION: In this large, real-world study of patients with osteoarthritis, designed to emulate a trial, treatment with glucosamine did not reduce the incidence of cancer. This finding reinforces that previous studies, not based on glucosamine initiators, were affected by selection bias. Our study does not support the prescription of glucosamine to prevent cancer in patients with osteoarthritis.",

To improve bioavailability and develop the medical field of application, different delivery systems have been developed that are adapted to certain environments or the proposed target type. This study presents some half-curcuminoids prepared by the condensation of acetylacetone with 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde (C1), 4-hydroxy-3-methoxybenzaldehyde (C2), 4-acetamidobenzaldehyde (C3), or 4-diethylaminobenzaldehyde (C4), at microwaves as a simple, solvent-free, and eco-friendly method. The four compounds obtained were characterized in terms of morphostructural and photophysical properties. Following the predictions of theoretical studies on the biological activities related to the molecular structure, in vitro tests were performed for compounds C1-C3 to evaluate the antitumor properties and for C4's possible applications in the treatment of neurological diseases. The four compounds were encapsulated in two types of hydrogel matrices. First, the alginate-glucosamine network was generated and then the curcumin analogs were loaded (G1, G3, G5-G7, and G9). The second type of hydrogels was obtained by loading the active compound together with the generation of the hydrogel carrier matrices, by simply dissolving (G4 and G10) or by chemically binding half-curcuminoid derivatives to glucosamine (G2 and G8). Thus, two types of curcumin analog delivery systems were obtained, which could be applied in various types of medical treatments."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Temporomandibular joint osteoarthritis (TMJ OA) is a chronic disease that is a consequence of undue occlusal forces and is characterized by irreversible damage to the articular surfaces. Symptomatic slow-acting so-called nutraceutical drugs have been proposed as a treatment for osteoarthritis in comparison to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Oral glucosamine and chondroitin, slow-acting drugs, have been found to reduce pain and in- crease mouth opening in patients with TMJ OA. However, there is limited scientific evidence to confirm their clinical effectiveness. AIM: This systematic review was conducted to bolster the evidence supporting the assessment of the efficacy of glucosamine in the context of temporomandibular joint osteoarthritis (TMJ OA). METHODOLOGY: This review identified four review articles from databases like Medline (via PubMed), Web of Science, Scopus, and EMBASE till September 2023 after screening at the title, abstract, and full-text level. They were assessed for risk of bias with the JBI risk of bias assess- ment tool. RESULT: This review with meta-analysis focused on pooled estimate mean differences, revealing non-significant but discernible effects of glucosamine on maximum mouth opening (SMD = 0.288, p = 0.15) and pain reduction (SMD = 0.217, p = 0.476) in TMJ-related disorders. CONCLUSION: Compared to control groups with ibuprofen and tramadol, glucosamine showed slightly more favourable outcomes. However, the variability in methodology and study characteristics warrants further longitudinal studies to confirm its efficacy."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: 70 patients with stages I-III of primary knee OA were randomized into 2 groups. Participants in the 1st (n=35) took AN 1 caps/day, in the 2nd (n=35) GC according to the standard regimen. After 7, 30, 90, 180 days, the Lequesne index (severity of OA), pain when moving according to VAS, WOMAC score were assessed, after 1, 3, 6 months - quality of life SF-36 and morning stiffness, after 6 months - MRI with T2 mapping, laboratory safety indicators. RESULTS: Over the course of 6 months of use, an improvement in the WOMAC index and a decrease in pain were observed without intergroup differences, and a greater decrease in stiffness in the AN group. After 3 months, the severity of OA decreased from moderate to mild in the AN group and was significantly lower compared to the GC group; quality of life (physical component of SF-36) was higher in the AN group. After 6 months, there was an improvement in cartilage ultrastructure (T2 relaxation time) in both groups and a more pronounced reduction of the synovitis area (MRI) in the AN group (2.95 and 1.37 times in the AN and GC group, respectively). There were no clinically significant adverse reactions observed in both groups. CONCLUSION: The use of AN in patients with stage I-III primary knee OA was not inferior in efficacy to the combination of GC. Further studies with greater statistical power (sample size) and follow-up period are warranted including in real clinical practice.",

      "abstract": "Osteoarthritis is more prevalent than any other form of arthritis and is characterized by the progressive mechanical deterioration of joints. Glucosamine, an amino monosaccharide, has been used for over fifty years as a dietary supplement to alleviate osteoarthritis-related discomfort. Silibinin, extracted from milk thistle, modifies the degree of glycosylation of target proteins, making it an essential component in the treatment of various diseases. In this study, we aimed to investigate the functional roles of glucosamine and silibinin in cartilage homeostasis using the TC28a2 cell line. Western blots showed that glucosamine suppressed the N-glycosylation of the gp130, EGFR, and N-cadherin proteins. Furthermore, both glucosamine and silibinin differentially decreased and increased target proteins such as gp130, Snail, and KLF4 in TC28a2 cells. We observed that both compounds dose-dependently induced the proliferation of TC28a2 cells. Our MitoSOX and DCFH-DA dye data showed that 1 µM glucosamine suppressed mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and induced cytosol ROS generation, whereas silibinin induced both mitochondrial and cytosol ROS generation in TC28a2 cells. Our JC-1 data showed that glucosamine increased red aggregates, resulting in an increase in the red/green fluorescence intensity ratio, while all the tested silibinin concentrations increased the green monomers, resulting in decreases in the red/green ratio. We observed increasing subG1 and S populations and decreasing G1 and G2/M populations with increasing amounts of glucosamine, while increasing amounts of silibinin led to increases in subG1, S, and G2/M populations and decreases in G1 populations in TC28a2 cells. MTT data showed that both glucosamine and silibinin induced cytotoxicity in TC28a2 cells in a dose-dependent manner. Regarding endoplasmic reticulum stress, both compounds induced the expression of CHOP and increased the level of p-eIF2α/eIF2α. With respect to O-GlcNAcylation status, glucosamine and silibinin both reduced the levels of O-GlcNAc transferase and hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha. Furthermore, we examined proteins and mRNAs related to these processes. In summary, our findings demonstrated that these compounds differentially modulated cellular proliferation, mitochondrial and cytosol ROS generation, the mitochondrial membrane potential, the cell cycle profile, and autophagy. Therefore, we conclude that glucosamine and silibinin not only mediate glycosylation modifications but also regulate cellular processes in human chondrocytes.",

Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa) frequently causes biofilm-related infections associated with ventilator tubing.

This study aims to investigate the biofilm inhibition properties of glucosamine AuNPs in combination with meropenem against P. aeruginosa ATCC 9027 on the endotracheal tube. A biofilm inhibition assay of glucosamine AuNPs at 0.02 mg/mL, both singly and in combination with meropenem at 1 mg/mL, was carried out against P. aeruginosa ATCC 9027 on an endotracheal tube using the tissue culture plate method. Scanning electron microscopy was performed for visualization. Glucosamine AuNPs at 0.02 mg/mL combined with meropenem at 1 mg/mL showed greater biofilm inhibition (72%) on the endotracheal tube than glucosamine nanoparticles at 0.02 mg/mL alone (26%) (p = 0.001). The scanning electron microscopic visualization revealed that the untreated P. aeruginosa biofilm was denser than the glucosamine nanoparticles-treated biofilm, whether combined with meropenem or using glucosamine nanoparticles alone. The combination of glucosamine AuNPs and meropenem may have the synergistic effect of inhibiting biofilm production of P. aeruginosa on the endotracheal tubes of patients with mechanical ventilation. Conducting additional experiments to explore the impact of combining glucosamine-coated gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) with meropenem on the inhibition of biofilm production by clinical P. aeruginosa isolates would be beneficial."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Osteoarthritis (OA) is becoming a major medical burden worldwide due to changing lifestyles and aging populations. Osteoarthritis is a disease characterized by a variety of anatomic and physiological changes to joints, including cartilage degradation, bone remodeling, and the formation of osteophytes. These changes cause pain, stiffness, swelling, and limitations in joint function. Glucosamine serves as a fundamental constituent for cartilage, the resilient connective tissue responsible for cushioning joints. Glucosamine Sulphate Potassium Chloride (GSPC) supplementation is widely employed to mitigate symptoms linked to osteoarthritis, a degenerative joint disorder hallmarked by cartilage degradation. AIM: Palliative care aims at minimizing pain and disability and improving function, performance, and quality of life. In this study, the emulgel formulation of GSPC was developed and checked for its potential. OBJECTIVE: Currently, OA does not have a definitive treatment. Since conventional dosage forms cannot deliver the active drug content at a predefined target site in a predictable manner throughout the treatment period, a new carrier system is always required. Considering their reduced size, targeting potential, and site specificity, nanocarrier-based approaches could hold an answer to shortcomings associated with conventional routes. Thus, the objective of the current study was to formulate and characterize glucosamine sulphate potassium chloride-loaded emulgel for the treatment of osteoarthritis. METHODS: Microemulsion of glucosamine sulphate potassium chloride was formulated using a spontaneous emulsification method comprising of oleic acid (oil phase), Tween 80, Tween 20 (surfactant) and PEG 400, Span 80 (co-surfactant), and distilled water (aqueous phase). The microemulsions were evaluated for surface morphology, globule size, poly-dispersibility index (PDI), zeta potential, and viscosity, and the final batch of microemulsions was selected. RESULTS: The optimized microemulsion contained 35% co-surfactant (propylene glycol), 20% surfactant (Tween 20), and 15% oil (oleic acid) and glucosamine sulphate potassium chloride in a dose of 60 mg, which has sufficient drug loading capacity with a droplet size of 182 nm for optimized formulation. The optimized microemulsion formulation was added to gel prepared by Carbopol 934 in a 1:1 (w/w) ratio, leading to the formulation of glucosamine sulphate potassium chloride- containing emulgel. The prepared emulgel was further evaluated for viscosity, drug content, pH, and in vitro drug release. Emulgel formulation (F6) showed 88% drug release after 6 hours, and it followed the Higuchi model. CONCLUSION: Glucosamine Sulphate Potassium Chloride (GSPC) is used in the treatment of OA by increasing the production of proteoglycans, which can cause the cartilage to break down. Emulgel formulation (F3) showed 75.41% drug release, and formulation (F6) showed 88% drug release after 6 h. Therefore, it may be concluded that an emulgel of GSPC can be used as a controlled-release dosage form of the drug for local application in OA.",

METHODS: This systematic review was conducted according to PRISMA 2020 guidelines. A detailed literature search was performed from 03/1994 to 31/12/2022 using various electronic databases including PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Google Scholar, using the search terms-Glucosamine sulfate (GS), Chondroitin sulfate (CS), Knee osteoarthritis, Joint pain, Joint disease, and Joint structure, for literature concerning glucosamine, chondroitin, and their combination in knee osteoarthritis treatment. Cochrane Collaboration's Risk assessment tool (version 5.4.1) was used for assessing the risk of bias and the quality of the literature. The data was extracted from the included studies and subjected to statistical analysis to determine the beneficial effect of Glucosamine Sulfate, Chondroitin Sulfate, and their combination. RESULTS: Twenty-five randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were included in this systematic review. In short, exclusively 9 RCTs for GS, 13 RCTs for CS, and 3 RCTs for the combination of GS and CS. All these studies had their treatment groups compared with placebo. In the meta-analysis, CS showed a significant reduction in pain intensity, and improved physical function compared to the placebo; GS showed a significant reduction in tibiofemoral joint space narrowing. While the combination of GS and CS showed neither a reduction in pain intensity, nor any improvement in the physical function. However, the combination exhibited a non-significant reduction in joint space narrowing. In the safety evaluation, both CS and GS have shown good safety profile and were well tolerated. CONCLUSION: This meta-analysis revealed that the CS (with decreased pain intensity and improvement in the physical function), and GS (with significant reduction in the joint space narrowing) have significant therapeutic benefits. However, their combination did not significantly improve the symptoms or modify the disease. This may be due to the limited trials that are available on the combination of the sulfate forms of the intervention. Hence, there is a scope for conducting multicentric randomised controlled trials to evaluate and conclude the therapeutic role of CS and GS combination in the management of KOA.",

The results showed that GLC can significantly inhibit the abnormal increase of aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), triglycerides (TG), total cholesterol (TC), very low density lipoprotein (VLDL), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and can significantly improve the level of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C). In addition, GLC intervention significantly improved alcohol induced hepatic oxidative stress by reducing the levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) and, increasing the levels of glutathione (GSH), catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) in the liver. Further mechanisms suggest that GLC can inhibit the expression of ethanol metabolism enzyme cytochrome P4502E1 (CYP2E1), activate the antioxidant pathway Keap1/Nrf2/HO-1, down-regulate the phosphorylation of MAPK and NF-κB signaling pathways, and thus reduce the expression of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and interleukin-6 (IL-6). Therefore, GLC may be a significant candidate functional food for attenuating alcohol induced acute liver injury."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Breast cancer is a common cancer with high mortality rates. Early diagnosis is crucial for reducing the prognosis and mortality rates. Therefore, the development of alternative treatment options is necessary. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the inhibitory effect of N-acetyl-D-glucosamine (D-GlcNAc) on breast cancer using a machine learning method. The findings were further confirmed through assays on breast cancer cell lines. METHODS: MCF-7 and 4T1 cell lines (ATCC) were cultured in the presence and absence of varying concentrations of D-GlcNAc (0.5 mM, 1 mM, 2 mM, and 4 mM) for 72 hours. A xenograft mouse model for breast cancer was established by injecting 4T1 cells into mammary glands. D-GlcNAc (2 mM) was administered intraperitoneally to mice daily for 28 days, and histopathological effects were evaluated at pre-tumoral and post-tumoral stages. RESULTS: Treatment with 2 mM and 4 mM D-GlcNAc significantly decreased cell proliferation rates in MCF-7 and 4T1 cell lines and increased Fas expression. The number of apoptotic cells was significantly higher than untreated cell cultures (p < 0.01 - p < 0.0001). D-GlcNAc administration also considerably reduced tumour size, mitosis, and angiogenesis in the post-treatment group compared to the control breast cancer group (p < 0.01 - p < 0.0001). Additionally, molecular docking/dynamic analysis revealed a high binding affinity of D-GlcNAc to the marker protein HER2, which is involved in tumour progression and cell signalling. CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrated the positive effect of D-GlcNAc administration on breast cancer cells, leading to increased apoptosis and Fas expression in the malignant phenotype. The binding affinity of D-GlcNAc to HER2 suggests a potential mechanism of action. These findings contribute to understanding D-GlcNAc as a potential anti-tumour agent for breast cancer treatment.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Feline idiopathic cystitis is a common, chronic-relapsing disorder of the lower urinary tract. In addition to environmental modification/enrichment, long-term and safe treatment targeting specific pathophysiological changes may be of help. In this context, effective dietary interventions hold clinical promise. Palmitoyl-glucosamine (PGA) and hesperidin (HSP) are safe and authorized feed ingredients for animal nutrition under European regulations. METHODS: The current study aimed to investigate whether a 3:1 mixture of micronized PGA and HSP could represent a novel mechanism-oriented approach to chronic cystitis management. A newly validated rat model of cyclophosphamide (CYP)-induced chronic cystitis was used (40 mg/kg, three intraperitoneal injections every 3rd day). Animals were randomized to orally receive either vehicle or PGA-HSP at a low (72 + 24 mg/kg) or high (doubled) dose for 13 days, starting 3 days before the chronic CYP protocol, with mesna (2-mercaptoethane-sulfonate) being used as a reference drug. RESULTS: Higher PGA-HSP dose was effective at relieving chronic visceral pain, as measured by mechanical allodynia test (von Frey test). The severity of cystitis was also significantly improved, as shown by the reduced sonographic thickening of the bladder wall, as well as the decrease in edema, bleeding and bladder to body weight ratio compared to the vehicle treated group. A significant decrease of MPO activity, MDA level and fibrosis at Masson's trichrome staining was also observed in animals administered PGA-HSP in comparison to vehicle treated ones. The CYP-induced increase in bladder mRNA expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines was also significantly counteracted by the study mixture. Moreover, CYP-induced bladder mast cell accumulation and releasability were significantly decreased by PGA-HSP (even at the low dose), as determined by metachromatic staining, chymase and tryptase immunostaining as well as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for histamine and 5-hydoxytriptamine. DISCUSSION: PGA-HSP is able to block CYP-induced decrease of tight junction proteins, claudin-1 and occludin, thus preserving the urothelial bladder function. Finally, neuroinflammatory changes were investigated, showing that dietary supplementation with PGA-HSP prevented the activation of neurons and non-neuronal cells (i.e., microglia, astrocytes and mast cells) at the spinal level, and counteracted CYP-induced increase of spinal mRNA encoding for pro-inflammatory cytokines. Altogether, the present findings confirm the uroprotective and pain-relieving effect of PGA-HSP and pave the way to potential and relevant clinical applications of the study supplement in feline idiopathic cystitis."

      "abstract": "Osteoarthritis in the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) is a chronic disease characterized by irreversible damage to articular surfaces, including inflammation, loss of articular cartilage, and subchondral bone alterations, which would be radiographically evident only in later stages. Symptomatic slow-acting so-called nutraceutical drugs have been proposed as a treatment for osteoarthritis in comparison to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) because of their appreciable safety profile even in long-term intake. Glucosamine, being one among them, proved highly efficient in knee osteoarthritis. However, its application in TMJ osteoarthritis dates back only to 2001 and is still inconclusive in its efficiency even with systematic reviews, in restoring the structural and functional aspects of damaged TMJ. Glucosamine, being a natural compound and also a contributor to building the matrix of articular cartilage, can be utilized effectively for TMJ osteoarthritis as an adjunct along with other conventional treatment modalities available till now, which also have moderate prognosis in most of the clinical scenarios. This review summarizes data relating to the mechanism of osteoarthritis and its management using glucosamine formulations. The beneficial effects of glucosamine on the pathophysiology of TMJ osteoarthritis are possibly due to its contribution to hyaluronic acid regulation and in establishing a proper balance between anabolism/catabolism in the articular tissues.",

This is an observational, open, single-arm multicenter study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of a nutritional supplement in patients with knee and/or hip OA. A total of 186 patients were recruited from Spanish centers and received a supplement containing hydrolyzed collagen (3000 mg), chondroitin sulfate (800 mg), glucosamine sulfate (700 mg), turmeric extract (250 mg) and devil's claw (150 mg), once daily during 6 months. The primary outcome was the patients' self-perceived pain in the affected joints measured with a visual analogue scale (VAS). Secondary outcome was the patient's functioning, measured with the Lequesne Functional Index and the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC). Participants showed a significant reduction in self-perceived pain after 3 (mean reduction ± standard deviation, 1.99 ± 1.05) and 6 months (3.57 ± 1.39) of treatment (p < 0.0001 in both comparisons). Lequesne Functional Index score was significantly reduced at 3 months (3.86 ± 2.94) and at 6 months (6.73 ± 4.30) of treatment (p < 0.0001 in both comparisons). The WOMAC index was also significantly reduced after 3 (14.24 ± 10.04) and 6 months (26.43 ± 17.35) of treatment (p < 0.0001 in both comparisons). Significant reductions in WOMAC subdomains (p < 0.0001 in all comparisons) were observed. No severe adverse events were reported during the study. The main results arising from this study show that this nutritional supplementation can improve OA-related symptoms and physical function with a good safety profile in patients with hip and/or knee OA.",

Nanocarriers are widely used for RA treatment; however, the targeted delivery and on-demand release of multiple drugs remains challenging. Therefore, in this study, a dual-sensitive polymer is developed using chondroitin sulfate (CS) for the co-delivery of the cartilage repair agent, glucosamine (GlcN), and anti-inflammatory drug, tofacitinib (Tof). In the joint cavity, acidic pH facilitates the cleavage of GlcN from CS polymer to repair the cartilage damage. Subsequently, macrophage uptake via CS-CD44 binding and intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) mediate conversion of (methylsulfanyl)propylamine to a hydrophilic segment jointly triggered rapid Tof/GlcN release via micelle disassembly. The combined effects of Tof, GlcN, and ROS depletion promote the M1-to-M2 polarization shift to attenuate inflammation. The synergistic effects of these agents against RA are confirmed in vitro and in vivo. Overall, the dual pH/ROS-sensitive CS nanoplatform simultaneously delivers GlcN and Tof, providing a multifunctional approach for RA treatment with synergistic drug effects.",

PATIENTS AND METHODS: In the prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled pilot study conducted between August 2019 and November 2019, 120 participants (28 males, 92 females; mean age: 66.4±7.9 years; range, 42.4 to 74.5 years) were randomized at a 1:1:1 ratio to the placebo group, the first experimental group (a combination of GS, naCS, and SAMe was administered to the experimental groups. The first experimental group received 375 mg of GS, 300 mg of naCS, and 100 mg of SAMe, whereas the second experimental group received 750 mg of GS, 600 mg of naCS, and 200 mg of SAMe). Laboratory (erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin [IL]-1β, IL-6, IL-17), clinical (Visual Analog Scale [VAS], short form health survey [SF-36], the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index [WOMAC], and the Tegner Lysholm Knee Scoring Scale [TLKS]), and musculoskeletal ultrasound (MSUS) assessments were performed at baseline and after three and six months. RESULTS: A minor increase was observed in the second experimental group after six months using ultrasonography to evaluate articular cartilage thickness (p<0.05). The investigational product's superiority in reducing osteoarthritis ultrasonographic findings was not proven. A moderately negative association was found between cartilage thickness and VAS scores at baseline (ρ=-0.36, p<0.01), while the presence of massive osteophytes on MSUS showed a low to moderate association with all clinical outcomes. There was no difference in the delta changes between groups for the VAS, TLKS, WOMAC, and SF-36. The only serum inflammatory marker outside the reference range was IL-1β, but no significant changes were observed after six months. CONCLUSION: According to the results of our investigation, treatment for knee osteoarthritis should be evaluated using more objective outcomes. The most important conclusion of our study is that IP may result in a slight increase in articular cartilage thickness, which was associated with a decrease in pain intensity at baseline. Clarification of the potential influence of this combination on radiographic progression and laboratory markers of inflammation requires further exploration."

Here, we studied and characterized the detectability of GlcN uptake and metabolism in the brain. Following intravenous GlcN administration in mice, CEST brain signals calculated by magnetization transfer ratio asymmetry (MTRasym) analysis, were significantly elevated, mainly in the cortex, hippocampus, and thalamus. The in vivo contrast remained stable during 40 min of examination, which can be attributed to GlcN uptake and its metabolic products accumulation as confirmed using 13C NMR spectroscopic studies of brain extracts. A Lorentzian multi-pool fitting analysis revealed an increase in the hydroxyl, amide, and relayed nuclear Overhauser effect (rNOE) signal components after GlcN treatment. With its ability to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB), the GlcN CEST technique has the potential to serve as a metabolic biomarker for the diagnosis and monitoring various brain disorders.",

The present study is designed to evaluate glucosamine effects against radiation-induced brain oxidative stress and depression-like effect in rats. Four groups of female Wister rats were used as control, irradiated (4 × 2 Gy), glucosamine (1 g/kg P.O), and glucosamine + irradiated group. The behavioral responses are estimated. The brain hippocampi of the rats are separated to evaluate oxidative stress biochemical parameters and glycogen synthase kinase pathway in addition to the biogenic amines. Irradiation exposure led to disturbances in the behavioral assessments (forced swimming test, light-dark box, and open field test) and a significant decrease in brain GSH, neurotransmitters (serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine), phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI3K), and phosphorylated protein kinase-B (p-AKT) levels. Additionally, MDA and ROS levels increased significantly post-irradiation along with the phosphorylated glycogen synthase kinase (p-GSK3). Glucosamine administration before irradiation caused improvement in the behavioral valuations and the biochemical parameters in the brain as well. Glucosamine might be used as a radioprotector to improve brain function and as an antidepressant drug. It could be promising as a future therapy in managing depression occurring during radiotherapy."

METHODS: We retrospectively collected clinical data of 82 patients with KOA admitted to Shandong Weifang People's Hospital from April 2019 to September 2022. According to the treatment records, 35 patients received an intramuscular injection of compound osteopeptide (control group), and 47 patients received an injection of glucosamine hydrochloride combined with compound osteopeptide (observation group). We compared clinical efficacy, WOMAC scores, inflammatory factor and CD4+ and CD8+ levels, and the incidence of adverse reactions between the two groups. RESULTS: The observation group's total efficacy (95.74%) was significantly higher than the control group's (80.00%; P<0.05). Treatment led to a significant reduction in WOMAC scores in both groups. In addition, the levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) in the observation group were significantly lower than those in the control group (P<0.05); while the levels of CD4+ and CD8+ were significantly higher in the observation group (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Compared with compound osteopeptide injection alone, glucosamine hydrochloride combined with compound osteopeptide injection is more effective for patients with KOA, with improved level of inflammatory factors and immune function."

Nowadays, several methods are applied to protect bone health, including the use of hormonal and non-hormonal medications and supplements. However, certain drugs like glucocorticoids, thiazolidinediones, heparin, anticonvulsants, chemotherapy, and proton pump inhibitors can endanger bone health and cause bone loss. New studies are exploring the use of supplements, such as conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) and glucosamine, with fewer side effects during treatment. Various mechanisms have been proposed for the effects of CLA and glucosamine on bone structure, both direct and indirect. One mechanism that deserves special attention is the regulatory effect of RANKL/RANK/OPG on bone turnover. The RANKL/RANK/OPG pathway is considered a motive for osteoclast maturation and bone resorption. The cytokine system, consisting of the receptor activator of the nuclear factor (NF)-kB ligand (RANKL), its receptor RANK, and its decoy receptor, osteoprotegerin (OPG), plays a vital role in bone turnover. Over the past few years, researchers have observed the impact of CLA and glucosamine on the RANKL/RANK/OPG mechanism of bone turnover. However, no comprehensive study has been published on these supplements and their mechanism. To address this gap in knowledge, we have critically reviewed their potential effects. This review aims to assist in developing efficient treatment strategies and focusing future studies on these supplements.",

      "abstract": "Glucosamine (Glu) is a cartilage and joint fluid matrix precursor that modulates osteoarthritic joint changes. To improve the enzymatic stability, glucosamine was developed into nanoglucosamine by the ionic gelation method through sodium tripolyphosphate (TPP) as cross-linking agent. The optimized mass ratio of Glu:TPP was (3:1) with the particle size 163 ± 25 nm and surface charge -5 mV. Then Sinapic acid (SA) as a natural phenolic acid with strong antioxidant and antimicrobial activities has been grafted onto glucosamine nanoparticles (GluNPs) with grafting efficiency (73 ± 6 %). The covalent insertion of SA was confirmed by UV-Vis, FTIR, 1HNMR, XRD, and FESEM analyses and the other physicochemical properties were also characterized. SA-g-GluNPs showed spherical shape with a mean diameter of 255 ± 20 nm and zeta potential +16 mV. The in vitro release profile of SA-g-GluNPs exhibited the sustained and pH-dependent drug release property. SA-g-GluNPs had a more pronounced effect on reducing the elevated levels of LPS-induced oxidative stress and pro-inflammatory cytokines than free SA in the human chondrocyte C28/I2 cell line. Furthermore, the antibacterial properties against E. coli and S. aureus were also improved by SA-g-GluNPs. This study demonstrated the potential of phenolic acid grafted GluNPs in therapeutic drug applications for chondroprotection and food industries.",

      "abstract": "Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a liver disease syndrome. The prevalence of NAFLD has continued to increase globally, and NAFLD has become a worldwide public health problem. Glucosamine (GLC) is an amino monosaccharide derivative of glucose. GLC has been proven to not only be effective in anti-inflammation applications, but also to modulate the gut microbiota effectively. Therefore, in this study, the therapeutic effect of GLC in the NAFLD context and the mechanisms underlying these effects were explored. Specifically, an NAFLD model was established by feeding mice a high-fat and high-sugar diet (HFHSD), and the HFHSD-fed NAFLD mice were treated with GLC. First, we investigated the effect of treating NAFLD mice with GLC by analyzing serum- and liver-related indicator levels. We found that GLC attenuated insulin resistance and inflammation, increased antioxidant function, and attenuated serum and liver lipid metabolism in the mice. Then, we investigated the mechanism underlying liver lipid metabolism, inflammation, and intestinal barrier function in these mice. We found that GLC can improve liver lipid metabolism and relieve insulin resistance and oxidative stress levels. In addition, GLC treatment increased intestinal barrier function, reduced LPS translocation, and reduced liver inflammation by inhibiting the activation of the LPS/TLR4/NF-κB pathway, thereby effectively ameliorating liver lesions in NAFLD mice.",

      "abstract": "The ability of cartilage to regenerate and repair is limited. N-acetyl- d-glucosamine (GlcNAc) is a nutritional supplement commonly used to activate chondrocytes. To prolong the duration of action of GlcNAc and improve its curative effect after cartilage injury, a GlcNAc thermosensitive hydrogel is prepared based on Pluronic F127 (PF127). The physicochemical properties results indicate that this hydrogel is injectable and retards the release of GlcNAc. Further, the therapeutic benefits of GlcNAc hydrogel are detected through intra-articular injection in rat specimens with cartilage injury. Behavioral experiments results indicate that the rats treated with GlcNAc hydrogel had longer step lengths, smaller foot angles and slower fall times. Compared with the sham group, the expression of Sox9 was 1.5 times and the level of collagen II was 2.4 times in the hydrogel treated group. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining result confirmed that the GlcNAc hydrogel reduce apoptosis by about 50%. Our results of immunohistochemical staining, Western blotting assays and enzyme activity detection all suggested that GlcNAc hydrogel reduce the expression of cleaved-caspase3 and caspase8 (Compared to the sham group, the protein contents were reduced by about 50% in the GlcNAc hydrogel group). We also found that GlcNAc hydrogel activates autophagy through ERK signal pathway. The results of Western blotting indicated that GlcNAc hydrogel increase the levels of LC3B and Becline1 (hydrogel group & sham group, LC3B: 1.56 ± 0.07 & 1.00 ± 0.14; Becline1: 1.98 ± 0.07 & 1.00 ± 0.13). Whereas, the content of P62 reduced after GlcNAc hydrogel treatment, the relative level in sham group and hydrogel group are 1.00 ± 0.02 and 0.73 ± 0.06. Our results revealed that the number of P-ERK positive cells in the hydrogel group (57.36 ± 3.56%) was higher when compared with the sham (24.82 ± 2.72%). And, the ratio of P-ERK and ERK was higher than that in the sham group (1.48 ± 0.07 & 1.00 ± 0.08). The GlcNAc thermosensitive hydrogel is a promising and sustainable drug delivery system for intra-articular injection in the treatment of cartilage injury."

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of O-linked-N-acetylglucosaminylation (O-GlcNAc) on GlcN-induced ROS production and Nrf2 expression in human dermal microvascular endothelial cells-1 (HMEC-1) and to evaluate the antioxidant capacity of GlcN compared to well-known antioxidants. For this, we evaluate the antioxidant capacity by in vitro assays. Besides, the GlcN (5-20 mM) effects on cell viability, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, O-GlcNAc, and nuclear factor erythroid-2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) expression with and without the O-GlcNAc inhibitor OSMI-1 (10 μM) in HMEC-1 were evaluated. GlcN showed high inhibitory concentration (low scavenging activity) against superoxide (O2•─, IC20 = 47.67 mM), 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH•, IC50 = 21.32 mM), and hydroxyl (HO•, IC50 = 14.04 mM) radicals without scavenging activity against hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and low antioxidant capacity determined by oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC, 0.001 mM Trolox equivalent) and ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP, 0.046 mM Trolox equivalent). In cell culture, GlcN (20 mM) reduced cell viability up to 26 % and induced an increase in ROS production (up to 70 %), O-GlcNAc (4-fold-higher vs. control), and Nrf2 expression (56 %), which were prevented by OSMI-1. These data suggest an association between O-GlcNAc, ROS production, and Nrf2 expression in HMEC-1 cells stimulated with GlcN."

It usually occurs in the elderly and causes a large medical burden. The aim of this study is to evaluate the cost-effectiveness between the standard treatment for osteoarthritis and standard treatment with added crystalline glucosamine sulfate at various stages. Markov analysis modeling was applied to evaluate the effect of both adding glucosamine compared to standard treatment from a societal perspective during whole patients' lifetimes. Data input was collected from reviews in previous studies. The outcome was measured in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and the Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio (ICER) from a societal perspective was applied with 3% and discounted for all costs and outcomes. One-way analysis via the Tornado diagram was performed to investigate the change in factors in the model. In general, adding glucosamine into the standard treatment proved to be more cost-effective compared to the standard treatment. Particularly, the early-stage addition of glucosamine in the treatment was cost-effective compared to the post-stage addition of glucosamine. The addition of supplementing crystalline glucosamine sulfate to the whole regimen at any stage was cost-effective at the willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold."

The cost of treating an aging population places pressure on the healthcare budget. As a result, it is imperative to evaluate medicines' cost-effectiveness and, accordingly, their influence on health resource allocation. Our study aims to summarize the cost and outcome of utilizing glucosamine in OA treatment. Databases like Medline, Cochrane, and Scopus were searched as part of the identification process up until April 2023. Our primary inclusion criteria centered on the economic evaluation of glucosamine in OA treatments, providing an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). The Quality of Health Economic Studies (QHES) instrument was applied to grade the quality of the studies. Seven qualified studies that discussed the cost-effectiveness of glucosamine with or without other formulations were selected. All of them demonstrated that glucosamine was cost-effective. There was an increase in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) when incorporating glucosamine in conventional care. Moreover, patented crystalline glucosamine sulfate (pCGS) was more cost-effective than the other formulations of glucosamine (OFG). Overall, utilizing pCGS was more beneficial than using OFG in terms both of cost and quality of life."

The purpose of the present study was to investigate the efficacy of crystalline glucosamine sulfate (CGS) in patients with knee OA. This open-label prospective study (with a 12-month follow-up) included 111 patients of both genders suffering from knee OA, who attended the Special Hospital for Rheumatic Diseases in Novi Sad, Serbia during the 2011-2013 period. Patients were divided into the experimental (n=52) and the control (n=59) group. While the former was prescribed CGS 1500 mg/day, the latter was treated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) according to the standard protocol. The efficacy of both treatment modes was assessed using the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) and Lequesne index, along with the radiological findings which involved knee joint space width (JSW) measurements. One year following the initial assessment, all patients reported pain intensity reduction; however, those in the CGS group experienced significantly lower pain intensity when compared with controls. At the end of the study, no reduction in the progression of joint structure damage (p>0.5) was noted in either group. Thus, while CGS demonstrated symptomatic efficacy, it failed to delay the progression of knee OA.",

From the beginning through March 2023, the papers were checked, and if they fulfilled the inclusion criteria, they were then examined. The Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis (WOMAC) and Visual Analog Scale (VAS) scales were considered the main outcome measures. A total of 15 studies were selected. Global pain was significantly decreased in comparison to placebo, as measured by the VAS index, with an overall effect size of standardized mean difference (SMD) of -7.41 ([95% CI] 14.31, 0.51). The WOMAC scale confirmed that pain, stiffness, and physical function had improved, however the effects were insufficient. A statistical update also revealed that there were no reports of serious medication interactions or significant adverse events. To summarize, glucosamine is more effective than a placebo at reducing pain in knee osteoarthritis patients. In long-term treatment, oral glucosamine sulfate 1500 mg/day is believed to be well tolerated."

      "abstract": "Tumour hypoxia plays an important role in modulating tumorigenesis, angiogenesis, invasion, immunosuppression, resistance to treatment, and even maintenance of the stemness of cancer stem cells (CSCs). Moreover, the targeting and treatment of hypoxic cancer cells and CSCs to reduce the influence of tumor hypoxia on cancer therapy remains an imperative clinical problem that needs to be addressed. Since cancer cells upregulate the expression of glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) through the Warburg effect, we considered the possibility of GLUT1-mediated transcytosis in cancer cells and developed a tumor hypoxia-targeting nanomedicine. Our experimental results indicate that glucosamine-labeled liposomal ceramide can be efficiently transported between cancer cells by GLUT1 transporters and substantially accumulated in the hypoxic area in in vitro CSC spheroids and in vivo tumor xenografts. We also verified the effects of exogenous ceramide on tumor hypoxia, including important bioactivities such as upregulation of p53 and retinoblastoma protein (RB), downregulation of hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1α) expression, disruption of the OCT4-SOX2 network of stemness, and inhibition of CD47 and PD-L1 expression. To achieve an ideal therapeutic outcome, we combined treatment of glucosamine-labeled liposomal ceramide with paclitaxel and carboplatin, and we found an excellent synergistic effect, with tumor clearance being noted in three-fourths of the mice. Overall, our findings provide a potential therapeutic strategy for the treatment of cancer.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association between regular glucosamine intake and heart failure (HF) and to explore whether the association is mediated by relevant cardiovascular disease. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We included 479,650 participants with data available for supplement use and without HF at baseline from the UK Biobank study. Using 12 single-nucleotide polymorphisms linked to HF, a weighted genetic risk score was calculated. We evaluated the association between glucosamine use and HF by Cox regression models after inverse probability of treatment weighting. A validation and mediation analysis were performed through two-sample Mendelian randomization. The study was from May 18, 2006, to February 16, 2018. RESULTS: During a median follow-up of 9.0 (IQR, 8.3-9.8) years, we documented 5501 incident cases of HF. In multivariable analysis, the HR of glucosamine users for HF was 0.87 (95% CI, 0.81 to 0.94). The inverse associations were stronger in males and participants with unfavorable lifestyle (P<.05 for interaction). Genetic risk categories did not modify this association (P>.05 for interaction). Multivariable Mendelian randomization showed that taking glucosamine was protective against HF (HR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.87 to 0.96). The mediated proportion of coronary heart disease and stroke were 10.5% (95% CI, 7.6% to 13.4%) and 14.4% (95% CI, 10.8% to 18.0%), respectively. The two-mediator combination accounted for 22.7% (95% CI, 17.2% to 28.2%) of the effect of glucosamine use. CONCLUSION: Regular glucosamine supplementation was associated with a lower risk of HF regardless of genetic risk status, and to a lesser extent, coronary heart disease and stroke mediated this effect. The results may inform novel pathway for prevention and intervention toward HF.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Oral treatment of glucosamine (GA) combined with chondroitin sulfate (CS) was reportedly effective for pain relief and function improvement in osteoarthritis patients with moderate to severe knee pain in clinical trials. While the effectiveness of GA and CS on both clinical and radiological findings has been demonstrated, only a few high-quality trials exist. Therefore, controversy regarding their effectiveness in real-world clinical practice remains. AIM: To investigate the impact of GA + CS on clinical outcomes of patients with knee and hip osteoarthritis in routine clinical practice. METHODS: A multicenter prospective observational cohort study included 1102 patients of both genders with knee or hip osteoarthritis (Kellgren & Lawrence grades I-III) in 51 clinical centers in the Russian Federation from November 20, 2017, to March 20, 2020, who had started to receive oral capsules of glucosamine hydrochloride 500 mg and CS 400 mg according to the approved patient information leaflet starting from 3 capsules daily for 3 wk, followed by a reduced dosage of 2 capsules daily before study inclusion (minimal recommended treatment duration is 3-6 mo). Changes in subscale scores [Pain, Symptoms, Function, and Quality of Life (QOL)] of the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS)/Hip Disability and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (HOOS) questionnaires during the observational period (up to 54-64 wk with a total of 4 visits). Patients' treatment satisfaction, data on the combined oral use of glucosamine hydrochloride and CS, concomitant use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and adverse events (AEs) were also evaluated. RESULTS: A total of 1102 patients with knee and hip osteoarthritis were included in the study. The mean patient age was 60.4 years, most patients were women (87.8%), and their average body mass index was 29.49 kg/m2. All subscale scores (Pain, Symptoms, Function, and QOL) of the KOOS and HOOS demonstrated clinically and statistically significant improvements. In patients with knee osteoarthritis, the mean score increases from baseline to the end of Week 64 were 22.87, 20.78, 16.60, and 24.87 on Pain, Symptoms, Physical Function (KOOS-PS), and QOL subscales (P < 0.001 for all), respectively. In patients with hip osteoarthritis, the mean score increases were 22.81, 19.93, 18.77, and 22.71 on Pain, Symptoms, Physical Function (HOOS-PS), and QOL subscales (P < 0.001 for all), respectively. The number of patients using any NSAIDs decreased from 43.1% to 13.5% (P < 0.001) at the end of the observation period. Treatment-related AEs occurred in 2.8% of the patients and mainly included gastrointestinal disorders [25 AEs in 24 (2.2%) patients]. Most patients (78.1%) were satisfied with the treatment. CONCLUSION: Long-term oral GA + CS was associated with decreased pain, reduced concomitant NSAID therapy, improved joint function and QOL in patients with knee and hip osteoarthritis in routine clinical practice."

      "abstract": "Osteoarthritis (OA) is an inflammatory disease that affects the cartilage and tissues around the joints, which results in excessive pain and stiffness. One of the most critical challenges for improving the therapeutic effect in OA treatments is the current drug design utilizing functional polymers. Indeed, there is a need to design and develop novel therapeutic drugs for positive outcomes. In this view, glucosamine sulfate is a drug used to manage OA because of its potential therapeutic effects on cartilage and ability to inhibit disease progression. This research aims to develop a keratin/chitosan/glucosamine sulfate (KRT/CS/GLS) composite loaded functionalized multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) as a potential carrier for the treatment of OA. The nanocomposite was developed using various ratios of KRT/CS/GLS, and MWCNT. Molecular docking analysis has been performed with (D-glucosamine) and targeted proteins (Protein Data Bank ID: 1HJV, 1ALU) to determine the binding affinity and interactions. Field emission scanning electron microscopy study showed that the composite KRT/CS/GLS incorporated on the surface of functionalized MWCNTs effectively. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy analysis confirmed the presence of KRT/CS/GLS in the nanocomposite and remained intact. X-ray diffraction analysis indicated that the nature of the composite in MWCNT transformed from a crystalline to an amorphous state. Thermo gravimetric analysis revealed that the nanocomposite has a high thermal decomposition temperature of 420 °C. The MTT assay results showed that 83% of cell viability has remained in RAW 264.7 cells at the maximum concentration (500 μg ml-1) of MWCNT-GLS/KRT/CS nanocomposite. Also, molecular docking results revealed the excellent binding affinity of D-glucosamine to each protein structure (PDB ID: 1HJV and 1ALU).",

The SF-APSP micelles were prepared using the thin film hydration method and characterized by various techniques. In vitro release experiments showed that the cumulative release of SF-APSP micelles in the simulated tumor microenvironment (pH 7.4 with GSH) reached 94.76 ± 1.78% at 48 h, while it was only 20.32 ± 1.67% in the normal physiological environment (pH 7.4 without GSH). The in vitro study revealed that glucosamine (AG) enhanced the antitumor effects of SF, and SF-APSP micelles inhibited proliferation by targeting HepG2 cells and suppressing cyclin D1 expression. The in vivo antitumor efficacy study further confirmed that the SF-APSP micelles had excellent antitumor effects and better tolerance against nude mouse with HepG2 cells than other treatment groups. All in all, these results indicated that SF-APSP micelles could be a promising drug delivery system for anti-hepatoma treatment.",

The hexosamine biosynthetic pathway (HBP) is a branch of glucose metabolism that affects circadian rhythms through the O-linked N-acetylglucosamine modification (O-GlcNAcylation) of clock proteins. Here, we found out that, among the downstream metabolites regulated by d-glucosamine (GlcN) in HBP salvage pathway, only GlcN is able to induce circadian phase delay both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistic studies indicated that the phase-shift induced by GlcN is independent of O-GlcNAcylation. Instead, GlcN selectively up-regulates p-AMPK activity, leading to the inhibition of mTOR signaling pathway, and thus down-regulation of p-BMAL1 both in human cell line and mouse tissues. Moreover, GlcN promoted BMAL1 degradation via proteasome pathway. These findings reveal a novel molecular mechanism of GlcN in regulating clock phase and suggest the therapeutic potential of GlcN as new use for an old drug in the future treatment of shift work and circadian misalignment.",

METHODS: RA rat models were effectively developed 14 days after CFA injection, and then garaged with GS, CS and GC. Body weight and paw volume of rats were monitored at multiple time points at the beginning of CFA injection. Until D36, serum and ankle tissue specimens were used to measure levels of circulating inflammatory factors (TNF-α, IL-1β, MMP-3, NO and PGE2) and local inflammatory indicators (TLR-4 and NF-κB). On D18, D25, and D36, intergroup gut microbiota was compared using 16S rRNA gene sequencing and bioinformatics analysis. We also performed the correlation analysis of gut bacteria, joint swelling and inflammatory indicators. RESULTS: GC, rather than GS and CS, could reduce right paw volumes, levels of TLR-4 and NF-κB in synovial tissues. In addition, enriched genera in RA model rats screened out by LEfSe analysis could be inhibited by GC intervention, including potential LPS-producing bacteria (Enterobacter, Bacteroides, Erysipelotrichaceae_unclassified and Erysipelotrichaceae_uncultured) and some other opportunistic pathogens (Esherichia_Shigella, Nosocomiicoccus, NK4A214_group, Odoribacter, Corynebacterium and Candidatus_Saccharimonas.etc.) that positively correlated with pro-inflammatory cytokines, right paw volume, and pathology scores. Furthermore, the gut microbiota dysbiosis was observed to recover before alleviating joint swelling after interventions. CONCLUSIONS: GC could inhibit potential LPS-producing bacteria and the activation of TLR-4/NF-κB pathway in RA rats, thus alleviating RA-induced joint injury."

We used the public costs of glucosamine products available in Thailand in 2019 to calculate the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio. We separated the analyses for prescription-grade crystalline glucosamine sulfate (pCGS) and other formulations of glucosamine. A cost-effectiveness cut-off of 3.260 USD/QALY was considered. RESULTS: Irrespective of the glucosamine preparation (tablet or powder/capsule), the data show that pCGS is cost-effective compared with placebo over a 3 and 6 months. However, the other glucosamine formulations (e.g., glucosamine hydrochloride) never reached the breakeven point at any time. CONCLUSIONS: Our data show that pCGS is cost-effective for the management of osteoarthritis in the Thai context while other glucosamine formulations are not."

Due to its anti-aging, antioxidative, bacteriostatic, anti-inflammatory, immuno-stimulating, pro-anabolic and anti-catabolic properties, oral glucosamine seems to be a potentially very effective agent in the treatment of TMJ OA. The aim of this review was to critically assess the efficacy of oral glucosamine in the treatment of TMJ OA on the basis of the literature. PubMed and Scopus databases were analyzed with the keywords: (temporomandibular joints) AND ((disorders) OR (osteoarthritis)) AND (treatment) AND (glucosamine). After the screening of 50 results, eight studies have been included in this review. Oral glucosamine is one of the symptomatic slow-acting drugs for osteoarthritis. There is not enough scientific evidence to unambiguously confirm the clinical effectiveness of glucosamine supplements in the treatment of TMJ OA on the basis of the literature. The most important aspect affecting the clinical efficacy of oral glucosamine in the treatment of TMJ OA was the total administration time. Administration of oral glucosamine for a longer period of time, i.e., 3 months, led to a significant reduction in TMJ pain and a significant increase in maximum mouth opening. It also resulted in long-term anti-inflammatory effects within the TMJs. Further long-term, randomized, double-blind studies, with a unified methodology, ought to be performed to draw the general recommendations for the use of oral glucosamine in the treatment of TMJ OA.",

This study evaluated the effectiveness of glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate, marine based fatty acid compounds (PCSO-524 and EAB-277), and carprofen for the alleviation of canine hip OA pain. This was a prospective, block-randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trial. METHODS: Seventy-five owned pet dogs with hip OA were assigned randomly into five treatment groups: PCSO-524, Glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate, EAB-277, carprofen, and Placebo (sunflower oil). Peak vertical force (PVF) and subjective orthopedic assessment scores (OAS) were evaluated before treatment (week 0), and at weeks 2, 4, and 6 during treatment. RESULTS: At week 2, the carprofen group showed a significant increase in PVF (3.14 ± 5.33; mean ± SD). After 4 weeks, the increases in PVF of the PCSO-524 (3.90 ± 3.52), EAB-277 (4.17 ± 4.94), and carprofen (3.08 ± 5.87) groups were significant, and significantly greater than placebo (0.08 ± 1.90) and glucosamine (-0.05 ± 6.34) groups. After 6 weeks, the change of PVF in the PCSO-524 (4.14 ± 4.65), EAB-277 (4.45 ± 4.23), and carprofen (4.21 ± 6.52) groups were significant and significantly higher than the placebo group (-0.33 ± 3.65). The change in PVF in the glucosamine group (1.08 ± 5.49) lay between the placebo group and the other treatment groups. The OAS did not show any significant change in any group. DISCUSSION: PCSO-524 and EAB-277, but not glucosamine/chondroitin, resulted in significant improvements in PVF from baseline after 4 weeks, and 6 weeks, and to a similar degree to that seen with carprofen."

METHODS: Retrospectively, 116 KOA patients admitted between August 2018 and August 2021 were selected. Among them, 55 cases received DIA monotherapy (control group, Con) and 61 cases received DIA + GlcN·HCl (observation group, Obs). The efficacy, safety, scores of Lequesne Index, and Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), as well as the levels of IFs of the two groups were observed and compared. Further, Cox regression was used to perform an in-depth analysis of factors influencing the occurrence of complications in patients with KOA. RESULTS: The analyses revealed a higher overall response rate and a lower adverse event rate in the Obs group compared with the Con group, with statistical significance. Decreased scores of Lequesne Index and VAS and levels of IFs were determined in the Obs after treatment, which were all significantly lower compared with those of the Con. Cox regression analysis identified that TNF-α, IL-1β, hs-CRP, and treatment mode affected the occurrence of complications in KOA patients. CONCLUSIONS: DIA + GlcN·HCl can significantly inhibit the inflammation level in KOA, with definite curative effects and a favorable safety profile."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study included 36 patients aged 10-13 years with skeletal Class II malocclusion due to retrusion of the mandible characterized by: 4-8 degrees of the sagittal skeletal discrepancy (ANB) angle, 4-7 mm of overjet, 72-76 degrees of the sagittal mandibular positioning (SNB) angle, and a bone maturity stage located at pubertal growth spurt. Patients were distributed to the experimental group (Twin-Block appliance + Jointance® gel) or the control group (conventional treatment with the Twin-Block appliance). An allocation ratio of 1:1 was employed. Pre- and post-treatment digital lateral cephalometric radiograms were taken, and the TMJ joint spaces were measured using the Viewbox software (dHAL Software, Kifissia, Greece). The pain and discomfort levels were evaluated using a questionnaire with a four-point Likert scale at three assessment times. RESULTS:  The anterior and posterior glenoid and anterior condylar distances to the pterygoid vertical (PTV) reference plane significantly decreased after treatment (p<.001), and the anterior joint space decreased significantly (p<.001). In contrast, the superior distance of the condyle to the Frankfort horizontal reference plane increased significantly after treatment, and the same results were found for the posterior and superior joint spaces (p<.05). There were no significant differences between the two groups in the evaluated linear variables. No significant differences were found when comparing pain and tension levels between the two groups at each assessment time. A gradual decrease in pain and tension levels was observed between the three evaluation times in both groups. CONCLUSIONS:  A combination of glucosamine sulfate and chondroitin sulfate did not affect the temporomandibular joint spaces, pain, and tension levels in patients with skeletal Class II malocclusions treated by removable functional appliances."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Osteoarthritis (OA) pain is the number one cause of chronic pain in dogs. Multimodal treatment, including combining safe and effective nutritional interventions with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), is currently considered one of the most appropriate choices for managing OA pain. Palmitoyl-glucosamine is a feed material belonging to the ALIAmide family, whose parent molecule is the prohomeostatic lipid amide N-palmitoyl-ethanolamine. Curcumin is a promising plant antioxidant. The present study aimed at investigating whether 18-week dietary integration with palmitoyl-glucosamine co-micronized with curcumin was able to maintain pain relief in dogs with OA-associated chronic pain receiving meloxicam (1.5 mg/ml oral suspension) on a tapering regimen (progressive 25% decrease of the original 0.1 mg/kg/day dose, on a biweekly basis) during the first 8 weeks of treatment. Pain was assessed both by the owners and veterinary surgeons, with the first using both subjective evaluation and validated metrology instruments-i.e., Helsinki Chronic Pain Index (HCPI) and Canine Brief Pain Inventory (CBPI)-while the second rating the severity of lameness and pain on palpation on two previously used 5-point scales. RESULTS: A total of fifty-eight dogs with OA chronic pain entered the uncontrolled study. Pain on HCPI was considered severe at baseline (range 18-39). Based on owner's assessment, 90% of dogs who responded to meloxicam at the full-dose regimen could reduce meloxicam up to 25% of the original dose without experiencing pain worsening. Moreover, 75% of dogs was assessed as having no pain increase ten weeks after meloxicam withdrawal. A statistically significant decrease of pain severity as scored by HCPI (P < 0.0001) was observed two and ten weeks after meloxicam withdrawal compared to study entry (17.0 ± 1.05 and 15.1 ± 1.02, respectively, vs 29.0 ± 0.74; mean ± SEM). After meloxicam withdrawal, no statistically significant change in the CBPI scores was recorded. Pain on palpation and lameness significantly changed to less severe distributions along the study period (P < 0.0001). CONCLUSION: The findings appear to suggest that dietary integration with palmitoyl-glucosamine co-micronized with curcumin was able to maintain meloxicam-induced pain relief in dogs with severe OA chronic pain.",

      "abstract": "An essential component of joint quality is cartilage. Therefore, the protection of this is a prerequisite for maintaining the condition of each joint. The assessment of the presence of articular cartilage is shown by X-ray of both joints in the standing position. Cartilage protection is possible for 1, 2 and 3 degree of cartilage damage according to the Kellgren and Lawrence scale.The challenge for the physician is to identify the cause of OA in accordance with the principles of Evidence Based Orthopedics/Traumatology, and not merely treat symptomatically, which is usually ineffective.In order to objectively present treatment methods, indications and the period of their implementation, it is biologically reasonable to refer to the needs of cartilage tissue resulting from the analysis of the causes of its damage and indications for justified methods of its protection.Biomechanical and biological elements are important in the process of implementing articular cartilage protection.The biomechanical elements are: limb axis disorders, differences in length, distortions at the level of the support quadrilateral, pelvic triangle and shoulder triangle, as well as balance disorders resulting from disturbances in the segmental proportion of the Fi number according to Leonardo da Vinci.There are many biological elements of the discussed disorder and they concern: the state of articular cartilage structure, matrix structure, matrix biophysical elements, molecular sponge mechanism, chondrocytes, cartilage nutrition and the severity of osteoarthritis (OA).The improvement of the conditions of the biological elements of damaged articular cartilage is considered fundamental and concerns the positive impact on numerous cartilage matrix proteins by chondroprotection. This element of treatment consists in the use of chondroitin sulphate and glucosamine as a drug, administered together in the appropriate dose and for a long time depending on the degree of degradation of the articular cartilage, usually from several to several months. The combination of chondroitin sulfate with glucosamine causes the activation of a much larger number of matrix proteins than each of the preparations separately.The pharmacokinetics of chondroitin sulfate and glucosamine are positive and favor their chondroprotective effect.The pharmacoproteomics of chondroitin sulfate and glucosamine administered together result from the activation of as many joint cartilage matrix proteins as possible. The development of proteomic techniques creates completely new therapeutic possibilities and is used to study the action of individual molecules.A clinically significant fact is that both chondroitin and glucosamine are natural, endogenous components of bone tissue and articular cartilage, so the use of both drugs is biologically compatible and results in numerous elements of cartilage protection.",

In this study, the radioprotective ability of glucosamine was evaluated against radiation-induced genotoxicity and cytotoxicity in human peripheral blood lymphocytes. Blood samples were collected from five healthy male donors and were divided into four groups. Isolated lymphocytes and blood samples were treated with 10 µM of glucosamine for 2 h before exposure to 2 Gy radiation. The radioprotective potential of glucosamine was assessed by micronucleus assay, reactive oxygen species (ROS) level analysis, and flow cytometry. Irradiation significantly increased the micronuclei frequency as compared to the control group. Contrary to that pretreatment with glucosamine before irradiation significantly reduced the frequency of micronuclei. Furthermore, pretreatment with glucosamine significantly prevented the percentage of apoptotic lymphocytes. Also, glucosamine pretreatment significantly reduced the production of ROS in irradiated lymphocytes. This study shows glucosamine to be a potent radioprotector against radiation that induces DNA damage and apoptosis in human lymphocytes. Several additional in vivo and in vitro studies are needed before glucosamine can be considered as a radioprotective candidate in patients undergoing radiation therapy.",

However, its consequences in such patients concomitantly suffering from diabetic nephropathy is unknown. METHODS: The aim of the study was to investigate the effect of exogenous administration of glucosamine in the diabetic kidney. A mouse model of streptozotocin-induced diabetic nephropathy in vivo and cultured endothelial cells in vitro were used in the study. The mice were treated with glucosamine for 6 months. Renal function was evaluated by metabolic cage, and histology of the kidney was estimated by periodic acid-schiff (PAS) staining. The expression of related genes was assessed by real-time PCR, immunofluorescence staining, immunoblotting and ELISA. RESULTS: There was no significant difference in urinary albumin secretion, relative kidney weight, or creatinine clearance between the groups treated with glucosamine and controls. Assessment of the kidney demonstrated reduction in mesangial expansion and fibronectin expression in the diabetic glomeruli treated with glucosamine. Glucosamine treatment significantly decreased α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) protein expression in both diabetic and control kidneys, whereas the expression of other fibrosis-related genes and inflammatory factors was unaltered. Moreover, α-SMA colocalized with the endothelial marker CD31 in the diabetic and control kidneys, and glucosamine reduced α-SMA+ ECs in the diabetic glomeruli. In addition, glucosamine suppressed α-SMA expression in endothelial cells treated with or without high glucose. DISCUSSION: In summary, this is the first report to show that glucosamine reduces mesangial expansion and inhibits endothelial-mesenchymal transition in diabetic nephropathy. The underlying mechanisms need to be further investigated."

In parallel, the disease-modifying effects of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in knee OA have also been investigated. However, limited literature has reported the combined effect of GS and NSAIDs. The aim of this scoping review is to describe the scope and volume of the literature investigating the potential benefits and synergistic effect of a combination of GS and NSAIDs in patients with knee OA. METHODS: PubMed and Embase were searched for studies published from inception through April 2022, evaluating the effects of the combination of GS and NSAIDs in OA patients, versus either treatment alone. Data are reported narratively. RESULTS: Five studies were included in this review; 4 were randomized control trials and one was a prospective observational study. The duration of combination treatment was 6 to 12 weeks. The combination was compared to celecoxib in 2 studies, meloxicam in 1, etoricoxib in 1, and a conventional NSAID in 1 (ibuprofen or piroxicam). All 5 studies reported that in patients with knee OA, the combination of GS plus NSAID yielded a significantly greater benefit than single-agent therapy, in terms of outcomes including pain reduction, function, joint stiffness, and markers of inflammatory activity and cartilage degradation. CONCLUSION: The 5 studies included in this scoping review all report a significantly greater clinical benefit with a combination of GS plus NSAID compared to either treatment alone. The evidence supports efficacy in reducing pain, improving function, and possibly regulating joint damage. However, further randomized trials with larger sample sizes are warranted to confirm these findings.",

The pregnant mice were randomly divided into one of the four groups, such as the control group, the ZEA group, the GlcN group, and the GlcN plus ZEA group. Reproductive toxicity was induced by consecutive gavages of ZEA at 5 mg/kg body weight during gestational days (GDs 0-14) and in the presence or absence of oral administration of GlcN (0.5 mM). The results showed that GlcN significantly alleviated the decrease of growth performance induced by ZEA exposure of pregnant mice. Meanwhile, ZEA ingestion significantly reduced the number and weight of fetuses, and reduction of placenta weight. Moreover, results of blood biochemical markers indicated that ZEA exposure led to increased oxidative stress levels in pregnant mice. Further analyses demonstrated that ZEA inhibited placental development, resulted in placental inflammation, increased the expression of pro-apoptotic proteins, and decreased the expression of placental tight junction proteins, which were reversed by the administration of GlcN. Results of western blot revealed that GlcN reversed ZEA-mediated phenotype by activating PI3K, while inhibiting MAPK signaling pathway. All these findings showed that GlcN was effective in the protection against ZEA-induced placental dysfunction and reproductive toxicity in pregnant mice. Supplementation of GlcN might be potential nutritional intervention with an ability to alleviate ZEA-induced toxicity in pregnant mice.",

Thin Film Rotary method was use to prepare transfersomes, and characterization was carried out physio-chemically using electron microscopic studies, zeta potential evaluation, entrapment efficiency studies. To add on in the stability, development of a secondary topical vehicle using Carbopol 940 was carried out to enhance the shelf life of transfersomes. Furthermore, in vivo studies on rabbits were also carried out using the papain induced arthritis model to support the effectiveness of treatment. The radiology studies of knee joint of rabbits proved the effectiveness of glucosamine loaded transfersomes in healing the osteoarthritis with the blood plasma analysis remain unaltered.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Senile osteoporosis (SOP) is one of the most prevalent diseases that afflict the elderly population, which characterized by decreased osteogenic ability. Glucosamine (GlcN) is an over-the-counter dietary supplement. Our previous study reported that GlcN promotes osteoblast proliferation by activating autophagy in vitro. The purpose of this study is to determine the effects and mechanisms of GlcN on senile osteoporosis and osteogenic differentiation in vivo. METHODS: Aging was induced by subcutaneous injection of D-Galactose (D-Gal), and treated with GlcN or vehicle. The anti-senile-osteoporosis effect of GlcN was explored by examining changes in micro-CT, serum indicators, body weight, protein and gene expression of aging and apoptosis. Additionally, the effects of GlcN on protein and gene expression of osteogenesis and autophagy were observed by inhibiting autophagy with 3-methyladenine (3-MA). RESULTS: GlcN significantly improved bone mineral density (BMD) and bone micro-architecture, decreased skeletal senescence and apoptosis and increased osteogenesis in D-Gal induced osteoporotic mice. While all effect was reversed with 3-MA. CONCLUSION: GlcN effectively delayed the progression of osteoporosis in senile osteoporotic mice by promoting osteoblast autophagy. This study suggested that GlcN may be a prospective candidate drug for the treatment of SOP."

      "abstract": "Antibiotics are detected worldwide in the aquatic environment, with continuously rising concentrations. Antibiotics in the environment have the potential to damage ecosystems and contribute to the development of resistance. Whilst a few antibiotics, such as some β-lactams, are eliminated by effluent treatment, others, such as fluoroquinolones, are not or just partially removed and enter the environment. Therefore, approaches are needed to tackle those problems at the compound level. Benign by design (BbD), an important part of green pharmacy, has the goal to integrate environmental fate and end-of-use considerations at the very beginning, i.e., into the design of active pharmaceutical ingredients. Hence, pharmaceuticals should be designed to be sufficiently active and stable during storage and usage but should degrade after excretion into the environment, so that they cannot cause any adverse effects. Fluoroquinolones (FQs) are important broad-spectrum antibiotics. They are known to be persistent in the environment and to be neither inactivated nor degraded or even mineralized during sewage treatment. The addition of new substituents via amidation, like glucosamine moieties, at the carboxylic group of FQs, led to better antimicrobial activity compared to its parent compounds against various microorganisms. To investigate if the addition of sugar moieties could improve the overall environmental biodegradability of FQs, eight novel quinolone and fluoroquinolone analogs conjugated with 1,3,4,6-Tetra-O-acetyl-β-d-glucosamine and 2-deoxy-d-glucopyranose have been investigated regarding their ready biodegradability (OECD 301D/F) and their degradation pathways have been analyzed. According to the OECD 301D test, none of the substances could be classified as readily biodegradable. However, the O-acetyl analogs did undergo a partial degradation of the O-acetyl glucosamine moiety, via stepwise deacetylation and the degradation of the whole glucosamine moiety. The degradation resulted in Fluoroquinolone-3-carboxamide derivatives. Those insights could be further used as input for fragment-based design of benign APIs that will degrade once they reached the environment.",

METHODS: A parallel-design, double-blind randomised controlled trial was conducted from January to September 2020 at the Foundation University Institute of Rehabilitation Sciences and Fauji Foundation Hospital, Rawalpindi, Pakistan, and comprised of knee osteoarthritis patients of either gender having radiological evidence of grade III or less on Kellgren classification. The subjects were randomly allocated to active comparator group A and experimental group B. Both the groups received manual therapy and resistance exercise training, while group B additionally received glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate supplementation for 4 weeks. Study outcomes included pain, function, quality of life, range of motion, strength, fall risk, skeletal muscle mass, visceral fat area, body fat, intracellular water ratio, and segmental lean and fat mass. Data was analysed using SPSS 21. RESULTS: Of the 24 subjects, there were 12(50%) in each of the two groups. Each groups had 9(75%) males and 3(25%) females. In terms knee osteoarthritis grade, there was no significant difference between the groups (p=1.00). No significant differences were observed in any of the outcome measures neither at 2 weeks, nor at 4 weeks post-intervention between the groups (p>0.05) except for percentage change in segmental lean mass of the right leg at 2nd week and of the left leg at 4th week (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Manual therapy and resistance exercise training are effective in the management of knee osteoarthritis, however, glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate supplementation for 4 weeks showed no additional benefits.

      "abstract": "Glucosamine is widely used around the world and as a popular dietary supplement and treatment in patients with osteoarthritis in China; however, the real-world cardiovascular risk of glucosamine in long-term use is still unclear. A retrospective, population-based cohort study was performed, based on the Beijing Medical Claim Data for Employees from 1 January 2010 to 31 December 2017. Patients newly diagnosed with osteoarthritis were selected and divided into glucosamine users and non- glucosamine users. The glucosamine users group was further divided into adherent, partially adherent, and non-adherent groups according to the medication adherence. New-onset cardiovascular diseases (CVD) events, coronary heart diseases (CHD), and stroke, were identified during the observational period. COX proportional regression models were used to estimate the risks. Of the 685,778 patients newly diagnosed with osteoarthritis including 240,419 glucosamine users and 445,359 non-users, the mean age was 56.49 (SD: 14.45) years and 59.35% were females. During a median follow-up of 6.13 years, 64,600 new-onset CVD, 26,530 CHD, and 17,832 stroke events occurred. Glucosamine usage was significantly associated with CVD (HR: 1.10; 95% CI: 1.08−1.11) and CHD (HR: 1.12; 95% CI: 1.09−1.15), but not with stroke (HR: 1.03; 95% CI: 0.99−1.06). The highest CVD risk was shown in the adherent group (HR: 1.68; 95% CI: 1.59−1.78), followed by the partially adherent group (HR: 1.26, 95% CI: 1.22−1.30), and the non-adherent group (HR: 1.03; 95% CI: 1.02−1.05), with a significant dose−response relationship (p-trend < 0.001). In this longitudinal study, adherent usage of glucosamine was significantly associated with a higher risk for cardiovascular diseases in patients with osteoarthritis.",

OBJECTIVE: To clarify the clinical efficacy of glucosamine (GlcN) plus sodium hyaluronate (SH) for OP complicated by KOA (OP + KOA) and its influence on joint function and bone metabolic markers (BMMs). METHODS: Admitted from July 2019 to July 2021, 126 patients with OP + KOA were selected, including 76 cases (observation group) treated with GlcN plus SH and 50 cases (control group) given GlcN alone. The pain, joint function, BMMs, and clinical efficacy were evaluated and compared. Pain and joint function assessments employed the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) and the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) plus Lysholm Knee Scoring Scale, respectively. BMMs mainly measured bone gla protein (BGP), serum tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase variant (TRACP)-5b, type I collagen cross-linked C-telopeptide (CTX-1), and bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BALP). RESULTS: Higher posttreatment VAS scores were determined in observation group as compared to control group; observation group showed lower WOMAC scores of joint function and higher Lysholm scores than control group; in terms of BMMs, TRACP-5b and CTX-1 were lower while BGP and BALP were higher in observation group; the curative effect was also higher in observation group. All the above differences were statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: GlcN plus SH has definite clinical efficacy in the treatment of OP + KOA, which can not only significantly improve patients' joint function and bone metabolism but also relieve pain, with high clinical popularization value.",

      "abstract": "Following a request from the European Commission, the EFSA Panel on Nutrition, Novel Foods and Food Allergens (NDA) was asked to deliver a scientific opinion on the conversion of calcium-l-methylfolate and (6S)-5-methyltetrahydrofolic acid glucosamine salt (collectively called 5-MTHF hereafter) into dietary folate equivalents (DFE). Following a systematic review, the conclusions of the opinion are based on one intervention study in adults for intakes < 400 μg/day and three intervention studies in adults for intakes ≥ 400 μg/day. At intakes below 400 μg/day, folic acid (FA) is assumed to be linearly related to responses of biomarkers of intake and status and is an appropriate comparator for deriving a DFE conversion factor for 5-MTHF. It is proposed to use the same factor as for folic acid for conversion of 5-MTHF into DFE for intakes < 400 μg/day. As such intake levels are unlikely to be exceeded through fortified food consumption, the conversion factor of 1.7 relative to natural food folate (NF) could be applied to 5-MTHF added to foods and to food supplements providing < 400 μg/day. At 400 μg/day, 5-MTHF was found to be more bioavailable than folic acid and a conversion factor of 2 is proposed for this intake level and for higher intakes. The derived DFE equations are DFE = NF + 1.7 × FA + 1.7 × 5-MTHF for fortified foods and food supplements providing intakes < 400 μg/day; and DFE = NF + 1.7 × FA + 2.0 × 5-MTHF for food supplements providing intakes ≥ 400 μg/day. Although this assessment applies to calcium-L-methylfolate and 5-MTHF glucosamine salt, it is considered that the influence of the cation on bioavailability is likely to be within the margin of error of the proposed DFE equations. Therefore, the proposed equations can also be applied to 5-MTHF associated with other cations."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Glucosamine is a widely used supplement to treat joint pain and osteoarthritis despite inconclusive randomized trial results on its effectiveness. In contrast, observational studies associate glucosamine with significant reductions in mortality and cancer incidence. We evaluated the extent of bias, particularly selection bias, to explain these surprising beneficial effects. METHODS: We searched the literature to identify all observational studies reporting on the effect of glucosamine use on major outcomes. RESULTS: We identified 11 observational studies, reporting a mean 16% reduction in all-cause mortality (hazard ratio [HR] 0.84, 95% CI: 0.81-0.87) with glucosamine use, as well as significant reductions in cancer incidence and other major diseases including cardiovascular, respiratory and diabetes. We show that these significant effects can result from selection bias due to collider stratification, as all studies used \"prevalent\" cohorts, where glucosamine use started before cohort entry, and where subjects agreed to join the cohorts. Our illustration of the bias using the UK Biobank publication involving a half-million subjects shows how a true rate ratio of mortality of 1.0 in the population can result in a biased rate ratio of 0.82 in the prevalent cohort. CONCLUSIONS: The observational studies reporting significant reductions in mortality, cancer incidence and other outcomes with glucosamine were affected by selection bias from collider stratification. In the absence of properly conducted observational studies that circumvent this bias by considering \"new users\", the studies to date cannot support the prescription of this supplement as a preventive measure for mortality, cancer, and other chronic diseases.",

      "abstract": "Similar to canine inflammatory enteropathy, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic idiopathic condition characterized by remission periods and recurrent flares in which diarrhea, visceral pain, rectal bleeding/bloody stools, and weight loss are the main clinical symptoms. Intestinal barrier function alterations often persist in the remission phase of the disease without ongoing inflammatory processes. However, current therapies include mainly anti-inflammatory compounds that fail to promote functional symptoms-free disease remission, urging new drug discoveries to handle patients during this step of the disease. ALIAmides (ALIA, autacoid local injury antagonism) are bioactive fatty acid amides that recently gained attention because of their involvement in the control of inflammatory response, prompting the use of these molecules as plausible therapeutic strategies in the treatment of several chronic inflammatory conditions. N-palmitoyl-D-glucosamine (PGA), an under-researched ALIAmide, resulted in being safe and effective in preclinical models of inflammation and pain, suggesting its potential engagement in the treatment of IBD. In our study, we demonstrated that micronized PGA significantly and dose-dependently reduces colitis severity, improves intestinal mucosa integrity by increasing the tight junction proteins expression, and downregulates the TLR-4/NLRP3/iNOS pathway via PPAR-α receptors signaling in DNBS-treated mice. The possibility of clinically exploiting micronized PGA as support for the treatment and prevention of inflammation-related changes in IBD patients would represent an innovative, effective, and safe strategy.",

Herein, an effective linoleic acid (LA) and glucosamine (GlcN) hybrid (LA-GlcN) was synthesized for the treatment of HGSOC. The GlcN was introduced to recognize the glucose transporter 1 (GLUT 1) overexpressed in tumor cells to enhance the uptake of LA-GlcN, and the unsaturated LA was employed to trigger ferroptosis by iron-dependent lipid peroxidation. Since the iron content of HGSOC was ∼5 and 2 times, respectively, higher than that of the normal ovarian cells and low-grade serous ovarian cancer cells, these excess irons make them a good target to enhance the ferroptosis of LA-GlcN. The in vitro study demonstrated that LA-GlcN could selectively kill HGSOC cells without affecting normal cells; the in vivo study revealed that LA-GlcN at the dose of 50 mg kg-1 achieved a comparable tumor inhibition as doxorubicin hydrochloride (4 mg kg-1) while the overall survival of mice was extended largely due to the low toxicity, and when the dose was increased to 100 mg kg-1, the therapeutic outcomes could be improved further. This dietary hybrid which targets the excess endogenous iron to activate ferroptosis represents a promising drug for HGSOC treatment.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: This analysis was aimed at providing evidence-based medicine basis for systematic evaluation of chondroitin combined with glucosamine in the treatment of knee osteoarthritis. METHODS: The randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of chondroitin combined with glucosamine in the treatment of knee osteoarthritis (KOA) were searched in PubMed, EMBASE, ScienceDirect, Cochrane Library, China Knowledge Network Database (CNKI), China VIP Database, Wanfang Database, and China Biomedical Literature Database (CBM) online database. The retrieval time ranges from the database creation to the present. Two investigators gathered the information individually. The risk of bias was assessed using the criteria of the Cochrane back review group. RevMan5.4 statistical software analyzed the selected data. RESULTS: A total of 6 RCT articles were obtained. Overall, 764 samples were evaluated by meta-analysis. The clinical efficacy of chondroitin combined with glucosamine was significantly better than that of routine treatment by meta-analysis. The confidence interval of 95% was (4.86, 17.08) (Z = 6.89, P < 0.00001). The scores of joint pain, tenderness, swelling, and dysfunction in patients with knee osteoarthritis treated with chondroitin combined with glucosamine were significantly lower than those treated with routine treatment. There was no significant difference in the incidence of adverse reactions between chondroitin combined with glucosamine and single treatment of KOA. Due to the small number of documents included in the analysis, it is not suitable to make a funnel chart, but there may be some publication deviation in the analysis. CONCLUSION: Chondroitin combined with glucosamine is more effective than chondroitin or glucosamine alone in the treatment of KOA and deserves clinical promotion. However, this conclusion still needs to be supported by multicenter, high-quality, double-blind, large-sample randomized controlled clinical trials due to the limitations of the six trials included.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To assess the application value of comprehensive rehabilitation therapy plus glucosamine hydrochloride for exercise-induced knee injuries and its effect on knee function. METHODS: A total of 96 patients with an exercise-induced knee injury who were admitted to our hospital from February 2019 to February 202 were recruited and assigned at a ratio of 1 : 1 with matched general information to a control group (n = 45) or an experimental group (n = 51). Both groups of patients received comprehensive rehabilitation therapy, and the patients in the experimental group were daily given additional glucosamine hydrochloride tablets for 8 weeks. RESULTS: The experimental group showed a higher treatment efficacy than the control group (P < 0.001). After the treatment, the VAS scores and C-reactive protein of the two groups showed a decline, with a lower result in the experimental group than in the control group (P < 0.001). The Lysholm knee scores were increased in the two groups after the treatment, and the experimental group had a higher score (P < 0.001). After the treatment, patients of both groups showed reduced five-times-sit-to-stand-test (FTSST) results, with a better outcome obtained in the experimental group (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Comprehensive rehabilitation therapy plus glucosamine hydrochloride effectively improves the clinical efficacy of exercise-induced knee joint injuries and enhances the knee joint rehabilitation of the patients."

      "abstract": "As one of the mycotoxins commonly found in feed and food, zearalenone (ZEA) mainly harms the reproductive functions of humans and animals. In our study, we investigated the protective effects of glucosamine (GlcN) on ZEA-induced apoptosis and oxidative damage of porcine trophectoderm (pTr) cells. Our results showed that 0.5 mmol L-1 GlcN significantly alleviated ZEA-induced decline in pTr cell viability. In addition, GlcN also significantly reversed other toxicity of ZEA to pTr cells, including G2/M phase arrest, DNA damage, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and barrier function disruption. Further studies indicated that GlcN can reduce apoptosis and autophagy in pTr cells in response to ZEA treatment. These results were confirmed by flow cytometry, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and western blotting to detect the expressions of apoptosis and autophagy related proteins. Notably, GlcN activated the expressions of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway related proteins, suggesting that its protective effect on pTr cells may be mediated by the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. To demonstrate this mechanism, we used the PI3K/AKT pathway inhibitor wortmannin to pretreat pTr cells, and showed that the protective effect of GlcN on ZEA-induced pTr cytotoxicity was eliminated. In conclusion, GlcN was able to alleviate ZEA-induced toxic effects in pTr cells. This study also provides a theoretical basis for GlcN alleviating the adverse effects of ZEA on early embryo development and proved its potential application prospects.",

To test this approach, we generated a novel HgsnatP304L mouse model expressing misfolded HGSNAT Pro304Leu variant. HgsnatP304L mice present deficits in short-term and working/spatial memory 2-4 mo earlier than previously described constitutive knockout Hgsnat-Geo mice. HgsnatP304L mice also show augmented severity of neuroimmune response, synaptic deficits, and neuronal storage of misfolded proteins and gangliosides compared with Hgsnat-Geo mice. Expression of misfolded human Pro311Leu HGSNAT protein in cultured hippocampal Hgsnat-Geo neurons further reduced levels of synaptic proteins. Memory deficits and majority of brain pathology were rescued in mice receiving HGSNAT chaperone, glucosamine. Our data for the first time demonstrate dominant-negative effects of misfolded HGSNAT Pro304Leu variant and show that they are treatable by oral administration of glucosamine. This suggests that patients affected with mutations preventing normal folding of the enzyme can benefit from chaperone therapy.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Combined chondroitin sulfate (CS) and glucosamine (GlcN) has been widely used in oral formulations to prevent and treat osteoarthritis. CS is effective for controlling pain in osteoarthritic patients, whereas GlcN can stimulate glycosaminoglycan synthesis, thus reducing extracellular matrix degradation. Although several studies have been published on this topic, the effectiveness of treatment with oral CS and GlcN remains uncertain. The objective of this study was to analyze the progression of experimentally induced osteoarthritis in horses and verify the effectiveness of an oral compound based on CS and GlcN to treat and/or modulate this disease. The study analyzed the metacarpophalangeal joint of the left thoracic limb of 16 horses divided into two groups, with eight horses treated with CS and GlcN in the treated group (GT) and eight untreated horses in the control group (GC). Chondral lesions were induced through arthroscopy, which was defined as time-point zero (T0). Physical, ultrasonographic, and radiographic examinations and synovial fluid biomarkers measurements were performed on days 0, 30, 60, 90, and 120. At the end of the experiment (T4), arthroscopy was performed again to macroscopically evaluate the joints and collect material for microscopic analysis. RESULTS: Significant differences were observed between groups in some evaluated parameters, such as visual lameness assessment, synovial concentrations of prostaglandin E2, and ultrasound examination. However, the GT still presented slightly improved results for joint flexion angle, analysis of lameness using sensors, and histopathological analysis of chondral repair tissue, however, without the statistical significance (p>0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The treatment was considered effective in the clinical modulation of experimental osteoarthritis, with improvement of some parameters in the GT. However, this type of treatment may not be entirely effective to change the catabolic process in articular cartilage and the progressive induced chondral damage.",

METHODS: This 6-month retrospective case-control study included patients with concomitant knee osteoarthritis and symptomatic EHOA. Participants were stratified into two groups based on whether or not pCGS (1500 mg/day) was added to the conventional therapy (education and training in ergonomic principles, exercise and use on-demand of symptomatic drugs) for hand osteoarthritis. Patients were evaluated at baseline, after 3 and 6 months. Primary outcomes were the change from baseline to month 6 in Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) hand pain and in Functional Index for Hand Osteoarthritis (FIHOA) score. A set of secondary parameters was also evaluated. RESULTS: 123 patients were included as follows: 67 treated with pCGS in addition to conventional therapy (pCGS Group) and 56 with conventional therapy alone (Control Group). After 6 months a significant difference in VAS and in FIHOA score (p < 0.01 and p < 0.001, respectively) was observed in favor of pCGS Group. Similar results were found for morning stiffness duration (p < 0.05), health assessment questionnaire (p < 0.01) and physical and mental component score of 36-item short form (p < 0.05 and p < 0.001, respectively). A significant reduction of symptomatic drug consumption at 3 and 6 months was reported in the pCGS Group (p < 0.001). No serious adverse event was recorded in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: Despite all the limitations inherent to an observational study, our results suggest the potential effectiveness of pCGS, when used in combination with conventional therapy in EHOA. Further randomized placebo-controlled trials are needed to confirm these positive findings. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov, http://www.

METHODS: After the KOA white rabbit model was established, aerobic training and OTL treatment were performed, then the model joints were evaluated by Mankin, HE staining was used to observe the pathological changes of articular cartilage, TUNEL and immunohistochemistry were used to detect chondrocyte apoptosis. Knee chondrocytes were isolated and identified by Alcian Blue and type II collagen fiber staining. The cells were treated with iodoacetic acid (MIA) to simulate osteoarthritis in vitro, and then the effect of TRPV5 on apoptosis was detected by flow cytometry, in addition, apoptosis-related proteins and TRPV5 were detected by western blotting and qRT-PCR. RESULTS: Both aerobic exercise and OTL treatment could significantly reduce the Mankin score of KOA model, and could effectively inhibit chondrocyte apoptosis in the KOA model, and inhibit the expression of caspase 3 and caspase 9 in the KOA model. TRPV5 expression was significantly increased in the model, while both aerobic exercise and OTL could reverse its expression. The low-expression of TRPV5 significantly reversed the role of MIA in promoting apoptosis and apoptosis-related proteins of knee chondrocytes, while overexpressing TRPV5 promoted MIA-induced apoptosis and apoptosis-related proteins. CONCLUSION: Aerobic exercise combined with glucosamine hydrochloride capsules inhibited the apoptosis of chondrocytes in rabbit KOA by affecting the expression of TRPV5.",

      "abstract": "AIM: Glucosamine derivatives have been found to have anticancer effects in many cancer cell lines in previous investigations. The effect of glucosamine sulfate on neuroblastoma, however, is uncertain. The potential cytotoxic effects of glucosamine sulfate on the SH-SY5Y cell line were investigated in this study. The underlying mechanisms of this cytotoxicity have also been studied. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In this study, the SH-SY5Y cell lines were used. The cells were treated with various concentrations of glucosamine sulfate (0.3125, 0.625, 1.25 and 2.5 μg/mL) and the viability of the cells was determined using the XTT assay after 24 hours. The quantities of cleaved PARP, BCL-2, 8-Hydroxy-desoxyguanosine (8-oxo-dG), cleaved caspase 3, Bax, total oxidant, and total antioxidant in the cells were determined by ELISA kits. RESULTS: At doses of 0.3125, 0.625, 1.25 and 2.5 μg/mL, glucosamine sulfate dramatically reduced cell viability in SH-SY5Y cells (p<0.001). ELISA tests demonstrated that 1.25 μg/mL glucosamine sulfate considerably increased the amounts of 8-oxo-dG, cleaved caspase 3, Bax, cleaved PARP and total oxidant. However, 1.25 μg/mL glucosamine sulfate treatment did not change the quantity of BCL-2 protein. CONCLUSIONS: Altogether, glucosamine sulfate produced considerable cytotoxicity in SH-SY5Y cells by triggering oxidative stress, inducing DNA damage, and finally causing apoptosis. In addition, more research is needed to determine the efficacy of glucosamine sulfate as an anticancer drug in the treatment of neuroblastoma (Fig. 5, Ref. 39).",

      "abstract": "No disease-modifying treatments are currently available for osteoarthritis (OA). While many therapeutic approaches are now being investigated it is ethical to resort to alternative solutions as that we already possess. There are many reasons for thinking that, at sufficiently high doses, glucosamine (GlcN) sulphate possesses a clinically relevant effect on OA pain. Wide inter-individual variations in the symptomatic effects of GlcN are explained by the extreme variability of its bioavailability. In studies evaluating its structure-modifying effect, GlcN was more effective than placebo in reducing the rate of joint space narrowing in patients with knee OA. More recent data suggest that GlcN may be effective in the primary prevention of OA in sportsmen. There is no controversy concerning the safety of GlcN which does not differ to that of placebo. Several studies have recently revealed an unexpected effect of GlcN on cardiovascular mortality. After adjusting for confounding factors, the regular consumption of GlcN correlated with a 27% reduction in mortality and a 58% reduction in deaths from cardiovascular causes. These data confirm animal studies demonstrating a protective effect of GlcN against cancer and cardiovascular diseases due to modulation of the O-GlcNAcylation pathway. Disorders in O-GlcNAcylation are involved in diabetes, obesity and cancers, which all feature chronic low-grade inflammation (CLGI). By regulating CLGI, GlcN may be beneficial to the symptoms of OA, its outcome and to that of the concomitant chronic pathologies, making GlcN as a valuable candidate for the treatment of OA in patients with metabolic syndrome, diabetes or cardiovascular diseases."

      "abstract": "Trophectoderm (TE) is the first epithelium that appears during mammalian embryogenesis, and is a polarized transporting single cell layer that comprises the wall of the blastocyst. Previous studies have revealed the functional roles of glucose (Gluc), fructose (Fruc), and glutamine (Gln), which play a positive role in porcine trophectoderm (pTr) cell proliferation and migration, suggesting the importance of nutrients for normal development of the conceptus and implantation. This work was conducted to test the hypothesis that glucosamine (GlcN), which is synthesized from Gln and Fruc-6-phosphate through the hexosamine biosynthesis pathway (HBP), can stimulate proliferation and sustain the barrier and anti-oxidative functions of pTr cells. Cells were treated with 0, 0.25, or 0.5 mmol L-1 GlcN in the presence or absence of adiquat (DQ) for the indicated time points. The results showed that 0.25 or 0.5 mmol L-1 GlcN stimulated pTr cell viability and DNA replication compared to the control group. The addition of 0.25 mmol L-1 GlcN enhanced the phosphorylation of mTOR signaling proteins, which can be inhibited by the inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), LY294002. Transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) was increased, and paracellular permeability was correspondingly reduced in GlcN treatment. GlcN attenuated DQ-induced cell death and reduced the level of reactive oxygen species (ROS). The decreased TEER values and increased paracellular permeability caused by DQ treatment were also inhibited by GlcN treatment. The addition of 0.5 mmol L-1 GlcN increased the protein expression of zonula occludens-3 (ZO-3), claudin-3, and claudin-4 in pTr cells, while inhibited the downregulation protein of claudin-1 and claudin-3 brought about by oxidative stress. Collectively, GlcN plays an important role in promoting proliferation and stimulating the mTOR cell signaling pathway, as well as ameliorating oxidative stress and augmenting barrier functions in pTr cells.",

Combining anti-inflammatory therapy with nutritional supplement is an effective means for the treatment of OA. In this study, we prepared gelatin (Gel)-glucosamine hydrochloride (GH) mixed crosslinked-cyclodextrin metal-organic framework (G-GH/CL-CD-MOF) composite hydrogel. Polyethylene glycol diglycidyl ether was the crosslinking agent of GH and Gel to solve the problem of poor mechanical properties and water solubility at 37 °C. CL-CD-MOF was fabricated through a simple one-step chemical reaction to crosslink the hydrophilic hydroxyl groups in CD-MOF with diphenyl carbonate. Electron microscopy and x-ray diffraction analysis of CL-CD-MOF showed perfect porous morphology with a chaotic internal structure. CL-CD-MOF@IBU was prepared by immersing CL-CD-MOF in high-concentration ibuprofen (IBU) solution. CL-CD-MOF@IBU was uniformly dispersed in Gel and GH mixed solution to prepare G-GH/CL-CD-MOF@IBU composite hydrogel long-term sustained drug delivery system. The compression curve of G-GH/CL-CD-MOF composite hydrogel showed a non-linear elastic behavior. The cyclic loading-unloading compression showed that the shape of the G-GH/CL-CD-MOF composite hydrogel can be kept intact under 50% strain. On the day 14, the G-GH/CL-CD-MOF@IBU composite hydrogel was degraded by 87.1%, 61% of IBU was released. G-GH/CL-CD-MOF@IBU exhibited good biocompatibility during co-culture with MC3T3-E1 cells. Briefly, the certain mechanical properties, sustained drug release behavior, and good biocompatibility of G-GH/CL-CD-MOF@IBU composite hydrogel showed that it has potential application in OA treatment of long-term sustained nutritional supplement and anti-inflammatory synchronously.",

      "abstract": "In 2009 Candida auris was first isolated as fungal pathogen of human disease from ear canal of a patient in Japan. In less than a decade, this pathogen has rapidly spread around the world and has now become a major health challenge that is of particular concern because many strains are resistant to multiple class of antifungal drugs. The lack of available antifungals and rapid increase of this fungal pathogen provides an incentive for the development of new and more potent anticandidal drugs and drug combinatorial treatments. Here we have explored the growth inhibitory activity against C. auris of a synthetic dipeptide glutamine analogue, L-norvalyl-N 3-(4-methoxyfumaroyl)-L-2,3- diaminopropanoic acid (Nva-FMDP), that acts as an inhibitor of glucosamine-6-phosphate (GlcN-6-P) synthase - a key enzyme in the synthesis of cell wall chitin. We observed that in contrast to FLC susceptible isolates of C. auris, FLC resistant isolates had elevated cell wall chitin and were susceptible to inhibition by Nva-FMDP. The growth kinetics of C. auris in RPMI-1640 medium revealed that the growth of FLC resistant isolates were 50-60% more inhibited by Nva-FMDP (8 μ g/ml) compared to a FLC susceptible isolate. Fluconazole resistant strains displayed increased transcription of CHS1, CHS2 and CHS3, and the chitin content of the fluconazole resistant strains was reduced following the Nva-FMDP treatment. Therefore, the higher chitin content in FLC resistant C. auris isolates may make the strain more susceptible to inhibition of the antifungal activity of the Nva-FMDP peptide conjugate."

      "abstract": "Oxidative stress is the crucial pathogenic factor in osteoporosis. Cell autophagy, a major form of self-digestion, plays critical functions in different forms of stress by devouring harmful cytosolic proteins or organelles for the renewal of organelles and to maintain cellular homeostasis. Glucosamine (GlcN) has been widely utilized in treatments for patients with osteoarthritis-related joint pain. It has potential antioxidant effects and its pharmacological effect in osteoblasts remains unclear. The present study aimed to investigate whether autophagy participates in the protective effects of GlcN in osteoblasts under oxidative stress and the possible mechanism. First of all, MC3T3-E1 cells were treated with hydrogen peroxide (H2 O2 ) to induce oxidative stress, as assessed by viability assays, apoptosis, the intracellular reactive oxygen species production. GlcN was capable of inducing autophagy and protected osteoblasts from those cytotoxic effects. Moreover, it significantly attenuated H2 O2 -induced oxidative stress as measured by malondialdehyde, glutathione, nitrite, and superoxide dismutase levels. Importantly, the autophagy level increased in osteoblasts treated with GlcN as represented by an increase in both Beclin1 expression and the LC3 II/I ratio. Immunofluorescence analysis of autophagosomes also confirmed the above results. In addition, GlcN decreased the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and protein kinase B (Akt). However, the Akt activator (SC79) suppressed the autophagy level induced by GlcN in osteoblasts. Consequently, the antioxidant effects of GlcN were mediated, at least in part, by enhancing autophagy through the Akt/mTOR pathway. These results suggested that GlcN might be a promising candidate for osteoporosis treatment.",
