      "abstract": "Background Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection precedes cervical dysplasia, culminating in cervical cancer. Yokuinin extract, used for treating verruca vulgaris caused by HPV, exhibits potential antitumor activity against cervical cancer and mild cervical dysplasia. We examined the usefulness of Yokuinin in the treatment of cervical precancerous lesions. Methods This retrospective study included 73 female patients with verrucous skin lesions and mildly abnormal cervical cytology diagnosed between April 2019 and August 2021. Of the 73 patients, 34 received Yokuinin treatment whereas 39 did not. The Yokuinin-treated patients received 1.0 g Yokuinin orally divided into three doses daily. Evaluation criteria included retested cervical cytology, time to negative cervical cytology (negative for intraepithelial lesions or malignancies), and side effects. Statistical analyses employed the Mann-Whitney U test and chi-square test, indicating a statistically significant difference (p<0.05). Results Yokuinin-treated patients were significantly more likely to achieve normal cytology (NILM) status (p= 0.0441). Median time to NILM was three months for Yokuinin-treated versus five months for non-Yokuinin-treated group, indicating that the Yokuinin-treated group achieved NILM significantly earlier (p= 0.0011). Additionally, high-risk HPV-positive patients were more likely to develop NILM in a short period after Yokuinin administration, and premenopausal patients also developed NILM in a short period. No adverse effects were associated with Yokuinin administration. Conclusion Yokuinin administration effectively normalized precancerous cervical lesions, with expedited normalization observed in HPV-positive and premenopausal cases. Yokuinin emerges as a promising treatment for cervical precancerous lesions."

      "abstract": "Background: Very-low-birth-weight (VLBW) infants often experience feeding intolerance owing to organ immaturity, and the most frequent sign is the presence of abdominal distention. Daikenchuto (DKT), a traditional Japanese herbal medicine, is used to improve gastrointestinal function, particularly in adults. The aim of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of DKT in reducing abdominal distention and intestinal gas in VLBW infants. Methods: This study involved a retrospective chart review of 24 VLBW infants treated with DKT at Hamamatsu University Hospital between April 2016 and March 2021. The effects of DKT treatment at a dose of 0.3 g/kg/day were evaluated through clinical parameters and abdominal radiography. Results: Before treatment, marked abdominal distention was observed in 46% of the infants, which reduced to 4% within a week of DKT administration. The gas volume score (GVS) decreased in 92% of the patients within the first week of treatment and markedly decreased by ≥20% in 46% of the patients. The effects of improving abdominal distention and decreasing the GVS on radiography persisted for 1-2 weeks after treatment initiation. No clinical parameters affecting a GVS reduction of ≥20% and no notable adverse effects were observed. Conclusions: While the preliminary findings suggest that DKT may help manage abdominal distention in VLBW infants, further studies with placebo-controlled trials, larger sample sizes, use of advanced image processing software, and consideration of additional influencing factors are required to substantiate these results and identify predictors of treatment response."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Irritability is an emotional stress symptom that causes or exacerbates dizziness. Antidepressants may be helpful for some conditions that are accompanied by irritability; however, they do not completely inhibit irritability. Yokukansan (YKS), a traditional Japanese herbal medicine, has been used for neurosis, insomnia, and children's irritability and night crying. The study investigated the efficacy of YKS in nystagmus in patients with chronic dizziness and irritability. METHODS: Twenty-two cases with chronic dizziness and irritability were reviewed retrospectively. The patients were divided into two groups: control patients (0-7 days of treatment) and YKS-treated patients (YKS cases; >7 days of treatment). Dizziness before and during (after, in the controls) YKS treatment was evaluated by scoring the nystagmus intensity on a 5-point scale. The average scores were calculated within a maximum of 6 months before and during or after treatment. The normalized scores were also calculated. The optimal treatment regimen was calculated via receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. RESULTS: There were six control cases (1 male, 5 females; mean age: 59.5 years). There were 16 YKS cases (3 males, 13 females; mean age: 61.8 years). While the group mean nystagmus intensity scores significantly decreased from 1.18 to 0.73 in the YKS cases, it did not change in the control cases. The group mean of the normalized nystagmus intensity scores during treatment was 0.73 in the YKS cases. The results of the ROC curve analysis indicated the optimal cut-off period of the YKS treatment was 10 days. CONCLUSION: The oral administration of YKS for more than 10 days was optimal. The treatments with YKS could be a good option for the treatments of vertigo.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Delayed gastric emptying (DGE) remains an important problem after pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD). There is a lack of effective treatments for early recovery of oral dietary intake. Rikkunshito (RKT), a Japanese herbal medicine, has been gaining attention as a facilitator of gastric emptying. We evaluated the effects of RKT on DGE after PD. METHODS: In this prospective, randomized, open-labeled study, patients were randomly allocated before PD in a 1:1 ratio to the RKT group or the control group that received no additional treatment. The RKT group received 2.5 g of RKT three times daily (7.5 g/day) from postoperative day (POD) 1 to POD 21. The primary endpoint was the incidence of DGE. Secondary endpoints were short-term postoperative outcomes including oral dietary intake volume and perioperative changes in levels of the hormones ghrelin and leptin. Patients were observed until hospital discharge. RESULTS: Twenty-six patients in each group (n = 52) completed the protocol treatment and were included in the analysis set. There were no statistically significant differences in basic characteristics and operative factors. The overall incidence of DGE was not statistically different between the RKT and control groups (30.8% vs 30.8%, p>0.9999). There were no statistically significant differences in the amount of postoperative oral dietary intake represented by total dietary intake (TDI) up to POD 14 and POD 21, complications, and length of hospital stay. No adverse events related to this study were observed. In the RKT group, total ghrelin and acyl-ghrelin were significantly upregulated and leptin was significantly downregulated earlier than in the control group. CONCLUSION: RKT treatment from POD 1 to 21 did not reduce the incidence of DGE and had no clinically beneficial effect on short-term postoperative outcomes irrespective of changes in hormone levels."

      "abstract": "In this report, we present a case in which long-term swelling and pain because of an ankle sprain were successfully treated with the traditional Japanese herbal (Kampo) medicine Jidabokuippo. Jidabokuippo was created in Japan and has been used to treat swelling and pain associated with trauma. A 44-year-old woman sprained her right ankle and received the standard treatments including icing and immobilization for three weeks. However, the swelling, redness, and pain of her ankle continued for two months after the treatments. After initiating Jidabokuippo, her pain and swelling were promptly improved. This suggests that Jidabokuippo is a potentially promising pharmacotherapy for patients with ankle sprain which has not recovered smoothly. It is said that Jidabokuippo can be prescribed simply referring to pain and swelling of the affected areas; therefore, it should be considered as a treatment for trauma patients with long-term swelling and pain."

      "abstract": "Streptococcus pneumoniae may colonize the nasopharynx, and as pneumococcal colonization causes invasive diseases and the subsequent transmission, reducing bacterial burden in the nasal cavity is critical. Hochu-ekki-to (TJ-41) is a traditional Japanese herbal medicine that exerts immunomodulatory effects in host cells. In this study, we investigated the potency of TJ-41 in modulating pneumococcal colonization clearance by activating host immunity. Mice, intranasally inoculated with pneumococci, were treated orally with TJ-41. During colonization, TJ-41 treatment significantly reduced pneumococcal burden and increased macrophage population in the nasopharynx. Furthermore, interleukin 17A production was significantly enhanced after TJ-41 treatment. In vitro experiment using nasal-derived cells revealed that pneumococcal antigen exposure upregulated the transcription of interleukin 17A in the TJ-41-treated group compared with that in the control group. Macrophages activated by killed bacteria were significantly increased in the presence of TJ-41 in an interleukin 17A-dependent manner. Moreover, TJ-41 enhanced phagocytosis, inhibited bacterial growth, and improved the antigen-presenting capacity of macrophages. Our results demonstrate that TJ-41 accelerates the clearance of pneumococcal nasopharyngeal colonization via macrophage activation. Subsequent production of interleukin 17A provides an additional benefit to effector cells.",

This study aims to investigate the therapeutic effect of goreisan, a traditional Japanese medicine, which has been used for hydrostatic modulation on patients with LLL. METHODS: Patients diagnosed with LLL in our hospital in 2018 were included and principally treated with complex decongestive therapy (CDT), including elastic clothing and lymph drainage. The patients who received a combination therapy of CDT and goreisan (CDT-G group) were prescribed goreisan extract granules, with a dose of 7.5 g per os daily in three doses. Patients who were not prescribed goreisan received CDT alone (CDT group). The severity of lymphedema was evaluated by the estimated limb volume calculated by limb circumferences and the ratio of extracellular water (ECW) to total body water (TBW). RESULTS: Nineteen women with LLL after pelvic lymphadenectomy were included in the study. The number of patients in the CDT and CDT-G groups was 8 and 11, respectively. There were no statistically significant differences between the CDT and CDT-G groups in terms of patient characteristics and severity of LLL before treatment. Reduction in ECW/TBW in the CDT-G group (in the whole body and the affected lower limb) after the intervention was significantly more remarkable than that in the CDT group. CONCLUSIONS: Goreisan-based Japanese herbal therapy may be effective in patients with LLL after retroperitoneal lymphadenectomy."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Postoperative ileus is a major complication of abdominal surgical procedures. The purpose of this study was to investigate preventive effect of daikenchuto (DKT) on onset of ileus in patients who received gynecological surgery for malignant tumors. METHODS: A total of 904 patients who received gynecological surgery for malignant tumors by opening retroperitoneum along with retroperitoneal lymph node dissection during a period between 2004 and 2018 were included in this retrospective study. The retroperitoneum was not sutured in all patients. Comparisons were made for proportion of patients developing ileus (frequency of postoperative ileus onset), timing of ileus onset, and treatment types for ileus among following three groups: a group treated with enema or laxatives to release gas if they did not pass the intestinal gas for 3 days postoperatively (Group A, n = 152); a group treated with adhesion-inhibitory absorptive barrier at the opening to the retroperitoneum (Group B, n = 188); and a group treated with adhesion-inhibitory absorptive barrier and oral intake of DKT 7.5 g per day (Group C, n = 564). RESULTS: The frequency of ileus onset significantly decreased in both Groups B (4.8%) and C (3.5%) compared to Group A (16.4%). Furthermore, the frequency of ileus onset was significantly less in Group C compared to Group B. For the treatment types, frequency of ileus, which was successfully treated only with conservative therapy, was the same for Groups B and C. However, incidence of serious ileus that required surgery decreased by 45% in Group C (2/564) compared to Groups A (2/152) and B (3/188). CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that DKT prevents development of serious ileus after gynecological surgery for malignant tumors and therefore contributes to improvement in patients' QOL.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The traditional Japanese herbal medicine, daikenchuto (DKT), has been used to treat constipation and postoperative ileus. However, the precise mechanisms involved in the pharmacological effects of DKT remain uncertain. The aim of this study was to clarify the effect of DKT on motor patterns and transit activity in the isolated rat colon. METHODS: The entire colon or segments of the proximal colon in rats were isolated and placed in Krebs solution. The motility of the colon was evaluated by analyzing spatiotemporal maps of diameter derived from video imaging and measuring the intraluminal pressure in the anal end of the proximal colon, and the transit time of a plastic bead through the entire isolated colon. KEY RESULTS: Several types of propagating contractions were observed in the isolated entire colon. When DKT was added to Krebs solution, the frequency of large-extent anal propagating contractions increased. DKT treatment increased the intraluminal pressure in the isolated proximal colon, which was related to the propagating contractions. This effect was abolished by treatment with the neural blocker tetrodotoxin. These findings suggest DKT induced peristaltic contractions in the isolated colon. DKT accelerated colonic transit activity, which was related to peristaltic contractions induction in the colon. These effects were also observed in the colons treated with bethanechol and the active ingredient of DKT, hydroxy-α-sanshool. CONCLUSIONS AND INFERENCES: Daikenchuto could enhance colonic transit activity by inducing peristaltic contractions, which may be mediated by the activation of the enteric nervous system in the colon.",

However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms targeted by YKS in the brain are not completely understood. Here, we compared the efficacy of YKS in ameliorating the age- and early-onset familial AD-related behavioral and cellular defects in two groups of animals: 18- to 22-month-old C57BL6/J wild-type mice and 6- to 9-month-old 5xFAD mice, as a transgenic mouse model of this form of AD. Animals were fed food pellets that contained YKS or vehicle. After 1-2 months of YKS treatment, we evaluated the cognitive improvements in both the aged and 5xFAD transgenic mice, and their brain tissues were further investigated to assess the molecular and cellular changes that occurred following YKS intake. Our results show that both the aged and 5xFAD mice exhibited impaired behavioral performance in novel object recognition and contextual fear conditioning (CFC) tasks, which was significantly improved by YKS. Further analyses of the brain tissue from these animals indicated that in aged mice, this improvement was associated with a reduction in astrogliosis, microglia activation and downregulation of the extracellular matrix (ECM), whereas in 5xFAD mice, none of these mechanisms were evident. These results show the differential action of YKS in healthy aged and 5xFAD mice. However, both aged and 5xFAD YKS-treated mice showed increased neuroprotective signaling through protein kinase B/Akt as the common mode of action. Our data suggest that YKS may impart its beneficial effects through Akt signaling in both 5xFAD mice and aged mice, with multiple additional mechanisms potentially contributing to its beneficial effects in aged animals."

      "abstract": "Frailty is defined as a state of increased vulnerability to poor resolution of homeostasis following stress, which increases the risk of adverse outcomes such as falls, delirium, and disability in the elderly. Recently in Japan, clinical practice guidelines (CPG) have recommended kampo treatment. We conducted a search for reports on Japanese CPG and kampo medicine in the treatment of symptoms in the elderly. The search was performed using the databases PubMed, Ichushi Web, J-Stage, Japan Medical Publishers Association, Medical Information Network Distribution Service, and CPG containing kampo products in Japan; reports from January 1st, 2012 to October 31st, 2017 were reviewed. Over the past 5 years, nine CPGs have recommended kampo treatment based on the evidence for improvement in skin symptoms, cough, gastro-intestinal dysfunction, urinary dysfunction, and dementia. Treatments with kampo medicine are performed depending on the coexistence of manifestations based on the original kampo concept, i.e., cognitive dysfunction and dementia with sarcopenia showing urinary disorder. Each kampo formula includes multiple crude drugs that have several pharmacological functions; these drugs include alkaloids, glycosides, and polysaccharides. Thus, kampo formula has an effect on multiple organs and coordinates the relationship between the brain, endocrine system, immune system, and skeletal muscles. Kampo treatment can be considered as supporting holistic medicine in elderly individuals with frailty."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Persistent edema is a common complication after the surgical treatment of blepharoptosis; however, no objective methods have been established for evaluating or treating this condition. We focused on the Japanese herbal medicine, Saireito, and evaluated its efficacy in reducing postoperative edema. METHODS: This was a prospective, nonrandomized, and controlled study. We evaluated the incidence of postoperative edema in a Control group using a subjective patient-assessed visual analog scales (VASs) to assess swelling, pain, itching, and local warmth and an objective surgeon-assessed VAS to evaluate swelling. Swelling was also assessed by an objective computer-based analysis of digital images. These methods were used to evaluate the effects of Saireito (8.1 g/day) for 8 weeks. RESULTS: A total of 49 patients and 80 eyelids were enrolled. Twenty-nine patients and 48 eyelids were assigned to the Control group, and 20 patients and 32 eyelids were assigned to the Saireito group. Our analysis of the Control group indicated that postoperative edema persisted for up to 8 weeks. On the other hand, the postoperative edema in the Saireito group was mostly eliminated at 8 weeks. The computer-based analysis of digital images showed that the edema tended to be reduced in the Saireito group compared with the Control group. CONCLUSION: Saireito might be effective for reducing postoperative edema after blepharoptosis surgery and almost completely eliminated it at 8 weeks after surgery. This study was a preliminary and nonrandomized study; therefore, the randomized and placebo-controlled study will be needed in the next step."

      "abstract": "ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Yokukansan is a traditional Japanese herbal medicine that has been approved in Japan as a remedy for neurosis, insomnia, and irritability in children. It has also been reported to improve behavioral and psychological symptoms in patients with various forms of dementia. AIM OF THE STUDY: To evaluate the usefulness of co-treatment with an antidepressant and an herbal medicine in the psychiatric field, the current study examined the effect of yokukansan on the anxiolytic-like effect of fluvoxamine in mice. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The anxiolytic-like effect in mice was estimated by the contextual fear conditioning paradigm. Contextual fear conditioning consisted of two sessions, i.e., day 1 for the conditioning session and day 2 for the test session. The expression levels of 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A receptor in the mouse brain regions were quantified by western blot analysis. RESULTS: A single administration of fluvoxamine (5-20 mg/kg, i.p.) before the test session dose-dependently and significantly suppressed freezing behavior in mice. In the combination study, a sub-effective dose of fluvoxamine (5 mg/kg, i.p.) significantly suppressed freezing behavior in mice that had been repeatedly pretreated with yokukansan (0.3 and 1 g/kg, p.o.) once a day for 6 days after the conditioning session. Western blot analysis revealed that the expression level of 5-HT2A receptor was specifically decreased in the prefrontal cortex of mice that had been administered yokukansan and fluvoxamine. Furthermore, microinjection of the 5-HT2A receptor antagonist ketanserin (5 nmol/mouse) into the prefrontal cortex significantly suppressed freezing behavior. CONCLUSION: The present findings indicate that repeated treatment with yokukansan synergistically enhances the anxiolytic-like effect of fluvoxamine in the contextual fear conditioning paradigm in mice in conjunction with a decrease in 5-HT2A receptor-mediated signaling in the prefrontal cortex. Therefore, combination therapy with fluvoxamine and yokukansan may be beneficial for the treatment of anxiety disorders.",

      "abstract": "Hachimijiogan (HJG) is a traditional herbal medicine that improves anxiety disorders in patients with dementia. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that HJG exerts neurotrophic factor-like effects to ameliorate memory impairment in Alzheimer disease (AD) model rats. First, we describe that HJG acts to induce neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells (a rat pheochromocytoma cell line) like nerve growth factor (NGF) in a concentration-dependent manner (3 μg/ml HJG, p < 0.05; 10-500 μg/ml HJG, p < 0.001). While six herbal constituents of HJG, Rehmannia root, Dioscorea rhizome, Rhizoma Alismatis, Poria sclerotium, Moutan bark, and Cinnamon bark, could induce neurite outgrowth effects, the effect was strongest with HJG (500 μg/ml). Second, we demonstrated that HJG-induced neurite outgrowth was blocked by an inhibitor of cAMP response element binding protein (CREB), KG-501 (10 μM, p < 0.001). Moreover, HJG was observed to induce CREB phosphorylation 20-90 min after treatment (20 min, 2.50 ± 0.58-fold) and CRE-mediated transcription in cultured PC12 cells (500 μg/ml, p < 0.01; 1000 μg/ml, p < 0.001). These results suggest a CREB-dependent mechanism underlies the neurotrophic effects of HJG. Finally, we examined improvements of memory impairment following HJG treatment using a Morris water maze in AD model animals (CI + Aβ rats). Repeated oral administration of HJG improved memory impairment (300 mg/kg, p < 0.05; 1000 mg/kg, p < 0.001) and induced CREB phosphorylation within the hippocampus (1000 mg/kg, p < 0.01). Together, our results suggest that HJG possesses neurotrophic effects similar to those of NGF, and can ameliorate cognitive dysfunction in a rat dementia model via CREB activation. Thus, HJG could potentially be a substitute for neurotrophic factors as a treatment for dementia."

      "abstract": "We previously reported in randomized controlled trials that maoto, a traditional herbal medicine, showed clinical and virological efficacy for seasonal influenza. In this study, a culturing system for influenza was used to test the effect of maoto. A549 cells in the culture were infected with influenza virus A (PR8) and followed after treatment with maoto; the virus titers in the culture supernatant, intracellular viral proteins, and viral RNA were determined. When infected cells were cultured with maoto for 24 hr, the virus titer and protein were significantly reduced compared with medium only. Other subtypes, A/H3N2, H1N1pdm, and B, were also inhibited by maoto. Proliferation of viral RNA in a 6 hr culture was inhibited by maoto in the early phase, especially in the first 30 min. Focusing on the entry step of the influenza virus, we found that endosomal pH, regulated by vacuolar-type H+ ATPase (V-ATPase) located in the membrane, was increased when treated with maoto. We also found that uncoating of influenza viruses was also inhibited by maoto, resulting in the increase of the number of virus particles in endosomes. These results strongly suggest that the inhibition of endosomal acidification by maoto results in blocking influenza virus entry to cytoplasm, probably through the inhibition of V-ATPase. The present study provides evidence that supports the clinical use of maoto for the treatment of influenza."

It is also known to have preventive effects against influenza clinically. However, the detailed mechanisms of the preventive effects have not been clarified. We examined the relationship between the preventive effects of HKT and autophagy, a known stress response and quality control mechanism, using Madin-Darby canine kidney cells and influenza A/PR/8/34 (H1N1) virus. METHODS: The effect of HKT on autophagy in influenza A virus (IAV)-infected cells was assessed by Western blotting and fluorescence microscopy using an RFP-GFP-LC3B sensor kit. RESULTS: In Western blotting, treatment with HKT before IAV infection (pre-HKT) tended to induce autophagy in IAV-infected cells at an early stage of infection, eventually suppressing IAV-induced autophagy. Moreover, several autolysosomes, indicative of normal autophagosome-lysosome fusion, were observed in Pre-HKT cells transduced with RFP-GFP-LC3B but not in untreated IAV-infected cells. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicated that IAV-mediated inhibition of the fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes was prevented by HKT treatment before infection. According to these results, we propose that this phenomenon is one of the preventive effects of HKT against IAV.",

We herein report the effect of the oral administration of Ninjinto (NJT, ginseng decoction), a traditional Japanese Kampo medicine, on chronic intestinal failure. Patients and Methods. Seven patients with chronic intestinal failure treated with NJT were evaluated in this study. The primary diseases included chronic intestinal pseudoobstruction (CIPO: n = 4), short bowel syndrome (SBS: n = 2), and intestinal atresia (n = 1). All patients orally received NJT extract granules at a dose of 0.3 g/kg BW per day. The treatment outcomes were then assessed according to the patients' symptoms and consecutive abdominal X-ray findings. Results. The targeted symptoms were abdominal distension in four patients, diarrhea in three patients, and frequent hospitalization due to infections in two patients. An improvement in the symptoms was observed in six of the seven patients, whereas one patient with SBS did not show any improvement. An improvement in an abdominal roentgenogram was observed in the four patients with remarkably dilated bowel loops due to CIPO. Conclusions. NJT may be effective in controlling functional gastrointestinal disorders associated with chronic intestinal failure. The use of Kampo medicine in the field of pediatric surgery may help to improve the quality of life in children suffering from such conditions."

The expression levels of Akt and GSK-3β, the phosphorylation of FoxO4, and the phosphorylations of AMPK and mitochondrial-related transcription factors such as PGC-1α were suppressed, while the expression of MuRF1 increased in SAMP8 mice, but approximated that in senescence-accelerated aging-resistant (SAMR1) mice after GJG treatment.

Hence, many survivors are at high risk for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). This randomized, observer-blinded, controlled trial examined the efficacy and safety of the traditional Japanese herbal formula saikokeishikankyoto (SKK) in the treatment of PTSD among survivors of this disaster. Forty-three participants with an Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) score ≥ 25 were randomized into SKK (n = 21) and control (n = 22) groups. The primary endpoint was the change in IES-R scores from baseline till after 2 weeks of treatment. Intergroup statistical comparisons were performed. The magnitude of changes in total IES-R scores differed significantly between the two groups (P < 0.001). Post hoc analysis showed that the total IES-R score improved significantly in the SKK group from 49.6 ± 11.9 to 25.5 ± 17.0 (P < 0.001). Subscale scores improved significantly in the SKK group (avoidance, P = 0.003; hyperarousal, P < 0.001; intrusion, P < 0.001). Two-week treatment with SKK significantly improved IES-R scores among PTSD patients. This traditional medicine may be a valid choice for the treatment of psychological and physical symptoms in PTSD patients."

We retrospectively evaluated the effects of postoperative maintenance therapy with daikenchuto, a traditional Japanese Kampo medicine, on the reoperation rate at 3 years in patients with Crohn's disease. METHODS: A total of 258 patients who underwent surgery for Crohn's disease were identified for the study. For the prevention of postoperative recurrence, patients were stratified to receive 5-aminosalicylic acid, azathioprine or daikenchuto, and their effects on preventing reoperation at 3 years were evaluated. RESULTS: Of the 258 patients, 44 required reoperation with intestinal resection within 3 years due to disease recurrence. The 3-year reoperation rate was significantly lower in the postoperative daikenchuto group than in the non-daikenchuto group (11.3 vs. 24.5 %, P = 0.01), and was similarly significantly lower in the postoperative 5-aminosalicylic acid group than in the non-5-aminosalicylic acid group (14.8 vs. 29.6 %, P = 0.0049). A multivariate Cox analysis showed that postoperative daikenchuto (P = 0.035) and postoperative 5-aminosalicylic acid (P = 0.022) were significantly and independently associated with the rate of reoperation at 3 years in patients with Crohn's disease. CONCLUSION: We propose that continuous daikenchuto therapy is a clinically useful and feasible maintenance therapy for the prevention of postoperative reoperation in patients with Crohn's disease.",

Mice were exposed to repeated restraint stress for 60 or 240 min/day for 14 days. From the 3rd day of stress exposure, mice were given yokukansan orally (p.o.) or the 5-HT1A receptor agonist flesinoxan intraperitoneally (i.p.) immediately after the daily exposure to restraint stress. After the final exposure to restraint stress, the emotionality of mice was evaluated using an automatic hole-board apparatus. A single exposure to restraint stress for 60 min induced a decrease in head-dipping behavior in the hole-board test. This emotional stress response disappeared in mice that had been exposed to repeated restraint stress for 60 min/day for 14 days, which confirmed the development of stress adaptation. In contrast, mice that were exposed to restraint stress for 240 min/day for 14 days did not develop this stress adaptation, and still showed a decrease in head-dipping behavior. The decreased emotionality observed in stress-maladaptive mice was significantly recovered by chronic treatment with yokukansan (1000 mg/kg, p.o.) as well as flesinoxan (0.25 and 0.5 mg/kg, i.p.) immediately after daily exposure to stress. These findings suggest that yokukansan may have a beneficial effect on stress adaptation and alleviate the emotional abnormality under conditions of excessive stress.",

      "abstract": "Despite the development of radiotherapy machines and technologies, a proportion of patients suffer from radiation-induced lymphedema. Saireito (SRT) is a traditional Japanese herbal medicine that has been used for treating edema and inflammation in conditions such as nephritic disease. This study investigated the effect of SRT on lymphedema caused by radiotherapy. Four patients were treated with SRT at a dose of 9 g/day. The severity of lymphedema was evaluated using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4 and Numerical Rating Scale before and after SRT treatment. After the treatment with SRT, 2 of 4 patients (50%) showed apparent improvement in lymphedema. One of the cases had difficulty in wearing the custom-made thermoplastic cast, but after SRT administration, he could wear the mask easily. One case decided to stop taking SRT 3 days after initiation because cough and fever appeared. In conclusion, it is important to control the side effects of radiotherapy, which leads to improved tumor control rates. Prospective randomized studies are necessary to confirm the findings of this case series study."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Daikenchuto (DKT), a gastrointestinal prokinetic Japanese herbal medicine, is prescribed for patients with postoperative ileus (POI) and adhesive bowel obstruction following abdominal surgery. Several mechanisms for the amelioration of POI by DKT have been suggested; however, it has remained unclear whether DKT shows anti-inflammatory effects in POI. In the present study, we investigated the effects of DKT in a mouse POI model and attempted to clarify the detailed mechanisms of action. METHOD: Intestinal manipulation (IM) was applied to the distal ileum of mice. DKT was administered orally to the animals 4 times before and after IM. Gastrointestinal transit in vivo, leukocyte infiltration, cytokine mRNA expression and gastrointestinal motility were analyzed. We also investigated the effects of the α7nAChR antagonist methyllycaconitine citrate (MLA) on the DKT-mediated ameliorative action against POI, and we studied the effects of DKT on inflammatory activity in α7nAChR knockout mice. RESULTS: DKT treatment led to recovery of the delayed intestinal transit induced by IM. DKT significantly inhibited the infiltration of neutrophils and CD68-positive macrophages, and inhibited mRNA expressions of TNF-α and MCP-1. MLA significantly reduced the anti-inflammatory action of DKT, and the amelioration of macrophage infiltration by DKT was partially suppressed in α7nAChR knockout mice. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, in addition to the gastrointestinal prokinetic action, DKT serves as a novel therapeutic agent for POI characterized by its anti-inflammatory potency. The DKT-induced anti-inflammatory activity may be partly mediated by activation of α7nAChR.",

      "abstract": "A Kampo medicine, Hochuekkito (TJ-41), with an influenza virus-preventing effect had life-extending effectiveness, and immunological responses other than interferon (IFN)-α release were examined. TJ-41 (1 g/kg) was given to C57BL/6 male mice orally once a day for 2 weeks. Mice were then intranasally infected with influenza virus. After infection, virus titers and various parameters, mRNA levels and protein expression, for immunoresponses in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid or removed lung homogenate, were measured by plaque assay, quantitative RT-PCR and ELISA. IFN-α and -β levels of TJ-41-treated mice were higher than those of the control. Toll-like receptor TLR7 and TLR9 mRNAs were elevated after infection, but retinoic acid-inducible gene (RIG-1) family mRNA levels, RIG-1, melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 and Leishmania G protein 2 showed no response in either TJ-41 or control groups. Interferon regulatory transcription factor (IRF)-3 mRNA levels to stimulate type I (α/β) IFN were increased, but IRF-7 did not change. Only granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) after Hochuekkito treatment was significantly elevated 2 and 3 days after infection. The mRNA levels of 7 defensins after infection increased compared to preinfection values. The key roles of TJ-41 were not only stimulation of type I IFN release but also GM-CSF-derived anti-inflammation activity. Furthermore, defensin (antimicrobial peptide) mRNA levels increased by infection and were further enhanced by TJ-41 treatment. Defensin might prevent influenza virus replication.",

      "abstract": "The Japanese herbal medicine (Kampo) Ninjinto has been used for the treatment of gastroenteritis, esogastritis, gastric atony, gastrectasis, vomiting, and anorexia. The pharmacological effects of Ninjinto on the gastrointestine are due to changes in the levels of gut-regulated peptide, such as motilin, somatostatin, calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), substance P, and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP). The release of these peptides is controlled by acetylcholine (ACh) from the preganglionic fibers of the parasympathetic nerve. Thus, we examined the effects of the selective M1 muscarinic receptor antagonist pirenzepine on the elevation of Ninjinto-induced plasma the area under the plasma gut-regulated peptide concentration-time curve from 0 to 240 min (AUC0→240 min) in humans. Oral pretreatment with pirenzepine significantly reduced the Ninjinto-induced elevation of plasma motilin and substance P release (AUC0→240 min). Combined treatment with Ninjinto and pirenzepine significantly increased the release of plasma somatostatin (AUC0→240 min) compared with administration of Ninjinto alone or placebo. Ninjinto appeared to induce the release of substance P and motilin into plasma mainly through the activation of M1 muscarinic receptors, and pirenzepine may affect the pharmacologic action of Ninjinto by the elevation of plasma substance P, motilin, and somatostatin."

      "abstract": "Kampo (traditional Japanese herbal) medicines are taken orally due to which the gastric mucosal immune system may act as one of the major targets for the expression of pharmacological activity. The inner surface of the intestinal tract possesses a large area of mucosal membranes, and the intestinal epithelial cells sit at the interface between a lumen and a lymphocyte-rich lamina propria. The cross talk that occurs between these compartments serves to maintain intestinal homeostasis, and the cytokine network plays an important role in the cross talk. In this study, the effect of Hochuekkito (HET), one of Kampo medicines, on cytokine secretion of intestinal epithelial cells was investigated. When murine normal colonic epithelial cell-line MCE301 cells were stimulated with HET, the contents of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) in the conditioned medium were significantly increased in dose- and time-dependent manners. The enhanced G-CSF gene transcription in MCE301 cells by the stimulation of HET was observed by RT-PCR. The enhanced G-CSF secretion by HET was also observed in C3H/HeJ mice-derived primary cultured colonic epithelial cells. When the HET was fractionated, only the polysaccharide fraction (F-5) enhanced the G-CSF secretion of MCE301 cells, and the activity of F-5 lost after the treatment of periodate that can degrade the carbohydrate moiety. These results suggest that HET enhances secretion of G-CSF from colonic epithelial cells and the polysaccharide is one of the active ingredients of HET. The enhanced G-CSF secretion by HET may partly contribute to the clinically observed various pharmacological activities of HET including immunomodulating activity."

The main focus is on pharmacogenomics of natural products derived from Kampo medicinal plants, with special emphasis on cancer treatment. One of these natural products with profound cytotoxicity against tumor cell lines is shikonin from the medicinal plant Lithospermum erythrorhizon. This compound has been selected to demonstrate how molecular determinants of response of tumor cells to Kampo-derived natural products can be investigated by microarray-based approaches. Synthetic or semi-synthetic derivatives of natural products from Kampo medicine may lead to novel drugs with improved features for cancer treatment. Kampo-derived natural products represent a valuable reservoir for individual tumour treatment strategies in the future.",
