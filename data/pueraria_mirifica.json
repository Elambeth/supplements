STUDY DESIGN: In a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study (TCTR20200624007), 72 postmenopausal women were randomized into the P. mirifica or the placebo gel group. Both groups were followed up at week 4 and week 12. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Doppler ultrasonography pulsatility index (PI) and resistance index (RI), VMI, VHI, endometrial thickness and genitourinary symptoms were evaluated at baseline, at week 4 and week 12 of treatment. RESULTS: Sixty-three participants completed the study. After 4 and 12 weeks of treatment, PI and RI had significantly decreased in the P. mirifica group compared with the placebo group. At week 12, PI in the P. mirifica group and in the placebo group were 3.03 + 1.09 and 6.88 + 2.16, respectively (p = 0.002). Similar changes were also demonstrated in the resistance indices. The P. mirifica group demonstrated a markedly higher mean VMI at week 12 compared with the placebo group, 55.19 ± 18.53 and 20.29 ± 28.46 (p = 0.012). In addition, all parameters of VHI based on the vaginal physical findings at week 12 in the P. mirifica group were significantly higher than in the placebo group (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: In this study, 6% P. mirifica vaginal gel for 12 weeks in postmenopausal women with GSM appeared to increase vaginal artery circulation and restore atrophic vaginal tissue.

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: To compare the effects of a 12-week treatment with Pueraria mirifica (PM) gel or a conjugated estrogen cream on vaginal maturation index, vaginal symptom score, vaginal health assessment score, and vaginal flora in postmenopausal women. METHODS: In a prospective, noninferiority, randomized controlled study, 82 postmenopausal women with at least one vulvovaginal symptom, that is, dryness, soreness, irritation, dyspareunia, or discharge, were recruited. Participants were randomly assigned into two groups for treatment with either PM gel or conjugated estrogen cream (CEE). The treatment regimen consisted of application of 0.5 g of product intravaginally daily for 2 weeks, and then decreased to three times per week for 10 weeks. Vaginal maturation index, vaginal symptoms score, and vaginal health assessment score were evaluated before the beginning of the study and at 6 weeks and 12 weeks after treatment with PM or CEE. RESULTS: The vaginal maturation index increased significantly in both treatment groups at week 12, from 22.44 ± 22.28 to 47.56 ± 29.00 and from 27.07 ± 26.12 to 66.90 ± 22.42 in the PM and the CEE groups, respectively (P < 0.05). A significantly higher effect was, however, observed in the CEE group (P < 0.05). Vaginal symptom scores decreased significantly after treatment in both groups, from 4.37 ± 2.79 to 0.95 ± 1.88 and from 4.15 ± 2.16 to 0.68 ± 1.64 in the PM and the CEE groups, respectively (P < 0.05), with no statistically significant different between the two groups (P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The use of a 12-week treatment regimen with Pueraria mirifica gel was shown to be efficacious and safe for the treatment of vulvovaginal atrophy. Conjugated estrogen cream was found to be more effective compared to Pueraria mirifica gel in improving signs of vaginal atrophy and restoring vaginal epithelium at 6 and 12 weeks.",

In this study, postmenopausal osteoporotic monkeys were divided into two groups (five per group), and fed daily with standard diet alone (PMP0 group) or diet mixed with 1000 mg/kg body weight (BW) of PM powder (PMP1000 group) for 16 months. Every 2 months, the bone mineral density (BMD), bone mineral content (BMC) and bone geometry parameters (cortical area and thickness and periosteal and endosteal circumference) at the distal radius and proximal tibia were determined using peripheral quantitative computed tomography together with plasma and urinary bone markers. Compared with the baseline (month 0) values, the cortical, but not trabecular, BMDs and BMCs and the cortical area and thickness at the metaphysis and diaphysis of the radius and tibia of the PMP0 group continuously decreased during the 16-month study period. In contrast, PMP1000 treatment ameliorated the bone loss mainly at the cortical diaphysis by decreasing bone turnover, as indicated by the lowered plasma bone-specific alkaline phosphatase and osteocalcin levels. Generally, changes in the cortical bone geometry were in the opposite direction to the cortical bone mass after PMP1000 treatment. This study indicated that postmenopausal monkeys continuously lose their cortical bone compartment, and they have a higher possibility for long bone fractures. Oral PMP treatment could improve both the bone quantity (BMC and BMD) and quality (bone geometry).",

      "abstract": "We determined the neurotherapeutic effects of Pueraria mirifica extract (PME) and pure puerarin (PU) in comparison with 17β-estradiol (E2 ) in early- and late-stage cognitive impaired rats. Rats were ovariectomized (OVX), kept for 2 and 4 months to induce early- and late-stage cognitive impairment, respectively, and divided into four groups that were treated daily with (i) distilled water, (ii) 100 mg/kg of PME, (iii) 7 mg/kg of PU, and (iv) 80 µg/kg of E2 for 4 months. The estrogen deficiency symptoms of OVX rats were abrogated by treatment with E2 or PME, but not by treatment with PU. The mRNA level of genes associated with amyloid production (App and Bace1) and hyperphosphorylated Tau (Tau4) were upregulated together with the level of impaired cognition in the 2- and 4-month OVX rats. Treatment with E2 reduced the level of cognitive impairment more than that with PME and PU, and 2-month OVX rats were more responsive than 4-month OVX rats. All treatments down-regulated the Bace1 mRNA level in 2-month OVX rats, while PU and PME also decreased the App mRNA level in 2- and 4-month OVX rats, respectively. Only PU suppressed Tau4 expression in 2-month OVX rats. Thus, PME and PU elicit neurotherapeutic effects in different pathways, and earlier treatment is optimal.

In this study, we investigated the protective effect of PM extract, daidzein and genistein on a testosterone-induced prostatic hyperplasia in rats. Testosterone was administered at 3 mg kg(-1) to rats followed by the PM extract, daidzein and genistein for a period of 30 days with finasteride as positive control. The testosterone level was increased, indicating inhibition of 5α-reductase converting testosterone to dihydrotestosterone. This was confirmed by prostate-specific antigen level that significantly decreased when treated with PM extract, daidzein and genistein. The PM extract, daidzein and genistein reduced the increase in the prostate/body weight ratio in testosterone-induced rats. This gives indication that PM extract, daidzein and genistein possessed protective activity for the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia. The analysis of histoarchitechture of the prostate has also shown that there was a significant improvement in prostatic cells of the testosterone-induced rats when treated with PM extract, daidzein and genistein.",

Twelve postmenopausal cynomolgus macaques, with complete cessation of menstruation for at least 5 years before start of this experiment, were divided into three groups. They received a topical vaginal application daily of 0.1 or 1% (w/w) PM cream or a conjugated equine estrogen (CEE) cream (a mixture of estrone, equilin, 17β-dihydroequilin, 17α-estradiol and 17α-dihydroequilin at 0.625 mg total estrogen/g cream) for 28 days. Estrogenic efficacy was assessed weekly by vaginal cytology assay and vaginal pH measurement, whilst the plasma luteinizing hormone (LH) and sex skin coloration levels were determined at the end of each treatment period to evaluate the systemic side effects. PM significantly increased the proportion of superficial cells in a dose-dependent manner, with a similar efficacy between 1% (w/w) PM and CEE. Together with increased vaginal maturation, PM decreased the vaginal pH to acidic levels, as observed in the CEE group. PM induced no detected systemic side effects, whilst CEE decreased the plasma LH level and increased the reddish color of the sex skin during the posttreatment period. Topical vaginal treatment with PM stimulated the maturation of the vaginal epithelium without causing systemic side effects in postmenopausal monkeys. The implication is that PM could be a safer alternative to treat vaginal atrophy in postmenopausal women.",

In this study, the effects of MR on the antioxidation system, including anti-lipid peroxidation; on the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and glutathione peroxidase; and on glutathione content in the livers and uteri of β-naphthoflavone (BNF)-treated mice were determined. BNF-treated mice are a model of procarcinogen-exposed mice. The results showed that MR improved the antioxidant activities of SOD and CAT in the livers and uteri of both normal and BNF-treated mice, while estradiol (E2) increased SOD activity in the uteri of normal mice and CAT activity in the livers of both normal and BNF-treated mice. In the liver, MR increased the levels of several forms of glutathione, whereas in the uteri E2 and MR reduced the level of lipid peroxidation by decreasing the level of malondialdehyde. Therefore, the use of MR as an alternative hormone replacement therapy might be beneficial due to its ability to improve antioxidation systems.",

METHODS: The crude extract of PM and its active phytoestrogen, miroestrol (MR), were given to OVX mice. The effect of them on antioxidation enzymes and glutathione (GSH) levels in livers and uteri were examined in OVX mice and compared with the synthetic estradiol hormone. KEY FINDINGS: Ovariectomy significantly decreased total GSH content, reduced GSH content, and the ratio of GSH to oxidized glutathione (GSSG) in both the livers and the uteri of mice. Moreover, an ovariectomy reduced the activities of glutathione peroxidase (GPx), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and catalase (CAT). The crude extract of PM as well as MR significantly increased levels of GSH, levels of reduced GSH, and the ratio of GSH/GSSG in both the livers and the uteri, while estradiol did not. In addition, the potential of PM and MR to return the activities of GPx, SOD, and CAT to normal levels was noted. CONCLUSIONS: These observations support using PM and MR as promising alternative medicine candidates for hormone replacement therapy of estradiol because of their ability to improve GSH levels and the activities of antioxidative enzymes, especially in OVX mice.",

      "abstract": "Phytoestrogens have attracted attention for their potential in the prevention of postmenopausal osteoporosis. Recently, phytoestrogen-rich herb Pueraria mirifica has been demonstrated to possess an osteogenic effect on bone in ovariectomized rats, but its underlying cellular mechanism was not known. Here, we investigated the effects of P. mirifica extract and its major isoflavone compound, puerarin, on cell viability, cell proliferation and the expression of differentiation markers in rat osteoblast-like UMR106 cells. After exposure to 17β-estradiol (E2), genistein, P. mirifica extract and puerarin, proliferation but not viability of UMR106 cells was markedly decreased. Quantitative real-time PCR revealed that P. mirifica extract and puerarin significantly increased the mRNA expression of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and osteoprotegerin, but not Runx2, osterix or osteocalcin. Puerarin also decreased the mRNA expression of receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB ligand, an osteoclastogenic factor, suggesting that it could induce bone gain by enhancing osteoblast differentiation and suppressing osteoclast function. Furthermore, after an exposure to high affinity estrogen receptor (ER) antagonist (ICI182780), the E2-, genistein-, P. mirifica extract- and puerarin-induced upregulation of ALP expressions were completely abolished. It could be concluded that P. mirifica extract and puerarin induced osteoblast differentiation rather than osteoblast proliferation in an ER-dependent manner. The present findings, therefore, corroborated the potential benefit of P. mirifica extract and puerarin in the prevention and treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis.",

METHODS: A double-blind study was conducted on 52 hysterectomized women with menopausal symptoms who had an indication for hormone therapy. The women were randomly allocated into two groups receiving either Pueraria mirifica 25 mg tablet (Arm A; n = 26) or Pueraria mirifica 50 mg (Arm B; n = 26) for 6 months. Menopausal symptoms, physical examination findings, and laboratory data were recorded at baseline. Symptoms were reevaluated at 3 and 6 months, while physical and laboratory examinations were evaluated at 1 month and at the end of treatment. A modified Green climacteric scale was used to evaluate menopausal symptoms; a score of ≥ 15 indicated estrogen deficiency. RESULTS: All women completed the study. Mean baseline climacteric scores of women who received 25 and 50 mg were: 24.19 ± 9.11 versus 23.19 ± 7.89, respectively (p = 0.674). After 3 and 6 months of treatment, scores were 17.92 ± 10.40 versus 15.35 ± 8.44 (p = 0.332) and 14.08 ± 10.30 versus 12.46 ± 6.38 (p = 0.500), respectively. No significant side effects were observed with Pueraria mirifica 25 or 50 mg. CONCLUSIONS: Both dosages of Pueraria mirifica were similarly effective and safe in the treatment of menopausal symptoms.",

Pueraria lobata is also a phytoestrogen-rich herb traditionally used in Japan, Korea and China for the treatment of hypertension and alcoholism. We evaluated the mutagenic and antimutagenic activity of the two plant extracts using the Ames test preincubation method plus or minus the rat liver mixture S9 for metabolic activation using Salmonella typhimurium strains TA98 and TA100 as indicator strains. The cytotoxicity of the two extracts to the two S. typhimurium indicators was evaluated before the mutagenic and antimutagenic tests. Both extracts at a final concentration of 2.5, 5, 10, or 20 mg/plate exhibited only mild cytotoxic effects. The plant extracts at the concentrations of 2.5, 5 and 10 mg/plate in the presence and absence of the S9 mixture were negative in the mutagenic Ames test. In contrast, both extracts were positive in the antimutagenic Ames test towards either one or both of the tested mutagens 2-(2-furyl)-3-(5-nitro-2-furyl)-acrylamide and benzo(a)pyrene. The absence of mutagenic and the presence of anti-mutagenic activities of the two plant extracts were confirmed in rec-assays and further supported by a micronucleus test where both plant extracts at doses up to 300 mg/kg body weight (equivalent to 16 g/kg body weight plant tuberous powder) failed to exhibit significant micronucleus formation in rats. The tests confirmed the non-mutagenic but reasonably antimutagenic activities of the two plant extracts, supporting their current use as safe dietary supplements and cosmetics.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of Pueraria mirifica on vaginal and urethral cytology, bladder pressure and capacity, residual urine, and leak point pressure in ovariectomized rats. METHODS: Seventy-two adult, ovariectomized, female Sprague-Dawley rats were placed into one of four groups: control, estradiol, or 100 or 1,000 mg/kg of Pueraria mirifica (PM-100 and PM-1000, respectively). The vaginal and urethral smears were checked after 30 days of ovariectomy at pretreatment and at day 28 of treatment.A single cystometry, defined as the micturition interval, filling pressure, threshold pressure, micturition pressure, and voided volume, was performed. Peak bladder pressure was calculated for each leak point pressure measured at half bladder capacity by slowly and manually increasing abdominal pressure until a leak occurred, at which point external pressure was rapidly released. Leak point pressure was tested three times per rat. RESULTS: After 28 days of treatment, the estradiol, PM-100, and PM-1000 groups had significantly higher numbers of vaginal and urethral superficial cells compared with the control group (P < 0.05). Regarding the urodynamic parameters, the threshold pressure, micturition pressure, and leak point pressure were higher in the estradiol, PM-100, and PM-1000 groups compared with the control group (P < 0.05). The control, PM-100, and PM-1000 groups had the same values for micturition interval, bladder capacity, voided volume, and residual volume (P > 0.05) but lower values compared with the estradiol group (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Pueraria mirifica 100 and 1,000 mg/kg/day showed an estrogen-like effect on the vaginal and urethral epithelium of ovariectomized rats. They did not change bladder capacity and residual urine volume but increased leak point pressure according to urodynamic study.",

      "abstract": "Impaired lipid metabolism is an important health problem in postmenopausal women with insufficient estrogens, because dyslipidemia is a risk factor for development of atherosclerosis and the incidence of cardiovascular disease markedly increases after menopause. Pueraria mirifica (PM), a Thai herb, has been noticed as a source of phytoestrogens, estrogen-mimicking plant compounds. However, the clinical effects of PM on lipid metabolism and the underlying molecular mechanisms remain undetermined. Therefore, we examined the effects of PM on serum lipid parameters in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial. Nineteen postmenopausal women were randomly assigned to receive oral administration of PM powder or placebo. After 2 months of treatment, the PM group showed a significant increase in serum concentrations of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and apolipoprotein (apo) A-1 (34% and 40%, respectively), and a significant decrease in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and apo B (17% and 9%, respectively), compared with baseline measurements. Moreover, significant decreases were observed in the ratios of LDL cholesterol to HDL cholesterol (37%) and apo B to apo A-1 (35%). Next, we determined the effects of PM phytoestrogens on the activation of estrogen receptor (ER)-mediated transactivation by transient expression assays of a reporter gene in cultured cells. Among PM phytoestrogens, miroestrol and coumestrol enhanced both ERalpha- and ERbeta-mediated transactivation, whereas other phytoestrogens, including daidzein and genistein, preferentially enhanced ERbeta-mediated transactivation. In conclusion, PM has a beneficial effect on lipid metabolism in postmenopausal women, which may result from the activation of gene transcription through selective binding of phytoestrogens to ERalpha and ERbeta.",

In the first series, rats were kept with their ovaries intact and divided into two groups; initial control (IC) and sham control (SH). The IC rats were sacrificed on day 1 and their data were kept as baseline control. The SH rats were subjected to sham operation on day 0 and gavaged daily with distilled water for 90 days. In the second series, rats were subjected to ovariectomy, divided into five groups and gavaged daily with 0.1mg/kg B.W./day of 17-alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE), 0, 10, 100 and 1000mg/kg B.W./day of P. mirifica (P0, P10, P100 and P1000, respectively) for 90 days. Changes of bone mineral density and bone mineral content were measured using peripheral Quantitative Computerized Tomography. RESULTS: Bone loss was significantly induced by ovariectomy and it was dose-dependently prevented by P. mirifica treatment for 90 days. The preventive effects of P. mirifica on bone loss depended on bone types (axial or long bone), bone sites (metaphysis or diaphysis), and bone compartments (trabecular and cortical). At P100 and P1000, bone loss was completely prevented both in trabecular bone mineral density and content. The effects of P. mirifica were, as expected, comparable to that in the EE group. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that P. mirifica may be applicable to treat the osteoporosis in menopausal women; however, an undesirable side effect on stimulating reproductive organs should be concerned.",

DESIGN: This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in a university hospital of healthy postmenopausal women aged 45 to 60 years old. Women were enrolled voluntarily and randomly received 20, 30, or 50 mg Pueraria mirifica in capsules or identical placebo once daily for 24 weeks. Outcome measures were lipid profiles, bone-specific alkaline phosphatase level, endometrial thickness, endometrial histology, breast ultrasonography, complete blood count, liver function test, and renal function test. RESULTS: After 24 weeks of treatment, 71 women were evaluated. Of the 71 women, 51 randomly received varying doses of Pueraria mirifica and 20 received placebo. Pueraria mirifica and placebo significantly increased triglyceride levels by 15% from baseline levels (P<0.05). The Pueraria mirifica group showed a significant decrease in bone-specific alkaline phosphatase levels after 24 weeks of treatment compared with the placebo group; from 0.22+/-0.18 U/L to 0.13+/-0.01 U/L in the Pueraria mirifica group and from 0.20+/-0.10 U/L to 0.20+/-0.14 U/L in the placebo group. Endometrial thickness did not change after treatment in both groups (P>0.05). No endometrial proliferation or hyperplasia was reported after 24 weeks of treatment in both groups. There were no significant differences in adverse effects on breast tissue, complete blood count, and liver and renal function tests between the Pueraria mirifica and placebo groups in this study. CONCLUSION: Pueraria mirifica at a dose of 20, 30, and 50 mg/d for a 24-week period demonstrated an estrogen-like effect on bone turnover rate. Pueraria mirifica did not demonstrate an estrogen-like effect on endometrial thickness and endometrial histology. Mild adverse effects occurred after Pueraria mirifica and placebo treatment.",

MATERIAL AND METHOD: Perimenopausal women attending the Menopausal clinic of Hat Yai Regional Hospital were voluntarily recruited. The vasomotor symptoms such as hot flushes and night sweats, as well as other unpleasant symptoms, urogenital and psychological symptoms, were also assessed. Patients were voluntarily enrolled and randomly received daily 50 mg raw material of PM, Group A, or daily 0.625 mg of conjugated equine estrogen (CEE) with/without 2.5 mg of medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA), Group B, depend on non-hysterectomized/hysterectomized condition. RESULTS: Seventy-one patients were enrolled. Eleven of those were excluded for failing to complete the initial work-up and follow-up. Sixty cases were evaluated, 30 cases in Group A and 30 cases in Group B. After medication, the mean of modified Greene climacteric scale (MGCS) in Group A/Group B had decreased from 29.0/32.26 to 17.86/18.1, 12.56/9.57 and 9.9/8.16 at 1-, 3-, and 6- month respectively. The clinical satisfaction using MGCS was not statistically significant between PM (Group A) and CEE with/without MPA (Group B) in the alleviation of climacteric symptoms (p-value > 0.05). There were no statistically significant changes of three serum markers: estradiol, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), and luteinizing hormone (LH) between both groups. CONCLUSION: PM, containing phytoestrogens, has estrogenic effect as similar as CEE, and can alleviate the climacteric symptoms in perimenopausal women. PM demonstrates great promise in the treatment of climacteric symptoms. However, optimal doses should be clinically assessed to meet appropriate individual responses.",

      "abstract": "The present study investigated the effects of long-term administration of Pueraria mirifica (PM) at non-toxic doses on the ovarian function and fertility of adult female mice based on evaluation of hematological and biochemical parameters. Female mice were divided into 4 groups (36 mice/group). Groups 1-3 were orally treated with a dose of 0 (PM-0), 10 (PM-10) or 100 mg/kg BW/day PM (PM-100), and group 4 was subcutaneously injected with 200 mug/kg BW/day of synthetic estrogen diethylstilbestrol (DES). The treatment schedule was separated into treatment and post-treatment periods. The duration of each period was 8 weeks. The PM-10 mice exhibited regular estrous cycles, while the PM-100 and DES treatments induced prolonged estrous cycles. Although no changes were observed in the uterus and ovary weights of the mice after the PM-100 and DES treatments, hyperplasia of the uterine endothelium and a decrease in the number of growing ovarian follicles were detected. The changes in the ovarian histologies of the PM-100 and DES mice were related to reductions in the levels of LH and FSH, which subsequently caused a decrease in mating efficiency. Once the PM mice were able to copulate, they were capable of successfully becoming pregnant and mothering offspring. No abnormalities were observed in the external morphologies and reproductive organ weights of the 50-day-old offspring. In conclusion, our results suggest that long-term exposure to 100 mg/kg BW of PM has adverse effects on the mating efficiency and reproduction of adult female mice and that administration of 10 mg/kg BW of PM does not induce any changes in the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian-uterine axis.",

DESIGN: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Healthy postmenopausal women, age 45 to 60 years old, were enrolled voluntarily and randomly received 20, 30, or 50 mg of Pueraria mirifica in capsules or placebo in identical capsules once daily for 24 weeks. RESULTS: After 24 weeks of treatment, 71 women were evaluated. Fifty-one of 71 randomly received one of the three doses of Pueraria mirifica, and the remaining 20 received placebo. The mean vaginal dryness symptom in the Pueraria mirifica group decreased after 12 weeks of treatment. Pueraria mirifica increased vaginal maturation index (parabasal:intermediate:superficial cells) from 46:43:11 to 11:65:24 after 24 weeks of treatment. There was no significant difference of adverse effects between the Pueraria mirifica and placebo groups in this study. CONCLUSIONS: Pueraria mirifica was proven to exhibit estrogenicity on vaginal tissue, to alleviate vaginal dryness symptoms and dyspareunia, to improve signs of vaginal atrophy, and to restore the atrophic vaginal epithelium in healthy postmenopausal women.",

Tuberous powders were prepared and administered to ovariectomized rats for 14 consecutive days at dosages of 10, 100 and 1,000 mg/kg BW respectively, and were compared with a daily treatment with 2 mg/kg BW 17beta-estradiol (E(2)). Rats treated with 10 mg/kg BW Pueraria mirifica showed no vaginal cornification. Treatment with 100 mg/kg BW Pueraria mirifica from 13 out of 25 plant samples resulted in development of vaginal cornification. The cell count percentages of the vaginal smeared cells for the treatment with the 2 plant samples that exhibited the fastest vaginal cornification revealed large variation in their estrogenic activities. Treatment with 1,000 mg/kg BW Pueraria mirifica from all plant samples produced vaginal cornification with the mean value for the period (day) of first appearance of cornified cells being 4.08 days compared to 2 days with 2 mg/kg BW E(2). The overall appearance period (day) of cornified cells during the treatment and post-treatment period with 1,000 mg/kg BW per day Pueraria mirifica was shorter than treatment with 2 mg/kg BW E(2). The results demonstrate that the plant population shows differential estrogenic activity as evaluated by vaginal cornification assay.",

The monkeys were separated into 3 groups (n=3) and orally treated with 10, 100, or 1,000 mg of PM in each group. Two series of experiments were performed. In the first series of experiments, the monkeys were orally treated with a single dose of PM. The experimental schedule was divided into a one menstrual cycle pretreatment period and a two menstrual cycle post-treatment period. In the second series of experiments, the monkeys were orally treated daily with PM for 90 days. The experiment schedule was divided into a one menstrual cycle pretreatment period, a three menstrual cycle treatment period, and a two menstrual cycle post-treatment period. Urinary samples were collected daily and assayed for the FSH, LH, estradiol, and progesterone levels. The results showed that there were no changes in the FSH, LH, estradiol, and progesterone levels after treatment with a single dose of 10, 100, or 1,000 mg of PM or after daily treatment with 10 mg of PM for 90 days compared with the levels observed during the pretreatment period. Daily treatment with 100 mg and 1,000 mg of PM for 90 days only produced a clear reduction in the urinary FSH levels. This suggests that changes of urinary FSH levels can be considered an indicator for study of estrogenic effects on hormonal levels in female monkeys.",

Groups 1-3 were orally treated with PM at doses of 0 (PM-0), 10 (PM-10), and 100 (PM-100) mg/kg BW/d in 0.2 mL distilled water, and group 4 was subcutaneously injected with 200 microg/kg BW/d of synthetic estrogen diesthylstilbestol (DES). The treatment schedule was separated into two periods: treatment and posttreatment (8 wk for each period). The PM-10 and PM-100 treatments had no effect on testicular weight, sperm number, and serum LH, FSH, and testosterone levels. Only the PM-100 treatment reduced weights of epididymes and seminal vesicle and the sperm motility and viability. Histopathological examination demonstrated that testis, epididymis, and seminal vesicle were normal in all doses of PM treatment. PM-treated males showed no alterations in mating efficiency and on causing pregnancy of their female partners. DES injection impaired all those parameters. Offspring fathered by the PM- and DES-treated males exhibited neither malformations nor change of body weight gains, and the reproductive organ weights of 50-d old pups were in the normal range. The present data clearly demonstrate that a long-term treatment of PM at doses 10 and 100 mg/kg BW/d, via oral route, does not alter a male fertility and a hypothalamus- pituitary-testis axis. Although PM-100 can cause some moderate impairment, no persistent effects were observed. Most of PM-treated mice increased the mating efficiency after stop treatment.",

Pueraria mirifica (Leguminosae), a Thai herbal plant, containing a high amount of phytoestrogens was a choice of interest for this study. We examined the effects of crude P. mirifica on bone loss and influences on reproductive organs in male rats. METHODS: Using fully mature and orchidectomized (ORX) rats, the effects of 0, 10, 100 and 1000 mg/kgB.W./day of P. mirifica and 0.1mg/kg B.W./day of 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol (a positive control) were evaluated on bone mineral density (BMD) and bone mineral content (BMC) measured with a peripheral Quantitative Computerized Tomography (pQCT) densitometry. RESULTS: Bone loss in trabecular and cortical bones of the various sites of axial bone (fourth lumbar vertebral body) and long bones (tibia and femur) after ORX was dose-dependently prevented by P. mirifica. The effects were specific on bone types and sites. The weights of the accessory sex organs, seminal vesicle and ventral prostrate gland, which significantly decreased after 3-month of ORX, were not altered by P. mirifica. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that P. mirifica treatment may be useful to prevent an osteoporosis in elderly hypogonadism subjects without influences on reproductive organs.",

Recent studies have shown that phytoestrogens from dietary sources improve endothelial function and reduce cardiovascular risks. The Thai medicinal plant Pueraria mirifica (PM) contains many potent phytoestrogens including miroestrol and deoxymiroestrol but no study on vascular function has been established. Ground powder of PM was orally given to ovariectomized White New Zealand rabbits (OVX + PM group) (n = 4) weighing 3.2-4.0 kg at the dose of 100 mg/kg for 90 days. Saline-treated ovariectomized rabbits were assigned as a control group (OVX group) (n = 5). At the end of treatment thoracic aorta was isolated for functional evaluation. Maximal relaxant response to acetylcholine (ACh) was significantly increased (24%) with 3.5-fold decrease in EC50 while no change in relaxant response to sodium nitroprusside was observed Minimal and maximal responses to 17beta-estradiol (E2) were increased in the OVX + PM group and L-NAME (100 mM) attenuated Emax of E2. PM significantly decreased maximal contractile responses to norepinephrine (NE), but no change in EC50 was observed. In addition to vascular study, the authors found no significant alteration in serum cholesterol, LDL, triglyceride, HDL, ALT AST alkaline phosphatase, and lipid peroxidation in OVX + PM rabbits. These data demonstrate that PM (100 mg/kg/d) improved endothelial function through NO-dependent pathway and increased response to E2 while sensitivity to NE was reduced. In addition, it had no impact on lipid profile, liver enzymes, and ALP activities. PM is a potential source of phytoestrogens for postmenopausal women to improve cardiovascular function or reduce cardiovascular risks.",

Each group (n = 3) was fed with 10, 100, and 1000 mg/d of PM for 90 d. PM-10 induced the decrease of follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) levels on d 15-90 in one out of three monkeys. PM-100 and PM-1000 decreased FSH levels of all monkeys throughout the treatment period. After the treatment period, FSH levels continued to decrease for 5 and 10-20 d in PM-100 and PM-1000, respectively, and the levels rebounded in all groups thereafter. PM-10 decreased luteinizing hormone (LH) levels throughout the treatment period in one out of three monkeys and returned to the pretreatment levels immediately after stopping treatment. PM-100 and PM-1000 prominently decreased LH levels between d 10 and 90 during treatment and persisted until d 15-25 and d 20-30 for PM-100 and PM-1000, respectively, during the post-treatment period. Serum LH levels rebounded after returning to pre-treatment levels in a dose-dependent manner. Estradiol levels tended to decrease during the treatment period in all groups. The daily feeding of PM suppressed gonadotrophin levels in aged menopausal monkeys based on dose. Moreover, they can be recovered, and there is a direct correlation between dosage and recovery time. PM may be effective as an alternative medicine in menopausal women because the effects are not permanent.",

In this present study, we evaluated its effect against the mutagenicity induced by aqueous extracts from Pueraria mirifica Airy Shaw & Suvatabundhu in male rats. The formation of micronuclei in polychromatic erythrocytes was induced by oral administration of an aqueous extract of P. mirifica at the doses of 400, 600, and 800 mg/kg to the rats for 30 days. The results were that the extracts of P. mirifica at doses of 600 and 800 mg/kg acted as a mutagenic agent by inducing higher frequencies of micronuclei as compared to the controls. For the antimutagenic test, P. mirifica extract at a dose of 600 mg/kg (minimal effective dose) was mixed with fresh and dried extracts of T. laurifolia in proportions of 7:3 and 1:1, respectively. The results of 4-week-treatment indicated that aqueous extracts of T. laurifolia, prepared by both fresh and dry methods, could significantly inhibit the induction of micronuclei as induced by P. mirifica. It could be concluded from the results that, under certain circumstances, T. laurifolia exhibits a significant antimutagenic activity. The use of P. mirifica and T. laurifolia as fusion herbal medicines is suggested.",

To investigate the effect of PM on the menstrual cycle length and related hormones, nine adult female monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) were separated into three groups. Each group (n = 3) was fed with 10, 100, and 1000 mg/d of PM for three menstrual cycles. The menstrual cycle length increased significantly in monkeys treated with PM-10 and PM-100 and disappeared completely in monkeys treated with PM-1000. Serum follicle stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, estradiol, progesterone, and irinhibin were lower during the treatment period in a dose-dependent manner. Changes in menstrual cycle length and the hormonal levels recovered during the post-treatment period only in monkeys treated with PM-10 and PM-100. PM greatly influences menstrual cycles and may suppress ovulation by lowering serum levels of gonadotropins.",

      "abstract": "To determine the effect of Pueraria mirifica (PM) on serum parathyroid hormone (PTH) and calcium levels on aged menopausal monkeys (Macaca fascicularis), subjects were treated with 10, 100, or 1,000 mg/day of PM. Blood samples were collected every 5 days for 30, 90, and 60 days during pre-treatment, treatment, and post-treatment periods, respectively. Sera were assayed for PTH, estradiol, and calcium levels. PM-1,000 had the strongest effect on the decrease in PTH (0.001<P< or =0.05) and calcium levels (0.001<P< or =0.03) during the treatment period. PTH levels remained low for the first 15 days of the post-treatment period (0.01< or =P < or =0.05). PM-10 induced a significant decrease in PTH level on day 80 (P=0.02) during the treatment period and a significant decrease in calcium level on day 75 (P<0.01). There were no changes in serum PTH and calcium levels throughout the study period in the PM-100 group. Estradiol levels decreased significantly during the treatment period in all treatment groups. The results suggest that long-term treatment with 1,000 mg/day of PM decreases serum PTH and calcium levels in aged menopausal monkeys, indicating that PM ameliorates bone loss caused by estrogen deficiency.",

The treatment schedule was separated into 3 periods: pre-treatment, treatment, and post-treatment. The duration for each period was 14 days. Blood samples were taken once a week. Serum LH and FSH levels were significantly increased within 1 week after gonadectomy; and there were no changes after administration of P-0, P-10, and P-100. However, the increase of LH levels in both sexes and FSH levels in females were attenuated within 1 week after P-1,000 treatment. The attenuation of LH levels in males was smaller than that of females. The decrease of gonadotropin levels was recovered within 1 week in males and 2 weeks in females, respectively, during the post-treatment period. The increase of uterine weight and vaginal cornification were observed in female rats treated with P-100 and P-1,000, whereas only the increase of epididymis weight was found in male rats treated with P-1,000. From this study, it can be concluded that P. mirifica can influence the reproductive functions in both sexes of rats, but the response in females is greater than in males.",

The percent cell growth comparison was based on protein determination of the harvested cells in parallel with the control group and Pueraria lobata treatment group. Pueraria lobata led to no proliferation and a mild anti-proliferation effect on the growth of MCF-7 cells. Pueraria mirifica caused proliferation at 1 microg/mL and an anti-proliferative effect on the growth of MCF-7 cells at 100 and 1000 microg/mL with an ED50 value of 642.83 microg/mL. Butea superba led to no proliferation and an anti-proliferation effect on the growth of MCF-7 cells at 10, 100 and 1000 microg/mL with an ED50 value of 370.91 microg/mL. Mucuna collettii led to no proliferation and an anti-proliferation effect on the growth of MCF-7 cells at 100 and 1000 microg/mL with an ED50 value of 85.36 microg/mL. The results demonstrated that only Pueraria mirifica showed an estrogenic effect on MCF-7 cell growth and a clear antagonistic effect with E2 at high concentration. Butea superba and Mucuna collettii exhibited only anti-proliferation effects on the growth of MCF-7 cells in relation with a possible anti-estrogen mechanism or a potent cytotoxic effect.",

SETTING: Hat Yai Regional Hospital, Thailand. SUBJECTS: Pre and postmenopausal women with vasomotor symptoms, such as hot flushes and night sweats. Other unpleasant symptoms, urogenital and psychological symptoms, were also evaluated. MATERIAL AND METHOD: Patients were enrolled voluntarily and randomly received 50 mg or 100 mg of Pueraria mirifica in capsules, once daily for six months. RESULTS: Of the 48 enrolled patients, 11 cases were excluded for failing to complete the initial work-up. Thirty-seven cases were evaluated. 20 of 37 (54.1%) randomly received a dose of 50 mg/day of Pueraria mirifica (Group A), and 17 of 37 (45.9%) received 100 mg/day of Pueraria mirifica (Group B). The mean of the modified Greene climacteric scale decreased from 35.6 to 26.6, 17.2 and 15.1 in group A, while group B, declined from 32.6 to 21.0, 14.8 and 13.6 at 1-, 3- and 6-month respectively. The mean serum estradiol, fluctuated from the baseline of 76.6 to 55.4, 56.7, 72.5, 69.2, 114.2 and 74.5 pg/ml at 1-, 2-, 3-, 4-, 5- and 6-month respectively. Whereas the mean serum follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH)/luteinizing hormone (LH) was stable in the range of; 27.1/12.6, 28.3/12.9 and 22.5/11.4 mIU/ml at baseline, 3- and 6-month respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Pueraria mirifica, containing phytoestrogens, relatively alleviated the climacteric symptoms in perimenopausal women. The transient negative profiles occurred in a small number of subjects that included anemia, and liver profiles. While there was a slight decrease in lipoproteins and an increase in hormonal profiles, Pueraria mirifica demonstrates great promise in the treatment of climacteric symptoms among perimenopausal women. However, optimal doses should be clinically assessed, to meet appropriate individual responses.",

The experimental schedule was separated into the pre-treatment and post-treatment periods. Blood samples were collected on days 3, 9 - 14, 19, 24, 29, and every 10 days until the next menstruation for one and two menstrual cycles during two consecutive periods and assayed for serum levels of gonadotropins and ovarian hormones. The result showed a significant increase in lengths of the follicular phase and total menstrual cycle in monkeys treated with 1,000 mg of P. mirifica, but no change in menstrual cycle length in monkeys treated with 10 and 100 mg of P. mirifica. Serum levels of follicle stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, estradiol, progesterone, or immunoreactive-inhibin did not change during the first and second menstrual cycles of the post-treatment period for all monkey groups. Our findings demonstrate that although changes in hormonal levels could not be observed in this study, a single dose of 1,000 mg of P. mirifica can disturb ovarian function and menstrual cycle in monkeys.",

In recombinant yeast assay, 0.025, 0.25, 2.5, 25, 2.5 x 10(2), 2.5 x 10(3), 2.5 x 10(4) ng/ml concentrations of PM did not show any estrogenic activities, while 10(-9) of 17 beta-estradiol (positive control) showed high estrogenic activity. Estrogenic activities were induced at 2.5 ng/ml to 25 microg/ml concentrations of PM in a dose-dependent manner on MCF-7 cells and the estrogenic effect of PM was blocked by tamoxifen treatment, a well-known anti-estrogen. PM also showed estrogenic effect on human hepatoma cell line, HepG2 cells, containing estrogen receptor and luciferase reporter gene. Taken together, PM in itself may have no estrogenicity in yeast system, but it has estrogenicity in MCF-7 & HepG2 cells that have human metabolic enzymes. The results indicated that PM may require metabolic activation for estrogenic activity.",
