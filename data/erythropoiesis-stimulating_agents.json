      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Recent experimental studies have reported that fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) inhibits erythropoiesis by suppressing erythropoietin (EPO) production and downregulating the EPO receptor. Conversely, either endogenous or exogenous EPO has been shown to stimulate FGF23 production. However, little is known about the relationships between FGF23, erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA) treatment, ESA resistance, and endogenous EPO in hemodialysis patients. METHODS: We analyzed cross-sectional data from a cohort of 654 maintenance hemodialysis patients. We examined the associations of intact or C-terminal FGF23 with ESA treatment, ESA resistance index (ERI), hemoglobin, C-reactive protein, and endogenous EPO levels using linear regression models. EPO was measured only in patients not receiving ESAs. RESULTS: A total of 458 patients (70%) were treated with ESAs. The median EPO concentration in non-ESA users was 7.8 (interquartile range, 5.3-14.4) mIU/mL. The median levels of intact and C-terminal FGF23 were 1,598 (interquartile range, 548-4,586) pg/mL and 38.7 (interquartile range, 14.0-127.6) pmol/L, respectively, in non-ESA users and 1,955 (interquartile range, 573-5,264) pg/mL and 41.4 (interquartile range, 13.9-116.8) pmol/L, respectively, in ESA users. After adjustment for potential confounders, higher ESA dose was associated with higher FGF23 levels measured by both intact and C-terminal assays. Higher C-terminal FGF23 was also associated with higher ERI, lower hemoglobin, and higher endogenous EPO, but no such associations were observed for intact FGF23 levels. CONCLUSIONS: Both intact and C-terminal FGF23 showed similar associations with ESA dose, but they showed different patterns of association with other parameters related to anemia. Further research is needed to elucidate the mechanisms underlying these different associations."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: In our previous study on erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA) treatment in lower risk myelodysplastic syndromes from the European MDS (EUMDS) Registry, we showed that patients treated with ESAs had longer survival compared with patients who receive red blood cell transfusion (RBCT). In this study, with a longer follow up time and more patients included, we aimed to assess long-term effects on survival and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of exposure to ESAs with or without RBCT in patients with lower risk myelodysplastic syndromes. METHODS: The EUMDS Registry is a non-interventional, longitudinal, real-world registry prospectively enrolling newly diagnosed patients older than 18 years with lower risk (International Prognostic Scoring System low or intermediate-1) myelodysplastic syndromes from 16 European countries and Israel. The analysis was restricted to patients with haemoglobin concentrations less than 100 g/L enrolled between Jan 1, 2008, and July 1, 2019, with last censoring of data on Dec 31, 2021. Patient management was recorded every 6 months, including treatment, transfusions, and HRQoL. ESA treatment followed local guidelines. The patients were separated into four groups at each study visit: no ESA or RBCT, ESA only, ESA plus RBCT, and RBCT only. The data were analysed longitudinally over time according to ESA and RBCT status during each 6-month interval, using propensity score matching. The main outcomes were median overall survival and leukaemia-free survival, and HRQoL. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT00600860, as is ongoing. FINDINGS: 2448 patients (the ESA-unexposed group [n=1265] and ESA-exposed group [n=1183]) were diagnosed before July 1, 2019; 1520 (62·1%) were male and 928 (37·9%) were female. Median follow-up time was 3·9 years (IQR 1·6-6·5). After applying eligibility criteria and propensity matching, there were 426 patients in the ESA-unexposed group and 744 patients in the ESA-exposed group. Median overall survival in the ESA exposed group was 44·9 months (95% CI 40·2-50·5) compared with 34·8 months (28·6-39·2) in the ESA unexposed group; the absolute difference was 10·1 months (95% CI 2·2-18·0; hazard ratio [HR] 0·70 [95% CI 0·59-0·83]; p<0·0001). Patients without RBCT in the presence or absence of ESA exposure maintained significantly better HRQoL than those with RBCT, irrespective of ESA exposure (linear mixed effect model of EQ-5d-3L index score, RBCT coefficient -0·04 [95% CI -0·06 to 0·03], p<0·0001; linear mixed effect model of VAS, -4·57 [-6·02 to -3·13], p<0·0001). INTERPRETATION: ESA treatment in patients with lower risk myelodysplastic syndromes significantly improves overall survival when started before or early after the onset of regular transfusion therapy. Avoiding RBCT is associated with significantly better HRQoL.

      "abstract": "Urothelial carcinoma (UC) predominantly arises in the bladder, but upper tract urothelial carcinomas (UTUCs) comprise 5-10% of cases. Patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) are at increased risk for UC, and erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) are frequently used to manage anemia in ESRD. However, ESA use in cancer patients raises concerns about tumor progression and survival outcomes. This study aimed to assess the impact of ESA use on tumor recurrence, cancer-specific survival (CSS), and overall survival (OS) in patients with ESRD and early-stage UC. We analyzed data from the Chang-Gung Research Database (CGRD) in Taiwan, including 850 patients with ESRD and non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) and 492 patients with ESRD and localized UTUC. The ESA group was compared to a non-ESA cohort, and inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) was applied to minimize selection bias. Kaplan-Meier curves and log-rank tests were used to evaluate bladder recurrence-free survival, CSS, and OS. In NMIBC patients, ESA use did not significantly affect bladder recurrence-free survival, CSS, or OS. Similarly, ESA use in localized UTUC patients did not increase the risk of bladder recurrence or negatively impact CSS and OS. However, UTUC patients treated with ESA demonstrated a significantly increased risk of contralateral recurrence (P < 0.001). The use of ESA in patients with ESRD and early-stage UC appears safe regarding bladder recurrence, CSS, and OS, but clinicians should remain vigilant for contralateral recurrence in localized UTUC. These findings provide valuable insights into the complex management of anemia in patients with concurrent ESRD and UC, emphasizing the need for tailored clinical monitoring in this high-risk population."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Hyporesponsiveness to erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) in patients with anaemia of chronic kidney disease may lead to increased ESA doses to achieve target haemoglobin levels; however, elevated doses may be associated with increased mortality. Furthermore, patients with hyporesponsiveness to ESAs have poorer clinical outcomes than those who respond well to ESAs. Incidence and clinical characteristics of patients with ESA hyporesponsiveness were explored in a real-world setting. METHODS: This was a retrospective study of electronic medical records of adults with stage 5 chronic kidney disease receiving renal replacement therapy and ESA treatment, from 1 January 2015 to 31 December 2021. The primary objective was ESA hyporesponsiveness rate/1000 days, with a hyporesponsive event defined as ESA use at an elevated dose, according to National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) criteria. Other hyporesponsiveness definitions applied were erythropoietin resistance index-defined ESA hyporesponsiveness (ERI) Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) and a clinical practicality algorithm. RESULTS: In total, 85,259 patients were included in the analysis; 59.9% were male, median (interquartile range) ESA starting dose was 733.3 (400.0, 1200.0) IU/week and follow-up duration was 2.2 (1.0, 4.2) years. Incidence of ESA hyporesponsiveness varied when applying different definitions; NICE 0.05/1000 days (5.2% of patients), ERI 0.40/1000 days (40.7%), KDIGO 0.15/1000 days (15.4%), and clinical practicality algorithm 0.48/1000 days (47.9%). ESA doses remained higher in hyporesponsive versus responsive patients, yet haemoglobin levels were similar between groups. CONCLUSION: The results from this study, which applied multiple hyporesponsiveness definitions to a large, geographically diverse population of patients with anaemia of CKD, showed variation in ESA hyporesponsiveness incidence rates depending on definitions used and higher ESA doses in hyporesponsive versus responsive patients. These results underscore the need for individualised clinical assessment and thorough evaluation when considering ESA dose adjustments to reach haemoglobin targets.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Besides a multitude of consequences patients on chronic renal replacement therapy have, anemia is one of the most prominent factors making a significant number of patients dependent on erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA) therapy. The aim of this study was to examine the relationship between the levels of a broad spectrum of thrombo-inflammatory and oxidative stress-related biomarkers and the presence and level of ESA hyporesponsiveness in patients undergoing regular chronic hemodialysis. METHODS: This cross-sectional study included 96 patients treated with chronic hemodialysis. Levels of several thrombo-inflammatory and oxidative stress-related biomarkers, as well as demographic, clinical, and laboratory analyses, were collected and analyzed based on the calculated value of the ESA-hyporesponsiveness index (EHRI). RESULTS: In the analyzed sample, 58 patients received ESAs. Of all the investigated parameters, only body mass index (BMI), level of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, and level of L-type fatty acid binding protein (L-FABP) were observed as significant predictors of EHRI. A significant diagnostic potential for ESA resistance has been observed in BMI and L-FABP between ESA-resistant and ESA-non-resistant groups of patients (p = 0.004, area under the curve 0.763 and p = 0.014, area under the curve 0.712, respectively) with the cut-off values of 25.46 kg/m2 and 5355.24 ng/mL, respectively. Having a BMI of 25.46 kg/m2 or less and an L-FABP level higher than 5355.24 ng/mL were observed as significant predictors of ESA resistance (odds ratio 9.857 and 6.125, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: EHRI was positively predicted by low BMI and high levels of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 and L-FABP. High levels of L-FABP and low BMI have been observed as strong predictors of ESA resistance."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Acute kidney injury (AKI) is characterised by a rapid decline in kidney function and is caused by a variety of clinical conditions. The incidence of AKI in hospitalised adults is high. In animal studies, erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESA) have been shown to act as a novel nephroprotective agent against ischaemic, toxic, and septic AKI by inhibiting apoptosis, promoting cell proliferation, and inducing antioxidant and anti-inflammatory responses. As a result, ESAs may reduce the incidence of AKI in humans. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) have been conducted on the efficacy and safety of ESAs, but no prior systematic reviews exist that comprehensively examine ESAs with respect to AKI prevention, although the effectiveness of these agents has been examined for a range of other diseases and clinical situations. OBJECTIVES: This review aimed to look at the benefits and harms of ESAs for preventing AKI in the context of any health condition. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Register of Studies up to 30 August 2024 through contact with the Information Specialist using search terms relevant to this review. Studies in the Register are identified through searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE, conference proceedings, the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) Search Portal and ClinicalTrials.gov. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included RCTs and quasi-RCTs (in which allocation to treatment was based on alternate assignment or order of medical records, admission dates, date of birth or other non-random methods) that compared ESAs with placebo or standard care in people at risk of AKI. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Three authors independently extracted data and assessed the risk of bias for included studies. We used random-effects model meta-analyses to perform quantitative synthesis of the data. We used the I2 statistic to measure heterogeneity amongst the studies in each analysis. We indicated summary estimates as a risk ratio (RR) for dichotomous outcomes and mean difference (MD) for continuous outcomes with their 95% confidence interval (CI). We assessed the certainty of the evidence for each main outcome using the Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. MAIN RESULTS: A total of 20 studies (36 records, 5348 participants) were included. The number of participants ranged from 10 to 1302, and most studies were carried out in single centres (13/20). All the included studies compared ESAs to placebo or usual care. Many of the studies were judged to have unclear or high risk of reporting bias, but were at low risk for other types of bias. ESAs, when compared to control interventions, probably makes little or no difference to the risk of AKI (18 studies, 5314 participants: RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.10; I² = 19%; moderate-certainty evidence), or death (18 studies, 5263 participants: RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.06; I² = 0%; moderate-certainty evidence), and may make little or no difference to the initiation of dialysis (14 studies, 2059 participants: RR 1.16, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.51; I² = 0%; low-certainty evidence). Even with standardised measurement of AKI, the studies showed no difference in results between different routes of administration (subcutaneous or intravenous), background diseases (cardiac surgeries, children or neonates, other adults at risk of AKI), or duration or dose of ESA. ESAs may make little or no difference to the risk of thrombosis when compared to control interventions (8 studies, 3484 participants: RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.24; I² = 0%). Similarly, ESAs may have little or no effect on kidney function measures and adverse events such as myocardial infarction, stroke or hypertension. However, this may be due to the low incidence of these adverse events. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: In patients at risk of AKI, ESAs probably do not reduce the risk of AKI or death and may not reduce the need for starting dialysis. Similarly, there may be no differences in kidney function measures and adverse events such as thrombosis, myocardial infarction, stroke or hypertension. There are currently two ongoing studies that have either not been completed or published, and it is unclear whether they will change the results. Caution should be exercised when using ESAs to prevent AKI.",

      "abstract": "Previous studies have demonstrated that erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) can reduce anemia and improve quality of life in cancer patients, but ESAs may increase mortality. Therefore, we conducted a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCT) comparing the effect and risk of ESAs about the prevention or treatment of anemia in cancer patients. Four databases including PubMed, Embase, Web of science and Cochrane Library were searched for published RCTS on ESAs in the treatment of anemia in lung cancer patients from 2000 to 2023. Endpoints including mortality, incidence of thrombotic vascular events, blood transfusion requirement, and incidence of adverse events. Our meta-analysis included 8 studies, with a sample size of 4240 patients, including 2548 patients in the ESAs group and 1692 patients in the control group. The risk of mortality was lower in patients using ESAs than control group (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.92-0.99, P = 0.02). But there was no significant difference in the risk of mortality between the patients using ESAs and controls (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.92-1.06, P = 0.69) after removing Pere 2020. Subgroup analysis found that patients diagnosed with small cell lung cancer (SCLC) (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.92-1.08, P = 0.16) or non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.87-1.17, P = 0.13) were no significant difference in mortality rate. The thrombotic vascular events increase in patients using ESAs than control group (RR 1.40, 95% CI 1.13-1.72, P = 0.002). The blood transfusion requirement of ESAs group was lower than control group (RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.44-0.72, P < 0.00001). And the subgroups of Darbepoetin alfa (RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.41-0.79, P = 0.003) and Epoetin alfa (RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.47-0.99, P = 0.01) had lower transfusion requirements than the control group. In the SCLC subgroup (RR 0.51, 95% CI 0.40-0.65, P = 0.34), blood transfusion requirements were lower in the ESAs group, but there was no significant difference between the subgroup of patients with NSCLC (RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.36-1.04, P = 0.009). There was no statistically significant difference between the two groups in the incidence of adverse reactions (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.95-1.00, P = 0.10). In conclusion, ESAs does not increase the mortality of lung cancer patients or may reduce the risk of death, and can reduce the need for blood transfusion, although ESA can increase the incidence of thrombotic vascular adverse events.Registration PROSPERO CRD42023463582.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Real-world studies of lower-risk myelodysplastic syndromes (LR-MDS) are limited. We evaluated treatment patterns, clinical outcomes, and healthcare resource utilization (HCRU) among patients with LR-MDS treated with erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) in the United States. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This retrospective study included patients with LR-MDS who initiated treatment with ESAs between January 1, 2016 and June 30, 2019. The primary analysis assessed patient demographic and clinical characteristics, treatment patterns, clinical outcomes (hematologic response, transfusion requirements, disease progression), and HCRU (medical encounters, laboratory tests, and medication use). Subgroup analyses of patients repeatedly treated with ESA therapy evaluated selected clinical outcomes and primary ESA failure by SF3B1 mutational status, per recently updated NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines©). RESULTS: A total of 142 patients were included with a median follow-up time of 17 months (interquartile range [IQR], 7-33). Median age at ESA initiation was 79 years (IQR, 73-85). Patients were predominantly male (54%), overweight or obese (32% and 23%, respectively), of White race (96%) and non-Hispanic ethnicity (89%). Overall, 57% patients were initially treated with darbepoetin alfa and 43% with epoetin alfa. Clinical outcomes were poor, and there was a significant burden on both the health system and individual patients treated with ESA therapies. Hematologic improvement- erythroid was only seen in 26% of 142 patients treated with ESAs, and 65% of 82 retreated patients experienced primary ESA failure. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that primary ESA failure is largely unrecognized and that many patients should be considered for alternative treatments.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Our previous study reported that erythroferrone (ERFE), a newly identified hormone produced by erythroblasts, responded to recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO) sensitively but its dynamics was complicated by double peaks and circadian rhythm. This study intends to elucidate the underlying mechanisms for the double peaks of ERFE dynamics and further determine whether early ERFE measurements can predict haemoglobin responses to rHuEPO. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: By using the purified recombinant rat ERFE protein and investigating its deposition in rats, the production of ERFE was deconvoluted. To explore the role of iron in ERFE production, we monitored short-term changes of iron status after injection of rHuEPO or deferiprone. Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) modelling was used to confirm the mechanisms and examine the predictive ability of ERFE for long-term haemoglobin responses. KEY RESULTS: The rRatERFE protein was successfully purified. The production of ERFE was deconvoluted and showed two independent peaks (2 and 8 h). Transient iron decrease was observed at 4 h after rHuEPO injection and deferiprone induced significant increases of ERFE. Based on this mechanism, the PK/PD model could characterize the complex dynamics of ERFE. In addition, the model predictions further revealed a stronger correlation between ERFE and haemoglobin peak values than that for observed values. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: The complex dynamics of ERFE should be composited by an immediate release and transient iron deficiency-mediated secondary production of ERFE. The early peak values of ERFE, which occur within a few hours, can predict haemoglobin responses several weeks after ESA treatment.",

      "abstract": "Both short-acting (epoetin alfa or beta) and long-acting (darbepoetin alfa or PEG-epoetin) erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) are commonly prescribed for patients with kidney failure undergoing maintenance hemodialysis. We compared the risks of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) and of all-cause mortality associated with receipt of short- vs. long-acting ESAs. This retrospective cohort analysis included Medicare hemodialysis beneficiaries aged ≥ 18 years in the United States Renal Data System from January 2015 to December 2017. We included adults who survived > 90 days after initiating hemodialysis and received either short- or long-acting ESAs. Outcomes were MACE (first occurrence of stroke, acute myocardial infarction, or cardiovascular-related mortality) and all-cause mortality. After stabilized inverse probability of treatment weighting, Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for each outcome. Of 68,607 patients (mean age: 65 years, 45% females), 33,658 (49%) received long-acting ESAs and 34,949 (51%) received short-acting ESAs. There was no difference in the risk of MACE associated with receipt of short- vs. long-acting ESAs (HR: 1.02 (95% CI: 0.98-1.08)). However, long-acting (vs. short-acting) ESA receipt was associated with a lower risk of all-cause mortality (HR: 0.91 (95% CI: 0.87-0.96)). Compared with short-acting ESAs, long-acting ESAs were associated with a lower risk of all-cause mortality, with no difference in the risk of MACE. Future studies with a longer follow-up are needed to confirm these findings.",

Erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) offer promising solutions for managing anemia in CKD. This study aimed to evaluate and compare the effectiveness, safety profile, and cost-effectiveness of short-acting (Eprex®) and long-acting (Aranesp®) ESAs. METHOD: This comparative prospective cohort cost-effectiveness study was carried out over 6 months among adult Egyptian hemodialysis patients of either gender. Participants were categorized into two groups based on the type of ESA administered: the Eprex group, receiving epoetin alfa, and the Aranesp group, receiving darbepoetin alfa. These two treatment groups' efficacy, safety, and cost were analyzed and compared. RESULTS: Of 127 hemodialysis patients, 60 (47.2%) received Eprex, while 67 (52.8%) were treated with Aranesp. Target hemoglobin (Hb) was achieved by 50.6% of patients in the Eprex group versus 63.4% in the Aranesp group, with a significant difference (P < 0.001). Both treatment groups exhibited a similar safety profile, while Aranesp® was considered the cost-saving protocol. CONCLUSION: In hemodialysis Egyptian patients, Aranesp with extended dosing intervals proved to be more effective in achieving target Hb with comparable adverse effect profiles, a substantial cost-saving strategy, and offered time-saving advantages for medical staff workload compared to Eprex.

We investigated the impact of anemia requiring red blood cell (RBC) transfusion or erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) on patient outcomes after hospital discharge in critically ill patients with acute kidney injury (AKI) requiring CRRT. In this retrospective cohort study using the Health Insurance Review and Assessment database of South Korea, 10,923 adult patients who received CRRT for 3 days or more between 2010 and 2019 and discharged alive were included. Anemia was defined as the need for RBC transfusion or ESAs. Outcomes included cardiovascular events (CVEs) and all-cause mortality after discharge. The anemia group showed a tendency to be older with more females and had more comorbidities compared to the control group. Anemia was not associated with an increased risk of CVEs (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR]: 1.05; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.85-1.29), but was associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality (aHR: 1.41; 95% CI 1.30-1.53). For critically ill patients with AKI requiring CRRT, anemia, defined as requirement for RBC transfusion or ESAs, may increase the long-term risk of all-cause mortality.",

However, it remains unclear whether hypoxia-inducible factor-prolyl hydroxylase inhibitors (HIF-PHIs) have similar reduction effects. HIF-PHI stabilizes HIF, which promotes hematopoiesis, although HIF-1α levels are downregulated by zinc. This study aimed to investigate the effect of zinc supplementation on the hematopoietic effect of HIF-PHI in patients undergoing hemodialysis. Thirty patients undergoing maintenance hemodialysis who underwent periods of treatment with roxadustat or darbepoetin alfa during the past 3 years were retrospectively observed. Participants who underwent periods with and without zinc supplementation were selected, with nine treated with darbepoetin alfa and nine treated with roxadustat. Similarly to the ESA responsiveness index (ERI), the hematopoietic effect of zinc supplementation was determined by the HIF-PHI responsiveness index (HRI), which was calculated by dividing the HIF-PHI dose (mg/week) by the patient's dry weight (kg) and hemoglobin level (g/L). Zinc supplementation significantly increased ERI (p < 0.05), but no significant change was observed (p = 0.931) in HRI. Although zinc supplementation did not significantly affect HRI, adequate zinc supplementation is required to alleviate concerns such as vascular calcification and increased serum copper during the use of HIF-PHI.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Erythropoiesis stimulating agents (ESAs) are the first-line therapy in patients with lower-risk myelodysplastic syndromes (LR-MDS). Some predictive factors for ESAs response have been identified. Type and number of somatic mutations have been associated with prognosis and response to therapies in MDS patients. OBJECTIVES: The objective was to evaluate the outcomes after ESAs in patients with LR-MDS and to address the potential predictive value of somatic mutations in ESAs-treated patients. DESIGN: Multi-center retrospective study of a cohort of 722 patients with LR-MDS included in the SPRESAS (Spanish Registry of Erythropoietic Stimulating Agents Study) study. Retrospective analysis of 65 patients with next generation sequencing (NGS) data from diagnosis. METHODS: ESAs' efficacy and safety were evaluated in patients receiving ESAs and best supportive care (BSC). To assess the potential prognostic value of somatic mutations in erythroid response (ER) rate and outcome, NGS was performed in responders and non-responders. RESULTS: ER rate for ESAs-treated patients was 65%. Serum erythropoietin (EPO) level <200 U/l was the only variable significantly associated with a higher ER rate (odds ratio, 2.45; p = 0.036). Median overall survival (OS) in patients treated with ESAs was 6.7 versus 3.1 years in patients receiving BSC (p < 0.001). From 65 patients with NGS data, 57 (87.7%) have at least one mutation. We observed a trend to a higher frequency of ER among patients with a lower number of mutated genes (40.4% in <3 mutated genes versus 22.2% in ⩾3; p = 0.170). The presence of ⩾3 mutated genes was also significantly associated with worse OS (hazard ratio, 2.8; p = 0.015), even in responders. A higher cumulative incidence of acute myeloid leukemia progression at 5 years was also observed in patients with ⩾3 mutated genes versus <3 (33.3% and 10.7%, respectively; p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: This large study confirms the beneficial effect of ESAs and the adverse effect of somatic mutations in patients with LR-MDS."

Imetelstat, a competitive telomerase inhibitor, showed promising results in a phase 2 trial. We aimed to compare the RBC transfusion independence (RBC-TI) rate with imetelstat versus placebo in patients with RBC-TD LR-MDS. METHODS: In phase 3 of IMerge, a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted in 118 sites including university hospitals, cancer centres, and outpatient clinics in 17 countries, patients (aged ≥18 years) with ESA-relapsed, ESA-refractory, or ESA-ineligible LR-MDS (low or intermediate-1 risk disease as per International Prognostic Scoring System [IPSS] criteria) were randomly assigned via a computer-generated schedule (2:1) to receive imetelstat 7·5 mg/kg or placebo, administered as a 2-h intravenous infusion, every 4 weeks until disease progression, unacceptable toxic effects, or withdrawal of consent. Randomisation was stratified by previous RBC transfusion burden and IPSS risk group. Patients, investigators, and those analysing the data were masked to group assignment. The primary endpoint was 8-week RBC-TI, defined as the proportion of patients without RBC transfusions for at least 8 consecutive weeks starting on the day of randomisation until subsequent anti-cancer therapy, if any. Primary efficacy analyses were performed in the intention-to-treat population, and safety analyses were conducted in patients who received at least one dose of trial medication or placebo. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02598661; substudy active and recruiting). FINDINGS: Between Sept 11, 2019, and Oct 13, 2021, 178 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned (118 to imetelstat and 60 to placebo). 111 (62%) were male and 67 (38%) were female. 91 (77%) of 118 patients had discontinued treatment by data cutoff in the imetelstat group versus 45 (75%) in the placebo group; a further one patient in the placebo group did not receive treatment. Median follow-up was 19·5 months (IQR 12·0-23·4) in the imetelstat group and 17·5 months (12·1-22·7) in the placebo group. In the imetelstat group, 47 (40% [95% CI 30·9-49·3]) patients had an RBC-TI of at least 8 weeks versus nine (15% [7·1-26·6]) in the placebo group (rate difference 25% [9·9 to 36·9]; p=0·0008). Overall, 107 (91%) of 118 patients receiving imetelstat and 28 (47%) of 59 patients receiving placebo had grade 3-4 treatment-emergent adverse events. The most common treatment-emergent grade 3-4 adverse events in patients taking imetelstat were neutropenia (80 [68%] patients who received imetelstat vs two [3%] who received placebo) and thrombocytopenia (73 [62%] vs five [8%]). No treatment-related deaths were reported. INTERPRETATION: Imetelstat offers a novel mechanism of action with durable transfusion independence (approximately 1 year) and disease-modifying activity for heavily transfused patients with LR-MDS who are not responding to or are ineligible for ESAs.

METHODS: ALTTO (NCT00490139) patients were categorized by ESA use during adjuvant anti-HER2 treatment. Disease-free-survival (DFS), overall survival (OS), and time-to-distant recurrence (TTDR) were analyzed by ESA administration, with subgroup analyses according to prognostic factors. Log-rank tests and Cox modeling were performed. Adverse events (AEs) of ESA-interest were compared. RESULTS: Among 8381 patients recruited in ALTTO, 123 (1.5%) received ESA concomitantly with study treatment. The median age of patients receiving ESA was 54 years, 39.0% premenopausal, most had tumor size > 2 cm (56.9%), node-positive (58.5%), and positive estrogen receptor expression (61.8%). Median follow-up was shorter in the ESA group [6.1 years (IQR 5.3-7.0) vs. 6.9 years (6.0-7.1); p < 0.001]. There was no DFS difference by ESA administration (log-rank p = 0.70), with 3- and 7-year DFS of 89.2% (95% CI 81.8-93.8%) and 81.6% (71.4-88.5%) in ESA group vs. 88.3% (87.6-89.0%) and 80.0% (79.1-80.9%) in No-ESA group. In subgroup analyses, the interaction of ESA administration with menopausal status was statistically significant (unadjusted p = 0.024; stratified p = 0.033), favoring premenopausal women receiving ESA. We observed no significant association of ESA administration with OS (log-rank p = 0.57; 7-year OS in ESA 88.6% vs. 90.0% in non-ESA) or TTDR. ESA-interest AEs were experienced by eight (6.5%) patients receiving ESA and 417 (5.1%) in the No-ESA group (p = 0.41). CONCLUSION: ESA administration to patients receiving adjuvant anti-HER2 treatment for HER2-positive EBC was safe and not associated with a negative impact on survival outcomes.",

      "abstract": "Erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) have been a common treatment for anemia associated with chronic kidney disease (CKD), while 10-20 % of patients continue to suffer from persistent anemia despite receiving ESA treatments. Our previous findings suggested that intensive ESA usage can cause resistance by depleting the erythroid precursor cells. Here, we used a mechanism-based pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) model of ESAs and conducted simulations to evaluate the influence of dose regimens and other factors (such as administration route, individual PK/PD parameters, types of ESAs, and disease status) on ESA resistance with instantaneous dose adaptations in healthy populations and anemic patients. The simulated results show that instantaneous dose-adaptation can reduce ESA resistance, but up to 30 % of subjects still ended up developing ESA resistance in healthy populations. The Smax is markedly higher in hypo-responders than in normal-responders, while hypo-responders possess fewer precursors and experience a faster decline compared to normal-responders. There is a ceiling effect of increasing ESA dosage to improve HGB responses and reduce ESA resistance, and the limit is lower in anemic patients compared to healthy populations. Subcutaneous administrations and ESAs with longer half-lives lead to stronger HGB responses and less resistance at equivalent doses. Taken together, this study indicates that precursor depletion contributes to ESA resistance and dose regimens can greatly influence the occurrence of ESA resistance. Furthermore, ESA treatment for patients showing ESA resistance should avoid continuously increasing doses and instead consider stimulating the renewal of precursors.",

We hypothesized that the prediction of ESA resistance during ESA administration would be very useful in deciding on a treatment plan. METHODS: Patients enrolled in a randomized controlled trial to evaluate renal prognosis in anemic patients with non-dialysis-dependent chronic kidney disease with hyporesponsiveness to ESA were included; the patients had different target hemoglobin levels. A landmark analysis was performed at 3 months into the study. To construct a predictive model for the severe ESA hypo-responder group, in which there was no increase in hemoglobin even with active treatment, background factors and serum test items that affect anemia at study entry were included in a logistic regression model, the area under the curve (AUC) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated, and sensitivity and specificity were calculated. This study was a post hoc sub-analysis of a randomized controlled trial. RESULTS: The AUC for the 19 existing risk factors as predictors was 0.783 (95% CI: 0.711-0.855). Among the 19 risk factors, the combination of six factors (hemoglobin level, systolic blood pressure, weight, gender, smoking status, and hypertensive retinopathy) with the largest χ2 statistics were selected by multiple logistics regression. The AUC for these 6 predictors was 0.716 (95% CI: 0.634-0.799). To the six existing risk factors, five serum test items that affect anemia (vitamin B12, vitamin B6, folic acid, parathyroid hormone, and 25-hydroxyvitamin D) were added, for a total of 11 risk factors, with a similar AUC of 0.736 (95% CI: 0.655-0.817), sufficient to predict ESA resistance. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that existing risk factors and serum test items can be used to predict ESA resistance in patients with non-dialysis-dependent chronic kidney disease on ESA.",

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: Animal studies have suggested that Erythropoiesis-Stimulating Agents (ESAs) may increase vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-related retinopathies, but this effect is unclear in humans. This study evaluates the risk of vision-threatening diabetic retinopathy (VTDR), defined as either diabetic macular edema (DME) or proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR), in patients exposed to an ESA. METHODS: Two analyses were performed. First, a retrospective matched-cohort study was designed using a de-identified commercial and Medicare Advantage medical claims database. The ESA cohort of non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy patients who were new users of an ESA from 2000 to 2022 was matched to controls up to a 3:1 ratio. Exclusion criteria included less than 2 years in the plan, history of VTDR or history of other retinopathy. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression with inverse proportional treatment weighting (IPTW) was used to assess the hazard of developing VTDR, DME, and PDR. The second analysis was a self-controlled case series (SCCS) evaluating the incidence rate ratios (IRR) of VTDR during 30-day periods before and after initiating an ESA. RESULTS: After inclusion of 1502 ESA-exposed patients compared with 2656 controls, IPTW-adjusted hazard ratios found the ESA cohort had an increased hazard of progressing to VTDR (HR = 3.0 95%CI:2.3-3.8;p < .001) and DME (HR = 3.4,95%CI:2.6-4.4,p < .001), but not PDR (HR = 1.0,95%CI:0.5-2.3,p = .95). Similar results were found within the SCCS which demonstrated higher IRRs for VTDR (IRRs = 1.09-1.18;p < .001) and DME (IRRs = 1.16-1.18;p < .001), but not increased IRRs in PDR (IRR = 0.92-0.97,p = .02-0.39). CONCLUSION: ESAs are associated with higher risks for VTDR and DME, but not PDR. Those studying ESAs as adjunctive therapy for DR should be cautious of possible unintended effects.",

      "abstract": "AIMS: This study aimed to evaluate the effects of hypoxia-inducible factor prolyl hydroxylase inhibitors (HIF-PHIs) on iron metabolism and inflammation in dialysis-dependent chronic kidney disease (DD-CKD) patients. METHODS: PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and ClinicalTrials.gov websites were searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) investigating HIF-PHIs versus ESAs for DD-CKD patients. KEY FINDINGS: Twenty studies with 14,737 participants were included in the meta-analysis, which demonstrated no significant difference in the effect of transferrin saturation and ferritin between HIF-PHIs and the ESAs group (MD, 0.65; 95%CI, -0.45 to 1.75; very low certainty; SMD, -0.03; 95% CI, -0.13 to 0.07; low certainty). However, HIF-PHIs significantly increased the iron (MD, 2.30; 95% CI, 1.40 to 3.20; low certainty), total iron-binding capacity (SMD, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.66 to 0.98; low certainty), and transferrin (SMD, 0.90; 95%CI, 0.74 to 1.05; moderate certainty) levels when compared with the ESAs group. In contrast, the hepcidin level and dosage of intravenous iron were significantly decreased in the HIF-PHIs group compared with the ESAs group (MD, -15.06, 95%CI, -21.96 to -8.16; low certainty; MD, -18.07; 95% CI, -30.05 to -6.09; low certainty). The maintenance dose requirements of roxadustat were independent of baseline CRP or hsCRP levels with respect to the effect on inflammation. SIGNIFICANCE: HIF-PHIs promote iron utilization and reduce the use of intravenous iron therapy. Furthermore, HIF-PHIs, such as roxadustat, maintain the erythropoietic response independent of the inflammatory state. Thus, HIF-PHIs may be an alternative treatment strategy for anemia in DD-CKD patients, where ESA is hyporesponsive due to iron deficiency and inflammation."

METHOD: Five electronic databases were searched for studies. Randomized controlled clinical trials comparing HIF-PHIs, ESAs, and placebo in NDD-CKD patients were selected. The statistical program used for network meta-analysis was Stata/SE 15.1. The main outcomes were the change in hepcidin and hemoglobin (Hb) levels. The merits of intervention measures were predicted by the surface under the cumulative ranking curve method. RESULTS: Of 1,589 original titles screened, data were extracted from 15 trials (3,228 participants). All HIF-PHIs and ESAs showed greater Hb level-raising ability than placebo. Among them, desidustat demonstrated the highest probability of increasing Hb (95.6%). Hepcidin [mean deviation (MD) = -43.42, 95%CI: -47.08 to -39.76], ferritin (MD= -48.56, 95%CI: -55.21 to -41.96), and transferrin saturation (MD = -4.73, 95%CI: -5.52 to -3.94) were decreased, while transferrin (MD = 0.09, 95%CI: 0.01 to 0.18) and total iron-binding capacity (MD = 6.34, 95%CI: 5.71 to 6.96) was increased in HIF-PHIs versus those in ESAs. In addition, this study observed heterogeneity in the ability of HIF-PHIs to decrease hepcidin. Compared with darbepoetin, only daprodustat (MD = -49.09, 95% CI: -98.13 to -0.05) could significantly reduce hepcidin levels. Meanwhile, daprodustat also showed the highest hepcidin-lowering efficacy (84.0%), while placebo was the lowest (8.2%). CONCLUSION: For NDD-CKD patients, HIF-PHIs could ameliorate functional iron deficiency by promoting iron transport and utilization, which may be achieved by decreasing hepcidin levels. Interestingly, HIF-PHIs had heterogeneous effects on iron metabolism.

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: This study was undertaken to evaluate the long-term clinical efficacy of epoetin alfa and darbepoetin alfa in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) in a real-life setting. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 204 patients with low-risk or intermediate-1-risk MDS who received epoetin alfa or darbepoetin alfa were included. Hemoglobin levels and transfusion needs were recorded before treatment and at 12 months, 24 months, 36 months, and 48 months of treatment. RESULTS: At the 36-month (p=0.025) and 48-month (p=0.022) visits, epoetin alfa yielded significantly higher hemoglobin levels compared to darbepoetin alfa. Transfusion needs were also significantly lower with epoetin alfa compared to darbepoetin alfa at 24 months (p=0.012) and in the low-risk group compared to the intermediate-risk group at 24 months (p=0.018), 36 months (p=0.025), and 48 months (p<0.001). Treatment response rates at the 24-month, 36-month, and 48-month visits in the epoetin alfa (43.0%, 33.6%, and 27.1%), darbepoetin alfa (29.9%, 22.7%, and 16.5%), low-risk (39.3%, 30.0%, and 26.0%), and intermediate-risk (29.6%, 24.1%, and 11.1%) groups were lower than those obtained at 12 months, and the values differed significantly for the 36-month and 48-month visits with values ranging from p<0.05 to p<0.001. CONCLUSION: This real-life long-term ESA extension study investigated the clinical efficacy of epoetin alfa and darbepoetin alfa for up to 48 months, revealing that treatment efficacy reached a plateau starting from the 24th month of therapy with a continuing decrease in treatment response rates regardless of treatment type, risk status, or gender. Nonetheless, significantly higher hemoglobin levels and marked improvement in transfusion needs were evident in epoetin-treated patients compared to darbepoetin-treated patients and in the low-risk group compared to the intermediate-risk group.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) are commonly used to treat anaemia in people with chronic kidney disease (CKD). However, their use has been associated with cardiovascular events. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2014. OBJECTIVES: To compare the efficacy and safety of ESAs (epoetin alfa, epoetin beta, darbepoetin alfa, methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta, and biosimilar ESAs against each other, placebo, or no treatment) to treat anaemia in adults with CKD. SEARCH METHODS: In this update, we searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Register of Studies up to 29 April 2022 through contact with the Information Specialist using search terms relevant to this review. Studies in the Register are identified through searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE, conference proceedings, the International Clinical Trials Register (ICTRP) Search Portal and ClinicalTrials.gov. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that included a comparison of an ESA (epoetin alfa, epoetin beta, darbepoetin alfa, methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta, a biosimilar epoetin or a biosimilar darbepoetin alfa) with another ESA, placebo or no treatment in adults with CKD were considered for inclusion. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two independent authors screened the search results and extracted data. Data synthesis was performed using random-effects pairwise meta-analysis (expressed as odds ratios (OR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI)) and network meta-analysis. We assessed for heterogeneity and inconsistency within meta-analyses using standard techniques and planned subgroup and meta-regression to explore sources of heterogeneity or inconsistency. We assessed certainty in treatment estimates for the primary outcomes (preventing blood transfusions and death (any cause)) using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. MAIN RESULTS: Sixty-two new studies (9237 participants) were included in this update, so the review now includes 117 studies with 25,237 participants. Most studies were at high or unclear risk of bias in most methodological domains. Overall, results remain similar in this update compared to our previous review in 2014. For preventing blood transfusion, epoetin alfa (OR 0.28, 95% CI 0.13 to 0.61; low certainty evidence) and epoetin beta (OR 0.19, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.47; low certainty evidence) may be superior to placebo, and darbepoetin alfa was probably superior to placebo (OR 0.27, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.67; moderate certainty evidence). Methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta (OR 0.33, 95% CI 0.11 to 1.02; very low certainty evidence), a biosimilar epoetin (OR 0.34, 95% CI 0.11 to 1.03; very low certainty evidence) and a biosimilar darbepoetin alfa (OR 0.37, 95% CI 0.07 to 1.91; very low certainty evidence) had uncertain effects on preventing blood transfusion compared to placebo. The comparative effects of ESAs compared with another ESA on preventing blood transfusions were uncertain, in low to very low certainty evidence. Effects on death (any cause) were uncertain for epoetin alfa (OR 0.79, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.22; low certainty evidence), epoetin beta (OR 0.69, 95% CI 0.40 to 1.20; low certainty evidence), methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta (OR 1.07, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.71; very low certainty evidence), a biosimilar epoetin (OR 0.80, 95% CI 0.47 to 1.36; low certainty evidence) and a biosimilar darbepoetin alfa (OR 1.63, 95% CI 0.51 to 5.23; very low certainty evidence) compared to placebo. There was probably no difference between darbepoetin alfa and placebo on the odds of death (any cause) (OR 0.99, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.21; moderate certainty evidence). The comparative effects of ESAs compared with another ESA on death (any cause) were uncertain in low to very low certainty evidence. Epoetin beta probably increased the odds of hypertension when compared to placebo (OR 2.17, 95% CI 1.17 to 4.00; moderate certainty evidence). Compared to placebo, epoetin alfa (OR 2.10, 95% CI 1.22 to 3.59; very low certainty evidence), darbepoetin alfa (OR 1.88, 95% CI 1.12 to 3.14; low certainty evidence) and methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta (OR 1.98, 95% CI 1.05 to 3.74; low certainty evidence) may increase the odds of hypertension, but a biosimilar epoetin (OR 1.88, 95% CI 0.96 to 3.67; low certainty evidence) and biosimilar darbepoetin alfa (OR 1.98, 95% CI 0.84 to 4.66; low certainty evidence) had uncertain effects on hypertension. The comparative effects of all ESAs compared with another ESA, placebo or no treatment on cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, stroke, vascular access thrombosis, kidney failure, and breathlessness were uncertain. Network analysis for fatigue was not possible due to sparse data.  AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The comparative effects of different ESAs on blood transfusions, death (any cause and cardiovascular), major cardiovascular events, myocardial infarction, stroke, vascular access thrombosis, kidney failure, fatigue and breathlessness were uncertain.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: This study was conducted to elucidate the safety of roxadustat, an oral medication, in patients with non-dialysis-dependent (NDD) or incident dialysis dialysis-dependent (ID-DD) chronic kidney disease (CKD). METHODS: Safety results from four phase 3, randomized, open-label studies comparing roxadustat to an erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA) in men and women with NDD or ID-DD CKD with anemia were pooled and evaluated. Endpoints were time to major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE; myocardial infarction, stroke, and all-cause mortality) and MACE+ (MACE plus congestive heart failure or unstable angina requiring hospitalization), all-cause mortality, and treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs). MACE and MACE+ were evaluated for non-inferiority at 1.8- and 1.3-margins using hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). TEAEs were descriptively summarized. RESULTS: In total, 2142 patients were evaluated (1083 roxadustat; 1059 ESA). Roxadustat was comparable to ESA for risk of MACE (HR 0.79, 95% CI 0.61-1.02), MACE+ (HR 0.78, 95% CI 0.62-0.98), and all-cause mortality (HR 0.78, 95% CI 0.57-1.05). TEAEs were comparable between roxadustat and ESA groups, including any TEAE [incidence rate per 100 (IR/100) patient-exposure years 56.1 vs. 53.5], TEAEs leading to study drug discontinuation (IR/100 patient-exposure years 6.7 vs. 5.1), and TEAEs leading to death (IR/100 patient-exposure years 6.9 vs. 7.4). CONCLUSION: There was no evidence of increased risk of cardiovascular events or mortality with roxadustat compared with ESA in patients with anemia who have NDD or ID-DD CKD. Although TEAEs occurred commonly in both the roxadustat and ESA groups, patients infrequently discontinued the study drug because of an adverse event.

      "abstract": "Patients with renal anemia are frequently treated with erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs), which are dynamically dosed in order to stabilize blood hemoglobin levels within a specified target range. During typical ESA treatments, a fraction of patients experience hemoglobin 'cycling' periods during which hemoglobin levels periodically over- and undershoot the target range. Here we report a specific mechanism of hemoglobin cycling, whereby cycles emerge from the patient's delayed physiological response to ESAs and concurrent ESA dose adjustments. We introduce a minimal theoretical model that can explain dynamic hallmarks of observed hemoglobin cycling events in clinical time series and elucidates how physiological factors (such as red blood cell lifespan and ESA responsiveness) and treatment-related factors (such as dosing schemes) affect cycling. These results show that in general, hemoglobin cycling cannot be attributed to patient physiology or ESA treatment alone but emerges through an interplay of both, with consequences for the design of ESA treatment strategies.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The prespecified on-treatment analysis of ASCEND-ND (NCT02876835) raised concerns about a higher relative risk of cancer-related adverse events (AEs) with daprodustat vs darbepoetin in patients with anaemia of CKD. This concern was not observed in dialysis patients in ASCEND-D (NCT02879305). METHODS: ASCEND-ND randomized 3872 patients to daprodustat or darbepoetin. ASCEND-D randomized 2964 patients to daprodustat or conventional erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs). In both studies ESA comparators used different dosing intervals (3/week, 1/week, every 2 or every 4 weeks). The prespecified on-treatment approach examined relative risks for cancer AEs up to the last dose date + 1 day. In these analyses, owing to different dosing intervals between arms, Cox models were used to estimate the daprodustat effect by various follow-up periods (censoring at last dose date, last dose date + dosing intervals, or end of study). RESULTS: In ASCEND-ND, the safety of daprodustat vs darbepoetin on cancer-related AEs depended on the duration of follow-up after last dose date: hazard ratio (HR) 1.04 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.77, 1.40] at end of study [HR 1.12 (95% CI 0.81, 1.56) for last dose date + dosing interval; HR 1.50 (95% CI 1.04, 2.15) for last dose date + 1 day]. In ASCEND-D, no excess risk of cancer-related AEs was observed with any model examined. CONCLUSIONS: Prespecified on-treatment analyses for cancer-related AEs appeared to result in biased risk estimates in ASCEND-ND by preferentially under-counting events from patients assigned to darbepoetin. Analyses accounting for longer darbepoetin dosing intervals, or extending follow-up, resulted in attenuation of effect estimates towards neutrality, similar to ASCEND-D, where ESA comparator dosing intervals are closer to daprodustat. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The ASCEND-ND trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02876835); the ASCEND-D trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02879305).",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESA) have an established role in treating anemia in hematological malignancies. However, their role, particularly biosimilar ESA (B-ESA), in myelofibrosis (MF) is not well established. METHODS: This study retrospectively collected data on 96 MF patients treated with B-ESA (alpha/zeta) for the management of anemia to assess safety, efficacy (anemia response [AR]), and survival. RESULTS: Seventy-seven patients (80%) obtained AR. The median time to AR was 2.5 months. In multivariate analysis, significant predictive factors of AR were transfusion independency (p = .006) and ferritin levels <200 ng/ml (p = .009) at baseline. After a median follow-up of 43.8 months from diagnosis, 38 patients (39%) died, 11 (28.9%) from leukemic evolution. Only two patients (2.5%) stopped B-ESA for toxicity. The 24-month survival was significantly affected by response to B-ESA (70.8% in AR vs. 55.3% in non-responder patients, p = .016). In multivariate analysis, age ≤ 70 years (p = .029) and Hb > 8.5 g/dl (p = .047) at baseline were significantly associated with improved survival, with a trend for longer survival in AR patients (p = .06). CONCLUSIONS: B-ESA seems to be an effective and well-tolerated option for anemia treatment in the MF setting. This strategy deserves further clinical investigation.",

      "abstract": "Secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT) is common in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients, and it can suppress erythropoiesis. We aimed to investigate the relationship between the consumption of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) and parathyroidectomy (PTX) in ESRD patients with SHPT and to determine the predictors for anemia improvement. The current standard of chronic kidney disease anemia therapy relies on the prescription of iron supplementation, and ESA. We retrospectively analyzed 81 ESRD patients with PTX at Ditmanson Medical Foundation Chiayi Christian Hospital from July 2004 to Dec 2018. The requirement of ESA therapy markedly declined from a dose of 41.6 (interquartile range [IQR], 0−91.2) to 10.3 (IQR, 0−59.5, p = 0.001) unit/kg/week. In addition, 63.7% of patients required iron replacement therapy preoperatively and the proportion reduced to 52.5% after PTX (p < 0.001). The hemoglobin (Hb) level showed an insignificant change from a median value of 10.7 g/dL (9.5−11.6 g/dL) before PTX to 10.5 g/dL (9.6−11.2 g/dL) at 6 months after PTX. A preoperative Hb level ≤ 10 mg/dL (odds ratio [OR], 20.1; 95% confidence interval [CI], 4.71−125, p < 0.001) and transferrin saturation (TSAT) < 25% (OR, 12.8; 95% CI, 2.51−129, p < 0.001) were predictors for anemia improvement. Our study demonstrated that PTX markedly decreased the requirement of ESA. Patients with a low preoperative Hb level or low TSAT showed an increase in the Hb level after PTX. PTX may be considered not only for SHPT with refractory anemia but also for high ESA-dependent patients.",

Although systematic reviews and meta-analyses have been published in adults, no systematic review has been conducted investigating ESAs in children. METHODS: The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses statement for the conduct of systematic reviews was used. All available literature on outcomes relating to ESAs in children with CKD was sought. A search of the MEDLINE, CINAHL and Embase databases was conducted by two independent reviewers. Inclusion criteria were published trials in English, children with chronic and end-stage kidney disease and use of any ESA studied against any outcome measure. An assessment of risk of bias was carried out in all included randomized trials using the criteria from the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. Two tables were used for data extraction for randomized and observational studies. Study type, participants, inclusion criteria, case characteristics, follow-up duration, ESA type and dosage, interventions and outcomes were extracted by one author. RESULTS: Of 965 identified articles, 58 were included covering 54 cohorts. Six were randomized trials and 48 were observational studies. A total of 38 studies assessed the efficacy of recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO), 11 of darbepoetin alpha (DA) and 3 of continuous erythropoietin receptor activator (CERA), with 6 studies appraising secondary outcome measures exclusively. Recruitment to studies was a consistent challenge. The most common adverse effect was hypertension, although confounding effects often limited direct correlation. Two large cohort studies demonstrated a greater hazard of death independently associated with high ESA dose. Secondary outcome measures included quality of life measures, growth and nutrition, exercise capacity, injection site pain, cardiovascular function, intelligent quotient, evoked potentials and platelet function. CONCLUSIONS: All ESA preparations and modes of administration were efficacious, with evidence of harm at higher doses. Evidence supports individualizing treatments, with strong consideration given to alternate treatments in patients who appear resistant to ESA therapy. Further research should focus on randomized trials comparing the efficacy of different preparations, treatment options in apparently ESA-resistant cohorts and clarification of meaningful secondary outcomes to consolidate patient-relevant indices."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Anaemia is common among cancer patients and they may require red blood cell transfusions. Erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) and iron might help in reducing the need for red blood cell transfusions. However, it remains unclear whether the combination of both drugs is preferable compared to using one drug. OBJECTIVES: To systematically review the effect of intravenous iron, oral iron or no iron in combination with or without ESAs to prevent or alleviate anaemia in cancer patients and to generate treatment rankings using network meta-analyses (NMAs). SEARCH METHODS: We identified studies by searching bibliographic databases (CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase; until June 2021). We also searched various registries, conference proceedings and reference lists of identified trials. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials comparing intravenous, oral or no iron, with or without ESAs for the prevention or alleviation of anaemia resulting from chemotherapy, radiotherapy, combination therapy or the underlying malignancy in cancer patients. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias. Outcomes were on-study mortality, number of patients receiving red blood cell transfusions, number of red blood cell units, haematological response, overall mortality and adverse events. We conducted NMAs and generated treatment rankings. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using GRADE. MAIN RESULTS: Ninety-six trials (25,157 participants) fulfilled our inclusion criteria; 62 trials (24,603 participants) could be considered in the NMA (12 different treatment options). Here we present the comparisons of ESA with or without iron and iron alone versus no treatment. Further results and subgroup analyses are described in the full text. On-study mortality We estimated that 92 of 1000 participants without treatment for anaemia died up to 30 days after the active study period. Evidence from NMA (55 trials; 15,074 participants) suggests that treatment with ESA and intravenous iron (12 of 1000; risk ratio (RR) 0.13, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.01 to 2.29; low certainty) or oral iron (34 of 1000; RR 0.37, 95% CI 0.01 to 27.38; low certainty) may decrease or increase and ESA alone (103 of 1000; RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.35; moderate certainty) probably slightly increases on-study mortality. Additionally, treatment with intravenous iron alone (271 of 1000; RR 2.95, 95% CI 0.71 to 12.34; low certainty) may increase and oral iron alone (24 of 1000; RR 0.26, 95% CI 0.00 to 19.73; low certainty) may increase or decrease on-study mortality. Haematological response We estimated that 90 of 1000 participants without treatment for anaemia had a haematological response. Evidence from NMA (31 trials; 6985 participants) suggests that treatment with ESA and intravenous iron (604 of 1000; RR 6.71, 95% CI 4.93 to 9.14; moderate certainty), ESA and oral iron (527 of 1000; RR 5.85, 95% CI 4.06 to 8.42; moderate certainty), and ESA alone (467 of 1000; RR 5.19, 95% CI 4.02 to 6.71; moderate certainty) probably increases haematological response. Additionally, treatment with oral iron alone may increase haematological response (153 of 1000; RR 1.70, 95% CI 0.69 to 4.20; low certainty). Red blood cell transfusions We estimated that 360 of 1000 participants without treatment for anaemia needed at least one transfusion. Evidence from NMA (69 trials; 18,684 participants) suggests that treatment with ESA and intravenous iron (158 of 1000; RR 0.44, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.63; moderate certainty), ESA and oral iron (144 of 1000; RR 0.40, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.66; moderate certainty) and ESA alone (212 of 1000; RR 0.59, 95% CI 0.51 to 0.69; moderate certainty) probably decreases the need for transfusions. Additionally, treatment with intravenous iron alone (268 of 1000; RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.43 to 1.28; low certainty) and with oral iron alone (333 of 1000; RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.57; low certainty) may decrease or increase the need for transfusions. Overall mortality We estimated that 347 of 1000 participants without treatment for anaemia died overall. Low-certainty evidence from NMA (71 trials; 21,576 participants) suggests that treatment with ESA and intravenous iron (507 of 1000; RR 1.46, 95% CI 0.87 to 2.43) or oral iron (482 of 1000; RR 1.39, 95% CI 0.60 to 3.22) and intravenous iron alone (521 of 1000; RR 1.50, 95% CI 0.63 to 3.56) or oral iron alone (534 of 1000; RR 1.54, 95% CI 0.66 to 3.56) may decrease or increase overall mortality. Treatment with ESA alone may lead to little or no difference in overall mortality (357 of 1000; RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.10; low certainty). Thromboembolic events We estimated that 36 of 1000 participants without treatment for anaemia developed thromboembolic events. Evidence from NMA (50 trials; 15,408 participants) suggests that treatment with ESA and intravenous iron (66 of 1000; RR 1.82, 95% CI 0.98 to 3.41; moderate certainty) probably slightly increases and with ESA alone (66 of 1000; RR 1.82, 95% CI 1.34 to 2.47; high certainty) slightly increases the number of thromboembolic events. None of the trials reported results on the other comparisons. Thrombocytopenia or haemorrhage We estimated that 76 of 1000 participants without treatment for anaemia developed thrombocytopenia/haemorrhage. Evidence from NMA (13 trials, 2744 participants) suggests that treatment with ESA alone probably leads to little or no difference in thrombocytopenia/haemorrhage (76 of 1000; RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.48; moderate certainty). None of the trials reported results on other comparisons. Hypertension We estimated that 10 of 1000 participants without treatment for anaemia developed hypertension. Evidence from NMA (24 trials; 8383 participants) suggests that treatment with ESA alone probably increases the number of hypertensions (29 of 1000; RR 2.93, 95% CI 1.19 to 7.25; moderate certainty). None of the trials reported results on the other comparisons. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: When considering ESAs with iron as prevention for anaemia, one has to balance between efficacy and safety. Results suggest that treatment with ESA and iron probably decreases number of blood transfusions, but may increase mortality and the number of thromboembolic events. For most outcomes the different comparisons within the network were not fully connected, so ranking of all treatments together was not possible. More head-to-head comparisons including all evaluated treatment combinations are needed to fill the gaps and prove results of this review.",

We aimed to compare the incident cancer risk between ESA and non-ESA users with CKD or end-stage renal disease (ESRD). In this retrospective cohort study, all adults newly diagnosed with CKD or ESRD between 2000 and 2012 were enrolled. The study population included 98,748 patients. After case-control matching, 7115 patients were included. The defined daily dose (DDD) of ESA was used as the unit for measuring the amount of ESA prescribed. The primary outcome was the risk of incident malignancy. The secondary outcomes were incident malignancy risk in different tertiles of cumulative ESA doses and the risk of different types of cancers. The risk of incident malignancy was 1.84 times higher with ESA treatment than without ESA treatment (hazard ratio, 1.84; 95% confidence interval, 1.43-2.36; p < 0.001). The malignancy risk was positively correlated with the cumulative dose of ESA (p-for-trend = 0.001) and a significant difference in the high annual cumulative DDD cohort (hazard ratio [HR], 2.39; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.76-3.25; p < 0.001). The risk of genitourinary malignancy was 12.55 times higher with ESA treatment than without ESA treatment (HR, 12.55; 95% CI, 5.78-27.24; p < 0.001). ESA usage is associated with an increased risk of malignancy, particularly genitourinary cancers, in patients with CKD or ESRD. Clinicians should be aware of the occurrence of malignancy, and keep ESA dosage as low as possible.",

To assess the effects of ESA combined with oral or intravenous (IV) iron on relieving CIA, PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) were searched for articles. Data collected in the articles were meta-analyzed using RevMan 5.3 software with a random-effects model. Our comprehensive search yielded 1666 potentially relevant trials. A total of 41 trials randomizing 4200 patients with CIA fulfilled inclusion criteria, including 34 Chinese articles and 7 English articles. Meta-analysis showed that treatment with both ESA and iron more effectively improved CIA relative to iron supplementation alone, with increased hemoglobin, hematocrit, red blood cell count and hematopoietic response rate. Subgroup analyses revealed iron administration, both oral and IV iron, improved anemia in ESA-treated cancer patients with CIA. Our analysis demonstrates that iron supplementation combined with ESA more effectively ameliorates CIA relative to iron supplementation alone, without regard to whether IV or oral iron was used. Together, our findings may contribute to the clinical treatment of CIA using iron therapy with or without ESA.",

This study reviewed the same 100 hemodialysis patient's charts before and after the use of FPC. The data points that were collected and analyzed are as follows: hemoglobin, ferritin levels, average weekly ESA dosing, and IV iron replacement therapy dose. Out of 100 patients, there was no statistical difference in the average hemoglobin, ferritin, and iron saturation levels observed in the patients before and after FPC use. The average weekly dose of darbepoetin alfa per patient was 52.74 μg before the FPC group compared to 39.27 μg in the post FPC group (P < .0001). The total dose of ferric gluconate per patient was 3290.01 mg in the before FPC group and 585.60 mg in the post FPC group (P < .0001). The average total iron sucrose dose per patient in the before FPC group was 3097.92 mg versus 1216.67 mg in the post FPC group (P < .1563). When comparing FPC's cost and implementation into both of our outpatient dialysis centers, this yielded a net savings of $296 751.49."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to aid decision makers by analyzing the impact of introducing biosimilar prescription targets on physician prescribing behavior in the prescription of biologic erythropoiesis-stimulating agents in Germany. METHODS: We combined secondary data of regional level biosimilar prescription targets and secondary data of routinely collected claims data of dispensed prescriptions by physicians operating within the statutory health insurance system in ambulatory care across 7 German regions from 2009 to 2015. Two-way fixed-effects regression analysis was used to identify the average treatment effect of introducing biosimilar prescription targets at the physician level. The main outcome of interest was the share of biosimilar prescriptions on all prescriptions within the substance group. We compared 6 regions that introduced biosimilar prescription targets with 1 region without any prescription target policy. RESULTS: Introducing biosimilar prescription targets increased the average share of biosimilars between 6 percentage points (P < .05) in Hamburg and up to 20 percentage points (P < .001) in Saxony-Anhalt. Stratification of specialists by prescription volume and adoption status indicated heterogeneous effects. We identified similar but higher effects for high-volume prescribers. Disentangling of effects with regard to the composition of biosimilar share suggested that the increase in biosimilar share was driven by increased biosimilar use accompanied by a nonsignificant decrease in original biologics prescriptions. CONCLUSIONS: Prescription targets to alter physician prescribing behavior meet their intended goals by increasing biosimilar share. Physicians partly responded to the policy by decreasing overall prescriptions of the target substance. Prescription targets might be a useful tool, but decision makers need to consider all aspects of potential responses.",

      "abstract": "Hemodialysis (HD) represents a life-sustaining treatment for patients with end-stage renal disease. However, it is associated with several complications, including anemia. Erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) are often administered to HD patients with renal anemia, but a relevant proportion of them fail to respond to the therapy. Since trace metals are involved in several biological processes and their blood levels can be altered by HD, we study the possible association between serum trace metal concentrations and ratios with the administration and response to ESA. For this study, data and sample information of 110 HD patients were downloaded from the UC San Diego Metabolomics Workbench public repository (PR000565). The blood serum levels (and ratios) of antimony, cadmium, copper, manganese, molybdenum, nickel, selenium, tin, and zinc were studied applying an omics statistical approach. The Random Forest model was able to discriminate between HD-dependent patients treated and not treated with ESAs, with an accuracy of 71.7% (95% CI 71.5-71.9%). Logistic regression analysis identifies alterations of Mn, Mo, Cd, Sn, and several of their ratios as characteristic of patients treated with ESAs. Moreover, patients with scarce response to ESAs were shown to be characterized by reduced Mn to Ni and Mn to Sb ratios. In conclusion, our results show that trace metals, in particular manganese, play a role in the mechanisms underlying the human response to ESAs, and if further confirmed, the re-equilibration of their physiological levels could contribute to a better management of HD patients, hopefully reducing their morbidity and mortality.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Erythropoiesis stimulating agents (ESAs) represents the principal treatments for anemia in patients with lower-risk myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). Pre-treatment erythropoietin (EPO) level and previous blood transfusion requirement are the two major predictors for response to ESAs. However, most evidence was derived from Western countries whereas there have been limited data in patients with Asian background. METHODS: We retrospectively collected data on patients with low-risk MDS who received ESAs. Erythroid response was evaluated according to IWG 2006 criteria. MDS subtypes, r-IPSS, baseline hemoglobin (Hb), ESAs dosage and erythropoietin level were reviewed from medical records. Gene mutations were analyzed in patients' blood or bone marrow at diagnosis by 40-gene myeloid panel targeted sequencing. Clinical and laboratory parameters were compared between erythroid responder and non-responder groups. RESULTS: A total of 47 patients were recruited in the study. The median age at diagnosis of the patients in this cohort was 77 years (IQR, 70-83) and 44.7% were male. The median revised international prognostic scoring system (R-IPSS) score of patients was 2.5. Response rate to ESAs was 46.8% (22/47). Median EPO level in responders was significantly lower than non-responders (27.7 vs. 59.1 U/L, p=0.02). Median ESAs dosage in responder group was 30,000 units per week. Cytogenetic abnormalities were detected in 27.3% and 24% of the responder and non-responder groups, respectively. Of 22 patients with available 40 gene mutation targeted sequencing, ASXL1, IDH2 and TET2 represented the 3 most common mutations and were found in 22%, 22% and 17%, respectively. There were no differences in cytogenetic abnormalities and gene mutations between groups. Patients who responded to ESAs showed a higher 5-year overall survival (OS) compared to non-responders (5-year OS 75% vs. 60.9%; p=0.008). CONCLUSION: We conclude that a low serum EPO level is a predictive factor for responsiveness to ESAs in Asian patients with low-risk MDS.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) are commonly used to treat anemia due to chronic kidney disease (CKD). In addition to drug acquisition costs, the administration of ESAs can include direct and indirect costs due to the needle-based route of administration (eg, time spent by health care staff administering therapy, and patients' and caregivers' time spent receiving or assisting with therapy). However, a comprehensive assessment of the costs associated with the administration of ESAs is lacking. OBJECTIVE: To estimate the excess costs associated with the needle-based administration of ESAs for the treatment of anemia due to non-dialysis-dependent (NDD) CKD in the United States in 2019 from a societal perspective. METHODS: Excess costs associated with ESA administration were estimated as the sum of annual costs that could be avoided with the introduction of an oral treatment with comparable safety and efficacy to ESAs. Cost components included direct health care costs, transportation costs, and work productivity loss costs from the perspective of both patients and caregivers (as applicable). Costs were estimated based on scientific publications, governmental agencies, and the results of a recent survey of US patients and caregivers of patients with anemia and CKD. The setting of the administration (ie, at home vs in clinic), frequency of administration, and insurance type were considered. RESULTS: At the societal level, annual excess costs associated with ESA administration were estimated at $2.5 billion in the United States in 2019, based on an estimated 462,005 patients with anemia and NDD-CKD treated with ESAs. Overall, 94.4% ($2.4 billion) of these costs were incurred from in-clinic ESA administration. When stratifying costs by insurance type, Medicare-insured patients accounted for 79.4% ($2.0 billion) of total annual excess costs. The largest contributor to total annual excess costs was direct health care costs ($1.4 billion, 54.9%), followed by patient work productivity loss costs ($846 million, 33.9%), caregiver work productivity loss costs ($197 million, 7.9%), and transportation costs ($81 million, 3.3%). Total annual excess costs of in-clinic administration ranged from $2,572 per patient receiving monthly administration to $20,948 per patient receiving thrice-weekly administration, while the total annual excess costs of at-home administration ranged from $1,123 per patient receiving monthly administration to $2,109 per patient receiving thrice-weekly administration. At the ESA administration level (ie, for each ESA administration), total excess costs were estimated at $128 per in-clinic ESA administration and $7 per at-home ESA administration, excluding monitoring costs. CONCLUSIONS: The needle-based administration of ESAs in patients with NDD-CKD is associated with a substantial economic burden. The introduction of an oral treatment has the potential to result in important cost savings from a societal perspective.

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) are the current standard of care for anemia due to chronic kidney disease (CKD) in patients not undergoing dialysis. Molidustat, an oral hypoxia-inducible factor prolyl hydroxylase inhibitor, is being investigated as an alternative treatment for renal anemia. Molidustat was evaluated in five phase 3 studies, the molidustat once daily improves renal anemia by inducing erythropoietin (MIYABI) program. The present study investigated the safety and efficacy of molidustat in Japanese patients with renal anemia not undergoing dialysis and previously treated with ESAs. METHODS: This was a 52-week, active-controlled, randomized (1:1), open-label, parallel-group, multicenter, phase 3 study in Japanese patients with anemia due to CKD (stages 3-5). Molidustat was initiated at 25 mg or 50 mg once daily according to previous ESA dose. The ESA darbepoetin alfa (darbepoetin) was initiated at a starting dose in accordance with the previous ESA dose and injected subcutaneously once every 2 or 4 weeks. Doses were regularly titrated to maintain hemoglobin (Hb) levels in the target range of 11.0-13.0 g/dL. The primary efficacy outcome was the mean Hb level and its change from baseline during the evaluation period (weeks 30-36). The safety outcomes included evaluation of all adverse events. RESULTS: In total, 164 patients were randomized to receive molidustat (n = 82) or darbepoetin (n = 82). Baseline characteristics were well balanced. Mean (standard deviation) Hb levels at baseline were 11.31 (0.68) g/dL for molidustat and 11.27 (0.64) g/dL for darbepoetin. The mean (95% confidence interval [CI]) for mean Hb levels during the evaluation period for molidustat (11.67 [11.48-11.85] g/dL) and darbepoetin (11.53 [11.31-11.74] g/dL) was within the target range. Based on a noninferiority margin of 1.0 g/dL, molidustat was noninferior to darbepoetin regarding the change in mean Hb level during the evaluation period from baseline, with a least squares mean (95% CI) difference (molidustat-darbepoetin) of 0.13 (-0.15, 0.40) g/dL. The proportion of patients who reported at least 1 treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) was 92.7% for molidustat and 96.3% for darbepoetin. TEAEs leading to death were reported in 2 patients (2.4%) in the molidustat group and none in the darbepoetin group; serious TEAEs were reported in 32.9% and 26.8% of patients, respectively. DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION: Molidustat was noninferior to darbepoetin and maintained Hb levels in the prespecified target range in patients with renal anemia not undergoing dialysis and previously treated with ESA. Molidustat was well tolerated, and no new safety signal was observed.",

      "abstract": "Anemia is a common complication of cancer. Treatment of anemia in cancer is crucial as anemia adversely affects the quality of life, therapeutic outcomes, and overall survival. Erythropoiesis stimulating agents (ESAs) are valuable drugs for treating cancer-related anemia. Cardiovascular adverse effects are a significant concern with ESA therapy, and there is wide variability in therapeutic goals and characteristics of patients who undergo treatment with ESAs. As a result, a careful analysis of the currently available data on the efficacy and safety of these drugs is necessary. This data analysis will aid in the rational use of ESAs for the treatment of anemia in cancer. The objective of this systematic review is to elucidate the pathogenesis of anemia in cancer, assess the effectiveness of ESAs in treating anemia in cancer, and the overall risk of cardiovascular adverse effects associated with the use of ESAs and their impact on prognosis. We searched literature from online databases - PubMed, PubMed Central, MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, and clinical trials register (clinicaltrials.gov) to identify prospective phase II and phase III randomized controlled trials (RCTs). We chose RCTs that directly compared patients with cancer who were treated with ESAs to those who were not treated with ESAs. January 2008 was taken as the lower date limit and May 2021 as the upper date limit. Only English language literature and human studies were included. The quality appraisal was completed using the Cochrane risk bias assessment tool, and data from a total of 10,738 patients with cancer in 17 RCTs were identified and included for systematic review. Our review concludes that ESAs effectively reduce the necessity for blood transfusions and increase mean hemoglobin levels in anemic cancer patients. ESA therapy is associated with cardiovascular adverse effects, including venous thromboembolism, thrombophlebitis, hypertension, ischemic heart disease, cardiac failure, arrhythmia, arterial thromboembolism, and cardiac arrest. Aggressive ESA dosing to achieve higher hemoglobin levels and preexisting uncontrolled hypertension increases these cardiovascular side effects. Venous thromboembolism is the most significant adverse effect attributed to ESA therapy. However, there is no major change in overall survival with ESA therapy, and administration of ESAs can be carried out in anemic cancer patients with careful assessment of thromboembolism risk factors, risk-benefit ratio, and monitoring of hemoglobin levels."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Variation in de-adoption of ineffective or unsafe treatments is not well-understood. We examined de-adoption of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESA) in anemia treatment among patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) following new clinical evidence of harm and ineffectiveness (the TREAT trial) and the FDA's revision of its safety warning. METHOD: We used a segmented regression approach to estimate changes in use of epoetin alfa (EPO) and darbepoetin alfa (DPO) in the commercial, Medicare Advantage (MA) and Medicare fee-for-service (FFS) populations. We also examined how changes in both trends and levels of use were associated with physicians' characteristics. RESULTS: Use of DPO and EPO declined over the study period. There were no consistent changes in DPO trend across insurance groups, but the level of DPO use decreased right after the FDA revision in all groups. The decline in EPO use trend was faster after the TREAT trial for all groups. Nephrologists were largely more responsive to evidence than primary care physicians. Differences by physician's gender, and age were not consistent across insurance populations and types of ESA. CONCLUSIONS: Physician specialty has a dominant role in prescribing decision, and that specializations with higher use of treatment (nephrologists) were more responsive to new evidence of unsafety and ineffectiveness.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: For anaemic elective surgery patients, current clinical practice guidelines weakly recommend the routine use of iron, but not erythrocyte-stimulating agents (ESAs), except for short-acting ESAs in major orthopaedic surgery. This recommendation is, however, not based on any cost-effectiveness studies. The aim of this research was to (1) systematically review the literature regarding cost effectiveness of preoperative iron and/or ESAs in anaemic, elective surgery patients and (2) update existing economic evaluations (EEs) with recent data. METHODS: Eight databases and registries were searched for EEs and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) reporting cost-effectiveness data on November 11, 2020. Data were extracted, narratively synthesized and critically appraised using the Philips reporting checklist. Pre-existing full EEs were updated with effectiveness data from a recent systematic review and current cost data. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were expressed as cost per (quality-adjusted) life-year [(QA)LY] gained. RESULTS: Only five studies (4 EEs and 1 RCT) were included, one on intravenous iron and four on ESAs + oral iron. The EE on intravenous iron only had an in-hospital time horizon. Therefore, cost effectiveness of preoperative iron remains uncertain. The three EEs on ESAs had a lifetime time horizon, but reported cost per (QA)LY gained of 20-65 million (GBP or CAD). Updating these analyses with current data confirmed ESAs to have a cost per (QA)LY gained of 3.5-120 million (GBP or CAD). CONCLUSIONS: Cost effectiveness of preoperative iron is unproven, whereas routine preoperative ESA therapy cannot be considered cost effective in elective surgery, based on the limited available data. Future guidelines should reflect these findings.",

We investigated the relationships among the dosage of ESA, erythropoietin resistance index (ERI) scores, and mortality in Chinese MHD patients. METHODS: This multicenter observational retrospective study included MHD patients from 16 blood purification centers (n = 824) who underwent HD in 2011-2015 and were followed up until December 31, 2016. We collected demographic variables, HD parameters, laboratory values, and ESA dosages. Patients were grouped into quartiles according to ESA dosage to study the effect of ESA dosage on all-cause mortality. The ERI was calculated as follows: ESA (IU/week)/weight (kg)/hemoglobin levels (g/dL). We also compared outcomes among the patients stratified into quartiles according to ERI scores. We used the Cox proportional hazards model to measure the relationships between the ESA dosage, ERI scores, and all-cause mortality. Using propensity score matching, we compared mortality between groups according to ERI scores, classified as either > or ≤12.80. RESULTS: In total, 824 patients were enrolled in the study; 200 (24.3%) all-cause deaths occurred within the observation period. Kaplan-Meier analyses showed that patients administered high dosages of ESAs had significantly worse survival than those administered low dosages of ESAs. A multivariate Cox regression identified that high dosages of ESAs could significantly predict mortality (ESA dosage >10,000.0 IU/week, HR = 1.59, 95% confidence intervals (CIs) (1.04, 2.42), and p = 0.031). Our analysis also indicated a significant increase in the risk of mortality in patients with high ERI scores. Propensity score matching-analyses confirmed that ERI > 12.80 could significantly predict mortality (HR = 1.56, 95% CI [1.11, 2.18], and p = 0.010). CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggested that ESA dosages >10,000.0 IU/week in the first 3 months constitute an independent predictor of all-cause mortality among Chinese MHD patients. A higher degree of resistance to ESA was related to a higher risk of all-cause mortality.",

In this work, we assessed the potential of oxidative stress parameters to predict the response to erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) in lower-risk MDS patients. To this end, we analyzed the systemic levels of reactive species (peroxides and NO), antioxidant defenses (uric acid, vitamin E, vitamin A, GSH, GSSG, TAS, as well as GPX and GR activities], and oxidative damage (8-OH-dG and MDA) in 66 MDS patients, from those 44 have been treated with ESA. We also calculated the peroxides/TAS and NO/TAS ratios and analyzed the gene expression of levels of the redox regulators, NFE2L2 and KEAP1. We found that patients that respond to ESA treatment showed lower levels of plasma peroxides (p < 0.001), cellular GSH (p < 0.001), and cellular GR activity (p = 0.001) when compared to patients who did not respond to ESA treatment. ESA responders also showed lower levels of peroxides/TAS ratio (p < 0.001) and higher levels of the expression of the NFE2L2 gene (p = 0.001) than those that did not respond to ESA treatment. The levels of plasmatic peroxides shown to be the most accurate biomarker of ESA response, with good sensitivity (80%) and specificity (100%) and is an independent biomarker associated with therapy response. Overall, the present study demonstrated a correlation between oxidative stress levels and the response to ESA treatment in lower-risk MDS patients, with the plasmatic peroxides levels a good predictive biomarker of drug (ESA) response."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Recent studies have suggested that erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) may accelerate not only angiogenesis but also vasculogenesis, beyond erythropoiesis. METHODS: We conducted a 12-week prospective study in 51 dialysis patients; 13 were treated with recombinant human erythropoietin (EPO, 5290.4 ± 586.9 IU/week), 16 with darbepoetin (DA, 42.9 ± 4.3 µg/week), 12 with epoetin β pegol (CERA, 40.5 ± 4.1 µg/week) and 10 with no ESAs. Vascular mediators comprising endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2), and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) were measured at 0 and 12 weeks. EPCs were measured by flow cytometry as CD45lowCD34+CD133+ cells. RESULTS: The EPC count increased significantly to a greater extent in the EPO group than in the other three group, and increased significantly from 0 to 12 weeks in a EPO dose-dependent manner. In both the DA and CERA groups, the EPC count did not change at 12 weeks. Serum levels of VEGF, MMP-2 and hs-CRP were not affected by ESA treatment in all groups. In the CERA group, serum ferritin decreased significantly compared to the no-ESA group and correlated with CERA dose, although use of iron was permitted if required during the prospective study period of 12 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: When patients on dialysis were treated with clinical doses of various ESAs, only EPO induced a significant increase of circulating EPCs from bone marrow, whereas, DA and CERA had no effect.",

      "abstract": "Patient Blood Management (PBM) is an evidence-based, multidisciplinary, patient-centred approach to optimizing the care of patients who might need a blood transfusion. This systematic review aimed to collect the best available evidence on the effectiveness of preoperative iron supplementation with or without erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) on red blood cell (RBC) utilization in all-cause anaemic patients scheduled for elective surgery. Five databases and two trial registries were screened. Primary outcomes were the number of patients and the number of RBC units transfused. Effect estimates were synthesized by conducting meta-analyses. GRADE (Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation) was used to assess the certainty of evidence. We identified 29 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and 2 non-RCTs comparing the effectiveness of preoperative iron monotherapy, or iron + ESAs, to control (no treatment, usual care, placebo). We found that: (1) IV and/or oral iron monotherapy may not result in a reduced number of units transfused and IV iron may not reduce the number of patients transfused (low-certainty evidence); (2) uncertainty exists whether the administration route of iron therapy (IV vs oral) differentially affects RBC utilization (very low-certainty evidence); (3) IV ferric carboxymaltose monotherapy may not result in a different number of patients transfused compared to IV iron sucrose monotherapy (low-certainty evidence); (4) oral iron + ESAs probably results in a reduced number of patients transfused and number of units transfused (moderate-certainty evidence); (5) IV iron + ESAs may result in a reduced number of patients transfused (low-certainty evidence); (6) oral and/or IV iron + ESAs probably results in a reduced number of RBC units transfused in transfused patients (moderate-certainty evidence); (7) uncertainty exists about the effect of oral and/or IV iron + ESAs on the number of patients requiring transfusion of multiple units (very low-certainty evidence). Effect estimates of different haematological parameters and length of stay were synthesized as secondary outcomes. In conclusion, in patients with anaemia of any cause scheduled for elective surgery, the preoperative administration of iron monotherapy may not result in a reduced number of patients or units transfused (low-certainty evidence). Iron supplementation in addition to ESAs probably results in a reduced RBC utilization (moderate-certainty evidence).",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Erythropoiesis stimulating agents are exogenous erythropoietin medications that are used to stimulate the bone marrow red blood cells' production for the management of anemia of chronic kidney disease, some anticancer drugs, myelodysplastic syndrome, and others. Currently, there are different erythropoiesis stimulating agents accessible in the market. The objective of this narrative literature review is to summarize the role of some erythropoiesis stimulating agents in the treatment of anemia. METHODS: The following method was used to prepare this narrative literature review. The comprehensive computerized search of literatures was carried out using PubMed, Cochrane library, Google scholar, and Science direct. Keywords such as recombinant human erythropoietin, epoetin, darbepoetin, continuous erythropoietin receptor agonist, pegzyrepoetin alfa, erythropoiesis stimulating agents in combination with anemia/anaemia were used. The pertinent original and review full articles which are written in the English language were included in this narrative review. RESULTS: From the discussions of the literature, erythropoiesis stimulating agents that are produced by different biosimilar manufacturers have different clinical characteristics and stabilities as a result of their chemical modifications. The chemical modifications of erythropoiesis stimulating agents like glycosylation and polyethylene glycosylation determine the half-life, affinity to erythropoietin receptor, and immune response of the agents. Erythro-poiesis stimulating agents are categorized as short-acting and long-acting agents due to their chemical structures that influence the clinical efficacy and safety of the agents. CONCLUSIONS: The effectiveness of the agents is different in different patients depending on the individual characteristics and etiologies of anemia. The agents not only have the benefits but also, they have the risks for the patients. Hence, the risks and benefits of erythropoiesis stimulating agents must be given special consideration in the managements of anemia to get maximum efficacy for anemic patients. The treatment is dependent on hemoglobin levels of individual patients. The physician must follow the patients during and after therapy using erythropoiesis stimulating agents.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Because of increasing safety concerns related to erythropoiesisstimulating agents (ESAs), the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services issued a Medicare reimbursement policy change regarding these medications in cancer patients. However, the policy established an absolute hemoglobin or hematocrit threshold to qualify for reasonable use but did not take the effect of gender and racial/ethnic differences in hemoglobin levels into consideration. OBJECTIVE: To examine disparities in the use of ESAs and blood transfusions after the Medicare policy change. METHODS: This study was an exploratory treatment effectiveness study and used the SEER-Medicare linked database. The treatment group was composed of cancer patients, whereas the control group was composed of chronic kidney disease patients. An interrupted time series design was used to examine the effect of the Medicare policy change on the use of ESAs and blood transfusions in different gender and racial/ethnic groups. RESULTS: The Medicare reimbursement policy change had an immediate effect on reducing the use of ESAs by 50% and increasing the use of blood transfusions by 10%. The immediate effect of the policy change on the monthly utilization of ESAs was 2 times greater in females (60% reduction) than males (30% reduction). Females had a 10% immediate increase in the monthly utilization of blood transfusions after the policy change. The policy change had the same immediate effect of a 50% reduction on the use of ESAs for Whites, African Americans/Blacks, and Latinos. African Americans/Blacks had a 50% immediate increase in the monthly utilization of blood transfusions after the policy change. CONCLUSIONS: Gender and racial/ethnic disparities were associated with the Medicare reimbursement policy change in the use of ESAs and blood transfusions. Thus, future policy considerations should keep biologic differences across gender and racial/ethnic groups in mind. DISCLOSURES: This study was funded by the SPARC Research Grant. The funder had no role in any part of this study. The authors have nothing to disclose.",

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: Erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs), are used for treating chronic kidney disease (CKD)-related anemia, contributing to CKD costs. The study was aimed at investigating direct healthcare costs of CKD patients treated with ESAs and the potential savings achievable by increasing the use of biosimilars and preventing inappropriate ESA use. METHODS: A multi-center, cohort study was conducted using claims databases of five large Italian geographic areas. Yearly mean direct healthcare costs per patient were estimated, stratifying by CKD stage. The total yearly cost and potential savings related to ESA use were estimated: (a) considering 25/50/75% of originator ESA substitution with biosimilars; (b) eliminating inappropriate ESA dispensing. RESULTS: During the study period, the ESA-related yearly mean cost represented 17% of total yearly costs in stage I-III, decreasing to 13% in stage IV-V and 6% in dialysis. Among originator users, assuming a 25% of biosimilar uptake, the annual cost-savings of ESA treatment would represent 10.5% of total ESA costs in CKD stage I-V and 7.7% in dialysis. Among incident ESA users for which hemoglobin levels were available, 9% started inappropriately ESA treatment, increasing to 62.0% during the first year of maintenance therapy. Hypothesizing prevention of the first inappropriate ESA dispensing, the total yearly cost-savings would amount to €35 772, increasing to €167 641 eliminating the inappropriate dispensing during maintenance therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Higher use of lowest cost ESA, prevention of inappropriate ESA use as well as other strategies aimed at slowing down the progressive renal impairment are essential for minimizing clinical and economic burden of CKD.",

Due to adverse events and presumed negative effects on disease-progression and survival, erythropoiesis-stimulating agents are not frequently used. In this study, we assess the efficacy and safety of intravenous ferric carboxymaltose (FCM) to treat cancer-induced anemia (CIA). PATIENTS AND METHODS: We recruited adult cancer patients on active chemotherapy with a hemoglobin (Hb) level ⩽11.0 g/dL. Based on serum ferritin (sFr) and transferrin saturation (TSAT), patients were divided into 3 groups: group I (absolute iron deficiency, n = 26) with sFr < 30 ng/mL and TSAT < 20%; group II (functional iron deficiency, n = 24) with sFr 30-800 ng/mL and TSAT < 20%; and patients with TSAT ⩾ 20% were placed in group III as \"others\" (n = 34). All patients were treated with intravenous FCM. Serum hepcidin and C-reactive protein were used as biomarkers to predict response. RESULTS: A total of 84 patients with a median age (SD) of 53.8 (10.6) were recruited. Baseline median Hb level was 10.2 (range: 8.3-11.0) gm/dL. At week 12, there was a significant increment in Hb level for patients in groups I and II (median increment: 2.35 and 1.5 gm/dL, respectively), with limited response observed in group III, and most of the increment noted as early as week 3 (⩾1.0 g/dL). Responders tended to have lower levels of hepcidin. No clinically significant adverse events were reported; however, asymptomatic hypophosphatemia was observed in 39 (46.4%) patients. CONCLUSIONS: Intravenous FCM is a safe and effective treatment option for the management of a subgroup of patients with CIA.The study was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov [Identifier: NCT04246021]."

Our secondary objectives were adverse events and mortality. BACKGROUND: Anaemia is common in ICU patients, and currently, the standard therapy is RBC transfusion, which is known to be associated with adverse events. ESA could potentially reduce the need for RBC transfusion. METHODS: EMBASE, Cochrane and PubMed were searched up to January 2020. RESULTS: A total of 1357 articles were identified, of which 18 articles met the inclusion criteria for the qualitative synthesis. Eight of these studies were used in the meta-analyses. Comparing ESA vs control group, there was a small reduction in the proportion of patients who received one or more RBC transfusions (relative risk [RR] 0.88; confidence interval [CI] 0.78-1.00, moderate certainty). The change in Hb concentration was trivial (mean difference -0.31 g/dL; CI -0.51 to -0.05, high certainty). The number of serious adverse events (RR 1.02; 0.90-1.15, low certainty) and the overall short-term mortality were similar (RR 0.80; CI 0.61-1.05, low certainty) between the groups. CONCLUSION: ESA resulted in a small reduction in the proportion of patients transfused and a trivial increase in haemoglobin concentration, both of questionable clinical relevance, without impacting adverse events or mortality. These results do not support the routine use of ESA to treat anaemia in critically ill adults.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Preterm infants have low plasma levels of erythropoietin (EPO), providing a rationale for the use of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) to prevent or treat anaemia and to provide neuro protection and protection against necrotising enterocolitis (NEC). Darbepoetin (Darbe) and EPO are currently available ESAs. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness and safety of ESAs (erythropoietin (EPO) and/or Darbe) initiated early (before eight days after birth) compared with placebo or no intervention in reducing red blood cell (RBC) transfusions, adverse neurological outcomes, and feeding intolerance including necrotising enterocolitis (NEC) in preterm and/or low birth weight infants. Primary objective for studies that primarily investigate the effectiveness and safety of ESAs administered early in reducing red blood cell transfusions: To assess the effectiveness and safety of ESAs initiated early in reducing red blood cell transfusions in preterm infants. Secondary objectives: Review authors performed subgroup analyses of low (≤ 500 IU/kg/week) and high (> 500 IU/kg/week) doses of EPO and the amount of iron supplementation provided: none, low (≤ 5 mg/kg/d), and high (> 5 mg/kg/d). Primary objective for studies that primarily investigate the neuro protective effectiveness of ESAs: To assess the effectiveness and safety of ESAs initiated early in reducing adverse neurological outcomes in preterm infants. Primary objective for studies that primarily investigate the effectiveness of EPO or Darbe administered early in reducing feeding intolerance: To assess the effectiveness and safety of ESAs administered early in reducing feeding intolerance (and NEC) in preterm infants. Other secondary objectives: To compare the effectiveness of ESAs in reducing the incidence of adverse events and improving long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes. SEARCH METHODS: We used the standard search strategy of Cochrane Neonatal to search the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2017, Issue 2), MEDLINE via PubMed (1966 to 10 March 2017), Embase (1980 to 10 March 2017), and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL; 1982 to 10 March 2017). We searched clinical trials databases, conference proceedings, and reference lists of retrieved articles for randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials of early initiation of EAS treatment versus placebo or no intervention in preterm or low birth weight infants. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used the methods described in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions and the GRADE approach to assess the quality of evidence. MAIN RESULTS: This updated review includes 34 studies enrolling 3643 infants. All analyses compared ESAs versus a control consisting of placebo or no treatment. Early ESAs reduced the risk of 'use of one or more [red blood cell] RBC transfusions' (typical risk ratio (RR) 0.79, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.74 to 0.85; typical risk difference (RD) -0.14, 95% CI -0.18 to -0.10; I2 = 69% for RR and 62% for RD (moderate heterogeneity); number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 7, 95% CI 6 to 10; 19 studies, 1750 infants). The quality of the evidence was low. Necrotising enterocolitis was significantly reduced in the ESA group compared with the placebo group (typical RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.52 to 0.91; typical RD -0.03, 95% CI -0.05 to -0.01; I2 = 0% for RR and 22% for RD (low heterogeneity); NNTB 33, 95% CI 20 to 100; 15 studies, 2639 infants). The quality of the evidence was moderate. Data show a reduction in 'Any neurodevelopmental impairment at 18 to 22 months' corrected age in the ESA group (typical RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.48 to 0.80; typical RD -0.08, 95% CI -0.12 to -0.04; NNTB 13, 95% CI 8 to 25. I2 = 76% for RR (high heterogeneity) and 66% for RD (moderate); 4 studies, 1130 infants). The quality of the evidence was low. Results reveal increased scores on the Bayley-II Mental Development Index (MDI) at 18 to 24 months in the ESA group (weighted mean difference (WMD) 8.22, 95% CI 6.52 to 9.92; I2 = 97% (high heterogeneity); 3 studies, 981 children). The quality of the evidence was low. The total volume of RBCs transfused per infant was reduced by 7 mL/kg. The number of RBC transfusions per infant was minimally reduced, but the number of donors to whom infants who were transfused were exposed was not significantly reduced. Data show no significant difference in risk of stage ≥ 3 retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) with early EPO (typical RR 1.24, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.90; typical RD 0.01, 95% CI -0.02 to 0.04; I2 = 0% (no heterogeneity) for RR; I2 = 34% (low heterogeneity) for RD; 8 studies, 1283 infants). Mortality was not affected, but results show significant reductions in the incidence of intraventricular haemorrhage (IVH) and periventricular leukomalacia (PVL). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Early administration of ESAs reduces the use of red blood cell (RBC) transfusions, the volume of RBCs transfused, and donor exposure after study entry. Small reductions are likely to be of limited clinical importance. Donor exposure probably is not avoided, given that all but one study included infants who had received RBC transfusions before trial entry. This update found no significant difference in the rate of ROP (stage ≥ 3) for studies that initiated EPO treatment at less than eight days of age, which has been a topic of concern in earlier versions of this review. Early EPO treatment significantly decreased rates of IVH, PVL, and NEC. Neurodevelopmental outcomes at 18 to 22 months and later varied in published studies. Ongoing research should evaluate current clinical practices that will limit donor exposure. Promising but conflicting results related to the neuro protective effect of early EPO require further study. Very different results from the two largest published trials and high heterogeneity in the analyses indicate that we should wait for the results of two ongoing large trials before drawing firm conclusions. Administration of EPO is not currently recommended because limited benefits have been identified to date. Use of darbepoetin requires further study.",

In 2007-2008, regulatory notifications advised of venous thromboembolism and mortality risks while the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services' restricted ESA initiation to patients with hemoglobin <10 g/dl. In 2010, a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies required consent prior to administration. We evaluated ESA utilization from 2003 to 2012 and obtained private health insurer claims data for persons with lung, colorectal, or breast cancer from 2001 to 2012. ESA use for CIA was determined by an ESA claim after chemotherapy, up to 6 months after treatment. We identified 839,948 commercially insured patients, including 24,785 patients with ESA-treated CIA (3.2%). Darbepoetin use increased 3.9-fold from 2003 to 2007 (12.3% to 48.7%) and then decreased 95% to 2.6% by 2012. Epoetin use decreased 90% from 2003 to 2012 (30.3% to 3.1%). Between 2003 and 2012, mean epoetin dosing decreased 0.8-fold (244,979 in 2003 vs. 196,216 units in 2012), but increased 1.8-fold for darbepoetin-treated CIA (262 in 2003 to 467 μg in 2012). Among CIA patients, transfusions were low (4.5%) in 2002-2007, then increased 2.2-fold between 2008 and 2012. Safety initiatives between 2007 and 2010 facilitated reductions in ESA use combined with changes in coverage. These data show the efficacy of regulatory efforts, publication of adverse events and changes in reimbursement in reducing use of ESAs. Future studies are warranted to optimize deimplementation strategies to improve patient safety.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Improved responsiveness to erythropoiesis stimulating agents (ESAs) in patients on on-line post-dilution hemodiafiltration (Post-HDF) compared with conventional hemodialysis (HD) was reported by some authors but challenged by others. This prospective, cross-over randomized study tested the hypothesis that an alternative infusion modality of HDF, mixed-dilution HDF (Mixed HDF), could further reduce ESAs requirement in dialysis patients compared to the traditional Post-HDF. METHODS: One-hundred-twenty prevalent patients from 6 Dialysis Centers were randomly assigned to two six-months treatment sequences: A-B and B-A (A, Mixed HDF; B, Post-HDF). Primary outcome was comparative evaluation of ESA (darbepoetin alfa) requirement and ESA resistance. Treatments efficiency, iron and vitamins status, inflammation and nutrition parameters were monitored. RESULTS: In sequence A, darbepoetin requirement decreased during Mixed HDF from 29.5 to 23.7 µg/month and increased significantly during Post-HDF (32.3 µg/month at 6th month) while, in sequence B, it increased during Post-HDF from 38.2 to 43.7 µg/month and decreased during Mixed HDF (23.9 µg/month at 6th month). Overall, EPO doses at 6 months on Mixed and Post-HDF were 23.8 and 38.4 µg/month, respectively, P < 0.01. A multiple linear model confirmed that Mixed HDF vs Post-HDF reduced significantly ESA requirement and ESA resistance (P < 0.0001), by a mean of 29% (CI 23-35%) in the last three months of the observation periods. CONCLUSIONS: Mixed HDF decreased darbepoetin-alfa requirement in dialysis patients. This might help preventing the untoward side effects of high ESA doses, besides having a remarkable economic impact. Additional evidence is needed to confirm this potential benefit of Mixed-HDF.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Preterm infants have low plasma levels of erythropoietin (EPO), providing a rationale for the use of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) to prevent or treat anaemia. Darbepoetin (Darbe) and EPO are currently available ESAs. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness and safety of late initiation of ESAs, between eight and 28 days after birth, in reducing the use of red blood cell (RBC) transfusions in preterm or low birth weight infants. SEARCH METHODS: We used the standard search strategy of Cochrane Neonatal to search the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2018, Issue 5), MEDLINE via PubMed (1966 to 5 June 2018), Embase (1980 to 5 June 2018), and CINAHL (1982 to 5 June 2018). We searched clinical trials databases, conference proceedings, and the reference lists of retrieved articles for randomised controlled trials and quasi-randomised trials. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials of late initiation of EPO treatment (started at ≥ eight days of age) versus placebo or no intervention in preterm (< 37 weeks) or low birth weight (< 2500 grams) neonates. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We performed data collection and analyses in accordance with the methods of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group. We used the GRADE approach to assess the quality of the evidence. MAIN RESULTS: We include 31 studies (32 comparisons) randomising 1651 preterm infants. Literature searches in 2018 identified one new study for inclusion. No new on-going trials were identified and no studies used darbepoetin. Most included trials were of small sample size. The meta-analysis showed a significant effect on the use of one or more RBC transfusions (21 studies (n = 1202); typical risk ratio (RR) 0.72, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.65 to 0.79; typical risk difference (RD) -0.17, 95% CI -0.22 to -0.12; typical number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 6, 95% CI 5 to 8). There was moderate heterogeneity for this outcome (RR I² = 66%; RD I² = 58%). The quality of the evidence was very low. We obtained similar results in secondary analyses based on different combinations of high/low doses of EPO and iron supplementation. There was no significant reduction in the total volume (mL/kg) of blood transfused per infant (typical mean difference (MD) -1.6 mL/kg, 95% CI -5.8 to 2.6); 5 studies, 197 infants). There was high heterogeneity for this outcome (I² = 92%). There was a significant reduction in the number of transfusions per infant (11 studies enrolling 817 infants; typical MD -0.22, 95% CI -0.38 to -0.06). There was high heterogeneity for this outcome (I² = 94%). Three studies including 404 infants reported on retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) (all stages or stage not reported), with a typical RR 1.27 (95% CI 0.99 to 1.64) and a typical RD of 0.09 (95% CI -0.00 to 0.18). There was high heterogeneity for this outcome for both RR (I² = 83%) and RD (I² = 82%). The quality of the evidence was very low.Three trials enrolling 442 infants reported on ROP (stage ≥ 3). The typical RR was 1.73 (95% CI 0.92 to 3.24) and the typical RD was 0.05 (95% CI -0.01 to 0.10). There was no heterogeneity for this outcome for RR (I² = 18%) but high heterogeneity for RD (I² = 79%). The quality of the evidence was very low.There were no significant differences in other clinical outcomes including mortality and necrotising enterocolitis. For the outcomes of mortality and necrotising enterocolitis, the quality of the evidence was moderate. Long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes were not reported. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Late administration of EPO reduces the use of one or more RBC transfusions, the number of RBC transfusions per infant (< 1 transfusion per infant) but not the total volume (mL/kg) of RBCs transfused per infant. Any donor exposure is likely not avoided as most studies included infants who had received RBC transfusions prior to trial entry. Late EPO does not significantly reduce or increase any clinically important adverse outcomes except for a trend in increased risk for ROP. Further research of the use of late EPO treatment, to prevent donor exposure, is not indicated. Research efforts should focus on limiting donor exposure during the first few days of life in sick neonates, when RBC requirements are most likely to be required and cannot be prevented by late EPO treatment. The use of satellite packs (dividing one unit of donor blood into many smaller aliquots) may reduce donor exposure.",

      "abstract": "Anemia is a major complication of chronic kidney disease (CKD) that leads to many symptoms of this disease and worsens cardiovascular health. Treatment of this condition was revolutionized three decades ago by the commercial availability of recombinant human erythropoietin which held the promise of completely eliminating the need for red blood cell transfusion (RBCT). Despite specific therapy now available for anemia in CKD, clinical data accumulated in the last 2 decades suggests that there is a continued need for RBCT, which, we surmise, is due to underutilization of Erythropoietin Stimulating Agents (ESA) or clinical settings such as active bleed, bone marrow resistance such as myelofibrosis or infections where ESAs are ineffective. The purpose of this narrative review is to highlight the adverse effects and summarize the current patterns of RBCT use in all stages of CKD while elaborating on the clinical characteristics of patients that increases their risks of transfusion exposure. We discuss, briefly, salient features of the pathophysiology of anemia in CKD and its contemporary therapies while presenting our perspectives on how to optimize transfusion strategies without compromising patient safety.",

The objectives of this study were to investigate the frequency and identify the potential predictors of switching between biosimilar and originator ESAs during the first year of treatment in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), or chemotherapy-related anemia from six large Italian geographic areas in the years 2009-2015. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted using six Italian regional claims databases (≥ 13 million inhabitants) during 2009-2015. Among incident epoetin users, the frequency of single, multiple, and backward switch during the first year of treatment was evaluated. Using frailty Cox models, potential predictors of first switch were identified. All analyses were stratified by the main indications for use. RESULTS: Among 102,240 incident epoetin users, 15,853 (15.5%) switched to another epoetin during the first year of therapy; only 18% of these switched to biosimilars. Single switch was more common (62.2% of the switchers) than multiple (23.5%) or backward switch (14.3%). In cancer, the cumulative number of transfusions and iron preparations dispensed, as well as hyperparathyroidism, were predictors of switching. In CKD, the cumulative number of transfusions, number of vitamin A/D preparations dispensed, and CKD severity increased the probability of switching. CONCLUSIONS: Switching between ESAs was frequent in both CKD and cancer patients. The number of cumulative transfusions and severity of disease seemed to affect the switch.",

We compared cardiovascular outcomes and all-cause mortality associated with monthly methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta with those of the shorter-acting agents epoetin alfa/beta and darbepoetin alfa in patients with anemia of CKD. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: We conducted a multicenter, open-label, noninferiority trial in which patients were randomized to receive methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta or reference erythropoiesis-stimulating agents, stratified by maintenance or correction treatment status and C-reactive protein level. The trial had a prespecified noninferiority margin of 1.20 for the hazard ratio (HR) for the primary end point (a composite of all-cause mortality, nonfatal myocardial infarction or stroke, adjudicated by an independent blinded committee). This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00773513. RESULTS: In total, 2818 patients underwent randomization, received methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta or a reference agent, and were followed for a median of 3.4 years (maximum, 8.4 years). In the modified intention-to-treat analysis, a primary end point event occurred in 640 (45.4%) patients in the methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta arm, and 644 (45.7%) in the reference arm (HR 1.03; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 0.93 to 1.15, P=0.004 for noninferiority). All-cause mortality was not different between treatment groups (HR 1.06; 95% CI, 0.94 to 1.19). Results in patient subgroups on dialysis or treated in the correction or maintenance settings were comparable to the primary analysis. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with anemia of CKD, once-monthly methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta was noninferior to conventional, shorter-acting erythropoiesis-stimulating agents with respect to rates of major adverse cardiovascular events or all-cause mortality.",

Erythropoietin-stimulating agents (ESAs) have immune-modulating and anti-apoptotic effects. However, their safety and efficacy in critically ill patients remain uncertain. We evaluated whether ESAs, administered to critically unwell adult patients admitted to the ICU, reduced mortality at hospital discharge. METHODS: The search strategy was conducted according to a predetermined protocol and included OVID MEDLINE, OVID EMBASE and The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials from inception until 20 May 2019. Publications were eligible for inclusion if they were randomized controlled trials (RCTs) including adult patients admitted to an ICU, that identified and reported a group receiving ESA therapy compared to a group not receiving ESA therapy and reported mortality. There were no language restrictions. RESULTS: The systematic review included 21 studies with 5452 participants. In-hospital mortality, reported in 16 studies of which only one was at low risk of bias, was lower in the ESA group (276 of 2187 patients, 12.6%) than the comparator group (339 out of 2204 patients, 15.4%), [relative risk (RR) 0.82, 95% CI 0.71-0.94, P = 0.006, I2 = 0.0%]. The RR of SAEs and thromboembolic events for the ESA and comparator groups were similar, RR 1.11 (95% CI 0.94-1.31, P = 0.228, I2 66%) and 1.22 (95% CI 0.95-1.58, P = 0.086, I2 47%), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: In heterogenous populations of critically ill adults, evidence from RCTs of mainly low or unclear quality, suggests that ESA therapy may decrease mortality.",

We performed a systematic review and identified only nine eligible studies.

In seven trials with sequential drug administration (n = 393), erythroid response rates ranged from 12% to 71% after full-doses of ESA alone (60,000-80,000 rHuEPO equivalents/week) and from 35% to 74% after combination therapy. Our analysis supports an additional efficacy of G-CSF added to low-/standard-dose ESA, but the available data remains controversial, if G-CSF is added to full-dose ESA.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Preterm infants have low plasma levels of erythropoietin (EPO), providing a rationale for the use of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) to prevent or treat anaemia. Darbepoetin (Darbe) and EPO are currently available ESAs. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness and safety of late initiation of ESAs, between eight and 28 days after birth, in reducing the use of red blood cell (RBC) transfusions in preterm or low birth weight infants. SEARCH METHODS: We used the standard search strategy of Cochrane Neonatal to search the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2018, Issue 5), MEDLINE via PubMed (1966 to 5 June 2018), Embase (1980 to 5 June 2018), and CINAHL (1982 to 5 June 2018). We searched clinical trials databases, conference proceedings, and the reference lists of retrieved articles for randomised controlled trials and quasi-randomised trials. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials of late initiation of EPO treatment (started at ≥ eight days of age) versus placebo or no intervention in preterm (< 37 weeks) or low birth weight (< 2500 grams) neonates. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We performed data collection and analyses in accordance with the methods of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group. We used the GRADE approach to assess the quality of the evidence. MAIN RESULTS: We include 31 studies (32 comparisons) randomising 1651 preterm infants. Literature searches in 2018 identified one new study for inclusion. No new on-going trials were identified and no studies used darbepoetin.Most included trials were of small sample size. The meta-analysis showed a significant effect on the use of one or more RBC transfusions (21 studies (n = 1202); typical risk ratio (RR) 0.72, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.65 to 0.79; typical risk difference (RD) -0.17, 95% CI -0.22 to -0.12; typical number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 6, 95% CI 5 to 8). There was moderate heterogeneity for this outcome (RR I² = 66%; RD I² = 58%). The quality of the evidence was very low. We obtained similar results in secondary analyses based on different combinations of high/low doses of EPO and iron supplementation. There was no significant reduction in the total volume (mL/kg) of blood transfused per infant (typical mean difference (MD) -1.6 mL/kg, 95% CI -5.8 to 2.6); 5 studies, 197 infants). There was high heterogeneity for this outcome (I² = 92%). There was a significant reduction in the number of transfusions per infant (11 studies enrolling 817 infants; typical MD -0.22, 95% CI -0.38 to -0.06). There was high heterogeneity for this outcome (I² = 94%).Three studies including 404 infants reported on retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) (all stages or stage not reported), with a typical RR 1.27 (95% CI 0.99 to 1.64) and a typical RD of 0.09 (95% CI -0.00 to 0.18). There was high heterogeneity for this outcome for both RR (I² = 83%) and RD (I² = 82%). The quality of the evidence was very low.Three trials enrolling 442 infants reported on ROP (stage ≥ 3). The typical RR was 1.73 (95% CI 0.92 to 3.24) and the typical RD was 0.05 (95% CI -0.01 to 0.10). There was no heterogeneity for this outcome for RR (I² = 18%) but high heterogeneity for RD (I² = 79%). The quality of the evidence was very low.There were no significant differences in other clinical outcomes including mortality and necrotising enterocolitis. For the outcomes of mortality and necrotising enterocolitis, the quality of the evidence was moderate. Long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes were not reported. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Late administration of EPO reduces the use of one or more RBC transfusions, the number of RBC transfusions per infant (< 1 transfusion per infant) but not the total volume (mL/kg) of RBCs transfused per infant. Any donor exposure is likely not avoided as most studies included infants who had received RBC transfusions prior to trial entry. Late EPO does not significantly reduce or increase any clinically important adverse outcomes except for a trend in increased risk for ROP. Further research of the use of late EPO treatment, to prevent donor exposure, is not indicated. Research efforts should focus on limiting donor exposure during the first few days of life in sick neonates, when RBC requirements are most likely to be required and cannot be prevented by late EPO treatment. The use of satellite packs (dividing one unit of donor blood into many smaller aliquots) may reduce donor exposure.",

The ESA-related risk in patients with hematological neoplasms remains unclear. We, therefore, aimed to assess the ESA-related risk of VTE, myocardial infarction (MI), and stroke in patients with multiple myeloma (MM) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a population-based cohort study in Denmark, using medical databases to identify 2,114 MDS patients and 3,105 MM patients diagnosed in 2004-2013. Incidence rates per 1,000 person-years and hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for VTE, MI, and stroke associated with ESA treatment were computed. HRs were calculated in time-dependent Cox regression and adjusted for age, sex, MDS prognosis group, comorbidities, and treatments. RESULTS: Incidence rates per 1,000 person-years for VTE, MI, and stroke were 10.8, 8.2, and 16.0 in MDS patients, and 21.9, 10.2 and 9.9 in MM patients without ESA treatment, respectively. MDS patients with ESA treatment had a 1.6-fold increased risk of MI (HR 1.60 [95% CI 0.90-2.86]) and an almost twofold increased risk of stroke (HR 1.94 [95% CI 1.28-2.94]). Adjusted HR for VTE was 1.04 (95% CI 0.57-1.89) compared with MDS patients without ESAs. In MM patients with ESAs compared with patients without ESAs, HRs were 1.41 (95% CI 0.96-2.08) for VTE, 1.23 (95% CI 0.68-2.20) for MI, and 1.63 (95% CI 0.96-2.77) for stroke. CONCLUSION: ESA use was associated with stroke in MDS patients. Among MM patients, ESA treatment was associated with a higher risk of all cardiovascular events, although all CIs included equivalence."

Embase, Medline, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews were searched from their establishment until October 2017. SLRs related to the use of short-acting and long-acting ESAs in the treatment of CIA and CKD-IA were included. Forty-eight studies met the inclusion criteria. The evidence suggests little difference in efficacy, HRQoL, and safety outcomes among ESA types. Cost-effectiveness and market price are likely to become determining factors driving the choice of agent. Comparative studies and costing models accounting for the utilization of biosimilars are needed to establish which ESAs are more cost-effective.",

The International Prognostic Score System (IPSS) groups MDS in lower-risk (IPSS low and intermediate-1) and higher-risk disease (IPSS intermediate-2 and high). AML transformation is the main concern in higher-risk MDS, while anemia and transfusion dependency represent the major issues for low-risk MDS patients. Improving erythropoiesis, and eliminating fatigue and symptoms, is the main therapeutic goal for low-risk MDS patients. Around 50% of MDS patients present with anemia with an Hb level < 100 g/L. Severe anemia increases the negative effects of comorbidities, such as heart and lung failure.

METHODS: In this open-label Phase 2 trial, vadadustat was evaluated in 94 subjects receiving hemodialysis, previously maintained on epoetin alfa. Subjects were sequentially assigned to one of three vadadustat dose cohorts by starting dose: 300 mg once daily (QD), 450 mg QD or 450 mg thrice weekly (TIW). The primary endpoint was mean hemoglobin (Hb) change from pre-baseline average to midtrial (Weeks 7-8) and end-of-trial (Weeks 15-16) and was analyzed using available data (no imputation). RESULTS: Overall, 80, 73 and 68% of subjects in the 300 mg QD, 450 mg QD, and 450 mg TIW dose cohorts respectively, completed the study. For all dose cohorts no statistically significant mean change in Hb from pre-baseline average was observed, and mean Hb concentrations-analyzed using available data-remained stable at mid- and end-of-trial. There was one subject with an Hb excursion >13 g/dL. Overall, 83% of subjects experienced an adverse event (AE); the proportion of subjects who experienced at least one AE was similar among the three dose cohorts. The most frequently reported AEs were nausea (11.7%), diarrhea (10.6%) and vomiting (9.6%). No deaths occurred during the study. No serious AEs were attributed to vadadustat. CONCLUSIONS: Vadadustat maintained mean Hb concentrations in subjects on hemodialysis previously receiving epoetin. These data support further investigation of vadadustat to assess its long-term safety and efficacy in subjects on hemodialysis.",

The study was a cost-minimisation analysis from the hospital perspective. Only direct medical costs were considered. RESULTS: This study demonstrated that therapeutic management of anaemia with methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta would save medical and nurse time (7 days and 15 days per year, respectively) and reduce costs by €59,960 a year for an active file of 40 patients undergoing haemodialysis, assuming a 100% occupancy rate in the above-mentioned hospital.

METHODS: We collected data of the patients with diagnosis of CKD on conservative treatment from nine Italian structures. Patients were enrolled applying different exclusion criteria, and various individual parameters were registered at the beginning for descriptive analysis. Patients were treated with epoetin alfa, beta, and darbepoetin as originator and epoetin zeta as biosimilar. Hemoglobin levels have been analyzed at baseline and after 3, 6, and 12 months. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze the results. RESULTS: At baseline, 47 patients were in the biosimilar group and 57 in the originator; the basal level of hemoglobin was similar between the groups (mean Hb 9.4 and 9.3 g/dL, respectively). Median age, weight, and comorbidities were almost comparable. After 3 months, 44 patients remained in the biosimilar group and 48 in the originator; hemoglobin increase was significantly greater in patients treated with biosimilar [absolute increase 1.6 vs 1.0 g/dL, p < 0.001]. After 6 and 12 months, number of patients fall furthermore. Hemoglobin levels increased more in the biosimilar group after 6 months (2.1 vs 1.1 g/dL, p < 0.001) and 12 months (2.0 vs 1.0 g/dL, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Biosimilar ESAs have similar risk/benefit profile compared to originators. Our data are in agreement with relevant scientific literature and, on the other hand, they are in contrast with common thought that considers biosimilar less efficacious and less safe than originators.",

Prematurity has been shown to alter neurometabolite levels in children in studies using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS). OBJECTIVE: We hypothesized that ESA treatment in premature infants would tend to normalize neurometabolites by 4-6 years of age. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Children in a longitudinal study of neurodevelopment underwent MRI and 1H-MRS at approximately 4 years and 6 years of age. Prematurely born children (500-1,250 g birth weight) received ESAs (erythropoietin or darbepoetin) or placebo during their neonatal hospitalization, and these groups were compared to healthy term controls. 1H-MRS spectra were obtained from the anterior cingulate (gray matter) and frontal lobe white matter, assessing combined N-acetylaspartate and N-acetylaspartylglutamate (tNAA), myo-inositol, choline compounds (Cho), combined creatine and phosphocreatine, and combined glutamate and glutamine. RESULTS: No significant (P≤0.5) group differences were observed for any metabolite level. Significant age-related increases in white-matter tNAA and Cho were observed, as well as a trend for increased gray-matter tNAA. CONCLUSION: Neither prematurity nor neonatal ESA treatment was associated with differences in brain metabolite levels in the children of this study at a significance level of 0.05. These findings suggest that earlier differences that might have existed had normalized by 4-6 years of age or were too small to be statistically significant in the current sample.",

Erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) may play a role in treating these patients with anemia of unknown etiology (AUE). This study examines hemoglobin and cardiovascular outcomes among elderly anemic patients treated with ESAs. We conducted a retrospective cohort study that included all anemic patients older than age 60 years who had erythropoietin (EPO) measured between 2005 and 2013 at a single center. Three independent reviewers used defined criteria to assign each patient's anemia to 1 of 4 groups: chronic kidney disease (CKD), myelodysplastic syndrome, AUE, or other etiology. Logistic regression was used to compare treatment response (defined per the International Working Group response criteria in myelodysplasia). Adjusted Cox regression analysis was used to calculate the cardiovascular event hazard ratios associated with ESA treatment. A total of 570 patients met the inclusion criteria, of whom 101 received ESAs. There was a nonstatistically significant but quantitatively better response in AUE (47%) and CKD (54%) compared with other etiologies (22%). The adjusted odds ratio for response in AUE compared with other etiologies was 3.3 (95% confidence interval, 0.838-13.0). A baseline EPO level <200 IU/L independently predicted treatment response. There was no statistically significant difference in cardiovascular events or cardiovascular event-free survival between the treated and untreated groups after adjusting for confounders. Our results suggest that ESAs may effectively treat AUE, and responses may be similar to those in CKD. We could not detect a statistically significant increase in cardiovascular events in the studied cohort."

We requested CSRs for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) in cancer patients from EMA and identified RCT publications with literature searches. We assessed CSR availability and completeness, the impact of unreported and unpublished data obtained from CSRs on the effects of ESAs on quality of life (QoL) of cancer patients, and discrepancies between data reported in the public domain and in CSRs. We used random-effects meta-analyses to evaluate the effect of ESAs on QoL measured with Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Anemia (FACT-An), FACT-Fatigue (FACT-F) and FACT-Anemia Total (FACT-An Total) stratified by data source and the impact of discrepancies on QoL, mortality, adverse events, and clinical effectiveness outcomes. We identified 94 eligible RCTs; CSRs or other study documentation were available for 17 (18%) RCTs at EMA. Median report length was 1,825 pages (range 72-14,569). Of 180 outcomes of interest reported in the EMA documentation, 127 (71%) were publicly available. For 80 of those (63%) we noted discrepancies, but these had little impact on the pooled effect estimates. Of 27 QoL outcomes reported in the CSRs, 17 (63%) were unpublished. Including six unpublished comparisons (pooled mean difference [MD] 0.20; 95% confidence interval [CI] -1.93, 2.33) reduced the pooled effect of ESAs for FACT-An from MD 5.51 (95% CI 4.20, 6.82) in published data to MD 3.21 (95% CI 1.38, 5.03), which is below a clinically important difference (defined as MD ≥4). Effects were similar for FACT-F and FACT-An Total. Access to CSRs from EMA reduced reporting biases for QoL outcomes. However, EMA received documentation for a fraction of all RCTs on effects of ESAs in cancer patients. Additional efforts by other agencies and institutions are needed to make CSRs universally available for all RCTs.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Preterm infants have low plasma levels of erythropoietin (EPO), providing a rationale for the use of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) to prevent or treat anaemia and to provide neuro protection and protection against necrotising enterocolitis (NEC). Darbepoetin (Darbe) and EPO are currently available ESAs. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness and safety of ESAs (erythropoietin (EPO) and/or Darbe) initiated early (before eight days after birth) compared with placebo or no intervention in reducing red blood cell (RBC) transfusions, adverse neurological outcomes, and feeding intolerance including necrotising enterocolitis (NEC) in preterm and/or low birth weight infants. Primary objective for studies that primarily investigate the effectiveness and safety of ESAs administered early in reducing red blood cell transfusions:To assess the effectiveness and safety of ESAs initiated early in reducing red blood cell transfusions in preterm infants. Secondary objectives:Review authors performed subgroup analyses of low (≤ 500 IU/kg/week) and high (> 500 IU/kg/week) doses of EPO and the amount of iron supplementation provided: none, low (≤ 5 mg/kg/d), and high (> 5 mg/kg/d). Primary objective for studies that primarily investigate the neuro protective effectiveness of ESAs:To assess the effectiveness and safety of ESAs initiated early in reducing adverse neurological outcomes in preterm infants. Primary objective for studies that primarily investigate the effectiveness of EPO or Darbe administered early in reducing feeding intolerance:To assess the effectiveness and safety of ESAs administered early in reducing feeding intolerance (and NEC) in preterm infants. Other secondary objectives:To compare the effectiveness of ESAs in reducing the incidence of adverse events and improving long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes. SEARCH METHODS: We used the standard search strategy of Cochrane Neonatal to search the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2017, Issue 2), MEDLINE via PubMed (1966 to 10 March 2017), Embase (1980 to 10 March 2017), and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL; 1982 to 10 March 2017). We searched clinical trials databases, conference proceedings, and reference lists of retrieved articles for randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials of early initiation of EAS treatment versus placebo or no intervention in preterm or low birth weight infants. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used the methods described in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions and the GRADE approach to assess the quality of evidence. MAIN RESULTS: This updated review includes 34 studies enrolling 3643 infants. All analyses compared ESAs versus a control consisting of placebo or no treatment.Early ESAs reduced the risk of 'use of one or more [red blood cell] RBC transfusions' (typical risk ratio (RR) 0.79, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.74 to 0.85; typical risk difference (RD) -0.14, 95% CI -0.18 to -0.10; I2 = 69% for RR and 62% for RD (moderate heterogeneity); number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 7, 95% CI 6 to 10; 19 studies, 1750 infants). The quality of the evidence was low.Necrotising enterocolitis was significantly reduced in the ESA group compared with the placebo group (typical RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.52 to 0.91; typical RD -0.03, 95% CI -0.05 to -0.01; I2 = 0% for RR and 22% for RD (low heterogeneity); NNTB 33, 95% CI 20 to 100; 15 studies, 2639 infants). The quality of the evidence was moderate.Data show a reduction in 'Any neurodevelopmental impairment at 18 to 22 months' corrected age in the ESA group (typical RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.48 to 0.80; typical RD -0.08, 95% CI -0.12 to -0.04; NNTB 13, 95% CI 8 to 25. I2 = 76% for RR (high heterogeneity) and 66% for RD (moderate); 4 studies, 1130 infants). The quality of the evidence was low.Results reveal increased scores on the Bayley-II Mental Development Index (MDI) at 18 to 24 months in the ESA group (weighted mean difference (WMD) 8.22, 95% CI 6.52 to 9.92; I2 = 97% (high heterogeneity); 3 studies, 981 children). The quality of the evidence was low.The total volume of RBCs transfused per infant was reduced by 7 mL/kg. The number of RBC transfusions per infant was minimally reduced, but the number of donors to whom infants who were transfused were exposed was not significantly reduced. Data show no significant difference in risk of stage ≥ 3 retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) with early EPO (typical RR 1.24, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.90; typical RD 0.01, 95% CI -0.02 to 0.04; I2 = 0% (no heterogeneity) for RR; I2 = 34% (low heterogeneity) for RD; 8 studies, 1283 infants). Mortality was not affected, but results show significant reductions in the incidence of intraventricular haemorrhage (IVH) and periventricular leukomalacia (PVL). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Early administration of ESAs reduces the use of red blood cell (RBC) transfusions, the volume of RBCs transfused, and donor exposure after study entry. Small reductions are likely to be of limited clinical importance. Donor exposure probably is not avoided, given that all but one study included infants who had received RBC transfusions before trial entry. This update found no significant difference in the rate of ROP (stage ≥ 3) for studies that initiated EPO treatment at less than eight days of age, which has been a topic of concern in earlier versions of this review. Early EPO treatment significantly decreased rates of IVH, PVL, and NEC. Neurodevelopmental outcomes at 18 to 22 months and later varied in published studies. Ongoing research should evaluate current clinical practices that will limit donor exposure. Promising but conflicting results related to the neuro protective effect of early EPO require further study. Very different results from the two largest published trials and high heterogeneity in the analyses indicate that we should wait for the results of two ongoing large trials before drawing firm conclusions. Administration of EPO is not currently recommended because limited benefits have been identified to date. Use of darepoetin requires further study.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: In hemodialysis patients on ferric citrate hydrate, the increase in ferritin level is mainly due to the administration of the compound. We investigated possible other factors associated with ferritin level and how erythropoietin resistance index and erythropoiesis in those patients were affected. We looked at ferritin-elevating factors using data from a Japanese phase III long-term clinical trial of ferric citrate hydrate. METHODS: The factors with a strong association with ferritin levels at week 28 were selected by the process of variable selection. In addition, selected factors were analyzed by Mixed Model for Repeated Measurement. Subjects were divided into 3 groups by quantiles (<Q1, Q1-Q3, Q3<) of the most strongly correlated factors. Then the least-squares means of change of ferritin at each time point for each group were calculated. Finally, the differences of the least-squares means were examined. Changes of both erythropoiesis-stimulating agent dose and erythropoietin resistance index for each group were investigated. The differences in mean erythropoietin resistance index between groups at baseline, week 28, and week 52 were analyzed using t tests. RESULTS: Dose of ferric citrate hydrate showed the strongest correlation with change of ferritin and the second strongest was the reduction of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents. The mean erythropoietin resistance index was lowered in group <Q1. Group <Q1 showed significantly lower levels of ferritin at baseline. DISCUSSION: It is suggested that not only iron load but also the erythropoiesis-stimulating agent dose reduction may be involved in ferritin elevation during ferric citrate hydrate treatment, resulting in a decrease of erythropoietin resistance index."

Treatment strategies aim to improve anemia and quality of life, as well as iron overload due to red blood cell transfusion support. To promote proliferation and differentiation of erythropoiesis, erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) such as erythropoietin (EPO) and mimetics are applied as first-line therapy in a large fraction of lower-risk MDS patients. In general, ESAs yield favorable responses in about half of the patients, although responses are often short-lived. In fact, many ESA-refractory patients harbor defects in late-stage erythropoiesis downstream of EPO action. Novel transforming growth factor (TGF)-β superfamily inhibitors sotatercept and luspatercept represent a promising approach to alleviate anemia by stimulating erythroid differentiation.",

      "abstract": "Anemia, complicating the course of chronic kidney disease, is a significant parameter, whether interpreted as subjective impairment or an objective prognostic marker. Renal anemia is predominantly due to relative erythropoietin (EPO) deficiency. EPO inhibits apoptosis of erythrocyte precursors. Studies using EPO substitution have shown that increasing hemoglobin (Hb) levels up to 10-11 g/dL is associated with clinical improvement. However, it has not been unequivocally proven that further intensification of erythropoiesis stimulating agent (ESA) therapy actually leads to a comprehensive benefit for the patient, especially as ESAs are potentially associated with increased cerebro-cardiovascular events. Recently, new developments offer interesting options not only via stimulating erythropoeisis but also by employing additional mechanisms. The inhibition of activin, a member of the transforming growth factor superfamily, has the potential to correct anemia by stimulating liberation of mature erythrocyte forms and also to mitigate disturbed mineral and bone metabolism as well. Hypoxia-inducible factor prolyl hydroxylase inhibitors also show pleiotropic effects, which are at the focus of present research and have the potential of reducing mortality. However, conventional ESAs offer an extensive body of safety evidence, against which the newer substances should be measured. Carbamylated EPO is devoid of Hb augmenting effects whilst exerting promising tissue protective properties. Additionally, the role of hepcidin antagonists is discussed. An innovative new hemodialysis blood tube system, reducing blood contact with air, conveys a totally different and innocuous option to improve renal anemia by reducing mechanical hemolysis."

OBJECTIVE: To document the time required and the cost in terms of nursing time to prepare and administer ESAs to patients on facility based haemodialysis (HD) with anaemia due to CKD before and after the introduction of long-acting ESAs. DESIGN: A time and motion study was implemented at four HD units in Australia to determine the time and costs associated with preparing and administering ESAs before and after the introduction of long-acting ESAs. PARTICIPANTS: This was a prospective, observational study of workplace practices at four HD units in Australia. MEASUREMENTS: Outcome data included the time taken to prepare, and administer ESAs. RESULTS: The time costs of preparation and administration per patient per year had a wide variability within each unit and ranged from Australian AUD$55.75 (38 euros) to AUD$90.49 (62 euros) before the introduction of long-acting ESAs. This dropped by 73-80% following the introduction of long-acting ESAs, representing an annual cost savings of between AUD$2,591 and AUD$5,914 if all patients on HD were switched to a long acting ESA. CONCLUSION: Switching from a short-acting to a long-acting ESA in HD units leads to a significant reduction in time costs of health professionals in preparation and administration of ESAs by up to 80%. Practical application: This time and motion study has added further evidence on reduction of human effort by taking advantages of new research development, such as the long acting ESAs.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Anaemia is a common problem experienced by critically-ill people. Treatment with erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) has been used as a pharmacologic strategy when the blunted response of endogenous erythropoietin has been reported in critically-ill people. The use of ESAs becomes more important where adverse clinical outcomes of transfusing blood products is a limitation. However, this indication for ESAs is not licensed by regulatory authorities and is called off-label use. Recent studies concern the harm of ESAs in a critical care setting. OBJECTIVES: To focus on harms in assessing the effects of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs), alone or in combination, compared with placebo, no treatment or a different active treatment regimen when administered off-label to critically-ill people. SEARCH METHODS: We conducted a systematic search of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO via OvidSP, CINAHL, all evidence-based medicine (EBM) reviews including IPA and SCI-Expanded, Conference Proceedings Citation Index- Science, BIOSIS Previews and TOXLINE up to February 2017. We also searched trials registries, checked reference lists of relevant studies and tracked their citations by using SciVerse Scopus. SELECTION CRITERIA: We considered randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and controlled observational studies, which compared scheduled systemic administration of ESAs versus other effective interventions, placebo or no treatment in critically-ill people. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently screened and evaluated the eligibility of retrieved records, extracted data and assessed the risks of bias and quality of the included studies. We resolved differences in opinion by consensus or by involving a third review author. We assessed the evidence using GRADE and created a 'Summary of findings' table. We used fixed-effect or random-effects models, depending on the heterogeneity between studies. We fitted three-level hierarchical Bayesian models to calculate overall treatment effect estimates. MAIN RESULTS: Of the 27,865 records identified, 39 clinical trials and 14 observational studies, including a total of 945,240 participants, were eligible for inclusion. Five studies are awaiting classification. Overall, we found 114 adverse events in 33 studies (30 RCTs and three observational studies), and mortality was reported in 41 studies (32 RCTs and nine observational studies). Most studies were at low to moderate risk of bias for harms outcomes. However, overall harm assessment and reporting were of moderate to low quality in the RCTs, and of low quality in the observational studies. We downgraded the GRADE quality of evidence for venous thromboembolism and mortality to very low and low, respectively, because of risk of bias, high inconsistency, imprecision and limitations of study design.It is unclear whether there is an increase in the risk of any adverse events (Bayesian risk ratio (RR) 1.05, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.93 to 1.21; 3099 participants; 9 studies; low-quality evidence) or venous thromboembolism (Bayesian RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.41; 18,917 participants; 18 studies; very low-quality evidence).There was a decreased risk of mortality with off-label use of ESAs in critically-ill people (Bayesian RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.61 to 0.92; 930,470 participants; 34 studies; low-quality evidence). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Low quality of evidence suggests that off-label use of ESAs may reduce mortality in a critical care setting. There was a lack of high-quality evidence about the harm of ESAs in critically-ill people. The information for biosimilar ESAs is less conclusive. Most studies neither evaluated ESAs' harm as a primary outcome nor predefined adverse events. Any further studies of ESA should address the quality of evaluating, recording and reporting of adverse events.",

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: Evaluate changes in use of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) and red blood cell transfusion in cancer patients receiving myelosuppressive chemotherapy following regulatory and reimbursement actions. METHODS: Calendar year patient cohorts (2005-2013) with breast, colorectal, lung, multiple myeloma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, ovarian, or prostate cancer and receiving myelosuppressive chemotherapy were identified within the Marketscan database. Incidence of ESA treatment and transfusion were estimated in each year, as was median number of ESA administrations. Clinical characteristics associated with ESA administration and transfusions were evaluated by using multivariable logistic regression. Additionally, annual new ESA user cohorts within the Oncology Services Comprehensive Electronic Records database (2011-2014) were examined to assess hemoglobin levels at ESA initiation. RESULTS: Across all tumor types, ESA use decreased substantially (breast cancer: 53.7 to 3.2%; lung cancer: 66.0 to 13.3%, non-Hodgkin lymphoma: 39.8 to 3.8%), transfusion use increased (2 to 5.5%, 5.5 to 18.2%, and 4.5 to 9.1%, respectively), and median number of ESA administrations declined. Across all tumor types, proportion of patients initiating an ESA with hemoglobin >10 g/dL was <10% from 2011 onward. In recent years, cancer patients who are older, female, and have chronic kidney disease or moderate or severe liver disease were most likely to receive ESAs. CONCLUSION: Subsequent to important regulatory and reimbursement ESA-related actions, total ESA exposure among cancer patients receiving myelosuppressive chemotherapy declined substantially. Today, fewer patients receive ESA therapy, and among those treated, more are initiated at hemoglobin levels <10 g/dL and are exposed for a shorter duration, consistent with current product labeling.",

Using PubMed a systematic review was carried out on articles published from 1985 to September 2016, as well as a review of the main Spanish, European, and American consensus guidelines on each of the following diseases in which could pose the treatment of anaemia associated with ESA. A review was also carried out on the main Spanish, European and American consensus guidelines regarding the management of anaemia related to the diseases outlined in this article. It was found that there are limitations of its use in elderly patients with advanced disease, mainly due to the lack of uniformity and consensus in the recommendations, and the absence of large-scale prospective trials to determine the effectiveness of ESA in this population. There seems to be consensus in the use in patients with advanced chronic kidney disease, individualised in patients with non-myeloid cancer on treatment without curative intent, and in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome, still responders to space transfusional support. In the remainder, it should be individualised, since the risk of mortality and cardioembolic morbidity is clearly increased. It should not be the solution to treat anaemia, in cases of urgency or short-term transfusional need, which are often present in these patients.",

METHODS: In this randomized controlled clinical trial, we randomly assigned patients on maintenance hemodialysis at our hospital to receive levocarnitine injections (n = 30) or no injection (n = 30) and monitored the patients during 12 months of treatment. In the treatment group, patients received an injection of levocarnitine 1,000 mg 3 times weekly after hemodialysis sessions. All patients received recombinant human erythropoietin as an erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA). Response to ESA therapy was determined by calculating the erythropoietin responsiveness index (ERI; ESA dose·kg-1·g-1· dL-1·week-1). RESULTS: (1) The target levels of hemoglobin and hematocrit were maintained during the study period in both the levocarnitine group and the control group. (2) The dose of ESAs required to maintain these levels decreased gradually in the levocarnitine group and was significantly lower at 6 and 12 months than at study initiation. Furthermore, the dose of ESAs was significantly lower than that in the control group at 12 months. (3) The ERI showed a significant decrease at 6 and 12 months in the levocarnitine group, with a significant difference between the 2 groups at 12 months. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that levocarnitine administration can reduce the dose of ESAs required in patients with renal anemia on hemodialysis and improve the response to ESA therapy."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Renal anemia is an important complication in non-dialysis chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients as well as in dialysis patients. Although recombinant human erythropoietin has dramatically improved prognosis and quality of life in these patients, there have been issues among non-dialysis CKD patients who exhibit hyporesponsiveness to erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA). The causes and definition of ESA hyporesponsiveness, as well as the incidence of renal and cardiovascular disease (CVD) events in such patients, are yet to be clarified. METHODS: This ongoing trial is a multicenter, prospective, observational study of non-dialysis CKD patients with renal anemia. The primary objective is to survey the current realities of the therapy with ESA in Japan and evaluate the correlation between hyporesponsiveness to darbepoetin alfa and CKD progression. The secondary objective is to investigate relationship between ESA hyporesponsiveness and CVD events based on the clinical situation in Japan, and to explore an ESA response index. RESULTS: The subjects consist of CKD patients with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) below 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 who present renal anemia. The target number of registered cases is 2000 patients, based on estimates of incidences of renal and CVD events from past studies. Renal function and CVD events will be observed for 96 weeks after the initiation of darbepoetin alfa administration. Definitions of ESA hyporesponsiveness will also be investigated. CONCLUSION: By clarifying markers and factors involved in ESA hyporesponsiveness and their relationships with renal and CVD events, this ongoing study aims to improve evidence-based therapies for renal anemia in non-dialysis CKD patients.",

Mean cortical thickness, surface area, and fractional anisotropy (FA) were compared across study groups, and were correlated with general IQ measures.ResultsUnivariate analysis found no significant effect of ESAs on cortical thickness (P=0.366), surface area (P=0.940), or FA (P=0.150); however, there was a greater increase in FA among ESA-treated girls. Group analysis found significant correlations between FA and Full-Scale IQ (P=0.044) and Verbal IQ (P=0.036), although there was no significant relationship between Full-Scale IQ and FA among just the preterm children.ConclusionESA treatment may have a preferential effect on white matter development in girls, although factors other than just whole-brain FA are involved in mediating cognitive outcome.",

There is still much of a debate about the use of HbA1c as a metabolic indicator in diabetic patients (DM) on haemodialysis (HD) and erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA) therapy because of the altered erythrocyte turn over in patients with chronic kidney disease and haemodialysis (CKD5D). In 102 CKD5 patients with and without diabetes mellitus, we examined the dose dependent variability in HbA1c and fructosamine levels under haemodialysis and treated with epoetin α (n=48) and a new generation agent with continuous stimulation of methoxy polyethylene glycol epoetin beta (C.E.R.A.; n=54). HbA1c levels were affected by therapy with ESA treatments. ESA dose was inversely correlated with HbA1c and an escalation of 10.000 IU per week induced an estimated decrease of HbA1c of 0.6 percent. In addition, the increase of reticulocyte number as a marker for erythropoiesis was significantly inversely correlated with the increase of ΔHbA1c. ESA treatments had no such effect on the alternative metabolic parameter fructosamine. When compared, both therapeutic agents had comparable success in attaining haemoglobin (Hb) target values. C.E.R.A. showed better correlation and was more effective over a longer dose interval. Our results show that HbA1c levels in patients should be carefully interpreted based on interfering factors. Nevertheless, HbA1c is currently the most consistent parameter for use ascertaining metabolic status of patients suffering from diabetes mellitus.",

      "abstract": "Purpose Most anemic patients with non-deleted 5q lower-risk myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are treated with erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs), with a response rate of approximately 50%. Second-line treatments, including hypomethylating agents (HMAs), lenalidomide (LEN), and investigational drugs, may be used after ESA failure in some countries, but their effect on disease progression and overall survival (OS) is unknown. Here, we analyzed outcome after ESA failure and the effect of second-line treatments. Patients and Methods We examined an international retrospective cohort of 1,698 patients with non-del(5q) lower-risk MDS treated with ESAs. Results Erythroid response to ESAs was 61.5%, and median response duration was 17 months. Of 1,147 patients experiencing ESA failure, 653 experienced primary failure and 494 experienced relapse after a response. Primary failure of ESAs was associated with a higher risk of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) progression, which did not translate into an OS difference. Of 450 patients (39%) who received second-line treatment, 194 received HMAs, 148 received LEN, and 108 received other treatments (MISC), whereas 697 received RBC transfusions only. Five-year AML cumulative incidence was 20.3%, 20.3%, and 11.3% for those receiving HMAs, LEN, and MISC, respectively ( P = .05). Five-year OS for patients receiving HMA, LEN, and MISC was 36.5%, 41.7%, and 51%, respectively ( P = .21). In a multivariable analysis adjusted for age, sex, revised International Prognostic Scoring System score, and progression at ESA failure, there was no significant OS difference among the three groups. Conclusion In this large, multicenter, retrospective cohort of patients with non-del(5q) lower-risk MDS treated with ESAs, none of the most commonly used second-line treatments (HMA and LEN) significantly improved OS. Early failure of ESAs was associated with a higher risk of AML progression.",

It is uncertain whether the adverse effects of ESA therapy are related to dose and are mitigated when a fixed low ESA dose is used. We conducted a multicenter, prospective randomized open-label, blinded-endpoint (PROBE) trial to evaluate fixed low versus high dose ESA therapy on patient outcomes. We intended to recruit 2104 hemodialysis patients >18 years with anemia or receiving ESA treated at dialysis clinics in Italy. The intervention was fixed low (4000 IU epoetin alfa equivalent weekly) or high (18,000 IU epoetin alfa equivalent weekly) dose ESA for 12 months. Primary outcomes were serum transferrin, ferritin, albumin, C-reactive protein and ESA dose. Secondary outcomes were the composite of death or cardiovascular event, all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, myocardial infarction, stroke, cardiovascular hospitalization, and quality of life. Study recruitment was terminated after inclusion of 656 participants with convergence of ESA dose between groups during follow up. Fixed low dose ESA had uncertain effects on serum ferritin (delta of delta (DD) 3.9 ng/ml, 95% CI -85.0 to 92.8), transferrin (9.2 mg/dl, -6.3 to 24.8), transferrin saturation (3.7%, -5.0 to 12.3), serum albumin (-0.03 g/dl, -0.2 to 0.1), or C-reactive protein (-0.6 mg/l, -3.3 to 2.1). In addition, fixed dose therapy had inconclusive effects on the composite endpoint of mortality and cardiovascular events (hazard ratio [HR] 0.95, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.37), death (0.98, 0.64 to 1.52), nonfatal myocardial infarction (0.52, 0.18 to 1.52), nonfatal stroke (no events), hospital admission for cardiovascular causes (0.93, 0.50 to 1.72) or health-related quality of life. A fixed low ESA dose in hemodialysis patients has uncertain effects on serum parameters, mortality, cardiovascular events, and quality of life. Hemoglobin targets may be so entrenched in nephrology practice that a trial of ESA dose is no longer possible.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Exogenous replacement of erythropoietin (EPO) by recombinant human EPO has been considered a standard of care for the treatment of anemia in patients with chronic kidney disease for more than 20 years. Genetically engineered biologic proteins derived from human, animal, or microorganism sources are a major area of growth in modern medical care, accounting for one-third of new drug approvals in the past decade. Despite benefit to patients, the use of biologics comes at a significant cost, representing one of the fastest growing segments of strained healthcare budgets around the world. SUMMARY: Biosimilars, or biologic drugs that are designed to be highly similar to approved reference biologic drugs, have been available in Europe for more than 10 years with no unusual or unexpected effects compared to their reference biologics whose patents have expired. Given the success of the biosimilar approval pathway pioneered in Europe, it has served as a global reference for other regulatory authorities to establish and implement biosimilar licensure frameworks, including the United States (US), the largest pharmaceutical market in the world. Given 10 of the top 25 drugs sold in 2014 were biologics, and considering the rising costs of healthcare, biosimilars have the potential to become a significant part of the US market. Key Messages: For the nephrology community, the recent patent expiries for epoetin alfa (Epogen®, Amgen and Procrit®, Johnson &amp; Johnson) have created the opportunity to develop biosimilar EPOs. And while no biosimilar in this therapeutic class is approved in the US, there are proposed biosimilars in development.",

      "abstract": "The FDA first licensed erythropoiesis stimulating agents (ESA) for use in patients with ESRD in 1989. Hemoglobin targets for treatment with ESAs were established at the outset on the basis of descriptive pre-ESA literature and Phase I-III data in patients with ESRD. Postrelease literature in ESA-treated patients accumulating over time initially supported improvement in indices of both cardiovascular and other organ function as well as quality of life with therapy. Recommended treatment targets for hemoglobin would evolve further in the United States from four iterations of evidence- and opinion-based practice guidelines appearing between 1997 and 2007. Several randomized, controlled trials published from 1998 to 2009 examined normalization and near-normalization of hemoglobin in patients with both ESRD and CKD; they raised fundamental questions as to the safety of robust correction of anemia. These findings, taken together with subsequent actions of the FDA in ESA labeling and CMS's quality expectations for hemoglobin in payment for dialysis treatments, would result in a comprehensive reassessment of the hemoglobin targets in ESA therapy. A marked decrease in both national ESA utilization and hemoglobin attainment has ensued as a result. This discussion addresses the history of the striking changes in enthusiasm for hemoglobin-targeted anemia therapy from 1989 to the present, and similarly examines the evolution of ferritin-targeted iron administration, which has followed different-and markedly slower-historical development.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Erythropoiesis stimulating agents (ESAs) were proposed to enhance survival of renal tissues through direct effects via activation of EPO receptors on renal cells resulting in reduced cell apoptosis, or indirect effects via increased oxygen delivery due to increased numbers of Hb containing red blood cells. Thus through several mechanisms there may be benefit of ESA administration on kidney disease progression and kidney function in renal patients. However conflicting ESA reno-protection outcomes have been reported in both pre-clinical animal studies and human clinical trials. To better understand the potential beneficial effects of ESAs on renal-patients, meta-analyses of clinical trials is needed. METHODS: Literature searches and manual searches of references lists from published studies were performed. Controlled trials that included ESA treatment on renal patients with relevant renal endpoints were selected. RESULTS: Thirty two ESA controlled trials in 3 categories of intervention were identified. These included 7 trials with patients who had a high likelihood of AKI, 7 trials with kidney transplant patients and 18 anemia correction trials with chronic kidney disease (predialysis) patients. There was a trend toward improvement in renal outcomes in the ESA treated arm of AKI and transplant trials, but none reached statistical significance. In 12 of the anemia correction trials, meta-analyses showed no difference in renal outcomes with the anemia correction but both arms received some ESA treatment making it difficult to assess effects of ESA treatment alone. However, in 6 trials the low Hb arm received no ESAs and meta-analysis also showed no difference in renal outcomes, consistent with no benefit of ESA/ Hb increase. CONCLUSIONS: Most ESA trials were small with modest event rates. While trends tended to favor the ESA treatment arm, these meta-analyses showed no reduction of incidence of AKI, no reduction in DGF or improvement in 1-year graft survival after renal transplantation and no significant delay in progression of CKD. These results do not support significant clinical reno-protection by ESAs.",

METHODS: Results of ESA therapy were analyzed in 163 MF patients with severe anemia, most of whom had inadequate erythropoietin (EPO) levels (<125 U/L) at treatment start. RESULTS: According to the revised criteria of the International Working Group for Myelofibrosis Treatment and Research, anemia response was achieved in 86 patients (53%). Median response duration was 19.3 months. In multivariate analysis, baseline factors associated with a higher response rate were female sex (P=.007), leukocyte count ≥10×109 /L (P=.033), and serum ferritin <200 ng/mL (P=.002). Patients with 2 or 3 of the above features had a significantly higher response rate than the remainder (73% vs 28%, respectively; P<.001). Over the 373 patient-years of follow-up on ESA treatment, nine patients developed thrombotic complications (six arterial, three venous), accounting for 2.41 events per 100 patient-years. Survival time from ESA start was longer in anemia responders than in non-responders (P=.011). CONCLUSION: Besides the already established predictive value of EPO levels, these data can help to identify which MF patients are more likely to benefit from ESA treatment.",

METHODS: We enrolled 242 patients with chronic kidney disease who had received continued medical treatments and initiated maintenance hemodialysis from 1 September 2000 to 31 December 2014 at Toujinkai Hospital. Patients with a previous history of blood transfusion or any cardiovascular events or interventions were excluded. The coronary events were followed for 1 year after initiation of hemodialysis. RESULTS: Coronary events occurred in 51 of 242 patients: 10 patients had acute coronary syndrome [9 with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), 1 without intervention], and 41 had elective coronary revascularization (38 PCI and 3 coronary artery bypass graft). ESA was administered in 118 of 242 patients (48.8%). In stepwise logistic analysis, coronary events were positively associated with nonuse of ESA at the predialysis stage (odds ratio 2.66, p = 0.005) and diabetes mellitus (odds ratio 5.33, p < 0.001). When dividing the patients into 4 subgroups by blood hemoglobin (Hb) level (8.5 g/dl) and the use/nonuse of ESA, coronary event-free survival rates were higher (p = 0.005) in those with Hb ≥8.5 g/dl, ESA+ (86.6%, n = 82) and tended to be higher (p = 0.055) in those with Hb <8.5 g/dl, ESA+ (86.1%, n = 36) than in patients with Hb <8.5 g/dl, ESA- (68.6%, n = 86) in a Kaplan-Meier analysis. CONCLUSIONS: The use of ESA to correct anemia at the predialysis stage may inhibit early-phase coronary events after hemodialysis initiation."

      "abstract": "Anemia in chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a risk factor for cardiovascular diseases and is treated by long-acting erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs). Although the results of previous studies have shown that hemoglobin levels could not be maintained at the initiation of dialysis in CKD patients treated with recombinant human erythropoietin, it remains undetermined whether long-acting ESAs are effective in preventing the progression of anemia at the initiation of dialysis. In the present study, hemoglobin levels in 40 CKD patients treated with darbepoetin alfa (DA) and 15 CKD patients treated with a continuous erythropoietin receptor activator (CERA) were retrospectively compared during the 6 months period before the initiation of dialysis. Results showed that DA and CERA both maintained hemoglobin levels at around 10 g/dL from 6 months to 1 month before dialysis. However, hemoglobin levels at the initiation of dialysis significantly decreased to 9.1 ± 1.2 g/dL in the DA group and to 9.0 ± 1.0 g/dL in the CERA group. Although the total doses of ESAs used during the 6-month period were similar between the two groups, DA-treated CKD patients received subcutaneous injections more frequently than did patients treated with CERA. These results suggest that CKD patients require more intense ESA therapy to prevent a decline in hemoglobin levels at the initiation of dialysis, including those treated with long-acting ESAs. The results also raise the possibility that CERA is more useful than DA for reducing the number of injections during the pre-dialysis period.",

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to describe the usage and clinical impact of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) in 1696 patients enrolled between 2008 and 2014. METHODS: The effects of ESAs on outcomes were assessed using proportional hazards models weighting observations by propensity to receive ESA treatment within a subset of anaemic patients with or without a regular transfusion need. RESULTS: ESA treatment (median duration of 27.5 months, range 0-77 months) was administered to 773 patients (45.6%). Outcomes were assessed in 897 patients (484 ESA treated and 413 untreated). ESA treatment was associated with a nonsignificant survival benefit (HR 0.82, 95% CI: 0.65-1.04, P = 0.09); this benefit was larger amongst patients without prior transfusions (P = 0.07). Amongst 539 patients for whom response to ESA treatment could be defined, median time to first post-ESA treatment transfusion was 6.1 months (IQR: 4.3-15.9 months) in those transfused before ESA treatment compared to 23.3 months (IQR: 7.0-47.8 months) in patients without prior transfusions (HR 2.4, 95% CI: 1.7-3.3, P < 0.0001). Responding patients had a better prognosis in terms of a lower risk of death (HR 0.65, 95% CI: 0.45-0.893, P = 0.018), whereas there was no significant effect on the risk of progression to acute myeloid leukaemia (HR 0.71, 95% CI: 0.39-1.29, P = 0.27). CONCLUSION: Appropriate use of ESAs can significantly delay the onset of a regular transfusion need in patients with lower-risk MDS.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Vitamin B6 deficiency is common in hemodialysis patients and may contribute to anemia and abnormal bone metabolism in this population. DESIGN: 6-month, open-label, randomized controlled parallel-group study in hemodialysis centers. SUBJECTS: Fifty-six maintenance hemodialysis patients with relatively high resistance to erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESA). INTERVENTION: Intravenous vitamin B6 (60 mg of intravenous pyridoxal 5'-phosphate after each thrice-weekly hemodialysis session). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The primary and secondary outcomes were changes over time in ESA resistance index and bone turnover markers, respectively. RESULTS: The prevalence of vitamin B6 deficiency was 40% overall. Compared with the control group, the B6 group showed an upward change in ESA resistance index over time (Pinteraction = .038). At week 13 (a priori-defined time point), pyridoxal 5'-phosphate administration was associated with higher ESA resistance index by 0.97 (95% confidence interval, 0.02-1.92) ×10-2 μg ⋅darbepoetin-α/kg per g/dL⋅hemoglobin after baseline adjustment, which was not modified by baseline vitamin B6 status. There was a trend toward increase in serum erythropoietin concentrations in the B6 group after adjustment for baseline values, hemoglobin, and weekly ESA dose (Pinteraction = .06). The downward changes of bone-specific alkaline phosphatase and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase 5b in the B6 group relative to the control group were pronounced in patients without vitamin B6 deficiency (Pinteraction < .001 and .017, respectively), despite nonsignificant between-group difference in 1-84 parathyroid hormone. CONCLUSIONS: Thrice-weekly intravenous vitamin B6 (60 mg pyridoxal 5'-phosphate hydrate) worsens the response to ESA and may blunt the response of bone to parathyroid hormone in hemodialysis patients.",
