      "abstract": "Low-fat plant-based diets cause weight loss in clinical trials. However, many foods are highly processed, raising the question as to their effect on body weight. This secondary analysis assessed the associations between changes in processed food intake and weight loss in 244 overweight adults randomly assigned to a vegan (n = 122) or control group (n = 122) for 16 weeks. Three-day dietary records were analyzed using the NOVA system, which categorizes foods from 1 to 4, based on degree of processing. A repeated measure ANOVA, Pearson correlations, and a multivariate regression model were used for statistical analysis. The consumption of animal foods in categories 1-4 decreased in the vegan group, compared with the control group. Body weight decreased in the vegan group (treatment effect - 5.9 kg [95% CI -6.7 to -5.0]; Gxt, p < 0.001). Changes in consumption of animal foods in categories 1-4 were positively associated with changes in body weight: r = + 0.34; p < 0.001 for category 1; r = + 0.18; p = 0.008 for category 2; r = + 0.17; p = 0.01 for category 3; and r = + 0.22; p = 0.001 for category 4. In no NOVA category was the consumption of plant-based processed foods positively and significantly associated with weight gain. The top three independent predictors of weight loss were reduced intakes of processed, unprocessed or minimally processed, and ultra-processed animal foods. These findings suggest that replacing animal products with plant-based foods may be an effective weight-loss strategy, even when processed plant-based foods are included."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Plant-based foods have reduced protein digestibility and frequently display unbalanced amino acid profiles. Plant-based foods are therefore considered inferior to animal-based foods in their anabolic potential. No study has assessed the anabolic potential of a vegan diet that provides a large variety of plant-based protein sources in older adults. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the effect of a 10-d vegan diet on daily mixed muscle protein synthesis (MPS) rates in comparison with an isocaloric, isonitrogenous, omnivorous diet in community-dwelling older adults. METHODS: This cross-over trial assessed 34 community-dwelling older adults (72 ± 4 y, 18 males, 16 females), who were randomly assigned to consume a 10-d controlled vegan diet, followed by a controlled omnivorous diet (60% animal protein), or vice versa. One day before the study diets, participants consumed 400 mL deuterated water, followed by daily doses of 50 mL. Subsequent plasma and muscle samples were collected during the intervention period. Physical activity levels were assessed using accelerometry. Secondary outcomes were cardiometabolic risk factors and appetite. Statistical analyses were performed using linear mixed models, and results are presented as means ± standard errors. RESULTS: Integrated MPS rates did not differ between the vegan (1.23 ± 0.04%/d) and omnivorous (1.29 ± 0.04%/d) diets (P = 0.2542). Plasma low-density lipoprotein (Δ0.23 ± 0.03, P < 0.0001), high-density lipoprotein (Δ0.03 ± 0.14, P = 0.0387), and total cholesterol (Δ0.25 ± 0.04, P < 0.0001) levels were significantly lower succeeding the vegan diet than the omnivorous diet. There were no significant differences between the omnivorous and the vegan diet in fasting plasma triglyceride, glucose and insulin levels, homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance, and systolic and diastolic blood pressure (P > 0.05). Physical activity levels were high (12,460 ± 4512 steps/d). CONCLUSIONS: A well-balanced vegan diet providing a variety of plant-based protein sources does not compromise daily MPS rates when compared with an isocaloric, isonitrogenous omnivorous diet in physically active, older adults. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT05624333 (https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05624333).",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: An increasing number of people, including recreational trained individuals, choose not to consume animal products and follow a vegan diet. Young women in particular are switching to a vegan diet. Studies have shown no difference in performance and muscle adaptations between a balanced vegan and an omnivorous diet. However, there are hardly any studies on the transition phase from an omnivorous to a vegan diet and the potential difficulties. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the influence of a vegan dietary transition and its effects on body composition, physical performance, and menstrual cycle in young, recreationally trained women. METHODS: Ten young healthy women (23.8 ± 2.0 years, 173.0 ± 5.8 cm) were recruited to participate in this 12-week controlled study (4-week omnivorous phase, 8-week vegan intervention). At the beginning and before the vegan phase, all participants were informed about a balanced diet for fitness-oriented individuals and a vegan lifestyle. They were supervised by a sports dietitian for the entire 12 weeks. Explicit instructions and regular checks on macronutrient distribution were not carried out but had to be implemented independently. The diet was documented using FDDB Extender. The training habits were not explicitly specified, but should not be changed over the entire period. At baseline (T0) and 4-week intervals (T1, T2, T3), body composition (body weight, skeletal muscle mass, fat mass) and performance (squat, countermovement jump) were tested. In addition, the menstrual cycle was examined every two days using saliva samples and a cycle diary. RESULTS: Between treatments, there was a significant decrease in absolute (T0: 94.44 ± 20.37 kcal; T3: 71.67 ± 27.64 kcal; p < 0.001) and in relative protein intake (T0: 1.39 ± 0.28 g/kg BW; T3: 1.06 ± 0.37 g/kg BW; p < 0.05). In carbohydrate consumption, a significant increase was observed (T0: 240.11 ± 53.15 kcal; T3: 266.89 ± 49.01 kcal; p < 0.001). During the vegan phase, a significant decrease in body weight (T0: 68.19 ± 6.47 kg, T3: 67.73 ± 6.07 kg; p < 0.001) and skeletal muscle mass (T0: 29.40 ± 2.23 kg; T3: 28.74 ± 2.55 kg; p < 0.001) was observed. No changes were noted in squat performance. The countermovement jump showed a significant decrease in the vegan phase (T0: 26.08 ± 3.44 cm; T3: 23,62 ± 1,00 p < 0.05), but also a significant time effect starting in the omnivorous phase (p < 0.001). No effects were found on hormone concentrations of individual menstrual cycles. CONCLUSION: The dietary change resulted in a shift in overall macronutrient distribution. Relative protein intake was significantly lower during the vegan phase than during the omnivore phase. This was also observed in a slight decrease in skeletal muscle mass. No clear effects on performance and menstrual cycle were observed during the first eight weeks. The results suggest that despite the knowledge of a balanced diet and in particular the recommendations for a vegan diet, the implementation of a vegan diet in everyday life could be associated with a number of difficulties for recreationally trained women. However, it should be noted that the vegan phase was only conducted for eight weeks and no statement can be made about the long-term effects or on well-trained female athletes.",

MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this randomized cross-over trial, 62 overweight adults were assigned to a Mediterranean or a low-fat vegan diet for 16-week periods in random order, separated by a 4-week washout. Body weight was the primary outcome. Three-day diet records were analyzed using the Nutrition Data System for Research software and dietary AGEs were estimated, using an established database. Statistical approaches appropriate for crossover trials were implemented. RESULTS: Dietary AGEs decreased by 73%, that is, by 9,413 kilounits AGE/day (95% -10,869 to -7,957); p < 0.001, compared with no change on the Mediterranean diet (treatment effect -10,303 kilounits AGE/day [95% CI -13,090 to -7,516]; p < 0.001). The participants lost 6.0 kg on average on the vegan diet, compared with no change on the Mediterranean diet (treatment effect -6.0 kg [95% CI -7.5 to -4.5]; p < 0.001). Changes in dietary AGEs correlated with changes in body weight (r = +0.47; p < 0.001) and remained significant after adjustment for total energy intake (r = +0.39; p = 0.003). CONCLUSION: Dietary AGEs did not change on the Mediterranean diet but decreased on a low-fat vegan diet, and this decrease was associated with changes in body weight, independent of energy intake.

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Recently, there has been a notable increase in interest in various forms of vegetarianism, which may be due to the growing prevalence of health issues, such as Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM). Adhering to a vegan diet may have positive health outcomes. As a result, we conducted a review article to gather data from previous research studies on the effects of a vegan diet on different aspects of managing patients with T2DM. METHODS: We searched the PubMed website for research studies on how a vegan diet affects the outcomes of patients with T2DM. The research studies were categorized according to the type of data collected, such as prevalence, incidence, body weight, insulin resistance, glycemic control, and lipid profile. RESULTS: It was found that following a vegetarian diet can significantly reduce the risk of mortality from heart disease. Additionally, studies have demonstrated that a vegetarian diet is linked to several improvements in T2DM. However, long-term weight loss plans and managing T2DM is a comprehensive intervention that includes caloric restriction, exercise, and behavioral modification. CONCLUSION: Incorporating a vegan diet can be a valuable factor to consider in managing T2DM, as it can offer numerous benefits, such as increased insulin sensitivity, weight loss, and reduced blood sugar levels. It helps to reduce cholesterol levels, LDL, and triglyceride levels, which are all risk factors associated with T2DM. By reducing these risk factors, the vegan diet can improve the overall health of T2DM patients.",

      "abstract": "Food consumption is one of the major causes of climate change, resource depletion, loss of biodiversity, and other kinds of environmental impact by modern households. According to evidence, a global change in dietary habits could be the single most effective and rapid intervention to reduce anthropic pressure on the planet, especially with respect to climate change. Our study applied Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) to investigate the total environmental impact of two plant-based diets: the Mediterranean and the Vegan diets, according to relevant Italian nutritional recommendations. The two diets share the same macronutrient rates and cover all the nutritional recommendations. Calculations were made on the basis of a theoretical one-week 2000 kcal/day diet. According to our calculations, the Vegan diet showed about 44% less total environmental impact when compared to the Mediterranean diet, despite the fact that the content of animal products of the latter was low (with 10.6% of the total diet calories). This result clearly supports the concept that meat and dairy consumption plays a critical role, above all, in terms of damage to human health and ecosystems. Our study supports the thesis that even a minimal-to-moderate content of animal foods has a consistent impact on the environmental footprint of a diet, and their reduction can elicit significant ecological benefits.",

The actions of these adipokines extend beyond adipocytes and include systemic modulation of lipid and glucose metabolism, nutrient flux, and the immune response to changes in nutrition. Herein, we hypothesized that short-term intervention with a vegan diet might result in an improvement of plasma concentrations of adiponectin and leptin and the leptin/adiponectin ratio. We investigated the response of plasma adiponectin and leptin to a 4-week intervention with a vegan or meat-rich diet and its associations with sex, BMI and nutritional intake. Fifty-three healthy, omnivore participants (62% female, average age 31 years and BMI 23.1 kg/m2) were randomly assigned to a vegan or meat-rich diet for 4 weeks. Plasma adiponectin and leptin were lower in men compared to women both at the beginning and end of the trial. The concentration of adiponectin in women was significantly higher both when comparing their transition from omnivorous to vegan diet (p = 0.023) and also for vegan versus meat-rich diet at the end of the trial (p = 0.001), whereas plasma leptin did not vary significantly. No changes in adiponectin were identified in men, yet an increase in leptin occurred upon their transition from an omnivorous to a meat-rich diet (p = 0.019). Examination of plasma adiponectin/leptin ratio, a proposed marker of cardiovascular risk, did not differ after 4-weeks of dietary intervention. Our study revealed that adiponectin and leptin concentrations are sensitive to short-term dietary intervention in a sex-dependent manner. This dietary modification of leptin and adiponectin not only occurs quickly as demonstrated in our study, but it remains such as published in studies with individuals who are established (long-term) vegetarians compared to omnivorous.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Consuming different food groups and nutrients can have differential effects on body weight, body composition, and insulin sensitivity. OBJECTIVE: The aim was to identify how food group, nutrient intake, and diet quality change relative to usual-diet controls after 16 weeks on a low-fat vegan diet and what associations those changes have with changes in body weight, body composition, and measures of metabolic health. DESIGN: Secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial conducted between October 2016 and December 2018 in four replications. PARTICIPANTS/SETTING: Participants included in this analysis were 219 healthy, community-based adults in the Washington, DC, area, with a body mass index (BMI) between 28 and 40, who were randomly assigned to either follow a low-fat vegan diet or make no diet changes. INTERVENTION: A low-fat, vegan diet deriving approximately 10% of energy from fat, with weekly classes including dietary instruction, group discussion, and education on the health effects of plant-based nutrition. Control group participants continued their usual diets. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Changes in food group intake, macronutrient and micronutrient intake, and dietary quality as measured by Alternate Healthy Eating Index-2010 (AHEI-2010), analyzed from 3-day diet records, and associations with changes in body weight, body composition, and insulin sensitivity were assessed. STATISTICAL ANALYSES PERFORMED: A repeated-measure analysis of variance model that included the factors group, subject, and time was used to test the between-group differences throughout the 16-week study. Interaction between group and time was calculated for each variable. Within each diet group, paired comparison t tests were calculated to identify significant changes from baseline to 16 weeks. Spearman correlations were calculated for the relationship between changes in food group intake, nutrient intake, AHEI-2010 score, and changes in body weight, body composition, and insulin sensitivity. The relative contribution of food groups and nutrients to weight loss was evaluated using linear regression. RESULTS: Fruit, vegetable, legume, meat alternative, and whole grain intake significantly increased in the vegan group. Intake of meat, fish, and poultry; dairy products; eggs; nuts and seeds; and added fats decreased. Decreased weight was most associated with increased intake of legumes (r = -0.38; P < 0.0001) and decreased intake of total meat, fish, and poultry (r = +0.43; P < 0.0001). Those consuming a low-fat vegan diet also increased their intake of carbohydrates, fiber, and several micronutrients and decreased fat intake. Reduced fat intake was associated with reduced body weight (r = +0.15; P = 0.02) and, after adjustment for changes in BMI and energy intake, with reduced fat mass (r = +0.14; P = 0.04). The intervention group's AHEI-2010 increased by 6.0 points on average, in contrast to no significant change in the control group (treatment effect, +7.2 [95% CI +3.7 to +10.7]; P < 0.001). Increase in AHEI-2010 correlated with reduction in body weight (r = 0.14; P = 0.04), fat mass (r = -0.14; P = 0.03), and insulin resistance as measured by the Homeostasis Model Assessment (HOMA-IR; r = -0.17; P = 0.02), after adjustment for changes in energy intake. CONCLUSIONS: When compared with participants' usual diets, intake of plant foods increased, and consumption of animal foods, nuts and seeds, and added fats decreased on a low-fat vegan diet. Increased legume intake was the best single food group predictor of weight loss. Diet quality as measured by AHEI-2010 improved on the low-fat vegan diet, which was associated with improvements in weight and metabolic outcomes. These data suggest that increasing low-fat plant foods and minimizing high-fat and animal foods is associated with decreased body weight and fat loss, and that a low-fat vegan diet can improve measures of diet quality and metabolic health.",

The whole study group performed the maximum number of repetitions with a load of 70% one repetition-maximum (1RM) and a modified Fight Gone Bad (FGBMod) test before and after a dietary intervention (the group was divided to follow a VegD or a traditional mixed diet (MixD)) in a randomised and parallel design. Pre-exercise resting blood samples were also analysed. There was a significant improvement in the number of repetitions performed at a load corresponding to 70% of 1RM in the classic squat in the MixD group (p < 0.001), and in the classic deadlift in the VegD group (p = 0.014). Furthermore, there was a significant improvement in the results of the FGBMod performance test after a MixD. Moreover, an improvement in some exercises in the modified FGBMod test (Wall Ball after the VegD and the MixD, and rowing after the MixD) was also observed. However, differences between the MixD and the VegD groups were not clinically relevant. In conclusion, the short-term study conducted here indicated that a VegD in HIFT training positively affects strength endurance in the classic deadlift but is unlikely to be more beneficial in improving performance than a MixD.",

Due to their numerous functions, the gut microbiota can be considered a virtual organ of the body, playing a pivotal role in health maintenance. Dietary habits contribute to gut microbiota composition, and evidence from observational and intervention studies suggest that vegan diets may promote health, potentially through affecting the diverse ecosystem of beneficial bacteria in the gut. A systematic literature search was conducted on PubMed and Scopus to identify studies investigating the microbiota composition in vegans. Vegans are defined as people excluding food products that are derived from animals from their diet. Nine observational studies were identified. The main outcome of the systematic review was an increase in Bacteroidetes on the phylum level and a higher abundance of Prevotella on the genus level. In conclusion, the present systematic literature review highlighted some benefits of a vegan diet but also demonstrated the complexity of evaluating results from gut microbiota research. The available evidence only consisted of cross-sectional studies, therefore suggesting the need for well-designed randomised controlled trials. Furthermore, the quality assessment of the studies included in the review suggested a lack of standardised and validated methods for participant selection as well as for faecal sampling and faecal analysis.",

The aim of this review is to assess the relationship between vegan diets and the risk for type 2 diabetes (T2D) along with its effect on glycemic control and diabetes-related complications. In accordance with PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines, Pubmed and Cochrane library databases were systematically searched for all relevant studies. Seven observational and eight randomized controlled (RCTs) studies were included. The methodological quality of studies was assessed using the National Institutes of Health quality assessment tool for observational cohort and cross-sectional studies and the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool for RCTs. We found that a vegan diet is associated with lower T2D prevalence or incidence and in T2D patients decreases high glucose values and improves glucose homeostasis, as reported from the majority of included studies. This approach seems to be comparable to other recommended healthful eating models, but as it may have potential adverse effects associated with the long-term exclusion of some nutrients, appropriate nutritional planning and surveillance are recommended, particularly in specific groups of diabetic patients such as frail elderly, adolescents, and pregnant or breastfeeding women.",

The aim of this research is to review the scientific evidence on the effect of following a vegetarian or vegan diet on fibromyalgia patients. A systematic review included the original articles that answered the research question. These articles were in 2021 in the PubMed, Web of Science and Scopus databases. The research used the PRISMA (preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses) guidelines. No time restriction was applied, and grey literature was not included. The evaluation of the methodological quality of the articles was carried out using the following different scales: STROBE (strengthening the reporting of observational studies in epidemiology), PEDro (Physiotherapy Evidence Database), and MMAT (Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool) scales. A total of 88 studies were analyzed, of which 6 investigations were included in this systematic review (n = 4 clinical trials and n = 2 cohort studies). These investigations show significant improvements in biochemical parameters, quality of life, quality of sleep, pain at rest and general health status when following mainly plant-based dietary patterns. In conclusion, these findings are promising but interpretation of the findings is limited due to the methodological quality of the studies. Well-designed clinical trials are needed to consolidate these dietary recommendations in FM patients.",

      "abstract": "Plant-based diets (PBDs) are increasingly consumed by the Italian population and around the world. In particular, among PBDs, the vegan diet is a food pattern characterized by the exclusion of all animal-origin foods. What drives people to adopt this model are mainly ethical, health and environmental reasons. A vegan diet, if well-balanced and varied, can help in achieving and maintaining an optimal state of health. However, this nutritional approach, if not well-balanced, can cause deficiencies in proteins, ω-3 fatty acids, iron, vitamin D and calcium, zinc, iodine and, above all, vitamin B12. Oral food supplements especially fortified foods are recommended in these cases to restore the nutritional deficiencies. A vegan diet generally reduces the risk of developing chronic non-communicable degenerative diseases, such as metabolic syndrome (MetS) and, in addition, requires fewer natural resources for food production than an omnivorous diet. The aim of this review is to analyze the possible impact of the vegan diet on MetS onset and its treatment.",

However, no data are available on potential benefit of vegan diets in NAFLD and/or nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). We aimed to study prospectively the effect of a vegan diet, excluding all animal products on liver chemistry in a group of consecutive NAFLD patients. METHODS: This was a prospective, pilot study run on 40 consecutive patients affected by NAFLD. Eight subjects refused to join the study for poor diet palatability, leaving 32 patients (19 males, mean age 50 years), with abnormal measures of liver function who agreed to adhere to a vegan diet for six months. The caloric intake was tailored by the dietitian to obtain a weight loss ≥5% of body weight in overweight patients [body-mass index (BMI) ≥25] and ranged from 1500 Kcal to 1800 Kcal. Patients were contacted monthly by phone to reinforce diet and lifestyle advice and were seen at the gastrointestinal clinic when doubtful about diet advice. RESULTS: At six-month follow-up, 6 subjects did not attend the clinic leaving only 26 patients for data analysis. Initial anthropometric values were mean weight 78 kg (range 52-95), mean body mass index (BMI) 26.8 Kg/m2 (range 20.3-31.2). Liver function tests showed mean ALT value 99 U/L (SD±45), mean AST value 54 U/L (SD±44), mean GGT value 160 U/L (SD±122), pre-treatment. After six months mean body weight was 73 Kg (range 52-87), mean BMI was 25.2 Kg/m2 (range 20.3-29.7) (p<0.001 compared to baseline for both parameters). Liver enzymes improved to a mean of ALT value 36 U/L (SD±21), AST value 27 U/L (SD±10) and GGT value 55 U/L (SD±57), respectively (p<0.001 compared to baseline for all enzymes). Normalization of liver function tests as a whole was observed in 20/26 patients (76.9%). A loss of ≥ 5% of body weight was observed in 12 patients (46.1%), but it did not correlate with the normalization of liver function tests (p=0.5). CONCLUSIONS: Our data provide preliminary evidence of improved liver enzymes in NAFLD patients with a strict vegan diet and although our study sample is limited, decreased body weight did not seem critical to the outcome.",

Body weight, plasma lipids, blood pressure, and body composition (dual X-ray absorptiometry) were measured. Secondary measures included insulin resistance (Homeostasis Model Assessment, HOMA-IR), oral glucose insulin sensitivity (OGIS), and predicted insulin sensitivity (PREDIM) indices. Thereafter, participants were asked to return to their baseline diets for 4 weeks, after which they began the opposite diet for 16 weeks. The same parameters were measured before and after this 2nd 16-week period.Results: Overall net weight changes were 0.0 (Mediterranean) and -6.0 kg (vegan), (treatment effect -6.0 kg [95% CI -7.5 to -4.5]; p < 0.001). HOMA-IR decreased and OGIS increased on the vegan diet with no significant change on the Mediterranean diet (treatment effect -0.7 [95% CI, -1.8 to +0.4]; p = 0.21; and +35.8 mL/min/m2 [95% CI, +13.2 to +58.3]; p = 0.003, respectively). PREDIM did not change significantly in either group. Among participants with no medication changes, total and LDL-cholesterol decreased 18.7 mg/dL (0.5 mmol/L) and 15.3 mg/dL (0.4 mmol/L), respectively, on the vegan diet, compared with no significant change on the Mediterranean diet (treatment effect -15.6 [-24.6 to -6.6]; p = 0.001 and -14.8 [-23.5 to -6.2]; p = 0.001, respectively); systolic and diastolic blood pressure decreased 9.3 and 7.3 mmHg on the Mediterranean diet, compared with 3.4 and 4.1 mmHg on the vegan diet (treatment effect +5.9 [95% CI +1.0 to +10.9]; p = 0.02; and +1.8 [95% CI -4.6 to +8.1]; p = 0.58, respectively).Conclusions: A low-fat vegan diet improved body weight, lipid concentrations, and insulin sensitivity, both from baseline and compared with a Mediterranean diet.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Due to the challenges associated with accurate monitoring of dietary intake in humans, nutritional metabolomics (including food intake biomarkers) analysis as a complementary tool to traditional dietary assessment methods has been explored. Food intake biomarker assessment using postprandial dried blood spot (DBS) collection can be a convenient and accurate means of monitoring dietary intake vs 24-hour urine collection. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to use nutritional metabolomics analysis to differentiate a high-fat, high-protein meat (HFPM) diet from a high-carbohydrate vegan (HCV) diet in postprandial DBS and 24-hour urine. DESIGN: This was a randomized controlled crossover feeding trial. PARTICIPANTS/SETTING: Participants were healthy young adult volunteers (n = 8) in California. The study was completed in August 2019. INTERVENTION: The standardized isocaloric diet interventions included an HFPM and an HCV diet. Participants attended 2 intervention days, separated by a 2-week washout. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: During each intervention day, a finger-prick blood sample was collected in the fasting state, 3 hours post breakfast, and 3 hours post lunch. Participants also collected their urine for 24 hours. DBS and urine samples were analyzed by ultra-performance liquid chromatography mass spectrometry to identify potential food intake biomarkers. STATISTICAL ANALYSES PERFORMED: Principal component analysis for discriminatory analysis and univariate analysis using paired t tests were performed. RESULTS: Principal component analysis found no discrimination of baseline DBS samples. In both the postprandial DBS and 24-hour urine, post-HFPM consumption had higher (P < 0.05) levels of acylcarnitines, creatine, and cis-trans hydroxyproline, and the HCV diet was associated with elevated sorbitol (P < 0.05). The HFPM diet had higher concentrations of triacylglycerols with fewer than 54 total carbons in DBS, and 24-hour urine had higher nucleoside mono- and di-phosphates (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Nutritional metabolomics profiles of postprandial DBS and 24-hour urine collections were capable of differentiating the HFPM and HCV diets. The potential use of postprandial DBS-based metabolomic analysis deserves further investigation for dietary intake monitoring.",

There is an urgent need for dietary interventions to address these conditions. OBJECTIVE: To measure the effects of a low-fat vegan diet on body weight, insulin resistance, postprandial metabolism, and intramyocellular and hepatocellular lipid levels in overweight adults. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This 16-week randomized clinical trial was conducted between January 2017 and February 2019 in Washington, DC. Of 3115 people who responded to flyers in medical offices and newspaper and radio advertisements, 244 met the participation criteria (age 25 to 75 years; body mass index of 28 to 40) after having been screened by telephone. INTERVENTIONS: Participants were randomized in a 1:1 ratio. The intervention group (n = 122) was asked to follow a low-fat vegan diet and the control group (n = 122) to make no diet changes for 16 weeks. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: At weeks 0 and 16, body weight was assessed using a calibrated scale. Body composition and visceral fat were measured by dual x-ray absorptiometry. Insulin resistance was assessed with the homeostasis model assessment index and the predicted insulin sensitivity index (PREDIM). Thermic effect of food was measured by indirect calorimetry over 3 hours after a standard liquid breakfast (720 kcal). In a subset of participants (n = 44), hepatocellular and intramyocellular lipids were quantified by proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Repeated measure analysis of variance was used for statistical analysis. RESULTS: Among the 244 participants in the study, 211 (87%) were female, 117 (48%) were White, and the mean (SD) age was 54.4 (11.6) years. Over the 16 weeks, body weight decreased in the intervention group by 5.9 kg (95% CI, 5.0-6.7 kg; P < .001). Thermic effect of food increased in the intervention group by 14.1% (95% CI, 6.5-20.4; P < .001). The homeostasis model assessment index decreased (-1.3; 95% CI, -2.2 to -0.3; P < .001) and PREDIM increased (0.9; 95% CI, 0.5-1.2; P < .001) in the intervention group. Hepatocellular lipid levels decreased in the intervention group by 34.4%, from a mean (SD) of 3.2% (2.9%) to 2.4% (2.2%) (P = .002), and intramyocellular lipid levels decreased by 10.4%, from a mean (SD) of 1.6 (1.1) to 1.5 (1.0) (P = .03). None of these variables changed significantly in the control group over the 16 weeks. The change in PREDIM correlated negatively with the change in body weight (r = -0.43; P < .001). Changes in hepatocellular and intramyocellular lipid levels correlated with changes in insulin resistance (both r = 0.51; P = .01). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: A low-fat plant-based dietary intervention reduces body weight by reducing energy intake and increasing postprandial metabolism. The changes are associated with reductions in hepatocellular and intramyocellular fat and increased insulin sensitivity. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02939638.",

We determined whether a non-animal-derived diet can support daily myofibrillar protein synthesis rates to the same extent as an omnivorous diet. Nineteen healthy older adults (aged 66 (sem 1) years; BMI 24 (sem 1) kg/m2; twelve males, seven females) participated in a randomised, parallel-group, controlled trial during which they consumed a 3-d isoenergetic high-protein (1·8 g/kg body mass per d) diet, where the protein was provided from predominantly (71 %) animal (OMNI; n 9; six males, three females) or exclusively vegan (VEG; n 10; six males, four females; mycoprotein providing 57 % of daily protein intake) sources. During the dietary control period, participants conducted a daily bout of unilateral resistance-type leg extension exercise. Before the dietary control period, participants ingested 400 ml of deuterated water, with 50-ml doses consumed daily thereafter. Saliva samples were collected throughout to determine body water 2H enrichments, and muscle samples were collected from rested and exercised muscle to determine daily myofibrillar protein synthesis rates. Deuterated water dosing resulted in body water 2H enrichments of approximately 0·78 (sem 0·03) %. Daily myofibrillar protein synthesis rates were 13 (sem 8) (P = 0·169) and 12 (sem 4) % (P = 0·016) greater in the exercised compared with rested leg (1·59 (sem 0·12) v. 1·77 (sem 0·12) and 1·76 (sem 0·14) v. 1·93 (sem 0·12) %/d) in OMNI and VEG groups, respectively. Daily myofibrillar protein synthesis rates did not differ between OMNI and VEG in either rested or exercised muscle (P > 0·05). Over the course of a 3-d intervention, omnivorous- or vegan-derived dietary protein sources can support equivalent rested and exercised daily myofibrillar protein synthesis rates in healthy older adults consuming a high-protein diet.",

The aim of this study was to test the effect of a low-fat vegan diet on gut microbiota and its association with weight, body composition, and insulin resistance in overweight men and women. We enrolled 168 participants and randomly assigned them to a vegan (n = 84) or a control group (n = 84) for 16 weeks. Of these, 115 returned all gut microbiome samples. Gut microbiota composition was assessed using uBiome Explorer™ kits. Body composition was measured using dual energy X-ray absorptiometry. Insulin sensitivity was quantified with the predicted clamp-derived insulin sensitivity index from a standard meal test. Repeated measure ANOVA was used for statistical analysis. Body weight decreased in the vegan group (treatment effect -5.9 kg [95% CI, -7.0 to -4.9 kg]; p < 0.001), mainly due to a reduction in fat mass (-3.9 kg [95% CI, -4.6 to -3.1 kg]; p < 0.001) and in visceral fat (-240 cm3 [95% CI, -345 to -135 kg]; p < 0.001). PREDIcted M, insulin sensitivity index (PREDIM) increased in the vegan group (treatment effect +0.83 [95% CI, +0.48 to +1.2]; p < 0.001). The relative abundance of Faecalibacterium prausnitzii increased in the vegan group (+5.1% [95% CI, +2.4 to +7.9%]; p < 0.001) and correlated negatively with changes in weight (r = -0.24; p = 0.01), fat mass (r = -0.22; p = 0.02), and visceral fat (r = -0.20; p = 0.03). The relative abundance of Bacteroides fragilis decreased in both groups, but less in the vegan group, making the treatment effect positive (+18.9% [95% CI, +14.2 to +23.7%]; p < 0.001), which correlated negatively with changes in weight (r = -0.44; p < 0.001), fat mass (r = -0.43; p < 0.001), and visceral fat (r = -0.28; p = 0.003) and positively with PREDIM (r = 0.36; p < 0.001), so a smaller reduction in Bacteroides fragilis was associated with a greater loss of body weight, fat mass, visceral fat, and a greater increase in insulin sensitivity. A low-fat vegan diet induced significant changes in gut microbiota, which were related to changes in weight, body composition, and insulin sensitivity in overweight adults, suggesting a potential use in clinical practice.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Vegan diet (VD) has improved inflammatory activity in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in several small controlled trials. The underlying mechanism remains widely unclear. We investigated the effect of a VD in comparison to a meat-rich diet (MD) on markers of inflammation (which have been shown to be relevant in patients with RA) in healthy volunteers. METHODS: 53 healthy, omnivore subjects were randomized to a controlled VD (n = 26) or MD (n = 27) for 4 weeks following a pre-treatment phase of a one week controlled mixed diet. Primary parameters of interest were sialylation of immunoglobulins, percentage of regulatory T-cells and level of interleukin 10 (IL10). Usual care immune parameters used in patients with RA and amino acid serum levels as well as granulocytes and monocytes colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) serum levels were secondary parameters. RESULTS: In the VD group, total leukocyte, neutrophil, monocyte and platelet counts decreased and after four weeks they were significantly lower compared to the MD group (ANCOVA: leukocytes p = 0.003, neutrophils p = 0.001, monocytes p = 0.032, platelets p = 0.004). Leukocytes, neutrophils, monocytes, and platelets correlated with each other and likewise conform with serum levels of branched-chain amino acids, which were significantly lower in the VD compared to the MD group. The primary parameters did not differ between the groups and BMI remained stable in the two groups. CONCLUSION: Four weeks of a controlled VD affected the number of neutrophils, monocytes and platelets but not the number or function of lymphocytes. The relation with branched-chain amino acids and GM-CSF suggests a mode of action via the mTOR signaling pathway. REGISTERED AT: http://www.drks.de (German Clinical Trial register) at DRKS00011963.",

Little is known about the short-term effects of dietary change to plant-based nutrition on vitamin B12 metabolism. Systemic biomarkers of vitamin B12 status, namely, serum vitamin B12 and holotranscobalamin, may respond quickly to a reduced intake of vitamin B12. To test this hypothesis, 53 healthy omnivore subjects were randomized to a controlled unsupplemented vegan diet (VD, n = 26) or meat-rich diet (MD, n = 27) for 4 weeks. Vitamin B12 status was examined by measurement of serum vitamin B12, holotranscobalamin (holo-TC), methylmalonic acid (MMA) and total plasma homocysteine (tHcy). Holo-TC decreased significantly in the VD compared to the MD group after four weeks of intervention, whereas metabolites MMA and tHcy were unaffected. Body weight remained stable in both groups. VD intervention led to a significant reduction of cholesterol intake, and adequate profiles of nutrient and micronutrient status. Lower intake of vitamin B12 was observed in VD, which was mirrored by a lower concentration of serum vitamin B12 and reduced holo-TC after 4 weeks. Plasma holo-TC may be a fast-responding biomarker to monitor adequate supply of vitamin B12 in plant-based individuals.",

Althought plant-based diets are at risk of nutritional deficiencies such as proteins, iron, vitamin D, calcium, iodine, omega-3, and vitamin B12, the available evidence shows that well planned vegetarian and vegan diets may be considered safe during pregnancy and lactation, but they require a strong awareness for a balanced intake of key nutrients. A review of the scientific literature in this field was performed, focusing specifically on observational studies in humans, in order to investigate protective effects elicited by maternal diets enriched in plant-derived foods and possible unfavorable outcomes related to micronutrients deficiencies and their impact on fetal development. A design of pregestational nutrition intervention is required in order to avoid maternal undernutrition and consequent impaired fetal growth.",

      "abstract": "Background Dietary interventions may play a role in secondary cardiovascular prevention. hsCRP (High-sensitivity C-reactive protein) is a marker of risk for major adverse cardiovascular outcomes in coronary artery disease. Methods and Results The open-label, blinded end-point, EVADE CAD (Effects of a Vegan Versus the American Heart Association-Recommended Diet in Coronary Artery Disease) trial randomized participants (n=100) with coronary artery disease to 8 weeks of a vegan or American Heart Association-recommended diet with provision of groceries, tools to measure dietary intake, and dietary counseling. The primary end point was high-sensitivity C-reactive protein. A linear regression model compared end points after 8 weeks of a vegan versus American Heart Association diet and adjusted for baseline concentration of the end point. Significance levels for the primary and secondary end points were set at 0.05 and 0.0015, respectively. A vegan diet resulted in a significant 32% lower high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (β, 0.68, 95% confidence interval [0.49-0.94]; P=0.02) when compared with the American Heart Association diet. Results were consistent after adjustment for age, race, baseline waist circumference, diabetes mellitus, and prior myocardial infarction (adjusted β, 0.67 [0.47-0.94], P=0.02). The degree of reduction in body mass index and waist circumference did not significantly differ between the 2 diet groups (adjusted β, 0.99 [0.97-1.00], P=0.10; and adjusted β, 1.00 [0.98-1.01], P=0.66, respectively). There were also no significant differences in markers of glycemic control between the 2 diet groups. There was a nonsignificant 13% reduction in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol with the vegan diet when compared with the American Heart Association diet (adjusted β, 0.87 [0.78-0.97], P=0.01). There were no significant differences in other lipid parameters. Conclusions In patients with coronary artery disease on guideline-directed medical therapy, a vegan diet may be considered to lower high-sensitivity C-reactive protein as a risk marker of adverse outcomes.

We enrolled three groups of healthy men (omnivores, vegetarians, and vegans) with similar age, weight and BMI, and we observed a significant decrease in muscle mass index and lean body mass in vegan compared to vegetarian and omnivore groups, and higher serum homocysteine levels in vegetarians and vegans compared to omnivores. We studied whether serum from omnivore, vegetarian, and vegan subjects affected oxidative stress, growth and differentiation of both cardiomyoblast cell line H9c2 and H-H9c2 (H9c2 treated with H2 O2 to induce oxidative damage). We demonstrated that vegan sera treatment of both H9c2 and H-H9c2 cells induced an increase of TBARS values and cell death and a decrease of free NO2- compared to vegetarian and omnivorous sera. Afterwards, we investigated the protective effects of vegan, vegetarian, and omnivore sera on the morphological changes induced by H2 O2 in H9c2 cell line. We showed that the omnivorous sera had major antioxidant and differentiation properties compared to vegetarian and vegan sera. Finally, we evaluated the influence of the three different groups of sera on MAPKs pathway and our data suggested that ERK expression increased in H-H9c2 cells treated with vegetarian and vegan sera and could promote cell death. The results obtained in this study demonstrated that restrictive vegan diet could not prevent the onset of metabolic and cardiovascular diseases nor protect by oxidative damage.",

A short-term, vegan protein diet regimen nutritionally balanced in macronutrient composition compared to an omnivorous diet is hypothesized to improve metabolic measurements of blood sugar regulation, blood lipids, and amino acid metabolism. METHODS AND RESULTS: This randomized, cross-over, controlled vegan versus animal diet challenge is conducted on 21 (11 female,10 male) healthy participants. Fasting plasma is measured during a 3 d diet intervention for clinical biochemistry and metabonomics. Intervention diet plans meet individual caloric needs. Meals are provided and supervised. Diet compliance is monitored. CONCLUSIONS: The vegan diet lowers triglycerides, insulin and homeostatic model assessment (HOMA-IR), bile acids, elevated magnesium levels, and changed branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) metabolism (p < 0.05), potentiating insulin and blood sugar control after 48 h. Cholesterol control improves significantly in the vegan versus omnivorous diets. Plasma amino acid and magnesium concentrations positively correlate with dietary amino acids. Polyunsaturated fatty acids and dietary fiber inversely correlate with insulin, HOMA-IR, and triglycerides. Nutritional biochemistries, BCAAs, insulin, and HOMA-IR are impacted by sexual dimorphism. A health-promoting, BCAA-associated metabolic signature is produced from a short-term, healthy, controlled, vegan diet challenge when compared with a healthy, controlled, omnivorous diet.",

      "abstract": "Acidogenic diets, commonly measured by the potential renal acid load (PRAL), have been linked with metabolic diseases including insulin resistance, hepatic dysfunction, and cardiometabolic risk. Vegan diets are linked to low dietary acid loads, but the degree of adherence to a vegan diet to demonstrate this benefit is unknown. This study compared the change in PRAL and urine pH of omnivores who followed a vegan diet for either 2, 3, or 7 days over one week. Healthy adults were recruited from a campus population and randomly assigned to one of the three groups: VEG7 (vegan diet followed for seven consecutive days); VEG3 (vegan diet followed for three evenly spaced days over one week); or VEG2 (vegan diet followed for two evenly spaced days over one week). Gender, age, and body mass index did not differ between groups (overall: 21.8 ± 2.4 y and 24.4 ± 5.6 kg/m2). Following the one week intervention, outcome measures did not vary between the VEG2 and VEG3 groups, and these groups were collapsed for the final analyses. The 24-h urine pH was raised after seven consistent days of vegan diet adherence and was unchanged after 2-3 days of vegan diet adherence over the course of a week (+0.52 ± 0.69 and -0.02 ± 0.56 respectively, p = 0.048). However, dietary PRAL scores fell significantly in both dietary groups during the 7-day trial. Since low dietary PRAL scores have been related to improve metabolic parameters, adoption of a vegan diets for several days per week should be explored as a diet strategy to lower disease risk.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Several intervention studies have suggested that vegetarian or vegan diets have clinical benefits, particularly in terms of glycemic control, in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D); however, no randomized controlled trial has been conducted in Asians who more commonly depend on plant-based foods, as compared to Western populations. Here, we aimed to compare the effect of a vegan diet and conventional diabetic diet on glycemic control among Korean individuals. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Participants diagnosed with T2D were randomly assigned to follow either a vegan diet (excluding animal-based food including fish; n = 46) or a conventional diet recommended by the Korean Diabetes Association 2011 (n = 47) for 12 weeks. HbA1c levels were measured at weeks 0, 4, and 12, and the primary study endpoint was the change in HbA1c levels over 12 weeks. RESULTS: The mean HbA1c levels at weeks 0, 4, and 12 were 7.7%, 7.2%, and 7.1% in the vegan group, and 7.4%, 7.2%, and 7.2% in the conventional group, respectively. Although both groups showed significant reductions in HbA1C levels, the reductions were larger in the vegan group than in the conventional group (-0.5% vs. -0.2%; p-for-interaction = 0.017). When only considering participants with high compliance, the difference in HbA1c level reduction between the groups was found to be larger (-0.9% vs. -0.3%). The beneficial effect of vegan diets was noted even after adjusting for changes in total energy intake or waist circumference over the 12 weeks. CONCLUSION: Both diets led to reductions in HbA1c levels; however, glycemic control was better with the vegan diet than with the conventional diet. Thus, the dietary guidelines for patients with T2D should include a vegan diet for the better management and treatment. However, further studies are needed to evaluate the long-term effects of a vegan diet, and to identify potential explanations of the underlying mechanisms. TRIAL REGISTRATION: CRiS KCT0001771.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: We have previously noted beneficial health outcomes when individuals follow a dietary restriction plan in accordance with the Daniel Fast (DF). This is true whether individuals eliminate all animal products or include small amounts of meat and dairy in their plan. The present study sought to compare anthropometric and biochemical measures of health in individuals following a traditional DF (i.e., restricted vegan) or modified DF (i.e., restricted omnivorous; inclusive of ad libitum meat and skim milk consumption), with those following an unrestricted vegan diet plan. METHODS: 35 subjects (six men; 29 women; 33 ± 2 years; range: 18-67 years) completed a 21-day diet plan. Subjects reported to the lab for pre- (day 1) and post-intervention testing (day 22) in a 10 h fasted state. Blood samples were collected and assayed for complete blood count, metabolic panel, lipid panel, insulin, HOMA-IR, C-reactive protein, and oxidative stress biomarkers (malondialdehyde, advanced oxidation protein products, and nitrate/nitrite). Heart rate and blood pressure were measured and body composition was determined via dual energy X-ray absorptiometry. Subjects' self-reported compliance, mental and physical health, and satiety in relation to the dietary modification were recorded. RESULTS: No interaction effects were noted for our outcome measures (p > 0.05). However, subjects in the traditional DF group reported an approximate 10% increase in perceived mental and physical health, with a 25% reduction in malondialdehyde and a 33% reduction in blood insulin. Systolic BP was reduced approximately 7 mmHg in subjects assigned to the traditional DF, with an approximate 5 mmHg reduction in subjects assigned to the modified DF and the unrestricted vegan plan. A small (2 mmHg) reduction in diastolic BP was noted for subjects in both DF groups; a slight increase in diastolic BP was noted for subjects assigned to the unrestricted vegan group. An approximate 20% reduction was noted in total and LDL cholesterol for subjects in the traditional DF group, with an approximate 10% decrease for subjects in the modified DF group. No decrease in total or LDL cholesterol was noted for subjects in the unrestricted vegan group. CONCLUSION: These data indicate that both a traditional or modified DF may improve blood pressure and blood lipids in a clinically meaningful manner if these results are sustained over the long term. A traditional DF also results in a significant reduction in blood insulin and oxidative stress. An unrestricted vegan diet may improve systolic blood pressure, but in the absence of measures to strictly monitor adherence, it does not favorably impact other markers of health measured in the present study."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Epidemiologic evidence, reinforced by clinical and laboratory studies, shows that the rich Western diet is the major underlying cause of death and disability (e.g, from cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes) in Western industrialized societies. The objective of this study is to document the effects that eating a low-fat (≤10% of calories), high-carbohydrate (~80% of calories), moderate-sodium, purely plant-based diet ad libitum for 7 days can have on the biomarkers of cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes. METHODS: Retrospective analysis of measurements of weight, blood pressure, blood sugar, and blood lipids and estimation of cardiovascular disease risk at baseline and day 7 from 1615 participants in a 10-day residential dietary intervention program from 2002 to 2011. Wilcoxon's signed-rank test was used for testing the significance of changes from baseline. RESULTS: The median (interquartile range, IQR) weight loss was 1.4 (1.8) kg (p < .001). The median (IQR) decrease in total cholesterol was 22 (29) mg/dL (p < .001). Even though most antihypertensive and antihyperglycemic medications were reduced or discontinued at baseline, systolic blood pressure decreased by a median (IQR) of 8 (18) mm Hg (p < .001), diastolic blood pressure by a median (IQR) of 4 (10) mm Hg (p < .001), and blood glucose by a median (IQR) of 3 (11) mg/dL (p < .001). For patients whose risk of a cardiovascular event within 10 years was >7.5% at baseline, the risk dropped to 5.5% (>27%) at day 7 (p < .001). CONCLUSIONS: A low-fat, starch-based, vegan diet eaten ad libitum for 7 days results in significant favorable changes in commonly tested biomarkers that are used to predict future risks for cardiovascular disease and metabolic diseases.",

However, there are few data concerning the possible cardiovascular effects of a vegan diet (with no meat, dairy or egg products). Vitamin B-12 deficiency is highly prevalent in vegetarians; this can be partially alleviated by taking dairy/egg products in lact-ovo-vegetarians. However, metabolic vitamin B-12 deficiency is highly prevalent in vegetarians in Australia, Germany, Italy and Austria, and in vegans (80%) in Hong Kong and India, where vegans rarely take vitamin B-12 fortified food or vitamin B-12 supplements. Similar deficiencies exist in northern Chinese rural communities consuming inadequate meat, egg or dairy products due to poverty or dietary habits. Vascular studies have demonstrated impaired arterial endothelial function and increased carotid intima-media thickness as atherosclerosis surrogates in such metabolic vitamin B-12 deficient populations, but not in lactovegetarians in China. Vitamin B-12 supplementation has a favourable impact on these vascular surrogates in Hong Kong vegans and in underprivileged communities in northern rural China. Regular monitoring of vitamin B-12 status is thus potentially beneficial for early detection and treatment of metabolic vitamin B-12 deficiency in vegans, and possibly for prevention of atherosclerosis-related diseases.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Low-fat vegetarian and vegan diets are associated with weight loss, increased insulin sensitivity, and improved cardiovascular health. OBJECTIVE: We compared the effects of a low-fat vegan diet and conventional diabetes diet recommendations on glycemia, weight, and plasma lipids. DESIGN: Free-living individuals with type 2 diabetes were randomly assigned to a low-fat vegan diet (n = 49) or a diet following 2003 American Diabetes Association guidelines (conventional, n = 50) for 74 wk. Glycated hemoglobin (Hb A(1c)) and plasma lipids were assessed at weeks 0, 11, 22, 35, 48, 61, and 74. Weight was measured at weeks 0, 22, and 74. RESULTS: Weight loss was significant within each diet group but not significantly different between groups (-4.4 kg in the vegan group and -3.0 kg in the conventional diet group, P = 0.25) and related significantly to Hb A(1c) changes (r = 0.50, P = 0.001). Hb A(1c) changes from baseline to 74 wk or last available values were -0.34 and -0.14 for vegan and conventional diets, respectively (P = 0.43). Hb A(1c) changes from baseline to last available value or last value before any medication adjustment were -0.40 and 0.01 for vegan and conventional diets, respectively (P = 0.03). In analyses before alterations in lipid-lowering medications, total cholesterol decreased by 20.4 and 6.8 mg/dL in the vegan and conventional diet groups, respectively (P = 0.01); LDL cholesterol decreased by 13.5 and 3.4 mg/dL in the vegan and conventional groups, respectively (P = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: Both diets were associated with sustained reductions in weight and plasma lipid concentrations. In an analysis controlling for medication changes, a low-fat vegan diet appeared to improve glycemia and plasma lipids more than did conventional diabetes diet recommendations. Whether the observed differences provide clinical benefit for the macro- or microvascular complications of diabetes remains to be established.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Although therapeutic diets are critical to diabetes management, their acceptability to patients is largely unstudied. OBJECTIVE: To quantify adherence and acceptability for two types of diets for diabetes. DESIGN: Controlled trial conducted between 2004 and 2006. SUBJECTS/SETTING: Individuals with type 2 diabetes (n=99) at a community-based research facility. Participants were randomly assigned to a diet following 2003 American Diabetes Association guidelines or a low-fat, vegan diet for 74 weeks. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Attrition, adherence, dietary behavior, diet acceptability, and cravings. STATISTICAL ANALYSES: For nutrient intake and questionnaire scores, t tests determined between-group differences. For diet-acceptability measures, the related samples Wilcoxon sum rank test assessed within-group changes; the independent samples Mann-Whitney U test compared the diet groups. Changes in reported symptoms among the groups was compared using chi(2) for independent samples. RESULTS: All participants completed the initial 22 weeks; 90% (45/50) of American Diabetes Association guidelines diet group and 86% (42/49) of the vegan diet group participants completed 74 weeks. Fat and cholesterol intake fell more and carbohydrate and fiber intake increased more in the vegan group. At 22 weeks, group-specific diet adherence criteria were met by 44% (22/50) of members of the American Diabetes Association diet group and 67% (33/49) of vegan-group participants (P=0.019); the American Diabetes Association guidelines diet group reported a greater increase in dietary restraint; this difference was not significant at 74 weeks. Both groups reported reduced hunger and reduced disinhibition. Questionnaire responses rated both diets as satisfactory, with no significant differences between groups, except for ease of preparation, for which the 22-week ratings marginally favored the American Diabetes Association guideline group. Cravings for fatty foods diminished more in the vegan group at 22 weeks, with no significant difference at 74 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: Despite its greater influence on macronutrient intake, a low-fat, vegan diet has an acceptability similar to that of a more conventional diabetes diet. Acceptability appears to be no barrier to its use in medical nutrition therapy.",

This study examined protective (eg, antioxidant vitamins, carotenoids, and fiber) and pathogenic (eg, saturated fatty acids and cholesterol) dietary factors in a very-low-fat vegan diet. Ninety-three early-stage prostate cancer patients participated in a randomized controlled trial and were assigned to a very-low-fat (10% fat) vegan diet supplemented with soy protein and lifestyle changes or to usual care. Three-day food records were collected at baseline (n=42 intervention, n=43 control) and after 1 year (n=37 in each group). Analyses of changes in dietary intake of macronutrients, vitamins, minerals, carotenoids, and isoflavones from baseline to 1 year showed significantly increased intake of most protective dietary factors (eg, fiber increased from a mean of 31 to 59 g/day, lycopene increased from 8,693 to 34,464 mug/day) and significantly decreased intake of most pathogenic dietary factors (eg, saturated fatty acids decreased from 20 to 5 g/day, cholesterol decreased from 200 to 10 mg/day) in the intervention group compared to controls. These results suggest that a very-low-fat vegan diet can be useful in increasing intake of protective nutrients and phytochemicals and minimizing intake of dietary factors implicated in several chronic diseases.",

      "abstract": "Although a salted diet appears to be a sine qua non for the development of essential hypertension, low-salt diets often have a modest or even negligible impact on the blood pressure of hypertensives; this suggests that salt, perhaps often acting in concert with other aspects of a modern, rich diet, may set in place certain metabolic vicious cycles that sustain blood pressure elevation even when dietary salt is eliminated. Therapeutic fasting is known to lower elevated blood pressure - presumably in large part because it minimizes insulin secretion - and may have the potential to break some of these vicious cycles. Goldhamer has recently reported that a regimen comprised of a water-only fast of moderate duration, followed by a transition to a low-fat, low-salt, whole-food vegan diet, achieves dramatic reductions in the blood pressure of hypertensives, such that the large majority of patients can be restored to normotensive status, in the absence of any drug therapy. Although long-term follow-up of these subjects has been sporadic, the available data suggest that these large reductions is blood pressure can be conserved in patients who remain compliant with the follow-up diet - in other words, a 'cure' for hypertension may be feasible. If a protein-sparing modified fast can be shown to be virtually as effective as a total fast for achieving these benefits, it may be possible to implement this regimen safely on an outpatient basis. The ability of therapeutic fasts to break metabolic vicious cycles may also contribute to the efficacy of fasting in the treatment of type 2 diabetes and autoimmune disorders. As a general principle, if a metabolic disorder is susceptible to prevention - but not reversal - by a specific diet, and therapeutic fasting has a temporary favorable impact on this disorder, then a more definitive therapy may consist of a therapeutic fast, followed up by the protective diet as a maintenance regimen.",

SUBJECTS AND STUDY INTERVENTIONS: This study evaluated the influence of a 4-week, very low-fat (approximately 10%), vegan diet on 24 free-living subjects with RA, average age, 56 +/- 11 years old. OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Prestudy and poststudy assessment of RA symptomatology was performed by a rheumatologist blind to the study design. Biochemical measures and 4-day diet data were also collected. Subjects met weekly for diet instruction, compliance monitoring, and progress assessments. RESULTS: There were significant (p < 0.001) decreases in fat (69%), protein (24%), and energy (22%), and a significant increase in carbohydrate (55%) intake. All measures of RA symptomatology decreased significantly (p < 0.05), except for duration of morning stiffness (p > 0.05). Weight also decreased significantly (p < 0.001). At 4 weeks, C-reactive protein decreased 16% (ns, p > 0.05), RA factor decreased 10% (ns, p > 0.05), while erythrocyte sedimentation rate was unchanged (p > 0.05). CONCLUSION: This study showed that patients with moderate-to-severe RA, who switch to a very low-fat, vegan diet can experience significant reductions in RA symptoms.",

MEDICAL HISTORY: We present a 33-year-old patient with double-sided HLA B27-positive sacroiliitis, which was diagnosed by magnetic resonance tomography. Since about 10 years he therefore had pain in the iliosacral region. Numerous sessions of physiotherapy, a cure treatment, and treatment with sulfasalazine and doxycycline were not effective. The patient was dependent on the daily intake of the nonsteroidal antirheumatics meloxicam 2 x 7.5 mg and ibuprofen 400-800 mg and the analgetic tramadol 50-150 mg, but evening and night pain and morning stiffness persisted under this treatment. TREATMENT: We recommended a temporary vegan diet, i.e. to completely avoid animal fats and proteins. COURSE: 3-4 days after changing on vegan diet the complaints improved distinctly and persistently. After consumption of meat 6 weeks later, complaints worsened. Consequent vegan diet again resulted in significant improvement of the pain and morning stiffness. At follow-up 3 months after the initial contact, tramadol and ibuprofen intakes had been stopped, meloxicam had been reduced to 1 x 7.5 mg. The patient was almost completely free of complaints. CONCLUSIONS: It was demonstrated that in a single case of sacroiliitis which was refractory to other treatment, vegan diet resulted in a convincingly improvement of complaints.",

      "abstract": "We have performed a number of studies including dietary interventions and cross-sectional studies on subjects consuming uncooked vegan food called living food (LF) and clarified the changes in several parameters related to health risk factors. LF consists of germinated seeds, cereals, sprouts, vegetables, fruits, berries and nuts. Some items are fermented and contain a lot of lactobacilli. The diet is rich in fiber. It has very little sodium, and it contains no cholesterol. Food items like berries and wheat grass juice are rich in antioxidants such as carotenoids and flavonoids. The subjects eating living food show increased levels of carotenoids and vitamins C and E and lowered cholesterol concentration in their sera. Urinary excretion of sodium is only a fraction of the omnivorous controls. Also urinary output of phenol and p-cresol is lowered as are several fecal enzyme levels which are considered harmful. The rheumatoid arthritis patients eating the LF diet reported amelioration of their pain, swelling of joints and morning stiffness which all got worse after finishing LF diet. The composite indices of objective measures showed also improvement of the rheumatoid arthritis patients during the intervention. The fibromyalgic subjects eating LF lost weight compared to their omnivorous controls. The results on their joint stiffness and pain (visual analogue scale), on their quality of sleep, on health assessment questionnaire and on general health questionnaire all improved. It appears that the adoption of vegan diet exemplified by the living food leads to a lessening of several health risk factors to cardiovascular diseases and cancer. Rheumatoid patients subjectively benefited from the vegan diet which was also seen in serum parameters and fecal analyses.",

Current research raises concerns as to whether comprehensive lifestyle approaches including a plant-based diet may interact with other known modulators of homocysteine levels. METHODS: We report our observations of homocysteine levels in 40 self-selected subjects who participated in a vegan diet-based lifestyle program. Each subject attended a residential lifestyle change program at the Lifestyle Center of America in Sulphur, Oklahoma and had fasting plasma total homocysteine measured on enrollment and then after 1 week of lifestyle intervention. The intervention included a vegan diet, moderate physical exercise, stress management and spirituality enhancement sessions, group support, and exclusion of tobacco, alcohol, and caffeine. B vitamin supplements known to reduce blood homocysteine levels were not provided. RESULTS: Subjects' mean homocysteine levels fell 13%: from 8.66 micromol/L (SD 2.7 micromol/L) to 7.53 micromol/L (SD 2.12 micromol/L; P < 0.0001). Subgroup analysis showed that homocysteine decreased across a range of demographic and diagnostic categories. Conclusions. Our results suggest that broad-based lifestyle interventions favorably impact homocysteine levels. Furthermore, analysis of Lifestyle Center of America program components suggests that other factors in addition to B vitamin intake may be involved in the observed homocysteine lowering.",

During the 55-day stay, average body weight decreased by 5.1kg. Lansbury index and ESR decreased whereas CRP did not change. WBC decreased and the differential cell counts showed a decrease of neutrophils, eosinophils and monocytes without a change in lymphocytes or basophils. RBC, hemoglobin and MCV increased. LDL-C decreased, while HDL-C increased. There was no change in total protein or albumin.

Based on clinical assessments before, during and after the intervention period, a disease improvement index was constructed for each patient. According to the index, patients were assigned either to a group with a high improvement index (HI) or to a group with a low improvement index (LO). Stool samples collected from each patient before the intervention and at 1 month were analysed by direct stool sample gas-liquid chromatography of bacterial cellular fatty acids. This method has proved to be a simple and sensitive way to detect changes and differences in the faecal microbial flora between individual stool samples or groups of them. A significant, diet-induced change in the faecal flora (P = 0.001) was observed in the test group, but not in the control group. Further, in the test group, a significant (P = 0.001) difference was detected between the HI and LO categories at 1 month, but not in the pre-test samples. We conclude that a vegan diet changes the faecal microbial flora in RA patients, and changes in the faecal flora are associated with improvement in RA activity.",

Unfortunately, in some patients, the poor palatability and the high cost of the protein-free substitutes, together with difficulties in following the diet away from home, can make good compliance difficult, possibly causing low energy intake and malnutrition. Here the results are reported of an attempt we made to overcome these drawbacks, using a diet supplying only natural foods of plant origin in definite proportions to give an essential amino acid supply satisfying the recommended dietary allowance. This is possible thanks to an appropriate cereal-legume mixture, supplying proteins complementary for essential amino acids. Additional positive features of this special vegan diet (SVD) are the high ratio of unsaturated to saturated fatty acids, the absence of cholesterol, and the lower net acid production in comparison with a mixed diet. This study indicates that the results obtained with the SVD are similar to those obtained with the CLPD. Therefore the SVD can be a substitute for the CLPD in the management of patients with mild chronic renal failure. The SVD is the diet of choice when products made of starch are not available or poorly tolerated.",

The subjects in the control group continued their usual diets and received no tutoring. Adherence to the strict vegan diet was assessed on the basis of urinary sodium excretion and by the information on consumption of specific food items (wheatgrass juice and the rejuvelac drink). The use of these drinks was variable, and some boiled vegetables were consumed occasionally. However, only one of the subjects in the vegan diet group lacked a clear decrease in urinary sodium excretion. Rheumatoid patients had lower than recommended intakes of iron, zinc and niacin, and their energy intake was low compared to mean daily energy intake of the healthy Finnish females of the same age. Shifting to the uncooked vegan diet significantly increased the intakes of energy and many nutrients. In spite of the increased energy intake, the group on the vegan diet lost 9% of their body weight during the intervention period, indicating a low availability of energy from the vegan diet.",
