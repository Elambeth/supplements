AIM: To explore the effects of mood and depression in patients with endometrial cancer after cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and mindfulness-based stress reduction. METHODS: In a prospective study, 90 patients with diabetes, endometrial cancer, and depression were selected from January 2023 to January 2024 in our hospital. There were 45 patients in the control group and 45 patients in the observation group. In addition to the conventional treatment, the control group received cognitive behavioral treatment, and the observation group: Control group was given to compare changes in mood state and sleep quality before and after the intervention. Follow-up was performed3 months after treatment completion. RESULTS: Before treatment, the mood and sleep quality scores between the two groups (P > 0.05); in the observation group, the 5 negative mood scores were lower and lower than the control group; the 2 positive mood scores were higher than in the control group, and the difference was statistically significant (P < 0.05); compared with before treatment, the 7 sleep quality scores and Pittsburgh sleep quality index scale total score in the observation group and lower in the control group (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: In patients with diabetes and endometrial cancer, mood state and sleep quality significantly improved after CBT and breathing relaxation. These findings provide new and effective treatment strategies in clinical practice."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Parents of children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) often experience high levels of parental stress. This has exacerbated during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The aim of this study was to examine the effectiveness of mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) programme in the Chinese population, which is feasible among Chinese parents during the COVID-19 pandemic period in reducing the parental stress of parents compared with the usual care group. METHODS: This study was designed as a pilot randomized controlled trial with single-blind repeated measures. Parents of children aged 3-12 years with a diagnosis of ADHD were recruited from the parent resource center (PRC) of a local nongovernmental organization between June and August 2022. The participants were randomly assigned to the MBSR intervention group (n = 18) or usual care group (n = 18). RESULTS: With respect to the feasibility of the study, all 36 participants who were randomized fully completed the MBSR programme and assessments, resulting in a 100% attendance rate. 66% of the participants in the intervention group reported satisfaction with the intervention, which was helpful in reducing stress. They were willing to stay on this mindfulness-based programme in the future. The results of the repeated-measures ANOVA revealed a significant difference in self-perceived stress reduction between the groups (p < 0.001, ES = 0.192). The of within-group results revealed that the mean score of the intervention group decreased from 29.44 before the intervention to 25.50 (p < 0.001) immediately after intervention, and further decreased to 24.72 (p < 0.05) at one month after the intervention. By using the parental stress scale, the interaction effects also revealed significant differences between groups (p < 0.001, ES = 0.599). The stress level of the intervention group decreased from 74.50 before intervention, to 68.94 (p < 0.001) immediately after intervention, and further decreased to 67.50 (p < 0.05) at one month after intervention. These reports revealed statistically significant improvements in stress reduction and parental stress reduction in the intervention group. CONCLUSION: The pilot study revealed that MBSR is feasible and acceptable for parents of children with ADHD in Chinese culture. The findings also suggested that the MBSR programme was effective in reducing parental stress and enhancing mental well-being. This study was registered in the National Library of Medicine, National Center for Biotechnology Information Clinical Trials Registry as Version 1, and the trial registration data are available as NCT06210113, 28/2/2024.",

      "abstract": "Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) has shown potential in reducing anxiety-related symptoms. This systematic review examines the effectiveness of MBSR in treating anxiety disorders in individuals aged 13-26. The review addresses three key themes: \"The Prevalence and Impact of Anxiety Disorders in Everyday Life,\" \"The Efficacy and Effectiveness of MBSR in the Management of Anxiety Disorders,\" and \"The Techniques and Interventions of MBSR in Anxiety Treatment.\" A total of nine studies were included in the meta-analysis, focusing on individuals aged 13-26 participating in MBSR interventions. The findings consistently indicate significant reductions in level of anxiety, along with improvements in emotional regulation and coping skills. These results suggest that MBSR is an effective therapeutic tool for managing anxiety disorders in this demographic, demonstrating notable efficacy across diverse settings. Meta-analytic evidence, following PRISMA guidelines, indicates MBSR as a powerful intervention for reducing anxiety and enhancing overall mental health within this age group. The review emphasizes the necessity for practitioners to incorporate MBSR into clinical practice as it offers benefits for long-term anxiety management."

The purpose of this study was to investigate and compare the effectiveness of mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) versus cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) on emotion regulation, mindfulness, and cognitive-executive functions in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study was a clinical trial with two intervention groups and one control group. The number of 96 patients referred to the rheumatology clinic was selected using random sampling and divided into two intervention groups and a control group. In this study, the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale, Five-Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire, Stroop task, Tower of London task, and Wisconsin Card Sorting Task were used at baseline, posttest, and follow-up. Data were analyzed by SPSS22 using analysis of variance (ANOVA) with repeated measurements. RESULTS: The findings showed that MBSR and CBT have significant effects on mindfulness (P > 001), emotion regulation (P > 001), and cognitive-executive functions (P > 001). Specifically, MBSR led to greater improvements in emotion regulation and mindfulness, while CBT led to greater improvement in cognitive-executive functions. CONCLUSION: MBSR and CBT can be used as effective treatments to improve emotion regulation, mindfulness, and cognitive-executive functions in patients with rheumatoid arthritis."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The inclusion of behavioral therapy and stress reduction techniques among vocational students of the Nigerian universities is crucial for enhancing their practical skill acquisition and career prospects in challenging academic scenarios. This study explored the combined effects of cognitive-behavioral therapy and mindfulness-based stress reduction in reducing test anxiety among business education students in a measurement and evaluation course. METHODS: Employing a randomized control trial with a pretest-posttest design, the research draws responses from 483 students from two universities in Southeast Nigeria. The participants were randomly assigned to either the treatment or waitlist control groups on the basis of set inclusion criteria. Data collection was conducted via four different instruments, and the treatment group participated in a Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy and Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (CBT-MBSR) program. Evaluations of both groups were conducted at three different stages: before the intervention, immediately after the intervention, and during the follow-up period. Analysis was carried out via repeated-measures ANOVA and multivariate analysis of covariance (MANCOVA). RESULTS: The results indicated that TVET students who underwent the CBT-MBSR intervention had significantly lower post-treatment test anxiety scores than those in the wait-list control group. The intervention also had a significant multivariate effect on reducing test anxiety, improved mindfulness, students' academic achievement, and their well-being (F value = 1168.52 (p =.001, η² = 0.752). CONCLUSION: This study assessed the efficacy of CBT with MBSR in reducing test anxiety, improving academic performance, and increasing well-being among students in TVET settings. The study revealed how CBT helped reduce test anxiety, thereby improving students' academic performance through increasing their concentration. Thus, this study provides fresh knowledge on how to improve psychological well-being and educational performance by introducing a new method of combining MBSR and CBT, which enriches the literature with a dual-modality approach that helps students reduce their anxieties and fosters their personal growth. This study has practical implications for university administrators, educators, and researchers and offers several recommendations. CLINICAL TRIAL NUMBER: Not applicable.",

      "abstract": "Purpose The purpose of this study was to describe the implementation and efficacy of a mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) program for treating dizziness symptoms in subjects with vestibular migraine (VM). Materials and methods A non-controlled prospective cohort study of 20 adult English-speaking patients with a diagnosis of VM was undertaken at a single tertiary referral center. A virtual platform was used to administer an eight-week-long MBSR course with required reading materials and weekly 2.5-hour guided meditation and instructional sessions. Pre- and post-MBSR scores on the Dizziness Handicap Index (DHI), Cognitive Failures Questionnaire (CFQ), Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), General Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7), VM Patient Assessment Tool and Handicap Inventory (VM-PATHI), Patient Reported Outcome Measure Information System (PROMIS) Global Physical and Mental Health Forms, and daily vertigo severity scores were collected. Results Twenty participants (100.0% female; 70.0% (n=14) White; with an average age of 46.7 years (SD 16.3), completed the study. The DHI, CFQ, PHQ-9, GAD-7, VM-PATHI, and PROMIS scores all improved significantly after MBSR treatment compared to prior to treatment (all questionnaires, p<0.01 except for CFQ; p=0.03). Mean daily vertigo scores did not change significantly over time in the 24-day lead-in period (adjusted r2 = 0.03; p=0.54) but decreased significantly over the eight-week MBSR treatment period (adjusted r2 = 0.32; p<0.001). Conclusions In this non-controlled, prospective pilot study, a MBSR program was highly effective for decreasing dizziness burden and improving measures of quality of life in subjects with VM. Future randomized controlled trials are warranted and forthcoming."

Mindfulness-based stress reduction focuses on increasing awareness and acceptance of moment-to-moment experiences including difficult emotions and physical discomfort. OBJECTIVE: To examine the effects of a Mindfulness-based stress reduction intervention on the functional and psychosocial outcomes of Long-COVID patients. DESIGN: A two-arm randomized controlled trial with repeated-measures design. SETTING: Department of Anesthesia and critical care. PARTICIPANTS: COVID-19 survivors (105 patients). METHODS: The patients were randomly allocated to either psychoeducation (intervention group) or usual care (control group) (53 vs 52 patients per group). A Mindfulnes program was implemented in the intervention group included an 8-week Mindfulnes-program (2 hours per week) in a group format. Study outcomes included Chronic pain (pain intensity and pain interference) assessed with Brief Pain Inventory (primary outcomes), Anxiety and Depression assessed with Hospital anxiety and depression scale, Insomnia assessed with the Insomnia Severity Index. Data were collected at 6 month and 12 months after Mindfulness-program. RESULTS: A reduction in pain intensity and pain interference on some activities of daily living were observed 6 and 12 months after intervention. A statistically significant difference emerged in the mean score of symptoms of anxiety in favor of the intervention group (11.28 vs 13.15, t= -3.636, p< .001) at 6 month and at 12 months (10.88 vs 13.41, t= -5.167, p< .001) and in the mean score of the symptoms of depression in favor of the intervention group (9.95 vs 11.23, t= -2.823, p= .007) at 6 month and at 12 months (9.67 vs 10.69, t= -2.458, p= .018). Symptoms of insomnia were statistically reduced 6 months after the Mindfulness-program (score: 53.2 vs 30.4, x= 4.944, p= .026). CONCLUSIONS: In light of what emerged from our study, we suggest a Mindfulness program in addition to drug therapy to be carried out once a year on patients with consequences of COVID-19. Studies with larger sample sizes that attempt to test a Mindfulness-program twice a year are needed.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Chronic musculoskeletal pain conditions affect millions of people worldwide and place a significant burden on individuals and the healthcare systems. Managing chronic musculoskeletal pain requires a multidisciplinary approach that considers biological, psychological, and social factors. However, access to multidisciplinary pain care is challenging, and long wait times can lead to increased stress and health deterioration. Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) is a mind-body approach developed specifically to reduce the distress of living with chronic conditions, such as chronic musculoskeletal pain. This study proposed a novel approach by offering an online MBSR program to patients on waitlists to attend a multidisciplinary pain clinic in Australia's public healthcare system that could improve health outcomes. The study aims to assess the feasibility, acceptability, and potential efficacy of this approach using a pilot study design with a mixed-methods approach. METHODS: This is a mixed-methods pilot randomised controlled trial with an embedded qualitative study. Participants will be recruited from waitlists at two multidisciplinary pain management centres within the Sydney Local Health District in New South Wales, Australia. This pilot trial will randomly assign 32 individuals with chronic musculoskeletal pain to either an online MBSR group or a usual care control group. Feasibility outcomes, patient-reported outcomes, adherence to mindfulness practice, and adverse events will be assessed using validated questionnaires. Semi-structured interviews will be conducted with participants in the MBSR group to explore their experiences and evaluate acceptability, and barriers and facilitators of engagement with the intervention. DISCUSSION: This pilot study will evaluate a novel approach to integrating MBSR into the Australian public healthcare system as a mechanism for providing support to individuals with chronic musculoskeletal pain who are waitlisted for a multidisciplinary pain management program. Findings from this study will indicate the feasibility, acceptability, safety, and preliminary efficacy of this approach in terms of patient-reported outcomes to guide the design of future large-scale clinical trials. TRIAL REGISTRATION: This trial was prospectively registered in the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ACTRN12622000822785)."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Chronic pain management includes treatment with the use of opioids, electrical stimulation and acupuncture. However, traditional understanding of chronic pain has recently been challenged in light of evidence supporting a key role of psycho-social factors and central sensitization in this population. Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR), focuses on increasing awareness and acceptance of moment-to-moment experiences including difficult emotions and physical discomfort. OBJECTIVE: To examine the effects of a MBSR on chronic pain patients. DESIGN: A two-arm, blinding randomized controlled clinical trial with repeated-measures design. SETTING: One pain management clinic in a general hospital. PARTICIPANTS: Chronic pain patients (N = 149 patients). METHODS: The patients were randomly allocated to either psychoeducation (intervention group) or usual care (control group) (N = 75 vs 74 patients per group). The randomization was minimized, taking into account the imbalance between the groups over a number of prognostic clinical and demographic factors. The intervention included an 8-week MBSR program (2 hours per week) in a group format and the MBSR program was performed 2 times (1-2 months after enrollment and 7-8 months after enrollment). Study outcomes included Chronic pain (pain intensity and pain interference) assessed with Brief Pain Inventory (primary outcomes), and other secondary outcomes (i.e., quality of life, adherence to the intervention, mindfulness and self-awareness and drug assumption). We examined the differences at baseline (clinical-demographic data collected at enrollment), at 6 (T1) and 13 months (T2) between the intervention and control groups by means of chi-square and independent samples t tests. Normally distributed measurement data were represented by means and standard deviations. RESULTS: Participants in the intervention group revealed significantly greater reductions on impact of chronic pain in terms of pain intensity (worst pain in the last 24 hours, p < .001; pain right now, p < .001) and in terms of pain interference (interference with mood, p = .002; interference with normal work, p = .043; interference with relationship with other people, p = .036) at T1, and in terms of pain intensity (worst pain in the last 24 hours, p < .001; pain on average, p =. 013; pain right now, p < .001) and in terms of pain interference (interference with mood, p < .001; Interference with sleep, p < .001) at T2. A significant difference emerged in the perceived quality of life, between two groups at T2 (55.9 vs 58.7, t(133) = - 2.053, p = .044). CONCLUSIONS: Our study added values on the benefits of patients-focused MBSR to treatment of chronic pain. Future research can evaluate its long-term effects for patients of chronic pain with diverse socio-demographic and pain-related characteristics in a greater sample.

Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) has shown promising results in quantitative studies as a complementary treatment for pathological mental fatigue (PMF) after ABI. This study aims to explore how people suffering from lasting PMF after ABI experience MBSR in relation to their PMF, with the intention of better meeting the rehabilitation needs of those affected. Seven individuals (mean age 42 years) who had suffered from long-lasting PMF after ABI took part in the study. None of them had resumed work due to their PMF, but all had recovered from neurological impairments. They were interviewed after completing an MBSR course. Thematic analysis of the participants' perspectives suggested that the MBSR program provided them with coping techniques for living with PMF. They gained a deeper understanding of their condition becoming more self-compassionate, and the treatment provided them with a forum for meeting and sharing experiences with others with similar problems. The qualitative results strengthen the evidence for MBSR as a feasible psychoeducative complementary treatment for PMF after ABI.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: This clinical trial sought to evaluate the safety and preliminary efficacy of psilocybin and MBSR for frontline healthcare providers with symptoms of depression and burnout related to the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: This was a randomized controlled trial that enrolled physicians and nurses with frontline clinical work during the COVID-19 pandemic and symptoms of depression and burnout. Participants were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either an 8-week MBSR curriculum alone or an 8-week MBSR curriculum plus group psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy (PAP) with 25mg psilocybin. Symptoms of depression and burnout were assessed at baseline, and 2-weeks and 6-months post intervention utilizing the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptoms (QIDS-SR-16) and Maslach Burnout Inventory Human Services Survey for Medical Professionals (MBI-HSS-MP), respectively. Secondary outcome measures included the Demoralization Scale (DS-II) and the Watt's Connectedness Scale (WCS). Adverse events and suicidality were assessed through 6-month follow-up. RESULTS: 25 participants were enrolled and randomized. There were 12 study-related AEs recorded that were Grade 1-2 and no serious AEs. There was larger decrease in QIDS score for the MBSR+PAP arm compared to MBSR-only from baseline to 2-weeks post-intervention and significant between-group differences favoring MBSR+PAP on subscales of the MBI-HSS-MP as well as the DS-II and WCS. CONCLUSIONS: Group psilocybin-assisted therapy plus MBSR was associated with clinically significant improvement in depressive symptoms without serious adverse events and with greater reduction in symptoms than MBSR alone. Study findings suggest that integrating psilocybin with mindfulness training may represent a promising treatment for depression and burnout among physicians and nurses."

This study was performed to determine the effect of a mindfulness-based stress reduction program on depression and quality of life in cancer patients. The screenings in the study were performed in January to May 2023 through the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), PubMed, Web of Science, Science Direct, and YÖK Thesis Center databases. After the reviews, 14 studies were included in the study. This meta-analysis showed that mindfulness-based stress reduction programs were effective on depression (SMD: -0.363; 95% CI: -0.711 to 0.015; Z = -2.042; P = .041; I2 = 85.229%) and quality of life (SMD: 0.363; 95 CI%: 0.111-0.615; Z = 2.822; P = .005; I2 = 75.222%). The type of cancer (SMD: 0.385; CI: between 0.005 and 0.528; P = .000); duration of therapy (SMD: 0.243; CI: between 0.093 and 0.393; P = .002); the person providing therapy (SMD: 0.335; CI: between 0.133 and 0.507; P = .001); scale used (SMD: 0.290; CI: between 0.148 and 0.432; P = .000); and the origin of the study (SMD: 0.298; CI: between 0.158 and 0.438; P = .000) moderators were found to play a role in the effectiveness of a mindfulness-based stress reduction program on the quality of life of cancer patients. The mindfulness-based stress reduction program yields positive outcomes by reducing depression, enhancing the quality of life in cancer patients, and promoting overall mental well-being in individuals."

The study aimed to compare the effects of Mindfulness-based Stress Reduction (MBSR) and Internet-delivered Mindfulness-based Stress Reduction (iMBSR) on burden of psychosomatic symptoms of nurses working at Al-Alhamzeh general hospital, Aldiwaniyeh, Iraq. METHODS: The study was a semi-experiment study with a pre-posttest design on 72 registered nurses. Subjects were randomly allocated in group A, in-person MBSR and group B, internet-delivered MBSR. Intervention in two groups was held at 8 weekly sessions. The data collection instrument included sociodemographic, Patient Questionnaire Health-15 (PHQ-15), and General Health Questionnaire-12 (GHQ-12). Data were analyzed with SPSS version 24 by descriptive and non-parametric inferential tests. RESULTS: The study found that 50% of the nurses in both groups reported mild somatic symptoms, and 40% reported moderate symptoms, with the majority showing no signs of mental distress. A more significant reduction in GHQ scores compared to PHQ scores was observed from pre-to post-intervention. Notably, the online MBSR group showed a significant decrease in GHQ scores, both between groups (p = 0.04) and within the online MBSR group itself (p = 0.02), highlighting the greater impact of the intervention in this group. CONCLUSION: The study highlights the positive effects of both in-person and online MBSR interventions on reducing depressive symptoms and improving mental health outcomes among nurses. Online MBSR, in particular, shows promise in addressing medically unexplained symptoms and enhancing mental well-being."

      "abstract": "UNLABELLED: Introduction: The Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction program for breast cancer survivors (MBSR [BCs]) is a stress-reducing program designed to increase cognitive functioning through four meditational practices. This randomized clinical trial aimed to determine if improvements in cognitive functioning and perceived cognitive abilities achieved from the MBSR(BC) were mediated through increased mindfulness, decreased rumination, and decreased perceived stress. Methods: Breast cancer survivors (BCSs) who met inclusion criteria of stage I, II, or III BC and received either chemotherapy (CT) or both CT and radiation were randomized to either the 6-week MBSR(BC), or Breast Cancer Education Support (BCES) program, or to a usual care (UC) regimen. Analysis of covariance was first implemented to identify potential mediators, followed by a formal mediational analysis to evaluate the effects of MBSR(BC) on 6-, 12-, and 26-week outcomes. Results: After consent, 212 BCS were randomized to MBSR(BC) (n = 91), BCES (n = 90), or UC (n = 31). The mean age was 56.5 and the majority of the BCS, 73.1%, were White and non-Hispanic. Results showed increases in \"observing\" as part of mindfulness as a potential mediator of MBSR(BC) effects on impairments on quality of life and logical memory at 6 months relative to UC. No mediation effects were identified for outcomes measured at 6 or 12 weeks and also when MBSR(BC) was compared with the BCES program. Discussion: These results partially supported our hypothesis that improvement in cognitive functioning would occur through increased mindfulness. Although few mediating relationships were identified, results showed a relationship between mindfulness and cognitive functioning. Both mediating relationships occurred through increases in \"observing,\" a subconcept of \"mindfulness,\" when compared to the MBSR(BC) with UC at 6 months. This study shows that mediators may help \"optimize\" clinical therapeutic treatment effects, thus contributing to the advancement of science. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov, www.

A standardized 8-week MBSR training program was held for the experimental group weekly for 1.5 hours. The results showed that between the beginning and 8 weeks of MBSR therapeutic intervention, the level of depression in the elderly individuals significantly decreased (p < 0.001). However, significant improvements in changes in physical problems measured by PE-PSI were not found (p > 0.05).

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Conventional chemotherapy (CC) administered to patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) often causes adverse effects, such as cardiopulmonary dysfunction and immune system imbalance. Patients may experience anxiety and depression during the perioperative period due to various factors, such as treatment costs and cancer recurrence risks, thereby compromising the overall quality of life. Consequently, we hypothesized that integrating mindfulness-based stress reduction training (MSRT) with Jinshui Liujun decoction may mitigate negative emotions and promote recovery in patients with NSCLC. AIM: To explore the effects of MSRT and Jinshui Liujun decoction on the immune function and emotional state of NSCLC patients. METHODS: A retrospective clinical study was conducted involving 92 patients with stage IIIb-IV NSCLC; 35 patients in the control group (CG) received CC therapy (combination of pemetrexed and carboplatin), and 57 patients in the treatment group (TG) received MSRT-assisted flavored Jinshui Liujun decoction (FJLD) in addition to CC. We evaluated the survival time, Karnofsky performance status, treatment efficacy, traditional Chinese medicine syndrome score, immune function, negative emotional level, and adverse reactions of the CG and TG. RESULTS: Median progression-free survival, Karnofsky performance status, and clinical efficacy of the TG were superior to those of the CG (P < 0.05). Symptoms of cough, weakness, bloody sputum, shortness of breath, and chest pain significantly decreased in the TG compared to that in the CG (P < 0.05). In the TG, MSRT + FJLD treatment increased the numbers of CD3+ and CD4+ immune cells, effectively reduced the number of CD8+ cells, and enhanced the CD4+/CD8+ ratio, thereby restoring the immune function of patients. In the TG, the self-rating anxiety scale and self-rating depression scale scores decreased significantly. There was no statistically significant difference in the incidence of adverse reactions between the CG and TG (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: MSRT + FJLD proved to be an effective treatment for patients with NSCLC."

Delivering Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) sessions via chatbots may reduce depressive symptoms in university students. AIM: This study aims to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, safety, and preliminary efficacy of a chatbot-based MBSR intervention for university students with depressive symptoms. METHODS: A rule-based MBSR chatbot was developed and evaluated with a single-group pretest-posttest study for university students in Hong Kong (N = 30) reporting depressive symptoms, followed by the collection of their subjective feedback. The intervention lasted eight weeks. The primary clinical outcome was depression levels, with a range of secondary outcomes. RESULTS: The chatbot-based MBSR program demonstrated satisfying recruitment, retention, and adherence rates. The safety of the program was confirmed by the absence of any adverse events directly related to the intervention, tracked from the onset of the intervention to the completion of data assessment. Significant improvements were observed in both primary and secondary outcomes. Participant feedback highlighted the benefits of the program and its effects on depressive symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: The program has shown feasibility, acceptability, safety, and preliminary efficacy in reducing depressive symptoms among 30 university students in Hong Kong. The intervention should now be evaluated in a randomized controlled trial with follow-up. This study highlights the potential role of chatbot-based interventions in mental health promotion, nursing, and clinical practice and will inform the subsequent development of innovative digital interventions to address mental health challenges faced by university students."

      "abstract": "Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is characterized by overactivation of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) that leads to increased risk of cardiovascular disease. This study was conducted to evaluate the effects of a Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) programme on SNS activity in CKD patients. Participants with CKD stages III-IV were randomized to the 8 week MBSR programme or Health Enhancement Program (HEP; a structurally parallel, active control group). Intraneural measures of SNS activity directed to muscle [muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA)] via microneurography was recorded at rest and during stress manoeuvres (mental arithmetic, handgrip exercise and cold pressor test). Data analyses were performed based on the intent-to-treat principle. In total, 29 participants (64 ± 9 years; 86% males) completed the intervention with 17 in the MBSR and 12 in the HEP groups. There was a significant Group (MBSR vs. HEP) by Time (baseline vs. post-intervention) interaction in MSNA reactivity to mental stress (P = 0.029), with a significant reduction in the mean ∆MSNA over 3 min of mental arithmetic at post-intervention (10.3 ± 4.2-5.9 ± 5.6 bursts/min, P < 0.001; Hedges' g = -0.858, 95% confidence interval [-1.578, -0.167]), while no change was observed within the HEP group (P = 0.818). Reduced ∆MSNA during handgrip exercise was also observed, while ∆MSNA during the cold pressor test and resting MSNA remained unchanged in both groups from baseline to post-intervention. In this randomized controlled trial, patients with CKD had a reduction of sympathetic reactivity during mental stress and static handgrip exercise following 8 weeks of MBSR but not after HEP. Our findings demonstrate that mindfulness training is feasible and may have clinically beneficial effects on autonomic function in CKD. KEY POINTS: Question: Does the Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) programme reduce sympathetic activity in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD)? Finding: In this randomized controlled trial including 29 patients with CKD, 8 weeks of MBSR decreased sympathetic reactivity to mental stress compared to the control Health Enhancement Program (HEP). Meaning: These finding suggest that mindfulness training may have clinically beneficial effects on autonomic function in CKD.",

PURPOSE: This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of blended MBSR on perceived stress, anxiety, and depressive symptoms, while also exploring the potential mechanisms underlying its effects on improving diabetes self-management. METHODS: One hundred individuals with T2DM were recruited and randomly assigned to two groups (50 participants each) from March 2020 to July 2020. A randomized clinical trial, combined with generalized estimating equations for repeated measures, was employed to assess the intervention effects of the blended MBSR on perceived stress, anxiety, and depressive symptoms compared to standard care. Mediation analyses using Model 4 in SPSS PROCESS were conducted to evaluate the contributions of the blended MBSR to diabetes self-management. RESULTS: Participants in the blended MBSR group showed a significant reduction in perceived stress, anxiety, and depressive symptoms compared to the control group over 12 weeks. Bootstrap mediation analyses indicated that changes in perceived stress and anxiety fully mediated the effect of the blended MBSR on diabetes self-efficacy. In contrast, depressive symptoms were not associated with diabetes self-efficacy and therefore did not qualify as mediators. Additionally, diabetes distress was found to be an insignificant mediator. Furthermore, changes in diabetes self-efficacy served as a partial mediator of the positive effects of the blended MBSR on diabetes self-management. CONCLUSIONS: The blended MBSR program effectively reduced perceived stress, anxiety, and depressive symptoms in individuals with T2DM. The intervention's impact on perceived stress and anxiety contributed to an increase in diabetes self-efficacy, subsequently enhancing diabetes self-management. Interventions that aim to reduce perceived stress and anxiety, while also increasing diabetes self-efficacy, are recommended to develop diabetes self-management strategies with clearly defined mechanistic pathways.",

In the Self-Compassion Scale: self-kindness (p = .029; η2p = .049), mindfulness (p = .033; η2p = .047), self-judgment (p = .016; η2p = .060) and isolation (p = .025; η2p = .051. And finally, in the Body awareness subscale from Self-Body Connection (p = .044; η2p = .042). These results highlight the importance of providing hospital staff with skills that help them connect in the present with their feelings and thoughts, without judgment and with self-compassion, to protect them from suffering an increase in their symptoms of somatization, anxiety, and depression, in adverse times like a pandemic.",

The present study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of the combination of MBSR and PA interventions as an augmentation to treatment as usual with sertraline to improve sleep and psychological factors among patients with MDD. Sixty-seven patients in outpatient care diagnosed with MDD for a minimum of 2 months (mean age: 35.32 ± 7.8; 65 % female) and currently on sertraline treatments were randomized into four groups including: 1) Physical activity, 2) MBSR, 3) Combination MBSR and physical activity (MBSRPA), and 4) Control. All participants completed self-reported questionnaires on sleep quality, depression, anxiety, and perceived stress from baseline to 8 weeks later at post-test and four weeks later at follow-up. Over time, sleep disturbance and psychological problems were reduced in all conditions when compared to the control. Moreover, MBSRPA had a more positive impacts on perceived stress, anxiety, depressive symptoms and sleep quality. The results of the present study confirmed the effectiveness of MBSRPA as an augmentation to standard therapy to help reduce symptoms of depression, anxiety, perceived stress, and sleep problems in patients with MDD.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Well-developed rehabilitation paradigms exist for post-stroke language and motor impairments. However, no such recovery program has been identified for commonly disabling cognitive deficits in patients following minor stroke. Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) is thought to engage the frontal lobes, improving concentration and attention, and therefore may be an effective option. METHODS: We prospectively enrolled a cohort of patients with subacute minor stroke and randomized them to either an 8-week online modified-MBSR course or online traditional Stroke Support Group (SSG). All patients underwent a battery of cognitive tests and measures of patient reported outcomes (PROs) pre- and post-intervention. ANOVA was used to compare changes in scores over time across both groups, as well as a third group of control patients having received neither intervention (n=128). RESULTS: A total of 30 patients were randomized (n=16 for m-MBSR; n=14 for SSG). The average age of the cohort was 65.9 years. Both groups scored similarly on assessments one-month post-stroke and demonstrated increased T-scores on cognitive tasks at the 3-month visit. However, the m-MBSR group showed moderately elevated levels of improvement, specifically in processing speed, executive, and global cognitive function. Level of engagement was not associated with better clinical scores, though was unexpectedly low for both groups. CONCLUSIONS: m-MBSR appears to modestly improve frontal lobe activity and demonstrates some success in increasing cognitive performance. However, further studies are needed to determine if it is more efficacious in the chronic stage of recovery when more patients are able to fully engage and actively participate."

The goal is to reduce stress and improve job satisfaction, ultimately enhancing patient care. These findings may inspire the development of mindfulness-based support systems for healthcare professionals to promote overall well-being in the workplace. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A single-blinded, randomized controlled trial with 60 emergency medical center nurses was conducted to assess the effectiveness of an eight-session MBSR program in reducing stress and burnout. The randomization process, utilizing sealed envelopes, ensured unbiased allocation to intervention or control groups. The training program included group sessions focused on meditation, yoga, and discussions, with participants receiving educational materials and CDs for home practice. Collected data included demographics, Maslach Burnout Inventory, and Occupational Stress Questionnaire results. Statistical analysis, utilizing SPSS version 21, featured Kolmogorov-Smirnov, Mann-Whitney U, and Wilcoxon tests to evaluate outcomes. RESULTS: Following MBSR Training, the intervention group displayed statistically significant differences in all occupational stress subscales compared to the control group (P < 0.05). Post-intervention, the intervention group also exhibited significant differences in burnout subscale scores (P < 0.001) compared to the control group. CONCLUSION: MBSR can boost resilience and job satisfaction, enhancing patient care. Healthcare organizations should integrate MBSR programs for nursing staff well-being and combat stress and burnout. Research should probe long-term impacts and effective delivery methods for sustained stress relief in nursing.

Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) has in previous research shown positive effects on mental health. However, research evaluating MBSR for young adults with mental disorders is insufficient and qualitative research exploring experiences of the programme is scarce. The aim of this study was to explore experiences of MBSR as a supplementary treatment in psychiatric outpatient care among young adults with moderate to severe mental disorders, from a short- and long-term perspective. METHOD: Eleven young adults (aged 18-27 years) who had participated in an MBSR programme were interviewed approximately three months or two years later. The analytic method was Grounded Theory. RESULTS: The analysis resulted in a theoretical model including one core category and five categories. The model illustrated a learning process, explaining the participants' short- and long-term experiences of learning to pay attention to the body, regulate emotions, a change of attitude towards oneself, and still using skills two years after the programme. DISCUSSION: The MBSR programme was experienced as a learning process which improved the longstanding ability to cope with emotional stress in daily life. Tailoring MBSR to individual needs may further enhance its effectiveness. CONCLUSION: The experienced short- and long-term health-promotion benefits of an MBSR programme among young adults with mental disorders support its implementation in psychiatric and primary health care. Future research should investigate how to optimise implementation and tailor to individual needs.",

The aim of the study was to examine the feasibility and effectiveness of the mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) program on relieving burnout of healthcare providers during the pandemic. The roles of positive and negative emotion as well as emotion regulation strategy in the intervention effects were also investigated. METHODS: A sample of 112 healthcare providers in China were recruited and randomly assigned to the MBSR (n = 56) or the control condition (n = 56). Measures were collected at pre-intervention, mid-intervention, and post-intervention, assessing mindfulness level, emotion regulation strategy, positive and negative emotion, and burnout. RESULTS: The MBSR program showed acceptable feasibility. Compared to the control group, healthcare providers in the MBSR group showed significant increase in personal accomplishment and decrease in emotional exhaustion after the intervention. No significant difference was detected on the dimension of depersonalization. Results of mediation analyses implied that cognitive reappraisal and positive affect partially mediated the intervention effects on personal accomplishment. CONCLUSIONS: The study provided preliminary evidence that the MBSR programs might be effective in reducing healthcare providers' burnout, even during the pandemic. Cognitive reappraisal and positive emotion might be important mechanisms of how the training took effect.",

One approach to addressing stress reduction is mindfulness training. MBSR has been verified to improve the health status of different individuals. The aim of this study was to examine whether MBSR improves the psychological resilience, posttraumatic stress and posttraumatic growth of medical students in military college. METHODS: MBSR was performed with students from a military medical university. A total of 372 students were surveyed by questionnaires, including the 10-item of Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale, Posttraumatic Growth Inventory, PTSD Checklist for DSM-5, Satisfaction with Life Scale, and Mindful Attention Awareness Scale, before the intervention, after the intervention and one month later. A control group of students also answered the questionnaires at the three time points but did not participate in the MBSR intervention. Statistical analyses were performed using repeated-measures ANOVA. RESULTS: The results suggest that the MBSR group experienced significant improvements in resilience, posttraumatic growth, life satisfaction, and mindful attention awareness scores, as well as significant reductions in depression, anxiety, and PTSD intrusive symptoms scores after the intervention. These results were not found in the control group. One month after the intervention, all of these variables showed varying degrees of maintenance effects in the MBSR group. CONCLUSION: The MBSR intervention was effective, as the medical students in military college in the MBSR group exhibited improvements in psychological resilience, posttraumatic growth, satisfaction with life and mindful attention awareness, depression, anxiety and intrusive symptoms.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) intervention has been widely used to reduce the burden of symptoms in cancer patients, and its effectiveness has been proven. However, the effectiveness of MBSR on depression, anxiety, fatigue, quality of life (QOL), posttraumatic growth (PTG), fear of cancer recurrence (FCR), pain, and sleep in breast cancer patients has not yet been determined. This study aims to determine the role of mindfulness-based stress reduction therapy in patients with breast cancer. OBJECTIVES: The objective was to systematically review the literature to explore the effect of MBSR on anxiety, depression, QOL, PTG, fatigue, FCR, pain, stress and sleep in breast cancer patients. To explore the effect of 8-week versus 6-week MBSR on the 9 indicators. Data were extracted from the original RCT study at the end of the intervention and three months after baseline to explore whether the effects of the intervention were sustained. METHODS: We conducted searches on PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure from inception to November 2023. Eligible studies included randomized controlled trials of breast cancer patients who received mindfulness stress reduction intervention, reporting outcomes for anxiety, depression, fatigue, QOL, PTG, FCR, pain, stress, and sleep. Two researchers conducted separate reviews of the abstract and full text, extracted data, and independently evaluated the risk of bias using the Cochrane 'Bias Risk Assessment tool'. The meta-analysis utilized Review Manager 5.4 to conduct the study, and the effect size was determined using the standardized mean difference and its corresponding 95% confidence interval. RESULTS: The final analysis included 15 studies with a total of 1937 patients. At the end of the intervention, the interventions with a duration of eight weeks led to a significant reduction in anxiety [SMD=-0.60, 95% CI (-0.78, -0.43), P < 0.00001, I2 = 31%], depression [SMD=-0.39, 95% CI (-0.59, -0.19), P = 0.0001, I2 = 55%], and QOL [542 participants, SMD = 0.54, 95% CI (0.30, 0.79), P < 0.0001, I2 = 49%], whereas no statistically significant effects were found in the intervention with a duration of six weeks. Similarly, in 3 months after baseline, the interventions with a duration of eight weeks led to a significant reduction in depression and QOL, however, no statistically significant effects were found at the 6-week intervention. MBSR led to a significant improvement in PTG at end of intervention [MD = 6.25, 95% CI (4.26, 8.25), P < 0.00001, I2 = 0%] and PTG 3 months after baseline. We found that MBSR reduced the fatigue status at end of intervention, but had no significant effect on fatigue status 3 months after baseline. There was no significant difference in improving pain, stress, and FCR compared to usual care. CONCLUSIONS: In terms of effects on QOL, anxiety, depression, and fatigue, the 8-week MBSR intervention showed better results than the 6-week MBSR intervention. The intervention of MBSR on PTG was effective, and the effect lasted until 3 months after baseline. Future studies could further identify the most effective intervention components in MBSR.

Over years, the Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) has been evaluated as an effective intervention to promote well-being in breast cancer survivors. The present study protocol aims to evaluate the effectiveness of a MBSR intervention in regulating interoceptive sensations, as the ability to be aware of inner sensations. Second, it seeks to identify changes in interoceptive feelings, mood, and body perception following the intervention. These changes will be evaluated across three data collection times to assess differences about emotions and body perception over time, focusing on their relevance for breast cancer survivors' well-being. Finally, the present study protocol aims to detect improvements in anxiety, depression, and body awareness, considering the potential positive impact of the MBSR approach on emotional well-being. Direction for future psychological intervention are given."

Moreover, MBSR is increasingly being used in cancer-related fatigue (CRF) intervention studies for breast cancer patients, but conflicting results also exist. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the effect of MBSR on CRF in patients with breast cancer. METHODS: A comprehensive computer search of the Pubmed, Cochrane Library, Embase, Web of Science, China Biomedical Document Service System, China Knowledge Infrastructure Engineering, Wanfang Data Knowledge Service Platform, and VIP databases was performed. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published before April 10, 2023, were identified. The primary outcome was cancer-related fatigue associated with breast cancer. Two researchers independently screened the studies, extracted the data, and evaluated the methodological quality of the studies according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The Meta-analysis of the outcome indicators was performed using STATA 16.0 software. RESULTS: A total of 13 studies were included, including 1992 patients (997 patients in the MBSR group and 1015 patients in the control group). Compared with conventional care, MBSR significantly alleviated the symptoms of CRF in breast cancer patients (SMD=-0.32, 95% CI [-0.42, -0.22], z=6.54, p<.01). Under the supervision of experts, the 8-week MBSR had a great influence on CRF, especially in the Asian population. CONCLUSIONS: MBSR is effective in the treatment of CRF induced by breast cancer, and no obvious adverse effects occur; thus, MBSR can be recommended as a beneficial adjuvant therapy for treating CRF in breast cancer patients.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Genetics may influence symptoms experienced by breast cancer survivors (BCS) by moderating the effects of stress-reducing interventions, including the Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR(BC)) program, to reduce symptom severity. As part of a larger clinical trial, the aim of this study was to evaluate genetic variants as moderators of MBSR(BC) on improvements among BCS in cognitive functioning and symptoms. METHODS: BCS (n = 128) were randomized to MBSR(BC) or the Breast Cancer Education Support Program. Objective neuropsychological and subjective measures of cognitive performance, and psychological and physical symptoms were collected at baseline, 6, 12, and 26 weeks. Linear mixed models were implemented to identify MBSR(BC)'s effects over time. A total of 22 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from 20 genes known to be related to these symptoms were investigated using genomic DNA. These SNPs were tested as moderators of MBSR(BC) program effects. RESULTS: Results showed MBSR(BC) participants experienced significantly greater benefits in cognitive functioning, however, the level of benefit varied based on one's genetic profile. Effects sizes, consistency across similar measures were investigated. Among 22 candidate SNPs, rs4680 in COMT, rs1800497 in ANKK1, and rs6277 in DRD2 demonstrated the strongest, most consistent positive effects in moderating MBSR(BC)'s impact on cognitive outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Although the effects were small, this translational research may potentially identify BCS with genotypes that would be most influenced by the MBSR(BC) program. These results may be used to develop personalized intervention programs tailored to the genetic profile of each breast cancer survivor who received chemotherapy or chemotherapy and radiation.

This study aimed to evaluate the impact of Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) on pediatric oncology nurses' stress levels, as well as the psychosocial symptoms and care satisfaction of pediatric oncology patients. A non-randomized prospective study with a pretest-posttest design was conducted, involving 112 children and 8 pediatric oncology nurses between November 2021 and August 2022. The study was conducted in 3 stages. First, the children's nursing care satisfaction and psychosocial symptoms were evaluated during the first 3 months before the MBSR intervention. Second, the nurses participated in the MBSR program for 2 months. Third, the children's nursing care satisfaction and psychosocial symptoms were assessed again 3 months after the MBSR intervention. The results showed that children who received nursing care post-MBSR had lower scores in the Psychosocial, Hopelessness, and Communication Difficulty subscales compared to those who received care pre-MBSR. Additionally, these children had higher scores in Evaluation of Quality of Care from the Children's Point of View, Psychosocial, Physical, and Information subscales. There was a significant reduction in the stress levels of nurses between the pre-MBSR and post-MBSR assessments. MBSR is an effective method for reducing pediatric oncology nurses' perceived stress levels and should be utilized to support both pediatric oncology nurses and patients in enhancing their psychosocial functioning."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The persistent destructive power of cancer-related fatigue (CRF) has been regarded as the biggest influencing factor affecting the postoperative physical and mental health of patients with cervical cancer. During this process, patients might also experience different feelings of disease-related psychological. Therefore, this study aimed to adopt mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) to intervene in patients with cervical cancer, and conducted follow-up for 3 and 6 months to observe the effects of changes in CRF, uncertainty in illness, coping styles, sense of coherence (SOC), and perceived social support (PSS). METHODS: A randomized controlled trial was conducted in ShengJing Hospital of China Medical University. A total of 102 patients were selected, and 78 patients completed the whole process, including 40 in the experimental group and 38 in the control group. Data were collected according to Cancer Fatigue Scale, Medical Coping Modes Questionnaire, Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support, and Sense of Coherence-13. The change trend and difference of the two groups of research data were compared by repeated measurement analysis of variance. Bonferroni test was used for multiple tests between groups. RESULTS: The CRF, SOC, and coping styles of the MBSR group showed a decreasing trend (P < 0.001) at after MBSR, 3 months follow-up, and 6 months follow-up compared to the before MBSR. However, the uncertainty in illness of the MBSR group showed a decreasing trend (P < 0.001) at after MBSR compared to the before MBSR, and it rose in 3 months follow-up and 6 months follow-up. CONCLUSION: MBSR can effectively alleviate the fatigue of CRF after treatment, while improving their psychological environment. Medical workers can consider implementing online MBSR for patients with cervical cancer in their daily rehabilitation nursing, which is beneficial for their recovery.

      "abstract": "Introduction: The Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) Program for breast cancer survivors (BCS) is designed to enhance cognitive training through formal and informal meditational practices. This randomized clinical trial (RCT) aimed to evaluate if BCS assigned to either the MBSR(BC), Breast Cancer Education Support (BCES), or Usual Care (UC) regimens experienced greater improvements at 6, 12, and 26 weeks on objective and subjective cognitive performance. Methods: BCS (n = 212) randomized to a three-group RCT: MBSR(BC) (n = 91), BCES (n = 90), or UC (n = 31) were assessed on cognitive performance and symptoms at baseline, 6, 12, and 26 weeks. Linear mixed models were fit to evaluate the effects of the MBSR(BC) program, hypothesizing ordered effect improvements: (MBSR[BC] highest, BCES intermediate, UC lowest) along with baseline characteristics evaluated as moderators. Results: Of the BCS (mean age of 57), 73% were White, and non-Hispanic, and 77% received both chemotherapy (CT) and radiation. Cognitive performance improved in all groups. Although there were no statistically significant between-group differences in cognitive outcomes, significant symptom reductions occurred for the MBSR(BC) group (p = 0.003). Within-group effect size analysis at 26 weeks showed substantial improvements in all three groups (effect sizes >0.50) in subjective impairments and quality of life (effect size >0.50) and objective measures of cognitive performance. MBSR(BC) showed the largest within-group effect size in the reduction of fatigue (effect size = 0.81). Effect sizes occurred in the hypothesized direction for 10 of the 18 outcomes. Discussion: Although the MBSR(BC) program did not show significant differences in cognitive performance compared with BCES and UC, all groups improved and reductions in fatigue were beneficial for MBSR(BC). Results suggest that cognitive performance may improve after CT over time considering one's natural history. Furthermore, BCS enrolled in RCTs may be more motivated to improve their health status (NCT02786797).",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Depression and anxiety are prevalent after stroke and associated with poor outcomes. We previously co-developed a stroke-specific self-management intervention, HEADS: UP (Helping Ease Anxiety and Depression after Stroke). The two studies reported here aimed to test the feasibility and acceptability of the HEADS: UP course and supporting materials, and research processes ahead of a definitive trial. METHODS: We recruited community-dwelling stroke survivors (SS) ≥ 3 months post-stroke, with symptoms of mood disorder (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale ≥ 8). Participants could 'enrol' a family member/ 'other' to take part with them, if desired. Study 1 tested HEADS: UP delivered in-person, and informed optimisation of research processes and intervention delivery and materials. In a pragmatic response to Covid-related socialising restrictions, HEADS: UP was then adapted for online delivery, tested in Study 2. The primary outcome (both studies) was the feasibility (acceptability, fidelity) of the intervention and of research processes. Quantitative data (including patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) assessing mood and quality of life) and qualitative data were collected pre-/post-intervention. Descriptive statistics were used to analyse quantitative data; a thematic framework approach was used to analyse qualitative data. Both studies received ethical approval prior to commencement. RESULTS: Study 1 Feasibility: 13 (59.1%) of 22 potentially eligible stroke survivors consented; aged 66 (median, interquartile range (IQR) 14); male (n = 9; 69%); 28 (IQR 34) months post-stroke. Of these, n = 10 (76.9%) completed PROMS pre-intervention; n = 6 (46.2%) post-intervention. Acceptability: Nine (69.2%) of the 13 participants attended ≥ 4 core intervention sessions. Aspects of screening and data collection were found to be burdensome. Study 2 Feasibility: SS n = 9 (41%) of 22 potentially eligible stroke survivors consented; aged 58 years (median; IQR 12); male (n = 4; 44.4%); 23 (IQR 34) months post-stroke. Of these, n = 5 (55.6%) completed PROMS pre-intervention; n = 5 (55.6%) post-intervention. Acceptability: Five (55.6%) of the 9 participants attended ≥ 4 core sessions. They found online screening and data collection processes straightforward."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To explore the influence of mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) training on the negative emotions and social functioning of patients with laryngeal cancer post-operation. METHODS: Sixty-five patients with laryngeal cancer admitted to our hospital from January 2017 to December 2019 were selected and divided into an observation group of 33 cases and a control group of 32 cases according to the patient's wishes. The control group received routine intervention, while the observation group received mindfulness decompression training in addition to the control group. Both groups were evaluated after 8 weeks of intervention. The research tools included the self-rating anxiety scale (SAS), self-rating depression scale (SDS), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Social Disability Screening Schedule (SDSS), Social Support Rating Scale (SSRS), and European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (QLQ-C30), all of the scores of them were used to verify the foregoing scale. The effects of MBSR were evaluated by the differences between the post- and pre-intervention scores in each scale. T-test was used for mean comparison and Pearson test was used for rate comparison χ2 inspection. LITERATURE REVIEW: Patients will have negative emotions during the surgical treatment of laryngeal malignancies (Literature 1), which will affect their mental health (literature 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7). Mindfulness decompression training (literature 10, 11) can reduce the depression and anxiety of patients with malignant tumors (literature 14, 15). According to the inclusion criteria and exclusion criteria (literature 16 and 17), two groups of patients were selected in this study, and the scores were obtained using research tools including SAS (literature 19), SDS (literature 20), PSQI (literature 21), SDSS (literature 22) and QLQ-C30 (literature 24 and 25). The effect of MBSR was evaluated by the difference before and after the intervention scores in each scale. RESULTS: After the intervention, the scores of the SAS and SDS in the two groups were lower than before (P < 0.05), the PSQI score of the two groups was lower than before (P < 0.05), the SDSS score of the two groups was lower than before (P < 0.05), and the scores of the QLQ-C30 in the two groups were higher than before intervention (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Mindfulness-based stress reduction training can reduce the negative emotions of patients with laryngeal cancer and improve their quality of sleep, social functioning, and quality of life. It is worthy of clinical application.",

However, many patients undergoing PCI for coronary heart disease often experience negative emotions such as depression and anxiety, as well as sleep disturbances, poor adherence to medications, and somatic symptoms. These adverse psychological effects can contribute to an increased risk of cardiovascular events. Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR), a highly effective mind-body therapy, has been increasingly utilized in the recovery process of patients with coronary heart disease. Several scholars have conducted mindfulness interventions for post-PCI patients with coronary heart disease and achieved promising outcomes.

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: This research was conducted to determine the effects of acupressure, laughter yoga, and a mindfulness-based stress reduction program applied to postmenopausal women for menopause symptoms and quality of life. METHODS: A randomized controlled design was used. The study was conducted with a total of 146 women, including 41 acupressure, 31 laughter yoga, 37 mindfulness-based stress reduction, and 37 control group women. The women in the acupressure group were administered acupressure twice a week, which accounted for 16 sessions in total. Women in the laughter yoga and mindfulness-based stress reduction groups received a total of eight sessions of the related intervention, which was performed once a week. Study data were collected using a participant information form, the Menopause Rating Scale (MRS), and the Menopause-Specific Quality of Life Scale (MENQOL). Descriptive statistics, paired-samples t test, χ 2 test, analysis of variance test, and intention to treat analysis were used to analyze the data. Before the intention to treat analysis was performed, the multiple imputation method was employed to deal with missing data. RESULTS: In the study, it was found that there was a decrease in the MRS total score after the intervention in women in all three intervention groups compared to the control group ( P < 0.05). In the laughter yoga group, total MRS scores decreased by 3.16 points ( P < 0.05). In the acupressure group, total MRS scores decreased by 5.46 points ( P < 0.05). In the mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) program group, total MRS scores decreased by 4.65 points ( P < 0.05). It was determined that the mean scores of women in the laughter yoga and acupressure groups on all subscales of the MENQOL decreased after the intervention compared to the control group ( P < 0.05). The comparison of the MBSR group and the control group showed that there was a decrease only in the psychosocial domain subdimension of the MENQOL ( P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, it was determined that laughter yoga, acupressure, and MBSR could be effective in reducing menopause symptoms and improving quality of life, although findings require further testing in a rigorously controlled study and in a study with only a single prespecified outcome.",

Evidence supporting this notion is largely based on findings showing significant associations between treatment mechanism variables and outcomes. An alternative view is that treatments may work by reducing or decoupling the impact of changes in mechanism variables on changes in outcomes. We examined the degree to which relationships between previous changes in potential treatment mechanisms and subsequent changes in outcomes changed as treatment progressed and vice versa. Cognitive therapy, MBSR, BT, and treatment as usual (TAU) were compared in people with chronic low back pain (N = 521). Eight individual sessions were administered with weekly assessments of putative treatment mechanisms and outcomes. Lagged analyses revealed mechanism × session number interactions and outcome × session number interactions, such that associations between mechanism and outcome variables were strong and significant in the first third of treatment, but weakened over time and became nonsignificant by the last third of treatment. These effects were similar across treatment conditions but did not emerge among people undergoing TAU. Results suggest that during the course of CT, MBSR, and BT, the links between changes in treatment mechanism variables became decoupled from subsequent changes in outcomes and vice versa. Thus, starting by midtreatment and continuing into late treatment, participants may have learned through participation in the treatments that episodes of maladaptive pain-related thoughts and/or spikes in pain need not have detrimental consequences on their subsequent experience.",

      "abstract": "Breast Cancer Associated Susceptibility Proteins Type 1/2 (BRCA1/2) promote cellular functioning by modulating NRF2-mediated antioxidant signaling. Redox failure in women with BRCA1/2 insufficiency increases the risk for breast/ovarian/uterine cancers. Risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy (RRSO) is a prophylactic surgery of the reproductive organs, which is frequently conducted by the age of 40 to lower the occurrence of cancer in women with BRCA1/2 mutations. However, abrupt estrogen decline following RRSO causes ovarian failure, which implicates various cellular physiological processes, resulting in the increased release of free radicals and subsequent severe onset of menopausal symptoms. Comfort measures (e.g., hormonal replacement therapy (HRT) and mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR)) may improve chronological menopause-related quality of life, but their specific effects are not clear in women with gene mutations. Aiming to fill the gap, this study used path analysis to examine the effects of HRT and MBSR on menopausal symptoms among RRSO patients (N = 199, mean age = 50.5 ± 6.7 years). HRT directly alleviated the levels of urogenital symptoms (β = -0.195, p = 0.005), which mediated its indirect significant effects on the somatic-vegetative and psychological symptoms of menopause (β = -0.046, -0.067; both p values = 0.004, respectively), especially in BRCA2 carriers and in women who were currently physically active, premenopausal at the time of RRSO, had a high BMI, and had no history of breast cancer. It increased the severity of urogenital symptoms in women with a history of cancer. MBSR, on the other hand, was associated with indirect increases in the intensity of the somatic-vegetative and psychological symptoms of menopause (β = 0.108, 0.029; p = 0.003, 0.033, respectively). It exerted positive direct effects on different menopausal symptoms in multigroup analysis. The results suggest that young women undergoing recent RRSO may benefit from HRT at an individual level, while their need for extensive measures to optimize their psychological wellbeing is ongoing. The adverse effects of MBSR, which are captured in the present study, imply that MBSR may interfere with redox sensitivity associated with estradiol fluctuations in BRCA1/2 carriers. Investigations are needed to test this hypothesis and elaborate on the underlying mechanisms in these women."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: This study examines the effects of a Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) program on psychological measures and attentional patterns to pain stimuli, using eye-tracking methods, in individuals with chronic pain. METHOD: Thirty-two participants with chronic pain and no prior mindfulness experience were randomly assigned to an experimental group or a waiting list group. Both groups completed self-report measures of symptoms, well-being, and an attentional disengagement task using emotional faces as stimuli. Assessments were conducted at two points: before and after the intervention for the experimental group, with the waiting list group serving as a control. RESULTS: Before the MBSR program, chronic pain participants exhibited significant attentional biases towards pain-related stimuli during early attentional stages. Following the program, significant improvements were observed in depression, anxiety, stress, pain acceptance, overall well-being, and life satisfaction. However, it had a limited impact on attentional patterns, with only a significant increase in gaze duration across all stimuli. DISCUSSION: Despite the MBSR program's success in reducing symptoms associated with chronic pain, the lack of broader attentional improvements raises questions about the mechanisms responsible for psychological improvements. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: This study pioneers the use of eye-tracking to examine how MBSR influences attention in chronic back pain. While the program improved psychological well-being, it did not generally alter attentional patterns, except for an increased ability to maintain attention across stimuli. We discuss whether this attentional change could be associated with the increased acceptance observed in the MBSR program.",

METHOD: A total of 104 patients with SCI (diagnosed via imaging and clinical symptoms) admitted to our hospital between January 2020 and December 2022 were selected as the study participants. The patients were randomly divided into two groups: the MBSR (observation) group and the control group. The observation group received MBSR therapy and routine nursing, and the control group received music training therapy and routine nursing. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) was used to evaluate sleep quality, and the perceived stress score was used to evaluate stress experienced by the patients at three timepoints: before intervention, 4 weeks and 8weeks after intervention. RESULTS: Compared with before intervention, the PSQI scores of both the control group and intervention group participants significantly decreased after intervention(P < 0.01). Compared with the 4 weeks after intervention, the PSQI scores of both groups of participants decreased in the 8 weeks after intervention(P < 0.01). There was a significant difference in PSQI scores between the two groups of participants at 4 and 8 weeks after intervention(P < 0.01). Compared with before intervention, the average perceived stress score of both the control group and intervention group participants significantly decreased after intervention(P < 0.05). Compared with the 4 weeks after intervention, the average perceived stress score of both groups of participants decreased in the 8 weeks after intervention(P < 0.01). There was a significant difference in average perceived stress score between the two groups of participants at 4(P < 0.05) and 8 weeks(P < 0.01) after intervention(P < 0.01).

Additionally, the study aimed to identify the barriers and facilitators in maintaining mindfulness practice over time and the preferred mindfulness practices among participants in three distinct time groups. METHODS: The study utilized a qualitative research design, conducting semi-structured interviews with 45 participants who had completed the 8-week MBSR program at different time points. Thematic analysis was employed to analyze the qualitative data obtained from the interviews, allowing for the identification of key themes and patterns. RESULTS: The findings revealed that the effectiveness of the MBSR program varied at different times and across different variables. Immediately after completing the program, participants experienced a significant decrease in stress levels and an increase in awareness. One year later, the program continued to have positive effects on inner calm, coping mechanisms, and relationships. Three years after completing the program, its long-term impact was observed in the adoption of a mindful lifestyle, increased compassion and kindness, and ongoing personal growth. DISCUSSION: The study highlights the transformative potential of the MBSR program beyond short-term symptom relief. The long-term effects observed in overall wellbeing emphasize the sustained efficacy of mindfulness-based interventions. The identified barriers and facilitators in maintaining mindfulness practice provide insights for program implementation and individual engagement. By understanding the long-term impact and preferences of participants, tailored interventions can be developed to maximize the benefits of the MBSR program for individuals over time."

METHODS: This was a secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial (2017-2020), including 1,221 singleton pregnancies at high risk for small-for-gestational age. Participants were randomized into three groups at 19-23 weeks' gestation: Mediterranean diet intervention, stress reduction program, or usual care. A detailed neurosonography was performed on 881 participants at mean (SD) 33.4 (1.1) weeks' gestation. Neurosonographic measurements were done offline. ASQ was performed on 276 infants at 1 year of corrected age. RESULTS: Biparietal diameter was similar among study groups. Mediterranean diet group fetuses had deeper insula (26.80 [1.68] versus 26.63 [1.75], mm, p = 0.02) and longer corpus callosum (42.98 [2.44] versus 42.62 [2.27], mm, p = 0.04), with a lower rate of suboptimal score infants in ASQ problem-solving domain (6.2 vs. 16.3%, p = 0.03). Stress reduction group fetuses had deeper insula (26.90 [1.75] versus 26.63 [1.75], mm, p = 0.04) and lower rates of suboptimal score infants in ASQ fine motor domain (4.3 vs. 12.8%, p = 0.04), compared to usual care group fetuses.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Insomnia is a highly prevalent sleep disorder frequently comorbid with mental health conditions in nurses. Despite the effectiveness of evidence-based cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I), there is a critical need for alternative approaches. This study investigated whether internet-delivered mindfulness-based stress reduction (IMBSR) for insomnia could be an alternative to internet-delivered CBT-I (ICBT-I). OBJECTIVE: The hypothesis was that the IMBSR would be noninferior to the ICBT-I in reducing the severity of insomnia among nurses with insomnia. Additionally, it was expected that ICBT-I would produce a greater reduction in the severity of insomnia and depression than IMBSR. METHOD: Among 240 screened nurses, 134 with insomnia were randomly allocated (IMBSR, n = 67; ICBT-I, n = 67). The assessment protocol comprised clinical interviews and self-reported outcome measures, including the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), the 15-item Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ), and the Client Satisfaction Questionnaire (CSQ-I). RESULTS: The retention rate was 55% with 77.6% (n = 104) of participants completing the study. At post-intervention, the noninferiority analysis of the ISI score showed that the upper limit of the 95% confidence interval was 4.88 (P = 0.46), surpassing the pre-specified noninferiority margin of 4 points. Analysis of covariance revealed that the ICBT-I group had significantly lower ISI (Cohen's d = 1.37) and PHQ-9 (Cohen's d = 0.71) scores than did the IMBSR group. In contrast, the IMBSR group showed a statistically significant increase in the FFMQ-15 score (Cohen's d = 0.67). Within-group differences showed that both the IMBSR and ICBT-I were effective at reducing insomnia severity and depression severity and improving mindfulness. CONCLUSION: Overall, nurses demonstrated high levels of satisfaction and adherence to both interventions. The IMBSR significantly reduced insomnia severity and depression, but the findings of this study do not provide strong evidence that the IMBSR is at least as effective as the ICBT-I in reducing insomnia symptoms among nurses with insomnia. The ICBT-I was found to be significantly superior to the IMBSR in reducing insomnia severity, making it a recommended treatment option for nurses with insomnia.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The IMPACT BCN trial-a parallel-group randomized clinical trial where 1221 pregnant women at high risk for small-for-gestational age (SGA) newborns were randomly allocated at 19- to 23-week gestation into three groups: Mediterranean diet, Mindfulness-based Stress reduction or non-intervention-has demonstrated a positive effect of Mediterranean diet and Stress reduction in the prevention of SGA. However, the mechanism of action of these interventions remains still unclear. The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of Mediterranean diet and Stress reduction on placental volume and perfusion. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Participants in the Mediterranean diet group received monthly individual and group educational sessions, and free provision of extra-virgin olive oil and walnuts. Women in the Stress reduction group underwent an 8-week Stress reduction program adapted for pregnancy, consisting of weekly 2.5-h and one full-day sessions. Non-intervention group was based on usual care. Placental volume and perfusion were assessed in a subgroup of randomly selected women (n = 165) using magnetic resonance (MR) at 36-week gestation. Small placental volume was defined as MR estimated volume <10th centile. Perfusion was assessed by intravoxel incoherent motion. RESULTS: While mean MR placental volume was similar among the study groups, both interventions were associated with a lower prevalence of small placental volume (3.9% Mediterranean diet and 5% stress reduction vs. 17% non-intervention; p = 0.03 and p = 0.04, respectively). Logistic regression showed that small placental volume was significantly associated with higher risk of SGA in both study groups (OR 7.48 [1.99-28.09] in Mediterranean diet and 20.44 [5.13-81.4] in Stress reduction). Mediation analysis showed that the effect of Mediterranean diet on SGA can be decomposed by a direct effect and an indirect effect (56.6%) mediated by a small placental volume. Similarly, the effect of Stress reduction on SGA is partially mediated (45.3%) by a small placental volume. Results on placental intravoxel incoherent motion perfusion fraction and diffusion coefficient were similar among the study groups. CONCLUSIONS: Structured interventions during pregnancy based on Mediterranean diet or Stress reduction are associated with a lower proportion of small placentas, which is consistent with the previously observed beneficial effects of these interventions on fetal growth.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Breast cancer is the most common malignancy that occurs in women. Due to the pain caused by the disease itself and the adverse reactions in the treatment process, breast cancer patients are prone to anxiety, depression, fear of recurrence, and other negative emotions, which seriously affect the quality of life. As a systematic stress reduction therapy, mindfulness-based stress reduction is widely applied to the treatment of breast cancer patients and has been found by a growing number of studies to relieve stress, regulate mood, and improve the state. However, due to the absence of recent research and uniform outcome measures, previous studies have failed to fully explain the role of mindfulness-based stress reduction in improving the quality of life in breast cancer patients. OBJECTIVE: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate and compare the effects of mindfulness-based stress reduction therapy and standard care on the quality of life and psychological status of breast cancer patients. METHODS: We searched PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, China's National Knowledge Infrastructure and the Cochrane Central Registry of Controlled Trials up to July 2023 to identify candidate randomized clinical trials addressing the values of mindfulness-based stress reduction in breast cancer patients. RESULTS: A total of 1644 patients participated in 11 randomized controlled trials. The results of the meta-analysis showed that mindfulness-based stress reduction therapy can significantly reduce negative emotions such as perceived stress (MD = -1.46, 95%CI = -2.53 to -0.38, p = 0.03), depression (MD = -1.84, 95%CI = -3.99 to -0.30, p = 0.0004), anxiety (MD = -2.81, 95%CI = -5.31 to -0.32, p = 0.002), and fear of recurrence (MD = -1.27, 95%CI = -3.44 to 0.90, p = 0.0004). Mindfulness-based stress reduction therapy also has certain advantages in improving the coping ability (MD = 1.26, 95%CI = -3.23 to5.76, p = 0.03) and the emotional state (MD = -7.73, 95%CI = -27.34 to 11.88, p = 0.0007) of patients with breast cancer. CONCLUSION: Our analyses support that, compared with standard care, mindfulness-based stress reduction therapy can significantly improve patients' coping ability, reduce adverse emotions and improve patients' emotional states.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Following the COVID-19 global emergency, health students were faced with increased workloads, university closures, study interruptions, loss of peer support networks, and the challenges of volunteer work in hospitals. These factors caused health students to experience significant stress and anxiety, highlighting the necessity of psychological interventions for this group. Several studies have reported that a mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) protocol offers valuable coping skills for traumatic events. This study aimed to investigate the impact of Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) on stress, anxiety, and depression among nursing students at Qom University of Medical Sciences during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHOD: This experimental study was conducted on 72 nursing students from the nursing faculty of Qom University of Medical Sciences in 2020. The sampling was conducted using stratified sampling, and the allocation method employed was simple randomization. MBSR intervention based on social networks was implemented for the experimental group. The Stress-Anxiety-Depression Assessment Questionnaire (DASS-21) was completed by both groups before the study commenced, immediately after, and 2 months post-intervention. Data were analyzed in SPSS-16 using t-test, chi-square, and repeated measures analysis. RESULTS: Analysis of variance with repeated measures showed that in the experimental group, the effect of time on the average score of stress, anxiety, and depression is significant (p < 0.001). The t-test showed significant differences between the two groups in terms of stress, anxiety, and depression scores immediately after the intervention (p < 0.001) and in the follow-up phase (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: MBSR based on social networks is effective and applicable in reducing stress, anxiety, and depression among nursing students during the COVID-19 pandemic. It is suggested that MBSR should be included in the curriculum of nursing students so that they can have the necessary mental preparation to face acute critical conditions such as COVID-19."

METHODS: A total of 60 patients with NSCLC who had not received surgical treatment were selected using convenience sampling and divided into an intervention group and control group, with 30 patients in each group. The control group received conventional psychological nursing care, whereas the intervention group received a combination of MBwSR and exercise therapy. Before the intervention, a questionnaire was completed to collect the basic data of the two groups. Further questionnaires were administered at 6 and 8 weeks after treatment to assess anxiety, depression, sleep quality and other items included in the five-item Brief Symptom Rating Scale (BSRS-5). RESULTS: No significant differences between the intervention and control groups were identified in terms of personal and clinical characteristics (p > 0.05). No significant differences were determined in the BSRS-5, Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS), Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS) or Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) scores between the intervention and control groups before the intervention. However, 6 and 8 weeks after the intervention, scores were significantly lower in both groups (p < 0.001). Significant differences in the BSRS-5, SAS, SDS and PSQI scores were identified between the two groups at different time points (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: The combination of MBSR and exercise intervention demonstrated improvements in anxiety, depression, sleep quality and BSRS-5 scores in patients with NSCLC.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: The main objectives of the current paper were to examine the feasibility, acceptability, and adherence of a remotely delivered intervention consisting of mindfulness-based stress reduction plus prenatal sleep classes (MBSR+PS) compared with treatment as usual (TAU). METHOD: In this pilot randomized controlled trial, 52 pregnant women with poor sleep quality were randomized to MBSR+PS or TAU. MBSR was delivered through eight weekly 2.5-hour sessions, and PS was delivered through eight weekly 30-minute sessions. PS content drew material from cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia tailored for the perinatal period and from a mindfulness- and acceptance-based lens. Participants completed endpoint measures 10-12 weeks after randomization. RESULTS: We surpassed all acceptability targets, including the percentage of eligible participants willing to be randomized (96%), percentage of participants who initiated treatment (88%), and satisfaction scores (Client Satisfaction Questionnaire-8 score M = 28.04, SD = 3.6). We surpassed all feasibility targets, including our enrollment target, retention rate (92%), and measure completion (96%). Finally, we surpassed adherence targets, including MBSR and PS session attendance (≥80%). Though sleep outcomes were exploratory, increases in sleep efficiency were greater in the MBSR+PS group relative to TAU (SMD=.68). CONCLUSIONS: Patient-reported poor sleep quality during pregnancy has high public health significance because it is common, consequential, and under-treated. The current feasibility and acceptability data for using remotely delivered MBSR and PS to improve prenatal sleep quality are encouraging and warranting future research that is sufficiently powered and designed to provide efficacy data. In addition, exploratory sleep outcomes offer preliminary evidence that this sleep program may improve sleep efficiency during pregnancy.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Hundreds of trials have evaluated Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR), but in the United States, it is generally not covered by health insurance. Consequently, the aims were to identify the following: (1) key questions to make decisions about if, how, and when MBSR should be covered by health insurance; (2a) barriers and (2b) facilitators to understand and resolve for MBSR to be covered by health insurance; and (3) highest priority evidence needed to inform health insurance coverage decisions. METHODS: Key informants (n = 26) included health insurers, healthcare administrators, policymakers, clinicians, MBSR instructors, and MBSR students. An initial pool of items related to the study aims was generated through qualitative interviews. Through the Delphi process, participants rated, discussed, and re-rated each item's relevance. Items were required to reach a consensus of ≥ 80% agreement to be retained for final inclusion. RESULTS: Of the original 149 items, 42 (28.2%) met the ≥ 80% agreement criterion and were retained for final inclusion. The most highly rated items informing whether MBSR should be covered by health insurance included research demonstrating that MBSR works and that it is not harmful. The most highly rated barriers to coverage were that MBSR is not a medical treatment and patient barriers to attendance. Highly rated facilitators included the potential of MBSR to address common mental health and psychosomatic problems. Finally, understanding what conditions are effectively treated with MBSR and the impact of MBSR on stress were rated as the highest priority evidence needed to inform health insurance coverage decisions. CONCLUSIONS: Findings highlight priorities for future research and policy efforts to advance health insurance coverage of MBSR in the United States.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Depression is a common and serious psychological condition, which seriously affects individual well-being and functional ability. Traditional treatment methods include drug therapy and psychological counseling; however, these methods have different degrees of side effects and limitations. In recent years, nonconvulsive electrotherapy (NET) has attracted increasing attention as a noninvasive treatment method. However, the clinical efficacy and potential mechanism of NET on depression are still unclear. We hypothesized that NET has a positive clinical effect in the treatment of depression, and may have a regulatory effect on serum inflammatory factors during treatment. AIM: To assess the effects of NET on depression and analyze changes in serum inflammatory factors. METHODS: This retrospective study enrolled 140 patients undergoing treatment for depression between May 2017 and June 2022, the observation group that received a combination of mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) and NET treatment (n = 70) and the control group that only received MBSR therapy (n = 70). The clinical effectiveness of the treatment was evaluated by assessing various factors, including the Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD)-17, self-rating idea of suicide scale (SSIOS), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and levels of serum inflammatory factors before and after 8 wk of treatment. The quality of life scores between the two groups were compared. Comparisons were made using t and χ2 tests. RESULTS: After 8 wk of treatment, the observation group exhibited a 91.43% overall effectiveness rate which was higher than that of the control group which was 74.29% (64 vs 52, χ2 = 7.241; P < 0.05). The HAMD, SSIOS, and PSQI scores showed a significant decrease in both groups. Moreover, the observation group had lower scores than the control group (10.37 ± 2.04 vs 14.02 ± 2.16, t = 10.280; 1.67 ±0.28 vs 0.87 ± 0.12, t = 21.970; 5.29 ± 1.33 vs 7.94 ± 1.35, t = 11.700; P both < 0.001). Additionally, there was a notable decrease in the IL-2, IL-1β, and IL-6 in both groups after treatment. Furthermore, the observation group exhibited superior serum inflammatory factors compared to the control group (70.12 ± 10.32 vs 102.24 ± 20.21, t = 11.840; 19.35 ± 2.46 vs 22.27 ± 2.13, t = 7.508; 32.25 ± 4.6 vs 39.42 ± 4.23, t = 9.565; P both < 0.001). Moreover, the observation group exhibited significantly improved quality of life scores compared to the control group (Social function: 19.25 ± 2.76 vs 16.23 ± 2.34; Emotions: 18.54 ± 2.83 vs 12.28 ± 2.16; Environment: 18.49 ± 2.48 vs 16.56 ± 3.44; Physical health: 19.53 ± 2.39 vs 16.62 ± 3.46; P both < 0.001) after treatment. CONCLUSION: MBSR combined with NET effectively alleviates depression, lowers inflammation (IL-2, IL-1β, and IL-6), reduces suicidal thoughts, enhances sleep, and improves the quality of life of individuals with depression."

      "abstract": "Elevated blood pressure is one of the major risk factors for cardiovascular diseases. Available evidence on mind-body medicine (MBM) techniques on blood pressure is inconclusive and provides conflicting results. The objective of the current systematic review and meta-analysis is to evaluate the effect of MBM techniques on blood pressure in patients with cardiovascular disease. Randomized control trials (RCTs) done between the years 2000 and 2020 on cardiovascular disease, using MBM techniques such as meditation, mindfulness-based stress reduction and relaxation techniques were searched through electronic databases such as PubMed, Cumulative Index to Nursing & Allied Health (CINAHL), EMBASE and Cochrane Library. Three authors independently performed article selection, data extraction and validation. Meta-analysis was performed using a random effect model and standardized mean difference (SMD) with 95% confidence interval (CI) estimated for the effect size. Fifteen RCTs with 927 patients were included in the meta-analysis. Heterogeneity among the studies was very high for all analyses (I2>94%). For studies comparing systolic blood pressure, MBM interventions show a significant (p=0.01) effect when compared to conventional treatment, an overall estimated effect size of SMD - 0.78 (95% CI: -1.36, -0.20). For studies comparing the diastolic blood pressure, MBM intervention did not show any significant effect when compared to the conventional treatment, an overall effect size of SMD -0.26 (95% CI: -0.91, 0.39). The findings of the meta-analysis suggest that MBM interventions may improve systolic blood pressure alone in patients with cardiac diseases. With high heterogeneity and low quality of the included studies, more robust evidence is required before suggesting MBM as an effective treatment modality for reducing blood pressure in cardiovascular diseases."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Individuals with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) experience cycles of aggressive physical symptoms including abdominal pain, diarrhea, and fatigue. These acute symptoms regress and return, and chronic symptoms and complications often linger. The nature of the disease can also cause individuals to experience psychological distress including symptoms of anxiety and depression; however, unlike the physical symptoms of IBD, these psychological symptoms often remain untreated. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and effectiveness of virtual mindfulness-based stress reduction (v-MBSR) for adults with IBD. METHODS: IBD patients with self-reported anxiety or depression were recruited from clinics in Alberta, Canada to participate in an 8-week v-MSBR intervention. Eligible patients participated in v-MBSR delivered by psychiatrists using a videoconferencing platform. Primary feasibility outcomes included trial uptake, adherence, attendance, and attrition rates. Secondary effectiveness outcomes included measures of anxiety, depression, quality of life (QoL), and mindfulness. Effectiveness data were collected at 3 time points: baseline, at intervention completion, and 6 months after completion. To further assess feasibility and acceptability, participants were invited to participate in a semistructured interview after completing v-MBSR. RESULTS: A total of 16 of the 64 (25%) referred patients agreed to participate in v-MBSR with the most common reason for decline being a lack of time while 7 of the 16 (43.8%) participants completed the program and experienced encouraging effects including decreased anxiety and depression symptoms and increased health-related QoL with both improvements persisting at 6-month follow-up. Participants described improved coping strategies and disease management techniques as benefits of v-MBSR. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with IBD were interested in a psychiatrist-led virtual anxiety management intervention, but results demonstrate v-MBSR may be too time intensive for some patients with IBD patients. v-MBSR was acceptable to those who completed the intervention, and improvements to anxiety, depression, and QoL were promising and sustainable. Future studies should attempt to characterize the patients with IBD who may benefit most from interventions like v-MBSR."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The knee joint, a structurally intricate component, is highly susceptible to injuries, profoundly impacting the afflicted patients' life quality. Among these injuries, loose body removal stands out, historically managed through conventional open surgical interventions. However, such procedures entail complications, including infection and extended recovery periods, fostering postoperative psychological distress like anxiety and depression. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to assess the impact of WeChat-based mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) on psychological resilience and quality of life in patients undergoing loose body removal. METHODS: A cohort of 87 patients undergoing surgical treatment for loose body removal in our hospital between November 2018 and August 2019 was enlisted. They were randomly allocated to either receive routine postoperative nursing (control group) or participate in WeChat-based MBSR (observation group) using a random number table method. Assessment parameters encompassed anxiety, depression, mindfulness levels, quality of life, personality traits, and psychological resilience. RESULTS: After treatment, patients in the observation group exhibited significantly reduced levels of depression, anxiety, and heightened mindfulness compared to the control group (P < .05). Moreover, the observation group reported superior quality of life and personality traits compared to the control group (P < .05). Additionally, patients in the observation group demonstrated enhanced psychological resilience compared to the control group (P < .05). CONCLUSIONS: WeChat-based MBSR emerges as a promising intervention, significantly alleviating depression and anxiety while enhancing the quality of life and psychological resilience in patients undergoing loose body removal surgery, suggesting its potential for widespread clinical application."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is characterized by overactivation of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) that leads to increased cardiovascular disease risk. Despite the deleterious consequences of SNS overactivity, there are very few therapeutic options available to combat sympathetic overactivity. AIM: To evaluate the effects of Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) on SNS activity in CKD patients. METHOD: Participants with CKD stages III-IV were randomized to an 8-week MBSR program or Health Education Program (HEP; a structurally parallel, active control group). Primary outcomes were direct intraneural measures of SNS activity directed to muscle (MSNA) via microneurography at rest and during stress maneuvers. RESULTS: 28 participants (63 ±9 years; 86% males) completed the intervention with 16 in MBSR and 12 in HEP. There was a significant Group (MBSR vs. HEP) by Time (baseline vs. post-intervention) interaction in the change in MSNA reactivity to mental stress (p=0.026), with a significant reduction in the mean change in MSNA over 3 minutes of mental arithmetic at post-intervention (10.6 ± 7.1 to 5.0 ± 5.7 bursts/min, p<0.001), while no change was observed within the HEP group (p=0.773). CONCLUSIONS: In this randomized controlled trial, patients with CKD had an amelioration of sympathetic reactivity during mental stress following 8-weeks of MBSR but not after HEP. Our findings demonstrate that mindfulness training is feasible and may have clinically beneficial effects on autonomic function in CKD."

Participants (n = 10) who received MBSR prior to TKA participated in semi-structured interviews concerning their experiences with MBSR and its perceived impact on surgery. We analyzed interviews according to reflexive thematic analysis, and coded data into three main themes: 1) Impact of MBSR on surgery experiences; 2) Contributors to change; and 3) Motivations for participation. Participants noted they were able to relax, feel more confident, and cope more effectively during the preoperative period, and that others in their lives noticed positive changes following their participation in MBSR. Participants' openness to mindfulness and health-related beliefs and may have contributed to the positive impacts they experienced from MBSR. Participants described being motivated to participate in MBSR to help them prepare for their surgery and to learn new coping strategies. Participants described a strong level of commitment to the intervention. With further research, integration of MBSR into prehabilitation for TKA may be appropriate.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Fibromyalgia (FM) is a pain condition characterized by physical and psychological difficulties. This randomized controlled trial aimed to evaluate the effects of a mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) on FM patients and identify the role of two pain cognitions: psychological inflexibility in pain (PIPS) and pain catastrophizing (PCS), as mechanisms of change. METHODS: 95 FM patients (Mean ± SD: 49.18 ± 13.26 years) were randomly assigned to MBSR group therapy (n = 49) or a waitlist (WL) control group (n = 46). An adapted MBSR protocol for FM was employed. A series of measures were taken, covering FM symptoms, depression, perceived stress (PSS), PIPS and PCS. Three measurements were conducted: pre-intervention, post-intervention and 6-months follow up. RESULTS: Compared to WL controls, the MBSR group showed greater improvements in FM symptoms (F(1,78) = 2.81, p < 0.05), PSS (F(1,78) = 4.38, p < 0.05) and Depression (F(1,78) = 21.12, p < 0.001), with mostly medium effect sizes. Improvements in PSS (F(2,68) = 7.75, p < 0.05) and depression (F(2,68) = 15.68, p < 0.05) remained stable over six months. The effect of MBSR on FM and PSS was mediated by one's reported change in PIPS. The effect of MBSR on depression was mediated by one's reported change in PCS. CONCLUSIONS: These results reveal the significant therapeutic potential of MBSR for FM patients, due to the emphasis on non-judging and acceptance of negative inner states. Furthermore, this research identified two important pain-related cognitions as mechanisms of change, suggesting that MBSR contributes to cognitive change, which enables the reduction of physical and psychological distress.

METHODS: This study included 60 patients with CSCR who were randomly allocated to one of two groups: MBSR or control (which did not practice MBSR). These groups were then evaluated in terms of best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and central macular thickness (CMT) at months 1, 3, and 6. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in BCVA or mean CMT between the groups at the beginning of the study (p = 0.615 and p = 0.561, respectively). There were statistically significant differences between the groups in terms of BCVA at 1, 3, and 6 months (p = 0.018, p = 0.001, and p = 0.002, respectively). There were also significant differences in the mean CMT across the groups at the first, third, and sixth months (p < 0.001, p = 0.001, and p < 0.001, respectively).

Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) can relieve depression. This retrospective cohort study aimed to investigate the effects of MBSR on mental health and quality of life in CKD patients with mild-to-moderate depression, so as to provide guidance for clinical nursing programs. METHODS: The clinical data of 100 CKD patients with mild-to-moderate depression who were treated in Jiading District Central Hospital Affiliated Shanghai University of Medicine & Health Sciences from January 2021 to March 2023 were retrospectively analyzed. Based on nursing method received, the patients were divided into the conventional group (conventional management) and the MBSR group (MBSR therapy was implemented in addition to conventional management). After matching, there were 35 cases in each group. The scores for the self-rating depression scale (SDS), Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC), Five-factor Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and 36-item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) were compared between the two groups. RESULTS: After management, the SDS and PSQI scores of the MBSR group were lower than those of the conventional group, and the CD-RISC, FFMQ and SF-36 scores were higher than those of the conventional group (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: MBSR can improve the mental health, sleep quality, and quality of life of CKD patients with mild-to-moderate depression, and improve psychological resilience and mindfulness.",

The research method was the semi-experimental type, with pre-test, post-test, follow-up, and experimental and control groups. Methods: The population included patients with IBS in Isfahan city; 45 of them were selected by convenience sampling method and randomly assigned to 3 groups (15 in each group). Then, the patients of one experimental group received eight sessions of 90 minutes of a mindfulness-based stress reduction program, while the other experimental group received eight sessions of 90 minutes of compassion-focused therapy. The measurement tools included the Cognitive Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (Garnefski and Kraaij, 2002) and a short clinical interview. Research data were analyzed using variance analysis with repeated measures on one factor (mixed design). Results: Both intervention methods were equally effective in changing the cognitive regulation of adaptive emotion mean scores (P<0.01), but the effect of compassion-focused therapy on improving the mean scores of cognitive regulation of adaptive emotion was more than mindfulness-based stress reduction therapy (P<0.05). Conclusion: It was concluded that both intervention methods can be used as complementary treatment for patients with IBS."

      "abstract": "The growing number of people aging with HIV represents a group vulnerable to the symptom burdens of HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND). Among younger groups, Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) has been shown to help people living with HIV manage HIV-related and other life stress, and although there is some theoretical and empirical evidence that it may be effective among those with cognitive deficits, the approach has not been studied in older populations with HAND. Participants (n = 180) 55 years or older with HIV and cognitive impairment were randomly assigned to either an 8-week MBSR arm or a waitlist control. We assessed the impact of MBSR compared to a waitlist control on psychological outcomes [stress, anxiety, depression, and quality of life (QOL)] and cognitive metrics (e.g., speed of information processing, working memory, attention, impulsivity) measured at baseline, immediately post intervention (8 weeks) and one month later (16 weeks). Intent to treat analyses showed significant improvement in the MBSR group compared to control on symptoms of depression from baseline to 8 weeks, however, the difference was not sustained at 16 weeks. The MBSR group also showed improvement in perceived QOL from baseline to 16 weeks compared to the waitlist control group. Cognitive performance did not differ between the two treatment arms. MBSR shows promise as a tool to help alleviate the symptom burden of depression and low QOL in older individuals living with HAND and future work should address methods to better sustain the beneficial impact on depression and QOL.",

This meta-analysis reviews existing randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that have examined the effects of mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) on the relief of psychosomatic stress-related outcomes and quality of life among university students. METHODS: The PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, PsycINFO (formerly PsychLit), Ovid MEDLINE, ERIC, Scopus, Google Scholar, ProQuest, and Cochrane Library databases were searched in November 2023 to identify the RCTs for analysis. Data on pathology (anxiety, depression, and perceived stress), physical capacity (sleep quality and physical health), and well-being (mindfulness, self-kindness, social function, and subjective well-being) were analyzed. RESULTS: Of the 276 articles retrieved, 29 met the inclusion criteria. Compared with control therapies, the pooled results suggested that MBSR had significant effects, reducing anxiety (SMD = -0.29; 95% CI: -0.49 to -0.09), depression (SMD = -0.32; 95% CI: -0.62 to -0.02), and perceived stress (SMD = -0.41; 95% CI: -0.60 to -0.29) and improving mindfulness (SMD = 0.34; 95% CI: 0.08 to 0.59), self-kindness (SMD = 0.57; 95% CI: 0.30 to 1.12), and physical health (SMD = -0.59; 95% CI: -1.14 to -0.04). No significant differences were observed in sleep quality (SMD = -0.20; 95% CI: -0.06 to 0.20), social function (SMD = -0.71; 95% CI: -2.40 to 0.97), or subjective well-being (SMD = 0.07; 95% CI: -0.18 to 0.32). The quality of the evidence regarding sleep quality and physical health outcomes was low. CONCLUSIONS: MBSR therapy appears to be potentially useful in relieving functional emotional disorders. However, additional evidence-based large-sample trials are required to definitively determine the forms of mindfulness-based therapy that may be effective in this context and ensure that the benefits obtained are ongoing. Future studies should investigate more personalized approaches involving interventions that are tailored to various barriers and students' clinical characteristics. To optimize the effects of such interventions, they should be developed and evaluated using various designs such as the multiphase optimization strategy, which allows for the identification and tailoring of the most valuable intervention components."

METHODS: Ninety-three caregivers for patients with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder, who were hospitalized in Yunnan Provincial Mental Hospital in March 2021, were enrolled and randomly divided into control group (n=47) and MBSR intervention group (n=46). Both groups received basic health education and rehabilitation skill training, while the intervention group received additional online MBSR for 8 weeks. The anxiety and depression status, and the quality of life of the caregivers were evaluated by Self-rating Anxiety Scale (SAS), Self-rating Depression Scale (SDS) and the 36-item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) before and 8 weeks after intervention, respectively. RESULTS: Thirteen caregivers dropped out of the study, and 80 subjects (40 in each group) were included in the final analysis. At the baseline, there were no significant differences in SAS, SDS and SF-36 scores between two groups (all P>0.05). Compared with the baseline, SAS and SDS scores in the intervention group significantly decreased after 8 weeks of intervention (both P<0.01) and were significantly lower than those in the control group (both P<0.01). There were no significant changes in the control group (all P>0.05). Except the physiological function dimension, the total score and the scores of each dimension of SF-36 in the intervention group were significantly increased after 8-week intervention (all P<0.05), and were significantly higher than those in the control group (all P<0.01). There were no significant changes in the control group before and after intervention (all P>0.05).

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This randomized parallel-group controlled trial was conducted with 95 pregnant women (MBSR: n = 32, deep relaxation exercises: n = 31, control: n = 32) between 1 August and 15 October 2022 with pregnant women who were registered at the pregnancy outpatient clinics of a hospital in the Southeastern Anatolia Region of Türkiye. CONSORT guidelines were followed in our study. The participants in the MBSR group were given an eight-session MBSR program, consisting of two sessions per week for 4 weeks, whereas the participants in the deep relaxation exercises group were asked to do exercises at home with deep relaxation videos four times a week for 4 weeks. The participants in the control group received only routine prenatal care. RESULTS: The mean PRAQ-R2 Fear of Giving Birth subscale scores of the participants in the MBSR and deep relaxation exercises groups after the intervention were lower than that of the participants in the control group. Additionally, the mean total PRAQ-R2, PRAQ-R2 Worries about Bearing a Physically or Mentally Handicapped Child subscale and PRAQ-R2 Concern about One's Own Appearance subscale scores of the participants in the MBSR group were found to be significantly lower than the scores of those in the deep relaxation exercises and control groups (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: The MBSR program is an effective method for reducing pregnancy-related anxiety levels. Additionally, deep relaxation exercises are alternative practices for reducing the fear of giving birth among pregnant women. TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT05447000.",

Therefore, the aim of this study is to determine the effect of mindfulness-based stress reduction program on emotion regulation and sleep problems in depressed elderly. METHODS: This study was a clinical trial conducted on 60 elderly individuals with depression using purposive sampling. These elderly were referred by geriatricians and were included in the study based on the inclusion criteria. The participants were randomly assigned to two groups: the Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) group and the control group. Both groups completed the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS), the Gratz and Roemer Emotion Regulation Questionnaire, and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index before and after the intervention. The MBSR sessions were held for the experimental group in 8 sessions of 90 min each, once a week. Finally, all the data were analyzed using SPSS software version 26 through descriptive and analytical statistics such as mean and standard deviation, t-tests and mixed analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with repeated measures. RESULTS: The results showed that the MBSR intervention led to a significant reduction in depression symptoms (p < 0.001) and improvement in emotion regulation and sleep quality (p < 0.001) among the elderly participants with depression in the intervention group. DISCUSSION: The results of this study showed that MBSR can be effective in reducing depression levels, improving emotion regulation, and sleep quality among depressed elderly individuals compared to the control group. Caregivers and psychotherapists of nursing homes can use care programs such as MBSR program to improve the physical and mental condition of the elderly.

      "abstract": "Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) has not yet been evaluated for people with cerebral palsy (CP). The aims of this randomised control trial were to investigate whether a modified telehealth MBSR program could improve mindfulness and reduce depression, anxiety, and emotion regulation difficulties among adults with CP with elevated anxiety and/or emotional regulation difficulties. Participants (n = 31) with elevated anxiety and/or emotion regulation difficulties and no/mild intellectual impairment were randomised to a modified telehealth MBSR program (90 min weekly, 9 weeks) group or a wait-list group. Measurements were collected prior to (T1), after (T2), and 8 weeks post-intervention (T3). The primary outcome was the mean between-group difference in the change in Cognitive and Affective Mindfulness Scale-R (CAMS-R) scores in T1-T2. The secondary outcomes included mean within-group differences over time for the CAMS-R total scores, Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale-21 subscales, and Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS) total t-score. We found no statistically significant between-group difference in mean change in mindfulness scores for T1-T2 (primary outcome). Secondary outcomes: The MBSR intervention group had improved CAMS-R scores with respect to T1-T2 and T1-T3; improved mean scores for Depression and Stress subscales for T1-T2; and improved DERS t-scores for T1-T2 and T1-T3. In conclusion, this study found no significant between-group difference for the primary outcome of mindfulness. The MBSR program was successfully modified for adults with CP and was effective in improving depression, stress, and emotion regulation. ACTRN12621000960853."

      "abstract": "Psychosocial interventions for people with chronic pain produce significant improvements in outcomes, but these effects on average are modest with much variability in the benefits conferred on individuals. To enhance the magnitude of treatment effects, characteristics of people that might predict the degree to which they respond more or less well could be identified. People with chronic low back pain (N = 521) participated in a randomized controlled trial which compared cognitive therapy, mindfulness-based stress reduction, behavior therapy and treatment as usual. Hypotheses regarding predictors and/or moderators were based on the Limit, Activate, and Enhance model; developed to predict and explain moderators/predictors of psychosocial pain treatments. Results were: 1) low levels of cognitive/behavioral function at pre-treatment predicted favorable pre- to post-treatment outcomes; 2) favorable expectations of benefit from treatment and sound working alliances predicted favorable pre- to post-treatment outcomes; 3) women benefited more than men. These effects emerged without regard to treatment condition. Of note, high levels of cognitive/behavioral function at pre-treatment predicted favorable outcomes only for people in the treatment as usual condition. Analyses identified a set of psychosocial variables that may act as treatment predictors across cognitive therapy, mindfulness-based stress reduction and behavior therapy, as hypothesized by the Limit, Activate, and Enhance model if these 3 treatments operate via similar mechanisms. Findings point toward people who may and who may not benefit fully from the 3 psychosocial treatments studied here, and so may guide future research on matching people to these kinds of psychosocial approaches or to other (eg, forced-based interventions) non-psychosocial approaches. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier is NCT02133976. PERSPECTIVE: This article examines potential predictors/moderators of response to psychosocial treatments for chronic pain. Results could guide efforts to match people to the most effective treatment type or kind.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Migration is a phenomenon worldwide, with older migrants, particularly those with fewer socioeconomic resources, having an increased risk of developing adverse cognitive and health outcomes and social isolation. Therefore, it is of utmost importance to validate interventions that promote healthy aging in this population. Previous studies have shown a positive impact of mindfulness based-stress reduction (MBSR) on outcomes such as cognition and sleep. However, only a few studies verified its potential in older adults, especially with vulnerable populations such as migrants. This article presents the protocol of the MEDITAGING study, which is the first to investigate the MBSR effects in migrants aged ≥55 in comparison to a health promotion program. METHODS: MEDITAGING is a two-arm randomized, double-blinded, controlled study, which will include older Portuguese-speaking migrants (n = 90). Participants are randomized to the MBSR or a health promotion program. Both interventions are conducted in groups over a total of 8 weeks, incorporating weekly meetings, an additional 4-hour class, and extra at-home tasks. The health promotion program has the same structure as the MBSR but comprises different activities related to dementia prevention, healthy habits, cognitive stimulation, sleeping, nutrition, watercolor painting, and physical activity. The assessment of executive functioning, physiological stress measures, self-reported questionnaires, and qualitative interviews are conducted at baseline, after 8 weeks (post-intervention), and at a follow-up session (from one to 3 months thereafter). Analyzes will be conducted using a modified intention-to-treat approach (all participants with at least 3 days of participation in the group-sessions and one post-intervention observation). DISCUSSION: This study will test effects of a mindfulness-based intervention against an active control condition in older adult migrants, which few studies have addressed.

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Aging is associated with increased proinflammatory gene expression and systemic inflammation, and psychosocial stress may accelerate these changes. Mindfulness interventions show promise for reducing psychosocial stress and extending healthspan. Inflammatory pathways may play a role. In a sample of lonely older adults, we tested whether mindfulness training reduces proinflammatory gene expression and protein markers of systemic inflammation. METHODS: Lonely older adults (65-85 years; N = 190) were randomly assigned to an 8-week Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) or matched Health Enhancement Program (HEP). Blood was drawn before and after the intervention and at 3-month follow-up. In peripheral blood mononuclear cells, RNA profiling was used to assess transcriptional regulation by proinflammatory nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) as well as β-adrenergic cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB), antiviral interferon regulatory factor (IRF), and glucocorticoid receptor (GR) transcription factors. Plasma was assayed for proinflammatory markers interleukin 6 (IL-6) and C-reactive protein (CRP). Analyses tested time (pre, post, follow-up) by condition (MBSR versus HEP) effects. RESULTS: MBSR reduced NF-κB ( d = 0.17, p = .028) but did not alter CREB ( d = 0.10, p = .20), IRF ( d = 0.13, p = .086), or GR activity ( d = 0.14, p = .063) relative to HEP over time. Contrary to predictions, there were no time by condition effects of MBSR compared with HEP on reducing circulating IL-6 or CRP. CONCLUSIONS: In lonely older adults, MBSR reduced cellular proinflammatory gene regulation in ways that would predict reduced disease risk. However, no similar effect was observed for circulating protein markers of inflammation. These results provide specificity about how mindfulness interventions may impact distinct inflammatory markers among aging adults in ways that may have important implications for healthspan.

Eighty three eligible patients with a Rome- IV diagnosis were randomly allocated in DBT, MBSR, ACT, and control groups (n = 22 per group). All the patients were evaluated for IBS symptoms by IBS Severity Scoring System (IBS-SSS), QOL by irritable bowel syndrome quality of life (IBS-QOL), anxiety by Beck's Anxiety Inventory (BAI) and depression by Beck Depression Inventory- II (BDI-II) on the studied groups at the time of their inclusion in the study and 8 weeks after it. Each of the intervention groups took part in 8 group sessions. Conversely, the control group were evaluated without any intervention. 54 male and 29 female in 4 groups completed the study: DBT (n = 20), MBSR (n = 19), ACT (n = 22), and control groups (n = 22). The results showed significant differences between the groups based on the variables of the IBS-SSS, IBS-QOL, BAI and BDI-II (p < 0.05). Furthermore, the ACT intervention had considerably lower levels of IBS symptoms, anxiety, and depression compared to the other groups; also, the significant impacts of the QOL variable showed the higher scores of the ACT compared to the treatment groups. The therapies could not be applied to other groups of people. Other shortcomings were the absence of a follow-up strategy. This research offers preliminary evidence that ACT is more successful than other therapy groups in reducing IBS symptoms, anxiety and sadness, and improving QOL in IBS patients.",

METHOD: A secondary analysis of an RCT using simple mediation, with 164 graduates of MBCT and mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR), was implemented whereby MBCT-TiF (vs ongoing mindfulness practice; OMP) was the independent variable; changes in mindfulness, self-compassion, and decentering during the intervention were the mediators; and mental well-being at post-intervention, whilst controlling for baseline, was the dependent variable. Secondary outcomes included psychological quality of life, depression, and anxiety. RESULTS: Compared to OMP, MBCT-TiF experienced significant improvements in mental well-being through changes in all three mediators (mindfulness: ab = 0.11 [0.03, 0.25]; decentering: ab = 0.16 [0.05, 0.33]; self-compassion: ab = 0.07 [0.01, 0.18]). A similar pattern was demonstrated for depression, but only mindfulness and decentering mediated effects on psychological quality of life and anxiety. CONCLUSION: The findings provide preliminary support for all three mediators in driving change in mental well-being in a sample of MBCT/MBSR graduates. Future work must be theory-driven and powered to test all mediators in parallel and alongside other potential mediators (e.g., equanimity) to further understand independent contributions and interacting effects.Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT05154266.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The staggering morbidity associated with chronic inflammatory diseases can be reduced by psychological interventions, including Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR). Proposed mechanisms for MBSR's beneficial effects include changes in salience network function. Salience network perturbations are also associated with chronic inflammation, including airway inflammation in asthma, a chronic inflammatory disease affecting approximately 10% of the population. However, no studies have examined whether MBSR-related improvements in disease control are related to changes in salience network function. METHODS: Adults with asthma were randomized to 8 weeks of MBSR or a waitlist control group. Resting state functional connectivity was measured using fMRI before randomization, immediately post-intervention, and 4 months post-intervention. Using key salience network regions as seeds, we calculated group differences in change in functional connectivity over time and examined whether functional connectivity changes were associated with increased mindfulness, improved asthma control, and decreased inflammatory biomarkers. RESULTS: The MBSR group showed greater increases in functional connectivity between salience network regions relative to the waitlist group. Improvements in asthma control correlated with increased functional connectivity between the salience network and regions important for attention control and emotion regulation. Improvements in inflammatory biomarkers were related to decreased functional connectivity between the salience network and other networks. CONCLUSIONS: Increased resting salience network coherence and connectivity with networks that subserve attention and emotion regulation may contribute to the benefits of MBSR for patients with asthma. Understanding the neural underpinnings of MBSR-related benefits in patients is a critical step towards optimizing brain-targeted interventions for chronic inflammatory disease management.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Migraine is a neurological disorder characterized by recurrent, severe headaches that are often accompanied by other symptoms. There are various factors that can trigger a migraine in sufferers. Stress can be such a trigger. Drug and nondrug treatments are available for the preventive treatment of migraine. According to a German guideline, mindfulness can be recommended for the prophylaxis of migraine. Therefore, the aim was to investigate the effectiveness of mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) in relation to patient-relevant outcomes in adult patients with migraine. Patient-relevant outcomes in this context are migraine frequency, headache intensity during a migraine attack, depressive symptoms, and quality of life. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The conduct of this study was guided by the PRISMA 2020 statement. A systematic literature search for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of the effectiveness of MBSR in adult migraine patients was conducted in December 2021 in three databases: MEDLINE via PubMed, the Cochrane Library, and Web of Science. In addition, a review of reference lists and a search of study registries were performed. The last search was conducted on October 7, 2022. In a two-step process, studies were selected based on predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria. The potential for bias was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool 2. The results were summarized descriptively and by means of quantitative synthesis. RESULTS: Four RCTs with a total of 275 patients and the follow-up publication of one of these studies were included. The risk of bias in one study each was judged to be low or of some concern and high in two studies. Four studies were included in the quantitative analysis. For the endpoint migraine frequency, the meta-analytic summary of three studies failed to show a statistically significant benefit for MBSR (SMD: -0.23; 95% CI: -0.79 to 0.32). For the endpoint depressive symptoms, a meta-analytic summary of three studies showed a statistically significant benefit for MBSR (SMD: -0.59; 95% CI: -0.93 to -0.25). No study had examined the severity of headaches during a migraine episode. CONCLUSION: Some results suggest that migraine patients may benefit from MBSR. However, the evidence base is currently insufficient for recommendations on the use of MBSR as a nondrug treatment option. Further adequately powered, high-quality RCTs are needed. UNLABELLED: <title>Einleitung</title>Migräne ist eine neurologische Erkrankung, die durch wiederkehrende, starke Kopfschmerzen gekennzeichnet ist, die häufig von anderen Symptomen einhergehen. Es gibt verschiedene Faktoren, die bei den Betroffenen eine Migräne auslösen können. Ein solcher Auslöser kann Stress sein. Für die präventive Behandlung der Migräne stehen medikamentöse und nichtmedikamentöse Verfahren zur Verfügung. Laut einer deutschen Leitlinie kann Achtsamkeit zur Prophylaxe von Migräne empfohlen werden. Ziel der Studie war es daher, die Wirksamkeit von achtsamkeitsbasierter Stressreduktion (MBSR) in Bezug auf patientenrelevante Outcomes bei erwachsenen Migränepatienten zu untersuchen. Patientenrelevante Outcomes in diesem Zusammenhang sind Migränehäufigkeit, Kopfschmerzintensität während einer Migräneattacke, depressive Symptome und Lebensqualität.<title>Methoden</title>Die Durchführung dieser Studie orientierte sich am PRISMA-Statement. Eine systematische Literatursuche nach randomisierten kontrollierten Studien zur Wirksamkeit von MBSR bei erwachsenen Migränepatienten wurde im Dezember 2021 in drei Datenbanken durchgeführt: MEDLINE über PubMed, die Cochrane Library und Web of Science. Darüber hinaus wurden Referenzlisten und Studienregister durchsucht. Die letzte Suche erfolgte am 7. Oktober 2022. In einem zweistufigen Verfahren wurden die Studien anhand von vordefinierten Ein- und Ausschlusskriterien ausgewählt.

Für den Endpunkt Migränehäufigkeit ergab die metaanalytische Zusammenfassung von drei Studien keinen statistisch signifikanten Vorteil für MBSR (SMD −0.23; 95% CI −0.79 bis 0.32). Für den Endpunkt depressive Symptome zeigte eine metaanalytische Zusammenfassung von drei Studien einen statistisch signifikanten Vorteil für MBSR (SMD −0.59; 95% CI −0.93 bis −0.25). Keine Studie hatte die Schwere der Kopfschmerzen während einer Migräneepisode untersucht.<title>Schlussfolgerung</title>Einige Ergebnisse deuten darauf hin, dass Migränepatienten von MBSR profitieren können.

Therefore, the present study aimed to investigate the effect of Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction counseling on blood sugar and perceived stress in women with gestational diabetes. METHODS:  The present quasi-experimental interventional study was performed on 78 women with gestational diabetes. In the intervention group, a Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction counseling program was conducted by the researcher in 8 sessions of 90 minutes twice a week. The Cohen stress questionnaire was filled in both groups. Also, fasting blood sugar and 2-hour blood sugar levels were measured in both groups. Statistical analysis was performed using the independent T-Test, the paired T-Test, the Mann-Whitney and Wilcoxon Tests using IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows version 20 version (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). RESULTS:  The mean age of pregnant women in the intervention group was 28.84 ± 6.20 years old and 29.03 ± 5.42 years old in the control group. There was a significant mean difference between the fasting blood sugar score (p = 0.02; - 6.01; and - 11.46) and the 2-hour fasting blood sugar score (p < 0.001;12.35; and - 5.3) and the perceived stress score (p < 0.001; 35.57; and - 49.19) existed between the intervention and control groups after the intervention. CONCLUSION:  The results of the present study showed that mindfulness-based stress reduction counseling is effective in reducing blood sugar levels and reducing perceived stress in women with gestational diabetes treated with diet.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Maternal suboptimal nutrition and high stress levels are associated with adverse fetal and infant neurodevelopment. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate if structured lifestyle interventions involving a Mediterranean diet or mindfulness-based stress reduction during pregnancy are associated with differences in fetal and neonatal brain development. STUDY DESIGN: This was a secondary analysis of the randomized clinical trial Improving Mothers for a Better Prenatal Care Trial Barcelona that was conducted in Barcelona, Spain, from 2017 to 2020. Participants with singleton pregnancies were randomly allocated into 3 groups, namely Mediterranean diet intervention, stress reduction program, or usual care. Participants in the Mediterranean diet group received monthly individual sessions and free provision of extra-virgin olive oil and walnuts. Pregnant women in the stress reduction group underwent an 8-week mindfulness-based stress reduction program adapted for pregnancy. Magnetic resonance imaging of 90 fetal brains was performed at 36 to 39 weeks of gestation and the Neonatal Neurobehavioral Assessment Scale was completed for 692 newborns at 1 to 3 months. Fetal outcomes were the total brain volume and lobular or regional volumes obtained from a 3-dimensional reconstruction and semiautomatic segmentation of magnetic resonance images. Neonatal outcomes were the 6 clusters scores of the Neonatal Neurobehavioral Assessment Scale. Multiple regression analyses were conducted to assess the association between the interventions and the fetal and neonatal outcomes. RESULTS: When compared with the usual care group, the offspring exposed to a maternal Mediterranean diet had a larger total fetal brain volume (mean, 284.11 cm3; standard deviation, 23.92 cm3 vs 294.01 cm3; standard deviation, 26.29 cm3; P=.04), corpus callosum (mean, 1.16 cm3; standard deviation, 0.19 cm3 vs 1.26 cm3; standard deviation, 0.22 cm3; P=.03), and right frontal lobe (44.20; standard deviation, 4.09 cm3 vs 46.60; standard deviation, 4.69 cm3; P=.02) volumes based on magnetic resonance imaging measures and higher scores in the Neonatal Neurobehavioral Assessment Scale clusters of autonomic stability (mean, 7.4; standard deviation, 0.9 vs 7.6; standard deviation, 0.7; P=.04), social interaction (mean, 7.5; standard deviation, 1.5 vs 7.8; standard deviation, 1.3; P=.03), and range of state (mean, 4.3; standard deviation, 1.3 vs 4.5; standard deviation, 1.0; P=.04). When compared with the usual care group, offspring from the stress reduction group had larger fetal left anterior cingulate gyri volume (1.63; standard deviation, 0.32 m3 vs 1.79; standard deviation, 0.30 cm3; P=.03) based on magnetic resonance imaging and higher scores in the Neonatal Neurobehavioral Assessment Scale for regulation of state (mean, 6.0; standard deviation, 1.8 vs 6.5; standard deviation, 1.5; P<.01). CONCLUSION: Maternal structured lifestyle interventions involving the promotion of a Mediterranean diet or stress reduction during pregnancy were associated with changes in fetal and neonatal brain development.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Stress and mental disorders in pregnancy can adversely affect the developing fetus. Women with a preconception history of mental disorders or of psychosocial vulnerabilities are at increased risk of experiencing perinatal stress or mental health problems. Mindfulness-Based-Stress-Reduction (MBSR) is an acceptable intervention for pregnant women and has a growing evidence-base with meta-analyses consistently pointing to reductions in symptoms of stress, anxiety and depression. This study protocol aim to address the need for a wider array of evidence-based and non-pharmacological options during pregnancy to reduce stress and improve mental health in a psychosocially highly vulnerable group of women. METHODS: Pregnant women with a preconception history of mental disorders or psychosocial vulnerabilities (n = 240) will be recruited from an obstetric ambulatory clinic at Copenhagen University Hospital, Hvidovre, Denmark. Recruitment for the study began in March 2022 and will continue until the desired number of participants is reached. Consenting pregnant women will be randomized to one of two study arms, an adapted MBSR program as add on to usual care or usual care alone. The primary outcome is mental wellbeing at nine months post-randomization. Secondary and exploratory outcomes include stress, anxiety, depression, and maternal antenatal attachment, experience of childbirth, delivery and mode of delivery. Mindfulness and self-compassion are examined as possible mediators of the effect on outcomes. DISCUSSION: Teaching the skills of mindfulness meditation to a psychosocially vulnerable group of pregnant women could prove a viable and non-pharmacological approach to improve mental health and wellbeing during pregnancy, reduce stress and support the transition to parenthood. Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction does not target a particular group, and results from the study is thus of potential relevance for pregnant women in general as a means of reducing stress and improving perinatal mental health and wellbeing.

      "abstract": "Patient access to mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR), a complementary and integrative health approach that is proven to reduce chronic pain, can be increased via community pharmacy-based implementation. However, the general public's awareness and preferences regarding MBSR as a treatment option for chronic pain, including provider roles (pharmacist vs. non-pharmacist), are unclear. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to assess the U.S. general public's knowledge, attitudes, barriers, and programmatic preferences regarding MBSR for chronic pain management, particularly in the community pharmacy setting. A cross-sectional, anonymous online survey was distributed to U.S. adults ≥18 years via the Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) online survey platform. The survey instrument was informed by Anderson's framework for health service utilization. Measures were assessed using multiple-choice and 5-point Likert-type scales (1 = strongly disagree, 5 = strongly agree). Primary outcome measures included: (1) knowledge and awareness of MBSR (12-items); (2) confidence in seeking out MBSR for pain (5-items); (3) barriers to receiving MBSR (11-items); (4) beliefs about MBSR in general (12-items); (5) beliefs about community pharmacy-delivered MBSR (15-items); and (6) preferences for MBSR classes/programs (6-items). Outcomes were analyzed using descriptive statistics, and influential factors associated with mean beliefs regarding community pharmacy-delivered MBSR for chronic pain management were assessed via multiple linear regression. Of the 302 survey respondents, the majority were white (79.1%) and female (50.7%), with a mean age of 44.65 years. Respondents' self-rated MBSR knowledge (mean [SD] scale score: 2.30 [0.68]) and confidence (2.65 [0.87]) were low, although perceived barriers to access were low overall (2.22 [0.53]). Beliefs regarding the use of MBSR for treatment of chronic pain were positive in general (3.67 [0.71]), but more negative regarding community pharmacy-delivered MBSR (2.38 [0.56]). Confidence in seeking out MBSR (β = 0.297, 95% CI = 0.219 to 0.375; p < 0.001) and current opioid use (β = 0.419, 95% CI = 0.147 to 0.690; p = 0.003) were positively associated with beliefs regarding pharmacy-delivered MBSR, while annual household income (β = -0.124, 95% CI = -0.244 to -0.004; p = 0.043) and level of bodily pain (β = -0.149, 95% CI = -0.291 to -0.008; p = 0.039) exerted statistically significant negative influences. Respondents preferred a hybrid MBSR class format including both online and in-person components (29.7%) as well as both group and individual session options (43.7%). In conclusion, further education is necessary to increase the public's perception of community pharmacies as a resource for complementary and integrative health."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) has demonstrated its effectiveness in reducing pain-related stress in adults with chronic pain. However, the implementation of MBSR needs modifications across cultures. This pilot study reports the findings of a randomized controlled trial that investigated the effects of a culturally adaptive MBSR program on self-report and neuroimaging outcomes for chronic pain adults in China. METHODS: Sixty-seven participants were randomly assigned to the treatment group (n = 40) or the treatment-as-usual group (n = 27) group at a ratio of 1.5:1. Participants completed self-report measures of pain severity, pain interference, depression, perceived stress, pain catastrophizing, mindfulness, and resilience at baseline assessment (T1), post-treatment (T2), and 3-month follow-up (T3) assessments. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scanning was also performed at T1 and T3 assessments. RESULTS: For the intention-to-treat sample, the results of the mixed-effect model indicated that Group × Time interaction was significant for pain catastrophizing only (F (2, 130) = 3.51, p = 0.033). Compared with the control group, those in the MBSR group reported greater reductions in pain catastrophizing at T2 (d = - 0.60), though this effect was not maintained at T3 (d = - 0.05). Additionally, the results of completer analyses found significant Group × Time interactions for pain interference (F (2, 88) = 4.40, p = 0.015) and perceived stress (F (2, 88) = 3.13, p = 0.048), but not for other measures. Finally, both groups exhibited decreased regional homogeneity (ReHo) in the frontal lobe, while increased ReHo in the cerebellum anterior lobe was unique to the MBSR group. CONCLUSIONS: The present findings suggest that the minor modified MBSR program improves certain pain-related outcomes for Chinese adults with chronic pain. Future studies with larger samples of Chinese chronic pain patients are needed to detect the small-to-moderate benefit of MBSR on fMRI and/or other objective methods."

      "abstract": "It is of interest to investigate the effectiveness of a mindfulness-based stress reduction program on stress and salivary cortisol among substance abuse patients. There were 60 drug addicts who were receiving treatment at the addiction centre. Samples are divided into 30 drug abuse patient experimental and 30 substance abuse patient control groups using the simple random sampling approach. Salivary cortisol, a pre-test stress biomarker, was measured and used to analyse the results. The MBSR programme was administered over thecourse of eight weeks, with two 1-hour sessions held each day, with a cap of 15 participants. The biomarker for stress (salivary cortisol) will be obtained once again at the end of the program to assess the post-test level of perceived stress and compare it to the results. Patients showed improvements in stress level (p < 0.05) following the 8-week MBSR program. The mean level of blood cortisol in the experimental group was 18.08 (3.62), which was dropped to 7.54 (1.29) before the intervention. The mean cortisol level in the experimental group differs by 10.54 (3.45) between pre and post intervention following the intervention (p value is < 0.005). Thus, there is a difference between the experimental conditions before and after the intervention. The mean serum cortisol level in the pre-test is 17.30 (2.34) and the mean serum cortisol level in the post test is 17.15 (2.31) in the control group (p value is > 0.005). Data shows that there is a significant difference between the groups. MBSR may be a beneficial intervention for reducing stress, in Patients taking treatment in de addiction centre."

OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that structured interventions based on a Mediterranean diet or mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) during pregnancy improve child neurodevelopment at age 2 years. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This was a prespecified analysis of the parallel-group Improving Mothers for a Better Prenatal Care Trial Barcelona (IMPACT BCN) randomized clinical trial, which was conducted at a university hospital in Barcelona, Spain, from February 2017 to March 2020. A total of 1221 singleton pregnancies (19 to 23 weeks' gestation) with high risk of delivering newborns who were small for gestational age were randomly allocated into 3 groups: a Mediterranean diet intervention, an MBSR program, or usual care. A postnatal evaluation with the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development, 3rd Edition (Bayley-III), was performed. Data were analyzed from July to November 2022. INTERVENTIONS: Participants in the Mediterranean diet group received monthly individual and group educational sessions and free provision of extra virgin olive oil and walnuts. Those in the stress reduction group underwent an 8-week MBSR program adapted for pregnancy. Individuals in the usual care group received pregnancy care per institutional protocols. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Neurodevelopment in children was assessed by Bayley-III at 24 months of corrected postnatal age. RESULTS: A total of 626 children (293 [46.8%] female and 333 [53.2%] male) participated at a mean (SD) age of 24.8 (2.9) months. No differences were observed in the baseline characteristics between intervention groups. Compared with children from the usual care group, children in the Mediterranean diet group had higher scores in the cognitive domain (β, 5.02; 95% CI, 1.52-8.53; P = .005) and social-emotional domain (β, 5.15; 95% CI, 1.18-9.12; P = .01), whereas children from the stress reduction group had higher scores in the social-emotional domain (β, 4.75; 95% CI, 0.54-8.85; P = .02).

Previous studies on the psychological adaptability of nurses mainly focused on investigation rather than intervention. Ninety nurses were randomly classified into an intervention or control group. The intervention group received weekly online mindfulness-based stress reduction training for 8 weeks. The Subjective Well-being, Job Burnout, and Psychological Use scales were administered pre- and postintervention. Postintervention, nurses' positive emotions and life satisfaction significantly improved. Nurses' psychological adaptation was significantly higher postintervention than preintervention. The total scores for negative emotion, low personal accomplishment, and job burnout were significantly lower postintervention than preintervention. The scores for positive emotion and life satisfaction in the intervention group were significantly higher than those in the control group, and the scores for low personal accomplishment in the intervention group were significantly lower than those in the control group. Online mindfulness-based stress reduction interventions can improve nurses' subjective well-being, reduce job burnout, and improve their level of psychological adaptability. Moreover, it could promote nurses' ability to communicate mindfully with patients and their families. This intervention could help promote the development of mindfulness in the nursing field.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: As the focal point of epidemic prevention and control, the mental health of COVID-19 patients cannot be ignored. Online Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) allows for the provision of conveniently accessible, effective and low-cost interventions on a large scale. We aim to evaluate the effectiveness of an online MBSR intervention in alleviating anxiety and depression among asymptomatic/mild patients limited by COVID-19-related restrictions. METHODS: Fifty-eight patients treated in Sanya Fangcang hospital were randomly allocated to either to the experimental group (n = 29) following daily, for 5 days, an online-based mindfulness intervention or to the control group (n = 29). Patients from both groups underwent online questionnaires including assessment of anxiety and depression status at pre- and post-tests using Self-rating Anxiety Scale and Self-Rating Depression Scale. RESULTS: After the online-based MBSR program, the anxiety and depression scores of the patients in the MBSR group decreased significantly in comparison to the scores of those in the control group (respectively η2 = 0.175, η2 = 0.215, p < 0.001). And the proportion of severe anxiety and depression patients in the MBSR group decreased to 0% which lower than the control group, and the proportion of light anxiety and depression patients was significantly more than that in the control group after the MBSR intervention. CONCLUSION: The online-based MBSR intervention appears to be an effective way of alleviating anxiety and depression symptoms among COVID-19 patients with associated quarantine in Fangcang hospital. Given the seriousness of mental health threat that could be posed by this ongoing pandemic, our study provides a new idea and method for cost-effective and time-efficient interventions in the future of epidemic prevention and control."

      "abstract": "People with Huntington's disease (HD) face difficult emotional and practical challenges throughout their illness, including in the pre-symptomatic stage. There are, however, extremely limited psychosocial interventions adapted to or researched for HD. We adapted and piloted an 8-week mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) program in people with pre-symptomatic HD to determine if the program (i) was feasible and acceptable to participants, (ii) resulted in increased mindfulness understanding and skills, and (iii) led to improved psychological adjustment. Quantitative measures of mindfulness, emotion regulation, mood, and quality of life were administered pre and post the MBSR program and at 3-month follow-up. Measures of mindfulness practice and session clarity were administered weekly. Qualitative participant feedback was collected with a post-program interview conducted by independent clinicians. Seven participants completed the 8-week course. The program's feasibility and acceptability was supported by excellent retention and participation rates and acceptable rates of home practice completion. In addition, qualitative feedback indicated participant satisfaction with the program structure and content. Two core mindfulness skills (observing and non-judgment) showed significant improvement from pre- to post-assessment. Participant qualitative feedback indicated increased confidence and capacity to use mindfulness techniques, particularly in emotionally challenging situations. Participant questionnaire data showed good psychological adjustment at baseline, which did not change after treatment. Psychological benefits of the program identified in qualitative data included fewer ruminations about HD, reduced isolation and stigma, and being seen by others as calmer. These findings justify expansion of the program to determine its efficacy in a larger, controlled study."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: A large body of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) has shown that mindfulness-based interventions are effective for improving mental health, but research is lacking in regards to the mechanisms of change. We aimed to investigate the mediating effects of self-reported altered resting state of Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) on mental health, when provided as a universal intervention in a real-life context. METHODS: Autoregressive path models with three time points of measurement, and contemporaneous and constant b paths were used in an RCT. The RCT took place in all five geographical regions of Denmark and included 110 schools and 191 schoolteachers. The schools were randomized 1:1 in each geographical region to intervention or a wait-list control group. The intervention was the standardized MBSR. Data were collected at baseline and after 3 and 6  months. The outcomes were perceived stress, measured by Cohen's Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), symptoms of anxiety and depression, measured by Hopkins Symptom Check List-5 (SCL-5), and well-being measured by WHO-5 Well-being Index (WHO-5). The mediator was resting state measured by the Amsterdam Resting State Questionnaire (ARSQ). RESULTS: Statistically significant mediated effects of altered ARSQ-subscales scores for Discontinuity of Mind, Planning, and Comfort were found for the MBSR effect on all outcomes; PSS, SCL-5 and WHO-5. Furthermore, statistically significant mediated effects of altered sleepiness subscale score of the effects on PSS and SCL-5 of MBSR were found. No statistically significant mediating effects of the subscales Theory of Mind, Self and Somatic Awareness for the MBSR intervention effect were found. CONCLUSION: The results support that the MBSR program can alter self-reported resting state, towards less mind wandering and more comfort, measured by the ARSQ, and that this may explain some of the mechanisms regarding the effectiveness of MBSR on mental health at 6 months, when provided as a universal intervention. The study provides insight into an active ingredient of how MBSR may improve mental health and well-being. It supports the suggestions that mindfulness meditation may be a sustainable way of training the mental health.Clinical trial registration:ClinicalTrials.gov, identifier NCT03886363."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Stress-related disorders are a growing public health concern. While stress is a natural and adaptive process, chronic exposure to stressors can lead to dysregulation and take a cumulative toll on physical and mental well-being. One approach to coping with stress and building resilience is through Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR). By understanding the neural mechanisms of MBSR, we can gain insight into how it reduces stress and what drives individual differences in treatment outcomes. This study aims to establish the clinical effects of MBSR on stress regulation in a population that is susceptible to develop stress-related disorders (i.e., university students with mild to high self-reported stress), to assess the role of large-scale brain networks in stress regulation changes induced by MBSR, and to identify who may benefit most from MBSR. METHODS: This study is a longitudinal two-arm randomised, wait-list controlled trial to investigate the effects of MBSR on a preselected, Dutch university student population with elevated stress levels. Clinical symptoms are measured at baseline, post-treatment, and three months after training. Our primary clinical symptom is perceived stress, with additional measures of depressive and anxiety symptoms, alcohol use, stress resilience, positive mental health, and stress reactivity in daily life. We investigate the effects of MBSR on stress regulation in terms of behaviour, self-report measures, physiology, and brain activity. Repetitive negative thinking, cognitive reactivity, emotional allowance, mindfulness skills, and self-compassion will be tested as potential mediating factors for the clinical effects of MBSR. Childhood trauma, personality traits and baseline brain activity patterns will be tested as potential moderators of the clinical outcomes. DISCUSSION: This study aims to provide valuable insights into the effectiveness of MBSR in reducing stress-related symptoms in a susceptible student population and crucially, to investigate its effects on stress regulation, and to identify who may benefit most from the intervention.

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to examine the effects of mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) in patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) after primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PPCI). METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted with data collected from AMI patients who underwent successful PPCI. The study included 61 cases that received 8-week MBSR intervention (MBSR group) and 61 cases that received weekly health education (control group) over the same period. Outcome measures, including hemodynamic parameters, psychosocial characteristics [Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), Perceived Social Support Scale (PSSS)], health-related quality of life [HRQoL, 7-item Seattle Angina Questionnaire (SAQ-7)], and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), were assessed at baseline (T1), post-intervention (T2), 1 month after the post-intervention (T3) and 3 months after the post-intervention (T4). RESULTS: Compared to the control group, the MBSR group showed improvements in blood pressure, specifically in systolic blood pressure (SBP) at T4, and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) at T3 and T4, and mean arterial blood pressure (MABP) at T3 and T4. Additionally, the MBSR group had lower scores of anxiety and perceived stress (HADS, PSS) and higher scores of perceived social support (PSSS) after the intervention. Furthermore, the MBSR group had higher scores on the SAQ-7 at all measurement points. The control group had a significantly higher total MACE rate compared to the MBSR group (26.23% vs. 9.84%). CONCLUSIONS: This study provides support for the potential benefits of MBSR as an adjunctive treatment for AMI patients undergoing PPCI.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) is an important health problem that affects women of childbearing age. Mindfulness, a meditation practice that cultivates the acceptance of events as they occur in the moment without judgment, is a promising strategy to help women cope with PMS. This study aimed to test the efficacy of a mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) program in decreasing premenstrual symptoms compared with a control group. METHODS: This study was a prospective, single-masked randomized controlled trial conducted between February and April 2022 with 90 university students. Participants were women between 20 and 30 years of age, scored at least 45 on the Premenstrual Syndrome Scale (PMSS), and were not receiving other treatments for PMS. Participants were randomized into experimental (MBSR) and control groups in a 1:1 allocation. MBSR was provided in 8 weekly sessions lasting 2.5 hours and a 6-hour silence retreat during week 6. Symptoms of PMS were evaluated with the PMSS at baseline and postintervention. Differences between groups were compared postintervention using analysis of covariance to correct for baseline scores. The study was registered at www. CLINICALTRIALS: gov before the data collection process was initiated (NCT05191108). RESULTS: Of the 90 enrolled participants, 74 participants completed the study and postintervention assessment (37 in each group). Immediately postintervention, the women in the experimental group had significantly lower PMS symptoms than women in the control group (PMSS total score, 96.35 vs 123.02; P < .001). The effect size for the change in premenstrual symptoms was large (partial η2 , 0.510). Specific symptoms measured by the PMSS subscales all showed significant reductions in scores in the MBSR group compared with the control group. DISCUSSION: A mindfulness stress reduction program was effective in reducing premenstrual symptoms. MBSR programs may be used as a therapy for PMS. Future studies should test MBSR in larger and more diverse groups of women with PMS.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To investigate the clinical effects of mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) intervention combined with early cardiac rehabilitation (CR) on patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) assisted with an intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP). METHODS: A total of 100 AMI patients with IABP assistance due to hemodynamic instability at Wuhan Asia Heart Hospital were enrolled in the study. The participants were divided into two groups using the random number table method (n = 50 each group). Patients receiving routine CR were assigned to the CR control group, while patients receiving MBSR plus CR were assigned to the MBSR intervention group. The intervention was performed twice a day until the removal of the IABP (5-7 days). Each patient's level of anxiety/depression and negative mood state were evaluated before and after intervention using the self-rating anxiety scale (SAS), self-rating depression scale (SDS), and profiles of mood state scale (POMS). The results of the control and intervention groups were compared. IABP-related complications and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), measured with echocardiography, were also assessed and compared between the two groups. RESULTS: The SAS, SDS, and POMS scores were lower in the MBSR intervention group than in the CR control group (P < 0.05). There were also less IABP-related complications in the MBSR intervention group. LVEF was significantly improved in both groups, but the degree of LVEF improvement was more significant in the MBSR intervention group than in the CR control group (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: MBSR combined with early CR intervention can assist in alleviating anxiety, depression, and other negative mood states, reduce IABP-related complications, and further improve cardiac function in AMI patients with IABP assistance."

METHODS: Thirty male wrestlers (Mage = 26.73 years) were randomly assigned either to the MBSR intervention or the active control condition. Both at the beginning and at the end of the intervention, the participants completed questionnaires on perceived stress and depression; in parallel, salivary samples were collected to measure cortisol in saliva, while blood samples were collected to assess serum CK. The study lasted for eight consecutive weeks. The intervention consisted of 16 group sessions (90 min each); the active control condition had an identical schedule, though without bona fide interventions. During the study period, the participants kept their sleeping, nutritional and exercising schedules unaltered. RESULTS: Over time, symptoms of stress and depression decreased; the level of decrease was more prominent in the MBSR condition than the active control condition (significant p values and large effect sizes of interaction). Further, cortisol and creatine kinase concentrations also decreased more in the MBSR condition compared to the active control condition (large effect sizes of interaction). CONCLUSIONS: The present study's findings suggest that among male wrestlers, a modified MBSR intervention have the potential to reduce both psychological (stress and depression) and physiological (cortisol and creatine kinase) indices as compared to an active control condition."

We aimed to evaluate the effects of mindfulness meditation on blood pressure, mental health, and quality of life in patients with hypertension. METHODS: This randomized clinical trial was performed in 2019 in Isfahan. Eighty adult women with Stage I or II hypertension were included and assigned randomly to 2 groups: 12 weeks of mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) and routine care. At baseline and 1 week after the end of the intervention, blood pressure, stress, depression, anxiety, and quality of life of the studied participants were measured using the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale-21 (DASS-21) and 36-Item Short Form Survey (SF-36) questionnaires. The data were analyzed using the independent t-test, the paired t-test, and the MANCOVA test. RESULTS: After the intervention, the mean systolic and diastolic blood pressures decreased significantly in the intervention group compared with the baseline (142.82±11.01 mmHg vs 133.7±510.43 mmHg for systolic pressure and 86.12±8.24 mmHg vs 79.15±6.26 mmHg for diastolic pressure) and the control group (140.18±14.27 mmHg vs 142.15±10.23 mmHg for systolic pressure and 84.62±9.22 vs mmHg 88.51±8.54 mmHg for diastolic pressure; P=0.001). There was also a significant increase in quality of life, stress, anxiety, and depression scores in the intervention group (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: The 12-week MBSR program resulted in a significant reduction in the mean systolic and diastolic blood pressures and improvement in mental health and different aspects of quality of life."
