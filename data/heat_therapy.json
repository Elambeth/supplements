      "abstract": "Heat therapy has gained considerable attention as a noninvasive treatment for low back pain, a condition that affects a significant proportion of the world's population. This review examines the physiological mechanisms behind heat therapy, its efficacy in relieving pain, and its role in improving mobility and quality of life. By improving blood circulation, reducing muscle stiffness, and reducing inflammation, heat therapy offers promise as an alternative or complement to conventional treatments. Various methods, including heat packs and thermal pillows, have been studied for their effects on acute and chronic pain. This review highlights key findings from clinical trials and systematic analyses, demonstrating significant reductions in pain intensity and functional impairment. Despite its benefits, aspects such as patient compliance and safety remain important factors in its clinical use. Future research should focus on optimizing treatment parameters and integrating heat therapy with other rehabilitation strategies to maximize its therapeutic potential. This comprehensive review highlights the need for a broader perspective and further research on the long-term effectiveness of heat-based interventions in the treatment of low back pain.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: FM is characterized by widespread musculoskeletal pain and associated somatic symptoms including fatigue, cognitive difficulties, and problems with sleeping. Multidisciplinary treatment of fibromyalgia including pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic interventions are recommended to improve symptoms and physical functioning. The goal of the present pilot investigation was to evaluate the effects of heat therapy via hot water immersion on clinical and objective pain measures in addition to blood measurements of heat shock proteins (HSPs) and inflammatory markers in patients with FM. METHODS: After screening, informed consent, and enrollment into the study, all subjects underwent a baseline pre-intervention evaluation which included a battery of pain phenotyping questionnaires, quantitative sensory testing, and collection of blood for measurements of HSPs and inflammatory markers. Subjects received heat therapy three times a week for four weeks, where they were immersed in hot water for 45 min. After four weeks, participants completed the same battery of testing done at baseline. RESULTS: We found that four weeks of heat therapy via hot water immersion in patients with FM showed statistically significant reductions in average and worst pain NRS severity scores when compared to baseline. There was also statistically significant improvement in overall impact of fibromyalgia symptoms, physical function, and sleep-related impairment. Regarding heat shock proteins, there was a statistically significant reduction in HSP90 and induction of HSP40 and HSC70. The number of extracellular vesicles were also statistically significantly increased. There were no statistically significant changes found in depression, anxiety, quantitative sensory testing measures, or pro- or anti-inflammatory markers. CONCLUSIONS: As a whole, these findings suggest that heat therapy via hot water immersion may be an effective non-pharmaceutical intervention for patients with FM and that its analgesic benefits may be related to decreases in HSP 90 and increases in HSP 40 and 72. Further large-scale, well-powered studies are needed to confirm our preliminary clinical and translational results."

      "abstract": "Advancing age is associated with vascular dysfunction and hypertension, both of which increase cardiovascular event risk. Heat therapy has emerged as a novel intervention to improve cardiovascular health in various populations. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that home-based lower body heat therapy would reduce blood pressure and improve endothelium-dependent vasodilation in older adults. Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring was performed in 19 older adults (67 ± 7 yr) before and after 8 wk of a sham intervention or heat therapy. Endothelium-dependent vasodilation of the superficial femoral artery was assessed via flow-mediated dilation. Participants were provided with a pair of tube-lined pants connected to a portable water circulator to perform the home-based sessions. Water temperature was set to 31°C for sham and 51°C for heat therapy, resulting in target skin temperatures of ∼33°C and ∼40°C, respectively. Participants were instructed to wear the pants 4 days/wk for 60 min each session. Adherence was 100% for both groups. Heat therapy reduced ambulatory daytime systolic blood pressure by Δ -5 ± 8 mmHg, but was unchanged for the sham group (Δ 1 ± 6 mmHg; P = 0.04). Likewise, heat therapy increased flow-mediated dilation (P = 0.02), whereas there was no change across time for the sham group (P = 0.5). These results combined with a strong adherence rate suggest that home-based lower body heat therapy could be an alternative nonpharmacological intervention to reduce blood pressure and improve vascular function, ultimately reducing long-term cardiovascular event risk in older adults.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Advancing age is associated with vascular dysfunction and hypertension, both of which increase cardiovascular event risk. This study determined that 8 wk of home-based lower body heat therapy reduced ambulatory daytime systolic blood pressure and increased flow-mediated dilation of the superficial femoral artery, outcomes not observed in the sham group. These improvements, coupled with 100% adherence among participants, suggest that home-based heat therapy is a pragmatic and effective strategy for improving cardiovascular health in older adults.",

      "abstract": "Background Labor pain is often one of the most severe pains a woman may feel in her lifetime, and childbirth is usually considered one of the most physically demanding experiences a woman may have. An effective and safe midwifery intervention for reducing labor pain in pregnant women is the administration of heat. Aim The objective of the article is to compare the effectiveness of lumbosacral heat application on pain throughout the active first stage of labor between the interventional and control groups. Method A randomized controlled trial among 10 low-risk primigravid women admitted to Bharatpur Hospital in Chitwan, Nepal, was carried out to evaluate the intensity of pain and duration of the active first phase of labor by allocating them randomly into intervention (5) and control groups (5); one group received heat therapy on the lumbosacral region, while the other received standard care. The Visual Analog Scale (VAS) was applied as an instrument to assess pain four times: before heat therapy at 4-5 cm of cervix dilation and three times after heat application at 4-5, 7-8, and 9-10 cm. The data were analyzed descriptively and inferentially using a repeated measures ANOVA test. Results The mean age of the mothers was 21.80±3.327, most of them belonged to the low socioeconomic class, all of them were living in joint families, 80% of participants had less than 18.5 body mass index, all participants had visited an antenatal clinic for check-ups, and 60% had spontaneous labor started. The findings show a higher labor pain score before intervention (mean=6.80) which progressively decreased after an intervention: post-test 2 (M=6.20; SD=0.83), post-test 3 (M=5.60; SD=0.89), and post-test 4 (M=5.00; SD=0.70). The mean, standard deviation, and F-value of labor pain before and after the application of heat therapy among primigravid women indicated a significant mean difference in labor pain (F (3,12)=4.500; MES=0.66; p=0.025; η2=0.53) with a large effect size in contrast to the control group. The p-value for post-test 4 was 0.025, representing that the null hypothesis was rejected. This acclaims that heat therapy has an effect on labor pain. Conclusion It is concluded that the application of heat on the lower back during labor lowered the pain level experienced by primigravid women in the interventional group compared to those in the control group. Thus, heat therapy can be considered a viable method for managing labor pain."

      "abstract": "Impaired glycemic control increases the risk of type 2 diabetes (T2D) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Heat therapy (HT), via hot water immersion (HWI), has shown promise in improving shared mechanisms implicated in both T2D and AD, like blood glucose regulation, insulin sensitivity, and inflammation. The potential for HT to improve brain health in individuals at risk for AD has not been examined. This pilot study aimed to assess the feasibility and adherence of using HT in cognitively healthy older individuals at risk for AD due to existing metabolic risk factors. Participants underwent 4 wk of HT (three sessions/week) via HWI, alongside cognitive screening, self-reported sleep characterization, glucose tolerance tests, and MRI scans pre- and postintervention. A total of 18 participants (9 males, 9 females; mean age: 71.1 ± 3.9 yr), demonstrating metabolic risk, completed the intervention. Participant adherence for the study was 96% (8 missed sessions out of 216 total sessions), with one study-related mild adverse event (mild dizziness/nausea). Overall, the research participants responded to a postintervention survey saying they enjoyed participating in the study and it was not a burden on their schedules. Secondary outcomes of the HT intervention demonstrated significant changes in mean arterial pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and cerebral blood flow (P < 0.05), with a trend toward improved body mass index (P = 0.06). Future studies, including longer durations and a thermoneutral control group, are needed to fully understand heat therapy's impact on glucose homeostasis and the potential to improve brain health.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Our pilot study demonstrated promising results for heat therapy (HT) via hot water immersion in older adults at risk for Alzheimer's disease due to metabolic factors. Despite a relatively short intervention, significant improvements in mean arterial pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and cerebral blood flow postintervention were observed. High participant adherence, overall satisfaction, and minimal adverse events suggest HT's feasibility. These findings highlight HT's potential as an effective alternative intervention for cardiometabolic dysfunction in at-risk populations.",

The current study assessed a PCOS-like animal model induced by consuming a high-fat sugar (HFHS) diet and compared the treatment outcome of mitochondrial-targeted antioxidants versus heat therapy. Sixty rats were divided into the following study groups: three control groups (negative and positive for the treatments used), HFHS, hot tub therapy (HTT) treatment, and MitoQ10 treatment (500 µmol/L MitoQ10 in clean drinking water daily, from week fourteen till week twenty-two of the study). At week fourteen, PCOS was confirmed by vaginal smear examination; measurements of blood testosterone (T), anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), glucose, and insulin; and determination of the homeostatic model assessment of IR (HOMA-IR). At week 22, blood samples were collected for measurement of the serum LH, FSH, AMH, T, insulin, glucose, lipid profile, kisspeptin, ADAM metallopeptidase with thrombospondin type 1 motif 19 (ADAMTS19), S100 calcium-binding protein B (S100B), fibulin 1 (FBLN1), immunoglobulin free light chains (FLCs), kappa and lambda. Ovaries were examined for morphological changes; for the levels of glutathione (GSH), catalase, SOD, malondialdehyde (MDA), and nitric oxide (NO); and the expression of FK506 binding protein 52 (FKBP52) and the androgen receptor (AR). The consumption of HFHS diet-induced PCOS-like features, which have been ameliorated by both HTT and mitoQ10 as potential therapies, with MitoQ10 showing a superior effect over HTT.",

      "abstract": "Passive heat therapy is gaining popularity as an intervention to promote cardiovascular, physiological, and, to a lesser degree, thermoregulatory adaptations in patients with cardiovascular disease. Despite this, the efficacy of heat therapy to elicit these adaptations remains unknown. We searched five databases for original research, screening 2913 studies and identifying 18 eligible studies. Heat therapies included Waon therapy, balneotherapy, water perfused trousers, Finnish sauna, and foot immersion. Interventions were administered across various time frames (20-90 min) and performed 3-7 times per week, for durations of 2-8 weeks. The studies collectively involved a diverse population (mean age: 67 (10) years) with cardiovascular diseases. Heat therapy was consistently shown to improve ejection fraction, flow-mediated dilation, brain natriuretic peptide levels, New York Heart Association classification, and 6 min walk distance. However, positive effects on resting heart rate and blood pressure were infrequently observed, and thermoregulatory responses scarcely reported. Heat therapy may increase sweat rate during heat exposure and reduce resting core temperature, but adaptive skin blood flow responses were not observed. Passive heat therapy shows promising utility in patients with cardiovascular disease, while secondary benefits such as markers of thermoregulatory adaptation may also be observed, these require further investigation.",

      "abstract": "People with symptomatic lower extremity peripheral artery disease (PAD) suffer from severe leg pain, walking impairment, and reduced quality of life, but few effective treatments are available. Emerging evidence suggests that regular heat therapy (HT) may improve cardiovascular and physical function in patients with PAD. However, the lack of accessible, practical modalities for unsupervised HT, especially for elderly individuals, has hindered clinical implementation. The goals of this study were to design and assess the feasibility of a portable leg HT system for elderly patients with PAD. Building on a cryotherapy water-circulating device used in sports recovery, we developed a new prototype system consisting of a single-touch controller unit integrating a heater, water pump, and air pump, and leg sleeves with inner-layer water-circulating pads and an outer layer of inflatable bladders. The system was designed to ensure efficient heat transfer through gentle pneumatic inflation, adapting to varying limb dimensions. Safety features included temperature sensors with auto shut-off and a built-in timer. The prototype's feasibility and safety were evaluated in a single-arm pilot trial with six symptomatic patients with PAD, who were asked to apply the therapy daily for 90 minutes for 12 weeks. Primary outcomes included completion rates, safety, and device usability. Secondary outcomes were changes in blood pressure, 6-minute walk distance, calf strength, sit-to-stand performance, and quality of life. Participants underwent a 90-minute supervised treatment session with the prototype HT units to assess the acute physiological responses before starting the 12-week intervention. Leg HT gradually increased leg skin temperature from 33.8 ± 0.8°C to 38.7 ± 0.7°C at 90 minutes and reduced arterial blood pressure, with mean reductions of 13 mm Hg in systolic and 12 mm Hg in diastolic blood pressure after treatment. All participants completed the 12-week program without serious adverse events, indicating that leg HT is safe and well-tolerated. The 6-minute walk distance improved by an average of 32 m, coupled with increased calf muscle strength and reduced time for the sit-to-stand test. Improvements were also observed in self-reported walking speed and quality of life. This study represents the first step in developing a portable leg heating system for elderly patients with PAD, demonstrating that home-based leg HT is feasible and safe. However, further engineering refinements are needed to enhance portability, simplify application, and encourage long-term adherence. Developing methods to track compliance with the treatment regimen will be crucial for the success of this unsupervised, home-based therapy."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Among children and adolescents, up to 40% will experience musculoskeletal pain (MP), which can significantly impair functional ability, reduce quality of life, cause emotional distress, and lead to sleeping disorders for both patients and their families. The first-line treatment often involves pharmacological interventions, even though there is a lack of evidence supporting the efficacy or the safety of this approach in this specific age group. Recent guidelines recommend the implementation of preventative strategies and physical tools as the first option to minimize the use of medications. We aimed to provide an expert opinion on the use of heat therapy for MP management in young patients. METHODS: This paper is the result of a virtual advisory board held by the authors in order to discuss and provide an expert opinion about the use of heat therapy in MP in children and adolescents. RESULTS: MP is a significant burden affecting children and adolescents. While non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are currently the first-choice treatment of acute and chronic MP in children and adolescents, avoiding or reducing them in such patients is advisable, to reduce side effects and to prevent the development of chronic pain and medication overuse headaches. Heat therapy can be an additional treatment option due to its ability to promote muscle relaxation, enhance blood circulation, and modulate nociceptors with a good safety profile. CONCLUSIONS: MP in children and adolescents is a common condition that should be approached multidisciplinary, including information, therapeutic exercise and physical therapies like hot or cold therapies. Future studies should be conducted to evaluate the safety, efficacy and indications of each treatment in MP."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Animal research suggests that repeated heat exposures may stimulate skeletal muscle protein synthesis and downregulate protein degradation. HYPOTHESIS: Repeated heat exposures during ankle immobilization and rehabilitation would preserve human muscle strength and mass. STUDY DESIGN: Controlled laboratory study. METHODS: A total of 20 male participants (age, 33.6 ± 2.8 years; weight, 83.8 ± 9.2 kg; height, 182 ± 6 cm) underwent 4 weeks of supervised training, 2 weeks of single-lower leg immobilization, and 2 weeks of supervised rehabilitation before return to sports (RTS). Participants were split into 2 groups: (1) whole-body heat therapy (HEAT) and (2) sham treatment (SHAM) throughout the immobilization and rehabilitation periods. Measures of muscle strength (isometric and isokinetic), volume (magnetic resonance imaging and ultrasound), and muscle biopsies were obtained preimmobilization, postimmobilization, and at RTS. RESULTS: Maximal isometric strength of the plantarflexors was lower at RTS compared with preimmobilization in SHAM (P = .027) but not HEAT (P = .301). Isokinetic strength during a fatigue test was higher at RTS compared with preimmobilization in HEAT (P = .039) but not SHAM (P = .245). Pennation angle and muscle thickness were lower at postimmobilization compared with preimmobilization only in SHAM (P≤ .027). Muscle cross-sectional area decreased in soleus and both gastrocnemius medialis and lateralis (all P≤ .035) in SHAM, but only in gastrocnemius medialis in HEAT. There was a large (d = 0.91) but not significant (P = .054) decrease in the ratio of phosphorylated/total nuclear factor-kappa B (NFκB) from preimmobilization to postimmobilization in HEAT only. There was an increase in phosphorylated fork head box O proteins (FoxO) only in HEAT (P = .034), suggesting a decrease in FoxO activity. Caspase 3 expression increased from preimmobilization to postimmobilization in SHAM only (P = .004). CONCLUSION: These results indicate that using heat therapy throughout immobilization and rehabilitation reduces skeletal muscle atrophy and maintains plantarflexor strength in healthy humans. Moreover, heat therapy may lead to the inactivation of the FoxO and NFκB signaling pathways involved in atrophy. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Repeated heat exposures should be considered a novel therapeutic intervention to counteract muscle atrophy during immobilization."

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: The purpose of this study is to compare the effects of 8 wk of no intervention (CON), lower limb heat therapy (HEAT), moderate-intensity exercise training (EX), or combined training and therapy (HEATEX) in young, healthy recreationally active adults. METHODS: Sixty participants (23 ± 3 yr, 30 females) were randomly allocated into CON ( n = 15), HEAT ( n = 15), EX ( n = 14), or HEATEX ( n = 16). The primary outcome was vascular function, assessed through brachial artery flow-mediated dilation tests. Secondary measures included arterial stiffness (pulse wave velocity), cardiorespiratory fitness (V̇O 2peak ), body composition, and quadriceps muscle strength. RESULTS: There were no differences in brachial artery flow-mediated dilation between the groups before and after the interventions (all P > 0.05). Both interventions with a heating component were associated with within-group reductions in carotid-femoral pulse wave, and increase in absolute and relative V̇O 2peak after 8 wk (HEAT: ∆-0.27 [-0.53, -0.02] m s -1 , ∆0.18 [0.06, 0.29] L·min -1 , ∆2.18 [0.60, 3.76] mL·kg -1 ·min -1 , respectively; HEATEX: ∆-0.33 [-0.58, -0.09], ∆0.21 [0.11, 0.32] L·min -1 , ∆2.59 [1.06, 4.12] mL·kg -1 ·min -1 , respectively), but no between-group differences were observed ( P = 0.25, P = 0.21, and P = 0.55, respectively). There was also a within-group decrease in body fat percentage with EX (∆-1.37 [-2.45, -0.29] %), but no changes in leg strength in any of the groups ( P = 0.79). CONCLUSIONS: This randomized controlled trial is the first to examine the efficacy of lower limb heating against traditionally prescribed exercise training. In our young cohort, 8 wk of training and/or therapy was insufficient to improve vascular function. More intense protocols and longer interventions involving lower limb heating may be required to elicit improvements in health outcomes.",

The main focus of this paper is to review the available literature about HT in knee pathologies (i.e., arthrosis, arthritis, traumatic pathologies in the subacute phase, muscle and tendon pathologies linked to fatigue, muscle tension and distractions) and to provide an expert opinion in case of lack of data."

      "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of 6 weeks of localized, muscle-focused (quadriceps femoris) passive heat therapy (PHT) on resistance artery function, exercise haemodynamics and exercise performance relative to knee extension (KE) exercise training (EX). We randomized 34 healthy adults (ages 18-36; n = 17 female, 17 male) to receive either PHT or sham heating sessions (120 min, 3 days/week), or EX (40 min, 3 days/week) over 6 weeks. Blood flow was assessed with Doppler ultrasound of the femoral artery during both passive leg movement (PLM) and a KE graded exercise test. Muscle biopsies were taken from the vastus lateralis at baseline and after 6 weeks. Peak blood flow during PLM increased to the same extent in both the EX (∼10.5% increase, P = 0.009) and PHT groups (∼8.5% increase, P = 0.044). Peak flow during knee extension exercise increased in EX (∼19%, P = 0.005), but did not change in PHT (P = 0.523) and decreased in SHAM (∼7%, P = 0.020). Peak vascular conductance during KE increased by ∼25% in EX (P = 0.030) and PHT (P = 0.012). KE peak power increased in EX by ∼27% (P = 0.001) but did not significantly change in PHT and SHAM groups. Expression of endothelial nitric oxide synthase increased significantly in both EX (P = 0.028) and PHT (P = 0.0095), but only EX resulted in increased angiogenesis. In conclusion, 6 weeks of localized PHT improved resistance artery function at rest and during exercise to the same extent as exercise training but did not yield significant improvements in performance. KEY POINTS: Many for whom exercise would be most beneficial are either unable to exercise or have a very low exercise tolerance. In these cases, an alternative treatment to combat declines in resistance artery function is needed. We tested the hypothesis that passive heat therapy (PHT) would increase resistance artery function, improve exercise haemodynamics and enhance exercise performance compared to a sham treatment, but less than aerobic exercise training. This report shows that 6 weeks of localized PHT improved resistance artery function at rest and during exercise to the same extent as exercise training but did not improve exercise performance. Additionally, muscle biopsy analyses revealed that endothelial nitric oxide synthase expression increased in both PHT and exercise training groups, but only exercise resulted in increased angiogenesis. Our data demonstrate the efficacy of applying passive heat as an alternative treatment to improve resistance artery function for those unable to receive the benefits of regular exercise."

      "abstract": "Heat therapy has been reported as a safe, effective, and readily available treatment method for heat-tolerant frogs infected with Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd). We treated wild-caught Australian green tree frogs (Litoria caerulea) infected with Bd using two periods of elevated ambient room temperature (28.2-30.3 °C for 7 weeks followed by 28.9-34.1 °C for 4 weeks). Frogs exhibited persistent and even increasing infection loads in the first treatment period despite prolonged exposure to elevated temperatures, likely due to the presence of cooler microenvironments within their enclosure (25.5-27.0 °C). All frogs eventually returned negative qPCR tests for Bd at the end of the second treatment period, but detectable infections reoccurred one month after frogs were returned to standard housing temperatures (21.2-28.7 °C). Our findings suggest that elevated ambient temperature alone might not eliminate Bd in vivo but can reduce infections loads such that they are undetectable by qPCR analysis of skin swabs. Additional factors, such as cooler microenvironments within enclosures or relative humidity, may influence the success of heat therapy. We recommend further research into the combined effects of temperature and humidity during heat therapy and emphasize the importance of accurate temperature measurements as well as post-treatment monitoring at Bd-permissive temperatures to confirm successful clearance of infections.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Musculoskeletal (MSK) pain includes a wide variety of causes and conditions. Despite the heterogeneity of MSK pain, it is possible to identify some common clinical features and treatments. Heat therapy (HT) is one of the most common and could be a suitable non-pharmacological approach. OBJECTIVE: To obtain a European overview on the use of non-pharmacological approaches and the role of heat therapy in the treatment of MSK pain. METHODS: Through a two-cycle Delphi-like method, an international board of experts reached a consensus on 13 questions for a survey to healthcare professionals who provide direct patient care. Between November 2021 and January 2022, the resulting web survey was distributed to professionals with the collaboration of ten European scientific societies and associations. Univariate and bivariate analyses were performed on collected data. RESULTS: Two hundred eighty-two answers were validated. Most of the respondents had extensive professional experience. Participants were widely distributed throughout Europe. HT is administered to about 50% of patients, with a higher percentage administered to those affected by low back pain (92%) and neck pain (84%). The choice of exogenous HT is based on both personal clinical experience and scientific evidence. HT is primarily chosen due to its relaxation effect, high safety profile and enhancement of tissue perfusion. The use of HT is recommended by 86.5% of respondents. CONCLUSION: Experts indicate that exogenous HT represents a valid therapeutic choice and is widely used in Europe. Patients should be informed about the use of heat therapy as a valuable self-management therapy option.",

Modern pharmacological treatment has become effective and can stop disease progression. Nonetheless, disease progression is often only slowed down. Moreover, pharmacological treatment does not improve functionality per se. Therefore, multimodal treatment of rheumatic disorders with physical therapy being a key element is of central importance for best outcomes. In recent years, research into physical medicine shifted from a sole investigation of its clinical effects to a combined investigation of clinical effects and potential changes in the molecular level (e.g., inflammatory cytokines and the cellular autoimmune system), thus offering new explanations of clinical effects of physical therapy. In this review we provide an overview of studies investigating different heat applications in RMDs, their effect on disease activity, pain and their influence on the molecular level.",

      "abstract": "The world is experiencing increased frequency, duration, and severity of life-threatening heat extremes. Most hospitalizations and excess deaths during extreme heat events are associated with preexisting diseases in older adults. As climate change persists, the global population ages and the number of individuals with chronic diseases expands, more people are at risk of adverse health outcomes during extreme heat events. Therefore, proactive preventive measures are urgently needed to mitigate heat-related health risks within these populations. In this context, passive heat therapy (e.g., hot baths, saunas, and water-perfused suits) emerges as a promising countermeasure to improve physiological resilience to a warming planet. Passive heating improves cardiovascular function and overall health in older adults and individuals living with chronic diseases, offering the prospect of reducing cardiovascular strain during hotter days. Moreover, some studies suggest that passive heat therapy can be an effective strategy for heat acclimation (i.e., improved thermoregulation). This review describes the existing literature on the effects of passive heat therapy on cardiovascular and thermoregulatory responses in individuals with higher heat-related health risks and explores the use of passive heating as a strategy for heat acclimation to mitigate health risks during extreme heat events.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Passive heat therapy improves cardiovascular function and health in middle-aged and older adults living with or without chronic diseases. In addition, preliminary studies indicate that passive heat interventions can induce heat acclimation, improving thermoregulatory responses. Thus, passive heat therapy could serve as a preventive measure for people at risk of adverse health outcomes during extreme heat events, improving resilience to ongoing climate change.",

However, traditional exercise such as walking and cycling can be difficult for people with degenerative joint diseases of the lower limbs, such as osteoarthritis. The purpose of this study was to compare the effect of three low-impact interventions on cardiorespiratory fitness, physical function, and subjective health before total hip or knee arthroplasty. METHODS: This was a randomized controlled trial involving 93 participants with severe knee or hip osteoarthritis awaiting joint replacement surgery. Participants underwent cardiopulmonary exercise testing (to measure peak oxygen consumption [   V ̇  $$ \\dot{V} $$  O2 ]), then were randomized to heat therapy (Heat; 20-30 min immersed in 40°C water followed by ~15 min light-resistance exercise), high-intensity interval training (HIIT; 6-8 × 60 s intervals on a cross-trainer or arm ergometer at ~90%-100% peak   V ̇  $$ \\dot{V} $$  O2 ), or home-based exercise (Home; ~15 min light-resistance exercise); for up to 36 sessions (3 sessions per week for 12 weeks). RESULTS: Peak   V ̇  $$ \\dot{V} $$  O2 increased by 16% across HIIT and to a greater extent than Heat (+2.5 mL × min-1 × kg-1 [95% CI: 0.5-4.4], P = 0.009) and Home (+3.2 mL × min-1 × kg-1 [1.2-5.2], P = 0.001). The anaerobic threshold increased across HIIT (+1.5 mL × min-1 × kg-1 [0.7-2.3], P < 0.001) and Heat (+1.2 mL × min-1 × kg-1 [0.4-1.9], P = 0.004), but not Home (-0.5 mL × min-1 × kg-1 [-1.3 to 0.3], P = 0.248). Subjective severity of osteoarthritis was unchanged with any intervention (P ≥ 0.250). CONCLUSION: Heat therapy and HIIT improved indices of cardiorespiratory fitness preoperatively in patients who have difficulty performing lower-limb exercise.",

METHODS: Seven participants (mean age 25.85 years) diagnosed with TMD having pain in the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) area with decreased jaw opening were recruited for the study. Treatment interventions consisting of SCST, phonophoresis (ultrasound gel mixed with diclofenac gel), heat therapy, and stretching (mouth-opening) exercises were performed 3 days a week for 3 weeks. SCST was performed on the masseter, medial, and lateral pterygoid muscles. No control group was present in the study. RESULTS: Paired samples t test revealed a significant difference in numerical pain rating scale (NPRS) (decreased by 50%, P < .001) and jaw functional limitation scale (JFLS) (reduced by 59.58%, P < .001) scores after 3 weeks of intervention. A large effect size (Cohen d = -3.00 for NPRS and -3.16 for JFLS) was observed for both variables. No correlation (R = 0) was found between the baseline values of NPRS and JFLS. CONCLUSION: A 3-week program consisting of SCST, phonophoresis, heat therapy, and stretching exercises was effective in reducing the pain and improving the functions related to TMJ in patients suffering from TMD.

      "abstract": "Environmental factors, such as sleep restriction, contribute to polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) by causing hyperinsulinemia, hyperandrogenism, insulin resistance, and oligo- or anovulation. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of circadian rhythm disruption on reproductive and metabolic functions and investigate the potential therapeutic benefits of MitoQ10 and hot tub therapy (HTT). Sixty female rats were divided into six groups: control, MitoQ10, HTT, and three groups with PCOS induced by continuous light exposure(L/L). The reproductive, endocrine, and structural manifestations ofL/L-induced PCOS were confirmed by serum biochemical measurements, ultrasound evaluation of ovarian size, and vaginal smear examination at week 14. Subsequently, the rats were divided into the L/L (untreated), L/L+MitoQ10-treated, andL/L+HTT-treated groups. At the end of week 22, all rats were sacrificed. Treatmentwith MitoQ10 or HTT partially reversed the reproductive, endocrine, and structural features of PCOS, leading to a decreased amplitude of isolated uterine contractions, ovarian cystic changes and size, and endometrial thickness. Furthermore, both interventions improved the elevated serum levels of anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH), kisspeptin, Fibulin-1, A disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs 19 (ADAMTS-19), lipid profile, homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), oxidative stress markers, androgen receptors (AR) and their transcription target genes, FKBP52 immunostaining in ovarian tissues, and uterine estrogen receptor alpha (ER-α) and PRimmunostaining. In conclusion, MitoQ10 supplementation and HTT demonstrated the potential for ameliorating metabolic, reproductive, and structural perturbations associated with PCOS induced by circadian rhythm disruption. These findings suggest a potential therapeutic role for these interventions in managing PCOS in women.",

Here we report a 26-year-old healthy female post-abdominoplasty patient who sustained an incidental contact burn injury from a common home remedy for her menstrual pain. Fortunately, the burn healed with secondary intent. Post-surgical loss of protective sensation facilitated this injury from heat therapy for spasmodic dysmenorrhea.

      "abstract": "Exercise is painful and difficult to perform for patients with severe lower-limb osteoarthritis; consequently, reduced physical activity contributes to increased cardiometabolic disease risk. The aim of this study was to characterize the acute and adaptive cardiovascular and metabolic effects of two low or no impact therapies in patients with severe lower-limb osteoarthritis: passive heat therapy (Heat) and high-intensity interval training (HIIT) utilizing primarily the unaffected limbs, compared to a control intervention of home-based exercise (Home). Participants completed up to 12 weeks of either Heat (20-30 min immersed in 40°C water followed by ~15-min light resistance exercise), HIIT (6-8 × 60-s intervals on a cross-trainer or arm ergometer at ~90-100% peak   V ̇  $$ \\dot{V} $$  O2 ) or Home (~15-min light resistance exercise); all 3 sessions/week. Reductions in systolic (12 & 10 mm Hg), diastolic (7 & 4 mm Hg), and mean arterial (8 & 6 mm Hg) blood pressure (BP) were observed following one bout of Heat or HIIT exposure, lasting for the duration of the 20-min monitoring period. Across the interventions (i.e., 12 weeks), resting systolic BP and diastolic BP decreased with Heat (-9 & -4 mm Hg; p < 0.001) and HIIT (-7 & -3 mm Hg; p ≤ 0.011), but not Home (0 & 0 mm Hg; p ≥ 0.785). The systolic and diastolic BP responses to an acute exposure of Heat or HIIT in the first intervention session were moderately correlated with adaptive responses across the intervention (r ≥ 0.54, p ≤ 0.005). Neither intervention improved indices of glycemic control (p = 0.310). In summary, both Heat and HIIT induced potent immediate and adaptive hypotensive effects, and the acute response was moderately predictive of the long-term response.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Chronic heat therapy may have beneficial effects on cardiovascular function. These effects may be more pronounced in older adults. We performed a pilot feasibility study of repeated heat therapy sessions in a hot tub (40.5 °C) in older adults while wearing a noninvasive hemodynamic monitor. As part of the protocol, the volunteers underwent cardiovascular performance testing pre- and post-intervention. METHODS: Fifteen volunteers > 50 years old underwent 8-10 separate 45-min hot tub session over 14 days in this exploratory and mixed methods trial. The participants had maximal oxygen consumption (VO2 max) and other cardiovascular data measured via exercise treadmill testing prior to and after all hot tub sessions. The participants also wore noninvasive fingertip volume clamp monitors while immerged in hot water that calculated systemic vascular resistance, heart rate, blood pressure, and cardiac output in order to ascertain the feasibility and utility of this data. Other laboratory studies were obtained pre- and post-intervention. The protocol was determined feasible if the heat therapy and cardiovascular testing was completed by at least 90% (14/15 subjects). Feasibility of the noninvasive monitor was determined by the fidelity of the results. Secondary exploratory outcomes were analyzed for differences to identify if they are acceptable to include in an efficacy trial. RESULTS: All participants completed the study protocol identifying the feasibility of the protocol. The noninvasive hemodynamic monitors successfully recorded cardiac output, systemic vascular resistance, heart rate, and blood pressure with fidelity based on the analysis of recordings. In the secondary analyses, we found no difference in the pre- to post-intervention measurement of VO2 max but did find increased exercise duration following hot tub therapy compared with prior to the therapy (571 s versus 551 s). CONCLUSIONS: The current pilot study protocol is feasible for the purpose of analyzing the effects of heat therapy and cardiovascular performance in older adults while wearing a noninvasive hemodynamic monitor and undergoing treadmill stress testing. Secondary analyses found increased exercise tolerance but no differences in VO2 max following heat sessions."

      "abstract": "Among females in the U.S., Black females suffer the most from cardiovascular disease and stroke. While the reasons for this disparity are multifactorial, vascular dysfunction likely contributes. Chronic whole-body heat therapy (WBHT) improves vascular function, but few studies have examined its acute effect on peripheral or cerebral vascular function, which may help elucidate chronic adaptative mechanisms. Furthermore, no studies have investigated this effect in Black females. We hypothesized that Black females would have lower peripheral and cerebral vascular function relative to White females and that one session of WBHT would mitigate these differences. Eighteen young, healthy Black (n = 9; 21 ± 3 yr; BMI: 24.7 ± 4.5 kg/m2) and White (n = 9; 27 ± 3 yr; BMI: 24.8 ± 4.1 kg/m2) females underwent one 60 min session of WBHT (49 °C water via a tube-lined suit). Pre- and 45 min post-testing measures included post-occlusive forearm reactive hyperemia (peripheral microvascular function, RH), brachial artery flow-mediated dilation (peripheral macrovascular function, FMD), and cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR) to hypercapnia. Prior to WBHT, there were no differences in RH, FMD, or CVR (p > 0.05 for all). WBHT improved peak RH in both groups (main effect of WBHT: 79.6 ± 20.1 cm/s to 95.9 ± 30.0 cm/s; p = 0.004, g = 0.787) but not Δ blood velocity (p > 0.05 for both groups). WBHT improved FMD in both groups (6.2 ± 3.4 % to 8.8 ± 3.7 %; p = 0.016, g = 0.618) but had no effect on CVR in either group (p = 0.077). These data indicate that one session of WBHT acutely improves peripheral micro- and macrovascular but not cerebral vascular function in Black and White females.",

This study investigated the effects of 6 weeks of localized heat therapy on near-infrared spectroscopy-(NIRS) derived indices of muscle oxidative and microvascular function. Twelve physically active participants (8 males and 4 females, age: 34.9 ± 5.9 years, stature: 175 ± 7 cm, body mass: 76.7 ± 13.3 kg) undertook a 6-week intervention, where adhesive heat pads were applied for 8 h/day, 5 days/week, on one calf of each participant, while the contralateral leg acted as control. Prior to and following the intervention, the microvascular function was assessed using NIRS-based methods, where 5 min of popliteal artery occlusion was applied, and the reperfusion (i.e., re-saturation rate, re-saturation amplitude, and hyperemic response) was monitored for 2 min upon release. Participants also performed a 1-min isometric contraction of the plantar flexors (30% maximal voluntary contraction), following which a further 2 min interval was undertaken for the assessment of recovery kinetics. A 20-min time interval was allowed before the assessment protocol was repeated on the contralateral leg. Repeated localized heating of the gastrocnemius did not influence any of the NIRS-derive indices of microvascular or oxidative function (p > 0.05) following 6 weeks of treatment. Our findings indicate that localized heating via the use of adhesive heat pads may not be a potent stimulus for muscle adaptations in physically active humans.",

      "abstract": "Purposeful induction of fever for healing, including the treatment of epilepsy, was used over 2000 years ago by Hippocrates. More recently, fever has been demonstrated to rescue behavioral abnormalities in children with autism. However, the mechanism of fever benefit has remained elusive due in large part to the lack of appropriate human disease models recapitulating the fever effect. Pathological mutations in the IQSEC2 gene are frequently seen in children presenting with intellectual disability, autism and epilepsy. We recently described a murine A350V IQSEC2 disease model, which recapitulates important aspects of the human A350V IQSEC2 disease phenotype and the favorable response to a prolonged and sustained rise in body core temperature in a child with the mutation. Our goal has been to use this system to understand the mechanism of fever benefit and then develop drugs that can mimic this effect and reduce IQSEC2-associated morbidity. In this study, we first demonstrate a reduction in seizures in the mouse model following brief periods of heat therapy, similar to what was observed in a child with the mutation. We then show that brief heat therapy is associated with the correction of synaptic dysfunction in neuronal cultures of A350V mice, likely mediated by Arf6-GTP.",

Muscle atrophy is one of the significant complications in DM patients, making routine tasks laborious as atrophy continues. It is known that heat stress stimulates heat shock proteins and other proteins that maintain muscle mass; however, it is not thoroughly studied in diabetic conditions. This study addressed whether heat therapy can attenuate muscle atrophy in STZ-induced diabetic rats and explored its mechanism of action on specific muscle proteins. Methods: Male Sprague Dawley rats were randomly divided into short-term (3 weeks) and long-term (6 weeks) experiments. In each experiment rats were divided into control, heat therapy, diabetic and diabetic + heat therapy groups. Rats in heat therapy groups were exposed to heat therapy for 30 min daily for three or six weeks in a temperature-controlled (42°C) chamber. Results: The attenuation of neuromuscular functions assessed by Rotarod, Kondziella's inverted screen, and extensor postural thrust tests showed that diabetic rats exposed to heat therapy performed significantly better than diabetic controls. Muscle cross sectional area data established that heat therapy reduced muscle atrophy by 34.3% within 3 weeks and 44.1% within 6 weeks in the diabetic groups. Further, heat therapy significantly decreased muscle atrophy markers (CD68, KLF, and MAFbx) and significantly elevated muscle hypertrophy markers (AKT, mTOR, and HSP70). Conclusions: This study shows the relevance and clinical significance of utilizing heat therapy as a viable treatment to attenuate muscle atrophy in diabetic patients."

The feasibility and applicability of 20-30 min (lowering a heat pack at 73 °C by wrapping it in multiple layers of towels to 40-43 °C before it touched the skin) thermotherapy are increasingly being demonstrated by applications and clinical trials. Studies show that it increases the flexibility of macules and ligament.

Therefore, this study investigates the effects of WBV and heat therapy on the muscle strength, flexibility, and balance abilities of elderly groups. Eighty middle-age and elderly participants with no regular exercise habits were enrolled in this study. They were randomly assigned to a WBV group, a WBV plus heat therapy group, a heat therapy alone group, and a control group. The WBV groups underwent 5-min, fixed-amplitude (4 mm), thrice-weekly WBV training sessions for 3 consecutive months on a WBV training machine. Participants' balance was measured using the limits of stability (LOS) test on a balance system. The pretest and posttest knee extensor and flexor strength were tested using an isokinetic lower extremity dynamometer. Pretest and posttest flexibility changes were measured using the sit-and-reach test. Significantly larger pretest and posttest differences in flexibility and muscle strength were observed in the WBV and WBV plus heat therapy groups. The addition of heat therapy to WBV resulted in the largest flexibility improvements.",

This systematic review and meta-analysis study aims to evaluate the effect of heat therapy (HT) systematically and critically on pain intensity, duration of labor during the first stage of labor and Apgar scores. METHODS: We searched for randomized controlled trials published until October 2020 in PubMed/Medline, EMBASE, ClinicalKey, Ovid Discovery, and other sources. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing heat therapy with standard treatment were selected. RESULTS: Out of 7625 screened, 10 studies met the inclusion criteria. The results of pooled data have shown that heat therapy was significantly effective in reducing pain intensity in the first stage of labor (standard mean difference, SMD= -1.31; 95% CI: -1.88 - -0.73; p<0.001). Heat therapy had significantly reduced the duration of the first stage of labor (pooled MD= -50.09; 95% CI: -89.70-10.48; p=0.01) and was also superior to the standard therapy group in terms of better Apgar scores at the 5th minute of birth of the newborn (pooled MD= -0.10; 95% CI: -0.19-0.02; p=0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Current evidence shows that heat therapy effectively decreases labor pain intensity and shortens the duration of labor in the first stage, and it can be used as nonpharmacological management for labor pain."

However, long-term heat interventions are scarce, and the effects of heat therapy need to be understood in the context of the adaptations which follow the more complex combination of stimuli from exercise training. The purpose of this work was to compare the effects of 6 weeks of localized heat therapy on human skeletal muscle mitochondria to single-leg interval training. METHODS: Thirty-five subjects were assigned to receive sham therapy, short-wave diathermy heat therapy, or single-leg interval exercise training, localized to the quadriceps muscles of the right leg. All interventions took place 3 times per week. Muscle biopsies were performed at baseline, and after 3 and 6 weeks of intervention. Mitochondrial respiratory capacity was assessed on permeabilized muscle fibers via high-resolution respirometry. RESULTS: The primary finding of this work was that heat therapy and exercise training significantly improved mitochondrial respiratory capacity by 24.8 ± 6.2% and 27.9 ± 8.7%, respectively (p < 0.05). Fatty acid oxidation and citrate synthase activity were also increased following exercise training by 29.5 ± 6.8% and 19.0 ± 7.4%, respectively (p < 0.05). However, contrary to our hypothesis, heat therapy did not increase fatty acid oxidation or citrate synthase activity. CONCLUSION: Six weeks of muscle-localized heat therapy significantly improves mitochondrial respiratory capacity, comparable to exercise training. However, unlike exercise, heat does not improve fatty acid oxidation capacity.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Musculoskeletal pain (MP) is prevalent in our society, having a strong negative impact on physical and psychosocial quality of life. Heat therapy (HT) has been frequently described as a treatment strategy for musculoskeletal pain, but scientific evidence is still poor. The aim of the present Delphi method study is to gather a consensus among European experts on the role of HT in MP. METHODS: To address this topic, a list of 54 statements was developed, concerning mechanism of action of heat on muscle, types of MP eligible for heat treatment, efficacy of HT, time and modalities of treatment, maximizing compliance to HT, safety (based on heat wraps), wrong beliefs and common errors in the prescription of HT and the role of HT in preventing muscular damage in athletes. The survey was distributed to 116 European experts, using a 5-point Likert scale to express agreement or disagreement with the statements; 66% concordance with the statements was needed to define a consensus. RESULTS: Consensus was reached on 78% of statements. There was a strong consensus on the mechanism of action of heat on muscle, the indication in chronic MP, its effectiveness as part of a multimodal approach to MP and the safety and tolerability of superficial heat therapy. A low-level of consensus was obtained on the role of heat in preventing muscular damage and in acute MP. CONCLUSION: This Delphi consensus recognizes the role of HT mostly in chronic MP and highlights the need for stronger scientific evidence to regulate the use of this therapy in clinical practice."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The burden of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is increasing worldwide. Heat therapy has been found effective in improving glycaemic control. However, to date, there is a lack of randomised controlled studies investigating the efficacy of heat therapy in T2DM. Therefore, we aim to investigate whether heat therapy with natural thermal mineral water can improve glycaemic control in patients with T2DM. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The HEAT therapy in patiEnts with type 2 Diabetes mellitus (HEATED) Study is a single-centre, two-arm randomised controlled trial being conducted at Harkány Thermal Rehabilitation Centre in Hungary. Patients with T2DM will be randomly assigned to group A (bath sessions in 38°C natural thermal mineral water) and group B (baths in thermoneutral water (30°C-32°C)). Both groups will complete a maximum of 5 weekly visits, averaging 50-60 visits over the 12-week study. Each session will last 30 min, with a physical check-up before the bath. At baseline, patients' T2DM status will be investigated thoroughly. Possible microvascular and macrovascular complications of T2DM will be assessed with physical and laboratory examinations. The short form-36 questionnaire will assess the quality of life. Patients will also be evaluated at weeks 4, 8 and 12. The primary endpoint will be the change of glycated haemoglobin from baseline to week 12. An estimated 65 patients will be enrolled per group, with a sample size re-estimation at the enrolment of 50% of the calculated sample size. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study has been approved by the Scientific and Research Ethics Committee of the Hungarian Medical Research Council (818-2/2022/EÜIG). Written informed consent is required from all participants. We will disseminate our results to the medical community and will publish our results in peer-reviewed journals.

      "abstract": "Few noninvasive therapies currently exist to improve functional capacity in people with lower extremity peripheral artery disease (PAD). The goal of the present study was to test the hypothesis that unsupervised, home-based leg heat therapy (HT) using water-circulating trousers perfused with warm water would improve walking performance in patients with PAD. Patients with symptomatic PAD were randomized into either leg HT (n = 18) or a sham treatment (n = 16). Patients were provided with water-circulating trousers and a portable pump and were asked to apply the therapy daily (7 days/wk, 90 min/session) for 8 wk. The primary study outcome was the change from baseline in 6-min walk distance at 8-wk follow-up. Secondary outcomes included the claudication onset-time, peak walking time, peak pulmonary oxygen consumption and peak blood pressure during a graded treadmill test, resting blood pressure, the ankle-brachial index, postocclusive reactive hyperemia in the calf, cutaneous microvascular reactivity, and perceived quality of life. Of the 34 participants randomized, 29 completed the 8-wk follow-up. The change in 6-min walk distance at the 8-wk follow-up was significantly higher (P = 0.029) in the group exposed to HT than in the sham-treated group (Sham: median: -0.9; 25%, 75% percentiles: -5.8, 14.3; HT: median: 21.3; 25%, 75% percentiles: 10.1, 42.4, P = 0.029). There were no significant differences in secondary outcomes between the HT and sham group at 8-wk follow-up. The results of this pilot study indicate that unsupervised, home-based leg HT is safe, well-tolerated, and elicits a clinically meaningful improvement in walking tolerance in patients with symptomatic PAD.NEW & NOTEWORTHY This is the first sham-controlled trial to examine the effects of home-based leg heat therapy (HT) on walking performance in patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD). We demonstrate that unsupervised HT using water-circulating trousers is safe, well-tolerated, and elicits meaningful changes in walking ability in patients with symptomatic PAD. This home-based treatment option is practical, painless, and may be a feasible adjunctive therapy to counteract the decline in lower extremity physical function in patients with PAD.",

A total of eight online databases were searched from inception to September 2021 for randomized controlled trials (RCTs). The control group was treated with Western medicine (WM) alone, whereas the experimental group was treated with a combined NYCH and WM therapy. A total of 30 RCTs involving 2562 participants were ultimately included. NYCH therapy combined with conventional WM delayed the onset time (days) of RTOM (MD = 10.80, p < 0.001), and at that time, a higher cumulative radiotherapy dose (Gy) (MD = 5.72, p < 0.001) was completed in the experimental group. The combination regimen also reduced the incidence of severe oral mucositis (Grade III-IV) (RR = 0.25, p < 0.001). In addition, the treatment efficacy of the experimental group was significantly better than that of the control group (RR = 1.31, p < 0.001). Compared with the patients in the control group, the experimental group had lower xerostomia scores (MD = -1.07, p < 0.001) and more saliva (MD = 0.36, p < 0.001). NYCH combined with WM improved the efficacy of treating RTOM in NPC. This study provides a sufficient basis for conducting further large RCTs to prove the efficacy of NYCH."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Adhesive capsulitis occurs with synovial inflammation and capsular fibrosis in the glenohumeral joint, leading to restriction of joint motion and pain. Heat therapy modalities, which aim at modifying dense collagenous tissues are commonly practiced interventions for patients with adhesive capsulitis; however, the effectiveness of ultrasound deep heat therapy (UST) on adhesive capsulitis is still unclear. PURPOSE: This systematic review and meta-analysis study was conducted to evaluate the effects of UST on the improvement of pain and glenohumeral joint function in adhesive capsulitis compared to (1) no treatment or placebo, and (2) any other therapeutic modalities. METHODS: A literature search was carried out in January 2021 in Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, PubMed, EMBASE, PEDro, Web of Science, and Google Scholar. The main outcomes of interest were self-reported pain scores, disability scores, and the range of motion. This study was conducted based on the guidelines of the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses) protocols, using random-effects models. RESULTS: Seven studies were included in the systematic review with five studies forming the basis for meta-analyses. The effects of UST in patients with adhesive capsulitis were compared with placebo, shockwave therapy, corticosteroid injection, platelet-rich plasma injection, or cryotherapy. The results indicated that UST significantly improved pain scores when performed together with exercise and/or other physical modalities compared to placebo; however, whether UST provides benefits for the improvement of disability and/or the range of motion was uncertain in the present results. CONCLUSIONS: The present findings suggest that UST as a co-intervention combined with other physical modalities is an effective means of improving the overall pain in patients with adhesive capsulitis.",

Besides lifestyle modifications, passive heating could be a promising intervention to improve glycemic control. This study aimed to assess the efficacy of passive heat therapy on glycemic and cardiovascular parameters, and body weight among patients with T2DM. METHODS: A systematic review and meta-analysis were reported according to PRISMA Statement. We conducted a systematic search in three databases (MEDLINE, Embase, CENTRAL) from inception to 19 August 2021. We included interventional studies reporting on T2DM patients treated with heat therapy. The main outcomes were the changes in pre-and post-treatment cardiometabolic parameters (fasting plasma glucose, glycated plasma hemoglobin, and triglyceride). For these continuous variables, weighted mean differences (WMD) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. Study protocol number: CRD42020221500. RESULTS: Five studies were included in the qualitative and quantitative synthesis, respectively. The results showed a not significant difference in the hemoglobin A1c [WMD -0.549%, 95% CI (-1.262, 0.164), p = 0.131], fasting glucose [WMD -0.290 mmol/l, 95% CI (-0.903, 0.324), p = 0.355]. Triglyceride [WMD 0.035 mmol/l, 95% CI (-0.130, 0.200), p = 0.677] levels were comparable regarding the pre-, and post intervention values. CONCLUSION: Passive heating can be beneficial for patients with T2DM since the slight improvement in certain cardiometabolic parameters support that. However, further randomized controlled trials with longer intervention and follow-up periods are needed to confirm the beneficial effect of passive heat therapy.",

The results revealed that the application of local heat therapy was associated with a shortened remission time for GLM, while the remission and recurrence rates were similar to those of existing therapies. The median first remission time following local heat therapy was significantly decreased compared with that following corticosteroid therapy (5.30 months vs. 11.27 months; P<0.05). The remission rates were not significantly different between the local heat therapy (76.9%), extensive excision (90.4%) and the corticosteroid therapy (85.7%) groups (P>0.05). In addition, the recurrence rates were not statistically different between the groups (local heat therapy, 8.3%; extensive excision, 10%; and corticosteroid therapy, 10%; P>0.05). The local heat therapy showed mild adverse effects and shortened healing times compared to the other therapies; however, further confirmation is required."

This review summarizes the role of superficial heat therapy in the management of non-specific mild-to-moderate LBP. First, we outline the common causes of LBP, then discuss the general mechanisms of heat therapy on (LBP), and finally review the published evidence regarding the impact of superficial heat therapy in patients with acute or chronic non-specific LBP. This review demonstrates that continuous, low-level heat therapy provides pain relief, improves muscular strength, and increases flexibility. Therefore, this effective, safe, easy-to-use, and cost-effective non-pharmacological pain relief option is relevant for the management of non-specific mild or moderate low back pain in current clinical practice."

METHODS: Twenty-six trained individuals were randomly allocated to either a PPDC (n = 13) or a HT (n = 13) group. After completing a 90-min session of intermittent shuttle running, participants consumed 0.3 g·kg-1 protein plus 1.0 g·kg-1 carbohydrate and received either PPDC or HT for 60 min in one randomly selected leg, while the opposite leg served as control. Muscle biopsies from both legs were obtained before and after exposure to the treatments. Muscle function and soreness were also evaluated before, immediately after, and 24 h after the exercise bout. RESULTS: The changes in glycogen content were similar (P > 0.05) between the thigh exposed to PPDC and the control thigh ~90 min (Control: 14.9 ± 34.3 vs PPDC: 29.6 ± 34 mmol·kg-1 wet wt) and ~210 min (Control: 45.8 ± 40.7 vs PPDC: 52 ± 25.3 mmol·kg-1 wet wt) after the treatment. There were also no differences in the change in glycogen content between thighs ~90 min (Control: 35.9 ± 26.1 vs HT: 38.7 ± 21.3 mmol·kg-1 wet wt) and ~210 min (Control: 61.4 ± 50.6 vs HT: 63.4 ± 17.5 mmol·kg-1 wet wt) after local HT. The changes in peak torque and fatigue resistance of the knee extensors, muscle soreness, and the mRNA expression and protein abundance of select factors were also similar (P > 0.05) in both thighs, irrespective of the treatment. CONCLUSIONS: A single 1-h session of either PPDC or local HT does not accelerate glycogen resynthesis and the recovery of muscle function after prolonged intermittent shuttle running.",

      "abstract": "Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) is endemic in many parts of the world with a high economic and health impact. Despite many treatments that have been suggested for this zoonotic infection, there is still no definite therapy for CL. Meglumine antimony compounds are considered as a standard treatment for leishmaniasis, however, these medications have a relatively high side effect profile and not always effective. Physical modalities including cryotherapy, laser, and heat therapy have also been used for this purpose. As a source of heat therapy, different methods have been used including radiofrequency, ultrasound, infrared, exothermic crystallization thermotherapy, and microwave. We reviewed all of the articles in PubMed regarding the use of heat therapy for the treatment of CL up to January 2020. According to our literature review, heat therapy using different sources showed promising results for the treatment of CL that were comparable to meglumine antimony. In addition, heat therapy has very low side effect profiles that are localized to the treatment area suggesting this method as a safe procedure for CL therapy. This study is a brief review of the literature about the effect of heat therapy on the treatment of CL. Performing randomized clinical trials to compare different methods of heat therapy and to compare it with meglumine antimony compounds is recommended."

We have conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis on the current evidence for the effect of heat therapy on blood pressure and vascular function. What advances does it highlight? We found that heat therapy reduced mean arterial, systolic and diastolic blood pressure. We also observed that heat therapy improved vascular function, as assessed via brachial artery flow-mediated dilatation. Our results suggest that heat therapy is a promising therapeutic tool that should be optimized further, via mode and dose, for the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular disease risk factors. ABSTRACT: Lifelong sauna exposure is associated with reduced cardiovascular disease risk. Recent studies have investigated the effect of heat therapy on markers of cardiovascular health. We aimed to conduct a systematic review with meta-analysis to determine the effects of heat therapy on blood pressure and indices of vascular function in healthy and clinical populations. Four databases were searched up to September 2020 for studies investigating heat therapy on outcomes including blood pressure and vascular function. Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations (GRADE) was used to assess the certainty of evidence. A total of 4522 titles were screened, and 15 studies were included. Healthy and clinical populations were included. Heat exposure was for 30-90 min, over 10-36 sessions. Compared with control conditions, heat therapy reduced mean arterial pressure [n = 4 studies; mean difference (MD): -5.86 mmHg, 95% confidence interval (CI): -8.63, -3.10; P < 0.0001], systolic blood pressure (n = 10; MD: -3.94 mmHg, 95% CI: -7.22, -0.67; P = 0.02) and diastolic blood pressure (n = 9; MD: -3.88 mmHg, 95% CI: -6.13, -1.63; P = 0.0007) and improved flow-mediated dilatation (n = 5; MD: 1.95%, 95% CI: 0.14, 3.76; P = 0.03). Resting heart rate was unchanged (n = 10; MD: -1.25 beats/min; 95% CI: -3.20, 0.70; P = 0.21). Early evidence also suggests benefits for arterial stiffness and cutaneous microvascular function. The certainty of evidence was moderate for the effect of heat therapy on systolic and diastolic blood pressure and heart rate and low for the effect of heat therapy on mean arterial pressure and flow-mediated dilatation. Heat therapy is an effective therapeutic tool to reduce blood pressure and improve macrovascular function. Future research should aim to optimize heat therapy, including the mode and dose, for the prevention and management of cardiovascular disease.",

      "abstract": "Peripheral artery disease (PAD) is characterized by the development of atherosclerotic plaques in the lower-body conduit arteries. PAD is commonly accompanied by microvascular disease, which may result in poor wound healing, plantar ulcer development, and subsequent limb amputation. Understanding the mechanisms underlying the development of plantar ulcers is a critical step in the development of adequate treatment options for patients with PAD. Skin is classified into two major components: glabrous and non-glabrous. These skin types have unique microcirculation characteristics, making it important to differentiate between the two when investigating mechanisms for plantar ulcer development in PAD. There is evidence for a microcirculation compensatory mechanism in PAD. This is evident by the maintenance of basal microcirculation perfusion and capillary filling pressure despite a reduced pressure differential beyond an occlusion in non-critical limb ischemia PAD. The major mechanism for this compensatory system seems to be progressive vasodilation of the arterial network below an occlusion. Recently, heat therapies have emerged as novel treatment options for attenuating the progression of PAD. Heat therapies are capable of stimulating the cardiovascular system, which may lead to beneficial adaptations that may ultimately reduce fatigue during walking in PAD. Early work in this area has shown that full-body heating is capable of generating an acute cardiovascular response, similar to exercise, which has been suggested as the most efficient treatment modality and may generate adaptations with chronic exposure. Heat therapies may emerge as a conservative treatment option capable of attenuating the progression of PAD and ultimately impeding the development of plantar ulcers.",

Heat therapy is an emerging cardiovascular therapy, which may improve walking in patients with IC. We undertook a systematic review to establish current evidence for heat therapy for patients with IC. We searched five databases (Ovid Medline / PubMed, Embase, Scopus / Web of Science, Cochrane Library and Health Technology Assessment Databases). A total of 6751 records were screened with 76 full-text articles assessed for eligibility. We included three randomised control trials and three acute interventions. For chronic interventions, three different heat therapy interventions were used. The 6-minute walk distance significantly improved following whole-body immersion (p = 0.03; ES 0.94, 95% CI: 0.06-1.82), but not after Waon therapy or a water-perfused garment. Ankle-brachial pressure indices were significantly improved following whole-body immersion (p = 0.01; ES 1.10, 95% CI: 0.20-1.99) but not after other therapies. No form of heat therapy demonstrated statistical improvements in quality of life or brachial blood pressure. Acute interventions were characterised by large increases in limb blood flow and core temperature, and transient reductions in blood pressure post-heating. At present there are only three randomised controlled trials assessing heat therapy for patients with IC. Moreover, each of those randomised controlled trials utilised different heat therapies. There is also very limited study of the acute physiological responses to different heat therapy interventions in these populations. Future research should establish appropriate heat therapy protocols and implement more randomised trials to understand its effectiveness. PROSPERO: CRD42020187941.",

      "abstract": "Lower-extremity peripheral artery disease (PAD) is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular events and impaired exercise tolerance. We have previously reported that leg heat therapy (HT) applied using liquid-circulating trousers perfused with warm water increases leg blood flow and reduces blood pressure (BP) and the circulating levels of endothelin-1 (ET-1) in patients with symptomatic PAD. In this sham-controlled, randomized, crossover study, sixteen patients with symptomatic PAD (age 65 ± 5.7 years and ankle-brachial index: 0.69 ± 0.1) underwent a single 90-min session of HT or a sham treatment prior to a symptom-limited, graded cardiopulmonary exercise test on the treadmill. The primary outcome was the peak walking time (PWT) during the exercise test. Secondary outcomes included the claudication onset time (COT), resting and exercise BP, calf muscle oxygenation, pulmonary oxygen uptake (V̇O2 ), and plasma levels of ET-1, interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α). Systolic, but not diastolic BP, was significantly lower (~7 mmHg, p < .05) during HT when compared to the sham treatment. There was also a trend for lower SBP throughout the exercise and the recovery period following HT (p = .057). While COT did not differ between treatments (p = .77), PWT tended to increase following HT (CON: 911 ± 69 s, HT: 954 ± 77 s, p = .059). Post-exercise plasma levels of ET-1 were also lower in the HT session (CON: 2.0 ± 0.1, HT: 1.7 ± 0.1, p = .02). Calf muscle oxygenation, V̇O2 , COT, IL-6, and TNF-α did not differ between treatments. A single session of leg HT lowers BP and post-exercise circulating levels of ET-1 and may enhance treadmill walking performance in symptomatic PAD patients.",

      "abstract": "Heat therapy (HT) has emerged as a potential adjunctive therapy to alleviate the symptoms of peripheral artery disease (PAD), but the mechanisms underlying the positive effects of this treatment modality remain undefined. Using a model of diet-induced obesity (DIO) and ischemia-induced muscle damage, we tested the hypothesis that HT would alter body composition, promote vascular growth and mitochondrial biogenesis, and improve skeletal muscle function. Male DIO C57Bl/6J mice underwent bilateral ligation of the femoral artery and were randomly allocated to receive HT or a control intervention for 30 min daily over 3 wk. When compared with a group of lean, sham-operated animals, ligated DIO mice exhibited increases in body and fat masses, exercise intolerance, and contractile dysfunction of the isolated soleus (SOL) and extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscles. Repeated HT averted an increase in body mass induced by high-fat feeding due to reduced fat accrual. Fat mass was ∼25% and 29% lower in the HT group relative to controls after 2 and 3 wk of treatment, respectively. Muscle mass relative to body mass and maximal absolute force of the EDL, but not SOL, were higher in animals exposed to HT. There were no group differences in skeletal muscle capillarization, the expression of angiogenic factors, mitochondrial content, and the diameter of the gracilis arteries. These findings indicate that HT reduces diet-induced fat accumulation and rescues skeletal muscle contractile dysfunction. This practical treatment may prove useful for diabetic and obese PAD patients who are unable to undergo conventional exercise regimens.NEW & NOTEWORTHY The epidemic of obesity-related dyslipidemia and diabetes is a central cause of the increasing burden of peripheral artery disease (PAD), but few accessible therapies exist to mitigate the metabolic and functional abnormalities in these patients. We report that daily exposure to heat therapy (HT) in the form of lower-body immersion in water heated to 39 °C for 3 weeks attenuates fat accumulation and weight gain, and improves muscle strength in obese mice with femoral artery occlusion.",

The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of 6 weeks of localized heating on skeletal muscle strength, volume and contractile properties in healthy humans. METHODS: Fifteen active participants (8 males/7 females, 35 ± 6 years, 70 ± 14 kg, 173 ± 7 cm, average training of 87 min per week) were subjected to 6 weeks of single-leg heat therapy. Heat pads were applied for 8 h/day, 5 days/week, on one randomly selected calf of each participant, while the contralateral leg acted as control. The heat pads increased muscle temperature by 4.6 ± 1.2 °C (p < 0.001). Every 2 weeks, participants were tested for morphological (MRI), architectural (ultrasound), contractile (electrically evoked twitch), and force (isometric and isokinetic) adaptations. RESULTS: Repeated localized heating did not affect the cross-sectional area (p = 0.873) or pennation angle (p = 0.345) of the gastrocnemius muscles; did not change the evoked peak twitch amplitude (p = 0.574) or rate of torque development (p = 0.770) of the plantar flexors; and did not change maximal voluntary isometric (p = 0.214) or isokinetic (p = 0.973) plantar flexor torque. CONCLUSION: Whereas previous studies have observed improved skeletal muscle function following whole-body and localized heating in active and immobilized humans, respectively, the current data suggested that localized heating may not be a potent stimulus for muscle adaptations in active humans.",

An emerging body of evidence suggests that targeting the autophagic pathway via passive heating (heat therapy) may stimulate autophagic function. Therefore, the primary focus of the present review is to analyze the mechanisms in which passive heating induces autophagy as defined by in vitro and in vivo (animal and human) models. Our secondary focus is to examine the implications of utilizing passive heating to restore dysfunctional autophagy in chronic disease and aging. Finally, we discuss potential therapeutic strategies to implement passive heating to stimulate autophagic function in humans.",

      "abstract": "A single session of leg heat therapy (HT) has been shown to elicit increases in leg blood flow and reduce blood pressure (BP) and the circulating levels of endothelin-1 (ET-1) in patients with symptomatic peripheral artery disease (PAD). We assessed whether 6 wk of supervised leg HT (3 times/wk) with water-circulating trousers perfused with water at 48°C improved 6-min walk distance in individuals with PAD compared with a sham treatment. Secondary outcomes included the assessment of leg vascular function, BP, quality of life, and serum ET-1 and nitrite plus nitrate (NOx) levels. Of 32 PAD patients randomized, 30 [age: 68 ± 8 yr; ankle-brachial index (ABI): 0.6 ± 0.1] completed the 3- and 6-wk follow-ups. Participants completed 98.7% of the treatment sessions. Compared with the sham treatment, exposure to HT did not improve 6-min walk distance, BP, popliteal artery reactive hyperemia, cutaneous microvascular reactivity, resting ABI, or serum NOx levels. The change from baseline to 6 wk in scores of the physical functioning subscale of the 36-item Short Form Health Survey was significantly higher in the HT group (control -6.9 ± 10 vs. HT 6.8 ± 15; 95% confidence interval: 2.5-24.3, P = 0.017). Similarly, the change in ET-1 levels after 6 wk was different between groups, with the HT group experiencing a 0.4 pg/mL decrease (95% confidence interval: -0.8-0.0, P = 0.03). These preliminary results indicate that leg HT may improve perceived physical function in symptomatic PAD patients. Additional, larger studies are needed to confirm these findings and determine the optimal treatment regimen for symptomatic PAD patients.NEW & NOTEWORTHY This is the first sham-controlled study to investigate the effects of leg heat therapy (HT) on walking performance, vascular function, and quality of life in patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD). Adherence to HT was high, and the treatment was well tolerated.

      "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disease, yet there are no disease-modifying treatments available and there is no cure. It is becoming apparent that metabolic and vascular conditions such as type 2 diabetes (T2D) and hypertension promote the development and accumulation of Alzheimer's disease-related dementia pathologies. To this end, aerobic exercise, which is a common lifestyle intervention for both metabolic disease and hypertension, is shown to improve brain health during both healthy aging and dementia. However, noncompliance or other barriers to exercise response are common in exercise treatment paradigms. In addition, reduced intracellular proteostasis and mitochondrial function could contribute to the etiology of AD. Specifically, compromised chaperone systems [i.e., heat shock protein (HSP) systems] can contribute to protein aggregates (i.e., β-amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles) and reduced mitochondrial quality control (i.e., mitophagy). Therefore, novel therapies that target whole body metabolism, the vasculature, and chaperone systems (like HSPs) are needed to effectively treat AD. This review focuses on the role of heat therapy in the treatment and prevention of AD. Heat therapy has been independently shown to reduce whole body insulin resistance, improve vascular function, activate interorgan cross talk via endocytic vesicles, and activate HSPs to improve mitochondrial function and proteostasis in a variety of tissues. Thus, heat therapy could offer immense clinical benefit to patients suffering from AD. Importantly, future studies in patients are needed to determine the safety and efficacy of heat therapy in preventing AD.",

The objective of this study was to search for associations between skin surface temperature and pressure pain tolerance thresholds (PPTs) of healthy individuals undergoing cryotherapy and thermotherapy. METHODS: This is an experimental clinical trial with 22 healthy university students aged between 18 and 35 years. Volunteers underwent thermography and algometry assessments at 6 points in both knees before, immediately after, and 20 minutes after the application of frozen (cryotherapy) or heated (thermotherapy) gel bags in the right knee for 20 minutes. Data were analyzed by 1-way analysis of variance, Student's t test, and Pearson or Spearman correlation tests. RESULTS: There was a significant change in skin surface temperature after cryotherapy and thermotherapy, which was maintained after 20 minutes of withdrawal (P < .001). After the intervention, no significant differences were observed regarding the PPT compared to the baseline measurements, nor between the experimental and control knees. CONCLUSION: Cryotherapy and thermotherapy produced significant changes in the temperature of the evaluated points after their application. Despite this, no differences in pain tolerance were observed, and there was little association between skin surface temperature and PPT in the knees of healthy women after application of the resources."

      "abstract": "The therapeutic effects of heat have been harnessed for centuries to treat skeletal muscle disorders and other pathologies. However, the fundamental mechanisms underlying the well-documented clinical benefits associated with heat therapy (HT) remain poorly defined. Foundational studies in cultured skeletal muscle and endothelial cells, as well as in rodents, revealed that episodic exposure to heat stress activates a number of intracellular signaling networks and promotes skeletal muscle remodeling. Renewed interest in the physiology of HT in recent years has provided greater understanding of the signals and molecular players involved in the skeletal muscle adaptations to episodic exposures to HT. It is increasingly clear that heat stress promotes signaling mechanisms involved in angiogenesis, muscle hypertrophy, mitochondrial biogenesis, and glucose metabolism through not only elevations in tissue temperature but also other perturbations, including increased intramyocellular calcium and enhanced energy turnover. The few available translational studies seem to indicate that the earlier observations in rodents also apply to human skeletal muscle. Indeed, recent findings revealed that both local and whole-body HT may promote capillary growth, enhance mitochondrial content and function, improve insulin sensitivity and attenuate disuse-induced muscle wasting. This accumulating body of work implies that HT may be a practical treatment to combat skeletal abnormalities in individuals with chronic disease who are unwilling or cannot participate in traditional exercise-training regimens.",

Pharmacologic options are not universally effective and side effects are common. Objective data regarding non-pharmacologic treatment is limited. The study objective was to evaluate the efficacy of the MMF07 foot massager and heat therapy on the severity of RLS symptoms. METHODS: In this pilot randomized controlled trial, twenty-eight patients with diagnosed, bothersome RLS were randomized to four treatment arms: no active intervention (n = 7), foot massager (n = 8), heat therapy (n = 6), and foot massager plus heat therapy (n = 7). Participants completed the RLS Severity Scale, RLS Quality of Life questionnaire, and the Medical Outcomes Study Sleep scale at the baseline visit and at the 4-week follow up visit. RESULTS: Four weeks post randomization, participants in the massager group had significant improvement in the RLS severity score (average difference: -9.0, 95% CI: -16.3, -1.7, p = 0.017) and sleep scale (average difference: -22.0, 95% CI: -36.5, -7.5, p = 0.005) compared to the no intervention group. The heat alone group had a significant improvement in the sleep scale compared to the no-intervention group (average difference: -17.4, 95% CI: -32.5, -2.3, p = 0.026). Quality of life improved in the massage only group compared to control (average difference 25.3, 95% CI: -2.4, 53.0, p = 0.072). CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that the MMF07 foot massage device and heat therapy may be feasible and effective treatment options to improve RSL symptoms.",

A systematic review and meta-analysis regarding the effects of thermal therapy on HF was done by searching PubMed, Ovid Medline, Ovid Embase, Scopus, and internal databases up to date (2019). Improvement in the New York Heart Association (NYHA) class: Ten studies with 310 patients showed significant improvement in NYHA class. Only 7 among 40 patients remained in Class IV and 99 patients in Class III from 155 patients. Increased patients in lower classes indicate that more patients showed improvement. Sixteen studies on 506 patients showed an overall improvement of 4.4% of left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). Four studies reported improved endothelial dysfunction by 1.7% increase in flow-mediated dilation (FMD) on 130 patients. Reduction in blood pressure: Thermal therapy reduced both systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure by 3.1% and 5.31%, respectively, in 431 patients of 15 studies. Decrease in cardiothoracic ratio (CTR): Eight studies reported an average of 5.55% reduction of CTR in a total of 347 patients. Improvement in oxidative stress markers: Plasma brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels significantly decreased (mean difference of 14.8 pg/dL) in 303 patients of 9 studies. Improvement of quality of life: Among 65 patients, thermal therapy reduced cardiac death and rehospitalization by 31.3%. A slight increase in core body temperature is a promising, noninvasive, effective, and complementary therapy for patients with HF. Further clinical studies are recommended.",

      "abstract": "Neurodegenerative diseases involve the progressive deterioration of structures within the central nervous system responsible for motor control, cognition, and autonomic function. Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease are among the most common neurodegenerative disease and have an increasing prevalence over the age of 50. Central in the pathophysiology of these neurodegenerative diseases is the loss of protein homeostasis, resulting in misfolding and aggregation of damaged proteins. An element of the protein homeostasis network that prevents the dysregulation associated with neurodegeneration is the role of molecular chaperones. Heat shock proteins (HSPs) are chaperones that regulate the aggregation and disaggregation of proteins in intracellular and extracellular spaces, and evidence supports their protective effect against protein aggregation common to neurodegenerative diseases. Consequently, upregulation of HSPs, such as HSP70, may be a target for therapeutic intervention for protection against neurodegeneration. A novel therapeutic intervention to increase the expression of HSP may be found in heat therapy and/or heat acclimation. In healthy populations, these interventions have been shown to increase HSP expression. Elevated HSP may have central therapeutic effects, preventing or reducing the toxicity of protein aggregation, and/or peripherally by enhancing neuromuscular function. Broader physiological responses to heat therapy have also been identified and include improvements in muscle function, cerebral blood flow, and markers of metabolic health. These outcomes may also have a significant benefit for people with neurodegenerative disease. While there is limited research into body warming in patient populations, regular passive heating (sauna bathing) has been associated with a reduced risk of developing neurodegenerative disease. Therefore, the emerging evidence is compelling and warrants further investigation of the potential benefits of heat acclimation and passive heat therapy for sufferers of neurodegenerative diseases."

Twelve young adults (23.6 ± 4.8 yr, body mass index 24.9 ± 3.0 kg/m2) had one randomly selected thigh treated with HT (garment perfused with water at ~52°C) for 8 consecutive weeks (90 min, 5 days/wk) while the opposite thigh served as a control. Biopsies were obtained from the vastus lateralis muscle before and after 4 and 8 wk of treatment. Knee extensor strength and fatigue resistance were also assessed using isokinetic dynamometry. The changes in peak isokinetic torque were higher (P = 0.007) in the thigh exposed to HT than in the control thigh at weeks 4 (control 4.2 ± 13.1 Nm vs. HT 9.1 ± 16.1 Nm) and 8 (control 1.8 ± 9.7 Nm vs. HT 7.8 ± 10.2 Nm). Exposure to HT averted a temporal decline in capillarization around type II fibers (P < 0.05), but had no effect on capillarization indexes in type I fibers. The content of endothelial nitric oxide synthase was ~18% and 35% higher in the thigh exposed to HT at 4 and 8 wk, respectively (P = 0.003). Similarly, HT increased the content of small heat shock proteins HSPB5 (P = 0.007) and HSPB1 (P = 0.009). There were no differences between thighs for the changes in fiber cross-sectional area and mitochondrial content. These results indicate that exposure to local HT for 8 wk promotes a proangiogenic environment and enhances muscle strength but does not affect mitochondrial content in humans.NEW & NOTEWORTHY We demonstrate that repeated application of heat therapy to the thigh with a garment perfused with warm water enhances the strength of knee extensors and influences muscle capillarization in parallel with increases in the content of endothelial nitric oxide synthase and small heat shock proteins. This practical method of passive heat stress may be a feasible tool to treat conditions associated with capillary rarefaction and muscle weakness.",

This study aimed to evaluate and compare the effects of ultrasound heat therapy and low-level laser therapy (LLLT) in reducing TMD-related pain. METHODS: This prospective study included 42 patients (age range, 25-45 years), who were divided into two groups of 21 patients each. All patients were prescribed a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) twice a day for 5 days for temporary relief of pain prior to the commencement of treatment. Patients were kept on a soft diet and asked to restrict mouth opening during the same period. Fifteen sessions of LLLT (Group A) or ultrasound therapy (Group B) were administered to the affected side. RESULTS: Post-therapy, the mean visual analog scale score for group A and group B was 4.81 (2.01) and 6.19 (1.20), respectively; the difference was statistically significant and favoring the LLLT group. Similarly, the mean mouth opening for group A and group B was 3.99 (0.40) and 3.65 (0.41), respectively; the difference was statistically significant and favoring the LLLT group. CONCLUSION: Our study recommends LLLT for treating TMD-related pain with no underlying bony pathology."

      "abstract": "Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) affects up to 15% of women and is associated with increased risk of obesity and cardiovascular disease. Repeated passive heat exposure [termed \"heat therapy\" (HT)] is a lifestyle intervention with the potential to reduce cardiovascular risk in obesity and PCOS. Women with obesity (n = 18) with PCOS [age 27 ± 4 yr, body mass index (BMI) 41.3 ± 4.7 kg/m2] were matched for age and BMI, then assigned to HT (n = 9) or time control (CON; n = 9). HT subjects underwent 30 one-hour hot tub sessions over 8-10 wk, whereas CON subjects did not undergo HT. Muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA), blood pressure, cholesterol, C-reactive protein, and markers of vascular function were assessed at the start (Pre) and end (Post) of 8-10 wk. These measures included carotid and femoral artery wall thickness and flow-mediated dilation (FMD), measured both before and after 20 min of ischemia-20 min of reperfusion (I/R) stress. HT subjects exhibited reduced MSNA burst frequency (Pre: 20 ± 8 bursts/min, Post: 13 ± 5 bursts/min, P = 0.012), systolic (Pre: 124 ± 5 mmHg, Post: 114 ± 6 mmHg; P < 0.001) and diastolic blood pressure (Pre: 77 ± 6 mmHg, Post: 68 ± 3 mmHg; P < 0.001), C-reactive protein (Pre: 19.4 ± 13.7 nmol/L, Post: 15.2 ± 12.3 nmol/L; P = 0.018), total cholesterol (Pre: 5.4 ± 1.1 mmol/L, Post: 5.0 ± 0.8 mmol/L; P = 0.028), carotid wall thickness (Pre: 0.054 ± 0.005 cm, Post: 0.044 ± 0.005 cm; P = 0.010), and femoral wall thickness (Pre: 0.056 ± 0.009 cm, Post: 0.042 ± 0.005 cm; P = 0.003). FMD significantly improved in HT subjects over time following I/R (Pre: 5.6 ± 2.5%, Post: 9.5 ± 1.7%; P < 0.001). No parameters changed over time in CON, and BMI did not change in either group. These findings indicate that HT reduces sympathetic nerve activity, provides protection from I/R stress, and substantially improves cardiovascular risk profiles in women who are obese with PCOS.",

Objective: To determine the isolated effects of circulating (serum) factors on endothelial cell function, particularly angiogenesis, and NO bioavailability. Methods and Results: Cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were exposed to serum collected from 20 healthy young (22 ± 1 years) adults before (0 wk), after one session of water immersion (Acute HT), and after 8 wk of either heat therapy (N = 10; 36 sessions of hot water immersion; session 1 peak rectal temperature: 39.0 ± 0.03°C) or sham (N = 10; 36 sessions of thermoneutral water immersion). Serum collected following acute heat exposure and heat therapy improved endothelial cell angiogenesis (Matrigel bioassay total tubule length per frame, 0 wk: 69.3 ± 1.9 mm vs. Acute HT: 72.8 ± 1.4 mm, p = 0.04; vs. 8 wk: 73.0 ± 1.4 mm, p = 0.03), with no effects of sham serum. Enhanced angiogenesis was NO-mediated, as addition of the NO synthase (NOS) inhibitor L-NNA to the culture media abolished differences in tubule formation across conditions (0 wk: 71.3 ± 1.8 mm, Acute HT: 71.6 ± 1.9 mm, 8 wk: 70.5 ± 1.6 mm, p = 0.69). In separate experiments, we found that abundance of endothelial NOS (eNOS) was unaffected by Acute HT serum (p = 0.71), but increased by 8 wk heat therapy serum (1.4 ± 0.1-fold from 0 wk, p < 0.01). Furthermore, increases in eNOS were related to improvements in endothelial tubule formation (r2 = 0.61, p < 0.01). Conclusions: Passive heat therapy beneficially alters circulating factors that promote NO-mediated angiogenesis in endothelial cells and increase eNOS abundance. These changes may contribute to improvements in vascular function with heat therapy observed in vivo.

      "abstract": "Leg muscle ischemia in patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD) leads to alterations in skeletal muscle morphology and reduced leg strength. We tested the hypothesis that exposure to heat therapy (HT) would improve skeletal muscle function in a mouse model of ischemia-induced muscle damage. Male 42-wk-old C57Bl/6 mice underwent ligation of the femoral artery and were randomly assigned to receive HT (immersion in a water bath at 37°C, 39°C, or 41°C for 30 min) or a control intervention for 3 wk. At the end of the treatment, the animals were anesthetized and the soleus and extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscles were harvested for the assessment of contractile function and examination of muscle morphology. A subset of animals was used to examine the impact of a single HT session on the expression of genes involved in myogenesis and the regulation of muscle mass. Relative soleus muscle mass was significantly higher in animals exposed to HT at 39°C compared with the control group (control: 0.36 ± 0.01 mg/g versus 39°C: 0.40 ± 0.01 mg/g, P = 0.024). Maximal absolute force of the soleus was also significantly higher in animals treated with HT at 37°C and 39°C (control: 274.7 ± 6.6 mN; 37°C: 300.1 ± 7.7 mN; 39°C: 299.5 ± 10 mN, P < 0.05). In the soleus, but not the EDL muscle, a single session of HT enhanced the mRNA expression of myogenic factors as well as of both positive and negative regulators of muscle mass. These findings suggest that the beneficial effects of HT are muscle specific and dependent on the treatment temperature in a model of PAD. NEW & NOTEWORTHY This is the first study to comprehensively examine the impact of temperature and muscle fiber type composition on the adaptations to repeated heat stress in a model of ischemia-induced muscle damage. Exposure to heat therapy (HT) at 37°C and 39°C, but not at 41°C, improved force development of the isolated soleus muscle. These results suggest that HT may be a practical therapeutic tool to restore muscle mass and strength in patients with peripheral artery disease.",

Repeated passive heat exposure (termed heat therapy) is a novel lifestyle intervention for improving health in obese women with PCOS. The purpose of this study was to examine changes in metabolic function in obese women with PCOS following heat therapy. Eighteen age- and BMI-matched obese women with PCOS (age: 27 ± 1 yr, BMI: 41.3 ± 1.1 kg/m-2) were assigned to heat therapy (HT) or time control (CON). HT participants underwent 30 one-hour hot tub sessions over 8-10 wk, while CON participants completed all testing but did not undergo heat therapy. Before (Pre), at the mid-point (Mid), and following (Post) 8-10 wk of heat therapy, metabolic health was assessed using a 2-h oral glucose tolerance test, a subcutaneous abdominal fat biopsy (Pre-Post only), and other blood markers relating to metabolic function. HT participants exhibited improved fasting glucose (Pre: 105 ± 3, Post: 89 ± 5mg/dl; P = 0.001), glucose area under the curve (AUC) (Pre: 18,698 ± 1,045, Post: 16,987 ± 1,017 mg·dl-1·min-1; P = 0.028) and insulin AUC (Pre: 126,924 ± 11,730, Post: 91,233 ± 14,429 IU l-1·min-1; P = 0.012).

Additionally, serum testosterone declined in HT participants (Pre: 51 ± 7, Post: 34 ± 4 ng/dl; P = 0.033). No parameters changed over time in CON, and no change in BMI was observed in either group.

This study aimed to make the first comparison of the effect of PHT and MICT on 1) skeletal muscle capillarization and endothelial-specific endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) content and 2) mitochondrial density, glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4), and intramuscular triglyceride (IMTG) content. Twenty young sedentary males (21 ± 1 yr, body mass index 25 ± 1 kg/m2) were allocated to either 6 wk of PHT (n = 10; 40-50 min at 40°C in a heat chamber, 3×/wk) or MICT (n = 10; time-matched cycling at ~65% V̇o2peak). Muscle biopsies were taken from the vastus lateralis muscle before and after training. Immunofluorescence microscopy was used to assess changes in skeletal muscle mitochondrial density (mitochondrial marker cytochrome c oxidase subunit 4), GLUT4, and IMTG content, capillarization, and endothelial-specific eNOS content. V̇o2peak and whole body insulin sensitivity were also assessed. PHT and MICT both increased capillary density (PHT 21%; MICT 12%), capillary-fiber perimeter exchange index (PHT 15%; MICT 12%) (P < 0.05), and endothelial-specific eNOS content (PHT 8%; MICT 12%) (P < 0.05). However, unlike MICT (mitochondrial density 40%; GLUT4 14%; IMTG content 70%) (P < 0.05), PHT did not increase mitochondrial density (11%, P = 0.443), GLUT4 (7%, P = 0.217), or IMTG content (1%, P = 0.957). Both interventions improved aerobic capacity (PHT 5%; MICT 7%) and whole body insulin sensitivity (PHT 15%; MICT 36%) (P < 0.05). Six-week PHT in young sedentary males increases skeletal muscle capillarization and eNOS content to a similar extent as MICT; however, unlike MICT, PHT does not affect skeletal muscle mitochondrial density, GLUT4, or IMTG content. NEW & NOTEWORTHY The effect of 6-wk passive heat therapy (PHT) compared with moderate-intensity continuous training (MICT) was investigated in young sedentary males. PHT induced similar increases in skeletal muscle capillarization and endothelial-specific endothelial nitric oxide synthase content to MICT. Unlike MICT, PHT did not improve skeletal muscle mitochondrial density, glucose transporter 4, or intramuscular triglyceride content. These microvascular adaptations were paralleled by improvements in V̇o2peak and insulin sensitivity, suggesting that microvascular adaptations may contribute to functional improvements following PHT.",

      "abstract": "Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is characterized by lower limb atherosclerosis impairing blood supply and causing walking-induced leg pain or claudication. Adherence to traditional exercise training programs is poor due to these symptoms despite exercise being a mainstay of conservative treatment. Heat therapy improves many cardiovascular health outcomes, so this study tested if this was a viable alternative cardiovascular therapy for PAD patients. Volunteers with PAD were randomized to 12 wk of heat (n = 11; mean age 76 ± 8 yr, BMI 28.7 ± 3.5 kg/m2, 4 females) or exercise (n = 11; 74 ± 10 yr, 28.5 ± 6.8 kg/m2, 3 females). Heat involved spa bathing at ∼39°C, 3-5 days/wk for ≤30 min, followed by ≤30 min of callisthenics. Exercise involved ≤90 min of supervised walking and gym-based exercise, 1-2 days/wk. Following the interventions, total walking distance during a 6-min walk test increased (from ∼350 m) by 41 m (95% CI: [13, 69], P = 0.006) regardless of group, and pain-free walking distance increased (from ∼170 m) by 43 m ([22, 63], P < 0.001). Systolic blood pressure was reduced more following heat (-7 mmHg, [-4, -10], P < 0.001) than following exercise (-3 mmHg, [0, -6], P = 0.078), and diastolic and mean arterial pressure decreased by 4 mmHg in both groups (P = 0.002). There were no significant changes in blood volume, ankle-brachial index, or measures of vascular health. There were no differences in the improvement in functional or blood pressure outcomes between heat and exercise in individuals with PAD. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Heat therapy via hot-water immersion and supervised exercise both improved walking distance and resting blood pressure in peripheral arterial disease (PAD) patients over 12 wk. Adherence to heat therapy was excellent, and the heat intervention was well tolerated. The results of the current study indicate that heat therapy can improve functional ability and has potential as an effective cardiovascular conditioning tool for individuals with PAD.",

Even though heat therapy has been commonly applied against viruses in many plants, its potential for phytoplasma eradication has been much less explored. Here, the efficacy of heat therapy with subsequent tissue culture to eliminate phytoplasmas from infected raspberry and blackberry plants is evaluated. Heat therapy was performed on 25 phytoplasma-infected raspberry and 33 infected blackberry plants, out of which 100 raspberry and 65 blackberry plants were regenerated via subsequent tissue culture. All plants were negative for the presence of phytoplasma DNA by qPCR at the end of cultivation periods of 481 to 565 days for the treated raspberry plants and 231 to 337 days for the treated blackberry plants.

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: Numerous devices have been developed to warm the eyelid as a therapy for Meibomian gland dysfunction. The optimum temperature for such therapy was determined. METHODS: Meibum lipid disorder versus temperature was calculated from previously published phase transition parameters measured using infrared spectroscopy. Phase transitions parameters were calculated from meibum obtained from donors with Meibomian gland dysfunction (MMGD), donors who were susceptible to dry eye after hematopoietic stem cell transplantations (MHSCT) and meibum from donors without dry eye (Mn). RESULTS: Heating Mn to 40 °C increases the lipid disorder by 20.4%-90%. Heating the meibum another 4° increases the disorder to 95%. MMGD is 73.2% disordered with no heating. Heating MMGD to 41.5 °C increases the disorder by 26.8%-90% disordered. Heating MMGD another 5.1 °C increases the disorder to 95%. As MHSCT is much more ordered, 56.9% disordered compared with Mn and MMGD, a higher temperature above safety limits, 52 and 59 °C is need to disorder MHSCT to 90 and 95% disorder. CONCLUSIONS: Heating the eye lid above the phase transition temperature of meibum increases the disorder of meibum lipid which could ameliorate dry eye symptoms. The optimum temperature for disordering Mn and MMGD to 90% maximum disorder is 40 and 41.5 °C, respectively. Safety issues and discomfort should be considered in obtaining an optimal level of disorder, especially for severe cases of dry eye.",

Eleven untrained individuals (23.8 ± 0.6 yr) performed 300 bilateral maximal eccentric contractions of the knee extensors. One randomly selected thigh was treated with five daily 90-min sessions of HT, whereas the opposite thigh received a thermoneutral intervention. Peak isokinetic torque of the knee extensors was assessed at baseline and daily for 4 days and fatigue resistance was assessed at baseline and 1 and 4 days after the eccentric exercise session. Muscle biopsies were obtained 2 wk before and 1 and 5 days after the eccentric exercise bout. There were no differences between thighs in the overall recovery profile of peak torque. However, the thigh exposed to HT had greater fatigue resistance than the thigh exposed to the thermoneutral intervention. The change from baseline in mRNA expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) was higher at day 1 in the thigh exposed to HT. Protein levels of VEGF and angiopoietin 1 were also significantly higher in the thigh treated with HT. The number of capillaries around type II fibers decreased similarly in both thighs at day 5. Exposure to HT had no impact on macrophage content. These results suggest that HT accelerates the recovery of fatigue resistance after eccentric exercise and promotes the expression of angiogenic factors in human skeletal muscle. NEW & NOTEWORTHY We investigated whether exposure to local heat therapy (HT) accelerates recovery after a bout of eccentric exercise in humans. Compared with a thermoneutral control intervention, HT improved fatigue resistance of the knee extensors and enhanced the expression of the angiogenic mediators vascular endothelial growth factor and angiopoietin 1. These results suggest that HT hastens functional recovery and enhances the expression of regulatory factors involved in muscle repair after eccentric exercise in humans.",

      "abstract": "Primary dysmenorrhea, which is menstrual pain without pelvic pathology, is the most common gynecologic condition in women. Heat therapy has been used as a treatment. We assessed the evidence on heat therapy as a treatment for primary dysmenorrhea. We searched 11 databases for studies published through July 2018. All randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that addressed heat therapy for patients with primary dysmenorrhea were included. Data extraction and risk-of-bias assessments were performed by two independent reviewers. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool. Six RCTs met our inclusion criteria. Two RCTs found favorable effects of heat therapy on menstrual pain compared with unheated placebo therapy. Three RCTs found favorable effects of heating pads on menstrual pain compared with analgesic medication (n = 274; SMD -0.72; 95% confidence interval -0.97 to -0.48; P < 0.001; two studies). One RCT showed beneficial effects of heat therapy on menstrual pain compared with no treatment (n = 132; MD -4.04 VAS; 95% CI -4.88 to -3.20; P < 0.001). However, these results are based on relatively few trials with small sample sizes. Our review provided suggestive evidence of the effectiveness of heat therapy for primary dysmenorrhea, but rigorous high-quality trials are still needed to provide robust evidence.",

      "abstract": "KEY POINTS: Accumulating evidence indicates that passive heat therapy (chronic use of hot tubs or saunas) has widespread physiological benefits, including enhanced resistance against novel stressors ('stress resistance'). Using a cell culture model to isolate the key stimuli that are likely to underlie physiological adaptation with heat therapy, we showed that both mild elevations in temperature (to 39°C) and exposure to serum from human subjects who have undergone 8 weeks of heat therapy (i.e. altered circulating factors) independently prevented oxidative and inflammatory stress associated with hypoxia-reoxygenation in cultured endothelial cells. Our results elucidate some of the mechanisms (i.e. direct effects of temperature vs. circulating factors) by which heat therapy seems to improve resistance against oxidative and inflammatory stress. Heat therapy may be a promising intervention for reducing cellular damage following ischaemic events, which has broad implications for patients with cardiovascular diseases and conditions characterized by 'chronic' ischaemia (e.g. peripheral artery disease, metabolic diseases, obesity). ABSTRACT: Repeated exposure to passive heat stress ('heat therapy') has widespread physiological benefits, including cellular protection against novel stressors. Increased heat shock protein (HSP) expression and upregulation of circulating factors may impart this protection. We tested the isolated abilities of mild heat pretreatment and serum from human subjects (n = 10) who had undergone 8 weeks of heat therapy to protect against cellular stress following hypoxia-reoxygenation (H/R), a model of ischaemic cardiovascular events. Cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells were incubated for 24 h at 37°C (control), 39°C (heat pretreatment) or 37°C with 10% serum collected before and after 8 weeks of passive heat therapy (four to five times per week to increase rectal temperature to ≥ 38.5°C for 60 min). Cells were then collected before and after incubation at 1% O2 for 16 h (hypoxia; 37°C), followed by 20% O2 for 4 h (reoxygenation; 37°C) and assessed for markers of cell stress. In control cells, H/R increased nuclear NF-κB p65 protein (i.e. activation) by 106 ± 38%, increased IL-6 release by 37 ± 8% and increased superoxide production by 272 ± 45%. Both heat pretreatment and exposure to heat therapy serum prevented H/R-induced NF-κB activation and attenuated superoxide production; by contrast, only exposure to serum attenuated IL-6 release. H/R also decreased cytoplasmic haemeoxygenase-1 (HO-1) protein (known to suppress NF-κB), in control cells (-25 ± 8%), whereas HO-1 protein increased following H/R in cells pretreated with heat or serum-exposed, providing a possible mechanism of protection against H/R. These data indicate heat therapy is capable of imparting resistance against inflammatory and oxidative stress via direct heat and humoral factors.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The beneficial effects of thermotherapy on analgesia and relaxation are widely known for various diseases. To date, however, thermotherapy in chronic low back pain is not explicitly recommended in international guidelines. The effects of thermotherapy on biomechanical parameters within a multimodal back pain treatment concept are also unknown. METHODS: Within a multimodal treatment concept, 176 patients with chronic low back pain were treated either with or without supplemental heat wrap therapy. The range of movement and strength parameters of the trunk in flexion, extension, lateral flexion and rotation were measured before and after 12 weeks of treatment. FINDINGS: The range of movement as well as strength parameters of the trunk improved on average within the multimodal treatment. Patients receiving additional thermotherapy supplemental to basic multimodal treatment showed a further improvement of strength parameters regarding extension (P = 0.09, 1 - β = 0.41), rotation to the right (P = 0.09, 1 - β = 0.41) and rotation to the left (P = 0.08, 1 - β = 0.42) in comparison to those conducting only the multimodal treatment. No group differences were detected in flexibility. INTERPRETATION: The implementation of thermotherapy for several hours a day (heat wrap therapy) in daily clinical practice additional to an individualized, evidence-based multimodal treatment concept can be recommended to enhance strength parameters. The potential causes of improved strength parameters as well as the meaning for the patients in activity of daily living are discussed.",

      "abstract": "Obesity and associated metabolic dysfunction have reached epidemic proportions worldwide. The current theory linking metabolic disease and obesity involves ischemic adipose tissue initiating an inflammatory cascade that results in systemic insulin resistance and may eventually lead to type II diabetes mellitus. Diabetes and associated metabolic dysfunction increase the risk of developing cardiovascular disease and fatal cardiovascular events. By targeting key steps in this process, ischemia and inflammation, this cascade may be prevented or reversed and thus metabolic and cardiovascular health may be preserved in obesity. Regular heat exposure (termed 'heat therapy') offers potential to improve cardiometabolic health in obese individuals through a variety of mechanisms that include but are not limited to heat shock proteins, hypoxia-inducible factor 1α, and hemodynamic effects. The purpose of this review is to highlight the cardiometabolic decline in obese individuals stemming from adipose tissue dysfunction, and examine the ways in which heat therapy and associated cellular and systemic adaptations can intersect with this decline in function to improve or restore cardiovascular and metabolic health."

      "abstract": "The present research evaluated the efficiency of a control approach to control the temperature of a breast tumor mass in the presence of nanoparticles exposed to laser radiation. However, if the radiation is carried out in open loop manner it may result in excessive temperature rise healthy cells that exist in the vicinity of tumor's cells. This may lead to the death of healthy cells. So, using closed loop control methods is necessary to guarantee the preservation of healthy cells during the period of radiation. Therefore, in this study, an artificial neural network was trained as a controller. In other words, the trained neural network adjusted the laser power over a period of time in such a way that the temperature in the center of the tumor reached the desired level with an appropriate temporal behavior. The difference between the real temperature of the tumor and the desired temperature of it is the controller input, while the controller output determined the amount of laser power. The simulation studies were carried out using an appropriate physiological model in the presence of nanoparticles. First, Schrödinger equations were solved followed by the effective mass equation. Afterward the optimum number of nanoparticles to be used in the IR field was calculated. Next, the important electro-optical features related to the nanostructure, such as the absorption continuum and reflection continuum had been calculated. The neural network proposed controller was then evaluated through other simulation studies in the tumor mass model. The results showed a promising performance by the trained artificial neural network in adjusting radiated laser power for the desired temperature increase in the center of a tumor mass.",

The pain score was recorded by using Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) before the intervention and every 30 min in three groups until cervical dilatation reached 8 cm. RESULTS: The mean pain severity score in the heat therapy group was less than that of in control group at 60 and 90 min after intervention (p < 0.05). In addition there were significantly differences between the pain scores in the birth ball group after all three investigated times in comparison to control group.

Eighteen young, sedentary, otherwise healthy subjects participated in 8 wk of heat therapy (hot water immersion to maintain rectal temperature ≥38.5°C for 60 min/session; n = 9) or thermoneutral water immersion (sham, n = 9), and participated in experiments before and after the 8-wk intervention in which forearm cutaneous hyperemia to 39°C local heating was assessed at three microdialysis sites receiving 1) Lactated Ringer's (Control), 2) N(ω)-nitro-l-arginine (l-NNA; nonspecific NO synthase inhibitor), and 3) 4-hydroxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl (Tempol), a superoxide dismutase mimetic. The arm used for microdialysis experiments remained out of the water at all times. Data are means ± SE cutaneous vascular conductance (CVC = laser Doppler flux/mean arterial pressure), presented as percent maximal CVC (% CVCmax). Heat therapy increased local heating plateau from 42 ± 6 to 53 ± 6% CVCmax (P < 0.001) and increased NO-dependent dilation (difference in plateau between Control and l-NNA sites) from 26 ± 6 to 38 ± 4% CVCmax (P < 0.01), while no changes were observed in the sham group. When data were pooled across all subjects at 0 wk, Tempol had no effect on the local heating response (P = 0.53 vs. Control). There were no changes at the Tempol site across interventions (P = 0.58). Passive heat therapy improves cutaneous microvascular function by improving NO-dependent dilation, which may have clinical implications.",

      "abstract": "Heat therapy has been shown to promote capillary growth in skeletal muscle and in the heart in several animal models, but the effects of this therapy on angiogenic signaling in humans are unknown. We evaluated the acute effect of lower body heating (LBH) and unilateral thigh heating (TH) on the expression of angiogenic regulators and heat shock proteins (HSPs) in healthy young individuals. Exposure to LBH (n = 18) increased core temperature (Tc) from 36.9 ± 0.1 to 37.4 ± 0.1°C (P < 0.01) and average leg skin temperature (Tleg) from 33.1 ± 0.1 to 39.6 ± 0.1°C (P < 0.01), but did not alter the levels of circulating angiogenic cytokines and bone marrow-derived proangiogenic cells (CD34(+)CD133(+)). In skeletal muscle, the change in mRNA expression from baseline of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), angiopoietin 2 (ANGPT2), chemokines CCL2 and CX3CL1, platelet factor-4 (PF4), and several members of the HSP family was higher 30 min after the intervention in the individuals exposed to LBH (n = 11) compared with the control group (n = 12). LBH also reduced the expression of transcription factor FOXO1 (P = 0.03). Exposure to TH (n = 14) increased Tleg from 32.8 ± 0.2 to 40.3 ± 0.1°C (P < 0.05) but Tc remained unaltered (36.8 ± 0.1°C at baseline and 36.9 ± 0.1°C at 90 min). This intervention upregulated the expression of VEGF, ANGPT1, ANGPT2, CCL2, and HSPs in skeletal muscle but did not affect the levels of CX3CL1, FOXO-1, and PF4. These findings suggest that both LBH and TH increase the expression of factors associated with capillary growth in human skeletal muscle.",

      "abstract": "KEY POINTS: A recent 30 year prospective study showed that lifelong sauna use reduces cardiovascular-related and all-cause mortality; however, the specific cardiovascular adaptations that cause this chronic protection are currently unknown. We investigated the effects of 8 weeks of repeated hot water immersion ('heat therapy') on various biomarkers of cardiovascular health in young, sedentary humans. We showed that, relative to a sham group which participated in thermoneutral water immersion, heat therapy increased flow-mediated dilatation, reduced arterial stiffness, reduced mean arterial and diastolic blood pressure, and reduced carotid intima media thickness, with changes all on par or greater than what is typically observed in sedentary subjects with exercise training. Our results show for the first time that heat therapy has widespread and robust effects on vascular function, and as such, could be a viable treatment option for improving cardiovascular health in a variety of patient populations, particularly those with limited exercise tolerance and/or capabilities. ABSTRACT: The majority of cardiovascular diseases are characterized by disorders of the arteries, predominantly caused by endothelial dysfunction and arterial stiffening. Intermittent hot water immersion ('heat therapy') results in elevations in core temperature and changes in cardiovascular haemodynamics, such as cardiac output and vascular shear stress, that are similar to exercise, and thus may provide an alternative means of improving health which could be utilized by patients with low exercise tolerance and/or capabilities. We sought to comprehensively assess the effects of 8 weeks of heat therapy on biomarkers of vascular function in young, sedentary subjects. Twenty young, sedentary subjects were assigned to participate in 8 weeks (4-5 times per week) of heat therapy (n = 10; immersion in a 40.5°C bath sufficient to maintain rectal temperature ≥ 38.5°C for 60 min per session) or thermoneutral water immersion (n = 10; sham). Eight weeks of heat therapy increased flow-mediated dilatation from 5.6 ± 0.3 to 10.9 ± 1.0% (P < 0.01) and superficial femoral dynamic arterial compliance from 0.06 ± 0.01 to 0.09 ±0.01 mm(2)  mmHg(-1) (P = 0.03), and reduced (i.e. improved) aortic pulse wave velocity from 7.1 ± 0.3 to 6.1 ± 0.3 m s(-1) (P = 0.03), carotid intima media thickness from 0.43 ± 0.01 to 0.37 ± 0.01 mm (P < 0.001), and mean arterial blood pressure from 83 ± 1 to 78 ± 2 mmHg (P = 0.02). No changes were observed in the sham group or for carotid arterial compliance, superficial femoral intima media thickness or endothelium-independent dilatation. Heat therapy improved endothelium-dependent dilatation, arterial stiffness, intima media thickness and blood pressure, indicating improved cardiovascular health. These data suggest heat therapy may provide a simple and effective tool for improving cardiovascular health in various populations.",

Design Randomized control trail. Methods One hundred and fifteen participants of both genders who were diagnosed as having grade I or II lateral ankle sprain were randomly assigned to the study on the fifth day of injury. Pain, volume, and ROM were recorded before and after treatment continuously for 3 days. Results Effects were evaluated as \"Immediately after application\" and \"3 days after continuous application.\" Immediately after application, there was no difference between the 2 modalities on ankle ROM; heat reduced pain over contrast therapy, and both modalities increased swelling. When considering the effects after continuous application for 3 days, no difference was found between the 2 modalities on ROM and the reduction of pain. Contrast therapy reduced swelling while heat caused increased swelling even after 3 days. Conclusion The use of different thermal modalities during the transition from the acute to chronic phase of injury can be suggested as effective treatment options according to the objectives of injury management: pain reduction, improve ROM, and swelling management.

The use of heat therapy in people with type 2 diabetes mellitus revealed a striking reduction of 1% unit in the glycated hemoglobin, suggesting this therapy for the treatment of diabetes. Herein, we shall discuss the use of heat therapy and the mechanisms involved, and suggest a provisional guide for the use of heat therapy in obesity and diabetes. RECENT FINDINGS: Human studies indicate that heat therapy reduces fasting glycemia, glycated hemoglobin, body weight, and adiposity. Animal studies have indicated that nitric oxide and the increase in heat shock protein 70 expression is involved in the improvements induced by heat therapy on insulin sensitivity, adiposity, inflammation, and vasomotricity. SUMMARY: Heat therapy is a promising and inexpensive tool for the treatment of obesity and diabetes. We proposed that transient increments in nitric oxide and heat shock protein 70 levels may explain the benefits of heat therapy. We suggest that heat therapy (sauna: 80-100°C; hot tub: at 40°C) for 15 min, three times a week, for 3 months, is a safe method to test its efficiency.",

METHODS: Forty-one subjects with mild-to-moderate dry eye symptoms were enrolled in a randomized, paired-eye, investigator-masked trial. Heat was applied simultaneously to one eye (randomized) with a portable eye mask (EyeGiene) and to the contralateral eye with a microwave-heated flaxseed eye bag (MGDRx Eye Bag). Outer and inner eyelid temperatures, tear film lipid layer grade (LLG), and noninvasive tear film breakup time (NIBUT) were measured at baseline and immediately after 10 minutes of device application. RESULTS: Outer and inner eyelid temperatures, LLG, and NIBUT did not differ before treatment between eyes assigned to eye mask and eye bag therapy. All measurements were significantly increased from baseline, after warming with both devices (all p < 0.05). Outer and inner eyelid temperature changes were significantly greater with the eye bag than with the eye mask (outer eyelid, +3.5 ± 1.0°C vs. +2.4 ± 0.8°C; inner eyelid, +3.5 ± 1.0°C vs. +2.5 ± 0.9°C; all p < 0.001), although there was no significant difference in LLG and NIBUT improvement between treatments (all p > 0.05). A majority of subjects (78%) preferred the application of heat with the eye bag over the eye mask. CONCLUSIONS: Both the EyeGiene mask and the MGDRx Eye Bag are convenient eyelid warming devices that result in clinically and statistically significant increases in NIBUT and LLG in patients with mild-to-moderate dry eye symptoms. The MGDRx Eye Bag is more effective in raising ocular temperature and is the preferred treatment method among subjects.",

METHOD: An open multicentre clinical trial directed from the School of Nursing at the University of Barcelona was carried out between 2009 and 2010 in 5 Catalan Hospitals. The sample consisted of 198 pregnant women subjected to the natural protocol for normal delivery assistance. The pregnant women were randomized to three study groups: moist heat (MHG), dry heat (DHG), and control (CG). Usual care of the perineum was performed during labour in all groups and MHG or GCS was also applied in the perineum in the intervention groups. The Apgar score in the newborn and perineum postpartum was then assessed. Statistical tests were performed using a 95% confidence interval. Statistical analyses were performed using the SPSS version 17. RESULTS: Perinea that required no suturing: MHG 71% (47) versus CG 56% (37), OR: 1.803; (95% CI: 0.881-3.687); DHG 62% (41) versus CG 56% (37), OR:1.285 (95% CI: 0.641-2.577); MHG 71% (47) versus DHG 62% (41), OR:1.402 (95% CI: 0.680-2.890). MEAN: Apgar score 5', MHG: 9.91; DHG: 9.98, CG: 9.98. p=0.431. CONCLUSIONS: The application of heat therapy to the perineum during labour did not significantly reduce perineal suturing after birth. However, better perineal results were observed with moist heat. Heat therapy does not alter neonatal outcomes measured by Apgar score.",

BACKGROUND: Chest pain is a very common complaint in patients with acute coronary syndrome. It is managed both pharmacologically and nonpharmacologically. Pharmacological pain management is associated with different side effects. DESIGN: This was a randomised double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial conducted in 2013. METHODS: A convenience sample of 66 patients with acute coronary syndrome was selected from a coronary care unit of a local teaching hospital affiliated to Gonabad University of Medical Sciences, Gonabad, Iran. Patients were randomly assigned to either the experimental or the placebo group. Patients in the experimental and the placebo groups received local heat therapy using a hot pack warmed to 50 and 37 °C, respectively. We assessed chest pain intensity, duration and frequency as well as the need for opioid analgesic therapy both before and after the study. The study instrument consisted of a demographic questionnaire, the McGill Pain Questionnaire, and a data sheet for documenting pain frequency and duration as well as the need for analgesic therapy. FINDINGS: The placebo heat therapy did not significantly decrease the intensity, the duration and the frequency of pain episodes. However, pain intensity, duration and frequency in the experimental group decreased significantly after the study. Moreover, the groups differed significantly in terms of the need for opioid analgesic therapy neither before nor after the intervention. CONCLUSION: Local heat therapy is an effective intervention for preventing and relieving chest pain in patients with acute coronary syndrome. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Effective pain management using local heat therapy could help nurses play an important role in providing effective care to patients with acute coronary syndrome and in minimising adverse effects associated with pain medications.",

Heat therapy, typically applied to the woman's back, lower abdomen, groin, and/or perineum during last stage of labor, is an easy pain relief method that does not require highly skilled care. The effectiveness of heat therapy applied to the perineum during the first stage of labor has not been evaluated. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of heat therapy for pain and woman's satisfaction during physiological labor. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Sixty primiparous women aged 18-35 years old were randomly assigned to heat therapy and control groups. Pain and satisfaction scores were measured by visual analog scale. The measurements of satisfaction were accomplished after birth. Data were analyzed by using the t-test and chi-square RESULTS: Mean pain scores in the heat therapy group were significantly lower than the control group (P < 0.05). The mean satisfaction score in the heat therapy group was significantly higher than in the control group (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Heat therapy, an inexpensive complementary treatment with low risk, can reduce the intensity of pain and increase mothers' satisfaction with care during the active phase of labor.",
