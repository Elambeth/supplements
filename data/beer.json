      "abstract": "Beer has been a popular beverage for millennia. As water is a main component of beer and the brewing process, we surmised that the polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) presence and spatial variability in drinking water systems are a PFAS source in beers. This is the first study to adapt EPA Method 533 to measure PFAS in beer from various regions, brewery types, and water sources. Statistical analyses were conducted to correlate PFAS in state-reported drinking water, and beers were analyzed by brewing location. PFAS were detected in most beers, particularly from smaller scale breweries located near drinking water sources with known PFAS. Perfluorosulfonic acids, particularly PFOS, were frequently detected, with PFOA or PFOS above U.S. EPA's Maximum Contaminant Limits in some beers. There was also a county-level correlation between the total PFAS, PFOA, and PFBS concentrations in drinking water and beers. Given that approximately 18% of U.S. breweries are located within zip codes with detectable PFAS in municipal drinking water, our findings, which link PFAS in beer to the brewery water source, are intended to help inform data-driven policies on PFAS in beverages for governmental agencies, provide insights for brewers and water utilities on treatment needs, and support informed decision-making for consumers."

      "abstract": "Purine compounds in beer significantly increase the risk of hyperuricemia and gout, creating a strong demand for low-purine and healthy beer. A multifunctional cellulose-rich bagasse (cellulose content: 40 %-50 %) magnetic porous carbon (MABB) was constructed by employing alkali-modified bagasse and intercalating with Fe3+ to effectively remove three purine nucleosides (NUCs) in beer, namely, guanosine (GUA), adenosine (ADE), and inosine (INO). Characterization results showed that alkalization increased the specific surface area of MABB and iron oxide acted as an active site to facilitate NUC removal. The equilibrium adsorption capacities of MABB for GUA, ADE, and INO were 307.12, 317.16, and 303.37 mg/g, respectively. Analysis of adsorption mechanisms and density functional theory calculations revealed that pore adsorption, metal complexation, electrostatic attraction, and hydrogen bonding interactions are dominant in MABB adsorption of NUCs. In practical system of homemade beer, MABB demonstrated significant purine removal efficacy. The treatment achieved 82.66 % purine reduction (from initial 110.04 to residual 19.08 mg/L), thereby confirming its operational viability. While minor alterations in physicochemical parameters were observed post adsorption, all critical quality indicators remained compliant with brewing standards. This study proposes an effective adsorption-based strategy for purine removal, offering mechanistic insights and a theoretical framework for industrial low-purine beer production."

      "abstract": "Beer contains a variety of bioactive ingredients and trace elements that can regulate bodily functions, and moderate consumption of beer can enhance immune responses. This study aimed to investigate the potential benefits of moderate consumption of alcoholic or non-alcoholic beer on the gut microbiome, immunity, and intestinal barrier function in immunosuppressed BALB/c mice induced by cyclophosphamide (CTX). Model mice with CTX-induced immunosuppression were administered alcoholic or non-alcoholic beer or galacto-oligosaccharides (GOS) for 28 consecutive days. The GOS and beer intervention groups all showed alleviation of spleen tissue damage, an increased immune organ index, decreased gut inflammation, and reduced serum concentrations of D-lactic acid, lipopolysaccharide, and tumor necrosis factor α. High-throughput 16S rRNA gene sequencing revealed higher relative abundances of Firmicutes and Actinobacteriota, and lower relative abundances of Bacteroidota, Lactobacillus, and Bifidobacterium, in CTX mice than in normal control mice. In addition, Firmicutes showed lower abundance, while Desulfobacterota showed higher abundance in CTX mice with non-alcoholic beer intake than without it. Spearman correlation analysis indicated that Bacteroidota was negatively correlated with propionic acid and butyric acid, while Desulfobacterota was positively correlated with butyric acid. Proteobacteria was negatively correlated with acetic acid, propionic acid, isobutyric acid, and valeric acid. Helicobacter was positively correlated with valeric acid. In conclusion, this is one of the first studies to examine the modulatory effects of moderate alcohol consumption in immunocompromised mice. Our findings indicate that beer consumption can alter the gut microbiome and metabolites, enhancing immunity in mice."

Twenty-one healthy male participants consumed 330 mL of PRO and normal sour beer (CON) daily for 2 weeks each with a 1 week of washout. Stool and blood samples were collected before and after each intervention. Significant increases for Proteobacteria and Bacteroides and a significant decrease in Dialister (p < 0.05) were observed in the CON group, while gut microbiome populations remained relatively stable in the PRO group. A significant increase was also found in HDL-cholesterol after PRO (p < 0.05), while no significant differences were observed in inflammatory and immunity profiles. Further research is warranted to explore its HDL-cholesterol increasing potential."

Initially, the production of the beverage was standardized in order to incorporate the plant extract properly. Next, the beer was analyzed by the UHPLC-MS to identify the substances present. Among others, caffeic acid (5.85 mg / L), m-coumaric acid (5.16 mg / L), pinocembrin (2.99 mg / L), chrysin (10.86 mg / L), myricetin (1.73 mg / L) and spathulenol (9.30 mg / L) were found. Animal tests indicate improvement in biochemical and histological parameters of STZ-induced Wistar rats that ingested the beer made with the plant. The antidiabetic potential of this beverage was observed in the different tests that evaluated insulin resistance and the decrease of the clinical manifestations of diabetes in animals. The use of the drink as an adjunct in clinical treatments for DM2 may be useful, especially in suppressing the oxidative damage caused by the disease.",

Factors such as the type of dietary intake and its composition contribute to the changes in red blood cell (RBC) membranes. Due to the high antioxidant content of beer, we aimed to investigate the effect of moderate beer consumption on the lipid composition of RBCs membranes from healthy overweight individuals. Methods: We conducted a four-weeks, prospective two-arm longitudinal crossed-over study, where participants (n = 36) were randomly assigned to alcohol-free beer group or traditional beer group. The lipids of RBCs membranes were assessed at the beginning and the end of the intervention by thin-layer chromatography. Results: Four-weeks of alcohol-free beer promoted changes in fatty acids (FA), free cholesterol (FC), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and phosphatidylcholine (PC) (p < 0.05). Meanwhile, traditional beer intake led to changes in FA, FC, phospholipids (PL), PE and PC (p < 0.05). The observed alterations in membrane lipids were found to be independent of sex and BMI as influencing factors. Conclusions: The lipid composition of erythrocyte membranes is distinctly but mildly influenced by the consumption of both non-alcoholic and conventional beer, with no effects on RBC membrane fluidity.",

This study proposed an approach to valorize waste brewer's yeast by extracting β-glucan. The key phases of the research included yeast autolysis, alkaline treatment and optimization of the β-glucan purification conditions. The findings revealed that a 0.7 % NaOH concentration at 80 °C for 2.6 h was the most effective for impurity removal. In the comparative analysis, it was confirmed that extraction at 80 % DMSO concentration with a 30:1 solid-liquid ratio at 80 °C for 30 min was the optimal condition for obtaining high-purity β-glucan. The process yielded a β-glucan high purity of 95.84 ± 1.15 % and a yield of 5.56 ± 0.34 % based on the wet weight after centrifugation. The structure was analyzed using TLC, FTIR and NMR. The extracts are polysaccharides composed of glucose monomers linked by β-glycosidic bonds. In addition, It has demonstrated significant anti-inflammatory properties in vitro and can be developed as a functional food. This study provides a feasible and efficient solution for the sustainable utilization of waste brewer's yeast, contributing to environmental sustainability and offering economic benefits for the brewing industry.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Smaller serving sizes could contribute towards reducing alcohol consumption across populations and thereby decrease the risk of 7 cancers and other diseases. To our knowledge, the current study is the first to assess the impact on beer, lager, and cider sales (hereafter, for ease, referred to just as \"beer sales\") of removing the largest draught serving size (1 imperial pint) from the options available in licensed premises under real-word conditions. METHODS AND FINDINGS: The study was conducted between February and May 2023, in 13 licensed premises in England. It used an A-B-A reversal design, set over 3 consecutive 4-weekly periods with \"A\" representing the nonintervention periods during which standard serving sizes were served, and \"B\" representing the intervention period when the largest serving size of draught beer (1 imperial pint (568 ml)) was removed from existing ranges so that the largest size available was two-thirds of a pint. Where two-third pints were not served, the intervention included introducing this serving size in conjunction with removing the pint serving size. The primary outcome was the mean daily volume of all beer sold, including draught, bottles, and cans (in ml), extracted from electronic sales data. Secondary outcomes were mean daily volume of wine sold (ml) and daily revenue (£). Thirteen premises completed the study, 12 of which did so per protocol and were included in the primary analysis. After adjusting for prespecified covariates, the intervention resulted in a mean daily change of -2,769 ml (95% CI [-4,188, -1,578] p < 0.001) or -9.7% (95% CI [-13.5%, -6.1%] in beer sold. The daily volume of wine sold increased during the intervention period by 232 ml (95% CI [13, 487], p = 0.035) or 7.2% (95% CI [0.4%, 14.5%]). Daily revenues decreased by 5.0% (95% CI [9.6%, -0.3%], p = 0.038). CONCLUSIONS: Removing the largest serving size (the imperial pint) for draught beer reduced the volume of beer sold. Given the potential of this intervention to reduce alcohol consumption, it merits consideration in alcohol control policies. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ISRCTN.com ISRCTN18365249.",

When complicated by acute kidney injury (AKI), it presents a significant management challenge. We report a case of a 32-year-old male with a history of alcoholism who presented with malaise, nausea, and vomiting. Laboratory tests revealed severe hyponatremia (serum sodium 104 mEq/L) and AKI. Conventional treatment approaches posed risks of overcorrection and osmotic demyelination syndrome (ODS). We implemented continuous kidney replacement therapy (CKRT) with meticulously adjusted dialysate sodium concentrations. This approach enabled gradual, controlled correction of serum sodium without precipitating ODS. The patient was successfully liberated from hemodialysis on the twelfth day of illness. Our findings highlight the potential of CKRT as an effective treatment modality for severe hyponatremia in beer potomania with AKI, offering a means of gradual sodium correction while addressing renal dysfunction. This case underscores the importance of tailored management strategies in complex clinical scenarios involving electrolyte imbalances and kidney injury."

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: Patients with chemotherapy-responsive advanced biliary tract cancers (BTCs) are usually observed after 6 months of gemcitabine-based therapy. There is limited prospective evidence for maintenance strategies after chemotherapy. METHODS: This investigator-initiated, open-label, randomized, integrated phase II-III study enrolled adult patients with advanced BTC from two cancer centers in India. Patients with histologically confirmed advanced biliary tract adenocarcinoma who had at least disease stabilization after 6 months of gemcitabine-based chemotherapy were randomly assigned (1:1) to either active surveillance or switch maintenance, which was a combination of bevacizumab 5 mg/kg intravenous once every 21 days plus erlotinib 100 mg once daily. Both arms were continued until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or patient decision to withdraw. The primary end point of the phase II component of the trial was investigator-evaluated progression-free survival. This trial is registered with Clinical Trials Registry of India (CTRI/2019/05/019323I). RESULTS: From May 2021 to November 2022, 98 patients were randomly assigned to active surveillance (n = 49) or bevacizumab-erlotinib (n = 49). A majority of patients had gallbladder cancer (80%). The median follow-up was 13.4 months. The median progression-free survival was 3.1 months (95% CI, 2.47 to 3.64) in the active surveillance group versus 5.3 months (95% CI, 3.53 to 7.04) in the bevacizumab-erlotinib group (hazard ratio, 0.51 [95% CI, 0.33 to 0·74]; P = .0013). The most common grade 3 class-specific adverse events associated with bevacizumab-erlotinib were acneiform rash 1 (2%) and oral stomatitis 1 (2%) with erlotinib and bleeding 1 (2%) with bevacizumab. CONCLUSION: The combination of bevacizumab and erlotinib as switch maintenance improves progression-free survival with an acceptable safety profile compared with active surveillance in patients with advanced BTCs in this phase II study. The trial moves on to the phase III component to evaluate improvement in overall survival.",

      "abstract": "Beer fish is characterized by its distinctive spicy flavor and strong beer aroma. Currently, there is a lack of comprehensive research analyzing the changes in taste and volatile compounds that occur during the processing of beer fish. Thus, this study used HS-GC-IMS, electronic tongue, and electronic nose to investigate the changes in flavor components during various processing stages of beer fish. The obtained results were subsequently analyzed using multivariate statistical analysis. The results showed that the final beer fish product (SF) had the greatest amount of free amino acids (888.28 mg/100 g), with alanine, glutamic acid, and glycine contributing to the taste of SF. The inosine monophosphate (IMP) content of beer fish meat varied noticeably depending on processing stages, with deep-fried fish (FF) having the greatest IMP content (61.93 mg/100 g), followed by the final product (SF) and ultrasonic-cured fish (UF). A total of 67 volatiles were detected by GC-IMS, mainly consisting of aldehydes, ketones, and alcohols, of which aldehydes accounted for >37%, which had a great influence on the volatile flavor of beer fish. The flavor components' composition varied noticeably depending on the stage of processing. PLS-DA model screened 35 volatile flavor components (VIP > 1) as markers; the most significant differences were 1-propanethiol, isoamyl alcohol, ethanol, and eucalyptol. Ultrasonic processing, frying, and soaking sauce can significantly improve the formation of flavor compounds, resulting in a notable enhancement of the final beer fish's umami taste and overall flavor quality."

In this article, we demonstrate the physiological mechanisms of the functional ingredients in beer with health-promoting effects, based on the PubMed, Google, CNKI, and ISI Web of Science databases, published from 1997 to 2024. Beer, a complex of barley malt and hops, is rich in functional ingredients. The health effects of beer against 26 chronic diseases are highly similar to those of barley due to the physiological mechanisms of polyphenols (phenolic acids, flavonoids), melatonin, minerals, bitter acids, vitamins, and peptides. Functional beer with low purine and high active ingredients made from pure barley malt, as well as an additional functional food, represents an important development direction, specifically, ginger beer, ginseng beer, and coix-lily beer, as consumed by our ancestors ca. 9000 years ago. Low-purine beer can be produced via enzymatic and biological degradation and adsorption of purines, as well as dandelion addition. Therefore, this review paper not only reveals the physiological mechanisms of beer in overcoming chronic human diseases, but also provides a scientific basis for the development of functional beer with health-promoting effects.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Discussion of the benefits of moderate alcohol consumption is ongoing. Broadly, research focusing on ethanol consumption tends to report no benefits. However, studies that distinguish between different types of alcoholic beverages, particularly beers, often reveal positive effects. The present study evaluated the genotoxic and mutagenic effects of moderate chronic consumption of India Pale Ale (IPA) craft beer. Sixty-four adult male Swiss mice were used and divided into control and treatment groups receiving water, IPA beer with 55.23 g of ethanol per liter of beer, aqueous solution with 55.23 g of ethanol per liter, and hop infusion ad libitum for 30 days. After this period, the animals were genetically evaluated with a comet assay. For the ex vivo comet assay, blood was collected and exposed to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). For the in vivo assay, the alkylating agent cyclophosphamide (CP) was administered to the groups after blood collection and sacrificed after 24 h. Brain, liver, and heart tissues were analyzed. Bone marrow was collected and submitted to the micronucleus test. RESULTS: The groups treated with IPA beer, ethanol, and hops did not show genotoxic and mutagenic action in the blood, brain, heart, or liver. The antigenotoxic action of IPA beer and hops was observed in both in vivo and ex vivo models, showing a similar reduction in DNA damage caused by CP. There was no significant difference between the groups with regard to the formation of micronuclei by CP. CONCLUSION: Moderate chronic consumption of IPA beer and hops infusion showed antigenotoxic effects in mice but no antimutagenic action. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.",

In less common instances they can be found in the spinal cord. There have been rare cases of Anaplastic variants of the Cranial Pilocytic Astrocytomas. We report a rare instance of an adult patient with pilocytic astrocytoma of the cervical cord with anaplastic features. Our patient presented with 6 months history of neck pain and right-hand paraesthesia which partially responded to steroid treatment. MRI of the cervical spine demonstrated marked expansion of the cervical cord with oedema extending cranially to the medulla and caudally to the mid-thoracic cord. Post-gadolinium T1-weighted images showed intense intramedullary enhancement mainly centred at the level of the C3 vertebra. Diffusion Tensor Imaging Tractography showed the central location of the tumour expanding the cord and displacing the tracts circumferentially. Surgical resection was performed in two stages according to the Elsberg and Beer technique that assisted with safe margin tumour debulking. The histological sections revealed a glial lineage tumour with retained ATRX nuclear expression, positive for GFAP, Ki-67 estimated to 10% and a methylation class corresponding to an Anaplastic Pilocytic Astrocytoma. Subsequently, our patient underwent adjuvant radiotherapy and chemotherapy (10 cycles of Temozolamide and 6 cycles of CCNU). Symptomatic progression developed at 18 months from the initial surgery, radiological progression at 34 months and the overall survival was 40 months. We reviewed the literature and found only four other cases with similar histology."

DESIGN: Randomised crossover field trial. SETTING: England. PARTICIPANTS: Fourteen venues that did not previously sell draught alcohol-free beer. INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: Venues completed two intervention periods and two control periods in a randomised order over 8 weeks. Intervention periods involved replacing one draught alcoholic beer with an alcohol-free beer. Control periods operated business as usual. MEASUREMENTS: The primary outcome was mean weekly volume (in litres) of draught alcoholic beer sold. The secondary outcome was mean weekly revenue [in GBP (£)] from all drinks. Analyses adjusted for randomised order, special events, season and busyness. FINDINGS: The adjusted mean difference in weekly sales of draught alcoholic beer was -20 L [95% confidence interval (CI) = -41 to +0.4], equivalent to a 4% reduction (95% CI = 8% reduction to 0.1% increase) in the volume of alcoholic draught beer sold when draught alcohol-free beer was available. Excluding venues that failed at least one fidelity check resulted in an adjusted mean difference of -29 L per week (95% CI = -53 to -5), equivalent to a 5% reduction (95% CI = 8% reduction to 0.8% reduction). The adjusted mean difference in weekly revenue was +61 GBP per week (95% CI = -328 to +450), equivalent to a 1% increase (95% CI = 5% decrease to 7% increase) when draught alcohol-free beer was available. CONCLUSIONS: Introducing a draught alcohol-free beer in bars and pubs in England reduced the volume of draught alcoholic beer sold by 4% to 5%, with no evidence of the intervention impacting net revenue.",

      "abstract": "Craft brewing is continually gaining popularity in the United States. Craft brewers are committed to producing a wide variety of products and have a vested interest in product quality. Therefore, these brewers have the expectation that the beer poured at the tap will match the quality product that left the brewery. The presence of biofilm in draught lines is hypothesized as a contributing factor when this expectation is not achieved. Clean in place strategies based on the Sinner's Circle of Cleaning are used to remediate organic and inorganic accumulation in beer draught lines, including controlling biofilm accumulation. A study was conducted to determine if repeated exposure to chemical cleaning of vinyl beer tubing impacted biofilm growth, kill/removal, and subsequent regrowth of a mixed species biofilm. The tubing was conditioned to simulate one, two, and five years of use. The data collected demonstrates a clear trend between simulated age of the tubing and biofilm accumulation on the surface. Bacterial log densities ranged from 5.6 Log10(CFU/cm2) for the new tubing to 6.6 Log10(CFU/cm2) for tubing aged to simulate five years of use. The counts for the yeast were similar. Caustic cleaning of the tubing, regardless of starting biofilm coverage, left less than 2.75 Log10(CFU/cm2) viable bacteria and yeast cells remaining on the tubing surface. This demonstrated the effectiveness of the caustic at controlling biofilm accumulation in the simulated beer draught line. The biofilm that accumulated in the five-year aged tubing was able to recover more quickly, reaching 3.6 Log10(CFU/cm2) within 24 h indicating the treatment did not fully eradicate the biofilm, suggesting that the strong chemistry used in this study would cease to be as effective over time.",

Samples of microfiltered and pasteurised beer were divided into fresh and aged groups. A forced ageing process, which consisted of storing fresh samples at 55° C for 6 days in an incubator and then keeping them under ambient conditions prior to analysis, was applied. Physicochemical analysis showed that both microfiltered and pasteurised samples had a slight variation in apparent extract, pH, and bitterness. The samples that underwent heat treatment had lower colour values compared with those that were microfiltered. Chromatographic peak areas of vicinal diketones increased in both fresh and aged samples. The results of the microbiological analysis revealed spoilage lactic acid bacteria (Lactobacillus) and yeasts (Saccharomyces and non-Saccharomyces) in fresh microfiltered samples. In the GC-MS analysis, furfural, considered by many authors as a heat indicator, was detected only in samples that underwent forced ageing and not in samples that were subjected to thermal pasteurisation. Finally, sensory analysis found differences in the organoleptic properties of fresh microfiltered samples compared with the rest of the samples."

      "abstract": "To date, few studies investigated the differences between the two main gluten-free (GF) brewing techniques, such as the use of enzymes and the use of unconventional GF grains in brewing, by consumer perspective. In this study a GF beer brewed with sorghum and quinoa, as brewing adjuncts, was compared to the enzymatic-treated counterpart, in order to evaluate the effect of deglutinization treatment on physicochemical, volatile, and sensory characteristics of final beer. Moreover, the influence of brewing process and raw materials information on consumers' sensory perceptions, willingness to buy (WTB) and willingness to pay (WTP) was also investigated (n = 105 consumers), under blind (B), expected (E), and informed (I) conditions. The enzymatic-treated sample showed comparable physicochemical attributes with the untreated counterpart, except for a significant reduction in color and foam stability (p < 0.05). Non-significant difference between samples was found in the overall liking, WTB, and WTP mean scores in all three sensory test conditions (p > 0.05). The information about the deglutinization treatment had a negative impact on overall liking (p < 0.01), although WTP for both samples was significantly higher in the informed test than in blind condition (p < 0.05). Overall, Check-All-That-Apply test results confirmed that the deglutinization treatment does not affect the beer sensory profile, even if the information about brewing ingredients and technologies may slightly influence the consumers' sensory perception. Therefore, this result proves that it is possible to produce a marketable GF beer, simply by partially replacing 40% of barley malt with unconventional GF grains, without using enzymes for gluten reduction purpose.",

      "abstract": "In wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), external carbon sources are often required due to low C/N influent. However, the use of external carbon sources can increase treatment costs and cause large carbon emissions. Beer wastewater, which contains a substantial amount of carbon, is often treated separately in China, consuming significant energy and cost. However, most studies using beer wastewater as an external carbon source are still on a laboratory scale. To address this issue, this study proposes using beer wastewater as an external carbon source in an actual WWTP to reduce operating costs and carbon emissions while achieving a win-win situation. The denitrification rate of beer wastewater was found to be higher than that of sodium acetate , resulting in improved treatment efficiency of the WWTP. Specifically, COD, BOD5, TN, NH4+-N and TP increased by 3.4%, 1.6%, 10.8%, 1.1%, and 1.7%, respectively. Additionally, the treatment cost and carbon emission per 10 000 tons of wastewater treated were reduced by 537.31 yuan and 2.27 t CO2, respectively. These results indicate that beer wastewater has significant utilization potential and provide a reference for using different types of production wastewater in WWTPs. This study's findings demonstrate the feasibility of implementing this approach in an actual WWTP setting."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The main aim of this 2-year non-randomized parallel controlled clinical pilot trial was to evaluate the long-term effect of a moderate daily intake of beer (with and without alcohol) on cardiovascular health in postmenopausal women. A total of 34 participants were grouped into three study arms: 16 were administered alcoholic beer, 6 consumed non-alcoholic beer, and 12 were in the control group. Changes in glucose metabolism, lipid profile, liver enzymes, anthropometric measurements, body composition, and blood pressure variables were monitored. Data on medical history, diet, and exercise were collected, and gustatory capacities were determined. RESULTS: Moderate consumption of beer, both alcoholic and non-alcoholic, seemed to have positive effects on biochemical indicators of cardiovascular health in postmenopausal women, with 660 mL day-1 of non-alcoholic beer reducing low-density lipoprotein cholesterol blood levels, and 330 mL day-1 of alcoholic beer increasing high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. The evolution of changes in android and gynoid fat percentage and their ratio differed significantly between study groups, which was attributable to either the interventions or the disparity between groups regarding the time elapsed since menopause onset. Iso-α-acids recognition threshold could be involved in intervention group election, whereas the sensory phenotypes studied were not associated with alcohol drinking frequency. CONCLUSIONS: Moderate beer consumption was found to improve the lipid profile of postmenopausal women, although their effects in preventing cardiometabolic alterations deserve further research (trial registration number: ISRCTN13825020; https://doi.org/10.1186/ISRCTN13825020). © 2023 The Authors.

METHODS: Twenty-two licensed premises in England consented to taking part in the study. The study used an ABA reversal design, set over three 4-weekly periods, with A representing the non-intervention periods, during which standard serving sizes were served and B the intervention period when a 2/3 pint serving size of draught beer and cider was added to the existing range, along with smaller 1/2 pint and larger 1 pint serving sizes. The primary outcome was the daily volume of beer and cider sold, extracted from sales data. RESULTS: Fourteen premises started the study, of which thirteen completed it. Twelve of those did so per protocol and were included in the primary analysis. After adjusting for pre-specified covariates, the intervention did not have a significant effect on the volume of beer and cider sold per day (3.14 ml; 95%CIs -2.29 to 8.58; p = 0.257). CONCLUSIONS: In licensed premises, there was no evidence that adding a smaller serving size for draught beer and cider (2/3 pint) when the smallest (1/2 pint) and largest (1 pint) sizes were still available, affected the volume of beer and cider sold. Studies are warranted to assess the impact of removing the largest serving size.

      "abstract": "The market of non-alcoholic and low-alcohol beer has grown continuously thanks to the advocacy for healthy and responsible drinking. Non-alcoholic and low-alcohol products usually possess less higher alcohols and acetates and more aldehyde off-flavors due to the manufacturing processes. The employment of non-conventional yeasts partially mitigates this problem. In this study, we used proteases to optimize the wort amino acid profile for better aroma production during yeast fermentation. The design of experiments was applied to increase the leucine molar fraction, aiming to boost 3-methylbutan-1-ol and 3-methylbutyl acetate (banana-like aromas). This led to an increase from 7% to 11% leucine in wort after protease treatment. The aroma output in the subsequent fermentation, however, was yeast-dependent. An 87% increase of 3-methylbutan-1-ol and a 64% increase of 3-methylbutyl acetate were observed when Saccharomycodes ludwigii was used. When Pichia kluyveri was employed, higher alcohols and esters from valine and isoleucine were increased: 58% more of 2-methylpropyl acetate, 67% more of 2-methylbutan-1-ol, and 24% more of 2-methylbutyl acetate were observed. Conversely, 3-methylbutan-1-ol decreased by 58% and 3-methylbutyl acetate largely remained the same. Apart from these, the amounts of aldehyde intermediates were increased to a varying extent. The impact of such increases in aromas and off-flavors on the perception of low-alcohol beer remains to be evaluated by sensory analysis in future studies.",

This study, therefore, investigated the effect of bitter leaf-flavored non-alcoholic wheat beer (NAWB) on insulin secretion and GLUT-2 expression in the pancreas of STZ-induced diabetic rats. METHODS: In this study, the rats received a single intraperitoneal injection (i.p.) of STZ (35 mg/kg) after being fed a high-fat diet for 14 days to induce T2D. The rats were treated with bitter leaf flavored NAWB samples (100%HP- Hops only, 100%BL-Bitter leaf only, 75,25BL- 75% Hops, 25% Bitter Leaf, 50:50BL- 50% Hops:50% Bitter Leaf, and 25:75BL-25%Hops:75% Bitter Leaf) and Acarbose for 14 days. The superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase activity were also determined. RESULTS: The results from this study showed a correlation between GLUT-2 and Insulin expression. There was an upregulation of Insulin as GLUT-2 expression was upregulated. Furthermore, the treated groups showed better antioxidant activity when compared with the diabetic control. CONCLUSION: Bitter leaf-flavored NAWB might thus be a good dietary intervention for type 2 diabetics."

Oxidative stress plays a central role in the pathogenesis and progression of cardiovascular disease. However, the potential benefits of fermented beverages on cardiovascular health need to be fully investigated at a molecular level. In this study, we aimed at analyzing the effects of beer consumption in modulating the transcriptomic response of the heart to an oxidative stress challenge induced by myocardial ischemia (MI) in the presence of hypercholesterolemia in a pre-clinical swine model. Previous studies have shown that the same intervention induces organ protective benefits. We report a dose-dependent up-regulation of electron transport chain members and the down-regulation of spliceosome-associated genes linked to beer consumption. Additionally, low-dose beer consumption resulted in a down-regulation of genes associated with the immune response, that was not shown for moderate-dose beer consumption. These findings, observed in animals having demonstrated beneficial effects at the organ-level, indicate that the antioxidants in beer differentially affect the myocardial transcriptome in a dose-dependent manner."

By comparing the effects of four fertilisation treatments, this study aims at determining whether different foliar fertilisation treatments have a significant impact on hop plants' aromatic quality and that of the beer produced. Hop cones harvested from each experimental treatment were brewed to obtain five single dry-hopped beers, which were subsequently analysed. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and electronic nose (Cyranose 320) analyses were performed on the hop cones, while headspace solid-phase microextraction-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry HS-SPME-GC-MS, electronic nose and sensory analyses were carried out on the beers produced. The analyses not only allowed for a differentiation between the hops from the four fertilisation treatments and the control but also enabled a differentiation between the beers produced for their identification. Sensory evaluation revealed consumer preferences regarding the dry-hopped beers analysed, evidencing their distinctive features, including significant differences in both aroma and flavour."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Prolyl endopeptidase from Aspergillus niger (AN-PEP) is a prominent serine proteinase with various potential applications in the food and pharmaceutical industries. However, the availability of efficient and low-cost AN-PEP remains a challenge owing to its low yield and high fermentation cost. RESULTS: Here, AN-PEP was recombinantly expressed in Trichoderma reesei (rAN-PEP) under the control of the cbh1 promoter and its secretion signal. After 4 days of shaking flask cultivation with the model cellulose Avicel PH101 as the sole carbon source, the extracellular prolyl endopeptidase activity reached up to 16.148 U/mL, which is the highest titer reported to date and the secretion of the enzyme is faster in T. reesei than in other eukaryotic expression systems including A. niger and Komagataella phaffii. Most importantly, when cultivated on the low-cost agricultural residue corn cob, the recombinant strain was found to secret a remarkable amount of rAN-PEP (37.125 U/mL) that is twice the activity under the pure cellulose condition. Furthermore, treatment with rAN-PEP during beer brewing lowered the content of gluten below the ELISA kit detection limit (< 10 mg/kg) and thereby, reduced turbidity, which would be beneficial for improving the non-biological stability of beer. CONCLUSION: Our research provides a promising approach for industrial production of AN-PEP and other enzymes (proteins) from renewable lignocellulosic biomass, which provides a new idea with relevant researchers for the utilization of agricultural residues.",

Its high protein and polysaccharide content make it attractive for use in sectors such as the manufacture of bioplastics. However, its high water content makes it necessary to stabilize it before being considered as a raw material. The main objective of this work was to evaluate the stabilization of beer bagasse and the production of bioplastics from it. In this sense, different drying methods (freeze-drying and heat treatment at 45 and 105 °C) were studied. The bagasse was also characterized physicochemically to evaluate its potential. In addition, bagasse was used in combination with glycerol (plasticizer) to make bioplastics by injection molding, analyzing their mechanical properties, water absorption capacity and biodegradability. The results showed the great potential of bagasse, presenting a high content of proteins (18-20%) and polysaccharides (60-67%) after its stabilization, with freeze-drying being the most suitable method to avoid its denaturation. Bioplastics present appropriate properties for use in applications such as horticulture and agriculture."

For this purpose, laboratory-scale brewing trials were carried out with conventional hops from four localities in which pest control spray programs varied. Pesticide residue analysis in samples of hopped wort, young beer, and beer was carried out by liquid chromatography in tandem with mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Cu concentrations were determined using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). The transfer rates (%) of individual pesticides were calculated to demonstrate their ability to be transferred from hops to the brewed solutions. The pesticides exhibited different transfer rates correlating well with their log p values; however, the obtained transfer data were not related to their concentration in hops. The average transfer rates calculated for ametoctradin (15% ± 5%), mandipropamid (38% ± 4%), boscalid (48% ± 5%), and azoxystrobin (47% ± 2%) increased in good correlation with their descending log P values. On the contrary, the transfer rates of copper residues were related to residual concentrations of copper in hops and exhibited logarithmic dependency. The carryover of the sum of all pesticides in the four samples ranged from 36% to 49%, averaging 42% ± 6%. The data showed no substantial influence of various pesticide spray sequences on the percentages of overall pesticide residues carried over into beer.",

Following the injection of HeLa tumorigenic cell lines, the treatment groups were administered a xanthohumol supplementation for 100 days, either dissolved in beer or in an ethanolic solution with the same alcohol strength as beer. The control groups received un-supplemented material. The terminal tumor masses, liver weights, and plasma antioxidant capacities (FRAP and ABTS methods) were measured. For the statistical analysis, a two-way ANOVA test was performed (p < 0.05). There were no statistically significant differences in tumor size between the groups. Xanthohumol did not induce higher levels of plasma antioxidant capacity, neither in beer nor in the water-ethanol matrix. The terminal liver weights were significantly higher in the control group receiving the unsupplemented ethanol solution. Xanthohumol dissolved in beer or in the water-alcohol matrix did not have a protective effect on tumor growth, nor did it have a positive effect on plasma antioxidant capacity either. However, beer with added xanthohumol had a less harmful effect on the liver compared to the supplemented water-ethanol solution.

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Osteoporosis is a chronic progressive bone disease characterized by low bone mineral density (BMD) and micro-architectural deterioration of bone tissue, leading to an increase in bone fragility and the risk of fractures. A well-known risk factor for bone loss is postmenopausal status. Beer may have a protective effect against osteoporosis associated with its content of silicon, polyphenols, iso-α-acids and ethanol, and its moderate consumption may therefore help to reduce bone loss in postmenopausal women. METHODS: Accordingly, a 2-year controlled clinical intervention study was conducted to evaluate if a moderate daily intake of beer with (AB) or without alcohol (NAB) could have beneficial effects on bone tissue. A total of 31 postmenopausal women were assigned to three study groups: 15 were administered AB (330 mL/day) and six, NAB (660 mL/day), whereas, the 10 in the control group refrained from consuming alcohol, NAB, and hop-related products. At baseline and subsequent assessment visits, samples of plasma and urine were taken to analyze biochemical parameters, and data on medical history, diet, and exercise were collected. BMD and the trabecular bone score (TBS) were determined by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Markers of bone formation (bone alkaline phosphatase [BAP] and N-propeptide of type I collagen [PINP]) and bone resorption (N-telopeptide of type I collagen [NTX] and C-telopeptide of type I collagen [CTX]) were determined annually. RESULTS: Bone formation markers had increased in the AB and NAB groups compared to the control after the 2-year intervention. However, the evolution of BMD and TBS did not differ among the three groups throughout the study period. DISCUSSION: Therefore, according to the findings of this pilot study, moderate beer intake does not seem to have a protective effect against bone loss in early post-menopausal women."

This study, therefore, sought to exploit the recent trend in the brewing industry on the production of non-alcoholic beers by investigating the possibility of having a non-alcoholic beer flavored with bitter leaf, a known plant widely reported to have a strong hypoglycemic effect, as against the traditional use of hops, and the effect of the produced beer on the glycemic indices and various diabetic biochemical parameters that serve as biomarkers for type-2 diabetes (T2D). The glycemic indices, as well as the inhibitory potentials of bitter leaf-flavored Non-alcoholic wheat beer (NAWB) in ratios of 100%HP, 100%BL, 75:25BL, 50:50BL, and 25:75BL, on enzymes linked to a high-fat diet/streptozocin (HFD/STZ)-induced T2D albino Wistar rats were investigated. There were no significant difference (p > .05) between the starch (1.72-1.77 mg/100 mL), amylose (0.22-0.24 mg/100 mL), and amylopectin (1.49-1.53 mg/100 mL) contents of the various samples. The Glycemic Index (GI) of the samples ranged from 36 to 73 with 75:25Bl and 50:50BL have the lowest (36) values. The samples reduced blood glucose levels and inhibited pancreatic α-amylase, lipase, and intestinal α-glucosidase activity. The inhibitory potentials of these beer samples on α-amylase and α-glucosidase as well as their ability to reduce blood glucose levels in diabetic rats thus making the bitter leaf flavored NAWB a suitable healthy beverage for better glycemic control in diabetics. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: This study revealed the potential of producing non-alcoholic wheat beer flavored with bitter leaves as a possible substitute for hops. The potential inherent in bitter leaf in the management of type 2 diabetes can thus be made available through a far-reaching beverage medium such as non-alcoholic beer to help in the treatment/management of T2D. The results of this research could be an eye-opener to the possible utilization of bitter leaf and by extension other plants that have been reported in the management of T2D. The use of the bitter leaf as a substitute for hops in the production of non-alcoholic beer in the brewing industry could help in a health-oriented campaign for safe drinks that could be helpful in the control of blood glucose levels of diabetic patients.",

      "abstract": "Functional foods containing probiotics are generally administered as dairy products. Non-dairy beverages are another possibility, but probiotic functionality must be confirmed in such vehicles. In the present study, a craft wheat beer brewed with the probiotic yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae UFMG A-905 (905) was evaluated in a murine model of Salmonella Typhimurium infection. Unfiltered or filtered beer brewed with 905, a commercial wheat beer used as a negative control, or saline were administered orally to mice before and during oral S. Typhimurium challenge. High fecal levels of yeast were only counted in mice treated with the unfiltered 905 beer, which also had reduced mortality and body weight loss due to S. Typhimurium infection. Increased levels of intestinal IgA, translocation to liver and spleen, liver and intestinal lesions, pro-inflammatory cytokines in liver and ileum, and hepatic and intestinal myeloperoxidase and eosinophilic peroxidase activities were observed in animals infected with S. Typhimurium. All these parameters were reduced by the treatment with unfiltered 905 beer. In conclusion, the results show that a craft wheat beer brewed with S. cerevisiae UFMG A-905 maintained the probiotic properties of this yeast when administered orally to mice challenged with S. Typhimurium.",

In this randomized, double-blinded, two-arm parallel trial, 22 healthy men were recruited to drink 330 mL of nonalcoholic beer (0.0% v/v) or alcoholic beer (5.2% v/v) daily during a 4-week follow-up period. Blood and faecal samples were collected before and after the intervention period. Gut microbiota was analyzed by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Drinking nonalcoholic or alcoholic beer daily for 4 weeks did not increase body weight and body fat mass and did not changed significantly serum cardiometabolic biomarkers. Nonalcoholic and alcoholic beer increased gut microbiota diversity which has been associated with positive health outcomes and tended to increase faecal alkaline phosphatase activity, a marker of intestinal barrier function. These results suggest the effects of beer on gut microbiota modulation are independent of alcohol and may be mediated by beer polyphenols.",

Conflicting data are currently available regarding the consequences of alcohol and alcohol-containing beverages on dementia and age-associated disorders including Alzheimer's disease (AD), a neurodegeneration characterized by protein aggregation, inflammatory processes and alterations of components of the gut-brain axis. The effects of an unfiltered and unpasteurized craft beer on AD molecular hallmarks, levels of gut hormones and composition of micro/mycobiota were dissected using 3xTg-AD mice. In addition, to better assess the role of yeasts, beer was enriched with the same Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain used for brewing. The treatment with the yeast-enriched beer ameliorated cognition and favored the reduction of Aβ(1-42) and pro-inflammatory molecules, also contributing to an increase in the concentration of anti-inflammatory cytokines. A significant improvement in the richness and presence of beneficial taxa in the gut bacterial population of the 3xTg-AD animals was observed. In addition, the fungal order, Sordariomycetes, associated with gut inflammatory conditions, noticeably decreased with beer treatments. These data demonstrate, for the first time, the beneficial effects of a yeast-enriched beer on AD signs, suggesting gut microbiota modulation as a mechanism of action.",

      "abstract": "Hyponatremia is acute when present for <48 h. Most cases of acute hyponatremia involve both excess free water intake and an at least partial urinary free water excretion defect. By contrast, hyperacute water intoxication may result from a large excess electrolyte-free water intake in such a short time that properly working urinary free water excretion mechanisms cannot cope. A hyperacute decrease in serum sodium may lead to death before medical intervention takes place. Well-documented cases have been published in the military medicine literature. In addition, news reports suggest the existence of cases of voluntary ingestion of excess free water by non-psychiatric individuals usually during 'dare' activities. Education of the public is required to prevent harm from these high-risk activities. Adequate training of emergency medical units may prevent lethal outcomes. Spanish media reported the case of a male who died following his triumph in a 20-min beer drinking contest. 'From a heart attack. Man dies after drinking six litres of beer in a contest' ran the news. We now review the physiology underlying hyperacute water intoxication and discuss the potential contribution of hyperacute water loading and acute hyponatremia to the demise of this patient."

This study evaluated the influence of adding 80% ethanolic extract of Moringa stenopetala leaf to lagered beer at 400, 600, and 800 ppm concentrations for 30-, 60-, and 90-day storage time at room temperature. The effect of physicochemical properties of the beer incorporated with leaf extract of Moringa stenopetala (LEMS) was evaluated using the American Society of Brewing Chemists method of analysis. Sensory acceptability of the beer treated with LEMS was evaluated using nine hedonic scales over a period of storage time. Original gravity (11.06-11.08), apparent extract (3.68-3.77), pH (4.23-4.40), vicinal diketone (0.07-0.09), and alcohol content (4.76-4.81) were not altered by the incorporation of LEMS at any level of treatment and over a period of storage time. The beer color (8.88-9.70 EBC), bitterness (13.62-15.56 bitterness unit), calcium ion (44.18-52.04 ppm), and foam stability (201.5-246.5) of beer increased with increasing LEMS concentration, but a significant haziness reduction (1.23-0.63) was observed. However, the storage time decreased both haziness and foam stability of LEMS-incorporated beer. The incorporation of LEMS at an optimum level kept its quality for 90 days better than the usual antioxidant (potassium metabisulfite) added in beer. The sensory analysis also supported the beer treated with 600 ppm of LEMS as the best overall acceptability. The result indicates a promising use of LEMS as a functional ingredient in beer to reduce beer oxidation probability and keep its freshness for a period of storage time."

      "abstract": "This study investigated the impact of varying sound conditions (frequency and intensity) on yeast growth, fermentation performance and production of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in beer. Fermentations were carried out in plastic bags suspended in large water-filled containers fitted with underwater speakers. Ferments were subjected to either 200-800 or 800-2000 Hz at 124 and 140 dB @ 20 µPa. Headspace solid-phase microextraction (HS-SPME) coupled with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) was used to identify and measure the relative abundance of the VOCs produced. Sound treatment had significant effects on the number of viable yeast cells in suspension at 10 and 24 h (p < 0.05), with control (silence) samples having the highest cell numbers. For wort gravity, there were significant differences between treatments at 24 and 48 h, with the silence control showing the lowest density before all ferments converged to the same final gravity at 140 h. A total of 33 VOCs were identified in the beer samples, including twelve esters, nine alcohols, three acids, three aldehydes, and six hop-derived compounds. Only the abundance of some alcohols showed any consistent response to the sound treatments. These results show that the application of audible sound via underwater transmission to a beer fermentation elicited limited changes to wort gravity and VOCs during fermentation.",

Inappropriate activity of the inflammasome system has been linked to onset and perpetuation of inflammation in atherosclerotic plaques and cardiovascular disease. Low-to-moderate beer consumption is inversely associated with cardiovascular event presentation, while high levels of alcohol intake are associated with increased cardiovascular risk. Although fermented beverages have been suggested to exert their beneficial effects through their anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, little is known regarding the capacity of beer to modulate innate immunity cell responses. To this aim, primed or activated THP-1 macrophages were conditioned with human serum obtained from a prospective two-arms longitudinal crossover study to investigate the effect of a moderate and regular daily intake of beer, either alcohol-free or traditional, in the regulation of TLR-mediated inflammatory responses in healthy but overweight individuals. Conditioned macrophages with serum obtained after four-week intervention with alcohol-free beer significantly reduced the transcription of pro-inflammatory interleukins such as IL-1β and TNF. The serum of traditional beer consumers did not exhibit the same capacity as the serum of alcohol-free beer consumers to reduce gene expression of pro-inflammatory interleukins; however, serum from traditional beer consumers showed a regulatory effect at the protein level by significantly decreasing the intracellular protein levels of pro-IL-1β in primed macrophages and preventing cleaved-IL-1β protein release."

For 3 weeks, we evaluated the effect of non-alcoholic beer containing 35 mg of matured hop bitter acids on mood, sleep quality, and work performance. The data of 97 participants (age range: 23-72 years, median age: 42) were analyzed. After the intervention, we found that matured hop bitter acids significantly improved total mood state, including anxiety, depression, fatigue, and vigor, compared with the baseline. Furthermore, sleep quality and absolute presenteeism were significantly improved after the intervention compared with the baseline. The present exploratory study suggested that 3-week supplementation with matured hop bitter acids improved mood and peripheral symptoms in persons of a wide range of ages. Although further investigation is needed, the findings suggested that non-alcoholic beer in daily life might become a choice for maintaining mood states.",

This study investigated the impact of lifestyle factors, such as beer and wine drinking, cigarette smoking, and leisure time screen viewing activities, on body weight and the development of obesity. Individual level data were selected from a random sample of 3471 German adults using a two-stage disproportionate random sampling procedure. The empirical analysis employed a two-stage equations system and combined the endogenous treatment effects model with the quantile regression technique. Our estimations showed that the decisions to smoke and consume wine and beer were positively interrelated, especially in women. Frequent beer/wine drinkers of normal weight were found to have a lower BMI in the male subsample. Quantile regression estimates indicated a significant influence of smoking on BMI in both genders, with smokers' BMI following an upward trend, especially in the upper quantiles of the distribution. Leisure time screen activity was found to have a major impact on females' BMI. Prolonged television viewing and regular computer gaming had a strong relationship with weight increase in overweight women, whereas internet surfing was inversely correlated with the BMI of normal weight and slightly overweight female participants. Nutrition and health policies should direct individuals toward alternative recreational activities in order to substitute screen usage and reduce sedentary time. This study also raised doubts about the general belief that smokers have a lower body weight. As unhealthy behaviors usually co-occur or cluster together, obesity prevention interventions might also contribute to a decrease in smoking.",

Beer is the main food source of isoxanthohumol, a precursor of 8-prenylnaringenin, the strongest phytoestrogen identified to date. As phytoestrogens are reported to reduce perimenopausal symptoms, we evaluated if a daily moderate consumption of beer with (AB) and without alcohol (NAB) could improve menopausal symptoms and modify cardiovascular risk factors. A total of 37 postmenopausal women were enrolled in a parallel controlled intervention trial and assigned to three study groups: 16 were administered AB (330 mL/day), 7 NAB (660 mL/day), and 14 were in the control group. After a 6-month follow-up of the 34 participants who finished the trial, both interventions (AB and NAB) significantly reduced the severity of the menopause-related symptoms (p-value AB vs. Control: 0.009; p-value NAB vs. Control: 0.033). Moreover, AB had a beneficial net effect on psychological menopausal discomforts compared to the control group. As the sex hormone profile did not differ significantly between the study groups, the effects of both types of beers (AB and NAB) are attributed to the non-alcoholic fraction of beer. Furthermore, moderate NAB consumption improved the lipid profile and decreased blood pressure in postmenopausal women.",

In this work, the extraction of seven biogenic amines (cadaverine, histamine, phenylethylamine, putrescine, spermidine, spermine, and tyramine) from beer samples has been simplified using laboratory filter paper as sorbent without any further modification. The analysis of the eluates by direct infusion mass spectrometry reduces the time of analysis, increasing the sample throughput. This simple but effective method enabled the determination of the analytes with limits of detection as low as 0.06 mg L-1 and relative standard deviations better than 11.9%. The suitability of the method has been assessed by analyzing eight different types of beers by the standard addition method.",

The aim of this randomised crossover trial was to estimate the impact of serving draught beer and cider in straight-sided glasses, compared with usual, predominantly curved glasses, on alcohol sales for on-site consumption in bars. METHODS: Twenty-four bars in England completed two intervention periods (A) and two control periods (B) in a randomised order: 1) BABA; 2) BAAB; 3) ABBA; or 4) ABAB. Each period lasted two weeks and involved serving draught beer and cider in either straight-sided glasses (A) or the venue's usual glasses (≥75% curved; B). The primary outcome was the mean volume (in litres) of draught beer and cider sold weekly, compared between A and B periods using a paired-samples t-test on aggregate data. A regression model adjusted for season, order, special events, and busyness. FINDINGS: Mean weekly volume sales of draught beer and cider was 690·9 L (SD 491·3 L) across A periods and 732·5 L (SD 501·0 L) across B periods. The adjusted mean difference (A minus B) was 8·9 L per week (95% CI -45·5 to 63·3; p = 0·737). INTERPRETATION: This study provides no clear evidence that using straight-sided glasses, compared with usual, predominantly curved glasses, reduces the volume of draught beer and cider sold for on-site consumption in bars.",

      "abstract": "We aimed to study the effect of consuming an alcohol-free beer with modified carbohydrates composition (almost completely eliminating maltose and adding isomaltulose (16.5 g day-1) and resistant maltodextrin (5.28 g day-1)) in gut microbiome, compared to regular alcohol-free beer in subjects with T2DM or prediabetes and overweight/obesity. This is a pilot, randomized, double-blinded, crossover study including a sub-sample of a global study with 14 subjects: (a) consuming 66 cl day-1 of regular alcohol-free beer for the first 10 weeks and 66 cl day-1 of modified alcohol-free beer for the next 10 weeks; (b) the same described intervention in opposite order. BMI homogeneously decreased after both interventions. Glucose and HOMA-IR significantly decreased just after the participants consumed modified alcohol-free beer. These findings were in the same line as those reported in the global study. Dominant bacteria at baseline were Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, Proteobacteria and Tenericutes. Parabacteroides, from the Porphymonadaceae family, resulted as the feature with the greatest difference between beers (ANCOM analysis, W = 15). Feature-volatility analysis confirmed the importance of Parabacteroides within the model. Alcohol-free beers consumption resulted in an enhancement of pathways related to metabolism according to PICRUSt analysis, including terpenoid-quinone, lipopolysaccharides and N-glycan biosynthesis. Thus, an alcohol-free beer including the substitution of regular carbohydrates for low doses of isomaltulose and the addition of maltodextrin within meals significantly impacts gut microbiota in diabetic subjects with overweight or obesity. This could, at least partially, explain the improvement in insulin resistance previously found after taking modified alcohol-free alcohol.Clinical Trial Registration: Registered under ClinicalTrials.gov identifier no.

Therefore, the gluten peptidome of an industrial gluten-free prolyl-endopeptidase treated malt beer (<10 ppm gluten) was compared to its untreated counterpart (58 ppm gluten) as a reference. NanoLC-HRMS analysis revealed the presence of 155 and 158 gluten peptides in the treated and reference beer, respectively. Characterisation of the peptides in treated beer showed that prolyl-endopeptidase activity was not complete with many peptides containing (multiple) internal proline-residues. Yet, prolyl-endopeptidase treatment did eliminate complete CD-immunogenic motifs, however, 18 peptides still contained partial, and potentially unsafe, motifs. In the reference beer respectively 7 and 37 gluten peptides carried (multiple) complete and/or partial CD-immunogenic motifs. Worrying is that many of these partial immunogenic gluten peptides do not contain a recognition epitope for the R5-antibody and would be overlooked in the current ELISA analysis for gluten quantification.",

Thirty growing rabbits (758 ± 25.7 g initial body weight) were randomly assigned to control and four treatment groups (containing RBW) in a completely randomized design with six rabbits per group. The study lasted 6 weeks for measurements of feed intake and growth performance followed by a five-day metabolic trial to determine nutrient digestibility and nitrogen balance. The five diets contained RBW at 0% RBW (control group), unsterilized RBW at 10% and 20% and sterilized RBW at 10% and 20% in the concentrates. The average daily body weight gain (ADG) in the 20% unsterilized RBW group was higher (p < 0.01) than the control group. No statistically significant difference (p = 0.089) of ADG was observed for the control vs. the sterilized groups, but the overall ADG was better (p = 0.044) in the unsterilized RBW groups than the sterilized RBW groups. The daily dry matter intake in unsterilized and sterilized RBW groups was higher (p < 0.01) than the control group. However, no difference (p = 0.22) was found between the unsterilized and sterilized RBW. The feed conversion ratio (FCR) was lower for the unsterilized RBW groups vs. the control group (p = 0.041), but there was no difference of FCR in the control vs. sterilized RBW groups (p = 0.37) and the unsterilized RBW groups vs. unsterilized RBW groups (p = 0.14). The digestibility of organic matter, crude protein and crude fibre was greater (p < 0.01) in the unsterilized and sterilized RBW groups than the control group. The nitrogen balance and efficiency of nitrogen utilization were also higher in the unsterilized and sterilized RBW groups than the control group (p < 0.01). The study showed that the dietary RBW could improve growth performance and nutrient utilization in growing rabbits with superior responses for the unsterilized RBW.",

The quality attributes and the volatile compounds loss after the dealcoholisation were checked. The work focused on the sensory properties of the obtained samples. A trained panel evaluated how the chosen sensory descriptors were influenced by the treatment. The results of quality attributes and volatile compounds were in line with works previously published by the authors. Interestingly, the results highlighted that beer characterized by malty character is more suitable than pale lager to be dealcoholised by the osmotic distillation process. The low alcohol milk stout and stout flavour profile, especially in terms of taste, was like the corresponding regular beer. Osmotic distillation was demonstrated to be a feasible process to produce low-alcohol beer."

For such purpose, we searched Scopus.com for any kind of experimental model (in vitro, animal, human observational or intervention) using beer and considering phenols.

Non-alcoholic beer has different compounds that exert antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and nutritional properties. AIM: To evaluate the effect of diet + exercise and non-alcoholic beer on nutritional status, endothelial function and quality of life in patients with cirrhosis. METHODS: In this randomized open clinical trial, patients with cirrhosis were randomized into two groups: The intervention (non-alcoholic beer + diet + exercise) and control (water + diet + exercise) group. Treatment consisted of 330 mL non-alcoholic beer/day or the same amount of water, plus an individualized dietary plan and an exercise program with a pedometer-based bracelet to reach at least 5000 steps/d and > 2500 above the baseline during 8 wk. Endothelial function (flow-mediated dilation, plethysmography), biochemical and nutritional variables and quality of life (CLDQ) were evaluated. RESULTS: Forty-three patients were included in the study, 21 in the control group and 22 in the intervention group. The mean age was 53.5 ± 7.8 years, 60% were women, the median MELD score was 8 (7-10) and most patients were Child-Pugh A (88%). Adherence to the interventions was > 90% in both groups, there were no adverse events and all biochemical parameters remained stable in both groups. Endothelial function improved in both groups. All measured nutritional parameters improved in the intervention group, compared to only 2 in the control group and quality of life improved in both groups; however, more domains improved in the intervention group. CONCLUSION: The intervention consisting of non-alcoholic beer, diet and exercise seems to be safe and well tolerated in patients with cirrhosis, and shows improvement in nutritional status, endothelial function, and quality of life. These results need to be further confirmed."

This review evaluates the bioavailability of melatonin and resulting metabolites, the presence of melatonin in wine and beer and factors that influence it, and finally the different benefits related to treatment with melatonin. When administered orally, melatonin is mainly absorbed in the rectum and the ileum; it has a half-life of about 0.45-1 h and is extensively inactivated in the liver by phase 2 enzymes. Melatonin (MEL) concentration varies from picograms to ng/mL in fermented beverages such as wine and beer, depending on the fermentation process. These low quantities, within a dietary intake, are enough to reach significant plasma concentrations of melatonin, and are thus able to exert beneficial effects. Melatonin has demonstrated antioxidant, anticarcinogenic, immunomodulatory and neuroprotective actions. These benefits are related to its free radical scavenging properties as well and the direct interaction with melatonin receptors, which are involved in complex intracellular signaling pathways, including inhibition of angiogenesis and cell proliferation, among others. In the present review, the current evidence on the effects of melatonin on different pathophysiological conditions is also discussed.",

The potential health benefits of prenylated flavonoids include anti-cancerous activities and treatment of the metabolic syndrome among others. Since prenylated flavonoids from hops have shown pharmaceutical potential in clinical trials, robust analytical methods to determine their concentrations in food, supplements, and beverages are required. One such, the gold standard of analytical methods, is stable isotope dilution analysis due to its ability to compensate matrix effects and losses during sample work-up. As no commercial standards were available, the synthesis of seven different prenylated flavonoid isotopes utilizing various strategies (microwave assistance, acid base catalyst in the presence of deuterated substance and lastly, the use of Strykers catalyst) is described. The produced prenylated flavonoid isotopes were then applied in the first stable isotope dilution analysis method that quantified six natural prenylated flavonoids (Isoxanthohumol, Isoxanthohumol-C, 8-Prenylnaringenin, 6- Prenylnaringenin, Xanthohumol, and Xanthohumol-C) in beer, hop tea and hops to prove its applicability. The SIDA-LC-MS/MS method was validated resulting in LODs and LOQs for all analytes between 0.04 and 3.2 μg/L. Moreover, due to the simple clean-up the developed method allows the prospect for measuring clinical samples in the future."

We carried out a pilot study to test if beer and non-alcoholic beer consumption modify the levels of a panel of 53 cardiometabolic microRNAs in plasma and macrophages. Seven non-smoker men aged 30-65 with high cardiovascular risk were recruited for a non-randomised cross-over intervention consisting of the ingestion of 500 mL/day of beer or non-alcoholic beer for 14 days with a 7-day washout period between interventions. Plasma and urine isoxanthohumol were measured to assess compliance with interventions. Monocytes were isolated and differentiated into macrophages, and plasma and macrophage microRNAs were analysed by quantitative real-time PCR. Anthropometric, biochemistry and dietary parameters were also measured. We found an increase in plasma miR-155-5p, miR-328-3p, and miR-92a-3p after beer and a decrease after non-alcoholic beer consumption. Plasma miR-320a-3p levels decreased with both beers. Circulating miR-320a-3p levels correlated with LDL-cholesterol. We found that miR-17-5p, miR-20a-5p, miR-145-5p, miR-26b-5p, and miR-223-3p macrophage levels increased after beer and decreased after non-alcoholic beer consumption. Functional analyses suggested that modulated microRNAs were involved in catabolism, nutrient sensing, Toll-like receptors signalling and inflammation. We concluded that beer and non-alcoholic beer intake modulated differentially plasma and macrophage microRNAs. Specifically, microRNAs related to inflammation increased after beer consumption and decreased after non-alcoholic beer consumption.",

The choice of flax seeds as a source of FA is based on its high content of ferulic precursors and their intrinsic nutritional value. PEF was applied to ground flax seeds, with and without beta glycosidase. Fermentation was carried out with Saccharomyces and non-Saccharomyces yeast strains. Moreover, 4-vinylguaiacol (4-VG), a flavor highly active derived from volatile phenol, was produced by decarboxylation of ferulic acid (FA), or its precursor and flavor-inactive (4-hydroxy-3-methoxycinnamic acid). All yeast strains could metabolize FA into 4-VG, using the pure compound in the synthetic medium or in flax seeds, with the best quantity produced by Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a precursor. The method yields 4-VG production efficiencies up to 120% (mgL-1). Experimental treatment conditions were conducted with E= 1 kV/cm, total time treatment 15 min (peak time ti = 1 μs, pause time tp = 1 ms, Total pulses 9003). Treatment efficacy is independent of the fermentation yeast."

This work studied the autochthonous Saccharomyces and non-Saccharomyces yeasts, isolated from various food sources, with the ability to modify and improve the fermentative and aromatic profiles during alcoholic fermentation. The ability to ferment maltose and produce desirable aroma compounds were considered as the key characters for the screening selection. A synthetic beer wort was developed for this purpose, to simulate beer wort composition. A total of forty-seven yeast strains belonging to different genera were analysed according to their fermentation profile, volatile compounds production and sensory analysis. Three native strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Zygoascus meyerae and Pichia anomala were selected to evaluate their aromatic profile in single and mixed fermentations. The strains produced 4-vinylguaiacol, β-phenylethyl alcohol, and isoamyl alcohol at levels significantly above the sensory threshold, making them interesting for wheat and blond craft beer styles. The native Hanseniaspora vineae was also included in a co-fermentation treatment, resulting in a promising yeast to produce fruity beers.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Nowadays, the craft beer market is booming and the consumer trend for trying something new is increasing. Here, nine different treatments of a craft beer were realized in a pilot plant, studying fermentation and dry-hopping types. Quality parameters of the beer such as polyphenols, antioxidants, bitterness, colour and alcohol were analysed. In addition, an electronic nose was used to distinguish beer types. RESULTS: Results showed that dry hopping in maturation with warm temperature increased the bitterness from 33 to 40 IBUs. The treatment using two yeasts and two fermentation temperatures resulted in the highest antioxidant capacity of the beer (around 92%). Antioxidant activity was increased by late dry hopping using ale yeasts for fermenting. Principal component analysis performed with electronic nose data explained up to 97% of the total variability of the compounds in the study. CONCLUSIONS: Combined use of ale and lager yeasts seems to increase the antioxidant capacity and total polyphenol content of beer. Antioxidant activity is increased by late dry hopping. An electronic nose is a suitable device for discriminating the volatile profile complexity in beer. © 2020 Society of Chemical Industry.",

In this short work, we review a base of recent papers to confirm whether, or not, moderate consumption of beer and its non-alcoholic components have a beneficial effect of cardiovascular system. Moreover, the present work reviews recently published papers regarding the influence of beer components on the hemostasis, cardiovascular system, and cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). Although most nutritional guidelines recommend a maximum of one beer per day for women and two for men, individual ideals may vary according to age, sex, genetics and body type, as well as drug or supplement use. Moreover, the recommendations for the moderate consumption of beer are often based on individual case reports and often small clinical experiments. In addition, as the health-related effects of beer consumption may also depend on the presence of other dietary components, as well as the type of beer, it is difficult to determine whether moderate consumption is universally safe and beneficial for the cardiovascular system. More randomized clinical trials are needed to determine this. Well-designed clinical trials are also required to determine the influence of various beer components on hemostasis and CVDs, and their effects in combination with drug or supplement therapy.",

      "abstract": "The value of hops (Humulus lupulus L.) in beer production has been undisputed for centuries. Hops is rich in humulones and lupulones which gives the characteristic aroma and bitter taste, and preserves this golden drink against growing bacteria and molds. Besides α- and β-acids, the lupulin glands of hop cones excrete prenylated flavonoids, which exhibit a broad spectrum of biological activities and therefore has therapeutic potential in humans. Recently, interest in hops was raised due to hop prenylated flavanones which show extraordinary estrogen activities. The strongest known phytoestrogen so far is 8-prenylnaringenin (8-PN), which along with 6-prenylanaringenin (6-PN), 6,8-diprenylnaringenin (6,8-DPN) and 8-geranylnaringenin (8-GN) are fundamental for the potent estrogen activity of hops. This review provides insight into the unusual hop phytoestrogens and shows numerous health benefits associated with their wide spectrum of biological activities including estrogenic, anticancer, neuropreventive, antinflamatory, and antimicrobial properties, which were intensively studied, and potential applications of these compounds such as, as an alternative to hormone replacement therapy (HRT).",

Thus, dry-hopping could be an opportunity to compensate for these aroma deficiencies. Therefore, following the sensomics approach, odorants were characterized in dry-hopped (Hallertauer Mandarina Bavaria, Hallertauer Cascade, or Hallertauer Mittelfrüh) top- and bottom-fermented alcohol-free beers either after thermal dealcoholization or stopped fermentation. Twenty-three odorants were quantitated via stable isotope dilution analysis, and odor activity values (OAVs; ratio of concentration to odor threshold) were calculated. Thermally dealcoholized samples showed high losses (up to 100%) of key odorants like 3-methyl-1-butanol or 3-methylbutyl acetate. During stopped fermentation, aroma compounds like ethyl butanoate or 2-phenylethanol were formed in relevant concentrations, leading to OAVs ≥ 1, but the amounts were significantly lower compared to beers with normal alcohol contents. For hop-derived odorants (linalool, geraniol, myrcene, and esters), transfer rates between 20 and 90% were found, leading to OAVs ≥ 1 in beer. Furthermore, hop addition apparently induced the formation of ethyl esters of hop-derived monocarboxylic acids.",

The risk of hyponatremia increases in the case of a combination of beer potomania and the use of thiazide diuretics. CASE REPORT: A 55-year-old male patient with the anamnesis of a long-lasting alcohol use disorder was presented to the emergency department after seizures accompanied by an impaired mental status. He had been drinking beer regularly for ten years. On physical examination, the patient was tachypneic, tachycardic, disorientated, restless, the Glasgow Coma Scale score of 9, observed tremor, and the smell of alcohol from the mouth. Laboratory results showed plasma sodium 105  mmol/L, blood urea nitrogen 1.8 mmol/L, the alcohol concentration in the blood 0.06 g/l, and calculated serum osmolality 219 mOsm/kg H2O. After a detailed initial evaluation of the patient and labs for hyponatremia, a diagnosis of beer potomania was established. On the third day of hospitalization, the patient's anamnesis was filled with information about the use of Valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide, together with reduced salt intake in the diet for three months for arterial hypertension treatment. It was decided that the combination of heavy beer drinking with the use of diuretic and reduced consumption of salt provoked hyponatremia. The patient was treated with infusion therapy of sodium chloride; plasma sodium level reached 136 on the third day of treatment. CONCLUSIONS: This case represents an unusual syndrome of beer potomania in conjunction with hydrochlorothiazide usage and reduced salt consumption, which can result in severe hyponatremia that may provoke severe neurologic damage."

The experiments were conducted at 4 °C in solutions with pH 1.5, pH 2, and pH 3 adjusted employing 85% phosphoric acid. The acid washing treatment of brewing yeasts in the most common pH used (pH 2.0) demanded almost 50 min for the first decimal reduction (δ) of L. brevis DSM 6235. Sensible strains to acid washing such as P. damnosus DSM 20289 demanded almost 70 min for 4 log reductions to be achieved. On the other hand, pH reduction of the acid washing from 2.0 to 1.5 allowed 4 log reduction of L. brevis DSM 6235) to be obtained in less than 50 min, without ruining brewer's yeast viability. Acid washing in pH 1.5 is a viable method for the inactivation of bacterial contaminants of brewing yeasts. Recycling of brewing yeasts through this approach may contribute to a more sustainable and environmental-friendly industry.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: High-intensity interval training (HIIT) is an effective approach to improve physical fitness, but consuming beer, which is a regular practice in many physically active individuals, may interfere with these effects. The purposes of this study were to investigate the effects of a 10-week (2 days/week) HIIT program on cardiorespiratory fitness, muscle strength and power parameters, and also to assess the possible influence on them of a moderate consumption of beer (at least from Monday to Friday) or its alcohol equivalent. METHODS: Young (24 ± 6 years old) healthy adults (n = 73, 35 females) were allocated to five groups. Four groups participated in the HIIT intervention program while the fifth group was a control Non-Training group (n = 15). Participants in the training groups chose whether they preferred receiving alcohol or alcohol-free beverages. Those choosing alcohol were randomized to either beer or ethanol intake: (i) T-Beer group (alcohol beer, 5.4%; n = 13) or (ii) T-Ethanol (sparkling water with vodka, 5.4%; n = 14). Those choosing alcohol-free intake were randomized to (iii) T-Water group (sparkling water, 0.0%; n = 16), or (iv) T-0.0Beer group (alcohol-free beer, 0.0%; n = 15). Men ingested 330 ml of the beverage at lunch and 330 ml at dinner; women ingested 330 ml at dinner. Before and after the intervention, maximal oxygen uptake in absolute and relative terms (VO2max.), maximal heart rate, total test duration, hand grip strength and four types of vertical jumps were measured. RESULTS: HIIT induced significant improvements in absolute and relative values of VO2max, and total test duration (all p < 0.05) in all the training groups; also, clinical improvements were found in hand grip strength. These positive effects were not influenced by the regular intake of beer or alcohol. No changes in the vertical jumps occurred in any of the groups. CONCLUSIONS: A moderate beer or alcohol intake does not mitigate the positive effect of a 10-week HIIT on physical fitness in young healthy adults.

      "abstract": "With a growing interest in non-alcoholic and low alcohol beer (NABLAB), researchers are looking into non-conventional yeasts to harness their special metabolic traits for their production. One of the investigated species is Lachancea fermentati, which possesses the uncommon ability to produce significant amounts of lactic acid during alcoholic fermentation, resulting in the accumulation of lactic acid while exhibiting reduced ethanol production. In this study, four Lachancea fermentati strains isolated from individual kombucha cultures were investigated. Whole genome sequencing was performed, and the strains were characterized for important brewing characteristics (e.g., sugar utilization) and sensitivities toward stress factors. A screening in wort extract was performed to elucidate strain-dependent differences, followed by fermentation optimization to enhance lactic acid production. Finally, a low alcohol beer was produced at 60 L pilot-scale. The genomes of the kombucha isolates were diverse and could be separated into two phylogenetic groups, which were related to their geographical origin. Compared to a Saccharomyces cerevisiae brewers' yeast, the strains' sensitivities to alcohol and acidic conditions were low, while their sensitivities toward osmotic stress were higher. In the screening, lactic acid production showed significant, strain-dependent differences. Fermentation optimization by means of response surface methodology (RSM) revealed an increased lactic acid production at a low pitching rate, high fermentation temperature, and high extract content. It was shown that a high initial glucose concentration led to the highest lactic acid production (max. 18.0 mM). The data indicated that simultaneous lactic acid production and ethanol production occurred as long as glucose was present. When glucose was depleted and/or lactic acid concentrations were high, the production shifted toward the ethanol pathway as the sole pathway. A low alcohol beer (<1.3% ABV) was produced at 60 L pilot-scale by means of stopped fermentation. The beer exhibited a balanced ratio of sweetness from residual sugars and acidity from the lactic acid produced (13.6 mM). However, due to the stopped fermentation, high levels of diacetyl were present, which could necessitate further process intervention to reduce concentrations to acceptable levels."

In this study, we evaluated the effects of IAA intake on the brain structure in healthy middle-aged to older adults. This study was conducted under the Impulsing Paradigm Change through Disruptive Technologies Program (ImPACT) study launched by the Cabinet office of Japan. METHOD: This study employed an open-labeled, single-arm, before and after design. Healthy middle-aged to older adults consumed a beverage containing IAAs (3 mg/190 mL) for 4 weeks.Recently developed magnetic resonance imaging-based brain health indicators were used to evaluate the following brain conditions: the Brain Healthcare Quotient (BHQ) based on gray matter volume (GM-BHQ) and white matter fractional anisotropy (FA-BHQ). RESULTS: In total, 25 subjects were recruited, and GM-BHQ and FA-BHQ were measured before and after intervention. In all subjects, no significant differences in GM-BHQ and FA-BHQ were observed. In subjects aged ≥ 60 years (mean 54.5; standard deviation 3.9) (n = 8), GM-BHQ was significantly increased 4 weeks after intervention compared with that before intervention. CONCLUSION: Intake of beverages containing IAAs might affect brain aging, particularly in healthy older adults, which may prevent the development of neurological disorders. Future studies employing more robust designs can elucidate the effects of IAAs on GM-BHQ and cognitive functions.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Alcohol use is a major risk factor in premature death and disability, especially among youth. Evidence-based policies to prevent and control the detrimental effect of alcohol use have been recommended. In countries with weak alcohol control policies-such as Lebanon, stakeholder analysis provides critical information to influence policy interventions. This paper assesses the views of stakeholders regarding a national alcohol harm reduction policy for youth. METHODS: We interviewed a total of 22 key stakeholders over a period of 8 months in 2015. Stakeholders were selected purposively, to include representatives of governmental and non-governmental organizations and industry that could answer questions related to core intervention areas: affordability, availability, regulation of marketing, and drinking and driving. We analyzed interview transcripts using thematic analysis. RESULTS: Three themes emerged: Inadequacy of current alcohol control policies; weak governance and disregard for rule of law as a determinant of the status quo; and diverting of responsibility towards 'other' stakeholders. In addition, industry representatives argued against evidence-based policies using time-worn strategies identified globally. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that alcohol harm reduction policies are far from becoming a policy priority in Lebanon. There is a clear need to shift the narrative from victim blaming to structural conditions.",

The competitive ELISA is generally considered appropriate for the analysis of hydrolysed gluten, but it is not considered a scientifically valid method for the quantification of gluten in fermented or hydrolysed foods due to the lack of an appropriate reference standard. As no single analytical method can capture the spectrum of gluten-derived products in beer, a comprehensive approach was employed to analyse the intact and hydrolysed fractions of gluten with complementary methods. The combination of PEP addition and diatomaceous earth/perlite filtration was more effective at reducing the concentration of detectable gluten than each of the treatments alone. However, gluten proteins and/or polypeptides were observed in filtered, PEP-treated beers using sandwich ELISA methods, western blot, and bottom-up mass spectrometry. In addition, mass spectrometry results showed that the number of hydrolysed gluten peptides was almost unaffected by the filtration process. Gluten peptides that contained potentially immunopathogenic sequences were identified in the filtered PEP-containing beers by MS. Variability in gluten composition was observed between three replicate pilot-scale productions, suggesting that the gluten profile in beer could differ from batch to batch. As there is uncertainty in the detection and quantification of gluten in hydrolysed and fermented foods, characterisation of hydrolysed gluten by complementary analytical methodologies is recommended.",

      "abstract": "High-intensity interval training (HIIT) is promoted as a time-efficient strategy to improve body composition but concomitant beer intake, which is common among physically active individuals, may interfere with these effects. The primary aim of this study is to determine the effects of a 10-week (2 days/week) HIIT program on anthropometric and body composition measurements, and to assess whether those effects are influenced by the moderate consumption of beer (at least 5 days/week), or its alcohol equivalent. Young (24 ± 6 years old) healthy adults (n = 72, 35 females) volunteered for a non-training group (Non-Training group) or for HIIT training. Those going for training choose whether they preferred to receive alcohol or not. Those choosing alcohol were randomly allocated for receiving beer (5.4%; T-Beer group) or the equivalent amount of alcohol (vodka; T-Ethanol group) in sparkling water. Those choosing no-alcohol were randomly allocated for receiving alcohol-free beer (0.0%; T-0.0Beer group) or sparkling water (T-Water group). From Monday through Friday, men ingested 330 mL of the beverage with lunch and 330 mL with dinner; women ingested 330 mL with dinner. Before and after the intervention, anthropometry and body composition, through dual-emission X-ray absorptiometry, were measured. No changes in body mass, waist circumference, waist/hip ratio, visceral adipose tissue or bone mineral density occurred in any of the groups. By contrast, in all the training groups, significant decreases in fat mass together with increases in lean mass (all p < 0.05) occurred. These positive effects were not influenced by the regular intake of beer or alcohol. In conclusion, a moderate beer intake does not blunt the positive effect of 10-week HIIT on body composition in young healthy adults.",

      "abstract": "Dementia and cognitive decline have become worldwide health problems due to rapid growth of the aged population in many countries. We previously demonstrated that single or short-term administration of iso-α-acids, hop-derived bitter acids in beer, improves the spatial memory of scopolamine-induced amnesia model mice in the Y-maze and enhances novel object recognition in normal mice via activation of the vagus nerve and hippocampal dopaminergic system. However, these behavioral tests do not replicate the stimulus conditions or response requirements of human memory tests, and so may have poor translational validity. In this report, we investigated the effects of iso-α-acids on visual discrimination (VD) and reversal discrimination (RD) using a touch panel-based operant system similar to that used for human working memory tests. In the VD task, scopolamine treatment reduced correct response rate and prolonged response latency in mice, deficits reversed by prior oral administration of iso-α-acids. In the RD task, administration of iso-α-acids significantly increased correct response rate compared to vehicle administration. Previous studies have reported that dopamine signaling is involved in both VD and RD learning, suggesting that enhancement of dopamine release contributes to improved memory performance in mice treated with iso-α-acids. Taken together, iso-α-acids improve VD and RD learning, which are considered high-order cognitive functions. Given the translational advantages of the touch panel-based operant system, the present study suggests that iso-α-acids could be effective for improvement of working memory in human dementia patients."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND & AIMS: The quality of carbohydrates has an essential role in nutritional management of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) because of its substantial impact on glucose homeostasis. Alcohol-free beer has beneficial bioactive components but it has a relatively high glycemic-index so its consumption is restricted in diabetic subjects. We aimed to explore the effect of an alcohol-free beer with modified carbohydrate composition almost completely eliminating maltose and adding isomaltulose (16.5 g/day) and a resistant maltodextrin (5.28 g/day) in comparison to a regular alcohol-free beer on glycemic control of diabetic subjects with overweight or obesity. DESIGN: We randomized 41 subjects into two groups: a) consumption of 66 cL/day of; regular alcohol-free beer for the first 10 weeks and 66 cL/day of alcohol-free beer with modified carbohydrate composition for the next 10 weeks; b) the same described intervention in opposite order. There was a washout period for 6-8 weeks between the two interventions. Participants were counseled to adhere to a healthy diet for cardiovascular health and to increase physical activity. Clinical, biochemical, anthropometric, lifestyle and satiety assessments were performed at the beginning and at the end of each period. RESULTS: Subjects showed significantly weight loss after the two ten weeks periods (-1.69 ± 3.21% and -1.77 ± 3.70% after experimental and regular alcohol-free beers, respectively, P = 0.881). Glucose and glycated hemoglobin did not significantly change after any period. Insulin concentrations and HOMA-IR significantly decreased (-11.1 [-21.3-4.64]% and -1.92 ± 32.8% respectively) after the intake of experimental alcohol-free beer but not after regular alcohol-free beer. Reductions remained statistically significant after adjusting for weight loss, energy intake, physical activity and intervention order. Subjects reported higher satiety scores after consuming experimental alcohol-free beer. CONCLUSIONS: An alcohol-free beer including the substitution of regular carbohydrates for low doses of isomaltulose and the addition of a resistant maltodextrin within meals led to an improvement in insulin resistance in subjects with T2DM and overweight or obesity.

We previously demonstrated that long-term intake of iso-α-acids, which are hop-derived bitter compounds found in beer, prevent Alzheimer's pathology in a rodent model. On the other hand, the effects of iso-α-acids on neural activity in Alzheimer's disease model mice have not been investigated. Here, we demonstrated that short-term intake of iso-α-acids suppresses inflammation in the hippocampus and improves memory impairment even after disease onset. Importantly, we demonstrated that short-term administration of iso-α-acids attenuated the neural hyperactivation in hippocampus. In 6-month-old 5 × FAD mice exhibiting hippocampus inflammation and memory impairment, oral administration of iso-α-acids for 7 days reduced inflammatory cytokines, including MIP-1α and soluble Aβ and improved object memory in the novel object recognition test. In 12-month-old J20 mice, intake of iso-α-acids for 7 days also suppressed inflammatory cytokines and soluble Aβ in the brain. Manganese-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MEMRI) of hippocampi of J20 mice showed increased manganese compared with wild type mice, but iso-α-acids canceled this increased MEMRI signal in J20 mice, particularly in the hippocampus CA1 and CA3 region. Taken together, these findings suggest that short-term intake of iso-α-acids can suppress hippocampus inflammation even after disease onset and improve hyper neural activity in Alzheimer's disease model mice."

Clinical trials have reported that treatment with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs is associated with reduced risk of depression. Moreover, nutritional approaches for the prevention and management of depression have garnered significant attention in recent years. We have previously demonstrated that iso-α-acids (IAAs)-the bitter components in beer-suppress hippocampal microglial inflammation, thereby improving cognitive decline. However, effects of hop-derived components other than IAAs on inflammation have not been elucidated. In the present study, we demonstrated that consumption of matured hop bitter acids (MHBAs) generated from α- and β-acids, which show a high similarity with the chemical structure of IAAs, suppress lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced cytokine productions in the brain. MHBAs administration increased norepinephrine (NE) secretion and reduced immobility time which represents depression-like behavior in the tail suspension test. Moreover, MHBAs components, including hydroxyallohumulinones and hydroxyalloisohumulones, reduced LPS-induced immobility time. Although further researches are needed to clarify the underlying mechanisms, these findings suggest that MHBAs reduce inflammatory cytokine productions and increase NE secretion, thereby improving depression-like behavior. Similarly, inoculation with LPS induced loss of dendritic spines, which was improved upon MHBAs administration. Additionally, vagotomized mice showed attenuated improvement of immobility time, increase in NE level, and improvement of dendrite spine density following MHBAs administration. Therefore, MHBAs activate the vagus nerve and suppress neuronal damage and depression-like behavior induced by inflammation."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Alcohol-induced hangover constitutes a significant, yet understudied, global hazard and a large socio-economic burden. Old folk wisdoms such as \"Beer before wine and you'll feel fine; wine before beer and you'll feel queer\" exist in many languages. However, whether these concepts in fact reduce hangover severity is unclear. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of the combination and order of beer and wine consumption on hangover intensity. METHODS: In this multiarm, parallel randomized controlled matched-triplet crossover open-label interventional trial, participants were matched into triplets and randomly assigned according to age, gender, body composition, alcohol drinking habits, and hangover frequency. Study group 1 consumed beer up to a breath alcohol concentration (BrAC) ≥0.05% and then wine to BrAC ≥0.11% (vice versa for study group 2). Control group subjects consumed either only beer or only wine. On a second intervention day (crossover) ≥1 wk later, study-group subjects were switched to the opposite drinking order. Control-group subjects who drank only beer on the first intervention received only wine on the second study day (and vice versa). Primary endpoint was hangover severity assessed by Acute Hangover Scale rating on the day following each intervention. Secondary endpoints were factors associated with hangover intensity. RESULTS: Ninety participants aged 19-40 y (mean age 23.9), 50% female, were included (study group 1 n = 31, study group 2 n = 31, controls n = 28). Neither type nor order of consumed alcoholic beverages significantly affected hangover intensity (P > 0.05). Multivariate regression analyses revealed perceived drunkenness and vomiting as the strongest predictors for hangover intensity. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings dispel the traditional myths \"Grape or grain but never the twain\" and \"Beer before wine and you'll feel fine; wine before beer and you'll feel queer\" regarding moderate-to-severe alcohol intoxication, whereas subjective signs of progressive intoxication were confirmed as accurate predictors of hangover severity. This trial was prospectively registered at the Witten/Herdecke University Ethics Committee as 140/2016 and retrospectively registered at the German Clinical Trials Register as DRKS00015285.",

In this study, dynamic changes in dissolved organic matter (DOM), bacterial community structure, bacterial associations as well as metabolic functions were investigated using Excitation-Emission Matrix (EEM) spectra, high-throughput sequencing, network and correlation matrix analyses, and Phylogenetic Investigation of Communities by Reconstruction of Unobserved States (PICRUSt). Furthermore, a hypothetical model was proposed to better understand the biodrying process. The results showed that desired performance was obtained and DOM variations revealed that biodrying can increase biostability of the matrix. The bacterial communities differed among different stages of the biodrying. At the phylum level, the dominant phyla were Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes in the mesophilic and cooling phases, whereas Firmicutes became the most dominant phylum in the thermophilic phase. At the genus level, the dominant bacteria in the mesophilic and cooling phases were not obvious, while Ureibacillus and Bacillus were the dominant genera in the thermophilic phase. Network and correlation matrix analyses were useful tools for insights into the bacterial interactions. PICRUSt metagenome inference indicated that metabolism, genetic information processing, and environmental information processing were the primary metabolic pathways. These results allowed us to advance a hypothetical model explaining how succession in bacterial associations regulates the dynamics of a biodrying system.",

      "abstract": "A new method based on a QuEChERS extraction followed by the ultra-high liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) detection has been developed for the analysis of mycotoxin in beer. The method allows the identification and quantification of 23 mycotoxins with different chemical characteristic including regulated, emerging and masked compounds. A sample treatment procedure involving a QuEChERS extraction and dispersive solid-phase clean-up steps was applied. This protocol involves a new approach based on a sample concentration before the extraction. The method was in-house validated in terms of limits of detection (LODs), limits of quantification (LOQs), linearity, repeatability and recoveries. For most compounds, recoveries ranged from 70% to 110% with LOQs (from 0.038 to 30.43 µg/L) lower than the maximum residue levels established in European regulations. In general, acceptable performance characteristics were obtained fulfilling the current legislation. Therefore, the proposed method is appropriate for routine analysis of beer.",

      "abstract": "Iso-α-acids (IAAs) are hop-derived bitter acids of beer. Epidemiologic studies suggest that moderate alcohol consumption is beneficial for cognitive function, but they do not show the ingredients in alcoholic beverages. Previously, we reported that long-term consumption of IAAs prevents inflammation and Alzheimer pathologies in mice, but their effects on cognitive function have not been evaluated. In the present study, we demonstrated that the consumption of IAAs improves spatial and object recognition memory functions not only in normal Crl:CD1(ICR) male mice but also in mice with pharmacologically induced amnesia. IAA consumption increased the total and extracellular levels of dopamine in the hippocampus of mice and Sprague-Dawley male rats, respectively. Dopamine D1 receptor antagonist treatment and knockdown of dopamine D1 receptor expression in the hippocampus attenuated IAA-induced spatial memory improvement. Furthermore, vagotomy attenuated the effects of IAAs in improving spatial and object recognition memory functions and increasing the total level of dopamine in the hippocampus. These results suggest that the consumption of IAAs activates dopamine D1 receptor-signaling in the hippocampus in a vagus nerve-dependent manner and, consequently, improves spatial and object recognition memory functions. Vagal activation with food components including IAAs may be an easy and safe approach to improve cognitive functions.-Ano, Y., Hoshi, A., Ayabe, T., Ohya, R., Uchida, S., Yamada, K., Kondo, K., Kitaoka, S., Furuyashiki, T.

      "abstract": "Excess amounts of uric acid in humans leads to hyperuricemia, which is a biochemical precursor of gout and is also associated with various other disorders. Gout is termed as crystallization of uric acid, predominantly within joints. The burden of hyperuricemia and gout has increased worldwide due to lifestyle changes, obesity, and consumption of purine-rich foods, fructose-containing drinks, and alcoholic beverages. Some of the therapies available to cure gout are associated with unwanted side-effects and antigenicity. We propose an attractive and safe strategy to reduce purine content in beverages using enzymatic application of purine degrading enzymes such as adenine deaminase (ADA) and guanine deaminase (GDA) that convert adenine and guanine into hypoxanthine and xanthine, respectively. We cloned, expressed, purified, and biochemically characterized both adenine deaminase (ADA) and guanine deaminase (GDA) enzymes that play important roles in the purine degradation pathway of Kluyveromyces lactis, and demonstrate their application in lowering purine content in a beverage. The popular beverage beer has been selected as an experimental sample as it confers higher risks of hyperuricemia and gout. Quantification of purine content in 16 different beers from the Indian market showed varying concentrations of different purines. Enzymatic treatment of beer samples with ADA and GDA showed a reduction of adenine and guanine content, respectively. These enzymes in combination with other purine degrading enzymes showed marked reduction in purine content in beer samples. Both enzymes can work at 5.0-8.0 pH range and retain >50% activity at 40°C, making them good candidates for industrial applications."

Additionally, a hypothetical model was provided to better understand the biodrying system. The results showed that fungal diversity decreased after biodrying, while community richness increased in the mesophilic stage and decreased as biodrying progressed. Fungal communities differed in different stages of the biodrying process. Ascomycota and Basidiomycota were the dominant phyla throughout the biodrying process, while Pichia was the dominant genus in the thermophilic stage. Network and correlation matrix analyses provided useful tools for insight into the fungal interactions, allowing us to propose a conceptual model of how succession in fungal associations regulates the dynamics of biodrying systems. Biodrying treatment had a significant effect on fungal trophic modes, with most pathogenic fungi fading away over the process, illustrating that biodrying is an effective bio-treatment method to eliminate pathogenic fungi. These findings provide information that elucidates the fungal interactions and functional characteristics during the biodrying process.",

Previously, we demonstrated that iso-α-acids, the hop-derived bitter components in beer, prevent cognitive impairment in an Alzheimer's disease mouse model. In this report, we investigated the effects of matured hop bitter acids (MHBA) containing components of oxides derived from α- and β-acids, and structurally similar to iso-α-acids, on cognitive function using behavioral pharmacological procedures. MHBA and the representative components of MHBA, 4'-hydroxyallohumulinone (HAH) and 4'-hydroxy-cis-alloisohumulone (HAIH) improved spatial working memory in scopolamine-induced amnesia mice. MHBA also enhanced episodic memory in the novel object recognition test (NORT). The administration of MHBA increased the amount of norepinephrine (NE) and NE release into cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in hippocampus. The MHBA activity in improving memory function was attenuated by treatment with a β-adrenergic receptor inhibitor. In addition, vagotomized mice did not display the memory improvement induced by MHBA. Together, our results suggest that MHBA improves memory function via stimulation of the vagus nerve and enhancement of NE release in the hippocampus. Vagus nerve activation by the intake of food materials including MHBA may be a safe and effective approach for improving cognitive function.",

Harmonious passion is characterized by an autonomous orientation toward an activity, while obsessive passion is characterized by a more controlled orientation toward an activity. Similar but not congruent conceptualizations of approaches to religion have been explored. Moreover, the preponderance of research suggests that religiousness is associated with decreased problematic alcohol use. However, little research has been done into contrasting approaches to religious devotion. We explored harmonious and obsessive passion for religious beliefs and practices and their association with alcohol use and alcohol-related problems. Perceived stress and satisfaction with life were examined as mediators. Participants included 707 undergraduate students (54.8% female) from a large southwestern university who were recruited as a part of a larger alcohol-related intervention trial. Data were collected at three time points: baseline, 3-month follow-up, and 6-month follow-up, and were analyzed prospectively, with passion and mental health at time 1 and time 2 predicting alcohol outcomes at time 2 and time 3. The indirect effects of both obsessive passion and harmonious passion on alcohol problems through perceived stress were significant, and in opposite directions. Additionally, moderation analyses showed that both obsessive and harmonious passion for religion moderated the associations between perceived stress and drinking and between perceived stress and alcohol problems.",

      "abstract": "Consistent epidemiological evidence indicates that low-to-moderate alcohol consumption is inversely associated with cardiovascular event presentation, while high levels of alcohol intake are associated to increased cardiovascular risk. Little is known on the effects of moderate beer intake in the metabolic syndrome. The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of moderate and regular daily intake of beer with meals in overweight (body mass index (BMI) of 28⁻29.9 kg/m²) or obese class 1 (BMI of 30⁻35 kg/m²) individuals without other cardiovascular risk factors (dyslipidemia, type 2-diabetes, hypertension) focusing on the effects related to changes in weight, in lipoproteins and vascular endothelial function. We have performed an open, prospective two-arms longitudinal crossover study to investigate the effects associated with regular consumption (four week) of alcohol-free-beer (0 g alcohol/day) or traditional-beer (30 g alcohol/day in men and 15 g alcohol/day in women) on anthropometrical and biochemical parameters, liver and kidney function biomarkers, and vascular endothelial function. After four-week intervention with traditional and/or alcohol-free beer, BMI did not show any significant change and values for liver and kidney functions were within the normal levels. Moderate traditional beer intake did not affect lipid levels-however it significantly increased the antioxidant capacity of high density lipoprotein (HDL). In addition, apoB-depleted serum (after the four-week intervention period) showed a higher potential to promote cholesterol efflux from macrophages. Beer consumption did not induce vascular endothelial dysfunction or stiffness. In summary, our results based on a 12-week prospective study provide evidence that moderate intake of beer (traditional and alcohol-free) does not exert vascular detrimental effects nor increases body weight in obese healthy individuals. In contrast, moderate intake of beer increases the anti-oxidative properties of HDL and facilitates cholesterol efflux, which may prevent lipid deposition in the vessel wall.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Obesity alters adipose tissue metabolic and endocrine functioning, leading to an increased adiposity and release of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Various phytochemicals have been reported to contribute to the beiging of white adipose tissue in order to ameliorate obesity by increasing thermogenesis. Here, we show that the prenylated chalcone, xanthohumol (XN), induces beiging of white adipocytes, stimulates lipolysis, and inhibits adipogenesis of murine 3T3-L1 adipocytes and primary human subcutaneous preadipocytes and these effects are partly mediated by the activation of the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling pathway. METHODS: 3T3-L1 adipocytes and primary human subcutaneous preadipocytes were differentiated using a standard protocol and were treated with various concentrations of XN, dorsomorphin, an AMPK inhibitor, or AICAR, an AMPK activator, to investigate the effects on adipogenesis, beiging and lipolysis. RESULTS: XN induced beiging of white adipocytes as witnessed by the increased expression of beige markers CIDE-A and TBX-1. XN increased mitochondrial biogenesis, as evidenced by increased mitochondrial content, enhanced expression of PGC-1α, and the thermogenic protein UCP1. Following 24 h of treatment, XN also increased oxygen consumption rate. XN stimulated lipolysis of mature 3T3-L1 and primary human subcutaneous adipocytes and inhibited adipogenesis of maturing adipocytes. XN activated AMPK and in turn, XN-induced upregulation of UCP1, p-ACC, HSL, and ATGL was downregulated in the presence of dorsomorphin. Likewise, an XN-induced decrease in adipogenesis was reversed in the presence of dorsomorphin. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, XN demonstrates anti-obesity effects by not only inducing beiging but also decreasing adipogenesis and inducing lipolysis. The anti-obesity effects of XN are partly mediated by AMPK signaling pathway suggesting that XN may have potential therapeutic implications for obesity."

      "abstract": "Though alcohol use is a widespread behavior, men tend to drink more and experience more alcohol-related negative consequences than do women. Research suggests that individuals are motivated to maintain ingroup status by engaging in behaviors prototypical of the ingroup when group status has been threatened, and that men are particularly likely to do this when masculine ingroup status is threatened. The present study investigated masculine drinking behaviors through a social lens, examining the impact of masculinity threat on alcohol consumption in a simulated bar laboratory. Sixty-five male students ages 21-29 years (Mage = 22.66; 74% White) consumed beer in a taste-test paradigm after being exposed to randomly assigned personality feedback relative to gender standards. This feedback suggested that they were either low in masculinity (threat condition, n = 22) or high in masculinity (control condition, n = 22). A third condition received the low-masculinity feedback and then were exposed to information to undermine masculine alcohol use norms (undermine condition, n = 21) to account for negative affect reduction motives for use. As hypothesized, individuals in the threat condition consumed significantly more alcohol than those in the control and undermine conditions, even though the threat and undermine conditions reported similar levels of negative affect following masculinity threat. These results suggest that consumption of alcohol by men in social contexts may be strongly motivated by the desire to confirm masculine status. This understanding may be used to enhance the effectiveness of alcohol use intervention protocols. (PsycINFO Database Record",

Qualitative in-depth interviews were conducted with 24 female sex workers enrolled in an ongoing community randomised controlled trial of a combination HIV prevention intervention in Iringa, Tanzania. Data were analysed using both inductive and deductive approaches. Findings reveal how routine interactions between female sex workers and their clients occur at three moments of time and space during the sex exchange process to facilitate alcohol consumption and increase women's risk of gender-based violence and HIV. Findings also highlight how sex workers utilise collective agency to address aspects of the sex work environment that place them at risk of alcohol abuse, gender-based violence and HIV. Implications for future interventions to prevent gender-based violence and HIV among female sex workers in Tanzania and similar contexts are discussed.",

The aim of this study is to evaluate the association between moderate consumption of traditional and alcohol-free beer and upper digestive symptoms, gastric accommodation and GER. METHODS: Healthy adults without frequent gastrointestinal symptoms and GER disease were included. The intervention involved administration of traditional beer to 10 subjects (substudy 1) and alcohol-free beer to 20 (substudy 2); control intervention entailed administration of water. Study duration was 2 weeks (control/intervention). Postprandial gastric accommodation was assessed through the maximum tolerated volume during a nutrient drink test after the ingestion of water (day 1) and beer (day 8), in which symptoms of dyspepsia were evaluated every 5 minutes. An impedance-pH monitoring assessed 24 hours and post-NDT GER (days 1 and 8). Symptoms were evaluated daily during the study. The defined variables were compared between visits and weeks using a nonparametric test for paired data. KEY RESULTS: Dyspepsia symptoms showed a progressive increase during the NDT for both interventions in the 2 substudies, though no significant differences were detected in the MTV analysis. No differences were detected in the sum of weekly symptoms. The analysis of impedance-pH monitoring did not show any differences between intervention and control visits for both interventions. CONCLUSIONS AND INFERENCES: Moderate consumption of traditional and alcohol-free beer does not increase dyspeptic symptoms or GER in healthy subjects, whether in a controlled-intake or real-life situation. Neither gastric accommodation nor reflux episodes are modified in this context."

      "abstract": "Occurrence and risk related to nitrosamines, a group of carcinogenic compounds found in some drinking waters and beer, are studied. An analytical method using a solid-phase micro-extraction (SPME) along with gas chromatography (GC) and mass spectrometry (MS) was developed to determine seven N-nitrosamines in drinking water and beer, including N-nitrosomethylamine (NMEA), N-nitrosodiethylamine (NDEA), N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA), N-nitrosodi-n-propylamine (NDPA), N-nitrosopyrrolidine (NPyr), N-nitrosopiperidine (NPip), and N-nitrosodinbutylamine (NDBA). The analysis can be completed in 70 min, and only a 4 mL sample is required, with a detection limit of 0.1-0.8 ng/L for the seven nitrosamines in water and 6-15.7 ng/L in beer. The method was applied to analyze water samples collected from 11 reservoirs and their associated drinking water treatment plants in Taiwan and 10 beer samples from 6 brands with factories located in 6 countries. In the drinking water samples, all seven N-nitrosamines were detected, with NDMA having the highest level at 10.2 ng/L. In the beer samples, NDMA was detected at much lower concentrations (0.12-0.23 μg/L) than the 5 μg/L US standard, while NPip was detected at much higher concentrations (4.1-5.3 μg/L) compared to NDMA. The risk assessment indicates that the risk associated with NDMA is the highest among the studied N-nitrosamines in Taiwan's drinking water, with an average cancer risk of 6.4 × 10-06. For other nitrosamines, the risks are all below 10-6. For the risks associated with N-nitrosamines in beer, NDMA, NDEA, NDPA, and NPip are in the range of 1.5 × 10-05 to 4.6 × 10-04, while that for other nitrosamines are much lower. As for beer, no information for NPip and no modern information for NDEA and NDPA have previously been available, more studies about nitrosamines in beer are suggested for better estimation and control of the risks associated with consumption of beer.",

Beer production implies a variety of operations which might impact the initial level of mycotoxins in a positive or negative way. The complexity of these operations do not give to the brewer a complete control on chemical and biochemical reactions that take place in the batch, but the knowledge about mycotoxin properties can help in identifying the operations decreasing their level in foodstuffs and in the development of mitigation strategies. This review discusses available data about mycotoxin evolution during malting and brewing process. The operations that may lead to a decrease in mycotoxin load are found to be steeping, kilning, roasting, fermentation and stabilization operations applied over the process (e.g. clarification). Also, other general decontamination strategies usually employed in food industry, such as hot water treatment of barley, ozonation or even the use of lactic acid bacteria starter cultures during malting or fermentation are considered.",

However, the gluten content of beers brewed in the presence of PEP cannot be verified since current analytical methods are not able to accurately quantitate gluten in fermented foods. In this work, mass spectrometry was used to qualitatively characterize the gluten in a wheat-gluten-incurred sorghum model beer brewed with and without the addition of PEP. Hydrolyzed gluten peptides and chymotryptic gluten peptides produced from intact gluten proteins were detected in beer brewed in the presence of up to 6 times the manufacturer's recommended dosage of PEP. The observation of chymotryptic gluten peptides indicates that some gluten proteins remained, at least partially, intact after fermentation and enzymatic treatment. Less intact gluten was observed in beer brewed in the presence of PEP, but more hydrolyzed gluten peptides were consequently observed in PEP-containing beer. Gluten peptides that contained immunogenic sequences known to be associated with celiac disease were detected in PEP-containing beer.",

      "abstract": "UNLABELLED: In this work, the main constraint (that is, beer chilling and chill haze removing) of the current beer conditioning techniques using Kieselguhr filtration and Polyvinylpolypyrrolidone (PVPP) treatment was overcome by developing a novel higher-throughput conditioning process, operating at room temperatures with no use of filter aids. The effect of filtration temperature (TF ) in the range of 0 to 40 °C on the hydraulic permeability of ceramic hollow-fiber (HF) membranes with nominal pore size of 0.2 to 1.4 μm, as well as on their limiting permeation flux (J* ) when feeding precentrifuged rough beer, was preliminarily assessed. When using the 1.4-μm HF membrane operating at TF ≥ 20 °C, it was possible to enhance the average permeation flux at values (676 to 1844 L/m2 /h), noticeably higher than those (250 to 500 L/m2 /h) characteristics of conventional powder filtration. Despite its acceptable permanent haze, the resulting beer permeate still exhibited colloidal instability. By resorting to the commercial enzyme preparation Brewers Clarex® before beer clarification, it was possible to significantly improve its colloidal stability as measured using a number of European Brewing Convention forcing tests, especially with respect to that of precentrifuged rough beer by itself. By combining the above enzymatic treatment with membrane clarification at 30 °C across the ceramic 1.4-μm HF membrane module, it was possible to limit the haze development due to chilling, sensitive proteins, and alcohol addition to as low as 0.78, 4.1, and 4.0 EBC-U, respectively, the enzymatic treatment being by far more effective than that using PVPP. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: A novel Kieselguhr- and PVPP-free rough beer conditioning process at room temperatures was set up. By submitting precentrifuged rough beer to commercial preparation Brewers Clarex ® and then to membrane clarification at 30 °C across a ceramic 1.4-μm hollow-fiber membrane module, it was possible to obtain a clear and stable beer with a throughput (1306 ± 72 L/m2 /h) by far higher than that (250 to 500 L/m2 /h) characterizing the current powder filters. The haze development due to chilling, sensitive proteins, and alcohol adding was by far lower than that observed when microfiltering PVPP-pretreated rough beer.",

      "abstract": "The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of ultrasound assisted thermal processing also known as thermosonication (TS) on selected physicochemical and sensorial properties of beer. A typical Chinese lager beer was treated by TS (24kHz frequency and 2.7W/mL volumetric power) for 2min at 40, 50, and 60°C, respectively. The main quality attributes of the beer, such as ethanol content, original extract, pH, and bitterness, were scarcely affected by three TS treatments. However, a significant increase in color value was observed after TS treatment at 60°C during storage. The protein sensitivity and colloidal haze of three TS-treated beers increased slightly. The results also revealed that the development of both yeast and spoilage bacteria (including lactic acid bacteria and aerobic bacteria) was inhibited for 12months of storage for the TS-treated samples except for the TS-treated beer at 40°C. Additionally, the TS-treated beer at 60°C resulted in a higher thermal load relative to other two TS samples (at 40 and 50°C) based on the results of oxidative stability. TS treatment at 60°C also had a minor negative effect on the volatile profile by increasing staling compounds compared with other two TS treatments. These results obtained therefore may serve as a reference of the potential application of the ultrasound assisted thermal treatment for the beer processing.",

      "abstract": "Beer is one of the most frequently consumed fermented beverages in the world, and it has been part of the human diet for thousands of years. Scientific evidence obtained from the development of new techniques of food analysis over the last two decades suggests that polyphenol intake derived from moderate beer consumption may play a positive role in different health outcomes including osteoporosis and cardiovascular risk and the relief of vasomotor symptoms, which are commonly experienced during menopause and are an important reason why women seek medical care during this period; here, we review the current knowledge regarding moderate beer consumption and its possible effects on menopausal symptoms. The effect of polyphenol intake on vasomotor symptoms in menopause may be driven by the direct interaction of the phenolic compounds present in beer, such as 8-prenylnaringenin, 6-prenylnaringenin, and isoxanthohumol, with intracellular estrogen receptors that leads to the modulation of gene expression, increase in sex hormone plasma concentrations, and thus modulation of physiological hormone imbalance in menopausal women. Since traditional hormone replacement therapies increase health risks, alternative, safer treatment options are needed to alleviate menopausal symptoms in women. The present work aims to review the current data on this subject.",
