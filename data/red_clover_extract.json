      "abstract": "The decline in estrogen at menopause poses a critical challenge to cardiovascular and metabolic health. Recently, a growing interest in the role of phytoestrogens, with a particular focus on isoflavones, has emerged as they can bind to estrogen receptors and may mimic the roles of endogenous estrogen. Fermented red clover extract (RC) contains isoflavones with superior bioavailability compared to non-fermented isoflavones, however little is known regarding the impact of isoflavones on cardiovascular and metabolic health. We assessed markers of vascular health in plasma and skeletal muscle samples obtained from healthy but sedentary early post-menopausal women (n = 10; 54 ± 4 years) following 2 weeks of twice daily treatment with placebo (PLA) or RC (60 mg isoflavones per day). The two interventions were administered using a randomized, double-blind, crossover design with a two-week washout period. Plasma samples were utilized for assessment of markers of vascular inflammation. There was a statistically significant reduction (~5.4%) in vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1) following 2 weeks of RC supplementation compared to PLA (p = 0.03). In contrast, there was no effect of RC supplementation compared to PLA on skeletal muscle estrogen receptor content and enzymes related to vascular function, and angiogenesis. Supplementation with RC reduces vascular inflammation in early post-menopausal women and future studies should address the long-term impact of daily supplementation with RC after menopause."

      "abstract": "Objective: To investigate effects of supplementation with a fermented red clover (RC) extract on signaling proteins related to muscle protein synthesis and breakdown at rest and in response to a resistance exercise bout. Methods: Ten postmenopausal women completed a double-blinded cross-over trial with two different intervention periods performed in random order: (A) RC extract twice daily for 14 days, and (B) placebo drink twice daily for 14 days. The intervention periods were separated by a two-week washout period. After each intervention period a muscle tissue sample was obtained before and three hours after a one-legged resistance exercise bout. Muscle strength was assessed before and after each intervention period. Results: Protein expression of FOXO1 and FOXO3a, two key transcription factors involved in protein degradation, were significantly lower and HSP27, a protein involved in cell protection and prevention of protein aggregation was significantly higher following RC extract compared to placebo. No significant treatment × time interaction was observed for muscle protein expression in response to exercise. However, p-mTOR, p-p70S6k and HSP90 protein content were significantly increased in response to exercise in both groups. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that RC extract supplementation downregulates molecular markers of muscle protein degradation compared to placebo in postmenopausal women.",

The tropical edible red clover (Trifolium pratense L.) is rich in polyphenolic compounds which confer the plant potential anticancer properties. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of T. pratense and doxorubicin (DOX) on the apoptosis and proliferation of 4T1 tumor cells in an allograft model of tumor-bearing BALB/c mice. Fifty-six female 4T1-tumor bearing- BALB/c mice were randomly divided into 7 groups (n = 8/group) to receive different doses and combinations of DOX and T. pratense extract for 35 days. On the 36th day, serum estradiol (E2), IL-12 and IFN-γ cytokines, and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activity were measured. Tumor's ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) and the expressions of apoptosis-related genes (p53, Bax, Bcl-2, and caspase-3) were also evaluated. Immunohistochemical staining for Ki-67 and p53 were performed. Our results showed that the co-treatment of DOX and T. pratense (100-400 mg/kg) inhibited the proliferation of 4T1 tumor cells in dose- and time-dependent manners. The co-treatment of DOX and T. pratense (especially at the dose of 400 mg/kg) decreased the serum level of E2 (as a stimulant for breast tumor growth) and increased the serum levels of IL-12 and IFN-γ along with significant increments in serum GPx and tumor FRAP activities. The co-administration of DOX and T. pratense also decreased the expression of Ki-67 proliferation marker and increased the number p53 positive (i.e., apoptotic) cells within tumors. This was accompanied with the upregulation of pro-apoptotic and down-regulation of antiapoptotic genes. The key findings indicated the synergistic effects of DOX and T. pratense against TNBC xenografts."

      "abstract": "To investigate the effects of red clover extract on the blood glucose and lipid levels of type 2 diabetic db/db mice, male db/db mice were treated with this extract for a period of 5 weeks. The red clover extract had a significant effect on lowering the blood glucose levels of db/db mice. The serum triglyceride, serum total cholesterol, liver triglyceride and liver cholesterol levels for diabetic mice receiving red clover extract were significantly lower compared to those of the untreated diabetic mice. The mRNA expression of two target genes transcriptionally regulated by peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)γ was determined by quantitative real-time RT-PCR, and red clover extract was observed to significantly upregulate hepatic glucokinase and CD36 expression. Four target genes transcriptionally regulated by PPARα were also assayed, and red clover extract was observed to significantly downregulate hepatic apolipoprotein C3 expression whereas it had no significant effect on apolipoprotein A5, acetyl CoA oxidase and carnitine palmitoyl transferase-1 expression. In addition, hepatic mRNA expression of fatty acid synthase was also observed to be downregulated by red clover extract treatment. Thus, we conclude that red clover extract significantly improves the glucose and lipid homeostasis in db/db diabetic mice and that these effects are achieved at least in part by activating hepatic PPARα/γ and by inhibiting hepatic fatty acid synthase."

Male diabetic C57BL/6 mice were induced by multiple low-dose STZ administration and then treated with red clover extract or isoflavones for a period of 3 weeks. Red clover extract had no significant effect on lowering the blood glucose levels of STZ-diabetic mice. Similarly, biochanin A and formononetin exerted no hypoglycemic effect. However, the serum triglycerides, total cholesterols and low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol levels for STZ-diabetic mice receiving red clover extract were significantly lower than that of untreated STZ-diabetic mice. In addition, treatment with biochanin A or formononetin significantly ameliorated these lipid profiles in diabetic mice. The mRNA expression of two target genes transcriptionally regulated by peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) α were determined by semi-quantitative RT-PCR and biochanin A or formononetin were found to significantly down-regulate hepatic APOC3 expression, whereas they had no significant effect on hepatic APOA5 expression.

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Inflammation and hyperlipidemia or dyslipidemia contribute to an increased risk of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease. Cardiovascular disease represents one of the major causes of premature death worldwide. The activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) alpha, a drug target for hyperlipidemia and dyslipidemia, leads to an improved blood lipid profile. In this study, we determined the putative anti-inflammatory and PPARalpha stimulatory activities of red clover, an alternative to the classic hormone therapy used currently to treat menopausal symptoms. METHODS: Lipopolysaccharide-induced macrophages were used as a model for anti-inflammatory activity, and a chimeric GAL4-PPARalpha system was used as a model for putative hypolipidemic activity. RESULTS: Red clover extract and the isoflavones genistein and biochanin A were moderate PPARalpha activators. Daidzein only slightly activated PPARalpha, but its metabolite 6-hydroxydaidzein exerted a much higher PPARalpha activity. Similarly, the metabolite 3'-hydroxygenistein achieved higher activation efficiency than its precursor, genistein, did. In lipopolysaccharide-stimulated macrophages, red clover extract and its compounds reduced the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines, interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor alpha, increased the secretion of the anti-inflammatory interleukin-10, and/or reduced the expression of nuclear factor-kappaB, inducible nitric oxide synthase, and/or cyclooxygenase 2. Tumor necrosis factor alpha production was most efficiently reduced by biochanin A and genistein. Interleukin-6 levels were most efficiently reduced by genistein and equol. CONCLUSIONS: Owing to its PPARalpha activation and modulation of the secreted cytokine profile, red clover extract is a putative candidate for preventing atherosclerosis and, thus, cardiovascular disease.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Currently, red clover extract is used to treat menopausal disorders as an alternative to classic hormone therapy. Several human and animal studies have attributed hypolipidemic, hypoglycemic, or antiatherosclerotic effects to red clover extract or isoflavones. This study was designed to determine the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) gamma activation by red clover extract. DESIGN: The PPARgamma binding affinities and the transactivation activities of red clover extracts, isoflavones, and their metabolites were analyzed. The presence of specific substances in the extracts was proved by high-performance liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization/mass spectrometry. RESULTS: The red clover extracts and the compounds genistein and biochanin A were potent PPARgamma ligands and activators. Several metabolites exerted higher binding affinities or transactivational activities than their precursor molecules. 6-Hydroxydaidzein exerted a more than 100-fold higher binding affinity than its precursor daidzein. The maximal transactivational activity of 6-hydroxydaidzein and 3'-hydroxygenistein exceeded even that of rosiglitazone, a known PPARgamma agonist. Equol and O-desmethylangolensin showed an approximately fivefold higher binding affinity and, in the case of O-desmethylangolensin, a fourfold higher PPARgamma agonistic activity than the precursor. The daily dose of Menoflavon forte, a widely used red clover extract for treatment of menopausal disorders, provides theoretically 15% to 30% of the daily recommended dose of rosiglitazone. Considering the more active metabolites formed, activity must be higher in vivo. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that red clover extracts, the major compounds, and especially several main metabolites exert significant PPARgamma binding and transactivational activity. Red clover extract, which is currently used for treating menopausal disorders, could be simultaneously used for ameliorating the metabolic syndrome.",
