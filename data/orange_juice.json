      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: 'Not-from-concentrate' (NFC) orange juice faces stability challenges. Its rheological properties are also important for optimizing processes such as pumping. These issues affect companies in terms of their cost implications, and they affect product quality and consumer acceptance directly. This study investigates the rheological properties of NFC orange juice subjected to high-pressure homogenization (HPH) following high-pressure processing (HPP). RESULTS: The viscosity coefficient (k) of HPH-treated orange juice reduced significantly, by 92.16%, and was accompanied by a 163.82% increase in the flow coefficient (n) and a 48.12% increase in zeta potential. High-pressure processing treatment reduced viscosity effectively while enhancing the fluidity and stability of the orange juice. However, no significant differences were observed in the major functional groups or particle size distribution in comparison with a thermal pasteurization (TP) group. Alterations in the polysaccharide structure were identified as the primary reason for the observed changes in rheological properties. Specifically, the molecular weight (Mw) of soluble dietary fiber (SDF) increased, whereas the Mw of cellulose decreased in the HPP treated juice. This correlated with the results for viscosity, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and scanning electron microscope (SEM) analyses. CONCLUSION: In comparison with the TP group, the fluidity, and stability of HPH orange juice after HPP were enhanced significantly, and the viscosity was reduced. This speeds up the juice-pumping process, reducing energy consumption and costs. The combination of HPP and HPH pretreatment effectively improved the physical properties and sensory quality of orange juice. © 2025 Society of Chemical Industry."

      "abstract": "UV-C light is an alternative for preserving clear fruit-based drinks, replacing existing thermal treatments that degrade product quality and are ineffective against some microorganisms, including Alicyclobacillus acidoterrestris, a spoiling agent of concern in the juice sector. Texturizing agents are essential since consumers' preferences for these products strongly depend on the mouthfeel. However, the complexity of the treated texturized system may have an essential influence on UV-C effectiveness. The main goal of this study was to evaluate the effect of texturization on the UV-C inactivation of A. acidoterrestris spores (AA) and separate cocktails of Escherichia coli (ECC), yeast (YC), and Salmonella (SC) in orange juice. Binary combinations (0.0 to 0.3 % w/v) of carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) and guar gum (GG) were added to orange juice (OJ). A multiple regression analysis identified suitable CMC and GG combinations with optimal viscosity (~ 20 mPa.s) and maximum suspended particles (%S), leading to two formulations: TOJ1 (0.075 % w/v CMC + 0.15 % w/v GG at five °C) and TOJ2 (0.045 % w/v CMC + 0.165 % w/v GG). A consumer field test confirmed the advantages of sweetness, bitterness, flavor, color, and body/viscosity, establishing it as the best formulation. UV-C assisted by mild heat (UV-C/H) inactivation in OJ and TOJ1 was determined (1651 mJ/cm2, 50 °C, 1.8 L/min). Single treatments (UV-C and H) were also performed to evaluate synergy. The UV-C/H induced damage on AA spores was measured by flow cytometry (FC) labeling with fluorescein diacetate (FDA) and propidium iodide (PI) for monitoring membrane integrity. The bacterial cocktails were the most sensitive to the UV-C treatments, followed by YC and AA. UV-C achieved moderate inactivation (1.6-4.6 log reductions) in non-texturized OJ, while UV-C/H significantly enhanced microbial sensitivity (3.4-7.5 log reductions). Texturization slightly reduced UV-C effectiveness, achieving 2.9-5.2 log reductions in TOJ1. The Weibull model provided the best fit characterizing UV-C inactivation with evidence of subpopulations of different resistances. In TOJ1 treated by UV-C/H, the flow cytometry study revealed membrane-compromised AA spores with a gradual increase of PI+ cells with treatment time. The scanning electron micrographs showed structural damage, less evident in the texturized system. The results suggest that UV-C can be used to process texturized orange juice and could be a promising alternative for controlling Alicyclobacillus spp. spores and other microbial strains in industrialized orange juice.",

      "abstract": "Orange juice is a highly nutritious beverage. Traditional pasteurization methods cause nutrient loss and taste changes. Plasma treatment (PT) is an emerging method with a high sterilization rate. This study investigated the effects of corona discharge plasma on the sterilization of orange juice by changes in color difference, total phenol content, and pH value. Single-factor experiments revealed that higher voltage (40 kV) and longer sterilization time (25 min) had better sterilization effects. Response surface analysis indicated that frequency had the greatest impact on sterilization rates, and the optimal sterilization conditions were a voltage of 44.75 kV, a frequency of 9.46 kHz, and a sterilization time of 25 min. Under these conditions, the sterilization rate reached 97.9%, meeting the national standard of 104 colony-forming units/mL (GB7101-2022). Compared to untreated juices, the color difference value was 16.32, the pH value decreased by 0.12, and the total phenol content increased by 0.669 mg/mL. However, the evaporation of water plays an important role in increasing the total phenol co. Moreover, the comparative analysis showed that PT was comparable to pasteurization in terms of sterilization effects, flavor preservation, and the concentration of bioactive components. This study provides a theoretical basis for industrial applications of PT.",

      "abstract": "This study investigated the synergistic effects of ammonium persulfate (PS) and ultrasound (US) on the inactivation of Escherichia coli O157:H7 in buffered peptone water (BPW) and orange juice products. A comprehensive assessment of PS concentrations ranging from 1 to 300 mM, considering not only the statistical significance but also the reliability and stability of the experimental outcomes, showed that 150 mM was the optimal PS concentration for the inactivation of E. coli O157:H7. Additionally, US output intensities varying from 30 % to 60 % of the maximum US intensity were evaluated, and 50 % US amplitude was found to be the optimal US condition. A 50 % amplitude setting on the sonicator corresponds to half of its maximum displacement, approximately 60 μm, based on a maximum amplitude of 120 μm. The inactivation level of E. coli O157:H7 was significantly enhanced by the combined treatment of PS and US, compared to each treatment of PS and US alone. In the BPW, a 10-min treatment with the combination of PS and US resulted in a significant synergistic inactivation, achieving up to a log reduction of 3.86 log CFU/mL. Similarly, in orange juice products, a 5-min treatment with the combination of PS and US yielded a significant synergistic inactivation, with a reduction reaching 5.90 log CFU/mL. Although the treatment caused a significant color change in the sample, the visual differences between the treated and non-treated groups were not pronounced. Furthermore, the combined treatment in orange juice demonstrated significantly enhanced antimicrobial efficacy relative to BPW. Despite identical 5-min treatment periods, the application in orange juice resulted in a substantially higher log reduction of E. coli O157:H7, achieving 7.16 log CFU/mL at a reduced PS concentration of 30 mM, whereas the same treatment in BPW yielded only a 2.89 log CFU/mL reduction at a PS concentration of 150 mM, thereby highlighting its significantly superior antimicrobial performance in orange juice. The mechanism underlying microbial inactivation, induced by the combined treatment of PS and US, was identified as significant cell membrane damage. This damage is mediated by sulfate radicals, generated through the sono-activation of persulfate. In addition, the low pH of orange juice, measured at 3.7, is likely to have further deteriorated the E. coli O157:H7 cells compared to BPW (pH 7.2), by disrupting their cell membranes, proton gradients, and energy metabolism. These findings underscore the effectiveness of PS and US integration as a promising approach for non-thermal pasteurization in the food industry. Further research is needed to optimize treatment parameters and fully explore the practical application of this technique in large-scale food processing operations. Sensory evaluation and nutritional assessment are also necessary to address the limitations of PS.",

Fifty-three high-risk individuals were randomly assigned to one of two groups. Over 8 weeks, one group consumed a vitamin D3 and probiotic-enriched OJ and the other regular OJ (control). Diets remained unchanged and were documented through food diaries. Measures of metabolic and inflammatory markers and blood pressure were measured at the start and end of the study. Post-intervention, the enriched OJ group showed the following significant metabolic improvements (without changes in triglycerides, inflammation, or central blood pressure): reduced fasting insulin, peripheral blood pressure, body weight (-1.4 kg 95% CI: -2.4, -0.4), energy (-270 kcal 95% CI: -553.2, -13.7), macronutrient (dietary fat -238 kcal 95% CI: -11.9, -1.0; carbohydrates -155 kcal 95% CI: -282.4, -27.3; sugars -16.1 g 95% CI: -11.9, -1.0) intake, and better lipid profiles (total cholesterol -10.3 mg/dL 95% CI: -21.4, 0.9; LDL-C -7 mg/dL 95% CI: -13.5, -0.5). The enriched OJ led to weight loss, less energy/macronutrient consumption, improved lipid profiles, and increased insulin sensitivity after 8 weeks in those following a Westernized diet, thus indicating potential benefits for cardiometabolic risk.

      "abstract": "The metabolism and absorption of citrus flavanones are intrinsically linked to the gut microbiota, creating a bidirectional relationship where these compounds influence the microbiome, and in turn, the microbiota affects their metabolism. This study evaluates the effect of acute and chronic consumption of orange juice (OJ) on the urinary excretion of gut-derived flavanone metabolites and the gut microbiota. Health volunteers ingested 500 mL of OJ for 60 days in a single-arm human intervention study. Blood and feces were collected at baseline and after 60 days, with an additional 24-hour urine collection after a single dose on day 1 and day 63. LC-MS/MS analyzed urinary flavanone metabolites, while 16S rRNA sequencing characterized gut microbiota. Total urinary hesperetin conjugates excretion significantly decreased over 60 days, while gut-derived total phenolic acids, particularly three hydroxybenzoic acids, increased. Moreover, the heterogeneity of the total amount of flavanone conjugates, initially categorizing individuals into high-, medium- and low- urinary excretor profiles, shifted towards medium-excretor, except for five individuals who remained as low-excretors. This alteration was accompanied by a decrease in intestinal β-glucosidase activity and a shift in the relative abundance of specific genera, such as decreases in Blautia, Eubacterium hallii, Anaerostipes, and Fusicatenibacter, among which, Blautia was associated with higher urinary flavanone conjugates excretion. Conversely, an increase in Prevotella was observed. In summary, chronic OJ consumption induced transient changes in gut microbiota and altered the metabolism of citrus flavanones, leading to distinct urinary excretion profiles of flavanone metabolites.",

MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this in vitro, experimental study, the microhardness of 24 sound-extracted third molars was measured by a Vickers tester. The teeth were then randomly assigned to three groups (n = 8) of nano-HA toothpaste (Pharmed), 1.23% sodium fluoride gel, and artificial saliva. The teeth were exposed to orange juice for 5 min daily for 7 days and were then exposed to nano-HA toothpaste, fluoride gel, or artificial saliva (depending on their group allocation) for 10 min a day. The microhardness of the teeth was measured again after 7 days. Data were analyzed using paired t-test, analysis of variance, and Bonferroni test (alpha = 0.05). RESULTS: Within-group comparisons showed a significant reduction in microhardness of the teeth after the intervention in artificial saliva (P = 0.000), and fluoride gel (P = 0.002) groups. However, no significant reduction occurred in the microhardness of the nano-HA group, compared with the baseline (P = 0.132). Between-group comparisons revealed no significant difference in the microhardness of the three groups at baseline (P > 0.05). However, after the intervention, the microhardness of the nano-HA group was significantly higher than that of other groups (P < 0.05). However, the difference in secondary microhardness between fluoride gel and artificial saliva groups was not significant (P = 1.00). CONCLUSION: Pharmed toothpaste containing nano-HA has optimal efficacy for remineralization of enamel erosive lesions induced by exposure to orange juice."

      "abstract": "Isochoric (constant volume) freezing is a novel food preservation technology that has demonstrated the ability to preserve food products at subfreezing temperatures in an unfrozen state, thereby avoiding the detrimental effects of ice formation. It minimizes the quality loss of fresh fruits and juices, increases their nutrient content, and reduces microbial counts. Orange juice (OJ) samples were subjected to conventional freezing (CF) and isochoric freezing (IF) for 7 days and then stored at 4°C for an additional 7 days. We evaluated the microbiological and physicochemical quality of CF and IF OJ before and after storage. The IF was performed at three different conditions: -5°C/73 MPa, -10°C/93 MPa, and -15°C/143 MPa. The results indicate that the total aerobic count of OJ remained below the detection limit after heat treatment, 7 days of CF and 7 days of IF. Yeast and mold counts increased in fresh and CF OJ after 7 days of storage at 4°C, whereas IF OJ remained below the detection limit. Less color difference was observed in IF (-15°C/143 MPa) OJ compared to heat-treated and CF OJ. Heat treatment inactivated 42% of pectin methylesterase (PME), whereas 7-day long IF increased PME activity up to 150%. Additionally, IF (-15°C/143 MPa) OJ showed reduced pulp sedimentation, which can be advantageous, as sedimentation in juices has been a recognized technological issue in the juice industry. Ascorbic acid level was significantly higher in IF (-15°C/143 MPa) OJ compared to fresh and CF OJ after storage.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Consumers are seeking healthier alternatives to traditional confectioneries. They value the use of sugar replacers, more natural ingredients and/or environmentally friendly preservation technologies. UV-C light is considered an emerging alternative to thermal pasteurization that leaves no residue and requires minimal energy. The present study aimed to investigate the effect of novel sweetener combinations and juice UV-C assisted by mild heat treatment (UV-C/H) on the physicochemical, microbiological, morphological, rheological and sensory properties of orange juice pectin-based confectioneries stored at 5 ± 1 °C for 35 days. RESULTS: For orange juice processing, UV-C/H (pilot-scale Dean-flow reactor; 892 mJ cm-2 ; 50 ± 1 °C) and thermal (T-coil, 80 °C; 6 min) treatments were used. Low-calorie confectionery gels were elaborated using the treated juices, low-methoxyl pectin and various sweetener combinations. UV-C/H and T-coil effectively inactivated juice native microbiota. The proposed formulations, derived from a previous Box-Behnken optimization study, included partial (F1: 3%-sucrose-S + 0.019%-rebaudioside-A-RA) or complete sucrose replacement (F2: 5.5%-erythritol-E + 0.019%-RA), and one control (C:10%-S). In general, the microbiota of the gels prepared with the UV-C/H or T-coil treated juices did not recover during storage. The physicochemical and mechanical parameters of the formulations were significantly influenced by the choice of sweetener and the duration of storage. The gel surface got smoother and had fewer holes when the sucrose level dropped, according to a scanning electron microscopy study. The UV-C/H-treated samples did not differ in acceptability, whereas the measured sensory attributes approached ideal levels. F1 and F2 showed distinctive temporal-dominance-of-sensations profiles, mainly dominated by sweetness and orange taste, respectively. However, consumers perceived sourness and astringency in C during consumption. CONCLUSION: The present study provides significant evidence in support of the development of confectionery gels F1 and F2 made from fruit juice treated by UV-C light assisted by mild heat and combinations of sucrose-alternative sweeteners. In terms of the properties investigated, these confectionery gels were comparable to, or even outperformed the full-sucrose option. © 2023 Society of Chemical Industry.",

      "abstract": "Dental caries is one of the most prevalent chronic diseases globally in both children and adults. This study investigated the potential of industrial sweet orange waste extracts (ISOWE) as a substitute for chlorhexidine (CHX) in managing dental caries. First, the cytotoxicity of ISOWE (40, 80, 120 mg/mL) and CHX (0.1 and 0.2%) on buccal epithelial cells was determined. ISOWE exhibited no overall toxicity, whereas CHX strongly affected cell viability. The combination of ISOWE and CHX significantly enhanced cell proliferation compared to CHX alone. Next, the antimicrobial efficacy of ISOWE, CHX, and their combination was assessed against a 7-day complex biofilm model inoculated with oral samples from human volunteers. CHX exhibited indiscriminate antimicrobial action, affecting both pathogenic and health-associated oral microorganisms. ISOWE demonstrated lower antimicrobial efficacy than CHX but showed enhanced efficacy against pathogenic species while preserving the oral microbiome's balance. When applied to a cariogenic biofilm, the combined treatment of ISOWE with 0.1% CHX showed similar efficacy to 0.2% CHX treatment alone. Overall, the findings suggest that ISOWE is a promising natural anti-cariogenic agent with lower toxicity and enhanced selectivity for pathogenic species compared to CHX.",

      "abstract": "This study investigated the impact of a support matrix and active group on the support to the nutritional properties of orange juice after juice clarification. Pectinase was immobilized on chitosan and aminated silica supports, activated with genipin or glutaraldehyde, and applied for juice clarification. The effects on various juice properties, including reducing sugars, total soluble solids, vitamin C, and phenolic compounds, juice color, and pH, were evaluated. The results revealed that the immobilization on chitosan activated using genipin resulted in the highest biocatalyst activity (1211.21 U·g-1). The juice treatments using the biocatalysts led to turbidity reduction in the juice (up to 90%), with the highest reductions observed in treatments involving immobilized enzyme on chitosan. Importantly, the enzymatic treatments preserved the natural sugar content, total soluble solids, and pH of the juice. Color differences between treated and raw juice samples were especially relevant for those treated using enzymes, with significant differences in L* and b*, showing loss of yellow vivid color. Analysis of phenolic compounds and vitamin C showed no significant alterations after the enzymatic treatment of the raw juice. According to our results, the clarification of orange juice using immobilized enzymes can be a compromise in turbidity reduction and color reduction to maintain juice quality."

Thus, studies with the application of new probiotic products are needed in the prevention/treatment of these clinical conditions. The objective of this work was to evaluate the effects of probiotic orange juice containing Pediococcus acidilactici CE51 in a murine model of colitis. 45 male Swiss lineage mice were used, divided into five groups (n = 9): control, colitis, colitis + probiotic (probiotic orange juice containing CE51), colitis + placebo (orange juice) and colitis + sulfasalazine (10 mg/kg/Weight). The induction of colitis was performed with dextran sodium sulfate (3%). The treatment time was 5 and 15 days after induction. Histopathological analysis, serum measurements of TNF-α and C-reactive protein and metagenomic analysis of feces were performed after euthanasia. Probiotic treatment reduced inflammation in the small intestine, large intestine and spleen. The probiotic did not alter the serum dosages of TNF-α and C-reactive protein. Their use maintained the quantitative ratio of the phylum Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes and increased Lactobacillus helveticus with 15 days of treatment (p < 0.05). The probiotic orange juice containing P. acidilactici CE51 positively modulated the gut microbiota composition and attenuated the inflammation induced in colitis.",

      "abstract": "Blood orange juice is an important source of flavanones and anthocyanins, mainly hesperidin, narirutin, and cyanidin-3-O-glucoside. The benefits of these bioactive compounds have been reported, but the mechanistic details behind their biological effects are not well established. This study investigated the effects of Moro orange (Citrus sinensis L. Osbeck) juice (MOJ) on gut microbiota composition and cardiometabolic biomarkers in overweight women. In this study, 12 overweight women (BMI from 25.0 to 29.9 kg/m2), aged 18-37 years, consumed 500 mL of MOJ every day for 4 weeks. We assessed the gut microbiota composition, levels of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), cardiometabolic biomarkers, and insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) at baseline and after 2 weeks and 4 weeks of MOJ intake. The results suggested that MOJ intake affected the abundance of specific operational taxonomic units (OTUs) of the gut microbiota but did not significantly alter the diversity and general composition of the gut microbiota. However, MOJ intake increased the production of SCFAs, especially propionic and isobutyric acids, and significantly improved cardiometabolic biomarkers such as blood pressure and plasma VCAM-1 levels in the overweight women. Additionally, we observed significant associations between gut microbiota OTUs belonging to the Bacteroidetes phyla and Prevotella 9 genera and the cardiometabolic biomarkers. Furthermore, MOJ reduced fasting glucose and insulin levels and HOMA-IR values, thereby enhancing insulin sensitivity in the insulin-resistant overweight women. Finally, we highlighted the importance of orange juice intake duration because some beneficial changes such as blood pressure improvements were evident at the 2-week time interval of the intervention, but other changes became significant only at the 4-week interval of MOJ intake. In conclusion, our study demonstrated that changes in specific OTUs of the gut microbiota in response to MOJ intake were associated with significant improvements in some cardiometabolic biomarkers and SCFA levels in overweight women with insulin resistance."

Thus, our study assessed the cold plasma treatment as an alternative method against Escherichia coli and Candida albicans in 'Lima' orange juice. Both, plasma and heat treatments, reduced the amount of E. coli in the juice, inactivating 16.72 and 100%, respectively. Plasma did not inactivate C. albicans, but heat treatment inactivated 100%. Plasma and heat treatment increased Hue angle and luminosity (more yellowish juice). Plasma reduced vitamin C, carotenoids, and polyphenols content, while increased flavonoids. Heat treatment reduced the carotenoid content. However, neither heat nor plasma treatment altered the antioxidant activity. The plasma treatment reduced the intensity of color (chroma), the soluble solids content and the acidity ratio, total sugars, and the vitamin C content of juice compared to the heat-treated and control juices. Plasma-treated juice showed increased levels of yellow flavonoids, total phenolics and antioxidant activity until the 12th day of storage.",

Recently, these technologies have also shown promising applications to reduce mycotoxin levels in food products. Therefore, the objective of this study is to investigate the potential of the combined treatments USN + PEF and PEF + USN on the reduction of Ochratoxin A (OTA) and Enniatins (ENNs) of an orange juice mixed with milk beverage. For this purpose, the beverages were elaborated in the laboratory and individually spiked with mycotoxins at a concentration of 100 µg/L. They were then treated by PEF (30 kV, 500 kJ/Kg) and USN (20 kHz, 100 W, at a maximum power for 30 min). Finally, mycotoxins were extracted using dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction (DLLME), and liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS-IT) was employed to determine them. The results showed promising applications, with reductions up to 50% for OTA and up to 47% for Enniatin B (ENNB) after the PEF + USN treatment combination. Lower reduction rates, up to 37%, were obtained with the USN + PEF combination. In conclusion, the combination of USN and PEF technologies could be a useful tool to reduce mycotoxins in fruit juices mixed with milk."

      "abstract": "Not from concentrate (NFC) orange juice is minimally processed, natural-appearing food, and has become more popular. Sterilization is an important stage for NFC orange juice production. Here we present a comprehensive analysis of the effect of sterilization on the metabolites of NFC orange juices, including three thermal (pasteurization, high-temperature short time, and ultra-high temperature) and one nonthermal (high hydrostatic pressure) method. A total of 108 metabolites, including 59 volatiles and 49 nonvolatiles were identified in orange juice. Of which, only butyl butanoate and 3-carene were detected in fresh orange juice. Sterilization significantly changed the metabolites of orange juice, and different methods caused various changes. Esters were downregulated by both thermal and nonthermal sterilization, while most flavonoids and terpenes were upregulated. With comparative analyses of three thermal sterilization, we found that high temperature and relatively short-time treatment preserved esters and ascorbic acid more effectively than low temperature and prolonged treatment. Aldehydes, however, were the opposite. Nonthermal sterilization is effective in preserving the metabolites of orange juice, especially for esters, terpenes, and flavonoids. In addition, 19 distinct metabolites were characterized between thermal and nonthermal samples by chemometrics analysis. These findings provide a new sight of the optimization of sterilization methods and references for different types of NFC orange juice identification. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: This study provides a reference for the optimization of sterilization methods and identification of HHP and thermal NFC orange juice and also benefits the purchase of consumers.",

We aim to reveal health outcomes of diet intervention (FJ or FB) with system profiling via interaction of gut microbiota and metabolomics in a rat (Rattus norvegicus) model. Firstly, the glucose, sucrose, fructose, and bioactive metabolites of FJ and FB were analyzed, and FJ possessed higher sucrose and flavonoids, while FB showed higher glucose and fructose. Secondly, C0 was set as the control group on Day 0, and a 4-week diet invention was performed to control, FJ-intake, and FB-intake groups with normal saline, FJ, and FB, respectively. The results showed that FJ improved alpha diversity and decreased the Firmicutes/Bacteroidota ratio (F/B ratio) of gut microbiota and prevented insulin resistance. However, FB possessed unchanged microbial diversity and enhanced F/B ratio, causing insulin resistance with renal triglyceride accumulation. In summary, FJ, although naturally containing similar amounts of total free sugars as FB, could be a healthier drink choice."

The present study focuses on the application of a combined microwave-ultrasound system for the optimization of the inactivation of Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 in an orange juice drink. Using response surface methodology (RSM), trials were planned with a Box-Behnken Design (BBD) to maximize the impact of microwave power (A: 300-900 W), microwave treatment time (B: 15-35 s), and time of ultrasound (C: 10-30 min) on E. coli inactivation. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was carried out and E. coli inactivation was expressed with a mathematical equation depending on the factors. The results showed that both the microwave treatment time and the time of ultrasound were effective as independent variables in eliminating the E. coli strain. However, the effect of these two variables, ultrasound and microwave exposure time, in combination was significantly greater than when examined separately. RSM modeling determined that optimal treatment conditions include 900 W microwave power, 33 s microwave treatment time, and 20 min time of ultrasound to achieve an 8-log reduction of E. coli, constituting total inactivation. The results of this study showed that ultrasound-microwave treatment is a potential alternative processing method for an orange juice beverage."

In this study, the effect of these PEF conditions (E = 0.9 and 2.7 kV/cm, with pulse duration 1000 µs) at variable maximum temperatures was evaluated on quality attributes of freshly squeezed orange juice. Results were compared to orange juice that received no treatment or a mild or severe thermal pasteurization treatment. No differences for pH and soluble solids were found after application of any treatment, and only small differences were observed for color and vitamin C content (ascorbic acid and dehydroascorbic acid) after processing, mainly for conditions applied at higher temperature. Variations in the maximum temperatures of the PEF and thermal processes led to differences in flavor compounds and the remaining activity of pectinmethylesterase (PME). At PEF conditions with a maximum temperature of 78 °C or higher, PME activity levels were below a critical value, meaning that the cloud is stable. At this temperature volatiles associated with fresh juice (such as octanal and nonanal) are statistically identical to untreated juice, while they are statistically distinguishable from thermal treated. This papers demonstrates the potential of using moderate intensity PEF as an adequate alternative to thermal pasteurization of orange juice with a better retention of the fresh flavor."

For this purpose, oranges from seven different varieties were collected during the harvest years of 2013−2014 and 2014−2015 from central and southern Greece. The physico-chemical parameters that were determined included: electrical conductivity, acidity, pH, and total soluble solids. The flavonoids: hesperidin, neohespseridin, quercetin, naringin, and naringenin were determined using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC-DAD). Finally, volatile compounds were determined using headspace solid-phase micro-extraction in combination with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (HS-SPME/GC-MS). Statistical treatment of data by multivariate techniques showed that orange juice variety had a significant (p < 0.05) impact on the above analytical parameters. The classification rate for the differentiation of orange juice according to orange variety using multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) was 89.3%, based on the cross-validation method.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND & AIMS: Dyslipidaemia is usually common in obesity, insulin resistance, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Clinical trials suggest that orange juice may have a positive impact on lipid metabolism and blood lipid profiles; however conflicting results have been reported. Here, we applied a combined untargeted/targeted lipidomic analysis of plasma to examine the impact of orange (Citrus sinensis) juice intake on the lipidome profile of obese and insulin-resistant subjects. METHODS: Twenty-five participants, both sexes, aged 40-60 years, with obesity and insulin resistance (homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) index >2.71) ingested 400 mL of orange juice 'Pera' (C. sinensis) for 15 d. Cardiometabolic biomarkers, anthropometric parameters, blood pressure, and plasma lipidomic analysis results were assessed at the beginning and end of the intervention. RESULTS: After the 15-d intervention, a significant decrease was observed in the diastolic blood pressure and blood lipid profile. Among plasma lipidomes, 316 lipid molecules were identified, with the triglycerides (TGs) subclass being the most abundant (n = 106). Plasma lipidome profiling revealed a major signature of the intervention; with concentrations of 37 TG species decreasing after intervention. Qualitatively, oleic and linoleic acids were among the most prevalent fatty acids linked to the altered TG species, representing 50% of TG chains. Modulated TG species were positively correlated with total TG and very low-density lipoprotein levels, as well as systolic and diastolic blood pressure. A strong inter-individual trend was observed, wherein, compared with less responsive subjects, the high responsive subjects displayed the highest decrease in the concentrations of altered TG species, as as well as systolic blood pressure (decrease of 10.3 ± 6.8 mmHg) and body weight (decrease of 0.67 ± 0.71 kg). CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that orange juice has a positive impact on lipid metabolism, mainly regarding the composition of TG-specific fatty acid chains and cholesterol esters, protecting against insulin resistance. Furthermore, lipidomics may help clarify alterations at the molecular level after an intervention, contributing to improve the evaluation of the link between dyslipidaemia, insulin resistance, and nutrition.",

In this sense, the thermosensitization of E. coli using the natural antimicrobials vanillin (V; 0.8 and 1.0 g/L) or/and emulsified citral (C; 0.012 and 0.025 g/L) was assessed at 58 and 60 °C in blended carrot-orange juice (pH 4.0; 9.0°Brix). All combined treatments exceeded the inactivation achieved by the single thermal treatments in half the time. The inactivation of the binary treatments (V or C + heating) at 58 °C was 3.84-0.62 log-cycles more effective than the control, particularly with vanillin. Ternary treatments (V + C + heating) at 58 °C increased the microbial reduction approximately 30%; however, at 60 °C no further inactivation was observed, suggesting the thermal effect prevailed. This was verified by the higher b Weibullian parameter and the narrower frequency distributions. The selected treatments 1.0 V + 0.012C at 58 and 60 °C were challenged against the pathogenic E. coli O157:H7 and found to be effective. Additionally, the microbiota of the juice was maintained at acceptable levels during storage (4 °C). In conclusion, there was an increase in the heat sensitivity of E. coli due to the natural antimicrobials, particularly vanillin at 58 °C. Therefore, reducing the intensity of the thermal processing will lead to clean label, high-quality juices, while addressing food safety requirements.",

In this study, the PME inhibition and mechanism by HHP (600 MPa/10 min) combined with epigallocatechin gallate (HHP-EGCG) treatment were investigated. Firstly, the HHP-EGCG treatment showed enhancement effect on PME inhibition in orange juice, and the samples maintained higher content of water soluble pectin and exhibited higher suspension stability than the HHP treated samples during 13 days of refrigerated storage. Secondly, after HHP-EGCG treatment, further synergistic effect was observed in the phosphate buffer system, and the greatest secondary structure transformation and fluorescence quenching of PME occurred. Finally, molecule docking suggested that EGCG could interact with the active sites of PME, and transmission electron microscope results revealed further aggregation of PME under HHP-EGCG treatment.",

To reach this goal, we have employed direct current atmospheric pressure glow discharge, generated in contact with a flowing liquid cathode (FLC-dc-APGD) in a highly-throughput reaction-discharge system. It was found that controlled FLC-dc-APGD-treatment of OJ lead to increase the concentration of selected metals and phenolic compounds. The so-obtained OJ had the same qualitative composition of fragrance as the untreated one, however, its shelf life was prolonged up to 26 days. Furthermore, OJ exposed to FLC-dc-APGD-treatment did not exhibit any cytotoxic properties towards non-malignant human intestinal epithelial cell lines. On the other hand, the induction of cell cytotoxicity was observed in human colorectal adenocarcinoma cells line after FLC-dc-APGD-treated OJ application. We truly believe that produced by us functionalized OJ might be a tempting alternative to classic, non-treated by FLC-dc-APGD OJ.",

In a previous study we demonstrated that a single dose and a 12-week treatment of hesperidin decreased systolic blood pressure. The aim of this study was to ascertain the action mechanisms of hesperidin consumption in subjects with elevated blood pressure or with stage 1 hypertension, by determining their transcriptomic profile after a single dose or a 12-week treatment. METHODS AND RESULTS: For transcriptomic analysis, peripheral blood mononuclear cells were obtained from 37 subjects with elevated blood pressure and stage 1 hypertension from CITRUS study who were randomized to receive for 12 weeks: control drink (CD; n = 11), OJ (containing 345 mg of hesperidin; n = 15) or EOJ (containing 600 mg of hesperidin; n = 11). Before starting the 12-weeks treatment, a single dose study with a 6 h of follow-up in each group was performed. After the single dose consumption, EOJ versus OJ, downregulated DHRS9 gene which is related with insulin resistance. Compared to CD, 12-week treatment of EOJ downregulated 6 proinflammatory genes while after OJ consumption only 1 proinflammatory gene was downregulated. Moreover, 12-week treatment of EOJ versus OJ, downregulated acute coronary syndrome gene related (SELENBP1). CONCLUSION: A single dose consumption of EOJ could protect from insulin resistance. Moreover, EOJ decrease the expression of proinflammatory genes after 12-week treatment providing a possible mechanism of action on inflammation pathway.",

However, there is heterogeneity in their biological responses, which is partly due to the large interindividual variation in these flavonoids' bioavailability. We investigated the relation between interindividual variability in the excretion of phase II conjugates and gut-derived phenolic acids, and cardiometabolic biomarkers response. Seventy-four subjects, both men and women, were included in a single-arm study. Over the 60 days, volunteers consumed 500 mL of orange juice daily. All measurements and blood collections were performed before and after the intervention period. Moreover, 24 h urine collection was performed after first consumption. Individuals were stratified according to the excretion of phase II conjugates and, for the first time, according to phenolic acids in high, medium, and low excretors. Furthermore, for the first time, the ratio between phenolic acids and flavanones-phase II conjugates has shown groups with different metabolization patterns. Groups with a low or intermediate ratio, corresponding to a higher amount of phase II conjugates excreted, showed a significant reduction in body fat % and blood pressure. This finding suggests that these improvements could be associated in a major way to flavanones-phase II conjugates, as well as to phenolic acids and stratification of volunteers according to metabolite excretions could be a good strategy to better understand the effects of orange juice on metabolism and health.",

The processing technologies applied appeared to affect serum carotenoid concentrations, with concentrations being similar in the HPP and FS orange juice types. As high variability in serum carotenoid concentrations was observed, the effect of different technologies on serum carotenoid concentration warrants further studies with larger sample sizes.",

For instance, Lactobacillus plantarum 163 can inhibit efficiently the growth of both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. In our study, the antibacterial activity of L. plantarum 163 was further improved significantly by genome shuffling. The optimal conditions for protoplast formation and regeneration were 20 mg ml-1 lysozyme and 5 mg ml-1 mutanolysin for 30 min at 37°C using 0·5 mol l-1 sucrose as stabilizer. The protoplasts were inactivated under ultraviolet light for 120 s or heated at 58°C for 20 min. After two rounds of genome shuffling, the inhibitory activity of strain F2-14 was improved by 2·45- and 1·99-fold, respectively, as compared to their parent strains. The prepared antibacterial peptides supernatant (APS) was added to the orange juice to inhibit spores of Alicyclobacillus acidoterrestris (SAA) at 45 and 28°C. Results showed that the growth of A. acidoterrestris was significantly inhibited, and the decrease in total soluble solids, OD value and pH value was also delayed. After treatment with APS, the thermal sensitivity of spores was increased and its D value was reduced to 13·78, 3·87 and 1·47 min at 80, 90 and 95°C respectively.",

This work aimed to evaluate and compare the impact of ultrasounds and heat treatments, when applied alone or in combination, on Staphylococcus aureus survival in orange juice. Inoculated commercial pasteurized orange juice was treated at different times at 20, 30, 40, 50 and 60 °C. SEM analyses were applied to identify morphological changes in S. aureus cells appearance. The microbial inactivation data were fitted using two mathematical models, depending on the behaviour observed. Sonication at 20, 30, and 40 °C induced 4.02 ± 0.52, 3.80 ± 0.49 and 4.30 ± 0.74 log cycles reduction of S. aureus after treatments of 90, 60 and 60 min, respectively. The heat treatments at the same temperatures had no impact on S. aureus survival. When 50 and 60 °C were applied, more than 5-log reductions were attained for both thermosonication and heat treatments alone. A synergistic effect was observed between sonication and high temperatures. At 50 °C, the thermosonication reduced the treatment time from 60 to 35 min and the microbial load from 5.14 ± 0.08 to 10.76 ± 0.28 log cycles reduction, compared to heat treatment alone. Results from SEM images showed that cells undergo membrane damage during sonication exposure. This was observed by collapsed cells, cell disruption, and holes in the cell's membrane. Thermosonication proved to be a viable alternative to thermal pasteurization of orange juice since milder treatments can be safely applied, improving the final product quality.",

      "abstract": "Currently, thermal pasteurisation (TP) remains the most widely applied technique for commercial orange juice preservation; however, a high temperature causes adverse effects on the quality attributes of orange juice. In order to explore a novel non-thermal sterilization method for orange juice, the impacts of thermosonication combined with nisin (TSN) and TP treatments on the quality attributes including microbial and enzyme inactivation and the physicochemical, nutritional, functional, and sensory qualities of orange juice were studied. Both TP and TSN treatments achieved desirable bactericidal and enzyme inactivation effects, and nisin had a significant synergistic lethal effect on aerobic bacteria in orange juice (p < 0.05). Additionally, TSN treatment significantly improved the color attributes of orange juice and well maintained its physicochemical properties and sensory quality. More importantly, TSN treatment significantly increased the total polyphenols content (TPC) and total carotenoids (TC) by 10.03% and 20.10%, increased the ORAC and DPPH by 51.10% and 10.58%, and the contents of total flavonoids and ascorbic acid were largely retained. Correlation analysis of antioxidant activity showed that the ORAC and scavenging ability of DPPH radicals of orange juice are mainly attributed to TC and TPC. These findings indicate that TSN shows great potential application value, which could guarantee the microbiological safety and improve the quality attributes of orange juice."

      "abstract": "Alicyclobacillus acidoterrestris is a spoilage microorganism responsible for relevant product and economic losses in the beverage and juice industry. Spores of this microorganism can survive industrial heat treatments and cause spoilage during posterior storage. Therefore, an effective design of processing treatments requires an accurate understanding of the heat resistance of this microorganism. Considering that industrial treatments are dynamic; this understanding must include how the heat resistance of the microorganism is affected by the heating rate during the heating and cooling phases. The main objective of this study was to establish the effect of heating rates and complex thermal treatments on the inactivation kinetics of A. acidoterrestris. Isothermal experiments between 90 and 105 °C were carried out in a Mastia thermoresistometer, as well as four different dynamic treatments. Although most of the inactivation takes place during the holding phase, our results indicate the relevance of the heating phase for the effectiveness of the treatment. The thermal resistance of A. acidoterrestris is affected by the heating rate during the heating phase. Specifically, higher heating rates resulted in an increased microbial inactivation with respect to the one predicted based on isothermal experiments. These results provide novel information regarding the heat response of this microorganism, which can be valuable for the design of effective heat treatments to improve product safety and stability. Moreover, it highlights the need to incorporate experimental data based on dynamic treatments in process design, as heating rates can have a very significant effect on the thermal resistance of microorganisms."

In this context, our objective was to evaluate the efficacy of Ultraviolet-C (UV-C) light at 254 nm on reducing bacterial spores of Alicyclobacillus acidoterrestris, Bacillus coagulans and Bacillus cereus at two stages of orange juice production. To simulate fruit disinfection before processing, the orange peel was artificially inoculated with each of the bacterial spores and submitted to UV-C light (97.8-100.1 W/m2) with treatment times between 3 s and 10 min. The obtained product, the orange juice, was also tested by exposing the artificially inoculated juice to UV-C light (100.9-107.9 W/m2) between 5 and 60 min. A three-minute treatment (18.0 kJ/m2) reduced spore numbers on orange peel around 2 log units, while more than 45 min (278.8 kJ/m2) were needed to achieve the same reduction in orange juice for all evaluated bacterial spores. As raw fruits are the main source of bacterial spores in fruit juices, reducing bacterial spores on fruit peels could help fruit juice processors to enhance the microbiological quality and safety of fruit juices."

Ultrasound improved the enzymatic action and the retention of more active flavors in juice than treatment with enzyme alone. However, simultaneous ultrasound and enzyme treatment decreased aroma quality. Therefore, the choice of the mode of ultrasound treatment is highly important.

      "abstract": "Overconsumption of sugar-sweetened beverages increases risk factors associated with cardiometabolic disease, in part due to hepatic fructose overload. However, it is not clear whether consumption of beverages containing fructose as naturally occurring sugar produces equivalent metabolic dysregulation as beverages containing added sugars. We compared the effects of consuming naturally-sweetened orange juice (OJ) or sucrose-sweetened beverages (sucrose-SB) for two weeks on risk factors for cardiometabolic disease. Healthy, overweight women (n = 20) were assigned to consume either 3 servings of 100% orange juice or sucrose-SB/day. We conducted 16-hour serial blood collections and 3-h oral glucose tolerance tests during a 30-h inpatient visit at baseline and after the 2-week diet intervention. The 16-h area under the curve (AUC) for uric acid increased in subjects consuming sucrose-SB compared with subjects consuming OJ. Unlike sucrose-SB, OJ did not significantly increase fasting or postprandial lipoproteins. Consumption of both beverages resulted in reductions in the Matsuda insulin sensitivity index (OJ: -0.40 ± 0.18, p = 0.04 within group; sucrose-SB: -1.0 ± 0.38, p = 0.006 within group; p = 0.53 between groups). Findings from this pilot study suggest that consumption of OJ at levels above the current dietary guidelines for sugar intake does not increase plasma uric acid concentrations compared with sucrose-SB, but appears to lead to comparable decreases of insulin sensitivity.",

The microdilution technique was performed in order to determine the antibacterial activity of the crude extract alone as well as in combination with the bacteriocin, nisin. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the crude extract and nisin alone against A. acidoterrestris vegetative forms were 250 μg/mL and 31.5 μg/mL, respectively, while the minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBC) were 1000 μg/mL and 62.5 μg/mL,respectively. For A. acidoterrestris spores, treatment with the crude extract at a concentration of 500 μg/mL caused a 47% reduction in growth, while nisin at 62.5 μg/mL could reduce 100% of the growth. The in vitro evaluation of the crude extract combined with nisin against A. acidoterrestris by the Checkerboard method showed a synergistic interaction between the two compounds. In addition, greater selectivity towards bacterial cells over host cells, a human hepatocyte cell line, was achieved when the crude extract was combined with nisin, Using scanning electron microscopy, interferences in the cell membrane of A. acidoterrestris could be observed after treatment with the crude extract. The results presented in this study indicate that the crude extract of the endophyte F. flavus has biotechnological potential in the food industry, especially for the treatment of orange juices through the control of A. acidoterrestris.",

METHODS AND RESULTS: The 32 study participants abstained from citrus fruits, juices and products thereof, except for one portion of orange juice, for eight days. Throughout the study, spot urine samples are collected and quantitatively analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) regarding their content of several potential biomarkers for orange juice intake after enzymatic treatment with β-glucuronidase. Proline betaine is determined as a long-term biomarker: based on its urinary excretion, orange juice consumption is traceable for at least 72 h after intake. Naringenin and hesperetin are identified as qualitative short-term biomarkers. Synephrine sulfate also showed a fast increase and decrease in a semi-quantitative approach. In the case of phloretin, no correlation between orange juice consumption and the urinary concentration is observed. CONCLUSION: Proline betaine is the most promising biomarker for orange juice consumption and allows to differentiate between low, medium, and high intake. Hesperetin and naringenin (as well as synephrine) are applicable as supporting biomarkers, whereas phloretin does not represent a reliable biomarker for orange juice consumption.",

Although fermentation may offer new prospects for the industry of orange-related products, there is a lack of studies reporting the influence of controlled alcoholic fermentation on the bioavailability of orange juice (poly)phenols in humans. The aim of this study was to evaluate the absorption profile, pharmacokinetic parameters, and urinary excretion of orange juice (poly)phenols in nine volunteers after acute administration of an orange juice and a beverage prepared after controlled alcoholic fermentation of the juice. Plasma and urine samples were analysed through a UHPLC-ESI-MS/MS targeted approach. A total of 24 (poly)phenol metabolites including both flavanone and phenolic acid derivatives were quantified, most of them being recorded only in urine. Phase II conjugates of hesperetin and naringenin were the main metabolites in plasma, while phenolic acids, in particular hydroxybenzoic acids, were the main compounds in urine. (Poly)phenols in both beverages were highly bioavailable (between 46 and 59%) and a notable inter-individual variability was seen. Significant treatment × time interactions were recorded for the sum of flavanones and phenolic acids in plasma, the (poly)phenols in the fermented juice being absorbed faster than after orange juice intake. Nevertheless, despite the food matrix having an impact on the absorption profile of orange juice (poly)phenols, this did not influence the pharmacokinetic parameters and urinary excretion of the (poly)phenol metabolites.",

      "abstract": "Alicyclobacillus acidoterrestris is a thermoacidophilic, spore-forming bacillus. A. acidoterrestris and its spores can survive in pasteurized juices and cause microbial spoilage. In this work, the effects of ultraviolet-C light-emitting diodes at 275 nm on the inactivation of A. acidoterrestris vegetative cells and its spores in commercial pasteurized orange juice were studied. Meanwhile, the effects of ultraviolet-C light-emitting diodes on the quality attributes of the orange juice were also investigated. The quantities of A. acidoterrestris vegetative cells and its spores inoculated in orange juice were reduced by 6.04 and 2.49 log10 CFU/mL after ultraviolet-C light-emitting diode treatment at 220 mJ/cm2, respectively. The Weibull and Weibull plus tail models were satisfactorily fitted to estimate the reductions of A. acidoterrestris vegetative cells and its spores in orange juice, respectively. Physicochemical properties (pH, titratable acidity, total soluble solids, and clarity) of orange juice did not change significantly after exposure to ultraviolet-C light-emitting diodes. However, the total phenolic content of orange juice decreased with increasing fluence. In addition, ultraviolet-C light-emitting diode treatment at a higher fluence led to a noticeable color difference. These results indicate that ultraviolet-C light-emitting diode treatment has a potential application in the juice processing industry.",

      "abstract": "We have determined whether orange juice-derived nanovesicles (ONVs) could be used for the treatment of obesity-associated intestinal complications. ONVs were characterized by lipidomic, metabolomic, electron microscopy. In vitro, intestinal barriers (IBs = Caco-2+HT-29-MTX) were treated with ONVs and co-cultured with adipocytes to monitor IB fat release. In vivo, obesity was induced with a high-fat, high-sucrose diet (HFHSD mice) for 12 weeks. Then, half of HFHSD mice were gavaged with ONVs. One-month ONV treatment did not modify HFHSD-induced insulin resistance but reversed diet-induced gut modifications. In the jejunum, ONVs increased villi size, reduced triglyceride content, and modulated mRNA levels of genes involved in immune response (tumor necrosis factor [TNF]-α and interleukin [IL]-1β), barrier permeability (CLDN1, OCLN, ZO1), fat absorption, and chylomicron release. ONVs targeted microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP) and angiopoietin-like protein-4 (ANGPTL4), two therapeutic targets to reduce plasma lipids and inflammation in gastrointestinal diseases. Interestingly, ONV treatment did not aggravate liver steatosis, as MTP mRNA was increased in the liver. Therefore, ONVs protected both intestine and the liver from fat overload associated with the HFHSD. As ONVs concentrated amino acids and bioactive lipids versus orange juice, which are deficient in obese patients, the use of ONVs as a dietary supplement could bring physiological relevant compounds in the jejunum to accelerate the restoration of intestinal functions during weight loss in obese patients."

This study evaluated the inactivation and membrane damage of spoilage yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae by UVC-LEDs and their application in orange juice pasteurization. The results demonstrated that the antimicrobial effect of UVC-LED treatment against S. cerevisiae was enhanced by increased radiation dose. When the dose of UVC-LED radiation was 1,420 mJ/cm2, the population of S. cerevisiae in yeast extract peptone dextrose broth was reduced by 4.86 log CFU/mL. Through scanning electron microscopy and fluorescent staining, the structure and function of plasma membrane was observed to be severely damaged by UVC-LED treatment. The inactivation efficacy of UVC-LEDs against S. cerevisiae in orange juice also increased with increasing radiation dose. Radiation at 1,420 mJ/cm2 greatly reduced S. cerevisiae in orange juice by 4.44 log CFU/mL and did not induce remarkable changes in pH, total soluble solids, titratable acidity, and color parameters. However, the total phenolic content in orange juice was found to be significantly decreased by UVC-LEDs. These findings contribute to a better comprehension of UVC-LED inactivation and provide theoretical support for its potential application in fruit and vegetable juice processing.",

The use of RO and RO+N at concentrations of 1, 4 and 8× MIC in orange juice for 96 h was evaluated in terms of their sporicidal effectiveness. With regard to the action against A. acidoterrestris spores, RO at 8× MIC was sporostatic, whereas RO+N at 1× MIC was sporicidal. Morphological changes in the structure of the micro-organism after treatment were also observed by microscopy. Furthermore, flow cytometric analysis showed that most cells were damaged or killed after treatment. In general, the antioxidant activity after addition of RO+N decreased with time. The results demonstrate that using the combination of RO and nisin can prevent the A. acidoterrestris growth in orange juice.",

Damage in DNA, membrane integrity, membrane potential, metabolic and efflux activity of bacterial cells were measured after exposure (6 and 12 min) to CLEO or CREO (0.5 μL/mL) and/or MHT (54 °C) using flow cytometry. Limonene was the major constituent in CLEO (66.4%) and CREO (89.4%). The size of the damaged cell subpopulations increased (p < 0.05) after longer exposure time and varied with the tested essential oil and/or bacterial isolate. After exposure to CLEO and CREO alone, the cell subpopulations with damage in measured physiological functions were in a range of 19.6-66.8% and 23.8-75.9%, respectively. Exposure to CREO resulted in larger Lc. mesenteroides cell subpopulations (35.4-68.7%) with damaged DNA, permeabilized and depolarized membrane and compromised metabolic or efflux activity compared to L. brevis (23.8-58.0%). In contrast, exposure to CLEO led to higher damaged L. brevis cell subpopulations (35.1-77%) compared to Lc. mesenteroides (25.3-36.6%). Exposure to combined treatments (CLEO or CREO and MHT) affected the measured physiological functions in almost the entire L. brevis and Lc. mesenteroides cell population (up to 99%), although the damage extension on each isolate varied with tested essential oil. Results show that inactivation of L. brevis and Lc. mesenteroides cells caused by CLEO and CREO alone and combined with MHT in orange juice involves a multi-target action, which causes DNA damage, altered permeability and depolarization of membrane and compromised metabolic and efflux activities.",

The objective of this study was to chemically characterize Moro orange juice. The influence of juice intake on metabolic parameters of rats that were obese, diabetic or both by means of body mass management after the activation of anthocyanins during refrigerated storage was also assessed. RESULTS: Juice intake reversed most of the metabolic abnormalities exhibited by obese rats, including reduction of body mass and improvement of the biochemical profile. The loss of body mass by diabetic animals and obese and diabetic animals was not attributed to juice intake, but to type I diabetes mellitus. In these animals, no improvement was observed in the biochemical profile, liver enzymes and glycemia, so this treatment model was deemed unfeasible. CONCLUSION: The beneficial effects cannot be explained only by the anthocyanin C3G present in the juice, but rather, by the synergism between all the components. Studies in humans are needed to determine whether the ingestion of this orange can be recommended as an effective strategy to prevent or ameliorate complications of obesity. © 2020 Society of Chemical Industry.",

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: To assess the sustained and acute effects, as well as the influence of sustained consumption on the acute effects, of orange juice (OJ) with a natural hesperidin content and hesperidin-enriched OJ (EOJ) on blood (BP) and pulse (PP) pressures in pre- and stage-1 hypertensive individuals. METHODS: In a randomized, parallel, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, participants (n = 159) received 500 mL/day of control drink, OJ, or EOJ for 12 weeks. Two dose-response studies were performed at baseline and after 12 weeks. RESULTS: A single EOJ dose (500 mL) reduced systolic BP (SBP) and PP, with greater changes after sustained treatment where a decrease in diastolic BP (DBP) also occurred (P < 0.05). SBP and PP decreased in a dose-dependent manner relative to the hesperidin content of the beverages throughout the 12 weeks (P < 0.05). OJ and EOJ decreased homocysteine levels at 12 weeks versus the control drink (P < 0.05). After 12 weeks of EOJ consumption, four genes related to hypertension (PTX3, NLRP3, NPSR1 and NAMPT) were differentially expressed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Hesperidin in OJ reduces SBP and PP after sustained consumption, and after a single dose, the chronic consumption of EOJ enhances its postprandial effect. Decreases in systemic and transcriptomic biomarkers were concomitant with BP and PP changes. EOJ could be a useful co-adjuvant tool for BP and PP management in pre- and stage-1 hypertensive individuals.",

Current reference methods of SPC in orange juice are laborious, requiring several extractions with successive adjustments hindering rapid process intervention. 109 fresh orange juices samples, representing different harvests, were analysed using MIR, TD-NMR and reference method. Unsupervised algorithms were applied for natural clustering of MIR and TD-NMR data in two groups. Analyses of variance of the two MIR and TD-NMR datasets show that only the MIR groups were different at 95% confidence for SPC average values. This approach allows build classification models based on MIR data achieving 85% and 89% of accuracy. Results demonstrate that MIR/ML can be a suitable strategy for the quick assessment of SPC trends in orange juices.",

The gut microbiome plays a major role in the two-way communication system between the intestines and brain. The current study examined the effects of flavonoids on depression by observing the changes in the gut microbiome and depressive symptoms of young participants consuming flavonoid-rich orange juice. The depressive symptom was assessed using the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D), a psychiatric screening tool used to detect preexisting mental disorders. The study population was randomly divided into two groups: the flavonoid-rich orange juice (FR) and an equicaloric flavonoid-low orange cordial (FL) group. For 8 weeks, participants consumed FR (serving a daily 380 mL, 600 ± 5.4 mg flavonoids) or FL (serving a daily 380 mL, 108 ± 2.6 mg flavonoids). In total, 80 fecal samples from 40 participants (mean age, 21.83 years) were sequenced. Regarding depression, we observed positive correlations between brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and the Lachnospiraceae family (Lachnospiraceae_uc and Murimonas) before flavonoid orange juice treatment. Most notably, the abundance of the Lachnospiraceae family (Lachnospiraceae_uc, Eubacterium_g4, Roseburia_uc, Coprococcus_g2_uc, Agathobacter_uc) increased after FR treatment compared to that after FL treatment. We also validated the presence of unclassified Lachnospiraceae through sensitive real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction using stool samples from participants before and after flavonoid treatment. Our results provide novel interventional evidence that alteration in the microbiome due to flavonoid treatment is related to a potential improvement in depression in young adults.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Epidemiological studies have indicated an inverse association between citrus fruit consumption and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk. There is, however, a paucity of data concerning effects of blood orange juice (BOJ) intake on endothelial function and cardiovascular risk biomarkers. OBJECTIVES: We examined short-term effects of BOJ on endothelial function, blood pressure, lipid profile, and inflammatory markers in healthy participants of European origin who were overweight or obese. METHODS: In a randomized, controlled, single-blind, crossover trial, 15 men and women (age: 28.7 ± 6.5 y; BMI: 28.3 ± 3.1 kg/m2) consumed BOJ or a sugar-matched control drink (CD) (200 mL twice daily) for 2 wk with a washout period of 1 wk. Endothelial function, measured as flow-mediated dilation (FMD) (primary outcome), and the secondary outcomes blood pressure, anthropometric measures, lipid profile, inflammatory markers, markers of vasodilation and vasoconstriction, and urinary flavanone metabolites were evaluated prior to and at the end of each treatment period following an overnight fast. Changes between treatments over time were assessed using repeated-measures ANOVA. RESULTS: The results demonstrate a significant increase in FMD following BOJ consumption (pre: 8.15% ± 2.92%; post: 10.2% ± 3.31%; P = 0.002) compared with CD (pre: 8.11% ± 2.52%; post: 7.77% ± 2.43%; time × treatment interaction: P = 0.001). Concurrent significant increases in urinary hesperetin-3'-glucuronide and hesperetin-7-glucuronide were observed following BOJ supplementation only (time × treatment interaction: P ≤ 0.01). Baseline blood pressure, lipid profile, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, and endothelin-1 were generally within healthy ranges and unaffected by the intervention. CONCLUSIONS: A 2-wk consumption of BOJ exerted favorable effects on endothelial function in healthy women and men who were overweight or obese, which is likely mediated by the combined actions of anthocyanin and flavanone metabolites on mechanisms that contribute to enhancing NO bioavailability. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT03611114.",

      "abstract": "Purpose: The pursuit of a dietary source to increase urine pH and citrate in stone formers has been ongoing for >30 years. Early evidence showed that orange juice (OJ) contains alkali and citrate, but high sugar and ascorbic acid content limited the use of OJ as a viable daily source of alkali. Recently, novel low-calorie OJs have emerged and could potentially be a better option. Methods: Beverages with high concentrations of alkali citrate and malate were identified using ion chromatography. Two low-calorie OJ beverages, in addition to crystal light lemonade beverage (CLLB), were chosen. Healthy volunteers (5 men, 5 women) drank 1 L of OJ or CLLB with 1 L water daily for 7 days, and then completed a 24-hour urinalysis. A washout week was instituted between trial weeks. The study design is a prospective randomized crossover control trial. A paired analysis using comparison of means was used to evaluate low-calorie OJ and CLLB. Volunteers had no prior history of kidney stones and maintained a journal with beverage compliance, side effect (SE), and dietary consumption data. Results: Tropicana 50 (TRP50), Kroger low-calorie OJ (KLCO), and CLLB were found to have a total alkali content of 56.60, 47.9, and 17.3 mEq/L, respectively, based on ion chromatography. Consumption of all three beverages raised urinary citrate (116.6 [-118 to 373, 177.9 [-3 to 359], 155.6 [-4 to 237] ▵mg/day 95% confidence interval) and urinary pH (0.25 [0.08-0.53], 0.74 [0.41-1.07 p < 0.05], 0.25 [0.25-0.64]), respectively, compared with water phase. Based on journal entries by volunteers, TRP50 had the most SEs (90% participants) felt to be a result of the artificial sweetener (Stevia®). Conclusion: Low-calorie OJs, and to a lesser extent CLLB, have alkali and citrate based on ion chromatography. Daily consumption by healthy volunteers of KLCO can raise urinary pH.",

Citrus flavonoids are known to possess important pharmacological properties, including anti-inflammatory activity. In this study we evaluated the effects of a flavonoid-rich extract of orange juice (OJe) in an experimental model of enteritis induced by Vibrio anguillarum in adult zebrafish (Danio rerio). Administration of V. anguillarum through live feed (Artemia nauplii) for three consecutive days caused evident signs of enteritis in zebrafish. Three days of treatment with OJe before the pathogenic insult resulted in a remarkable reduction of tissue inflammatory events as well as a molecular down-regulation of the inflammatory genes such as IL-1β, IL-6 and TNFα. Our data suggest that OJe counteracts the inflammation of zebrafish intestinal mucosa, indicating that the pool of flavonoids present in orange juice could be useful for the prevention of enteritis.",

We aimed to reduce Cit s 2 levels by preparing mixed orange fresh juice with pineapple, as a convenient method for any kitchen. Cit s 2 levels in orange extracts digested with pineapple extract and its protease bromelain were evaluated with quantitative enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Cit s 2 levels decreased according to reaction temperature and time, which was inhibited by iodoacetic acid. Treatment with pineapple extract diluted 40-fold and 0.1 mg/mL of bromelain at 37℃ for 30 min contributed to reducing residual Cit s 2 levels below the cut-off of 15%, respectively. Since this condition can increase the proportion of orange juice and reduce the risk of ingesting the pineapple allergen bromelain, it is considered to be more practical. Broad utilization of proteases in hypoallergenic food products is expected following clinical studies for verification.",

      "abstract": "The objective of this study was to evaluate the microbiological, physicochemical and functional quality of an innovative goat whey orange juice beverage (GOB) processed by microfiltration. The microfiltration (0.2 µm) of the GOBs had a variation on the feed temperature (20, 30, 40, 50 °C) and were compared to the conventional heat treatment LTLT (63 °C/30 min). Microbiological (aerobic mesophilic bacteria, mold and yeast and lactic bacteria), physicochemical (pH, color, rheology and volatile compounds) bioactive compounds (acid ascorbic, total phenolics) and functional activity (DPPH, ACE, α-amilase and α-glucosidase) analysis were performed. The GOB processed by microfiltration using at least 30 °C presented adequate microbial counts (less than 4, 3 and 4 log CFU/mL, for AMB, molds and yeasts and LAB, respectively). In general, the pH, color parameters, volatile and bioactive compounds were not influenced by microfiltration temperature, but presented a difference from the LTLT processing. The rheological parameters were influenced by MF temperature and the utilization of temperatures of 20° and 30 °C maintained the consistency similar to the LTLT sample, preserving the compounds responsible for the texture. Therefore, it is suggested a processing of GOB by microfiltration using mild temperatures (between 30° and 40 °C) to preserve consistency and also obtain a desirable microbial quality, beyond the preservation of many functional properties and volatile compounds.",

      "abstract": "This study aimed to develop a pasteurization method against Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium in orange juice using low concentrations of naturally derived antimicrobials, β-resorcylic acid and capric acid, under mild temperature conditions based on their synergistic bactericidal interactions. Response surface methodology was used to construct a model based on four variables, namely β-resorcylic acid (1, 3, 5, 7, and 9 mM), capric acid (0.05, 0.10, 0.15, 0.20, and 0.25 mM), treatment temperature (35, 40, 45, 50, and 55 °C), and time (1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 min), and the resulting model was used to predict the reduction in the content of fastidious bacteria (S. Typhimurium) in orange juice and to identify the optimal treatment combination for juice pasteurization. A second-order quadratic model for Salmonella reduction showed a high regression coefficient (R2 = 0.9503), and the accuracy of the predictive model was also verified (R2 = 0.9317). The optimal conditions determined by ridge analysis were 8.43 mM β-resorcylic acid combined with 0.10 mM capric acid at 43.46 °C for 3.03 min, and these yielded an estimated 7.41-log reduction. Treatment times <30 s under the optimal conditions also resulted in a >5.7-log reduction. The combined treatment did not affect either the pH or sugar concentration in brix, and average pH and sugar concentration values of 3.86 and 11.05% were observed, respectively. The distinct advantage of the developed method is its ability to effectively reduce the content of S. Typhimurium over a short time under low temperature conditions through the addition of consumer-preferred naturally derived antimicrobials. The predictive model could be used to determine the most cost-efficient amounts of antimicrobial agents and conditions (treatment temperature and time) for sterilizing orange juice.",

Biochemical and dietary parameters were monitored, and blood, urine and stool samples were collected every 30 days until the end of the study. Hesperidin and naringin metabolites in the urine were identified by UHPLC, and the microbiota composition of the feces was determined by 16S rRNA. At the end of the OJ-Diet, there was a reduction in glucose (-6.5%), insulin (-33%), insulin resistance (-44%), LDL-C (-16%) and triglycerides (-30%). After the washout, these parameters returned to their initial values. There were no changes in the body weight or fat during the experimental time. The intestinal bacteria, Lactobacillus spp., Akkermansia spp., and Ruminococcus spp., increased after the intervention with orange juice. In addition, an inverse correlation was detected between these bacteria and glycemia, insulin, HOMA-IR, triglycerides, total cholesterol and LDL-C, but a direct correlation with HDL-C. In conclusion, orange juice showed a prebiotic effect, modulating the intestinal microbiota while improving the glycemia and lipid profiles.",

The ultrasound energy performance for each nominal power applied to the XOS-enriched orange juice was determined by calculating acoustic powers (W), HIUS intensity (W/cm2), and energy density (kJ/mL). Physicochemical properties (pH and soluble solid content), organic acid content (ascorbic, malic, and citric acids), total phenolic content (TPC), antioxidant activity by the FRAP (Ferric reducing ability of plasma) method, sugar (glucose, fructose, and sucrose), and XOS (xylobiose, xylotriose, xylotetraose, xylopentaose, and xylohexaose) content were determined. The pH and soluble solid content did not change after all HIUS treatments. The HIUS process severity was monitored by quantifying ascorbic acid content after the treatments. A significant linear decrease in the ascorbic acid content was observed in prebiotic orange juice with the HIUS process intensification by increasing nominal power. The malic acid and citric acid contents had similar behavior according to the HIUS process intensification. The nominal power increase from 300 to 600 W increased the concentration of both organic acids, however, the intensification up to 1200 W reduced their concentration in the functional beverage. The TPC and FRAP data corroborated with the results observed for the ascorbic acid content. However, the HIUS processing did not alter sugar and XOS contents. The XOS chromatographic profiles were not modified by the HIUS treatment and presented the same amount of all prebiotic compounds before and after the HIUS treatment. Overall, HIUS technology has been evaluated as a promising stabilization technique for prebiotic beverages enriched with XOS due to their high chemical stability to this emerging technology under severe process conditions.",

RESEARCH METHODS: This is a prospective, three-way, crossover study design. Blood records of thirteen normal weight and seven healthy obese university students were analyzed from Zayed University on three random days with the following three meal samples: 2 ROs, 100% FOJ, and NSOJ. Venous blood was collected at 0, 30, 60, 90, and 120 minutes after the respective meal consumption. Statistical analyses included repeated measures analysis of variance and calculations of the area under the glucose and insulin curves (AUC) for each one of the meal samples. RESULTS: Total fasting glucose and insulin levels did not differ by treatment in the normal versus obese group. All three meals had no significant effects on the plasma glucose levels. However, there was a significant change in plasma insulin concentrations at 120 min compared with that at 0 min for RO: -14 (-27.05, -0.90, P < 0.001); 100% FOJ -13.7 (-28.80, 1.44, P < 0.001); and NSOJ: -9.2 (-28.75, 10.30, P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that whole fresh fruit, 100% fruit juice, and sweetened fruit juice did not have a significant effect on the blood glucose levels in non-diabetic Emirati university students. However, a significant decrease in insulin response and HOMA-IR on all three sample meals was observed.",

The influence of Sonication (S), Thermosonication (TS), Ohmic heating (OH) and OS on inactivation of PME were compared to conventional heat (CH) treatment. Their effects on physical, chemical and microbiological contents were included. In comparison to fresh orange juice, the inactivation of PME was 96%, 95%, 89%, 90% and 29% for OS, OH, TS, CH and S treatments, respectively. Highest cloud value was obtained for OS (1.240 A) treatment. OS treatment gave a lower vitamin C loss compared to TS, OH and CH treatments. A significant increase in the total phenolic content were obtained in the following order OS > TS > OH > CH. OS treated juice also contained the lowest value of hydroxymethyl furfural (0.90 mg/L) compared to OH (0.95 mg/L), TS (1.37 mg/L) and CH (2.72 mg/L) treated samples. Overall, the results indicated that OS can be integrated as a substitute to pasteurization of NFCOJ."

Further, the combinational effect of ultrasound (US), photosensitizer (PS) and blue light (BL) on inactivation of microbes was evaluated. The effect of process parameters such as concentration of PS, US and volume of the juice on E. coli and S. aureus inactivation was also investigated. The US alone and PS + BL treatments resulted in 3.02 ± 0.52 and 1.06 ± 0.13 log reduction of E. coli; 0.18 ± 0.14 and 2.34 ± 0.13 log reduction of S. aureus, respectively. The combination of PS + US + BL treatment at optimized conditions resulted in 2.35 ± 0.16 log reduction of S. aureus. An additive effect on the inactivation of E. coli (4.26 ± 0.32 log reduction) was observed with PS + US + BL combination treatment. The US treatment showed significant change in cloud value, colour and browning index of orange juice. The combinational non-thermal processes (PS + BL and PS + US + BL) did not have any significant effect on total phenolic content, total flavonoid content, and hesperidin content of the orange juice. However, these processes affected ascorbic acid content and antioxidant activity negatively. Thus, this study indicated that photodynamic inactivation of E. coli and S. aureus using LED-based photosensitization in fruit juices could be a potential method for microbial inactivation. Nevertheless, the effect on quality parameters needs to be considered while optimizing the process.",

The exceptionally high carotenoid content of 'Cara Cara' is of special interest due to its neuroprotective potential. Here, we used the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans to analyze the antioxidant effect and the protection against β-amyloid-induced toxicity of pasteurized orange juice (POJ) obtained from 'Cara Cara' and compare to that from 'Bahia'. POJ treatment reduced the endogenous ROS levels and increased the worm's survival rate under normal and oxidative stress conditions. POJ treatment also upregulated the expression of antioxidant (gcs-1, gst-4, and sod-3) and chaperonin (hsp-16.2) genes. Remarkably, ROS reduction, gene expression activation, oxidative stress resistance, and longevity extension were significantly increased in the animals treated with 'Cara Cara' orange juice compared to animals treated with 'Bahia' orange juice. Furthermore, the body paralysis induced by β-amyloid peptide was delayed by both POJs but the mean paralysis time for the worms treated with 'Cara Cara' orange juice was significantly higher compared to 'Bahia' orange juice. Our mechanistic studies indicated that POJ-reduced ROS levels are primarily a result of the direct scavenging action of natural compounds available in the orange juice. Moreover, POJ-induced gst-4::GFP expression and -increased stress resistance was dependent of the SKN-1/Nrf2 transcription factor. Finally, the transcription factors SKN-1, DAF-16, and HSF-1 were required for the POJ-mediated protective effect against Aβ toxicity. Collectively, these results suggest that orange juice from 'Cara Cara' induced a stronger response against oxidative stress and β-amyloid toxicity compared to orange juice from 'Bahia' possibly due to its higher carotenoid content.",

Operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were pyrosequenced targeting 16S rRNA, and faecal metabolites were analyzed by an untargeted metabolomics approach based on 1H NMR spectroscopy. The major shift observed in microbiota composition after orange juice intake was the increased abundance of a network of Clostridia OTUs from Mogibacteriaceae, Tissierellaceae, Veillonellaceae, Odoribacteraceae, and Ruminococcaceae families, whose members were differently affected by Cara Cara or Bahia juice consumption. A core of six metabolites such as inositol, choline, lysine, arginine, urocanic acid, and formate significantly increased in Cara Cara compared to the Bahia group.",

      "abstract": "Salmonella enterica is the pertinent pathogen associated with orange juice products that have resulted in numerous foodborne outbreaks. Although fresh orange juice typically has a pH below 4.0, which inhibits most pathogen growth, S. enterica can survive at low pH for extended periods. Additionally, fresh juice contains spoilage microorganisms such as natural yeasts and molds, which can grow at low pH, and may cause fermentation and product spoilage if left untreated. Numerous Salmonella outbreaks linked to fresh orange juice, as well as the burden of product spoilage, have generated increased demand for alternative, non-thermal treatments that can ensure pathogen- and spoilage-free products. In this study, the effect of dimethyl dicarbonate (DMDC) on pathogen and spoilage microorganism inactivation in orange juice has been investigated with two experiments. First, pasteurized orange juice was inoculated with approximately 106-107 CFU/ml of five serotypes of S. enterica per ml and treated with DMDC to test the effectiveness of inactivation against Salmonella. For the fungal spoilage microorganism study, fresh orange juice was held at room temperature to increase natural yeast and mold count to roughly 105-106 CFU/ml, followed with treatment with DMDC. DMDC at two concentrations (172 and 200 ppm) was used, and the tests were carried out at ambient (21 °C ± 3 °C) and refrigeration (4 °C) temperatures. There was a >5-log reduction of Salmonella at 4 °C after 24 h at both 172 and 200 ppm of DMDC. For the treatment of fungal spoilage microorganisms, a nearly 5 and 4 log reduction of yeasts and molds was observed at ambient temperature and 4 °C, respectively. These results suggest that DMDC is most effective for use under the 4 °C holding conditions to inactivate S. enterica, and should be coupled with an additional preservative system for fungal spoilage control to produce safe orange juice that retains fresh quality.",

We aimed to investigate if intake of orange juice with or in-between meals differently affects energy balance or metabolic risk. Twenty-six healthy adults (24.7 ± 3.2 y; BMI 23.2 ± 3.2 kg/m2) participated in a 4-week cross-over intervention and consumed orange juice (20% of energy requirement) either together with 3 meals/d (WM) or in-between 3 meals/d (BM) at ad libitum energy intake. Basal and postprandial insulin sensitivity (primary outcome), daylong glycaemia, glucose variability and insulin secretion were assessed. Body fat mass was measured by air-displacement plethysmography. After BM-intervention, fat mass increased (+1.0 ± 1.8 kg; p < 0.05) and postprandial insulin sensitivity tended to decrease (ΔMatsudaISI: -0.89 ± 2.3; p = 0.06). By contrast, after WM-intervention fat mass and gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) decreased (-0.30 ± 0.65 kg; -2.50 ± 3.94; both p < 0.05), whereas glucose variability was higher (ΔMAGE: +0.45 ± 0.59, p < 0.05). Daylong glycaemia, insulin secretion, changes in basal insulin sensitivity, and triglycerides did not differ between WM- and BM-interventions (all p > 0.05). In young healthy adults, a conventional 3-meal structure with orange juice consumed together with meals had a favorable impact on energy balance, whereas juice consumption in-between meals may contribute to a gain in body fat and adverse metabolic effects.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Higher consumption of sugar-containing beverages has been associated with an elevated risk of type 2 diabetes and gout. Whether this equally applies to cola with an unhealthy image and orange juice (OJ) having a healthy image remains unknown. METHODS: In order to investigate whether OJ and cola differently affect metabolic risk 26 healthy adults (24.7 ± 3.2 y; BMI 23.2 ± 3.3 kg/m2) participated in a 2 × 2-wk intervention and consumed either OJ or caffeine-free cola (20% Ereq as sugar from beverages) in-between 3 meals/d at ad libitum energy intake. Glycemic control, uric acid metabolism and gut microbiota were assessed as outcome parameters. RESULTS: Fecal microbiota, body weight, basal and OGTT-derived insulin sensitivity remained unchanged in both intervention periods. Levels of uric acid were normal at baseline and did not change with 2-wk cola consumption (-0.03 ± 0.67 mg/dL; p > 0.05), whereas they decreased with OJ intervention (-0.43 ± 0.56 mg/dL; p < 0.01) due to increased uric acid excretion (+130.2 ± 130.0 mg/d; p < 0.001). Compared to OJ, consumption of cola led to a higher daylong glycemia (ΔiAUC: 36.9 ± 83.2; p < 0.05), an increase in glucose variability (ΔMAGE-Index: 0.29 ± 0.44; p < 0.05), and a lower 24 h-insulin secretion (ΔC-peptide excretion: -31.76 ± 38.61 μg/d; p < 0.001), which may be explained by a decrease in serum potassium levels (-0.11 ± 0.24 mmol/L; p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Despite its sugar content, regular consumption of large amounts of OJ do not increase the risk of gout but may even contribute to lower uric acid levels. The etiology of impaired insulin secretion with cola consumption needs to be further investigated.",

Yeast induced damage by single UV-C and mild heat (H) and the combined treatment UV-C/H, was investigated by flow cytometry (FC) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). When studying induced damage by FC, cells were labeled with fluorescein diacetate (FDA) and propidium iodide (PI) to monitor membrane integrity and esterase activity. UV-C/H provoked up to 4.7 log-reductions of S. cerevisiae; whereas, only 2.6-3.3 log-reductions were achieved by single UV-C and H treatments. FC revealed a shift with treatment time from cells with esterase activity and intact membrane to cells with permeabilized membrane. This shift was more noticeable in peptone water and UV-C/H treated juice. In the UV-C treated juice, double stained cells were detected, suggesting the possibility of being sub-lethally damaged, with compromised membrane but still metabolically active. TEM images of treated cells revealed severe damage, encompassing coagulated inner content, disorganized lumen and cell debris. FC and TEM provided additional information regarding degree and type of damage, complementing information revealed by the traditional plate count technique.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Cystinosis is a rare, metabolic, autosomal recessive, genetic lysosomal storage disorder characterized by an accumulation of cystine in various organs and tissues. Cysteamine bitartrate (CB) is a cystine-depleting aminothiol agent approved in the United States and Europe in immediate-release and delayed-release (DR) formulations for the treatment of nephropathic cystinosis in children and adults. It is recommended that CBDR be administered with fruit juice (except grapefruit juice) for maximum absorption. Omeprazole is a proton pump inhibitor that inhibits gastric acid secretion and, theoretically, may cause the premature release of cysteamine by increasing intragastric pH, thereby affecting the PK of CBDR. METHODS: This open-label, three-period, randomized study in healthy adult subjects was designed primarily to compare the pharmacokinetics of CBDR capsules after a single oral dose administered with orange juice, water, or multiple oral doses of omeprazole with water at steady state. A total of 32 subjects were randomly assigned to receive study agents in one of two treatment sequences. RESULTS: All subjects completed the study and baseline characteristics of the overall population and the two treatment sequence populations were similar. Peak mean plasma cysteamine concentrations following co-administration of CBDR capsules with orange juice (1892 ng/mL) were higher compared with co-administration with water (1663 ng/mL) or omeprazole 20 mg and water (1712 ng/mL). Mean time to peak plasma concentration was shorter with omeprazole co-administration (2.5 h) compared with orange juice (3.5 h) or water (3.0 h). Statistical comparisons between treatment groups indicated that exposure as assessed by AUC0-t, AUC0-∞, and Cmax were all within the 80-125% bioequivalence ranges for all comparisons. All treatments were generally well tolerated. CONCLUSION: Overall, the pharmacokinetics of cysteamine bitartrate DR capsules are not significantly impacted by co-administration with orange juice, water only, or omeprazole (with water).

However, most α-l-rhamnosidases are easily deactivated at high temperatures, limiting the practice in debittering citrus juices. The V529A mutant of the α-l-rhamnosidase r-Rha1 from Aspergillus niger JMU-TS528 was developed with improved thermostability using directed evolution technology and site-directed mutagenesis. The enzyme mutant had a half-live of thermal inactivation T(1/2) of 1.92 h, 25.00 min, and 2 min at 60, 65, and 70 °C, respectively. In addition, it had improved substrate affinity and better resistance to the inhibition of glucose. The improved substrate affinity was related to its lowered binding energy. Most significantly, the naringin content was reduced to below the bitter taste threshold by treatment with 75 U/mL of the mutant during the preheating process of orange juice production. The comprehensive results indicate that thermostability improvement could promote the practical value of α-l-rhamnosidase in citrus juice processing.",

For high-pressure processing, the juice containing the same concentration of FOS was treated at 450MPa for 5min at 11.5°C in an industrial equipment (Hyperbaric, model: 300). After the treatments, the fructooligosaccharides were qualified and quantified by thin layer chromatography. The organic acids and color analysis were also evaluated. The maximal overall fructooligosaccharides degradation was found after high-pressure processing. The total color difference was <3.0 for high-pressure and plasma processing. citric and ascorbic acid (Vitamin C) showed increased content after plasma and high-pressure treatment. Thus, atmospheric pressure cold plasma and high-pressure processing can be used as non-thermal alternatives to process prebiotic orange juice.",

This study included 55 healthy women (aged 20 to 40 years): 33 participants received an SFA high-fat meal (≈1000 kcal, 37.6% of energy intake (E) from SFA) and 22 participants received an MUFA high-fat meal (≈1000 kcal, 56.3% E from MUFA). Both interventions were accompanied by 500 ml of orange juice (test) or water (control). The plasma concentrations of inflammatory cytokines (IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, IL-17A, IFN-γ, and TNF-α) and CRP were determined before (fasting) and 2, 3 and 5 hours after the test meal intake. The SFA high-fat meal induced a significant increase in AUC values (for TNF-α, IL-12, IL-10, IL-6 and IL-2 adjusted for baseline concentrations) in comparison with MUFA high-fat meal intervention. The results were independent of the drink which accompanied the meal (water or orange juice). Both IL-4 and IL-17A AUC values were significantly increased after an SFA high-fat meal intake, accompanied by water, but not by orange juice. In addition, these values were higher in relation to MUFA high-fat meal interventions. Also, IL-17A significantly increased at 3 h after an SFA high-fat meal intake accompanied by water, but not by orange juice. Overall, our conclusions indicate an anti-inflammatory effect of MUFA compared to SFA high-fat meal intake, while orange juice intake was able to mitigate the subclinical increase of postprandial inflammation, induced by SFA high-fat meal consumption, for a particular biomarker (IL-17A).",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Assumptions have linked orange juice (OJ) consumption with weight gain and adverse effects on health due to its sugar content; however, epidemiologic studies have not shown increased risk for overweight or obesity with the consumption of 100% OJ. The aim of this study was to verify whether the combination of a reduced-calorie diet (RCD) and 100% OJ contribute to weight loss, promote changes in glucose and lipid metabolism, and improve diet quality in obese individuals. METHODS: A randomized controlled trial with 78 obese patients (age 36 ± 1 y, body mass index [BMI] 33 ± 3 kg/m2) were enrolled in two groups: Individuals in the OJ group submitted to an RCD that included OJ (500 mL/d), and individuals in the control group submitted to an RCD without OJ. Body composition, biochemical biomarkers, and dietary intake were analyzed over a 12-wk period. RESULTS: Both treatments had similar outcomes regarding body weight (-6.5 kg; P = 0.363), BMI (-2.5 kg/m2; P = 0.34), lean mass (-1 kg; P = 0.29), fat mass (-5 kg; P = 0.58), body fat (-3%; P = 0.15), and waist-to-hip ratio (-0.1; P = 0.79). Insulin levels in the OJ group decreased by 18% (P = 0.05), homeostasis model assessment-insulin resistance by 33% (P = 0.04), total cholesterol by 24% (P = 0.004), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol by 24% (P ≤ 0.001), and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein levels by 33% (P = 0.001) compared with the control group. Consumption of energy and nutrients was similar between the two groups, but vitamin C and folate increased by 62% (P ≤ 0.015) and 39% (P = 0.033), respectively, after OJ intervention. CONCLUSION: When consumed concomitantly with an RCD, OJ does not inhibit weight loss; ameliorate the insulin sensitivity, lipid profile, or inflammatory status, or contribute nutritionally to the quality of the diet.",

Supplementation with antioxidants has been suggested to minimize the diseases effects. Objective: This study assessed whether orange juice, a source of citrus flavonoids and vitamin C, may contribute to the treatment of patients with chronic hepatitis C. Design: Anthropometric, hemodynamic, dietary, and biochemical parameters, CRP and liver enzymes were measured in 43 adult patients of both genders who were diagnosed with chronic hepatitis C and were under antiviral therapy. Twenty-three patients were supplemented with orange juice for eight consecutive weeks, while 20 were enrolled as control group. Results: Following regular use of orange juice, no alterations were found in body mass, fat, and waist circumference. The serum levels of total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, CRP and parameters of oxidative stress decreased in the orange juice group. Furthermore, the levels of the liver enzyme AST decreased in those who had high levels before the intervention. Conclusion: The orange juice was a convenient food in the diet of patients due to the increase in antioxidant capacity and decreased inflammation and cholesterol in blood serum, in addition to maintaining body mass, which protect against the harmful effects caused by the chronic hepatitis C virus.​​​."

In this method, three spike levels (0.25, 1, and 20 ng/g) were tested in triplicate. Absolute recoveries for penillic and penilloic acids were 60-75% depending on the matrix used, whereas corrected recoveries of penicillin G using an isotopically labeled internal standard were ~100%.

METHODS AND RESULTS: Thirty subjects aged 22-63 years from the BIONAOS study consumed a normal-polyphenol OJ (NPJ) or a high-polyphenol OJ (HPJ) (299 or 745 mg/L, respectively) for 12 weeks in a randomized, parallel, double-blind study. UHPLC-MS, univariate and multivariate statistical analysis and ROC curves were used to design biomarkers of consumption in serum. We propose betonicine, stachydrine, methyl glucopyranoside (alpha+beta), dihydroferulic acid and galactonate as a new metabolic signature to distinguish the intake of OJ with a different polyphenol content. Changes in metabolites related to OJ, oxidative stress and inflammation were observed. After HPJ consumption, the serum levels of hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid (9-HODE+13-HODE) and dihydroxyoctadecanoic acid (12,13-DiHOME and 9,10-DiHOME) decreased, whereas levels of 12-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (12-HETE) increased. 5-HETE increased after the NPJ intervention exclusively. CONCLUSION: We designed a new panel of biomarkers to differentiate the intake of OJs containing different doses of polyphenols. On the other hand, the consumption of an OJ with a high content of flavanones improved oxidative stress and inflammatory biomarkers.",

The aim of this study was to examine the effects of a flavonoid-rich extract from orange juice (OJe) in some rodent models of epilepsy and to explore its possible mechanism of action. The genetically audiogenic seizures (AGS)-susceptible DBA/2 mouse, the pentylenetetrazole (PTZ)-induced seizures in ICR-CD1 mice and the WAG/Rij rat as a genetic model of absence epilepsy with comorbidity of depression were used. Our results demonstrate that OJe was able to exert anticonvulsant effects on AGS-sensible DBA/2 mice and to inhibit PTZ-induced tonic seizures, increasing their latency. Conversely, it did not have anti-absence effects on WAG/Rij rats. Our experimental findings suggest that the anti-convulsant effects of OJe are likely mediated by both an inhibition of NMDA receptors at the glycine-binding site and an agonistic activity on benzodiazepine-binding site at GABAA receptors. This study provides evidences for the antiepileptic activity of OJe, and its results could be used as scientific basis for further researches aimed to develop novel complementary therapy for the treatment of epilepsy in a context of a multitarget pharmacological strategy."

However, there have been reports in the media claiming detrimental consequences of 100% juice consumption, including weight-gain and adverse effects on insulin sensitivity and blood lipid profile. The effect of daily OJ consumption was assessed using a randomised, placebo-controlled, single-blinded, parallel group design. Thirty-six overweight, but otherwise healthy men (40-60 years; 27-35 kg m(-2)) with elevated fasting serum cholesterol (5-7 mmol l(-1)), were recruited from the general UK population. None were using nutritional strategies or medication to lower their cholesterol, nor were regular consumers of citrus products. Assessment of BMI, HOMA-IR, and circulating lipid (total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein, high-density lipoprotein, non-esterified fatty acids, triacylglycerol, apolipoprotein-A1 and apolipoprotein-B) concentrations, was made when fasted before (V1) and after a 12-week intervention (V2), during which participants consumed 250 ml per d of OJ or an energy and sugars-matched orange-flavoured drink (control). The two groups were matched at V1 with respect to all parameters described above. Although triacylglycerol concentration was similar between the groups at both visits, a trend for the change in this variable to differ between groups was observed (P = 0.060), with those in control exhibiting a significant increase in triacylglycerol at V2, compared with V1. In OJ, those with the highest initial triacylglycerol concentration showed the greatest reduction at V2 (R(2) = 0.579; P < 0.001), whereas there was no correlation between these variables in controls (R(2) = 0.023; P = 0.548). Twelve weeks consumption of 250 ml per d of OJ did not adversely affect insulin sensitivity, circulating lipids or body weight.",

For this study, 12 gastrostomy tubes (6 polyethylene and 6 silicone) were set at 50 mL/h. Each feeding set was filled with Isosource HN with fibre or Novasource Renal. Each tube was irrigated with 1 glucose therapy agent, providing approximately 20 g of carbohydrate every 4 h. Flow-rate measurements were collected at 2 h intervals. The results showed that the glucose therapy agent choice affected flow rates: apple juice and cola had higher average flow rates than orange juice (P = 0.01). A significant difference was found between tube type and enteral formula: polyethylene tubes had higher average flow rates than silicone tubes (P < 0.0001), and Isosource HN with fibre had higher flow rates than Novasource Renal (P = 0.01). We concluded that apple juice and cola have less tube clogging potential than orange juice, and thus may be considered as primary treatment options for hypoglycemia in enterally fed patients. Polyethylene tubes and Isosource HN with fibre were less likely to clog than silicone tubes and Novasource Renal.",

HPHP and soy milk diminished AJ's total phenolic bioaccessibility 29.3%, 26.3%, respectively, whereas TT and bovine milk hardly affected it. HPHP had little effect on GJ's and OJ's total phenolic bioaccessibility, while TT enhanced them 27.3-33.9%, 19.0-29.2%, respectively, and milk matrix increased them 26.6-31.1%, 13.3-43.4%, respectively. Furthermore, TT (80 °C/30 min) and TT (90 °C/30 s) presented the similar influences on GJ's and OJ's phenolic bioaccessibility. Skimmed milk showed a better enhancing effect on OJ's total phenolic bioaccessibility than soy and whole milk, but had a similar effect on GJ's as whole milk. These results contribute to promoting the health benefits of fruit juices by optimizing the processing and formulas in the food industry.",

Volunteers consumed red orange juice daily for 8 weeks, with clinical and biochemical assessments performed at baseline and on the final day. There was no change in the abdominal obesity, but low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, C-reactive protein decreased, while there was an increase of the antioxidant activity in serum after red orange juice consumption. Insulin resistance and systolic blood pressure were reduced in normal-weight volunteers, while diastolic blood pressure decreased in overweight volunteers after intervention. Red orange juice showed anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and lipid-lowering properties that may prevent the development of metabolic syndrome.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Red-fleshed sweet orange juice (ROJ) comes from a new variety of citrus cultivated in Brazil that contains high levels of β-carotene and lycopene, and similar amounts of hesperidin (HSP) and nutrients, equivalently to blond orange juice (BOJ). Such bioactive compounds are associated with chemopreventive actions in several cancer cell lines. The purpose of this study was to examine the cytotoxicity, cell cycle, apoptosis, and cytokine secretion after BOJ, ROJ, and HSP treatment of a novel T acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell line, Loucy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Loucy cells were incubated for 24-h with BOJ, ROJ, and HSP, and the viability was measured using trypan blue. Cell cycling and apoptosis were assessed by propidium iodide (PI) and annexin V-FITC/PI flow cytometry, respectively. Secretion of cytokines IL-1α, IL1-β, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, IL-17A, IFNγ, TNFα, TGFβ, MIPα, and MIPβ was determined by ELISA array. RESULTS: BOJ and ROJ treatments promoted Loucy cell cytotoxicity. Additionally, BOJ induced cell cycle arrest in the G0/G1 phase, and decreased the cell accumulation in the G2/M. ROJ decreased only the G0/G1 fraction, while HSP did not change the cell cycle. BOJ led to apoptosis in a different fashion of ROJ, while the first treatment induced apoptosis by increase of late apoptosis and primary necrotic fractions, the second increased early and late apoptosis, and primary necrotic fraction compared to positive controls. HSP had no effect on apoptosis. IL-6 and IL-10 were abrogated by all treatments. CONCLUSIONS: Taking together, these results suggest potential chemopreventive effects of BOJ and ROJ on Loucy cells.",

A novel treatment methodology based on combination of ultrasound and UV irradiations was investigated. The juice quality was assessed in terms of standard parameters (taste, flavor, odor, mouth feel etc.) by panel tests. Physicochemical analysis in terms of color of processed juice (which is an important physical attribute) and oxidation reduction potential (a good indicator of the quantum of oxidants present in the fruit juices) has also been performed. Thermally treated juices had significantly different characteristics that were not very appealing as compared to the ultrasound treated juices or those treated using the combined approach. The sensory properties of the ultrasound treated juices showed that the samples were most acceptable to the consumers and rated at par with the quality parameters of the fresh untreated juices. Overall the present work is the first to report and conclusively establish the usefulness of ultrasound based treatment approaches for maintaining the sensory profile in comparison with the thermally processed juice.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The consumption of orange juice may lead to reduced oxidative stress and may enhance the antioxidant defense system. OBJECTIVE: The aim was to evaluate the effects of the intake of orange juice containing either normal (NPJ) or high (HPJ) concentrations of polyphenols (299 and 745 mg/d, respectively) on the antioxidant defense system, oxidative stress biomarkers, and clinical signs of metabolic syndrome in 100 nonsmoking subjects who were either overweight or obese. METHODS: A randomized, double-blind crossover study was conducted over two 12-wk periods with a 7-wk washout period. The effects on enzymatic and nonenzymatic blood antioxidant defense systems, urinary and plasma oxidative stress biomarkers, and clinical signs of metabolic syndrome were evaluated before and after an intervention with both of the orange juices. Paired t tests and linear mixed-effects models were used to evaluate the effects of juice, time, and interactions. RESULTS: The intake of either NPJ or HPJ led to a decrease in urinary 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (NPJ: 935 ± 134 to 298 ± 19 ng/mg creatinine; HPJ: 749 ± 84 to 285 ± 17 ng/mg creatinine), 8-iso-prostaglandin F2α (NPJ: 437 ± 68 to 156 ± 14 ng/mg creatinine; HPJ: 347 ± 43 to 154 ± 13 ng/mg creatinine), erythrocyte catalase, and glutathione reductase activities. A decrease was also observed in body mass index, waist circumference, and leptin (all P < 0.05). The NPJ intervention decreased systolic and diastolic blood pressures (systolic blood pressure: 128 ± 1 to 124 ± 2 mm Hg; diastolic blood pressure: 79 ± 1 to 76 ± 1 mm Hg), whereas the HPJ intervention increased erythrocyte superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity (17.7 ± 1.5 to 23.1 ± 1.7 U/mg hemoglobin). CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that the consumption of either NPJ or HPJ protected against DNA damage and lipid peroxidation, modified several antioxidant enzymes, and reduced body weight in overweight or obese nonsmoking adults. Only blood pressure and SOD activity were influenced differently by the different flavanone supplementations. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT01290250.",

Loss of viability of E. coli O157:H7 increased significantly as pressure and treatment time increased, achieving a 6.5 log cycle reduction at 400 MPa for 3 min at 25 ℃ of treatment. With regard to the inactivation of pectin methyl esterase, the greatest reduction obtained was 90.05 ± 0.01% at 50 ℃ and 500 MPa of pressure for 15 min; therefore, the pectin methyl esterase enzyme was highly resistant to the treatments by high hydrostatic pressure. The results obtained in this study showed a synergistic effect between the high pressure and moderate temperatures in inactivating E. coli cells.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Epidemiologic data suggest inverse associations between citrus flavanone intake and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk. However, insufficient randomized controlled trial data limit our understanding of the mechanisms by which flavanones and their metabolites potentially reduce cardiovascular risk factors. OBJECTIVE: We examined the effects of orange juice or a dose-matched hesperidin supplement on plasma concentrations of established and novel flavanone metabolites and their effects on cardiovascular risk biomarkers in men at moderate CVD risk. DESIGN: In an acute, randomized, placebo-controlled crossover trial, 16 fasted participants (aged 51-69 y) received orange juice or a hesperidin supplement (both providing 320 mg hesperidin) or control (all matched for sugar and vitamin C content). At baseline and 5 h postintake, endothelial function (primary outcome), blood pressure, arterial stiffness, cardiac autonomic function, platelet activation, and NADPH oxidase gene expression and plasma flavanone metabolites were assessed. Before each intervention, a diet low in flavonoids, nitrate/nitrite, alcohol, and caffeine was followed, and a standardized low-flavonoid evening meal was consumed. RESULTS: Orange juice intake significantly elevated mean ± SEM plasma concentrations of 8 flavanone (1.75 ± 0.35 μmol/L, P < 0.0001) and 15 phenolic (13.27 ± 2.22 μmol/L, P < 0.0001) metabolites compared with control at 5 h postconsumption. Despite increased plasma flavanone and phenolic metabolite concentrations, cardiovascular risk biomarkers were unaltered. After hesperidin supplement intake, flavanone metabolites were not different from the control, suggesting altered absorption/metabolism compared with the orange juice matrix. CONCLUSIONS: After single-dose flavanone intake within orange juice, circulating flavanone and phenolic metabolites collectively reached a concentration of 15.20 ± 2.15 μmol/L, but no effects were observed on cardiovascular risk biomarkers. Longer-duration randomized controlled trials are required to examine previous associations between higher flavanone intakes and improved cardiovascular health and to ascertain the relative importance of food matrix and flavanone-derived phenolic metabolites.

Orange juice samples were intentionally fermented in order to increase the natural microflora which were mostly composed of yeasts and then exposed to UV-C irradiation at an intensity level of 1.32 mW/cm(2) and sample depth of 0.153 cm for several exposure times by using a collimated beam apparatus. Applied UV dose was in the range of 0 and 108.42 mJ/cm(2). Resistance of yeast to UV light and existence of suspended particles limited the effectiveness of the process. Survival data obtained for yeasts was either described by the Weibull or traditional first-order model and goodness-of-fit of these models was investigated. Weibull model produced a better fit to the data with higher adjusted determination coefficient (R(2) adj) and lower mean square error (MSE) values which were 0.99 and 0.003, respectively. Time and UV dose of first decimal reduction were obtained as 5.7 min and 31 mJ/cm(2), respectively. The data suggests that biodosimetric studies performed by using inoculated microorganisms for assesment of the efficiency of UV irradiation treatment in the shelf life extension of juices must be carefully evaluated. UV-C irradiation had no influence on the colour of orange juice."

Moro orange is a cultivar of red orange, particularly rich in active compounds such as anthocyanins, hydroxycinnamic acids, flavone glycosides and ascorbic acid, which displays anti-obesity effects in in vitro and in vivo studies. In this clinical study, the effect of a Moro juice extract (Morosil(®), 400 mg/die) supplementation was evaluated in overweight healthy human volunteers for 12 weeks. Results showed that Moro juice extract intake was able to induce a significant reduction in body mass index (BMI) after 4 weeks of treatment (p < 0.05). Moreover, in subjects treated with Moro extract, body weight, BMI, waist and hip circumference were significantly different from the placebo group (p < 0.05). In conclusion, it could be suggested that the active compounds contained in Moro juice have a synergistic effect on fat accumulation in humans and Moro juice extract can be used in weight management and in the prevention of human obesity.",

The effects of voltage gradient and temperature (independent variables) were investigated on PME activity (response) of orange juice. After optimization orange juice was produced and compared with untreated control juices and conventional thermally heated juices on the aspect of PME inactivation and some quality characteristics. Reduction of PME activities was found approximately 96 % in OH groups where conventional thermally heated juice has 88.3 % reduction value. Total pectin content was increased 1.72-2 % after OH applications. Ascorbic acid contents of OH samples were found between 43.08-45.20 mg/100 mL where conventional thermally heated juice has 42.9 mg/100 mL. As a result, it was determined that OH can be applied as a thermal treatment on orange juice production in moderate temperatures for PME inactivation and may improve functional properties of orange juice."

The PME activity of PEF-processed samples decreased or did not change, while that of HP samples increased during storage (p<0.01). A kinetic model was developed expressing PME inactivation as a function of the PEF treatment conditions, and this enabled the estimation of the reaction rate constant (587.8-2375.4s(-1)), and the time required for a 90% reduction (De, 3917.7-969.5s). Quantification of the increase in PEF energy to ensure a ten-fold reduction in De (ze, 63.7 J), activation electric fields (-921.2 kV cm(-1)mol(-1)), and electrical activation energy (12.9 kJ mol(-1)) was also carried out. Consequently, PEF processing was very effective for the inactivation of PME and for providing stability of orange juice during storage.",

      "abstract": "Background. Impaired endothelial function is a predictor of cardiovascular events. Orange juice (OJ) is rich in dietary flavonoids and could inhibit oxidative stress and inflammatory responses. We examined the effects of commercial (COJ) and fresh orange juice (FOJ) on endothelial function and physiological characteristics in healthy humans. Materials and Methods. Twenty-two healthy volunteers years were enrolled in a single blind randomized crossover controlled trial. The two groups consumed either COJ for the first 4 weeks and then FOJ (CFOJ, 4 weeks), or FOJ for the first 4 weeks and then COJ (FCOJ, 4 weeks). We assessed endothelial function by measuring flow-mediated dilation, serum concentrations of lipids, apolipoproteins A and B (apo A-1 and apo B), and inflammatory markers such as vascular endothelial adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1), E-selectin, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), and interleukin-6. Results. Consumption of both juices decreased VCAM, hs-CRP, and E-selectin but increased apo A-1. A decline in LDL occurred in the FOJ group. There were no differences between the characteristics of two groups, with the exception of apo A-1 levels that were increased with both forms of OJ. The largest variations occurred with hs-CRP, VCAM in both groups. Conclusion. Consumption of COJ and FOJ produced beneficial effects on the physiological characteristics of healthy volunteers. Although these results could encourage the consumption of OJ, intervention studies are needed to determine the long-term effects of these types of OJ on metabolic and cardiovascular endpoints."

      "abstract": "A study was conducted to standardize the technology for the removal of amino acids (one of the browning reaction substrates) from sweet orange cv. Malta Common juice to reduce colour and quality deterioration in single strength juice and during subsequent concentration. Juice of sweet orange (Citrus sinensis) cv. Malta Common fruits was extracted by screw type juice extractor, preserved in 500 ppm SO2 and clarified by using \"Pectinase CCM\" enzyme (0.2% for 2 h at 50 ± 2 °C). For removal of amino acids juice was passed under gravity through a glass column packed with an acidic cation exchange resin (CER), Dowex-50 W and quantity to be treated in one lot was standardized. The CER treated and untreated juices were concentrated to 15 and 30°Brix in a rotary vacuum evaporator. Results indicate that 121 ml of orange juice when passed through a glass column (5 cm internal diameter) packed with cation exchange resin (Dowex-50 W) upto a height of 8 cm, could remove about 98.4% of the amino acids with minimum losses in other juice constituents. With cation exchange resin treatment, the non-enzymatic browning and colour deterioration of orange juice semi-concentrates was reduced to about 3 folds in comparison to untreated counterparts. The retention of vitamin C and sugars was also better in semi-concentrates prepared from cation exchange resin treated juice. Thus, cation exchange resin treatment of orange juice prior to concentration and storage is highly beneficial in reduction of non-enzymatic browning, colour deterioration and retention of nutritional, sensory quality of product during preparation and storage."

      "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to verify the immune response induced by intake of orange juice or hesperidin on macrophages through the secretion of cytokines and nitric oxide. Mice were divided in three groups treated orally with orange juice, hesperidin, or control for 2 weeks. Ex vivo macrophages from all groups of mice were cultured with or without lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimuli, and the levels of nitric oxide (NO) and of the cytokines IL-10, IL-12, and TNF-alpha were evaluated. Macrophages of non-LPS-stimulated, orange juice treatment increased IL-12 levels by 143 % and the other cytokines and NO levels were unchanged. Hesperidin treatment increased IL-12 levels by 72 % and strongly decreased the NO secretion. For LPS-stimulated macrophages the orange juice (OJ) treatment decreased TNF-alpha secretion by 100 % and did not alter other cytokines, while NO levels increased 41 %. Hesperidin treatment decreased NO, IL-10, IL-12, and TNF-alpha levels by 56 %, 47 %, 29 %, and 63 %, respectively. In conclusion, OJ and hesperidin showed different immune responses, suggesting that hesperidin displays a suppressive effect on inflammation generated by LPS, while OJ seems to enhance the functions of macrophages associated with antimicrobial activity.",
