      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Allergic asthma is an inflammatory disease of the airways that causes great distress to the patient's normal life. Astragalus Polysaccharide (APS) is the main active ingredient in the traditional Chinese medicine Astragalus mongholicus Bunge, which has the effect of regulating immune function. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the effect of APS on allergic asthma and investigate its potential mechanism of action. METHODS: This study utilized network pharmacology to predict the relevant targets and signaling pathways of APS treatment for allergic asthma. Subsequently, an animal model was established using Ovalbumin (OVA) induction. The efficacy of APS was verified using histopathologic staining and Airway Hyperresponsiveness (AHR) assay. Signaling pathways were examined using Western Blot (WB). Finally, bioinformatics analysis was utilized to explore the correlation between the progression of allergic asthma and signaling pathways. RESULTS: Network pharmacology analysis identified 15 intersection targets significantly enriched in the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. The results of molecular docking showed that small molecule drugs have a strong binding ability to target proteins. The experiments confirmed APS successfully suppressed the pathological symptoms in allergic asthma model mice. Subsequently, WB provided evidence supporting that APS has potential therapeutic effects mediated through the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. The bioinformatics results confirmed that disease progression in allergic asthma patients does correlate with the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that APS may treat allergic asthma by targeting the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. This provides a basis for preliminary research on the clinical application of APS for treating allergic asthma."

      "abstract": "Background: Cancer-related fatigue is the most common complication in patients. Astragalus membranaceus is widely used in many countries to treat cancer, but its efficacy and safety is uncertain. Objectives: This study aimed to summarize the evidence on Astragalus membranaceus on cancer-related fatigue and quality of life in patients with cancer. Methods: Nine electronic databases were explored for the clinical randomized controlled trial of intervention with Astragalus membranaceus alone for cancer-related fatigue and quality of life in cancer patients from inception to July 1, 2022. The risk of bias assessment tool was adopted by Cochrane Handbook 6.1.0. The effect size was estimated using relative risk and mean difference with a corresponding 95% confidence interval. Review Manager 5.4 was used for meta-analysis. The evidence level was assessed using Grading of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE). Results: Eight studies were included. The results of the meta-analysis showed that the addition of Astragalus membranaceus to the control group was effective in reducing cancer-related fatigue (SMD = -1.63, 95% CI [-1.90, -1.36], P < .00001) and (RR = 1.55, 95% CI [1.19, 2.02], P = 0.001) in patients with cancer and improving quality of life (SMD = 0.86, 95% CI [0.17, 1.55], P = 0.01) and (RR = 1.57, 95% CI [1.10, 2.23], P = 0.01). Conclusion: The current evidence is supportive of the efficacy of Astragalus membranaceus in patients with cancer-related fatigue and their quality of life, but due to the small and low quality of the included literature and the lack of uniformity in terms of cancer type as well as treatment modalities, there is currently insufficient evidence to provide strong support for the clinical use of Astragalus membranaceus in the treatment of cancer-related fatigue. More high-quality evidence is needed in the future to further validate the use of Astragalus membranaceus in the treatment of clinical cancer-related fatigue. Registration: A review protocol was developed and registered in the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO). Registration number: CRD42023442277.

The in vitro activity was determined against L. major (MHOM/AF/88/KK27). In addition, the effect of AECE on the generation of nitric oxide (NO) and the rate of macrophage infectivity was evaluated. The, antileishmanial effects of topical administration of AECE at 10 and 20 mg/kg were evaluated In vivo on cutaneous leishmaniasis in mice. The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) index of AECE and amphotericin B for promastigotes was found to be 76.3 and 2.78 μg/mL, respectively. The number of amastigotes exhibited a dose-dependent decline following treatment with AECE. The IC50 and 50% cytotoxic concentration (CC50) for AECE were 39.4 and 408.3 µg/ml, respectively. The extract was observed to induce the creation of NO while simultaneously reducing the level of macrophage infection. Following a four-week course of AECE therapy, the lesions of CL were observed to have healed in the infected mice. Additionally, the number of the amastigote forms of Leishmania in the CL lesions was significantly reduced following AECE therapy in infected mice (p<0.05). These findings demonstrate the considerable inhibitory and eliminatory effects of AECE on Leishmania in vivo and in vitro. Even though we have identified some cellular mechanisms of action for AECE, e.g. reducing the infectivity rate and the induction of NO production against Leishmania parasites, further experiments are essential to identify the specific mechanisms of action, assess safety, and determine its ability in animals and human subjects.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Childhood acute myeloid leukemia (AML) constitutes a significant proportion of pediatric malignancies, with current treatment options remaining limited. This study aimed to investigate the role of Astragalus polysaccharide (APS) in immune infiltration and prognosis of pediatric AML. METHODS: Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified from the GEO database (dataset GSE2191), and APS-related genes (APSRGs) were obtained from the Swiss Target Prediction platform. DEGs with |logFC| > 1 and p < 0.05 were intersected with APSRGs to identify APS-related differentially expressed genes (APSRDEGs), visualized using a Venn diagram. A protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis was conducted to identify hub genes. Gene Ontology (GO) and KEGG enrichment analyses were performed to determine biological processes (BP), cellular components (CC), molecular functions (MF), and relevant pathways associated with the hub genes. Correlation analysis, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, and immune infiltration analysis were conducted to assess the relationship between hub genes and pediatric AML. RESULTS: The GSE2191 dataset was divided into pediatric AML (PAML) and control groups. A total of 1,881 DEGs were identified, of which 20 were APSRDEGs. PPI network analysis revealed that 13 APSRDEGs were interconnected, and nine hub genes were identified: CASP3, PTPRC, ELANE, HMOX1, CHUK, FLT1, JAK3, CTSL, and AURKA. GO and KEGG enrichment analyses indicated that these genes were significantly associated with key biological processes, cellular components, molecular functions, and pathways involved in AML. ROC curve analysis revealed that the expression levels of the nine hub genes differed significantly between the PAML and control groups. Immune infiltration analysis demonstrated a strong correlation between several hub genes and immune cells, with HMOX1 showing the strongest positive correlation with neutrophils. CONCLUSION: This study identified nine hub genes related to APS in pediatric AML. These findings suggest that APS may significantly affect immune infiltration and prognosis in pediatric AML, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic modulator for the disease."

      "abstract": "The treatment of osteoarthritis (OA) remains challenging, with oxidative stress in the cartilage emerging as a key therapeutic target. This study investigates how Astragalus polysaccharide (APS) exerts antioxidant effects in OA using in vivo and in vitro models. In mice, APS mitigates OA progression following surgical destabilization of the medial meniscus (DMM) and protects against oxidative damage. Immunofluorescence analysis revealed decreased thioredoxin (TXN) expression in DMM cartilage, which was restored by APS. APS preserved mitochondrial function, redox balance, and matrix synthesis in chondrocytes in vitro while suppressing metalloproteinase expression. APS also reduced senescence markers (p53, p21INK4a, and p16), DNA damage, and β-galactosidase activity in tert-butyl hydroperoxide (tBHP)-treated chondrocytes. TXN knockdown significantly diminishes the protective effects of APS Further analysis showed that ATF4 overexpression supports the GCN2-ATF4 pathway's involvement in APS. GCN2 inhibition using GCN2iB reduced the regulatory impact of APS on TXN, indicating the crucial role GCN2 in APS-mediated protection. These findings demonstrated that APS protects chondrocytes from oxidative stress and senescence in OA via the GCN2/TXN pathway, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic agent for OA."

      "abstract": "Previous studies conducted by the same group of researchers found that Traditional Chinese Medicine Astragalus mongholicus Bunge and Hedyotis diffusa Willd (A-H) significantly suppressed the cell proliferation of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). MicroRNAs are considered promising candidates for cancer diagnosis and treatment. This study focused on miR-582-3p as the primary subject of investigation to explore the mechanism by which A-H inhibits cell proliferation through miR-582-3p. The overexpressing and silencing miR-582-3p cell models were established by using lentiviral transfection technology. CCK-8 assay (24 h, 48 h, 72 h) and clone formation assay (1 w) were employed to detect the proliferation of A549 cells. Moreover, flow cytometry analysis (24 h) was performed to detect the cell cycle. Western blotting (WB) and a luciferase reporter assay were also used to measure the expression of cell cycle-related proteins and verify the direct interaction between miR-582-3p and p27, respectively. The LV-miR-582-3p inhibitor + shRNA-p27 stable A549 cells were constructed in the same manner to repeat the above-mentioned procedure. The CCK-8 assay was conducted to assess the effects of various concentrations of A-H on the proliferation of A549 cells. A-H-containing serum was prepared to intervene in LV-miR-582-3p and mimic A549 cells. Subsequently, the same procedure was repeated, as described earlier. Results indicated a direct interaction between miR-582-3p and p27. Furthermore, miR-582-3p was found to enhance the proliferation of A549 cells by regulating cell cycle-related proteins, specifically p27. It was also observed that A-H-containing serum inhibited the proliferation of A549 cells through the miR-582-3p-p27 signaling pathway. The study findings revealed the underlying molecular mechanisms of miR-582-3p in the development and prognosis of A549 LUAD cells. In addition, A-H inhibited LUAD proliferation through the miR-582-3p-p27 signaling pathway. These findings may provide a new understanding of the use of Chinese medicine in treating lung cancer.",

Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) is increasingly explored for its potential in cancer treatment. This study investigates the anti-tumor effects of a Chinese herbal extract on an ovarian cancer cell line in vitro. METHODS: The ovarian cancer cell lines OVCAR-3 and SK-OV-3 treated with varying concentrations of the Chinese herbal extract (Astragalus radix) at different course of time. Cell viability using the MTT assay, and apoptosis was examined by flow cytometry after staining with Annexin V/PI staining. Molecular docking and dynamics were carried out to examine the interaction of quinacetol with a well-known target of ovarian cancer, i.e., phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K). RESULTS: The Chinese herbal extract Astragalus radix significantly reduced the viability of ovarian cancer cells in a time- and dose- dependent way. Flow cytometry analysis revealed increased apoptotic rates in ovarian cancer cells compared to controls. Quinacetol was found to interact at active site of PI3K with binding energy of -6.9 kcal/mol. The PI3K-quinacetol complex was stable at physiological conditions as evident from molecular simulation studies. CONCLUSION: The findings of this study demonstrate that the Chinese herbal extract (Astragalus radix) exhibits potent anti-tumor effects against ovarian cancer cells in vitro, highlighting its potential as an adjunct or alternative therapeutic option. Further in vivo studies in animal models and clinical trials are warranted to explore the efficacy and safety of this herbal treatment in ovarian cancer patients."

No substantial distinctions were noted between the two groups in terms of CD8 + T cell count [MD = -1.74, 95% CI (-4.66, 1.17), P = 0.242]. Regarding adverse reactions, the incidence of symptoms such as hand-foot numbness and weakness was low, indicating a high safety profile. Supplementation with APS can improve treatment outcomes, enhance immune function, and demonstrate a high level of safety in malignant tumor patients, making it a promising option for clinical use. However, given the variety of cancer types included in the studies, future research should focus on specific cancer types."

Their roots can be decocted to a botanical drug decoction \"Danggui Buxue Tang (DBT),\" demonstrating human anti-inflammatory. METHODS: Here, we evaluate the mitigating function of DBT on lung inflammation and early fibrosis in a rat model. The model was established by tracheal dripping of silica suspension for 28 days. Positive intervention effects of DBT were observed in a dose-dependent manner after consecutive gavage of DBT (1.9, 3.8, and 7.6 g/kg·bw/d) for 28 days and 42 days. To explore the underlying molecular mechanism. DBT metabolites were profiled using a liquid chromatograph-mass spectrometer and the Chemspider database. RESULTS: Lung inflammation and fibrosis were confirmed using functional tests and histopathologic analysis. Metabolite target analysis identified nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase 4 (NOX4) as a key target of DBT in regulating pulmonary fibrosis. Gene ontology (GO) analysis estimated that oxidative stress, inflammatory response, myofibroblast differentiation, and extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition were the major target pathways of DBT. KEGG analysis found that DBT might modulate pulmonary fibrosis through the transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) pathway. GO chord and signaling pathway maps revealed that NOX4 contributes to oxidative stress, inflammatory response, and TGF-β pathway regulation. The in vivo analyses confirmed that DBT significantly reduces NOX4 protein expression, inhibits oxidative stress and inflammatory responses, and reduces TGF-β1, p-SMAD3, fibronectin 1 (FN1), and smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) protein expression. DISCUSSION: These findings demonstrate the lung-protecting function of DBT in a rat model and identify critical target proteins associated with the underlying mechanism."

(Fabaceae family) (AOCE) on apoptosis induction and DNA damage in protoscoleces and hydatid cysts of Echinococcus granulosus. METHODS: The protoscolicidal properties of AOCE were examined through both in vitro and ex vivo studies on hydatid cyst protoscoleces, utilizing the eosin exclusion assay. Additionally, we evaluated the effects of AOCE on apoptosis induction and DNA damage in the protoscoleces using a colorimetric protease assay and real-time PCR analysis, respectively. The in vivo efficacy was determined by measuring the quantity, dimensions, and mass of hydatid cysts in infected murine subjects. RESULTS: The findings indicated that AOCE, particularly at a concentration of 45.0 mg/mL, effectively eliminated protoscoleces of hydatid cysts within a 30-min exposure period. Additionally, AOCE demonstrated prolonged anti-parasitic effects in ex vivo conditions, in contrast to the immediate lethal effects observed in vitro (p < 0.001). AOCE significantly (p < 0.01) induced caspase-3 activation in protoscoleces obtained from hydatid cysts relative to the control normal saline group. Furthermore, the results from Real-time PCR analysis indicated a significant (p < 0.001) upregulation in the expression levels of the EgATM and EgP53 genes following treatment with AOCE. By in vivo, we found that treatment with AOCE mainly at 200 mg/kg significantly (p < 0.001) reduced the number, size, and weight of hydatid cyst relative to the control group treated with normal saline group. Biochemical analysis also demonstrated that administration of AOCE to infected mice, led to a marked improvement and a reduction in serum levels of liver function factors. CONCLUSION: The results indicated that AOCE exhibits considerable in vitro and ex vivo scolicidal properties against hydatid cyst protoscoleces. Furthermore, the results highlighted AOCE's capacity to eradicate protoscoleces through the induction of apoptosis and the infliction of DNA damage. Additionally, AOCE demonstrated significant therapeutic efficacy in managing hydatid cysts in murine models. However, further studies are required to clarify the specific mechanisms underlying its action and to assess its efficacy in clinical trials, which may facilitate the application of AOCE in the context of hydatid cyst surgical procedures."

      "abstract": "Astragali radix is widely used to treat diabetes and Astragalus polysaccharides (APS) is a primary bioactive compound. Previous evidence has demonstrated that APS, when administered, is an effective monomer in the treatment of diabetic nephropathy (DN). In the present systematic review and meta-analysis, the effects and potential underlying mechanisms of APS in the treatment of DN were evaluated. PubMed, Embase, EBSCO, Web of Science and OVID databases were employed to obtain the published studies included in the present meta-analysis up to April 2024. Each article's quality was assessed using the Jadad score assessment scale. The odds ratios of risk factors were pooled using a random-effects meta-analysis model. Heterogeneity was assessed using the Cochrane Q statistics and I-Square (I2) tests, and publication bias was detected using the funnel plot and/or Egger's test. If necessary, the authors of the identified papers were contacted for more information. The primary outcomes were analyzed, including the parameters of creatinine, kidney-to-urine protein, blood urea nitrogen, urine protein and fasting blood glucose. Additionally, APS was found to reduce known risk factors, including kidney weight and total cholesterol levels. Furthermore, it was revealed that the therapeutic effects of APS in DN may be associated with antifibrotic, anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative stress processes. The findings of the present study have validated the anti-DN effects of APS, and the safety of its use; however, further rigorously designed and well-performed preclinical trials are required in order to fully evaluate the anti-DN effects and safety of APS, and to verify these findings prior to its possible clinical application."

      "abstract": "Fluoride is an essential trace element required for normal physiological functions and holds significant importance for human health. However, excessive fluoride intake can lead to renal damage, for which effective prevention and therapeutic strategies remain scarce. Astragalus polysaccharide (APS), a major bioactive component of the traditional Chinese herb Astragalus membranaceus, possesses pharmacological properties including anti-inflammatory, antiviral, and antioxidant activities. In this study, we investigated the protective effects of APS against fluoride-induced renal injury in vivo experiment. Additionally, network pharmacology and molecular docking techniques were employed to predict its potential mechanisms of action, while the protein expression levels of key target molecules were validated. The results demonstrated that APS intervention significantly alleviated renal injury and oxidative stress induced by sodium fluoride (NaF) in rats. Key targets involved in the amelioration of fluoride-induced renal damage by APS included STAT3, Caspase-3, JUN, MMP1, and PTGS2. Molecular docking analysis revealed high-affinity binding between APS and these core targets. Immunohistochemical and Western blot analysis further confirmed that APS suppressed the expression of pro-apoptotic proteins STAT3, Caspase-3, JUN, and MMP1 while enhancing the expression of the anti-apoptotic protein PTGS2. Overall, our findings suggest that APS alleviates fluoride-induced renal injury by modulating multiple targets, with the potential mechanism linked to the regulation of apoptotic processes. This study provides a theoretical basis for the prevention and treatment of fluoride toxicity.",

The results of the particle size, zeta potential, surface hydrophobicity, intrinsic fluorescence, surface free sulfhydryl, rheological and differential scanning calorimetry showed that AGPS improved the tertiary structure stability of PWP. Simultaneous rheology and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy traced the breaks of aromatic groups and the formation of PWP-AGPS hydrogels through hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interactions during heat process. The correctness of the experimental results was verified via molecular docking and 2-dimensional correlation spectroscopy. Cryogenic scanning electron microscopy images showed that the interaction between PWP and AGPS caused the denser microstructure of hydrogels. In summary, AGPS could promote gelation and improve the physicochemical properties of PWP-AGPS hydrogels. The findings of this study provided a theoretical basis for the application of protein-polysaccharide hydrogels in the food industry, offering insights for practical use."

This study aimed to investigate the effects and underlying mechanisms of probiotic-fermented A. membranaceus and Raphani Semen (PROAS) in cyclophosphamide (CTX)-induced immunocompromised mice. Changes in the composition of A. membranaceus and Raphani Semen after fermentation by probiotic strains, including Bifidobacterium longum SD5219, Lactobacillus fermentum NCIMB5221, and Lactobacillus paracasei SD5219, were identified using high-performance liquid chromatography. The immunostimulatory effects and mechanisms of PROAS were evaluated in immunosuppressed mice 3 and 7 days after CTX treatment. Probiotic fermentation of TCMs resulted in changes in major bioactive components. PROAS supplementation effectively restored intestinal integrity in CTX-treated mice by upregulating the mRNA expression of the tight junction proteins. PROAS significantly ameliorated the reduction in the spleen index and number of B lymphocytes caused by CTX treatment and regulated the secretion of cytokines in serum and colon tissues. PROAS administration modulated gut microbial dysbiosis and short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) content in CTX-treated mice. These results suggest that PROAS enhances B lymphocyte function by increasing the regulation of intestinal microbiota to produce high levels of SCFA, repairs the intestinal barrier damage induced by CTX, and promotes intestinal mucosal immunity."

This study analyzed the preventive and therapeutic effects of APS on chicks infected with Eimeria tenella (E.tenella) and its impact on intestinal health. A total of 120 1-day-old Hy-Line Brown chicks were assigned to four groups (2 × 2 factorial): (1) Control (0 mg/L APS + 0 sporulated oocysts/chick), (2) APS (1000 mg/L APS + 0 sporulated oocysts/chick), (3) E.tenella (0 mg/L APS + 5×104 sporulated oocysts/chick), (4) E.tenella+APS (1000 mg/L APS + 5×104 sporulated oocysts/chick). The results showed that the addition of APS to the drinking water increased the average daily gain and body weight (day 25) while reduced feed conversion ratio in E.tenella-infected chicks (P < 0.05). APS mitigated cecal lesions (P < 0.05), decreased oocyst shedding (P < 0.05), lowered spleen index (P < 0.05), and elevated bursa and thymus indices (P < 0.05). Serum total protein and alkaline phosphatase activity increased (P < 0.05). Cecal tissue mRNA expression of IL-2, IgG, IgM, Claudin1, Claudin2, ZO-1, and Occludin were increased (P < 0.05), whereas IL-1β, TNF-α, and NF-κB were decreased (P < 0.05). APS enriched cecal f_Lactobacillaceae, g_Lactobacillus, g_Tuzzerella, g_Oscillospira, and g_UBA1819 (P < 0.05). Furthermore, the anti-coccidial index (142.10) indicated low-level efficacy. In conclusion, APS alleviated E.tenella damage by modulating immunity, inflammation, microbiota, and intestinal barriers. Although APS demonstrated limited direct anti-coccidial activity, its multi-faceted protective effects suggest potential in the prevention and treatment of coccidiosis."

This study investigates the use of non-thermal processing methods, ultrasonic, microwave, and high hydrostatic pressure processing, as alternatives to traditional natural aging for improving the physicochemical properties, antioxidant activity, color stability, and volatile compound profile of astragalus mead. Response surface methodology was employed to optimize fermentation conditions, which yielded the highest flavonoid content and sensory quality at an impregnation time of 12 h, an impregnation temperature of 10 °C, and a fermentation temperature of 20 °C. Among the processing methods evaluated (natural aging, ultrasound, microwave irradiation, and high hydrostatic pressure), ultrasound treatment resulted in the most significant improvements. Specifically, it increased total phenol content by 7.22 %, total flavonoid content by 9.41 %, and antioxidant capacity by 65.43 %. Volatile compound analysis also revealed a 191.30 % increase in ester content, significantly enhancing floral and fruity notes. Sensory analysis using quantitative descriptive analysis, partial least squares discriminant analysis, and weighted gene co-expression network analysis confirmed the efficacy of ultrasound, with ethyl caprylate identified as a key aroma contributor. These findings suggest that ultrasound is an effective non-thermal processing technique for improving the aging process and overall quality of astragalus mead. This study provides valuable insights for the industrial application of non-thermal processing technologies in astragalus mead production.",

Astragalus membranaceus (Fisch.) Bge. (A. membranaceus) is one of China's homologous lists of medicines and food, and its active component saponins have neuroprotective effects. This study examines the mechanism of saponins from A. membranaceus (AS) in treating AD. UPLC-Q-TOF-MS analyzed the composition of AS. Ferroptosis models were established to evaluate the anti-AD efficacy. As a result, AS treatment inhibited ferroptosis in SAMP8 mice by restoring iron homeostasis and lipid peroxidation (LPO) balance in the brain, thereby improving cognitive impairment and pathological damage. Mechanistically, AS treatment reduced Fe2+, MDA, and ROS levels and enhanced protein levels of SLC7A11, GPX4, FTH1, and FPN1. NADPH oxidase 4 (NOX4) overexpression revealed that AS treatment inhibited NOX4, thereby reducing NOX4 stability and regulating the NOX4/Nrf2 pathway in erastin-injured HT22 cells and significantly alleviating ferroptosis. Therefore, AS inhibited ferroptosis and improved AD by rebuilding iron homeostasis and LPO balance in the brain. AS has the potential to be a promising candidate medicine for AD.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Cisplatin (DDP) has been used in the treatment of various human cancers. However, DDP alone lacks efficacy in treating triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), and its clinical application is often hampered by side effects. Astragalus polysaccharide (APS) is one of the active components extracted from Astragalus membranaceus and has gained attention for its various biological properties. This research is aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of a combination of APS and DDP on TNBC and explore the potential mechanisms. METHODS: The efficacy and mechanisms of single or combined treatment were evaluated using Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK8) assay, Annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)/propidium iodide (PI) staining, wound healing assay, trans-well invasion/migration assay, hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining, immunohistochemical (IHC) staining, Western Blot (WB) analysis, and fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). An orthotopic model of TNBC was used to assess the in vivo treatment efficacy of single or combination treatment. RESULTS: APS significantly enhanced the anti-proliferative, anti-migratory, and anti-invasive effects of DDP on TNBC cells. The combination of APS and DDP downregulated anti-apoptotic genes (Bcl2 and Bcl-xL) while upregulating pro-apoptotic genes (Puma, Cle-Caspase3, Cle-PARP), leading to enhanced apoptosis. This combination treatment increased E-cadherin levels, decreased Vimentin, Snail, Slug, and Twist levels, and effectively suppressed epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-associated cell invasion. In the orthotopic model of TNBC, a synergistic reduction in tumor growth was observed in mice treated with APS and DDP. Additionally, the combination of APS and DDP induced the infiltration of CD8+ T lymphocytes into the tumor immune microenvironment. CONCLUSION: The combination of APS and DDP exhibits more potent tumor inhibition and anti-tumor immunity than either agent alone, representing a novel approach to enhance therapeutic efficacy without increasing the side effects of DDP.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Gastric cancer (GC) is a malignant tumor of the digestive tract originating from the epithelial cells of the gastric mucosa, which is highly invasive and heterogeneous, posing a serious threat to human health. In recent years, ferroptosis, as a novel mode of programmed cell death, has shown potential anticancer effects in tumor therapy. Total Astragalus saponins (TAS), a natural product derived from Astragalus membranaceus, have been shown to possess various pharmacological activities, including anticancer effects. This study aimed to investigate the effects of TAS on GC cells, focusing on the mechanism of action of its regulation of the silent information regulator 3 (SIRT3) in inducing ferroptosis in GC cells. METHODS: We treated SGC-7901 cells with TAS at concentrations of 50, 100, and 200 µg/mL. After TAS treatment, the SGC-7901 cells were transfected with a vector designed to knock down SIRT3 expression. We assessed cell proliferation, viability, and apoptosis using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT assay), colony formation assay, and flow cytometry. SIRT3 expression was measured by real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Fe2+, malondialdehyde (MDA), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and superoxide dismutase assay kits were used to detect the level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by fluorescent probe assay. Western blot was used to detect apoptosis-related proteins and SIRT3 protein expression. RESULTS: TAS dose-dependently inhibited SGC-7901 cell proliferation and viability (P<0.05) and induced apoptosis (P<0.05). TAS promoted the expression of SIRT3 and ACSL4 proteins (P<0.05), inhibited the expression of SLC7A11 and GPX4 proteins (P<0.05), and induced ferroptosis of SGC-7901 cells (P<0.05). Knockdown of the SIRT3 gene attenuated the effect of TAS treatment on ferroptosis (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: TAS has therapeutic potential for GC and can effectively inhibit the proliferation and viability of SGC-7901 cells, and the mechanism may be that TAS upregulates SIRT3 to promote the ferroptosis of SGC-7901 cells."

Add 0% (T1), 0.2% (T5), 0.4% (T6) and 0.6% (T7) of FAP to the basal diet, respectively. The trial lasted for 42 days. The results indicated that, compared to the T1 group, FW and ADG of broilers in each treatment group were significantly increased (p < 0.05). The slaughter rates of the T6 and T7 groups were significantly higher compared to the T1 group, meanwhile, the carcass yields of the T5, T6, and T7 groups were notably enhanced (p < 0.05). Compared with T1 group, the activities of CAT, GSH-Px and the content of T-AOC in T6 and T7 groups were increased (p < 0.05), while the content of MDA was decreased (p < 0.05).

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Lupus nephritis (LN) is a serious complication of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) that requires effective management to prevent kidney damage and other systemic effects. While Western medicine provides the standard treatment, incorporating traditional Chinese medicine, such as Astragalus-containing Chinese herbal medicine (CHM), may offer additional benefits in improving patient outcomes. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of the efficacy and safety of Astragalus in conjunction with Western medicine for the treatment of LN. METHODS: We conducted a comprehensive, global systematic search across databases including PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), and Wanfang. Data were synthesized using fixed- or random-effects models, depending on the level of heterogeneity. Results were presented as standardized mean difference (SMD), risk ratios (RRs), or number needed to treat (NNT) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). The Cochrane Q test and I2 statistics were used to test the heterogeneity assessment. Trial sequential analysis (TSA) was employed to assess the power of the results. All statistical analysis was carried out using STATA (version 16.0). RESULT: The analysis included 14 RCTs, with a total of 800 patients (417 in the treatment group and 383 in the control group). Our meta-analysis revealed that patients treated with Astragalus-containing CHM alongside Western medicine showed markedly improved outcomes compared to those receiving only Western medicine. Significant improvements were observed in Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI) scores (SMD = 1.01, 95% CI: 0.71-1.30, P < 0.001), 24-h proteinuria (SMD = 0.51, 95% CI: 0.35-0.66, P < 0.001SMD = 0.51, 95% CI: 0.35-0.66, P < 0.001), serum creatinine (SCr) levels (SMD = 0.64, 95%CI: 0.27-1.01, P < 0.001), blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels (SMD = 0.73, 95%CI: 0.53-0.92, P < 0.001), and overall response rates (ORR) (RR = 1.21, 95%CI: 1.10-1.34, P < 0.001). Additionally, the incidence of adverse events (AEs), such as diarrhea, fever, and other symptoms, was significantly lower in the group treated with Astragalus-containing CHM and Western medicine (RR = 0.56, 95%CI: 0.42-0.73, P < 0.001). The TSA indicated that the data were sufficiently robust to draw reliable numerical conclusions regarding the ORR and the incidence of AEs. CONCLUSION: The inclusion of Astragalus-containing CHM alongside Western medicine may be a promising strategy for to improve the therapeutic effectiveness and reduce toxicity in the treatment of LN."

      "abstract": "ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Astragalus membranaceus, commonly known as Huangqi in China, is a traditional herbal medicine that has attracted significant attention for its immunomodulatory effects. It has been widely studied in various clinical contexts, including cancer treatment. Astragalus injection (HQI) is clinically used for treating myocarditis and cardiac insufficiency. However, its potential therapeutic effects on osteosarcoma, a highly aggressive bone tumor, remain largely unexplored. AIM OF THE STUDY: The aim of this study was to investigate the potential therapeutic effects of HQI on osteosarcoma and to elucidate its underlying mechanisms of action. Specifically, we aimed to determine whether HQI could inhibit osteosarcoma growth in vivo, identify its key active components and molecular targets, and explore its immunomodulatory effects on the tumor microenvironment. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Mice with osteosarcoma were treated with HQI, and tumor growth was monitored. The number of CD8+ T cells in spleen was assessed using flow cytometry. High-performance liquid chromatography coupled with electrospray ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (HPLC-ESI-TOF-MS/MS) was used to identify the active ingredients of HQI that entered the peripheral blood of treated mice. Network pharmacology and weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) were employed to identify key molecular targets of HQI in osteosarcoma inhibition. In vitro cell assays were conducted to evaluate the effects of HQI and its active components on osteosarcoma cell viability. Molecular docking studies were performed to identify the binding affinity of key active components to the identified molecular targets. The expression of Cathepsin L (CTSL) and the activation of cytotoxic T lymphocytes were assessed in vivo and in vitro to elucidate the primary mechanism of action of HQI and its active component calycosin 7-O-β-D-glucoside (CG). RESULTS: Our study found that HQI significantly suppresses osteosarcoma growth in vivo by increasing the number of CD8+ T cells, without causing significant toxic side effects. Eight active ingredients entered the peripheral blood of mice through HPLC-ESI-TOF-MS/MS detection. The network pharmacology and WGCNA revealed that CTSL was a key target of HQI in osteosarcoma inhibition. Cell assays and molecular docking identified CG as the key active component of HQI to inhibit the activity of osteosarcoma cells, capable of binding to CTSL. In vivo, CG activates cytotoxic T lymphocytes and inhibits CTSL expression, thereby exerting its anti-osteosarcoma effects. CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrated that HQI, particularly its active component CG, holds potential as a therapeutic agent for osteosarcoma. The primary mechanism underlying its anti-osteosarcoma effects involves modulating the immune response and targeting CTSL. These findings provide a scientific basis for the development of HQI as a novel immunomodulatory therapy for osteosarcoma.",

Astragalus polysaccharides (APS), as an edible active substance in Astragalus membranaceus, have a therapeutic effect on diabetes and its complications. We investigated the effects and mechanism of APS in high-fat-diet-induced (HFD) diabetic UAB mice. APS significantly reduced fasting plasma glucose, insulin, and HOMA-IR index. Furthermore, APS treatment significantly decreased maximum bladder capacity, residual volume, bladder compliance, contraction intervals, empty and full resting pressure, and increased voiding volume and voided efficiency. In addition, APS ameliorated the hyporesponsiveness of purinergic and cholinergic-mediated neuromuscular contraction of the detrusor and improved the dysregulation of inhibitory and excitatory neurotransmission by downregulating the levels of nNOS and VIP, and upregulating ChAT and SP in HFD mice. This study revealed that APS ameliorates diabetic UAB via the normalization of neuromuscular conduction.",

Astragalus polysaccharides (APS) is the main active component of Astragalus membranaceus Bunge. It has demonstrated anticancer properties across a range of cancer types as well as to be effective against cisplatin induced immune damage. However, its therapeutic mechanism has not been fully explored. This study aimed to explore the antitumor mechanisms of APS and elucidate the relationship between APS and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in exhaled breath of Lewis lung cancer (LLC) mice. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) was utilized to analyze the exhaled VOCs in LLC mice. A specific group of VOCs was identified as potential biomarkers for monitoring tumor progression. Furthermore, the effects of combined treatment with APS and DDP on the concentration of exhaled VOCs in LLC mice was evaluated. Stoichiometric analysis revealed that the levels of 12 VOCs exhibited substantial recovery following APS treatment. And a high concentration of APS (400 mg/kg), when combined with DDP, exhibited enhanced antitumor efficacy. The metabolic pathways involved in the action of APS include 12 pathways. Our methodology elucidated both the effects and mechanisms of APS on lung cancer, as well as the pharmacological enhancement of cisplatin by APS. These findings facilitate real-time monitoring of lung cancer treatments and contribute to the future development of anticancer therapies.",

The Astragalus and Salvia miltiorrhiza couplet medicines (AS) are commonly employed in DN clinical treatment in China, but their clinical efficacy and potential pharmacological mechanisms are yet to be evaluated. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A meta-analysis of 15 studies involving 1,443 patients was conducted. Furthermore, network pharmacology predicted components and targets, which were verified by molecular docking and in vivo validation. RESULTS: In our meta-analysis, AS notably elevated clinical outcomes and renal function among patients with DN. Meanwhile, when the treatment duration exceeds 12 weeks, AS demonstrated a significant reduction in fasting blood glucose levels, indicating a time-dependent effect. Moreover, based on network pharmacology results, AS likely enhanced clinical outcomes by interacting with vital signaling pathways, including PI3K/Akt, MAPK, and NF-kappa B. Molecular docking studies have confirmed that PTGS2, the key therapeutic target of AS, can be closely combined with bioactive components GLY, quercetin, apigenin, and daidzein. Additionally, in vivo experiments have corroborated that AS can ameliorate renal function, UACR, and biomarkers associated with iron metabolism, such as GPX4, PTGS2, FTH1, and FTL1. CONCLUSION: Through rigorous experimental validation, our study demonstrates AS's significant clinical efficacy in managing DN. Specifically, AS has been shown to enhance renal function, ameliorate renal fibrosis, and positively influence iron metabolism. Despite these promising outcomes, future research with a larger sample size must be conducted to further substantiate these findings.",

The rat model of DN was subjected to a high-sugar and high-fat diet (HSHFD) coupled with streptozotocin (STZ) injection. Our findings revealed that mAPS administration decreased fasting blood glucose (FBG), BUN, SCR, UA, and MDA levels, while elevating serum GSH, GSH-PX, and SOD activities in DN rats (p < 0.05). Furthermore, there was a notable rise in the mRNA and protein expression of renal Nrf-2, GCLC, NQO1, and HO-1 post mAPS treatment (p < 0.05). Additionally, mAPS supplementation led to reduced protein expression of TLR4, NLRP3, p-NF-κB, TGF-β, and Smad4. Concurrently, mAPS exerted a modulatory effect on gut microbiota, as evidenced by the increased abundance of Muribaculaceae, Ruminococcus_1, Phascolarctobacterium, and Lachnoclostridium-related genera. Spearman correlation analysis illustrated a negative association between the abundance of microbiota (Muribaculaceae, Lachnospiraceae_NK4A136, Ruminococcus_1, Clostridiales) and the levels of serum parameters (BUN, CR, UA, TC, TG). In summary, our data robustly attests to the potential of mAPS in modulating oxidative stress, inflammation, and gut microbiota, ultimately resulting in improved renal function in DN rats.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Doxorubicin (DOX) is a powerful chemotherapeutic agent commonly employed in cancer treatment. However, its clinical utility is constrained by dose-dependent cardiotoxicity, which can result in heart failure and sudden cardiac death. The molecular mechanisms of DOX-induced cardiotoxicity (DIC) include oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and the activation of cell death pathways, including ferroptosis. There is an urgent need for effective therapeutic strategies to mitigate DIC. METHODS: This study investigates the cardioprotective effects of Astragalus Polyphenols (ASP), a bioactive compound extracted from Astragalus membranaceus. In the context of DIC, we utilized AC16 and H9C2 cardiomyocytes to establish a DIC model and assessed the effects of ASP on cell viability, oxidative stress, mitochondrial function, and the PI3K/AKT/NRF2 signaling pathway. The expression of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), markers of cardiac injury, was also evaluated. RESULTS: ASP treatment significantly reversed DOX-induced reductions in cell viability and mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) while also decreasing the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Additionally, ASP also downregulated the expression of ANP and BNP, indicating a protective effect on cardiomyocytes. Furthermore, ASP activated the PI3K/AKT/NRF2 pathway, which was suppressed by DOX. Inhibition of this pathway using LY294002 and ML385 abolishes the protective effects of ASP, suggesting that ASP mediates its effects through the PI3K/AKT/NRF2 signaling axis. CONCLUSION: ASP exhibits a protective effect against DOX-induced cardiotoxicity by regulating the PI3K/AKT/NRF2 pathway to reduce oxidative stress and preserve mitochondrial function. These findings suggest that ASP may serve as a potential therapeutic agent to alleviate DIC. Our results provide a novel strategy to protect the heart in patients undergoing DOX chemotherapy.",

While sortilin-related vacuolar protein sorting 10 domain containing receptor 2 (Sorcs2) and laminin subunit alpha 1 (Lama1) have been implicated in neuroinflammatory processes, their roles in regulating microglial activation in RIR are not reported. The current work studied the potential of Sorcs2 and Lama1 as negative regulators of microglial activation in RIR and assessed the therapeutic potential of Astragalus polysaccharide (AP). MATERIAL AND METHODS: Transcriptome profiling was conducted in retinal specimens of RIR group 72 h after RIR induction. Oxygen-glucose deprivation/reperfusion (OGD/R) in rat microglial cells was employed as the cellular induction model of RIR. The functional role of Sorcs2 and Lama1 in dictating microglial activation was investigated in vitro and in vivo using lentivirus-based gene expression. Further, the potential effect of AP on RIR-mediated microglial activation was investigated. RESULTS: Sorcs2 and Lama1 were identified as two downregulated genes in retinal samples following RIR. OGD/R induction triggered pro-inflammatory microglial activation and induced the downregulation of Sorcs2 and Lama1. Sorcs2 or Lama1 overexpression hindered OGD/R-induced microglial activation in vitro and attenuated inflammatory expansion of microglia cells in RIR-induced rat retinal samples. AP treatment was able to neutralize the oxidative stress, promote the expression of Sorcs2 and Lama1, and suppress microglial activation. CONCLUSION: Our findings pinpoint Sorcs2 and Lama1 as negative regulators of microglial activation in RIR. AP could be employed as an antioxidant to attenuate microglial activation and ameliorate the inflammatory damages in RIR."

In traditional Chinese medicine, A. membranaceus and Panax notoginseng are commonly used together for the treatment of wound injury for their significant efficacy. The application of new materials may make A. membranaceus-P. notoginseng (AP) play a better curative effect. In this study, we fabricated a Carboxymethyl chitosan-Sodium alginate hydrogel loaded with the extract of Astragalus membranaceus-P. notoginseng (APCS), which showed favorable stability, biocompatibility, and the ability to rapidly release drugs. Cell culture experiments demonstrated that the APCS hydrogel dramatically increased fibroblast proliferation, migration, and differentiation into myofibroblast. In vivo experiments of wound healing on SD rats showed that APCS hydrogels significantly accelerated skin wound healing, reduced inflammatory response, enhanced the formation of blood vessels, granulation tissues, and collagen fibers, and promoted re-epithelialization at the wound site. Increased expression of catalase, VEGF, and PGP9.5 of wound tissue indicated that APCS hydrogels inhibited oxidative stress and promoted vascular and neuronal regeneration. In summary, the APCS hydrogel displayed great potential as a dressing for achieving satisfactory healing of full-thickness wounds."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: This study evaluated the effects of a novel Astragalus extract (Keyfobell powder [KFB]) composed of Astragalus membranaceus, red ginseng (Panax ginseng C. A. Meyer), and Cervi Parvum Cornu as a potential growth hormone (GH) alternative. The primary focus was placed on its impact on longitudinal bone growth through the upregulation of circulatory insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1. METHODS: We performed in vitro and in vivo experiments using a hypothalamic cell line and Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats. Quantitative RT-PCR was performed to determine growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH) and ghrelin mRNA expressions in GT1-7 cells. The treatment groups were administered KFB at various dosages, and the positive controls received recombinant human GH. Body weight, bone length, and density were assessed, along with serum levels of insulin-like growth factor binding protein (IGFBP)-3 and IGF-1. RESULTS: KFB and somatropin exhibited no cytotoxic effect in GT1-7 cells and increased GHRH and ghrelin mRNA levels in a dose-dependent manner. KFB administration resulted in a significant dose-dependent increase in body weight and bone growth (femur and tibia). Changes in IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 levels were comparable to those observed in the GH-treated group. Based on network pharmacological analysis, multiple compounds in KFB ((20S)-20-hydroxypregn-4-en-3-one, 2-isopropyl-3-methoxypyrazine, caproic acid, daidzein, furfuryl alcohol, lauric acid, octanal, and salicylic acid) may synergistically regulate the PI3K-Akt, Ras, and Rap1 signaling pathways linked to growth control and cartilage formation, leading to a possible increase in height. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that KFB can function as a GH-mimetic agent that promotes bone growth through IGF-1 upregulation.",

Here, we used Astragalus polysaccharide (APS), which has modulatory effects on both the epidermis and the immune system, as an adjuvant drug to reduce EICAR and achieve immune balance. APS, combined with minocycline or epidermal growth factor, was delivered by dissolvable microneedles (MN), a novel drug delivery method that penetrates the stratum corneum to deliver the drug directly into the skin tissue. The results demonstrated that this therapy with the developed MN system not only restored local epidermal conditions, but also reestablished the balance of immune cells. Significantly, the addition of APS also promoted the alleviation of EICAR in non-treated areas, suggesting that local administration can result in systemic effects. The application of APS and the MN delivery system can provide new strategy for clinical treatment of EICAR and potential solutions for other skin diseases.",

      "abstract": "This study investigated, for the first time, the potential role of Astragalus polysaccharide (APS) and APS nanoparticles on testicular blood flow (TBF) and semen quality in Ossimi rams. Fifteen sexually mature Ossimi rams were allocated randomly into two treated groups that orally administered either nano APS (2 g/ram/day; n = 5) or APS (20 g/ram/day; n = 5) for four weeks and a control group (n = 5). The nano-emulsion was prepared by adding corn oil to the APS solution, sonicated, centrifuged at 20,000 rpm, then washed 3-4 times, and vacuum dried overnight at 40 °C. The antioxidant activity of APS and APS nano-emulsion was evaluated in vitro. Blood collection and ultrasonographic assessment of the testes and supratesticular arteries (STAs) were conducted immediately before treatment (W0) and once weekly for 6 successive weeks after APS and nano APS administration (W1-W6). Serum testosterone (T) and estradiol (E2) concentrations were determined by ELISA kits, while nitric oxide (NO) and total antioxidant capacity (TAC) were measured spectrophotometrically. Moreover, semen collection and evaluation of some sperm parameters were performed once a week. Results revealed decreases (P < 0.05) in the Doppler indices (resistive index; RI, pulsatility index; PI, and systolic/diastolic; S/D) of the testicular arteries at most time points of the study in the nano APS and APS groups. Pixel intensity (PIX) and integrated density (IND) of testicular parenchyma were significantly reduced (P ˂ 0.05) in the treated groups compared to the control one. T, E2, NO, and TAC concentrations increased (P < 0.05) in the treated groups compared to the control one. Increases (P < 0.05) were noticed in the mass motility, progressive motility %, live sperm %, and membrane integrity % in nano APS and APS groups, compared to the control. Rams in the nano APS group had significantly higher (P < 0.05) sperm cell concentration than the control one. In conclusion, this study extrapolated that the dietary administration of APS and its nanoparticles can improve TBF, testicular echotexture, sperm characteristics, and the concentration of serum T, E2, NO, and TAC with a more significant effect in the APS nanoparticles compared with APS. So, it could be recommended as a dietary supplementation (2 g/ram/day) for enhancing the reproductive performance of rams.",

      "abstract": "Screening for pulmonary nodules (PN) using low-dose CT has proven effective in reducing lung cancer (LC) mortality. However, current treatments relying on follow-up and surgical excision fail to fully address clinical needs. Pathological angiogenesis plays a pivotal role in supplying oxygen necessary for the progression of PN to LC. The interplay between hypoxia and angiogenesis establishes a vicious cycle, rendering anti-angiogenesis therapy alone insufficient to prevent PN to LC transformation. In traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), PN is referred to as \"Feiji,\" which is mainly attributed to Qi and blood deficiency, correspondingly, the most commonly prescribed medicines are Astragalus membranaceus (Fisch.) Bge. var. mongholicus (Bge.) Hsiao (huang qi) (AR) and Angelica sinensis (Oliv.) Diels (dang gui) (ARS). Modern pharmacological studies have demonstrated that AR and ARS possess immune-enhancing, anti-tumor, anti-inflammatory, and anti-angiogenic properties. However, the precise mechanisms through which AR and ARS exert anti-angiogenic effects to delay PN progression to LC remain inadequately understood. This review explores the critical roles of hypoxia and angiogenesis in the transition from PN to LC. It emphasizes that, compared to therapies targeting angiogenic growth factors alone, AR, ARS, and their compound-based prescriptions offer additional benefits. These include ameliorating hypoxia by restoring blood composition, enhancing vascular structure, accelerating circulation, promoting vascular normalization, and blocking or inhibiting various pro-angiogenic expressions and receptor interactions. Collectively, these actions inhibit angiogenesis and delay the PN-to-LC transformation. Finally, this review summarizes recent advancements in related research, identifies existing limitations and gaps in knowledge, and proposes potential strategies and recommendations to address these challenges.",

      "abstract": "Colorectal cancer, characterized by its high incidence, concealed early symptoms, and poor prognosis at advanced stages, ranks as the third leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Astragalus membranaceus (AM) refers to the dried roots of Astragalus membranaceus (Fisch.) Bge. var. mongholicus (Bge.) Hsiao and Astragalus membranaceus (Fisch.) Bge. In the theory of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), it is believed to have the functions of tonifying qi and lifting yang, as well as generating body fluids and nourishing blood. It can effectively treat cancer caused by the deficiency of vital energy and susceptibility to external diseases. Modern research has confirmed that the active components of AM, including Astragalus polysaccharides, flavonoids (formononetin and calycosin), Astragalus saponins (Astragaloside I and Astragaloside III), and Astragalus nanovesicles, are effective in the treatment of colorectal cancer. The mechanisms mainly involve inducing apoptosis, inhibiting tumor angiogenesis and the metastasis of cancer cells, regulating the cell cycle and tumor microenvironment, and reversing drug resistance. Moreover, it offers a synergistic enhancement when used in combination with chemotherapy, radiotherapy, targeted therapy, or surgical treatment. AM also has great potential in treating colorectal cancer when combined with other herbs. This review summarizes the relevant research findings on the treatment of colorectal cancer with AM, as well as its main pharmacological effects and molecular mechanisms, aiming to provide guidance for the development of new drugs, and offer direction for the conduct of more related research and promoting the development and application of AM.",

      "abstract": "Astragalus mongholicus is a perennial Chinese medicinal herb in the family Leguminosae widely cultivated in China. In September 2023, A. mongholicus plants in a field in Weiyuan County, Gansu Province, showed symptoms of circular or irregular brown, sunken and necrotic lesions, multiple lesions coalesced, and brown longitudinal cracks in the roots. An investigation was performed in a 1998 m2 field with a root rot incidence of 10%, and the severity ranged from 5 to 60% of root surface area. Five rotted root samples were collected. Fragments of symptomatic roots were surface sterilized with 75% ethanol for 10 s, 2% sodium hypochlorite for 2 min, washed three times with sterilized distilled water, and then blotted dry on sterile filter paper. Fragments were placed on potato dextrose agar (PDA) medium and incubated at 25 ± 1°C in darkness for 5 days and five isolates were purified by transferring single hyphal tips to new PDA plates. Isolates WY23AM01 and WY23AM05, two of five isolates with similar morphology, were randomly selected for morphological and molecular identification and pathogenicity tests. Colonies of the fungus were white initially, then turned light brown to brown, raised, and with entire or undulate edges. Sclerotia were brown and produced on PDA after 20 days of incubation at 25 ± 1°C in the dark. Genomic DNA from each of the two isolates was extracted, and the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region was amplified and sequenced with the primer pair ITS5/ITS4 (White et al. 1990). The sequences of isolates WY23AM01 and WY23AM05 were deposited in GenBank (PQ362092 and PQ362093). Phylogenetic analyses were performed by the maximum likelihood method with ITS sequences for anastomosis groups (AG) of Rhizoctonia solani using MEGA 10.0. The phylogenetic tree grouped the two isolates within the R. solani AG-5 clade with high bootstrap support (99%). PCR analysis was performed with 21 primers specifically designed to detect individual anastomosis groups or anastomosis subgroups of R. solani (Carling et al., 2002; Misawa and Kurose, 2019; Misawa et al., 2020; Okubara et al., 2008). Among the 21 specific primer pairs, only AG-5 specific primer amplified the fungal DNA, indicating that the two isolates belonged to the R. solani AG-5. For pathogenicity tests, two isolates were grown individually on sterile wheat kernels at 25 ± 1°C for 10 days. Certified pathogen-free seedling stage roots were grown in the plastic pot filled with the commercially available sterilized horticultural soil and inoculated by burying twenty infested wheat kernels in the soil adjacent to the roots. Control plants were inoculated with sterile wheat kernels using the same procedure. Each pot had three roots, and each treatment had 12 pots as replicates. All plants were placed in a greenhouse with 60% relative humidity and a 12h/12h light/dark photoperiod at 15 to 30°C. Sixty days after inoculation, typical root rot symptoms developed on all inoculated plants, similar to symptoms observed in the field, whereas control plants remained symptomless. The pathogenicity test was performed three times and symptoms were similar to those observed in the field. Finally, fungal isolates were reisolated from the symptomatic roots of all inoculated plants and identified as R. solani AG-5 by molecular analysis as the isolates used for inoculation, thus fulfilling Koch's postulates. To our knowledge, this is the first confirmed report of R. solani AG-5 causing root rot on A. mongholicus in China. Our findings improve knowledge about R. solani AGs occurring in A. mongholicus fields in China and broadens the host range of R. solani AG-5. Due to serious damages caused by this disease in recent years in China, further studies should be conducted to investigate the diversity, prevalence, disease control measures and fungicide sensitivity of AGs distributed in the main A. mongholicus-producing areas in China."

Using transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) and photothrombotic (PTB) mouse models, oral administration of the AM-SB mixture was evaluated during both acute and chronic phases. Results showed that AM-SB significantly reduced infarction volume, inflammation (IL-1β, TNF-α), and pyroptosis-related markers (NLRP3, GSDMD, ASC, Caspase-1), while decreasing gliosis and improving cerebral metabolites. Behavioral assessments revealed that early and sustained AM-SB intervention enhanced motor and cognitive functions, as measured by mNSS, Rotarod, Novel Object Recognition, and Passive Avoidance tests.

      "abstract": "Stroke affects over 12 million people annually, leading to high mortality, long-term disability, and substantial healthcare costs. Although East Asian herbal medicines are widely used for stroke treatment, the pathways of operation they use remain poorly understood. Our study investigates the neuroprotective properties of Astragalus mongholicus (AM) in acute ischemic stroke using photothrombotic (PTB) and transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) mouse models, as well as an in vitro oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) model. Post-OGD treatment with AM improved cell viability in mouse neuroblastoma cells, likely by reducing reactive oxygen species (ROS). Mice received short-term (0-2 days) or long-term (0-27 days) AM treatment post-stroke. Infarct size was assessed using a 2,3,5-triphenyl tetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining procedure alongside magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Neuroprotective metabolites including inositol (Ins), glycerophosphocholine+phosphocholine (GPc+ PCh), N-acetylaspartate+N-acetylaspartylglutamate (NAA+NAAG), creatine + phosphocreatine (Cr+PCr), and glutamine+glutamate (Glx) were analyzed via magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). Gliosis was assessed using GFAP and Iba-1 immunohistochemical markers, while neurological deficits were quantified with modified neurological severity scores (mNSS). Motor and cognitive functions were assessed using cylinder, rotarod, and novel object recognition (NOR) tests. AM treatment significantly reduced ischemic damage and improved neurological outcomes in both acute and chronic stages of PTB and tMCAO models. Additionally, AM increased neuroprotective metabolites levels, reduced gliosis, and decreased oxidative stress, as evidenced by reduced inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). These findings highlight the antioxidant properties of AM and its strong therapeutic potential for promoting recovery after ischemic stroke by alleviating neurological deficits, reducing gliosis, and mitigating oxidative stress.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND AIM: Astragalus membranaceus (AM) is a traditional Chinese herb. Our previous study revealed that AM can enhance neurological function in patients with acute intracerebral hemorrhage. The aim of this study was to investigated the effects of AM on patients with acute aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH). EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE: Eighty-eight patients experiencing acute aSAH were randomly allocated to either the treatment group (TG) comprising 44 patients, who received 3 g of AM orally thrice daily for 14 days, or the control group (CG) with 44 patients, who received 3 g of a placebo. RESULTS: Eighty-three patients (41 in CG and 42 in TG) completed the trial. Stratified analyses revealed serum interleukin-6 (IL-6) median ≥7.28 pg/mL at baseline. The percentage of good GOS scores (GOS 4 or 5) at two weeks (W2) and four weeks (W4) was significantly higher in TG than in CG (W2: 35.3 % vs. 7.7 %, p = 0.042; W4: 62.5 % vs. 30.8 %, p = 0.044). Moreover, a higher percentage of Barthel index scores (>60) was observed in TG than in CG at W2 (35.3 % vs. 7.7 %, p = 0.042) after AM or placebo administration. CONCLUSION: Administering AM for 14 days has shown potential in enhancing neurological function four weeks post-aSAH onset, especially in patients with a serum IL-6 level median ≥7.28 pg/mL. Therefore, further research is warranted to explore the anti-inflammatory role of AM. However, this study's limitations include a small sample size and the single-center design, signifying its status as a preliminary investigation."

      "abstract": "Acute pancreatitis (AP) is a severe digestive disorder, worsened by a high-fat diet (HFD) through inflammation and gut microbiota disruption. Astragalus polysaccharides (APS), known for their anti-inflammatory properties, may alleviate HFD-induced exacerbation of AP by modulating gut microbiota. This study investigates the effect of APS on AP severity under a HFD (HAP). Results show that HFD significantly worsens AP, with elevated serum enzymes, pro-inflammatory cytokines, and pancreatic damage. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed increased ICAM1+ neutrophils and activation of the NF-κB/necroptosis pathway in HAP mice. Treatment with APS reduced neutrophil infiltration, downregulated NF-κB, and suppressed necroptosis. APS also restored gut microbiota balance, boosting Lactobacillus reuteri (L. reuteri) and propionate (PA) levels. Interventions with L. reuteri or PA reduced HAP severity, with combined treatment showing synergistic effects. These findings suggest that the protective effect of APS is mediated by microbiota-dependent mechanisms, highlighting the gut-pancreas axis as a potential therapeutic target for AP.",

METHODS: Eighteen male C57BL/6J mice of specific pathogen-free (SPF) grade, aged 8 weeks, were selected and divided into three groups: a control group (0.9% saline gavage for 16 weeks), a D-gal group (subcutaneous injection of 200 mg/kg D-galactose in the upper neck region, once daily for 8 weeks), and a D-gal + APS group (subcutaneous injection of 200 mg/kg D-galactose, once daily for 8 weeks, with concurrent administration of 100 mg/kg APS by gavage for 8 weeks). Body composition of the mice was assessed using the ImpediVET Laboratory Composition Measurement Analyzer. The pathological structure of the skeletal muscles was examined using hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining, and the microstructure and mitochondrial alterations in skeletal muscle were observed under transmission electron microscopy. Protein expression levels of LC3II and PINK1 in skeletal muscle tissues were analyzed using Western blotting analysis. RESULTS: Compared to the control group, the D-gal-treated mice demonstrated substantial declines in grip strength, the cross-sectional area (CSA) of gastrocnemius muscle fibers, gastrocnemius weight, and the gastrocnemius weight-to-body weight ratio. APS administration markedly improved these parameters in the D-gal-treated mice. H&E staining showed muscle atrophy and senescence in the D-gal-treated mice, accompanied by deformed muscle cell morphology, which was mitigated by APS gavage. The D-gal-treated mice displayed swelling, cristae fracture, lysis, or complete loss, alongside reduced autophagy and increased lengths of bright bands, myofibrillar myonules, and H bands. However, administration of APS alleviated mitochondrial damage, promoted mitophagy, and reduced the lengths of these muscle tissue bands. Additionally, D-gal treatment significantly reduced LC3II and PINK1 protein expression in muscle tissues, while APS treatment notably elevated their expression levels. CONCLUSION: APS gavage ameliorates the structural and functional impairments in muscle tissues of the D-gal-treated mice by promoting mitochondrial autophagy."

      "abstract": "This study primarily investigated the mechanism of Astragalus polysaccharides(APS), a Chinese medicinal material, in regulating the Nrf2/SLC7A11/GPX4 signaling pathway to induce ferroptosis in ovarian cancer cells(Caov-3 and SKOV3 cells). Caov-3 and SKOV3 cells were divided into control(Vehicle) group, APS group, glutathione peroxidase 4 inhibitor(RSL3) group, and APS+RSL3 group. After 48 h of intervention, the activity and morphology of the cells in each group were observed. The cell counting kit-8(CCK-8) method was used to determine the half-maximal inhibitory concentration(IC_(50)), while colony formation and EdU assays were conducted to assess cell proliferation. Biochemical reagents were used to detect lipid reactive oxygen species(L-ROS), malondialdehyde(MDA), divalent iron ions(Fe~(2+)), and glutathione(GSH) in Caov-3 cells. Transmission electron microscopy was employed to observe the morphological changes of mitochondria in Caov-3 cells. Bioinformatics analysis were used to screen potential target genes of APS in ovarian cancer cells. Western blot and RT-PCR were applied to measure the protein and mRNA expression of Nrf2, SLC7A11, and GPX4. The results revealed that APS effectively inhibited the activity and proliferation of ovarian cancer cells, significantly increased the expression levels of L-ROS, MDA, and Fe~(2+)(P&lt;0.001), and significantly reduced the expression level of GSH(P&lt;0.001). Under electron microscopy, the mitochondria of Caov-3 cells appeared significantly smaller, with a marked increase in the density of the bilayer membrane, disappearance of mitochondrial cristae, and rupture of the outer mitochondrial membrane. These effects were more pronounced when APS was combined with RSL3. Bioinformatics screening identified Nrf2, SLC7A11, and GPX4 as potential target genes for APS in ovarian cancer cells. APS was shown to reduce the protein and mRNA expression of Nrf2, SLC7A11, and GPX4(P&lt;0.01), with the APS+RSL3 showing even more significant effects(P&lt;0.001). In conclusion, APS can induce ferroptosis in ovarian cancer cells, and its mechanism may be related to the regulation of the Nrf2/SLC7A11/GPX4 signaling pathway, providing an experimental basis for the use of APS injections in the treatment of ovarian cancer.",

      "abstract": "Astragalus membranaceus (AM) herb is a component of traditional Chinese medicine used to treat various cancers. Herein, we demonstrate a strong anti-leukemic effect of AM injected (Ai) into the mouse model of erythroleukemia induced by Friend virus. Chemical analysis combined with mass spectrometry of AM/Ai identified the compounds Betulinic acid, Kaempferol, Hederagenin, and formononetin, all major mediators of leukemia inhibition in culture and in vivo. Docking analysis demonstrated binding of these four compounds to FLI1, resulting in downregulation of its targets, induction of apoptosis, differentiation, and suppression of cell proliferation. Chemical composition analysis identified other compounds previously known having anti-tumor activity independent of the FLI1 blockade. Among these, Astragaloside-A (As-A) has marginal effect on cells in culture, but strongly inhibits leukemogenesis in vivo, likely through improvement of anti-tumor immunity. Indeed, both IDO1 and TDO2 were identified as targets of As-A, leading to suppression of tryptophane-mediated Kyn production and leukemia suppression. Moreover, As-A interacts with histamine decarboxylase (HDC), leading to suppression of anti-inflammatory genes TNF, IL1B/IL1A, TNFAIP3, and CXCR2, but not IL6. These results implicate HDC as a novel immune checkpoint mediator, induced in the tumor microenvironment to promote leukemia. Functional analysis of AM components may allow development of combination therapy with optimal anti-leukemia effect.",

The purpose of this systematic review was to evaluate the effectiveness of Astragalus injection in the treatment of viral myocarditis. METHODS: English databases such as PubMed, Cochrane Library, and EMBASE, and Chinese databases of Sino Med, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), the VIP Information Resource Integration Service Platform, and Wanfang Data Information Site, were searched from their inception until May 1, 2024. The outcome measures of this study included the effectiveness rate, creatine kinase (CK), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), creatine kinase Isoenzyme (CK-MB), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), cardiac troponin I (cTnI), and electrocardiogram (ECG). RESULTS: Twenty-six studies were included in this analysis, comprising a total of 2793 patients. Meta-analyses indicated that, compared to standard treatment alone, the Astragalus injection group demonstrated significant advantages, achieving an effectiveness rate of 92.79% (1094 cases). In contrast, the control group, which included 1108 cases, had an effectiveness rate of 77.71% (861 cases). Additionally, the Astragalus injection group exhibited the following benefits for patients affected by viral myocarditis: decreasing ∆AST [weighted mean difference (WMD) = - 14.23, 95% confidence interval (CI) (- 24.17, - 4.30), P < 0.05]; ∆CK [weighted mean difference (WMD) = - 34.84, 95% confidence interval (CI) (- 48.03, - 21.65), P < 0.05], lowering ∆CK-MB [WMD = - 7.64, 95% CI (- 9.30, - 5.99), P < 0.001], ∆cTnl [WMD = - 0.18, 95% CI (- 0.27, - 0.10), P < 0.001], ∆LDH [WMD = -41.93, 95% CI (- 55.97, - 27.90), P < 0.05], and ∆cTnI [WMD = - 0.18, 95% CI (- 0.28, - 0.08), P < 0.05]. CONCLUSION: Astragalus injection may have a therapeutic effect in patients with viral myocarditis by reducing levels of AST, CK, CK-MB, LDH, and cTnI, improving ECG results, and increasing the overall effectiveness rate for those affected by this condition.

However, little is known about the effects of dietary APS on vaccine potency in fish. In the present study, large yellow croakers (Larimichthys crocea) were injected with formalin-inactivated Pseudomonas plecoglossicida after APS feeding for 14 d and then challenged by live P. plecoglossicida on 28 d post-vaccination. The results showed that dietary APS combined with inactivated vaccine could improve the survival rate, and alleviate splenic lesions and bacteria load post-challenge, thus exhibiting a better protection in large yellow croaker against P. plecoglossicida infection than inactivated vaccine treatment alone. Fish in APS + P. plecoglossicida vaccine group expressed a better antioxidant status by possessing a relatively higher serum total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity and a significantly lower malondialdehyde (MDA) content than those in vaccine alone group. Serum lysozyme (LZM) and alkaline phosphatase (AKP) activities, and immunoglobulin M (IgM) titers were all improved in fish of APS + P. plecoglossicida vaccine group compared to fish in vaccine group. Furthermore, fish in APS + P. plecoglossicida vaccine group showed a lower down-regulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and IL-6, and a higher up-regulation of anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10, immunoglobulin (IgM) and T cell immunity-related cytokines, interferon-γ (IFN-γ), IL-4/13A, and IL-4/13B, when compared with those in fish of vaccine group. These results suggested that dietary APS could assist inactivated vaccine to trigger stronger innate and adaptive immune responses against P. plecoglossicida infection. These findings further uncover the immunoregulatory mechanism of dietary APS, and provide valuable information for prevention and control of bacteriosis in fish.",

      "abstract": "Objective: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a global health concern, and recent clinical evidence suggests the potential of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) to slow CKD progression. This offers alternative strategies for CKD patients, mitigating risks related to polypharmacy and adverse drug reactions. Our self-controlled, prospective study aims to assess the impact of Eefooton (EFT), a TCM-based regimen, on kidney health in stage 3-5 CKD patients. Additionally, we conduct a cell culture study to explore the potential mechanisms of EFT in protecting renal function. Materials and methods: Between 2021 and 2022, 75 stage 3-5 CKD patients (56% males; mean age 68.20y) at Kaohsiung Veterans General Hospital and Wu San-Chiang Medical Clinic received six months of EFT treatment alongside conventional CKD medications. The primary outcome assessed was the change in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) at 6 months, with secondary outcomes including kidney size and blood biomarker changes. Adverse events were monitored. In an in vitro study, EFT effects on HK-2 cell viability and clonogenicity, as well as analysis of apoptosis and fibrosis-related proteins through Western blot, were investigated. Results: Median eGFR significantly improved from 34.37 ± 13.58 to 42.47 ± 18.82 mL/min/1.73 m2 (p < 0.001) at month 6 post-treatment. Notably, improvements were observed across different baseline CKD stages (stage 3: p < 0.001, stage 4: p = 0.037). Ultrasonography scans indicated a slight increase in mean kidney size. In vitro, EFT enhanced HK-2 cell viability and increased clonogenicity. Indoxyl sulfate exposure raised cleaved and total PARP-1 activity. Co-treatment with EFT and IS reduced cleaved PARP-1 activity. EFT decreased IS-induced expression of fibrosis-related proteins (α-smooth muscle actin) without affecting apoptosis-related proteins (Caspase 3). Conclusions: When combined with conventional CKD medications, EFT has shown effectiveness in enhancing kidney function in individuals with stage 3-5 CKD, with no reported safety concerns. The PARP-1 inhibition and anti-fibrosis properties of EFT present potential benefits in the context of CKD.",

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: This study aimed to examine the impact of APS on acute kidney injury induced by rhabdomyolysis (RIAKI), exploring its association with macrophage M1 polarization and elucidating the underlying mechanisms. METHODS: C57BL/6J mice were randomly assigned to one of three groups: a normal control group, a RIAKI model group, and an APS treatment group. Techniques such as flow cytometry and immunofluorescence were employed to demonstrate that APS can inhibit the transition of renal macrophages to the M1 phenotype in RIAKI. Furthermore, the raw264.7 macrophage cell line was chosen and induced into the M1 phenotype to further examine the impact of APS on this model and elucidate the underlying mechanism. RESULTS: Administration of APS led to a significant decrease in UREA levels by 25.2% and CREA levels by 60.9% within the model group. Also, APS exhibited an inhibitory effect on the infiltration of M1 macrophages and the cGAS-STING pathway in kidneys within the RIAKI, subsequently leading to decreased serum concentrations of IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α by 44.5%, 12.9%, and 10.3%, respectively, consistent with the results of in vitro experiments. Furthermore, APS exhibited an anti-apoptotic effect on MPC5 cells when co-cultured with M1 macrophages. CONCLUSION: Astragalus polysaccharide (APS) potentially mitigated rhabdomyolysis-induced renal damage by impeding the M1 polarization of macrophages. This inherent mechanism might involve the suppression of the cGAS-STING pathway activation within macrophages. Furthermore, APS could endow protective effects on podocytes through the inhibition of apoptosis."

Here, we designed a novel astragalus polysaccharide vector (PDA), encapsulating podophyllotoxin (PPT), and modifying methotrexate (DSPE-PEG2000-MTX) on its surface for targeting ovarian cancer cells with high folate receptor expression. We prepared novel MTX-modified PPT-loaded astragalus polysaccharide micelles (MTX-PPT-micelles) by dialysis method and evaluated their characterization, stability, safety and targeting ability. EDU proliferation, apoptosis, wound healing, and macrophage polarization experiments were performed, and a mouse ectopic tumor model and a lung metastasis model were established to evaluate the antitumor effects of MTX-PPT-micelles. The prepared MTX-PPT-micelles had appropriate particle size, good stability and safety, and were able to achieve slow drug release. In vitro and in vivo experiments showed that MTX-PPT-micelles significantly enhanced tumor uptake and apoptosis, and significantly inhibited tumor proliferation, invasion and metastasis processes. In addition, MTX-PPT-micelles could improve tumor immunosuppression by shifting tumor-associated macrophages from M2 to M1 phenotype. In conclusion, this study successfully constructed a novel nano-delivery system to achieve targeted therapy for ovarian cancer by combating tumor cells with immunomodulatory effects on tumor-associated macrophages.",

The heavily oxidative environment of cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury (CI/RI) promotes activation of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1), which initiates parthanatos, a regulated cell death mode. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) bursting in mitochondrial respiratory chain complex I (Complex I) is a key cause of CI/RI. Nevertheless, the intrinsic mechanism of its involvement in Complex I in the parthanatos cascade remains obscure. AIM OF THE STUDY: This experiment aimed to investigate that HQ-HH antagonized parthanatos via regulating PARP-1/TAX1BP1-mediated Complex I to attenuate CI/RI. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The HPLC fingerprint of HQ-HH was established, and the contents of 9 components were determined. The neuroprotective effect of HQ-HH in CI/RI was evaluated by rat middle cerebral artery occlusion/reperfusion (MCAO/R) and BV2 cell oxygen glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R) models. Pathological changes in brain tissue of MCAO/R rats were observed using TTC staining, HE staining, and TEM. Complex I activity was measured in MCAO/R rats and OGD/R-treated BV2 cells. qRT-PCR and Western blot were performed to detect the expressions of related genes and proteins of parthanatos and Complex I as well as tax1 binding protein 1 (TAX1BP1). Immunofluorescence staining was employed to certify the nuclear translocation of apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) in MCAO/R rats. RESULTS: The HPLC fingerprint of HQ-HH with 25 common peaks and the contents of 9 components were obtained. HQ-HH improved behavioral function and alleviated cerebral infarction in MCAO/R rats in a dose-dependent manner. HQ-HH alleviated parthanatos and exhibited the same repressive effect on PARP-1 transcription and translation as PJ34 (PARP-1 inhibitor). Moreover, the migration of TAX1BP1 to the mitochondria was restrained with HQ-HH treatment as a downstream of PARP-1, resulting in the inhibition of Complex I activity and less ROS production, accompanied by a decrease in mRNA and protein levels of ND1 and ND2. Subsequently, the nuclear translocation of AIF and the generation of poly(ADP-ribose) (PAR) polymers were suppressed. CONCLUSIONS: HQ-HH mitigated CI/RI by regulating PARP-1/TAX1BP1 to inhibit the Complex I activity with less ROS production, further impeding nuclear translocation of AIF, and ultimately antagonizing parthanatos. By emphasizing the link between parthanatos and Complex I, we anticipate providing new empirical evidence for HQ-HH therapy of IS.",

      "abstract": "Due to the unavoidable impact of ionizing radiation on the heart located near the mediastinum, varying degrees of myocardial damage may occur. As a result, the clinical application of radiotherapy in cancer treatment is significantly limited. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying radiation-induced heart disease (RIHD) are not yet fully understood, and there is a lack of disease-specific treatment strategies. Astragalus polysaccharide (APS), is an active compound abundant in the traditional Chinese herb Astragalus membranaceus (Fisch.) Bunge (AS), has been shown to have cardioprotective effects against various cardiovascular diseases. Thus, this study aims to investigate the potential cardioprotective effect of APS on RIHD and its underlying molecular mechanisms. The network pharmacology results indicated that 9 core genes were identified from the biological network of the effective components of AS acting on RIHD. The results of GO enrichment analysis showed that these hub genes were mainly involved in biological processes such as cell apoptosis, cell proliferation, inflammatory response, and response to external stimuli. The results of KEGG enrichment analysis showed that these hub genes mainly regulated the occurrence of RIHD through pathways such as the EGFR signaling pathway, PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, IL-17 signaling pathway, and so on. In molecular docking analysis, we found that AKT1 and mTOR had good and stable binding abilities with the three types of glucosides rich in AS. The results of in vitro and in vivo experiments all showed that APS could not only improve cardiac dysfunction, myocardial injury, inflammatory response, and myocardial fibrosis in RIHD rats, but also alleviated apoptosis and atrophy of H9C2 cells under ionizing radiation stimulation. In addition, we also found that APS improved the accumulation of autophagic flux induced by ionizing radiation, which could be confirmed by the reversal of Beclin1, p62, LC3B proteins and accelerated degradation of accumulated autophagic vesicles. Rapamycin (Rap) was a classic autophagy flux inducer that could attenuate the improvement effect of APS on H9C2 cell apoptosis under ionizing radiation stimulation. Finally, we found that APS could reverse the inhibition of PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway activity by ionizing radiation in vitro, thereby improving ionizing radiation-induced autophagy flux accumulation, cardiomyocyte apoptosis, and atrophy. All in all, this study provides important evidence for understanding the molecular mechanisms of the cross-talk between autophagy and apoptosis, and provides new directions and insights for APS combined with autophagy regulators as a therapeutic strategy for RIHD.",

However, their efficacy in alleviating mammary inflammation and oxidative stress and protecting the blood-milk barrier (BMB) compromised by Staphylococcus aureus (S. au) infection remains uncertain. As evidence for the gut-mammary axis grows, identifying natural prebiotic components that affect this axis is crucial. This study reveals that Astragalus polysaccharide (APS), the primary active constituent of Astragalus, effectively mitigates S. au infection in murine mammary glands, suppresses inflammatory responses, reduces oxidative stress, and restores BMB integrity. The involvement of APS in modulating gut microbiota was substantiated through gut microbial depletion experiments and fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT). Notably, APS uniquely enriched Ruminococcus bromii (R. bromii) in the gut, facilitating the metabolism of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), particularly acetate and butyrate, which are pivotal to APS's protective effects. Collectively, these results propose a novel therapeutic approach for the treatment and prevention of S. au-induced mastitis, leveraging APS and R. bromii as prebiotics and probiotics, respectively.",

However, the mechanism and causal relationship between the gut microbiota and Astragalus polysaccharides (APS) treatment of UC are unclear. The results of the present study showed that APS ameliorated colonic injury and the disruption of the gut microbiota and restored intestinal immune homeostasis in mice with DSS-induced colitis. Meanwhile, we found that APS treatment was ineffective in antibiotic-treated colitis mice but was effective when FMT (Fecal microbiota transplantation) was performed on UC mice using APS-treated mice as donors. APS increased the proportion of relevant microbiota that produce SCFAs and both direct administration of APS and administration of APS-adjusted gut microbiota significantly promoted the production of SCFAs in colitis mice. We demonstrated that APS dually inhibited NF-κB activation via the TLR4 and HDAC3 pathways and improved the balance in Th17/Treg cells in UC mice. In conclusion, our study revealed that APS is a promising prebiotic agent for the maintenance of intestinal health and demonstrated that APS may ameliorate colitis in a gut microbiota-dependent manner.",

For this purpose, a total of 36 BALB/c female mice were selected and randomly classified into the following groups: i) The normal control group sensitized with phosphate-buffered saline; ii) the asthma group sensitized and challenged with ovalbumin (OVA); iii) the OVA + APS (2.5 g/kg) treatment group; iv) the OVA + APS (5.0 g/kg) treatment group; v) the OVA + APS (10 g/kg) treatment group; and vi) the OVA + dexamethasone (2 mg/kg) treatment group, with 6 mice in each group. OVA was used to establish the mouse model of asthma. In the APS group, the asthmatic mice were intragastrically administered APS at various doses at 1 h prior to each OVA stimulation. The airway hyperreactivity (AHR) was measured, and hematoxylin and eosin staining was employed to evaluate pulmonary inflammatory infiltration. In addition, 16S rRNA sequencing and ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry were used to detect the changes in the mouse gut microbiota and serum metabolites. The results revealed that compared with the asthma model group, APS improved airway inflammation and eosinophil infiltration in asthmatic mice. In asthmatic mice, the gut microbial imbalance mainly manifested as a low abundance of Bacteroidetes and a high abundance of Firmicutes, yielding an increased F/B ratio. In the high-dose APS group, the abundance of Firmicutes was reduced, and the abundance of Bacteroidetes was increased, which thereby decreased the F/B ratio and corrected the gut microbial imbalance. Through blood metabolomics, 145 and 105 significantly differential metabolites were detected in the medium- and high-dose APS groups, respectively. Moreover, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway enrichment analysis demonstrated that the metabolic pathways in the medium-dose APS group included the biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids and the biosynthesis of arginine. On the other hand, the metabolic pathways enriched in high-dose APS group were the biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids, and pyrimidine metabolism. On the whole, the present study demonstrates that APS may regulate the gut microbiota and the metabolites to improve airway inflammation and AHR in asthmatic mice."

It has been found that a variety of Chinese medicine polysaccharides can regulate gut microbiota, especially probiotics, and have beneficial effects on human health. Astragalus polysaccharide (APS) is a major component of Astragalus aceus. The aim of this study was to investigate whether APS can regulate gut microbiota-SCFAs to slow the progression of CKD. Adenine-induced CKD mice (Ade) were established and APS was treated. The renal protection of APS on CKD mice was evaluated by renal function and pathological staining of renal tissues. Feces samples were collected for 16SrRNA sequence and LC-MS/MS analysis. Kidney G protein-coupled receptor (GPR) levels were also detected in renal tissue. APS supplementation can reduce serum creatinine and urea nitrogen levels in mice model (Ade) and attenuate renal tubular interstitial injury and renal fibrosis. Further application of 16SrRNA sequencing showed that the abundance of SCFA producing bacteria, such as Kineothrix, Faecalibaculum, Akkermansia, Lactobacillus, and Roseburia, was upregulated after APS treatment. Fecal LC-MS/MS detection showed that the levels of acetate, propionate and butyrate in Ade mice increased after APS supplementation. The detection of renal GPRs showed that APS supplementing could significantly increase the levels of renal GPR41 and GPR43, and also partially increase the levels of GPR109a in Ade mice. Our research confirms that APS supplementation can upregulate the abundance of SCFA producing bacteria and increase SCFA levels to attenuate renal tubular interstitial injury and fibrosis via GPRs.",

In nature, drought tolerance also depends on the ability to compensate after water restoration. Dark septate endophytes (DSEs) are believed to enhance plant tolerance in drought environments. However, the compensatory mechanisms of DSEs for rehydration after drought stress have not been reported. To assess the drought tolerance and compensatory capacity of DSEs, the following DSEs were investigated in this study using solid-liquid screening and potting tests under different drought gradients, rehydration conditions, and field water-holding capacities: Stagonosporopsis lupini, Microsphaeropsis cytisi, Macrophomina pseudophaseolina, Paraphoma radicina, Alternaria alstroemeriae, Alternaria tellustris, and Papulaspora equi. The results showed that M. pseudophaseolina reached the maximum diameter for plate growth in only 4 d. In a liquid shaker, the biomass of S. lupini peaked after rehydration. The Mantel heatmap indicated that lipid metabolites were significantly expressed in M. pseudophaseolina and S. lupini under drought stress. Correlations between drought tolerance indexes and amino acid metabolites increased dramatically in both DSEs after rehydration. Moreover, in rehydration after drought, the treatments inoculated with M. pseudophaseolina and S. lupini showed significant increases in root weight of 20.36% and 23.82%, respectively, compared with the uninoculated treatment."

Astragalus polysaccharide (APS), a pure Chinese medicine preparation primarily made from the traditional Chinese herb Astragalus, plays a positive role in the treatment of many malignant tumors. AIM: To explore the recent efficacy of APS combined with gemcitabine plus tegafur gimeracil oteracil potassium capsule (S-1) (GS) regimen in the treatment of pancreatic cancer and assess its effect on the immune function and long-term survival of patients. METHODS: A total of 97 patients who were diagnosed with pancreatic cancer and received GS chemotherapy at The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang Chinese Medical University (Zhejiang Provincial Hospital of Chinese Medicine) from March 2021 to December 2021 were included in the retrospective analysis. Among them, 41 patients received APS combined with GS chemotherapy, and 56 patients received GS chemotherapy only. The recent efficacy, immune function, adverse reactions, and long-term survival were compared among these patients. RESULTS: After 4 cycles of treatment, the objective response rate of patients receiving the combined therapy of APS and GS was 51.22%, and the disease control rate (DCR) was 56.10%, higher than those of patients receiving the monotherapy with GS alone (30.36% and 35.71%, respectively). Besides, the percentages of CD3+ T cells (50.18% ± 9.57%) and CD4+ T cells (31.52% ± 5.33%) in the peripheral blood of patients receiving the combined therapy of APS and GS were higher compared with those treated with GS regimen alone [(44.06% ± 8.55%) and (26.01% ± 7.83%), respectively]. Additionally, the incidences of leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and fatigue in patients receiving the combined therapy of APS and GS were significantly lower than those in patients receiving the monotherapy of GS alone (17.07%, 9.76%, 31.71% vs 37.50%, 28.57%, 60.71%). Moreover, the median survival time of patients receiving the combined therapy of APS and GS was 394 days, significantly longer than that of patients receiving the monotherapy of GS alone (339 days) (hazard ratio: 0.66; 95%CI: 0.45-0.99; P = 0.036). All these differences were statistically significant (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The combined therapy of APS and GS improved the recent efficacy and long-term survival of patients with pancreatic cancer and alleviated chemotherapy-induced immune suppression and adverse reactions."

Astragalus polysaccharide (APS) is the main active ingredient of Astragalus membranaceus and has a wide range of pharmacological activities. Here, we aimed to explore the impacts of APS on cerebral I/R injury and its specific mechanisms. We established a cerebral I/R injury model using middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO)-treated rats and oxygen glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R)-treated BV2 cells. The interleukin 1β (IL-1β), interleukin 6 (IL-6) and interleukin (IL-10) levels were determined using corresponding ELISA kits and RT‒qPCR. The levels of M1 microglial markers (INOS and CD16) and M2 microglial markers (Arg-1 and CD206) were measured by RT‒qPCR. The O-linked N-acetylglucosamine modification (O-GlcNAcylation), O-GlcNAc transfer (OGT) and O-GlcNAc glycosidase (OGA) protein levels were measured by Western blot. Our results showed that APS treatment decreased IL-1β (179.72 ± 9.08 vs. 81.33 ± 6.30) and IL-6 (445.56 ± 33.09 vs. 234.75 ± 27.62) levels and increased IL-10 (41.95 ± 4.18 vs. 86.40 ± 7.16) levels in OGD/R-treated BV2 cells (p < 0.001). In addition, APS promoted the M2 polarization of OGD/R-treated BV2 cells, manifested by an increase in Arg-1 (0.43 ± 0.04 vs. 0.76 ± 0.03) and CD206 (0.36 ± 0.03 vs. 0.65 ± 0.06) and a decrease in INOS (2.84 ± 0.39 vs. 1.56 ± 0.19) and CD16 (4.04 ± 0.36 vs. 1.88 ± 0.09) in OGD/R-treated BV2 cells (p < 0.001). Additionally, APS treatment increased the O-GlcNAcylation and OGT levels in OGD/R-treated BV2 cells, while OGT knockdown reversed the effect of APS in OGD/R-treated BV2 cells and MCAO-treated rats (p < 0.05). Our study demonstrated that APS alleviated cerebral I/R injury by promoting the M2 polarization of microglia by enhancing OGT-mediated O-GlcNAcylation.",

An in vivo T2DM rat model was established via streptozotocin (STZ) injection and treated with metformin and varying doses of APS for 12 weeks. Histological changes in retinal cells were assessed using H&E and PAS staining. The expression levels of AQP1, Gli1, and SHH in the retina were measured using immunohistochemistry, Western blotting, immunofluorescence, and ELISA. Additionally, mRNA expression of AQP1, Gli1, and SHH was quantified by RT-qPCR. Bioinformatic analyses indicated that Gli1 and AQP1, key components of the SHH-Gli1- AQP1 signaling pathway, may be associated with T2DM. Subsequent experiments demonstrated that the STZ-induced T2DM rats exhibited significant retinal damage, which was notably mitigated by both APS and metformin treatments. Furthermore, the SHH-Gli1-AQP1 signaling pathway was found to be overactivated in STZ-induced T2DM rats. Treatment with APS and metformin significantly reduced the elevated expression levels of SHH, Gli1, and AQP1. APS effectively inhibits retinal damage of STZ-induced T2DM rats by restraining the SHH-Gli1-AQP1 signaling pathway."

      "abstract": "Astragalus is a widespread genus comprising approximately 3500 species, both annual and perennial, found across Asia, Europe, Africa, and the Americas. In Turkey, it is represented by 63 sections and 485 taxa with a high endemism ratio (51%). In traditional medicine, the roots of various Astragalus species represent very old and well-known drugs used for antiperspirant, diuretic, and tonic purposes, as well as for the treatment of nephritis, diabetes, leukemia, and uterine cancer. The genus Astragalus is the richest source of cycloartane-type compounds, which display a diverse range of bioactivities, such as wound healing, immunomodulatory, antitumor, hepatoprotective, antimutagenic, antiviral, and antiprotozoal activities. Moreover, cycloastragenol, the main sapogenol of many cycloartane-type glycosides found in the Astragalus genus, has gained attention as a potent telomerase activator over the past decade. The preparation of cycloastragenol derivatives could be significant in the near future due to their unique bioactivity. This review covers the botanical aspects of Astragalus L., as well as the phytochemical and biological activity studies conducted on Turkish Astragalus species, with a special focus on cycloartenols. It contains 36 articles reporting the phytochemistry of 29 Astragalus species and 111 new compounds, including 104 triterpene saponins. In addition to the phytochemical studies, this review summarizes the biotransformation studies on Astragalus cycloartanes via endophytic fungi isolated from the tissues of Astragalus species.",

      "abstract": "Chronic stress affects intestinal microbiota. Astragaloside IV (AS), called super Astragalus polysaccharide, is a monomer component of traditional herbs Astragalus membranaceus which belongs to medicinal food homology (MFH), exerts a neuroprotection effect, but the underlying mechanism has not yet been elucidated. Intestinal flora is also involved in the biotransformation of the active ingredients of MFH species, thus affecting their physiological and pharmacological properties. In this study, we found that AS improved CUMS-induced cognitive impairment, inhibited neuroinflammation, and restored intestinal barrier damage, but the improvement was suppressed by the elimination of gut microbiota, suggesting a key regulatory role for the microbiota. The results of 16S rDNA sequencing showed that AS treatment significantly increased the relative abundance of Lactobacillus reuteri (L. reuteri) and Bacteroides acidifaciens. Furthermore, supplementation of L. reuteri rather than Lactobacillus plantarum restored the effect of AS-supplied dysbiosis mice via inhibition of inflammatory repose and the maintenance of the intestinal epithelial barrier, indicating that dietary AS requires L. reuteri to ameliorate cognitive injury. These findings provide evidence for new therapeutic strategies to treat chronic stress and support the role of specific bacteria in the intestinal environment that metabolizes the AS.",

      "abstract": "ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Formononetin (FMN), one of the main isoflavones isolated from Astragalus membranaceus (Fisch.) Bunge, has multiple pharmacological and renal-protective effects. Our previous study suggested FMN as a candidate compound for the treatment of chronic renal failure (CRF). However, the mechanism underlying the repressive effect of FMN on the development of CRF is still unknown. AIMS OF THE STUDY: To investigate the protective effect of FMN on CRF using in vivo and in vitro models and elucidate the potential underlying mechanism. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An in vivo model of adenine-induced CRF and an in vitro model of human proximal tubule epithelial cells (HK-2) stimulated with transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1 were used. Serum levels of renal function parameters and inflammatory cytokines were evaluated. Histological analysis was performed to determine the extent of renal injury and fibrosis. Network pharmacology and mRNA sequencing were used to explore the potential mechanism. PPI analysis and molecular docking were used to identify key targets. Polymerase chain reaction and western blotting were used to determine the mechanism underlying the effect of FMN on CRF. RESULTS: FMN decreased the levels of renal function biochemical markers, including serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, and 24 h urine protein content. Treatment with FMN improved renal tubule injury and extracellular matrix (ECM) components, including collagens I and III. In addition, FMN significantly inhibited epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT); decreased the expression of fibronectin, N-cadherin, vimentin, α-SMA, and TGF-β1; and restored the expression of E-cadherin. The effect of FMN on renal interstitial fibrosis contributed to decreasing the expression of PI3K, p-Akt, and interleukin (IL) 4, restoring the expression of nitric oxide synthase 3 (NOS3), and reducing the release of inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha), both in vivo and in vitro. FMN treatment improved renal function and deposition of ECM components, reduced protein levels of EMT markers in rat kidneys and HK-2 cells, decreased the release of inflammatory cytokines, and inhibited the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. CONCLUSIONS: FMN treatment significantly reduced the release of inflammatory cytokines and inhibited the effects of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway on the key targets IL-4 and NOS3. Our results suggest FMN therapy as a novel therapeutic strategy for treating CRF.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Astragalus membranaceus has shown positive clinical efficacy in treating colorectal cancer (CRC). OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to identify the key active components of Astragalus and determine effective targets of these components in CRC patients. METHODS: We identified active components of Astragalus membranaceus and differentially expressed genes in traditional Chinese medicine systems pharmacology database and The Cancer Genome Atlas. Additionally, the enrichment analysis of differential target genes (DTGs) was performed using the R-package clusterProfiler. Immunocyte correlation analysis and non-coding regulatory network construction were performed for biomarkers using Spearman's method and NetworkAnalyst. Finally, molecular docking of biomarkers and their corresponding molecule drugs was done with Autodock Vina software. RESULTS: We identified 20 active components of Astragalus membranaceus and 1 403 target genes through screening. A total of 2 300 differentially expressed genes, and 3 035 hub genes in CRC were screened. The integration of the target genes with the significantly differentially expressed genes and Hub genes identified resulted in a total of 86 DTGs. Subsequently, the results showed 828 enriched GO biological processes, 184 enriched GO molecular functions, 59 enriched GO cellular components, and 46 enriched KEGG pathways. We also obtained a total of 143 PPI pairs involving 67 nodes. Additionally, we constructed 45 mRNA-TF pairs, 101 miRNA-mRNA pairs, and 200 miRNA- mRNA-TF triplets. Finally, molecular docking was performed for the active component quercetin with F2 and UGT1A1 and formic acid with FGA, AHSG, and KNG1. CONCLUSION: This study identified the active components of Astragalus membranaceus and their corresponding targets in CRC. These findings provide robust evidence for precision drug therapy in patients with CRC."

This was a randomized, placebo-controlled, phase 2 study. Patients with stage II/III early breast cancer planning to undergo adjuvant anthracycline-based chemotherapy were randomly assigned to receive PG2 500 mg or placebo on days 1, 3, and 8 every 21 days. The fatigue global score (FGS) was assessed using the brief fatigue inventory (BFI)-Taiwan. The Breast Cancer-Specific Module of the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaires-Core30 evaluated the health-related quality of life during the first four cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy. Overall, 66 eligible patients were equally randomized into the PG2 and placebo groups between March 01, 2018, and March 09, 2021. The mean change in the FGS and fatigue intensity did not significantly differ between both groups. However, the FGS and fatigue intensity were less aggravated in the first four cycles in the premenopausal-PG2 group than in the placebo group. Our study concluded PG2 combined with adjuvant chemotherapy can reduce CIF, insomnia, the negative effect on future perspectives, and improve global health status, especially for premenopausal patients with breast cancer. Trial registration number: NCT03314805 registered on 19/10/2017.",

      "abstract": "Breast cancer, the most prevalent malignant tumor among women globally, remains a critical area of focus for researchers striving to refine therapeutic approaches. As an important component of traditional Chinese medicine, Astragalus membranaceus (AM) has demonstrated potential for multifaceted impacts on breast cancer treatment through various mechanisms. To guide clinical practice and further explore the under-researched field of AM in breast cancer treatment, this paper mainly reviews the regulatory roles of AM-derived compounds and extracts on breast cancer cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and chemoresistance. Furthermore, this study delves into the synergistic effects observed when AM is co-administered with chemotherapeutic agents, including the enhancement of chemosensitivity, mitigation of toxic side effects, and reversal of drug resistance. This review indicates that AM holds promise not only as a therapy in breast cancer treatment but also paves the way for innovative integrated treatment approaches that combine the benefits of traditional medicine with modern pharmaceuticals. Nevertheless, future research endeavors are also urged to elucidate the in vivo pharmacological effects and underlying mechanisms of AM to inform more effective clinical treatment strategies.",

In recent years, Traditional Chinese Medicine has been widely used in tumor treatment as a complementary and alternative therapy. Astragalus membranaceus is one of the main herbal medicines with tonic effect and one of the important components of many antitumor herbal compounds. Astragalus polysaccharides, saponins, and flavonoids are the main active components of Astragalus, all of which have antitumor effects.

      "abstract": "Astragali Radix (AS) is a widely used herb in traditional Chinese medicine, with calycosin as its main isoflavonoid. Our previous study discovered that calycosin triggers host defense peptide (HDP) production in IPEC-J2 cells. The aim of this study is to investigate the alleviation effects of AS total flavone and AS calycosin on growth performance, intestinal immunity, and microflora in weaned piglets. Sixty-four piglets were assigned randomly to 4 treatment groups, (1) CON: the basal diet, (2) P-CON: the basal diet plus antibiotics (1 g/kg), (3) AS-TF: the basal diet plus AS total flavone at 60 mg/day per piglet, (4) AS-CA: the basal diet plus AS calycosin at 30 mg/day per piglet. Each treatment consists of 4 replicates with 4 piglets per replicate. Results showed that treatment with AS-TF and AS-CA enhanced average daily growth and average daily feed intake compared to the CON group (P < 0.01), while AS-CA significantly reduced the diarrhea rate (P < 0.05). Both AS-TF and AS-CA significantly increased serum immunoglobulin (Ig) A and IgG levels, with AS-CA further boosting intestinal mucosal secretory IgA levels (P < 0.05). Histological analysis revealed improvements in the morphology of the jejunum and ileum and goblet cell count by AS-TF and AS-CA (P < 0.05). Supplementation of AS-TF and AS-CA promoted the expression of several intestinal HDPs (P < 0.05), and the effect of AS-CA was better than that of AS-TF. In addition, the AS-TF and AS-CA regulated jejunal microbial diversity and composition, with certain differential bacteria genera were showing high correlation with serum cytokines and immunoglobulin levels, suggesting that the intestinal flora affected by AS-TF and AS-CA may contribute to host immunity. Overall, AS CA and AS TF all improved growth performance and health, likely by enhancing nutrition digestibility, serum and intestinal immunity, and intestinal microbial composition. They showed the similar beneficial effect, indicating AS CA appears to be a major compound contributing to the effects of AS TF. This study demonstrated the positive effect of AS flavonoids on weaned piglets and provided a scientific reference for the efficient use of AS products.",

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: Rhubarb (Rheum palmatum L.) and astragalus (Radix astragali) find widespread used in clinical formulations for treating chronic kidney disease (CKD). Notably, the key active components, total rhubarb anthraquinone (TRA) and total astragalus saponin (TAS), exhibit superiority over rhubarb and astragalus in terms of their clear composition, stability, quality control, small dosage, and efficacy for disease treatment. Additionally, astragalus polysaccharides (APS) significantly contribute to the treatment of renal fibrosis by modulating the gut microbiota. However, due to differences in the biopharmaceutical properties of these components, achieving synergistic effects remains challenging. This study aims to develop combined pellets (CPs) and evaluate the potential effect on unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO)-induced renal fibrosis. METHODS: The CPs pellets were obtained by combining TRA/TAS-loaded SNEDDS pellets and APS-loaded pellets, prepared using the fluidized bed coating process. The prepared pellets underwent evaluation for morphology, bulk density, hardness, and flowing property. Moreover, the in vitro release of the payloads was evaluated with the CHP Type I method. Furthermore, the unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) model was utilized to investigate the potential effects of CPs pellets on renal fibrosis and their contribution to gut microbiota modulation. RESULTS: The ex-vivo study demonstrated that the developed CPs pellets not only improved the dissolution of TRA and TAS but also delivered TRA/TAS and APS spatiotemporally to the appropriate site along the gastrointestinal tract. In an animal model of renal fibrosis (UUO rats), oral administration of the CPs ameliorated kidney histological pathology, reduced collagen deposition, and decreased the levels of inflammatory cytokines. The CPs also restored the disturbed gut microbiota induced by UUO surgery and protected the intestinal barrier. CONCLUSION: The developed CPs pellets represent a promising strategy for efficiently delivering active components in traditional Chinese medicine formulas, offering an effective approach for treating CKD."

However, there are no studies on how isoliquiritigenin (ISL) attenuate the bystander effect of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) induced by carbon ion radiation therapy for lung cancer. This study aimed to investigate the AM-derived small molecule ISL to enhance radiotherapy sensitivity by attenuating the carbon ion radiation-induced bystander effect (RIBE) in BMSCs to elucidate its mechanism of action. In this study, we established a C57BL/6 mouse lung cancer transplantation tumor model in vivo and a co-culture model of A549 cells and BMSCs in vitro, and the models were successfully treated with carbon ions. In further work, we used flow cytometry, immunofluorescence, Western blot, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), inhibitor, short hairpin RNA (shRNA), Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8), and other methods to illustrate the mechanism. In the next experiments, we found that ISL combined with carbon ion radiotherapy had a significant anti-tumor effect and protected BMSCs from radiation damage. The aim of this study was to investigate the potential of ISL in enhancing the sensitivity of lung cancer cells to radiotherapy and attenuating RIBE in both in vitro and in vivo settings. Traditional Chinese medicine combined with radiation therapy is a promising and innovative treatment for non-small cell lung cancer. These results establish a theoretical foundation for further clinical development of ISL as a potential radiosensitizer option."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To study the effects of astragalus polysaccharide (APS) on aplastic anaemia (AA) in mice through modulation of the upstream and downstream effectors of the Hippo pathway. Further, we investigated the underlying mechanisms of APS in the treatment of AA to provide possible therapeutic strategies and drugs for clinical use. METHODS: BALB/c mice were subjected to 4 Gy X-ray irradiation and subsequently injected with lymphocytes from DBA/2 donor mice by using the tail vein to establish an AA mouse model. Next BALB/c mice were randomly divided into five groups: control (untreated), AA (model), and three APS remedy groups - LA (low-dose APS, 200 mg/kg), MA (medium-dose APS, 400 mg/kg), and HA (high-dose APS, 800 mg/kg). The mice were sacrificed after 14 d of continuous gavage with different doses of APS or saline, and the bone marrow, spleen and liver were obtained. The haematopoietic condition, apoptosis levels, and the expression of Large Tumour Suppressor 1/2 (LATS 1/2), transcriptional co-activator of activation (TCA) Yes-associated protein (YesAP), transcriptional enhancer of adherence domain (TEAD) protein, and Telomerase Reverse Transcriptase (TERT), were analysed. RESULTS: Compared with control mice, mice in the AA group exhibited a reduction in peripheral blood cell counts, a significant decrease in the haematopoietic area, increased adipocyte infiltration, and overall haematopoietic failure, mirroring the clinical presentation of AA; After 14 days of treatment with different doses of APS, the APS-treated group, in comparison to the untreated AA group, showed an increase in peripheral blood cell counts (P < 0.05), an expansionof the haematopoietic area in the bone marrow, restoration of haematopoietic function (P < 0.05), and a marked reduction in adipocyte infiltration within the bone marrow(P < 0.05). Cell infiltration into the bone marrow was also reduced. Further experiments revealed that the expression levels of TERT, LATS 1/2, YAP, and TEAD were elevated in the treated mice (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: X-ray irradiation combined with T-lymphocyte infusion successfully established an AA mouse model, and APS administration modulated the expression of TERT and the Hippo pathway effectors LATS 1/2, YAP, and TEAD, which are implicated in the pathogenesis of AA. This modulation resulted in the restoration of bone marrow haematopoietic function in AA mice, suggesting APS as a promising therapeutic agent for the treatment of AA."

      "abstract": "The crosstalk between microglia inflamed in multiple sclerosis (MIMS) and astrocytes inflamed in MS (AIMS) is a crucial factor in the formation of the central inflammatory microenvironment and neurotoxicity. Astragalus polysaccharides (APS), an important bioactive component extracted from the dried root of Astragalus, was previously found by our team to attenuate the formation of pro-inflammatory microglia and neurological dysfunction in the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) mice, a classic model of MS. To investigate the effect of APS on the MIMS-AIMS crosstalk and its underlying mechanism, in this study, a mouse model of EAE and a co-culture model of microglia-astrocytes in vitro were established. It was discovered that APS can alleviate the neurological dysfunction of EAE mice and effectively inhibit the formation of MIMS and AIMS both in vivo and in vitro. Furthermore, it was found that APS can suppress the inflammatory factors of MIMS-AIMS crosstalk in EAE mice and the resulting neurotoxicity in vivo and in vitro. The Sema4D-PlexinB2 signaling is essential for MIMS-AIMS crosstalk and promotes CNS inflammation. We demonstrated that APS can inhibit this signaling in vivo and in vitro. Treatment of recombinant Sema4D protein on cultured astrocytes in vitro significantly increases pro-inflammatory and neurotoxic factors, while APS significantly inhibits them. Conversely, after knockdown of Sema4D expression in microglia, APS no longer improves the neurotoxicity from MIMS-AIMS crosstalk. Overall, these results indicate that APS may modulate MIMS-AIMS crosstalk via the Sema4D-PlexinB2 signaling. This study provides a scientific basis for APS as a potential treatment candidate for demyelinating diseases.",

A mixture of Cervus elaphus Linnaeus, Angelica gigas Nakai, and Astragalus membranaceus Bunge (CAA) may be an effective anti-fatigue supplement. However, few clinical trials have explored the anti-fatigue effects of herbal medicines in human participants. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the effects of the CAA herbal complex on muscle fatigue and endurance capacity in a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial. METHODS: In an 8-week trial, 80 patients with chronic fatigue symptoms were randomly assigned to the CAA (43.5 ± 1.2 years) or placebo group (41.8 ± 1.3 years). Fatigue and cardiorespiratory endurance were measured at baseline, interim, and post-intervention. Fatigue-related blood biomarkers were assessed before and at the end of the intervention. RESULTS: A significant improvement in overall fatigue scores was observed on the fatigue severity scale (p = 0.038), multidimensional fatigue inventory (p = 0.037), and 24-hour visual analog scale (p = 0.002) in the CAA group compared to those in the placebo group. Fatigue improvement was observed in the CAA group, as well as physiological variables, such as increased maximal exercise time to exhaustion (p = 0.003), distance until exhaustion (p = 0.003), and maximum oxygen consumption (p = 0.039). CONCLUSION: CAA positively and significantly affected fatigue and cardiorespiratory endurance in patients with chronic fatigue, suggesting the potential use of herbal supplements for treating chronic fatigue.

Our previous works have confirmed that Astragalus polysaccharides (APS) can significantly ameliorate demyelination and disease progression in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) mice. However, it remains unclear whether APS protects BBB and the potential mechanism. In this study, we found that APS effectively reduced BBB leakage in EAE mice, which was accompanied by a decreased level of endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndoMT) in the central nervous system (CNS). We further induced EndoMT in the mouse brain endothelial cells (bEnd.3) by interleukin-1β (IL-1β) in vitro. The results showed that APS treatment could inhibit IL-1β-induced EndoMT and endothelial cell dysfunction. In addition, the transcription factor ETS1 is a central regulator of EndoMT related to the compromise of BBB. We tested the regulation of APS on ETS1 and identified the expression of ETS1 was upregulated in both EAE mice and bEnd.3 cells by APS. ETS1 knockdown facilitated EndoMT and endothelial cell dysfunction, which completely abolished the regulatory effect of APS. Collectively, APS treatment could protect BBB integrity by inhibiting EndoMT, which might be associated with upregulating ETS1 expression. Our findings indicated that APS has potential value in the prevention of MS.",

Astragalus membranaceus-Pueraria lobata decoction is from the ancient medical book Zhengzhihuibu, has been reported to be used for the treatment of diabetes and hypertension. However, the beneficial effect and mechanism of AP on chemotherapy intestinal mucositis (CIM) remain largely unknown. This study aimed to investigate the efficacy and mechanism of Astragalus membranaceus-Pueraria lobata decoction (AP) in treating CIM. The beneficial effect and mechanism of AP on chemotherapy intestinal mucositis (CIM) were detected using Drosophila model, and combination with RT qPCR, transcriptomics. AP supplementation could significantly alleviate the CPT-11-induced body injury in Drosophila, such as increasing the survival rate, recovering the impaired digestion, improving the movement, and repairing the reproduction and developmental processes. Administration of AP remarkably alleviated the IM caused by CPT-11, including inhibiting the excretion, repairing the intestinal atrophy, improving the acid-base homeostasis imbalance, and inhibiting the disruption of intestinal structure. Mechanistic studies revealed that the protective role of AP against CPT-11 induced intestinal injury was regulated mainly by inhibiting immune-related Toll and Imd pathways, and enhancing the antioxidant capacity. Taken together, these results suggest that AP may be a novel agent to relieve CIM.",

METHODS: A total of forty-eight 31-day-old weaned piglets, were divided into four groups randomly based on the treatment type: control group (CON), low dose group (LCA, 0.5% CA), medium dose group (MCA, 1.0% CA), and high dose group (HCA, 1.5% CA), and were fed for a duration of 28 days. On the morning of the 1st and 29th day, the piglets were assessed by weighing them on an empty stomach, recording their daily feed intake and diarrhea rate. RESULTS: CA increased the average daily weight gain and reduced F/G without significant differences, and the diarrhea rate was reduced in the LCA and MCA groups. Furthermore, the levels of T-AOC, SOD, GSH-Px, and MDA were increased. The levels of T-AOC in the LCA group and the MCA group, SOD in the MCA group, and GSH-Px in the HCA group were significantly higher compared with the CON group (p < 0.05). Additionally, CA significantly increased IgM, IgG, and IgA levels (p < 0.05). The results of gut microbiota analysis showed that the bacterial population and diversity of faeces were changed with the addition of CA to basal diets. CA increased the abundance of the beneficial bacterial Firmicutes and Lactobacillus. Additionally, Compared with the CON group, CA significantly increased the SCFAs content of weaned piglets (p < 0.05). DISCUSSION: CA can alleviate oxidative stress, improve immunity and antioxidant capacity, increase the abundance of beneficial bacteria, and the content of SCFAs for improving the intestinal barrier of piglets, thus promoting growth and reducing diarrhea rate in weaned piglets."

This study investigates the neuroprotective potential of APS in a model of N-Methyl-d-aspartic acid (NMDA)-induced retinal neurodegeneration, aiming to explore its potential as a treatment for retinal degenerative diseases. METHODS: Retinal function was evaluated using electroretinography (ERG), optomotor reflex (OMR), and flash visual evoked potentials (FVEP). Retinal inflammatory responses were examined through immunohistochemistry, western blotting (WB), and quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR). To assess the integrity of visual projections, an intravitreal injection of adeno-associated virus (AAV) was employed to trace the projections of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) to the visual centers. RESULTS: APS treatment conferred protection to retinal cells, as indicated by ERG and OMR assessments. And APS intervention mitigated NMDA-induced apoptosis, evidenced by a decrease in TUNEL-positive cells. Furthermore, APS treatment attenuated the NMDA-induced reduction in RGC projections to the visual centers, including the superior colliculus and lateral geniculate nucleus, as demonstrated by AAV tracing. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings reveal that APS shields the retina from NMDA-induced damage by inhibiting the NF-κB signaling pathway and reduces the detrimental effects of NMDA on RGC projections to the visual centers. These findings propose APS as a potential novel therapeutic agent for the treatment of retinal diseases.",

Traditional Chinese medicine emphasizes holistic principles and syndrome-based diagnosis/therapy. Its primary focus is on enhancing overall well-being, rather than solely aiming for weight loss. Astragalus polysaccharide (APS), extracted from Astragalus membranaceus, has demonstrated promising effects in enhancing the health status of obese individuals. Therefore, this study employed DIO mouse model to explore the immunomodulatory effects of APS in obese mice. The findings revealed a dose-dependent effect of APS on obesity prevention in DIO mice. Specifically, a 4% concentration of APS significantly reduced body weight, whereas a 2% concentration tended to increase it. Furthermore, APS effectively modulated blood glucose and lipid profiles, demonstrating varying degrees of improvement in blood glucose and blood lipid-related factors. Notably, APS also facilitated the reactivation of suppressed immune function in obese mice, regulating a range of immunological variables associated with obesity and thereby maintaining homeostasis. In conclusion, the functional benefits of APS were dose-related, with a 4% concentration demonstrating promising results in obesity prevention and immune system modulation. These findings provide a potential reference for treating inflammatory conditions associated with obesity, contributing academic understanding of obesity management and immunomodulation.",

      "abstract": "Beneficial fungi of the genus Trichoderma are among the most widespread biocontrol agents that induce a plant's defense response against pathogens. Fusarium solani is one of the main pathogens that can negatively affect Astragalus mongholicus production and quality. To investigate the impact of Trichoderma harzianum on Astragalus mongholicus defense responses to Fusarium solani, A. mongholicus roots under T. harzianum + F. solani (T + F) treatment and F. solani (F) treatment were sampled and subjected to transcriptomic analysis. A differential expression analysis revealed that 6361 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) responded to T. harzianum induction. The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis of the 6361 DEGs revealed that the genes significantly clustered into resistance-related pathways, such as the plant-pathogen interaction pathway, phenylpropanoid biosynthesis pathway, flavonoid biosynthesis pathway, isoflavonoid biosynthesis pathway, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway, and plant hormone signal transduction pathway. Pathway analysis revealed that the PR1, formononetin biosynthesis, biochanin A biosynthesis, and CHIB, ROS production, and HSP90 may be upregulated by T. harzianum and play important roles in disease resistance. Our study further revealed that the H2O2 content was significantly increased by T. harzianum induction. Formononetin and biochanin A had the potential to suppress F. solani. Weighted gene coexpression network analysis (WGCNA) revealed one module, including 58 DEGs associated with T. harzianum induction. One core hub gene, RPS25, was found to be upregulated by T. harzianum, SA (salicylic acid) and ETH (ethephon). Overall, our data indicate that T. harzianum can induce induced systemic resistance (ISR) and systemic acquired resistance (SAR) in A. mongholicus. The results of this study lay a foundation for a further understanding of the molecular mechanism by which T. harzianum induces resistance in A. mongholicus.",

OBJECTIVE: This study aims to investigate the potential pharmacological effects and molecular mechanism of AM in the treatment of ischemic heart failure (IHF) using network pharmacology methods, molecular docking technology, and in vitro experiments. METHODS: The active components and targets of AM were obtained from the TCMSP databases, while the disease targets of IHF were retrieved from GeneCards and OMIM databases. The analysis of overlapping targets between AM and IHF mainly included active compounds-targets network, PPI network, and GO and KEGG enrichment analysis. The association between active compounds and target proteins was verified through molecular docking. Additionally, an in vitro experimental model was used to evaluate the accuracy of the forecast results. RESULTS: The network pharmacological analysis revealed that quercetin, kaempferol, 7-Omethylisomucronulatol, formononetin, and isorhamnetin were the core active components of AM in treating IHF. The core targets included AKT1, IL6, IL1B, PTGS2, CASP3, MMP9, and HIF1A. The molecular docking results demonstrated a strong binding affinity between these active components and targets. The KEGG pathway analysis suggested that the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway might play a central role in mediating AM's therapeutic effects on IHF. In vitro experiments demonstrated that AM treatment enhanced cell viability, reduced heart failure biomarkers, and suppressed cell apoptosis. Furthermore, the western blot analyses indicated that AM treatment effectively regulated AKT1 phosphorylation in an experimental model of IHF. CONCLUSION: Through integrated network pharmacological analysis, molecular docking technology, and in vitro experimental validation, it was demonstrated that AM can effectively mitigate IHF through activating PI3K-AKT signaling pathway. These findings significantly advance our understanding of the molecular mechanisms in IHF treatment and contribute further to promoting the clinical application of AM."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Tumor vaccines have achieved remarkable progress in treating patients with various tumors in clinical studies. Nevertheless, extensive research has also revealed that tumor vaccines are not up to expectations for the treatment of solid tumors due to their low immunogenicity. Therefore, there is an urgent need to design a tumor vaccine that can stimulate a broad anti-tumor immune response. METHODS: In this work, we developed a nanovaccine (NP-TCL@APS), which includes nanoparticles loaded with colorectal cancer tumor cell lysates (TCL) and Astragalus polysaccharides (APS) into poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) to induce a robust innate immune response. The NP-TCL@APS was identified by transmission electron microscopy and Malvern laser particle size analyzer. The killing and immune activation effects of NP-TCL@APS were evaluated in vitro. Finally, safety and anti-tumor efficacy were evaluated in the colorectal cancer tumor-bearing mouse model. RESULTS: We found that NP-TCL@APS was preferentially uptaken by DC and further promoted the activation of DC in vitro. Additionally, nanoparticles codelivery of TCL and APS enhanced the antigen-specific CD8+ T cell response and suppressed the growth of tumors in mouse models with good biocompatibility. CONCLUSION: We successfully prepared a nanovaccine termed NP-TCL@APS, which can promote the maturation of DC and induce strong responses by T lymphocytes to exert anti-tumor effects. The strategy proposed here is promising for generating a tumor vaccine and can be extended to various types of cancers.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the protective effect and mechanism of Astragalus polysaccharide (APS) on autoimmune encephalomyelitis. METHODS: C57BL/6 mice were randomly divided into the blank control group, EAE group, and APS intervention group (n=15/group). The Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis (EAE) mouse model was established by active immunization. The pathological changes in the spinal cord were evaluated by Hematoxylin-eosin (HE) and Luxol Fast Blue (LFB) staining. The number of CD11b+ Gr-1+ myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) in the spleen tissues of mice in each group was determined by immunofluorescence staining. The expression of Arginase-1 in the spinal cord and spleen of each group was detected by immunofluorescence double staining. The TNF-α, IL-6, and Arginase-1 levels in the spleen were detected by ELISA assay. A western blot was used to detect the protein expression of the AMPK/JAK/STAT3/Arginase-1 signaling pathway. RESULTS: After the intervention of APS, the incidence of autoimmune encephalomyelitis in mice of the APS group was significantly lower than that in the EAE group, and the intervention of APS could significantly delay the onset time in the EAE mice, and the score of neurological function deficit in mice was significantly lower than that in EAE group (P < 0.05). APS intervention could reduce myelin loss and improve the inflammatory response of EAE mice. Moreover, it could induce the expression of CD11b+ GR-1 + bone MDSCs in the spleen and increase the expression of Arginase-1 in the spinal cord and spleen. This study further demonstrated that APS can protect EAE mice by activating the AMPK/JAK/STAT3/Arginase-1 signaling pathway. CONCLUSION: After the intervention of APS, myelin loss and inflammatory response of EAE mice were effectively controlled. APS promoted the secretion of Arginase-1 by activating MDSCs and inhibited CD4+T cells by activating AMPK/JAK/STAT3/Arginase-1 signaling pathway, thus improving the clinical symptoms and disease progression of EAE mice."

      "abstract": "Chimeric antigen receptor-engineered T (CAR-T) cell therapy of cancer has been a hotspot and promising. However, due to rapid exhaustion, CAR-T cells are less effective in solid tumors than in hematological ones. CD122+CXCR3+ memory T cells are characterized with longevity, self-renewal and great antitumoral capacity. Thus, it's compelling to induce memory CAR-T cells to enhance their efficacy on solid tumors. Astragalus polysaccharide (APS) has reportedly exhibited antitumoral effects. However, it's unclear if APS has an impact on CD8+ memory T cell generation or persistence. Using two human cancer cell lines, here we found that APS significantly improved the persistence of GPC3-targeted CAR-T cells and enhanced their suppression of tumor growth in both Huh7 and HepG2 xenograft models of hepatocellular carcinoma. APS increased CD122+/CXCR3+ memory T cells, but decreased their PD-1+ subset within CD8+ CAR-T cells in tumor-bearing mice, while these effects of APS were also confirmed with in vitro experiments. Moreover, APS augmented the expression of chemokines CXCL9/CXCL10 by the tumor in vivo and in vitro. It also enhanced the proliferation and chemotaxis/migration of CAR-T cells in vitro. Finally, APS promoted the phosphorylation of STAT5 in CD8+ CAR-T cells, whereas inhibition of STAT5 activation reversed these in vitro effects of APS. Therefore, APS enhanced the antitumoral effects of CD8+ CAR-T cells by promoting formation/persistence of CD122+/CXCR3+/PD-1- memory T cells and their migration to the tumor.",

Methods: Animal tissues were examined to evaluate a CKD-PF mice model construction. mRNA sequencing was performed to find differential targets. The core target genes of AM against PF were screened through network pharmacology analysis, and CKD-PF mice models were given high- and low-dose AM to verify common genes. Serum pharmacochemistry was conducted to clarify which components of AM can enter the blood circulation, and the selected monomer was further validated through cell experiments for the effect on PF and mesothelial mesenchymal transition (MMT) of peritoneal mesothelial cells (PMCs). Results: The CKD-PF mice models were successfully constructed. A total of 31,184 genes were detected in the blank and CKD-PF groups, and 228 transcription factors had significant differences between the groups. Combined with network pharmacology analysis, a total of 228 AM-PF-related targets were identified. Androgen receptor (AR) was the remarkable transcription factor involved in regulating transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1). AM may be involved in regulating the AR/TGF-β1 signaling pathway and may alleviate peritoneal dialysis-related fibrosis and muscle atrophy in CKD-PF mice. In 3% peritoneal dialysis solution-stimulated HMrSV5 cells, AR expression levels were dramatically reduced, whereas TGF-β1/p-smads expression levels were considerably increased. Conclusion: AM could ameliorate PF and related muscle atrophy via the co-target AR and modulated AR/TGF-β1 pathway. Calycosin, a monomer of AM, could partially reverse PMC MMT via the AR/TGF-β1/smads pathway. This study explored the traditional Chinese medicine theory of \"same treatment for different diseases,\" and supplied the pharmacological evidence of \"AM can treat flaccidity syndrome.\""

Thus, blocking the infiltration of CD8+T cells is necessary for the treatment of neuroinflammatory diseases. Our previous study demonstrated that astragalus polysaccharide (APS) could significantly reduce the infiltration of CD8+T cells in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis mice. However, the mechanism by which APS suppresses CD8+T cell infiltration remains elusive. In this study, we further found that APS could reduce the CD8+T cell infiltration in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced neuroinflammatory model. Furthermore, we established the mouse brain endothelial cell (bEnd.3) inflammatory injury model by interleukin-1β or LPS in vitro. The results showed that APS treatment downregulated the expression of vascular cell adhesion molecule1 to decrease the adhesion of CD8+T cells to bEnd.3 cells. APS also upregulated the expression of zonula occludens-1 and vascular endothelial cadherin to reduce the transendothelial migration of CD8+T cells. The PI3K/AKT signaling pathway might mediate this protective effect of APS on bEnd.3 cells against inflammatory injury. In addition, we demonstrated the protective effect of APS on the integrity of brain endothelial cells in an LPS-induced neuroinflammatory model. In summary, our results indicate that APS can reduce peripheral CD8+T cell infiltration via enhancing the barrier function of brain endothelial cells; it may be a potential for the prevention of neuroinflammatory diseases.",

Astragalus polysaccharide (APS) is derived from Astragalus membranaceus and exhibits impressive bioactivity, including anti-aging, anti-tumor, and immunomodulatory functions. METHODS: Mice were intraperitoneally inoculated with Brucella melitensis M5 and then treated with APS intraperitoneally injection daily for 7 d. RESULTS: Compared to the M5-infected group, the lower bacteria loads in the APS-treated groups were proved, especially at the acute stage of infection. APS treatment relieved splenomegaly, excess expressions of several pro-inflammatory cytokines (including CXCL1, IFN-γ, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-12p70, and TNF-α). The raised level of IL-4 was observed in APS-treated mice. APS contributed to raising the ratio of M1 macrophage and reducing the ratio of M2 macrophage in the blood. DISCUSSION: The present study provides some evidence on the potential application of APS in controlling and treating brucellosis and should be further explored.",

Astragalus membranaceus Fisch. ex Bunge (A. membranaceus), Nigella sativa L. (N. sativa), and Perilla frutescens (L.) Britton (P. frutescens) are plant species used in traditional medicine for the treatment of various diseases. Their potential to act as immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory, and anti-allergic agents makes them interesting for investigating their clinical potential in alleviating the symptoms of allergic diseases. Allergy affects a large number of people; according to some sources more than 30% of the world population suffer from some type of allergic reaction, with pollen allergy as the most common type. Treatment is usually pharmacological and may not be completely effective or have side effects. Thus, we are seeking traditional medicine, mostly medicinal plants, with promising potential for alleviating allergy symptoms. A literature overview was conducted employing databases such as Scopus, PubMed, Web of Science, Springer, and Google Scholar. This manuscript summarizes recent in vivo preclinical and clinical studies on three species with immunomodulatory activity, provides a comparison of their anti-allergic effects, and underlines the potential of their application in clinical practice. The obtained results confirmed their efficacy in the in vivo and clinical studies, but also emphasize the problem of phytochemical characterization of the species and difference between tested doses. More clinical trials with standardized protocols (defined active molecules, dosage, side effects) are required to obtain safe and effective herbal drugs."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Melanoma is a highly aggressive form of skin cancer. The existence of cancer stem cells (CSCs) and tumor immune evasion are two major causes of melanoma progression, but no effective treatment has been found at present. Astragalus polysaccharide (APS) is a principal active component derived from Astragalus membranaceus, showing anti-tumor effects in various tumors including melanoma. However, the underlying mechanism is still unclear. METHODS: The regulation of APS on self-renewal ability and CSC markers expression in melanoma stem cells (MSCs) was measured by tumor sphere formation and tumorigenicity assays, RT-qPCR, and western blot. Flow cytometry was conducted to evaluate the activation of immune system by APS in melanoma mice. Further, the mechanism was explored based on PD-L1 overexpression and knock-down B16 cells. RESULTS: APS attenuated the tumor sphere formation of MSCs in vitro as well as the tumorigenicity in vivo. It also decreased the expression of CD133, BMI1 and CD47. Based on the PD-L1 overexpression and knock-down B16 cells, it was confirmed that APS inhibited the induction of MSCs by down-regulating PD-L1 expression. Meanwhile, APS increased the infiltration of CD4+ and CD8+T cells in tumor tissues because of its inhibitory effect on PD-L1. CONCLUSIONS: APS inhibited MSC induction and overcame tumor immune evasion through reducing PD-L1 expression. This study provided compelling evidence that APS could be a prospective therapeutic agent for treating melanoma.",

METHODS: The randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of AI in treating HFmrEF were retrieved from 8 major English and Chinese electronic databases, up until November 30, 2023. To evaluate the methodological quality of the included studies, the Cochrane bias risk tool and the Modified Jadad Scale were employed. Stata 17.0 software was utilized for statistical analysis, sensitivity analysis, and assessment of publication bias. RESULTS: Ten RCTs with 995 patients (562 males and 433 females) were identified. Meta-analysis indicated that compared to conventional treatment (CT), AI significantly improved LVR, specifically increasing left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF, MD = 4.56, 95% CI: 3.68-5.44, p < 0.00001), decreasing left ventricular end-diastolic volume (LVEDV, MD = -7.89, 95% CI: -11.13 to -4.64, p < 0.00001), left ventricular end-diastolic diameter (LVEDD, MD = -4.18, 95% CI: -5.79 to -2.56, p < 0.00001), left ventricular end-systolic volume (LVESV, MD = -8.11, 95% CI: -11.79 to -4.43, p < 0.00001), and left ventricular end-systolic diameter (LVESD, MD = -3.42, 95% CI: -4.90 to -1.93, p < 0.00001). AI also improved clinical efficacy (RR = 4.62, 95% CI: 3.11-6.88, p < 0.00001), reduced N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-pro BNP, MD = -27.94, 95% CI: -43.3 to -12.36) level, without increasing the incidence of adverse reactions (RR = 1.60, 95% CI: 0.59-4.29, p = 0.35). Sensitivity analysis confirmed the reliability of the merged results, and Begg's and Egger's tests showed no significant publication bias. CONCLUSION: The systematic review and meta-analysis revealed that combining AI with CT improves LVR without increasing adverse events in HFmrEF patients. However, caution is needed in interpreting the results due to limited evidence. Future high-quality RCTs are needed to support these conclusions.

      "abstract": "Astragalus membranaceus widely used in traditional Chinese medicine, exhibits multiple pharmacological effects, including immune stimulation, antioxidation, hepatoprotection, diuresis, antidiabetes, anticancer, and expectorant properties. Its main bioactive compounds include flavonoids, triterpene saponins, and polysaccharides. Astragalus polysaccharides (APS), one of its primary bioactive components, have been shown to possess a variety of pharmacological activities, such as antioxidant, immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory, antitumor, antidiabetic, antiviral, hepatoprotective, anti-atherosclerotic, hematopoietic, and neuroprotective effects. This review provides a comprehensive summary of the molecular mechanisms and therapeutic effects of APS in treating neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and multiple sclerosis (MS). It discusses how APS improve insulin resistance, reduce blood glucose levels, enhance cognitive function, and reduce Aβ accumulation and neuronal apoptosis by modulating various pathways such as Nrf2, JAK/STAT, Toll, and IMD. For PD, APS protect neurons and stabilize mitochondrial function by inhibiting ROS production and promoting autophagy through the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. APS also reduce oxidative stress and neurotoxicity induced by 6-hydroxydopamine, showcasing their neuroprotective effects. In MS, APS alleviate symptoms by suppressing T cell proliferation and reducing pro-inflammatory cytokine expression via the PD-1/PD-Ls pathway. APS promote myelin regeneration by activating the Sonic hedgehog signaling pathway and fostering the differentiation of neural stem cells into oligodendrocytes. This article emphasizes the significant antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, and neuroprotective pharmacological activities of APS, highlighting their potential as promising candidates for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases."

      "abstract": "The Astragalus grahamianus (AG) Royle ex. Benth is traditionally used for the treatment of various human disorders. The current research work is aimed to explore the neuroprotective anti-Parkinson effects of various fractions of Astragalus grahamianus (A. grahamianus). Fine powder of Astragalus grahamianus was extracted with 70% methanol and then fractionated with various solvents on the basis of polarity. Standard protocols were used to investigate the bioactive constituents present in the various plant fractions. In-vitro antioxidant potential of various fractions was checked using diverse free radicals. In-vivo rats model was used to determined the neuroprotective effects of methanol fraction of A. grahamianus. The results revealed that various fractions of A. grahamianus contain flavonoids, cardiac glycosides, steroids, gums, terpenes, proteins, and carbohydrates except chloroform fraction lake the presence of steroids, cardiac glycosides, gums and saponins, aqueous fraction of steroids, terpenoids, gums and saponins, n-Hexane fraction steroids, carbohydrates, alkaloids, gums and flavonoids. The highest amount of total phenolic contents was found in AGME (32.67 ± 2.3 mg GAE / g). The AGME also showed enhanced free radicals cations potential against DPPH, ABTS and H2O2, respectively. The correlation between AOA (antioxidant activity) and TPC (total phenolic contents) revealed to be substantial. Relative R2 values for ABTS, H2O2, and DPPH activity are 0.9974, 0.9845, and 0.9678, respectively. The in-vivo neuroprotective activities showed significant results. Our findings highlight significant antioxidant, and neuroprotective possessions of AGME attributed to powerful bioactive compounds.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The intestinal barrier is the first line of defense against intestinal invasion by pathogens and foreign antigens and is closely associated with the gut microbiota. Astragalus polysaccharides (APS) have a long history of use in traditional Chinese medicine owing to its protective properties against intestinal barrier function. The mechanism of APS-induced gut microbiota enhancing intestinal barrier function is urgently needed. RESULTS: Dietary polysaccharide deprivation induced intestinal barrier dysfunction, decreased growth performance, altered microbial composition (Faecalibacterium, Dorea, and Coprobacillus), and reduced isobutyrate concentration. The results showed that APS facilitates intestinal barrier function in broiler chickens, including a thicker mucus layer, reduced crypt depth, and the growth of tight junction proteins. We studied the landscape of APS-induced gut microbiota and found that APS selectively promoted the growth of Parabacteroides, a commensal bacterium that plays a predominant role in enhancing intestinal barrier function. An in vitro growth assay further verified that APS selectively increased the abundance of Parabacteroides distasonis and Bacteroides uniformis. Dietary APS supplementation increased the concentrations of isobutyrate and bile acid (mainly chenodeoxycholic acid and deoxycholate acid) and activated signaling pathways related to intestinal barrier function (such as protein processing in the endoplasmic reticulum, tight junctions, and adherens junction signaling pathways). CONCLUSIONS: APS intervention restored the dietary polysaccharide-induced dysfunction of the intestinal barrier by selectively promoting the abundance of Parabacteroides distasonis, and increasing the concentrations of isobutyrate and bile acids (mainly CDCA and DCA). These findings suggest that APS-induced gut microbiota and metabolic niches are promising strategies for enhancing intestinal barrier function."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is the primary cause of end-stage renal disease. The Astragalus-Coptis drug pair is frequently employed in the management of DKD. However, the precise molecular mechanism underlying its therapeutic effect remains elusive. AIM: To investigate the synergistic effects of multiple active ingredients in the Astragalus-Coptis drug pair on DKD through multiple targets and pathways. METHODS: The ingredients of the Astragalus-Coptis drug pair were collected and screened using the TCMSP database and the SwissADME platform. The targets were predicted using the SwissTargetPrediction database, while the DKD differential gene expression analysis was obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus database. DKD targets were acquired from the GeneCards, Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man database, and DisGeNET databases, with common targets identified through the Venny platform. The protein-protein interaction network and the \"disease-active ingredient-target\" network of the common targets were constructed utilizing the STRING database and Cytoscape software, followed by the analysis of the interaction relationships and further screening of key targets and core active ingredients. Gene Ontology (GO) function and Kyoto Ency-clopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichments were performed using the DAVID database. The tissue and organ distributions of key targets were evaluated. PyMOL and AutoDock software validate the molecular docking between the core ingredients and key targets. Finally, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were conducted to simulate the optimal complex formed by interactions between core ingredients and key target proteins. RESULTS: A total of 27 active ingredients and 512 potential targets of the Astragalus-Coptis drug pair were identified. There were 273 common targets between DKD and the Astragalus-Coptis drug pair. Through protein-protein interaction network topology analysis, we identified 9 core active ingredients and 10 key targets. GO and KEGG pathway enrichment analyses revealed that Astragalus-Coptis drug pair treatment for DKD involves various biological processes, including protein phosphorylation, negative regulation of apoptosis, inflammatory response, and endoplasmic reticulum unfolded protein response. These pathways are mainly associated with the advanced glycation end products (AGE)-receptor for AGE products signaling pathway in diabetic complications, as well as the Lipid and atherosclerosis. Molecular docking and MD simulations demonstrated high affinity and stability between the core active ingredients and key targets. Notably, the quercetin-AKT serine/threonine kinase 1 (AKT1) and quercetin-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) protein complexes exhibited exceptional stability. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that DKD treatment with the Astragalus-Coptis drug pair involves multiple ingredients, targets, and signaling pathways. We propose a novel approach for investigating the molecular mechanism underlying the therapeutic effects of the Astragalus-Coptis drug pair on DKD. Furthermore, we suggest that quercetin is the most potent active ingredient and specifically targets AKT1 and TNF, providing a theoretical foundation for further exploration of pharmacologically active ingredients and elucidating their molecular mechanisms in DKD treatment."

      "abstract": "The main objective of this work was to investigate the mechanism of Astragalus aqueous extract ulcer healing in diabetic foot model rats through the hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF-1ɑ)/vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signalling pathway. Fifty specific-pathogen-free male Sprague Dawley rats were divided into blank (A), model control (B), Astragalus extract (C) and mupirocin (D) treatment groups. Group A received a regular diet, whereas the other groups received a high-fat/high-sugar diet and intraperitoneal streptozotocin injections to induce diabetes. Diabetic foot ulcers were created via skin excision. Subsequently, ulcers were debrided daily. Groups B, C and D received wet saline gauze, wet gauze with Astragalus extract and gauze with mupirocin, respectively, on the affected area. Group A received no treatment. After 14 days, the rats were assessed for ulcer healing and general condition. Immunohistochemistry was used to detect HIF-1ɑ and VEGF levels in the dorsalis pedis artery, and ELISA was used to determine serum IL-6 and CRP levels. The results revealed that Groups C and D had significantly faster ulcer healing compared with Group B (p < 0.01), and ulcer healing was faster in Group C than in Group D (p < 0.01). Group C exhibited notably higher HIF-1ɑ and VEGF protein expression levels compared with Groups B and D (p < 0.01). IL-6 and CRP expression levels in Groups C and D were significantly lower than those in Group B (p < 0.01). In summary, Astragalus aqueous extract effectively treats diabetic foot ulcers by up-regulating HIF-1ɑ and VEGF expression, activating the HIF-1ɑ/VEGF pathway, improving local tissue ischaemia and hypoxia, promoting collateral circulation and enhancing dorsalis pedis artery formation, thereby accelerating ulcer repair in diabetic rats.",

      "abstract": "CONTEXT: In China, HUANGQI is widely used for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, a comprehensive understanding of its mechanism of anti-AD effects is lacking. OBJECTIVE: To explore the active ingredients of HUANGQI and its potential targets and mechanisms of action in AD. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The active ingredients and targets of HUANGQI were screened from databases (TCSMP, ETCM, and BATMan), and AD-related genes were obtained from DrugBank and GeneCards. The same target genes were screened, and a drug-target disease network was constructed. The PPI network was constructed and GO and KEGG pathway enrichment analyses of the targets. The Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay was used to determine suitable HUANGQI treatment concentrations for HT-22 cells between 0-480 μg/mL. CCK-8, FITC-phalloidin and propidium iodide (PI) assays were used to examine the protective effect of (0, 60, 120, 240 μg/mL) of HUANGQI on 20 μM Aβ1-42-induced HT-22 cell cytotoxicity. RESULTS: Twelve active ingredients of HUANGQI were selected, with 679 common targets associated with AD. GO and KEGG analysis revealed that the therapeutic mechanisms of HUANGQI involve TNF, AGE, the NF-κB pathway, and nuclear receptor activity-related processes. The CCK-8 assay indicated that HUANGQI was not cytotoxic to HT-22 cells at concentrations less than 240 μg/mL and was able to attenuate Aβ1-42-induced cellular damage (EC50 = 83.46 μg/mL). FITC-phalloidin and PI assays suggested that HUANGQI could alleviate 20 μM Aβ1-42-induced neuronal cell cytotoxicity in a dose-dependent manner. CONCLUSION: HUANGQI has a protective effect on Aβ1-42-induced nerve cell injury; further mechanism research was needed.",

As an alternative, growth hormone is used in combination, but it has side effects, a high cost, and psychological factors, and it is not satisfactory in terms of effectiveness. It is necessary to develop a safe and affordable treatment that can replace it. The Korean Food and Drug Administration approved HT042, a standardized functional food ingredient, with the claim that it can help height growth of children. In this study, it was found that HT042 activated the Indian hedgehog/parathyroid hormone-related protein signaling pathway and enhanced the number of growth hormone receptors and insulin-like growth factor-1 receptors on the growth plate surface, which were reduced by DEX treatment, and restored growth retardation. In metatarsal bone and primary chondrocyte models, it was found that HT042 can promote the length of growth plate and recover DEX-induced growth retardation. It was also found that HT042 promotes cell proliferation using bromodeoxyuridine and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling assays; moreover, we verified increased expression of GHR/IGF-1R and Ihh/PTHrP pathway activity using qRT-PCR, western blotting, and siRNA analyses to verify its direct action on the growth plate. The anti-apoptotic effect of HT042 was identified by regulating the expression of apoptotic factors such as caspase-3, Bcl2, Bclx, and Bax. These results were identified using both ex vivo and in vitro models. Our study verified that co-administration of HT042 could recover the DEX induced growth retardation.",

Understanding the metabolic characteristics of brain microregions and disturbances in tissues and systemic circulation is crucial for elucidating the mechanisms of CIRI and the therapeutic benefits of AC. However, in situ metabolic regulation of the complex brain structure has not been adequately studied, and the therapeutic mechanism of AC requires immediate clarification. PURPOSE: The present study aimed to unveil the specific metabolic reprogramming of CIRI at systemic and microregional levels, identify key metabolic pathways and metabolites, and elucidate the therapeutic mechanisms of AC. METHODS: Air flow-assisted desorption electrospray ionization mass spectrometry imaging (AFADESI-MSI), a newly developed technique, was used to investigate metabolites in brain microregions. Hematoxylin-eosin, Nissl, and immunofluorescence staining were performed to visualize the microscopic changes associated with spatial metabolism. A comprehensive metabolomics study was conducted on serum, brain tissue, and microregions, along with neurological assessments, cerebral infarction measurements, and Evans blue experiments, to assess the systemic and local metabolic effects of AC treatment for CIRI. RESULTS: AC significantly reduced neurological damage, minimized infarct size, and repaired blood-brain barrier damage in CIRI rats. AFADESI-MSI demonstrated that the metabolic imbalance caused by CIRI primarily occurs in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, caudate putamen, thalamus, cerebellar cortex, and fiber tract regions. Significant changes in 16 metabolites were observed in these regions, corresponding to neuron damage, glial cell activation, and neural repair. 20 metabolites from serum and 4 from brain tissue varied significantly with the sham group. Comprehensive metabolomics analysis indicated a close relationship among serum, tissue, and microregional metabolism. CIRI-induced systemic and localized metabolic disorders involve 14 metabolic pathways. AC conferred therapeutic benefits in CIRI by reversing various metabolic imbalances. CONCLUSION: AFADESI-MSI efficiently visualized brain microregion metabolism. Comprehensive metabolomics analysis revealed detailed insights into the specific metabolic reprogramming in CIRI and the therapeutic impacts of AC. AC demonstrated significant clinical potential as an adjunct therapy to existing CIRI treatments.",

      "abstract": "ETHNO-PHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Huangqi Gegen decoction (HGD), which comprises Astragali Radix (AR) and Puerariae Radix (PR), is widely used to treat thrombosis in China. However, the mechanism underlying its synergistic effect in thrombosis treatment remains unclear. AIM OF THE STUDY: Following PR administration, low plasma exposure was reported for its primary ingredients. In this regard, this study examined the effect of AR on PR's antithrombotic efficacy with respect to the impact of Astragalus Polysaccharide (APS) on the oral delivery of Puerarin (PUE). MATERIALS AND METHODS: To evaluate the synergistic effect of HGD, a thrombus mice model was established via intraperitoneal injection of carrageenan. After treatment, histopathological observations were made, and the proportion of thrombus length in the tail, as well as the plasma APTT, PT, INR, and FIB levels, were detected. Molecular docking was employed to assess the PR ingredients that could inhibit the HMGB1/NF-κB/NLRP3 pathway. The Pharmacokinetics of PR ingredients in rats were also compared between the PR and HGD groups. Moreover, the effect of APS on the solubility, intestinal absorption, and pharmacokinetics of PUE was evaluated. Furthermore, the impact of APS on the antithrombotic efficacy of PUE was assessed. RESULTS: In mice, AR enhanced the antithrombotic effect of PR. This improved PR effect was associated with isoflavones-induced downregulation of the HMGB1/NF-κB/NLRP3 pathway. The synergistic effect resulting from the compatibility of HGD components was primarily achieved by improving the plasma exposure of PR isoflavones. Specifically, APS enhanced PUE's water solubility through the formation of self-assembly Nanoparticles, increasing its intestinal absorption and oral bioavailability, which, in turn, suppressed the HMGB1/NF-κB/NLRP3 pathway, thus improving its antithrombotic effect. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings revealed that APS improved PUE's plasma exposure, enhancing its inhibitory effect on the HMGB1/NF-κB/NLRP3 pathway. This mechanism presents a key aspect of the synergistic effect of HGD compatibility in thrombosis treatment.",

      "abstract": "Total astragalus saponins (TAS) are the main active components of astragali radix, and have potent anti-hepatic fibrosis effect. However, the therapeutic efficacy of TAS and their potential mechanisms in the treatment of primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) remain unclear. In this study, two mouse models of PSC, including 3,5-Diethoxycarbonyl-1,4-Dihydro-2,4,6-Collidine (DDC)-induced PSC and Mdr2-/- spontaneous PSC, and the Tgr5-/- mice were used to investigate the therapeutic effect and mechanisms of TAS. Treatment with TAS, particularly with a dose of 56 mg/kg, significantly ameliorated the PSC-related liver injury, cholestasis, collagen deposition, ductular reaction (DR), and fibrosis in the DDC-induced and Mdr2-/-spontaneous PSC mice. Furthermore, treatment with TAS significantly mitigated the PSC-related inflammatory responses in vivo and HIBEpiC cells by inhibiting the expression of TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1β. Mechanistically, treatment with TAS rescued the PSC-decreased hepatic TGR5 expression to attenuate the NF-κB p65 phosphorylation. Notably, the therapeutic efficacy of TAS on PSC in DDC-induced mice was abrogated in Tgr5-/- mice, suggesting the anti-PSC effect of TAS may depend on enhancing TGR5 expression. In conclusion, TAS ameliorated DR, inflammation and liver fibrosis in both models of PSC mice by rescuing TGR5 expression. Our findings may aid in the design of new therapeutic strategies for the treatment of PSC.",
