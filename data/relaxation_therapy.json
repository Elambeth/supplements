      "abstract": "Background & objectives Diabetes distress (DD) is a mental condition that can develop in people with diabetes and shares characteristics with stress, anxiety, and depression. The aim was to determine the effect of Jacobson's Progressive Muscle Relaxation (PMR) therapy on DD, anxiety, glycemic control, hemodynamic and lipid measures among people with type 2 diabetes (T2DM). Methods A total of 80 participants were recruited for this prospective randomised intervention study and divided into two groups equally; group 1 (Control) (n=40) received general counselling for stress reduction and group 2 (Intervention) (n=40) received PMR therapy and general counselling for stress reduction. A pre-, and post-test was done with diabetes distress Scale (DDS) and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) Scales. Baseline data on anthropometric, hemodynamic, biochemical details were collected and repeated after three months. Thirty-six participants, with four dropouts in each group, reported for follow up. Diabetes medication regimens in both groups remained unchanged throughout the study period. Results There was a significant reduction in the total mean scores of DDS (Pre vs. Post) (3.8 vs. 1.6) and GAD Scale (17.9 vs. 6.3; P<0.0001) in the intervention group. The PMR therapy group showed a significant reduction in HbA1c, fasting and post prandial (PP) glucose levels with HbA1c (baseline vs. follow up; 9.2% vs. 7.6%), fasting (194.5 mg/dl vs. 142.4 mg/dl) and PP glucose levels (266.5 mg/dl vs. 175.5 mg/dl) (P=0.001) whereas control group showed an increase in HbA1c, fasting and PP glucose levels. The impact of PMR therapy was also reflected in the lipid profile. Seventy per cent of the intervention group participants followed PMR therapy regularly. Interpretation & conclusions Our study findings highlighted that PMR therapy had a positive effect on diabetes distress and anxiety among people with T2DM. It also improved glycemic control and can be used as an adjunctive to the medications for better management of T2DM.",

METHODS: A total of 114 patients receiving chemotherapy at Tangshan People's Hospital (September 2023-June 2024) were randomly divided into three groups: control (routine nursing), experiment group 1 (static Benson relaxation), and experiment group 2 (dynamic yoga + static Benson relaxation). The intervention lasted 8 weeks. Cancer-related fatigue and sleep disorders were assessed before and after intervention using the Revised Piper Fatigue Scale and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). RESULTS: Prior to intervention, there were no significant differences in fatigue and sleep quality across groups (P > 0.05). Post-intervention, both experiment groups showed significant improvements in fatigue and sleep quality compared to the control (P < 0.001). Experiment group 2 showed greater reductions in behavior, body, and total fatigue scores compared to experiment group 1 (P < 0.001). Sleep quality also improved significantly in both experiment groups, with experiment group 2 demonstrating superior outcomes in sleep quality, duration, daytime dysfunction, and total PSQI score (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The Benson relaxation technique and dynamic-static combined relaxation therapy are effective in reducing fatigue and improving sleep quality in breast cancer chemotherapy patients, with the dynamic-static combined relaxation therapy offering greater benefits.

      "abstract": "UNLABELLED: Background/ Objective: Due to the impact of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection on personal and social life, people living with HIV (PLWH) are faced with several challenges and issues. Therefore, PLWH requires psychological interventions. The study aims were to create a suitable platform for psychological structures that empower them to address their issues effectively. In this regard, we evaluated the effect of Mindfulness-based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) and Silva-based Relaxation Therapy (SBRT) on Psychological Capital (PsyCap), Social Anxiety (SA), and CD4 count in PLWH. METHODS: This study employed an intervention-based semi-experimental design. The population consisted of 90 individuals infected with HIV. Participants were divided into two experimental groups receiving MBCT and SBRT, respectively, and one control group, selected randomly. Before and after the intervention, questionnaires and CD4+ tests were administered to the participants. Only two experimental groups received the intervention, while the control group received no training. The appropriate training for each group was conducted twice a week over eight sessions and each session lasted 90 minutes. In the intervention groups, all the people participated in all the group training sessions. No intervention was performed for the participants of the control group, and they only completed the questionnaires in the same period as the intervention groups. \"Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy\" and \"Mind Control\" books were used for the implementation of MBCT and SBRT, respectively. RESULTS: It was revealed that a number of male participants constituted the majority with 58 (64.4%) compared to females. Regarding the means of transmission, sexual contact was the most common with 62 (68.8%) compared to other routes. The mean age of the participants was 40.5 ± 10.8 years. For the SBRT group, the mean CD4+ count was higher, with 599.5 ± 290.9 for pretest and 563.2 ± 366.7 for post-test assessments, compared to other groups. After performing the linear regression analysis, it was found that the variables had no effect on the main outcome, which is CD4 count after the intervention (p-value= 0.27). For the MBCT group, the CD4+ count variable had a p-value = 0.10 (pretest: 447.2 ± 19.5, posttest: 411.9 ± 235.9), for the SBRT group, the CD4+ count variable had a p-value = 0.05 (pretest: 599.5 ± 290.9, posttest: 549 ± 259.9), and the control group, the CD4+ count variable had a p-value = 0.5 (pretest: 445 ± 222.7, posttest: 563.2 ± 366.7). CONCLUSION: MBCT and SBRT may enhance the mental well-being of PLWH. Therefore, following the interventions, the mean level of SA decreased, and PsyCap increased. Thus, strategies to improve psychological support interventions may have a significant impact on improving the health status of individuals living with HIV, including indicators of SA and PsyCap."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To study the value of music therapy and relaxation therapy in reducing the incidence of agitation during recovery from anesthesia in children. METHODS: A total of 76 children in our hospital (anesthesia recovery period, 2019.3-2021.4) were selected as research objects, their medical records were retrospectively analyzed, and they were grouped according to the intervention plans. Children who received routine anesthesia recovery intervention were included in the control group . The children who received music therapy and relaxation therapy were included in the observation group. The changes of nasopharyngeal cavity temperature, heart rate, mean arterial pressure and pulse oxygen saturation of children were compared between the two groups, and the residence time in the resuscitation room, awakening time, occurrence of agitation during the awakening period, agitation score and occurrence of adverse events of children between the two groups were compared. RESULTS: The heart rate and mean arterial pressure of the children in the observation group were lower than those of the control group 15 minutes after entering the room (T2), immediately after extubation (T3), and 15 minutes after extubation (T4), while their pulse oxygen saturation was significantly higher than that of the control group, with P < .05. The residence time and awakening time of children included in the observation group were shorter than those in the control group, with P < .05. The incidence of agitation during the recovery period and the agitation scores at each time point after entering the room in the observation group were lower than those in the control group, with P < .05. There was no significant difference in the incidence of adverse events between groups, with P > .05. CONCLUSION: The combined application of music therapy and relaxation therapy in children during anesthesia recovery can reduce the risk of the occurrence of agitation during recovery, stabilize the vital signs of children, and reduce the incidence of adverse events."

      "abstract": "Postural control (PC) and sleep are critical in several aspects of health. Poor sleep negatively influences PC and balance, which is necessary for performing various tasks, from reaching to mobility. Moreover, sleep disturbances and consequent PC and balance deterioration are associated with job accidents, traffic accidents, falls, and injuries. Healthy adults who have inadequate sleep show a decline in optimal functioning, even in the absence of medical illnesses. This suggests that getting enough sleep, both in duration and quality, is essential to maintain optimal health. Moreover, inadequate sleep has also been observed to have a bidirectional relationship with stress levels. However, there is insufficient evidence regarding the impact of non-pharmacological treatments to improve PC, sleep, and stress in the sedentary young adult (YA) population. This article describes the protocol for a study to investigate the effects of sensorimotor training and relaxation therapy on various static and dynamic PC tests, balance measures, and subjective and objective indices of sleep and stress among sedentary YAs with impaired sleep quality. The protocol is also designed to evaluate the effect of these therapies on fatigue, salivary cortisol levels, anxiety, and depression. Methods for assessing the sleep architecture, static and dynamic PC, balance, and stress are described along with the methods of scoring with the primary goal of providing a standardized set of assessment and scoring procedures according to the latest guidelines and gold-standard techniques and measures that can be used reliably at different laboratories. © 2024 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

      "abstract": "IMPORTANCE: Human milk feeding is a key public health goal to optimize infant and maternal/parental health, but global lactation outcomes do not meet recommended duration and exclusivity. There are connections between lactation and mental health. OBJECTIVE: To appraise all available evidence on whether the provision of relaxation interventions to lactating individuals improves lactation and well-being. DATA SOURCES: Embase, MEDLINE, CINAHL, Allied and Complementary Medicine Database, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library were searched on September 30, 2023, and topic experts were consulted. STUDY SELECTION: Two independent reviewers screened for eligibility. Inclusion criteria were full-text, peer-reviewed publications with a randomized clinical trial design. Techniques that were entirely physical (eg, massage) were excluded. A total of 7% of initially identified studies met selection criteria. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Two independent reviewers extracted data and assessed risk of bias with the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2 tool. Fixed-effects meta-analysis and Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations guidelines were used to synthesize and present evidence. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Prespecified primary outcomes were human milk quantity, length and exclusivity of human milk feeding, milk macronutrients/cortisol, and infant growth and behavior. RESULTS: A total of 16 studies were included with 1871 participants (pooled mean [SD] age for 1656 participants, 29.6 [6.1] years). Interventions were music, guided relaxation, mindfulness, and breathing exercises/muscle relaxation. Provision of relaxation was not associated with a change in human milk protein (mean difference [MD], 0 g/100 mL; 95% CI, 0; 205 participants). Provision of relaxation was associated with an increase in human milk quantity (standardized mean difference [SMD], 0.73; 95% CI, 0.57-0.89; 464 participants), increased infant weight gain in breastfeeding infants (MD, z score change = 0.51; 95% CI, 0.30-0.72; 226 participants), and a slight reduction in stress and anxiety (SMD stress score, -0.49; 95% CI, -0.70 to -0.27; 355 participants; SMD anxiety score, -0.45; 95% CI, -0.67 to -0.22; 410 participants). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Results of this systematic review and meta-analysis suggest that provision of relaxation was associated with an increase in human milk quantity and infant weight gain and a slight reduction in stress and anxiety. Relaxation interventions can be offered to lactating parents who would like to increase well-being and improve milk supply or, where directly breastfeeding, increase infant weight gain.",

      "abstract": "CONTEXT: The diagnosis of oral squamous cell carcinoma [OSCC] and its treatment phase is emotionally demanding for the patient and challenging for the surgeon. The induction of stress and anxiety is unavoidable in these patients. It becomes very important for the patient to have psychological as well as physical stability during this treatment phase. Various studies have reported the beneficial effect of meditation along with relaxation therapy on healthy individuals but the beneficial effect of meditation and relaxation therapy [MRT] to reduce stress and anxiety preoperatively in OSCC patients has not been reported in scientific literature. AIM: The aim of this study was to study the effect of MRT on preoperative anxiety and stress in OSCC patients undergoing for oral and maxillofacial surgery. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: An experimental, parallel study design was carried out with randomization of patients into experimental[25] and control group[25] with allocation ratio 1:1 in 50 patients diagnosed with OSCC [stage II or III] scheduled for oral and maxillofacial surgery with general anesthesia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The biopsy which was the prerequisite for the diagnosis was taken. Twenty-one days before surgery in experimental group, patients were oriented about meditation and relaxation exercises. The reorientation of MRT was done from the day of admission twice a day till the day of surgery. Physiological parameters for stress and anxiety like heart rate [HR], blood pressure [BP], pulse rate [PR], and respiratory rate [RR] were evaluated on 1st day of MRT at 9 am and on the day of surgery. The serum cortisol which was quantitative parameter for stress was evaluated 1st day of MRT at 9 am fasting and on the day of surgery. The qualitative analysis for anxiety was done preoperatively using visual analog scale on the 1st day before MRT and compared with the values on the day of surgery after MRT at a specific time. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Paired t-test analysis was used intragroup whereas unpaired t-test was used intergroup between experimental and control groups with significance at P = 0.05 and highly significant at P = 0.0001. RESULTS: The serum cortisol was significantly less in the experimental group over control group with t = 7.04 and P = 0.0001. The systolic and diastolic BP, pulse rate, respiratory rate, and anxiety in the experimental group reported significantly less rate compared to the control group with t = 5.66, t = 22.2, t = 11.93, t = 27.71, and P = 0.0001. CONCLUSION: In our study, MRT in the form of Sukhasana, Anulom Vilom, Omkar chanting, and Shavasana for 30 min twice daily has shown positive effect to reduce stress and anxiety. The serum cortisol as a quantitative parameter has been effectively evaluated in this benchmark study."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Persecutory delusions are a major psychiatric problem that often do not respond sufficiently to standard pharmacological or psychological treatments. We developed a new brief automated virtual reality (VR) cognitive treatment that has the potential to be used easily in clinical services. We aimed to compare VR cognitive therapy with an alternative VR therapy (mental relaxation), with an emphasis on understanding potential mechanisms of action. METHODS: THRIVE was a parallel-group, single-blind, randomised controlled trial across four UK National Health Service trusts in England. Participants were included if they were aged 16 years or older, had a persistent (at least 3 months) persecutory delusion held with at least 50% conviction, reported feeling threatened when outside with other people, and had a primary diagnosis from the referring clinical team of a non-affective psychotic disorder. We randomly assigned (1:1) patients to either THRIVE VR cognitive therapy or VR mental relaxation, using a permuted blocks algorithm with randomly varying block size, stratified by severity of delusion. Usual care continued for all participants. Each VR therapy was provided in four sessions over approximately 4 weeks, supported by an assistant psychologist or clinical psychologist. Trial assessors were masked to group allocation. Outcomes were assessed at 0, 2 (therapy mid-point), 4 (primary endpoint, end of treatment), 8, 16, and 24 weeks. The primary outcome was persecutory delusion conviction, assessed by the Psychotic Symptoms Rating Scale (PSYRATS; rated 0-100%). Outcome analyses were done in the intention-to-treat population. We assessed the treatment credibility and expectancy of the interventions and the two mechanisms (defence behaviours and safety beliefs) that the cognitive intervention was designed to target. This trial is prospectively registered with the ISRCTN registry, ISRCTN12497310. FINDINGS: From Sept 21, 2018, to May 13, 2021 (with a pause due to COVID-19 pandemic restrictions from March 16, 2020, to Sept 14, 2020), we recruited 80 participants with persistent persecutory delusions (49 [61%] men, 31 [39%] women, with a mean age of 40 years [SD 13, range 18-73], 64 [80%] White, six [8%] Black, one [1%] Indian, three [4%] Pakistani, and six [8%] other race or ethnicity). We randomly assigned 39 (49%) participants assigned to VR cognitive therapy and 41 (51%) participants to VR mental relaxation. 33 (85%) participants who were assigned to VR cognitive therapy attended all four sessions, and 35 (85%) participants assigned to VR mental relaxation attended all four sessions. We found no significant differences between the two VR interventions in participant ratings of treatment credibility (adjusted mean difference -1·55 [95% CI -3·68 to 0·58]; p=0·15) and outcome expectancy (-0·91 [-3·42 to 1·61]; p=0·47). 77 (96%) participants provided follow-up data at the primary timepoint. Compared with VR mental relaxation, VR cognitive therapy did not lead to a greater improvement in persecutory delusions (adjusted mean difference -2·16 [-12·77 to 8·44]; p=0·69). Compared with VR mental relaxation, VR cognitive therapy did not lead to a greater reduction in use of defence behaviours (adjusted mean difference -0·71 [-4·21 to 2·79]; p=0·69) or a greater increase in belief in safety (-5·89 [-16·83 to 5·05]; p=0·29). There were 17 serious adverse events unrelated to the trial (ten events in seven participants in the VR cognitive therapy group and seven events in five participants in the VR mental relaxation group). INTERPRETATION: The two VR interventions performed similarly, despite the fact that they had been designed to affect different mechanisms. Both interventions had high uptake rates and were associated with large improvements in persecutory delusions but it cannot be determined that the treatments accounted for the change. Immersive technologies hold promise for the treatment of severe mental health problems. However, their use will likely benefit from experimental research on the application of different therapeutic techniques and the effects on a range of potential mechanisms of action.

      "abstract": "We evaluate the value of progressive muscle relaxation (PMR) for patients with lumbar disc herniation after surgery based on a difference-in-differences model. A total of 128 patients with lumbar disc herniation who underwent surgery were randomly assigned to undergo either conventional intervention (conventional intervention group, n = 64) or conventional intervention combined with PMR (PMR group, n = 64). Perioperative anxiety level, stress level and lumbar function were compared between the two groups and compared pain between the two groups before and 1 week and 1 and 3 months after surgery. After 3 months, no one was lost to follow-up. At 1 day before surgery and 3 days after surgery, Self-rating Anxiety Scale score in the PMR group was significantly lower than that in the conventional intervention group (P < 0.05). At 30 min before surgery, heart rate and systolic blood pressure in the PMR group were significantly lower than those in the conventional intervention group (P < 0.05). After intervention, the scores of subjective symptoms, clinical signs and restrictions on activities of daily living were significantly higher in the PMR group than those in the conventional intervention group (all P < 0.05). Visual Analogue Scale score in the PMR group was significantly lower than that in the conventional intervention group (all P < 0.05). The amplitude of change in VAS score in the PMR group was greater than that in the conventional intervention group (P < 0.05). PMR can relieve perioperative anxiety and stress in patients with lumbar disc herniation, reduce postoperative pain and improve lumbar function.",

      "abstract": "Several randomised controlled trials (RCT) have demonstrated the superiority of transdiagnostic group cognitive-behavioural therapy (TD-CBT) to treatment as usual (TAU) for emotional disorders in primary care. To date, however, no RCTs have been conducted to compare TD-CBT to another active intervention in this setting. Our aim is to conduct a single-blind RCT to compare group TD-CBT plus TAU to progressive muscle relaxation (PMR) plus TAU in adults (age 18 to 65 years) with a suspected emotional disorder. We expect that TD-CBT + TAU will be more cost-effective than TAU + PMR, and that these gains will be maintained at the 12-month follow-up. Seven therapy sessions (1.5 hours each) will be offered over a 24-week period. The study will be carried out at four primary care centres in Cantabria, Spain. The study will take a societal perspective. Psychological assessments will be made at three time points: baseline, post-treatment, and at 12-months. The following variables will be evaluated: clinical symptoms (anxiety, depression, and/or somatic); functioning; quality of life (QoL); cognitive-emotional factors (rumination, worry, attentional and interpretative biases, emotion regulation and meta-cognitive beliefs); and satisfaction with treatment. Data on health service use, medications, and sick days will be obtained from electronic medical records. Primary outcome measures will include: incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER) and incremental cost-utility ratios (ICURs). Secondary outcome measures will include: clinical symptoms, QoL, functioning, and treatment satisfaction. Bootstrap sampling will be used to assess uncertainty of the results. Secondary moderation and mediation analyses will be conducted. Two questionnaires will be administered at sessions 1, 4, and 7 to assess therapeutic alliance and group satisfaction. If this trial is successful, widespread application of this cost-effective treatment could greatly improve access to psychological treatment for emotional disorders in the context of increasing demand for mental healthcare in primary care.

This systematic review (SR) was conducted to find the impact of RT on PMS management, which could be utilized in clinical and community populations. Five major databases like Google Scholar, PubMed, ResearchGate, Scopus, and Web of Science were used as search engines. The Joanna Briggs Institute checklist is used to analyze the quality of articles selected for this review. Only 35 different studies among 71 relevant articles which focused on the topic were selected for this SR. All of the 35 different trials reported that the selected RTs, namely Laura Mitchell, Jacobson, Benson, relaxation unnamed, yoga, aerobic exercise, and massage, significantly decreased PMS. The outcome of this SR suggests that the selected seven RTs effectively relieve PMS and ensure a productive life for all reproductive women."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Maternal stress is one modifiable variable that could influence mother-infant signaling and negatively affect breastfeeding and infant growth. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to test the hypothesis that relaxation therapy would reduce maternal stress and improve infant growth, behavior, and breastfeeding outcomes after late preterm (LP) and early-term (ET) delivery. METHODS: A single-blind randomized controlled trial was conducted in healthy Chinese primiparous mother-infant pairs after LP or ET delivery (34+0-37+6 gestation weeks). Mothers were randomly assigned to the intervention group (IG, listening to relaxation meditation at least once a day) or control group (CG, normal care). Primary outcomes-changes in maternal stress (perceived stress scale), anxiety (Beck Anxiety Inventory), and infant weight and length standard deviation score-were assessed at 1 wk and 8 wks postpartum. Secondary outcomes-breast milk energy and macronutrient composition, maternal breastfeeding attitudes, infant behaviors (3-d diary), and 24-hour milk intake-were assessed at 8 wks. RESULTS: In total, 96 mother-infant pairs were recruited. There was a significantly greater reduction in maternal perceived stress (Perceived Stress Scale score) (mean difference [MD] = 2.65; 95% CI: 0.8, 4.5) and significantly greater infant weight standard deviation score gain (MD = 0.51; 95% CI: 0.2, 0.9) from 1 wk to 8 wks in the IG than those in the CG. Exploratory analyses showed a significant interaction between intervention and sex, with greater effects on weight gain in female infants. Mothers of female infants used the intervention more frequently with significantly higher milk energy observed at 8 wks. CONCLUSIONS: The relaxation meditation tape is a simple, effective practical tool that could easily be used in clinical settings to support breastfeeding mothers after LP and ET delivery. The findings need confirmation in larger groups and in other populations.",

The aim of this study was to find out the effect of adding aerobic exercise (5 sessions per week) to the daily application of a 40-minute Benson's relaxation therapy (BRT) (diaphragmatic breathing and progressive muscle relaxation applied for 20 minutes in the morning and evening) on Glasgow dyspepsia severity score (GDSS), cortisol, visual analogue scale (VAS) (for abdominal symptoms), estradiol (one of the endogenous estrogens), Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI), and 42-item depression, anxiety, and stress scales (DASS-42) in 60 perimenopausal women with FD. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Women who consumed a daily dose of pantoprazole (40 mg tablet administered as a proton pump inhibitor drug) were randomly assigned to an 8-week study group (this group received aerobic exercise plus BRT, N=30) or an 8-week control group (this group received BRT only, N=30). RESULTS: Significant improvements were reported in all measured variables within women groups (except estradiol of the control group). Compared to the control group, the reported within-group significant improvements in GDSS, cortisol, VAS, PSQI, and DASS-42 were higher in the study group. CONCLUSIONS: Significant improvements in GDSS, cortisol, VAS, PSQI, and DASS-42 could be achieved after adding adjunctive therapies - aerobic exercise and BRT - to the medications of FD in perimenopausal women. Compared to BRT alone, physical exercise plus BRT significantly increases the levels of estradiol in perimenopausal women with FD.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a debilitating psychiatric disorder which affects up to 3% of children and adolescents. OCD in children and adolescents is generally treated with cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), which, in more severely affected patients, can be combined with antidepressant medication. The TECTO trial aims to compare the benefits and harms of family-based CBT (FCBT) versus family-based psychoeducation/relaxation training (FPRT) in children and adolescents aged 8 to 17 years. This statistical analysis plan outlines the planned statistical analyses for the TECTO trial. METHODS: The TECTO trial is an investigator-initiated, independently funded, single-centre, parallel-group, superiority randomised clinical trial. Both groups undergo 14 sessions of 75 min each during a period of 16 weeks with either FCBT or FPRT depending on the allocation. Participants are randomised stratified by age and baseline Children's Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (CY-BOCS) score. The primary outcome is the CY-BOCS score. Secondary outcomes are health-related quality of life assessed using KIDSCREEN-10 and adverse events assessed by the Negative Effects Questionnaire (NEQ). Primary and secondary outcomes are assessed at the end of the intervention. Continuous outcomes will be analysed using linear regression adjusted for the stratification variables and baseline value of the continuous outcome. Dichotomous outcomes will be analysed using logistic regression adjusted for the stratification variables. The statistical analyses will be carried out by two independent blinded statisticians. DISCUSSION: This statistical analysis plan includes a detailed predefined description of how data will be analysed and presented in the main publication before unblinding of study data. Statistical analysis plans limit selective reporting bias. This statistical analysis plan will increase the validity of the final trial results. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03595098.

Results showed participants who received the HRT-WB intervention experienced improvements in subjective well-being as well as reductions in psychological distress. At endpoint, 71% of the participants who completed the HRT-WB intervention were categorized as experiencing high levels of well-being, or flourishing. In addition, HRT-WB is a feasible intervention, with high rates of retention, compliance with home practice, and satisfaction.

MATERIAL AND METHODS A total of 312 patients were recruited and randomly divided into 2 groups. In the intervention group, the RNAO pain-management technique of JRT was adopted, while the control group received the standard institutional nursing management. Pain scores after the operation, according to the Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) combined with the Wong-Baker Faces Pain Rating Scale and Short-Form McGill Pain Questionnaire, were compared between the 2 groups. Nursing satisfaction was compared as well. RESULTS At 6, 24, and 72 h after the operation, the NRS scores combined with the Wong-Baker Faces Pain Rating Scale in the intervention group were significantly lower than those in the control group (P<0.001); 72 h after the operation, the Pain Rating Index, Visual Analogue Scale, present pain intensity, and total scores for the intervention group were significantly lower than those for the control group (P<0.001 for all 4 scores). The scores reported from the patients for nursing response and consequent care (P<0.001), nursing competence (P=0.029), and surgical pain-control satisfaction (P<0.001) in the intervention group were also significantly higher than those in the control group. CONCLUSIONS JRT can improve postoperative pain-control and nursing satisfaction in patients with malignant bone and soft-tissue tumors.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: This study aimed to investigate the effect of relaxation therapy on hypoxia during intravenous propofol anesthesia in patients with pre-operative anxiety. METHODS: Two-hundred and eighty patients were randomly categorized in the experimental group (relaxation therapy group) and control group. The Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (S-STAI) was administered 30 to 60 min pre-operatively to assess the patient's current anxiety status and select appropriate patients. Patients in the experimental group received pre-surgical relaxation therapy. Decrease in oxygen saturation during the procedure was recorded for each patient group, and the relevant data were compared between the two groups. RESULTS: The basic S-STAI scores of the experimental and control groups were 56.88 ± 2.91 and 57.27 ± 3.56, respectively (p = 0.331). The difference was not statistically significant. The incidence of hypoxia in the experimental group during painless artificial abortion [routine blood oxygen saturation (SpO2) <95%, duration >15 s] decreased from 30 to 12.3%. CONCLUSION: Relaxation therapy may effectively reduce the incidence of hypoxia during painless artificial abortion by using less dose of propofol. It may help patients relieve their anxiety and improve perioperative safety. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (ChiCTR2000032109)."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is the recommended first-line treatment for children and adolescents with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), but evidence concerning treatment-specific benefits and harms compared with other interventions is limited. Furthermore, high risk-of-bias in most trials prevent firm conclusions regarding the efficacy of CBT. We investigate the benefits and harms of family-based CBT (FCBT) versus family-based psychoeducation and relaxation training (FPRT) in youth with OCD in a trial designed to reduce risk-of-bias. METHODS: This is an investigator-initiated, independently funded, single-centre, parallel group superiority randomised clinical trial (RCT). Outcome assessors, data managers, statisticians, and conclusion drawers are blinded. From child and adolescent mental health services we include patients aged 8-17 years with a primary OCD diagnosis and an entry score of ≥16 on the Children's Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (CY-BOCS). We exclude patients with comorbid illness contraindicating trial participation; intelligence quotient < 70; or treatment with CBT, PRT, antidepressant or antipsychotic medication within the last 6 months prior to trial entry. Participants are randomised 1:1 to the experimental intervention (FCBT) versus the control intervention (FPRT) each consisting of 14 75-min sessions. All therapists deliver both interventions. Follow-up assessments occur in week 4, 8 and 16 (end-of-treatment). The primary outcome is OCD symptom severity assessed with CY-BOCS at end-of-trial. Secondary outcomes are quality-of-life and adverse events. Based on sample size estimation, a minimum of 128 participants (64 in each intervention group) are included. DISCUSSION: In our trial design we aim to reduce risk-of-bias, enhance generalisability, and broaden the outcome measures by: 1) conducting an investigator-initiated, independently funded RCT; 2) blinding investigators; 3) investigating a representative sample of OCD patients; 3) using an active control intervention (FPRT) to tease apart general and specific therapy effects; 4) using equal dosing of interventions and therapist supervision in both intervention groups; 5) having therapists perform both interventions decided by randomisation; 6) rating fidelity of both interventions; 7) assessing a broad range of benefits and harms with repeated measures. The primary study limitations are the risk of missing data and the inability to blind participants and therapists to the intervention.

Through open recruitment and following the principle of voluntary and confidential, 80 college students were selected from our school, and then they were divided into two groups: the control group (40 cases) and the observation group (40 cases). The observation group received acceptance and commitment therapy combined with music relaxation therapy. For the control group, conventional mental health interventions were administered. Two months after intervention, psychological status, mental resilience, and quality of life scores were compared between the two groups. Before intervention, there was no significant difference in SAS and SDS scores between the two groups (P > 0.05). After intervention, SAS and SDS scores were significantly higher than those in the control group, and the difference between the two groups was statistically significant (P < 0.05). Before intervention, there was no significant difference in the scores of toughness, strength, and optimism between the two groups (P > 0.05). After intervention, the scores of toughness, strength, and optimism in the two groups were all improved, and the scores of mental resilience in the observation group were higher than those in the control group, with statistical significance (P < 0.05). Before intervention, there was no significant difference in the quality of life scores between the observation group and the control group (P > 0.05). After intervention, the quality of life score of the observation group was higher than that of the control group, and the difference between the two groups was statistically significant (P < 0.05). The combined application of acceptance and commitment therapy and music relaxation therapy can help college students to improve their mental state, improve their mental resilience, enhance their evaluation of life quality, improve their sense of self-identity, and reduce the probability of the occurrence of unhealthy emotions such as depression.",

It is a difficult-to-treat disorder because its exact causes are unknown. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to examine the effect of progressive muscle relaxation therapy (PMRT) on pain, fatigue, and stress in patients with fibromyalgia syndrome. METHODS: Thirty-seven patients with fibromyalgia syndrome (age: 20-65 years) were randomly allocated to the PMRT group (n1= 18, 2 men and 16 women) or non-PMRT group (n2= 19, 2 men and 17 women). The PMRT group received PMRT twice a week for 8 weeks and the non-PMRT group received conventional physical therapies such as electro-stimulation and heat therapies during this period. The outcome was evaluated before and after 8 week sofintervention using the Visual Analogue Scale, Multidimensional Assessment of Fatigue, Perceived Stress Scale, and measurement of the blood pressure and pulse rate. RESULTS: Pain and fatigue significantly decreased in the PMRT group compared with the non-PMRT group (both P< 0.001). In addition, perceived stress (P< 0.001), systolic blood pressure (P< 0.001), diastolic blood pressure (P< 0.05), and pulse rate (P< 0.001) significantly decreased in the PMRT group compared with the non-PMRT group. CONCLUSIONS: The findings indicate that progressive muscle relaxation therapy is a viable rehabilitative therapy for pain, fatigue, and stress symptoms in patients with fibromyalgia syndrome.",

However, due to the influence of surgical trauma, anesthesia and other perioperative stress factors, patients may have complications. Among them, postoperative fatigue syndrome (POFS) is a common complication. Traditional Chinese medicine or integrated traditional Chinese and Western medicine have been proved to be effective in improving postoperative fatigue. METHODS: : This study is a randomized controlled trial. One hundred eighty Chinese patients with POFS of LDH will be randomly divided into control group, experimental group 1, experimental group 2 and experimental group 3 according to the ratio of 1:1:1:1. The patients in the control group will be treated with conventional treatment after operation, the patients in the experimental group 1 will be treated with acupoint massage, the patients in the experimental group 2 will be treated with relaxation therapy, and the patients in the experimental group 3 will be treated with acupoint massage combined with relaxation therapy. The whole treatment will last for 5 days. The main outcome measures will be fatigue visual analogue scale and identity-consequence fatigue scale, and the secondary outcome measures will be hospital anxiety and depression scale. DISCUSSION: : This study is to observe the effects of acupoint massage comblined with relaxation therapy on reducing postoperative fatigue of lumbar disc herniation surgical patients.

AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: Aim of the study to evaluate the effect of progressive muscle relaxation therapy on fatigue and psychological distress in Cancer patients during Radiotherapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study design was single blinded randomized control trial. Total of 50 patients, for both intervention and control group 25 patients were included. The intervention group patients received P.M.R. therapy of 20 min. given for 3 times/week of total period of 3 weeks, whereas the control group received conventional treatment with no added intervention. Fatigue symptom inventory and hospital anxiety and depression scale used as an outcome measures. RESULTS: Paired t-test used for FSI to compare among intervention and control group and results were showing statistical significant difference (P < 0.05), similarly pre and post improvement was observed in both the groups for HADS. Between group comparison showed no superior improvement one over the other. CONCLUSION: Based on the above findings, P.M.R. and conventional treatment were similarly efficacious in decreasing fatigue and psychological distress related to cancer patients who were hospitalized undergoing radiotherapy."

The experimental groups did not differ in their outcome measures at T3.Conclusion: PRT appears to be an effective solution in the psychological care of chronic pain. The effectiveness of this type of intervention seems to have been underestimated. The addition of ACT sessions did not significantly impact the results, indicating that both designs of interventions are effective in the short term.",

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: Cancer survivors may experience sleep disturbances during and after their cancer treatments. While pharmacological approaches are commonly used to address sleep disturbances, they may have a number of adverse effects. This review studied the effect of two non-pharmacological interventions (massage and relaxation therapy) on sleep disturbances in cancer survivors. METHODS: A search for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) was conducted on PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, PEDro, and CINAHL using relevant keywords. RESULTS: The search yielded 371 articles, with 4 RCTs studying massage therapy and 3 RCTs studying relaxation therapy included for qualitative analysis. Massage therapy studies showed statistically significant improvement in self-reported sleep questionnaires and objectively recorded long sleep episodes, as assessed via an accelerometer. No significant improvements in sleep outcomes were observed in the relaxation therapy studies, although there were trends for improved self-reported sleep quality. CONCLUSION: While massage therapy provided by massage therapists may have some potential for improving sleep outcomes for cancer survivors, there is no such current evidence regarding relaxation therapy. IMPLICATIONS FOR CANCER SURVIVORS: Cancer survivors who experience sleep disturbances may benefit from regular sessions with a massage therapist. However, future studies should examine the long-term feasibility of massage therapist-delivered services, particularly for cancer survivors with limited finances, and determine if benefits can be obtained if massage is provided by non-certified individuals. Relaxation therapy appears to be safe for cancer survivors, but future RCTs involving larger sample sizes need to be conducted to better determine its feasibility and efficacy.",

METHODS: Of the 221 outpatients with MUS using BZD, 42 received relaxation therapy. Change in BZD use was compared using a relaxation group (n = 42) and a control group that had 84 MUS patients whose baseline was matched by optimal matching algorithms. Logistic regression analysis was done to evaluate the effect of BZD-dependent factors on the BZD dose of the relaxation group. RESULTS: Compared with the control group, the number of patients who decreased the amount of BZD and the number of patients whose subjective symptoms of MUS improved were significantly higher in the relaxation group (p < 0.05). In addition, a factor that made it difficult to reduce the BZD of MUS patients who had undergone relaxation was a long history of BZD use, for more than 6 months (odds ratio, 0.06, 95% confidence interval, 0.01-0.36). CONCLUSIONS: Relaxation therapy for patients with MUS may help reduce BZD use; however, early intervention is important to prevent BZD dependence."

In addition, eight trials compared relaxation therapy with no treatment, waiting list, or minimal treatment and showed that the relaxation group reported lower levels of self-reported depression scores postintervention (SMD = -0.57; 95% CI, -0.98 to -0.15). Therefore, this meta-analysis showed that relaxation might reduce depressive symptoms, and the effect is not worse than that of psychotherapy.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Breastfeeding is of great importance for infant health both short and long term, especially for those born preterm. Apart from the socio-economic and cultural factors which may influence a mother's decision on breastfeeding, lactation performance is also influenced by maternal physiological and psychological condition, as well as infant behavioural factors. The aim of this project is to investigate physiological, psychological and anthropological aspects of 'signalling' between mother and infant during lactation in a stressful situation, following late preterm delivery, using an experimental approach. METHOD: A single blind parallel randomised controlled trial will be conducted in Chinese primiparous mothers who deliver a infant (34 0/7-37 6/7) weeks and plan to exclusively breastfeed. Mothers will be recruited from four local community clinics attached to Beijing Children Hospital. Two home visits will be arranged at one week and eight weeks postpartum. Participants will be randomly assigned to either intervention arm or control (no intervention) before the first home visit. Mothers from the intervention group will be asked to listen to an audio recording with relaxation meditation daily during breastfeeding. Maternal stress and anxiety will be measured at one week and eight week postpartum using Chinese version of Cohen's Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) and Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI). Infant weight and length gain (as SD scores) from one to eight week will be measured using anthropometry. Milk volume will be measured using 48-h test-weighing method. Breast milk samples and mother and infant's stool samples will be collected to measure macronutrient and microbiome content. Anthropometric measurements (weight, length and head circumference) will be performed during all home visits. DISCUSSION: Primary outcomes of this study will be the effect of the intervention on maternal psychological state, and infant growth. Other outcomes will include the effect of the intervention on milk production, infant behaviours, and the microbiome composition in breastmilk and maternal and infant's gut. Results of this study will provide greater understanding about maternal-infant factors which influence the success of breastfeeding, and which may then be useful targets for future interventions.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Tourette syndrome (TS) is a neurodevelopmental condition characterized by the presence of multiple motor and phonic tics, often associated with co-morbid behavioural problems. Tics can be modulated by environmental factors and are characteristically exacerbated by psychological stress, among other factors. This observation has led to the development of specific behavioural treatment strategies, including relaxation therapy. OBJECTIVE: This review aimed to assess the efficacy of relaxation therapy to control or reduce tic symptoms in patients with TS. METHODS: We conducted a systematic literature review of original studies on the major scientific databases, including Medline, EMBASE, and PsycInfo, according to the standards outlined in the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Outcomes measures included both tic severity and tic frequency. RESULTS: Our literature search identified three controlled trials, with a total number of 40 participants (range: 6-18 participants). In all three studies, relaxation therapy decreased the severity and/or the frequency of tic symptoms. However, the only trial comparing relaxation therapy to two other behavioural techniques found relaxation therapy to be the least effective intervention, as it reduced the number of tics by 32% compared to 44% with self-monitoring and 55% with habit reversal. DISCUSSION: The results of this systematic literature review provide initial evidence for the use of relaxation therapy as a behavioural treatment intervention for tics in patients with TS. Caution is needed in the interpretation of these findings, because the reviewed trials had small sample sizes and there was high heterogeneity across the study protocols.",

In this clinical trial, 72 office workers aged 20 to 50 years with chronic low back pain were randomized to one of four groups including; group 1, exercise therapy; group 2, psychotherapy (relaxation therapy); group 3, modified protocol (exercise therapy followed by relaxation therapy); group 4, control group (no intervention). Participants exercised 3 times weekly for 6 weeks for 40-45 min of exercise/relaxation. Pain intensity, ROM, anxiety, and QoL were evaluated at baseline, 6 weeks, and 12 weeks after the end of the intervention. Results showed significant decreases in pain intensity and anxiety in the three experimental groups compared to the control group. The three intervention groups indicated a significant decrease in pain intensity and anxiety after 6 and 12 weeks. ROM significantly improved in the exercise therapy and the modified protocol over time (after 6 and 12 weeks). A significant difference in QoL was found between the groups, with the greatest improvement found in the psychotherapy and modified protocol groups. This therapeutic package (including exercise movements and psychological interventions) was found to have a superior effect on pain intensity, ROM, anxiety, and QoL after 6 and 12 weeks compared to other interventions (only exercise and psychotherapy)."

METHOD: A qualitative study with a phenomenological approach and a Heideggerian theoretical-methodological reference based on the Creative and Sensitive Method, developed in the radiotherapy outpatient clinic of a public teaching hospital in the interior of São Paulo. The Heideggerian understanding was used for analyzing the data, which occurred in two stages: vague and medium understanding, and hermeneutics. RESULTS: Nine women between the ages of 45 and 67 participated in the study. The data allowed us to understand the meaning of guided imagery relaxation from the participants, since they could be classified into three units of meaning: cancer stigma, facing disease and treatment benefits. CONCLUSION: The meaning of guided imagery relaxation made it possible to understand the being-in-the-world during the provided reflections, and it is possible to verify the importance of the nurse's offer of therapy in caring for women with breast cancer.",

A total of 12 studies were included in the review and 7 in the meta-analysis. In total, 4 relaxation techniques were utilized in the included studies: Jaw relaxation, Benson's relaxation, progressive muscle relaxation (PMR) and systematic relaxation. Of the 12 included, 10 studies demonstrated statistically significant pain relief in the relaxation group as compared to the controls. The data of 422 patients in the relaxation group and 424 patients in the control group were pooled for a meta-analysis, which indicated that patients undergoing abdominal surgery had significantly greater pain relief following relaxation therapy as compared to the controls [random: standardized mean difference (SMD), -1.15; 95% CI, -2.04 to -0.26; P<0.00001). The overall quality of the studies was not high. On the whole, despite trials demonstrating the benefits of relaxation therapy for immediate pain relief in patients post-abdominal surgery, there is lack of high-quality scientific evidence substantiating its routine use. There is a need for more robust randomized control trials (RCTs) utilizing standardized relaxation protocols to provide further evidence on this subject."

Hypertensive patients who are resistant or non-adherent to antihypertensive drugs may be easier to manage if they choose alternative non-drug therapies for hypertension, based on this review. METHODS: P: Adults (>18 years), except pregnant women, with essential hypertension. I: Cupping, moxibustion, acupuncture, acupoint stimulation, yoga, meditation, tai chi, Qi gong, Chinese massage, massage, spinal manipulation, biofeedback, device-guided breathing therapy, aromatherapy, music therapy, and relaxation approaches. C: 1. No treatment. 2. Sham therapy. 3. Conventional treatment, including antihypertensive drugs and lifestyle modification (e.g., exercise). O: 1. Change in the incidence of cardiovascular death. 2. Change in the incidence of myocardial infarction. 3. Change in the incidence of stroke. 4. Change in blood pressure (BP). 5. Efficacy rate of BP lowering. 6. Adverse effects (review specific). S: Systematic reviews of randomized controlled trials, including meta-analyses and assessments of the methodological quality/risk of bias. INFORMATION SOURCES: Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects, Cochrane library, PubMed, Web of Science, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, and Chinese Scientific Journal Database were searched. The bibliographies of the included articles were also searched for relevant systematic reviews. GRADE criteria were used to rate the quality of evidence in systematic reviews considering 6 factors, including risk of bias. RESULTS: This review ultimately included 13 systematic reviews of 14 non-drug therapies (acupuncture, wet cupping, Baduanjin, blood letting, auricular acupuncture, music, massage, Qi gong, moxibustion, relaxation therapies, biofeedback, device-guided breathing, yoga and tai chi) based on the inclusion criteria. The quality of evidence was generally low, and weak recommendations were given for most therapies except massage and acupuncture plus antihypertensive drug. Based on the analyzed evidence, massage and acupuncture plus antihypertensive drug could benefit people who want to lower their BP and do not have contraindications for massage and acupuncture plus antihypertensive drug. DISCUSSION/STRENGTH: The GRADE approach makes this review a unique reference for people who are considering the grade of quality of evidence in systematic reviews, the balance of desirable and undesirable consequences and the strength of recommendations to decide which intervention should be used to reduce BP. LIMITATIONS: Many non-drug therapies were excluded due to the low methodological quality of their systematic reviews, and only 14 therapies were evaluated in this review. As no patient-important outcomes were reviewed, surrogate outcomes were used to rate the strength of recommendations. This approach may cause a decrease in evidence quality according to GRADE, but we argue that this is appropriate in the context of this review.",

Some individuals are aware of feelings of comfort immediately after a relaxation therapy session. METHODS: Heart rate variability biofeedback (HRV-BF) therapy using a relaxation technique called resonant breathing was administered to 44 family caregivers who felt burdened by their work caring for family members with cancer. We prospectively evaluated how the level of comfort participants were aware of immediately after an initial therapy session affected their expectations regarding the therapy, as well as future quality of life (QOL) and autonomic function. This study was a secondary analysis of a randomized, open-label study titled \"Self-care system for family caregivers of cancer patients using resonant breathing with a portable home device\". RESULTS: Among the participants, 56.8% were aware of a feeling of comfort immediately after an initial therapy session. Participants were then divided into two groups according to the presence or absence of their awareness of comfort. Expectation levels regarding the therapy were significantly increased in the awareness group after the therapy session (P = 0.003). No main effect between groups was observed for heart rate variability (HRV) during therapy (P = 0.949). Four weeks after the initial therapy session, QOL improved and HRV increased in the awareness group (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Better outcomes in the awareness group were not associated with HRV during therapy. A feeling of comfort immediately after a therapy session may have positive effects on future QOL and autonomic function by raising participants' expectations of the therapy.

METHODS: A quasi-experimental study (measures before-after) was performed in 25 Primary Care patients with hypertension poorly controlled by pharmacological treatment. The intervention consisted of relaxation therapy composed of 3techniques: passive relaxation of Schwartz-Haynes, diaphragmatic breathing and imaginary visualization. A total of 14 group sessions of 30min each (2/week) were conducted. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure were taken at the beginning and end of the relaxation programme implemented and after each of the programme sessions. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality, Quality of Life Hypertension, State-Trait Anxiety and Perceived Stress questionnaires were used to measure psychosocial parameters. RESULTS: After intervention, a reduction in systolic blood pressure of 20mmHg (p<.001) and of 8mmHg (p<.001) in diastolic blood pressure was observed. Regarding other factors, sleep quality (p<.001), quality of life (p<.001) and state anxiety (p=.004) were significantly improved.

      "abstract": "The aims of this study were to compare circulating cytokines between FM and healthy controls and to investigate the effect on cytokine levels by 15 weeks of progressive resistance exercise or relaxation therapy in FM. Baseline plasma cytokine levels and clinical data were analyzed in 125 women with FM and 130 age-matched healthy women. The FM women were then randomized to progressive resistance exercise (n = 49) or relaxation (n = 43). Baseline IL-2, IL-6, TNF-α, IP-10, and eotaxin were higher in FM than in healthy controls (P < 0.041), whereas IL-1β was lower (P < 0.001). There were weak correlations between cytokine levels and clinical variables. After both interventions, IL-1ra had increased (P = 0.004), while IL-1β had increased in the relaxation group (P = 0.002). Changes of IFN-γ, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-17A were weakly correlated with changes of PPT, but there were no significant correlations between changes of cytokine and changes in other clinical variables. The elevated plasma levels of several cytokines supports the hypothesis that chronic systemic inflammation may underlie the pathophysiology of FM even if the relation to clinical variables was weak. However, 15 weeks of resistance exercise, as performed in this study, did not show any anti-inflammatory effect on neither FM symptoms nor clinical and functional variables. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01226784, registered October 21, 2010. The first patient was recruited October 28, 2010.",

RESULTS: Sixteen Randomized Control Trials (RCTs) were included for meta-analysis to determine the effect of relaxation therapy. The overall effect of relaxation therapy on symptom of anxiety was significant with Hedges' g=0.62 (95% CI: 0.42-0.81), which indicates a medium-high effect; heterogeneity was statistically significant with I2=48.84. Subgroup analysis exploring the possible causes of heterogeneity found that types of comparison of TAU and CBT was significant (Q=4.20, p=0.04). The effect of relaxation therapy on symptoms of depression, phobia, and worry was significant; Hedges' g=0.44 (95% CI: 0.30-0.59), 0.40 (95% CI: 0.06-0.75), 0.54 (95% CI: 0.28-0.79), respectively. CONCLUSION: The results of this study provide evidence for the effectiveness of relaxation therapy for people with anxiety disorders. Therefore, relaxation therapy can be selected as a useful intervention for reducing negative emotions in people with anxiety disorders.",

      "abstract": "Relaxation programs are known for their versatility, cost-effectiveness, and ability to help people obtain skills to regulate their mental states and promote and maintain health. Self-Active Relaxation Therapy (SART) is a body-oriented approach to psychological rehabilitation that grew out of the suite of movement tasks developed in the Japanese psychotherapy known as Dohsa-hou, or the body movement method. The program for SART is designed to stretch, twist, and release areas of the upper, lower, and whole body through a set of movements which are guided by the practitioner and performed \"self-actively\" by the client to empower them to learn to recognize points of tension in the body and act on their own to achieve a relaxed state. Numerous studies have showed that SART is associated with reduced negative mood states and enhanced body awareness. A short version of SART has been investigated as a psychological support salon activity for the elderly, mothers raising children, special needs students, and children adapting to school. The full program has also been applied in clinical settings to address or supplement treatments for psychological and developmental conditions, and longitudinally employed in community contexts to assist residents facing long-term disaster recovery circumstances in Japan. This paper reviews the research and applications of SART as a bodymind approach by critically examining evidence and research gaps for future studies, comparing it with techniques established in the literature, and positing a self-regulatory framework for SART as a tool to become aware of bodily states, regulate mood, and manage stress through the deliberate practice of relaxation."

DATA SOURCE: PubMed, Lilacs, Cochrane, Embase, Web of Science, Scopus and Cinahl, between August 2006 and December 2016. Descriptors: Postoperative Pain, Imagery (Psychotherapy) and Guided Imagery. STUDY SELECTION: original studies published in English, Spanish and Portuguese. 291 studies were identified and eight were selected. Descriptive data analysis, presented in detail, with a summary of the knowledge produced in each study. RESULTS: In the primary studies included, the use of guided imagery associated with other complementary therapies was highlighted: hand and foot \"M\" technique, education on postoperative pain management with analgesic drugs, relaxation exercises, respiration exercises, meditation, soothing biorhythmic music combined with positive and encouraging assertions and music with nature sounds. CONCLUSIONS: The knowledge synthesis resulting from this study indicates that evidence could be identified on the use of guided imagery associated with relaxation therapy as a complementary approach to drug analgesia in postoperative pain control strengthens its indication for nursing practice. This evidence, however, demonstrates that the quality of the use of this therapy is limited, and it is necessary to carry out new randomized clinical studies to fill the existing gaps in this topic.",

Thus, increased psychological distress can disrupt milk flow and in the long-term, affect milk synthesis. Conversely, it is possible that milk ejection could be improved by using relaxation therapy during breastfeeding. We performed a systematic review to evaluate the effectiveness of interventions using relaxation therapy to improve breastfeeding outcomes and to assess the consequent impact(s) on infant growth and behaviour. A literature search was performed using the PRISMA guidelines where we included intervention studies (including nonrandomised controlled studies) using relaxation therapy in breastfeeding mothers during the post-natal period. Out of 147 identified records at the initial search, 5 studies were eligible, of which 3 were randomised controlled trials and 2 were nonrandomised or quasi-experimental studies. These studies were conducted in Europe, America, and India and included 311 mother-infant pairs, of which 64 infants were full-term and 247 were premature infants. Relaxation therapy was shown to increase milk yield in mothers of preterm infants in 2 randomised trials, however, the milk sampling protocol for these studies could be questioned. None of the studies investigated the consequent effects on infant outcomes. Overall, limited evidence was found on the effectiveness of relaxation therapy on breast milk composition and infant outcomes. Experimental studies with better standardisation of protocol and robust methodological design are needed to investigate the effectiveness of relaxation therapy on both breastfeeding and infant growth and behavioural outcomes.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: It is not clear whether relaxation therapies are more or less effective than cognitive and behavioural therapies in the treatment of anxiety. The aims of the present study were to examine the effects of relaxation techniques compared to cognitive and behavioural therapies in reducing anxiety symptoms, and whether they have comparable efficacy across disorders. METHOD: We conducted a meta-analysis of 50 studies (2801 patients) comparing relaxation training with cognitive and behavioural treatments of anxiety. RESULTS: The overall effect size (ES) across all anxiety outcomes, with only one combined ES in each study, was g = -0.27 [95% confidence interval (CI) = -0.41 to -0.13], favouring cognitive and behavioural therapies (number needed to treat = 6.61). However, no significant difference between relaxation and cognitive and behavioural therapies was found for generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, social anxiety disorder and specific phobias (considering social anxiety and specific phobias separately). Heterogeneity was moderate (I2 = 52; 95% CI = 33-65). The ES was significantly associated with age (p < 0.001), hours of cognitive and/or behavioural therapy (p = 0.015), quality of intervention (p = 0.007), relaxation treatment format (p < 0.001) and type of disorder (p = 0.008), explaining an 82% of variance. CONCLUSIONS: Relaxation seems to be less effective than cognitive and behavioural therapies in the treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder, and obsessive-compulsive disorder and it might also be less effective at 1-year follow-up for panic, but there is no evidence that it is less effective for other anxiety disorders.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The physiological and psychological signalling between mother and infant during lactation is one of the prominent mother-infant factors that may influence breastfeeding outcomes. The infant can 'signal' his needs through vocalisation, and the mother can respond by allowing or restricting nipple access, which might alter the breast milk composition or volume. This may lead to parent-offspring conflict during the lactation period. Challenging infant behaviour has also been associated with maternal psychological distress, which might affect breastfeeding performance. Most attempts to improve breastfeeding rates focus on providing additional support, yet many aspects of the breastfeeding process are poorly understood. Thus, our objective is to investigate mother-infant signalling during breastfeeding by manipulating maternal psychological state using a relaxation therapy intervention. The study will test the hypothesis that mothers who listen to the therapy will be more relaxed/less stressed and this will favourably alter breast milk composition and/or affect milk volume and hence influence infant outcomes. METHODS: A randomised controlled trial will be conducted in first-time breastfeeding mothers and their new-born infants. Pregnant mothers will be recruited at antenatal clinics in Selangor, Malaysia, and four home visits will be carried out at 2, 6, 12 and 14 weeks postnatally. Participants will be randomised into a control and an intervention group in the early post-partum period. Mothers from the intervention group will be asked to listen daily to an audio recording with relaxation therapy during breastfeeding. Maternal psychological state, breastfeeding practices and infant behaviour will be assessed using validated questionnaires. Milk volume will be measured using stable isotopes. Breast milk samples will be collected to measure macronutrient content and hormone levels. Anthropometric measurements (weight, length and head circumference) will be performed during all home visits, including body composition at week 14. DISCUSSION: The main outcomes will be the effect of the intervention on maternal psychological state, milk production, cortisol levels, and infant behaviour and growth. Secondary outcomes will be associations between breast milk composition and infant appetite and growth. This study aims to provide a greater understanding of maternal-infant factors which influence breastfeeding outcomes and which may be useful targets for future interventions.

RESULTS: A total of 86 patients were recruited. Thirty-four patients completed mindfulness meditation and 27 patients completed relaxation therapy. Statistically significant improvement was seen in all outcome measures except the health status indicator in both treatment groups. The change in treatment scores was greater in the mindfulness meditation group than in the relaxation therapy group.

Several studies have investigated the association between MS and mental disorders such as depression and anxiety, and recently researchers have focused also on Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). This is the first study that investigates the usefulness of proposing a treatment for PTSD to patients with MS. METHODS: A randomized controlled trial with patients with MS diagnosed with PTSD comparing Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR; n = 20) and Relaxation Therapy (RT; n = 22). The primary outcome measure was the proportion of participants that no longer meet PTSD diagnosis as measured with Clinician Administered PTSD Scale 6-months after the treatment. RESULTS: The majority of patients were able to overcome their PTSD diagnosis after only 10 therapy sessions. EMDR treatment appears to be more effective than RT in reducing the proportion of patients with MS suffering from PTSD. Both treatments are effective in reducing PTSD severity, anxiety and depression symptoms, and to improve Quality of Life. CONCLUSION: Although our results can only be considered preliminary, this study suggests that it is essential that PTSD symptoms are detected and that brief and cost-effective interventions to reduce PTSD and associated psychological symptoms are offered to patients, in order to help them to reduce the psychological burden associated with their neurological condition.

Anxiety and depression states were evaluated by using a self-rating anxiety scale (SAS) and a self-rating depression scale (SDS) before and after treatment was administered. RESULTS: 1) The test group demonstrated a significant decrease in SAS and SDS scores (t = 2.855, P < 0.01; t = 2.777, P < 0.01). The control group showed a significant decrease in the SAS score (t = 1.831, P < 0.05) but failed to show a significant change in the depression score (t = 0.909, P > 0.05). 2) The test group yielded a higher percentage of remission indicated by the SDS scores than the control group (test group = 75.76%; control group = 60.61%; P < 0.05). The test group also displayed a higher percentage of remission indicated by the SAS scores than the control group (test group = 78.79%, test group = 69.70%; P < 0.05).

Two assembly plants were chosen with one receiving PMR therapy and the other Pamphlets. Intention-to-treat analysis was conducted to test the effectiveness of the relaxation therapy. Stress, Depression and Anxiety levels were measured using the shortened DASS-21 questionnaire. Data were analyzed using Chi-square, Independent sample t test and Repeated-measures analysis of variance to test the significance of the effects of intervention (time * group) for the measures of Stress, Depression and Anxiety. Significant favourable intervention effects on stress were found in the PMR group (Effect size=0.6) as compared to the Pamphlet group (Effect size=0.2). There was a significant group *time interaction effect (p<0.001) on Stress levels. Depression and Anxiety levels were minimal at baseline in both the groups with mild or no reduction in levels. The improvement in stress levels showed the potential of PMR therapy as a coping strategy at the workplace. Further research in this field is necessary to examine the beneficial effects of coping strategies in the workplace.",

We studied 30 adults with mild or moderate ID who were split at random into a relaxation group (RG, 15 subjects), who completed 10 sessions of relaxation therapy, and a control group (CG, 15 subjects), who were on a waiting list. The method used is the pretest and posttest. Variables were assessed by the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory form Y scale, the Rosenberg Self-Esteem scale, and the Emotion Regulation Questionnaire. We found that in the RG, relaxation significantly reduced state anxiety, t(14, 15) = 17.8***, d = -0.72, and improved self-esteem, t(14, 15) = -7.7***, d = 1.03, and cognitive reappraisal, t(14, 15) = -6.3***, d = 1.3, while the CG showed no change for these variables. We conclude that relaxation seems to be an interesting therapeutic option for reducing anxiety in people with ID in a supported employment setting.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: According to the World Health Organization (WHO) report released in 2000, about 121 million people worldwide suffer from depression. The major depressive disorder (MDD) among multiple sclerosis (MS) patients is one of the most common mood disorders experienced during life. MS patients who simultaneously suffer from depression have reported more severe symptoms of disease and slower adaptation to new conditions, which ultimately increase the cost of treatment. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to assess the effectiveness of progressive muscle relaxation therapy (PMRT) as an adjunctive therapy for reducing level of depression for MS patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This research had the randomized controlled trial design with pre and posttest. Thirty female patients based on criteria of MS and MDD disease, were selected from the MS Society of Shiraz, Iran. Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II) was administered at pre and posttest. The participants were randomly allocated to two groups (experimental and control). Twelve sessions of PMRT using Bernstein and Borkovec's method were held for the experimental group. Levin's test, covariance and ANOVA with repeated measures were used for data analysis. RESULTS: Experimental and control groups were compared before and after treatment. Analysis of covariance showed that seven levels of depression decreased in the experimental group and analysis of repeated measure showed that 49% of the changes were related to PMRT. CONCLUSION: According to the results, PMRT is effective in reducing depression. This therapy enables patients to reach relaxation quickly, and thus can cope with depression reactions effectively."

Attending to life quality of SCT recipients is now viewed as essential. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to identify the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of healing touch (HT) and relaxation therapy (RT) with patients undergoing SCT. METHODS: A randomized prospective design compared 13 SCT patients who received HT daily while hospitalized to 13 similar SCT patients who received daily RT. The clinical outcomes of the 2 groups were also compared with retrospective clinical data of 20 patients who received SCT during the same year. RESULTS: The mean age of participants was 57 years, with 54% receiving autologous and 46% receiving allogeneic transplants. All patients assigned to the HT group completed the protocol. Only 60% of the relaxation group completed the intervention. Both interventions produced improvement in psychosocial measures and a shorter hospital length of stay (LOS) than the historical group. Differential results for LOS were related to the type of transplant received. The LOS differences were not statistically significant but could be clinically significant. CONCLUSIONS: Healing touch was a better tolerated modality by this population. Future research is needed to validate the LOS advantage of the HT and RT interventions, explore the differences in effect found with different transplant types, and identify patients who can tolerate RT. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: The LOS reduction could result in decreased cost. Second, mood and function improvements support quality of life during SCT treatment.",

      "abstract": "AIMS: To conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the effectiveness of hypnosis/relaxation therapy compared to no/minimal treatment in patients with temporomandibular disorders (TMD). METHODS: Studies reviewed included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) where investigators randomized patients with TMD or an equivalent condition to an intervention arm receiving hypnosis, relaxation training, or hyporelaxation therapy, and a control group receiving no/minimal treatment. The systematic search was conducted without language restrictions, in Medline, EMBASE, CENTRAL, and PsycINFO, from inception to June 30, 2014. Studies were pooled using weighted mean differences and pooled risk ratios (RRs) for continuous outcomes and dichotomous outcomes, respectively, and their associated 95% confidence intervals (CI). RESULTS: Of 3,098 identified citations, 3 studies including 159 patients proved eligible, although none of these described their method of randomization. The results suggested limited or no benefit of hypnosis/relaxation therapy on pain (risk difference in important pain -0.06; 95% CI: -0.18 to 0.05; P = .28), or on pressure pain thresholds on the skin surface over the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) and masticatory muscles. Low-quality evidence suggested some benefit of hypnosis/relaxation therapy on maximal pain (mean difference on 100-mm scale = -28.33; 95% CI: -44.67 to -11.99; P =.007) and active maximal mouth opening (mean difference on 100-mm scale = -2.63 mm; 95% CI: -3.30 mm to -1.96 mm; P < .001) compared to no/minimal treatment. CONCLUSION: Three RCTs were eligible for the systematic review, but they were with high risk of bias and provided low-quality evidence, suggesting that hypnosis/relaxation therapy may have a beneficial effect on maximal pain and active maximal mouth opening but not on pain and pressure pain threshold. Larger RCTs with low risk of bias are required to confirm or refute these findings and to inform other important patient outcomes.",

      "abstract": "Night eating syndrome (NES) is a circadian rhythm disorder in which food intake is shifted toward the end of the day, interfering with sleep. According to the biobehavioral model of NES, the disorder is the result of a genetic predisposition that, coupled with stress, leads to enhanced reuptake of serotonin, thereby dysregulating circadian rhythms and decreasing satiety. Using the biobehavioral model as a guide, we developed a brief behavioral intervention using education, relaxation strategies, and exercise to address the core symptoms of NES. In this pilot randomized controlled clinical trial, 44 participants with NES were randomly assigned to an educational group (E; n = 14), E plus progressive muscle relaxation therapy (PMR; n = 15); or PMR plus exercise (PMR Plus, n = 15). Participants received a baseline intervention with 1- and 3-week follow-up sessions. Effectiveness analyses showed that participants in all three groups evidenced significant reductions on measures of NES symptoms (p < .001), depression (p < .05), anxiety (p < .01), and perceived stress (p < .05). However, the only significant between group change was for the percent of food eaten after the evening meal, with the PMR group showing the greatest reduction (-30.54%), followed by the PMR Plus group (-20.42%) and the E group (-9.5%); only the difference between the PMR and E groups was statistically significant (p = .012). Reductions in NES scores were significantly associated with reductions on measures of depression (r = .47; p < .01) and perceived stress (r = .37; p < .05), but not anxiety (r = .26, p = ns). Results support the role of education and relaxation in the behavioral treatment of NES.",

DESIGN: This randomized controlled trial with a pre-post test design was conducted on 86 hemodialysis patients randomly divided into an intervention (receiving Benson's relaxation technique) and a control group (usual care). SETTING: The setting of the study was two hemodialysis units affiliated to Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran. INTERVENTION: The patients listened to the audiotape of Benson's relaxation technique twice a day each time for 20min for 8 weeks. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Dietary and fluid adherence and some biomedical markers were measured in both the intervention and the control group at baseline and at the 8th week after the intervention. RESULTS: The results showed significant differences between the two groups regarding blood urea nitrogen and phosphate as dietary adherence and interdialytic weight gain as fluid adherence in the 8th week of the intervention (P<0.05). Also, a significant difference was found between the two groups concerning blood glucose level after the intervention (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: This study highlighted the importance of Benson's relaxation technique in improvement of adherence and some biomedical markers in hemodialysis patients. Thus, Benson's relaxation therapy could be used as a part of the nursing care practice for hemodialysis patients and those suffering from chronic diseases.",

METHOD: A systematic literature study was performed. Using specific keywords related to fibromyalgia or chronic fatigue syndrome and relaxation therapy, the electronic databases PubMed and Web of Science were searched. Included articles were assessed for their risk of bias and relevant information regarding relaxation was extracted. The review was conducted and reported according to the PRISMA-statement. RESULTS: Thirteen randomized clinical trials of sufficient quality were included, resulting in a total of 650 fibromyalgia patients (11 studies) and 88 chronic fatigue syndrome patients (3 studies). None of the studies reported effects on autonomic function. Six studies reported the effect of guided imagery on pain and daily functioning in fibromyalgia. The acute effect of a single session of guided imagery was studied in two studies and seems beneficial for pain relief. For other relaxation techniques (eg. muscle relaxation, autogenic training) no conclusive evidence was found for the effect on pain and functioning in fibromyalgia patients comparison to multimodal treatment programs. For fatigue a multimodal approach seemed better than relaxation, as shown in the sole three studies on chronic fatigue syndrome patients. CONCLUSION: There is moderate evidence for the acute effect of guided imagery on pain, although the content of the visualization is a matter of debate. Other relaxation formats and the effects on functionality and autonomic function require further study.",

AIM: This study aimed to compare the effects of cold therapy and relaxation on pain of CTR among the patients undergoes coronary artery bypass graft surgery. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This single-blinded clinical trial was done on 80 post-cardiac surgery patients in the heart hospital of Sari-Iran. The patients were assigned to three randomized groups that included cold therapy, relaxation, and control groups. Data analysis was done by T-test, Chi-square, generalized estimating equations and repeated measures analysis variance tests. RESULTS: The groups had no significant differences in pain intensity before CTR (P = 0.84), but immediately after CTR there was a significant difference between the treatment (cold application and relaxation groups) and control groups (P = 0.001). There was no significant difference between relaxation and cold therapy groups. CONCLUSION: Regarding the relaxation and cold application methods showed relatively equal effects on reducing the pain owing to CTR. Thus, the use of relaxation because of economics, without side effects, easy to use and effective is recommended by the authors to the practitioners."

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: Assessment of short-term practice of relaxation therapy on autonomic and cardiovascular functions in first-year medical students. DESIGN: Case-control, interventional study. SETTING: Medical college laboratory. SUBJECTS: Sixty-seven medical students, divided into two groups: study group (n = 35) and control group (n = 32). INTERVENTION: Study group subjects practiced relaxation therapy (shavasana with a soothing background music) daily 1 hour for 6 weeks. Control group did not practice relaxation techniques. MEASURES: Cardiovascular parameters and spectral indices of heart rate variability (HRV) were recorded before and after the 6-week practice of relaxation therapy. ANALYSIS: The data between the groups and the data before and after practice of relaxation techniques were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance and Student t-test. In the study group, prediction of low-frequency to high-frequency ratio (LF-HF) of HRV, the marker of sympathovagal balance, to blood pressure (BP) status was assessed by logistic regression. RESULTS: In the study group, there was significant reduction in heart rate (p = .0001), systolic (p = .0010) and diastolic (p = .0021) pressure, and rate pressure product (p < .0001), and improvement in HRV indices, following 6 weeks of relaxation therapy. As determined by regression model, prediction of LF-HF to BP status was more significant (odds ratio, 2.7; p = .009) after practice of relaxation therapy. There was no significant alteration in these parameters in control subjects. CONCLUSION: Short-term practice of relaxation therapy can improve autonomic balance and promote cardiovascular health of medical students. Sympathovagal balance is directly linked to BP status in these individuals.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To observe the clinical efficacy on superior cluneal nerve entrapment syndrome treated by relaxation therapy of in-row multi-needling technique. METHODS: One hundred and twenty cases were randomized into a multi-needling group, an acupotomy group and a conventional acupuncture group, 40 cases in each one. In the multi-needling group, the perpendicular or oblique puncture was applied to the affected area of the lumbar and gluteal region. The chief needling sites were determined in terms of the strong response of acupuncture to be the chief points. The in-row multi-needling technique was applied around the chief needling sites, with lifting, thrusting penetrating method to different directions. Two chief points were connected with the G6805 low frequency pulse therapeutic apparatus. In the acupotomy group, the acupotomy was applied to 3 to 4 affected sites in each treatment. In the conventional acupuncture group, Shenshu (BL 23), Dachangshu (BL 25), Jiaji (EX-B 2) in the lumbar region, Zhibian (BL 54) and the others were selected and connected with the G6805 low frequency pulse therapeutic apparatus. The cases in each group were treated for 4 weeks. The improvements of pain score, therapeutic efficacy and comprehensive satisfaction assessment were compared among 3 groups in 2 and 4 weeks of treatment separately. RESULTS: The pain scores in each group were reduced apparently in 2 and 4 weeks of treatment separately (all P<0.05), and the pain score in the acupotomy group was lower than that in the conventional acupuncture group in 2 weeks of treatment. In 4 weeks of treatment, the pain scores in the multi-needling group and the acupotomy group were lower than that in the conventional acupuncture group (both P<0.05) and the pain score in the multi-needling group was lower than that in the acupotomy group (P<0.05). In 2 weeks of treatment, the remarkable effective rate in the acupotomy group was 62.5% (25/40), which was superior significantly to 25.0% (10/40) in the conventional acupuncture group (P<0.05). The other differences among the groups were not significant statistically in comparison. In 4 weeks of treatment, the remarkable effective rate was 90. 0% (36/40) in the multi-needling group and was 67.5% (27/40) in the acupotomy group, which were superior to 35.0% (14/40) in the conventional acupuncture group (both P<0.05). The remarkably effective rate in the multi-needling group was better than that in the acupotomy group (P<0.05). The satisfaction for the patients in the multi-needling group was higher obviously than that in any of the other two groups (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: The relaxation therapy of in-row multi-needling technique achieves the definite therapeutic effect on superior cluneal nerve entrapment syndrome. The efficacy is superior to acupotomy and the conventional acupuncture. The therapeutic effect is better for the cases of the extensive affected scope, unclear location and large distribution in patches caused by the adhesion of muscles and fascia especially.",

The objective of this study was to demonstrate whether relaxation therapy can improve their satisfaction with sleep. BACKGROUND: Few studies have investigated the effectiveness of relaxation in patients hospitalized with an advanced chronic disease. DESIGN: Prospective randomized study with an immediate intervention group (IIG; relaxation days 3-6) and a delayed intervention group (DIG; relaxation days 6-9). METHODS: The main measure was the overall satisfaction of sleep measured on a Numerical Rating Scale of Satisfaction of Sleep (NRSSS) between 0 and 10. RESULTS: Totally 18 (IIG: 9; DIG: 9) patients were included in this study (mean age 66 ± 10.7). The NRSSS improved in both the groups (almost statistically significant) between the day of inclusion and day 2. Because of the dropout of the patients during the last days of the study, we analyzed the improvement in sleep satisfaction only between day 2 and 5. The NRSSS D5 for the immediate and delayed groups were 4.0 ± 23 and 3.8 ± 2.3, respectively. There was no significant improvement in both the groups. CONCLUSION: The results demonstrated the difficulty to include patients with advanced cancer in a randomized study with a DIG. We were not able to demonstrate the effectiveness of relaxation therapy on sleep satisfaction. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Techniques that can be easily used to improve sleep in patients with an advanced cancer should be developed and used already early in the disease.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Preterm birth (PTB) is a leading cause of perinatal mortality and morbidity. Although the pathogenesis of preterm labour (PTL) is not well understood, there is evidence about the relationship between maternal psychological stress and adverse pregnancy outcomes. Relaxation or mind-body therapies cover a broad range of techniques, e.g. meditation, massage, etc. There is no systematic review investigating the effect of relaxation techniques on preventing PTL and PTB. This review does not cover hypnosis as this is the subject of a separate Cochrane review. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness of relaxation therapies for preventing or treating PTL and preventing PTB. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (14 December 2011), CENTRAL (2011, Issue 4 of 4), CINAHL (1982 to 14 December 2011) and contacted study authors for additional information. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomized controlled trials, cluster- and quasi-randomized trials comparing relaxation techniques with usual care, no treatment or sham interventions to prevent or treat PTL. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors (B Khianman (BK) and P Pattanittum (PP)) independently assessed all search results for potential inclusion studies. Disagreements were resolved by discussion with a third review author (J Thinkhamrop (JT)). Data were independently extracted onto the standardized data collection form by BK and PP and checked for accuracy. Two review authors independently assessed the risk of bias of all included studies. All differences were resolved by discussion with JT. Mean difference (MD) and its 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated for continuous outcomes and risk ratio (RR) and 95% CI for dichotomous data. MAIN RESULTS: Eleven randomized controlled trials with a total of 833 women were included in this review. However, the results of this review are based on single studies with small numbers of participants.The majority of included studies reported insufficient information on sequence generation, allocation concealment as well as blinding. There were no included studies that assessed PTL or PTB as the primary outcome. The included studies were different in terms of intervention, practice, and time, and there were no clear coherent hypotheses.For women not in PTL, the benefits of relaxation was found in one study for maternal stress (Anxiety Stress Scale) at 26 to 29 weeks gestational age (mean difference (MD) -7.04; 95% confidence interval (CI) -13.91 to -0.17). In addition, there were some beneficial effects of relaxation including baby birthweight (MD 285.00 g; 95% CI 76.94 to 493.06); type of delivery; (vaginal delivery; risk ratio (RR) 1.52; 95% CI 1.13 to 2.04), (cesarean section; RR 0.38; 95% CI 0.19 to 0.78); maternal anxiety (MD -15.79; 95% CI -18.33 to -13.25); and stress (MD -13.08; 95% CI -15.29 to -10.87) when applying relaxation therapy together with standard treatment. For women in PTL, the results for the main outcome of PTB in the intervention and control groups from a single study were not different (RR 0.95; 95% CI 0.57 to 1.59). The MD of birthweight in grams from the fixed-effect model from two included studies was MD -5.68; (95% CI -174.09 to 162.74). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: According to the results of this review, there is some evidence that relaxation during pregnancy reduces stress and anxiety. However, there was no effect on PTL/PTB. These results should be interpreted with caution as they were drawn from included studies with limited quality.",

The therapy consisted of an uncontrolled nine-session course in modified progressive relaxation therapy assisted by computer animated surface EMG provided from the trapezius muscles and with the physiotherapist as a participant observer. Outcome measures were (a) headache frequency and intensity, (b) pericranial tenderness, (c) tension patterns, and (d) evaluations assessed at baseline and at 3 months follow up. Nine children, mean age 10.9 (SD 1.7) years, diagnosed with frequent episodic or chronic tension-type headache completed the course. The results showed a mean improvement of 45% for headache frequency at 3 months follow up versus baseline and a significant reduction in headache frequency for all participants and in Total Tenderness Score for children with frequent episodic tension-type headache. The children expressed a growing understanding of body reactions and an acquired ability to deactivate and regulate these reactions. Computer animated SEMG seems an applicable learning strategy for young headache sufferers. This study suggests that children below the age of 13 need both the dialog and guidance from a participant observer in order to achieve body awareness.",

A total of 25 patients with atopic dermatitis were randomly assigned to either a PMR group (n = 15) or a control group (n = 10). Serum levels of nerve growth, neuropeptide Y, and Th2 cytokines (IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13) were measured at baseline and after one month. At baseline, only anxiety was positively correlated with pruritus score (state anxiety: R = 0.496, p = 0.014; trait anxiety: R = 0.423, p = 0.04). Serum levels of neuropeptide Y were inversely related to the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) (state anxiety: R = -0.475, p = 0.019; trait anxiety: R = -0.418, p = 0.042) and pruritus scores (R = -0.451, p = 0.035). After one month of PMR therapy, the degree of pruritus and loss of sleep was significantly decreased in the PMR group (p < 0.001), but not among controls. State anxiety scores showed significant improvement after treatment only in the PMR group (p = 0.005). There were no significant changes in the serological parameters in either group. Reductions in Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) scores were significant, but similar, in both groups. PMR may be a useful adjunctive modality for the management of atopic dermatitis through the reduction of anxiety. No change was found in biological parameters, but it was observed that neuropeptide Y may be related to high levels of anxiety in atopic dermatitis at baseline.",

BACKGROUND: Despite the use of analgesics, patients may feel anxiety and pain before and after surgery, delaying their recovery. DESIGN: An experimental control group pretest-post-test quasi-experimental design was employed. METHOD: Subjects (n = 93) recruited from a medical centre in Taipei, Taiwan, from November 2006-March 2007 were randomly assigned to experimental (n = 45) and control (n = 48) groups. Subjects in the experimental group received relaxation therapy from the day before surgery to the third postoperative day. Researchers helped participants listen to a breath relaxation and guided imagery tape for 20 minutes daily. A pain and anxiety scale questionnaire, the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory questionnaire, blood pressure and heart rate were monitored before and after intervention. RESULTS: The average age of the 93 patients was 71·0 (SD 11·1) years. The least pain severity scores in the experimental were lower than those in the control group (p < 0·05) but both experienced the same level of worst or average pain (p > 0·05). The mean difference in the pain score before and after intervention in the experimental group on the pre-op day (t = 2·675, p = 0·009) and post-op day one (t = 3·059, p = 0·003) was greater than that in the control group (0·48 SD 0·94 vs. 0·10 SD 0·30 and 0·93 SD 1·46 vs. 0·20 SD 0·71, respectively). The two groups differed significantly in systolic blood pressure (F = 6·750, p < 0·05) but not in mean blood pressure, heart rate, or State-Trait Anxiety Inventory scores (p > 0·05). Patients reported that relaxation therapy helped them relax and promoted sleep. CONCLUSION: Relaxation therapy could complement analgesics to help postoperative patients better manage pain and anxiety. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Clinical practice should include complementary relaxation therapy to alleviate pain and anxiety in patients with joint replacement.",

RESULTS: The state anxiety score and the preterm labor stress score of experimental group were statistically significant lower than those of control group. In addition, the systolic and diastolic blood pressure, pulse rate of experimental group were statistically lower than those of control group. The skin temperature of experimental group was higher than that of control group. However, the fetal heart rate of experimental group was not statistically significant lower than fetal heart rate of control group. CONCLUSION: From these findings, it is concluded that relaxation therapy may be an effective nursing intervention for pregnant women with preterm labor."

      "abstract": "Globus sensation is a bothersome and difficult symptom to treat. The aims of this study were to evaluate the acceptability and utility of hypnotically-assisted relaxation (HAR) in decreasing the perception of globus sensation and the effect of HAR on interdeglutitive upper esophageal sphincter (UES) pressure. Sixteen subjects with persistent globus sensation unresponsive to therapy for reflux disease and with normal esophageal/laryngeal imaging studies were invited to participate in a 7-session clinical protocol. Before and after HAR, subjects completed standard questionnaires including the esophageal symptoms questionnaire. High-resolution manometric assessment of respiratory augmentation and average resting UES pressure were assessed before and after HAR. Ten of the 16 subjects agreed to participate in the protocol. All participants were women with median age 51.5 (range 30-72 years). The participants found HAR acceptable and completed the entire 7-session trial. Globus symptom severity varied widely pre-treatment (median=52.5, range 16-72), and 9 of 10 subjects reported a reduction in globus symptomatology following treatment (median=14.0, range 3-19; P=.007). Only 1 subject exhibited abnormal respiratory augmentation of UES pressure (>27 mm Hg) prior to treatment and was normal following treatment (9.9 mm Hg). Resting UES pressure was normal in all subjects (<118 mm Hg). Group respiratory augmentation and average resting UES pressure were unaffected by HAR (P=.48, .89). This case series suggests that HAR can provide a substantial improvement in globus sensation irrespective of cause. UES function was unaffected. We suggest that HAR therapy is an acceptable and useful intervention for patients with globus sensation.",

BACKGROUND: Despite the substantial evidence indicating the beneficial effects of relaxation therapy on the health-related quality of life of various cardiac populations, the value of this intervention in patients with chronic heart failure remains uncertain. Even less is known about its therapeutic effects in Chinese culture. METHOD: A total of 121 Chinese patients with chronic heart failure and over 60 years of age were recruited in 2002-2003 and randomly allocated to a relaxation training programme (n = 59) or an attention-control intervention (n = 62). The training included two relaxation training sessions, one skill revision workshop, twice daily relaxation self-practice and biweekly telephone follow-up. The World Health Organization Quality of Life questionnaire was completed at hospital discharge and at the 8th and 14th weeks after discharge. RESULTS: Repeated measures analysis of covariance indicated that those who attended the relaxation training programme reported statistically significantly greater improvement in psychological (P = 0.007, eta(2) = 0.043) and social (P = 0.016, eta(2) = 0.035) health-related quality of life than those who received the attention-control intervention over the evaluative period. Comparing outcomes at timepoints showed that the statistically significant group differences in the improvement of psychological and social health-related quality of life occurred mainly during the first evaluative endpoints. CONCLUSION: Relaxation techniques are beneficial to the emotional and social health-related quality of life of Chinese patients with chronic heart failure. Combining this intervention with other treatment modalities may produce a more substantial improvement in their health-related quality of life.",

METHODS: Patients (N = 81) were randomly assigned to either a 12-week cardiac rehabilitation program alone (CPA) or a CPRT. Perceived stress, blood pressure, heart rate, rate-pressure product value, total cholesterol level, body mass index, smoking status, and physical activity were recorded at baseline and following the 12-week intervention. Cardiac-related hospital admissions were analyzed in a 2-year follow-up. RESULTS: Perceived stress declined in both groups, although this improvement was significantly superior in the CPRT (31.5 +/- 4.9 vs 23.4 +/- 4.1; P <or= .0001). CPRT, but not CPA, had significantly lower heart rate, blood pressure, and rate-pressure product values after the program (P <or= .0001). Both groups improved smoking status, physical activity, body mass index, and total cholesterol level. During follow-up, the odds of being admitted to the hospital with cardiac-related problems, after adjusting for heart rate, blood pressure, smoking status, physical activity status, and total cholesterol (OR, 0.37; 95% CI, 0.045-2.98), was not significantly different between groups. CONCLUSIONS: Relaxation therapy was associated with a positive effect on psychological stress and hemodynamic variables beyond that promoted by cardiac rehabilitation alone.",

METHODS: From April 2004 to January 2005, with a single blinded randomized controlled design, 220 patients with newly diagnosed essential moderate to severe hypertension who needed drug therapy were included in the study. The study took place in the Hypertension Clinic, Sina Hospital, Tabriz, Iran. Patients were systematically randomized to receive standard plus relaxation therapy, 2 times per week, for 8 weeks, or standard therapy alone. We collected the demographic data, blood pressure measurements, and the data on prescribed drugs. RESULTS: The mean age of patients was 54 in the case group and 56 years in the control group. The mean blood pressure level (systolic and diastolic) was 192.86/105.16 and 192.09/102.25 mm Hg on admission in the case and the control groups, which decreased to 133.46/81.48 and 146.21/83.57 mm Hg, at the end of study. The difference of blood pressure on admission was not statistically significant, but became significant at the end of the study. Fifty-nine percent in the case group and 36% in the control group had good control of blood pressure. CONCLUSION: Relaxation therapy on the background of standard antihypertensive drug treatment results in better control of blood pressure.",

This study examined the effects of PMRT on the psychologic status and symptoms of older Chinese patients with heart failure. METHODS: In a longitudinal, randomized, and controlled study, 59 patients were allocated to receive a PMRT program and 62 were provided with the attention placebo. The PMRT program included two PMRT sessions, one revision workshop, twice-daily PMRT home practices, and a biweekly telephone follow-up call. The attention placebo included a regular telephone call at a schedule similar to that made by the interventionist of the PMRT program with the intervention group. Main outcome measures, including psychologic distress, dyspnea, and fatigue, were taken at baseline, the 8th week, and the 14th week. RESULTS: A medium effect on psychologic distress in favor of the PMRT program was detected. Patients practicing PMRT however only demonstrated a nonsignificant trend of greater improvement in symptom status. CONCLUSION: Progressive muscle relaxation training seems to be useful as an adjunctive nonpharmacologic treatment modality in the management of heart failure.",

Yet, there is an inadequate use of non-pharmacological therapy in caring for older people with heart failure. OBJECTIVE: To examine the effects of relaxation therapy and exercise training on psychological outcomes and disease-specific quality of life of older heart failure patients. METHODS: Subjects undertook relaxation (n = 59), exercise training (n = 32) or received attention placebo (n = 62) for 12 weeks. The relaxation group attended two training sessions, one revision workshop, and continued with twice-daily taped-directed home relaxation practice, with support from the intervener through bi-weekly telephone contact, for 12 weeks. The exercise group undertook 12 weekly sessions of resistance training and aerobic exercise and thrice weekly home exercise. The control group received regular telephone calls for general 'greetings'. RESULTS: The relaxation and exercise groups reported a significantly greater improvement in psychological [F(2, 149) = 6.69, p = 0.002] and various disease-specific quality of life outcomes [dyspnea: F(2, 149) = 5.72, p = 0.004; fatigue: F(2, 149) = 3.78, p = 0.25; emotion: F(2, 149) = 6.68, p = 0.001], compared with those who received the attention placebo. While relaxation therapy was more effective to reduce psychological distress, with depression in particular (p < 0.001), exercise therapy worked better to control fatigue symptoms (p = 0.03). CONCLUSION: Relaxation therapy and exercise training are effective to improve the psychological and physical health of older heart failure patients. They should be used as an individual treatment modality, or as care components of a disease management program.",

This review describes the most common MRT techniques, summarizes recent evidence of their effectiveness in treating anxiety, and explains their rationale and physiological basis. We conclude that although GAD and PD patients may exhibit elevated muscle tension and abnormal autonomic and respiratory measures during laboratory baseline assessments, the available evidence does not allow us to conclude that physiological activation decreases over the course of MRT in GAD and PD patients, even when patients report becoming less anxious. Better-designed studies will be required to identify the mechanisms of MRT and to advance clinical practice.",

METHODS AND RESULTS: A search was conducted for controlled trials in which patients with myocardial ischaemia were taught relaxation therapy, and outcomes were measured with respect to physiological, psychological, cardiac effects, return to work and cardiac events. A total of 27 studies were located. Six studies used abbreviated relaxation therapy (3 h or less of instruction), 13 studies used full relaxation therapy (9 h of supervised instruction and discussion), and in eight studies full relaxation therapy was expanded with cognitive therapy (11 h on average). Physiological outcomes: reduction in resting heart rate, increased heart rate variability, improved exercise tolerance and increased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol were found. No effect was found on blood pressure or cholesterol. Psychological outcome: state anxiety was reduced, trait anxiety was not, depression was reduced. Cardiac effects: the frequency of occurrence of angina pectoris was reduced, the occurrence of arrhythmia and exercise induced ischaemia were reduced. Return to work was improved. Cardiac events occurred less frequently, as well as cardiac deaths. With the exception of resting heart rate, the effects were small, absent or not measured in studies in which abbreviated relaxation therapy was given. No difference was found between the effects of full or expanded relaxation therapy. CONCLUSION: Intensive supervised relaxation practice enhances recovery from an ischaemic cardiac event and contributes to secondary prevention. It is an important ingredient of cardiac rehabilitation, in addition to exercise and psycho-education.",

Treatment comprised electromyograph and thermal biofeedback, autogenic and progressive relaxation, and symptom-specific recommendations. Significant differences (p < .05) between groups were observed in the headache index and loss of consciousness, favoring the BFRT group. Both groups decreased state anxiety and depression. The Millon Behavioral Health Inventory was used to assess patients' coping style and adjustment to illness. The majority of the adult participants evidenced illness overreaction, preoccupation with illness, depressive feelings, and tendencies to nonadherence to therapy. BFRT is of potential benefit to patients with neurocardiogenic syncope, but further study is necessary to define the influence of coping style on outcome.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: New types of illness are being identified continuously. Owing to the demands for evidence-based practice, physiotherapeutic interventions need to be investigated scientifically prior to application in a new patient population. Coronary syndrome X (syndrome X) is a chronic pain disorder with exercise-induced chest pain despite angiographically normal coronary arteries. Patients with syndrome X constitute a therapeutic problem with considerable residual morbidity associated with functional limitation and reduced quality of life. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of physical training and relaxation therapy on exercise capacity and quality of life in patients with syndrome X. METHOD: A single-blind, randomized controlled trial design was used. Twenty-four female patients aged 41-65 years were randomly assigned to three groups: A, B and C. All groups were similar at baseline for physical fitness level. Group A performed physical training for eight weeks at 50% of baseline VO2max and group B participated in relaxation therapy for eight weeks. Group C acted as control subjects without any intervention. Before and after the eight-week periods, subjects were assessed by means of several measures of exercise capacity and quality of life. RESULTS: The measured variables did not change in the control group during the eight weeks. VO2max (< 0.02), work rate (< 0.002) and distance walked during six minutes (< 0.003) increased only after physical training. The tolerated exertion during six minutes of walking (< 0.05) and the health-related quality of life, measured both by the Stress and Crisis Inventory (SCI) and the Sickness Impact Profile (SIP) (< 0.04), improved after both physical training and relaxation therapy. The general coping capacity, measured by the Sense of Coherence (SOC) questionnaire, remained unchanged in all the groups. CONCLUSIONS: Female patients with syndrome X benefit from physical training in terms of exercise capacity and quality of life and from relaxation therapy in terms of quality of life.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: This study evaluated the long-term outcome of cognitive behavior therapy versus relaxation therapy for patients with chronic fatigue syndrome. METHOD: Sixty patients who participated in a randomized controlled trial of cognitive behavior therapy versus relaxation therapy for chronic fatigue syndrome were invited to complete self-rated measures and participate in a 5-year follow-up interview with an assessor who was blind to treatment type. RESULTS: Fifty-three patients (88%) participated in the follow-up study: 25 received cognitive behavior therapy and 28 received relaxation therapy. A total of 68% of the patients who received cognitive behavior therapy and 36% who received relaxation therapy rated themselves as \"much improved\" or \"very much improved\" at the 5-year follow-up. Significantly more patients receiving cognitive behavior therapy, in relation to those in relaxation therapy, met criteria for complete recovery, were free of relapse, and experienced symptoms that had steadily improved or were consistently mild or absent since treatment ended. Similar proportions were employed, but patients in the cognitive behavior therapy group worked significantly more mean hours per week. Few patients crossed the threshold for \"normal\" fatigue, despite achieving a good outcome on other measures. Cognitive behavior therapy was positively evaluated and was still used by over 80% of the patients. CONCLUSIONS: Cognitive behavior therapy for chronic fatigue syndrome can produce some lasting benefits but is not a cure. Once therapy ends, some patients have difficulty making further improvements. In the future, attention should be directed toward ensuring that gains are maintained and extended after regular treatment ends.",

Six controlled and three uncontrolled studies were identified, employing a variety of methods, such as progressive relaxation, functional relaxation, autogenic training, or yoga. Most studies had low sample sizes and suffered from one or more methodological deficiencies, such as suboptimal data analysis, high dropout rates, problematic measurement procedures, or insufficient descriptions of methodology and results. Overall effects on parameters of lung function, symptoms, medication consumption, and health care use were generally negligible. Problems with the underlying rationale of relaxation therapy in asthma are discussed from a psychophysiological viewpoint. Examples are given of potential beneficial and detrimental effects of these techniques on lung function with respect to emotional processes, the musculoskeletal system, and ventilation as targets of a relaxation intervention. It remains to be demonstrated that relaxation training can significantly contribute to the standard treatment of asthma in adult patients.",

      "abstract": "Focussing on processes of body perception is a major pathway of relaxation therapies (progressive relaxation, autogenic training, guided imagery, hypnotherapy, biofeedback). Traditionally its application has been related to psychosomatic and psychotherapeutic indications. Beyond this classical approach, recent behavioral medicine has emphasized the relevance of interoception processes and adequate attribution patterns concerning bodily sensations as a major source of adequate coping and self-management with somatic illness. Clinical application may refer to an improved cognitive-behavioral pain management in disease and treatment related conditions. Especially children and adolescents suffering from chronic conditions that may exacerbate rapidly may benefit from an education approach that teaches them to perceive their disease-related complaints and symptoms accurately and to attribute them correctly. A precise, panic-free and immediate symptom recognition of sudden airway obstruction is an important precondition of adequate coping with acute asthma crisis and starting risk orientated antiasthmatic treatment. In a similar way, the child with diabetes mellitus may identify early signs of hypoglycemia by self-observation, recognition and discrimination of physical, vegetative and psychological indicators of blood glucose decline that enable the child to take appropriate countermeasures. Other childhood disorders that offer chances for symptomatic self-monitoring and self-control comprise atopic dermatitis or epileptic seizures. Training young patients in precise symptom recognition may not only empower them in handling acute crisis but also strengthen global development of autonomy, control beliefs, self-responsibility and self-esteem.",

Students with insomnia (SWI; n = 57) were compared to a control group of students not complaining of insomnia (SNI; n = 61) on self-reported sleep variables and five questionnaires: Insomnia Impact Scale (IIS), Dysfunctional Beliefs and Attitudes About Sleep Scale (DBAS), Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS), and Penn State Worry Questionnaire (PSWQ). SWI demonstrated significant impairment on all day time functioning and sleep measures compared to SNI. To investigate treatment effects on day time functioning, 28 SWI were randomly assigned to PR. Treated SWI were compared to untreated SWI and SNI at posttreatment. Treated participants improved sleep in comparison to untreated SWI, but failed to show significant improvements in day time functioning. Insomnia treatments focused on improving sleep may not improve day time functioning, or day time gains may emerge more slowly than sleep gains. This study documents the wide range of day time functioning complaints in young adults with insomnia and suggests that the goal of insomnia treatment should be to not only improve sleep but also to improve the subjective experience of day time functioning.",

The purpose of this controlled study was to determine the effect of mood state, specifically depression, anxiety, and daily hassles on the outcome of biofeedback assisted relaxation in insulin dependent diabetes mellitus. Eighteen subjects completed the study, nine in biofeedback assisted relaxation and nine in the control group. There were no significant group differences in blood glucose between those receiving biofeedback assisted relaxation and the subjects continuing usual care. Five of the nine experimental subjects and one of the nine control subjects were identified as succeeders according to an arbitrary criterion. Treatment failures were more depressed, more anxious, and took longer to complete the protocol than succeeders. Statistically significant correlations were found between high scores on inventories measuring depression, anxiety, and hassles intensity and higher blood glucose levels and smaller changes in blood glucose as a result of treatment. It is suggested that mood has an important impact on the response to biofeedback assisted relaxation. Further research is necessary to determine whether assessment of anxiety and depression followed by appropriate treatment where necessary should precede biofeedback assisted relaxation in insulin dependent diabetes.",

PROBANDS: 28 patients with chronic cancer pain in a stable phase of the disease. INTERVENTION: 14-day training of a relaxation therapy designed for improving the falling asleep, including a 30-minute lullaby-like, rhythmically dominated music with gradually decreasing tempi. No training in the control group. OUTCOME MEASURES: Continuous registration of heart rate and comparison with musical beat on day 1 and 15. Analysis of the degree of synchronisation, i.e. the coordination of systole and musical central time point (1st beat of the 6/8 time alla breve). Recording of the time of falling asleep and registration of the patient's subjective evaluation of the relaxation therapy and the pain intensity using verbal rating scales. Documentation of the use of analgetics. RESULTS: Under the relaxation therapy trained patients showed an increasing synchronisation and coordination of heart rate and musical beat. At a musical tempo between 48 and 42 beats per min a very stable 2 : 3 synchronisation occurred. Trained patients who reported the best relaxing and analgetic effects showed the highest degree of synchronisation. Relaxation therapy led to an improvement of falling asleep and to a decrease in consumption of analgetics. CONCLUSIONS: Lullaby-like music within a special range of tempi can induce a trainable synchronisation of heart rate, functionally associated with the formation and intensity of a relaxation reaction. Further investigations are promising, however, substantial improvements in the measurement and documentation methods are needed.",

DESIGN: Quasi-experimental, with women who experienced preterm labor randomly assigned to a control or experimental group. The experimental group was to do a daily relaxation exercise. A third group was added to the study: women who were originally assigned to the relaxation group but were unable to adhere to the daily practice. Final data were analyzed for three groups: control (n = 40), experimental (n = 44), and nonadherent (n = 23) participants. SETTING: Women were referred to the study from physician offices and a hospital-based obstetric triage clinic in the Northwest. PARTICIPANTS: Total sample was comprised of 107 women with singleton gestations, documented contractions with cervical change, and intact membranes. INTERVENTIONS: The experimental group was instructed in a progressive relaxation exercise. The participants were given tapes of the exercise and instructed to do it daily. OUTCOME MEASURES: Study outcomes included gestational age at birth, rate of pregnancy prolongation, and birth weight. RESULTS: The outcome variables were analyzed using analysis of covariance, with the preterm labor risk score entered as a covariate to compensate statistically for group differences. A positive response to the relaxation intervention was found: The experimental group had significantly longer gestations and larger newborns when compared to the control and nonadherent groups. CONCLUSIONS: Relaxation therapy made a difference in preterm labor outcome. Women who practiced relaxation had larger newborns, longer gestations, and higher rates of pregnancy prolongation. Given the low cost of the intervention, it should be offered to all women at risk for preterm labor.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Evidence suggests that breathing and relaxation therapy may influence cardiac events in persons after acute myocardial infarction (MI). The authors studied the effects of breathing and relaxation therapy on rates of cardiac events and cost effectiveness in past MI patients. METHODS: Patients (n = 156) were chosen randomly to receive either exercise training plus relaxation therapy (relaxation group; n = 76) or exercise training only (control group; n = 80). The occurrence of major cardiac events and cardiac rehospitalizations in the two treatment groups was compared. RESULTS: At 5-year follow-up, 12 cardiac deaths had occurred, 5 in the relaxation group and 7 in the control group, reinfarction occurred in 10 and 12 patients, and cardiac surgery was performed in 2 and 11, respectively. In total, 15 (20%) and 26 (33%) patients, respectively, experienced at least one cardiac event (odds ratio [OR] for the relaxation group: 0.55, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.29-1.05; adjusted for risk factors OR 0.52, 95% CI 0.28-0.99). Regarding all cardiac rehospitalizations, in the relaxation group, 30 patients (39%) had experienced 52 cardiac events, for which the patients were hospitalized for a total of 476 days. In the control group, 38 patients (48%) had experienced 78 cardiac events (OR 0.72; 95% CI 0.38-1.36), comprising 719 days of hospitalization. The total number of hospitalizations was reduced by 31% as a result of relaxation instruction. CONCLUSIONS: In the long-term, the disease course after myocardial infarction is influenced favorably by giving relaxation therapy in addition to cardiac rehabilitation. The extra costs of the therapy are compensated by a decrease in hospitalization for cardiac problems.",
