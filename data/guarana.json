      "abstract": "Liver damage caused by high doses of paracetamol is a global public health concern. Consequently, therapeutic strategies are being explored to prevent this damage. The bioactive compounds present in fruits have shown promise in protecting against disorders associated with paracetamol-induced liver damage. This study assessed the preventive effects of guarana powder on redox status in a rat model of acute hepatotoxicity induced by a toxic dose of paracetamol. Male Wistar rats were divided into four groups: control (C), guarana (G), paracetamol (P), and guarana + paracetamol (GP). Animals in groups G and GP received 300 mg/kg guarana powder daily for seven days. Hepatotoxicity was induced in the P and GP groups by a single dose of 3 g/kg paracetamol on the last day. Paracetamol effectively induced liver damage and oxidative stress in group P animals. Preventive treatment with guarana significantly mitigated this damage and prevented the serum elevation of ALT, AST, and ALP by 44 %, 29 %, and 24 %, respectively. It also prevented a 133 % increase in the necrotic liver area in GP animals compared to the P. Guarana treatment, which prevented reductions in glutathione levels, modulated antioxidant enzyme (SOD and CAT) expression and activity, and protein carbonylation, while enhancing the total antioxidant capacity. Our results suggest that preventive treatment with guarana can attenuate oxidative damage, modulate antioxidant defense gene expression, and protect against paracetamol-induced hepatotoxicity in rats, highlighting guarana powder as a potential therapeutic agent to prevent liver damage induced by high doses of paracetamol."

      "abstract": "Growing interest in plant-based materials for stabilizing food emulsions is driven by the clean-label trend. Conjugating plant proteins with phenolic compounds from plant extracts enhances their techno-functionality and allows their use as stabilizers of emulsion-based systems. This study aimed to (i) combine heat treatment (HT) and conjugation with guarana extract (GE) to improve the emulsifying ability of pea protein isolate (PPI); (ii) encapsulate vitamin D3 (VD) in PPI/GE-stabilized emulsions; (iii) evaluate the potential of these formulations in improving VD retention during storage and in vitro bioaccessibility. The particles showed a size distribution ranging from 0.5 to 10 µm, depending on the processing sequence. Furthermore, HT on PPI dispersions followed by conjugation with GE led to microgels that stabilized emulsions during 30 days of storage at 25 °C. Also, the conjugates significantly improved VD retention, ranging from 74 to 100 %, after 30 days of storage at 25 °C, even in the presence of UV light. VD-loaded emulsions produced by PPI-GE conjugates showed higher bioaccessibility values (>65 %) compared to emulsions produced by PPI alone (∼58 %) and VD-incorporated sunflower oil (37 %). Given the above, the technological modification of PPI through conjugation with GE phenolic compounds and HT efficiently produced O/W emulsions loaded with VD, improving its bioaccessibility and tailoring a system with potential application in plant-based beverage and dessert formulations.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Cancer-related fatigue is a pervasive symptom, affecting up to 90% of cancer patients throughout their illness, and can persist well after treatment has ended. Despite its prevalence, no definitive evidence-based treatment exists, leading to an abundance of proposed alternatives, including natural supplements. To further explore the potential effects of guaraná on cancer-related fatigue, a systematic review with meta-analysis was conducted and registered on the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (CRD42023484144). METHODS: A thorough search of PubMed/MEDLINE and Cochrane Library was conducted using MeSH terms and related keywords for cancer-related fatigue and guaraná. Eligible studies were selected according to predetermined criteria and assessed for quality in accordance with the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. Data extraction was independently performed by two reviewers, with any discrepancies resolved by a third researcher. RESULTS: In total, 4 full articles and 1 abstract, encompassing a total of 229 patients from 2009 to 2023, were included in the meta-analysis. Despite high heterogeneity between studies (I2=78%, ꭓ2=18.51, df=4, p=0.0010), the analysis revealed a significant benefit of using guaraná to alleviate cancer-related fatigue, with a standard mean difference of -0.77 (95%CI -1.34, -0.21) and a test for the overall effect of Z=2.68 (p=0.007). CONCLUSION: This meta-analysis provides support for the use of guaraná in the treatment of cancer-related fatigue. However, further investigation through larger prospective randomized controlled trials is necessary to validate these findings.",

      "abstract": "Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) have therapeutic potential due to their abilities of differentiation, immunomodulation, and migration to injured tissues, potentiating such effects when cells are activated. Guarana (Paullinia cupana) is a tropical plant species found in South America that is known for its antioxidant, stimulant, and cicatricial effects. The guarana extract is composed of many substances and caffeine is the main component. The objective was to evaluate the effects of guarana and caffeine on MSCs. After the initial characterization, MSCs were treated with Paullinia cupana (10, 100, and 1000 μg/mL) or caffeine (0.4, 4, and 40 μg/mL) for 24 h. MSCs treatment with 1000 μg/mL guarana increased cell polarity, viability, cell migration to chemoattractant, antioxidant potential, and liberation of extracellular vesicles (EVs), while it reduced the levels of autophagy. MSCs treated with 100 and 1000 μg/mL guarana or 40 μg/mL caffeine showed a decrease of cell proliferation. No treatment affected the cellular area and cell cycle of MSCs. The study shows in vitro evidence that guarana could be a promising alternative for activating MSCs to promote better cellular products for future clinical therapies.",

      "abstract": "Guarana (GUA), a Brazilian seed extract, contains caffeine and other bioactive compounds that may have psychoactive effects. To assess the acute effects of GUA compared to a low dose of caffeine (CAF) on cognitive and mood parameters, twenty participants completed a double-blind, crossover experiment where they ingested capsules containing the following: (1) 100 mg CAF, (2) 500 mg GUA containing 130 mg caffeine, or (3) placebo (PLA). Cognitive tests (Simon and 2N-Back Task) were performed at the baseline (pre-ingestion) and 60 min after ingestion. The response time for the cognitive tests and heart rate variability were unaffected (p > 0.05) by treatment, although 2N-Back was overall faster (p = 0.001) across time. The accuracy in the 2N-Back Task showed a significant interaction effect (p = 0.029) due to higher post-ingestion versus pre-ingestion levels (p = 0.033), but only with the PLA. The supplements also had no effect on cognitive measures following physical fatigue (n = 11). There was an interaction effect on perceived mental energy, where the pre-ingestion of GUA had lower mental pep ratings compared to post-ingestion (p = 0.006) and post-exercise (p = 0.018) levels. Neither the acute ingestion of GUA nor low dose of CAF influenced cognitive performance or provided consistent benefit on mood or mental workload through vagal modulation. Additional investigations are beneficial to determining the lowest effective dose for CAF or GUA to influence mood and/or cognitive performance.",

      "abstract": "This study investigated the effect of guarana on plasma lipid metabolites in obese rats and analyzed its mechanism in the treatment of dyslipidemia in obesity. High-fat diet was used to establish obese rat models, and the therapeutic effect of guarana on obese rats was evaluated by measuring body weight, white fat, liver weight, and lipid content, as well as observing liver histomorphology. Lipid metabolites in plasma of rats in each group were detected by UHPLC-Q-TOF-MS lipidomics. The protein expressions of fatty acid synthase, acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1, triglyceride synthesis enzyme, carnitine palmitoyltransferase Ⅰ, and acetyl-coenzyme A acyltransferase 2 in rat liver were detected using Western blot. The results revealed that guarana significantly reduced body weight, white fat, and liver weight of obese rats due to high-fat diet, and alleviated dyslipidemia and liver steatosis. Lipidomics showed that some triglycerides and phospholipids were significantly elevated in the high-fat model group, and part of them was reduced after guarana treatment. Western blot found that guarana inhibited the expression of hepatic fatty acid and triglyceride synthesis-related proteins and increased the expression of fatty acid β-oxidation-related proteins. Abnormalities in triglyceride and phospholipid metabolism are the main characteristics of plasma lipid metabolism in obese rats induced by high-fat diet. Guarana may regulate partial triglyceride and phospholipid metabolism by inhibiting hepatic fatty acid and triglyceride synthesis and increasing fatty acid β-oxidation, thereby improving rat obesity and dyslipidemia.",

However, these compounds are unstable in certain conditions, and their application into food products can be changed considering the processing parameters. This study aimed to encapsulate the carotenoid-rich extract from guaraná peels by spray drying (SD), characterize the microparticles, investigate their influence on the pasting properties of oatmeal paste, and evaluate the effects of temperature and shear on carotenoid stability during the preparation of this product. A rheometer with a pasting cell was used to simulate the extrusion conditions. Temperatures of 70, 80, and 90 °C and shear rates of 50 and 100 1/s were the parameters evaluated. Microparticles with a total carotenoid content between 40 and 96 µg/g were obtained. Over the storage period, carotenoid stability, particle size, color, moisture, and water activity varied according to the core:carrier material proportion used. Afterward, the formulation SD1:2 was selected to be incorporated in oatmeal, and the paste viscosity was influenced by the addition of this powder. β-carotene retention was higher than that of lutein following the treatment. The less severe treatment involving a temperature of 70 °C and a shear rate of 50 1/s exhibited better retention of total carotenoids, regardless of whether the carotenoid-rich extract was encapsulated or non-encapsulated. In the other treatments, the thermomechanical stress significantly influenced the stability of the total carotenoid. These results suggest that the addition of encapsulated carotenoids to foods prepared at higher temperatures has the potential for the development of functional and stable products."

The results indicate that a low concentration of GSC is capable of decreasing the plasma levels of oxidized DNA and pro-inflammatory cytokines of RRMS patients. The results support further research into the action of GSC on clinical symptoms, not only in patients with MS, but also with other neurological conditions.",

It is a native Brazilian species of great economic and social importance, particularly in the Amazon region. Anthracnose caused by Colletotrichum spp. is the main challenge for this crop. Therefore, the present study verified whether C. siamense, an endophytic fungus infected with a mycovirus, could protect the seedlings and reduce or eliminate the characteristic symptoms. Total proteins and enzymatic activities of pathogenesis-related proteins (PRPs), including peroxidase (POX), chitinase (CHI), and phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL), were quantified. Guarana seedlings of cultivar Maués were sprayed with a C. siamense conidia suspension (5.0 × 103 conidia/mL). After ten days, the seedlings were sprayed with a suspension of the phytopathogen's conidia (1.0 × 106 conidia/mL). One group of these seedlings received the fungicide indicated for this crop. The fungicide was applied twice with an interval of 15 days between applications. Negative control seedlings did not receive any treatment (except water and fertilization), and positive control seedlings were treated only with the phytopathogen. The experiment was conducted between December 2019 and February 2020 in a greenhouse. The treatments were applied at an average temperature of 25°C and 85% relative humidity. Leaflets were randomly collected from each treatment group at 0, 48, 72, and 96 hours after pathogen inoculation and analyzed for total protein and enzyme production (POX, PAL, and CHI). After 28 days, the percentage of leaf lesions on the seedlings was evaluated. C. siamense inoculation reduced lesions. There were differences in total proteins and PRPs at different timepoints after inoculation, except for CHI activity, among treatments. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first record of resistance induction in guarana plants."

METHODOLOGY: The data were extracted from the EMBASE, Scopus, MEDLINE, CENTRAL, and CINAHL databases, in any language, using the descriptors \"neoplasms\" and \"Paullinia\" or \"guarana powder\" and \"placebos\" and \"fatigue\". Searches were also conducted to identify any grey literature. Clinical studies with patients who presented cancer-related fatigue as a primary outcome and who used guarana as a dietary supplement were included. The risk of bias in randomized clinical trials was analyzed according to the Cochrane recommendations. The quality of the evidence was assessed using the GRADE system. For studies with the same types of tumors and treatments, meta-analysis was also conducted. RESULTS: A total of 383 studies were found and, of these, seven were included in the review, for a total of 427 cancer patients. The instruments used to analyze fatigue were the Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI), the Chalder Fatigue Scale, the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue (FACIT-FATIGUE), and the Piper Scale. Some studies presented a low risk of bias for all the categories. Meta-analysis was conducted for three studies about breast cancer, which presented sufficient data. The use of guarana did not reduce cancer-related fatigue compared with placebo groups (mean of - 0.02 [95% CI - 1.54, 1.50]; p = 0.98) and the quality of evidence according to GRADE was very low. CONCLUSION: Dietary supplements are used to improve cancer-related fatigue. The results of this review showed that the use of guarana was not superior to the placebo groups, pointing to the need for further studies with better methodological quality.",

Four treatments were prepared: control (without antioxidant); with BHT (10 mg/kg); with 250 mg/kg guarana extract (G250); with 250 mg/kg pitanga extract (P250). Analysis included the proximate composition (moisture, protein, fat, and ash) and sensory acceptance (day 0); pH, color (L*, a*, b*), TBARs, carbonyl content, DPPH, and visual sensory assessment (0, 6, 12, and 18 days); fatty acid profile and volatile compounds (0 and 18 days). G250 and P250 did not alter the centesimal composition and the acceptance of the lamb burgers on day 0. The extracts also delayed discoloration of the burgers, endowed the reddest intensity, and retarded lipid and protein oxidation throughout storage time, particularly P250, which presented the lowest TBARs levels (6.92 mg MDA/kg) and carbonyl values (5.59 nmol carbonyl/mg), and the highest antioxidant activity (249.48 μg Trolox/g), at day 18. The MUFA, SFA, and PUFA levels, AI, TI, and h/H ratio were comparable between treatments; only the n-6/n-3 ratio was higher in P250 treatment but within the recommended levels. More volatile compounds were derived from lipid oxidation in the control and BHT treatments than G250 and P250 treatments. As a result, both G250 and P250 groups are effective against color deterioration, and lipid and protein oxidation, without impairing the sensorial characteristics, representing a promising alternative to replace synthetic antioxidants by natural products in lamb burger.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Low-level laser therapy (LLLT) has several clinical applications; however, its benefits are not universal. Therefore, combination therapy with LLLT and extracts from the guarana (Paullinia cupana) plant may improve its effectiveness as guarana extracts exhibit anti-aging properties. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic, and proliferative effects of combined LLLT and guarana extract therapy on human dermal fibroblasts. METHODS: Human dermal fibroblasts (HFF-1) were cultured and initially exposed to several concentrations (1, 3, 5, 10, 30 µg/mL) of guarana extract. The experimental concentration of guarana extract was selected by analyzing cytokine levels, DNA oxidation, and apoptotic markers in LLLT-exposed (4 J/cm2 ) and LLLT-unexposed fibroblast cultures. After 72 hours, the cells were analyzed using spectrophotometric, fluorimetric, immunological, and gene expression (qRT-PCR) assays. Flow cytometry was used to evaluate the effect of each treatment on cell cycle. RESULTS: Fibroblasts treated with guarana (5 µg/mL) exhibited anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic properties been used in complementary protocols. Combined guarana and LLLT treatment significantly decreased protein carbonylation, lipoperoxidation, and DNA oxidation, downregulated the mRNA and protein expression of pro-inflammatory molecules, and upregulated IL-10 gene and protein expression. Guarana plus LLLT also decreased the levels of caspases 1, 3, and 8, increased the percentage of S-phase cells, and decreased FGF-1 and KGF-1 levels. Some of these changes were also observed after treatment with guarana or LLLT alone. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that concomitant treatment with guarana and LLLT may promote fibroblast biostimulation and thus is clinically relevant.",

      "abstract": "Hyperlipidemia causes lipotoxicity which prompts an inflammatory response linked to the development of cardiovascular diseases. Natural compounds have been receiving special attention for its potential to treat diseases, inexpensiveness, and safety. Guarana (Paullinia cupana) has demonstrated notable anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects, which may prevent chronic diseases caused by changes in lipid profile. Thus, this study aims to evaluate the effect of guarana powder (Paullinia cupana) in the purine metabolism and inflammatory profile in lymphocytes and serum of rats with Poloxamer-407-induced hyperlipidemia. Pretreatment with guarana 12.5, 25, and 50 mg/kg/day or caffeine (0.2 mg/kg/day) by gavage was applied to adult male Wistar rats for a period of 30 days. As a comparative standard, we used simvastatin (0.04 mg/kg) post-induction. Hyperlipidemia was acutely induced with intraperitoneally injection of Poloxamer-407 (500 mg/kg). Guarana powder and caffeine increased the activity of the E-NTPDase (ecto-apyrase), and all pretreatments decreased the E-ADA (ecto-adenosine deaminase) activity, reducing the inflammatory process caused by lipotoxicity. In hyperlipidemic rats, ATP levels were increased while adenosine levels were decreased, guarana and caffeine reverted these changes. Guarana powder, caffeine, and simvastatin also prevented the increase in INF-γ and potentiated the increase in IL-4 levels, promoting an anti-inflammatory profile. Guarana promoted a more robust effect than caffeine. Our results show that guarana powder and caffeine have an anti-inflammatory as seen by the shift from a proinflammatory to an anti-inflammatory profile. The effects of guarana were more pronounced, suggesting that guarana powder may be used as a complementary therapy to improve the lipotoxicity-associated inflammation.",

Gut microbes are affected by diet, and plant polyphenols may have positive effect on gut microbiota; however, plant-derived extracts may have toxic effects. Guarana (Paullinia cupana Mart.) is a nontraditional medicinal plant applied worldwide. Guarana yields an alkaloid and polyphenol-rich seed with antimicrobial, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory properties, where caffeine is the major compound. We evaluated the effects of guarana seed powder (GSP) and purified caffeine on gut microbial composition and redox and inflammatory parameters in Wistar rats after 21 days of treatment. Fecal microbiota was analyzed utilizing 16S rDNA sequencing. Antioxidant enzymes activities from liver, kidney, and colon, as well as oxidative damage markers, were evaluated. Total nonenzymatic antioxidant potential was also evaluated. Microbiota was altered by both treatments, GSP and caffeine, without loss of diversity. In the liver, the kidney, and the colon, we observed a decrease in the antioxidant enzymes activities in the GSP group with no increase in the expression of oxidative damage markers, although some enzymes were also regulated by caffeine. Taken together, these results suggested that GSP ameliorates redox parameters but negatively affected gut microbiota, partially via caffeine.",

      "abstract": "Alzheimer disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative brain disorder that causes significant disruption in normal brain functioning, representing the most common cause of dementia in the elderly. The main hallmark of AD is the presence of amyloid plaques in the brain formed by the deposition of insoluble amyloid protein (Aβ) outside of neurons. Despite intensive investigation of the mechanisms of AD pathogenesis during the past three decades, little has been achieved in terms of effective treatments or ways to prevent the disease. Paullinia cupana, known as guarana, is a plant endemic to the Amazon region in Brazil with several beneficial effects reported, including delayed aging. In this study, we investigated the effects of chronic consumption of guarana ethanolic extract (GEE) on Aβ toxicity using a C. elegans model of AD. We analyzed the behavioral phenotype, oxidative damage and Aβ protein expression in worms treated with GEE. In addition, we investigated the possible role of the heat shock response on the beneficial effects induced by GEE. Overall, our data demonstrate that chronic GEE treatment decreased the formation of Aβ aggregates in C. elegans, preventing the behavioral deficits and the oxidative damage inducible by Aβ expression, due to activation of the heat shock protein (HSP) response. This finding provides a new alternative against amyloidogenic neurodegenerative diseases and other diseases caused by protein accumulation during aging.",

Although previous studies have indicated that guarana has some protective effects in Parkinson's (PD), Alzheimer's (AD), and Huntington's (HD) disease models, the underlying mechanisms are unknown. Here, we investigated the protective effects of guarana hydroalcoholic extract (GHE) in Caenorhabditis elegans models of HD and AD. GHE reduced polyglutamine (polyQ) protein aggregation in the muscle and also reduced polyQ-mediated neuronal death in ASH sensory neurons and delayed β-amyloid-induced paralysis in a caffeine-independent manner. Moreover, GHE's protective effects were not mediated by caloric restriction, antimicrobial effects, or development and reproduction impairment. Inactivation of the transcription factors SKN-1 and DAF-16 by RNAi partially blocked the protective effects of GHE treatment in the AD model. We show that the protective effect of GHE is associated with antioxidant activity and modulation of proteostasis, since it increased the lifespan and proteasome activity, reduced intracellular ROS and the accumulation of autophagosomes, and increased the expression of SOD-3 and HSP-16.2. Our findings suggest that GHE has therapeutic potential in combating age-related diseases associated with protein misfolding and accumulation.",

Guarana (Paullinia cupana) is a Brazilian plant that has weight-reducing effects. Thus, this study aimed to evaluate the effects of Guarana on metabolic and inflammatory parameters in mice programmed by maternal obesity. METHODS: Swiss female mice were divided into two groups: control and high fat (HF), who received a standard diet or a high-fat diet (HFD), respectively, for 8 weeks prior to mating, gestation, and lactation. After post-natal day (PN) 21, the offspring of the HF group were subdivided into three groups: HF without treatment; HF early treatment, offspring treated with Guarana (1 g/kg bodyweight) in PN25-PN30; HF late treatment, offspring treated with Guarana (1 g/kg bodyweight) in PN65-PN75. Basal energy expenditure, the lipid profile and fasting glucose levels were determined. Body composition was evaluated by dissecting adipose tissue depots. Gene expression was analyzed using real-time PCR. RESULTS: During mating, the weight of HF females increased; after lactation, their adipose tissue depots and fasting glycemic levels also increased. The offspring of the HF group showed an increased body weight at PN21. At PN80, in the mice treated with Guarana (with both treatments), VO2 and energy expenditure increased, adipose tissue depots decreased, and the expression of leptin, IL-6, TNF-α, and MCP-1 decreased compared with that in the HF group. CONCLUSIONS: Guarana treatment at both stages of life reversed some of the alterations developed by the offspring of HF animals in adult life.",

The present study investigated this hypothesis in Caenorhabditis elegans, a suitable experimental model for studies in toxicology. Wild type (WT) and skn-1 (ok2315) worm strains were pretreated with guarana ethanolic extract (GEE) from larvae 1 (L1) to L4 stage and then exposed for 6 hours to methylmercury (MeHg). The analyses included evaluation of GEE's effects on lethality, developmental delay, feeding, locomotion, gene expression (sod-3, gst-4, sir-2.1, hsf-1, snn-1, mtl-1, mtl-2, aat-1, aat-2 and aat-3) and antioxidant activity. GEE pre-treatment had no aberrant effects on WT worms exposed to MeHg, and protected skn-1 (ok2315) worms, which are more susceptible to environmental stresses. Protective effects of GEE might be dependent on modulation of genes other than those directly involved in antioxidant activity. GEE increased the expression of genes involved in metal transport (aat-2), metal detoxification (mtl-1 and mtl-2) and antioxidant responses (sir-2.1 and sod-3). Thus, routine consumption of guarana might be beneficial in protecting against MeHg-induced toxicity."

Natural compounds have recently received special attention in relation to the treatment of disease due to their low cost and wide margin of safety. Thus, the aim of this study was to determine the possible preventive effect of guarana powder (Paullinia cupana) on memory impairment and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity in the brain structures of rats with Poloxamer-407-induced hyperlipidemia. Adult male Wistar rats were pretreated with guarana (12.5, 25 and 50mg/kg/day) and caffeine (0.2mg/kg/day) by gavage for a period of 30days. Simvastatin (0.04mg/kg) was administered as a comparative standard. Acute hyperlipidemia was induced with intraperitoneal injections of 500mg/kg of Poloxamer-407. Memory tests and evaluations of anxiety were performed. The cortex, cerebellum, hippocampus, hypothalamus and striatum were separated to assess acetylcholinesterase activity. Our results revealed that guarana powder was able to reduce the levels of TC and LDL-C in a manner similar to simvastatin. Guarana powder also partially reduced the liver damage caused by hyperlipidemia. Guarana was able to prevent changes in the activity of AChE and improve memory impairment due to hyperlipidemia. Guarana powder may therefore be a source of promising phytochemicals that can be used as adjuvant therapy in the management of hyperlipidemia and cognitive disorders.",

      "abstract": "UNLABELLED: Fatigue is a common symptom in patients with head and neck carcinoma who undergo chemoradiotherapy. Guarana (Paullinia cupana) is a plant that grows in the Brazilian Amazon region that was used previously to treat fatigue induced by chemotherapy. METHODS: In this phase II prospective study, we evaluated 60 patients with stage I-IV head and neck squamous cell carcinoma before, during, and after chemoradiotherapy. The patients were randomized into two arms: placebo versus guarana at a dose of 50 mg twice a day during the chemoradiotherapy treatment. We used the FACT-HN, EORTC-HN35, and EORTC-Q30 questionnaires to assess fatigue and quality of life (QOL). RESULTS: A significant worsening of QOL in the overall (p = 0.0054), functional (p = 0.018), and symptom (p = 0.0042) domains after the second cycle of chemotherapy was observed in patients using guarana compared to the placebo group. No significant differences in any QOL domain for either the guarana or placebo group were observed when the first and the fourth evaluations of each domain in each group were compared. Regarding the FACT-HN35 questionnaire, the guarana group showed improvement after the first cycle of chemoradiotherapy with respect to pain (p = 0.0133), social eating (p = 0.0227), swallowing (p = 0.0254), coughing (p = 0.0107), and weight loss (p = 0.012); however, after treatment completion (after the third cycle) weight loss worsened (p = 0.0074) and greater use of a nasogastric tube (p = 0.051), in addition to increased use of analgesics (p = 0.0253), was observed in the guarana group. Regarding the EORTC-QOL C30 questionnaire, improvement of symptoms in the three domains (functional, overall, and symptoms) was observed in patients using guarana. No significant difference was observed between the groups regarding toxicity as graded by the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) scale. CONCLUSION: We propose that guarana is not beneficial for this patient population."

Twelve participants completed a 15-day run-in period followed by a 15-day intervention with a daily intake of 3 g guaraná seed powder containing 90 mg (+)-catechin and 60 mg (-)-epicatechin. Blood samples were taken on the first and last day of the intervention period, fasting and 1 h post-dose. The administration of guaraná increased plasma ORAC, while reducing ex vivo LDL oxidation (only in the first study day) and hydrogen peroxide-induced DNA damage in lymphocytes, at 1 h post-dose. Plasma catechin (0.38 ± 0.12 and 0.44 ± 0.18 nmol mL(-1)), epicatechin (0.59 ± 0.18 and 0.64 ± 0.25 nmol mL(-1)) and their methylated metabolites were observed at 1 h post-dose but were almost negligible after overnight fasting. The activities of catalase (in both study days) and glutathione peroxidase (in the last intervention day) increased at 1 h post-dose. Furthermore, the activity of both enzymes remained higher than the basal levels in overnight-fasting individuals on the last intervention day, suggesting a prolonged effect of guaraná that continues even after plasma catechin clearance. In conclusion, guaraná catechins are bioavailable and contribute to reduce the oxidative stress of clinically healthy individuals, by direct antioxidant action of the absorbed phytochemicals and up-regulation of antioxidant/detoxifying enzymes.",

OBJECTIVE: The current study was designed to evaluate the hepatoprotective and genoprotective effects of powder seeds from guarana on CCl4-induced liver injury in rats. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Male Wistar rats were pretreated with guarana powder (100, 300 and 600 mg/kg) or silymarin 100 mg/kg daily for 14 days before treatment with a single dose of CCl4 (50% CCl4, 1 mL/kg, intraperitoneally). RESULTS: The treatment with CCl4 significantly increased the serum activities of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST). In addition, CCl4 increased the DNA damage index in hepatocytes. Guarana in all concentrations was effective in decreasing the ALT and AST activities when compared with the CCl4-treated group. The treatment with guarana decreased DNA damage index when compared with the CCl4-treated group. In addition, the DNA damage index showed a significant positive correlation with AST and ALT. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: These results indicate that the guarana has hepatoprotective activity and prevents the DNA strand breakage in the CCl4-induced liver damage in rats.",

In this pilot phase II, open label, nonrandomized trial, we evaluated the efficacy and safety of guarana (Paullinia cupana) in patients with cancer and weight loss. METHODS: We included advanced cancer patients with decreased appetite and weight loss of more than 5% from their baseline. All of the patients received 50 mg of the crude dry extract of guarana twice a day for 4 weeks. The trial was designed in two phases (Simon model). We considered a positive response in the first phase to be at least 5% weight gain or a three-point improvement in the appetite scale in at least three of the first 18 evaluable patients. RESULTS: Of the 34 eligible patients, 30 were included and 18 completed the protocol. Only one patient abandoned the protocol due to toxicity (grade II arthralgia). No grade 3 or 4 toxicities and no significant differences in nausea, weight loss, or quality of life (FACT-G) occurred. Only two of the 18 patients who completed the study had weight gain above 5% from their baseline, whereas six patients had at least a 3-point improvement in the visual appetite scale. The M.D. Anderson Symptom Inventory (MDASI) was used to evaluate several symptoms, and we observed a significant decrease in the lack of appetite (p = 0.02) and in somnolence (p = 0.0142). CONCLUSION: We concluded that the weight stabilization and increased appetite that we observed in this study justify further studies of guarana in this patient population.",

This report explores the acute brain electrophysiological changes associated with multivitamin and mineral supplementation, with and without guaraná, using the steady-state visually evoked potential (SSVEP). METHODS: Based on the known SSVEP correlates of A-X continuous performance task (CPT) performance, and sensitivity to acute psychopharmacological manipulations, the A-X CPT was adopted as a task paradigm to explore treatment-related neurophysiological changes in attentional processing. Twenty healthy non-smoking adults aged 21-39 years (mean age = 28.35 years, SD = 5.52) took part in this double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, balanced crossover design study. RESULTS: The study demonstrated both transient and tonic changes in the SSVEP response during completion of the A-X CPT following multivitamin and mineral treatment both with and without guaraná. Transient changes in SSVEP response in prefrontal regions were observed after a single dose of a multivitamin and mineral preparation indicative of enhanced activity within brain regions engaged by the attentional demands of the task. This pattern of change in frontal regions was correlated with improved behavioural performance after treatment with the multivitamin and mineral combination. Where tonic shifts in SSVEP response were investigated, multivitamin and mineral treatment was associated with a pattern of increased inhibition across posterior regions, with enhanced excitatory processing in prefrontal regions. In contrast, multivitamin and mineral treatment with additional guaraná showed a tonic shift towards greater excitatory processes after a single treatment, consistent with the caffeine content of this treatment. DISCUSSION: While preliminary in nature, these findings suggest a single multivitamin/mineral dose is sufficient to impact on functional brain activity in task-related brain regions.",

We aimed to evaluate the efficacy of a purified dry extract of P. cupana (PC-18) in patients with various solid tumors treated with chemotherapy. METHODS: We included 40 patients with solid tumors who showed increases in their Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI) questionnaire scores after 1 week of systemic chemotherapy. PC-18 was administered at 37.5 mg by mouth two times per day (PO bid), starting after 1 week of chemotherapy, for 3 weeks (induction phase). Patients who had an improvement in or stabilization of their BFI scores were randomized to receive either PC-18 at the same dose or placebo for the following 3 weeks (maintenance phase). RESULTS: After PC-18 treatment, the BFI fatigue scores improved or stabilized in 36 out of the 40 patients (mean BFI score difference = 2.503; 95% confidence interval: 1.716-3.375, p = .0002). Three weeks after randomization (16 patients on PC-18 and 17 on placebo), we observed no significant differences in the BFI, Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index scores between patients randomized to PC-18 versus placebo. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the PC-18 extract may be effective for the treatment of CRF in patients with a variety of solid tumors. A conditioning effect, which was observed in patients who had a beneficial effect of PC-18 on CRF, may explain the better than expected fatigue scores of the placebo-treated patients.",

Following a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomised, balanced crossover design, 20 participants (mean age 29 ± 5.54 years) consumed multivitamin preparations with or without guaraná (Berocca® Performance and Boost, respectively) and a placebo. Thirty minutes post-treatment, they underwent neurocognitive assessment, consisting of a 10 min Cognitive Demand Battery, with mood ratings taken immediately before and after the battery. Five additional participants underwent post-treatment fMRI scanning during Rapid Visual Information Processing and Inspection Time activation tasks. The multivitamin with guaraná treatment was associated with significantly enhanced Serial Threes performance and self-rated contentment. fMRI revealed that both multivitamin treatments increased activation in areas associated with working memory and attentional processing, with the effect being greater in the multivitamin with guaraná condition. These data confirm the acute benefits of multivitamins with guaraná on mood and cognitive performance. Furthermore, they demonstrate for the first time increased brain activation from multivitamin preparations both with and without guaraná, as measured using fMRI.",

To assess the effects on psychological well-being, anxiety and mood of a commercially available guaranà preparation taken regularly over several days according to the labelled dosages and instructions, 27 healthy volunteers were enrolled in a prospective, randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study. RESULTS: Guaranà 350 mg × 3 daily just after breakfast or placebo were given for 5 consecutive days. Assessment was performed one day after the last intake and included the psychological well-being (PWB) scales, the self-rating anxiety state scale (SAS), and the Bond-Lader mood scales. There were no significant differences between guaranà and placebo in any of the 6 areas of PWB, in SAS, as well as in any of the 16 mood scales. CONCLUSIONS: In healthy subjects a 5-day treatment with a commercial preparation of guaranà used according to labelled instructions provided no evidence for any major effects on psychological well-being, anxiety and mood. Considering the increasing popularity of guaranà-containing products sold as dietary supplements for fitness purposes, controlled studies are strongly warranted to assess their benefits in comparison to the labelled claims.",

However, most of the therapeutic properties attributed to this plant are broad and nonspecific, although an antioxidant activity has been reported.  On the other hand, cadmium is a heavy metal known for increasing free radicals, hence resulting in cellular oxidative damages. This study was designed to evaluate whether Paullinia cupana is able to reduce cadmium-induced morphological impairment in Wistar rat testis. Adult male Wistar rats 110 days old were ip injected with cadmium (1.15 mg/kg BW [body weight]) and subsequently treated with P. cupana during 56 days.  Furthermore, groups receiving either P. cupana extract or cadmium are mentioned. After the treatment period, testis samples were subjected to histological and stereological analyses. Moderate to severe testicular impairments were shown by the animals exposed to cadmium. However, the animals supplemented with P. cupana after cadmium exposure showed a significant decrease in the proportion of damaged seminiferous tubules. Also, P. cupana supplementation was effective in maintaining the number of Leydig cells per testis in the animals exposed to cadmium.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND:   The dermal extracellular matrix provides stability and structure to the skin. With increasing age, however, its major component collagen is subject to degeneration, resulting in a gradual decline in skin elasticity and progression of wrinkle formation. Previous studies suggest that the reduction in cellular energy contributes to the diminished synthesis of cutaneous collagen during aging. AIMS:   To investigate the potential of topically applied creatine to improve the clinical signs of skin aging by stimulating dermal collagen synthesis in vitro and in vivo. PATIENTS/METHODS:   Penetration experiments were performed with a pig skin ex vivo model. Effects of creatine on dermal collagen gene expression and procollagen synthesis were studied in vitro using cultured fibroblast-populated collagen gels. In a single-center, controlled study, 43 male Caucasians applied a face-care formulation containing creatine, guarana extract, and glycerol to determine its influence on facial topometric features. RESULTS:   Cultured human dermal fibroblasts supplemented with creatine displayed a stimulation of collagen synthesis relative to untreated control cells both on the gene expression and at the protein level. In skin penetration experiments, topically applied creatine rapidly reached the dermis. In addition, topical in vivo application of a creatine-containing formulation for 6 weeks significantly reduced the sagging cheek intensity in the jowl area as compared to baseline. This result was confirmed by clinical live scoring, which also demonstrated a significant reduction in crow's feet wrinkles and wrinkles under the eyes. CONCLUSIONS:   In summary, creatine represents a beneficial active ingredient for topical use in the prevention and treatment of human skin aging.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: In patients with breast cancer (BC) undergoing systemic chemotherapy, cancer-related fatigue (CRF) is a common problem that can negatively impact quality of life. Guarana (Paullinia cupana) is a plant native to the Amazon basin that has been used as a stimulant since pre-Columbian times. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of guarana extract on fatigue, sleep quality, anxiety, depression symptoms, and menopause in a group of BC chemotherapy patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with progressive fatigue after their first cycle of chemotherapy were randomized to receive either guarana 50 mg by mouth twice daily (32 patients) or placebo (43 patients) for 21 days. After a 7-day washout period, patients were crossed over to the opposite experimental arm. All patients were evaluated on days 1, 21, and 49. The primary endpoint was the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue (FACIT-F) questionnaire score, and secondary endpoints were the results of the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Endocrine Symptoms (FACT-ES), Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI), Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index, Chalder Fatigue Scale, and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. RESULTS: Guarana significantly improved the FACIT-F, FACT-ES, and BFI global scores compared to placebo on days 21 and 49 (p < 0.01). The Chalder Scale improved significantly on day 21 (p < 0.01) but not on day 49 (p = 0.27). Guarana did not produce any Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events grades 2, 3, or 4 toxicities and did not worsen sleep quality or cause anxiety or depression. CONCLUSIONS: Guarana is an effective, inexpensive, and nontoxic alternative for the short-term treatment of fatigue in BC patients receiving systemic chemotherapy. Further studies are needed to confirm these results and to evaluate their generalizability to chronic CRF and to other types of cancer.",

The selective serotonin (5-HT) reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) paroxetine (PAR; 3 mg/kg), was used as a positive control. To evaluate possible serotonergic and dopaminergic neurotransmission involvement in the action of PEA during the ETM test, ineffective doses of metergoline (MET; 5-HT (2A/2C) antagonist receptor) or sulpiride (SUL; dopaminergic receptor antagonist) were acutely administered together with the PEA. The locomotion of the rats was assessed in a circular arena following each drug treatment. Both PEA (8 and 16 mg/kg) and PAR (3 mg/kg) increased one-way escape latencies from the open arm of the ETM, indicating a panicolytic effect compared to the control group. MET, in higher doses (1, 2 or 3 mg/kg), produced a panicolytic effect in the ETM test, whereas SUL did not (10, 20 or 40 mg/kg). The panicolytic effect produced by PEA (8 mg/kg) was blocked by both MET (2 mg/kg) and SUL (20 mg/kg), whereas the panicolytic effect produced by PAR (3 mg/kg) was blocked only by MET (2 mg/kg). These results show that chronic treatment with PEA produces a panicolytic effect during the ETM test, and that the dopaminergic and the serotonergic neurotransmission systems are involved in this effect.",

In addition, a survival experiment was carried out with the same protocol. P. cupana decreased the ascites volume (p = 0.0120), cell number (p = 0.0004) and hemorrhage (p = 0.0054). This occurred through a G1-phase arrest (p < 0.01) induced by a decreased gene expression of Cyclin D1 in EAC cells. Furthermore, P. cupana significantly increased the survival of EAC-bearing animals (p = 0.0012). In conclusion, the P. cupana growth control effect in this model was correlated with a decreased expression of cyclin D1 and a G1 phase arrest.

On the other hand, one of the mechanisms underlying cadmium-induced cellular damage is free radical mediated, resulting in increased oxidative processes. This study investigated P. cupana's potential to attenuate cadmium-induced damages in Wistar rat testis. Adult male Wistar rats were either pre-treated with 2 mg/g body weight (BW) of powdered P. cupana seed during 56 days and/or injected with cadmium chloride at a dose of 1.15 mg/kg BW. After cadmium exposition (48 h), testes samples were evaluated by histological and stereological analyses. Both groups exposed to cadmium presented evident morphological alterations relative to control animals. A few rodents showed massive cell death in the seminiferous epithelium and intertubular space, indicating that some animals are more sensitive to cadmium. Despite the alterations observed in both groups, pre-treatment with P. cupana was effective in attenuating morphological changes in Leydig cells, as well as reducing inflammatory response, relative to animals exclusively exposed to the metal. Animals treated only with P. cupana presented a significant increase in plasma testosterone levels and a significant increase in volumetric proportions of seminiferous tubules, which are indicative of spermatogenic stimulation.",

DESIGN AND SETTING: This study had a double-blind randomized design with crossover between experimental arms, at Faculdade de Medicina da Fundação do ABC. METHODS: We conducted a randomized double-blind crossover trial with 36 patients with breast cancer undergoing adjuvant radiation therapy. We randomized patients to either guaraná 75 mg daily p.o. or to placebo. Patients were switched to the other experimental arm at the middle of the radiation treatment, which consisted of 28 daily fractions of 180 cGy. Evaluations were conducted at the beginning, at the middle, and at the end of radiation therapy. RESULTS: We were unable to show any statistically significant differences between the guaraná and the placebo-treated group with any of the measured scores. Also, within the same group, we did not see any statistically significant associations during either the guaraná- or placebo-treated periods with any of the aforementioned measures. CONCLUSIONS: We were unable to show that patients with breast cancer undergoing radiation therapy derive any advantage with guaraná over placebo for both fatigue and depressive symptoms.",

In the present experiment, we evaluated the effects of guaraná in an experimental metastasis model. Cultured B16/F10 melanoma cells (5 x 10(5) cells/animal) were injected into the tail vein of mice on the 7th day of guaraná treatment (2.0 mg P. cupana/g body weight, per gavage) and the animals were treated with guaraná daily up to 14 days until euthanasia (total treatment time: 21 days). Lung sections were obtained for morphometric analysis, apoptotic bodies were counted to calculate the apoptotic index and proliferating cell nuclear antigen-positive cells were counted to determine the proliferation index. Guaraná-treated (GUA) animals presented a 68.6% reduction in tumor burden area compared to control (CO) animals which were not treated with guaraná (CO: 0.84 +/- 0.26, N = 6; GUA: 0.27 +/- 0.24, N = 6; P = 0.0043), a 57.9% reduction in tumor proliferation index (CO: 23.75 +/- 20.54, N = 6; GUA: 9.99 +/- 3.93, N = 6; P = 0.026) and a 4.85-fold increase in apoptotic index (CO: 66.95 +/- 22.95, N = 6; GUA: 324.37 +/- 266.74 AB/mm(2), N = 6; P = 0.0152). In this mouse model, guaraná treatment decreased proliferation and increased apoptosis of tumor cells, consequently reducing the tumor burden area. We are currently investigating the molecular pathways of the effects of guaraná in cultured melanoma cells, regarding principally the cell cycle inhibitors and cyclins.",

Anxiolytic-like, antidepressant-like and motor stimulant effects were evaluated using the plus maze (PMT), forced swimming (FST) and open field (OFT) tests, respectively. Acute or chronic administration of EBPC (3.0, 30.0 or 60.0 mg/kg) did not alter the percentage of entries or the time spent in the open arm in the PMT. In the FST, chronic treatment with 30.0 mg EBPC/kg and 4.0 mg EPA/kg extract decreased the immobility time similarly to the antidepressant reference drug, imipramine (20.0 mg/kg). Locomotor activity in the OFT was not increased by these extracts. Caffeine (10.0 mg/kg) significantly reduced the immobility time in the FST, but increased locomotor activity in the OFT, indicating psychostimulant activity. The EPB extract did not induce any effect after acute or chronic treatment in the different models used. The present results suggest that the crude EBPC extract and EPA extract produced an antidepressant-like effect after long-term administration.",

      "abstract": "Guarana (Paullinia cupana Mart. var. Sorbilis) is a plant originally from Brazil, which is rich in tannins. Some tannins are known to present protective effects against DNA damage. This study was performed to investigate the anti-genotoxic/cytotoxic properties of guarana in hepatocytes of mice injected with N-nitrosodiethylamine (DEN). The protective effect of guarana was evaluated both by comet assay and DNA smear fragmentation technique in two month-old female BALB/c mice. These were treated previously with 2.0 mg/g bw of guarana for 16 days and then injected with DEN (160 microg/g body weight) to induce DNA damage. The DEN-only treated group presented higher comet image length than the guarana plus DEN and untreated groups (116.06+/-5.0 microm, 104.09+/-3.3 microm and 93.28+/-14.4 microm, respectively; p<0.01). Guarana treatment presented a 52.54% reduction in comet image length when animals were exposed to DEN (p<0.05). DNA samples from the guarana plus DEN group clearly showed less EtBr fluorescence intensity when compared to the DEN-only group, reinforcing the comet assay data. These results show, for the first time, that guarana has a protective effect against DEN-induced DNA damage in mouse liver.",

      "abstract": "Herbal supplements have been used as adjuncts to medical therapy for many years by various cultures. Many consumers believe that because herbal supplements are natural products, they are somewhat safer or more effective than traditional prescribed medications. This is also one reason that alternative medicine is growing and gaining more popularity. On the other hand, adverse reactions to herbal supplements or their interactions with patients' current medications are no different than pharmaceutical medicines. We report a case of premature ventricular contraction associated with two herbal supplements. These products contained multiple different herbs and both included large doses of guarana. Guarana, which is found in some supplements marketed in U.S., contains a substantial amount of caffeine. Although the exact cause of tachycardia in our report is not proven, a large amount of caffeine consumption is thought to be a possible causal effect. The purpose of this report is to remind health care professionals to evaluate and educate patients on the use of herbal products and any potential adverse reactions, drug interactions, or possible toxicities."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To examine in overweight humans the short-term safety and efficacy for weight loss of an herbal supplement containing Ma Huang, Guarana and other ingredients. DESIGN: An 8 week randomized, double-blind placebo controlled study of a herbal dietary supplement (72 mg/day ephedrine alkaloids and 240 mg/day caffeine). SUBJECTS: Overweight men and women (body mass index, > or =29 and < or =35 kg/m2). MEASUREMENTS: The primary outcome variable was body weight change. Secondary variables included anthropometric, metabolic and cardiovascular changes. RESULTS: Sixty-seven subjects were randomized to either placebo (n=32) or active Ma Huang/Guarana (n=35). Twenty-four subjects in each group completed the study. Active treatment produced significantly (P<0.006) greater loss of weight (X+/-s.d.,-4.0+/-3.4 kg) and fat (-2.1+/-3.0% fat) over the 8-week treatment period than did placebo (-0.8+/-2.4 kg and 0.2+/-2.3% fat). Active treatment also produced greater reductions in hip circumference and serum triglyceride levels. Eight of the 35 actively treated subjects (23%) and none of the 32 placebo-treated control subjects withdrew from the protocol because of potential treatment-related effects. Dry mouth, insomnia and headache were the adverse symptoms reported most frequently by the herbal vs placebo group at the final evaluation visit. CONCLUSIONS: This herbal mixture of Ma Huang and Guarana effectively promoted short-term weight and fat loss. Safety with long-term use requires further investigation.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To describe the clinical signs following ingestion of an herbal supplement containing guarana and ma huang in dogs, estimate minimum dose at which clinical signs of toxicosis and death were reported, and evaluate treatment options. DESIGN: Retrospective study. ANIMALS: 47 dogs with evidence of ingestion of an herbal supplement containing primarily guarana and ma huang. PROCEDURE: Records of dogs that had ingested an herbal supplement containing ma huang and guarana between July 1997 and October 1999 were retrieved from the National Animal Poison Control Center database. Data were retrieved and reviewed regarding signalment, dose ingested, clinical signs, laboratory test results, treatment, and final outcome. Cases were assessed by staff veterinarians as toxicosis or suspected toxicosis on the basis of strength of evidence supporting a diagnosis. RESULTS: Most dogs (80%) developed clinical signs of toxicosis within 8 hours of ingestion, and clinical signs persisted for up to 48 hours. Hyperactivity, tremors, seizures, and behavior changes were reported in 83% of dogs; other signs included vomiting (47%), tachycardia (30%), and hyperthermia (28%). Seventeen percent of the dogs died or were euthanatized. Estimated doses of guarana and ma huang ranged from 4.4 to 296.2 mg/kg (1.98 to 133.2 mg/lb) and 1.3 to 88.9 mg/kg (0.58 to 40.0 mg/lb) of body weight, respectively; minimum dose at which death was reported was 19.1 mg of guarana/kg (8.7 mg/lb) and 5.8 mg of ma huang/kg (2.6 mg/lb). CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Accidental ingestion of herbal supplements containing primarily guarana and ma huang in dogs can lead to a potentially lethal condition that may require prompt detoxification and supportive treatment for several days. Most dogs recovered with supportive treatment.",

Such an effect, however, was not obtained with a concentration of 3.0 mg/ml, nor with the ingestion of a suspension of ginseng 5.0 mg/ml, nor of a solution of caffeine 0.1 mg/ml. Guarana, both after a single (3.0 and 30 mg/kg) or chronic administrations (0.3 mg/ml), was able to partially reverse the amnesic effect of scopolamine as measured through a passive avoidance test in mice and rats, indicating a positive effect on memory acquisition. However, no effect was observed when an active avoidance task was used in rats, even after 20 days of guarana administration. There was also a tendency of rats treated with 0.3 mg/ml of guarana to better maintain the memory of a Lashley III maze path. The animals had the same average lifespan, indicating a low toxicity of guarana, even after 23 months of treatment.",
