      "abstract": "Art therapy has been proven to be efficacious in alleviating symptoms of children diagnosed with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), with the advent of artificial intelligence providing new technological means to engage and increase the participation levels of ADHD children. Nonetheless, research on the application of AI in art therapy remains scant. This study, predicated on a method involving ADHD children co-creating art with AI, has devised a therapeutic activity aimed at ameliorating their attention deficits. By conducting standardized measurements with the SNAP-IV 26 questionnaire and qualitative analyses of the art created by 16 ADHD children, the effectiveness of the \"Co-creation with AI\" activity was assessed. Findings indicate that this activity, through a process encompassing engagement, action, variable rewards, and sustained involvement, has facilitated ADHD children in focusing their attention and ameliorating their hyperactive behavioral issues. However, it offered minimal assistance in addressing their oppositional defiant behavior. The co-creative approach with machines has effectively enriched the emotional expression of ADHD children and mobilized their enthusiasm. Nevertheless, the instability in AI's painting style and its variability may lead to a diminution in the children's interest over time. The guidance of therapists and communication in daily life are indispensable elements."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to examine the impact of a nursing intervention based on stress system theory, coupled with painting therapy, on children experiencing post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) subsequent to an accidental injury. METHODS: The clinical data of 100 children diagnosed with PTSD following accidental injuries were retrospectively analyzed for the period spanning April 2021 to May 2023. There were 48 children who received standard nursing care between April 2021 and April 2022 in the control group, and 52 children who received nursing intervention based on stress system theory combined with painting therapy between May 2022 and May 2023 in the observation group. Scores of PTSD Self-evaluation Scale (PTSD-SS), post-traumatic growth, coping style, quality of life, and family satisfaction were compared between the two groups. RESULTS: Prior to nursing care, the scores of each dimension in the PTSD-SS, post-traumatic growth, coping style, and quality of life were similar between the two groups (P > 0.05). Following nursing intervention, the observation group exhibited lower scores in each dimension of the PTSD-SS compared to the control group. Moreover, the scores in each dimension of the children's version of the Post-Traumatic Growth Inventory (PTGI) were higher in the observation group than in the control group. Additionally, the Confrontation scores in the Medical Coping Modes Questionnaire (MCMQ) were higher in the observation group than in the control group, while the scores of Avoidance and Resignation were lower in the observation group than in the control group. The scores of each dimension in the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory Measurement Models (PedsQL4.0) were higher than those in the control group (P < 0.05), and the family satisfaction in the observation group (96.15%) was higher than that in the control group (81.25%), with P < 0.05. CONCLUSION: The implementation of nursing intervention based on stress system theory combined with painting therapy in children with PTSD following an accidental injury can alleviate stress, help them actively cope with the condition, promote post-traumatic growth, and improve the quality of life and family satisfaction."

METHODS: 400 cases with anxiety disorder were recruited, and randomly divided into the experimental group and the control group with 200 cases in each group. Patients in the control group received drug therapy alone, while experimental group was combined with painting treatment on the basis of control group. The Nurses Observation Scale for Inpatient Evaluation (NOSIE) was used for the evaluation of mental and social functioning. Clinical efficacy was evaluated according to the degree of reduction in the Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD) score. RESULTS: After 8 weeks of treatment, the experimental group had a lower HAMD score than those in the control group. After 8 weeks of treatment, mental and social functions in both groups improved significantly. And the social competence, social interest and personal cleanliness of the experimental group were better than those of the control group, and the degree of irritability, retardation and depression were lower than those of the control group. In comparison with the control group, the experimental group had a higher cure rate and remarkable response rate. CONCLUSIONS: Painting therapy combined with drug therapy can relieve anxiety symptoms of patients with anxiety disorder, improve their mental and social functions, and improve clinical efficacy.",

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: Research on painting therapy is available worldwide and painting therapy is widely applied as a psychological therapy in different fields with diverse clients. As an evidence-based psychotherapy, previous studies have revealed that painting therapy has favorable therapeutic effects. However, limited studies on painting therapy used universal data to assemble in-depth evidence to propose a better recommendation on it for the future use. Large-scale retrospective studies that used bibliometric methodology are lacking. Therefore, this study presented a broad view of painting therapy and provided an intensively analytical insight into the structure of knowledge regarding painting therapy employing bibliometric analysis of articles. CiteSpace software was used to evaluate scientific research on painting therapy globally published from January 2011 to July 2022. METHODS: Publications related to painting therapy from 2011 to 2022 were searched using the Web of Science database. This study employed bibliometric techniques to perform co-citation analysis of authors, visualize collaborations between countries/regions as network maps, and analyze keywords and subjects relevant to painting therapy by using CiteSpace software. RESULTS: In total, 871 articles met the inclusion criteria. We found that the number of painting therapy publications generally trended incrementally. The United States and United Kingdom made the most contributions to painting therapy research and had the greatest impact on the practical application in other countries. Arts in Psychotherapy and Frontiers in Psychology occupied key publishing positions in this research field. The application groups were mainly children, adolescents, and females, and Western countries paid high attention to painting therapy. The main areas of application of painting therapy were Alzheimer's disease and other psychosomatic disease fields. Identified research priorities for painting therapy were emotion regulation and mood disorder treatment, personality disorder treatment, personal self-esteem enhancement, and medical humanistic care. Three keywords, \"depression,\" \"women,\" and \"recovery,\" had the strongest citation bursts, which emphasized the research trends. CONCLUSION: The general trend for painting therapy research is positive. Our findings provide useful information for researchers on painting therapy to determine new directions in relate to popular issues, collaborators, and research frontiers. Painting therapy holds a promising future, and further studies could explore the clinical implications of this therapy in terms of mechanisms and criteria for assessing efficacy."

      "abstract": "Introduction Essential tremor (ET) is a common movement disorder in the elderly. Bilateral postural tremor usually involves the hands and forearms; the primary diagnostic criteria can be with or without a kinetic tremor. Anticonvulsants are frequently prescribed as a primary medication, and botulinum toxin and deep brain stimulation as secondary options. In this case report, a patient with ET received medical painting therapy guided by the principles of anthroposophy and the work of Liane Collot d´Herbois. Case Presentation A 78-year-old woman presented ET, depression and bipolar symptoms. Additionally, she reported insomnia, constipation, lumbar pain, and sciatic pain. Current medications included lithium carbonate, folic acid, levothyroxine, and zinc, and she had refused to take propranolol for her ET. She agreed to begin medical painting therapy. Over 5 months, she had 16 sessions of medical painting therapy, carried out in 2 stages. The first stage consisted of 6 free painting sessions for patient evaluation, followed by the second stage of 10 therapeutic sessions. Conclusion The patient reported an increased quality of life (including emotional aspects) and a decrease in her ET, as evidenced by the patient's handwriting. Further research is needed to understand the strengths and limitations of this therapy for ET and related conditions.",

Since painting therapy seems to be helpful to express their feelings, this study aimed to investigate the effects of virtual directed painting therapy on anxiety, depression, and self-efficacy in diabetic children. METHODS: This randomized controlled trial was conducted on 40 children with type 1 diabetes aged 8-12 years who were referred to Imam Reza Clinic of Diabetes in Shiraz, from July to October 2020. Children were randomly selected and assigned to intervention and control groups, using block randomization. The intervention group received the routine care plus virtual painting therapy directed by WhatsApp (six 2-hour group sessions once a week for six weeks). Spence Children's Anxiety Scale, Maria Kovacs Children's Depression Inventory, and Diabetes Management Self-Efficacy Scale were completed before and after the intervention. Data were analyzed through SPSS 23, using Chi-square, Mann-Whitney U, and Wilcoxon tests. P value <0.05 was considered as significant. RESULTS: After the intervention, the median (interquartile range) total scores for anxiety, depression, and self-efficacy in the intervention group were 48.50 (45.00-51.75), 7.00 (4.00-9.00), and 169.00 (154.00-178.00), and in the control group 55.00 (48.50-62.25), 13.00 (10.00-17.50), and 152.00, respectively (110.50-184.00). After the intervention, there was a significant difference between the groups regarding anxiety (P=0.02) and depression (P<0.001); however, the difference in self-efficacy was not significant (P=0.20). CONCLUSION: Painting therapy should be considered as a part of care programs in diabetes centers and other community settings to control anxiety and depression of diabetic children.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: There are not many drugs for teen depression, and many antidepressants are not recommended for people under the age of 14 years. Thus, cognitive behavioral therapy, such as art therapy, is widely used in the treatment of adolescent depression. Group painting therapy (GPT) is a psycho-art treatment that allows the artist to engage in the creative process of painting. METHODS: Chinese and English databases were searched with a combination of words, including \"Adolescent depression\", \"Group painting therapy\", \"Art therapy\", and \"Depression\". A meta-analysis of the literature was carried out using the Cochrane system (RevMan 5.3). RESULTS: Six randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were included in this study, of which 4 (66.66%) adopted the correct random assignment method, and 1 (16.67%) adopted a hidden detailed assignment scheme. One (16.67%) article adopted a blind method to evaluate the results. After GPT, depressed adolescent patients' positive emotion scores improved significantly [mean deviation (MD) =4.62, 95% confidence interval (CI) (3.79, 5.45), P<0.01] as did patients' negative emotion scores [MD =-1.88, 95% CI (-2.29, -1.46), P<0.01]. Patients' cognitive function and executive ability were also significantly improved by GPT. DISCUSSION: The results of our systematic evaluation and meta-analysis confirmed that GPT significantly improves adolescent depression and relieves patients' negative emotions.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Anthroposophic painting therapy (APT) is a specific form of art therapy that aims to activate self-healing capacities through painting aquarelles. METHODS: The Anthroposophic Art Therapy Assessment-Paint' (AART-ASSESS-P) was developed to measure pictorial expression and validated in the framework of a comprehensive cohort design study. The validation study examined 68 breast cancer patients with fatigue. Art therapists made pre- and post-assessments of spontaneously drawn water-color paintings with a preliminary version of the AART-ASSESS-P (58 items). Inter-rater reliability (IRR) for the items was examined with Cohen's weighted Kappa (κw). Additionally, a reliability- and factor analysis (FA) were conducted. Convergence criteria were patients' self-report measures: the Satisfaction with Painting Therapy, Inner Correspondence with Painting Therapy and the Self-Regulation Questionnaire. RESULTS: IRR for the items was heterogeneous (κw= 0.09-0.89, Mean κw= 0.40, SD = 0.17). Thirty-six items were excluded due to insufficient IRR and item-total correlation (κw= < 0.30, ρitem-total< 0.30). A FA with 22 items revealed 5 subscales: Shape Development (6 items), Shape Arrangement (6 items), Order and Symmetry (5 items), Color Application (3 items), and Color Quality (2 items) explaining 61% of total variance. Psychometric properties for the AART-ASSESS-P were satisfying with Cronbach's alpha coefficients (rα = 0.60-0.81) across subscales. Due to weak inter-subscale correlations (r = 0.18-0.48, p < 0.05) and the ambiguity of face validity a sum-score was not formed. Correlations between subscales and self-reports were small (all p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The AART-ASSESS-P is the first reliable instrument to measure pictorial expression during APT.",

Though it remains unknown how ArT works, we hypothesize that an engaged participation with painting ('Inner-Correspondence') contributes to improved symptom scores. In the context of a comprehensive cohort study for breast cancer survivors with cancer-related fatigue, we developed a patient-reported outcome measure to assess 'Inner Correspondence' with painting therapy and conducted a first validation study. Design A 24-item questionnaire on 'Inner Correspondence' (ICPTh) was administered after ten weeks of intervention and at six month followup together with concurrent scales (Inner Correspondence and Peaceful Harmony, Cancer Fatigue Scale, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, Internal Coherence Scale). Statistical assessment included reliability- and factor analyses. Results A total of n = 68 BC (mean age, 58.2 years, SD = 8.7) participated in the preliminary validation study. Exploratory factor analysis revealed a robust 22-item scale with an unambiguous four-factor solution explaining 78% of total variance and the following subsales: 1) therapy congruence and relaxation (11 items), 2) inner development and mood (6 items), 3) artistic skill (3 items) and 4) task congruence (2 items). The 22-item ICPTh yielded high reliability (Cronbach's alpha = .966, item-total correlation = .497 - .883, test-retest reliability = .888). Conclusions We present a reliable instrument to measure 'Inner Correspondence' with painting therapy. Due to the small sample size and sample selection further validation studies are indicated.",

Ilse's pictures show that she is confronted with the underlying conflicts of her disorder, particularly her relationship to her father and her mis-routed corporealisation. At the same time, we used Beck's Depression Inventory, the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, and recorded the frequency of episodes of bingeing, insatiable appetite and purging using behavioural protocols. Painting, individual and family therapy, and exercises designed to improve bodily awareness were all integrated in a helically-shaped process; the patient was ultimately able to rid herself of her bulimic symptoms, dissociate herself from her birth family, and gain new access to herself and her body.",

      "abstract": "The bulimic symptomatology--supposedly an expression of certain developments in our society--increased immensely. The progress of Integrative Painting Therapy applied to a bulimia nervosa patient, is simultaneously visible and documented. This gives insight into the psychodynamics and psychopathology of this disorder, as well as its development during treatment. The painting group provides a quick access to the patient's emotions and it permits the establishment of a strong therapeutic relationship. Paintings generated within the group reflect a patient's inner experiences and provide a starting-point for the therapeutic process. In her pictures, Irene confronts her bulimia disorder and is finally able to come to terms with her social role as a woman, her growing up and her longing for a healthy family background especially meaning contact with her father. In this spirally evolving process, where painting groups, single and family therapy work together, she was finally able to break free from her bulimic symptoms and find a new access to herself and her family, especially her father.",

      "abstract": "At the Department of Psychiatry, University Hospital Graz, we have been applying a concept for treating bulimia nervosa, using a complementary method involving psychosocial and psychotherapeutic strategy as well as psychotropic medication. Thus we have been able to approach the patients from a holistic view. Painting and drawing as a creative method constitute another salient part of our concept. Between January 1995 and September 1999, 36 in-patients with bulimia were treated in the Psychotherapy Unit of the University Hospital's Department of Psychiatry in Graz; our concept focussed on \"Integrative Painting Therapy\". The wide variety of treatment methods comprised individual and group therapy, diet counselling and thymoleptics (SSRIs). Teamwork and close links within the team constituted an important part of our work, so that the different types of therapy are process-oriented and thus interrelated. In the initial phase of the symptom-oriented approach patients learn to control and ultimately normalise their eating habits. In the phase of acting out and/or conflict awareness, they try to cope with their disorder on a pictorial level. They gain access to their emotions and become aware of their problems, while their eating habits improve. Self-esteem is eventually stabilised and patients develop a sense of self-responsibility and work on effective strategies to cope with their disorder. This development also manifests itself in their pictorial expressions. \"Integrative Painting Therapy\" led to a marked improvement of the depressive moods initially prevalent in all patients. It also slightly elevated their Body Mass Index. Moreover, control capacity increased significantly, irregularities in eating habits were reduced and craving for food subsided.",

      "abstract": "Integrative painting therapy is a therapeutic concept for the treatment of psychiatric patients. It combines medical and therapeutic treatment strategies. The painting group is the main component of this type of therapy. Its focus is to capture psychodynamic processes by means of \"inner pictures\". The creative process of painting causes these pictures to become visible; the pictures are then worked upon. Interpreted in accordance with specific rules, the pictures reflect the psychopathology of different psychiatric disorders as well as their development throughout the therapeutic process. The pictures also serve as a starting point for group, single or family therapy. The patients quickly gain access to their emotions and become aware of conflicts which form the basis of their psychodynamics. Their progress through therapy becomes apparent and can be documented by means of the pictures. The structured course of the painting sessions provides additional information. The integration of various aspects, e.g. the phenomenology of the pictures, statements of patients about their pictures, or the behaviour of the patients within the group, serve to increase our fund of diagnostic information. Major aspects of this therapeutic concept are the development of teamwork and the establishment of close contact within the team. This makes it possible to apply different concepts within the program, in accordance with the needs of each patient. The integration of different approaches of treatment promotes the development of a therapeutic environment that supports forces of self-healing and growth in specific stages of therapy.",
