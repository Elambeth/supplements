      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Traumatic posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA) aneurysms are rare. Fractures of the occipital condyles (OCs) have been reported to cause delayed hypoglossal nerve (HN) palsy possibly. CASE DESCRIPTION: A 67-year-old man fell while hiking on a mountain. On initial presentation at a local hospital, the patient exhibited right abducens nerve palsy and hoarseness. Cranial computed tomography (CT) revealed multiple intracranial air densities, with no remarkable hemorrhages detected in the cerebral cisterns. In addition, fractures involving both the OCs and clivus were identified, along with a collapsed left hypoglossal canal. Three days later, the patient developed a severe headache and coma. CT showed an extensive subarachnoid hemorrhage in the perimedullary and basal cisterns. After conservative management, the patient was transferred to our hospital. On examination, no instability in the craniocervical region was found; however, marked atrophy was noted in the left tongue. Cerebral angiography revealed a fusiform aneurysm in the proximal PICA. Stent-assisted coil embolization was successfully performed. The patient was eventually transferred to a rehabilitation facility. CONCLUSION: Traumatic PICA aneurysms may be complicated by HN palsy. A thorough evaluation with clinical and radiological examinations is essential for correct diagnosis and appropriate treatment."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: While leisure activities have been shown to have bio-psycho-social benefits for individuals with disabilities, there is a notable gap in the literature regarding the quantitative analysis of the effects of adapted hiking. This study, therefore, aims to fill this void by using standardised tools to evaluate the enhancement in quality of life and self-efficacy following a hiking experience in individuals with motor disabilities. METHODS: The intervention took place on natural paths by transporting Joëlette people who use wheelchairs for daily mobility. The rating scales were administered before the activity (T0) and three weeks after participation (T1). The outcomes were measured through the Wheelchair use Confidence Scale for manual wheelchair users (WheelCon-M), the Spinal Cord Injury-Falls Concern Scale (SCI-FCS), the Craig Hospital Inventory of Environmental Factors (CHIEF), the Impact on Participation and Autonomy (IPA), the Community Integration Questionnaire-Revised (CIQ-R) and the Moorong Self Efficacy Scale (MSES). RESULTS: 34 people were recruited and participated in the study. The participants had an average age of 41 years; 28 used manual wheelchairs, and 6 used electric wheelchairs in their daily lives. From the analysis of the Wilcoxon rank test, the scores of the WheelCon-M were found to be statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: This study significantly contributes to the scientific literature by providing quantitative data on the impact of adapted activities, particularly adapted hiking. The findings position adapted hiking as a valid intervention to support traditional rehabilitation treatments, specifically in enhancing confidence in wheelchair management."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Physical activity (PA) is essential for healthy aging, yet PA levels are low in older adults. Group-based nature programming may be an ideal opportunity for engaging older adults in PA and improving health-related quality of life. METHODS: Twenty-seven older adults, 55-75 years of age (n = 14 active and n = 13 previously inactive), enrolled in a biweekly 8-week hiking program. At baseline, participants completed online questionnaires on health-related quality of life, behavioral and psychological outcomes, and a one-mile walk test to assess cardiorespiratory fitness. RESULTS: Average attendance was 81% in the previously inactive groups and 74% in the active group. There was a significant increase in the physical component of quality of life over time in the previously inactive group (p = .03, d = 0.71). Participants significantly improved their cardiorespiratory fitness (p = .003, d = 0.77) and competency (p = .005, d = 0.41) as assessed by the Basic Psychological Needs for Exercise Scale. The previously inactive group additionally increased their self-efficacy for exercise (p = .001, d = 1.43). Both active and previously inactive groups exercised at a similar relative intensity during the hikes based on heart rate; however, perceived exertion at the end of the hike on average was lower among active participants (p = .014). CONCLUSION: Group-based hiking for previously inactive older adults significantly improved physical health-related quality of life over an 8-week biweekly intervention. Hiking at an individualized pace may allow for hiking to be an appropriate PA program in previously inactive older adults.",

      "abstract": "METHODS: Physical activities and sports in nature offer opportunities for leisure, health, and well-being. A randomized clinical trial (RCT) compared the effects of training, dualtask orienteering and single-task hiking in independent older adults (n = 90) allocated into three groups: orienteering group (OG), hiking group (HG) and control group (CG). Timed Up and Go (TUG) tests, including a dual-task (TUG-DT), and cognitive tests were administered. Differences were analyzed by Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE) and the effect size (ES) was calculated. Unpaired and paired tests were used for the evaluation of basic differences and after 24 weeks of intervention. RESULTS: This RCT highlights the interaction effects between groups and time. Only the OG in TUGDT reduced by 6 s, with change of 42% (ES=0.77). Likewise, Dual TUG + cognitive stops (TUG-DT+ CS) and Dual TUG + cognitive stops + cognitive errors (TUG-DT + CS + CE), reduced 7 (ES=0.85) and 8 (ES=0.90) seconds (<0.001). The task cost improved by 75% for OG and 24% for HG (p = 0.001), with an ES of 0.56 for OG. For cognition, there was a 49.2% increase (ES=2.00) for OG and 16.5% for HG in executive functions and visuospatial skills, a 31.4% increase (ES=1.64) for OG and 14.7% for HG in processing speed, and a 39.8% increase (ES=1.62) for OG and 6.5% for HG in memory. All interactions were <0.001. CONCLUSION: The orienteering demonstrated that has potential benefits in effectively improving gait performance and preventing cognitive decline in older adults.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Physical activity promotes health, and physical activity done outdoors in nature may be particularly beneficial. We conducted two randomized studies to examine the implementation of a winter hiking intervention and whether this intervention affected activity choices and aspects of well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Convenience samples of adults (n = 53; n = 51) were recruited into two different randomized studies in 2021 and 2022 respectively. Participants completed online surveys at baseline and 6 and 11-12 weeks later. Participants were randomized to a study group (intervention or control) shortly after the baseline assessments. In both studies, the intervention group received free access to a regional winter hiking challenge. In the second study, we also provided winter traction cleats to this group to facilitate engagement in the hiking challenge. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize intervention implementation, including participants' engagement in challenge hikes. Repeated measures ANOVA models were used to test intervention effects on key outcome variables, including hiking frequency via the Pleasant Activities List, stress via the Perceived Stress Scale, and sleep duration via the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. RESULTS: In the first study, the intervention group's engagement in challenge hikes was low (38.5%); reported barriers included access to winter hiking equipment. In the second study, when winter traction cleats were provided, engagement in the intervention was higher, and the intervention increased hiking frequency and improved sleep. There were no significant intervention effects on stress, but the direction of effects was in the expected direction. CONCLUSIONS: Results highlight some potential positive impacts of this intervention designed to facilitate access to winter hiking. Future research could examine whether effects are stronger in a larger sample, in which additional barriers to engagement are addressed.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Lifelong physical activity is related to longer health span, which is reflected at an individual level, and is of substantial socioeconomic relevance. Sedentary lifestyles, on the other hand, pose an increasingly major public health problem. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic had a negative impact on activity levels and well-being. Previous research indicates that contact with nature might improve exercise levels as well as well-being. METHODS: This randomized, controlled clinical trial (ANKER-study) investigated the effects of two types of nature-based therapies (forest therapy and mountain hiking) in couples (FTG: n = 23; HG: n = 22;) with a sedentary or inactive lifestyle on health-related quality of life, relationship quality and other psychological and physiological parameters. RESULTS: The results of this study displayed that healthy and highly functioning women and men with sedentary lifestyles mentally benefit from contact with nature (quality of life, satisfaction with life, mood, internal and external health-related control beliefs). The gender-specific effect on women is most visible in the physiological outcomes (hemopoietic system, aerobic capacity, skeletal muscle mass and hydration) of mountain hiking. Men and women showed small improvements in blood pressure as a result of the interventions. CONCLUSIONS: The ANKER-study provides a method for valid comparison of forest therapy interventions for the first time. Regarding the COVID-19 pandemic, the nature-based intervention presented could offer a multimodal contribution to maintaining a more active lifestyle, further contact with nature that affects peoples physical as well as mental health, and an improvement in social interaction.",

The Wadden Sea in Germany is part of the largest contiguous mudflat area in the world. Although much evidence is already available on different teaching and learning processes at various out-of-school learning sites, this is not yet the case for the Wadden Sea. This research gap was taken up. In this paper, 427 students (mean age: 11.74 years) participated in a mudflat hiking tour. A pre-post-test design followed by a retention test was used to determine the impact of this on participants' environmental attitudes and environmental knowledge. The single factor analyses of variance with repeated measures demonstrated that the mudflat hiking tour had both a positive short-term and a positive long-term impact on environmental attitudes, as well as on environmental knowledge. All three constructs could, therefore, be positively influenced by the intervention. Correlation analyses revealed a positive relationship between environmental attitudes and environmental knowledge at three measurement time points. These results empirically confirm the potential of the Wadden Sea as an out-of-school learning site for environmental education with students from secondary schools. The effectiveness of non-formal education in this ecological environment can be proven.",

Strategies to reduce the abundance of host-seeking ticks in high-use areas within parks are limited. Mowing vegetation is a recommended method to control ticks, but few studies have evaluated the efficacy of this practice. The goal of this study was to determine if a single mowing event could reduce the abundance of host-seeking ticks on recreational trails. Ticks were collected by dragging trails at three recreational parks in northern Minnesota during June and July, 2021. A pre-intervention sample was taken followed by six consecutive weeks of tick sampling. We encountered a total of 3,456 ticks (2,459 Ixodes scapularis Say and 997 Dermacentor variabilis L.) during the 7-week study period. There were no significant differences in the abundance of I. scapularis (adults) or D. variabilis (adults only) between control and mown trail sections. Mowing was a significant predictor of nymphal I. scapularis abundance but trended towards more ticks in mown sections compared to controls. These results suggest that a single mowing intervention during early June is likely to be ineffective as a strategy to reduce the risk of human contacts with ticks on trails.",

Natural environments, such as alpine landscapes, forests, or urban green spaces, are potential high-impact health resources. While there is a growing body of evidence to reveal a positive influence of these natural environments on human health and well-being, further investigations guided by rigorous evidence-based medical research are very much needed. OBJECTIVE: The present study protocol aims at testing research methodologies in the context of a prospective clinical trial on nature-based interventions. This shall improve the standards of medical research in human-nature interactions. METHODS: The ANKER Study investigates the influence of two novel types of nature-based therapy-mountain hiking and forest therapy-on physiological, psychological, and immunological parameters of couples with a sedentary lifestyle. Two intervention groups were formed and spent a seven-day holiday in Algund, Italy. The \"forest therapy group\" participated in daily guided low-power nature connection activities. The \"hiking group\", by contrast, joined in a daily moderate hiking program. Health-related quality of life and relationship quality are defined as primary outcomes. Secondary outcomes include nature connection, balance, cardio-respiratory fitness, fractional exhaled nitric oxide, body composition and skin hydration. Furthermore, a new approach to measure health-related quality of life is validated. The so-called \"intercultural quality of life\" comic assesses the health-related quality of life with a digitally animated comic-based tool.",

Consequently, new approaches must be developed to increase adherence to an active lifestyle and hence a longer life. Green exercise and health coaching could be effective ways to induce long-lasting lifestyle changes geared towards more physical activity. In this randomized controlled trial, we investigated the effects of mountain hiking and psychological coaching on adults with a sedentary lifestyle. The coaching group (n = 26) participated in a 7-day guided hiking program with three personal coaching sessions, whereas the hiking group (n = 32) received no coaching. The effects on aerobic capacity, spirometry and quality of life were assessed at baseline (day 0), after the intervention week (day 7) and after 80 days. Fully nonparametric statistical analysis revealed a gender-based effect for aerobic capacity-the female participants of the coaching group showed a greater improvement (p = 0.03) than the hiking group. No significant effects were found for spirometry. Quality of life parameters improved in both groups. In conclusion, both green exercise and health coaching are capable of inducing improvements in health-related quality of life and cardiorespiratory fitness. No superior effects of health coaching were found.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: To evaluate feasibility and acceptability of a group-based nature recreation intervention (nature hiking) and control condition (urban hiking) for military Veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). DESIGN AND SETTING: A pilot randomised controlled trial conducted in the US Pacific Northwest. PARTICIPANTS: Veterans with PTSD due to any cause. INTERVENTIONS: Twenty-six participants were randomised to a 12-week intervention involving either six nature hikes (n=13) or six urban hikes (n=13). PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Feasibility was assessed based on recruitment, retention and attendance. Questionnaires and postintervention qualitative interviews were conducted to explore intervention acceptability. Questionnaires assessing acceptability and outcomes planned for the future trial (eg, PTSD symptoms) were collected at baseline, 6 weeks, 12 weeks (immediately after the final hike) and 24 weeks follow-up. RESULTS: Of 415 people assessed for eligibility/interest, 97 were interested and passed preliminary eligibility screening, and 26 were randomised. Mean completion of all questionnaires was 91% among those in the nature hiking group and 68% in those in the urban hiking group. Over the course of the intervention, participants in the nature and urban groups attended an average of 56% and 58%, respectively, of scheduled hikes. Acceptability of both urban and nature hikes was high; over 70% reported a positive rating (ie, good/excellent) for the study communication, as well as hike locations, distance and pace. Median PTSD symptom scores (PTSD Checklist-5) improved more at 12 weeks and 24 weeks among those in the nature versus urban hiking group. CONCLUSIONS: This pilot study largely confirmed the feasibility and acceptability of nature hiking as a potential treatment for Veterans with PTSD. Adaptations will be needed to improve recruitment and increase hike attendance for a future randomised controlled trial to effectively test and isolate the ways in which nature contact, physical activity and social support conferred by the group impact outcomes.

      "abstract": "Hiking has become very popular due to the physical and mental health benefits it provides. Skin lesions may occur with hiking and various factors contribute to their development. Although some lesions may appear to have little importance, something as simple as chaffing can cause serious ulcers in people with at-risk feet. Few studies have analyzed preexisting physical characteristics in hiking and addressed the development of lesions in hikers. This observational and longitudinal study examines the development of foot lesions during hiking, taking into account the influence of existing skin disorders, nail disorders, and/or toe deformities and other intrinsic factors of participants. The feet of 109 hikers doing a 29.6-km hike were analyzed, considering the intrinsic factors of participants and the possible influence of these factors in the development of foot lesions during the walk. The results show that some preexisting physical factors of participants such as gender, existing systemic disease, preexisting keratosis, dermatosis, nontraumatic and traumatic onychopathies, and toe deformities significantly predispose to the development of skin lesions. These factors also predispose to muscle lesions except for nontraumatic and traumatic onychopathies and toe deformities. Due to the influence of preexisting physical factors, such as preexisting keratosis, dermatosis, and toe deformities, in the development of foot lesions in hikers, it is worthwhile and advisable to check these factors before a hike to reduce the incidence of foot disorders. Ensuring adequate podiatry treatment a few days before the walk and warmup of muscles properly before starting are recommended.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Population aging is one of the greatest socio-economic challenges of the 21st century, as aging is a well-known risk factor for the development of chronic diseases and functional disabilities. A sedentary life-style promotes the progression of chronic diseases and impaired mobility in older people. Therefore, physical activity is essential for healthy aging. The optimal exercise program for older persons, which covers fall prevention as well as endurance and strength, still remains unclear. METHODS: We performed a longitudinal, randomized, controlled intervention study to investigate the combined effects of moderate mountain hiking and balneotherapy on gait, balance, body composition and quality of life on high-functioning people aged 65-85 years. The intervention group (n = 106) participated in a seven-day holiday with mountain hiking tours. In addition, balneotherapy was applied. The control group (n = 33) spent a typical seven-day cultural holiday with sightseeing. Medical examinations were performed before (day 0) and after the intervention week (day 7), after two months (day 60) and after half a year (day 180). Statistical analysis was done by fully nonparametric analysis of variance-type testing. RESULTS: An improvement of static balance was observed in the intervention group (treatment effect p = 0.02). No significant changes were found in dynamic balance, measured as center of pressure, gait parameters and self-assessed balance confidence. Only for gait speed, a short-term effect was observed (treatment p = 0.03). The gait speed increased in the intervention group. Although quality of life improved significantly in both groups, a sustainable effect until day 60 is only visible in the intervention group (interaction effect for treatment and day-60 p = 0.02). Significant interaction effects of treatment and time were found for total body water (p = 0.04), appendicular muscle mass (p = 0.04) and fat free mass index (p = 0.03), all indicating an increase of these variables in the intervention group. CONCLUSIONS: A seven-day intervention with moderate mountain hiking in combination with balneotherapy is an effective training for highly functioning older persons, inducing short-term improvements in static balance and quality of life.",

Therefore, the aim of the present study was to analyze the acute effects of a three-hour green exercise intervention (mountain hiking) on stress-related physiological responses. Using a randomized crossover design, 42 healthy participants were exposed to three different conditions in a field-based experiment: outdoor mountain hiking, indoor treadmill walking, and sedentary control condition (three hours each). At baseline and at follow-up (five minutes after the condition), stress-related physiological responses (salivary cortisol, blood pressure, and heart rate variability) were measured. Salivary cortisol decreased in all conditions, but showed a larger decrease after both mountain hiking and treadmill walking compared to the sedentary control situation (partial η² = 0.10). No differences were found between mountain hiking and treadmill walking in salivary cortisol. In heart rate variability and blood pressure, changes from baseline to follow-up did not significantly differ between the three conditions. The results indicate that three hours of hiking indoors or outdoors elicits positive effects on salivary cortisol concentration. Environmental effects seem to play a minor role in salivary cortisol, blood pressure, and heart rate variability.",

      "abstract": "Park and protected area managers are tasked with protecting natural environments, a particularly daunting challenge in heavily visited urban-proximate areas where flora and fauna are already stressed by external threats. In this study, an adaptive management approach was taken to reduce extensive off-trail hiking along a popular trail through an ecologically diverse and significant area in the Chesapeake and Ohio National Historical Park near Washington DC. Substantial amounts of off-trail hiking there had created an extensive 16.1 km network of informal (visitor-created) trails on a 39 ha island in the Potomac Gorge. A research design with additive treatments integrating educational and site management actions was applied and evaluated using self-reported behavior from an on-site visitor survey and unobtrusive observations of off-trail hiking behavior at two locations along the trail. Study treatments included: 1) trailhead educational signs developed using attribution theory and injunctive-proscriptive wording, 2) symbolic \"no hiking\" prompter signs attached to logs placed across all informal trails, 3) placement of concealing leaf litter and small branches along initial sections of informal trails, 4) restoration work on selected trails with low fencing, and 5) contact with a trail steward to personally communicate the trailhead sign information. The final, most comprehensive treatment reduced visitor-reported intentional off-trail hiking from 70.3% to 43.0%. Direct observations documented reduction in off-trail hiking from 25.9% to 2.0%. The educational message and site management actions both contributed to the decline in off-trail travel and the two evaluation methods enhanced our ability to describe the efficacy of the different treatments in reducing off-trail travel.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Affective responses during physical activity (PA) are important for engagement in PA programs and for adherence to a physically active lifestyle. Little is known about the affective responses to PA bouts lasting longer than 45 minutes. Therefore, the aims of the present study were to analyse acute effects on affective responses of a three-hour outdoor PA intervention (mountain hiking) compared to a sedentary control situation and to an indoor treadmill condition. METHODS: Using a randomized crossover design, 42 healthy participants were randomly exposed to three different conditions: outdoor mountain hiking, indoor treadmill walking, and sedentary control situation (approximately three hours each). Measures included the Feeling Scale, Felt Arousal Scale and a Mood Survey Scale. Repeated measures ANOVAs were used to analyse differences between the conditions. RESULTS: Compared to the control situation, the participants showed a significant increase in affective valence (d = 1.21, p < .001), activation (d = 0.81, p = .004), elation (d = 1.07, p < .001), and calmness (d = 0.84, p = .004), and a significant decrease in fatigue (d = -1.19, p < .001) and anxiety (d = -.79, p < .001) after mountain hiking. Outdoor mountain hiking showed significantly greater positive effects on affective valence, activation, and fatigue compared to indoor treadmill walking. DISCUSSION: The results indicate that a three-hour PA intervention (mountain hiking) elicits higher positive and lower negative affective responses compared to a sedentary control situation and to an indoor PA condition. Outdoor mountain hiking can be recommended by health professionals as a form of PA with the potential to positively influence affective responses.

      "abstract": "PURPOSE AND HYPOTHESIS: Improvements in pain, function and sports activity are the main goals of patients following total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Participation in sports has become an increasingly important contributor to patients' quality of life (QoL). Hiking is one of the most popular summer activities among elderly people in alpine regions. Consequently, this randomized controlled trial investigates the impact of a 3-month guided hiking programme on patients' functional abilities and QoL following TKA. It was hypothesized that patients who participate in this programme would demonstrate improvements in functional and QoL parameters compared with a control group. METHODS: Forty-eight TKA patients were included and randomized into either the intervention group (IG; n = 25) or the control group (CG; n = 23). The IG participated in a 3-month hiking programme (2-3 times a week), whereas the CG performed activities of daily living. The stair climb test (SCT), QoL questionnaires and isokinetic force measurements were completed at three time points (i.e. pre-test, post-test, retention-test). ANOVAs for repeated measurements were conducted for the SCT results. The Friedman test and the Mann-Whitney U test were performed for the QoL parameters. RESULTS: After the 3-month hiking programme, the IG achieved faster overall walking times on the SCT. The time decreased from 4.3 ± 0.6 s (pre-test) to 3.6 ± 0.4 s (post-test) for the stair ascent (p = 0.060) and from 3.6 ± 0.6 s (pre-test) to 3.2 ± 0.5 s (post-test) for the stair descent (p = 0.036). The IG showed significant improvement on some of the subscales of the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score from pre-test to retention-test (p < 0.01). In the CG, no significant changes were observed (n.s.). CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate moderate improvement in the functional abilities and QoL of TKA patients who participated in a 3-month guided hiking programme compared with the patients in the CG. Hiking did not have any acute detrimental effects on the TKA patients during this study period. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: II.",

Many health care professionals seek ways to help clients meet physical activity guidelines recommended by the Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, the World Health Organization, and the American College of Sports Medicine in order to promote active lifestyles and improve overall wellness. Hiking is a cost-effective intervention that encourages people to be physically active while spending time in nature. Time in nature can lead to health benefits through contact with the natural elements, participation in physical activity, restoration of mental and emotional health, and time with social contacts. Benefits may be immediate, such as decreased blood pressure, decreased stress levels, enhanced immune system functioning, and restored attention, or transpire over time, such as weight loss, decreased depression, and overall wellness. Health care providers are ideally positioned to recommend and prescribe hiking to clients. Federal, state, and local natural resource agencies are beginning to partner with health care professionals to promote outdoor nature-related activities. Examples of successful doctor and other health care practitioner partnership programs are described, along with tips for getting started."

The effect of trail degradation type (muddiness and erosion) and severity (moderate or severe) of trail degradation were also examined within each of the 4 treatment groups. Analyses revealed neither the educational message nor the method of displaying the image had a consistent and expected impact on individuals' behavioral intentions. In fact, participants who viewed the educational message were more likely to indicate they would hike off the trail. The effects of both trail degradation type and severity were consistent and significant with muddiness and more severe levels of degradation having a greater influence on individuals' intent to hike on the edge of or off the trail. The analyses also revealed both gender and hiking frequency had significant effects on behavioral intentions. Female participants were more likely to indicate they would turn around than males when they encountered degraded trail sections. Women were also less likely to indicate they would hike off the trail than men. Collectively, these findings highlight a variety of ways recreation resource managers can more efficiently inform recreationists about the impacts of off-trail hiking and prioritize trail management needs.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Physical activity is a cornerstone in therapy for patients with metabolic syndrome. Walking and hiking in a mountain scenery represents an ideal approach to make them move. The Austrian Moderate Altitude Study (AMAS) 2000 main study is a randomized controlled trial to investigate the cardiovascular effects of hiking at moderate altitude on patients with metabolic syndrome compared with a control group at low altitude, to assess a potential altitude-specific effect. METHODS: Seventy-one male patients with metabolic syndrome were randomly assigned to a moderate altitude group (at 1700 m), with 36 participants, or to a low altitude group (at 200 m), with 35 participants. The 3-week vacation program included 12 hiking tours (4 per week, average duration 2.5 hours, intensity 55% to 65% of heart rate maximum). Physical parameters, performance capacity, 24-hour blood pressure, and heart rate profiles were obtained before, during, and after the stay. RESULTS: In both groups, we found a significant mean weight loss of -3.13 kg; changes in performance capacity were minor. Systolic, diastolic, and mean arterial pressures and circadian heart rate profiles were significantly reduced in both groups, with no differences between them. Consequently, the pressure-rate product was reduced as well. All study participants tolerated the vacation well without any adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: A 3-week hiking vacation at moderate or low altitude is safe for patients with metabolic syndrome and provides several improvements in their cardiovascular parameters. The cardiovascular benefits achieved are more likely to be the result of regular physical activity than the altitude-specific effect of a mountain environment.",

Psychiatric patients are prone to a sedentary lifestyle, and accumulating evidence has identified physical activity as a supplemental treatment option. METHODS: This prospective, randomized, crossover study evaluated the effects of hiking in high-risk suicidal patients (n = 20) who performed 9 weeks of hiking (2-3 hikes/week, 2-2.5 hours each) and a 9-week control period. RESULTS: All patients participated in the required 2 hikes per week and thus showed a compliance of 100%. Regular hiking led to significant improvement in maximal exercise capacity (hiking period Δ: +18.82 ± 0.99 watt, P < .001; control period: P = .134) and in aerobic capability at 70% of the individual heart rate reserve (hiking period Δ: +8.47 ± 2.22 watt; P = .010; control period: P = .183). Cytokines, associated previously with suicidality (tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-6, S100), remained essentially unchanged. CONCLUSIONS: Hiking is an effective and safe form of exercise training even in high-risk suicidal patients. It leads to a significant improvement in maximal exercise capacity and aerobic capability without concomitant deterioration of markers of suicidality. Offering this popular mode of exercise to these patients might help them to adopt a physically more active lifestyle.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The following crossover pilot study attempts to prove the effects of endurance training through mountain hiking in high-risk suicide patients. METHOD: Participants (n = 20) having attempted suicide at least once and clinically diagnosed with hopelessness were randomly distributed among two groups. Group 1 (n = 10) began with a 9-week hiking phase followed by a 9-week control phase. Group 2 (n = 10) worked vice versa. Assessments included the Beck Hopelessness Scale (BHS), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Beck Scale of Suicide Ideation (BSI), and maximum physical endurance. RESULTS: Ten participants of Group 1 and seven participants of Group 2 completed the study. A comparison between conditions showed that, in the hiking phase, there was a significant decrease in hopelessness (P < 0.0001, d = -1.4) and depression (P < 0.0001, d = -1.38), and a significant increase in physical endurance (P < 0.0001, d = 1.0), but no significant effect for suicide ideation (P = 0.25, d = -0.29). However, within the hiking phase, there was a significant decrease in suicide ideation (P = 0.005, d = -0.79). CONCLUSION: The results suggest that a group experience of regular monitored mountain hiking, organized as an add-on therapy to usual care, is associated with an improvement of hopelessness, depression, and suicide ideation in patients suffering from high-level suicide risk.",

Synonym of health and well-being, this activity carries some risks which more and more patients are questioning; answering these questions is not always obvious, so we wanted to tackle the subject. Risks linked to certain animals will be covered. One of these risks is insect stings, particularly wasps and bees. This is a major problem which affects the whole population and more seriously those who are allergic, accounting for around 5% of the population. Another problem: snake bites. In Switzerland, there are about 20-25 bites each year. Poisoning from these can be divided into two categories: local or systemic. The effects are multiple and diverse, ranging from renal failure to discrasia to hypovolemic shock. Pre-hospitalisation measures are of paramount importance in the treatment.",

To design this treatment plan, the authors considered the peculiarities a hike which lasts over many days has: comfort criteria, security and prevention of complications. The study subjects were pilgrims, travelling companions of the authors. These stand out as main differentiating characteristics of this proposed treatment, the precocious debridement of the skin of the blister, the use of a wet cure which has nitrofurazone in it and the application of a bandage. Following this procedure, the authors of this study tended to 16 lesions, carrying out a total of 112 cures which showed a favorable evolution within six days and no significant differences in the improvement of the lesion.",

The 3-week vacation program included 12 moderate- intensity guided hiking tours [4 times/week, 55-65% heart rate maximum (HRmax)] with a total exercise time of 29 h plus moderate recreational activities. Both study groups had a comparable and balanced nutrition with no specific dietary restrictions. Anthropometric, metabolic and cardiovascular parameters were measured 10-14 days before vacation, several times during the 3-week vacation, 7-10 days and 6-8 weeks after return. All participants tolerated the vacation without any adverse effects. Body weight, body fat, waist-circumference, fasting glucose, total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C), plasma fibrinogen, resting systolic and diastolic blood pressure were significantly decreased over time in both study groups. In the LA group, fasting insulin and homeostasis model assessment (HOMA)-index were significantly decreased one week after return. Relative cycle ergometry performance was significantly increased after return compared to baseline. In both study groups, waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), 2-h oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), HDL-cholesterol (HDL-C), and triglycerides remained unchanged. The 3-week vacation intervention at moderate and LA had a positive influence on all key-markers of the metabolic syndrome. No clinically relevant differences could be detected between the study groups. A hiking vacation at moderate and LA can be recommended for people with stable, controlled metabolic and cardiovascular risk factors.",

To avoid problems such as acute mountain sickness (AMS), high altitude cerebral edema (HACE) or high altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE), the speed of ascent and the daily sleeping elevation are of primary importance. Mild symptoms and peripheral swelling are usually harmless. However, when the severity of altitude sickness progresses, rapid therapy and immediate transport to lower elevations can be life-saving under certain conditions. A sojourn in the mountains requires effective preparation and prophylaxis against oxygen deficiency, increased UV radiation, as well as against the possibility of hypothermia and frostbite.",

      "abstract": "Many recent trail degradation problems have been attributed to mountain biking because of its alleged capacity to do more damage than other activities, particularly hiking. This study compared the effects of experimentally applied mountain biking and hiking on the understory vegetation and soil of a deciduous forest. Five different intensities of biking and hiking (i.e., 0, 25, 75, 200 and 500 passes) were applied to 4-m-long x 1-m-wide lanes in Boyne Valley Provincial Park, Ontario, Canada. Measurements of plant stem density, species richness, and soil exposure were made before treatment, two weeks after treatment, and again one year after treatment. Biking and hiking generally had similar effects on vegetation and soil. Two weeks after treatment, stem density and species richness were reduced by up to 100% of pretreatment values. In addition, the amount of soil exposed increased by up to 54%. One year later, these treatment effects were no longer detectable. These results indicate that at a similar intensity of activity, the short-term impacts of mountain biking and hiking may not differ greatly in the undisturbed area of a deciduous forest habitat. The immediate impacts of both activities can be severe but rapid recovery should be expected when the activities are not allowed to continue. Implications of these results for trail recreation are discussed.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Rubbing moist skin results in higher frictional forces than rubbing very dry skin. As friction increases, the probability of activity-related blisters also increases. Therefore reducing moisture may reduce blister incidence during physical activity. OBJECTIVE: We examined whether an antiperspirant can reduce foot blisters during hiking. METHODS: In a double-blind study, cadets attending the US Military Academy were separated into two groups that used either an antiperspirant (20% aluminum chloride hexahydrate in anhydrous ethyl alcohol) or placebo (anhydrous ethyl alcohol) preparation. Cadets were told to apply preparations to their feet for 5 consecutive nights. On day 6, cadets completed a 21-km hike, and their feet were examined for blisters before and after. RESULTS: Because of dropouts, the final sample size was 667 cadets with 328 in the antiperspirant group and 339 in the placebo group. There was a high rate of noncompliance with the treatment schedule: Cadets used the preparations from 0 to 5 nights before the hike. For cadets using the preparations at least 3 nights before the hike (n=269), the incidence of foot blisters was 21% for the antiperspirant group and 48% for the placebo group (P < 0.01). However, reports of skin irritation were 57% for the antiperspirant group and 6% for the placebo group (P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: A 20% solution of aluminum chloride hexahydrate in anhydrous ethyl alcohol may be effective in reducing foot blisters during hiking; however, the side effect of skin irritation should be considered and preventive measures studied to reduce this irritation.",
