      "abstract": "To compare the outcomes between idebenone oral therapy and rAAV2-ND4 intravitreal injection in the treatment of Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy. A systematic literature review was performed of publications from 1990 to 2023 in PubMed, Ovid MEDLINE, Cochrane CENTRAL, Google Scholar, Embase, CrossRef, OpenAlex, and Web of Science for studies evaluating the outcomes of idebenone or rAAV2-ND4 therapy in Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy. The primary outcome measure was improvement in visual acuity. Secondary outcome measures were improvement of retinal nerve fiber layer thickness, ganglion cell layer volume, and visual field mean deviation. There are no studies directly comparing the two interventions. Our analysis included 645 patients from 17 studies; 338 patients from nine studies received idebenone, and 307 patients from eight studies received rAAV2-ND4. When compared to each other, rAAV2-ND4 provided better visual improvement at 6 months with a mean difference of 0.07 (P = 0.8289), but idebenone provided better visual improvement at 1 year with a mean difference of 0.35 (P < 0.0001). At 2 years, the rAAV2-ND4 group's visual acuity improved from baseline by 0.18 (P = 0.08). There was no data for improvement at 2 years for idebenone, only for rAAV2-ND4. rAAV2-ND4 provides better visual acuity results at 6 months, and idebenone provides better visual acuity results at 1 year. Further studies are recommended to formulate a complete idea about the long-term results (>2 years).",

      "abstract": "Oxidative stress-induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis was the primary causative factor of cardiovascular disease (CVD). However, the existing therapy drugs for oxidative stress were much less investigated, which underlined the necessity for new drug discovery and development. Herein, we aimed to synthesize several novel idebenone (IDE) derivatives and investigate the protective effect and mechanism of these derivatives against H2O2-induced oxidative stress injury in H9C2 cells by determining cell proliferation rate, detecting the reactive oxygen species (ROS) level, and the expression of related proteins. Additionally, the study also investigated the protective effect of IDE-1 pretreatment on Balb/c mice after hypoxia-reoxygenation. In vivo experiments, the damage to cardiomyocytes was assessed using hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining. The results showed that IDE-1 possessed the highest antioxidant damage activity among all IDE derivatives, which could notably decrease the levels of intracellular ROS. Furthermore, the antioxidant mechanism was confirmed to be potentially linked to the expression levels of the oxidation-related pathway heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) and the apoptosis-related pathway Bcl-2/Bax and caspase-3. Our results demonstrated that IDE derivatives could be a new research direction for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases associated with oxidative stress."

      "abstract": "Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON) is the most common mitochondrial disease, and was the first to be linked to mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) variations. Recently, autosomal recessive forms of LHON were described in addition to the classical mtDNA-associated forms. Clinically, LHON manifests with subacute and painless loss of central visual acuity, in most cases starting unilaterally, and involving the second eye a few weeks later. Almost all LHON cases are caused by pathogenic variants in genes that code for proteins relevant for function of Complex I of the respiratory chain. The Complex I dysfunction in LHON leads to decreased ATP synthesis and to increased production of reactive oxygen species which ultimately initiates dysfunction and apoptosis of retinal ganglion cells and their axons, the optic nerve. Idebenone, a synthetic CoQ derivative, is a potent intramitochondrial antioxidant and can shuttle electrons directly to complex III of the respiratory chain, thereby bypassing complex I deficiency. On the basis of several clinical trials, it has been approved as a treatment for LHON in 2015 (in the EU). In addition, direct intravitreal gene replacement therapy is being investigated, with several late-stage clinical trials already completed. In the future, gene editing of mtDNA variants may also become a therapeutic option."

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: To investigate the effectiveness of mitochondrial-targeted antioxidant mitoquinone (MitoQ) and nontargeted antioxidant idebenone (Idb) in alleviating mitochondrial dysfunction in corneal endothelial cells (CEnCs). METHODS: In vitro experiments were conducted using immortalized normal human corneal endothelial cells (HCEnC-21T; SVN1-67F) and Fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy (FECD) cells (SVF5-54F; SVF3-76M). Cells were pretreated with MitoQ or Idb and then exposed to menadione (MN) with simultaneous antioxidant treatment. Mitochondrial parameters were evaluated through adenosine triphosphate viability assays, JC-1 staining for mitochondrial membrane potential, and Tom-20 antibody staining for fragmentation, with analysis performed using ImageJ software. HCEnC-21T cells were additionally exposed to ultraviolet-A (25 J/cm 2 ) to assess drug effects under physiological stress. Mitochondrial fragmentation in FECD specimens was analyzed pre- and post-treatment with the drugs. Statistical analysis was conducted using 1-/2-way analysis of variance with post-hoc Tukey test. RESULTS: MitoQ and Idb enhanced cell viability and mitochondrial membrane potential in both normal and FECD cells under MN-induced stress. Idb reduced MN-induced mitochondrial fragmentation by 32% more than MitoQ in HCEnC-21T cells and by 13% more in SVF5-54F cells. Under ultraviolet-A stress, Idb and MitoQ improved mitochondrial function by 31% and 25%, respectively, with MitoQ increasing mitochondrial function by 42% in FECD specimens. CONCLUSIONS: Differential responses in mitochondrial dysfunction across cell lines highlight disease heterogeneity. MitoQ and Idb protected CEnCs from oxidative stress and improved mitochondrial bioenergetics, suggesting that mitochondrial-targeted antioxidants could be considered for mitochondrial dysfunction in CEnCs.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: This retrospective study aimed to investigate the effects of idebenone on cognitive function and serum levels of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) in individuals with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI). METHODS: Retrospective data were collected from the Neurology outpatient department of Liaocheng People's Hospital from January 2021 to June 2023. Patients with a newly diagnosed aMCI who received treatment were included in the idebenone treatment group. The treatment group took 30 mg of oral idebenone three times a day for 6 months. A control group of 51 MCI patients who did not receive cholinesterase inhibitors or other cognitive-enhancing drugs during the period was selected. Cognitive function assessments and serum Biomarkers were conducted before and after treatment in both groups. RESULTS: MoCA scores were significantly improved after 6 months of idebenone treatment, and the difference was statistically significant. The delayed recall score was significantly improved, and the difference was statistically significant; The level of SOD increased and the level of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein decreased after the treatment, but there was no significant change in the control group. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study demonstrate that idebenone treatment significantly improves cognitive function in individuals with aMCI, particularly in the domain of delayed memory. In addition, idebenone reduces the degree of inflammation and oxidative stress and improves antioxidant levels. These findings suggest that idebenone may be a promising intervention for the management of cognitive impairments associated with aMCI.",

Idebenone (IDE) is a coenzyme Q10 analog and antioxidant that has been utilized in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. METHOD: Our goal was to investigate how IDE might treat diabetic retinopathy. An in vivo DR model was established by injecting a single dose of streptozotocin (STZ). Rats were treated with IDE, and their vascular function was measured by ultrasound. The retina structure was checked by haematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining. The expression of biomarkers of autophagy and apoptosis was measured by western blotting assay. The retina endothelial cell line RF/6A was stimulated with high glucose (HG) and treated with IDE. Cell proliferation and apoptosis were assessed using the Edu assay, TUNEL assay, and flow cytometry, respectively. RESULT: Reduced peak systolic velocity (PSV), mean velocity (MV), end-diastolic velocity (EDV), and increased pulsatility index (PI) and resistance index (RI) were observed in diabetic rats; however, these traits were reversed by IDE therapy. IDE alleviated the STZ-induced disordered retina structure. The IDE administration suppressed DR-induced apoptosis and autophagy both in vivo and in vitro. IDE suppressed the activation of Phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI3K) signaling. Activation of PI3K abolished the IDE-alleviated retina damage and cell death. CONCLUSION: IDE regulated the autophagy of retina cells to alleviate diabetic retinopathy via regulating the PI3K signaling pathway."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To assess the potential of bypassing mitochondrial complex I with idebenone to overcome drug resistance in a Rotenone corneal kindling (RCK) mouse model of mitochondrial refractory epilepsy. MATERIAL AND METHOD: Resistance was developed by administering rotenone 2.5 mg/kg intraperitoneally once and corneal kindling twice daily. The kindling development took 15 days, and pre-treatment resistance validation was carried out with five different antiseizure drugs: pregabalin, levetiracetam, valproate, lamotrigine, and phenytoin. The treatment drug, Idebenone (IDB) was given at doses of 10, 20, and 40 mg/kg intraperitoneally for 10 days. The post-treatment resistance validation was evaluated with same standard drugs in same order along with other parameters assessment, such as NAD(P)H: quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1), ATP, GSH, and TBARS. RESULTS: The pre-treatment resistance validation shows an inability of standard drugs to attenuate seizure scores by rotenone kindling, justifying the development of drug resistance. IDB successfully abolished the resistance developed in RCK model. IDB elevated the levels of ATP and NQO1 and showed antioxidant activity by elevating GSH and attenuating TBARS. CONCLUSION & FUTURE DIRECTION: IDB have successfully elevated the level of ATP, NQO1 in RCK model, hence proving the complex I bypass hypothesis. Thus, IDB can be the drug of choice for mitochondrial epilepsies involving drug refractoriness as adjuvant with anticonvulsant drugs.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease results in neurodegeneration and is characterized by an accumulation of abnormal neuritic lesions and intracellular aggregates of hyperphosphorylated Tau proteins in the cerebrum. That leads to progressive decline in memory, thinking, and learning skills. Oxidative stress has been shown to play a significant role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. Antioxidants are identified as part of therapeutic strategy to prevent or reduce the disease. Idebenone is a synthetic analogue of coenzyme Q10 with potent antioxidant properties, originally developed for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease and other cognitive disorders. After oral administration idebenone undergoes excessive first-pass metabolism and has a very low bioavailability of only about 1%. The use of an alternative route of administration such as the nasal and its incorporation into a novel carrier (nanocomposite microspheres) will eliminate the problems associated with reduced absorption, stability, and rapid biotransformation and will increase the opportunity for idebenone to realize its therapeutic potential in Alzheimer's disease. METHODS: Idebenone-loaded nanocomposite microspheres were obtained by spray drying. The structures were characterized using laser diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, high-performance liquid chromatography, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, and differential scanning calorimetry. The ability of nanocomposite microspheres to bind human serum albumin was investigated by fluorescence spectroscopy. The mucoadhesive properties of the carrier were also determined. RESULTS: Bioadhesive nanocomposite microparticles with spherical shape, smooth surface, size of 7.37 ± 2.4 μm, and with high production yield, good drug entrapment efficiency, and loading values were obtained. Infrared spectra demonstrated no chemical interactions between idebenone and structure-forming polymers. The ability of particles to bind to human serum albumin depends on their drug loading. CONCLUSIONS: Nanocomposite microspheres were developed as the novel delivery system of idebenone for target nose-to-brain delivery. The obtained carrier may increase the therapeutic potential of idebenone by providing higher concentrations in brain tissue and reducing systemic exposure and side effects.",

      "abstract": "GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) are an innovative class of drugs with significant therapeutic value for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The GLP-1RAs currently available on the market are biologic macromolecular peptide agents that are expensive to treat and not easy to take orally. Therefore, the development of small molecule GLP-1RAs is becoming one of the most sought-after research targets for hypoglycemic drugs. In this study, we sought to find a potential oral small molecule GLP-1RA and to evaluate its effect on insulin secretion in rat pancreatic β cells and on blood glucose in mice. We downloaded the mRNA expression profiles of GSE102194 and GSE37936 from the Gene Expression Omnibus database. Subsequently, the small molecule compound idebenone was screened through the connectivity map database. The results of molecular docking, biolayer interferometry, and cellular thermal shift assay indicated that idebenone could bind potently with GLP-1R. Furthermore, ibebenone elevated intracellular cAMP levels. The radioimmunoassay data showed that idebenone enhanced glucose-stimulated insulin secretion via agonism of GLP-1R. Moreover, the results of oral glucose tolerance tests in C57BL/6, Glp-1r-/-, and hGlp-1r mice demonstrated that the glucose-lowering effects of idebenone were mediated by GLP-1R and that there were no species differences in the agonistic effect of idebenone on GLP-1R. In summary, idebenone reduces blood glucose in mice by promoting insulin release through agonism of GLP-1R, suggesting that idebenone is probably a potential GLP-1RA, which is expected to provide a new therapeutic strategy for the prevention and treatment of metabolic diseases such as T2DM.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Leber hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON) is a mitochondrial disorder that typically presents with painless, central visual loss, hyperaemia of the optic nerve head, and peripapillary telangiectasias. Most LHON cases are due to one of three variants, but several less common variants also exist. We describe a clinical case of LHON associated with the variant m.3866T>C, which is possibly linked to LHON. CASE PRESENTATION: A 59-year-old Caucasian woman experienced acute, bilateral, and painless visual loss. She reported cigarette smoking, and elevated phosphatidylethanol suggested harmful alcohol consumption. Her best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was 20/100 for the right eye and 20/50 for the left eye. She could only read the Ishihara demonstration plate, and threshold perimetry demonstrated reduced central sensitivity bilaterally. Her optic nerve heads were hyperaemic, with peripapillary telangiectasias. The visual symptoms and clinical findings suggested LHON. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated a tuberculum sella meningioma and two cerebral aneurysms, which we regarded as incidental findings. Genetic testing did not identify common LHON variants but a rare homoplasmic variant, m.3866T>C, which studies suggest might cause LHON or act in synergy with other variants to increase the disease penetrance. After initiating test-of-treatment with idebenone 900 mg per day, the patient's BCVA improved to 20/32 for both eyes and then stabilized. CONCLUSION: This case strengthens the evidence for m.3866T>C as a causative LHON variant. The case also raises the question as to whether this particular variant can respond favourably to treatment with idebenone."

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: To objectively assess visual function in Leber's Hereditary Optic Neuropathy (LHON) patients; this study evaluated pre- and post-idebenone treatment changes in primary visual cortical (V1) responses using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), given the challenges in subjective testing due to central retinal ganglion cell damage. STUDY DESIGN: A descriptive study involving four confirmed LHON patients. METHODS: Four patients received 900 mg/day of oral idebenone for 24 weeks. Baseline and post-treatment visual acuity, visual fields, and BOLD fMRI responses while passively viewed drifting contrast pattern visual stimuli were compared with self-reported symptoms. RESULTS: Post-idebenone, one patient showed positive trends across subjective tests, reported symptoms, and fMRI. Two patients had stable symptoms and fMRI responses; one improved on subjective tests, and another worsened slightly. Another patient improved in visual field tests despite worsening symptoms and fMRI trends. CONCLUSION: fMRI may offer a valuable objective measure of visual functions in LHON and appears to be more relevant in assessing symptoms. Further research with more participants is needed to ascertain fMRI's role in developing objective visual assessments and treatment evaluation.",

      "abstract": "Doxorubicin (DOX)-mediated cardiotoxicity can exacerbate mortality in oncology patients, but related pharmacotherapeutic measures are relatively limited. Ferroptosis was recently identified as a major mechanism of DOX-induced cardiotoxicity. Idebenone, a novel ferroptosis inhibitor, is a well-described clinical drug widely used. However, its role and pathological mechanism in DOX-induced cardiotoxicity are still unclear. In this study, we demonstrated the effects of idebenone on DOX-induced cardiotoxicity and elucidated its underlying mechanism. A single intraperitoneal injection of DOX (15 mg/kg) was administrated to establish DOX-induced cardiotoxicity. The results showed that idebenone significantly attenuated DOX-induced cardiac dysfunction due to its ability to regulate acute DOX-induced Fe2+ and ROS overload, which resulted in ferroptosis. CESTA and BLI further revealed that idebenone's anti-ferroptosis effect was mediated by FSP1. Interestingly, idebenone increased FSP1 protein levels but did not affect Fsp1 mRNA levels in the presence of DOX. Idebenone could form stable hydrogen bonds with FSP1 protein at K355, which may influence its association with ubiquitin. The results confirmed that idebenone stabilized FSP1 protein levels by inhibiting its ubiquitination degradation. In conclusion, this study demonstrates idebenone attenuated DOX-induced cardiotoxicity by inhibiting ferroptosis via regulation of FSP1, making it a potential clinical drug for patients receiving DOX treatment."

      "abstract": "Chronic and excessive alcohol consumption leads to liver toxicity. There is a need to investigate effective therapeutic strategies to alleviate alcohol-induced liver injury, which remains the leading cause of liver-related morbidity and mortality worldwide. Therefore here, we looked into and evaluated how ethanol-induced hepatotoxicity was affected by coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) and its analog, idebenone (IDE), on the NLRP3/caspase-1/IL-1 pathway. Hepatotoxicity induced in rats through the oral administration of gradually increasing dosages of ethanol (from 2 to 6 g/kg/day) over 30 days and the effect of CoQ10 (10 or 20 mg/kg) and IDE (50 or 100 mg/kg) were evaluated. Serum hepatotoxicity markers (ALT, AST, GGT, ALP, and TBIL), tissue oxidative stress markers and the mRNA expressions of IL-1β, IL-18, TGF-β, NF-κB, NLRP3, and caspase-1 were evaluated. Masson's trichrome staining was also used to visualize fibrosis in the liver tissue. The results indicated that ethanol exposure led to hepatotoxicity as well as considerable NLRP3/caspase-1/IL-1β pathway activation. Moreover, CoQ10 or IDE treatment reduced measured parameters in a dosage-dependent manner. Thus, by inhibiting the NLRP3/caspase-1/IL-1 pathway, CoQ10 and IDE can prevent the hepatotoxicity caused by ethanol, although CoQ10 is more effective than IDE. This study will provide insight into new therapeutic avenues that take advantage of the anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties of CoQ10 and IDE in ethanol-induced liver diseases.",

      "abstract": "Statins are the first line of choice for the treatment for atherosclerosis, but their use can cause myotoxicity, a common side effect that may require dosage reduction or discontinuation. The exact mechanism of statin-induced myotoxicity is unknown. Previous research has demonstrated that the combination of idebenone and statin yielded superior anti-atherosclerotic outcomes. Here, we investigated the mechanism of statin-induced myotoxicity in atherosclerotic ApoE-/- mice and whether idebenone could counteract it. After administering simvastatin to ApoE-/- mice, we observed a reduction in plaque formation as well as a decrease in their exercise capacity. We observed elevated levels of lactic acid and creatine kinase, along with a reduction in the cross-sectional area of muscle fibers, an increased presence of ragged red fibers, heightened mitochondrial crista lysis, impaired mitochondrial complex activity, and decreased levels of CoQ9 and CoQ10. Two-photon fluorescence imaging revealed elevated H2O2 levels in the quadriceps, indicating increased oxidative stress. Proteomic analysis indicated that simvastatin inhibited the tricarboxylic acid cycle. Idebenone treatment not only further reduced plaque formation but also ameliorated the impaired exercise capacity caused by simvastatin. Our study represents the inaugural comprehensive investigation into the mechanisms underlying statin-induced myotoxicity. We have demonstrated that statins inhibit CoQ synthesis, impair mitochondrial complex functionality, and elevate oxidative stress, ultimately resulting in myotoxic effects. Furthermore, our research marks the pioneering identification of idebenone's capability to mitigate statin-induced myotoxicity by attenuating oxidative stress, thereby safeguarding mitochondrial complex functionality. The synergistic use of idebenone and statin not only enhances the effectiveness against atherosclerosis but also mitigates statin-induced myotoxicity.",

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: Considering the difficulties and challenges in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) treatment, such as the adverse effects of glucocorticoids, which are the main medical prescription used by dystrophic patients, new treatment concepts for dystrophic therapy are very necessary. Thus, in this study, we explore the effects of photobiomodulation (PBM; a non-invasive therapy) and Idebenone (IDE) treatment (a potent antioxidant), applied alone or in association, in dystrophic muscle cells and the quadriceps muscle, with special focus on autophagy and regenerative pathways. METHODS: For the in vitro studies, the dystrophic primary muscle cells received 0.5J LEDT and 0.06μM IDE; and for the in vivo studies, the dystrophic quadriceps muscle received 3J LEDT and the mdx mice were treated with 200mg/kg IDE. RESULTS: LEDT and IDE treatment modulate autophagy by increasing autophagy markers (SQSTM1/p62, Beclin and Parkin) and signaling pathways (AMPK and TGF-β). Concomitantly, the treatments prevented muscle degeneration by reducing the number of IgG-positive fibers and the fibers with a central nucleus; decreasing the fibrotic area; up-regulating the myogenin and MCH-slow levels; and down-regulating the MyoD and MHC-fast levels. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that LEDT and IDE treatments enhance autophagy and prevented muscle degeneration in the dystrophic muscle of the experimental model. These findings illustrate the potential efficacy of LEDT and IDE treatment as an alternative therapy focused on muscle recovery in the dystrophic patient.",

The clinical data of 126 patients with vascular dementia who were admitted to our hospital between March 2021 and February 2023 were retrospectively reviewed. Among them, 62 patients received butylphthalide alone (single group) and 64 patients received butylphthalide combined with idebenone (combined group). Cognitive function scores, serum inflammatory factor levels, oxidative stress index levels, and incidence of adverse reactions were compared between the 2 groups before and after treatment. After treatment, the Hasegawa Dementia Scale, Mini Mental State Examination Scale, and activities of daily living scores in both groups were higher than before treatment, and the scores in the combined group were higher than before treatment (P < .05). After treatment, the levels of serum C-reactive protein, tumor necrosis factor-α, and interleukin 6 in both groups were lower than those before treatment, and those in the combined group were lower than those in the simple group (P < .05). After treatment, the levels of serum glutathione peroxidase and superoxide dismutase in the 2 groups were higher than those before treatment, and the level of malondialdehyde was lower than that before treatment. The levels of serum glutathione peroxidase and superoxide dismutase in the combined group were higher than those in the simple group, and the level of malondialdehyde was lower than that in the simple group (P < .05). There was no significant difference in the incidence of adverse reactions between the combined group (6.25%) and the simple group (3.23%) (P > .05). Compared with butylphthalide alone, intervention of butylphthalide combined with idebenone on vascular dementia can effectively reduce the degree of inflammatory and oxidative stress reactions, improve cognitive function, and promote the ability to perform activities of daily living in a safe manner.",

However, hyperinflammation or long-term inflammatory responses can cause various inflammatory diseases. Although idebenone was initially developed for the treatment of cognitive impairment and dementia, it is currently used to treat various diseases. However, its anti-inflammatory effects and regulatory functions in inflammatory diseases are yet to be elucidated. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the anti-inflammatory effects of idebenone in cecal ligation puncture-induced sepsis and lipopolysaccharide-induced systemic inflammation. Murine models of cecal ligation puncture-induced sepsis and lipopolysaccharide-induced systemic inflammation were generated, followed by treatment with various concentrations of idebenone. Additionally, lipopolysaccharide-stimulated macrophages were treated with idebenone to elucidate its anti-inflammatory effects at the cellular level. Idebenone treatment significantly improved survival rate, protected against tissue damage, and decreased the expression of inflammatory enzymes and cytokines in mice models of sepsis and systemic inflammation. Additionally, idebenone treatment suppressed inflammatory responses in macrophages, inhibited the NF-κB signaling pathway, reduced reactive oxygen species and lipid peroxidation, and normalized the activities of antioxidant enzyme. Idebenone possesses potential therapeutic application as a novel anti-inflammatory agent in systemic inflammatory diseases and sepsis."

This study aims to evaluate the potential of Idebenone as a therapeutic agent for TNBC. TNBC cell lines and Xenograft mouse models were used to assess the effect of Idebenone on TNBC both in vitro and in vivo. To investigate the underlying mechanism of Idebenone's effect on TNBC, cell viability assay, transwell invasion assay, cell cycle analysis, apoptosis assay, mitochondrial membrane potential assay, immunofluorescence staining, and transcriptome sequencing were utilized. The results showed that Idebenone impeded the proliferation, colony formation, migration, and invasion of TNBC cells, suppressed apoptosis, and halted the cell cycle in the G2/M phase. The inhibitory effect of Idebenone on TNBC was associated with the GADD45/CyclinB/CDK1 signaling pathway. By disrupting the mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and promoting mitophagy, Idebenone promoted cell autophagy through the AMPK/mTOR pathway, thus further suppressing the proliferation of TNBC cells. Furthermore, we found that Idebenone inhibited the development of TNBC in vivo. In conclusion, Idebenone may be a promising therapeutic option for TNBC as it is capable of inducing autophagy and apoptosis.",

Idebenone is reduced by the cytosolic NAD(P)H oxidoreductase I (NQO1) and directly shuttles electrons to respiratory complex III, bypassing complex I affected in LHON. We show here that two polymorphic variants drastically reduce NQO1 protein levels when homozygous or compound heterozygous. This hampers idebenone reduction. In its oxidized form, idebenone inhibits complex I, decreasing respiratory function in cells. By retrospectively analyzing a large cohort of idebenone-treated LHON patients, classified by their response to therapy, we show that patients with homozygous or compound heterozygous NQO1 variants have the poorest therapy response, particularly if carrying the m.3460G>A/MT-ND1 LHON mutation. These results suggest consideration of patient NQO1 genotype and mitochondrial DNA mutation in the context of idebenone therapy.",

The pathological processes and crucial mutant conditions preceding photoreceptor cell demise are not well understood. This study aims to conduct an in-depth examination of early-stage changes in the widely utilized Pde6brd1/rd1 (rd1) mouse model, which has Pde6b gene mutations representing autosomal recessive RP disorder. We investigated the morphology and ultrastructure of retinal cells, including second-order neurons, during the initial phase of disease progression. Our findings revealed that mitochondrial alterations in rod photoreceptors were present as a predeath mutant state as early as postnatal day 3 (P3). The bipolar and horizontal cells from the rd1 mouse retina exhibited significant morphological changes in response to loss of photoreceptor cells, indicating that second-order neurons rely on these cells for their structures. Subsequent oral administration of idebenone, a mitochondria-protective agent, enhanced retinal function and promoted both photoreceptor cell survival and inner retinal second-order synaptogenesis in rd1 mice at P14. Our findings offer a mechanistic framework, suggesting that mitochondrial damage acts as an early driver for photoreceptor cell death in retinal degeneration.",

Sixteen patients with genetically confirmed OPA1-DOA were treated with 900 mg idebenone daily for 12 months. The primary endpoint was the best recovery/least deterioration of visual acuity. Secondary endpoints were the changes of visual acuity, colour vision, contrast sensitivity, visual field, peripapillary retinal nerve fibre layer thickness (pRNFLT), and visual-related quality of life. For the primary endpoint, a significant increase was observed for the right eye (p = .0027), for the left eye (p = .0111) and for the better-seeing eye (p = .0152). For visual fields, a significant improvement was observed for the left eye between baseline and 9 months (p = .0038). Regarding pRNFLT, a significant decrease was found for the left eye between baseline and 3 months (p = .0413) and between baseline and 6 months (p = .0448). In the visual function questionnaire, a significant improvement was observed in the subscale general vision (p = .0156) and in the composite score (p = .0256). In conclusion, best recovery of visual acuity improved, even though the amount of improvement was small. Furthermore, a maintenance of visual function after 12 months of idebenone intake could be observed as well as a significant improvement in vision-related quality of life.Whether this effect is due to idebenone treatment, the placebo effect, or is explainable by the natural progression of DOA, remains unclear.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON) is a rare disease. Large studies are difficult to conduct; therefore, case reports provide valuable data. Since 2015, patients have been treated with Idebenone. The aim of this paper is to share our experience with diagnosing and managing patients in different stages of LHON. METHODS: We designed a case series study, including four patients undergoing genetic testing and ophthalmologic examination. Criteria for Idebenone administration and follow-up were presented. RESULTS: All patients had mutation 11778G>A in MT-ND4. The first patient, an 82-year-old man, with long history of vision loss, had no indication for Idebenone. Two additional cases emerged within the same family: a 40-year-old brother and a 31-year-old sister. Both received Idebenone, with good outcomes only for the female. After a one-year regimen, they were lost to follow-up. The fourth patient, a 46-year-old man, was diagnosed in the subacute stage. Idebenone administration was deferred, allowing progression of visual field defects. After 17 months of treatment, visual improvement appeared. The treatment was continued for 36 months, with short interruptions, resulting in good outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrated positive results with long-term Idebenone use. Contrary to medical literature, our female patient had a favorable evolution, despite the delayed diagnosis."

Method  The elderly patients with VD after cerebral infarction admitted in our hospital, and the elderly persons for physical examination from November 2020 to December 2021 were included in this study. The serum levels of BDNF, Hcy, NO, and IFN-γ were compared between the study group and the control group. Results  In the study group, the serum levels of Hcy and IFN-γ were significantly higher than that in the control group, whereas significantly lower serum levels of BDNF and NO were found in the study group compared with the control group. After receiving the intervention of donepezil and/or idebenone, the serum levels of Hcy and IFN-γ in group B were significantly lower than that in group A, while the serum levels of BDNF and NO in group B were significantly higher than that in Group A. Conclusion  The results of our study showed abnormally expressed serum levels of Hcy, IFN-γ, BDNF, and NO in elderly patients with VD after cerebral infarction which might strongly reflect the severity of VD. Moreover, after intervention of donepezil alone or combined with idebenone, the changes of serum levels of Hcy, IFN-γ, BDNF, and NO may reflect the curative effect of the disease."

The diagnosis of LHON is mostly defined by the identification of three pathogenic variants in the mitochondrial DNA. Idebenone is widely used to treat LHON patients, but only some of them are responders to treatment. In our study, we assessed the maximal respiration rate (MRR) and other respiratory parameters in eight fibroblast lines from subjects carrying LHON pathogenic variants. We measured also the effects of idebenone treatment on cell growth and mtDNA amounts. Results showed that LHON fibroblasts had significantly reduced respiratory parameters in untreated conditions, but no significant gain in MRR after idebenone supplementation. No major toxicity toward mitochondrial function and no relevant compensatory effect in terms of mtDNA quantity were found for the treatment at the tested conditions. Our findings confirmed that fibroblasts from subjects harboring LHON pathogenic variants displayed impaired respiration, regardless of the disease penetrance and severity. Testing responsiveness to idebenone treatment in cultured cells did not fully recapitulate in vivo data. The in-depth evaluation of cellular respiration in fibroblasts is a good approach to evaluating novel mtDNA variants associated with LHON but needs further evaluation as a potential biomarker for disease prognosis and treatment responsiveness.",

This study is aimed at investigating the effects of light emitting diode therapy (LEDT) and idebenone antioxidant treatment, applied alone or together in dystrophic primary muscle cells from mdx mice, the experimental model of DMD. Mdx primary muscle cells were submitted to LEDT and idebenone treatment and evaluated for cytotoxic effects and calcium and mitochondrial signaling pathways. LEDT and idebenone treatment showed no cytotoxic effects on the dystrophic muscle cells. Regarding the calcium pathways, after LEDT and idebenone treatment, a significant reduction in intracellular calcium content, calpain-1, calsequestrin, and sarcolipin levels, was observed. In addition, a significant reduction in oxidative stress level markers, such as H2O2, and 4-HNE levels, was observed. Regarding mitochondrial signaling pathways, a significant increase in oxidative capacity (by OCR and OXPHOS levels) was observed. In addition, the PGC-1α, SIRT-1, and PPARδ levels were significantly higher in the LEDT plus idebenone treated-dystrophic muscle cells. Together, the findings suggest that LEDT and idebenone treatment, alone or in conjunction, can modulate the calcium and mitochondrial signaling pathways, such as SLN, SERCA 1, and PGC-1α, contributing towards the improvement of the dystrophic phenotype in mdx muscle cells. In addition, data from the LEDT plus idebenone treatment showed slightly better results than those of each separate treatment in terms of SLN, OXPHOS, and SIRT-1.",

      "abstract": "Atherosclerosis is a progressive inflammatory disease activated by excessive oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL). Statins are the first-line choice to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease. However, statin-associated side effects prompt dose reduction or discontinuation. Idebenone could protect against atherosclerosis by scavenging reactive oxygen species (ROS). Although both idebenone and statins have certain efficacy, neither of them can achieve a completely satisfactory effect. Here, we aim to investigate the anti-atherosclerotic effect of the combination of idebenone and statins. Apolipoprotein E knockout (ApoE-/-) mice were given idebenone (400 mg/kg/d), rosuvastatin (10 mg/kg/d) or a combination of idebenone and rosuvastatin. Histological and immunohistochemical staining were used to analyze the size and composition of the plaque. In vivo and in vitro experiments were conducted to explore the possible mechanism. Idebenone and rosuvastatin both reduced plaque burden and increased the stability of atherosclerotic plaques in the ApoE-/- mice. Mice receiving the combination therapy had even reduced and more stable atherosclerotic plaques than mice treated with idebenone or rosuvastatin alone. NLRP3 and IL-1β were further downregulated in mice receiving combination therapy compared with mice treated with monotherapy. The combination treatment also markedly reduced oxidative stress and cell apoptosis in vivo and in vitro. In conclusion, our data demonstrate that the combination of idebenone and rosuvastatin works synergistically to inhibit atherosclerosis, and that the use of both substances together is more effective than using either substance alone. From a therapeutic point, combining idebenone and rosuvastatin appears to be a promising strategy to further prevent atherosclerosis."

METHODS: For this retrospective cross-sectional analysis, the peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (pRNFL) thickness and the macular retinal layer volumes were measured by optical coherence tomography. Patients aged 12 years or younger at disease onset were assigned to the childhood-onset (ChO) group and those aged 13-16 years to the early teenage-onset (eTO) group. All patients received treatment with idebenone. The same measurements were repeated in age-matched control groups with healthy subjects. RESULTS: The ChO group included 11 patients (21 eyes) and the eTO group 14 patients (27 eyes). Mean age at onset was 8.6 ± 2.7 years in the ChO group and 14.8 ± 1.0 years in the eTO group. Mean best-corrected visual acuity was 0.65 ± 0.52 logMAR in the ChO group and 1.60 ± 0. 51 logMAR in the eTO group (p < 0.001). Reduced pRNFL was evident in the eTO group compared to the ChO group (46.0 ± 12.7 μm vs. 56.0 ± 14.5 μm, p = 0.015). Additionally, a significantly lower combined ganglion cell and inner plexiform layer volume was found in the eTO compared to the ChO group (0.266 ± 0.0027 mm3 vs. 0.294 ± 0.033 mm3 , p = 0.003). No difference in these parameters was evident between the age-matched control groups. CONCLUSION: Less neuroaxonal tissue degeneration was observed in ChO LHON than in eTO LHON, a finding that may explain the better functional outcome of ChO LHON.",

METHODS: Randomized controlled trial was adopted on 80 patients with depression after ischemic stroke were randomly divided into two groups, with 40 patients in each group at Xingtai Sanli Health Quannan Clinic from March 17, 2019 to December 20, 2021. Both groups were given basic treatment. On this basis, the control group was treated with paroxetine hydrochloride, while the study group was treated with paroxetine hydrochloride combined with idebenone. The clinical efficacy was evaluated using the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD) before and after treatment. Additionally, the difference in HRSD score after treatment and the improvement in inflammatory factors and antioxidant molecules were compared and analyzed between the two groups. RESULTS: After treatment, the HRSD score of the study group was significantly improved compared with that of the control group (p= 0.00). The effective rate was 82.5% in the study group, which was significantly higher than 62.5% in the control group (p= 0.04). After treatment, TNF-a, CRP and IL-6 in the study group were significantly lower than those in the control group (p= 0.00). Serum SOD, TAC and CAT levels in the study group were significantly higher than those in the control group after treatment (SOD and TAC, p= 0.00; CAT, p= 0.01). The incidence of adverse reactions was 37.5% in the study group and 25% in the control group. Although the incidence of adverse reactions in the study group was higher than that in the control group, the difference was not statistically significant (p= 0.23). CONCLUSION: Paroxetine hydrochloride combined with idebenone in the treatment of depression after ischemic stroke can significantly improve HRSD score, enhance clinical efficacy, reduce the levels of inflammatory factors, and increase the levels of antioxidant factors, without a significant increase in adverse reactions. Therefore, it is a safe and effective treatment method."

At the age of 30 years-old, he complained of infertility lasting for 2 years. Semen analyses showed low motility spermatozoa and a high percentage of morphological or ultrastructural abnormalities. Levels of epididymal markers were strongly atypical. Idebenone was prescribed as treatment of his Leber hereditary optic neuropathy in order to improve his visual acuity. After 5 months of this treatment, motility of spermatozoa increased, and their vitality improved. A natural conception occurred. OUTCOME: This case is the first description of an anomaly of spermatozoas and of the epididymis epithelium in a patient with Leber hereditary optic neuropathy. It draws attention to sperm pathologies in patients with mitochondrial disorders. The role of the mtDNA mutations must be suspected since it plays an important role in the development and motility of spermatozoa. In addition, idebenone can by-pass the complex I and transfer electrons to complex III. It has been suspected to have a favorable effect on spermatogenesis. CONCLUSION: This case confirms the possibility of sperm dysfunction in Leber hereditary optic neuropathy and the interest of idebenone as a treatment for infertility due to mtDNA mutations in human."

In this study, we investigated effects of Idebenone, a potent anti-oxidant, on oxidative stress markers, the anti-oxidant defence system, intracellular calcium concentrations and the inflammatory process in primary dystrophic muscle cells from mdx mice. Dystrophic muscle cells were treated with Idebenone (0.05 μM) for 24 h. The untreated mdx muscle cells were used as controls. The MTT assay showed that Idebenone did not have a cytotoxic effect on the dystrophic muscle cells. The Idebenone treatment was able to reduce the levels of oxidative stress markers, such as H2 O2 and 4-HNE, as well as decreasing intracellular calcium influx in the dystrophic muscle cells. Regarding Idebenone effects on the anti-oxidant defence system, an up-regulation of catalase levels, glutathione reductase (GR), glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity was observed in the dystrophic muscle cells. In addition, the Idebenone treatment was also associated with reduction in inflammatory molecules, such as nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB) and tumour necrosis factor (TNF) in mdx muscle cells. These outcomes supported the use of Idebenone as a protective agent against oxidative stress and related signalling mechanisms involved in dystrophinopathies, such as DMD.",

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: To assess the relationship of demographics, clinical characteristics and structural optical coherence tomography (OCT) findings to long-term visual outcomes in patients with Leber hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON) treated with idebenone. DESIGN: Retrospective, interventional, noncomparative clinical cohort study. METHODS: In this study, a total of 17 participants (34 eyes) with LHON treated with idebenone therapy within 1 year after disease onset and 2 years (24 months) of regular follow-ups were retrospectively enrolled. At baseline, structural OCT volume scans of the macula and optic nerve were reviewed to measure metrics reflecting neuronal loss (ie, macular ganglion cell and inner plexiform layer [GC-IPL] and peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer [RNFL] thicknesses). Stepwise multiple regression analyses were computed to assess associations between final best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) at 2 years and change in BCVA from baseline at 2 years as dependent variables with demographics, clinical characteristics, and OCT metrics at baseline (visit before the initiation of treatment). RESULTS: The BCVA was 1.6±0.8 logMAR (Snellen VA of ∼20/800) at baseline (visit before the initiation of treatment) and 1.0±0.7 logMAR (Snellen VA of 20/200) at the 2-year follow-up visit (P < .0001). Mean±SD change in BCVA from baseline at 2 years was -51.9%±35.9%. In multivariable analysis, the strongest associations with final BCVA were with baseline BCVA (P = .012), superior macular GC-IPL thickness (P = .044), superotemporal macular GC-IPL thickness (P = .010), and inferotemporal macular GC-IPL thickness (P = .015). Similarly, the strongest associations with delta BCVA were with superior macular GC-IPL thickness (P = .045), superotemporal macular GC-IPL thickness (P = .047), and inferotemporal macular GC-IPL thickness (P = .030). CONCLUSION: We identified OCT biomarkers associated with long-term (ie, 2-year) visual outcomes in patients with LHON treated with idebenone therapy in the first year after disease onset. Thinning of the GC-IPL in the superior and temporal parafoveal regions was associated with worse long-term visual outcomes in these patients.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: As the strongest prodromal marker of α-synuclein-specific neurodegeneration, idiopathic REM sleep behavior disorder (iRBD) is becoming a focus of interest in disease-modifying therapy. Idebenone has been widely portrayed as a potent antioxidant targeting mitochondrial dysfunction. Previous study has identified the effect of idebenone on Parkinson's disease with promising outcomes by regulating mitophagy. A novel indication of idebenone should be highlighted in iRBD population. METHODS: The EITRS study is a randomized, double-blind, multi-center clinical study assessing the efficacy and safety of idebenone in the treatment of iRBD into synucleinopathies. One hundred forty-two patients (aged 40-75 years old) with clinically diagnosed iRBD are planned to be recruited with 80% statistical power and randomly assigned to idebenone (30 mg each time, three times a day) or matching placebo orally for 5 years. The assessment of rating scales, blood testing and neuroimaging examinations will be conducted at baseline, the 1st, 3rd and 5th year of follow-up. The primary efficacy endpoint is the 5-year conversion rate in patients with iRBD. The secondary endpoint is the safety and tolerability of idebenone in the treatment of iRBD. The study has been launched in July 2020. DISCUSSION: This is the first prospective study designed to identify the efficacy and safety of idebenone on the treatment of iRBD into synucleinopathies. The current results are expected to promote the development of evidence-based recommendations for the management of patients with iRBD. Furthermore, we hope to provide insights on a possible disease-modifying approach with robust evidence. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinicaltrials.gov, identifier: NCT04534023."

A curative treatment is not available at the moment, but a new antioxidant drug, Idebenone, is expected to reduce the progression of the disorder. Two male patients, genetically confirmed with LHON, were clinically, morphologically, and electrophysiologically evaluated, before and three, six, nine and 12 months after starting the treatment. The patient with 3460G>A mutation in mitochondrially-encoded nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, reduced form (NADH):ubiquinone oxidoreductase core subunit (mtND)1 gene showed an improvement in visual acuity, visual field, and visual evoked potentials with no effect on morphological examinations, while the patient with 11778G>A mutation in mtND4 gene showed no functional, nor morphological recovery after one year of treatment.

Considering the antioxidative function of idebenone, its exogenous administration may quench excessive ROS and promote diabetic wound healing. In the current study, idebenone was loaded into polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) /calcium alginate scaffolds at three different concentrations of 1 w/w%, 2 w/w%, and 3 w/w%. Various in vitro experiments were performed to characterize the developed wound dressings. Cell viability assay showed that scaffolds loaded with 1 w/w% idebenone had significantly better protection under oxidative stress and exhibited higher cell viability. Therefore, the dressings containing 1% drug was chosen to treat diabetic wounds in rat model. Wound healing assay showed that the dressings loaded with 1% drug had significantly higher rate of wound size reduction, collagen deposition, and epithelial thickness. Gene expression study showed that wound healing was accompanied by modulation of inflammatory response, protection against oxidative stress, and increasing angiogenesis-related genes. This preliminary research suggests that PVA/calcium alginate/1% idebenone scaffolds can be considered as a potential treatment modality to treat diabetic wounds in the clinic. However, more extensive studies at gene and protein expression levels are required to understand its exact mechanism of healing effects.",

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This experimental study was conducted with 30 male Wistar rats. The rats were divided into five equal groups depending on the treatment protocol:healthy controls (HC), methanol (M), methanol + methylprednisolone (MM), methanol + idebenone (MI), and methanol + methylprednisolone + idebenone (MMI).Distilled water was provided orally to the HC group, while 20% methanol was administered orally at a dose of 3 g/kg with a nasogastric tube to all rats in groups except the HC group. Four hours later, group MM received 1 mg/kg of intraperitoneal methylprednisolone for 10 days using an insulin syringe, and group MI received 20 mg/kg idebenone by nasogastric catheter for 28 days. MMI group was administered oral idebenone and intraperitoneal methylprednisolone at the same dose. Serum samples were obtained on the 28th day for biochemical analysis and afterwards the rats were euthanized for histopathological examination and eyes were enucleated. ON was evaluated for circumference thickness, vascularization and number of astrocytes, also retinal layers were examined for structural changes by histopathological examination. RESULTS: Comparison of the antioxidant and oxidative stress biomarkers between the groups revealed no statistically significant difference (p > 0.05). By histopathological evaluation the most marked results were obtained by MMI group with an improvement of all parameters mentioned. There was no statistically significant difference between MM group and M group for RD score (p = 0.123). In addition, ON vacuolization in MI group (p < 0.001) and ON astrocyte increase in both MI and MMI groups were statistically significantly lower than in M group (p = 0.001, p = 0.001, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The early use (within hours) of idebenone and short-term methylprednisolone treatment together may protect against the retinal and ON damage developing after methanol ingestion in rats as guided by the histopathological data.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of the energotropic drug idebenon in hereditary neuromuscular pathology. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 9 patients with hereditary myopathies were examined during treatment with idebenone. Determination of muscle strength was carried out on the British medical research Council scale (0 points - no active movements, 5 points - no muscle weakness). The examination was performed before and 1 month after the start of treatment. Treatment regimen: idebenone was prescribed in a daily dose of 90 mg. RESULTS: In the general group of patients with hereditary ataxia, the median strength of the biceps muscle of the shoulder during treatment increased from 3.5 to 4.0 points (p>0.05). The median strength of the ilio-lumbar muscle increased from 3.0 to 4.0 points (p>0.05). Before treatment, the median number of sit-ups was 0, and after 1 month - 2 (p>0.05). CONCLUSION: We used the energotropic drug idebenon, a synthetic analog of the natural substance coenzyme Q10, which is involved in electron transfer in the mitochondrial respiratory chain complex III, for the treatment of patients with hereditary myopathies. In the general group of patients, there was an increase in muscle strength, although it did not reach statistical significance. Before the advent of energotropic drugs, the use of various methods of treating hereditary myopathies did not lead to an increase in muscle strength in patients. Therefore, the identified positive dynamics is of great importance in providing medical care to these patients and improving their quality of life.",

METHODS: The multicentre, open-label, retrospective evaluation of the long-term outcome of idebenone treatment of Dutch LHON patients on visual function and on thickness of the retinal ganglion cell layer. Patients included in the analysis had a confirmed mutation in their mitochondrial DNA encoding either of the seven subunits of complex I, had a reported loss of vision in at least one eye and had a follow-up of more than 6 months after their treatment was started. Control visits involved routine clinical examinations of visual function and retinal structure at (1) the start of treatment, (2) nadir (time of lowest visual acuity), (3) the time of recovery (if any), (4) the time of termination of treatment and (5) more than 6 months after termination of the treatment. RESULTS: Data from 72 patients were analysed. Treatment duration was 23.8 ± 14.4 (mean ± SD) months. A positive response, that is either a clinically relevant recovery (CRR) or a clinically relevant stabilization (CRS), occurred in 53% and 11% of the patients, respectively. The magnitude of CRR was 0.41 ± 1.54 logMAR. CRR of visual acuity is associated with recovery of colour discrimination. The thickness of both the ganglion cell complex (GCC) and the retinal nerve fibre layer (RNFL) is irreversibly reduced. CONCLUSION: Our results confirm that idebenone may help to restore or maintain visual function. Whether this effect will persist is still unknown. Thinning of retinal neural tissue appears to be permanent.",

As such, idebenone is investigated in numerous clinical trials for diseases of mitochondrial aetiology and it is authorized as a drug for the treatment of Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy. Mitochondria of retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) are particularly vulnerable to oxidative damage associated with cellular senescence. Therefore, the aim of this study was to explore idebenone's cytoprotective effect and its underlying mechanism. We used a human-RPE cell line (ARPE-19) exposed to idebenone pre-treatment for 24 h followed by conditions inducing H2O2 oxidative damage for a further 24 h. We found that idebenone: (a) ameliorated H2O2-lowered cell viability in the RPE culture; (b) activated Nrf2 signaling pathway by promoting Nrf2 nuclear translocation; (c) increased Bcl-2 protein levels, leaving unmodified those of Bax, thereby reducing the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio; (d) maintained the mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) at physiological levels, preserving the functionality of mitochondrial respiratory complexes and counteracting the excessive production of ROS; and (e) reduced mitochondrial cytochrome C-mediated caspase-3 activity. Taken together, our findings show that idebenone protects RPE from oxidative damage by modulating the intrinsic mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis, suggesting its possible role in retinal epitheliopathies associated with mitochondrial dysfunction."

      "abstract": "The reproductive function of animals is often affected by climatic conditions. High-temperature conditions can cause damage to oocyte maturation and embryonic development in a variety of ways. The purpose of this study was to prove that supplementation idebenone (IDB) to the maturation medium can improve the maturation and development of porcine oocytes after heat stress (HS). Porcine cumulus-oocyte complexes (COCs) were cultured in the maturation medium with different concentrations of IDB (0, 0.1, 1 and 10 μM) for 44 hr at either 38.5°C or under the HS conditions. The cumulus oophorus expansion, nuclear maturation and blastocyst rate after parthenogenetic activation (PA) were measured. We found that HS (in vitro maturation 20-24 hr, 42°C) exposure significantly reduced cumulus expansion index and maturation rate of oocytes and the blastocyst rate of PA embryos, while IDB supplementation significantly improved oocyte maturation and development to the blastocysts stage after PA. Moreover, the addition of IDB decreased the intracellular level of ROS and increased GSH content, hence enhancing the antioxidant capacity of oocytes under HS. Meanwhile, IDB treatment also obviously improved the mitochondrial membrane potential and ATP synthesis of oocytes under HS conditions. Furthermore, IDB treatment increased the expression of GDF9 and BMP15 in IVM oocytes which attribute to improve the quality and outcome of IVM oocytes and the development competence of PA embryos in pigs. In summary, we demonstrated that IDB supplementation into the maturation medium exerted protective effects and improved the ability of maturation and developmental competence of porcine oocytes exposed to HS.",

The effects of idebenone on the pathology of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and the underlying molecular mechanisms have not been comprehensively investigated. Here, we examined the impact of idebenone treatment on AD pathology in 5xFAD mice, a model of AD. Idebenone significantly downregulated Aβ plaque number via multi-directional pathways in this model. Specifically, idebenone reduced the RAGE/caspase-3 signaling pathway and increased levels of the Aβ degradation enzyme NEP and α-secretase ADAM17 in 5xFAD mice. Importantly, idebenone significantly suppressed tau kinase p-GSK3βY216 levels, thereby inhibiting tau hyperphosphorylation at Thr231 and total tau levels in 5xFAD mice. Taken together, the present study indicates that idebenone modulates amyloidopathy and tauopathy in 5xFAD mice, suggesting therapeutic potential for AD."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease worldwide, which currently lacks disease-modifying therapy to slow down its progression. Idebenone, a coenzyme Q10 (CQ10) analogue, is a well-known antioxidant and has been used to treat neurological disorders. However, the mechanism of Idebenone on PD has not been fully elucidated. This study aims to predict the potential targets of Idebenone and explore its therapeutic mechanism against PD. METHOD: We obtained potential therapeutic targets through database prediction, followed by Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway enrichment analysis. Next, we constructed and analyzed a protein-protein interaction network (PPI) and a drug-target-pathway-disease network. A molecular docking test was conducted to identify the interactions between Idebenone and potential targets. Lastly, a PD cell line of SH-SY5Y overexpressing mutant α-synuclein was used to validate the molecular mechanism. RESULT: A total of 87 targets were identified based on network pharmacology. The enrichment analysis highlighted manipulation of MAP kinase activity and the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway as potential pharmacological targets for Idebenone against PD. Additionally, molecular docking showed that AKT and MAPK could bind tightly with Idebenone. In the cell model of PD, Idebenone activated autophagy and promoted α-synuclein degradation by suppressing the AKT/mTOR pathway. Pretreating cells with chloroquine (CQ) to block autophagic flux could diminish the pharmacological effect of Idebenone to clear α-synuclein. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that Idebenone exerts its anti-PD effects by enhancing autophagy and clearance of α-synuclein, thus providing a theoretical and experimental basis for Idebenone therapy against PD."

Our main goal was to report plasma idebenone values in a cohort of Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA) patients during a long-term follow-up. Taking advantage of this, we also assessed cardiological and neurological status together with idebenone values and genetic background. METHODS: Long-term follow-up retrospective study in 27 FRDA patients with a disease onset at the paediatric age treated with idebenone by compassionate use. Plasma idebenone was measured by HPLC with electrochemical detection. RESULTS: Median plasma idebenone values increased when doses were increased, but apparently linearity was lost in the highest dose group. Marked intraindividual and interindividual differences were observed among patients. We did not find a consistent positive effect after analysis of paired data at the beginning and the end of the study. We only found a correlation between some cardiological measures and the duration of idebenone therapy at high doses, but with uncertain significance. CONCLUSIONS: The large variations observed among the different individuals involved in this study should be considered for optimization of individual dosage regimens.",

The main goal of the current pilot study was based on the evaluation of the feasibility and characteristics of prolonged and controlled idebenone release from a PCL intravitreal implant. The design, development, and characterization of idebenone-loaded PCL implants prepared by an homogenization/extrusion/solvent evaporation method allowed the obtention of high PY, EE and LC values. In vitro characterization was completed by the assessment of mechanical and instrumental properties. The in vitro release of idebenone from the PCL implants was assessed and the implant erosion was monitored by the mass loss and surface morphology changes. DSC was used to estimate stability and interaction among implant's components. The present work demonstrated the controlled and prolonged idebenone delivery from the PCL implants in an in vitro model. A consistent preclinical base was established, supporting the idea of idebenone-loaded PCL implants as a new strategy of long-term sustained intraocular delivery for the LHON treatment.",

We tested idebenone in the fibrotic methionine-choline deficient (MCD) diet and the metabolic fast food diet (FFD) mouse models of NASH. In the fibrotic MCD NASH model, idebenone reduced Shc expression and phosphorylation in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and Shc expression in the liver; decreased serum alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase; and attenuated liver fibrosis as observed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and hydroxyproline quantification. In the metabolic FFD model, idebenone administration improved insulin resistance, and reduced inflammation and fibrosis shown with qPCR, hydroxyproline measurement, and histology. Thus, idebenone ameliorates NASH in two mouse models. As an approved drug with a benign safety profile, Idebenone could be a reasonable human NASH therapy.",

      "abstract": "Advanced paternal age is associated with increased sperm reactive oxygen species (ROS) and decreased fertilization and pregnancy rates. Sperm washing during infertility treatment provides an opportunity to reduce high sperm ROS concentrations associated with advanced paternal age through the addition of idebenone. Sperm from men aged >40 years and older CBAF1 mice (12-18 months), were treated with 5 µM and 50 µM of idebenone and intracellular and superoxide ROS concentrations assessed. Following in vitro fertilization (IVF), embryo development, blastocyst differentiation, DNA damage and cryosurvival, pregnancy and implantation rates and fetal and placental weights were assessed. Five µM of idebenone given to aged human and mouse sperm reduced superoxide concentrations ~20% (p < 0.05), while both 5 and 50 µM reduced sperm intracellular ROS concentrations in mice ~30% (p < 0.05). Following IVF, 5 µM of idebenone to aged sperm increased fertilization rates (65% vs. 60%, p < 0.05), blastocyst total, trophectoderm and inner cell mass cell numbers (73 vs. 66, 53 vs. 47 and 27 vs. 24, respectively, p < 0.01). Treatment with idebenone also increased blastocyst cryosurvival rates (96% vs. 78%, p < 0.01) and implantation rates following embryo transfer (35% vs. 18%, p < 0.01). Placental weights were smaller (107 mg vs. 138 mg, p < 0.05), resulting in a larger fetal to placental weight ratio (8.3 vs. 6.3, p = 0.07) after sperm idebenone treatment. Increased sperm ROS concentrations associated with advanced paternal age are reduced with the addition of idebenone in vitro, and are associated with improved fertilization rates, embryo quality and implantation rates after IVF."

The aim of this work was to evaluate the effect of the mitochondrial antioxidant Idebenone given to F0 mild pregestational diabetic rats on the development of GDM in their F1 offspring and the intergenerational programming of a pro-oxidant/proinflammatory environment that affects the placentas of F2 fetuses. Control and mild pregestational diabetic female rats (F0) were mated with control males, and Idebenone or vehicle was administered to diabetic rats from day 1 of gestation to term. The F1 female offspring were mated with control males and maternal and fetal plasma samples were obtained for metabolic determinations at term. The F2 fetuses and placentas were weighed, and placental protein levels and peroxynitrite-induced damage (immunohistochemistry), mRNA levels (PCR), nitric oxide production (Griess reaction), and number of apoptotic cells (TUNEL) were evaluated. The F1 offspring of F0 diabetic rats (treated or not with Idebenone) developed GDM. The placentas of GDM rats showed a decrease in the mRNA levels of manganese superoxide dismutase and an increase in the production of nitric oxide, peroxynitrite-induced damage, and connective tissue growth factor levels, alterations that were prevented by the maternal Idebenone treatment in F0 rats. In conclusion, the maternal treatment with Idebenone in pregestational diabetic F0 rats ameliorates the pro-oxidant/proinflammatory environment that affects the placentas of F2 fetuses, although it does not prevent F1 rats from developing GDM.",

RESULT: Among all antioxidants, taurine treatment yielded significantly better sperm quality. Malondialdehyde (MDA) level in seminal plasma was significantly lower for taurine compared to the control, idebenone and resveratrol treatments. Moreover, sperm quality declined significantly in all the groups from pre-freeze to post-thaw. CONCLUSION: The findings indicate that taurine at 40 mM significantly improves sperm quality compared to 0.01 mM idebenone and 0.1 mM resveratrol, hence it can be considered as a potent and promising antioxidant supplement in tris extender for the cryopreservation of crossbred ram semen.",

Although much research has been conducted to illuminate sepsis's complex pathophysiology, sepsis treatment protocols are limited, and sepsis remains an important cause of mortality andmorbidity in intensive care units.Various studies have shown that idebenone (IDE) possesses strong antioxidant properties, which inhibit lipid peroxidation and protect cells from oxidative damage. The present study aimed to evaluate the protective effects of IDE against lung injury in a cecal ligation and puncture (CLP)-induced sepsis rat model. METHODS: Male albino Wistar rats were used. The animals were divided into a healthy control (no treatment), CLP, IDE control (200 mg/kg), and CLP + IDE subgroups (50 mg/kg, 100 mg/kg, and 200 mg/kg), with nine rats in each group.IDE was administered 1 h after CLP induction.To evaluate the protective effects of IDE, lung tissues were collected 16 h after sepsis for biochemical, immunohistochemical staining, and histopathological examination. RESULTS: IDE significantly ameliorated sepsis-induced disturbances in oxidative stress-related factors, with its effects increasing in accordance with the dose.IDE also abolished histopathological changes in lung tissues associated with CLP.Furthermore, interleukin 1 beta (IL-1β)and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) immunopositivity markedly decreased in the septic rats following IDE treatment. CONCLUSIONS: IDE largely mitigated the inflammatory response in sepsis-induced lung injury by decreasing free radicals and preventing lipid peroxidation. The results suggest that IDE may represent a potential novel therapeutic drug for sepsis treatment.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Vascular dementia (VD) is a brain disease featured by cognitive impairment and cerebrovascular pathologies. Idebenone can treat neurodegenerative diseases. This study evaluated the mechanism of Idebenone in VD. METHODS: The VD rat model was established by permanent occlusion of bilateral common carotid arteries, followed by intragastrical administration of Idebenone. The learning and spatial memory abilities, and the levels of MDA, SOD, IL-6 and TNF-α were measured. Histological staining was adopted to observe the damage of neurons in the hippocampal cortex and to quantitatively analyze the neuronal damage in CA1 area of hippocampus. Microarray analysis was performed to find out the effect of Idebenone treatment on microRNA (miR) expression in hippocampus of rats. The potential target genes of miR and the pathways regulated by target genes were searched by bioinformatics analysis, and verified by experiments. The mechanism of action behind Idebenone in VD rats was proved by rescue experiment. RESULTS: Idebenone treatment improved the learning and spatial memory abilities of VD rats, inhibited neuroinflammation and oxidative stress, and prevented neuronal apoptosis. Idebenone treatment elevated miR-216a expression in hippocampus of rats, but the therapeutic effect of Idebenone was averted by lentivirus inhibition of miR-216a. miR-216a targeted RSK2. Overexpression of RSK2 annulled the therapeutic effect of Idebenone on VD rats by activating the IκBα/NF-κB axis. CONCLUSION: Idebenone inhibits the activation of RSK2/IκBα/NF-κB axis by increasing miR-216a, thus alleviating oxidative stress and neuroinflammation in VD rats."

Idebenone is currently the only approved treatment. However, its therapeutic potential in different stages of LHON has not been definitely clarified. We aimed to investigate the changes in visual function and correlations with retinal structure in acute and in chronic LHON patients after treatment with idebenone. Twenty-three genetically confirmed LHON patients were followed during treatment using logMAR charts, automated perimetry and optical coherence tomography (OCT). Mean visual acuity improved significantly in acute patients treated within 1 year from onset (-0.52 ± 0.46 logMAR from nadir), in early chronic patients who started after 1-5 years (-0.39 ± 0.27 logMAR from baseline), and in late chronic patients with treatment initiation after >5 years (-0.33 ± 0.28 logMAR from baseline, p < 0.001 all groups). In acute and in chronic patients, strong correlations between OCT and visual function parameters were present only after treatment. This and the sustained visual recovery after treatment may indicate a reactivated signal transduction in dysfunctional RGC that survive the acute phase. Our results support previous evidence that idebenone has therapeutic potential in promoting visual recovery in LHON."

The drug in question is idebenone (©Raxone) and has been given to all newly diagnosed patients of the University Eye Hospital Tuebingen since the approval of the drug. The aim of the study was to find out whether regular administration of the drug led to an improvement in vision. We retrospectively examined 2 cohorts of consecutive patients with newly occurred visual impairment and LHON diagnosis: One with the initial diagnosis made from January 2010 until April 2014 and a second from October 2015 until January 2020. METHODS: Retrospective, observational cohort study. All electronic medical files of newly diagnosed and genetically confirmed LHON patients of the University Eye Hospital Tuebingen from January 2010 until April 2014 (cohort 1) and October 2015 until January 2020 (cohort 2) with at least 12 months of follow-up examinations have been analyzed. RESULTS: Five patients were included in the first and 7 patients in the second cohort. Patients of cohort 1 received no medication; patients of cohort 2, a daily dose of 900 mg idebenone. The primary visual acuity (VA) ranged between 0.03 and 0.5 in cohort 1 and did not improve during the observation period (median 60 months, range 23-87 months). The patients of cohort 2 have been observed for a median of 23 months (range 12-35 m). The primary VA ranged from 0.01 to 0.16. A recovery in one or both eyes with a final VA from 0.8 to 1.0 was experienced in 3 out of 7 patients. All patients showing a recovery of VA carried the m.11778G>A mutation. CONCLUSION: The observed improvement in the treated cohort may be considered as a hint on the efficacy of idebenone in LHON. The time course of improvement suggests that idebenone should be given 1.5 years in newly diagnosed LHON cases.",

Idebenone, a short-chain ubiquinone analog that preserves mitochondrial function is thought to suppress disease progression in early-onset LHON patients. We investigated the effects of idebenone in Japanese LHON patients. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective, interventional, non-comparative study in patients with definite LHON diagnosis, under trial registration number UMIN000017939. METHODS: Fifty-seven patients received 900 mg/day idebenone for 24 weeks. We measured baseline best-corrected visual acuity, visual fields, critical fusion frequency and retinal ganglion cell layer complex thickness; we assessed efficacy at 24 and 48 weeks, and safety throughout. RESULTS: Patients were predominantly male (91.2%) and most had an mt.11778G>A mutation (94.7%). All patients tolerated idebenone therapy well. Data from the 51 mt.11778 patients were compared with their baseline data. At 48 weeks, significant improvement in best-corrected visual acuity was observed in 17 patients (33.3%). Furthermore, 25.5% of patients showed improvements in visual fields and 33.3% in critical fusion frequency. However, retinal ganglion cell layer complex thickness was significantly reduced. Among patients who started idebenone >1 year after disease onset, visual improvement was found in 12 (38.7%). Among patients who developed LHON before 19 years of age, visual improvement was found in 11 (42.3%). CONCLUSION: Idebenone's potential and favorable safety profile were confirmed in Japanese LHON patients. However, this study had no placebo group; therefore, we need to undertake a prospective intervention study to further investigate the therapeutic effects of Idebenone in Japanese LHON patients.",

Emerging evidence suggests that the short chain quinone drug idebenone displays anti-inflammatory activity in addition to its potent antioxidant and mitochondrial electron donor properties. This study evaluated the impact of idebenone in Winnie mice, that are characterized by spontaneous chronic intestinal inflammation and ER stress caused by a missense mutation in the mucin MUC2 gene. Idebenone (200 mg/kg) was orally administered daily to 5-6 weeks old Winnie mice over a period of 21 days. Idebenone treatment substantially improved body weight gain, disease activity index (DAI), colon length and histopathology score. Immunohistochemistry revealed increased expression of MUC2 protein in goblet cells, consistent with increased MUC2 mRNA levels. Furthermore, idebenone significantly reduced the expression of the ER stress markers C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP), activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6) and X-box binding protein-1 (XBP-1) at both mRNA and protein levels. Idebenone also effectively reduced pro-inflammatory cytokine levels in colonic explants. Taken together, these results indicate that idebenone could represent a potential therapeutic approach against human UC by its strong anti-inflammatory activity and its ability to reduce markers of ER stress."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Leber hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON) leads to bilateral central vision loss. In a clinical trial setting, idebenone has been shown to be safe and to provide a trend toward improved visual acuity, but long-term evidence of effectiveness in real-world clinical practice is sparse. METHODS: Open-label, multicenter, retrospective, noncontrolled analysis of long-term visual acuity and safety in 111 LHON patients treated with idebenone (900 mg/day) in an expanded access program. Eligible patients had a confirmed mitochondrial DNA mutation and had experienced the onset of symptoms (most recent eye) within 1 year before enrollment. Data on visual acuity and adverse events were collected as per normal clinical practice. Efficacy was assessed as the proportion of patients with either a clinically relevant recovery (CRR) or a clinically relevant stabilization (CRS) of visual acuity. In the case of CRR, time to and magnitude of recovery over the course of time were also assessed. RESULTS: At time of analysis, 87 patients had provided longitudinal efficacy data. Average treatment duration was 25.6 months. CRR was observed in 46.0% of patients. Analysis of treatment effect by duration showed that the proportion of patients with recovery and the magnitude of recovery increased with treatment duration. Average gain in best-corrected visual acuity for responders was 0.72 logarithm of the minimal angle of resolution (logMAR), equivalent to more than 7 lines on the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) chart. Furthermore, 50% of patients who had a visual acuity below 1.0 logMAR in at least one eye at initiation of treatment successfully maintained their vision below this threshold by last observation. Idebenone was well tolerated, with most adverse events classified as minor. CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate the benefit of idebenone treatment in recovering lost vision and maintaining good residual vision in a real-world setting. Together, these findings indicate that idebenone treatment should be initiated early and be maintained more than 24 months to maximize efficacy. Safety results were consistent with the known safety profile of idebenone.",

      "abstract": "Mitochondrial dysfunction has been repeatedly identified to be hallmark brain pathology underlying neuronal stress in Alzheimer's disease. As a result, mitochondrial medicine for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease has received increasing recognition. Idebenone (IDB) is a synthetic analog of Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) carrying antioxidizing property. Previous clinical trials reported a conflicting disease-modifying effect of IDB on Alzheimer's disease patients. However, whether IDB is preventive against amyloid beta (Aβ)-induced mitochondrial and neuronal stress has not been comprehensively investigated. In this study, we adopted an in-vitro setting by using primary cultured cortical neurons for the test. Neurons were pretreated with IDB prior to Aβ exposure. IDB pretreatment significant prevented neurons from Aβ-induced collapse of mitochondrial bioenergetics and perturbations of the protein kinase A (PKA)/cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) signaling. Importantly, the treatment of IDB alone demonstrated an indiscernible side effect on the measured mitochondrial function, PKA/CREB signaling and neuronal viability. Therefore, our findings in together show a preventive effect of IDB against Aβ-mediated mitochondrial and neuronal injury. The use of IDB may hold potential to reduce the risk of Alzheimer's disease as a preventive strategy.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic, immune-mediated neurodegenerative disorder of the central nervous system (CNS). While current MS therapies target the inflammatory processes, no treatment explicitly targets mitochondrial dysfunction and resulting axonal loss. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine whether idebenone inhibits mitochondrial dysfunction and accumulation of disability in primary progressive MS (PPMS) and to enhance understanding of pathogenic mechanisms of PPMS progression using cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers. METHODS: The double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase I/II clinical trial of Idebenone in patients with Primary Progressive MS (IPPoMS; NCT00950248) was an adaptively designed, baseline-versus-treatment, placebo-controlled, CSF-biomarker-supported trial. Based on interim analysis of the 1-year pre-treatment data, change in the area under the curve of Combinatorial Weight-Adjusted Disability Score (CombiWISE) became the primary outcome, with >80% power to detect ≥40% efficacy with 28 patients/arm treated for 2 years in baseline versus treatment paradigm. Changes in traditional disability scales and in brain ventricular volume were secondary outcomes. Exploratory outcomes included CSF biomarkers of mitochondrial dysfunction (Growth/differentiation factor 15 [GDF15] and lactate), axonal damage (neurofilament light chain [NFL]), innate immunity (sCD14), blood brain barrier leakage (albumin quotient) and retinal nerve fiber layer thinning. RESULTS: Idebenone was well tolerated but did not inhibit disability progression or CNS tissue destruction. Concentrations of GDF15, secreted predominantly by astrocytes and choroid plexus epithelium in vitro, increased after exposure to mitochondrial toxin rotenone, validating the ability of this biomarker to measure intrathecal mitochondrial damage. CSF GDF15 levels correlated strongly with age and MS patients had CSF levels of GDF15 significantly above age-adjusted healthy volunteers, with highest levels measured in PPMS. Idebenone did not change CSF GDF15 levels. CONCLUSION: Mitochondrial dysfunction exceeding normal aging reflected by age-adjusted CSF GDF15 is present in the majority of PPMS patients, but it is not inhibited by idebenone.",

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: Atherosclerosis, a chronic disease of the arteries, results from pathological processes including the accumulation and aggregation of oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL) in the vessel walls, development of neointima, formation of a fibrous cap, and migration of immune cells to damaged vascular endothelium. Recent studies have shown that mitochondrial dysfunction is closely associated with the development and progression of atherosclerosis. Idebenone, a short-chain benzoquinone similar in structure to coenzyme Q10, can effectively clear oxygen free radicals as an electron carrier and antioxidant. In the present study, we aim to investigate weather idebenone protects against atherosclerosis in apolipoprotein E-deficient (apoE-/-) mice. METHODS: apoE-/- mice receiving a high-fat diet (HFD) were treated with idebenone for 16 weeks. A total of 60 mice were randomized into the following four groups: (1) HFD, (2) HFD and low-dose idebenone (100 mg/kg/d), (3) HFD and medium-dose idebenone (200 mg/kg/d), and (4) HFD and high-dose (400 mg/kg/d). Proteomic analysis was performed between the HFD and idebenone-high-dose group. Plaque analysis was carried out by histological and immunohistochemical staining. Western blot, TUNEL staining, and MitoSOX assays were performed in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) to investigate the SIRT3-SOD2-mtROS pathway. RESULTS: Histological and morphological analysis demonstrated that idebenone significantly reduced plaque burden and plaque size. Idebenone treatment effectively stabilized the atherosclerotic plaques. In mice treated with idebenone, 351 up-regulated and 379 down-regulated proteins were found to be significantly altered in proteomic analysis. In particular, the expression of SIRT3, SOD2, and NLRP3 was significantly regulated in the idebenone treatment groups compared with the HFD group both in vivo and in vitro. We further confirmed that idebenone protected against endothelial cell damage and inhibited the production of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS) in cholesterol-treated HUVECs. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated that idebenone acted as a mitochondrial protective agent by inhibiting the activation of NLPR3 via the SIRT3-SOD2-mtROS pathway. Idebenone may be a promising therapy for patients with atherosclerosis by improving mitochondrial dysfunction and inhibiting oxidative stress.",

      "abstract": "Oxidative stress occurs when physiological antioxidant systems do not manage to counteract the excessive intracellular production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which accumulate leading to irreversible oxidation of DNA and other biomacromolecules, and thus to the onset of pathological conditions. Autosomal recessive spastic ataxia of Charlevoix-Saguenay (ARSACS) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by autosomal recessive mutations in the sacsin gene (SACS). It has been demonstrated that cells of ARSACS patients show bioenergetic and mitochondrial impairment, denoted by reduced respiratory chain activities and ATP synthesis. In order to design a suitable therapy for ARSACS, it is essential to consider that treatments need to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB), a specialized structure that separates the subtle environment of the brain from blood circulation. Nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs), constituted by a solid lipid shell and a liquid lipid phase in the core, have been fabricated for loading hydrophobic molecules, improving their bioavailability. Idebenone (IDE), a synthetic analogue of coenzyme Q10, is able to inhibit lipid peroxidation and detoxify several free radicals. However, because of its poor solubility, it requires ad hoc drug-delivery systems for enhancing its pharmacokinetic properties, preventing undesired cytotoxicity. In this work, NLCs loaded with idebenone (IDE-NLCs) have been prepared. The nanovectors have been physicochemically characterized, and their biological activity has been evaluated on different central nervous system cell lines. IDE-NLCs demonstrated to be stable in water and in cell culture media, and showed a sustained drug release profile. Interestingly, preliminary data demonstrated their ability to permeate an in vitro BBB model. Their protective antioxidant activity in human healthy primary skin fibroblasts and their therapeutic efficacy in ARSACS-derived primary skin fibroblasts have been also investigated, showing their potential for future development as therapeutic agents."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Idebenone is a well-appreciated mitochondrial protectant while the mechanisms underlying the neuroprotection in cerebral ischemia and reperfusion (I/R) remain elusive. It has been manifested NLRP3 inflammasom activation contributed to I/R induced damage. It raises questions how exactly NLRP3 inflammasom was activated in microglia and neuron and whether idebenone reverses the process in I/R. METHODS: I/R rat model was utilized and BV2, primary microglia and PC12 cells were subjected to oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD). Then, western-blotting, q-PCR, immunofluorescence staining, ELISA, flow cytometry and immunoprecipitation analysis were performed. RESULTS: We found ROS-NLRP3 singaling was activated in BV2 cells at OGD/R 24 h. Importantly, microglial NLRP3 activation was essential for NLRP3 activation in PC12 cells under microglial-neuronal co-culture circumstance, which has been confirmed to induced neuronal apoptosis. Further, we found mitochondrial dysfunction in OGD/R led to mt-DNA translocation as well as generation of mt-ROS, resulting cytosolic accumulation of oxidized mt-DNA. Ultimately, oxidized mt-DNA binding to NLRP3 contributed to further activation of NLRP3 and dramatically augmented inflammation in BV2 and PC12 cells. Furthermore, idebenone treatment inhibited the process, thus suppressing the NLRP3-mediated inflammatory injury after OGD/R. In vivo, NLRP3 was activated in microglia of I/R rats and inhibition of NLRP3 was observed in idebenone treatment group, which had less neurological deficit and less infarct volume. INTERPRETATION: Our data revealed the anti-inflammatory effects of idebenone via suppressing activation of NLRP3 and ameliorating NLRP3-mediating damage in I/R, which may provide new insight in therapeutic strategy for ischemic stroke.",

      "abstract": "Idebenone is a synthetic quinone that on reduction in cells can bypass mitochondrial Complex I defects by donating electrons to Complex III. The drug is used clinically to treat the Complex I disease Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON), but has been less successful in clinical trials for other neurodegenerative diseases. NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1) appears to be the main intracellular enzyme catalyzing idebenone reduction. However, NQO1 is not universally expressed by cells of the brain. Using primary rat cortical cells pooled from both sexes, we tested the hypotheses that the level of endogenous NQO1 activity limits the ability of neurons, but not astrocytes, to use idebenone as an electron donor to support mitochondrial respiration. We then tested the prediction that NQO1 induction by pharmacological activation of the transcription factor nuclear erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) enables idebenone to bypass Complex I in cells with poor NQO1 expression. We found that idebenone stimulated respiration by astrocytes but reduced the respiratory capacity of neurons. Importantly, idebenone supported mitochondrial oxygen consumption in the presence of a Complex I inhibitor in astrocytes but not neurons, and this ability was reversed by inhibiting NQO1. Conversely, recombinant NQO1 delivery to neurons prevented respiratory impairment and conferred Complex I bypass activity. Nrf2 activators failed to increase NQO1 in neurons, but carnosic acid induced NQO1 in COS-7 cells that expressed little endogenous enzyme. Carnosic acid-idebenone combination treatment promoted NQO1-dependent Complex I bypass activity in these cells. Thus, combination drug strategies targeting NQO1 may promote the repurposing of idebenone for additional disorders.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Idebenone is used clinically to treat loss of visual acuity in Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy. Clinical trials for several additional diseases have failed. This study demonstrates a fundamental difference in the way idebenone affects mitochondrial respiration in cortical neurons compared with cortical astrocytes. Cortical neurons are unable to use idebenone as a direct mitochondrial electron donor due to NQO1 deficiency. Our results suggest that idebenone behaves as an NQO1-dependent prodrug, raising the possibility that lack of neuronal NQO1 activity has contributed to the limited efficacy of idebenone in neurodegenerative disease treatment. Combination therapy with drugs able to safely induce NQO1 in neurons, as well as other brain cell types, may be able to unlock the neuroprotective therapeutic potential of idebenone or related quinones.",

      "abstract": "Cataract is the principal cause of blindness. The enzyme, aldose reductase (AR) is a key player in polyol pathway. Buildup of polyols and oxidative stress are the main causes of cataractogenesis. This study investigated the cytoprotective properties of esculetin and idebenone in galactose-induced cataract. Rats were partitioned into four groups each of ten rats. Control group was fed with normal diet; group 2 rats were fed with galactose diet (50%); groups 3, 4 rats were fed with galactose diet concurrently with either esculetin (50 mg/kg BW) or idebenone (100 mg/kg BW), for 20 days. The study revealed that esculetin and idebenone significantly reduced the elevated levels of Bax/Bcl-2 ratio, malondialdehyde, and DNA fragmentation and increased total antioxidant capacity level in lenses compared to the cataract-induced group. Only esculetin decreased AR, galactitol, and advanced glycated end products levels in lenses. Histopathological examinations supported the biochemical findings. Esculetin and idebenone may have chemopreventive effects for sugar cataract. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Cataract is an age-related disease that might cause blindness in older adult people. Presently, no absolute pharmacological treatment is accessible for cataract. The use of natural products or their derivatives attract particular attention in modern medicines as they are believed to be safer with few or no side effects. Esculetin is a polyphenolic compound found in many medicinal plants. Idebenone is a synthetic analogue of coenzyme Q10. The current study is an approach to explore the anticataract effects of esculetin and idebenone in galactose-induced cataract in rats. Our study proved that both agents have anticataractogenic potentials due to their antioxidant and antiapoptotic properties.",

We investigated an application of the sequence for imaging the optic nerve in subjects with Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON). Of particular note is the sequence's near-silent operation, which can enhance image quality of the optic nerve by reducing the occurrence of involuntary saccades induced during Magnetic Resonance (MR) scanning."

Methods: This was a retrospective case-controlled study of the effect of idebenone (900 mg/d) on 30 patients with LHON due to m.3460 G > A, m.11778 G > A and m.14484 T > C mutations. The primary end-point was the recovery in VA after 3 and 6 mon. The main secondary end-point was the change in VF, VEP and RNFL thickness. The other secondary end-point was the correlation between visual changes after 6 mon and the VF, VEP and RNFL thickness at baseline of the groups. Results: Idebenone was shown to be safe and well tolerated. The primary end-point reached statistical significance. The VA in the idebenone group improved in both the best eye and worst eye. The mean defect of VF decreased and amplitude of VEP increased. There was no significant difference in latency and RNFL thickness between the groups. The treatment, together with the VA and amplitude at baseline, had a significant effect on the improvement in VA at 6 mon. Conclusion: This case-controlled study of LHON provides evidence that idebenone treatment may be beneficial in cases of LHON and that the influential factors governing outcomes are the VA and amplitude of the VEP at baseline.",

STUDY DESIGN: Clinical comparative study. PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY: Department of Neurology, Baoding First Central Hospital, from June 2017 to June 2018. METHODOLOGY: Eighty-eight VD patients were divided into observation group (44 cases) and control group (44 cases) at random. Idebenone was given to the control group, and butyphthalide combined with idebenone was given to the observation group for 12 weeks. C-reactive protein (CRP), tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and interleukin-1β (IL-1β) were detected before and after the treatment to evaluate the level of serum inflammatory factors. Peripheral blood endothelial microparticles (EMPs), endothelin (ET-1), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) were detected to evaluate vascular endothelial functions. Mini-mental state examination (MMSE), clinical dementia scale (CDR), and ability of daily life (ADL), were used to evaluate cognitive function, dementia degree, and self-care ability in daily life. The occurrences of adverse reactions were recorded. RESULTS: Before the treatment, the comparison differences in the indexes of both groups had no statistical significance (p>0.05). After the treatment, the scores of CD62E+, VEGF, and MMSE of observation group rose obviously, compared with those before the treatment, and were significantly higher than those of control group (p <0.05). After the treatment, the scores of IL-6, CRP, TNF-α, IL-1β, CD31+, CDl44+, ET-1, CDR and ADL of observation group significantly lowered, compared with those before the treatment, and were significantly lower than those of control group (p <0.05). The differences in the adverse reactions of both groups had no statistical significance (p >0.05). CONCLUSION: Butyphthalide combined with idebenone can effectively reduce serum inflammatory factor level of VD patients, regulate vascular endothelial functions, relieve dementia degree, and improve cognitive function and daily activity ability.",

      "abstract": "Decline in respiratory function in patients with DMD starts during early teenage years and leads to early morbidity and mortality. Published evidence of efficacy for idebenone on respiratory function outcomes is currently limited to 12 months of follow-up time. Here we report data collected as retrospective cohort study (SYROS) from 18 DMD patients not using glucocorticoids who were treated with idebenone (900 mg/day) under Expanded Access Programs (EAPs). The objective was to assess the long-term respiratory function evolution for periods On-Idebenone compared to periods Off-Idebenone in the same patients. The mean idebenone exposure in the EAPs was 4.2 (range 2.4-6.1) years. The primary endpoint was the annual change in forced vital capacity percent of predicted (FVC%p) compared between Off-Idebenone and On-Idebenone periods. The annual rate of decline in FVC%p was reduced by approximately 50% from -7.4% (95% CI: -9.1, -5.8) for the Off-Idebenone periods to -3.8% (95% CI: -4.8, -2.8) for the On-Idebenone periods (N = 11). Similarly, annual change in peak expiratory flow percent of predicted (PEF%p) was -5.9% (95% CI: -8.0, -3.9) for the Off-Idebenone periods (N = 9) and reduced to -1.9% (95% CI: -3.2, -0.7) for the On-Idebenone periods during the EAPs. The reduced rates of decline in FVC%p and PEF%p were maintained for several years with possible beneficial effects on the rate of bronchopulmonary adverse events, time to 10% decline in FVC%p and risk of hospitalization due to respiratory cause. These long-term data provide Class IV evidence to further support the disease modifying treatment effect of idebenone previously observed in randomized, controlled trials.",

      "abstract": "Idebenone has recently been investigated as a drug therapy for Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON), a rare genetic mitochondrial disease that causes rapid and progressive bilateral vision loss. Although several studies have shown that idebenone can promote vision recovery in patients with LHON, the evidence for the efficacy of idebenone is still limited. Idebenone failed to demonstrate superiority over placebo in the primary end-points of the only published randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. There appears to be a patient-specific response to idebenone with high variability in therapeutic outcomes. A recent study suggested that the cytosolic enzyme NAD(P)H: quinone acceptor oxidoreductase (NQO1) is the major enzyme involved in the activation of idebenone, and the beneficial effects of idebenone are dependent on the expression of NQO1. Here, we confirm the NQO1-dependent activity of idebenone, but we also show, for the first time, that the cytotoxicity of idebenone is linked to cellular expression of NQO1. Upon idebenone administration, cells deficient in NQO1 show a marked decrease in viability in comparison to NQO1 expressing cells, with idebenone causing ROS production and deleterious effects on ATP levels and cell viability. In addition, our data highlights that only cells expressing NQO1 can significantly activate idebenone, indicating that other proposed metabolic activation pathways, such as complex II and glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, do not play a significant role in idebenone activation. Furthermore, we provide evidence of idebenone-induced toxicity in the retina ex-vivo, which can be explained by the variation of NQO1 expression between different cell types in the mouse retina. Idebenone mediated cell rescue in the rotenone ex vivo model also indicated that this drug has a narrow therapeutic window. These findings will help to guide the development of future therapies and drug delivery strategies including intra-ocular administration. The specific dependence of idebenone activity on NQO1 may also explain the variation in patient outcomes in clinical trials.",

      "abstract": "Alveolar epithelial injury induced by reactive oxygen species (ROS) and abnormal collagen production by activated fibroblasts (myofibroblasts) is involved in the onset and exacerbation of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Compared with alveolar epithelial cells, lung fibroblasts, especially myofibroblasts, exhibit an apoptosis-resistance phenotype (apoptosis paradox) that appears to be involved in IPF pathogenesis. Thus, we screened for chemicals eliciting preferential cytotoxicity of LL29 cells (lung fibroblasts from an IPF patient) compared with A549 cells (human lung alveolar epithelial cell line) from medicines already in clinical use. We identified idebenone, a synthetic analogue of coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10, an antioxidant) that has been used clinically as a brain metabolic stimulant. Idebenone induced cell growth inhibition and cell death in LL29 cells at a lower concentration than in A549 cells, a feature that was not observed for other antioxidant molecules (such as CoQ10) and two IPF drugs (pirfenidone and nintedanib). Administration of idebenone prevented bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis and increased pulmonary ROS levels. Importantly, idebenone also improved pulmonary fibrosis and lung function when administered after the development of fibrosis, whereas administration of CoQ10 similarly prevented bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis, but had no effect after its development. Administration of idebenone, but not CoQ10, suppressed bleomycin-induced increases in lung myofibroblasts. In vitro, treatment of LL29 cells with idebenone, but not CoQ10, suppressed TGF-β-induced collagen production. These results suggest that in addition to antioxidant activity, idebenone exerts inhibitory activity on the function of lung fibroblasts, with the former activity being preventative and the latter therapeutic for bleomycin-induced fibrosis. Thus, we propose that idebenone may be more therapeutically beneficial for IPF patients than current treatments."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: A role for mitochondrial dysfunction has been proposed in the immune dysregulation and organ damage characteristic of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Idebenone is a coenzyme Q10 synthetic quinone analog and an antioxidant that has been used in humans to treat diverse diseases in which mitochondrial function is impaired. This study was undertaken to assess whether idebenone ameliorates lupus in murine models. METHODS: Idebenone was administered orally to MRL/lpr mice at 2 different doses (1 gm/kg or 1.5 gm/kg idebenone-containing diet) for 8 weeks. At peak disease activity, clinical, immunologic, and metabolic parameters were analyzed and compared to those in untreated mice (n = 10 per treatment group). Results were confirmed in the lupus-prone NZM2328 mouse model. RESULTS: In MRL/lpr mice, idebenone-treated mice showed a significant reduction in mortality incidence (P < 0.01 versus untreated mice), and the treatment attenuated several disease features, including glomerular inflammation and fibrosis (each P < 0.05 versus untreated mice), and improved renal function in association with decreased renal expression of interleukin-17A (IL-17A) and mature IL-18. Levels of splenic proinflammatory cytokines and inflammasome-related genes were significantly decreased (at least P < 0.05 and some with higher significance) in mice treated with idebenone, while no obvious drug toxicity was observed. Idebenone inhibited neutrophil extracellular trap formation in neutrophils from lupus-prone mice (P < 0.05) and human patients with SLE. Idebenone also improved mitochondrial metabolism (30% increase in basal respiration and ATP production), reduced the extent of heart lipid peroxidation (by one-half that of untreated mice), and significantly improved endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation (P < 0.001). NZM2328 mice exposed to idebenone also displayed improvements in renal and systemic inflammation, reducing the kidney pathology score (P < 0.05), IgG/C3 deposition (P < 0.05), and the gene expression of interferon, proinflammatory, and inflammasome-related genes (at least P < 0.05 and some with higher significance). CONCLUSION: Idebenone ameliorates murine lupus disease activity and the severity of organ damage, supporting the hypothesis that agents that modulate mitochondrial biologic processes may have a therapeutic role in human SLE.",

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON) is a mitochondrial disease characterized by a subacute and progressive impairment and subsequent degeneration of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). In most cases, it results in optic nerve atrophy and permanently reduced visual acuity (VA). Idebenone has recently been approved in Europe for treating LHON. However, published clinical data has only focused on efficacy in patients within the first years after disease onset. The present study is the first to evaluate possible effects of idebenone treatment in patients with LHON when initiated after more than 5 years from disease onset. METHODS: Oral treatment with idebenone 300 mg tid was started in seven patients 5 to 51 years after LHON onset. All patients had genetically confirmed primary LHON mutations (m11778G>A, m14484T>C, and m13051G>A). Visual function of all fourteen eyes was tested every 3 months using logarithmic reading charts and automated static threshold perimetry. The obtained clinical data were analyzed retrospectively using a multivariate analysis for VA and the Wilcoxon signed-rank test for visual field data. RESULTS: Before treatment, VA was 0.78 ± 0.38 logMAR (range 0.24 to 1.50 logMAR). During the first year of therapy, VA improved significantly by an average of - 0.20 ± 0.10 logMAR or 10 ± 5 ETDRS letters (P = 0.002; VA range 0.06 to 1.30 logMAR). Seven of fourteen eyes showed an improvement of 2 or more lines. Visual field mean deviation increased from - 8.02 ± 6.11 to - 6.48 ± 5.26 dB after 12 months, but this change was not statistically significant (P = 0.056). CONCLUSIONS: The increase in VA of patients who have had LHON for more than 5 years observed soon after start of treatment may not constitute a coincidental spontaneous recovery. We hypothesize that the treatment response in chronic LHON was the result of a reactivated signal transduction in surviving dysfunctional RGCs. The results of this study indicate a beneficial effect of idebenone on improvement of visual function in LHON patients with established optic atrophy.",

      "abstract": "Novel therapeutic strategies to treat mitochondrial deficiencies in acute coronary syndromes are needed. Complex I of the mitochondrial electron transport system is damaged following ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. This disruption contributes to aberrant electron transport, diminished bioenergetics, an altered redox environment, and mitochondrial damage involved in tissue injury. In this study, we determined the cardiac and mitochondrial effects of idebenone, a benzoquinone currently in several clinical trials with purported 'antioxidant' effects. We employed complimentary models of ischemia/reperfusion injury in perfused hearts, permeabilized cardiac fibers, isolated mitochondria, and in cells to elucidate idebenone's cardioprotective mechanism(s). In ex vivo whole hearts, infarct size was markedly reduced with post-ischemic idebenone treatment (25 ± 5% area at risk, AAR) compared to controls (56 ± 6% AAR, P < .05). Several parameters of hemodynamic function were also significantly improved after idebenone treatment. Parallel studies of anoxia/reoxygenation were conducted using isolated mitochondria and permeabilized ventricular fibers. In isolated mitochondria, we simultaneously monitored respiration and ROS emission. Idebenone treatment modestly elevated succinate-derived H2O2 production when compared to vehicle control (1.34 ± 0.05 vs 1.21 ± 0.05%, H2O2/O2 respectively, P < .05). Isolated mitochondria subjected to anoxia/reoxygenation demonstrated higher rates of respiration with idebenone treatment (2360 ± 69 pmol/s*mg) versus vehicle control (1995 ± 101 pmol/s*mg). Both mitochondria and permeabilized cardiac fibers produced high rates of H2O2 after anoxia/reoxygenation, with idebenone showing no discernable attenuation on H2O2 production. These insights were further investigated with studies in mitochondria isolated from reperfused ventricle. The profound decrease in complex-I dependent respiration after ischemia/reperfusion (701 ± 59 pmolO2/s*mg compared to 1816 ± 105 pmol O2/s*mg in normoxic mitochondria) was attenuated with idebenone treatment (994 ± 76 vs pmol O2/s*mg, P < .05). Finally, the effects of idebenone were determined using permeabilized cell models with chemical inhibition of complex I. ADP-dependent oxidative phosphorylation capacity was significantly higher in complex-I inhibited cells treated acutely with idebenone (89.0 ± 4.2 pmol/s*million cells versus 70.1 ± 8.2 pmol/s*million cells in untreated cells). Taken together, these data indicate that the cardioprotective effects of idebenone treatment do not involve ROS-scavenging but appear to involve augmentation of the quinone pool, thus providing reducing equivalents downstream of complex I. As this compound is already in clinical trials for other indications, it may provide a safe and useful approach to mitigate ischemia/reperfusion injury in patients.",

Idebenone is a potent antioxidant which has already been evaluated in several clinical trials in FRDA, with reports of symptomatic benefit but inconclusive objective results. Following patient consultation on design, we have completed a treatment-withdrawal study to establish whether patients could correctly determine their treatment allocation to placebo or idebenone. Our aim was to capture subjective experiences of symptoms such as fatigue, which can be difficult to measure with questionnaires or semi-quantitative scales, particularly in chronic, slowly progressive conditions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients taking idebenone for at least 12 months as part of the open-label MICONOS Extension Study were randomized to receive either placebo or idebenone continuation for 2-month treatment cycles. The primary endpoint was patient assessment of treatment assignment. RESULTS: A total of 29 patients were randomized, forming the idebenone group (n = 16) and the placebo group (n = 13). No significant differences were detected between the idebenone and placebo groups on assessment of treatment assignment or early study withdrawal. A small but significant difference in ataxia rating scale scores was detected between treatment groups when considering ambulatory patients only. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides no data to suggest that FRDA patients could correctly determine their treatment assignment over a 2-month period. We hope that this study design will help inform future trials so that patients' experiences of symptoms are more reliably measured.",

In this work, to improve IDE topical effectiveness, we explored a two-steps approach: (1) we synthesized an IDE ester (IDEPCA) with pyroglutamic acid, a molecule whose hydrating effects are well known; (2) we loaded IDEPCA into solid lipid nanocarriers (SLN). We evaluated in vitro antioxidant and anti-glycation activity and in vivo hydrating effects after topical application in human volunteers from gel vehicles of IDEPCA SLN in comparison to IDE SLN. All SLN showed good technological properties (mean particle size < 25 nm, polydispersity index < 0.300, good stability). The oxygen radical absorbance capacity assay showed that IDEPCA SLN and IDE SLN had similar antioxidant activity while IDEPCA SLN were more effective in the in vitro NO scavenging assay. Both IDEPCA and IDE SLN showed the same effectiveness in inhibiting the formation of advanced glycation end products. In vivo experiments pointed out a better hydrating effect of IDEPCA SLN in comparison to IDE SLN. These results suggest that the investigated approach could be a promising strategy to obtain topical formulations with increased hydrating effects."

The results showed that the coadministration of Qur or Id to rats intoxicated with TiO2-NPs markedly ameliorated the elevation in hepatic malondialdehyde (MDA), serum alanine amino-transferase (ALT), glucose, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6), immunoglobin G (IgG), and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels compared to their levels in TiO2-NPs-treated rats. The aforementioned antioxidants also effectively modulated the changes in the levels of serum vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), nitric oxide (NO), hepatic DNA breakage, caspase-3, and inhibition of drug metabolizing enzymes (cytochrome P450s; CYP4502E12E1) in rat livers induced by TiO2-NPs toxicity. The histopathological examination of the liver section showed that TiO2-NPs caused severe degeneration of most hepatocytes with an increase in collagen in the portal region, while treatment with the antioxidants in question improved liver architecture. These outcomes supported the use of Qur and Id as protective agents against the hepatotoxicity induced by TiO2-NPs and other hepatotoxic drugs."

To find new PPAR ligands with fewer toxic effects, we generated transgenic zebrafish that can be screened in high throughput for new tissue-selective PPAR partial agonists. A structural analog of coenzyme Q10 (idebenone) that elicits spatially restricted partial agonist activity for both PPARα and PPARγ was identified. Coenzyme Q10 was also found to bind and activate both PPARs in a similar fashion, suggesting an endogenous role in relaying the states of mitochondria, peroxisomes and cellular redox to the two receptors. Testing idebenone in a mouse model of type 2 diabetes revealed the ability to reverse fatty liver development. These findings indicate new mechanisms of action for both PPARα and PPARγ, and new potential treatment options for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and steatosis.This article has an associated First Person interview with the first author of the paper.",

RESULTS: Embryos from mild diabetic rats showed increased levels of nitrated proteins, 4-hydroxynonenal and matrix metalloproteinase 9, which were prevented by idebenone administration. We also found a decreased embryonic expression of cytochrome c oxidase and reduced mRNA levels of peroxisome proliferator activated receptor-γ coactivator-1-α and nuclear respiratory factor-1, both of which were prevented by idebenone administration to the diabetic pregnant rats. Embryos from mild diabetic rats also showed an increased apoptotic rate, which was diminished by idebenone treatment. CONCLUSION: Maternal idebenone treatment ameliorates altered parameters related to the prooxidant-proinflammatory environment found in embryos from mild diabetic rats, suggesting a putative treatment to prevent diabetes-induced embryo alterations.",

      "abstract": "Idebenone is a hydrophilic short-chain coenzyme (Co) Q analogue, which has been used as a potential bypass of defective complex I in both Leber Hereditary Optic Neuropathy and OPA1-dependent Dominant Optic Atrophy. Based on its potential antioxidant effects, it has also been tested in degenerative disorders such as Friedreich's ataxia, Huntington's and Alzheimer's diseases. Idebenone is rapidly modified but the biological effects of its metabolites have been characterized only partially. Here we have studied the effects of quinones generated during in vivo metabolism of idebenone with specific emphasis on 6-(9-carboxynonyl)-2,3-dimethoxy-5-methyl-1,4-benzoquinone (QS10). QS10 partially restored respiration in cells deficient of complex I or of CoQ without inducing the mitochondrial permeability transition, a detrimental effect of idebenone that may offset its potential benefits [Giorgio et al. (2012) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 1817: 363-369]. Remarkably, respiration was largely rotenone-insensitive in complex I deficient cells and rotenone-sensitive in CoQ deficient cells. These findings indicate that, like idebenone, QS10 can provide a bypass to defective complex I; and that, unlike idebenone, QS10 can partially replace endogenous CoQ. In zebrafish (Danio rerio) treated with rotenone, QS10 was more effective than idebenone in allowing partial recovery of respiration (to 40% and 20% of the basal respiration of untreated embryos, respectively) and allowing zebrafish survival (80% surviving embryos at 60 h post-fertilization, a time point at which all rotenone-treated embryos otherwise died). We conclude that QS10 is potentially more active than idebenone in the treatment of diseases caused by complex I defects, and that it could also be used in CoQ deficiencies of genetic and acquired origin.",

      "abstract": "Retinal ischemia-reperfusion (RIR) injury causes neuronal degeneration and initiates various optic nerve diseases. This study aimed to investigate the synergistic neuroprotective effect of rasagiline and idebenone against RIR injury. A combination of rasagiline and idebenone was administered intraperitoneally immediately after establishment of the RIR model. Treatment with the combination of the two drugs resulted in a significant restoration of retinal thickness and retinal ganglion cells. Apoptosis of cells in ganglion cell layers was also ameliorated, suggesting that the effect of the two drugs was synergistic and the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor increased. Furthermore, idebenone and rasagiline induced the expression of Lin28A and Lin28B, respectively, which resulted in a reduced expression of microRNAs in the let-7 family and an increased protein output of Dicer. The data obtained from gene overexpression and knockdown experiments indicated that let-7 and Dicer were necessary for the synergistic neuroprotective effect of the two drugs. Our findings suggested that combination therapy with rasagiline and idebenone produced a synergistic effect that ameliorated RIR injury and restored visual function. In addition, the combined treatment provided neuroprotection via enhancement of the selective regulation of let-7 by Lin28A/B. These findings implied that a treatment with the combination of rasagiline and idebenone is a feasible treatment option for optic nerve diseases."

      "abstract": "The key role of antioxidants in treating and preventing many systemic and topical diseases is well recognized. One of the most potent antioxidants available for pharmaceutical and cosmetic use is Idebenone (IDE), a synthetic analogue of Coenzyme Q10. Unfortunately, IDE's unfavorable physicochemical properties such as poor water solubility and high lipophilicity impair its bioavailability after oral and topical administration and prevent its parenteral use. In recent decades, many strategies have been proposed to improve IDE effectiveness in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases and skin disorders. After a brief description of IDE potential therapeutic applications and its pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile, this review will focus on the different approaches investigated to overcome IDE drawbacks, such as IDE incorporation into different types of delivery systems (liposomes, cyclodextrins, microemulsions, self-micro-emulsifying drug delivery systems, lipid-based nanoparticles, polymeric nanoparticles) and IDE chemical modification. The results of these studies will be illustrated with emphasis on the most innovative strategies and their future perspectives."

      "abstract": "In recent years, stem cell research has continued to benefit from its crossover with chemistry, particularly the investigation of small molecular drugs modulating specific targets to regulate stem cell fate. Idebenone (IDB) is a yellow crystalline powder that is used in the treatment of chronic cerebrovascular diseases. The objective of the present study was to examine whether IDB had an influence on bone marrow‑derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) extracted from the bone marrow of Sprague‑Dawley rats. The effects of IDB on cell proliferation, cell cloning and migration were investigated. Cell cycle, apoptosis, DAPI nuclear staining and senescence‑associated β‑galactosidase (SA‑β‑gal) staining were also examined. The results revealed that IDB at suitable concentrations enhanced cell cloning capacity, promoted the proliferation of BMSCs, delayed cellular senescence, and inhibited cell apoptosis and migration. Western blot analysis indicated that IDB increased the expression of B‑cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl‑2), signal transducer and activator of transcription‑3, Nanog, octamer‑binding transcription factor 4, E‑cadherin, proliferating cell nuclear antigen, cyclinD1 and cyclinD3, and decreased the expression of Bcl‑2‑associated X protein, cleaved caspase‑3, N‑cadherin, vimentin and α‑smooth muscle actin. In conclusion, these experiments confirmed that IDB in low doses had no toxic effect and may exert protective effects on BMSCs.",

Standard of care guidelines command changes in disease management when forced vital capacity percent of predicted (FVC% p) falls below clinically relevant thresholds. The Phase 3 DELOS trial in patients with DMD demonstrated that idebenone reduces the loss of peak expiratory flow and FVC compared to placebo (Buyse GM, et al.; Lancet 2015; 385 : 1748-57). OBJECTIVE: Post-hoc analyses were conducted to assess whether treatment with idebenone could reduce the risk of patients dropping below clinically meaningful thresholds of FVC% p. METHODS: The DELOS trial enrolled DMD patients 10-18 years of age not using glucocorticoids to receive idebenone (N = 31) or placebo (N = 33) for 12 months. Change from baseline in FVC and FVC% p was assessed by hospital spirometry and analyzed by mixed model of repeated measures and slope analysis and proportions of patients falling below clinically meaningful thresholds of FVC% p were compared. RESULTS: The change over 1 year in FVC and FVC% p showed a consistent pattern in favor of idebenone treatment across multiple analysis methods and fewer patients in the idebenone group declined by a margin of 10% or more in FVC and FVC% p compared to placebo. There were also fewer patients in the idebenone group (15%) with a decline below FVC% p of 50% compared to the placebo group (25%) and fewer patients in the idebenone group (28%) showed a decline below FVC% p of 50% or 40% or 30% compared to the placebo group (43%). CONCLUSIONS: These data added to the consistency and clinical meaningfulness of findings from the DELOS trial showing that idebenone can slow the loss of pulmonary function in patients with DMD.",

Therefore, it is used in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease and other cognitive impairments. However, the mechanism of its action on neurodevelopment is still to be elucidated. Here we demonstrate that the cellular response of human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC) to idebenone depends on the stage of neural differentiation. When: neural stem cells (NSC), early neural progenitors (eNP) and advanced neural progenitors (NP) have been studied a significant stimulation of mitochondrial biogenesis was observed only at the eNP stage of development. This coexists with the enhancement of cell viability and increase in total cell number. In addition, we report novel idebenone properties in a possible regulation of neural stem cells fate decision: only eNP stage responded with up-regulation of both neuronal (MAP2), astrocytic (GFAP) markers, while at NSC and NP stages significant down-regulation of MAP2 expression was observed, promoting astrocyte differentiation. Thus, idebenone targets specific stages of hiPSC differentiation and may influence the neural stem cell fate decision.",

IDE and its derivatives loaded SLN showed good physico-chemical and technological properties (spherical shape, mean particle sizes 23-25 nm, single peak in the size distribution, ζ potential values -1.76/-2.89 mV, and good stability at room temperature). In vitro antioxidant activity of these SLN was evaluated in comparison with free drugs by means of oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) test. IDETRL and IDELIP showed a greater antioxidant activity than IDE and encapsulation of IDE and its derivatives into SLN was able to prolong their antioxidant activity. These results suggest that loading IDETRL and IDELIP into SLN could be a useful strategy to improve IDE efficacy.",

Idebenone is a synthetic short chain benzoquinone that acts as an electron carrier in the mitochondrial electron transport chain facilitating the production of adenosine triphosphate. It can be found in two different redox states that differ in their physiological properties. Idebenone has been investigated as a treatment in several neurological disorders like Friedreich's ataxia, Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy, mitochondrial encephalomyopathies and senile dementia. Accordingly, a micellar electrokinetic chromatography was employed to discriminate both redox forms. The final optimized system was validated in terms of selectivity, linearity (r2 0.992), limit of detection (0.5 µg/mL), limit of quantification (1.8 µg/mL), intra- and inter-day precision (RSD ≤ 2) and accuracy in terms of recovery studies (99.3-100.5%). Robustness was studied following a Plackett-Burman design. Finally, the validated system was applied to the analysis of idebenone in a pediatric formulation.",

The aims of this study were to characterize inspiratory function and to assess the efficacy of idebenone on this pulmonary function outcome in a large and well-characterized cohort of 10-18 year-old DMD patients not taking glucocorticoid steroids (GCs) enrolled in the phase 3 randomized controlled DELOS trial. We evaluated the effect of idebenone on the highest flow generated during an inspiratory FVC maneuver (maximum inspiratory flow; V'I,max(FVC)) and the ratio between the largest inspiratory flow during tidal breathing (tidal inspiratory flow; V'I,max(t)) and the V'I,max(FVC). The fraction of the maximum flow that is not used during tidal breathing has been termed inspiratory flow reserve (IFR). DMD patients in both treatment groups of DELOS (idebenone, n = 31; placebo: n = 33) had comparable and abnormally low V'I,max(FVC) at baseline. During the study period, V'I,max(FVC) further declined by -0.29 L/sec in patients on placebo (95%CI: -0.51, -0.08; P = 0.008 at week 52), whereas it remained stable in patients on idebenone (change from baseline to week 52: 0.01 L/sec; 95%CI: -0.22, 0.24; P = 0.950). The between-group difference favoring idebenone was 0.27 L/sec (P = 0.043) at week 26 and 0.30 L/sec (P = 0.061) at week 52. In addition, during the study period, IFR improved by 2.8% in patients receiving idebenone and worsened by -3.0% among patients on placebo (between-group difference 5.8% at week 52; P = 0.040). Although the clinical interpretation of these data is currently limited due to the scarcity of routine clinical practice experience with dynamic inspiratory function outcomes in DMD, these findings from a randomized controlled study nevertheless suggest that idebenone preserved inspiratory muscle function as assessed by V'I,max(FVC) and IFR in patients with DMD.

      "abstract": "In Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), progressive loss of respiratory function leads to restrictive pulmonary disease and places patients at significant risk for severe respiratory complications. Of particular concern are ineffective cough, secretion retention and recurrent respiratory tract infections. In a Phase 3 randomized controlled study (DMD Long-term Idebenone Study, DELOS) in DMD patients 10-18 years of age and not taking concomitant glucocorticoid steroids, idebenone (900 mg/day) reduced significantly the loss of respiratory function over a 1-year study period. In a post-hoc analysis of DELOS we found that more patients in the placebo group compared to the idebenone group experienced bronchopulmonary adverse events (BAEs): placebo: 17 of 33 patients, 28 events; idebenone: 6 of 31 patients, 7 events. The hazard ratios (HR) calculated \"by patient\" (HR 0.33, p = 0.0187) and for \"all BAEs\" (HR 0.28, p = 0.0026) indicated a clear idebenone treatment effect. The overall duration of BAEs was 222 days (placebo) vs. 82 days (idebenone). In addition, there was also a difference in the use of systemic antibiotics utilized for the treatment of BAEs. In the placebo group, 13 patients (39.4%) reported 17 episodes of antibiotic use compared to 7 patients (22.6%) reporting 8 episodes of antibiotic use in the idebenone group. Furthermore, patients in the placebo group used systemic antibiotics for longer (105 days) compared to patients in the idebenone group (65 days). This post-hoc analysis of DELOS indicates that the protective effect of idebenone on respiratory function is associated with a reduced risk of bronchopulmonary complications and a reduced need for systemic antibiotics.",

      "abstract": "Idebenone is a rapidly absorbed, safe and well-tolerated drug and is currently the only clinically proven treatment option for Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON) patients. Idebenone (Raxone®) is approved by the European Medicines Agency for the treatment of LHON and has been available on the European market since 2015. Due to its molecular mode of action of bypassing the defective mitochondrial complex I, idebenone leads to improved energy supply and a functional recovery of retinal ganglion cells during the acute stage of the disease, thereby preventing further vision loss and promoting recovery of vision. Thus, commencing treatment shortly after the onset of symptoms is likely to have the best therapeutic effect, a hypothesis that is supported by the available clinical data.",

      "abstract": "Idebenone (Raxone(®)), a short-chain benzoquinone, is the only disease-specific drug approved to treat visual impairment in adolescents and adults with Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON), a rare genetic mitochondrial disease that causes rapid and progressive bilateral vision loss. The mechanism of action of idebenone involves its antioxidant properties and ability to act as a mitochondrial electron carrier. Idebenone overcomes mitochondrial complex I respiratory chain deficiency in patients with LHON by transferring electrons directly to mitochondrial complex III (by-passing complex I), thereby restoring cellular energy (ATP) production and re-activating inactive-but-viable retinal ganglion cells, which ultimately prevents further vision loss and promotes vision recovery. The approval of idebenone in the treatment of LHON was based on the overall data from a randomized clinical trial, a follow-up study and real-world data. Taken together, these studies provide convincing evidence that oral idebenone 900 mg/day for 24 weeks has persistent beneficial effects in preventing further vision impairment and promoting vision recovery in patients with LHON relative to the natural course of the disease. Therefore, idebenone is a valuable agent to treat visual impairment in adolescents and adults with LHON.",

      "abstract": "The early stages of the atherosclerotic process are initiated by accumulation of oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL) and damage to the structure or function of the endothelium. Antioxidant supplementation may be a plausible strategy to prevent atherosclerotic disease by quenching excessive reactive oxidative species. In the present study, we demonstrated that idebenone at suitable concentrations significantly prevented oxLDL-induced endothelial dysfunction. The underlying mechanisms of idebenone included inhibition of oxidative damage, suppression of the down-regulation of Bcl-2 and up-regulation of Bax and cleaved caspase-3 in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) exposed to oxLDL. Moreover, idebenone pretreatment inhibited oxLDL-mediated HUVECs damage by attenuating lipid peroxidation and promoting SOD activity. Finally, pro-incubation with idebenone inhibited mitochondrial dysfunction induced by oxLDL through the mitochondrial-dependent apoptotic pathway and GSK3β/β-catenin signalling pathways. In summary, idebenone is a promising agent in the treatment or prevention of atherosclerosis via inhibiting oxidative stress and improving mitochondrial function.",
