      "abstract": "Accessing plant resources to extract compounds of interest can sometimes be challenging. To facilitate access and limit the environmental impact, innovative cultivation strategies can be developed. Forskolin is a molecule of high interest, mainly found in the roots of Coleus forskohlii. The aim of this study was to develop aeroponic cultivation methods to provide a local source of Coleus forskohlii and to study the impact of abiotic stress on forskolin and bioactive metabolite production. Three cultivation itineraries (LED lighting, biostimulant, and hydric stress) along with a control itinerary were established. The forskolin content in the plant roots was quantified using HPLC-ELSD, and the results showed that LED treatment proved to be the most promising, increasing root biomass and the total forskolin content recovered at the end of the cultivation period threefold (710.1 ± 21.3 mg vs. 229.9 ± 17.7 mg). Statistical analysis comparing the LED itinerary to the control itinerary identified stress-affected metabolites, showing that LEDs positively influence mainly the concentration of phenolic compounds in the roots and diterpenes in the aerial parts of Coleus forskohlii. Moreover, to better define the phytochemical composition of Coleus forskohlii cultivated in France using aeroponic cultivation, an untargeted metabolomic analysis was conducted using UHPLC-HRMS/MS analysis and molecular networks on both the root and aerial parts. This study demonstrates that aeroponic cultivation, especially with the application of an LED treatment, could be a very promising alternative for a local source of Coleus forskohlii leading to easy access to the roots and aerial parts rich in forskolin and other bioactive compounds.",

      "abstract": "Coleus forskohlii, an Indian-origin medicinal plant is the sole natural source of the labdane terpenoid forskolin (C22H34O7), with growing demand. Forskolin emerged as an industrially important bioactive compound, with many therapeutic applications in human health. It has established potential effects in the treatment of various diseases and conditions such as glaucoma, asthma, obesity, allergies, skin conditions and cardiovascular diseases. Moreover, clinical trials against different types of cancers are progressing. The mechanism of action of forskolin mainly involves activating adenylyl cyclase and elevating cAMP, thereby regulating different cellular processes. For the extraction of forskolin, tuberous roots of C. forskohlii are used as they contain the highest concentration of this metabolite. Approximately 2500 tonnes of the plant are cultivated annually to produce a yield of 2000-2200 kg ha-1 of dry tubers. The forskolin content of the root is distributed in the range of 0.01-1%, which cannot meet the increasing commercial demands from industries such as pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, dietary supplements, food and beverages. Hence, various aspects of micropropagation with different culture methods that employ precursors or elicitors to improve the forskolin content have been explored. Different extraction and analytical methods are also introduced to examine the yield and purity of forskolin. This review discusses the significance, clinical importance, mechanism of action and different approaches used for mass production including tissue culture for the lead compound forskolin to meet market needs."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: In obese humans, Coleus forskohlii root extract (CF) protects against weight gain owing to the presence of forskolin, an adenylate cyclase (AC) activator. As AC increases intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels in osteoblasts that has an osteogenic effect, we thus tested the skeletal effects of a standardized CF (CFE) in rats. METHODS: Concentrations of forskolin and isoforskolin were measured in CFE by HPLC. CFE and forskolin (the most abundant compound present in CFE) were studied for their osteogenic efficacy in vitro by alkaline phosphatase (ALP), cAMP and cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) assays. Femur osteotomy model was used to determine the osteogenic dose of CFE. In growing rats, CFE was tested for its osteogenic effect in intact bone. In adult ovariectomized (OVX) rats, we assessed the effect of CFE on bone mass, strength and material. The effect of forskolin was assessed in vivo by measuring the expression of osteogenic genes in the calvarium of rat pups. RESULTS: Forskolin content in CFE was 20.969%. CFE increased osteoblast differentiation and intracellular cAMP and cGMP levels in rat calvarial osteoblasts. At 25 mg/kg (half of human equivalent dose), CFE significantly enhanced calcein deposition at the osteotomy site. In growing rats, CFE promoted modeling-directed bone formation. In OVX rats, CFE maintained bone mass and microarchitecture to the level of sham-operated rats. Moreover, surface-referent bone formation in CFE treated rats was significantly increased over the OVX group and was comparable with the sham group. CFE also increased the pro-collagen type-I N-terminal propeptide: cross-linked C-telopeptide of type-I collagen (PINP : CTX-1) ratio over the OVX rats, and maintained it to the sham level. CFE treatment decreased the OVX-induced increases in the carbonate-to-phosphate, and carbonate-to-amide-I ratios. CFE also prevented the OVX-mediated decrease in mineral crystallinity. Nanoindentation parameters, including modulus and hardness, were decreased by OVX but CFE maintained these to the sham levels. Forskolin stimulated ALP, cAMP and cGMP in vitro and upregulated osteogenic genes in vivo. CONCLUSION: CFE, likely due to the presence of forskolin displayed a bone-conserving effect via osteogenic and anti-resorptive mechanisms resulting in the maintenance of bone mass, microarchitecture, material, and strength.",

Co-inoculation of RF1+TV1 showed significant improvement in plant growth (52%), root biomass (67%), and in-planta forskolin content (94%), followed by treatment with SF2+TV1 and SF1+TV1. qRT-PCR was carried out to quantify expression of five key forskolin biosynthetic pathway genes (CfTPS2, CfTPS3, CfTPS4, CfCYP76AH15, and CfACT1-8) in RF1+TV1 treated C. forskohlii plants. Elevated expression of CfTPS2, CfTPS4, CfCYP76AH15 and CfACT1-8 genes was observed with RF1+TV1 combination as compared to uninoculated C. forskohlii plants. Besides, RF1+TV1 treatment considerably reduced the severity of nematode infection of C. forskohlii plants under field conditions. Thus, congruent properties of F. redolens (RF1) were witnessed with co-inoculation of T. viride (TV1) under field conditions which resulted in enhanced forskolin content, root biomass, and reduced nematode infections in C. forskohlii. Overall, this approach could be an economical and sustainable step towards cultivation of commercially important medicinal plants.",

      "abstract": "Obesity is one of the main causes of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), which is associated with impaired liver functions including drug metabolism. Coleus forskohlii extract (CFE) is a popular ingredient of weight loss dietary supplements in Japan. In this study, we examined the effect of CFE on the treatment of NASH. C57BL/6 mice (male, 10-wk-old) were fed a NASH diet (high-fat, low-methionine, and choline-deficient diet) for 12 wk to establish NASH. Then, we examined the effect of 0.5% (w/w) CFE in diet during diet-treatment (change to control diet) and/or treadmill-exercise (45 min at 20 m/min, 5 d/wk) to improve NASH for 3 wk. After experimental period, lipids profiles and liver functional markers in the blood, and hepatic lipid content and major CYP subtype mRNA expression and activity in liver were measured. Diet-treatment, but not exercise decreased liver weight and hepatic lipid contents in NASH induced mice. CFE attenuated the effects of diet-treatment which reduced liver weight, even though body weight and adipose tissue weight were reduced. Further, CFE significantly increased liver microsomal CYP1A1, CYP1A2, CYP2C, and CYP3A activities in each condition, and CYP inductions were greater in diet-treatment group compared to those in exercise group. These results suggest that taking CFE should be avoided during diet-treatment of NASH, especially in patients under medication.",

      "abstract": "Endophytes have been shown to play a crucial role in determining the fitness of host plant during their association, yet the cross-functional effect of endophytes of one plant on another plant remains largely uncharacterized. In this study, we attempt to analyze the effect of native endophytes of Coleus forskohlii (Phialemoniopsis cornearis (SF1), Macrophomina pseudophaseolina (SF2), and Fusarium redolens (RF1), isolated from stem and root parts) on plant growth and secondary metabolite enhancement in medicinal plant Andrographis paniculata, and aromatic plants Pelargonium graveolens and Artemisia pallens. Here, we report, endophytic treatments with SF2 (21%) and RF1 (9%) in A. paniculata resulted in significant enhancement of andrographolide along with plant primary productivity. Correspondingly, application of fungal endophytes RF1, SF1, and SF2 significantly improved the plant growth (11 to 40%), shoot weight (28 to 34%), oil content (44 to 58%), and oil yield (72 to 122%) in P. graveolens. Interestingly, treatment of A. pallens with three fungal endophytes resulted in significant enhancement of plant productivity and oil content (12 to 80%) and oil yield (32 to 139%). Subsequently, the endophyte treatments RF1 and SF1 enhanced davanone (13 to 22%) and ethyl cinnamate (11 to 22%) content. However, SF2 endophyte-treated plants did not show any improvement in ethyl cinnamate content but enhanced the content of davanone (10%), a signature component of davana essential oil. Overall, results depict cross-functional role of native endophytes of C. forskohlii and repurposing of functional endophytes for sustainable cultivation of economically important medicinal and aromatic crops.",

Here, we report, for the first time, the role of plant-probiotic bacterial endophytes of C. forskohlii, CFLB1 and CFRB1, isolated from leaf and root, which regulate plant growth and in plant forskolin content. Native bacterial endophyte, CFRB1 (Alcaligenes faecalis), significantly modulates primary plant productivity and forskolin content under pot and field conditions. Under field conditions, CFRB1 endophyte application significantly enhanced photosynthetic pigments and reduced the severity of root-knot and root rot diseases. Expression analyses of functional genes involved in the forskolin biosynthesis in C. forskohlii plants treated with CFRB1 endophyte under field conditions revealed differential upregulation of four C. forskohlii diterpene synthases (CfTPSs), CfTPS1, CfTPS2, CfTPS3 and CfTPS4, along with cytochrome P450 (CfCYP76AH15) and acyltransferase (CfACT1-8) genes. CFRB1 treatment reduced the severity of nematode infection and root rot in C. forskohlii plants by 81 and 78%, respectively. Overall, we demonstrate that cross-talk of plant-endophyte interaction in C. forskohlii is beneficial, leading to enhanced forskolin content through modulation of forskolin biosynthetic pathway genes along with increased plant yield and reduced disease incidence. Thus, endophytic isolate, A. faecalis (CFRB1), could be deployed as a novel bio-stimulant for enhancing in planta forskolin content during cultivation of C. forskohlii.",

The plant has been used since ancient times in ayurvedic traditional medicines for the treatment of hypertension, glaucoma, asthma, congestive heart failures, obesity, and cancer. Use of endophytic microorganisms presents a special interest for the development of value-added bioactive compounds through agriculture. Limited investigations have been undertaken on in planta enhancement of forskolin content using endophytic fungus in sustainable agriculture. Here we report specific roles of three fungal endophytes, Fusarium redolens (RF1), Phialemoniopsis cornearis (SF1), and Macrophomina pseudophaseolina (SF2), functionally acting as plant probiotic fungus, regulating secondary metabolite (forskolin) biosynthesis in C. forskohlii. The root endophyte, RF1, and shoot endophytes, SF1 and SF2, were found to enhance forskolin content by 52 to 88% in pot and 60 to 84% in field experiments as compared to uninoculated control plants. The three endophytes also enhanced total biomass owing to plant growth promoting properties. The expression of diterpene synthases (CfTPSs) like CfTPS1, CfTPS2, CfTPS3, and CfTPS4 were significantly upregulated in endophyte-treated C. forskohlii plants. Elevated expression of key diterpene synthases (CfTPS2) in the forskolin biosynthesis pathway, exclusively present in the root cork of C. forskohlii, was observed following SF2 endophyte treatment. Furthermore, endophyte treatments conferred a variety of antagonistic activity against nematode galls (80%) and plant pathogens like Fusarium oxysporum, Colletotricum gloeosporioides, and Sclerotium rolfsii. RF1 and SF1 fungal endophytes showed positive for IAA production; however, SF1 also indicated phosphate solubilization activity. Overall, the qualitative and quantitative improvement of in planta forskolin enhancement represents an area of high commercial interest, and hence, our work focused on novel insights for the application of three fungal endophytes for in planta enhancement of forskolin content for C. forskohlii cultivation by a sustainable approach.",

      "abstract": "Asthma is characterized by airway inflammatory infiltration, which leads to airway remodeling and airway hyperreactivity. Coleus forskohlii (CFK) has been used to treat asthma, however, the mechanism involved is not clear. To explore the antiasthma mechanism of extracts of Coleus forskohlii (ECFK), guinea pigs were administered with a spray of phosphoric acid histamine, and rats were sensitized with ovalbumin (OVA). Hematoxylin and eosin staining (H&E) were used to evaluate pathological changes in lung tissue. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to determine cytokine levels in serum and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). Immunohistochemistry and Western blot analysis were used to assess the expression of intercellular cell adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), phosphorylation of p65 (p-p65), matrix metallopeptidase 9 (MMP-9), and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1 (TIMP-1). After ECFK treatment, the asthma incubation period of guinea pigs was significantly prolonged. The H&E results showed that the number of eosinophils in the 12.8 g/kg ECFK group was significantly lower when compared with the control group. Moreover, ELISA results demonstrated that interleukin (IL)-4, IL-5, and IL-17 in serum and BALF were significantly decreased, and interferon-γ (IFN-γ) and IL-10 were increased after ECFK treatment. In addition, ECFK treatment resulted in downregulation of ICAM-1, p-p65, MMP-9, and TIMP-1 in lung tissue after being sensitized by OVA. In conclusion, our findings indicated that ECFK significantly alleviated OVA-induced inflammatory infiltration and airway remodeling in asthma. This study laid a theoretical foundation for the clinical use of ECFK.",

The present study was conducted under near-natural field conditions to evaluate the effects of supplemental (s)-UV-B (ambient+3.6kJm-2day-1) treatment alone, and in combination with two doses of IAA (200ppm and 400ppm) exogenously applied as foliar spray on various growth-, morphological-, physiological-, and biochemical parameters of an indigenous medicinal plant, Coleus forskohlii. Under s-UV-B, the plant growth and morphology were adversely affected (along with reductions in protein- and chlorophyll contents) with concomitant increase in secondary metabolites (as substantiated by an increase in the activities of various enzymes of the phenylpropanoid pathway) and cumulative antioxidative potential (CAP), suggesting the plant's capability of adaptive resilience against UV-B. The essential oil content of the plant was, however, compromised reducing its pharmaceutical value. IAA application at both doses led to a reversal in the effects caused by s-UV-B radiation alone; both the plant growth as well as the essential oil content improved, especially at the higher IAA dose, suggesting its ameliorative role against UV-B induced oxidative stress, and also in improving the plant's medicinal value.",

Commercial production of forskolin relies exclusively on extraction from its only known natural source, the plant Coleus forskohlii, in which forskolin accumulates in the root cork. Here, we report the discovery of five cytochrome P450s and two acetyltransferases which catalyze a cascade of reactions converting the forskolin precursor 13R-manoyl oxide into forskolin and a diverse array of additional labdane-type diterpenoids. A minimal set of three P450s in combination with a single acetyl transferase was identified that catalyzes the conversion of 13R-manoyl oxide into forskolin as demonstrated by transient expression in Nicotiana benthamiana. The entire pathway for forskolin production from glucose encompassing expression of nine genes was stably integrated into Saccharomyces cerevisiae and afforded forskolin titers of 40 mg/L.",

      "abstract": "Cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (CYP450s) are known to play important roles in biosynthesis of all secondary metabolites, including flavonoids. Despite this, few CYP450s have been functionally characterized in model plants and roles of fewer CYP450s are known in non-model, medicinal, and aromatic plants. Our study in Coleus forskohlii indicates that flavone synthase (CYP93B) and flavonoid 3' monooxygenase (CYP706C) are key enzymes positioned at a metabolic junction, to execute the biosynthesis of different sub-classes of flavonoids (flavones, flavonol, anthocynanin, isoflavones etc.) from a common precursor. Such branch points are favored targets for artificially modulating the metabolic flux toward specific metabolites, through genetic manipulation or use of elicitors that differentially impact the expression of branch point genes. Genkwanin, the only flavone reported from C. forskohlii, is known to possess anti-inflammatory activity. It is biosynthesized from the general flavonoid precursor: naringenin. Two differentially expressed cytochrome P450 genes (CfCYP93B, CfCYP706C), exhibiting maximum expression in leaf tissues, were isolated from C. forskohlii. Mannitol treatment resulted in increased expression of CfCYP93B and decrease in expression of CfCYP706C. Metabolite quantification data showed that genkwanin content increased and anthocyanin levels decreased in response to mannitol treatment. Alignment, phylogenetic analysis, modeling, and molecular docking analysis of protein sequences suggested that CfCYP93B may be involved in conversion of naringenin to flavones (possibly genkwanin via apigenin), while CfCYP706C may act on common precursors of flavonoid metabolism and channel the substrate toward production of flavonols or anthocynanins. Decrease in expression of CfCYP706C and increase in accumulation of genkwanin suggested that mannitol treatment may possibly lead to accumulation of genkwanin via suppression of a competitive branch of flavonoids in C. forskohlii."

In the present study, an approach has been made to evaluate the effect of C. forskohlii and its major constituents on cytochrome P450 (CYP3A, CYP2B, and CYP2C) mRNA expression in rat hepatocytes. To gain better understanding of the herb-drug interaction potential of the chemical constituents present in C. forskohlii, the extract was subjected to column chromatography followed by standardization with respect to forskolin, 1-deoxyforskolin, and 1,9-dideoxyforskolin using reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC). Hepatocytes were treated with extracts, fractions, and phytoconstituents, followed by extraction and purification of total mRNA. Study of mRNA expression was carried out through reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, followed by agarose gel electrophoresis. Results revealed that the test substances did not show any significant mRNA expression compared to the control against CYP3A, CYP2B, and CYP2C. Positive controls such as dexamethasone and rifampin showed significantly high (p < 0.001) induction potential compared to the control. It can be concluded that C. forskohlii and its major constituents may not be involved in CYP450 induction-based drug interaction."

This randomized, double blind placebo-controlled clinical study assessed the effects of supplementation with C. forskohlii extract on key markers of obesity and metabolic parameters in overweight and obese individuals. Thirty participants completed the trial and they were randomly assigned to receive either 250 mg of C. forskohlii extract (n = 15) or a placebo twice daily for 12 weeks. All participants were advised to follow a hypocaloric diet throughout the study. Body weight, body mass index (BMI), waist and hip circumference, and waist to hip ratio, were monitored fortnightly. Dietary intake was assessed at the baseline and weeks 4, 8 and 12. Appetite was assessed using visual analogue scales and blood samples were analyzed for plasma lipids, ghrelin, leptin, glucose and insulin at the baseline and end of the intervention. Significant reductions to waist and hip circumference (p = 0.02; p = 0.01, respectively) were recorded in both experimental and placebo groups after the 12 week intervention. Furthermore, high density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) was significantly increased (p = 0.01) in both groups. The experimental group showed a favorable improvement in insulin concentration and insulin resistance (p = 0.001; 0.01 respectively) compared to the placebo group. These findings suggest that C. forskohlii extract in conjunction with a hypocaloric diet may be useful in the management of metabolic risk factors.",

In particular, increases in activity and protein expression were noted for the CYP2B, CYP2C, and CYP3A subtypes. CFE treatment dose-dependently attenuated both the hypoglycemic action of tolbutamide at 6 h and the plasma concentration of tolbutamide. The activity of (S)-warfarin 7-hydroxylase, a CYP2C enzyme was negatively correlated with plasma tolbutamide level, which also showed a negative correlation with the reduction of blood glucose level.

Results showed that forscolin was not metabolized in plasma of the four species but metabolized in liver microsomes of the four species.

Forscolin was metabolized by CYP3A4 in human liver microsomes. There was definite inhibition on CYP3A4 at the concentrations of forscolin between 0.1 ng x mL(-1) and 5 microg x mL(-1). Therefore, forscolin is rapidly excreted from liver microsomes. Attention should be paid to the drug interaction when forscolin was used along with other drugs metabolized by CYP3A4 in clinics.",

METHODS: Mice were fed various doses of CFE standardised with 10% forskolin in a normal diet for one week, or in protein diets containing 7% and 20% casein (low and normal) for four weeks. They were then administered with warfarin by gavage on the last two days of the treatment regimen, and blood coagulation parameters, as well as hepatic CYP, were analysed at 18 h after the last dose. Direct interaction between CFE and forskolin with CYP2C was evaluated in vitro. KEY FINDINGS: CFE dose dependently increased hepatic total CYP content and S-warfarin 7-hydroxylase activity at a dietary level of ≥0.05%. Warfarin-induced anticoagulation was attenuated by CFE in parallel with CYP induction. The findings were similar in mice fed diets containing CFE and different ratios of protein. CFE directly inhibited CYP2C activity in mouse and human liver microsomes in vitro, whereas forskolin was only slightly inhibitory. CONCLUSIONS: CFE attenuates the anticoagulant action of warfarin by inducing hepatic CYP2C; thus, caution is required with the combination of warfarin and dietary supplements containing CFE.",

Food intake, body weights, relative organ weights and liver marker enzymes [aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP)] combined with histophatological analysis were assessed. CFE (0-0.5%) only had minimal effects on food intake and body weight whereas a significant difference was observed in mice receiving the highest dose (5% CFE). The extract 0.05-5% dose-dependently decreased visceral fat weight by between 16% and 63%, and a dose-dependent several folds increase was observed in liver weights and plasma AST, ALT and ALP activities with quick onset apparent after only 1 week of 0.5% CFE intake. The hepatic effect persisted throughout the 3-weeks course but was restored towards normalization within 1 week after withdrawal of treatment. Liver histology of mice fed 0.5% CFE for 3 weeks showed hepatocyte hypertrophy and fat deposition. In contrast, none of the hepatic responses measured were altered when mice were given a diet containing pure forskolin alone at the dose corresponding to its content in 0.5% CFE. The present study clearly indicated that forskolin was not involved in the CFE-induced hepatotoxicity and was caused by other unidentified constituents in CFE which warrants further studies.",

      "abstract": "Hypertension is the most common psychosomatic disorder affecting 972 million people worldwide. The present clinical study deals with the effect of Makandi (Coleus forskohlii (Willd.) Briq.) Ghana vati and tablets of its powder in hypertension found in the geriatric age group (50-80 years). A total of 49 hypertensive patients fulfilling the diagnostic criteria were registered in two groups-Group I (Ghana vati) and Group II (Churna tablet). Out of 27 enrolled patients of group I, 21 patients completed the treatment. In Group II, out of 22 registered patients, a total of 20 patients completed the treatment. The effect of the therapy was assessed on the basis of changes in the systolic and diastolic blood pressures, in both sitting and supine positions; with Manasa Bhava Pariksha, Manasa Vibhrama Pariksha, symptomatology, geriatric signs and symptoms, and a brief psychiatric rating scale. Analysis of the results showed that the treatment in both the groups had been found to be good. It can be stated that Makandi, either in Ghana vati form or in churna tablet form, is an effective remedy for the treatment of hypertension. On analyzing the overall effect, 76.19% patients in Group I and 75.00% patients in Group II were mildly improved. Comparatively the overall treatment with group I was found to be better."

      "abstract": "The antiobesity effects of Coleus forskohlii were investigated in ovariectomized (ovx) rats. Eight-week-old female Wistar rats were assigned to four groups: a sham-operated group fed the control diet (MF, sham-m) ; an ovx-m group fed the control diet; a sham-operated group fed the control diet containing 50 g/kg of Coleus forskohlii extract (sham-c) ; and an ovx-c group fed the control diet containing 50 g/kg of Coleus forskohlii extract. The body weight, adipose tissues, and cell diameter were investigated in ovx rats after Coleus forskohlii extract treatment. Administration of Coleus forskohlii extracts reduced body weight, food intake, and fat accumulation in ovx rats. Our results suggest that Coleus forskohlii may be useful in the treatment of obesity.",
