      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES:  This study aimed to examine the wear on opposing enamel caused by additive manufacturing techniques for cobalt-chromium (Co-Cr) alloys. Selective laser melting (SLM) techniques were compared with conventional methods. Cast nickel-chromium (Ni-Cr) alloys were also included for comparison. MATERIALS AND METHODS:  Four groups of dental alloys were examined (n = 10/group): as-built SLM Co-Cr (CS), heat-treated SLM Co-Cr (CS-H), cast Co-Cr (CC), and cast Ni-Cr (NC) alloys. Surface roughness and hardness of these alloys were initially assessed. Wear test was conducted against human enamel cusps using a chewing simulator (49-N load, 1.6-Hz frequency). Volumetric and vertical enamel wear were measured at 60,000, 120,000, and 240,000 chewing cycles using an intraoral scanner combined with open-source 3D software. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS:  Enamel wear was analyzed using a generalized estimating equation (α = 0.05). RESULTS:  Alloy hardness varied among the groups. NC exhibited the lowest hardness, followed by CS, CC, and CS-H. Throughout the entire test, no significant differences in enamel wear were observed among CS, CS-H, and CC. However, NC caused lower enamel wear than the other groups, with a more pronounced difference observed after 120,000 chewing cycles. CONCLUSION:  SLM is a promising alternative for manufacturing Co-Cr alloys used in fixed dental prostheses, as it exhibited comparable enamel wear to conventional casting. Moreover, optimized heat treatment enhanced the hardness of SLM-fabricated alloys without increasing enamel wear. However, it is noteworthy that Co-Cr alloys fabricated by any techniques resulted in higher enamel wear than Ni-Cr alloys."

      "abstract": "Hydrochar can generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) via activating molecular oxygen under sunlight. However, whether and how hydrochar generates ROS in the dark and anaerobic environments remains unknown. Herein, we found that combining hydrochar with the co-existing bicarbonate could generate superoxide radicals (O2•-) under alkaline conditions, with the maximum concentration reaching 24.7 μmol L-1. Interestingly, the O2•-generation was not affected by eliminating the molecular oxygen but highly depended on the abundance of the oxygenated functional groups (OFGs) on hydrochar surface. The results of electrochemical analysis, density functional theory calculation, and surface characterization elucidated that the bicarbonate first inner-sphere complexed with surface OFGs, followed by the electron transfer from bicarbonate to OFGs. This enabled the activation of oxygen inside OFGs into active oxygen (O*) while bicarbonate was oxidized to carbonate radical (CO3•-). The CO3•- further reacts with O* through an oxygen transfer mechanism, resulting in the generation of O2•-. The generated O2•- was used for the Cr(VI) treatment, which could efficiently reduce over 95 % into Cr(III). The findings provide a novel pathway for developing hydrochar-based advanced oxidation processes and highlight the potential of hydrochar in pollutant transformation mediated by ROS in dark and anaerobic water environments."

      "abstract": "Industrial wastewater discharge without proper treatment causes severe ecological and public health problems. Heavy metals like chromium are pollutants found in untreated or partially treated industrial wastewater. This study investigates the removal of hexavalent chromium ion (Cr (VI)) from synthetic and tannery wastewater using activated carbon derived from cabbage waste. The cabbage waste was activated with H3PO4 and carbonized at 450 °C. Characterization was performed using proximate analysis, XRD, and FTIR spectroscopy. Batch adsorption studies were conducted under various conditions, including initial chromium concentrations (10-100 mg/L), adsorbent dose (1-20 g/L), contact time (30-300 min), pH (2-11), shaker speed (50-250 rpm), and temperature (20-70 °C). The optimum conditions for maximum chromium removal (99.87%) from synthetic wastewater were pH 3, initial chromium concentration 10 mg/L, shaking speed 150 rpm, contact time 150 min, adsorbent dose 2 g/L, and temperature 25 °C. For tannery wastewater, 83.81% chromium removal was achieved under the same conditions. The Freundlich isotherm model best described the adsorption process, with an adsorption capacity of 4.9 mg/g. The adsorption followed pseudo second order kinetics. The thermodynamics study indicates that the adsorption of Cr (VI) is spontaneous, exothermic and driven by an increase in entropy. A negative value of Gibbs Free Energy change (ΔG°) indicates that the adsorption process is thermodynamically spontaneous and feasible."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: This study was conducted with the aim of evaluating the effect of chromium supplementation on cardiovascular-metabolic risk factors including lipid profile, glycemic index, anthropometric factors, blood pressure and liver function. METHODS: Relevant studies were identified through electronic database searches (PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science) up to March 2024. The overall effect size was calculated using the mean changes and standard deviations for the intervention and control groups. The I2 statistic and Cochran's Q-test were used to determine the existence of heterogeneity. A non-linear modeling explored heterogeneity, dose-response relationships, and the overall impact of Chromium supplementation. RESULTS: Twenty trials, with interventions ranging from 1 to 137 participant were included. Chromium supplementation significantly reduced Fasting blood glucose (FBG) ([WMD]: -1.60 mg/dl; 95 % [CI]: -3.28, 0.07; p = 0.06) and A1C ([WMD]: -0.05 %; 95 % [CI]: -0.19, 0.07; p = 0.38) HOMO-IR ([WMD]: -0.26; 95 % [CI]: 0.48, -0.03; p = 0.02) and insulin ([WMD]: -12.55 pmol/l; 95 % [CI]: -23.62, -1.47; p = 0.02) and a slight decrease in lipid profiles and anthropometric measures. However, there were some factors that Chromium was slightly increased compared to other groups, including: HDL, ALT, Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP) and Diastolic Blood Pressure (DBP). Chromium has no significant effect on AST. CONCLUSION: The results of this experiment show that chromium supplementation had a positive effect on blood sugar control and various factors including weight, BMI, SBP, DBP, triglycerides, and waist circumference, and had an effective role in improving the level of liver enzymes."

      "abstract": "The development of asthma is impacted by fat. Asthma is more common in obese persons. The purpose of the experimental study is to determine how chromium, formoterol, and their combination can improve the quality of life for obese people with lung anomalies. Thirty-six male Wistar rats were divided into six groups: control (C), obesity (CO), obese-asthma (COA), and obese-asthma groups treated with formoterol (OAF), chromium (OACR), or both (OACRF). Except for group C, all groups received a high-fat diet for 4 weeks. Subsequently, ovalbumin (OVA) was administered subcutaneously (s.c.) to all groups except C and CO to induce sensitization. Asthma was triggered via 1% OVA aerosol challenges on days 26-28. Over 5 days, OAF and OACRF received daily formoterol inhalations (50 μg/kg), while OACR and OACRF were given chromium (400 μg/kg). Treatments were timed to align with asthma induction protocols. Lipid profile and inflammatory indicators were examined at the end of the trial-Immunohistochemical analysis of lung tissue, Histopathological and lung tissue stained with Hematoxylin and Eosin. The combination therapy (OACRF) significantly reduced body weight (p < 0.05), lowered LDL and triglycerides, increased HDL, and normalized lung tissue architecture compared to controls. Immunohistochemistry revealed reduced IL-1β and IL-17α expression. The (OACRF) group demonstrated superior asthma control by reducing body weight, improving inflammatory indicators, and restoring lung tissue to its normal state by administering chromium and formoterol therapy. The most effective strategy for treating both obesity and asthma is to address their two connected conditions. These findings demonstrate that combined chromium and formoterol therapy effectively addresses metabolic and inflammatory components of obesity-induced asthma, offering a promising dual-target therapeutic strategy."

      "abstract": "Chromium (Cr) is widely recognized as a carcinogenic metal, and numerous technologies have been studied on a lab scale to manage the pollution caused by Cr contamination in wastewater. However, the removal of Cr presents several challenges and limitations in industrial wastewater management. These issues highlight the ongoing need for research to discover more efficient methods for remediating Cr from wastewater. The proposed review summarizes the current limitations, gaps, and state-of-the-art technologies on Cr removal in industrial wastewater systems over the past 10 years. It aims to lay the groundwork for future research and innovation in Cr remediation for industrial applications. The review emphasizes that conventional physicochemical techniques are often insufficient and highlights the necessity of implementing advanced integrated systems. The limitations related to industrial scaling up are also deeply investigated. Special attention is given to differentiating research conducted at laboratory, pilot, and industrial levels. The findings reveal that limited research has been conducted on an industrial scale, with most investigations focusing on treating tannery and electroplating wastewater. A few studies have also been reported on wastewater from textile, mining, steel mills, pigments, and wood processing. Despite the existence of high-performance systems demonstrated in lab-scale studies, only a handful of treatment techniques have effectively removed Cr at an industrial scale. Nevertheless, innovative breakthroughs in advanced integrated systems show promise for improved performance in the future.",

      "abstract": "This study evaluates mesoporous-hydrochar derived from Acacia falcata leaves via a single-step hydrothermal treatment for Cr(VI) adsorption. Material characterization indicated that the adsorbent has a rough and porous structure. FTIR analysis confirmed Cr(VI) adsorption through functional group interactions, evidenced by peak intensity changes and the emergence of a Cr-O bond vibration at 669 cm-1. Two new peaks were observed in XPS spectra, corresponding to Cr 2p at 577.04 eV (Cr 2p3/2) and 586.67 eV (Cr 2p1/2) after adsorption, further substantiating the adsorption and Cr(VI) reduction. Batch experiments showed an improved adsorption capacity of 30.47 mg/g. Kinetic investigation adhered to the pseudo-second-order model, whereas the equilibrium dataset satisfied the Freundlich model, indicating a heterogeneous adsorption mechanism involving physisorption and chemisorption. The thermodynamic evaluation confirmed spontaneous and endothermic adsorption. Regeneration studies showed reduced Cr(VI) removal performance after four cycles, attributed to pore blockage and loss of functional groups while maintaining effective reuse potential. Spiked studies in various water matrices showed a slight decrease in Cr(VI) removal efficiency, yet it maintained over 95% efficiency, demonstrating its potential for real-world water treatment applications."

      "abstract": "Amid growing global environmental challenges, biomass-derived materials have emerged as sustainable and eco-friendly solutions for industrial pollution. This study developed polyethylenimine (PEI)-functionalized lignin/cellulose beads (PLCBs) as high-performance biosorbents for removing hexavalent chromium (Cr (VI)) from aqueous solutions. The beads were prepared through a two-step process: first, water-soluble carboxymethyl cellulose and lignosulfonate were transformed into stable beads via ion crosslinking; second, the beads were functionalized with PEI to introduce abundant cationic amine groups. Comprehensive characterization confirmed the excellent underwater stability, mechanical robustness, and pH-responsive surface charge of the material. Batch and continuous column experiments demonstrated the exceptional Cr(VI) adsorption performance of the functionalized beads, with a maximum capacity of approximately 326.80 mg·g-1. The removal process is driven by electrostatic attraction, chemical reduction, and chelation, with the beads acting as catalysts to convert toxic Cr(VI) into less toxic Cr(III). The PLCB structure enhances usability, facilitates superior recyclability, and maintains adsorption efficiency over multiple cycles. This study presents an efficient and scalable strategy for producing high-performance biomass-based adsorbents with significant potential for industrial wastewater treatment while offering an additional catalytic function for Cr(VI) detoxification."

      "abstract": "Nano zero-valent iron/nickel (nZVI/Ni) was produced using liquid phase reduction method and characterized by SEM and XRD. In this study, the effect of dose of nZVI/Ni, pH value of acid rain, mixing method of nZVI/Ni by simulating rainfall leaching experiments in the soil column uniformly mixed with nZVI/Ni was studied. The concentration of Cr(VI), pH, conductivity and cumulative release of the leaching solution were measured. The convective dispersion equation model was successfully used to explain the transport behavior of nZVI/Ni in chromium contaminated soil mixed with nZVI/Ni. The speciation of Cr(VI) in the soil after leaching was determined by BCR continuous extraction method. The effect of nZVI/Ni application on the speciation of Cr(VI) in the soil was analyzed. Results showed that the best fixation efficiency was achieved when the nZVI/Ni dosage was 0.10% (w/w%) and pH of the simulated acid rain was 4.5. Pseudo-second-order kinetics characterizes the Cr elimination process better (R2 > 0.99), suggesting that nZVI/Ni predominantly extracts Cr (VI) from polluted soil under acid rain leaching through chemical adsorption/desorption mechanisms. The entire adsorption process included surface diffusion, mesopore diffusion and micropore diffusion. Acid extractable and reduced chromium decreased from 30 to 9%. Oxidizable and residual chromium increased from 70 to 91% in the remediated soil. Cr(VI) in the soil can be reduced Cr (VI) to Cr (III) by nZVI/Ni in the presence of acid rain. The concentrations of Cr leached from the soil by TCLP, SPLP, and SBET methods were 0.11, 0.034 and 0.028 mg/L, which were lower than the standards. There are no obvious differences among the rapeseed stem, root lengths, seed germination rate and clean soil in the remediated soil. nZVI/Ni demonstrated superior treatment of real chromium polluted soil under acid rain. The theoretical foundation and scientific references for treating Cr (VI) polluted soil under acid rain is provided by this study.",

      "abstract": "Chromium (Cr) and cadmium (Cd) are well-known cytotoxic and carcinogenic elements co-existing in the biosphere. Though their separate toxicities have been well researched, little is known about their combined effects, particularly with regard to the cellular stress response. The current study intends to explore the individual and combined toxic effects of Cr and Cd in the brain of Swiss albino mice in addition to examining the possible neuroprotective functions of coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10), biochanin-A (BCA), and phloretin (PHL), the naturally occurring flavonoids with antioxidant qualities. Mice were administered orally with Cr and Cd (75 ppm each) along with the i.p. dose of CoQ10 (10 mg/kg), BCA, and PHL (50 mg/kg each), respectively. After two weeks of treatment, an array of biochemical assays, histopathological examination, and gene expression analyses were carried out to evaluate the underlying mechanisms of the selected nutraceuticals. Our findings, which underscore the importance of this research, demonstrated that the administration of the nutraceuticals reduced oxidative stress and restored the antioxidant defense system by decreasing the levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) and protein carbonyl content (PCC) with concomitant increase in superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione-S-transferase (GST), reduced glutathione (GSH), and total thiol (TT) activity. A decrease in cholinesterase activity was also observed, along with the altered histo-architecture. The qRT-PCR analysis of mRNA expression revealed the upregulation of genes associated with antioxidant defense (SIRT1, Nrf2, HO-1, NQO1) along with the downregulation of the apoptotic markers caspase-8 and 3, respectively. The study highlights the neuroprotective effects of CoQ10, BCA, and PHL against Cr and Cd-induced oxidative stress via enhancing Nrf2-mediated exogenous antioxidant defenses and mitigating cellular damage and neural apoptosis. These results imply that these nutraceuticals may have therapeutic value in alleviating neurological disorders brought on by heavy metal exposure, with potential significant impact on future treatments.",

In this work, the effects of Cr(VI) on anaerobic process and the bio-reduction of Cr(VI) by intracellular and extracellular reductase were investigated. Results showed that the Cr(VI) exposure with concentration >5 mg/L significantly inhibited the anaerobic digestion (e.g., glucose degradation and CH4 production) and reduced the reduction efficiency of Cr(VI). Moreover, the non-enzymatic and enzymatic test on Cr(VI) reduction indicates that enzymatic reduction dominated the transformation of Cr(VI) to Cr(III), occupying 81.6 %-89.3 % of total Cr(VI) reduction. Furthermore, the extracellular enzymatic effect showed a comparable contribution to the intracellular enzymatic effect for Cr(VI) reduction, indicating that the reduction of extracellular enzymes is an important aspect of Cr(VI) reduction. The findings revealed the vital role of extracellular enzymatic reduction in the transformation of Cr(VI), which contributes to clarifying the mechanisms of Cr(VI) reduction through anaerobic biological treatment.",

Results indicated that under 150 mg/kg Cr stress, the AMF-biochar combination significantly increased castor plant fresh weight and soil quality index by 359.70 % and 121.25 %, respectively, compared to treatments without biochar or AMF (P < 0.05). Notably, under Cr stress, the combined treatment significantly increased the relative abundance of Arthrobacter while decreasing that of Streptomyces. Network analysis and community assembly results revealed that AMF and biochar together significantly enhanced soil bacterial network complexity and average niche width. In conclusion, the AMF-biochar combination effectively promoted Ricinus communis growth under Cr stress and regulated rhizosphere soil bacterial community stability and assembly processes, providing valuable insights into plant-microbe interactions under Cr(VI) stress."

      "abstract": "The development of cost-effective wastewater treatment technologies is imperative for heavy metal pollution mitigation, which presents considerable risks to water supplies, ecosystems, and human health. In this context, polyacrylonitrile/polyethylenimine porous microspheres (PAN/PEI PM) were synthesized through a dual-phase strategy combining polymer crystallization and vapor-induced phase separation, leading to effective removal of hexavalent chromium (Cr(VI)) from wastewater. The PAN/PEI PM, characterized by a substantial number of amino groups and a relatively uniform particle size ranging from 1.3 to 1.7 μm, demonstrated commendable thermal stability, a high specific surface area (93.5 m2/g), and a pore volume of 0.7 cm3/g. Furthermore, the PAN/PEI PM exhibited a significantly enhanced Cr(VI) adsorption efficiency, achieving levels of up to 194.5 mg/g. Even after five cycles, they consistently maintained a removal efficiency exceeding 64%, with an adsorption capacity still reaching 125.6 mg/g. The adsorption isotherm and kinetics were found to correlate well with the Langmuir and pseudo-second-order models, respectively. Adsorption experiments demonstrated that the porous microspheres effectively remove Cr(VI) primarily through complexation and electrostatic interactions, which is attributed to the elevated concentration of ionizable functional amino groups (NH2) within the microsphere structure. Additionally, the redox processes are predominantly reliant on the reduction of adsorbed Cr(VI) to Cr(III). These findings underscore the favorable adsorption characteristics and reusability of PAN/PEI PM, offering valuable insights for the development of more effective and sustainable strategies for Cr(VI) removal from wastewater."

      "abstract": "A metal-free heterojunction (CNZ8C) photocatalyst prepared using g-C3N5 (CN) and zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF)-derived carbon (Z8C) is reported for sequential reduction and elimination of toxic Cr (VI) from water. Recombination of photogenerated charge carriers in CN was evicted completely through heterojunction formation of CN with Z8C. This is evidenced from the transient photocurrent responses (TPR), photoluminescence (PL) measurements and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The band structure analysis from the valence band X-ray spectroscopy and diffused reflectance spectroscopy revealed that the synergy in the synthesized CN-Z8C heterojunction is responsible for the reduction of CN band gap. The experimental results obtained confirm that the positions of the valence and conduction bands are aligned to more negative values facilitating the Cr (VI) reduction. Incorporation of the highly conducting porous CZ8 to CN improves the charge separation and also brings the Cr (VI) ions close to CZ8 surface via adsorption, which together favors the overall reduction and removal of reduced ions. The rate of reduction/removal significantly increased with CNZ8C 5:5 (with nearly 100 % removal efficiency) heterojunction compared to that of CN. This heterojunction can be reutilized up to 5 cycles without any significant loss in efficiency. Mechanistic studies revealed that proper bandgap engineering leads to increased reduction and removal of chromium. The post treatment X-ray photoelectrons spectroscopy of the heterojunction confirms the +3 state of chromium. These observations suggest that the successful synergy between the CN and Z8C will bring new insights into chromium remediation."

However, achieving the simultaneous removal of P, Cr(VI), and Sb(V) remains challenging, and the interactions among these pollutants are not well understood. We investigated electrocoagulation as a method for the simultaneous removal of these pollutants, utilizing response surface methodology to optimize operating parameters. All pollutants were removed completely under optimal conditions: an initial pH of 3.0, current density of 32.43 A/m², NaCl concentration of 8.0 g/L, and reaction time of 20 minutes, with an energy consumption of 0.187 kWh/m³ -significantly lower than most reported values. The direct precipitation of FePO₄ and the adsorptive co-precipitation of Fe(OH)₃ synergistically contributed to P removal. The presence of Cr(VI) and Sb(V) accelerated Fe(OH)₃ floc agglomeration by oxidizing Fe2 + to Fe3+ and enhancing Fe utilization, respectively, thereby improving P removal efficiency. Internal adsorption co-precipitation by Fe(OH)₃ was the dominant mechanism for Cr(VI) and Sb(V) removal, accounting for 89.97 % and 66.90 %, respectively. However, the presence of P inhibited Cr(VI) and Sb(V) removal by reducing Fe(OH)₃ floc formation due to competition with Fe³ ⁺. These findings elucidate the simultaneous removal mechanisms and mutual interactions of P, Cr(VI), and Sb(V), offering valuable insights for the treatment of textile dye wastewater."

      "abstract": "Hexavalent chromium (Cr(VI)) is one of the most rigorously regulated contaminants frequently detected in surface and groundwater. Magnetic iron sulfides are naturally abundant, environmentally friendly materials ideal for the removal of Cr(VI) from contaminated water, but the high-spin states of Fe(III) ions limits their adsorption affinity. Herein, we develop a heteroatom-doping approach to boost the Cr(VI) removal efficacy of greigite. Compared to pristine greigite, cobalt doping significantly enhances the capability of greigite to adsorption Cr(VI) by decreasing electron occupancy in the eg orbitals and reducing the spin state of Fe ions. With a combination of electrochemical characterizations and theoretical calculations, we confirm that cobalt doping significantly enhances its reduction capacity toward Cr(VI) by elevating the d-band center and increasing electron transfer rate. We corroborate the finding by showing that Cu-doping, which has the opposite effects on d-orbital electron configures, compromises the efficacy of greigite. Of note, the magnetic properties of greigite remain largely unaffected upon heteroatom doping, allowing easy separation and recovery of the materials from the aqueous solutions. This work provides valuable mechanistic insights for nanomaterial design in contaminant removal and may inform the development of nanotechnology for green remediation of contaminated sites."

      "abstract": "Chromium (Cr) is a highly toxic heavy metal that can negatively impact crop yield and food quality by causing chlorosis and reduced root and shoot growth. To address this issue, rhizobacteria has emerged as a viable and safe technology. Additionally, gibberellins (GA3) can act as allied factors for regulating various physiological processes in plants, particularly cell division and elongation under Cr stress. That's why the current study aimed to investigate the individual and combined effects of gibberellic acid (GA3) application and biofertilizer (Agrobacterium fabrum) in alleviating chromium toxicity in wheat. The treatments included two concentrations of chromium (Cr): 300Cr (300 mg Cr/kg soil) and 600Cr (600 mg Cr/kg soil), as well as the application of gibberellic acid (GA3 = 5 mg/L solution) with and without biofertilizer, i.e., A. fabrum. Results showed that the addition of GA3 + A. fabrum showed a significant increase in shoot fresh weight (~ 13%), shoot dry weight (~ 90%), root fresh weight (~ 76%), root dry weight (~ 88%), root length (~ 39%), shoot length (~ 18%) over control (no GA3 and No A. fabrum). In conclusion, GA3 + A. Farum is a better treatment for mitigating Cr toxicity in soil. More investigations are suggested at field levels under different cereal crops to declare GA3 + A. fabrum as the best treatment for alleviating Cr adverse effects on crops. Future research should focus on field-level investigations across cereal crops to validate GA3 + A. fabrum as the best treatment for alleviating Cr adverse effects on different crops and exploring its potential for integration into sustainable agricultural practices.",

      "abstract": "Metals have been used for many centuries, but their nutritional and toxic effects have been investigated since the last century. The common toxic heavy metals (THM) include mercury, lead, chromium cadmium, and arsenic. As human exposure to THM increasingly causes systemic and organ complications, it seems required to review the recent advances of treatment of the toxic metals. Despite the current knowledge of the hazards of heavy metals, there is still high incidents of their poisonings particularly in developing countries. In this review, after an introduction, we briefly describe the routes of exposure, clinical features and prognosis of each metal poisoning. Then, review the different treatments for each metal with particular attention to recent advances in the treatment of both acute and chronic poisonings. The main antidotes for all THM are still chelating agents, but new agents were developed over the past decades and have been used successfully for the THM poisonings. Dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) known as succimer has been prescribed as a safe oral chelator in lead poisoning. Similarly, dimercapto-propanesulfonic acid (DMPS) has also revealed fewer side effects than the old chelating agents. The two are currently gaining increased acceptance among clinical toxicologists. However, there is no specific antidote for mercury poisoning. Dimercaprol is almost no longer used as an antidote of choice in the treatment of chronic THM poisoning. Comparison of clinical management of intoxication by the five heavy metals reveals similar treatment strategies. On the other hand, some of them require specific interventions to reduce the toxicity. Because of drawbacks in the application of commonly known chelating agents, treatment with bioactive compounds which have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties has been the subject of much interest in recent research. However, despite the promising results observed in experimental animals, clinical trials on their clinical therapeutic benefits have not been yet successful and need further studies to determine their efficacy and safety in humans. Development of less toxic chelating agents are still under investigations. Moreover, the development of orally administrable chelating agents for home health care would likely be of great interest for future research."

      "abstract": "Toxic heavy metal chromium (Cr) poses significant risks to crop yields and human health through contamination of the food chain. Dopamine, a naturally occurring bioactive amine, can enhance plant tolerance to various abiotic stresses; however, its specific role in Cr stress tolerance and the associated molecular mechanisms remain largely unexplored. In this study, we demonstrate that root application of dopamine effectively mitigates Cr stress in tomato plants. Cr stress was found to decrease chlorophyll content, maximum photochemical efficiency, shoot growth, and biomass accumulation, while simultaneously increasing reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation, lipid peroxidation, and electrolyte leakage. Exogenous dopamine application significantly reduced excessive ROS accumulation and malondialdehyde levels, thereby alleviating oxidative stress. This was achieved through the enhancement of antioxidant enzyme activity, increased glutathione and phytochelatin contents, and the upregulation of the expression of respective encoding genes, including Cu-Zn SOD, POD, CAT1, APX, GR1, GSH2, and PCS. Additionally, dopamine treatment induced the expression of RBOH1 and reduced Cr content. Notably, exogenous H2O2 application also improved Cr tolerance, but the application of diphenyleneiodonium, an NADPH oxidase inhibitor, exacerbated Cr phytotoxicity and diminished the beneficial effects of dopamine on plant tolerance to Cr stress. These findings suggest that dopamine-induced H2O2 signaling plays a crucial role in enhancing Cr tolerance. This study elucidates a fundamental mechanism underlying dopamine-mediated Cr tolerance and expands our understanding of the stress resistance properties of dopamine in plants.",

Consequently, developing efficient and cost-effective photocatalysts for degrading Cr(VI) has emerged as a promising approach to environmental remediation. In this study, two novel cellulose-based photocatalytic hydrogel materials, designated CF and CFS, were synthesized by cross-linking varying concentrations of Fe(III) and Fe(III) + sodium citrate (SC) with sodium carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC), marking their first application in the photocatalytic reduction of Cr(VI) in aquatic environments. Photocatalytic degradation experiments revealed that the Fe(III) concentration was 0.3 M with a Fe(III): SC molar ratio of 2:1, 150 mg/L Cr(VI) could be 100 % degraded within 90 min. The microscopic structure and chemical properties of photocatalysts were thoroughly characterized, and the results confirmed the successful cross-linking of CMC with Fe(III) and Fe(III) + SC. Optical and electrochemical tests indicated that CFS exhibited a broader visible-light absorption range, a narrower band gap, and significantly improved separation and transfer of photogenerated carriers. Furthermore, CFS had a highly photochemically active Fe(III)-SC complex, which established a Fe(III)/Fe(II) cycling process via the metal-ligand-charge transfer (MLCT) pathway, leading to the rapid degradation of Cr(VI). CF and CFS still had good stability and reusability after five cycles. Therefore, this study provides an approach for removing Cr(VI) contaminants.",

Research has highlighted a strong correlation between Cr (VI) exposure through drinking water and increased cancer rates, particularly in near chrome industries. Our previous research demonstrated that chronic low-dose Cr (VI) exposure (2, 5 and 10 ppm) via drinking water stimulated hepatotoxicity in Swiss albino mice. In this study, we investigated the effects of the same doses over 4 and 8 months on the brain and kidney tissues of Swiss albino mice. It was found that oxidative stress markers, including catalase activity, malondialdehyde (MDA) and reduced glutathione (GSH) levels, were significantly elevated in both the tissues post-treatment. Prolonged exposure to Cr (VI) led to DNA fragmentation and a reduced organo-somatic index in the affected tissues. Additionally, histoarchitectural alterations were observed in the brain and kidney. Apoptotic gene expression was significantly upregulated after 8 months of exposure, confirmed by immunohistochemical studies indicating apoptosis. DNA repair genes (Rad51, Mutyh, Ogg1, and Mlh1) and genes coding enzymes regulating epigenetics (Sirt1, Dnmt1, Kdm1a, and Ezh2) showed significantly varied expression patterns compared to control. Methylation-specific PCR revealed DNA hypermethylation as a factor in the transcriptional reduction of specific DNA repair genes in these tissues. This study denotes that long-term low-dose Cr (VI) exposure not only surges oxidative stress and changes histoarchitecture and gene expression but also results in epigenetic modifications via DNA hypermethylation, impacting organs like the brain and kidney."

Batch experiments demonstrate chromite formation at pH above 7 and Fe(III)/Cr(III) ratios exceeding 1, with Fe(III) occupying all tetrahedral sites, essential for stability.

To tackle the complexities of non-point source Cr pollution, we employ microbial methods to regulate on-site Eh and pH, optimizing chromite precipitation. Long-term stability tests confirm that chromite remained stable for over 180 days, with potential for magnetic separation recovery.

Cellulose was extracted from banana peduncle, a biomass waste that remains largely underutilized. The addition of GO aims to increase the adsorption properties. The aerogel adsorbents were synthesized by varying the ultrasonication time to 45 min for CNF 45 and 60 min for CNF 60, and the amount of GO added to 1 mL and 2 mL. The aerogel adsorbents were successfully prepared using the freeze-drying method with CNF45, CNF60, CNF45/GO1, CNF45/GO2, CNF60/GO1, and CNF60/GO2 variations. CNF was successfully isolated from a banana peduncle with an average diameter of 44.16 nm for 45 min (CNF 45) and an average diameter of 14.6 nm for 60 min (CNF 60) of ultrasonication. Chemical treatment and ultrasonication reduced the crystallinity index value of cellulose by 73% and 61% for CNF 45 and CNF 60, respectively. CNF aerogel has a very low shrinkage rate (<7%), resulting in a larger surface area. CNF60/GO2 obtained the optimum adsorption ability for Pb(II) metal at a concentration of 100 ppm and 27.27 mg/g at 30 min. On the other hand, the adsorption ability of Cr(VI) metal was obtained by CNF60/GO2 at a concentration of 100 ppm and 13.48 mg/g at 30 min. SEM images show that all aerogel adsorbents are porous, with a porosity value range of 96-98%. In conclusion, CNF60/GO2 proved to be the most effective aerogel adsorbent, offering the potential for heavy metal removal from industrial wastewater."

Furthermore, the SCG material demonstrated good pH adaptability (It can still remove 84 % of Cr(VI) at pH = 7) and practical applicability. Comparative experiments and DFT calculation results showed that the introduction of GA not only helped form a more compact network structure but also interacted synergistically with CS, significantly promoting the removal of Cr(VI).

      "abstract": "The intensifying global warming may increase the impact of heat stress on the dairy industry. Our previous study showed that chromium yeast (CY) alleviated the negative effects of heat stress and improved the lactation performance by increasing milk protein content and yield in mid-lactation dairy cows. This study further investigated whether the increased milk protein after CY supplementation results from the promotion of microbial crude protein (MCP) synthesis by regulating rumen microorganisms and amino acid metabolites. Twelve heat-stressed dairy cows were divided into two treatment groups: one with CY supplementation (0.36 mg Cr/kg DM) and the other without CY supplementation. Samples were collected after eight weeks of formal experiment in a hot summer with the mean temperature-humidity index of 79.0 ± 3.13. Dietary CY supplementation did not affect rumen pH, total volatile fatty acid, acetate, propionate, isobutyrate, butyrate, isovalerate, and valerate, but increased ruminal MCP concentration (P < 0.05). Simultaneously, the alpha or beta diversity of rumen microbial bacteria were not influenced by CY supplementation. At genus level, supplementation with CY increased the relative abundances of Olsenella, Lachnospiraceae _UCG-002, and Shuttleworthia (P < 0.05) and decreased those of Enterobacter, Escherichia-Shigella, Oribacterium, and Bacteroidetes_BD2-2 (P < 0.05). There were 17 up-regulated and 57 down-regulated differential metabolites in the CON and CY groups. The partial least-squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) and orthogonal partial least-squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) scores clearly distinguished the two groups. Chromium yeast supplementation reduced the concentrations of D-(+)-proline, DL-glutamic acid, DL-lysine, Gly-l-pro, L-(-)-serine, L-(+)-alanine, and L-(+)-aspartic acid (P < 0.05) in the ruminal fluid, which were involved in arginine biosynthesis (P = 0.029), glutathione metabolism (P = 0.047), lysine degradation (P = 0.069), and D-amino acid metabolism (P = 0.084). Spearman correlation analysis showed that milk protein content was positively correlated with MCP and negatively correlated with amino acid concentrations in the ruminal fluid (P < 0.05). Collectively, CY supplementation promoted the utilization of amino acids by rumen microorganisms to synthesize MCP, thereby increasing milk protein content and yield in heat-stressed dairy cows."

The composite film (GA-CS-ZEO) characterization by using various analytical techniques confirms its successful production with promising physical, chemical, and thermal properties. The use of the response surface methodology (RSM) for the optimization of the Cr(VI) adsorption by this composite shows that that the maximum removal efficiency (82.39%) was achieved for a Cr(VI) concentration of 50 mg L-1, an initial pH of 2.0, a contact time of 100 min, and a temperature of 20 °C. Moreover, the analysis of variance (ANOVA) and 3D graphs indicated that the pH and initial Cr(VI) concentration were the main factors that influence the Cr(VI) uptake efficiency. Besides that, the Cr(VI) removal by the GA-CS-ZEO was found to be spontaneous and endothermic and occurs mainly via physical mechanisms involving electrostatic interactions and hydrogen bonding. Regeneration study of the Cr(VI)-loaded composite showed that Cr(VI) can be rapidly and efficiently desorbed by 0.1 M sulfuric acid. The results of the current research work highlight the important adsorption potential of Cr(VI) by the GA-CS-ZEO composite film and underscore its attractiveness and suitability for water treatment applications."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: One of the primary challenges that the expanding population faces is water scarcity. Thus, a global imperative has been established to safeguard extant water resources and optimize their utility through sustainable practices and efficient management. In the present investigation, Azolla pinnata, a pteridophyte (fern), was employed to phytoremediate Cr (VI) from chromium-polluted water. The potential of this treated water for agricultural purposes was verified through the use of Vicia faba plants. RESULTS: In vitro, A. pinnata effectively remediates Cr (VI) from an array of liquid concentrations (0.05 to 90 ppm) in a ratio of 25:1 {volume (mL): fresh weight of Azolla (g)} after 2 days incubation period at room temperature. At low concentrations (0.1 ppm), the phytoremediation capacity peaked at 70%, falling to 19.53% at a high concentration (90 ppm). Upon continuous irrigation with Cr-polluted water (0.05 to 50 ppm), the in vivo pot experiment on Vicia faba plants revealed high Cr accumulation in the roots reached 52.5 mg Kg-1 dry weight (Dwt) at the 50 ppm Cr treatment. Nevertheless, a reduced Cr content of 19.5 mg Kg-1 Dwt was observed when the plants were irrigated with 50 ppm Cr-polluted water that had been treated with Azolla. At 50 ppm of Cr, Azolla's treatment significantly increased shoot length, fresh weight, and Chl a content to 25.25 cm, 3.4 g, and 6.5 mg g-1 Dwt, respectively, up from 10.25, 1.8, and 4.7 in untreated plants. The chromosomal aberrations were significantly induced in the dividing cells of all Cr treatments, with the highest value of 4.8% at 50 ppm. This value was reduced to 2.88% at the same concentration when treated with Azolla. At a concentration of 10 ppm Cr, the mitotic index was significantly improved to 6.99% when combined with Azolla, as opposed to 3.63% when the same concentration was used without Azolla. The DNA degradation assay showed partial DNA degradation at 50 ppm Cr, which the Azolla treatment eliminated. Furthermore, the gene expression levels of both the PM H+-ATPase and the calcium-dependent protein kinase CDPK5 were upregulated in response to Cr, despite the fact that the expression level was altered in a dose- and concentration-dependent manner by Azolla treatment. CONCLUSION: Azolla exhibits substantial potential for reducing the detrimental effects of chromium stress including oxidative stress on plants. It modulates stress-related gene expression, protects DNA integrity, enhances cell mitosis, and reduces chromosomal damage. These results indicate that Azolla has the potential to be a valuable asset in phytoremediation strategies for chromium-contaminated environments, and that it may enhance plant survival and growth under Cr stress conditions. KEY MESSAGE: Azolla pinnata can be effectively utilized as an environmentally-friendly method to remediate chromium-contaminated water for agricultural usage.",

      "abstract": "Cadmium is one of the most hazardous heavy metal contaminants, and it is usually abundant in the wastewater released from paint and pigment industries. Such effluents urgently need to be treated before their proper reuse for various industrial and agricultural purposes. Therefore, in this study, the process of Cd(ii) ion adsorption from waste aqueous-solutions was investigated using polystyrene (PS), ethanolamine-modified polystyrene (EA-PS), and chromium hydroxide-impregnated ethanolamine-modified polystyrene (Cr@EA-PS) as new effective sorbents. The structural and textual properties as well as the surface charges and particle sizes of the prepared sorbents were examined using Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), N2 adsorption-desorption surface area analysis, X-ray diffraction (XRD), dynamic light scattering (DLS) and zeta potential analysis. Herein, correlations between different features of the three adsorbents and their impacts on adsorption efficiency were extensively investigated. Adsorption kinetics and isotherm studies were also conducted to evaluate the sorption mechanisms and the achieved capacities of the presented adsorbents. Results showed that surface functionalization with ethanol amine particles significantly improved adsorption capacity owing to the introduction of amino groups, providing further interactions with heavy metal species. Moreover, the subsequent impregnation of Cr(OH)3 into the EA-PS structure could successively enhance surface properties and porosity, leading to observation of the highest adsorption capacity (13.6 mg g-1 for Cr@EA-PS). Such increased adsorption capacity is nearly 10-fold higher than the reported capacity of PS. Kinetic studies revealed that the adsorption process followed a pseudo-second-order model, indicating chemisorption as the primary adsorption mechanism. Isotherm analysis confirmed a favorable monolayer adsorption process exhibited by the three structures. The combination of chemical bonding and physical adsorption mechanisms was observed for Cr@EA-PS, explaining its performance superiority in removing Cd(ii) ions. Thus, the inorganic-organic composite exhibits the highest potential among the three introduced sorbents for practical applications in the field of wastewater treatment."

In this study, we explore the anti-inflammatory and antioxidant potential of a trace element complex, Chromium-D-phenylalanine (Cr(D-Phe)₃), through in vivo and in silico approaches. Anti-inflammatory activity was assessed using a carrageenan-induced paw oedema model in rats, coupled with histopathological and biochemical analyses. The antioxidant effects of Cr(D-Phe)₃ were evaluated by measuring reduced glutathione (GSH), lipid peroxidation (LPO), and tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) as a marker of inflammation. Furthermore, molecular docking and dynamics simulations were conducted to elucidate the compound's binding affinity and stability with cyclooxygenase enzymes. Cr(D-Phe)₃ exhibited significant anti-inflammatory activity, with the 40 μg/kg dose achieving 34.40% (p < 0.001) oedema inhibition, comparable to diclofenac sodium (42.40%). Treatment with Cr(D-Phe)₃ restored GSH levels (+ 62.10%, p < 0.001), reduced LPO (24.72%, p < 0.001), and lowered TNF-α (31.73%, p < 0.001) in carrageenan injected rats, demonstrating potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. Molecular docking revealed strong binding affinities between Cr(D-Phe)₃ and COX enzymes, suggesting its potential mechanism of action in modulating inflammatory pathways. This study highlights the potential of Cr(D-Phe)₃ as a chromium-based trace element complex with anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. These findings warrant further preclinical investigations to elucidate its full pharmacological potential and applications in managing inflammatory conditions."

      "abstract": "This study reports a new form of nitrogen-doped activated carbon (AC5-600) produced from a blend of sawdust (SD) and fish waste (FW) treated with urea and ZnCl2 for the adsorption of toxic metals and dyes. The adsorbent was also explored in the treatment of acid brown 14 (AB14) and acid orange 7 (AO7) dye molecules and hexavalent chromium (Cr6+) ions. The pH controls the sorption of individual contaminants, with an observed superlative % of individual contaminants removed at pH 1.5. Removal at pH was credited to the electrostatic interaction (EI) between the anion dyes and Cr6+ species at this pH and the protonated sites accessible on the AC5-600 adsorbent surface. Based on the error values obtained from the non-linear modelling (NLM) of the kinetic and isotherm models, the Elovich (ELM-AB14 and Cr6+), pseudo-first- (PFOM-AB14) and second-order models (PSOM-AB14, AO7 and Cr6+) and the Freundlich (FRHM) model were found to ideally define the sorption of the various contaminants. The determined maximum sorption capacity (Qm) based on the NLM was 1114, 1929 and 318 mg.g-1 for AB14 dye, AO7 dye and Cr6+ ions, respectively. Based on the computational adsorption calculations, the sorption energies for the AO7 and AB14 dyes were -4.492 and -8.090 eV and 2.563, 1.789, 1.226 and 1.928 eV for Cr2, CrO3, CrO4, and CrO4H species. AB14 and AO7 dyes and Cr6+ ions adsorption to synthesised AC5-600 was predicted employing the response surface methodology (RSM) and artificial neural network (ANN) models. The ANN model was more effective in predicting AB14 and AO7 dyes and Cr6+ ions adsorption than the RSM, and it was highly applicable in the sorption process."

Male Hsd:ICR mice were divided into 4 groups: (1) Control (vehicle only), (2) P60-GT (15, 30, or 45 mg/kg gavage), (3) Cr(VI) (20 mg/kg of CrO3 intraperitoneally), and (4) P60-GT+CrO3 (P60-GT administered 4 hr before CrO3). Peripheral blood samples were collected at 24, 48, and 72 hr to assess the number of micronuclei (MN), apoptosis, and cell viability, while plasma 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) levels were measured at 0 and 48 hr. Cr(VI) significantly increased MN frequency, suppressed 8-OHdG repair, and reduced cell viability. Pre-treatment with P60-GT reduced MN frequency by up to 74%, with the 30 mg/kg dose demonstrating the highest efficacy. This dose restored cell viability, enhanced 8-OHdG repair, and enhanced apoptosis, suggesting activation of DNA repair and apoptotic pathways as potential antigenotoxic mechanisms. The 15 mg/kg dose exhibited anti-apoptotic effects, while the 30 and 45 mg/kg doses promoted apoptosis. However, the 45 mg/kg dose resulted in 100% lethality by 72 hr, likely due to synergistic toxicity with Cr(VI). These findings demonstrate the dose-dependent protective effects of P60-GT and emphasize the need for dosage optimization to maximize therapeutic benefits while minimizing toxicity.",

      "abstract": "Co-pyrolysis is an efficient approach for municipal sewage sludge (SS) treatment, facilitating the production of biochar and promoting the stabilization and removal of heavy metals, particularly when combined with chlorinated materials. This study explores the impact of pyrolysis temperatures (400 °C and 600 °C) and chlorinated additives (polyvinyl chloride (PVC) as an organic chloride source and ferric chloride (FeCl3) as an inorganic chloride source) at 10% and 20% concentrations, on the yield, chemical speciation, leachability, and ecological risks of arsenic (As), chromium (Cr), and zinc (Zn) in biochar derived from SS. The results revealed that increasing the pyrolysis temperature from 400 to 600 °C significantly reduced biochar yield due to enhanced volatilization of organic components, as well as the removal of heavy metals in interaction with chlorinated materials. Chlorinated additives distinctly influenced heavy metal behavior. PVC treatments at 600 °C effectively reduced the total concentrations of As and Zn by 60% and 88.3%, respectively, while FeCl3 reduced Cr concentrations by up to 72.5%. Chemical speciation analysis showed that PVC treatments increased the residual fractions of As and Zn, reducing their bioavailability and environmental risk. In contrast, FeCl3 promoted the transformation of Cr into oxidizable fractions, enhancing its stability. TCLP results confirmed the effectiveness of both additives in reducing heavy metal leachability, with PVC at 600 °C demonstrating superior performance for As and Zn, and FeCl3 excelling in Cr stabilization. Ecological risk index assessments revealed that PVC treatments consistently resulted in lower RI values at both temperatures and concentrations, keeping them below the low-risk threshold. In contrast, FeCl3 treatments exhibited elevated risk levels, especially at higher concentrations and temperatures, reaching moderate to considerable risk categories. Overall, PVC treatment at 600 °C proved to be the most effective strategy for reducing As and Zn leachability and enhancing biochar stability. While FeCl3 demonstrated better performance in Cr stabilization, these findings highlight the importance of selecting appropriate chlorinated additives based on the target heavy metal for optimizing biochar production and minimizing environmental impacts effectively.",

During the fresh period (FR; 1-24 DIM), cows were fed 1 of 4 treatments: (1) a diet containing no supplemental C16:0 or Cr (CON); (2) diet supplemented with an 85% C16:0-enriched supplement (PA); (3) diet supplemented with Cr-propionate (CR); or (4) diet supplemented with a C16:0-enriched supplement and Cr-propionate (PACR). The C16:0-enriched supplement was added at 1.5% of diet DM by replacing soyhulls in the C16:0-supplemented diets, and the Cr-propionate supplement (0.45 mg Cr/kg of diet DM) was administered through the vitamin and mineral mix. During the carryover period (CO; 25-56 DIM), a common diet was offered to all cows to evaluate the carryover effects of the treatment diets. Palmitic acid and Cr supplementation interacted with time during the treatment period, with the supplemented diets increasing the yields of ECM, 3.5% FCM, and milk fat to a greater extent during the first 2 weeks of lactation compared with CON. By the third week of lactation, C16:0-supplemented diets also increased milk fat yield compared with CR. Additionally, C16:0 and Cr interacted with time in the treatment period to influence plasma insulin, nonesterified fatty acid, and BHB. Overall, C16:0 supplementation increased the yields of milk fat, ECM, and 3.5% FCM, and decreased milk protein content in the treatment period. Overall, Cr supplementation increased the yields of milk, milk protein, and milk lactose in the treatment period. Additionally, Cr supplementation interacted with time, increasing the yields of milk, milk protein, and milk lactose during the CO period. We did not observe treatment differences for DMI and plasma glucose during the FR period, and no treatment effects on BW, BW change, or BCS change in FR or CO periods. In conclusion, C16:0 and Cr supplementation interacted during the early postpartum period to influence milk production responses compared with a nonsupplemented diet. Feeding Cr during the immediate postpartum had a carryover effect, improving milk production responses after ceasing feeding of the treatment diets.",

The concentration of Cr6+ in the water was 10 mg/L, and the dosage of MTB was 10 mg/L. Results show that the transmembrane pressure of the ultrafiltration membrane decreased by 5 kPa following the application of a magnetic field of 33.71 mT for a period of 90 min, and the membrane fouling could therefore be effectively controlled. With the addition of MTB, the average removal of Cr6+ from water by the ultrafiltration system was 20.10%, which was 14.56% higher than that of the conventional ultrafiltration system. The average removal of chromaticity was 20.13%, which was 10% higher than that achieved by the conventional ultrafiltration system. Furthermore, MTB progressively developed into the predominant flora during the operational phase, thereby enhancing the efficiency of the ultrafiltration system.",

      "abstract": "Maize (Zea mays L.) faces significant challenges to its growth and productivity from heavy metal stress, particularly Chromium (Cr) stress, which induces reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and damages photosynthetic tissues. This study aimed to investigate the effects of fulvic acid (FA) application, via foliar spray or root irrigation, on mitigating chromium stress in maize by evaluating its impact on antioxidant activity and growth parameters. Two maize varieties, P3939 and 30Y87, were subjected to chromium stress (CrCl3·6H2O) at concentrations of 300 µM and 100 µM for a duration of 5 weeks. The experiment was conducted in a wire house under natural environmental conditions at the Seed Centre, Institute of Botany, University of the Punjab, Lahore, Pakistan. Physiological assessments included electrolyte leakage, chlorophyll pigment content, malondialdehyde (MDA) levels, and activities of antioxidant enzymes such as catalase (CAT), ascorbate peroxidase (APX), and guaiacol peroxidase (GPX) in maize leaves. Growth parameters were also monitored. The results revealed that chromium stress significantly reduced chlorophyll content and increased oxidative stress, as evidenced by elevated MDA levels and electrolyte leakage. However, FA application notably mitigated these effects: chlorophyll content improved by 15%, and MDA levels decreased significantly. Irrigation with FA was particularly effective, reducing MDA levels by 40% compared to the 300 µM chromium treatment. Furthermore, while chromium stress enhanced antioxidant enzyme activities, FA application further boosted total soluble protein levels and antioxidant enzyme activities under stress conditions. In conclusion, FA application demonstrates potential in improving maize tolerance to heavy metal stress by enhancing the antioxidant defense system and preserving photosynthetic pigments. These findings highlight FA's promise as a practical strategy for mitigating the negative impacts of chromium stress on maize, promoting sustainable agricultural practices in contaminated environments.",

One hundred specimens (N = 100), prepared with the dimensions of 25 × 3 × 0.5 mm3, were assigned to five groups (n = 20): presintered milled Co-Cr (Group M), additively manufactured Co-Cr (Group SLM), cast Co-Cr (Group C), presintered zirconia (Group Zi), and cast Ni-Cr (Group Ni). The bar specimens were prepared to receive porcelain on their central area (8 × 3 mm2) of one side of each alloy strip. Only half of the specimens from each group were exposed to thermocycling (5°C-55°C for 5000 times). All specimens were placed in a bending device. Specimen surface morphology was examined by scanning electron microscopy. The bonding values between materials and the aging treatment effect groups were compared with two-way ANOVA. Variances were compared using the Levene test, the Bonferroni adjustment was used for multiple pairwise comparisons. The shape (m) and scale (σ0) parameters of the two-parameter Weibull distribution values were calculated. Thermocycling did not affect the results of all the groups tested (p = 0.237). Statistical difference was found between the Co-Cr groups, and between groups Ni and Zi when compared to groups C and SLM (p < 0.001). Ni had the lowest adhesion values and cast Co-Cr the highest. A statistical difference was found between the three Co-Cr groups (p < 0.001), with the highest ceramic adhesion found in Group C and the lowest found in Group M. All specimens from Groups M, C, and Ni showed adhesive failures, whereas mixed failures were observed in Groups Zi and SLM. The fit of the maximum-likelihood line was a poor fit in the distribution of the aged SLM group (p < 0.010). Ceramic adhesion and failure types varied with the alloy choice and the manufacturing technique.",

Bioremediation utilizes specific microbes capable of transforming Cr(VI) into the less toxic Cr(III), however, microbial efficacy can be inhibited by elevated pollutant concentrations and competition from indigenous microbial communities. Thus, this study explored the potential of single and multi-domain microbial consortia encapsulated in alginate to overcome these shortcomings. The results revealed that (i) fungal treatments demonstrated an elevated tolerance and reduction ability for Cr(VI) compared to bacterial treatments; (ii) combined application of fungi and bacteria was more effective in degrading Cr(VI) in soil compared to the individual treatments; (iii) microbial encapsulation improved microbial response to Cr(VI) toxicity thereby increasing their lifespan and Cr(VI) degrading ability; (iv) microbial consortia significantly decreased soil pH, electrical conductivity, and redox potential while simultaneously increasing soil enzyme activities (urease, sucrase, phosphatase, catalase, and laccase); and (v) The improved tolerance in the inoculated treatment resulted in increased microbial diversity and a substantial variation in microbial community structures, with 10,753 bacterial and 2697 fungal amplicon sequence variants identified across the treatment groups. This study underscores the critical importance of microbial diversity in bioremediation, emphasizing that encapsulation with the right material could improve the effectiveness of environmental remediation strategies.",

The physicochemical properties of the novel photocatalyst were verified using characterization techniques such as XRD, FT-IR, FE-SEM, EDS mapping, N2 adsorption-desorption, VSM, PL, and UV-Vis DRS. The CZZ photocatalyst exhibited a significant Cr (VI) reduction rate of 0.1535 min-1, which was 9.27, 5.37 and 3.58 times higher than those of single ZnFe2O4 nanoparticles (0.0166 min-1), CoFe2O4 nanoparticles (0.0286 min-1), and CoFe2O4-ZnFe2O4 (0.0428 min-1) respectively. CZZ showed an excellent reusability after three consecutive cycles of Cr(VI) reduction. The results from the experiments in different aqueous environments displayed that CZZ could be a promising photocatalyst to reduce Cr(VI) in the treatment of actual aqueous matrices. The present study not only provides a highly active catalytic system for the practical removal of Cr(VI) but also paves the way for the fabrication of high-performance heterojunction photocatalysts."

High rhizospheric Cr concentrations inhibit nutrients uptake and their translocation to aboveground parts, thus can affect the growth and development of crop plants. This experiment was designed to evaluate the effects of sole and combined zinc-lysine and iron-lysine applications on photosynthetic efficacy, antioxidative defense, oxidative stress, and nutrient uptake and translocation under Cr stress. Chromium stress exhibited toxic effects on the growth, physiological, and biochemical indices of pearl millet. The combined application of zinc-lysine and iron-lysine significantly decreased malondialdehyde (MDA; 25%) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2; 22.44%), while increased superoxide dismutase (SOD; 19.75%), catalase (CAT; 26.16%), peroxidase (POD; 19.62%), and ascorbate peroxidase (APX; 23.52%) activities under Cr toxicity compared to the control treatment. In addition, the combined application of zinc-lysine and iron-lysine effectively improved net photosynthesis (43.63%), stomatal conductance (20.05%), transpiration rate (20.14%), internal CO2 concentration (34.28%), total chlorophyll (43.12%), relative water content (23.95%), membrane stability index (32.77%), and proline content (25.53%) under stress condition and compared with control. Our results also indicated that the combined application of zinc-lysine and iron-lysine decreased Cr uptake in both shoot and root by 31.25% and 32%, and increased zinc and iron uptake by 39.28% and 36.67%, respectively, over the control, under Cr stress conditions. Moreover, under stress conditions, combined zinc-lysine and iron-lysine effectively improved growth traits particularly shoot and root dry weights, by 8% and 36.84%, respectively, over the control treatment. Overall, our results demonstrated that combined zinc-lysine and iron-lysine was more effective in mitigating Cr toxicity in pearl millet compared with the sole application of these treatments or the control."

However, effect of magnetization method on characterizations and Chromium (VI) adsorption of this adsorbent from Artocarpus Heterophyllus Peel (jackfruit peel) has not been investigated yet. This study magnetized jackfruit peel activated carbon using thermochemical and co-precipitation methods. Magnetic jackfruit activated carbon (MJAC) were examined and compared to jackfruit activated carbon (JAC) for surface chemistry, texture, morphology and crystalline properties. The isotherm/kinetics of Cr(VI) adsorption on these adsorbents were also analyzed. The results showed that all the adsorbents showed a typical peak of -(COO)n-Fe of iron oxide particles and functional groups but the adsorbent prepared with thermochemical method had the greatest Fe-O-C bond signal. The thermochemical adsorbent also had various particles of Fe3O4, Zero Valent Iron, and α-Fe2O3 while the co-precipitation absorbents gave a greater mesoporous structure and specific surface area than their JAC precursor; especially the adsorbent produced at mild temperature was covered by the highest iron oxide distribution on the surface and better magnetite property. As a result of the high specific surface area, these co-precipitation adsorbents were more effective for Cr(VI) adsorption than others. The PSO model best describes Cr(VI) adsorption on all absorbents with and without magnetite. Cr(VI) adsorption on JAC was dominated by intra-particle diffusion while multistep processes, including external mass transfer, governed the overall MJAC adsorption process. This work has created jackfruit peel-based magnetic activated carbon for wastewater treatment to remove toxic heavy metals and promote the circular economy that uses solid wastes as raw materials."

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: This in-vitro study aimed to compare the shear bond strength (SBS) of cobalt-chromium (Co-Cr) crowns on Corticobasal® implant abutments, evaluating the effects of two surface treatments and two luting agents. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty Co-Cr crowns were fabricated using CAD-CAM technology with a direct metal laser sintering process and divided into three groups based on surface treatment: Group I (untreated), Group II (sandblasted with 50 μm Al₂O₃), and Group III (Er: YAG laser etching). Each group was further subdivided based on luting cement: Sub group A (GC Fuji Plus) and Sub group B (Rely X U200). This resulted in a total of six groups. The implants were stabilized in auto-polymerizing acrylic resin, and cementation followed standardized protocols. Thermocycling with 1000 cycles (5 °C-55 °C) simulated oral conditions. SBS was tested using a universal testing machine at a crosshead speed of 1 mm/min. Failure patterns were analyzed using stereomicroscopy to classify adhesive, cohesive, and mixed failures. Statistical analysis was performed using one-way ANOVA and Bonferroni post-hoc tests (p < 0.05). RESULTS: Group IIIA (laser-treated, GC Fuji Plus) showed the highest SBS (243.15 MPa), followed by Group IIA (sandblasted + GC Fuji Plus), at 231.81 MPa. The lowest SBS was observed in Group IB (untreated, Rely X U200) at 124.24 MPa. Both sandblasting and laser treatment significantly enhanced SBS, with GC Fuji Plus consistently outperforming Rely X U200. A significant difference of 48.17 MPa was observed between laser-treated Groups IIIA and IIIB (p < 0.01). CONCLUSION: Laser etching and GC Fuji Plus cementation provided the highest SBS for Co-Cr crowns on Corticobasal® implants. Sandblasting was a secondary effective treatment, while untreated crowns exhibited the weakest bond strength."

The protocol provides systematic steps to determine protein expression encoded by pluripotency proteins such as Oct4, Nanog, and Cdx2 during early embryonic development. Occupational or environmental exposure to EDCs has significantly increased infertility in both men and women. The urinary concentration of the EDC bisphenol A in patients undergoing in vitro fertilization (IVF) is directly related to decreased implantation rates and the number of metaphase II oocytes recovered. This protocol outlines crucial steps in assessing the structure of F-actin and microtubules, DNA damage, and repair mechanisms in metaphase II oocytes as well as pluripotency protein markers of early-stage embryos. IVF techniques to achieve fertility goals in both humans and animals are of paramount importance. The interplay between F-actin and microtubules is crucial for bipolar spindle assembly and correct partitioning of the nuclear genome in mammalian oocyte meiosis. EDCs induce DNA damage and impair DNA repair mechanisms, compromising oocyte quality. In human IVF, this results in failure to implant, early miscarriage, and live births with congenital disorders, thus decreasing success rates and increasing poor outcomes. The application of IVF protocols in rats to understand EDC-mediated defects in the cytoskeletal network of metaphase II oocytes is not well established. We present a newly defined rat IVF protocol and demonstrate outcomes using these protocols to determine the adverse effects of Cr(VI) on metaphase II oocytes. Basic Protocol 1 includes steps to superovulate rats, dissect ampullae, retrieve oocytes/eggs, perform immunofluorescence staining of cytoskeletal machinery (microtubules and F-actin), and assess expression of the DNA double-strand break marker γ-H2AX and the DNA repair protein RAD51 in control and Cr(VI)-exposed rats.

METHODS: Consecutive patients treated for symptomatic iliac occlusive disease between 2014 and 2021 with the cobalt-chromium Dynetic-35 or the stainless steel Dynamic platform were retrospectively evaluated. Outcome measures included technical success, device- or procedure-related death, clinically-driven target lesion revascularization (CD-TLR), primary patency, and major index limb amputation up to 12 months. RESULTS: In total, 222 Cobalt chromium (CC) stents were used in 159 patients (34.6% female; mean age 66.9 ± 9.5 years) for the treatment of 216 lesions, while 234 iliac lesions of 182 patients (34.6% female; mean age 66.3 ± 9.9 years) were treated with 252 stainless steel (SS) stents. The mean lesion length (30.2 ± 12.8 mm vs 28.7 ± 22.5 mm, p=0.36) and the mean calcification grade (2.0 vs 1.9, p=0.07) did not differ significantly between the 2 groups. Patients treated by the CC platform were more frequently on statins (p<0.001), whereas more active smokers and subjects with higher Rutherford class underwent a SS deployment (p<0.001). Technical success was significantly higher in the SS group (100% vs 97.3%; p=0.01). This was due to longitudinal deformation or stent dislocation after passing the Dynetic-35 with endovascular material. After 1 year, no difference was found following CC and SS stent deployment in terms of device- or procedure-related deaths (0.6% vs 1.1%, p=0.99), target limb amputations (1.9% vs 1.6%, p=0.99), primary patency (91.3% vs 93.5%), and CD-TLR (6.5% vs 2.8% p=0.07). CONCLUSIONS: Through 1 year, cobalt-chromium and stainless steel balloon-expandable stents are safe and effective in the treatment of iliac occlusive disease. Enhanced attention should be given passing the cobalt-chromium stent with endovascular devices to avoid procedural complications. CLINICAL IMPACT: Stents with a thin-strut structure improve the flexibility and deliverability. The lower profile also increases the applicability lowering the risk of vascular access complications. In this study newer-generation cobalt chromium balloon-expandable stent did not confer advantages over stainless steel bare metal stent. On contrary, the technical success was inferior to stainless steel stents as longitudinal deformation or dislocation of the Dynetic-35 occurred. Therefore, enhanced attention should be given passing a Cobalt chromium stent with wires, catheters or sheaths to avoid stent deformation."

However, nanotechnology is capturing great interest worldwide due to their stirring applications in various fields. For this purpose, a pot experiment was conducted to examine plant growth and exo-physiology in rice (Oryza sativa L.) under the different levels of wastewater 50% and 100% concentrations which were also primed with three nanoparticles (NPs)-copper oxide (nCuO), silicon (nSi), and zinc oxide (nZnO). The research outcomes indicated that elevated levels of wastewater in the soil (100%) notably reduced plant growth and biomass, photosynthetic pigments, and gas exchange attributes. However, increasing levels of Cr stress also induced oxidative stress in the plants by increasing malondialdehyde (MDA), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), which also induced increased compounds of various enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidants and also the gene expression and sugar content. Furthermore, a significant increase in proline metabolism, the AsA-GSH cycle, and the pigmentation of cellular components was observed. Although, the application of nCuO, nSi, nZnO-NPs showed a significant increase in plant growth and biomass, gas exchange characteristics, enzymatic and non-enzymatic compounds, and their gene expression and also decreased oxidative stress. In addition, the application of nCuO, nSi, nZnO-NPs enhanced cellular fractionation and decreased the proline metabolism and AsA-GSH cycle in O. sativa plants. These results open new insights for sustainable agriculture practices and hold immense promise in addressing the pressing challenges of heavy metal contamination in agricultural soils.",

This study aimed to explore the effects of the chromium-histidine complex [Cr(hist)3] on reproductive success, developmental processes, and oxidative stress defence in Drosophila melanogaster. Wild-type D. melanogaster flies were exposed to Cr(hist)3 at concentrations of 5, 10, 15, and 20 µg/ml, and physiological parameters-including fecundity, fertility, developmental timelines, and antioxidant enzyme activity-were measured. Our results indicate that Cr(hist)3 at 15 µg/ml optimally enhanced reproductive health and developmental efficiency. Specifically, fecundity and fertility increased by 15.6% and 15.5%, respectively, and egg-to-adult viability improved by 15.6% compared to controls. Developmental timelines were shortened, with larval and pupal periods reduced by 7.6% and 7.1%. Additionally, Cr(hist)3 treatment led to a significant downregulation of lipid peroxidation (MDA) by 17.54% and upregulation in antioxidant enzymes (catalase, glutathione-S-transferase, and superoxide dismutase), indicating improved cellular defence against oxidative damage. Flies treated with 15 µg/ml Cr(hist)33 also exhibited a 9.7% increase in lifespan. These findings suggest that Cr(hist)3 enhances reproductive success and developmental dynamics through oxidative stress regulation, highlighting its potential for applications in insect health and stress management. This study contributes to the understanding of metal ion interactions in biological systems and their physiological effects.",

Related articles were identified by searching databases such as the Cochrane Library, ClinicalTrials.gov, ISI Web of Science, Scopus, and PubMed up until Agust 2024. We computed the mean differences (MD) along with their standard deviations (SDs) to carry out the meta-analysis. Statistical heterogeneity of the intervention effects was assessed using I-squared statistics and Cochran's Q test. In total, twelve and eleven studies were included in the present systematic review and meta-analysis, respectively. The pooled results indicated that the differences in serum levels of CRP and TNF-α between chromium group and the comparison group were statistically significant (CRP: weighted mean difference (WMD) = -0.58 mg/L; 95% confidence interval (CI) = -0.95, -0.22 mg/L; P = 0.002; TNF-α: WMD = -1.22 pg/ml; 95% CI = -1.91, -0.53 pg/ml; p = 0.001). In contrast, chromium supplementation resulted in a non-significant decrease in serum levels of IL-6 (WMD = -0.63 pg/ml; 95% CI: -1.67, 0.4 pg/ml; P < 0.001). Our study supports the beneficial effect of chromium supplementation on serum concentration of CRP and TNF-α, but our results showed that chromium supplementation non-significantly reduced the serum levels of IL-6. However, it seems that chromium formulation, participants' BMI, sample size, and geographical region are strong variables that predict the effect of chromium supplementation on inflammatory mediators."

Metals leach into soil from human activities including mining, manufacturing, and farming. Phytoremediation involves removing contaminants from soils using herbaceous plants and trees; it is a cost-effective, non-invasive, and aesthetically pleasing technique. The current research investigated the phytoremediation capacity of Cosmos bipinnatus in soil that had been polluted with chromium (Cr) along the Dravyavati River in Jaipur. The plant uptake of heavy metals was studied for 20, 40, 60, and 80 days of growth in pot and field experiments using atomic absorption spectrophotometry (AAS) to analyze residual heavy metal concentrations in the plant's shoots and roots. Chromium exhibited variation in total absorption by plants depending on the type of treatment. Using the translocation factor, it was observed that after 80 days in Nala soil 80% + wheat husk 20% (H2), the plant's capacity to absorb Cr was equivalent and considerably higher. Nola soil 80% + wheat husk 20%; H2, and Nala soil 70% + wheat husk 30%; H3 were among the treatments with TFs more than 1; however, the BCF values were all lower than 1. Additionally, root uptake was greater than shoot uptake. Thus, at H3 and H2 treatments, C. bipinnatus was determined to be an efficient phytoextractor for Cr, but at other concentrations, it acted as an excluder.",

      "abstract": "Chromium (Cr) is a hazardous metal found in various oxidation states, posing significant environmental and health risks. The study focuses on understanding how melatonin (MT), known for its diverse functions, including stress alleviation and antioxidant properties, interacts with nitric oxide (NO) to regulate sulfur metabolism and enhance cotton resilience under Cr toxicity. Cr toxicity negatively affected plant growth and photosynthesis and induced oxidative stress. MT treatment ameliorated these effects by enhancing photosynthetic pigments and gas exchange traits and upregulating the activities of antioxidant enzymes and the expression of FeSOD, CuZnSOD, and APX1. Moreover, MT reduced Cr accumulation in leaves, protecting photosynthetic organs from direct toxicity. Additionally, MT promotes the level of sulfur-based defense substances like glutathione (GSH) and phytochelatins (PC), which are crucial for detoxifying heavy metals. This is achieved by upregulating genes involved in cysteine metabolism (CYC1, CYC2, CAS1, CAS2, DES1, DES2, and SSCS), increasing cysteine availability for GSH and PC synthesis, and enhancing Cr sequestration in vacuoles. However, when the inhibitor of MT biosynthesis (p-CPA) and NO scavenger (cPTIO) were used along with MT in Cr-stressed plants, they hindered the stimulatory effects of MT. The study highlights the importance of the NO-MT interaction in mediating these protective effects, indicating a potential signaling role for NO in plant defense mechanisms against Cr toxicity. Overall, the findings reveal that MT fertilizing may serve as an effective strategy to enhance Cr resistance in cotton plants, with NO potentially playing a signaling role in this response pathway.",

Current extraction methods (ISO 17075-1:2017) for Cr(VI) testing do not necessarily reflect the true potential of surface-formed Cr(VI), as extracted concentrations are dependent on previous storage and atmospheric conditions. OBJECTIVES: To test whether a spiking method protocol can distinguish leathers with high and low risks of releasing Cr(VI). METHODS: Two groups of leather types were selected based on previously detected Cr(VI) (group A) and optimal tanning practices with high antioxidants (group B), corresponding to a high and low risk of forming and keeping Cr(VI). Leathers were spiked with different concentrations up to 10 mg/kg of Cr(VI) and incubated at 80°C for 24 h prior to the ISO 17075-1:2017 extraction protocol. RESULTS: All Cr(VI) was reduced by group B leathers, whereas all group A leather extracts contained detectable Cr(VI) that was dependent on the exact leather type and the amount initially spiked. CONCLUSION: Pre-treatment of samples with supplemental Cr(VI) is a potential method for determining the reduction capabilities of leather, which are closely related to the risk of Cr(VI) formation. 10 mg/kg spiking unambiguously distinguished leathers with high and low risks of forming Cr(VI).",

Particular attention is given to zirconium oxide, which demonstrates promising characteristics due to its esthetic color and favorable material properties, positioning it as a potential material for future use in post-endodontic treatments. Three materials-prefabricated quartz fiber-reinforced composite, milled zirconium oxide, and additively manufactured cobalt-chromium-were evaluated using compressive-deflection tests. The specimens were subjected to a 45° compressive load extending 5 mm from a metal core. Their mechanical properties were analyzed using one-way ANOVA and Tukey's post hoc test. Significant differences were observed among the materials. Quartz fiber posts, with the lowest force resistance, buckled at lower loads (143.3 ± 9.9 N), while zirconia posts failed in a brittle manner at higher forces (246.1 ± 97.2 N). Cobalt-chromium posts demonstrated the highest maximal force (323.2 ± 10.5 N, p < 0.001) and, unlike the other materials, bent rather than fractured. The failure patterns of the tested materials underscore the importance of careful material selection when restoring root-treated teeth. Despite displaying distinct fracture characteristics, zirconium oxide, due to its color, rigidity, and hardness, stands out as a promising material for future dental applications. Further research through randomized clinical trials is recommended to refine treatment approaches and optimize clinical outcomes."

In this research work, magnetic composite beads prepared from fruit peels (nectarine and orange) and alginate (ALG) as biopolymers (NAF and OAF) were synthesized by dropping and pH-precipitation method as alternative adsorbents. By encapsulating the adsorbent using alginate and imparting magnetic properties, the separation of the adsorbent from water after the adsorption process has been simplified. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy analysis (FTIR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis, energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX)-mapping and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analyses were performed to examine the surface chemical structure and surface morphological structure of these new synthesized biosorbents. The calculated maximum adsorption capacities were 224.3 mg/g for OAF and 256.5 mg/g for NAF at 298 K and pH =2.0. It was observed that the adsorption process for both adsorbents was endothermic and spontaneous. Moreover, the adsorptions of Cr (VI) onto both adsorbents followed the pseudo-second order model and fit the Langmuir isotherm model better. OAF and NAF were found to be reusable with stable adsorption capacity for at least five cycles. Overall, this study demonstrates the performance of OAF and NAF in the removal of Cr (VI) ions from aqueous solutions, thus highlighting the promising potential of these magnetic bio-based adsorbents for sustainable water treatment.",

Bilobetin (BLB) is a natural flavonoid which exhibits a wide range of medicinal properties. AIM: This trial was executed to investigate the pharmacotherapeutic potential of BLB to avert Cr instigated hepatotoxicity via modulating TLR4, JAK1/STAT3, Nrf-2/Keap-1 and NF-κB pathway. RESEARCH LAYOUT: Our trial was executed on thirty-six male albino rats that were segregated into four equal groups including the control, Cr (10 mg/kg), Cr (10 mg/kg) + BLB (12 mg/kg) and BLB (12 mg/kg) alone treated group. Various biochemical parameters were assessed by using qRT-PCR, molecular docking, molecular dynamic simulation and histological approaches. FINDINGS: Our results revealed that Cr administration significantly impaired the health of hepatic tissues by reducing the gene expression of Nrf-2 and its downregulating genes while promoting the levels of oxidative stress markers (ROS and MDA). Moreover, Cr administration upregulated the hepatic enzymes including ALT, GGT, AST, and ALP while concurrently decreasing the levels of total protein and albumin. Cr exposure also elevated the gene expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines including toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB), Janus kinase 1 (JAK1), signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), C-reactive proteins, interferon-gamma inducible protein-10 (IP-10), Interleukin beta-1(IL-1β), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). Hepatic apoptosis was observed to be elevated following the Cr intoxication. Nonetheless, BLB treatment remarkably alleviated the hepatic damages via regulating the biochemical as well as histological profile of liver. Our findings are further endorsed by molecular docking analysis that demonstrated that BLB exhibit strong binding affinity to Keap-1 and STAT3 thus supporting its efficient hepatoprotective potential. CONCLUSION: BLB protected the hepatic tissues via regulating Cr induced impairments. These findings were confirmed by molecular docking and molecular dynamic simulation analysis.",

This study aimed to assess and compare the salivary cobalt and chromium concentrations in individuals aged 18-65 years with and without dental restorations containing metal alloys. Methods: Participants were divided into two main groups according to the existence of metal alloys in the oral cavity-18 patients had fixed prosthetic restorations made of metal alloys, and 17 patients had no metal objects in their oral cavity. Each main group was subdivided into two subgroups according to the type of saliva sample-with or without additional stimulation. Salivary cobalt and chromium concentrations were measured by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. A non-parametric Mann-Whitney test and Spearman's rank correlation coefficient were applied, and the level of significance was set to p < 0.05. Results: The results showed that the chromium level in non-stimulated saliva was higher in the group of patients with metal dental restorations. No statistical difference was found in cobalt levels. There was no statistical difference in Co or Cr concentrations in stimulated saliva between the studied groups. A positive correlation was found between Cr and Co concentrations in non-stimulated saliva and between cobalt concentrations in stimulated and non-stimulated saliva. Conclusions: Metal alloys in the oral cavity induced elevated chromium levels in non-stimulated saliva, and a correlation between chromium and cobalt ion concentration was found. A detailed examination of patients and their medical history prior to prosthetic treatment is advisable in order to avoid any undesired health effects."

      "abstract": "The accumulation of chromium (Cr) and copper (Cu) in soil during industrialization and modernization poses an extreme threat to crops. Poly-γ-glutamic acid (γ-PGA) has the potential to stabilize heavy metals in soil through chelation because of the numerous carboxyl groups in its side chain. The rhizosphere microbiome contributes to plant detoxification by participating in heavy metal passivation. However, it is still unclear whether γ-PGA can alleviate the toxicity of Cr and Cu to plants and whether this effect is associated with changes in the rhizosphere microbiome assembly. Here, we found that γ-PGA application significantly reduced the content of Cr or Cu in cucumber plants by 67.45%-86.77% and 94.67%-98.21, respectively, and alleviated the oxidative stress of Cr or Cu to plants. Moreover, γ-PGA significantly increased the biomass of cucumber fruits in the plot experiment by 13.5% and 25.3% under Cr and Cu stress, respectively. The content of Cr or Cu in the cucumber fruit was below limits of detection, in contrast to the 31.23 mg/kg Cr or 9.86 mg/kg Cu detected in the no-γ-PGA treatment. γ-PGA effectively chelated Cr and Cu in vitro, and less than 30% of their chelates were degraded in 20 weeks, suggesting the strong stability of these chelates. γ-PGA significantly altered the rhizosphere bacterial community composition of cucumber by enriching phyla Gemmatimonadota, Acidobacteriota and Firmicutes, and genera Gemmatimonas and Stenotrophomonas, which potentially involved in reducing the mobility of Cr and Cu in soils. Furthermore, γ-PGA significantly enriched taxa assigned to plant growth-promoting bacteria (PGPB). Together, our results suggest that γ-PGA can reduce the Cr and Cu contents in cucumber, and this process is strongly associated with the chelation capacity of γ-PGA and its effects on rhizosphere microbiome composition. These results highlight the exciting potential to use γ-PGA for the remediation of heavy metal-contaminated soils.",

The pyrolysis temperature of BC was optimized to enhance electron transfer efficiency and reduce extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) accumulation. BC500, with the superior electron transfer capabilities, was the most effective. After an 11-week period, the ZVI + BC500 biotic column still achieved 100% removal efficiency for Cr(VI) and 93.37 ± 0.33% for NO3-, with initial concentrations of 26 mg/L and 50 mg/L, respectively. Its performance significantly surpasses that of ZVI alone, effectively reducing the interference of Cr(VI) on denitrification. The presence of quinone and phenolic compounds in BC500, serving as electron-accepting and electron-donating groups, improves the efficiency of electron transfer between ZVI and microbes. Metagenomic analysis showed an increase in the growth of autotrophic bacteria such as Hydrogenophaga spp. and Rhodanobacter denitrificans, and heterotrophic bacteria including Arenimonas daejeonensis and Chryseobacterium shandongense. The promotion facilitates the expression of genes associated with Cr(VI) reduction (chrR, nemA) and denitrification (narG, nirS). BC500 also enhanced EPS production, which facilitates the adsorption and reduction of Cr(VI), mitigating its inhibitory effects on denitrification. Notably, in the ZVI + BC500 biotic column, the accumulated EPS primarily consists of loosely bound EPS rather than tightly bound EPS, potentially reducing the risk of pore clogging during in-situ groundwater treatment.",

      "abstract": "Diabetes is a global public health concern with increasing prevalence worldwide. Chromium (Cr), a trace element found in soil, water, and food, has been proposed to have a possible positive effect in glucose metabolism and diabetes mellitus prevention. However, the relationship between trivalent chromium [Cr(III)] exposure, mainly through the consumption of diet supplements, and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) remains controversial. An extensive systematic review of the current literature on randomized controlled studies (RCTs) was conducted from 1 January 2000, to January 2024 using the databases PubMed, Scopus, ScienceDirect, and Cochrane, with specific keywords and inclusion as well as exclusion criteria. After close screening of the research studies retrieved from the mentioned websites was conducted, the most related studies were included in the final systematic review. The studies were evaluated for the degree of relevance, quality, and risk bias, using appropriate quality assessment tools. Several of the included RCT studies reported possible benefits of Cr(III) supplementation, mainly in the form of chromium picolinate (CrPic), chromium yeast (CY), chromium chloride (CrCl3), and chromium nicotinate (CrN). The dosage of chromium was between 50 and 1000 μg/day and it was consumed from 2 to 6 months. Glycemic control markers, including FPG, insulin, HbA1C, and HOMA-IR levels, significantly decrease following chromium supplementation, mainly in studies with a longer intervention period. Supplementing with chromium (Cr) indicated that could significantly improve lipid profile by raising high-density lipoprotein and lowering triglyceride and total cholesterol while having little effect on low-density lipoprotein. However, most research findings include significant limitations, such as inconsistent dosage and type of chromium, formulation of supplements, and study duration. Further well-designed and high-quality research is needed to fully understand the role of chromium dietary supplementation and the potential risks related to its mechanisms of action, type, and dose, in the prevention and treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus.",

      "abstract": "Chromium and arsenic are commonly found in water and wastewater as hexavalent chromium, Cr(VI), and inorganic arsenic species, such as pentavalent arsenic, As(V). In aqueous media, both Cr(VI) and As(V) exist predominantly in the form of oxy-anions. In our study, we prepared a polyethylenimine-silica composite material (SiO₂-PEI) as an adsorbent to study the adsorption capacity for chromate and arsenate ions. Polyethylenimine (PEI) can effectively bind negatively charged species through electrostatic interactions. The parameters that were evaluated, regarding the adsorption capacity were the effect of pH, the effect of the initial concentration of Cr(VI) and As(V), and the presence of other anions. Also, we examined the effect of Cr(VI) and As(V) on each other by studying the simultaneous removal of chromate and arsenate ions. Isotherm, kinetic, and thermodynamic analyses on the experimental data obtained were conducted. The results showed that the pH of the solution is affecting the charge density of PEI, and at pH 4, the lower value that was examined, the SiO₂-PEI exhibited higher adsorption capacity. The presence of other anions, such as phosphate, nitrate, and sulfate ions, had an adverse effect on the adsorption capacity of the SiO₂-PEI material for both chromate and arsenate ions. The adsorption capacity of arsenate was more affected by the presence of other anions compared to the chromate, and the higher impact was observed by the sulfate ions at pH 4, on the contrary for the chromate ions the higher impact was observed by the sulfate ions at pH 7 and by the phosphate ions at pH 4. Concerning the effect of temperature, the adsorption is an exothermic process and it was more favorable at lower environmental temperature. The study of simultaneous removal of Cr(VI) and As(V) declares the material's ability to accommodate both types of ions without requiring separate treatment steps. Addressing the simultaneous removal is essential for reducing the complexity of water treatment systems, lowering operational costs, and improving the safety of treated water.",

Herein, ferrocene (Fc) was combined with carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) and polyethyleneimine (PEI) for Cr(VI) remediation. Fc species possessed reversible redox behavior and low ionization potential, yet it faced challenges with conductivity and stability. Results revealed that, PEI facilitated the binding of Fc within the CMC through electrostatic interactions or coordination bonds, ensuring the good dispersion and stability of Fc. When applied in the electrochemical adsorption of Cr(VI), the combination created a synergistic effect. The presence of Fc and PEI boosted the electrochemical performance by providing faster electronic and ionic transportation, higher specific capacitance coupled with improved electrode-electrolyte interactions, leading to a higher Cr(VI) adsorption capacity over CMC/PEI/Fc (280.5 mg/g) compared to those over CMC and CMC/PEI. The interactions between the Cr(VI) and electrode included the electrosorption, electrostatic interaction of protonated PEI and oxidized Fc species. When the electric field was reversed, the Cr(VI) was electrostatic repulsed and electrocatalytic reduced to Cr(III) with a reduction rate of 85.4 %. This work promoted the development of effective electrosorption materials suitable for complete Cr(VI) removal and detoxification.",

This study investigates the impact of these practices on the skin's ability to retain the allergenic metals nickel, cobalt, and chromium. The study constitutes three parts: (I) creating an impaired skin barrier, (II) exposing treated and untreated skin to nickel alone, and (III) in co-exposure with cobalt and chromium. METHODS: Using full-thickness skin from stillborn piglets, in vitro experiments were conducted to assess retention of metals in skin at conditions mimicking intense hand hygiene practices. Treatment of skin with varying concentrations of sodium lauryl sulphate (SLS), to impair its barrier integrity was assessed. This was followed by exposure of treated and untreated skin to the metals, that were dissolved in Milli-Q water, 0.5% SLS, and ethanol respectively. RESULTS: Results showed that pre-treatment with 5% SLS impaired the skin barrier with regards to the measure of trans epidermal water loss (TEWL). Metal amounts retained in the skin were generally higher in treated than untreated skin. The highest amounts of metal retained in skin were observed for exposure to nickel in ethanol. Co-exposure to nickel, cobalt, and chromium in 0.5% SLS resulted in the highest amounts of total metal retention. CONCLUSIONS: The in vitro findings highlight the increased risk of metal retention in skin due to an impaired barrier. The SLS concentration used in the current study corresponds to those used in many hand hygiene products. Hence, occupational settings with frequent exposure to water, soap and disinfectants need to consider protective measures not only for the irritant exposures themselves but also simultaneous exposure to allergenic metals."

      "abstract": "Phytase supplementation is widely used throughout the world for enhancing nutrient use efficiencies in pigs, while added chromium has been shown to help stabilize glucose metabolism by enhancing insulin sensitivity. Therefore, the objectives of this metabolism study were to examine the potential synergies of these additives to see if nutrient digestibilities and/or blood metabolites could be improved in grower pigs. A total of 12 Genesus terminal genetics grower pigs (20.7 kg) were allotted randomly in a crossover experiment with 4 periods and 4 dietary treatments based on a 2 × 2 factorial design via 2 groups. This provided 12 replicates per dietary treatment. Treatment (Trt) 1 consisted of a control diet without phytase while Trt 2 had decreased levels of soybean meal, calcium (Ca) and phosphorus (P) with added phytase (1,500 phytase units (FYT)/kg, HiPhorius; dsm-firmenich, Plainsboro, NJ). The nutrient release values for amino acids, calcium and phosphorus were via standard recommendations from dsm-firmenich for the phytase. Treatment 3 consisted of the control diet without phytase with 200 parts per billion (ppb) of added chromium from chromium tripicolinate (Chromax, Kent Nutrition Group, Inc., Muscatine, IA) while Trt 4 consisted of the diets with decreased levels of soybean meal, Ca and P with added HiPhorius (1,500 FYT/kg) and Chromax (200 ppb). With 6 metabolism crates available, 4, 1-wk-long periods were utilized to evaluate each of the 4 treatments with each pig with 2 groups evaluated and pooled for data analysis. The pigs were allowed a 4-d acclimation period followed by a 3-d collection period with the experimental diets fed at 4% body weight each day. Water was administered to each pig at 2.5 times the amount of feed fed each day. On the last day of the collection period, blood samples were collected before the meal (fasting) and then 2 h after the meal (postprandial). There were no significant differences among treatments for both fasting and postprandial glucose and insulin levels. Added phytase resulted in a reduction (P < 0.05) in fasting blood urea nitrogen (N). Nitrogen digestibility and retention and dry matter (DM) digestibility were all improved (P < 0.01) with pigs fed supplemental phytase. Supplemental chromium was without effect on any of the N and DM digestibility measurements. These data suggest that supplemental phytase has positive effects on improving N and DM digestibilities.",

      "abstract": "Chromium is widely presented in industrial solid wastes like tannery sludge, electroplating sludge and metallurgical slag. These industrial solid wastes usually undergo thermal treatment process to reduce volume and toxicity. However, a significant amount of low-toxicity and low-mobility Cr(III) is determined to be oxidized to highly-toxic and highly-mobile Cr(VI) at high temperature, posing a greater threat to humans and the ecological environment. This paper summarizes the forms of Cr in solid wastes containing Cr, redox reactions mechanisms for different Cr forms, and methods to inhibit Cr(VI) formation during thermal treatment process. The Cr(III) compounds in solid waste containing Cr mainly include Cr(III) hydrates, Cr(III) oxides, Cr(III) hosting spinels and Organic-Cr(III). Cr(III) hydrates are usually oxidized at temperatures above 100 °C, even without the induction of alkali and alkaline earth metals. Compared to the direct reaction of Cr(III) oxides and spinels with O2, Cr(III) can be induced to oxidize at lower temperatures by alkali and alkaline earth metals. A large amount of Cr(III) is oxidized usually at 600-900 °C. Organic-Cr is generally pyrolyzed to CrO3(g), CrO2Cl(g) and Cr2O3(s) at high temperature. CrO2Cl(g) can be released directly into the atmosphere with CrO3(g), or captured by CaO to form CaCrO4. The reduction of Cr(VI) at high temperatures includes the decomposition of unstable Cr(VI) compounds driven solely by temperature, as well as reduction facilitated by acidic oxides. The reduction of Cr(VI) at high temperatures involves the decomposition of unstable Cr(VI) compounds, driven solely by temperature, as well as reduction facilitated by acidic oxides. Typical unstable Cr(VI) compounds include CrO3 and CaCrO4, which begin to decompose at temperatures above 270 °C and 1000 °C, respectively. Cr(III) oxidation and Cr(VI) reduction at high temperature are strongly dependent on the system basicity and the temperature. Subsequently, reducing oxygen content in atmosphere and the system basicity by adding common acidic oxides such as silicon dioxide, phosphate and sulfates exhibited a significant effect on inhibiting Cr(VI) formation during heating solid waste containing Cr. However, Cr oxidation and reduction mechanisms at molecular level have not yet been explored, and more effective measures to inhibit Cr(III) oxidation during thermal treatment of solid waste also should be developed in further works."

      "abstract": "Nano zerovalent iron (nZVI) has been broadly used in the treatment of chromium (Cr) pollution. However, conventional nZVI particles are prone to surface oxidation and particle agglomeration, limiting their effectiveness in contaminant removal. To address these issues, sulfidated nZVI (S-nZVI) was synthesized on the corn stover biochar (BC) surface for rapid removal of Cr(VI) from water. Sedimentation and column transport experiments demonstrated that S-nZVI@BC exhibits excellent dispersion and transport properties, efficiently removing Cr(VI) in the pH range of 2.5-5.0 and showing minimal impact from dissolved oxygen. The Fe0, Fe(Ⅱ), and S2- components of the material, along with the leached Fe2+ ions, contributed to the Cr(VI) removal. A portion of the removed Cr(VI) was reduced to Cr(III) in solution, while another portion was adsorbed on the material's surface through precipitation, with 42.0% of Cr being adsorbed within 30 min. Cycling and water matrix interference experiments further demonstrated the material's excellent reusability and resistance to interference. Notably, the continuous Cr(VI) removal capability in column experiments and the reactivation potential of S-nZVI@BC highlight its promise for practical applications. Future studies are suggested to explore the ecotoxicological effects of the S-nZVI@BC and its capacity for the simultaneous removal of multiple contaminants.",

Materials and Methods: Thirty-two discs made from a ceramic-alloy combination of pre-sintered cobalt-chromium (CoCr), cast CoCr, cast nickel-chromium (NiCr), or pre-sintered zirconia were prepared with eight discs in each group. Four specimens were examined as manufactured and four were ceramic-layered. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), X-Ray diffractometer (XRD), and an atomic force microscope were used for analysis. Non-layered specimens received ceramic fire-heating without adding any ceramic. Alloy microstructure was compared before and after ceramic veneering or heating within the same group. Mean differences in grain size and surface roughness were compared among groups. P<0.05 was considered significant. Results: SEM showed a close bonding interface between alloys and ceramics. EDX demonstrated differences compared to the manufacturer's composition. Ceramic-layering reduced grain size for both milled alloys (P<0.05), whereas grain size increased in cast groups (P=0.011). Heat treatment did the same for the CoCr groups (P=0.013). Ceramic veneering increased the surface roughness of the cast CoCr (Gi) (P=0.029) and NiCr (Wi) (P=0.005) groups, whereas zirconia roughness average (Ra) showed a slight decrease (P=0.282). XRD showed no differences among zirconia, NiCr, and milled CoCr groups before and after veneering. Crystallite size differed between monoclinic and tetragonal phases in zirconia. Conclusion: The study highlights that ceramic-layering induces significant microstructural changes in alloys, enhancing bonding potential and mechanical stability. Pre-sintered materials show a fine homogeneous surface, optimizing ceramic adherence and potentially improving clinical outcomes."

Previous studies showed that AOM could be coupled to chromate reduction. However, the specific responsible microorganisms and the biochemical mechanisms are unclear. Herein, we showed that a consortium dominated by ANME \"Candidatus Methanoperedens\" was able to couple AOM to the reduction of Cr(VI) to Cr(III) at a stoichiometry close to the theoretical ratio. Quantitative distribution analysis of Cr(III) products suggested Cr(VI) was predominantly reduced via the extracellular respiratory pathways. Further Cr(III)-targeted fluorescent visualization combined with single-cell electron microscopic imaging suggested that Cr(VI) was reduced by \"Ca. Methanoperedens\" independently. Biochemical mechanism investigation via proteomic analysis showed proteins for nitrate reduction under nitrate-reducing conditions were significantly downregulated in Cr(VI)-reducing incubation. Instead, many multiheme cytochrome c (MHCs) were among the most upregulated proteins during the Cr(VI) reduction process, suggesting MHC-governed pathways for extracellular Cr(VI) reduction. The significant upregulation of a formate-dependent nitrite reductase during Cr(VI) reduction indicated its potential contribution to the small proportion of Cr(VI) reduction inside cells.",

Moreover, salicylic acid (SA) is acknowledged as a growth regulator involved in addressing metal toxicity. However, the effectiveness of both compounds in mitigating Cr-induced stress has remained relatively unexplored, especially in the case of Aconitum napellus, a medicinally and floricultural important plant. Therefore, the primary objective of this study was to investigate the potential of CTS and SA in alleviating chromium (Cr)-induced stress in A. napellus.

Foliar application of CTS (0.4 g/L) or SA (0.25 mmol/L) led to significant improvements in the growth, chlorophyll content, fluorescence, and photosynthetic traits of A. napellus plants under Cr stress. The most notable effects were observed with the combined application of CTS and SA, resulting in increases in various morphological parameters, such as shoot length (2.89% and 7.02%) and root length (27.75% and 3.36%) under the Cr 1 and Cr 2 treatments, respectively. Additionally, several physiological parameters, such as chlorophyll a (762.5% and 145.56%), chlorophyll b (762.5% and 145.56%), carotenoid (17.03% and 28.57%), and anthocyanin (112.01% and 47.96%) contents, were notably improved under the Cr 1 and Cr 2 treatments, respectively. Moreover, the combined treatment of CTS and SA improved the fluorescence parameters while decreasing the levels of enzymatic antioxidants such as catalase (27.59% and 43.79%, respectively). The application also notably increased osmoprotectant parameters, such as the total protein content (54.11% and 20.07%) and the total soluble sugar content (78.17% and 49.82%) in the leaves of A. napellus in the Cr 1 and 2 treatments, respectively. In summary, these results strongly suggest that the simultaneous use of exogenous CTS and SA is an effective strategy for alleviating the detrimental effects of Cr stress on A. napellus. This integrated approach opens promising avenues for further exploration and potential implementation within agricultural production systems.",

      "abstract": "In the modern era, sol-gel plays a key role in the progress of a new generation of dispersive solid-phase microextractors (d-µ SPMEs) for the removal of organic and inorganic pollutants in complex matrices. Thus, the current study reports the use of sol-gel-functionalized polyurethane foams (PUFs) as a novel solid platform for complete extraction of chromium (VI) species from aqueous media. The planned protocol was based upon the complete extraction of the formed binary complex ion associates between the protonated ether and/or urethane groups of PUFs and chlorochromate anion [CrO3Cl]- aq in aqueous HCl (≥1M) medium in addition to H-bonding and the electrostatic π-π interaction that resulted between the CrO3Cl- and the silanol group (Si/ZrO2, Si-O-Zr) and siloxane (Si-O-Si) groups of the sol-gel. The impact of the analytical parameters (solution pH, natural mineral acids, shaking time, temperature, and chromium (VI) concentrations) was critically studied. At the optimal conditions, the uptake capacity of the established extractor (9.9 mg·g-1) was in agreement with the Langmuir adsorption capacity (12.08 mg·g-1) of the monolayer. The sorption data fitted well with the pseudo first-order kinetic model (R 2 = 0.9961) with an overall rate constant (k 1) of 0.081 min-1 and an equilibrium capacity (q e ) of 8.6 mg·g-1, which is in a good agreement with the experimental value (9.9 mg·g-1). The sorption of the oxyion [CrO3Cl]- aq onto the solid sorbent is an endothermic and spontaneous process as reflected from the values of ΔH (6.99 kJ·mol-1) and ΔG (-8.14 kJ·mol-1 at 293 K), respectively. The ΔS value (15.13 kJ·mol-1·K-1) reflects that the [CrO3Cl]- aq retention onto the sol-gel-treated PUFs sorbent proceeded in a more unplanned fashion. Sol-gel-treated PUFs sorbent-packed minicolumns were successfully used for the complete removal of trace levels of chromium (VI) species from water samples. Sorbed chromium (VI) species were recovered with NaOH (0.5 M) and analysed by spectrophotometry, which supports the utility of the sol-gel-treated PUFs as a low-cost solid extractor for water treatment."

      "abstract": "Periparturient dairy cows exhibit intense lipolysis driven by reduced DMI, enhanced energy needs, and the loss of adipose tissue (AT) insulin sensitivity. Extended periods of low insulin sensitivity and negative energy balance induce lipolysis dysregulation, leading to increased disease susceptibility and poor lactation performance. Chromium (Cr) supplementation improves systemic insulin sensitivity, whereas palmitic acid (PA) increases energy availability for milk production. However, the effect of supplementing Cr and PA alone or in combination on insulin sensitivity in AT is unknown. A total of 32 multiparous cows were used in a randomized complete block design experiment and randomly assigned to one of 4 diets fed from 1 to 24 DIM: a control diet with no supplementation (CON, n = 8); the Cr diet (Cr propionate at 0.45 mg/kg Cr/kg DM, n = 8); the PA diet (1.5% DM, n = 8); or Cr+PA (n = 8). Plasma samples were collected at -13 ± 5.1 d prepartum (PreP), and at 14.4 ± 1.9 d (PP1) and 21 ± 1.9 d (PP2) after calving for quantification of albumin, BHB, BUN, calcium, cholesterol, glucose, nonesterified fatty acids (NEFA), total protein, iron, transferrin, triglycerides, and oxylipids. Subcutaneous AT (SCAT) explants were collected at PreP, PP1, and PP2 and incubated in the presence of the lipolytic agent isoproterenol (ISO = 1 µM, BAS = 0 µM) for 3 h. The antilipolytic effect of insulin (1 µL/L) on SCAT explants was evaluated during ISO stimulation (ISO+INS). Lipolysis was quantified by glycerol release in the medium (nmol glycerol/mg AT). Macrophage infiltration and adipocyte size were measured using hematoxylin and eosin-stained AT sections and immunohistochemistry. The Cr diet tended to reduce postpartum NEFA concentrations when compared with CON, PA, and Cr+PA. Likewise, Cr increased the percentage of large adipocytes (>9,000 µm2) postpartum compared with other diets. In line with higher lipid content, Cr-fed cows had higher ex vivo BAS lipolysis at PP2 when compared with PA and Cr+PA. Isoproterenol induced higher lipolysis at PP1 and PP2, but it was not affected by Cr and PA. The ISO+INS treatment reduced lipolysis by 29.91% ± 11% in Cr compared with ISO. In contrast, ISO+INS did not affect ISO lipolysis in CON, PA, and Cr+PA. Plasma transferrin was reduced by Cr. At PP2, PA cows had 3.3-fold higher macrophage infiltration in SCAT when compared with CON and Cr. Plasma 9-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid (HODE) and 9-oxo-octadecadienoic acid (oxoODE) were increased by Cr+PA. Palmitic acid increased plasma 13-oxoODE and Cr increased the ratio of 13-HODE to 13-oxoODE. Palmitic acid increased 5-iso prostaglandin F2α-VI. Our results demonstrate that supplementing Cr during the immediate postpartum enhances SCAT insulin sensitivity and lipid accumulation. Further studies should determine the effects and mechanisms of action of Cr and PA on AT lipogenesis, adipogenesis, and their impact on lactation performance.",

This study recovered Cr(III) as Na2CrO4 from EPS using an integrated bipolar membrane electrodialysis (BMED)-H2O2 oxidation technology. During the treatment process, Cr(III) was oxidised to Cr(VI) using H2O2 in an alkaline environment, BMED was used to separate and recover Cr(VI). Experimental results showed that H2O2 dosage and pH affected Cr(III) oxidation-the highest Cr(III) oxidation ratio of 68.4% was observed when H2O2 dosage and pH were 5.5 mL and 12.0, respectively. The current density, solid/liquid ratio and sludge particle size affected Cr(III) recovery, energy consumption and current efficiency. Under a current density of 20.0 mA/cm2, solid/liquid ratio of 1.0:45 and sludge particle size of 100 mesh, 58.2% of Cr(III) was recovered. When the number of the equipped EPS compartments was increased from one to two and three, the specific energy consumption decreased from 1.04 to 0.87 and 0.81 kW h/g, respectively, but the current efficiency remained almost constant. After EPS treatment, the Cr(III) remaining in the sludge was mainly in the residual state, which is less environmentally harmful. The obtained Na2CrO4 had similar properties according to X-ray diffraction analysis. Thus, the proposed integrated technology effectively recovers Cr(III) from EPS and other chromium-containing solid wastes.",

METHOD: This research was set to be a parallel, triple-blinded, randomised controlled trial. Twenty completely edentulous patients received new conventional complete dentures according to conventional techniques. Two implants were placed at mandibular canine areas bilaterally, and patients were randomly allocated into two equal groups: the milled Co-Cr bar group and the selective laser melted (SLM) Co-Cr bar group. Marginal bone loss (MBL), modified plaque index (mPI), modified gingival index (mGI), and probing depth (PD) were evaluated at 0-month (baseline), 6-month, and 12-month follow-up visits. Repeated measures ANOVA test and Bonferroni's post-hoc test were used for parametric data as PD, while for non-parametric data as MBL, mGI, and mPI, Mann-Whitney U test and Friedman's test were used. A P-value ≤ 0.05 was set as the statistical level of significance. The study protocol was approved by the Faculty Research Ethics Committee at Minia University (636 4/10/2022). Registration for the clinical trial was made retrospectively on clinicaltrials.gov with ID NCT06401200 at 04/30/2024. RESULTS: The follow-up period (one year) was completed without a dropout. Regarding MBL, no statistically significant difference was found between the two groups throughout the study. However, the milled group showed significantly increased MBL from 0- to 6-month follow up period. In both groups, mPI increased significantly from 0- to 6-months post-loading. On the other hand, no statistically significant difference between the two groups was found regarding mPI and mGI throughout the study follow-up periods. The PD was significantly lower in the milled compared to the SLM group at the 6- and 12-month follow up period. CONCLUSION: Two-implant mandibular overdenture retained with milled or SLM Co-Cr bar can provide an acceptable treatment option for completely edentulous patients regarding marginal bone loss and soft tissue outcomes.",

      "abstract": "Although soluble bio-accelerators have proven effective in mitigating Cr(VI) inhibition within denitrification system, issues persist in immobilizing bio-accelerators and making them slow-release for sustained regulation. In this study, a novel strategy was proposed to fabricate immobilized bio-accelerators with controlled structure, sustained release property by 3D printing technology. Notably, the sustained release of bio-accelerators from 3D-printed bio-accelerators (3DP-B) lasted for at least 144 h. Compared to control group, 3DP-B with basic components (3DP-BB) shortened the recovery time by 1.4 folds, and the COD and NO3--N removal efficiency was 36.5 % and 38.0 % higher than that of natural recovery. Correspondingly, the activity of key enzymes (nitrate reductase, nitrite reductase, nitric oxide reductase, and nitrous oxide reductase), electron transfer system activity and extracellular polymer substances of denitrification biofilm maintained at relatively high levels. Furthermore, introducing 60 mg·L-1 anthraquinone-2,6-disulfonate (AQDS) into the ink showed noticeable superiority on the bio-inhibition release over 1000 mg·L-1 AQDS. The released AQDS facilitated the electron transport capacity by 1.25 times compared with control group. The groundbreaking findings of this study could advance the development of 3D printing technology and utilization of bio-accelerators in the field of wastewater treatment.",

      "abstract": "Despite efforts to reduce the risk of toxic chemicals, colors, and dyes being released into the environment from urban and industrial areas, there is still cause for concern. Colored water must be filtered and sterilized before it can be used for irrigation. The utilization of metal oxide and nanocomposite materials in wastewater treatment procedures appears to be a viable option for the future. Therefore, different compounds were doped with graphene oxide to identify the best material for dye removal by the adsorption process. According to recent studies, the ideal conditions for graphene oxide-doped magnesium oxide (GO/MgO) are as follows: pH 10 showed the highest adsorption capacity (qe) at 49.4 mg/g; an adsorbent dosage of 0.01 g/50 mL showed 48.3 mg/g qe; a shaking time of 30 min resulted in 44.2 mg/g qe; an initial dye concentration of 100 mg/L yielded 53.6 mg/g qe; and a temperature of 35 °C gave 49.5 mg/g qe. For graphene oxide-doped strontium titanate (GO/SrTiO3), the optimum conditions were as follows: pH 10 with 45.8 mg/g qe; an adsorbent dose of 0.01 g/50 mL with 40.5 mg/g qe; a shaking time of 30 min with 75 mg/g qe; and a temperature of 35 °C with 44.7 mg/g qe. Graphene oxide-doped cobalt and iron-doped lanthanum chromium titanate (GO/Co.Fe.LaCrO3) showed optimum conditions of pH 9 with 34.2 mg/g qe; an adsorbent dose of 0.01 g/50 mL with 27.5 mg/g qe; a shaking time of 45 min with 33.2 mg/g qe; an initial dye concentration of 100 mg/L with 37.6 mg/g qe; and a temperature of 35 °C with 42.5 mg/g qe. Graphene oxide-doped cadmium sulfide (GO/CdS) showed the following optimum conditions: pH 8 with 23.1 mg/g qe; an adsorbent dose of 0.01 g/50 mL with 25.5 mg/g qe; an initial dye concentration of 75 mg/L with 28.3 mg/g qe; and a temperature of 35 °C with 33.5 mg/g qe. The pseudo-first-order model was the best fit only for graphene oxide-doped magnesium oxide (GO/MgO) with an R2 value of 0.966, while the pseudo-second-order adsorption isotherm was the best fit for all four products, with R2 values ranging from 0.991 to 0.998. Additionally, the Langmuir adsorption isotherms provided good results for all four products, with R2 values ranging from 0.957 to 0.985. The Freundlich adsorption kinetics showed satisfactory fit only for graphene oxide-doped magnesium oxide (GO/MgO) and graphene oxide-doped cadmium sulfide (GO/CdS), with R2 values of 0.951 and 0.982, respectively. To examine the characteristics and practicality of the adsorption process, certain thermodynamic variables were calculated. The adsorption capability of the most efficient nanocomposites for the degradation of basic red-46 was significantly affected by various concentrations of heavy metal ions and electrolytes. In dye solutions containing surfactants/detergents, the adsorption efficiency of several effective photocatalysts for basic dyes was significantly reduced. A 0.5 M HCl solution was found to be the most effective for desorption. In column investigations, the optimal bed height, flow velocity, and dye intake levels were determined to be 3 cm, 1.8 mL/min, and 70 mg/L, respectively, for maximal adsorption of basic red-46. The adsorption investigation of genuine textile waste products has also been carried out to facilitate the practical deployment of this approach. The methods used in this study were cost-effective, easy to handle, and eco-friendly and involved no hazardous materials in the synthesis, making the resulting materials non-hazardous. All these methods were part of green chemistry."

      "abstract": "Recovering chemical energy embedded in pollutants is significant in achieving carbon-neutral industrial wastewater treatment. Considering that industrial wastewater is usually treated in a decentralized manner, in situ utilization of chemical energy to achieve waste-to-treasure should be given priority. Herein, the chemical energy released by the electroreduction of Cr(VI) was used to enhance on-site H2O2 generation in a stacked flow-through electrochemical system. The driving force of water flow efficiently coupled O2 evolution with 2-e O2 reduction to facilitate H2O2 generation by transporting anode-produced O2 to the cathode. Meanwhile, the chemical energy released by Cr(VI) promoted O2 evolution and impeded H2 evolution by regulating the electrode potentials, accounting for the enhanced H2O2 generation. The system could completely reduce 10-100 ppm of Cr(VI), reaching the maximum H2O2 concentration of 2.41 mM. In particular, the H2O2 concentrations in the Cr(VI)-containing electrolyte were 10.6-88.1% higher than those in the Cr(VI) free electrolyte at 1.8-2.5 V. A 24-day continuous experiment demonstrated the high efficiency and stability of the system, achieving a 100% reduction efficiency for 100 ppm of Cr(VI) and producing ∼1.5 mM H2O2 at 1.8 V. This study presents a feasible strategy for Cr(VI) detoxification and synchronous on-site H2O2 generation, providing a new perspective for innovative Cr(VI) wastewater treatment toward resource utilization.",

      "abstract": "Contamination of agricultural soils with heavy metals (HMs) poses a significant environmental threat, especially because industrial discharges often irrigate agricultural lands. A prominent source of HM(s) pollution occurs from tannery effluents containing high concentrations of chromium (Cr) in both Cr3+ and Cr6+ forms along with other toxic materials. Cr is known for its carcinogenic and mutagenic properties in biological systems. Microbe-assisted phytoremediation has emerged as a promising and environmentally friendly approach for detoxifying Cr-contaminated environments. This study aimed to evaluate the performance of citric acid (CA) and a Cr-reducing bacterial strain (Staphylococcus aureus) on the phytoextraction potential of Lemna minor within a Constructed Wetland System treated with tannery wastewater. Various combinations of tannery wastewater (0, 50, and 100 %), CA (0, 5 and 10 mM), and microbial inoculants were applied to the test plants. The mitigative effects of Staphylococcus aureus strain K1 were examined in combination with different concentrations of CA (0, 5, 10 mM). Data on growth and yield attributes highlighted the beneficial effects of bacterial inoculation and CA in ameliorating Cr toxicity in L. minor, as evidenced by increased foliar chlorophyll and carotenoid contents, enhanced antioxidant enzyme activities (SOD, POD, APX, CAT), and improved nutrient uptake. Specifically, CA application resulted in an enhancement of Cr ranging from 12% to 15% and 23%-31% in concentration, and 134%-141% and 322%-337% in Cr accumulation, respectively. When combined with the S. aureus inoculation treatment, CA application (5 and 10 mM) further increased the concentration and accumulation of Cr in L. minor. The enhancement in Cr ranged from 12% to 23% and 27%-41% in concentration, 68%-75%, and 179%-185% in accumulation, respectively. These results demonstrated that L. minor is an effective choice for environmentally friendly Cr remediation due to its continued ability to grow in polluted wastewater. This study suggested that microbial-assisted phytoextraction combined with chelating agents such as CA could be a practical and effective approach for remediating tannery effluents."

      "abstract": "Accurately ascertaining spatiotemporal distribution of pollution plume is critical for evaluating the effectiveness of remediation technologies and environmental risks associated with contaminated sites. This study concentrated on a typical Cr(VI) contaminated smelter being currently remediated using pump-and-treat (PAT) technology. Long-term on-site monitoring data revealed that two highly polluted regions with Cr(VI) concentrations of 162.9 mg/L and 234.5 mg/L existed within the contaminated site, corresponding to previous chromium slag yard and sewage treatment plant, respectively. The PAT technology showed significant removal performance in these highly polluted areas (>160 mg/L) after six months of pumping, ultimately achieving complete removal of the pollutants in these high-pollution areas. Numerical simulation results showed that although the current remediation scheme significantly reduced the Cr(VI) pollution degree, it did not effectively prevent the incursion of the pollution plume into the downstream residential area after 20 years. Additionally, an improved measure involving supplementary pumping wells was proposed, and its remediation effects were quantitatively evaluated. Results indicated that the environmental pollution risk of groundwater downstream could be effectively mitigated by adding pumping wells, resulting in a reduction of the pollution area by 20 % in the case of adding an internal well and 41 % with the addition of external wells after 20 years. The findings obtained in this study will provide an important reference and theoretical guidance for the reliability analysis and design improvement of the PAT remediation project."

      "abstract": "The Chinese medicine residue (CMR) is composed of wet substances, so using hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) to recover renewable energy from the residue is a suitable treatment method. Chromium (Cr), a kind of heavy metal element, is enriched in hydrochar and severely restricts its effective utilization. An in-depth analysis of the migration path and mechanism of Cr in hydrochar is helpful in promoting energy utilization for CMR. Here, licorice, a significant Chinese medicine, was selected as the example to analyze the evolutions of its pore and chemical structures and their effects on the migration mechanism of Cr during the HTC process. The products obtained under various HTC conditions were analyzed using nitrogen adsorption, FTIR, and 13C NMR. The results show that, considering reaction time and relevant reactions as the primary factors during the HTC process, the migration pathway of Cr in hydrochar undergoes two stages, and they are the accompanying migration stage and the recovery aggregation stage. Active adsorption sites for Cr may exist within the pore structure of hydrochar. In the HTC process, hydrolysis, decarboxylation, and decarbonylation reactions are the direct drivers of Cr migration, while aromatization is the underlying cause of Cr recovery and aggregation. It is hypothesized that Cr catalyzes the acetylene cyclotrimerization reaction, thereby promoting the formation of aromatic structures in hydrochar and integrating into the hydrochar carbon skeleton.",

In the present work, four biohybrid membrane systems were developed as alternatives for the removal of these pollutants, three based on polyvinyl alcohol polymeric mesh (PVA, PVA-magnetite, PVA L-cysteine) and one based on polybutylene adipate terephthalate (PBAT), all associated with bioremediation agents. The efficiency of the bioassociation process was assessed through count methods and microscopy. The removal capacity of these systems was evaluated in synthetic liquid medium, both in the absence and in the presence of soybean (Glycine max L.) seedlings. The content of chromium and arsenic was also analyzed in aerial and hypogeous tissues of seedlings grown on contaminated solid substrate. PVA and PVA-magnetite biohybrid membranes showed the highest removal rates, between 57 and 75% of the initial arsenic content and more than 80% of the initial chromium content after 48 h of treatment, when evaluated in synthetic liquid media with initial concentrations of 2.5 ppm of pentavalent arsenic and 5 ppm of hexavalent chromium, both in presence and absence of seedlings. PVA and PBAT promoted a significant reduction of arsenic translocation to the aerial parts, generally edible, of this crop of agronomic interest. The systems tested showed a high potential for biotechnological applications in matrices affected by the presence of arsenic and chromium.",

      "abstract": "Electrodeposited chromium plating continues to be widely used in a number of specialized areas, such as weapons, transport, aerospace, etc. However, the formation of texture, hydrogen content and residual stress can degrade the serviceability and lead to material failure. The effect of post heat treatment processes on the relationship of texture, hydrogen content, residual stress and corrosion resistance of hexavalent [Cr(VI)] chromium coatings deposited on Cr-Ni-Mo-V steel substrates was investigated. Macrotexture was measured by XRD. Microtexture, dislocation density and grain size were studied by EBSD. With the increase of the heat treatment temperature, it was found that the fiber texture strength of the (222) plane tended to increase and subsequently decrease. Below 600 °C, the increase in the (222) plane texture carried a decrease in the hydrogen content, residual stress, microhardness and an increase in the corrosion resistance. In addition, crack density and texture strength were less affected by the heat treatment time. Notably, relatively fewer crack densities of 219/cm2, a lower corrosion current density of 1.798 × 10-6 A/dm2 and a higher microhardness of 865 HV were found under the preferred heat treatment temperature and time of 380 °C and 4 h, respectively. The hydrogen content and residual stress were 7.63 ppm and 61 MPa, with 86% and 75% reduction rates compared to the as-plated state, respectively. In conclusion, in our future judgement of the influence of heat treatment on coating properties, we can screen or determine to a certain extent whether the heat treatment process is reasonable or not by measuring only the macrotexture."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: With rapid elevation in population, urbanization and industrialization, the environment is exposed to uncontrolled discharge of effluents filled with broad-spectrum toxicity, persistence and long-distance transmission anthropogenic compounds, among them heavy metals. That put our ecosystem on the verge or at a stake of drastic ecological deterioration, which eventually adversely influence on public health. Therefore, this study employed marine fungal strain Rhodotorula sp. MZ312369 for Zn2+ and Cr6+ remediation using the promising calcium carbonate (CaCO3) bioprecipitation technique, for the first time. RESULTS: Initially, Plackett-Burman design followed by central composite design were applied to optimize carbonic anhydrase enzyme (CA), which succeeded in enhancing its activity to 154 U/mL with 1.8-fold increase comparing to the basal conditions. The potentiality of our biofactory in remediating Zn2+ (50 ppm) and Cr6+ (400 ppm) was monitored through dynamic study of several parameters including microbial count, CA activity, CaCO3 weight, pH fluctuation, changing the soluble concentrations of Ca2+ along with Zn2+ and Cr6+. The results revealed that 9.23 × 107 ± 2.1 × 106 CFU/mL and 10.88 × 107 ± 2.5 × 106 CFU/mL of cells exhibited their maximum CA activity by 124.84 ± 1.24 and 140 ± 2.5 U/mL at 132 h for Zn2+ and Cr6+, respectively. Simultaneously, with pH increase to 9.5 ± 0.2, a complete removal for both metals was observed at 168 h; Ca2+ removal percentages recorded 78.99% and 85.06% for Zn2+ and Cr6+ remediating experiments, respectively. Further, the identity, elemental composition, functional structure and morphology of bioremediated precipitates were also examined via mineralogical analysis. EDX pattern showed the typical signals of C, O and Ca accompanying with Zn2+ and Cr6+ peaks. SEM micrographs depicted spindle, spherical and cubic shape bioliths with size range of 1.3 ± 0.5-23.7 ± 3.1 µm. Meanwhile, XRD difractigrams unveiled the prevalence of vaterite phase in remediated samples. Besides, FTIR profiles emphasized the presence of vaterite spectral peaks along with metals wavenumbers. CONCLUSION: CA enzyme mediated Zn2+ and Cr6+ immobilization and encapsulation inside potent vaterite trap through microbial biomineralization process, which deemed as surrogate ecofriendly solution to mitigate heavy metals toxicity and restrict their mobility in soil and wastewater.",

      "abstract": "Metal(loid)s in sewage sludge (SS) are effectively immobilized after pyrolysis. However, the bioavailability and fate of the immobilized metal(loid)s in SS-derived biochar (SSB) following land application remain largely unknown. Here, the speciation and bioavailability evolution of SSB-borne Cr and Zn in soil were systematically investigated by combining pot and field trials and X-ray absorption spectroscopy. Results showed that approximately 58% of Cr existing as Cr(III)-humic complex in SS were transformed into Fe (hydr)oxide-bound Cr(III), while nano-ZnS in SS was transformed into stable ZnS and ferrihydrite-bound species (accounting for over 90% of Zn in SSB) during pyrolysis. All immobilized metal(loid)s, including Cr and Zn, in SSB tended to be slowly remobilized during aging in soil. This study highlighted that SSB acted as a dual role of source and sink of metal(loid)s in soil and posed potential risks by serving a greater role of a metal(loid) source than a sink when applied to uncontaminated soils. Nevertheless, SSB could impede the translocation of metal(loid)s from soil to crop compared to SS, where coexisting elements, including Fe, P, and Zn, played critical roles. These findings provide new insights for understanding the fate of SSB-borne metal(loid)s in soil and assessing the viability of pyrolyzing SS for land application.",

      "abstract": "Heavy metal contamination is an alarming concern on a global scale, as drinking tainted water significantly increases human susceptibility to heavy metals. In a realistic scenario, humans are often exposed to a combination of harmful chemicals rather than a single toxicant. Phloretin (PHL), biochanin-A (BCA), and coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) are bioactive compounds owning plentiful pharmacological properties. Henceforth, the current research explored the putative energizing effects of selected nutraceuticals in combined chromium (Cr) and arsenic (As) intoxicated Swiss albino mice. Potassium dichromate (75 ppm) and sodium meta-arsenite (100 ppm) were given in the drinking water to induce hepatotoxicity, conjugated with PHL and BCA (50 mg/kg each), and CoQ10 (10 mg/kg) intraperitoneally for 2 weeks. After the statistical evaluation, it was observed that the hepato-somatic index, metal load, and antioxidant activity (lipid peroxidation and protein carbonyl content) increased along with the concomitant decrease in the antioxidants (catalase, glutathione-S-transferase, superoxide dismutase, reduced glutathione, and total thiol) in the Cr and As intoxicated mice. Additionally, light microscopy observations, DNA breakages, decreased silent information regulator 1 (SIRT1), nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (Nrf2), heme oxygenase (HO-1), and NAD(P)H quinone dehydrogenase 1 (NQO1) gene expressions, together with stimulated apoptotic cell death manifested by the increased expressions of caspase 8 and caspase 3, thus, proved consistency with the aforementioned outcomes. Importantly, the treatment with nutraceuticals not only restored the antioxidant activity but also favorably altered the expressions of SIRT1, Nrf2, HO-1, and NQO1 signaling and apoptosis markers. These findings highlight the crucial role of the PHL, BCA, and CoQ10 combination in reducing Cr and As-induced hepatotoxicity in mice. By averting the triggered apoptosis in conjunction with oxidative stress, this combination increases the SIRT1, Nrf2, HO-1, and NQO1 signaling, thereby reassuringly maintaining the cellular equilibrium.",

      "abstract": "Layered double hydroxides (LDH-D) and their calcined counterparts, using dolomite as a source of magnesium, were utilized for the immobilization of chromium (Cr(VI)) in soil. The results indicate that LDH-D, both with and without varying calcination temperatures, can effectively immobilize Cr(VI) in soil. Among the different calcination temperatures tested, LDH-D subjected to calcination at 500 °C (LDH-D-500) showed particularly high efficacy. Long-term TCLP experiments demonstrated the inhibition of soil-to-plant transmission of Cr(VI), thereby highlighting the long-lasting immobilization capacity of LDH-D and its calcined derivatives. Furthermore, the analysis of the microbial community's adaptation in post-remediation soil confirmed the durability and bioavailability of LDH-D-500 for Cr immobilization. Examination of the material's morphology and structure after immobilization shed light on the mechanism of immobilization in soil. The results revealed that interlayer anion exchange and surface adsorption were the main factors responsible for the effective immobilization of LDH-D and LDH-D-300. On the other hand, LDH-D-900, with a dominant spinel (MgAl2O4) structure, faced challenges in returning to its original layered configuration, making surface adsorption the primary mechanism for immobilization. LDH-D-500 primarily relied on the structure memory effects of LDHs to immobilize Cr(VI) through structural recovery processes, facilitated by electrostatic attraction and surface adsorption. It is also important to note that CaCO3 plays an important role in adsorption. Additionally, a portion of Cr(VI) was converted to Cr(III) through phenomena such as isomer substitution and complexation adsorption. The proficiency of LDH-D-500 in immobilizing Cr, its ability for instantaneous separation, and the potential for regeneration make it a promising material for remediation of heavy metal-contaminated soil. The investigations suggest that the use of dolomite to create hydrotalcite and calcining it at 500 °C could effectively render environmental Cr inactive, thereby optimizing resource utilization."

This study evaluates the effectiveness of a nanocomposite composed of Rumex Abyssinicus Activated Carbon/Acid Activated Bentonite Clay/Graphene Oxide, and Iron Oxide (RAAC/AABC/GO/Fe3O4) for chromium removal from aqueous solutions. The preparation of the nanocomposite involved precise methods, and its characterization was performed using Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), X-ray Diffraction (XRD), Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area analysis, and the point of zero charge (pHpzc). Batch adsorption experiments were designed using Design Expert software with a central composite design under response surface methodology. The factors investigated included pH (3, 6, and 9), initial Cr (VI) concentration (40, 70, and 100 mg/L), adsorbent dose (0.5, 0.75, 1 g/200 mL), and contact time (60, 90, and 120 min). Adsorption isotherms were analyzed using nonlinearized Langmuir, Freundlich, and Temkin models, while pseudo-first-order and pseudo-second-order models were applied to adsorption kinetics. Characterization revealed a pHpzc of 8.25, a porous and heterogeneous surface (SEM), diverse functional groups (FTIR), an amorphous structure (XRD), and a significant surface area of 1201.23 m2/g (BET). The highest removal efficiency of 99.91% was achieved at pH 6, with an initial Cr (VI) concentration of 70 mg/L, a 90 min contact time, and an adsorbent dose of 1 g/200 mL. Optimization of the adsorption process identified optimal parameters as pH 5.84, initial Cr (VI) concentration of 88.94 mg/L, contact time of 60 min, and adsorbent dose of 0.52 g/200 mL. The Langmuir isotherm model, with an R2 value of 0.92836, best described the adsorption process, indicating a monolayer adsorption mechanism. The pseudo-second-order kinetics model provided the best fit with an R2 value of 0.988. Overall, the nanocomposite demonstrates significant potential as a cost-effective and environmentally friendly solution for chromium removal from wastewater."

WH (Fe3O4/bact) were comparatively studied for the removal of Cr (VI) ions from aqueous solution in batch study. The objectives were to explore the removal of Cr (VI) efficiency by nano-Fe3O4 and Fe3O4/bact under varying bacterial concentrations at a range of acidic pH. Results indicated that 150 ppm Cr (VI) could be effectively removed by 5 g/L of nano-Fe3O4 at pH 4, with the efficiency of 89.2 ± 12%. The equilibrium time, determined by a pseudo-second-order model (R2 = 0.9983), was after 5 h, indicating chemical adsorption. The Cr (VI) removal by the nano-Fe3O4 immobilized with bacterial EPS was effective and steady under a wide range of acidic conditions although bacterial EPS has an alkaline nature. Here, we are the first to demonstrate that Cr (VI) removal efficiency by different concentrations of EPS was not significantly different, suggesting EPS concentration is possibly not the most crucial factor to be optimized for Cr (VI) removal in the future. This study shows the potential application of nano-Fe3O4 immobilized with bacterial EPS for wastewater treatment. PRACTITIONER POINTS: The equilibrium time for magnetite nanoparticles to remove Cr (VI) is 5 h, suggesting chemical adsorption. The Cr (VI) removal efficiency of either magnetite nanoparticles or bacterial EPS is stable under a wide range of acidic conditions.

      "abstract": "Effective management and remediation strategies are crucial to minimize the impacts of both organic and inorganic contaminants on environmental quality and human health. This study investigates a novel approach utilizing cotton shell activated carbon (CSAC), rice husk activated carbon (RHAC), and wasp hive activated carbon (WHAC), produced through alkali treatment and carbonization under N2 atmosphere at 600 °C. The adsorption capacities of biomass-derived mesoporous activated carbons (CSAC, RHAC, WHAC) alongside macroporous commercial activated carbons (CAC) were evaluated for removing rhodamine B (Rh B) and hexavalent chromium (Cr6+). The CSAC exhibits remarkable adsorption efficiency (255.4 mg.g-1) for Cr(VI) removal, while RHAC demonstrates superior efficacy (174.2 mg.g-1) for Rh B adsorption. Investigating various optimal parameters including initial pH (pH 3 for Cr and pH 7 for Rh B), catalyst dosage (200 mg.L-1), and initial concentration (20 mg.L-1), the Redlich-Peterson isotherm model is applied to reveal a hybrid adsorption mechanism encompassing monolayer (chemisorption) and multilayer (van der Waals adsorption) processes. Kinetic analysis highlights the pseudo-second-order and Elovich models as the most suitable, suggesting physiochemisorption mechanisms. Thermodynamic analysis indicates the endothermic nature of the adsorption process, with increased randomness at the solid-solution interface. Isosteric heat investigations using Clausius-Clapeyron, Arrhenius, and Eyring equations reveal a heterogeneous surface nature across all activated carbons. Further confirmation of Rh B and Cr(VI) adsorption onto activated carbons is provided through FTIR, FESEM, and EDAX analysis. This study highlights the innovation and promise of utilizing biomass-derived activated carbons for effective pollutant removal.",

      "abstract": "The accumulation of chromium in renal tissues promotes the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), leading to oxidative stress, genomic and cellular harm, and ultimately necrotic and apoptotic cell death induced by free radicals. Hence, the utilization of antioxidant phytochemicals becomes crucial for cellular defense against oxidative damage. This study endeavors to explore the potential protective effects of an aqueous avocado seed extract (ASE) on rabbit kidneys exposed to chromium-induced damage. Fifteen adult rabbits were distributed into three groups: Group 1 was kept as the control. The second and third groups received a daily dose of K2Cr2O7 (5 mg/kg) intraperitoneally for 2 weeks. While the third group was given an oral dose of ASE (400 mg/kg). In rabbits administered with Cr (VI), kidney homogenates showed a marked increase in Malondialdehyde (MDA) (69.3 ± 4.1 nmol/g) along with a decrease in glutathione (59 ± 5.8 nmol/mg) content and the activity superoxide dismutase (SOD) (0.5 ± 0.05 U/mg protein), glutathione peroxidase (GPx) (16.7 ± 1.1 μmol/mg protein), and catalase (CAT) (73.8 ± 3.9 U/g protein) compared to the levels in control group. Also, the gene expression data for the enzymes SOD, GPx, and CAT dropped dramatically in kidney tissue following Cr (VI) injection. Additionally, Bowman's capsule and glomerulus showed degenerative alterations in the kidney's histopathology and immunohistochemistry. ASE treatment when administered along with Cr (VI) enhanced the activity and gene expression of antioxidant enzymes and improved histopathological conditions. The findings of this study unequivocally show that avocado seed extract, which is rich in phenolic derivatives, is a potent nephroprotective agent that inhibits nephrotoxicity induced by Cr (VI) in rabbits."

      "abstract": "In view of the problems caused by chromium-containing wastewater, such as environmental pollution, biological toxicity, and human health risks. Based on fly ash adsorption and nano-FeS reduction characteristics, fly ash loaded nano-FeS composite (nFeS-FA) was synthesized using mineral supported modification technology and ultrasonic precipitation method. The effect of adsorbent dosage, initial pH, contact time, and initial concentration of the solution on the adsorption of Cr(VI) and total Cr by nFeS-FA was investigated. The characteristics of Cr(VI) and total Cr adsorption by nFeS-FA were studied using adsorption isotherms, adsorption kinetics principles, as well as XRD, TEM, SEM-EDS, and BET analysis. The results demonstrated that under the conditions of nFeS-FA of 8 g/L, initial pH of 4, contact time of 150 min, and initial concentration of the solution at 100 mg/L, nFeS-FA achieved removal efficiency of 87.85 % for Cr(VI) and 71.77 % for total Cr. The adsorption of Cr(VI) and total Cr by nFeS-FA followed the Langmuir model and pseudo-second-order kinetic model, indicating monolayer adsorption with chemical adsorption as the dominant mechanism. XRD, TEM, SEM-EDS, and BET revealed that the flaky nano-FeS was uniformly distributed on the surface of fly ash, exhibiting good dispersion and thereby increasing the specific surface area. During the adsorption experiments, nFeS-FA reacted with Cr(VI), and the generated Fe3+ mainly existed as FeOOH precipitation, while S2- reacted with Cr(III) to produce Cr2S3 precipitation. Therefore, nFeS-FA exhibited excellent adsorption performance towards Cr(VI) and total Cr. It can serve as a technological reference for the remediation of heavy metal chromium pollution in the field of water treatment."

      "abstract": "Hexavalent chromium (Cr(VI)) exposure has been linked with gastrointestinal toxicity, whereas the molecular pathways and key targets remain elusive. Computational toxicology analysis predicted the correlation between protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) and genes regarding Cr(VI)-induced intestinal injury. Here, we generated a mouse model with intestinal epithelium-specific knock out of Ppp2r1a (encoding PP2A Aα subunit) to investigate the mechanisms underlying Cr(VI)-induced small intestinal toxicity. Heterozygous (HE) mice and matched WT littermates were administrated with Cr(VI) at 0, 5, 20, and 80 mg/l for 28 successive days. Cr(VI) treatment led to crypt hyperplasia, epithelial cell apoptosis, and intestinal barrier dysfunction, accompanied by the decline of goblet cell counts and Occludin expression in WT mice. Notably, these effects were aggravated in HE mice, indicating that PP2A Aα deficiency conferred mice with susceptibility to Cr(VI)-induced intestinal injury. The combination of data analysis and biological experiments revealed Cr(VI) exposure could decrease YAP1 phosphorylation at Ser127 but increase protein expression and activity, together with elevated transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif protein driving epithelial crypt cells proliferation following damage, suggesting the involvement of Hippo/YAP1 signaling pathway in Cr(VI)-induced intestinal toxicity. Nevertheless, the enhanced phosphorylation of YAP1 in HE mice resulted in proliferation/repair defects in intestinal epithelium, thereby exacerbating Cr(VI)-induced gut barrier dysfunction. Notably, by molecular docking and further studies, we identified urolithin A, a microbial metabolite, attenuated Cr(VI)-induced disruption of intestinal barrier function, partly by modulating YAP1 expression and activity. Our findings reveal the novel molecular pathways participated in Cr(VI)-caused small intestinal injury and urolithin A could potentially protect against environmental hazards-induced intestinal diseases.",

The subjects were randomized into three groups (27 in each group) and supplemented with one or two tablet(s)/day of FS (groups 1 and 2, respectively), or two tablets/day of placebo (group 3). Blood sampling was carried out at baseline (t0) and after a 3-month treatment (t1), and biochemical parameters associated with glucose and lipid metabolism and kidney and liver toxicity were evaluated. Compared to the placebo, FBG and glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) were significantly (p < 0.001) reduced in group 1 subjects. In contrast, at the doses of one and two tablet(s)/day, the FS exerted no effect on the other parameters examined. We conclude that in subjects with slightly impaired FBG, ingestion of a FS based on Z. mays and G. sylvestre extracts, zinc, and chromium over 3 months lowers FBG and modulates glucose homeostasis by improving glucose metabolism. These beneficial effects occur in the absence of biochemical evidence of kidney and liver toxicity.",

For this purpose, corrosion resistance, massometric tests, and microstructural analysis were applied, considering various aggressive environments (acids, sodium carbonate, and hydrogen peroxide) at different concentrations, treatment temperatures, and saturation times. As a result, corrosion rates, polarization curves, and X-ray microstructures of the uncoated and coated Ti-6Al-4V titanium alloy samples were obtained. Histograms of corrosion inhibition ratio for the chromium-aluminum coatings in various environments were discussed. Overall, the microhardness of the obtained coatings was increased 2.3 times compared with the initial Ti-6Al-4V alloy. The corrosion-resistant chromaluminizing alloy in aqueous solutions of organic acids and hydrogen peroxide was recommended for practical application in conditions of exposure to titanium products."

Hydrophilic surfaces were achieved for the TMS plasma nanocoatings that were deposited onto the coronary stents through NH3/O2 (2:1 molar ratio) plasma post-treatment. With a coating thickness of approximately 20-25 nm, the TMS plasma nanocoatings were highly durable and able to resist delamination and cracking from crimping and expansion by a Model CX with a J-Crimp Station. The stent surface that was evaluated by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Energy-Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDS) showed no indications of pitting, corrosion, or adsorption products on either the luminal or abluminal surfaces of the stents, in contrast to the uncoated stent surface. The TMS plasma nanocoatings significantly enhanced the stent's corrosion resistance in immersion experiments that followed the ASTM F2129-15 corrosion protocol, evident in the increase of the open circuit potential (OCP) from 0.01 V for the uncoated L605 stent to 0.18 V for the plasma-nanocoated L605 stent, reducing potential cytotoxic metal ion release. Cyclic polarization (CP) curves show that the corrosion rate (density level) observed in plasma-nanocoated L605 stents was approximately half an order of magnitude lower than that of the uncoated stents, indicating improved corrosion protection of the stents. CP curves of the TMS plasma-nanocoated stents with different coating thicknesses show that, in the range of 20-65 nm, the coating thickness does not result in any difference in the corrosion resistance of the stents."

Biosorption parameters, such as pH, adsorbent dose, contact time, and initial concentrations of Cr(III) had the most impact on the sorption process. The required pH value for sorption was 5, the biosorbent dose was 4.0 g/L, the contact time was seen to occur after 90 min, and the Cr(III) removal decreased from 98.9 to 92%. The maximum biosorption capacity of chromium was 14.12 mg/g. FTIR analysis of Fucus vesiculosus biomass before the sorption process contains carboxyl, amino, hydroxyl, alkyne, and carbonyl groups, and according to the analysis after the sorption process, it was found that Cr(III) metal ions were incorporated within the sorbent during the interaction with (=C-H) active functional groups. The biosorption data were found to be perfectly suited by Langmuir equilibrium isotherm model. According to the results of this study, Fucus vesiculosus is an effective biosorbent for the removal of Cr(III) from aqueous solutions."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: This comprehensive study investigated the therapeutic potential of α-asarone in mitigating myocardial oxidative damage, primarily induced by hexavalent chromium (Cr(VI)) exposure in mice. METHODS: In this experiment, 24 mice were divided into four groups to assess the cardioprotective role of α-asarone. The study focused on two treatment groups, receiving 25 mg and 50 mg of α-asarone, respectively. These groups were compared against a control group subjected to Cr(VI) without α-asarone treatment, and a normal control negative group. The key biochemical parameters evaluated included serum levels of Creatine Kinase-MB (CK-MB) and Troponin I, markers indicative of myocardial damage. Additionally, the levels of Malondialdehyde (MDA) were measured to assess lipid peroxidation, alongside the evaluation of key inflammatory biomarkers in cardiac tissue homogenates, such as Tumor Necrosis Factor-α (TNF-α) and Interleukin-1β (IL-1β). Results Remarkably, α-asarone treatment resulted in a significant reduction in these markers compared to the control group. The treatment also elevated the activity of cardinal antioxidant enzymes like catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD), and reduced the glutathione (GSH). Furthermore, a notable upregulation of Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor Gamma (PPAR-γ) in cardiac tissue homogenates was observed, highlighting a potential pathway through which α-asarone exerts its protective effects. Histopathological analysis of cardiac tissues revealed that α-asarone ameliorated the structural lesions induced by Cr(VI). The study thus provides substantial evidence that α-asarone ameliorates Cr(VI)-induced cardiotoxicity through a multifaceted approach. It enhances cardiac enzyme function, modulates free radical generation, improves antioxidant status, and mitigates histopathological damage in cardiac tissues. Given these findings, α-asarone emerges as a promising agent against Cr(VI)-induced myocardial injury. PURPOSE: This study paves the way for further research into the cardioprotective properties of α-asarone and its potential application in clinical settings by specifically exploring the protective efficacy of α-asarone against Cr(VI)-induced cardiotoxicity and delineating the underlying biochemical and molecular mechanisms involved.",

      "abstract": "Arsenic-hyperaccumulator Pteris vittata exhibits remarkable absorption ability for chromium (Cr) while beneficial element selenium (Se) helps to reduce Cr-induced stress in plants. However, the effects of Se on the Cr uptake and the associated mechanisms in P. vittata are unclear, which were investigated in this study. P. vittata plants were grown for 14 days in 0.2-strength Hoagland solution containing 10 (Cr10) or 100 μM (Cr100) chromate (CrVI) and 1 μM selenate (Se1). The plant biomass, malondialdehyde contents, total Cr and Se contents, Cr speciation, expression of genes associated with Cr uptake, and Cr subcellular distribution in P. vittata were determined. P. vittata effectively accumulated Cr by concentrating 96-99% in the roots under Cr100 treatment. Further, Se substantially increased its Cr contents by 98% to 11,596 mg kg-1 in the roots, which may result from Se's role in reducing its oxidative stress as supported by 27-62% reduction in the malondialdehyde contents. Though supplied with CrVI, up to 98% of the Cr in the roots was reduced to insoluble chromite (CrIII), with 83-89% being distributed on root cell walls. Neither Cr nor Se upregulated the expression of sulfate transporters PvSultr1;1-1;2 or phosphate transporter PvPht1;4, indicating their limited role in Cr uptake. P. vittata effectively accumulates Cr in the roots mainly as CrIII on cell walls and Se effectively enhances its Cr uptake by reducing its oxidative stress. Our study suggests that Se can be used to enhance P. vittata Cr uptake and reduce its oxidative stress, which may have application in phytostabilization of Cr-contaminated soils.",

Gel permeation chromatography (GPC), using Bio-Gel P-10 column, of the oligosaccharides product of fermentation revealed that P. pastoris effectively fermented polysaccharides as no long chain polysaccharides were observed. At 200 µg/mL, fractions DF73, DF53, DF72, and DF62 exhibited DPPH radical scavenging activity of 92.22 ± 2.69%, 90.35 ± 0.43%, 88.83 ± 3.36%, and 88.83 ± 3.36%, respectively. The antioxidant potential of the fermentation product was further confirmed through in vitro H2O2 radical scavenging assay. Among the screened samples, the highest H2O2 radical scavenging activity was displayed by DF73, which stabilized the free radicals by 88.83 ± 0.38%, followed by DF53 (86.48 ± 0.83%), DF62 (85.21 ± 6.66%), DF72 (79.9 4± 1.21%), and EPP (77.76 ± 0.53%). The oligosaccharide treatment significantly alleviated chromium-induced liver damage, as evident from the increase in weight gain, improved liver functions, and reduced histopathological alterations in the albino mice. A distinctly increased level of lipid peroxide (LPO) free radicals along with the endogenous hepatic enzymes were evident in chromium induced hepatotoxicity in mice. However, oligosaccharides treatment mitigated these effects by reducing the LPO production and increasing ALT, ALP, and AST levels, probably due to relieving the oxidative stress. DNA fragmentation assays illustrated that Cr(VI) exposure induced massive apoptosis in liver by damaging the DNA which was then remediated by oligosaccharides supplementation. Histopathological observations confirmed that the oligosaccharide treatment reverses the architectural changes in liver induced by chromium. These results suggest that oligosaccharides obtained from cress seed mucilage polysaccharides through P. pastoris fermentation ameliorate the oxidative stress and apoptosis and act as hepatoprotective agent against chromium-induced liver injury."

      "abstract": "Sodium nitroprusside (SNP) is a potent nitric oxide (NO) donor that enhances plant tolerance to various abiotic stresses. This research aims to assess the effect of SNP application on rice seedlings subjected to individual and combined exposure to two abiotic stresses viz., low-temperature (LT) and chromium (Cr). Exposure to LT, Cr, and LT+Cr caused severe oxidative damage by stimulating greater production and accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) leading to lipid peroxidation and cell membrane instability. The combined LT+CR stress more intensly increased the cellular oxidative stress and excessive Cr uptake that in turn deteriorated the chlorophyll pigments and photosynthesis, as well as effected the level of tetrapyrrole biosynthesis in rice plants. The reduction in rice seedling growth was more obvious under LT+Cr treatment than their individual effects. The exogenous application of SNP diminished the toxic impact of LT and Cr stress. This was attributed to the positive role of SNP in regulating the endogenous NO levels, free amino acids (FAAs) contents, tetrapyrrole biosynthesis and antioxidants. Consequently, SNP-induced NO decreased photorespiration, ROS generation, lipid peroxidation, and electrolyte leakage. Moreover, exogenous SNP diminished the Cr uptake and accumulation by modulating the ionic homeostasis and strengthening the heavy metals detoxification mechanism, thus improving plant height, biomass and photosynthetic indexes. Essentially, SNP boosts plant tolerance to LT and Cr stress by regulating antioxidants, detoxification mechanism, and the plant's physio-biochemical. Hence, applying SNP is an effective method for boosting rice plant resilience and productivity in the face of escalating environmental stresses and pollutants.",

      "abstract": "Heavy metals, a major source of pollution in the environment, pose a substantial threat due to their non-biodegradability and ability to accumulate in living organisms, causing health problems. Recently, researchers have been searching for cost-effective and safe ways to remove heavy metals from polluted waterways using agricultural waste substitutes. The present study focused on the low-cost treatments for the reduction of chromium Cr+6 metal from the effluent, wherein it has been found that chemically and bacterially treated agro-waste had increased heavy metal ion adsorption capabilities. A sequential optimization of the process parameters was attempted using Plackett-Burman design (PBD) and central composite design of response surface methodology (CCD-RSM) for the maximum reduction of the chromium metal from the effluent. A total of eight parameters were screened out using a 12-run PBD experiment. Out of the eight parameters, time, HCl, NaOH, and bacterial treatments were found to be significantly affecting the maximum reduction of Cr+6 from the effluent. To investigate the interactions' effects of the chosen parameters, they were evaluated using CCD-RSM. Maximum 74% Cr+6 reduction was achieved under the optimum treatment to rice husk of HCl 4.52 N, NaOH 3.53 N, bacterial suspension 7.41%, and with an interaction time 14.32 min using 30 run CCD-RSM experiment. A scanning electron microscope was used to confirm the effects of selected variables on the agro-waste for the Cr+6 reductions, as well as a Fourier transform infrared spectrometer.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a debilitating disease mainly treated by DMARDs. Baricitinib is one of the emerging DMARDs with strong anti-rheumatic effects but has serious side effects. Trivalent chromium (Cr III) is a natural element with anti-inflammatory properties. Trivalent chromium (Cr III) is introduced for the first time to study its effect and safety in treatment of RA patients and compared to those of baricitinib. METHODS: This is a phase 2/3 randomized controlled trial where RA patients were divided in a ratio of 2:1 according to the newly introduced medication either Cr (III) (group A) or baricitinib (group B). Patients attended three visits on day 0, after 3 weeks and 12 weeks, disease activity was scored. Hands ultrasound was done and reassessed. Side effects were monitored throughout the study. RESULTS: DAS28-CRP improved by 26.9% and 11.8% on third visit for Cr III and baricitinib, respectively (p = 0.001). DAS28-ESR improved by 25.6% and 7.74% on third visit for Cr III and baricitinib, respectively (p =  < 0.001). ACR 50 was 18.8% for Cr III and 5.7% for baricitinib on second visit. ACR 70 was 25% for Cr III and 0% for baricitinib on third visit (P =  < 0.001). Ultrasound GLOESS, SH, PDUS, joints effusions improved by 38.9%, 38.4%, 56.7% and 74.8% for Cr III, while by 10.5%, 3.75%, 59.6% and worsening of joints effusions happened with baricitinib on third visit. p = 0.022 and 0.002 between groups for GLOESS and SH improvement, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Cr III has shown very promising fast clinical and sonographic results in treating RA patients which were surprisingly superior to baricitinib in most aspects. Furthermore, Cr III is potentially safe with evidently fewer side effects than baricitinib and other DMARDs, however, long-term safety is still not established.

Parallel removal mechanisms such as adsorption of chromium on ferrihydrite and direct reduction at the cathode is assumed negligible due to low concentration of Cr(VI). The reaction model presented for batch system represents species complexation, precipitation/dissolution, acid/base, and oxidation-reduction reactions. Batch reactor simulation is verified using experimental data obtained by Sarahney et al. (2012), where the effect of initial chromium concentration, pH, volumetric current density, and ionic strength is considered (Sarahney et al., 2012). The model couples multicomponent ionic transport in MATLAB with chemical reaction model in PHREEQC, as a widely used computational programming tool and a geochemical reaction simulator with comprehensive geochemistry databases. The suggested current density is 0.05-0.3mA/cm2 and the surface to volume ratio in batch reactor is considered 0.017 1/cm. Design parameters are presented for operation of a flow-through hexavalent chromium removal using electrocoagulation by iron electrode to treat Cr(VI) in range of 10-50 mg/L. The operational parameters for a flow-through EC reactor for Cr(VI) removal is suggested to follow [Formula: see text] ."

      "abstract": "The growing concern of water pollution is a critical issue stemming from industrialization and urbanization. One of the specific concerns within this broader problem is the toxicity associated with chromium (Cr), especially in its Cr (VI) form. Transition metal carbides/nitrides (MXenes) are attractive materials for the treatment of water due to their unique properties such as layered structure, high surface area, conductivity, flexibility, scalable manufacture, and surface functions. Adsorption and photocatalysis reactions are the two promising methods for the removal of Cr (VI) by using MXenes. Still, most of the previous reviews were limited to the single application area. Hence, this review covers recent developments in MXene-based composites, highlighting their dual role as both adsorbents and photocatalysts in the removal of Cr (VI). MXene-based composites are found to be effective in both adsorption and photodegradation of Cr (VI). Most MXene-based composites have demonstrated exceptional removal efficiency for Cr (VI), achieving impressive adsorption capacities ranging from 100 to 1500 mg g-1 and degradation percentages between 80% and 100% in a relatively short period. The active functional groups present on the surface of MXene have a viable impact on the adsorption and photodegradation performance. The mechanism of Cr (VI) removal is explained, with MXenes playing a key role in electrostatic attraction for adsorption and as co-catalysts in photocatalysis. However, MXene-based composites have limitations such as instability, competition with co-existing ions, and regeneration challenges. Further research is needed to address these limitations. Additionally, MXene-based composites hold promise for addressing water contamination, heavy metal removal, hydrogen production, energy storage, gas sensing, and biomedical applications.",
