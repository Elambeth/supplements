      "abstract": "Inulin, a natural dietary fiber, has various health-promoting bioactivities. However, the impacts of dietary inulin on duck productivity and overall health remain unclear. This study investigated the effects of inulin supplementation on systemic health and its underlying mechanisms by integrating the microbiota and metabolome analyses. One hundred twenty 16-day-old male Cherry Valley ducks with similar initial body weight (BW) were randomly assigned to 20 cages, with two treatments (6 ducks/cage and 10 cages/treatment): a basal diet (CON group) or a basal diet supplemented with 25 g inulin/kg (INU group). The 18-d feeding trials demonstrated that ducks fed the inulin-supplemented diet presented significantly improved growth performance, bone health, and meat quality compared with those in the control group (P < 0.05). Additionally, inulin supplementation reshaped the intestinal microbiota, increasing diversity and the abundance of Alistipes, Ligilactobacillus, and Streptococcus (P < 0.05). Metabolome analysis revealed that inulin feeding significantly modulated 13 metabolites (P < 0.05), which were enriched primarily in health-related metabolic pathways such as taurine and hypotaurine metabolism, steroid hormone biosynthesis, and histidine metabolism. Correlation analysis revealed a positive relationship among the modulated microbes and metabolites and improved healthy parameters. Overall, inulin supplementation improved the bone and muscle health of ducks by specifically modulating key gut microbes, metabolites, and associated metabolic pathways. These findings suggest that inulin supplementation represents a feasible nutritional strategy for improving the meat quality and bone health of intensively raised ducks.",

      "abstract": "This study investigated whether the supplementation of prebiotic inulin to gestating sows programmatically affects offspring growth performance and meat quality while exploring its epigenetic effects through histone acetylation modulation. After mating, sixty multiparous sows (Landrace × Yorkshire; parity 2-3) were assigned to a 2 × 2 factorial arrangement with inulin (0% vs. 1.5%) and fat (0% or 5%) supplementation until farrowing. Post-weaning, five litters (10 piglets per litter) per treatment were selected and maintained in their original litter for fattening under standardized feeding. The results demonstrated that maternal inulin supplementation during gestation accomplished the following: (1) Increased offspring liver index by 13.4% at weaning and 6.8% at finishing (p < 0.05) while reducing the finishing-phase backfat thickness by 11.6% (p < 0.01), with a significant inulin × fat interaction attenuating fat-induced abdominal lipid accumulation at weaning (p = 0.05). (2) Decreased longissimus dorsi muscle lightness (L*) by 4.5% in finishing pigs (p = 0.02) without altering the other meat quality parameters. (3) Suppressed offspring liver lipid deposition at birth and finishing (p < 0.05), concomitant with upregulated hepatic PGC-1α and CPT1A expression (p < 0.05). (4) Elevated neonatal serum butyrate by 15.6% (p = 0.06) while inhibiting hepatic histone deacetylase (HDAC) activity and enhancing histone H3/H4 acetylation (p < 0.01). These findings suggest that maternal inulin supplementation during gestation mitigates offspring hepatic lipid deposition through butyrate-mediated epigenetic regulation, where microbial-derived butyrate from inulin fermentation inhibits HDAC activity, enhances histone acetylation levels, and upregulates fatty acid β-oxidation gene expression. This study provides novel mechanistic insights into how maternal dietary fiber nutrition programs offspring development through epigenetic reprogramming."

Fifty 7-week-old SPF-grade C57BL/6J male mice were used as experimental subjects and analysed. This study compared the structural and functional characteristics of food intake, body weight changes, serum appetite hormone levels, and intestinal flora of mice in different doses of inulin intervention and control groups in two distinct environments: plains and the rush-into plateau. The results demonstrated that inulin influenced the functional characteristics of the gut microbiota of mice in terms of energy production, conversion, carbohydrate transport, and metabolism. Furthermore, inulin enhanced the secretion of appetite hormones, resulting in appetite promotion under acute plateau conditions by increasing the relative abundance of beneficial bacteria. In addition, inulin significantly improved the body weight of mice under plateau conditions, particularly in the mid- and high-dose groups of inulin-treated mice.",

The immunomodulatory and intestinal protective effects of ITF were investigated on immunosuppressive mice. Male BALB/c mice were pretreated with cyclophosphamide (Cy) for 3 days to establish an immunosuppressive model followed by ITF treatment. The results demonstrated that compared with the model group, ITF administration significantly increased immune organ index (P<0.05), alleviated intestinal villus damage, stimulated serum cytokine secretion including Ig G, IL-4, IL-6, IL-2, TNF-α, and INF-γ (P<0.05), upregulated the expression of Occludin and Claudin-1 (P<0.05), and increased CD4+ and CD8+ T cells of ileum in Cy-induced mice (P<0.05). Furthermore, ITF restored the intestinal microbiota dysbiosis caused by Cy by increasing the abundance of Muribaculaceae, Blautia, Odoribacter, Lactobacillus and decreasing the abundance of Lachnospiraceae_NK4A136_group (P<0.05). Meanwhile, ITF increased the production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) including acetic acid, propionic acid and butyric acid (P<0.05). These results indicated that ITF can ameliorate cyclophosphamide-induced immunosuppression and intestinal barrier injury, and restore gut microbiota dysbiosis. This study provided important evidences for the immunomodulatory and intestinal protective effects of the ITF from C. pilosula."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Fecal microbial transplantation (FMT) is an important technology for treating diarrhea and enteritis. Additionally, FMT has been applied to improve productivity, alter abnormal behavior, relieve stress, and reduce burdens. However, some previous studies have reported that FMT may cause stress in acceptor animals. Inulin, a prebiotic, can promote growth, enhance immunity, and balance the gut microbiota. Currently, there are limited reports on the effects of combining FMT with inulin on early growth performance in chicks. RESULTS: In this study, a total of 90 1-day-old chicks were randomly divided into the control group (CON), FMT group, and inulin group (INU). The CON group was fed a basic diet, whereas the FMT and INU groups received fecal microbiota transplantation and FMT with inulin treatment, respectively. Compared with the FMT and CON groups, the INU group presented significantly greater average daily gain (ADG) and average daily feed intake (ADFI) values (P < 0.05). However, the organ indices did not significantly change (P > 0.05). The ratio of the villi to crypts in the ileum significantly differed at 21 and 35 days (P < 0.05). In addition, the cecum concentrations of acetic acid and butyric acid significantly increased in the INU group (P < 0.05). In addition, gut inflammation and serum inflammation decreased in the INU group, and immune factors increased after inulin supplementation. (P < 0.05). Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes were the dominant phyla, with more than 90% of all sequences being identified as originating from these two phyla. Inulin supplementation during mother-sourced microbial transplantation significantly increased the abundance of Rikenella, Butyricicoccus, and [Ruminococcus], which contributed positively to the promotion of early intestinal health and facilitated the early growth of chicks. CONCLUSION: The results of this study suggest that inulin supplementation in maternal fecal microbiota transplantation can effectively promote early growth and probiotic colonization, which favors the health of chicks.

      "abstract": "The glycoside hydrolase (GH) family 91 inulin fructotransferase (IFTase) complexes from Bacteroides ovatus and B. caccae act as endo-type IFTases targeting inulin. However, their degradation mechanism remains unclear. Herein, the exact structure of the accumulated inulin-degradation product in a culture supernatant is revealed as linear oligo-(2 → 1)-β-d-fructofuranosides linked to difructose dianhydride III (DFA III) at the reducing end. Additionally, we developed a method to quantify endo-IFTase activity by measuring DFA III released from inulin after sequential treatment with endo-IFTase and GH32 β-d-fructofuranosidase. Using this approach, we investigated the effect of varying concentrations of endo-IFTase subunits 1 and 2 and found that an equimolar mixture of the two subunits exhibited the highest enzymatic activity, indicating that the active complex forms in a 1:1 ratio. The endo-IFTase accepts fructooligosaccharide DP7 (GF6) as the shortest substrate, suggesting that the complex recognizes the region between subsites +3 and - 3. This study provides insights into the understanding of inulin degradation by Bacteroides species and elucidates the molecular mechanisms underlying prebiotic effects of inulin."

      "abstract": "In northern China, haze events frequently occur during winter, and PM2.5 is recognized as the most significant particulate matter in haze, posing a major threat to human health. Therefore, we employed a PM2.5 inhalation exposure system to investigate the protective effects of Platycodon grandiflorum inulin-type fructan (PGPI-1-a) on low-concentration PM2.5-induced lung microenvironment changes. Our findings revealed that long-term (4-month) PM2.5 exposure did not cause apparent pathological alterations in rat lungs but induced lung inflammation, which was alleviated by PGPI-1-a intervention. Multi-omics analysis demonstrated that PGPI-1-a restored abnormally expressed lung proteins, improved lung microbiota disorders, and regulated serum metabolite imbalances related to lipid and amino acid metabolism, ameliorating low-concentration PM2.5-induced lung microenvironment changes. These results suggest that Platycodon grandiflorum inulin-type fructan could serve as a potential dietary supplement for mitigating PM2.5-induced lung injury."

      "abstract": "The management of metabolic disorder associated with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) has been suggested as an effective approach to improve PCOS which is highly involved with gut microbiota, while the underlying mechanism is unclear. Here, we investigated the role of inulin, a gut microbiota regulator, in the alleviation of PCOS. Our findings showed that inulin treatment significantly improved hyperandrogenism and glucolipid metabolism in both PCOS cohort and mice. Consistent with the cohort, inulin increased the abundance of microbial co-abundance group (CAG) 12 in PCOS mice, including Bifidobacterium species and other short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs)-producers. We further verified the enhancement of SCFAs biosynthesis capacity and fecal SCFAs content by inulin. Moreover, inulin decreased lipopolysaccharide-binding protein (LBP) and ameliorated ovarian inflammation in PCOS mice, whereas intraperitoneal lipopolysaccharide (LPS) administration reversed the protective effects of inulin. Furthermore, fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) from inulin-treated patients with PCOS enhanced insulin sensitivity, improved lipid accumulation and thermogenesis, reduced hyperandrogenism and ovarian inflammatory response in antibiotic-treated mice. Collectively, these findings revealed that gut microbiota mediates the beneficial effects of inulin on metabolic disorder and ovarian dysfunction in PCOS. Therefore, modulating gut microbiota represents a promising therapeutic strategy for PCOS."

      "abstract": "Inulin consumption and dihydrogen (H2) administration both exert antitumor effects on preclinical models as well as in clinical trials. As H2 is one of the major byproducts of inulin fermentation by bacterial species of the gut microbiota (GM), we hypothesized that H2 could mediate the antitumor effects of inulin. To provide evidence in favor of this hypothesis, we first determined the pattern of H2-exposure to which mice are subjected after inulin administration and developed an inhaled hydrogen therapy (H2T) protocol replicating this pattern. We then compared the effects on circulating immunity of a two-week daily inulin gavage with those of the corresponding H2T. We also compared the effects of inulin supplementation to those of the corresponding H2T on implanted melanoma growth and infiltration by T lymphocytes. Inulin and H2T induced a similar increase in circulating CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. In addition, both treatments similarly inhibited melanoma tumor growth. These results support a mechanism by which the H2 resulting from inulin fermentation by the GM diffuses across the intestinal barrier and stimulates the immunosurveillance responsible for the antitumor effect.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: To investigate the therapeutic effects of inulin-type oligosaccharides of Morinda officinalis (IOMO) in a murine model of Streptococcus pneumoniae meningitis (SPM) and explore its possible mechanisms. METHODS: A total of 120 male C57BL/6J mice were randomly assigned into Sham, SPM+Saline, SPM+IOMO (25 mg/kg), and SPM+IOMO (50 mg/kg) groups. After modeling, the mice received daily gavage of saline or IOMO at the indicated doses for 7 consecutive days, and the changes in symptom scores and mortality of the mice were monitored. Brain pathology and neuronal injury of the mice were assessed using HE and Nissl staining, and qRT-PCR was performed to detect mRNA levels of the inflammatory mediators. Brain edema and blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability of the mice were evaluated by measuring brain water content and Evans blue (EB) staining; Western blotting was used to analyze the expressions of BBB-associated proteins, and flow cytometry was employed to detect IFN‑γ expression level in the infiltrating lymphocytes. Open-field test (OFT) and novel object recognition test (NORT) were conducted to assess learning and memory ability of the mice on day 21 after modeling. RESULTS: IOMO treatment at 50 mg/kg significantly reduced the symptom scores and mortality rate of SPM mice, alleviated brain damage, and downregulated mRNA levels of IL-6, TNF‑α, IL-1β, IL-18, IFN‑γ, iNOS, NLRP3, ASC, caspase-1 and GSDMD in the brain tissue. IOMO treatment also decreased brain water content and EB leakage, upregulated VE-cadherin and occludin expressions, and suppressed AQP4, iNOS, and IFN‑γ levels of the mice. IOMO-treated mice exhibited improved learning and memory compared with the saline-treated mice on day 21 after SPM modeling. CONCLUSIONS: IOMO alleviates SPM symptoms, reduces mortality, and mitigates cognitive deficits in mice possibly by suppressing cerebral inflammation and protecting BBB functions.",

      "abstract": "Inulin-type fructan CP-A, the main component of Codonopsis pilosula polysaccharides, has been found to have therapeutic effects on ulcerative colitis (UC). Herein, we established a colitis-associated cancer (CAC) mouse model by azomethane (AOM) and dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) and selected mouse colon cancer cells CT-26 to explore the therapeutic effects of the combined administration of CP-A and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) in vivo and in vitro. High-throughput transcriptomics sequencing technology was used to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the mouse colon and enrich related pathways. 16S rRNA gene sequencing technology was used for gut microbiota research to identify microbial changes in mouse feces. Short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) content was identified in the mouse colon using gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy (GC-MS). In vivo experiments showed that compared with untreated CAC mice, those treated with the combined administration of CP-A and 5-FU had significantly restored body weight, fewer tumors, smaller tumor volume, and reduced disease activity index (DAI) and histopathological scores. The combination of CP-A and 5-FU increased the anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin 10 (IL-10) and inhibited the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin 6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and interferon-gamma (IFN-γ). In vitro experiments indicated that a combination of CP-A and 5-FU promoted the apoptosis of CT-26 cells. The results of transcriptomics studies suggested that the therapeutic effect of the combined administration of CP-A and 5-FU on CAC may be related to the EGFR/AKT/ERK pathway. Both in vivo and in vitro experiments verified the regulatory effect of the combined administration of CP-A and 5-FU on the EGFR/AKT/ERK pathway. Moreover, the intestinal flora experiment manifested that compared with untreated CAC mice, the combined CP-A and 5-FU group had a more stable intestinal microbiota composition, and the combined administration of CP-A and 5-FU increased the abundance of SCFAs. Our experimental findings have demonstrated that the combination of CP-A and 5-FU exhibits promising efficacy in the treatment of CAC, warranting further clinical investigation in the future."

      "abstract": "Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a component of the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria, triggers inflammatory responses in intestinal epithelial cells. This activation leads to the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines which disrupt cellular homeostasis. LPS also impairs the integrity of the intestinal epithelial barrier by downregulating tight junction proteins, resulting in increased intestinal permeability. This compromised barrier function can allow further translocation of luminal antigens, perpetuating inflammation and contributing to gut-related disorders such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and metabolic endotoxemia. This study investigated the therapeutic effects of inulin, a prebiotic dietary fiber, in attenuating LPS-induced intestinal epithelial barrier dysfunction. Caco-2 cells were treated with 100 ng/mL of LPS for 12 h, resulting in increased gene expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, TNF-α, and IL-18) and a significant downregulation of tight junction proteins claudin-1 and claudin-2, while occludin gene expression remained unaffected. Pretreatment with 2% inulin for 24 h before LPS exposure prevented the downregulation of claudin-1 and claudin-2 and significantly upregulated occludin gene expression. These molecular findings were supported by functional assays using transwell systems. LPS treatment increased paracellular permeability of the Caco-2 monolayer, indicating barrier dysfunction, while inulin pretreatment mitigated this effect. These results demonstrate that inulin can modulate tight junction protein expression and maintain gut barrier integrity under inflammatory conditions."

      "abstract": "Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is pathologically associated with gut microbiota imbalance, which is implicated in disease progression through metabolic and inflammatory pathways. The therapeutic potential of inulin, a well-characterized prebiotic, has been explored to mitigate T2DM via microbiota modulation. However, the efficacy of this intervention, with its performance dependent on the degree of polymerization (DP), requires further investigation. This study assessed the therapeutic roles of inulin (DP3-60) and fructo-oligosaccharides (FOS, DP3-10) in T2DM management. Dietary administration of these prebiotic compounds demonstrated a significant capacity to alleviate multiple metabolic pathologies, including obesity, insulin resistance, systemic inflammation, oxidative stress, dyslipidemia and hepatic steatosis in high-fat diet (HFD)-fed induced T2DM mice. Significant superior efficacy was observed in FOS for ameliorating glucose metabolic dysregulation, adipocyte hypertrophy, liver weight, and histopathological alterations in colonic tissue, while inulin exhibited greater potency in alleviating oxidative stress. Both inulin and FOS enhanced gut microbiota diversity and richness in T2DM mice, accompanied by a significant reduction in Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio. Notably, the S24-7 family emerged as a crucial microbial taxon modulated by both inulin and FOS. Furthermore, FOS demonstrated superior capacity to restore HFD-induced gut microbiota. Taxonomically significant amplicon sequence variants (ASVs), which were altered by HFD and modulated by inulin and FOS, exhibited distinct taxonomic profiles between the two compounds. This study provides preliminary evidence that the biological effects and beneficial properties of inulin-type fructans exhibit DP-dependent variations, which may enhance their efficient utilization in metabolic disorders."

However, at the same ultrasound power, the dispersion of TMPs-inulin droplets is not as good as that of MPs-inulin droplets, indicating that thermal denaturation is not conducive to emulsion stability.

Excessive production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) at the inflammatory sites leads to the onset and progression of IBD. And the current non-invasive imaging methods are not ideal for the diagnosis and monitoring of IBD. METHODS: Herein, we developed inulin (IN)-coated cerium oxide nanoparticles (CeO2@IN NPs) for treatment and monitoring of IBD guided by computed tomography (CT). The physicochemical properties, ROS scavenging ability and CT imaging capabilities of CeO2@IN were investigated in vitro. Moreover, the therapeutic and targeted inflammation imaging effects of CeO2@IN were validated in dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis model. RESULTS: CeO2@IN with catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) capabilities effectively scavenged ROS, thus protecting the cells against oxidative stress. In colitis model mice, orally administered CeO2@IN successfully traversed the gastrointestinal tract to reach the colon under the protection of IN, and effectively reduced intestinal inflammation, thereby maintaining the intestinal epithelial integrity. Notably, CeO2@IN performed better than conventional CT contrast agents for gastrointestinal tract imaging, particularly in detecting the inflamed areas in the colon. In addition, CeO2@IN exhibited excellent biocompatibility in vitro and in vivo. CONCLUSION: The study provided a novel integrated diagnostic and therapeutic tool for the treatment and monitoring of IBD, presenting great potential as a clinical application for IBD.",

When the ultrasonic power is 300 W, the protein polymerization can be promoted, thus improving the gluten network. The mechanical action and cavitation induced by ultrasound changed the water distribution of FXL dough and promoted the transition from weakly bound water to tightly bound water. The T21 value (tightly bound water relaxation time) was shortened from 0.25 to 0.16 and the A21 (tightly bound water content) was reduced from 6.35 to 5.18, an improvement of 22.6 %, at a power of 300 W. Ultrasound decreased the enthalpy of FXL dough, and increased the particle size and potential of gluten protein. The introduction of ultrasound increased the content of β-sheets structure (40.85) at 250 W. The microstructure of the FXL dough revealed that ultrasonic treatment induced a continuous tight membrane-like gluten network, while the application of 500 W ultrasonic power resulted in the exposure and depression of starch particles.",

Integrating intestinal environment regulation and molecularly targeted drugs are more attractive strategies. This study aimed to developed an oral colonic targeted delivery system (5-Flu/MET@MSNs/Ce6@HIL) using hyaluronic acid (HA) and inulin (IN) as key components. IN is a polymer with colon-specific targeting capabilities, while HA targets CD44 on the surface of colon cancer cells. We used IN and HA-modified liposomes to co-encapsulate three therapeutic agents, chemotherapy drug 5-Fluorouracil (5-Flu), photosensitizer chlorin e6 (Ce6), and hypoxia reliever metformin (MET). 5-Flu and Ce6 effectively induced cell apoptosis, whereas MET downregulated Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1-α (HIF-1α) and alleviate the hypoxic microenvironment. In orthotopic colon-tumor-bearing-mice, the final product of 5-Flu@MET@MSNs/Ce6@HIL effectively hindered growth of tumors, which was inhibited by 3.31, 14.31, and 7.88 times when compared to 5-Flu, MET, or Ce6 single-loaded formulations, respectively. Furthermore, after oral administration, the multifunctional liposomes showed good in vivo safety and compliance. In conclusion, this study proposes a novel orthotopic colon-targeted cancer treatment strategy with accurate tumor targeting capabilities, which has certain potential and development value in future clinical applications.",

This study aims to investigate the effect of DF placebo-controlled intervention in patients suffering from AUD during a three-week period of alcohol withdrawal, in order to discover microbial-derived metabolites that could be involved in metabolic and behavioral status. METHODS: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was performed with 50 AUD patients supplemented with inulin (prebiotic DF) or maltodextrin (placebo) during 17 days. Fecal microbiota composition, plasma and fecal metabolomics (liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry), blood markers of inflammation and hepatic alterations, and psychological assessment (questionnaires) were analyzed before and after the intervention. RESULTS: Fecal metabolomics revealed 14 metabolites significantly modified by inulin versus placebo treatment (increased N8-acetylspermidine and decreased indole-3-butyric acid, 5-amino valeric acid betaine (5-AVAB) and bile acids). Thirteen plasma metabolites differentiated both treatments (higher levels of long-chain fatty acids, medium-chain acylcarnitines and sphingomyelin species, and reduced 3-methylhistidine by inulin versus placebo). Fecal Lachnoclostridium correlated with 6 of the identified fecal metabolites, whereas plasma lipidic moieties positively correlated with fecal Ruminococcus torques group and Flavonifractor. Interestingly, parameters reflecting liver alterations inversely correlated with sphingomyelin (SM 36:2). CONCLUSIONS: Three weeks of inulin supplementation during alcohol withdrawal leads to specific and different changes in the plasma and fecal metabolome of AUD patients, some of these gut microbiota-related metabolites being correlated with liver function.

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) has increased in recent years. Alongside traditional pharmacological treatments, nutritional therapy has emerged as a crucial aspect of T2DM management. Inulin, a fructan-type soluble fiber that promotes the growth of probiotic species like Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus, is commonly used in nutritional interventions for T2DM. However, it remains unclear which type of T2DM patients are suitable for inulin intervention. The aim of this study was to predict the effectiveness of inulin treatment for T2DM using a machine learning model. METHODS: Original data were obtained from a previous study. After screening T2DM patients, feature election was conducted using LASSO regression, and a machine learning model was developed using XGBoost. The model's performance was evaluated based on accuracy, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value and further analyzed using receiver operating curves, calibration curves, and decision curves. RESULTS: Out of the 758 T2DM patients included, 477 had their glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels reduced to less than 6.5% after inulin intervention, resulting in an incidence rate of 62.93%. LASSO regression identified six key factors in patients prior to inulin treatment. The SHAP values for interpretation ranked the characteristic variables in descending order of importance: HbA1c, difference between fasting and 2 h-postprandial glucose levels, fasting blood glucose, high-density lipoprotein, age, and body mass index. The XGBoost prediction model demonstrated a training set accuracy of 0.819, specificity of 0.913, positive predictive value of 0.818, and negative predictive value of 0.820. The testing set showed an accuracy of 0.709, specificity of 0.909, positive predictive value of 0.705, and negative predictive value of 0.710. CONCLUSION: The XGBoost-SHAP framework for predicting the impact of inulin intervention in T2DM treatment proves to be effective. It allows for the comparison of prediction effect based on different features of an individual, assessment of prediction abilities for different individuals given their features, and establishes a connection between machine learning and nutritional intervention in T2DM treatment. This offers valuable insights for researchers in this field."

Inulin is a substrate that can be utilized by the microbiota. This study aimed to determine whether fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) combined with inulin played a \"1 + 1 > 2\" role in enhancing the development and function of immune organs. Chicks were treated with 1 % inulin and/or fecal microbiota suspension on days 1-6. The growth performance, immune organ development, and immune indicators were evaluated on days 7, 14, and 21. Results showed that the combination of FMT and inulin significantly increased the immune organ index on day 7 and promoted the morphological structure and the expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) in immune organs on days 7, 14, and 21. Each treatment increased the gene expression of interferon-gamma (IFN-γ), interleukin-4 (IL-4), interleukin-2 (IL-2), B cell-activating factor receptor (BAFFR), B cell linker (BLNK), C-X-C Motif Chemokine Ligand 12 (CXCL12), C-X-C Motif Chemokine Receptor 4 (CXCR4), and Biotin (Bu-1) to varying degrees. FMT combined with inulin significantly increased the expression of IgA-positive cells on days 7 and 14.

We conducted a trial to determine whether a prebiotic would improve the gut microbiome to decrease gut pathogen colonization and decrease downstream risk for infection among newly admitted medical ICU patients with sepsis. METHODS: This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of adults who were admitted to the medical ICU for sepsis and were receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics. Participants were randomized 1:1:1 to placebo, inulin 16 g/day, or inulin 32 g/day which were given for seven days. The trial primary outcome was a surrogate measure for gut colonization resistance, namely the within-individual change from ICU admission to Day 3 in the relative abundance of short chain fatty acid (SCFA)-producing bacteria based on rectal swabs. Additional outcomes sought to evaluate the impact of inulin on the gut microbiome and downstream clinical effects. RESULTS: Ninety participants were analyzed including 30 in each study group. There was no difference between study groups in the within-individual change in the relative abundance of SCFA-producing bacteria from ICU admission to ICU Day 3 (placebo: 0.0% change, IQR - 8·0% to + 7·4% vs. combined inulin: 0·0% change, IQR - 10·1% to + 4·8%; p = 0·91). At end-of-treatment on ICU Day 7, inulin did not affect SCFA-producer levels, microbiome diversity, or rates of gut colonization with pathogenic bacteria. After 30 days of clinical follow-up, inulin did not affect rates of death or clinical, culture-proven infection. Patients who died or developed culture-proven infections had lower relative abundance of SCFA-producing bacteria at ICU admission compared to those who did not (p = 0·03). CONCLUSIONS: Prebiotic fiber had minimal impact on the gut microbiome in the ICU and did not improve clinical outcomes. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinicaltrials.gov: NCT03865706.",

The addition of inulin and calcium citrate may add further benefits, given their nephroprotective effects. In this study, we tested the changes in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), CKD symptoms, body composition, and biochemical parameters after 6 months of diet supplementation with Cetolán III, a combination of KA, inulin, and calcium citrate. We included 76 adult patients diagnosed with CKD stages 3 and 4 and not treated with renal replacement therapy in a retrospective cohort. In this cohort, participants were followed through two clinic visits at 3 and 6 months after diet supplementation. We found a slight increase in eGFR at 3 and 6 months compared with baseline, as well as a decrease in the severity of CDK-related symptoms, fat mass, and muscle mass. We observed only a slight decrease in creatinine and uric acid after 6 months of follow-up. We did not find a remarkable change in anthropometric parameters (e.g., body mass index, waist circumference, and arm muscle area). This observational study suggests that addition of KA, inulin, and calcium citrate to a low protein- diet could be associated with an improvement in eGFR and symptom severity in CKD pre-dialysis."

      "abstract": "Chronic ketamine administration causes cognitive impairments similar to those observed in schizophrenia. Growing evidence suggests that patients with schizophrenia show alterations in gut microbiota, which is associated with cognitive impairments. Inulin could regulate gut microbiota. However, it is unclear whether chronic ketamine exposure causes cognitive impairments by mediating gut microbiota and whether inulin ameliorates these impairments. In this study, we found that chronic ketamine exposure for 14 days induced gut dysbiosis, thereby increasing gut permeability, upregulating LPS-activated TLR4-NF-κB-NLRP3 inflammatory pathway, causing hippocampal neuroinflammation and neuronal damage, activating tryptophan (TRP)-kynurenine (KYN)-kynurenic acid (KYNA) pathway in the hippocampus, peripheral serum, and feces, and thus leading to deficits in recognition memory and prepulse inhibition (PPI). In addition, inulin treatment restored gut dysbiosis by increasing the abundance of Turicibacter and Ileibacterium and decreasing the abundance of Alistipes, Alloprevotella, Desulfovibrio, and Parasutterella, which may improve gut barrier damage by upregulating tight junction protein expression, suppress LPS-mediated TLR4-NF-κB-NLRP3 inflammatory pathway to reduce neuroinflammation and neuronal damage, inhibit TRP-KYN-KYNA metabolism pathway, and thus alleviate chronic ketamine-associated impairments in PPI and memory. Our findings provide additional evidence that inulin treatment is a potential intervention strategy for treating chronic ketamine-associated cognitive impairments and cognitive deficits in schizophrenia.",

It has been found beneficial in the treatment of liver disease, osteoarthritis, and particularly depression. However, SAMe's therapeutic potential is limited by low bioavailability due to poor permeability and extensive liver metabolism. This study sought to improve SAMe's bioavailability by encapsulating it in inulin nanoparticles, utilizing a colon-targeted delivery system. Inulin, a prebiotic that promotes gut health by encouraging beneficial gut bacteria, is an ideal carrier for colon-specific drug delivery. Inulin nanoparticles were prepared using the desolvation method, incorporating sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS) for ion pairing with SAMe. The nanoparticles were spray-coated onto microcrystalline cellulose inert microspheres in a fluidized bed with Eudragit L30D-55 for colon-targeted release (Nanoparticle-In-Microparticles, NIMs). Pharmacokinetic studies in rats showed that encapsulating SAMe in inulin nanoparticles resulted in a significant three-fold increase in bioavailability compared to its pure form. This enhancement highlights the potential of inulin nanoparticles as an effective delivery system for SAMe, particularly in colon-targeted therapies.",

      "abstract": "Milk contains microRNAs (miRNA) that are shielded by small extracellular vesicles (sEVs). Beyond variations among individuals, many factors including nutrition play a role in shaping miRNA expression profiles. This study is to explore milk-derived sEVs-miRNA variations induced by inulin supplementation in subclinical mastitis-suffering cows. Fourteen lactating cows diagnosed with subclinical mastitis were equally assigned to either an inulin or a control group. Apart from total mixed rations, cows in the inulin group were provided with 300 g/d inulin during the morning feeding, while the control group did not receive any supplement. Following 1 wk of adaptation and 5 wk of treatment, sEVs-miRNA were isolated from the milk of each cow. RNA is subjected to high-throughput sequencing and differentially expressed (DE) miRNA (P < 0.05 and ∣ log2FC∣> 1) were detected through bioinformatics analysis. Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analyses were conducted to examine the target genes of DE miRNA. A sum of 350 miRNA was discovered, including 332 in the control group and 249 in the inulin group. Among these, 9 miRNA showed differential expression within the 2 groups, including 3 upregulated and 6 downregulated in the inulin group. The DE miRNA participates in regulating organismal systems, cellular processes, and signal transduction, which may affect inflammatory response and milk production. Overall, our study provides insight into the micromolecular-level mechanism of inulin in alleviating subclinical mastitis in dairy cows."

      "abstract": "An imbalance in the microbiota-gut-brain axis exerts an essential effect on the pathophysiology of depressive and anxiety disorders. Our previous research revealed that the timing of inulin administration altered its effects on chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS)-induced anxiety and depression. However, it is still unclear if the gut-brain axis is primarily responsible for these effects. In this study, fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) confirmed that inulin administration at different times alleviated CUMS-induced anxiety- and depression-like behaviors via the gut-brain axis. The time of administration seemed to modify the anxiolytic and antidepressant effects of inulin, and inulin intervention in the evening was more pronounced in inhibiting the inflammatory responses than that of morning inulin intervention. Serum metabolomics analysis showed that the main differential metabolites, including fenofibric acid, 4'-Hydroxyfenoprofen glucuronide and 5-(4-Hydroxybenzyl)thiazolidine-2,4-dione may be vital for the anxiolytic and antidepressant effects of different inulin treatment times. Our results suggested that inulin administration in the evening was more effective in alleviating the inflammatory responses and improving amino acids metabolism. This study provides a new potential link between the microbiota-gut-brain axis and chrono-nutrition, demonstrating that a more appropriate administration time results in a better intervention effect.",

However, the effect of gut microbiota modulation by dietary components on high fat diet (HFD)-induced severe AP remains unclear. Here, we found that the inulin, a soluble dietary fiber, mitigated pancreatic injury and systematic inflammation in mice fed HFD, which was dependent on gut microbiota as this protective effect was attenuated in germ-free mice. Inulin treatment suppressed the overgrowth of pathogenic bacteria Escherichia Shigella, Enterococcus, Klebsiella, while increased the abundance of probiotics Akkermansia. Fecal microbiota transplantation from inulin-treated mice to recipient mice reduced pancreatic damage and remodeled intestinal homeostasis. Additionally, inulin increased fecal short chain fatty acids (SCFAs), strengthened gut barrier and restored Paneth cells. The beneficial effect of inulin on improving pancreatic damage and leaky gut was diminished after the suppression of SCFAs. Notably, SCFAs administration, especially butyrate, to HFD mice blocked pancreatic and intestinal injury with the inhibition of histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3), and pharmacological HDAC3 inhibition mimicked the ameliorative effect of SCFAs. Mechanically, butyrate modulated macrophage M1/M2 polarization balance by suppressing HDAC3 and subsequent acetylation of histone H3K27. Collectively, our data offer new insights into the gut microbiota-pancreas axis that may be leveraged to augment the potential supplementation of prebiotic inulin in the management of obesity associated severe AP.",

      "abstract": "To achieve effective long-term synergistic treatment of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) with probiotics, we developed a versatile inulin/trans-ferulic acid/silk sericin nanoparticles-nourished probiotic complex. Inulin/TFA/SS nanoparticles were fabricated by inulin, trans-ferulic acid (TFA), and silk sericin (SS), and then loaded onto the surface of poly-l-lysine (PLL) and poly-glutamic acid (PGA)-coated Bifidobacterium longum (BL) to obtain BL@PLL-PGA-Inulin/TFA/SS NPs (BL@PP-NPs). This design simultaneously endowed the complex with excellent gastrointestinal resistance, antioxidant, and anti-inflammation abilities. Moreover, the inulin in the nanoparticles acts as a prebiotic, promoting the Bifidobacterium's rapid proliferation to exert effects within a short period. Compared with uncoated BL, BL@PP-NPs exhibited excellent gastric acid tolerance and up to 31.32-fold colonic colonization, and the ROS scavenging and proliferative capacity were increased by 5.61- and 1.39-fold, respectively. In a mouse model of dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)- and trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced colitis, the components of Inulin/TFA/SS NPs synergized with probiotics to efficiently treat IBD by attenuating oxidative stress, decreasing inflammation, repairing intestinal barrier, and promoting the rapid proliferation of probiotics to reverse gut microbial disorders. Collectively, food-grade BL@PP-NPs represent a novel approach to probiotic modification that offers an effective, safe, and synergistic therapy for IBD.",

The potential of biopolymer-based nanocarriers was investigated in order to address this issue. Inulin, a biopolymer produced by the halophilic bacterium Salinivibrio sp. GM01, has been evaluated for its effectiveness as an insulin nanocarrier. Using central composite design (CCD) method, the optimum condition of inulin-encapsulated insulin (I-In) was achieved at 53 mg of inulin stirred at 17,800 rpm for 10 min, resulting in spherical I-In nanoparticles (I-In NPs) with an average diameter of 416 ± 32 nm and encapsulation efficiency of 87.04 ± 3.01%. The insulin release profile of I-In NPs in simulated gastric fluid follows a burst pattern. Biophysical analysis revealed that insulin in I-In NPs had higher conformational stability than the free state (FS) insulin, as evidenced by an increase in denaturation half-life up to 60 min and the transition enthalpy by 0.29 and 1.53 kcal/mol for secondary and tertiary structures, respectively. Furthermore, preliminary in vivo studies showed that I-In NPs showed significant effect compared to FS insulin for up to 15% in blood glucose level reduction. This study demonstrates the potential of I-In NPs as a promising candidate for antidiabetic therapy and an effective oral delivery system."

This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of Jiangshi oligosaccharide (JSO), a type of inulin-based oligosaccharide, in alleviating anxiety and depression and to investigate the underlying molecular mechanisms. Using a mouse model of chronic restraint stress (CRS), JSO was administered orally at doses of 50, 100, and 200 mg/kg for 21 days. Behavioral tests, including the novelty-suppressed feeding test (NSFT), open field test (OFT), elevated plus maze test (EPMT), tail suspension test (TST), and forced swimming test (FST), demonstrated that JSO significantly improved anxiety- and depressive-like behaviors (P< 0.05). Notably, JSO reduced feeding latency in the NSFT, increased time spent in the center in the OFT, enhanced time and entries into open arms in the EPMT, and decreased immobility time in the TST and FST (P< 0.01). Histological and molecular analyses revealed that JSO treatment attenuated neuronal loss in the hippocampus (Hip) and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and reduced the expression of inflammatory markers such as Iba-1 and GFAP in these regions. JSO significantly downregulated the mRNA and protein expression of pro-inflammatory factors (IL-1β, TNF-α, IL-6) while increasing anti-inflammatory markers (IL-10, TGF-β) (P< 0.05). Furthermore, JSO inhibited the c-GAS-STING-NLRP3 axis and apoptosis-related proteins (Bax/Bcl-2, Caspase-3/8/9) while promoting the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), PSD-95, and synaptophysin (SYP), indicating improved neuronal survival and synaptic plasticity (P< 0.01). These findings suggest that JSO exerts potent anti-anxiety and antidepressant effects by modulating neuroinflammation, synaptic function, and neuronal apoptosis in the Hip and mPFC of CRS mice. This study highlighted JSO as a potential therapeutic agent for stress-induced anxiety and depression."

These comorbidities are linked to disturbances in serotonin (5-HT) metabolism and gut microbiota dysbiosis. Clinical studies suggest that inulin, a prebiotic, can alleviate anxiety and depression in AD patients by affecting the gut microbiota, although the mechanisms remain unclear. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study is to investigate the potential mechanisms by which inulin, a prebiotic, improves anxiety and depression-like behaviors in AD withdrawal mice. This research is based on the drug and food homology and intestinal treatment of encephalopathy, with the goal of developing new clinical strategies for AD treatment. STUDY DESIGN: For this purpose, fecal samples from AD patients were analyzed to identify microorganisms associated with AD. An AD withdrawal mouse model was created, with inulin as the intervention and fluvoxamine maleate as the control. Techniques such as 16S microbiome sequencing and UPLC-TQMS-targeted metabolomics were used to assess gut microbiota, short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) levels, and 5-HT metabolism. METHODS: The AD withdrawal model was built using the \"Drinking-in-the-dark\" protocol over 6 weeks. Inulin (2 g/kg/day) and fluvoxamine maleate (30 mg/kg/day) were administered for 4 weeks. The open field test, forced swim test, and tail suspension test were used to evaluate anxiety and depression-like behaviors in mice. ELISA and qRT-PCR assessed 5-HT metabolism in the colon, blood, and prefrontal cortex, while 16S microbiome sequencing analyzed changes in gut microbiota and UPLC-TQMS examined SCFAs levels. Immunohistochemistry was used to study intestinal barrier integrity. RESULTS: AD patients showed reduced SCFA-producing bacteria such as Faecalibacterium and Roseburia. In mice, AD withdrawal led to anxiety and depression-like behaviors, disrupted 5-HT metabolism, and gut microbiota dysbiosis. Inulin supplementation alleviated these behaviors, increased 5-HT and 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) levels, upregulated colonic tryptophan hydroxylase 1 (TPH1) expression, and promoted the growth of beneficial bacteria such as Faecalibacterium and Roseburia, while also increasing SCFAs levels. CONCLUSION: Inulin increases the abundance of Faecalibacterium and Roseburia, enhances SCFAs production, and regulates 5-HT metabolism, improving anxiety and depression-like behaviors in AD withdrawal mice. These findings suggest that inulin may serve as a nutritional intervention for mental health in AD patients by targeting the microbiome-gut-brain axis.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Atherosclerosis (AS) is considered the underlying cause of many diseases, particularly cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases. Inulin, a type of fructan, has shown potential in improving atherosclerosis, although there are conflicting findings. It is hypothesized that the polymerization degree of inulin may largely influence its therapeutic effectiveness. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the effects and mechanisms of short-chain and long-chain inulin in AS. METHODS: ApoE-/- mice fed a high fat diet (HFD) were used to establish an atherosclerosis model. These mice received daily oral administration of either short-chain or long-chain inulin for 12 weeks. Plasma lipid metabolism-related indices were measured using biochemical analysis, and plasma immunological indices were analyzed via ELISA. The aorta, aortic root regions, liver tissue, adipose tissue, and colon tissue were examined through various staining techniques, including ORO staining, hematoxylin and eosin staining, Alcian blue staining, and immunofluorescent or immunohistochemical assays. Microbiome analysis was conducted in the cecal content. RESULTS: The results indicated that both short-chain and long-chain inulin substantially reduced the formation of atherosclerotic plaques. Inulin also improved plasma lipid concentrations and hepatic lipid metabolism, and partially alleviated both localized (atherosclerotic lesions) and systemic inflammation. Short-chain inulin was more effective than long-chain inulin in reducing atherosclerotic plaques formation, enhancing lipid metabolism and reducing inflammation. Additionally, both types of inulin showed similar effectiveness in enhancing intestinal epithelial barrier integrity, gut microbiota composition and functionality. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that inulin has a protective role against atherosclerosis by enhancing lipid metabolism, reducing inflammation, and improving intestinal barrier and gut microbiota. As a dietary intervention, short-chain inulin is more effective than long-chain inulin, offering clinical implications for using inulin as a therapeutic agent for atherosclerosis."

      "abstract": "Inulin is a well-recognized prebiotic ingredient established to modulate the gut microbiome and its metabolic functionality. However, little is known about how the food matrix interacts with the prebiotic efficacy of inulin. The aim of the present study was to investigate the interaction between the food matrix (milk vs. yogurt) and the gut microbiome modulatory effects of inulin and its influence on calcium bioavailability as reflected in bone mineralization. For this purpose, a 6-week dietary intervention was conducted in healthy young growing male rats (n = 36) which received a diet matrix that included: (1) milk, (2) milk supplemented with 5% inulin, (3) yogurt, or (4) yogurt supplemented with 5% inulin. All diets were limited in calcium content and provided a daily intake of 46 mg calcium per rat. We found that inulin fortification of a yogurt diet exerted a larger effect on gut fermentation as reflected in pH and the generation of acetate in the distal part of the intestine and feces compared with inulin fortification of milk. Inulin was also associated with a higher acetate concentration in plasma when supplied in yogurt compared with milk. No effects of inulin supplementation were found on bone parameters. In conclusion, the present study suggested that the prebiotic efficacy of inulin is higher when supplied in a fermented dairy product than milk. However, neither adding inulin to yogurt or milk affected bone mineralization or the bone structure.",

      "abstract": "RNA interference has emerged as a promising therapeutic strategy to tackle acute kidney injury (AKI). Development of targeted delivery systems is highly desired for selective renal delivery of RNA and improved therapeutic outcomes in AKI. Inulin is a plant polysaccharide traditionally employed to measure glomerular filtration rate. Here, we describe the synthesis of inulin modified with α-cyclam-p-toluic acid (CPTA) to form a novel renal-targeted polymer, Inulin-CPTA (IC), which is capable of selective siRNA delivery to the injured kidneys. We show that conjugating CPTA to inulin imparts IC with targeting properties for cells that overexpress the C-X-C chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4). Self-assembled IC/siRNA nanoparticles (polyplexes) demonstrated rapid accumulation in the injured kidneys with selective uptake and prolonged retention in injured renal tubules overexpressing the CXCR4 receptor. Tumor-suppressor protein p53 contributes significantly to the pathogenesis of AKI. siRNA-induced silencing of p53 has shown therapeutic potential in several preclinical studies, making it an important target in the treatment of AKI. Systemically administered nanoparticles formulated using IC and siRNA against p53 selectively accumulated in the injured kidneys and potently silenced p53 expression. Selective p53 knockdown led to positive therapeutic outcomes in mice with cisplatin-induced AKI, as seen by reduced tubular cell death, renal injury, inflammation, and overall improved renal function. These findings indicate that IC is a promising new carrier for renal-targeted delivery of RNA for the treatment of AKI.",

The effectiveness of diet therapy such as Clostridium butyricum (CB) and inulin supplementation in obesity and whether they can cooperate to produce better effects are still unclear. And during this process, intestinal flora play an important role, while the bacteria involved and the metabolic mechanism need to be explored. In this study, we successfully established a mouse obesity model with a high-fat diet (HFD) and divided it into three experimental groups: 7% CB (CB7), 7% CB + 1% inulin (C7G1), and 10% CB + 1% inulin (C10G). Dietary supplementation with CB and inulin could improve the glucose tolerance and intestinal microbial composition of obese mice, among which the simultaneous supplementation with 7% CB and 1% inulin (C7G1) has the most significant effect on obese mice fed with a HFD. It could significantly reduce the amount of total cholesterol, triglyceride, and low-density lipoprotein, improve abnormal glucose tolerance, and reduce abnormal blood glucose in obese mice. The intestinal flora of obese mice changed significantly, among which Lachnospiraceae_unclassified, Porphyromonaceae_unclassified, Olsenella, Bacteria_unclassified and Clostridiales_unclassified decreased due to the HFD, while Megamonas and Clostridium XIVa increased. After the supplementation with CB and inulin, the enrichment of three kinds of beneficial bacteria, Parabacteroides, Bacteroides, and Ruminococcaceae unclassified increased. The high-fat diet could upregulate the expression of FGF21, and the Clostridium butyricum and inulin supplemented diet could decrease the upregulation.",

In the present study, the mice were administered GenX (2 mg/kg/day) with or without inulin supplementation (5 g/kg/day) for 12 weeks. Histopathological assessments revealed that GenX induced colonic gland atrophy, inflammatory cell infiltration, a reduction in goblet cell numbers, and decreased mucus secretion. Furthermore, a significant decrease in the protein levels of ZO-1, occludin, and claudin-5 indicated compromised barrier integrity. Transcriptomic analysis identified 2645 DEGs, which were mapped to 39 significant pathways. The TGF-β, BMP6, and β-catenin proteins were upregulated in the intestinal mucosa following GenX exposure, indicating activation of the TGF-β pathway. Conversely, the protein expression of PAK3, CyclinD2, contactin1, and Jam2 decreased, indicating disruptions in cell cycle progression and cell adhesion. Inulin cotreatment ameliorated these GenX-induced alterations, partially through modulating the MAPK pathway, as evidenced by the upregulation of the cell cycle and cell adhesion proteins. Collectively, these findings suggested that GenX exposure triggered intestinal injury in mice by activating the TGF-β pathway and disrupting proteins crucial for the cell cycle and cell adhesion, whereas inulin supplementation mitigated this injury by modulating the MAPK pathway.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Excess body weight and adiposity can adversely affect metabolic health. Prebiotics such as inulin-type fructans (ITFs) from chicory root are known to modulate gut microbiota and may improve body weight regulation. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to assess evidence for chicory ITF supplementation to support weight management. METHODS: Eligible articles (initial search to 2021, updated to February 2023) were searched from EMBASE, MEDLINE (PubMed), and Cochrane Library. Data on primary (body weight) and secondary outcomes [body mass index (BMI), total fat mass, body fat percentage, and waist circumference] were extracted by 2 reviewers independently. Random-effects model using inverse-variance method was used. Subgroup analysis (health status and ITF type) and meta-regression (dose and duration) were evaluated. RESULTS: A total of 32 eligible studies were included. Chicory ITF significantly reduced body weight [mean difference (MD): -0.97 kg; 95% CI: -1.34, -0.59); n = 1184] compared with placebo. ITF favored overall effects reduction in BMI (MD: -0.39 kg/m2; 95% CI: -0.57, -0.20; n = 985), fat mass (MD: -0.37 kg; 95% CI: -0.61, -0.13; n = 397), waist circumference (MD: -1.03 cm; 95% CI: -1.69, -0.37; n = 604), and for intervention duration of >8 wk, body fat percentage (MD: -0.78%; 95% CI: -1.17, -0.39; n = 488). Except for considerable heterogeneity in body weight (I2: 73%) and body fat percentage (I2: 75%), all other outcomes had negligible to moderate heterogeneity. Significant reduction in body weight, BMI, and waist circumference was evident irrespective of participants' health status. There was minimal evidence that dose, duration, or type of ITF influenced the magnitude of reductions in outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Chicory ITF supplementation may benefit weight management by reducing body weight, BMI, fat mass, waist circumference, and, to a certain extent, body fat percentage. This systematic review with meta-analysis was registered at PROSPERO as CRD42020184908.",

      "abstract": "Inulin has been reported to alleviate colitis. In this study, colitis patients' feces were used to simulate fermentation to demonstrate changes in the microbiota profile in the presence of inulin. We found inulin can reshape the gut microbiota profile of colitis patients, especially by altering the abundance of Faecalibacterium and Blautia. Interestingly, the subsequent co-culture with inulin demonstrated that inulin promoted the growth of these two strains of bacteria. The dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced mouse model was used to examine the effect of inulin and its combination with two probiotics on colitis. Results showed that all three treatments can alleviate the clinical symptoms, including weight-losing, colon-shortening, and the Disease Activity Index (DAI) score. Further investigations showed that the administrations regulate colitis mice's pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-10, and IL-17. Also, they alter the relative abundance of Faecalibacterium and Blautia, change the short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) profile in the cecum and colon, and improve the intestinal barrier; specifically, the intervention increased the expressions of Claudin, Occludin, Zonula Occludens (ZO)-1, and Mucin (MUC)-2 in colonic tissues, thus restoring the colonic tissue structure and morphology of colitis mice. Collectively, our results confirm that inulin can alter the colitis patients' characteristic microbial community, and they can ameliorate experimental colitis by inhibiting the TRL4/MyD88/NF-κB signaling pathway-improving the inflammatory response and enhancing the intestinal barrier. In conclusion, we propose that inulin may hold promise as a functional food therapeutic approach for the treatment of colitis.",

      "abstract": "Migraine is a complex neurovascular disorder characterized by recurrent headache attacks that are often accompanied by symptoms such as vomiting, nausea, and sensitivity to sound or light. Preventing migraine attacks is highly important. Recent research has indicated that alterations in gut microbiota may influence the underlying mechanisms of migraines. This study aimed to investigate the effects of inulin supplementation on migraine headache characteristics, quality of life (QOL), and mental health symptoms in women with migraines. In a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial, 80 women with migraines aged 20 to 50 years were randomly assigned to receive 10 g day-1 of inulin or a placebo supplement for 12 weeks. Severity, frequency, and duration of migraine attacks, as well as depression, anxiety, stress, QOL, and headache impact test (HIT-6) scores, were examined at the start of the study and after 12 weeks of intervention. In this study, the primary outcome focused on the frequency of headache attacks, while secondary outcomes encompassed the duration and severity of headache attacks, QOL, and mental health. There was a significant reduction in severity (-1.95 vs. -0.84, P = 0.004), duration (-6.95 vs. -2.05, P = 0.023), frequency (-2.09 vs. -0.37, P < 0.001), and HIT-6 score (-10.30 vs. -6.52, P < 0.023) in the inulin group compared with the control. Inulin supplementation improved mental health symptoms, including depression (-4.47 vs. -1.45, P < 0.001), anxiety (-4.37 vs. -0.70, P < 0.001), and stress (-4.40 vs. -1.50, P < 0.001). However, no significant difference was observed between the two groups regarding changes in QOL score. This study provides evidence supporting the beneficial effects of inulin supplement on migraine symptoms and mental health status in women with migraines. Further studies are necessary to confirm these findings. Trial registration: Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials (https://www.irct.ir) (ID: IRCT20121216011763N58).",

      "abstract": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease characterized by inflammatory demyelination occurring in the central nervous system (CNS). Inulin is a common prebiotic that can improve metabolic disorders by modulating the gut microbiota. However, its capacity to affect CNS autoimmunity is poorly recognized. Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) is a classical mouse model of MS. Herein, we found that oral administration of inulin ameliorated the severity EAE in mice, accompanied by reductions in inflammatory cell infiltration and demyelination in the CNS. These reductions were associated with decreased proportion and numbers of Th17 cells in brain and spleen. Consistent with the findings, the serum concentrations of IL-17, IL-6, and TNF-α were reduced in inulin treated EAE mice. Moreover, the proliferation of auto-reactive lymphocytes, against MOG35-55 antigen, was attenuated ex vivo. Mechanistically, inulin treatment altered the composition of gut microbiota. It increased Lactobacillus and Dubosiella whereas decreased g_Prevotellaceae_NK3B31_group at the genus level, alongside with elevated concentration of butyric acid in fecal content and serum. In vitro, butyrate, but not inulin, could inhibit the activation of MOG35-55 stimulated lymphocytes. Furthermore, fecal microbiota transplantation assay confirmed that fecal contents of inulin-treated normal mice had an ameliorative effect on EAE mice. In contrast, antibiotic cocktail (ABX) treatment diminished the therapeutic effect of inulin in EAE mice as well as the reduction of Th17 cells, while supplementation with Lactobacillus reuteri restored the amelioration effect. These results confirmed that the attenuation of inulin on Th17 cells and inflammatory demyelination in EAE mice was dependent on its modulation on gut microbiota and metabolites. Our findings provide a potential therapeutic regimen for prebiotic inulin supplementation in patients with multiple sclerosis.",

      "abstract": "Atractylodis Macrocephalae Rhizoma (AMR), an herb often found in compounded remedies for psoriasis, is rich in polysaccharides. However, the beneficial effects of AMR polysaccharides on psoriasis remain obscure. In this study, an inulin-type fructan-labelled AMP was extracted from the AMR. AMP has a molecular weight of 5.84 kDa and comprises fructose, glucose, and arabinose at a molar ratio of 93:5:2. Methylation and NMR analyses revealed that AMP comprises a linear backbone of 2,6-linked Fruf or 1,2-linked Fruf with branching 1,2,6-linked Fruf and terminates in T-Glcp. Animal studies verified that AMP can improve imiquimod-induced psoriasis-like skin lesions and downregulate the Il-17a, Il-23, Il-22, Il-6, Il-12, and Tnf-α gene expression. Furthermore, we elucidated the underlying mechanisms using cellular experiments. The ability of AMP to inhibit hyperproliferation and the overexpression of TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-23 genes in human immortal keratinocyte cells (HaCaT) stimulated by lipopolysaccharide was demonstrated. These results indicate that AMP may directly target keratinocytes to suppress excessive proliferation and contribute to anti-inflammatory responses, potentially by blocking the activation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. In summary, AMP has demonstrated potential as a prospective treatment strategy for psoriasis."

Nutritional approaches play a crucial role in CKD management, and various supplements have become available. Ketoanalogues of amino acids (KAs), calcium citrate, and inulin have been proposed as suitable supplements, yet their widespread use has been limited due to insufficient evidence. This study aimed to generate general guidance statements on the appropriateness of these supplements through a RAND/UCLA consensus process. METHODS: A RAND/UCLA consensus panel was convened to evaluate the appropriateness of these supplements in different clinical scenarios. In this study, we present a subgroup analysis focusing on a panel of eleven clinical nephrologists from among the experts. RESULTS: Supplementation of low-protein diets (LPDs) and very low-protein diets (VLPDs) with KA was considered appropriate to reduce manifestations and delay CKD outcomes, supplementation with calcium citrate is considered appropriate to reduce CKD manifestations, and supplementation with inulin is considered appropriate to delay CKD outcomes and manage comorbidities. CONCLUSIONS: Based on a combination of clinical experience and scientific evidence, the panel reached a consensus that KA supplementation of LPD and VLPD, calcium citrate, and inulin are appropriate in patients with CKD across various scenarios.",

In PCOS mice, dietary inulin has been demonstrated to regulate intestinal flora and inflammation. However, the efficacy of dietary inulin in clinical PCOS remains unclear. OBJECTIVE: The intestinal flora and related metabolic indexes of obese patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) after 3 months of inulin treatment were analyzed. SETTING AND DESIGN: To analyze the intestinal flora and related metabolic indexes in healthy controls and obese patients with polycystic ovary syndrome after 3 months of inulin treatment. RESULTS: The results showed that dietary inulin improved sex hormone disorders, reduced BMI and WHR levels in obese women with PCOS. In addition, the inulin intervention reduced plasma TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, and MCP-1levels. Inulin intervention increased the abundance of Actinobacteria, Fusobacteria, Lachnospira, and Bifidobacterium, as well as decreased the ratio of F/B and the abundance of proteobacteria, Sutterella, and Enterobacter. Correlation analyses showed a strong relationship among plasma inflammatory factors, sex steroid hormones, and the intestinal flora of patients.

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Obesity, a pervasive global epidemic, has heightened susceptibility to chronic ailments and diminished the overall life expectancy on a global scale. Probiotics and inulin (IN) have been documented to mitigate obesity by exerting an influence on the composition of the gut microbiota. Whether heat-killed Bifidobacterium longum BBMN68 (MN68) and IN have an anti-obesity effect remains to be investigated. METHODS: In this study, Wistar rats were fed a high-fat diet (HFD), and orally administered heat-killed MN68 (2 × 1011 CFU/kg) and/or inulin (0.25 kg/kg) for 12 weeks. Histological analysis, serology analysis and 16S rRNA gene sequencing were performed. RESULTS: Heat-killed MN68 + IN treatment showed an enhanced effect on preventing weight gain, diminishing fat accumulation, and regulating lipid metabolism, compared to either heat-killed MN68 treatment or inulin treatment. Gut microbiota results showed that heat-killed MN68 + IN treatment significantly increased the relative abundance of Bacteroidota, Oscillospira, Intestinimonas, Christensenella, and Candidatus_Stoquefichus, and reduced the relative abundance of Enterococcus. Furthermore, heat-killed MN68 + IN significantly increased the SCFA levels, which were correlated with changes in the gut microbiota. DISCUSSION: This research provides support for the application of heat-killed MN68 and IN in the treatment of obesity, and highlights the combination of heat-killed BBMN68 and IN as functional food ingredients."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a multi-organ disease caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). Individuals with CF often have gastrointestinal (GI) dysbiosis due to chronic inflammation and antibiotic use. Previous studies suggested a role for vitamin D in reversing the GI dysbiosis found in CF. OBJECTIVE: To explore the potential role of a combination of high-dose oral cholecalciferol (vitamin D3) and fermentable dietary fiber, inulin, to impact bacterial composition, richness, and diversity of intestinal and airway microbiota in adults with CF. METHODS: This was a 2 × 2 factorial, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, randomized, pilot clinical trial in which adults with CF received oral cholecalciferol (vitamin D3) (50,000 IU/week) and/or inulin (12 g/day) for 12 weeks. Thus, there were 4 study groups (n = 10 subjects per group); 1) placebo 2) vitamin D3 3) inulin 4) vitamin D3 plus inulin. Stool and sputum samples were collected at baseline (just before) and after the intervention and were analysed using 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing for gut and airway microbiota composition. Statistical analyses assessed alpha and beta diversity to evaluate microbial community changes. RESULTS: Of a total of 254 screened participants, 40 eligible participants were randomized to one of the 4 treatment arms. Participants receiving vitamin D3 plus inulin exhibited greater changes in microbiome indexes in both intestinal and airway relative to those in the other study groups. Specific taxonomic changes supported the potential beneficial influence of this combination to mitigate both intestinal and airway dysbiosis in adults with CF. CONCLUSION: This pilot study established that the combination of oral vitamin D3 and the prebiotic inulin was well tolerated over 12 weeks in adults with CF and altered gut and airway bacterial communities. Future research appear warranted to define clinical outcomes and the role of microbiota changes therein with this approach."

Cryopreservation of sperm produces reactive oxygen species (ROS), which disrupt sperm function and structural competence. Numerous protective chemicals, including fructans, have been used during sperm cryopreservation. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effect of different concentrations of the fructosan inulin on ram sperm quality parameters, superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, and malondialdehyde (MDA) production after freezing and thawing. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The pooled samples from four healthy rams were divided into seven equal aliquots and diluted in a Tris-base extender supplemented with 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, and 28 mM of inulin or without inulin supplementation (control). By using liquid nitrogen vapor, the semen was frozen and stored at 196 degree C. RESULTS: The total motility, viability, and DNA integrity were significantly improved after freeze-thawing with 28 mM inulin, compared to other treatment groups (P < 0.05). A Tris-based extender containing 16 and 28 mM of inulin displayed the highest levels of ram sperm membrane integrity when compared with the control (p <0.05). The abnormality of ram sperm was increased during freeze-thawing at control and 1 mM of inulin, compared to 16 and 28 mM of inulin (P < 0.05). Additionally, 28 mM of inulin decreased MDA and increased SOD activity in ram sperm in comparison with the other treatments (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: As a result, 28 mM of inulin could be beneficial for the cryopreservation industry and reduce the harmful effects of freeze-thawing on ram sperm. Doi.org/10.54680/fr24510110512.",

In this study, low-salt tuber mustard pickles fermented with Lactiplantibacillus plantarum LPP95 in the presence of chitosan and inulin were analyzed over a 30-day period, and quality changes were evaluated. Total acid productions along with high bacterial counts (106 CFU/mL) were observed in the initial 20 days during indoor storage temperature, in which the reduced fiber aperture was found significantly lead to an increase in crispness (16.94 ± 1.87 N) and the maintenance of a low nitrate content (1.23 ± 0.01 mg/kg). Moreover, the combined pickling treatment resulted in higher malic acid content, lower tartaric acid content, and a decrease in the content of bitter amino acids (e.g., isoleucine and leucine), thus leading to an increase in the proportion of sweet amino acids. Additionally, combined pickling led to the production of unique volatile flavor compounds, especially the distinct spicy flavor compounds isothiocyanates. Moreover, the combined pickling treatment resulted in an increase in the abundance of Lactiplantibacillus and promoted microbial diversity within the fermentation system. Thus, the synergistic effect among chitosan, inulin, and L. plantarum LPP95 significantly enhanced the quality of pickles. The study offers a promising strategy to standardize the quality of low-salt fermented vegetables.",

However, the catalytic mechanism underlying the sequential biodegradation of inulin remains unelusive during the biotranformation of fructans. Herein we present the crystal structures of IFTase from Arthrobacter aurescens SK 8.001 in apo form and in complexes with kestose, nystose, or fructosyl nystose, respectively. Two kinds of conserved noncatalytic binding regions are first identified for IFTase-inulin interactions. The conserved interactions of substrates were revealed in the catalytic center that only contained a catalytic residue E205. A switching scaffold was comprised of D194 and Q217 in the catalytic channel, which served as the catalytic transition stabilizer through side chain displacement in the cycling of substrate sliding in/out the catalytic pocket. Such features in GH91 contribute to the catalytic model for consecutive cutting of substrate chain as well as product release in IFTase, and thus might be extended to other exo-active enzymes with an enclosed bottom of catalytic pocket. The study expands the current general catalytic principle in enzyme-substrate complexes and shed light on the rational design of IFTase for fructan biotransformation.",

Using the Mucosal Simulator of the Human Intestinal Microbial Ecosystem (M-SHIME®) model, the effects of repeated supplementation with inulin (prebiotic, which is expected to provide a source of nutrition for the live microorganisms in the gut to potentially support optimal digestive health), Bacillus coagulans lactospore (probiotic), and a low and high dose of a synbiotic combination of the two on the gut microbial community activity and composition were evaluated. Test product supplementation increased the health-promoting short-chain fatty acids acetate and butyrate compared with levels recorded during the control period, demonstrating a stimulation of saccharolytic fermentation. This was likely the result of the increased abundance of several saccharolytic bacterial groups, including Megamonas, Bifidobacterium, and Faecalibacterium, following test product supplementation. The stimulation of acetate and butyrate production, as well as the increased abundance of saccharolytic bacterial groups were more evident in treatment week 3 compared with treatment week 1, demonstrating the value of repeated product administration. Further, the synbiotic formulations tended to result in greater changes compared with prebiotic or probiotic alone. Overall, the findings demonstrate a synbiotic potential for inulin and B. coagulans lactospore and support repeated administration of these products, indicating a potential for promoting gut health.",

Secondly, microbiota changes and cognitive function were assessed in children within a small pilot (n = 13) trial comparing WBB, inulin, and a maltodextrin placebo, via a series of tests measuring executive function and memory function, with faecal sampling at baseline, 4 weeks post-intervention and after a 4 week washout period. Both WBB and inulin led to microbial changes and increases in levels of short chain fatty acids in vitro. In vivo significant improvements in executive function and memory were observed following inulin and WBB consumption as compared to placebo. Cognitive benefits were accompanied by significant increases in Faecalibacterium prausnitzii in the inulin group, while in the WBB group, Bacteroidetes significantly increased and Firmicutes significantly decreased (p < 0.05). As such, WBB and inulin both impact the microbiota and may impact cognitive function via different gut-related or other mechanisms. This study highlights the important influence of diet on cognitive function that could, in part, be mediated by the gut microbiota."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Gut dysbiosis that resulted from the alteration between host-microbe interaction might worsen obesity-induced systemic inflammation. Gut microbiota manipulation by supplementation of prebiotic inulin may reverse metabolic abnormalities and improve obesity. This study aimed to determine whether inulin supplementation improved intestinal microbiota and microbial functional pathways in children with obesity. METHODS: Children with obesity whose BMI above median + 2SDs were recruited to a randomized, double-blinded placebo-controlled study. The participants aged 7-15 years were assigned to inulin supplement extracted from Thai Jerusalem artichoke (intervention), maltodextrin (placebo), and dietary fiber advice groups. All participants received similar monthly conventional advice and follow-up for 6 months. Fecal samples were collected for gut microbiome analysis using 16S rRNA sequencing. Phylogenetic Investigation of Communities by Reconstruction of Unobserved States was performed to infer microbial functional pathways. RESULTS: One hundred and forty-three children with available taxonomic and functional pathway abundance profiles were evaluated. A significant increase in alpha-diversity was observed in the inulin group. Inulin supplementation substantially enhanced Bifidobacterium, Blautia, Megasphaera, and several butyrate-producing bacteria, including Agathobacter, Eubacterium coprostanoligenes, and Subdoligranulum, compared to the other groups. The inulin group showed a significant difference in functional pathways of proteasome and riboflavin metabolism. These changes correlated with clinical and metabolic outcomes exclusively in the inulin group. CONCLUSIONS: Inulin supplementation significantly promoted gut bacterial diversity and improved gut microbiota dysbiosis in children with obesity. The modulation of functional pathways by inulin suggests its potential to establish beneficial interactions between the gut microbiota and host physiology. Inulin supplementation could be a strategic treatment to restore the balance of intestinal microbiota and regulate their functions in childhood obesity.",

Additionally, the study investigated enzymatic inhibition and mRNA expression of starch synthesis genes (RAmy1a, GBSSIa, SBEIIa, and SBEIIb). Glucose transporter gene expression (GLUT1 and GLUT4) patterns were analyzed in 3T3-L1 adipocytes to evaluate glucose uptake in B. stercoris PE treated rice varieties. The application of B. stercoris PE enhanced grain quality by imparting starch ultra-structural rigidity, inhibiting starch metabolizing enzymes, and inducing molecular changes in starch synthesis genes.

Inulin fermentation resulting in the production of short-chain fatty acids, primarily butyrate, has been reported to be associated with properties that are beneficial for gut health and has led to an increased consumption of inulin in the Western population through processed food and over-the-counter dietary supplements. However, in clinical trials, there is limited evidence of the efficacy of inulin in preventing colorectal cancer. Moreover, recent data suggest that improper inulin consumption may even be harmful for gastro-intestinal health under certain circumstances. The main objective of this review is to provide insight into the beneficial and potentially detrimental effects of inulin supplementation in the context of colorectal cancer prevention and enhancement of treatment efficacy."

Inulin treatment increased the abundance of harmful bacteria such as Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria, while combined treatment decreased their abundance and increased the abundance of beneficial bacteria containing Firmicutes and Eubacterium which belonged to the bile acid-related bacteria. The combination treatment decreased the content of primary bile acids and secondary bile acids in the feces of mice, especial for DCA and LCA which were the agonists of TGR5. Furthermore, the combination treatment reduced the mRNA expression of the TGR5, cyclin dependent kinase 4, cyclin 1 and CDK2, increased the mRNA expression of p21 in the lung, down-regulated the level of NF-κB p65, and up-regulated the level of TNF-α compared with the model group.

Constipation is probably one of the most prominent gastrointestinal symptoms (non-motor symptoms) of PD with devastating consequences. The aim of this research work is to formulate a functional food product, supplemented with inulin, cocoa, and Moringa, which can be an adjuvant in the treatment of constipation. The product was prepared according to a muffin or \"Chilean cake\" recipe; this basic muffin was prepared with additions of inulin (MI), inulin + cacao (MIC), and inulin + Moringa (MIM). A physical-chemical analysis of the macronutrients and an antioxidant capacity assessment of the samples were conducted, as well as a sensory evaluation performed by a group of people suffering from Parkinson's disease. A statistically significant difference was observed in the soluble (p = 0.0023) and insoluble (p = 0.0015) fiber values between the control samples and all samples. Furthermore, inulin + cacao improved the antioxidant capacity and folate intake compared to the control. Inulin alone has been shown to have antioxidant capacity according to ABTS (262.5728 ± 34.74 μmol TE/g) and DPPH (9.092518 ± 10.43 μmol TE/g) assays. A sensory evaluation showed a preference for the product with inulin and for the product with inulin + cacao, with a 78% purchase intention being reported by the subjects who evaluated the products. The incorporation of inulin and cacao improved the nutritional value of the muffins; the dietary fiber, antioxidant capacity and folate content are some of the features that stood out. A bakery product enriched with inulin, cocoa and Moringa could serve as a nutritional strategy to enhance nutritional value, thus helping in the treatment of constipation."

Our results showed that PJ and PJ+inulin did not significantly alter the levels of anthropometric and blood biochemical indicators after 3 weeks of treatment. However, there was an increasingly significant impact from placebo to PJ to PJ+inulin on the composition of gut microbiota. Detailed bacterial abundance analysis further showed that PJ+inulin treatment more profoundly resulted in significant changes in the abundance of gut microbiota at each taxonomic level than PJ. Moreover, PJ+inulin treatment also promoted the production of microbiota-associated short-chain fatty acids and pomegranate polyphenol metabolites, which correlated with the abundance of the bacterial genus. Our results suggested that PJ supplemented with inulin modulates gut microbiota composition and thus promotes the production of microbiota-associated metabolites that exert potential beneficial effects in overweight/obese subjects.",

Inulin, in particular, plays a crucial role in activating immune cells and promoting the secretion of cytokines. Therefore, this mini-review aims to emphasize the importance of inulin in immunomodulatory responses, the development of inulin-based hybrid biopolymers, and the role of inulin in enhancing immunity and modifying cell surfaces.

Here, we report on the added value of combining a microbiome screening model, the i-screen, with fresh intestinal tissue explants in a microfluidic gut-on-a-chip model, the Intestinal Explant Barrier Chip (IEBC). Methods: Adult human gut microbiome (fecal pool of 6 healthy donors) was cultured anaerobically in the i-screen platform for 24 h, without and with exposure to 4 mg/mL inulin. The i-screen cell-free culture supernatant was subsequently applied to the luminal side of adult human colon tissue explants (n = 3 donors), fixed in the IEBC, for 24 h and effects were evaluated. Results: The supplementation of the media with inulin promoted the growth of Anaerostipes, Bifidobacterium, Blautia, and Collinsella in the in vitro i-screen, and triggered an elevated production of butyrate by the microbiota. Human colon tissue exposed to inulin-treated i-screen cell-free culture supernatant or control i-screen cell-free culture supernatant with added short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) showed improved tissue barrier integrity measured by a 28.2%-34.2% reduction in FITC-dextran 4000 (FD4) leakage and 1.3 times lower transport of antipyrine. Furthermore, the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-α was reduced under these circumstances. Gene expression profiles confirmed these findings, but showed more profound effects for inulin-treated supernatant compared to SCFA-supplemented supernatant. Conclusion: The combination of i-screen and IEBC facilitates the study of complex intestinal processes such as host-microbial metabolite interaction and gut health."

Results indicated that the APPJ discharge power did not affect the primary structure of pea protein. However, changes in secondary and spatial structure of pea protein were observed. When APPJ discharge power was 600 W, the solubility of glycosylation conjugate was 75.0% and the emulsifying stability index was 98.9 min, which increased by 14.85 and 21.95% than that of only glycosylation sample, respectively. These findings could provide technical support for APPJ treatment combination with glycosylation to enhance the physicochemical properties of plant-based proteins."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Inflammation and hyperlipidemia can cause atherosclerosis. Prebiotic inulin has been proven to effectively reduce inflammation and blood lipid levels. Utilizing a mouse model induced by a high-fat diet, this study aimed to explore whether the characteristic intestinal flora and its metabolites mediate the effects of inulin intervention on atherosclerosis and to clarify the specific mechanism. METHODS: Thirty apolipoprotein E-deficient (ApoE-/-) mice were randomly divided into three groups. They were fed with a normal diet, a high-fat diet or an inulin+high-fat diet for 16 weeks. The total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) in the three groups were compared. The gross aorta and aortic sinus of mice were stained with oil red O, and the area of atherosclerotic plaque was observed and compared. The diversity and structure of the mouse fecal flora were detected by sequencing the V3-V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene, and the levels of metabolites in mouse feces were assessed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The plasma lipopolysaccharide (LPS) levels and aortic inflammatory factors were measured by multi-index flow cytometry (CBA). RESULTS: ApoE-/- mice fed with the high-fat diet exhibited an increase of approximately 46% in the area of atherosclerotic lesions, and the levels of TC, TG and LDL-C were significantly increased ( P < 0.05) compared with levels in the normal diet group. After inulin was added to the high-fat group, the area of atherosclerotic lesions, the level of serum LPS and aortic inflammation were reduced, and the levels of TC, TG and LDL-C were decreased ( P  < 0.05). Based on 16S rRNA gene detection, we found that the composition of the intestinal microbiota, such as Prevotella, and metabolites, such as L-arginine, changed significantly due to hyperlipidemia, and the dietary inulin intervention partially reversed the relevant changes. CONCLUSION: Inulin can inhibit the formation of atherosclerotic plaques, which may be related to the changes in lipid metabolism, the composition of the intestinal microbial community and its metabolites, and the inhibition of the expression of related inflammatory factors. Our study identified the relationships among the characteristic intestinal microbiota, metabolites and atherosclerosis, aiming to provide a new direction for future research to delay or treat atherosclerosis by changing the composition and function of the host intestinal microbiota and metabolites.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Obesity is a worldwide public health problem associated with cognitive and mental health problems in both humans and rats. Studies assessing the effect of fiber supplementation on behavioral deficits and oxidative stress caused by high-fat diet (HFD) consumption in female rats are still scarce. We hypothesized that HFD consumption would lead to anxiety-related behavior and hepatic oxidative stress and that inulin would protect against these changes. We analyzed the impact of HFD-induced obesity combined with fiber supplementation (inulin) on anxiety-related defensive behavior and hepatic oxidative stress. RESULTS: Female rats were fed a high-fat diet (HFD; 45%) for nine weeks to induce obesity. The administration of inulin was found to decrease the adiposity index in both the control and obese groups. The consumption of a HFD combined with inulin supplementation resulted in a reduction in both CAT activity and carbonylated protein levels, leading to a shift in the hepatic redox balance. Interestingly, the behavioral data were conflicting. Specifically, animals that consumed a high-fat diet and received inulin showed signs of impaired learning and memory caused by obesity. The HFD did not impact anxiety-related behaviors in the female rats. However, inulin appears to have an anxiolytic effect, in the ETM, when associated with the HFD. On the other hand, inulin appears to have affected the locomotor activity in the HFD in both open field and light-dark box. CONCLUSION: Our results show that consumption of a HFD induced obesity in female rats, similar to males. However, HFD consumption did not cause a consistent increase in anxiety-related behaviors in female Wistar rats. Treatment with inulin at the dosage used did not exert consistent changes on the behavior of the animals, but attenuated the abdominal WAT expansion and the hepatic redox imbalance elicited by high-fat diet-induced obesity.",

      "abstract": "Gut microbiota manipulation may reverse metabolic abnormalities in obesity. Our previous studies demonstrated that inulin supplementation significantly promoted Bifidobacterium and fat-free mass in obese children. We aimed to study gut-muscle axis from inulin supplementation in these children. In clinical phase, the plasma samples from 46 participants aged 7-15 years, were analyzed for muscle biomarkers before and after 6-month inulin supplementation. In parallel, the plausible mechanism of muscle production via gut-muscle axis was examined using macrophage cell line. Bifidobacterium was cultured in semi-refined medium with inulin used in the clinical phase. Cell-free supernatant was collected and used in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced macrophage cell line to determine inflammatory and anti-inflammatory gene expression. In clinical phase, IL-15 and creatinine/cystatin C ratio significantly increased from baseline to the 6th month. In vitro study showed that metabolites derived from Bifidobacterium capable of utilizing inulin contained the abundance of SCFAs. In the presence of LPS, treatment from Bifidobacterium + inulin downregulated TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β, and iNOS, but upregulated FIZZ-1 and TGF-β expression. Inulin supplementation promoted the muscle biomarkers in agreement with fat-free mass gain, elucidating by Bifidobacterium metabolites derived from inulin digestion showed in vitro anti-inflammatory activity and decreased systemic pro-inflammation, thus promoting muscle production via gut-muscle axis response.Clinical Trial Registry number: NCT03968003.",

      "abstract": "This study is aimed at assessing the impact of soluble dietary fiber inulin on the treatment of diabetes-related chronic inflammation and kidney injury in mice with type 2 diabetes (T2DM). The T2DM model was created by feeding the Institute of Cancer Research (ICR) mice a high-fat diet and intraperitoneally injecting them with streptozotocin (50 mg/kg for 5 consecutive days). The thirty-six ICR mice were divided into three dietary groups: the normal control (NC) group, the T2DM (DM) group, and the DM + inulin diet (INU) group. The INU group mice were given inulin at the dose of 500 mg/kg gavage daily until the end of the 12th week. After 12 weeks, the administration of inulin resulted in decreased serum levels of fasting blood glucose (FBG), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and creatinine (CRE). The administration of inulin not only ameliorated renal injury but also resulted in a reduction in the mRNA expressions of inflammatory factors in the spleen and serum oxidative stress levels, when compared to the DM group. Additionally, inulin treatment in mice with a T2DM model led to a significant increase in the concentrations of three primary short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) (acetic acid, propionic acid, and butyric acid), while the concentration of advanced glycation end products (AGEs), a prominent inflammatory factor in diabetes, exhibited a significant decrease. The results of untargeted metabolomics indicate that inulin has the potential to alleviate inflammatory response and kidney damage in diabetic mice. This beneficial effect is attributed to its impact on various metabolic pathways, including glycerophospholipid metabolism, taurine and hypotaurine metabolism, arginine biosynthesis, and tryptophan metabolism. Consequently, oral inulin emerges as a promising treatment option for diabetes and kidney injury.",

      "abstract": "Inulin, an increasingly studied dietary fiber, alters intestinal microbiota. The aim of this study was to assess whether inulin decreases intestinal colonization by multidrug resistant E. coli and to investigate its potential mechanisms of action. Mice with amoxicillin-induced intestinal dysbiosis mice were inoculated with extended spectrum beta-lactamase producing E. coli (ESBL-E. coli). The combination of inulin and pantoprazole (IP) significantly reduced ESBL-E. coli fecal titers, whereas pantoprazole alone did not and inulin had a delayed and limited effect. Fecal microbiome was assessed using shotgun metagenomic sequencing and qPCR. The efficacy of IP was predicted by increased abundance of 74 taxa, including two species of Adlercreutzia. Preventive treatments with A. caecimuris or A. muris also reduced ESBL-E. coli fecal titers. Fecal microbiota of mice effectively treated by IP was enriched in genes involved in inulin catabolism, production of propionate and expression of beta-lactamases. They also had increased beta-lactamase activity and decreased amoxicillin concentration. These results suggest that IP act through production of propionate and degradation of amoxicillin by the microbiota. The combination of pantoprazole and inulin is a potential treatment of intestinal colonization by multidrug-resistant E. coli. The ability of prebiotics to promote propionate and/or beta-lactamase producing bacteria may be used as a screening tool to identify potential treatments of intestinal colonization by multidrug resistant Enterobacterales.",

      "abstract": "Food allergy is an important health problem that affects human quality of life and socioeconomic development, and its treatment requires improvement. Intestinal flora dysbiosis is closely associated with food allergies. A sensitised mouse model was established by the intraperitoneal injection of ovalbumin (OVA). The mice were randomly divided into four groups: control, model, high-dose (H), and low-dose (L) inulin. The mice were administered water containing different concentrations of inulin four weeks before the OVA injection. Body weight changes were monitored. After the last OVA injection, the mice were scored for allergic reactions. The levels of total immunoglobulin E (IgE) and diamine oxidase (DAO) in the serum and secretory IgA (sIgA) in the small intestinal mucus were measured, and 16S rRNA sequencing of the faecal flora was performed to evaluate microbial parameters. The intestinal flora biomarkers, correlations between them, and biochemical indicators were analysed. Inulin treatment had no effect on the body weight of OVA-sensitised mice but attenuated allergic reactions and intestinal injury in mice. Compared with the control group, the model group had significantly higher levels of serum DAO and IgE and significantly lower levels of intestinal mucus IgA. IgA levels in the intestinal mucus of mice treated with inulin prior to OVA sensitisation were higher than those in non-inulin-treated OVA-sensitised mice. Furthermore, analysis of operational taxonomic units showed that inulin treatment decreased the abundance of Alloprevotella, Rikenellaceae RC9, Eubacterium siraeum, and Eubacterium xylanophilum, and increased the abundance of Blautia and Lachnospiraceae. Serum DAO levels were positively associated with Eubacterium siraeum, Alloprevotella, Eubacterium xylanophilum, and Odoribacter and negatively associated with Blautia, Tyzzerella, Alistipes, Desulfovibrionaceae, and Ruminococcaceae UCG005. In addition, IgE levels were positively associated with Eubacterium siraeum, Alloprevotella, Eubacterium xylanophilum, Odoribacter, and Citrobacter and negatively associated with Blautia, unclassified Ruminococcaceae, and Alistipes. IgA exhibited significant positive correlation with Blautia, norank_f_Eubacterium coprostanoligenes, Alistipes, norank Desulfovibrionaceae, Muribaculum, and Ruminococcaceae U C G 005 and significant negative correlation with Eubacterim siraeum, Eubacterium xylanophilum, Odoribacter, and Citrobacter. Inulin exerts a protective effect against food allergies in mice, which is partially mediated by alterations in the gut microbiota.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Whey protein isolate (WPI) generally represents poor functional properties such as thermal stability, emulsifying activity and antioxidant activity near its isoelectric point or high temperatures, which limit its application in the food industry. The preparation of WPI-polysaccharide covalent conjugates based on Maillard reaction is a promising method to improve the physical and chemical stability and functional properties of WPI. In this research, WPI-inulin conjugates were prepared through wet heating method and ultrasound method and their structural and functional properties were examined. RESULTS: In conjugates, the free amino acid content was reduced, the high molecular bands were emerged at sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), new C-N bonds were formed in Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, and fluorescence intensity was reduced compared with WPI. Furthermore, the result of circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy also showed that the secondary structure of conjugates was changed. Conjugates with ultrasound treatment had better structural properties compared with those prepared by wet heating treatment. The functional properties such as thermal stability, emulsifying activity index (EAI), emulsion stability (ES) and antioxidant activity of conjugates with wet heating treatment were significantly improved compared with WPI. The EAI and ES of conjugates with ultrasound treatment were the highest, but the thermal stability and antioxidant activity were only close to that of the conjugates with wet heating treatment for 2 h. CONCLUSION: This study revealed that WPI-inulin conjugates prepared with ultrasound or wet heating method not only changed the structural characteristics of WPI but also could promote its functional properties including thermal stability, EAI, ES and antioxidant activity. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.",

Inulin, a fructan type of polysaccharide carbohydrate, on the contrary, could promote the growth of beneficial microbes. In this study, we investigated the effect of inulin on antibiotic-induced intestinal microbiota dysbiosis and compared their overall impact at different supplementation stages, i.e., post-antibiotic, at the time of antibiotic administration or prior to antibiotic treatment, in the C57BL/6 mice model. Although supplementation of inulin after antibiotic treatment could aid in the reconstruction of the intestinal microbial community its overall impact was limited and no remarkable differences were identified as compared to the spontaneous restoration. On the contrary, the effect of simultaneous and pre-supplementation was more remarkable. Simultaneous inulin supplementation significantly mitigated the antibiotic-induced dysbiosis based on alterations as evaluated using weighted and unweighted UniFrac distance between baseline and after treatment. Moreover, comparing the effect of simultaneous supplementation, pre-supplemented inulin further mitigated the antibiotic-induced dysbiosis, especially on the relative abundance of dominant microbes. Collectively, the current study found that the use of inulin could alleviate antibiotic-induced microbiota dysbiosis, and the best supplementation stage (overall effect as evaluated by beta diversity distance changes) was before the antibiotic treatment, then simultaneous supplementation and supplementation after the antibiotic treatment.",

      "abstract": "The gut microbiota plays a significant role in the pathogenesis and remission of inflammatory bowel disease. However, conventional antibiotic therapies may alter microbial ecology and lead to dysbiosis of the gut microbiome, which greatly limits therapeutic efficacy. To address this challenge, novel nanomicelles that couple inulin with levofloxacin via disulfide bonds for the treatment of salmonellosis were developed in this study. Owing to their H2S-responsiveness, the nanomicelles can target the inflamed colon and rapidly release levofloxacin to selectively fight against enteric pathogens. Moreover, the embedded inulin can serve as prebiotic fiber to increase the amount of Bifidobacteria and Lactobacilli in mice with salmonellosis, thus maintaining the intestinal mechanical barrier and regulating the balance of the intestinal flora. Therefore, multifunctional nanomicelles had a better curative effect than pure levofloxacin on ameliorating inflammation in vivo. The pathogen-targeted glycovesicle represents a promising drug delivery platform to maximize the efficacy of antibacterial drugs for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease.",

After a 12-week intervention, LIP, LIPA, and HIPA groups exhibited significant improvements in hyperglycemia, glucose tolerance, insulin resistance, inflammatory response, and short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) and blood lipid levels compared to type 2 diabetes mice (MC). After treatment, the gut microbiota composition shifted favorably in the treatment groups which significantly increased the abundance of beneficial bacteria, such as Bacteroides, Blautia, Akkermansia, and Faecalibaculum, and significantly decreased the abundance of Proteus. Metabolomics analysis showed that compared to the MC group, the contents of 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid, 3-hydroxysebacic acid, adenosine monophosphate (AMP), xanthine and hypoxanthine were significantly decreased, while 3-ketosphinganine, sphinganine, and sphingosine were significantly increased in the LIP and LIPA groups, respectively. Additionally, LIP and LIPA not only improved sphingolipid metabolism and purine metabolism pathways but also activated AMP-activated protein kinase to promote β-oxidation by increasing the levels of SCFAs. Faecalibaculum, Blautia, Bacteroides, and Akkermansia exhibited positive correlations with sphingosine, 3-ketosphinganine, and sphinganine, and exhibited negative correlations with hypoxanthine, xanthine and AMP. Faecalibaculum, Blautia, Bacteroides, and Akkermansia may have the potential to improve sphingolipid metabolism and purine metabolism pathways.

Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy showed that SPI was bound to INU via hydrogen bonding. All samples showed a decreasing and then increasing trend of α-helix content with increasing INU concentration. SPI-INU complexes by ultrasound with an INU concentration of 20 mg/mL (U-2) had the lowest content of α-helix, the highest content of random coils and the greatest flexibility, indicating the proteins were most tightly bound to INU in U-2. Both UV spectroscopy and intrinsic fluorescence spectroscopy indicated that it was hydrophobic interactions between INU and SPI. The addition of INU prevented the exposure of tryptophan and tyrosine residues to form a more compact tertiary structure compared to SPI alone, and ultrasound caused further unfolding of the structure of SPI. This indicated that the combined effect of ultrasound and INU concentration significantly altered the tertiary structure of SPI.

Previously, we reported the noteworthy in vitro inhibitory effects of Aspidopterys obcordata fructo oligosaccharide (AOFOS), an active polysaccharide of the traditional Dai medicine Aspidopterys obcordata Hemsl. (commonly known as Hei Gai Guan), on the growth of calcium oxalate crystals. AIM OF THE STUDY: To investigated the effectiveness and mechanism of AOFOS in treating kidney stones. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A kidney stones rats model was developed, followed by examining AOFOS transport dynamics and effectiveness in live rats. Additionally, a correlation between the polysaccharide and calcium oxalate crystals was studied by combining crystallization experiments with density functional theory calculations. RESULTS: The results showed that the polysaccharide was transported to the urinary system. Furthermore, their accumulation was inhibited by controlling their crystallization and modulating calcium ion and oxalate properties in the urine. Consequently, this approach helped effectively prevent kidney stone formation in the rats. CONCLUSIONS: The present study emphasized the role of the polysaccharide AOFOS in modulating crystal properties and controlling crystal growth, providing valuable insights into their potential therapeutic use in managing kidney stone formation.",

      "abstract": "Inulin-type fructan CP-A, a predominant polysaccharide in Codonopsis pilosula, demonstrates regulatory effects on immune activity and anti-inflammation. The efficacy of CP-A in treating ulcerative colitis (UC) is, however, not well-established. This study employed an in vitro lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced colonic epithelial cell model (NCM460) and an in vivo dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis mouse model to explore CP-A's protective effects against experimental colitis and its underlying mechanisms. We monitored the clinical symptoms in mice using various parameters: body weight, disease activity index (DAI), colon length, spleen weight, and histopathological scores. Additionally, molecular markers were assessed through enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), immunofluorescence (IF), immunohistochemistry (IHC), and Western blotting assays. Results showed that CP-A significantly reduced reactive oxygen species (ROS), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), and interleukins (IL-6, IL-1β, IL-18) in LPS-induced cells while increasing IL-4 and IL-10 levels and enhancing the expression of Claudin-1, ZO-1, and occludin proteins in NCM460 cells. Correspondingly, in vivo findings revealed that CP-A administration markedly improved DAI, reduced colon shortening, and decreased the production of myeloperoxidase (MPO), malondialdehyde (MDA), ROS, IL-1β, IL-18, and NOD-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome-associated genes/proteins in UC mice. CP-A treatment also elevated glutathione (GSH) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) levels, stimulated autophagy (LC3B, P62, Beclin-1, and ATG5), and reinforced Claudin-1 and ZO-1 expression, thereby aiding in intestinal epithelial barrier repair in colitis mice. Notably, the inhibition of autophagy via chloroquine (CQ) diminished CP-A's protective impact against colitis in vivo. These findings elucidate that CP-A's therapeutic effect on experimental colitis possibly involves mitigating intestinal inflammation through autophagy-mediated NLRP3 inflammasome inactivation. Consequently, inulin-type fructan CP-A emerges as a promising drug candidate for UC treatment.",

Codonopsis pilosula-derived CP-A (an inulin-type fructan) is an edible Chinese medicine with anti-inflammatory and gastrointestinal protective effects, which may be useful for treating IM. Here, we explored CP-A's role in ameliorating IM induced by 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and investigated the underlying mechanism using in vitro experiments and rat models. Western blotting, immunohistochemistry (IHC), and real-time PCR (RT-PCR) analyses were used to assess protein expression related to the extracellular-regulated protein kinases (ERK)/myosin light chain kinase (MLCK)/myosin light chain 2 (MLC2) signaling pathway and tight junction proteins. Inflammatory factors were quantified using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs), and 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing was employed for cecum content analysis. The results indicated that CP-A restored body weight and food intake and reversed histopathological changes in IM rats. Further, abnormal MLCK activation induced by 5-FU was attenuated by CP-A via the ERK/MLCK/MLC2 pathway. CP-A treatment improved tight junction protein levels and reduced inflammatory factor expression. Moreover, CP-A intervention regulated the intestinal microbiota community structure, increasing the abundance of Lactobacillus and decreasing the abundance of Shigella. In conclusion, CP-A mitigates 5-FU-induced IM by inhibiting the ERK/MLCK/MLC2 pathway, reducing the expression of inflammatory factors, improving the intestinal mucosal barrier, and regulating the intestinal microbial community. This study highlights CP-A's therapeutic potential in IM treatment and provides insights for future research."

      "abstract": "Current treatment options for COVID-19 are limited, with many antivirals and immunomodulators restricted to the most severe cases and preventative care limited to vaccination. As the SARS-CoV-2 virus and its increasing variants threaten to become a permanent fixture of our lives, this new reality necessitates the development of cost-effective and accessible treatment options for COVID-19. Studies have shown that there are correlations between the gut microbiome and severity of COVID-19, especially with regards to production of physiologically beneficial short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) by gut microbes. In this study, we used a Syrian hamster model to study how dietary consumption of the prebiotic inulin affected morbidity and mortality resulting from SARS-CoV-2 infection. After two weeks of observation, we discovered that inulin supplementation attenuated morbid weight loss and increased survival rate in hamster subjects. An analysis of microbiome community structure showed significant alterations in 15 genera. Notably, there were also small increases in fecal DCA and a significant increase in serum DCA, perhaps highlighting a role for this secondary bile acid in conferring protection against SARS-CoV-2. In light of these results, inulin and other prebiotics are promising targets for future investigation as preventative treatment options for COVID-19."

Inulin, as a natural prebiotic, displays anti-inflammatory activity and maintains equilibrium of the intestinal microbiota. In this study, our research aimed to explore the potential of inulin in enhancing intestinal immunity and reducing inflammation in stress-recurrent IBD. In this study, a co-culture intestinal epithelium model and a stress-recurrent IBD mouse model was used to examine the protective effects of inulin. It was observed that inulin digesta significantly reduced pro-inflammatory cytokine expression (CXCL8/IL8 and TNFA) and increased MUC2 expression in intestinal epithelial cells. In vivo, our findings showed that Inulin intake significantly prevented IBD symptoms. This was substantiated by a decrease in serum inflammatory markers (IL-6, CALP) and a downregulation of inflammatory cytokine (Il6) in colon samples. Additionally, inulin intake led to an increase in short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) in cecal contents and a reduction in the expression of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress markers (CHOP, BiP). Our results highlight that inulin can improve stress-recurrent IBD symptoms by modulating microbiota composition, reducing inflammation, and alleviating ER stress. These findings suggested the therapeutic potential of inulin as a dietary intervention for ameliorating stress-recurrent IBD.",

Radiation-induced chronic colonic fibrosis is a common gastrointestinal disorder resulting from the above radiation therapy. In this study, we establish the efficacy of inulin supplements in safeguarding against colonic fibrosis caused by irradiation therapy. Studies have demonstrated that inulin supplements enhance the proliferation of bacteria responsible to produce short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and elevate the levels of SCFAs in feces. In a mouse model of chronic radiation enteropathy, the transplantation of gut microbiota and its metabolites from feces of inulin-treated mice were found to reduce colonic fibrosis in validation experiments. Administering inulin-derived metabolites from gut microbiota led to a notable decrease in the expression of genes linked to fibrosis and collagen production in mouse embryonic fibroblast cell line NIH/3T3. In the cell line, inulin-derived metabolites also suppressed the expression of genes linked to the extracellular matrix synthesis pathway. The results indicate a novel and practical approach to safeguarding against chronic radiation-induced colonic fibrosis.",

The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of ITFs with different degrees of polymerization on insulin resistance, blood lipids, anthropometric measures, and hormonal status in overweight and obese women with PCOS. In a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial, seventy-five women with PCOS aged 18-40 years old were randomly assigned to receive 10 g/day of high-performance inulin (HPI) or oligofructose-enriched inulin (OEI) or maltodextrin for 12 weeks. Biochemical and clinical outcomes were measured at baseline and after the intervention. Participants in the HPI and OEI groups experienced improvements in waist circumference, total testosterone, free androgen index, sex hormone-binding globulin, and triglycerides compared to the placebo group. Also, the number of women with irregular menses or oligomenorrhoea decreased significantly in both ITF groups. Participants in the HPI group reported lower body mass, fasting insulin, and HOMA-IR, as well as a higher quantitative insulin sensitivity check index. ITF supplementation, especially with long-chain ITFs, when given for 12 weeks may improve metabolic outcomes, androgen status and clinical manifestations in women with PCOS."

However, due to the nonspecific distribution and poor bioavailability of drugs, UC treatment is still a serious challenge. Here, a mitochondria/colon dual targeted nanoparticles based on redox response was developed to effectively alleviate UC. Cannabidiol nanoparticles (CBD NPs) with a particle size of 143.2 ± 3.11 nm were prepared by self-assembly using polymers (TPP-IN-LA) obtained by modifying inulin with (5-carboxypentyl) triphenyl phosphonium bromide (TPP) and α-lipoic acid (α-LA). Excitingly, the constructed CBD NPs showed excellent mitochondrial targeting, with a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.76 at 12 h. The results of animal imaging in vivo showed that CBD NPs could be effectively accumulated in colon tissue. Not only that, CBD showed significant glutathione stimulated release in the presence of 10 mM glutathione at pH 7.4. The results of in vivo animal experiments showed that CBD NPs significantly ameliorated DSS-induced colonic inflammation by modulating the TLR4-NF-κB signaling pathway. Moreover, CBD NPs significantly improved the histological damage of colon in UC mice, increased the expression level of tight junction protein ZO-1, and effectively restored the intestinal mucosal barrier function and intestinal mucosal permeability. More importantly, CBD NPs significantly improved the species composition, abundance and amount of short chain fatty acids of intestinal flora in UC mice, thus effectively maintaining the balance of intestinal flora. The dual-targeted and glutathione-responsive nanoparticles prepared in this study provide a promising idea for achieving targeted delivery of CBD for effective treatment of UC."

METHODS: Diabetic model was induced by intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin. Afterward, rats were divided into 6 groups: control, diabetic without treatment, diabetic treated with insulin, diabetic treated with resveratrol, diabetic treated with inulin, and diabetic treated with a combination of inulin and resveratrol. After 10 wk, the creatinine, urea, insulin, urinary proteins, and inflammatory and oxidative stress markers were evaluated. Pathologic changes were examined in kidney tissues. RESULTS: Renal dysfunction, accompanied by increased inflammation and oxidative stress, was observed. Our results showed that treatment with resveratrol and inulin had antidiabetic effects and was associated with reduced renal dysfunction, oxidative stress, and kidney inflammation. In addition, it was observed that combined treatment with inulin and resveratrol outperformed monotherapies in improving kidney function and reducing oxidative stress and inflammation. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with resveratrol and inulin can have renoprotective effects by improving oxidative stress and inflammation in kidney tissues. Therefore, employing these 2 compounds is suggested as an inexpensive and available method for diabetic nephropathy."

      "abstract": "Inulin, as a prebiotic, could modulate the gut microbiota. Burn injury leads to gut microbiota disorders and skeletal muscle catabolism. Therefore, whether inulin can improve burn-induced muscle atrophy by regulating microbiota disorders remains unknown. This study aimed to clarify that inulin intake alleviates gut microbiota disorders and skeletal muscle atrophy in burned rats. Rats were divided into the sham group, burn group, prebiotic inulin intervention group, and pseudo-aseptic validation group. A 30% total body surface area (TBSA) third-degree burn wound on dorsal skin was evaluated in all groups except the sham group. Animals in the intervention group received 7 g/L inulin. Animals in the validation group received antibiotic cocktail and inulin treatment. In our study inulin intervention could significantly alleviate the burn-induced skeletal muscle mass decrease and skeletal myoblast cell apoptosis. Inulin intake increased the abundances of Firmicutes and Actinobacteria but decreased the abundance of Proteobacteria. The biosynthesis of amino acids was the most meaningful metabolic pathway distinguishing the inulin intervention group from the burn group, and further mechanistic studies have shown that inulin can promote the phosphorylation of the myogenesis-related proteins PI3K, AKT and P70S6K and activate PI3K/AKT signaling for protein synthesis. In conclusion, inulin alleviated burn induced muscle atrophy through PI3K/AKT signaling and regulated gut microbiota dysbiosis.",

      "abstract": "Chronic constipation has been associated with depression-like behavior. Previous study identified the crucial role of gut microbiota in the development of constipation and depression. Dietary inulin (INU) could regulate gut microbiota. Whether INU treatment could ameliorate constipation induced depression was not clear. For this purpose, male CD-1 mice were administered diphenoxylate (20 mg/kg body weight/day) to induce constipation. We found that INU (10 % in standard diet) alleviated the diphenoxylate-induced constipation, manifested as the increase weight and moisture content of feces. Furthermore, the associated depression and anxiety-like behavior disorders were improved by inhibiting neuro-inflammation and preventing synaptic ultrastructure damage under INU treatment. Moreover, INU pretreatment improved the diphenoxylate-induced gut barrier damage by upregulating tight junction protein expression. INU also reshaped gut microbiota in constipation mice by increasing the relative abundance of Bacteroides and Proteobacteria and downregulating the abundance of Muribacalum and Melaminabacteria. The effects of INU on diphenoxylate-induced depression were abolished by gut microbiota depletion via antibiotic treatment. In addition, INU increased the concentration of short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) in feces contents. Meanwhile, supplementation of SCFAs could also partly improve diphenoxylate-induced depression. In conclusion, INU intake was a potential nutritional intervention strategy to prevent constipation induced depression via microbiota-gut-SCFAs axis.",

      "abstract": "Fructooligosaccharides (FOS) and inulin are beneficial for human health. However, their benefits differ in individuals who consume prebiotics. Several factors contribute to this variation, including host genetics and differences in the gut microbiota. Bifidobacterium and Bacteroides are strong carbohydrate-utilizing bacteria in the gut, and the level of the Bacteroides/Bifidobacterium (Ba/Bi) ratio in the gut is closely related to the body's ability to utilize prebiotics. However, how to select the type of prebiotics more beneficial for populations with specific Ba/Bi backgrounds and the underlying regulatory mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we explored the dynamics of the gut microbiota and metabolic functions during the in vitro fermentation of FOS and inulin in two different groups: Bacteroides/Bifidobacterium high (H) and Bacteroides/Bifidobacterium low (L). This study revealed that the baseline Ba/Bi ratio had a greater impact on the gut microbiota compared to prebiotic species. Noticeable differences were observed between the two groups after prebiotic intervention, with the H group being more likely to benefit from the prebiotic intervention. Compared to the L group, the H group exhibited significantly higher microbial α-diversity; the co-abundance response group 1 (CARG1) members Ruminococcus gnavus and Blautia involved in the synthesis of propionic and butyric acids increased significantly, the abundance of pathogenic bacteria such as Escherichia Shigella decreased significantly, and the ability to degrade carbohydrates and synthesize fatty acids was greater. Regression modeling showed that the key microbiota could predict the short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) levels, with FOS associated with the ecological roles of CARG2 and CARG7 and inulin associated with CARG4, which provides the basis for the use of prebiotics in nutritional applications and the stratification of populations based on pertinent microbiota profiles to explain the incongruent health effects in human intervention studies.",

      "abstract": "Ulcerative colitis (UC) is an inflammatory disease with abdominal pain, diarrhea, and bloody stool as the main symptoms. Several studies have confirmed that polysaccharides are effective against UC. It is commonly accepted that the traditional benefits of Radix Codonopsis can be attributed to its polysaccharide contents, and inulin-type fructan CP-A is the main active monomer in the polysaccharide components. Herein, we established a 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced UC rat model and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced colonic epithelial cell model (NCM460) to investigate the effect of CP-A on UC. Untargeted metabolomics studies were conducted to identify differential metabolites using ultra-high performance liquid chromatography quadrupole time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-Q-TOF/MS) and enrich metabolic pathways in rat serum. The in vivo assays demonstrated that CP-A reduces colonic macroscopic injury, disease activity index (DAI), histopathological score, interleukin (IL)-8, and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) levels, as well as the expression of intercellular adhesion molecules. On the other hand, CP-A increases IL-10 and transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) levels. The in vitro experiments indicated that CP-A treatment could reduce nitric oxide (NO) and IL-1β after LPS stimulation. The metabolomics results suggested that CP-A therapy for UC may be related to the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway. The in vitro and in vivo validation of the pathway showed similar results, indicating that CP-A alleviates UC by preventing the activation of mTOR/p70S6K signaling pathway. These findings offer a fresh approach to treating UC and a theoretical foundation for the future advancement of CP-A.NEW & NOTEWORTHY We report that an inulin-type fructan from Codonopsis pilosula CP-A exhibits a therapeutic effect on experimental colitis.

Most chemotherapeutic agents exhibit severe adverse effects that are attributed to exposure of drugs to off-target tissues, posing a significant challenge in cancer therapy management. In recent years, inulin, a naturally occurring prebiotic fiber has gained substantial attention for its potential in cancer treatment owing to its multitudinous health values. Its distinctive structure, stability, and nutritional properties position it as an effective adjuvant and carrier for drug delivery in cancer therapy. To address some of the above unmet clinical issues, this review summarizes the recent efforts towards the development of inulin-based nanomaterials and nanocomposites for healthcare applications with special emphasis on the multifunctional role of inulin in cancer therapy as a synergist, signaling molecule, immunomodulatory and anticarcinogenic molecule. Furthermore, the review provides a concise overview of ongoing clinical trials and observational studies associated with inulin-based therapy. In conclusion, the current review offers insights on the significant role of inulin interventions in exploring its potential as a therapeutic agent to treat cancer.",

The organic solvent glycerol (Gly) is considered the current gold-standard cryoprotectant (CPA) for RBC cryopreservation, but the deglycerolization procedure is complex and time-consuming, resulting in severe hemolysis. Therefore, it remains a research hotspot to find biocompatible and effective novel CPAs. Herein, the natural and biocompatible inulin, a polysaccharide, was first employed as a CPA for RBC cryopreservation. The presence of inulin could improve the thawed RBC recovery from 11.83 ± 1.40 to 81.86 ± 0.37%. It was found that inulin could promote vitrification because of its relatively high viscosity and glass transition temperature (Tg'), thus reducing the damage during cryopreservation. Inulin possessed membrane stability, which also had beneficial effects on RBC recovery. Moreover, inulin could inhibit the mechanical damage induced by ice recrystallization during thawing. After cryopreservation, the RBC properties were maintained normally. Mathematical modeling analysis was adopted to compare the performance of inulin, Gly, and hydroxyethyl starch (HES) in cryopreservation, and inulin presented the best efficiency. This work provides a promising CPA for RBC cryopreservation and may be beneficial for transfusion therapy in the clinic.",

In this study, an inulin neoseries-type fructan designated as OJP-W2 was obtained and characterized from Ophiopogonis Radix, and its potential therapeutic effect on liver fibrosis in vivo were investigated. Structural studies revealed that OJP-W2 had a molecular weight of 5.76 kDa and was composed of glucose and fructose with a molar ratio of 1.00:30.87.

This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study was conducted to confirm that consumption of GCL2505 and inulin reduces abdominal fat (n = 120). Participants consumed a test beverage containing 1 × 1010 colony-forming units of GCL2505 per 100 g and 2.0 g of inulin per 100 g for 12 weeks. A change in the visceral fat area (VFA) was set as the primary endpoint. There were significant reductions in VFA and total fat area. The intervention significantly increased the total number of bifidobacteria and affected the levels of several lipid markers. Regression analysis of bifidobacteria and measured parameters showed that total bifidobacteria correlated with VFA and body mass index (BMI), while endogenous bifidobacteria and Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis correlated only with BMI, suggesting that increases in both contributed to the decrease in VFA.

      "abstract": "Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) is a widely used industrial compound that has been found to induce intestinal toxicity. However, the underlying mechanisms have not been fully clarified and effective interventions are rarely developed. Inulin, a prebiotic, has been used as a supplement in human daily life as well as in gastrointestinal diseases and metabolic disorders. In this study, male mice were exposed to PFOA with or without inulin supplementation to investigate the enterotoxicity and potential intervention effects of inulin. Mice were administered PFOA at 1 mg/kg/day, PFOA with inulin at 5 g/kg/day, or Milli-Q water for 12 weeks. Histopathological analysis showed that PFOA caused colon shortening, goblet cell reduction, and inflammatory cell infiltration. The expression of the tight junction proteins ZO-1, occludin and claudin5 significantly decreased, indicating impaired barrier function. According to the RNA-sequencing analysis, PFOA exposure resulted in 917 differentially expressed genes, involving 39 significant pathways, such as TNF signaling and cell cycle pathways. In addition, the protein expression of TNF-α, IRG-47, cyclinB1, and cyclinB2 increased, while Gadd45γ, Lzip, and Jam2 decreased, suggesting the involvement of the TNF signaling pathway, cell cycle, and cell adhesion molecules in PFOA-associated intestinal injury. Inulin intervention alleviated PFOA-induced enterotoxicity by activating the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway and increasing the protein expression of Wnt1, β-catenin, PI3K, Akt3, and p62, while suppressing MAP LC3β, TNF-α, and CyclinE expression. These findings suggested that PFOA-induced intestinal injury, including inflammation and tight junction disruption, was mitigated by inulin through modifying the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathways. Our study provides valuable insights into the enterotoxic effects of PFOA and highlights the potential therapeutic role of inulin.",

      "abstract": "Increasing evidence supports the existence of fetal-originated adult diseases. Recent research indicates that the intrauterine environment affects the fetal hypothalamic energy intake center. Inulin is a probiotic that can moderate metabolic disorders, but whether maternal inulin intervention confers long-term metabolic benefits to lipid metabolism in offspring in their adult lives and the mechanism involved are unknown. Here, we used a maternal overnutrition model that was induced by excess energy intake before and during pregnancy and lactation and maternal inulin intervention was performed during pregnancy and lactation. The hypothalamic genome methylation in offspring was analyzed using a methylation array. The results showed that maternal inulin treatment modified the maternal high-fat diet (HFD)-induced increases in body weight, adipose tissue weight, and serum insulin and leptin levels and decreases in serum adiponectin levels. Maternal inulin intervention regulated the impairments in hypothalamic leptin resistance, induced the methylation of Socs3, Npy, and Il6, and inhibited the methylation of Lepr in the hypothalamus of offspring. In conclusion, maternal inulin intervention modifies offspring lipid metabolism, and the underlying mechanism involves the methylation of genes in the hypothalamus feeding circuit.",

      "abstract": "Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic and refractory condition characterized by disrupted epithelial barrier, dysregulated immune balance, and altered gut microbiota. Nano-enabled interventions for restoring gut homeostasis have the potential to alleviate inflammation in IBD. Herein, we developed a combination of olsalazine (Olsa)-based nanoneedles and microbiota-regulating inulin gel to reshape intestinal homeostasis and relieve inflammation. The Olsa-derived nanoneedles exhibited reactive oxygen species scavenging ability and anti-inflammatory effects in lipopolysaccharide-simulated macrophages. The composite of nanoneedles and inulin gel (Cu2(Olsa)/Gel) displayed a macroporous structure, improved bio-adhesion, and enhanced colon retention after oral administration. Mechanistically, the composite effectively downregulated pro-inflammatory cytokine levels and promoted epithelial barrier repair through anti-inflammatory and antioxidant therapies, resulting in significant alleviation of colitis in three animal models of IBD. Furthermore, analysis of gut microbiota revealed that Cu2(Olsa)/Gel treatment increased the diversity of intestinal microflora and decreased the relative abundance of pathogenic bacteria such as Proteobacteria. Overall, this study provides a self-delivering nanodrug and dietary fiber hydrogel composite for IBD therapy, offering an efficient approach to restore intestinal homeostasis."

      "abstract": "The aim of the study was to compare the properties of inulin hydrogels obtained with different methods, e.g., the traditional-thermal method and new, non-thermal methods, used in food production, like ultrasonic, high-pressure homogenization (HPH), and high hydrostatic pressures (HHPs). It was found that each of the compared induction methods allowed for obtaining inulin hydrogels. However, the use of non-thermal induction methods allows for obtaining a gel structure faster than in the case of thermal induction. In addition, hydrogels obtained with new, non-thermal methods differ from gels obtained with thermal treatment. They were characterized by higher stability (from 1.7 percent point-of-stability parameters for HHP 150 MPa to 18.8 for HPH II cycles) and in most cases, by improved microrheological properties-lower solid-liquid balance toward the solid phase, increased elasticity and viscosity indexes, and lowering the flow index. The gels obtained with the new, non-thermal method were also characterized by a more delicate structure, including lower firmness (the differences between thermal and non-thermal inductions were from 0.73 N for HHP at 500 MPa to 2.39 N for HHP at 150 MPa) and spreadability (the differences between thermal and non-thermal inductions were from 7.60 Ns for HHP at 500 MPa to 15.08 Ns for HHP at 150 MPa). The color of ultrasound-induced inulin gels, regarding the HPH and HHP technique, was darker (the differences in the L* parameter between thermal and non-thermal inductions were from 1.92 for HHP at 500 MPa to 4.37 for 10 min ultrasounds) and with a lower a* color parameter (the differences in the a* parameter between thermal and non-thermal inductions were from 0.16 for HHP at 500 MPa to 0.39 for HPH II cycles) and b* color parameter (the differences in the b* parameter between thermal and non-thermal inductions were from 1.69 for 5 min ultrasounds to 2.68 for HPH II cycles). It was also found that among the compared induction methods, the high-pressure technique has the greatest potential for modifying the properties of the created inulin hydrogels. Thanks to its application, depending on the amount of applied pressure, it was possible to obtain gels with very different characteristics, both delicate (i.e., soft and spreadable), using HHP at 150 MPa, and hard, using HHP at 500 MPa, the closest in characteristics to gels induced with the thermal method. This may allow the properties of hydrogels to be matched to the characteristics of the food matrix being created."

      "abstract": "Prebiotics are known to modulate the gut microbiota, but there is host variability, mainly due to differences in carbohydrate-utilisation by gut microbiota. Bifidobacterium and Bacteroides are powerful carbohydrate-utilising bacteria, and the ratio of both is closely related to the utilisation of prebiotics. However, the differential impact of prebiotics on the composition and function of the gut microbiota and its metabolites in participants with different Bacteroides/Bifidobacterium (Ba/Bi) ratios have not been studied. Here, we conducted a 4-week randomised double-blind, parallel four-arm trial using two prebiotics (oligofructose and inulin) in two populations with high Ba/Bi (H) and low Ba/Bi (L). The response to prebiotics in both populations was influenced by the baseline microbiota background specificity. Notably, at an overall level, FOS was slightly better than inulin in modulating the gut microbiota. Difference in gut microbiota regulation by FOS across microbiota contexts were significant between the two groups. Butyric acid-producing bacteria were significantly more abundant in H and further elevated butyric acid and related metabolite levels, with H more likely to benefit from the FOS intervention. The two groups showed only metabolic differences in their response to inulin, with L showing a significant increase in propionic acid and being enriched in glycolysis functions, whereas H was enriched in amino acids and aminoglycolysis functions. Overall, these results provide a basis for selecting appropriate prebiotics for participants with different gut backgrounds.",
