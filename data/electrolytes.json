      "abstract": "Low ionic conductivity, poor mechanical strength, and unstable interface structure are still the main factors hindering the practical application of polymer solid-state lithium metal batteries (SSLMBs). In this work, we have developed a unique composite filler (LLZTOCDs) for solid polymer electrolytes to address these challenges through synergistic regulation of multi-interface chemistry. The LLZTOCDs is prepared via thermal treatment of N,S,F-codoped carbon dots (NSFCDs) and Li6.5La3Zr1.5Ta0.5O12 (LLZTO) inorganic electrolyte. Here, the detrimental Li2CO3 on the LLZTO surface is converted into a fast ion-conducting and an electron-insulating interlayer of LiF and Li3N, and the carbon dots self-assemble into a functional organophilic coating on the outermost layer, which acts as a bridge between the LLZTO and the polymer. This unique structure enhances the compatibility and ion-exchange kinetics between the LLZTOCDs and the polymer, significantly improving the mechanical strength and Li+ transport. Additionally, the oxygen vacancies formed in situ at the LLZTOCDs interface provide an anion confinement effect, increasing lithium salt dissociation, and enhancing the Li+ transference number to 0.85. Therefore, the solid battery constructed with LLZTOCDs exhibits excellent electrochemical stability, long-cycle life, and high ionic conductivity (1.96 × 10- 4 S cm-1 at 25 °C), providing a feasible strategy for practical applications."

      "abstract": "Oxide ceramic electrolytes for realization of high-energy lithium metal batteries typically require high-temperature processes to achieve the desired phase formation and inter-particle sintering. However, such high-temperature processing can lead to compositional changes or mechanical deformation, compromising material reliability. Here, we introduce a disorder-driven, sintering-free approach to synthesize garnet-type solid electrolyte via the creation of an amorphous matrix followed by a single-step mild heat-treatment. The softened mechanical property (yield pressure, Py = 359.8 MPa) of disordered base materials enables the facile formation of a dense amorphous matrix and the preserving of inter-particle connectivity during crystallization. The formation of the cubic-phase garnet is triggered at a lowered temperature of 350 °C, achieving a Li+ ionic conductivity of 1.8 × 10-4 S/cm at 25 °C through a single-step mild heat treatment at 500 °C. The disorder-driven garnet solid electrolyte exhibits electrochemical performance comparable to conventional garnet solid electrolyte sintered at >1100 °C. These findings will promote the fabrication of uniform, thin, and wide solid electrolyte membranes, which is a significant hurdle in the commercialization of oxide-based lithium metal batteries, and demonstrate the untapped capabilities of garnet-type oxide solid electrolytes."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Most antidepressants with similar pharmacological characteristics exhibit comparable therapeutic efficacy but differ in side effects. Therefore, we used a retrospective design to compare biochemical changes induced by six antidepressants and identify differences among them. METHODS: Case records from 1706 hospitalized patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) receiving antidepressant monotherapy were divided into six groups based on the specific antidepressants used: paroxetine, sertraline, fluoxetine, escitalopram, venlafaxine, and duloxetine. Electrolytes, hepatic and renal functions, body weight, and glycolipid metabolism were assessed at baseline and 2 weeks post-antidepressant initiation. Paired analysis was used for comparing the changes prior to and after administration within each group, and analysis of covariance was used for evaluating the distinctions among the six groups. RESULTS: After 2 weeks of treatment, significant decreases in serum sodium and chloride levels were observed with venlafaxine, duloxetine, and fluoxetine, while potassium, phosphorus, and carbon dioxide concentrations tended to increase across all six antidepressants. In terms of hepatic indicators, these antidepressants significantly elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and γ-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) levels, with duloxetine showing the most pronounced changes from baseline, while decreasing total and direct bilirubin. Sertraline effectively reduced uric acid, although changes in renal indicators were mild with other antidepressants. Notably, these antidepressants were associated with an unfavorable lipid profile, particularly elevated triglycerides and cholesterol, but they lowered blood glucose during the acute phase. LIMITATION: Residual confounding may indirectly influence the retrospective outcomes. CONCLUSION: Early biochemical changes can distinguish differences among antidepressants and guide individualized medication.",

      "abstract": "Aqueous batteries, such as aqueous zinc-ion batteries (AZIB), have garnered significant attention because of their advantages in intrinsic safety, low cost, and eco-friendliness. However, aqueous electrolytes tend to freeze at low temperatures, which limits their potential industrial applications. Thus, one of the core challenges in aqueous electrolyte design is optimizing the formula to prevent freezing while maintaining good ion conductivity. However, the experimental trial-and-error approach is inefficient for this purpose, and existing simulation tools are either inaccurate or too expensive for high-throughput phase transition predictions. In this work, we employ a small amount of experimental data and differentiable simulation techniques to develop a multimodal optimization workflow. With minimal human intervention, this workflow significantly enhances the prediction power of classical force fields for electrical conductivity. Most importantly, the simulated electrical conductivity can serve as an effective predictor of electrolyte freezing at low temperatures. Generally, the workflow developed in this work introduces a new paradigm for electrolyte design. This paradigm leverages both easily measurable experimental data and fast simulation techniques to predict properties that are challenging to access by using either approach alone."

A better outcome can be achieved with electrochemical dissolution without mechanical injury. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Several electrochemical dissolution solutions are being used including artificial saliva, Tyrode's solution, and sodium fluoride (NaF). These electrolytes were prepared and their respective electrochemical characterization was done before conducting the assay. The present in vitro study compares the possible cytotoxic effect and viability of periodontal ligament cells in artificial saliva, Tyrode's solution, and NaF using an MTT assay. RESULTS: The comparative analyses of the cell viability and toxicity effects of the electrolytes considered are reported. It was observed that the Artificial saliva (before dissolution: 84.10±11.32; after dissolution: 69.1±11.32) and Tyrode's solution (before dissolution: 77.30±4.11; after dissolution: 61.3±4.11) showed higher cell viability percentages and comparatively reduced toxicity levels before and after dissolution compared to NaF (before dissolution: 36.01±5.27; after dissolution: 11.01±5.27). Statistical analysis of the results observed before and after dissolution provided a significant difference (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The artificial saliva and the Tyrode's solution may be considered as a potential electrochemical dissolution solution during the surgery to achieve a better outcome."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The pharmacological treatment of Giardia lamblia infection involves the use of chemical agents, such as metronidazole (MNZ). However, these medications are associated with a range of adverse effects, and their effectiveness is not definitively established. In light of the previously discussed information and the recognized antimicrobial properties of Ferula macrecolea, this study aims to investigate both the in vitro and in vivo anti-giardial effects of F. macrecolea essential oil (FME) on G. lamblia infection. METHODS: Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) was utilized to analyze the chemical composition of the prepared FME. The MTT colorimetric assay was employed to assess FME's in vitro anti-giardial and cytotoxic activities. FME's in vivo effects were evaluated compared to MNZ in mice infected with G. lamblia. Additionally, the effects of FME therapy on serum electrolyte levels and the expression levels of inflammatory cytokines were assessed. RESULTS: The primary components of FME were identified as terpinolene (78.72%), n-nonanal (4.47%), and linalool (4.35%). FME significantly reduced the viability and growth rate of G. lamblia trophozoites (IC50 = 21.6 μg/mL) and cysts (IC50 = 27.6 μg/mL) in a dose-dependent manner compared to the control group (p < 0.001). The CC50 value for FME against normal intestinal cells was determined to be 207.4 μg/mL. In vivo, assays demonstrated that the administration of various doses of FME, particularly in combination with MNZ over 7 days, resulted in a statistically significant reduction in the mean number and viability of Giardia cysts, serum level electrolytes (sodium and potassium), and the expression levels of interleukin-1 (IL-1), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), nuclear factor κB p65 (NF-κB p65), and Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR-4) in mice with giardiasis (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: This study's results demonstrate the extract's efficacy in vitro against G. lamblia, exhibiting minimal cytotoxicity towards normal cells. Furthermore, the extract was shown to manage giardiasis in murine models by modulating electrolyte levels and inflammatory responses via suppressing the NF-κB p65/TLR pathways. However, further research is necessary to clarify the specific efficacy and mechanisms of action of the extract in combating G. lamblia infection."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The present study looked at how electrolytes, hormones, and postpartum reproductive physiology were affected in black Bengal goats (BBGs) when they were fed a phthalate mixture (PHA). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty clinically healthy BBGs, 1-2 months pregnant, aged 6-8 months with a body weight of 10-12 kg, were chosen and randomly allocated to two experimental groups (n = 10 each). The BBGs of the treatment group (n = 10) were administered a standard ration containing a mixture of Diethyl Phthalate, Dibutyl Phthalate, Di-isobutyl Phthalate, and Dipropyl Phthalate phthalate. The non-treated control group (n = 10) received the goat ration without any phthalates up to parturition. Blood samples were taken from experimental pregnant goats just before parturition to analyze serum hormone and electrolyte levels. RESULTS: The levels of sodium, chloride, and calcium were reduced (p < 0.05) in PHA-exposed goats than in the non-exposed control group. No significant difference was observed in potassium and phosphorus levels between the two groups. PHA-exposed goats showed significantly decreased levels of estrogen, progesterone, luteinizing hormone, and thyroxin compared to control goats (p < 0.05). Postpartum reproductive traits, such as gestation length, postpartum heat period, abortion rate, and retained placenta, were significantly (p < 0.05) prolonged in BBG that had been exposed to PHA. CONCLUSION: PHA plasticizer exposure during pregnancy affects the electrolytes, hormones, and postpartum reproductive physiology of BBGs."

These fluids can influence acid-base and electrolyte status. This prospective randomised study compared two balanced crystalloid solutions regarding their effect on acid-base status, electrolytes and LAC concentrations in dehydrated cats after intravenous fluid therapy. METHODS: A total of 100 client-owned cats presenting to the emergency service with dehydration ⩾5% due to diarrhoea, vomiting or anorexia were included in this study. They were randomised to receive either ACE- (Sterofundin ISO; B Braun Vet Care) or LAC-containing (Ringer-Laktat nach Hartmann; B. Braun Vet Care) fluids for rehydration. Exclusion criteria were age <6 months, severe electrolyte abnormalities, severely increased creatinine or bolus therapy, and decompensated heart disease and liver diseases. Vital parameters were assessed and venous blood gas analysis was performed before and after fluid therapy. Data were analysed using the Mann-Whitney U-test and the Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-rank test. The significance level was set at P ⩽0.05. RESULTS: Post-rehydration pH normalised, and bicarbonate and base excess increased in both groups. Anion gap and LAC and potassium concentrations decreased in both groups. No difference in electrolyte, acid-base status and LAC was observed between cats receiving ACE and cats receiving LAC. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Both fluids have similar effects on dehydrated cats' acid-base status and electrolyte and LAC concentrations. No significant differences in values were found between ACE- and LAC-containing resuscitation fluids. Blood LAC concentration decreased in both groups.",

      "abstract": "Ion-containing polymers are subject to a wide range of hydration conditions across electrochemical and water treatment applications. Significant work on dry polymer electrolytes for batteries and highly swollen membranes for water purification has informed our understanding of ion transport under extreme conditions. However, knowledge of intermediate conditions (i.e., low hydration) is essential to emerging applications (e.g., electrolyzers, fuel cells, and lithium extraction). Ion transport under low levels of hydration is distinct from the extreme conditions typically investigated, and the relevant physics cannot be extrapolated from existing knowledge, stifling materials design. In this study, we conducted ion transport measurements in LiTFSI-doped polyethers that were systematically hydrated from dry conditions. A semiautomated apparatus that performs parallel measurements of water uptake and ionic conductivity in thin-film polymers under controlled humidity was developed. For the materials and swelling range considered in this study (i.e., <0.07 g water/g dry polymer electrolyte), ionic conductivity depends nonlinearly on water uptake, with the initial sorbed water weakly affecting conductivity. With additional increases in swelling, more significant increases in conductivity were observed. Remarkably, changes in conductivity induced by water sorption were correlated with the number of water molecules per lithium ion, with the normalized molar conductivity of different samples effectively collapsing onto one another until this unit of hydration exceeded the solvation number of lithium ions under aqueous conditions. These results provide important knowledge regarding the effects of trace water contamination on conductivity measurements in polymer electrolytes and demonstrate that the lithium-ion solvation number marks a key transition point regarding the influence of water on ion transport in ion-containing polymers."

Electrolyte derangements have been reported by various studies to be among the most common side effects following diuretic therapy. Despite that, there is limited documentation on the magnitude of this problem in our setting. This study, therefore, aimed to identify clinical characteristics and determine the magnitude of electrolyte abnormalities among children with heart failure who were on diuretic therapy at Jakaya Kikwete Cardiac Institute, Tanzania. METHODS: this hospital-based cross-sectional study was conducted among children with heart failure admitted at Jakaya Kikwete Cardiac Institute (JKCI), Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. A pretested structured questionnaire was used to collect data on socio-demographics, clinical characteristics, and levels of serum electrolytes. RESULTS: a total of 385 children whose ages ranged from 1 month to 18 years were enrolled in this study. Most of them (271 (70%)) were below 5 years and their median age was 2.1 (IQR=0.8-6) years. Ventricular septal defect (VSD) was the most common acyanotic CHD, observed in 122 children out of 385 (31.6%). Nearly half (186 (48%)) of the children were in class IV of the Ross Heart Failure Classification. Slightly more than half of the study participants (202 (53%)) and 182 (47%) of the children had hyponatremia and hypocalcemia respectively. Only 8% (32/385) had hypokalemia. There was no observed association between hyponatremia and furosemide dosage (P=0.33) in children in this study. CONCLUSION: a significant number of children with heart failure on diuretic therapy had hyponatremia and hypocalcemia hence, routine electrolytes monitoring is recommended.",

The content of electrolytes and gases in the collection could participate in the growth and expansion mechanism, however, there is no evidence that they have been studied before. The objective has been to identify electrolyte, gas and internal metabolomic markers of the content of chronic subdural hematomas, with the possibility of participating in their growth and expansion and to substantiate a pathophysiological hypothesis that interacts with existing ones. MATERIAL AND METHOD: A descriptive study was carried out with 53 patients operated on for chronic subdural hematoma, at the \"Roberto Rodríguez Fernández\" General Teaching Hospital of Morón in Ciego de Ávila, Cuba, in the period between January 2019 and December 2023. The diagnoses were obtained with computed axial tomography. The electrolyte and blood gas components of hematomas are correlated with clinical and neuroimaging variables. RESULTS: Patients over 70 years of age predominated, 37 (69.81%) and males 38 (71.70%). The Markwalder scale upon admission showed a predominance of Grade III in 24 cases (45.28%). The Glasgow outcome scale showed a predominance of Grade V, 31 (58.49%). CONCLUSIONS: Electrolyte and gasometric metabolomic markers of subdural blood can promote the phenomenon of progressive growth and expansion and have a synergistic effect with the rest of the pathophysiological mechanisms.",

Despite its widespread use in the fabrication of LLZO ceramics, the chemical composition of the UF-sintered LLZO surface remains largely unexplored. This study presents an in-depth analysis of the surface chemistry of UF-sintered LLZO using comprehensive techniques, including depth-profiling X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and focused-ion-beam time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectroscopy (FIB-TOF-SIMS). Our investigation uncovers a striking difference between the surface of UF-sintered and conventionally sintered LLZO, revealing predominant surface contamination by Li2O up to ca. 40 nm depth in the case of UF processing. Comparative synchrotron X-ray diffraction data during UF and conventional sintering elucidate the origin of surface contamination. We propose a viable solution to this issue through an additional heat treatment (HT) step at 900 °C after UF sintering, as corroborated by XPS and FIB-TOF-SIMS measurements. Furthermore, we present a comparative assessment of the electrochemical performance of Li/LLZO/Li symmetric cells based on UF-sintered LLZO pellets, both with and without the post-HT step, underscoring the pivotal role of an uncontaminated LLZO surface."

      "abstract": "Developing solid-state lithium metal batteries with wide operating temperature range is important in future. Polyethylene oxide (PEO)-based solid-state electrolytes are extensively studied for merits including superior flexibility and low glass transition temperature. However, ideal usage temperatures for conventional PEO-based solid-state electrolytes are between 60 and 65 °C, and unequable temperature degrades their electrochemical performances at low and high temperatures (≤25 °C and ≥80 °C). Herein, modification methods of PEO electrolytes for low, high especially wide-temperature applications are reviewed based on detailed analyses of mechanisms involved in its modification at different temperatures. First, shortcomings of PEO solid electrolytes due to influence of temperature are pointed out. Second, existing modification strategies are summarized in detail from three aspects of high, low especially wide temperatures, including application of PEO derivatives or chain segment modification treatment of PEO, addition of fillers, and other modification methods such as reasonable regulation of lithium salts, introduction of functional layers and addition of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) or covalent organic frameworks (COFs). Finally, a summary and description of PEO-based solid electrolyte research and development trends for wide-temperature applications are provided. The review aims to offer some guidance for the creation of PEO solid batteries with wider working temperature ranges."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Postoperative fluid and electrolyte management is crucial for adequate patients' recovery and healing. This audit aimed to assess the current practice of postoperative intravenous fluids (IV) and electrolyte administration and investigate postoperative electrolyte disturbances. METHOD: This study was conducted at Soba Teaching Hospital and comprised two cycles, it examined adult patients who underwent abdominal surgery and were exclusively on postoperative intravenous fluid therapy for at least one day. Exclusions were made for certain conditions (Heart or renal failure, ICU admissions, day surgeries). Data collected from medical records including intravenous fluid types and amounts, electrolytes, and daily serum sodium and potassium levels, were compared to British Consensus Guidelines on Intravenous Fluid Therapy for Adult Surgical Patients (GIFTASUP). Following cycle one, regular educational sessions were conducted for medical staff, emphasizing the need for improved practices in postoperative care. RESULTS: A total of 14 patients in cycle one and 15 patients in cycle two were included. The data analysis unit was the patient-day. Patient-days refers to the total number of days patients were on IV fluids after surgery, starting from the day after the operation and excluding the day of surgery. It is calculated by adding up the number of days each patient remained exclusively on IV fluids. A total of 33 and 30 patient-days were analyzed in cycle one and cycle two respectively. The recommended daily amount of IV fluids for maintenance was given in 0.00% of patient-days in cycle one as compared to 76.7% in cycle two. Sodium and potassium doses were given within the recommended range of 0.00% and 24% patient-days respectively in cycle one. In cycle two, sodium and potassium were given according to the guidelines in 46.7% and 60% of patient-days respectively. Electrolyte disturbances occurred in 69.7% of patient-days in cycle one, decreasing to 46.7% in cycle two, primarily in the form of hyponatremia and hypokalemia. CONCLUSION: This study highlighted the need for continued monitoring and emphasized the importance of adequate medical staff training about postoperative IV fluids and electrolytes."

      "abstract": "We predict the thermodynamic behavior of bulk electrolytes from an ionic hard-core (HC) size-augmented self-consistent formalism incorporating asymmetrically the short- and long-range ion interactions via their virial and cumulant treatment, respectively. The characteristic splitting length separating these two ranges is obtained from a variational equation solved together with the Schwinger-Dyson (SD) equations. Via comparison with simulation results from the literature, we show that the asymmetric treatment of the distinct interaction ranges significantly extends the validity regime of our previously developed purely cumulant-level Debye-Hückel (DH) theory. Namely, for monovalent solutions with typical ion sizes, the present formalism can accurately predict up to molar concentrations the liquid pressure dominated by HC interactions, the internal energies driven by charge correlations, and the local ion distributions governed by the competition between HC and electrostatic interactions. We evaluate as well the screening length of the liquid and investigate the deviations of the macromolecular interaction range from the DH length. In fair agreement with simulations and experiments, our theory is shown to reproduce the overscreening and underscreening effects occurring respectively in submolar mono- and multivalent electrolytes."

One of the main limitations is the detrimental presence of Li2CO3 on the surface of LLZO particles, restricting Li-ion transport at the polymer-ceramic interfaces. In this work, a facile way to improve this interface is presented, by purposely engineering the LLZO particle surfaces for a better compatibility with a PEO:LiTFSI solid polymer electrolyte matrix. It is shown that a surface treatment based on immersing LLZO particles in a boric acid solution can improve the LLZO surface chemistry, resulting in an enhancement in the ionic conductivity and cation transference number of the CPE with 20 wt % of boron-treated LLZO particles compared to the analogous CPE with non-treated LLZO. Ultimately, an improved cycling performance and stability in Li//LiFePO4 cells was also demonstrated for the modified material."

However, Li-containing Al electrolytes often contain large amounts of F, leading to environmental pollution. Herein, a new method for preparing water-soluble Li salt from waste Li-containing Al electrolytes with high F and Na contents is proposed based on CaO roasting and water leaching. The effects of different roasting and leaching conditions on the Li leaching efficiency and reaction pathway were systematically investigated. Under the optimum processing conditions, the Li leaching efficiency reached 98%, while those of Na and F were 98.41% and 0.24%, respectively. Phase evolution analysis showed that the addition of CaO promoted the conversion of LiF and Na2LiAlF6 to Li2O, whereas F entered the slag phase as CaF2, which could be reused as a raw material for steel refinement. Overall, this study proposes an efficient and environmentally friendly method for the treatment and resource utilization of waste Al electrolytes with high F and Na contents.",

      "abstract": "Acute nondiarrheal illnesses (NDIs) involve overt or subclinical dehydration, requiring rehydration and electrolyte repletion. Dehydration is frequently under-recognized and under-managed, both in outpatient departments (OPDs) and inpatient departments (IPDs). Postadmission dehydration is associated with longer hospital stays and higher inhospital mortality rates. Recognizing and understanding dehydration in hospitalized patients is necessary due to the adverse outcomes associated with this condition. In this article, we aimed to develop practical consensus recommendations on the role of oral fluid, electrolyte, and energy (FEE) management in hospitalized patients with FEE deficits in NDI. The modified Delphi consensus methodology was utilized to reach a consensus. A scientific committee comprising eight experts from India formed the panel. Relevant clinical questions within three major domains were formulated for presentation and discussion: (1) burden and factors contributing to dehydration in hospitalized patients; (2) assessment of fluid and electrolyte losses and increased energy requirements in hospitalized patients; and (3) management of FEE deficits in hospitalized patients [at admission, during intravenous (IV) therapy, IV to oral de-escalation, and discharge]. The consensus level was classified into agreement (mean score ≥4), no consensus (mean score <4), and exclusion (mean score <4 after the third round of discussion). The questions that lacked agreement were discussed during the virtual meeting. The experts agreed that the most common factors contributing to dehydration in patients with NDI hospitalized in IPDs include decreased oral fluid intake, increased fluid loss due to the illness, insensible fluid loss, and a lack of awareness among doctors about dehydration, which can result in poor fluid intake. Time constraints, discontinuity of care, lack of awareness of the principles of fluid balance, lack of formal procedures for enforcing hydration schemes, and lack of adequate training are most often barriers to the assessment of hydration status in hospital settings. Experts used hydration biomarkers, such as changes in body weight, serum, or plasma osmolality; fluid intake; and fluid balance charts; along with urine output, frequency, quantity, and color, to determine hydration status in hospital settings. Experts agreed that appropriate FEE supplementation in the form of ready-to-drink (RTD) fluids can restore FEE deficits and shorten the length of hospital stays in hospitalized patients at admission, during de-escalation from IV to oral therapy, and at discharge. RTD electrolyte solutions with known concentrations of electrolytes and energy are good choices to avoid taste fatigue and replenish FEE in hospitalized patients during transition care and at discharge.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Dehydration is a highly prevalent clinical challenge in adults which can go undetected. Although dehydration is commonly associated with an increased risk of hospitalization and mortality, only a few international guidelines provide recommendations regarding oral fluids, electrolytes, and energy (FEE) management in adults/geriatrics with dehydration due to nondiarrheal causes. Currently, there is a lack of comprehensive recommendations on the role of oral FEE in nondiarrheal dehydration in adult and geriatric Indian patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A modified Delphi approach was designed using an online questionnaire-based survey followed by a virtual meeting, and another round of online surveys was used to develop this consensus recommendation. In round one, 130 statements, including 21 open-ended questions, were circulated among ten national experts who were asked to either strongly agree, agree, disagree, or strongly disagree with statements and provide responses to open-ended questions. The consensus was predefined at 75% agreement (pooling \"strongly agree\" and \"agree\" responses). Presentation of relevant literature was done during a virtual discussion, and some statements (the ones that did not achieve predefined agreement) were actively discussed and deliberately debated to arrive at conclusive statements. Those statements that did not reach consensus were revised and recirculated during round two. RESULTS: Consensus was achieved for 130/130 statements covering various domains such as assessment of dehydration, dehydration in geriatrics, energy requirement, impact of oral FEE on patient outcome, and fluid recommendations in acute and chronic nondiarrheal illness. However, one statement was not added as a recommendation in the final consensus (129/130) as further literature review did not find any supporting data. Oral FEE should be recommended as part of core treatment from day 1 of acute nondiarrheal illness and started at the earliest feasibility in chronic illnesses for improved patient outcomes. Appropriately formulated fluids with known electrolyte and energy content, quality standards, and improved palatability may further impact patient compliance and could be a good option. CONCLUSION: These consensus recommendations provide guidance for oral FEE recommendations in Indian adult/geriatric patients with various nondiarrheal illnesses.",

The impact of oral FEE supplementation adjuvant to standard of care (SOC) treatment on recovery in patients with acute nondiarrheal diseases is yet to be evaluated. AIM: To determine the effectiveness of ORSL® variants (ORSL® Apple Drink and ORSL® PLUS Orange Drink), fruit juice-based electrolyte drinks as an adjuvant along with SOC in the restoration of oral FEE in patients with acute nondiarrheal disease with fever and/or general weakness who attended an outpatient department (OPD). MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a prospective, interventional, open-label, multicenter, real-world, study conducted at eight sites across India. Patients with fever and/or general weakness due to an acute nondiarrheal illness were given either ORSL® Apple Drink or ORSL® PLUS Orange Drink as an adjuvant along with SOC treatment per physician's discretion. The primary endpoint of the study was to assess improvement from baseline in energy or hydration levels after ORSL® variants consumption at 6, 24, and 48 hours measured by a new aided recovery scale (ARS). Secondary endpoints were to assess the improvement in energy and hydration levels at 20, 40, and 60 minutes, as well as energy levels and hydration levels at 20, 40, and 60 minutes, 6, 24, and 48 hours after the consumption of ORSL® Apple Drink or ORSL® PLUS Orange Drink. The patient's consumption of ORSL® variants and treatment experience, physician's experience of recommending ORSL® variants, and product safety were evaluated. RESULTS: In total, 612 patients were enrolled with mean age 38.3 years, of whom 62.9% were male. The mean baseline level of energy and hydration was 1.59 (range 1.0-2.0) on ARS. Statistically significant (p < 0.0001) improvements were observed in energy or hydration 6 hours after first consumption of ORSL formulations. Furthermore, improvement was observed from 40 minutes, and in levels of energy, hydration, and both energy and hydration from 60 minutes. Patients and physicians reported a positive experience with ORSL® variants. CONCLUSION: ORSL® Apple Drink and ORSL® PLUS Orange Drink are clinically proven to provide hydration and/or energy to patients with fever and/or general weakness.",

Cardiovascular disease remains the leading cause of mortality in this population, exacerbated by the cardiovascular stress imposed by the HD procedure. The first year after transitioning to hemodialysis is associated with increased risks of hospitalization and mortality, particularly within the first 90-120 days, with greater vulnerability observed among the elderly. Based on data from clinics in Fresenius Medical Care Europe, Middle East, and Africa NephroCare, this review aims to optimize hemodialysis procedures to reduce mortality risk in stable incident and prevalent patients. It addresses critical aspects such as treatment duration, frequency, choice of dialysis membrane, dialysate composition, blood and dialysate flow rates, electrolyte composition, temperature control, target weight management, dialysis adequacy, and additional protocols, with a focus on mitigating prevalent intradialytic complications, particularly intradialytic hypotension prevention."

      "abstract": "Background: The management of non-diarrheal illnesses requires careful attention to maintaining the proper balance of fluids, electrolytes, and energy (FEE). Nevertheless, there is a limited amount of information accessible regarding the utilization of oral FEE formulations in the treatment of these conditions. Objective: The objective of this study was to assess and contrast the levels of knowledge, attitude, and practices (KAP) among various medical specialties in India when it comes to addressing FEE imbalances in non-diarrheal illnesses through the use of oral FEE formulations, as well as to examine how these approaches influence perceived patient outcomes. We also present a subgroup analysis of KAP in healthcare personnels (HCPs) whose practices include 25% or more diabetic or geriatric patients. Materials and methods: A cross-sectional online assessment was created and conducted among physicians (n = 494) representing different medical specialties in India, which include general practitioners (GPs) (n = 128), MD physicians (n = 121), gynecologists (n = 122), and pediatricians (n = 123). Results: A total of 494 physicians across specialties, including GPs, MDs (MD internal medicine physicians), obstetrics and gynecologists (OB-GYN), and pediatricians, participated in the online assessment from September to October 2021. Knowledge scores were moderate across specialties, and there was no significant difference in knowledge level across specialties. More pediatricians and GPs than other HCPs consider FEE deficit to have a high impact on recovery. Further, pediatrician prescribers consider FEE management to be of high importance compared to other specialties. A significantly higher percentage of pediatricians assess all their patients (100%) for hydration levels, and significantly more gynecologists spend >5 minutes providing hydration advice to their patients. Among all specialties, MD and gynecologist prescribers are more likely to recommend oral FEE for patient recovery. HCPs with diabetes practices agree slightly more than HCPs with geriatric practices that oral FEE management recommendations facilitate the speed of the recovery process from non-diarrheal illnesses in their patients. However, only approximately 30% of them recommend FEE to 70% of their eligible patients, of which approximately 70% of these HCPs give formal (written/electronic) prescriptions of ready-to-drink (RTD) fluids to their patients. Conclusion: Enhancing the understanding of physicians across diverse specialties in India regarding oral FEE management and formulating recommendations for the utilization of oral FEE formulations in non-diarrheal conditions could lead to better outcomes. While knowledge and awareness of oral FEE management are similar across specialties, their practice behaviors vary. Additional research into this disparity and the assessment of the clinical advantages of oral FEE formulations in non-diarrheal illnesses among various specialties should be conducted.

      "abstract": "The resource recovery and reuse of precious metal-laden wastewater is widely recognized as crucial for sustainable development. Superalloy electrolytes, produced through the electrolysis of superalloy scrap, contain significant quantities of precious metal ions, thereby possessing substantial potential for recovery value. This study first explores the feasibility of utilizing fungi to treat Superalloy electrolytes. Five fungi resistant to high concentrations of heavy metals in electrolytes (mainly containing Co, Cr, Mo, Re, and Ni) were screened from the soil of a mining area to evaluate their adsorption characteristics. All five fungi were identified by ITS sequencing, and among them, Paecilomyces lilacinus showed the best adsorption performance for the five heavy metals; therefore, we conducted further research on its adsorption characteristics. The best adsorption effect of Co, Cr, Mo, Re, and Ni was 37.09, 64.41, 47.87, 41.59, and 25.38%, respectively, under the conditions of pH 5, time 1 h, dosage 26.67 g/L, temperature 25-30°C, and an initial metal concentration that was diluted fivefold in the electrolyte. The biosorption of Co, Mo, Re, and Ni was better matched by the Langmuir model than by the Freundlich model, while Cr displayed the opposite pattern, showing that the adsorption process of P. lilacinus for the five heavy metals is not a single adsorption mechanism, but may involve a multi-step adsorption process. The kinetics study showed that the quasi-second-order model fitted better than the quasi-first-order model, indicating that chemical adsorption was the main adsorption process of the five heavy metals in P. lilacinus. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy revealed that the relevant active groups, i.e., hydroxyl (-OH), amino (-NH2), amide (- CONH2), carbonyl (-C = O), carboxyl (-COOH), and phosphate (PO43-), participated in the adsorption process. This study emphasized the potential application of P. lilacinus in the treatment of industrial wastewater with extremely complex background values."

      "abstract": "HYPOTHESIS: Imogolite nanotubes (INTs) are unique anisometric particles with monodisperse nanometric diameters. Aluminogermanate double-walled INTs (Ge-DWINTs) are obtained with variable aspect ratios by controlling the synthesis conditions. It thus appears as an interesting model system to investigate how aspect ratio and ionic valence influence the colloidal behavior of highly anisometric rods. EXPERIMENTS: The nanotubes were synthesized by hydrothermal treatment for 5 or 20 days to modify the aspect ratio while the electrostatic interactions were investigated by comparing the colloidal stability in symmetric and asymmetric electrolytes. The phase behavior and their related microstructure were determined by optical observations and small-angle X-ray scattering measurements, coupled with interparticle distance modelling. FINDINGS: We revealed that colloidal suspensions of Ge-DWINTs prepared in NaCl are guided by repulsive double layer forces, undergoing different liquid crystal phase transitions before stiffen into a glass-like state. We found that the microstructure can be rationalized by taking into account the anisometric nature of the particles. By contrast, dispersions prepared with asymmetric electrolytes are governed by strong attractive forces and thus form space-filling gels containing large nanotubes aggregates."

In this regard, we here present the successful melt-casting synthesis of a MgO-added NASICON-type LAGP glass-ceramic electrolyte with composition Li1.5Al0.3Mg0.1Ge1.6(PO4)3, namely LAMGP. The effects of three different additional oxides are investigated, with the aim to improve grain cohesion and consequently enhance Li-ion conductivity. Specifically, yttrium oxide (Y2O3, 5 mol%), boron oxide (B2O3, 0.7 mol%) and silicon oxide (SiO2, 2.4 %mol) are added, yielding LAMGP-Y, LAMGP-B and LAMGP-Si, respectively. Their effects are exhaustively compared in terms of thermal, crystalline, structural/morphological and ion conducting features. Among the three oxides, B2O3 is able to positively act on grain boundaries without bringing along grains deformation and insulating secondary phases formation, achieving enhanced ionic conductivity of 0.21 mS cm-1 at 20 °C as compared to 0.08 mS cm-1 for a commercial LAGP subjected to the same thermal treatment. A remarkable anodic oxidation stability up to 4.8 V vs Li+/Li is assessed by LAMGP-B system, which accounts for promising prospects for its use in combination with high-energy (high-V) cathodes."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Inflammatory bowel disease involves chronic inflammation and ulceration, primarily Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. The prevalence of inflammatory bowel disease is rising in industrialized countries. We describe the case of a patient with inflammatory bowel disease and multiple electrolyte disturbances that emphasize the link between a vitamin D deficiency and electrolyte imbalances. CASE: An 86-year-old Japanese man with severe hypocalcemia, hypophosphatemia, hypokalemia, and hypomagnesemia was referred to the gastroenterology and hepatology department our university hospital for severe diarrhea and abdominal pain. Based on clinical symptoms and biochemical and endoscopic findings, Crohn's disease, intestinal Behçet's disease, and intestinal tuberculosis were considered as differential diagnoses, but a final diagnosis was not reached. Prednisolone, azathioprine, and metronidazole were administered, and no apparent electrolyte abnormality was observed at the patient's admission to our hospital. On the 80th hospital day, marked hypocalcemia, hypophosphatemia, hypokalemia, and hypomagnesemia were noted and prolonged, despite daily supplementation with Ca and inorganic P. At his consultation with our department, we observed decreased fractional excretion of Ca, tubular reabsorption of phosphate, fractional excretion of K, and fractional excretion of Mg, suggesting the depletion of vitamin D and extrarenal wasting of K and Mg. The patient's serum Ca and inorganic P were quickly elevated in response to treatment with an active form of vitamin D, and his serum levels of K and Mg were restored to the normal range by an intravenous administration of K and Mg. A vitamin D deficiency is not rare in inflammatory bowel disease and is caused primarily by the decreased intestinal absorption of vitamin D. In the management of electrolyte imbalances in patients with inflammatory bowel disease, clinicians must consider the possible development of vitamin D deficiency-related disorders. CONCLUSION: Vitamin D deficiency in entero-Behçet's disease leads to severe hypocalcemia and hypophosphatemia, highlighting the importance of awareness in management.",

A personalized approach to hemodialysis prescription could reduce some of these burdens by preventing complications such as excessive changes in blood pressure, arrhythmias, post-dialysis fatigue and decreased quality of life. A patient-centered approach to dialysate electrolyte concentrations represents one such opportunity. In addition to modifications in dialysate electrolyte concentrations, consideration of individual factors such as patients' serum concentrations, medication profiles, nutritional status and comorbidities is critical to tailoring hemodialysis prescriptions to optimize patient outcomes. The development of personalized dialysis treatment depends on the collection of comprehensive patient data, advances in technology, resource allocation and patient involvement in decision-making. This review discusses how the treatment of maintenance hemodialysis patients could benefit from individualized changes in certain dialysis fluid components."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Preventing acid-base and electrolyte disturbance is crucial in coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery, since any of these conditions can affect outcome. The type of crystalloid solution used during and after the surgery can affect these disturbances. METHODS: In this study, 90 patients who candidates for CABG surgery were randomly allocated to either ringer's lactate (RL) or ringer's group. In order to provide essential blood volume before and after the start of CPB fluid administration with either ringer's or RL solution was started during operation and continued for 18 hours after the patient was transferred to ICU. ABG, serum electrolytes and Lactate level were measured before and at the end of CPB, upon arrival to the ICU, and 6, 12 and 18 hours after ICU admission and compared between the two groups. RESULTS: Blood PH level was significantly different between the two groups upon arrival to ICU, 6 and 18 hours after ICU admission (P<0.05) which was clinically closer to the normal range in the RL group. Serum bicarbonate level showed a significantly difference between the two groups (P<0.05). There were no significantly differences between the two groups in terms of lactate level, serum electrolytes, blood loss, intake and output of fluids and blood products transfusion. CONCLUSION: In this study, ringer's lactate solution creates a more favorable acid-base balance without a significant increase in blood lactate level which is attributed to the buffering effect of existing lactate, and can be used as an appropriate alternative to ringer's solution during and after CABG."

      "abstract": "Sulfide solid electrolytes (SSEs) are highly wanted for solid-state batteries (SSBs). While their liquid-phase synthesis is advantageous over their solid-phase strategy in scalable production, it confronts other challenges, such as low-purity products, user-unfriendly solvents, energy-inefficient solvent removal, and unsatisfactory performance. This article demonstrates that a suspension-based solvothermal method using single oxygen-free solvents can solve those problems. Experimental observations and theoretical calculations together show that the basic function of suspension-treatment is \"interparticle-coupled unification\", that is, even individually insoluble solid precursors can mutually adsorb and amalgamate to generate uniform composites in nonpolar solvents. This anti-intuitive concept is established when investigating the origins of impurities in SSEs electrolytes made by the conventional tetrahydrofuran-ethanol method and then searching for new solvents. Its generality is supported by four eligible alkane solvents and four types of SSEs. The electrochemical assessments on the former three SSEs show that they are competitive with their counterparts in the literature. Moreover, the synthesized SSEs presents excellent battery performance, showing great potential for practical applications."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The current clinical trial was conducted on 105 children aged 6 months to 4 years that were candidates for surgery. These patients were randomly divided into three groups undergoing intraoperative fluid therapy with 1/5-4/5 serum, Ringer's, and 1/3-2/3 serum. The values of hemodynamic parameters, BS, serum electrolytes (sodium, potassium, and chloride), and blood gases (pH, HCO3, and BE) were evaluated and compared among the three groups. RESULTS: The level of BS at the end of the surgery in Ringer's group with mean 166.20 ± 39.46 mg/dl was significantly lower than its level in the other two groups (1/5-4/5 serum: 241.00 ± 51.11 and 1/3-2/3 serum: 189.20 ± 34.23; P value < 0.05). Moreover, pH, HCO3, and BE at the end of the surgery had significant differences between the three groups (P value < 0.05). The amount of urine output at all follow-up times revealed a significant difference between Ringer's group and the other two groups (P value < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Use of Ringer's serum during anesthesia in children, in addition to maintaining BS and electrolytes within the normal range, has resulted in greater stability of hemodynamic responses and maintenance of the body's acid-base balance."

These treatments are often prescribed for short or limited periods, with progressive treatment withdrawal often resulting in relapses. However, there are a few studies into the long-term use (≥6 months) of PEG 3350 with electrolytes (PEG+E) in terms of the patients' clinical evolution. OBJECTIVES: To assess bowel movement and other relevant symptoms in children with constipation receiving PEG+E (≥6 months), as well as parent/caregiver satisfaction with this treatment. METHODS: A retrospective, observational, descriptive, longitudinal, and multicentre study was carried out on 74 children diagnosed with functional constipation (ROME IV criteria) who had received PEG+E (≥6 months). Bowel control was assessed using the Bristol stool scale, and the parent's/caregiver's perception of the treatment was also evaluated employing a nonvalidated questionnaire. RESULTS: Children with an average duration of constipation >1 year experienced a significant improvement in bowel movements and stool consistency when using PEG+E. The mean duration of use was 18.6 (±13.4) months, without the need to adjust the dose for weight. All clinical symptoms improved significantly except bloating, and all the parents/caregivers confirmed these clinical improvements. CONCLUSIONS: Children treated with PEG+E (≥6 months) normalised their bowel movements, improving the clinical symptoms related to constipation in the absence of serious advert events or the need for dosage adjustments due to weight gain. Parents/caregivers reported good satisfaction with PEG+E treatment."

The aim of this study was to evaluate the gender-specific differences and the effect of combined estrogen-progestin oral contraceptives (COCs) on FR, pH, and electrolyte concentrations in the parotid saliva (PS) of a group of healthy adults. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Stimulated PS was collected from 20 healthy adults using a Lashley cup; 11 males, 8 females, and 1 female undertaking combined contraceptive therapy (levonorgestrel/ethinyloestradiol 0.1 mg + 0.02 mg). FR and pH were recorded for each saliva sample. Electrolytes concentrations (Na+ , Ca2+ , K+ , Mg2+ ) were measured using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer (ICP-OES). Statistical analysis was performed, and the significance level was set at p < .05. RESULTS: PS FR varied from 0.13 to 0.42 mL/min in females not taking any medication and from 0.08 to 0.5 mL/min in males not taking any medication. PS pH of females and males not taking any medication ranged from 6.23 to 7.50 and from 6.15 to 7.55. PS pH and FR of the female taking COCs were 6.5 and 0.1 mL/min. PS pH, FR, and electrolytes concentrations (Ca2+ , Na+ , K+ , Mg2+ ) were not statistically significantly different between females and males not taking any medication. PS concentrations of Ca2+  and Na+ were significantly higher in the females taking COCs than in the females not taking any medication. Whereas, concentrations of K+ and Mg2+ did not differ significantly between the females taking COCs and the females not taking any medication. CONCLUSIONS: There are no significant gender-specific differences in PS flow rate, pH, and electrolyte concentrations of Na+ , Ca2+ , Mg2+ , and K+ . Combined hormonal oral contraceptive has a significant effect on PS flow rate, pH, Ca2+ , and Na+ concentrations. Whereas the PS concentration of K+ and Mg2+ are not influenced by COCs.

Therefore, the objective of these three studies was to evaluate a water supplement (HV; HydraVantage, Kent Nutrition Group, Muscatine, IA) which is a proprietary blend of a humic substance, butyric acid, and vitamins C, D, and E, as well as an electrolyte blend on nursery pig performance and mortality. Experiment 1 consisted of 196 crossbred weanling pigs (7 pigs per pen with 14 pens per treatment) which were randomly allotted by BW to two treatments consisting of control (water for 33 d) or HV at 15 g/L of stock solution and proportioned through a medicator (1:128) for 11 d followed by water for 22 d. There were no performance differences. However, mortality was reduced (P < 0.01) from 6.12% for the control to 0.00% for HV. In experiment 2, there were 488 weanling pigs (6 to 10 pigs/pen with 14 pens per treatment) which were randomly allotted by BW to four treatments in a 34-d trial. Treatment 1 was control (water), and treatments 2 and 4 were HV at 15 g/L of stock solution for 11 and 34 d, respectively. Treatment 3 utilized HV at 15 g/L stock solution during days 0 to 11 with 7.5 g HV/L stock solution utilized during days 11 to 21 followed by water. No performance differences were observed among the four treatments. Mortality was 10.89%, 4.82%, 5.54%, and 7.26% for treatments 1 to 4, respectively, with treatment 1 having a higher mortality (P < 0.05) compared to treatments 2 to 4. In experiment 3, a 2 × 2 factorial study was conducted (7 pigs per pen with 14 pens per treatment) in which the treatments were: 1) water; 2) HV at 15 g/L stock solution for 34 d; 3) electrolytes at 241 g/L stock solution for 34 d; and 4) HV at 15 g/L of stock solution and electrolytes at 226 g/L of stock for 34 d. Overall pen gain tended to be improved (P = 0.09) with supplemental HV. Moreover, mortality was reduced (P = 0.06) by 36% (16.86% mortality for treatments 1 and 3 vs. 10.73% mortality for treatments 2 and 4). Supplemental electrolytes had no effect on mortality. These data suggest that HV has a positive effect by reducing mortality in nursery pigs undergoing health challenges."

      "abstract": "Rechargeable magnesium batteries are considered with great potential as sustainable, economic-friendly, safe energy storage techniques. Whereas, the Mg metal anode exhibits limited plating/stripping behavior in the conventional electrolytes due to the severe passivation. Herein, a facile LiI solution treatment is reported to reconstruct the interphase between Mg metal anode and electrolytes, converting the original passivation film to I-riched solid electrolyte interphase with the ability of rapid Mg2+ migration, which can reduce the overpotential for Mg anode plating/stripping from 2 to 0.4 V at 0.1 mA cm-2. In addition, Li+ from the LiI precursor can be released and shuttles to the Mo6S8 cathode side, promoting cointercalation of Mg2+. With the simultaneous improvement of the anode and cathode, the Mg//Mo6S8 full cell delivers a decreasing voltage hysteresis (0.1 V) and much enhanced specific capacity (80.8 mAh g-1). This work provides a maneuverable anode treatment for constructing a passivation-against interphase between Mg metal anode and the conventional electrolytes, contributing an insight for the development toward high-performance Mg batteries."

      "abstract": "Describing analytically the transport properties of electrolytes, such as their conductivity or the self-diffusion of the ions, has been a central challenge of chemical physics for almost a century. In recent years, this question has regained some interest in light of Stochastic Density Field Theory (SDFT) - an analytical framework that allows the approximate determination of density correlations in fluctuating systems. In spite of the success of this theory to describe dilute electrolytes, its extension to concentrated solutions raises a number of technical difficulties, and requires simplified descriptions of the short-range repulsion between the ions. In this article, we discuss recent approximations that were proposed to compute the conductivity of electrolytes, in particular truncations of Coulomb interactions at short distances. We extend them to another observable (the self-diffusion coefficient of the ions) and compare them to earlier analytical approaches, such as the mean spherical approximation and mode-coupling theory. We show how the treatment of hydrodynamic effects in SDFT can be improved, that the choice of the modified Coulomb interactions significantly affects the determination of the properties of the electrolytes, and that comparison with other theories provides a guide to extend SDFT approaches in this context."

In this study, we investigated the physicochemical properties of the tetradecyltrimethylammonium bromide (TTAB) and pepsin protein mixture in various sodium salt media within a temperature range of 300.55-320.55 K with 5 K intervals. The conductometric study of the TTAB+pepsin mixture revealed a reduction in the critical micelle concentration (CMC) in electrolyte media. The micellization of TTAB was delayed in the presence of pepsin. The CMC of the TTAB + pepsin mixture was found to depend on the concentrations of electrolytes and protein, as well as the temperature variations. The aggregation of the TTAB+pepsin mixture was hindered as a function of [pepsin] and increasing temperatures, while micellization was promoted in aqueous electrolyte solutions. The negative free energy changes (∆Gm0) indicated the spontaneous aggregation of the TTAB+pepsin mixture. Changes in enthalpy, entropy, molar heat capacities, transfer properties, and enthalpy-entropy compensation variables were calculated and illustrated rationally. The interaction forces between TTAB and pepsin protein in the experimental solvents were primarily hydrophobic and electrostatic (ion-dipole) in nature. An analysis of molecular docking revealed hydrophobic interactions as the main stabilizing forces in the TTAB-pepsin complex.",

      "abstract": "The diffusivity of water in aqueous cesium iodide solutions is larger than that in neat liquid water and vice versa for sodium chloride solutions. Such peculiar ion-specific behavior, called anomalous diffusion, is not reproduced in typical force field based molecular dynamics (MD) simulations due to inadequate treatment of ion-water interactions. Herein, this hurdle is tackled by using machine learned atomic potentials (MLPs) trained on data from density functional theory calculations. MLP based atomistic MD simulations of aqueous salt solutions reproduce experimentally determined thermodynamic, structural, dynamical, and transport properties, including their varied trends in water diffusivities across salt concentration. This enables an examination of their intermolecular structure to unravel the microscopic underpinnings of the differences in their transport properties. While both ions in CsI solutions contribute to the faster diffusion of water molecules, the competition between the heavy retardation by Na ions and the slight acceleration by Cl ions in NaCl solutions reduces their water diffusivity."

      "abstract": "The transition from fossil fuels to cleaner energies employing different renewable sources constitutes one of the primary worldwide challenges. The search for appropriate solutions is becoming more urgent in view of the severe consequences of climate change. As for a perspective, stationary energy storage, alkali-ion batteries and hybrid supercapacitors are, among others, considered as efficient and affordable solutions. Alkali-ion batteries have proved to be the most investigated products in the past decade including optimizations for cost, energy density and safety. In this Perspective, a computational approach and its applicability in the inverse material design are presented. This approach includes density functional theory calculations, force field-based determinations and both static and molecular dynamics simulations. As for an illustration, the main properties of a selected series of battery materials, including oxides and sulfides Li2SiO3, Li2SnO3, SrSnO3, and A2B6X13 (A = Li+, Na+, K+; B = Ti4+, Sn4+; X = O2-, S2-), and mixed halide antiperovskite A3OX (A = Li+, Na+; X = Cl-, Br-) are explored in depth using these theoretical approaches. Doping strategies, new dopant incorporation mechanism, treatment with alkali insertion/de-insertion cycle in electrodes, transport properties, as well as thermodynamic stability, are discussed. Theoretical approaches reveal that the oxygen-sulfur exchange in alkali hexatitanates and hexastannates induces remarkable improvement of the required properties for electrode and electrolyte materials. In addition, doping of Li2SiO3 with low Na-concentration enhances the room temperature Li-diffusivity by a reduction of the activation energy. The effects of transition-metal and divalent dopants on the defect chemistry and transport properties of Li2SnO3 are also disclosed. The interstitial trivalent doping mechanism is a friendly synthesis strategy to improve the large-scale diffusion in Li2SnO3. The potential of SrSnO3 as an anode in alkali-ion batteries, and the influence of a particular grain boundary in nanocrystalline antiperovskite A3OX are also revealed by using advanced atomistic simulations. The computational approaches described here provide us with a convenient tool for the determination of the properties of battery materials with high accuracy and for the prediction of characteristics of a new generation of alkali battery materials that could be used in improved technologies."

      "abstract": "Although banned in some countries, p-arsanilic acid (ASA) is still widely used as feed additive in poultry production. As a result, ASA is usually released into the aquatic environment without any treatments. Although ASA exhibits low toxicity, it can be transformed into highly toxic aromatic amines and inorganic arsenic species (As (V) as H2AsO4- and HAsO42-) under natural environmental conditions. Hence, it is necessary to develop efficient technologies for its removal or degradation. In this contribution, electrochemical advanced oxidation technology with boron-doped diamond (BDD) had been initially used to degrade ASA pollutants. A five-level central composite rotatable design (CCRD) was implemented to optimize the various influencing factors involved, among applied current density, NaCl concentration, Na2SO4 concentration and NaHCO3 concentration on the oxidation efficiency; the latter was assessed in terms of ASA degradation percentage. The results obtained highlighted the unique and important roles of electrolytes during the electrolytic oxidations. Meanwhile, the major degradation byproducts detected were also strongly dependent on the electrolyte adopted. In particular, several oligomer byproducts with novel structures were initially identified in BDD-treated ASA solutions. Two different electrochemical transformation pathways of ASA on BDD anode were thus proposed. This study demonstrated the effectiveness of BDD technology in the degradation of ASA, as well as the potential minor risk of its application in actual ASA wastewater treatment."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Epilepsy is a serious chronic neurological disorder, which is accompanied by recurrent seizures. Repeated seizures cause physical injuries and neuronal dysfunction and may be a risk of cancer and vascular diseases. However, many antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) have side effects of mood alteration or neurocognitive function, a reduction in neuron excitation, and the inhibition of normal activity. Therefore, the present study aimed to evaluate the effect of secondary metabolites of Trichoderma harzianum cultural filtrate (ThCF) when adjusting different electrolytes and neurotransmitters in the hippocampus of epileptic rats. METHODS: Cytotoxicity of ThCF against LS-174T cancer cells was assessed using a sulforhodamine B (SRB) assay. Quantitative estimation for some neurotransmitters, electrolytes in sera or homogenate of hippocampi tissues, and mRNA gene expression for ion or voltage gates was assessed by quantitative Real-Time PCR. RESULTS: Treatment with ThCF reduces the proliferative percentage of LS-174T cells in a concentration-dependent manner. ThCF administration improves hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, and hypocalcemia in the sera of the epilepticus model. ThCF rebalances the elevated levels of many neurotransmitters and reduces the release of GABA and acetylcholine-esterase. Also, treatments with ThCF ameliorate the downregulation of mRNA gene expression for some gate receptors in hippocampal homogenate tissues and recorded a highly significant elevation in the expression of SCN1A, CACNA1S, and NMDA. CONCLUSION: Secondary metabolites of Trichoderma (ThCF) have cytotoxic activity against LS-174T (colorectal cancer cell line) and anxiolytic-like activity through a GABAergic mechanism of action and an increase in GABA as inhibitory amino acid in the selected brain regions and reduced levels of NMDA and DOPA. The present data suggested that ThCF may inhibit intracellular calcium accumulation by triggering the NAADP-mediated Ca2+ signaling pathway. Therefore, the present results suggested further studies on the molecular pathway for each metabolite of ThCF, e.g., 6-pentyl-α-pyrone (6-PP), harzianic acid (HA), and hydrophobin, as an alternative drug to mitigate the side effects of AEDs."

      "abstract": "Garnet-type Li6.4La3Zr1.4Ta0.6O12 (LLZTO) is a highly promising solid-state lithium metal battery electrolyte due to its exceptional ionic conductivity and electrochemical stability. However, when exposed to air, a passivation layer can be spontaneously formed on the garnet-type electrolyte, deteriorating its wettability with metallic lithium (Li) and impeding the lithium ion transfer at the Li-garnet electrolyte interface. The passivation layer is considered a critical issue for garnet-type solid electrolytes. Despite intensive research, the formation mechanism of the passivation film remains poorly understood. The key to elucidating the formation mechanism is to obtain a pristine garnet electrolyte surface and study how the pristine garnet electrolyte interacts with air. In this study, different passivation layer removal pretreatments were performed to expose pristine garnet electrolytes, and their impacts on the samples were systematically studied. The results reveal the overlooked negative impacts of vacuum annealing and acid treatment on LLZTO, which are indicated by the severe loss of Li and O and the formation of additional Li-depleted metal oxides. It was confirmed that argon annealing is the only viable approach to remove the passivation layer without introducing concomitant contaminations to LLZTO. Based on this method, we directly evidenced the formation of LiOH on LLZTO under rarefied air using quasi-in situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. It was confirmed that the loss of Li and O ions, rather than Li+/H+ exchange, drives the formation of LiOH in the passivation layer. These results not only provide a better understanding of the surface and interface chemistry of LLZTO but also reveal a reliable surface treatment for the LLZTO sample."

      "abstract": "Climate change and the demand for clean energy have challenged scientists worldwide to produce/store more energy to reduce carbon emissions. This work proposes a conductive gel biopolymer electrolyte to support the sustainable development of high-power aqueous supercapacitors. The gel uses saline water and seaweed as sustainable resources. Herein, a biopolymer agar-agar, extracted from red algae, is modified to increase gel viscosity up to 17-fold. This occurs due to alkaline treatment and an increase in the concentration of the agar-agar biopolymer, resulting in a strengthened gel with cohesive superfibres. The thermal degradation and agar modification mechanisms are explored. The electrolyte is applied to manufacture sustainable and flexible supercapacitors with satisfactory energy density (0.764 Wh kg-1 ) and power density (230 W kg-1 ). As an electrolyte, the aqueous gel promotes a long device cycle life (3500 cycles) for 1 A g-1 , showing good transport properties and low cost of acquisition and enabling the supercapacitor to be manufactured outside a glove box. These features decrease the cost of production and favor scale-up. To this end, this work provides eco-friendly electrolytes for the next generation of flexible energy storage devices."

However, it can also occur in other positions and can be relieved by lying down while likely to have another attack after relief. In the current study, we aim to evaluate the predictive effect of catecholamines and electrolytes on the recurrence of OI in children. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Children who were diagnosed with vasovagal syncope (VVS), postural tachycardia syndrome (POTS), and VVS combined with POTS were enrolled in this retrospective study and were followed up after 1-year physical treatment. Catecholamines in urine collected within 24 h, renin, angiotensin II, aldosterone in plasma, and electrolytes in both blood and urine collected in the morning were tested. A multivariate analysis and a receiver operating characteristic curve were used to validate the prediction effect. RESULTS: In the VVS cohort, the 24 h urine adrenaline (AD) and norepinephrine (NE) levels of the non-recurrence group were lower than the 24 h urine AD and NE levels of the recurrence group, with a significant difference of P < 0.05. A different content can also be witnessed in the POTS cohort that the urine of the non-recurrence group contained lower sodium and chlorine. As for the VVS + POTS cohort, the non-recurrence group has lower AD and NE levels and higher potassium and phosphorus levels in urine, the difference of which proved prominent as well. CONCLUSION: The study provides further evidence that AD, NE, and electrolytes in urine are promising factors that are closely related to the recurrence of OI in children. The integrated evaluation system merging AD and NE may have better predictive ability."

In this study, we introduced high-boiling solvents of dimethylformamide (DMF, b.p.: 153 °C) and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, b.p.: 189 °C) as transient solvents to develop composite electrolytes of Li1.5Al0.5Ge1.5(PO4)3 (LAGP) with bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide lithium salt (LiTFSI). Our results show that composite electrolytes processed with the DMF/water mixture (CSP LAGP-LiTFSI DMF/H2O) yield a high σ of 10-4 S cm-1 at room temperature and high relative densities of >87%. Furthermore, the composite electrolytes exhibit good thermal stability; the σ maintains its initial value after heat treatment. In contrast, the composite electrolytes processed with the DMSO/water mixture and water alone show thermal degradation. The CSP LAGP-LiTFSI DMF/H2O composite electrolytes exhibit long-term stability, showing no signs of short circuiting after 350 h at 0.1 mAh cm-2 in Li symmetric cells. Our work highlights the importance of selecting appropriate transient solvents for producing efficient and stable composite electrolytes using CSP."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: No studies have analysed the effectiveness of treatment for constipation in critically ill children. The aim of this study was to assess the implementation, efficacy and safety of a treatment protocol using polyethylene glycol 3350 with electrolytes (PEG 3350 + E) for constipation in critically ill children. METHODS: We conducted a single-centre prospective study in children admitted to the paediatric intensive care unit for a minimum of 72 h and who developed constipation. Children with previous gastrointestinal disorders or diseases were excluded. The patients were treated with rectal enemas or with the oral PEG 3350 + E protocol at the discretion of the treating physician. We compared clinical and demographic variables as well as adverse events (diarrhoea, abdominal distension and electrolyte imbalances). RESULTS: The sample included 56 patients with a mean age of 48.2 ± 11.9 months, of who 55.4% were male. Forty-four patients (78.6%) were treated with PEG 3350 + E and 12 (21.4%) with rectal enemas. The proportion of patients that responded well to treatment was greater in the PEG 3350 + E group (79.5%) compared to the enema group (58.3%), but the difference was not statistically significant (P = .151). There were no significant differences between the groups in any of the adverse effects. Treatment with PEG 3350 + E was more effective in children aged less than 2 years (100%) compared to older children (100% vs 65.4%; P < .01), with no significant differences in the development of adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: The PEG 3350 + E treatment protocol for constipation in critically ill children was effective and associated with few adverse events, even in children aged less than 2 years.",

It was determined that laser power and scanning speed greatly affect surface morphology, as well as the resulting chemical composition of Li7P3S11 samples. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy revealed that laser treatment can produce SSEs with higher ionic conductivities than pristine counterparts after air exposure. Further examination of chemical composition revealed an optimal laser processing condition that reduces the rate of P2S74- degradation. This work demonstrates the ability of laser-based processing to be used to improve the stability of SSEs."

      "abstract": "Assessing the risk of acute kidney injury (AKI) has been a challenging issue for clinicians in intensive care units (ICUs). In recent years, a number of studies have been conducted to investigate the associations between several serum electrolytes and AKI. Nevertheless, the compound effects of serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and clinically relevant serum electrolytes have yet to be comprehensively investigated. Accordingly, we initiated this study aiming to develop machine learning models that illustrate how these factors interact with each other. In particular, we focused on ICU patients without a prior history of AKI or AKI-related comorbidities. With this practice, we were able to examine the associations between the levels of serum electrolytes and renal function in a more controlled manner. Our analyses revealed that the levels of serum creatinine, chloride, and magnesium were the three major factors to be monitored for this group of patients. In summary, our results can provide valuable insights for developing early intervention and effective management strategies as well as crucial clues for future investigations of the pathophysiological mechanisms that are involved. In future studies, subgroup analyses based on different causes of AKI should be conducted to further enhance our understanding of AKI."

Ball milling mechanochemistry is a frequently employed synthetic approach to produce such Na+-conductive solid solutions; however, changes in the structure and morphology introduced in these systems via the mechanochemistry process are poorly understood. Herein, we combined X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, powder X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy characterization techniques to provide an in-depth analysis of these solid electrolytes. We report unique changes seen in the structure and morphology of Na3SbS4 and Na2.88Sb0.88W0.12S4 resulting from ball milling, inducing changes in the electrochemical performance of the solid-state batteries. Specifically, we observed a tetragonal-to-cubic crystal phase transition within Na3SbS4 following the ball mill, resulting in an increase in Na+ conductivity. In contrast, the Na+ conductivity was reduced in mechanochemically treated Na2.88Sb0.88W0.12S4 due to the formation and accumulation of a WS2 phase. In addition, mechanochemical treatment alters the surface morphology of densified Na2.88Sb0.88W0.12S4 pellets, providing intimate contact at the solid electrolyte/Na interface. This phenomenon was not observed in Na3SbS4. This work reveals the structural and morphological origin of the changes seen in these materials' electrochemical performance and how mechanochemical synthesis can introduce them."

Besides the preferential surface faceting, the Cu electrodes exhibit unique surface structures, including octahedral nanocrystals besides nanoporous and microporous structures, depending on the employed electrolyte. The incorporation of P-atoms into the Cu surfaces is observed. The modified Cu electrodes display increased roughness, leading to higher current densities for CO2 electroreduction reaction. The selectivity of the modified Cu electrodes towards C2 products is highest for the Cu electrodes treated in Na2 HPO3 and Na3 PO4 electrolytes, whereas those treated in Na2 H2 PO2 produce the most H2 . The Cu electrode treated in Na3 PO4 produces ethylene (23 %) at -1.1 V vs. RHE, and a comparable amount of acetaldehyde (15 %) that is typically observed for Cu(110) single crystals. The enhanced selectivity is attributed to several factors, including the surface morphology, the incorporation of phosphorus into the Cu structure, and the formation of Cu(110) facets. Our results not only advance our understanding of the influence of the electrolyte's nature on the plasma electrolysis of Cu electrodes, but also underscores the potential of in-liquid plasma treatment for developing efficient Cu electrocatalysts for sustainable CO2 conversion."

Angus crossbred steer-calves (N = 60; body weight [BW] = 234 ± 4 kg) were used in a randomized complete block design (block = BW) and stratified into two treatments: 1) control; and 2) 30 g/steer-daily (dry matter [DM] basis) of a nutritional packet containing (steer-daily basis): Live yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae; 1.7 × 1010 CFU), vitamin C (Ascorbic acid, 162 mg), vitamin B1 (thiamin hydrochloride, 400 mg), sodium chloride (2.4 g), and potassium chloride (2.4 g). Animals were offered (electronic feed-bunks [SmartFeed, C-Lock Inc., Rapid City, SD]), a steam-flaked corn-based finishing diet to ad libitum (individual intake), once daily for 233 d. Treatments were offered during the first and last 60 days on feed (DOF). The GLIMMIX procedure of SAS was used, with steer as the experimental unit, treatment and phase (for feeding behavior and digestibility) as fixed effects, and BW-block as a random effect. Steers offered the nutritional packet had 14% less (P < 0.01) intake and 18% greater (P = 0.01) feed efficiency during the initial 30 DOF. Intake (days 0 to 233) was 6% greater (P = 0.02) for steers offered the nutritional packet, while BW gain was not different (P ≥ 0.44). Greater (P = 0.02) dressing percent (61.1% vs. 62%) for steers offered the packet was observed, while other carcass variables were not different (P ≥ 0.33). Digestibility of DM, organic matter, and fiber were greater (P < 0.01) for steers offered the packet. Steers offered the packet spent 13% less time eating during the first 60 DOF, while during the last 60 DOF a 14% greater meal frequency and 12.3% smaller mean meal size (treatment × phase interaction, P < 0.02) were observed. Steers offered the packet had a reduced (P ≤ 0.01) mean meal duration during both phases. Regardless of treatment, a decreased rumination (P ≤ 0.03) and chewing (P ≤ 0.01) activities were observed for the last 60 DOF compared to the first 60 DOF. Ruminal papillae area was 30% greater (P = 0.02) and the total volatile fatty acid (VFA) tended (P = 0.09) to be greater for steers offered the nutritional packet. The nutritional packet offered to calf-fed steers improved feed efficiency during the initial 30 d after arrival, while inducing superior overall intake, nutrient digestibility, dressing percentage, ruminal papillae area, and total ruminal VFA."

In this study, we have investigated the ionic conductivity, mechanical behaviour, and microstructural and thermal properties of polyethylene oxide (PEO)-based polymer electrolytes with varying pre-strain levels. The results indicate that thermal stretching-induced pre-deformation can significantly increase the through-plane ionic conductivity, in-plane strength, stiffness of solid electrolytes, and cell-specific capacity. However, modulus and hardness decrease for pre-stretched films in the thickness direction. Notably, applying 50-80% pre-strain to the PEO matrix composites through thermal stretching may be preferred for improving the electrochemical cycling performance, as it can increase through-plane ionic conductivity by at least 1.6 times while maintaining compressive stiffness at 80% compared to their unstretched counterparts, while the in-plane strength and stiffness can be boosted by 120-140%. Besides, adding nanoceramics contributes to lithiated PEO exhibiting a higher enhancement coefficient than the pristine sample. This positive effect is because the pre-strain and nano-inorganic filler decrease crystallinity and increase the free volume size of pre-stretched PEO-based electrolytes."

Nevertheless, the latest RCTs are not proper for comparison since they were carried out at various times with dissimilar background therapies and the patients enrolled did not have the same characteristics. The difficulty of extrapolating from these trials and proposing a common framework appropriate for all cases is thus obvious. Despite the fact that these four agents are now the fundamental pillars of HFrEF treatment, the built-up algorithm of initiation and titration is a matter of debate. Electrolyte disturbances are common in HFrEF patients and can be attributed to several factors, such as the use of diuretics, renal impairment, and neurohormonal activation. We have identified several HFrEF phenotypes according to their sodium (Na+) and potassium (K+) status in a \"real world\" setting and suggest an algorithm on how to introduce the most appropriate drug and set up therapy based on the patients' electrolytes and the existence of congestion.",

      "abstract": "Coatings with a thickness from ~40 to ~50 µm on Ti6Al4V titanium alloys were formed by plasma electrolytic oxidation (PEO) in a silicate-hypophosphite electrolyte with the addition of graphene oxide. The PEO treatment was carried out in the anode-cathode mode (50 Hz) at a ratio of anode and cathode currents of 1:1; their sum density was 20 A/dm2, and the treatment's duration was 30 min. The effect of the graphene oxide's concentration in the electrolyte on the thickness, roughness, hardness, surface morphology, structure, composition, and tribological characteristics of the PEO coatings was studied. Wear experiments, under dry conditions, were carried out in a ball-on-disk tribotester with an applied load of 5 N, a sliding speed of 0.1 m·s-1, and a sliding distance of 1000 m. According to the obtained results, the addition of graphene oxide (GO) into the base silicate-hypophosphite electrolyte leads to a slight decrease in the coefficient of friction (from 0.73 to 0.69) and a reduction in the wear rate by more than 1.5 times (from 8.04 to 5.2 mm3/N·m), with an increase in the GO's concentration from 0 to 0.5 kg/m3, respectively. This occurs due to the formation of a GO-containing lubricating tribolayer upon contact with the coating of the counter-body in the friction pair. Delamination of the coatings during wear occurs due to contact fatigue; with an increase in the concentration of GO in the electrolyte from 0 to 0.5 kg/m3, this process slows down by more than four times."

ANIMALS: 29 dogs with naturally occurring glucocorticoid- and mineralocorticoid-deficient HA. PROCEDURES: Urine sodium and potassium concentrations, sodium-to-potassium ratios, sodium-to-creatinine ratios, and potassium-to-creatinine (K:Cr) ratios were evaluated in dogs with newly diagnosed HA that were treated with desoxycorticosterone pivalate (DOCP). Dogs underwent measurements of urine and serum sodium, potassium, and creatinine concentrations and plasma renin activities twice monthly for up to 3 months. Regression analyses and calculation of coefficients of determination (R2) were performed to investigate potential associations between urine and serum variables. Urine variables also were compared between dogs considered to be undertreated or overtreated based on plasma renin activities. RESULTS: Urine K:Cr ratios were significantly associated with serum potassium concentrations 10 to 14 days (P = .002) and 30 days (P = .027) after the initial DOCP injection, but R2 values were only 0.35 and 0.17, respectively. Urine K:Cr ratios (median [IQR]) also were higher in dogs that were overtreated with DOCP (1.3 [0.7 to 2.3]) as compared to those dogs that were undertreated with DOCP (0.8 [0.5 to 0.9]) at 10 to 14 days after the initial DOCP injection (P = .039) but not at 30 days after the initial injection. Other urine variables were not significantly different between undertreated and overtreated dogs.

The majority of people were between the ages of 61 and 70. The most frequent electrolyte abnormality found was hyponatremia. The mean serum sodium and calcium levels were lower in patients with AECOPD while the mean serum potassium levels were higher. A total of five deaths were recorded in patients with two or more electrolyte imbalances. The latter also had a requirement for home oxygen or non-invasive ventilation at the time of discharge.

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: Thyroid hormone withdrawal (THW) in preparation for radioactive iodine therapy (RIT) may lead to hyponatremia and hyperkalemia because hypothyroidism reduces the glomerular filtration rate. Using recombinant human thyrotropin (rhTSH) may avoid these changes; however, these two preparation methods have not been compared in the literature. The purpose of this study was to reveal whether THW and rhTSH as preparation methods for RIT affect serum electrolytes differently. We also evaluated clinical factors influencing the onset of hyponatremia and hyperkalemia during RIT. MATERIALS AND METHODS: From April 2005 to December 2020, we analyzed 278 patients with thyroid cancer who received RIT. The patients were classified into two groups based on the preparation method, and renal function and serum electrolytes were compared between the groups. We also evaluated clinical factors that may affect overt hyponatremia (serum sodium level < 134 mmol/L) and hyperkalemia (serum potassium level ≥ 5.0 mmol/L). RESULTS: Serum sodium and chloride levels in the THW group were significantly lower than those in the rhTSH group (p < 0.001 and p = 0.002, respectively). In contrast, the serum potassium level in the THW group was significantly higher than that in the rhTSH group (p = 0.008). As for clinical factors that may influence hyponatremia, age and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) were significantly associated with serum sodium level in the univariate analysis (p = 0.033 and p = 0.006, respectively). In the multivariate analysis, only age was significantly associated with serum sodium level (p = 0.030). Regarding hyperkalemia, distant metastases, the preparation method and eGFR were significantly associated with the serum potassium level in the univariate analysis (p = 0.005, p = 0.005 and p = 0.001, respectively). In the multivariate analysis, only eGFR was significantly associated with hyperkalemia (p = 0.019). CONCLUSION: THW and rhTSH affect serum sodium and potassium levels differently. Renal function may be risk factors for hyperkalemia, whereas older age may be a risk factor for hyponatremia.",

RESULTS: Levels of AM, sICAM-1, and Na+ decreased significantly at 24 h after MgSO4 treatment and 48 h after delivery among PE women compared to the AM levels before treatment (p < 0.0001). The levels of CGRP and Mg2+ increased significantly after 24 h of MgSO4 treatment and 48 h after delivery among PE compared to the AM levels before treatment (p < 0.0001). The changes in AM, sICAM-1, CGRP, and Mg2+ at 24 h after treatment and 48 h after delivery were significantly higher in severe compared to mild PE (p < 0.0001). AM levels reduced significantly by 14.7% in mild and 42.7% in severe PE after MgSO₄ treatment (p < 0.05). sICAM-1 levels reduced significantly by 20.9% in mild and 25% in severe PE after MgSO₄ treatment. After MgSO₄ treatment, there was significant increase of 42.1% and >100% in CGRP levels in mild and severe PE, respectively (p < 0.05). After MgSO₄ treatment, Mg²⁺ levels increased significantly by 67.0% and 63.8% in mild and severe PE, respectively (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: MgSO₄ treatment reduces AM, sICAM-1, and sodium levels but improves magnesium and CGRP in severe than mild PE thus have more beneficial role in severe PE."

      "abstract": "The all-solid-state lithium battery (ASSB) has received great attention due to its greater safety than the conventional lithium-ion battery (LIB). Sulfide-based inorganic solid electrolytes are an important component to fabricate the ASSB. But to attain a better performance, the ionic conductivity and electrochemical stability of the sulfide-based solid electrolytes need to be improved. In this work, we prepared the metal-oxide-doped/mixed Li7P2S8I0.75Br0.25 lithium superionic conductors by a dry ball-milling process. The high ionic conductivity was achieved by a low-temperature (200 °C) heat-treatment process. The metal-oxide-doped Li7P2S8I0.75Br0.25 solid electrolyte exhibited a higher ionic conductivity value of 7.3 mS cm-1 at room temperature than the bare Li7P2S8I0.75Br0.25 solid electrolyte. The structural characteristics of the prepared solid electrolytes were studied by solid NMR and laser Raman analysis. The electrochemical stability of the prepared solid electrolyte was studied by cyclic voltammetry and DC charge-discharge analysis. The addition of metal oxide increased the electrochemical stability and dry-air stability of the Li7P2S8I0.75Br0.25 solid electrolyte. The Ta2O5-doped Li7P2S8I0.75Br0.25 solid electrolyte was stable even after 300 charge-discharge DC cycles and also 100 h of dry-air exposure. Further, the Ta2O5-doped Li7P2S8I0.75Br0.25 solid electrolyte-based ASSB exhibited a high discharge capacity value of 184 mA h g-1 at 0.1 C rate with 66% initial cycle Coulombic efficiency."

This study intended to evaluate side effects of TK Imatinib or Nilotinib on liver enzymes and serum electrolytes in relation to hematologic and molecular response in HCV-, HBV-, and HIV-, CP-CML patients. The study was a quasi-experimental pre-post single group design, included 38 HCV-, HBV-, and HIV-newly diagnosed Philadelphia positive CP-CML patients with normal hepatic and renal function. They were divided equally into two groups, 19 received Nilotinib, and 19 received Imatinib. Hematologic, BCR-ABL gene expression by RT-PCR, electrolytes and liver enzymes were measured at baseline and after 6 months of treatment. Patients age ranged between 20 and 62 years. Anemic manifestations represented the highest rate (n=23, 60.5%). The mean WBCs count was significantly reduced after treatment (p < 0.001). The WBCs count was significantly reduced in the Nilotinib group than the Imatinib group (97% and 94%, respectively, p=0.049). The mean hemoglobin level was significantly increased after treatment (p=0.010). The mean platelet level did not change over the treatment period. The mean AST, ALT, and ALP levels were significantly increased after treatment, (p=0.014, p=0.002, and p=0.047, respectively). The ALP level was significantly increased in both groups (p=0.001). The mean sodium potassium, phosphorous, and calcium level was not changed over the treatment period. The mean BCR-ABL gene expression was sharply decreased after treatment (p < 0.001). A higher reduction was observed in the Nilotinib group (99%) than the Imatinib group (91.5%) (p=0.025). Imatinib resulted in rise of AST and ALP levels than Nilotinib, while both had the same effect on the ALT level. Higher reduction in BCR-ABL gene expression was achieved by Nilotinib. Nilotinib and Imatinib did not affect serum levels of sodium, potassium, phosphorous, or calcium.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Opioid-induced constipation (OIC) is a common symptom in cancer patients treated with opioids with a prevalence of up to 59%. International guidelines recommend standard laxatives such as macrogol/electrolytes and magnesium hydroxide to prevent OIC, although evidence from randomized controlled trials is largely lacking. The aim of our study is to compare magnesium hydroxide with macrogol /electrolytes in the prevention of OIC in patients with incurable cancer and to compare side-effects, tolerability and cost-effectiveness. METHODS: Our study is an open-label, randomized, multicenter study to examine if magnesium hydroxide is non-inferior to macrogol/electrolytes in the prevention of OIC. In total, 330 patients with incurable cancer, starting with opioids for pain management, will be randomized to treatment with either macrogol/electrolytes or magnesium hydroxide. The primary outcome measure is the proportion of patients with a score of < 30 on the Bowel Function Index (BFI), measured on day 14. The Rome IV criteria for constipation, side effects of and satisfaction with laxatives, pain scores, quality of life (using the EQ-5D-5L), daily use of laxatives and escape medication, and cost-effectiveness will also be assessed. DISCUSSION: In this study we aim to examine if magnesium hydroxide is non-inferior to macrogol/electrolytes in the prevention of OIC. The outcome of our study will contribute to prevention of OIC and scientific evidence of guidelines on (opioid-induced) constipation.

Here, the antihypertensive and cardioprotective effects of an intravenous hinokitiol injection were fully investigated in angiotensin II-induced hypertensive emergency in rats. Hinokitiol intravenous injection was prepared in the form of self-nanoemulsifying drug delivery system. Rat's arterial and ventricular hemodynamics were measured in real-time recordings in addition to surface electrocardiogram while slow injection of cumulative doses of hinokitiol or vehicle as well as time control. Hinokitiol at dose 10 mg/kg showed a considerable reduction in the raised systolic blood pressure (30 mmHg) within only 30 min. The decrease in blood pressure seems to be mediated through a reduction in peripheral resistance, as appears from the decreases in diastolic pressure, dicrotic notch pressure, and pulse pressure. In addition, hinokitiol injection reduced heart load due to the decrease in heart rate, increases in cycle duration (particularly the non-ejection duration) and diastolic duration, and decreases in end-diastolic pressure. An effect most likely mediated via prolongation of ventricular repolarization as appears from the increases in PR, QTc, and JT intervals. However, acute intravenous injection of hinokitiol neither affected the baroreflex sensitivity nor sodium/potassium balance. In conclusion, acute hinokitiol intravenous injection markedly reduced severe hypertension in rats. This effect seems to be mediated through decreasing peripheral resistance and decreasing cardiac load, suggesting that it is an effective treatment in hypertensive emergencies after clinical evaluation.",

      "abstract": "Despite the lack of proven superiority in mortality compared to intermittent hemodialysis, continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) is the preferred renal replacement therapy modality for critically ill patients with acute kidney injury (AKI) due to better hemodynamic stability and steady correction of electrolytes disturbances and volume overload. Multiple and complex electrolyte disorders in patients with AKI can be managed effectively with CRRT because controlled and predictable correction is feasible. Thus, CRRT has an advantage with safety over conventional hemodialysis, especially in patients with both renal dysfunction and electrolyte disorder that require a sophisticated treatment with avoidance of rapid correction. On the contrary, CRRT can potentially lead to paradoxical disturbance of electrolytes such as hypokalemia or hypophosphatemia, especially in patients under high dose or prolonged duration of CRRT treatment. These electrolytes related complications can be prevented with close monitoring followed by the appropriate use of CRRT fluids. Although there is a lack of solid evidence and standardized guideline for CRRT prescriptions, optimal management of various electrolyte disturbances can be achieved with individualized and tailored dialysate and replacement fluid prescriptions. Several commercially available CRRT solutions with varying compositions provide flexibility to manage electrolyte disorders and maintain the stability of electrolyte. In this review, we discuss various prescription methods to manage common electrolyte imbalances as well as preventative strategies to maintain electrolyte homeostasis during CRRT providing detailed protocols used in our center. This review may contribute to future research that can lead to the development of clinical practice guidelines."

      "abstract": "Ceramic electrolytes hold application prospects in all-solid-state lithium batteries (ASSLB). However, the ionic conductivity of ceramic electrolytes is limited by their large thickness and intrinsic resistance. To cope with this challenge, a two-dimensional (2D) vermiculite film has been successfully prepared by self-assembling expanded vermiculite nanosheets. The raw vermiculite mineral is first exfoliated to thin sheets of several atomic layers with about 1.2 nm interlayer channels by a thermal expansion and ionic exchanging treatment. Then, through vacuum filtration, the ion-exchanged expanded vermiculite (IEVMT) sheets can be assembled into thin films with a controllable thickness. Benefiting from the thin thickness and naturally lamellar framework, the as-prepared IEVMT thin film exhibits excellent ionic conductivity of 0.310 S·cm-1 at 600 °C with low excitation energy. In addition, the IEVMT thin film demonstrates good mechanical and thermal stability with a low coefficient of friction of 0.51 and a low thermal conductivity of 3.9 × 10-3 W·m-1·K-1. This reveals that reducing the thickness and utilizing the framework is effective in increasing the ionic conductivity and provides a promising stable and low-cost candidate for high-performance solid electrolytes."

      "abstract": "Doping engineering in nanostructured carbon materials is an effective approach to modify heteroatom species and surface electronic structures. Herein, an advanced electrode material based on a honeycomb-like porous carbon matrix with tunable N-doped configurations is prepared via 4,4'-bipyridine (4,4'-bpy)-assisted pyrolysis of SiO2@ZIF-8 templates and subsequent etching treatment. Interestingly, the amounts of pyridinic-N and graphitic-N can be controlled by rationally varying the content of 4,4'-bpy which acts as the N source in the pyrolysis process. Both experimental results and density functional theory calculations have revealed that synergistically with 3D interconnected porous architecture, pyridinic-N and graphitic-N have different effects on the electrochemical performances in aqueous and ionic liquid gel electrolytes for symmetric supercapacitors. Highly exposed pyridinic-N endows the carbon electrode with a strengthened pseudocapacitance contribution manifested as a high specific capacitance of 436.1 F g-1 and exceptional stability of almost 100% capacitance retention after 5000 cycles at 10 A g-1 in the KOH/polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) electrolyte. By contrast, graphitic-N is propitious for reinforced electrical double-layer capacitance contribution, reflected by a maximum energy density of 125.4 Wh kg-1 in the 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate/poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene) (EMIMBF4/PVDF-HFP) electrolyte.

Angus-crossbred steers (N = 120; initial body weight = 544 ± 52 kg) were assigned to 30 pens (4 steers per pen; 15 pens per treatment) in a randomized complete block design where pen was the experimental unit. A steam-flaked corn-based finishing diet was offered to ad libitum, and the treatments were as follows: 1) control and 2) 30 g per steer-daily (dry matter basis) of the Nutritional Packet. The Nutritional Packet was formulated to provide 1.7 × 1010 CFU per steer-daily of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, 162 mg per steer-daily of vitamin C; 400 mg per steer-daily of vitamin B1; 2.4 g per steer-daily of NaCl, and 2.4 g per steer-daily of KCl. Data were analyzed using the GLIMMIX procedure of SAS with the fixed effect of treatment and the random effect of block. The average daily gain (P = 0.89), dry matter intake (P = 0.57), and gain efficiency (P = 0.82) were not affected by the inclusion of the Nutritional Packet. Digestibility of dry and organic matter, and neutral and acid detergent fiber increased (P ≤ 0.02) for steers offered the Nutritional Packet, while a trend for the same response was observed for hemicellulose (P = 0.08). The 12th rib backfat thickness increased (P = 0.02) for carcasses of steers offered the Nutritional Packet, followed by a greater (P = 0.03) calculated yield grade, whereas other carcass traits were not affected (P ≥ 0.32). While the steers under the control diet decreased behavior activities on day 63, a consistent pattern of feeding behavior measurements (activity min/d and min/kg of dry and organic matter, fiber fractions, and digestible nutrients) were observed for steers consuming the Nutritional Packet during both feeding behavior assessment periods (treatment × period interactions, P ≤ 0.03). Overall time (min/d) spent on rumination, drinking, active, chewing, and resting were not affected (P ≥ 0.28) by treatments. The Nutritional Packet offered to steers during the final 64 d on feed induced an improvement in apparent digestibility of nutrients and carcass fat deposition, without affecting growth performance or other carcass quality indices. Such effects associated with the more consistent feeding behavior of steers receiving the Nutritional Packet may warrant a shorter time on feed during the final portion of the finishing phase.",

      "abstract": "Markers used in everyday clinical practice cannot distinguish between the permanent impairment of renal function. Sodium and potassium values and their interdependence are key parameters in addition to volemia for the assessment of cardiorenal balance. The aim of this study was to investigate volemia and electrolyte status from a clinical cardiorenal viewpoint under consideration of renal function utilizing artificial intelligence. In this paper, an analysis of five variables: B-type natriuretic peptide, sodium, potassium, ejection fraction, EPI creatinine-cystatin C, was performed using an algorithm based on the adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system. B-type natriuretic peptide had the greatest influence on the ejection fraction. It has been shown that values of both Na+ and K+ lead to deterioration of the condition and vital endangerment of patients. To identify the risk of occurrence, the model identifies a prognostic biomarker by random regression from the total data set. The predictions obtained from this model can help optimize preventative strategies and intensive monitoring for patients identified as at risk for electrolyte disturbance and hypervolemia. This approach may be superior to the traditional diagnostic approach due to its contribution to more accurate and rapid diagnostic interpretation and better planning of further patient treatment."

Because of tofogliflozin's osmotic diuresis mechanism, patients' serum electrolytes, body fluid levels, and cardiac function must be monitored. We retrospectively analyzed the cases of 64 elderly Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) who received tofogliflozin for 3 months. Their HbA1c, serum electrolytes (sodium, potassium, chloride), hematocrit, brain natriuretic peptide (cardiac volume load marker) and renin and aldosterone (RAA; an index of regulatory hormones involved in body fluid retention) were continuously monitored during the investigation period. Renal function and cardiac function (by echocardiography) were assessed throughout the period. HbA1c significantly decreased (β1=-0.341, p<0.0001, linear regression analysis [LRA]). Most of the hormonal, electrolyte, and physiological parameters were maintained throughout the study period. In these circumstances, E/e' tended to decrease (β1=-0.382, p=0.13, LRA). Compared to the baseline, E/e' was significantly decreased at 1 and 3 months (p<0.01, p<0.05). In the higher E/e' group (E/e'≥10, n=34), E/e' decreased significantly (β1=-0.63, p<0.05, LRA). ΔE/e' was correlated with body-weight change during treatment (r=0.64, p<0.01). The 3-month tofogliflozin treatment improved glycemic control and diastolic function represented by E/e' in T2DM patients, without affecting serum electrolytes, renal function, or RAA. No negative impacts on the patients were observed. Three-month tofogliflozin treatment lowered glucose and improved cardiac diastolic function.",

      "abstract": "Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) are regarded to be the most promising electrochemical energy storage device for portable electronics as well as electrical vehicles. However, due to their limited-service life, tons of spent LIBs are expected to be produced in the recent years. Suitable recycling technology is therefore becoming more and more important as improper treatment of spent LIBs, especially the aged organic electrolyte, can cause severe environmental pollution and threats to human health. The organic solvents and high concentration of lithium salts in aged electrolytes are always sensitive toward water and air, which would easily hydrolyze and decompose into toxic fluorine-containing compounds, leading to severe fluorine pollution of the surrounding environment. Hence, recycling aged electrolytes from spent LIBs is an efficient way to avoid this potential risk to the environment. However, several issues inhibit the realization of electrolyte recycling, including the volatile, inflammable, and toxic nature of the electrolytes, the difficulty to extract electrolytes from the electrodes and separators, and various electrolyte compositions inside LIBs from different applications and companies. Herein, the current progress in recycling methods for aged electrolytes from spent LIBs is summarized and perspectives on future development of electrolyte recycling are presented."

      "abstract": "Compared with conventional liquid electrolytes, solid electrolytes can better improve the safety properties and achieve high-energy-density Li-ion batteries. Sulfide-based solid electrolytes have attracted significant attention owing to their high ionic conductivities, which are comparable to those of their liquid counterparts. Among them, Li thiophosphates, including Li-argyrodites, are widely studied. In this study, Li thiophosphate solid electrolytes containing BH4 - anions are prepared via a simple and fast milling method even without heat treatment. The synthesized materials exhibit a high ionic conductivity of up to 11 mS cm-1 at 25 °C, which is much higher than reported values. To elucidate the mechanism behind, the thiophosphate local structure, whose effect on the ionic conductivity remains unclear to date, is investigated. Raman and solid-state NMR spectroscopies are performed to identify the thiophosphate local structure in the sulfide samples. Based on the analysis results, the ratios of the different thiophosphate units in the prepared electrolyte samples are determined. It is found that the thiophosphate local structure can be varied by changing the amount of LiBH4 and the milling conditions, which significantly impact the ionic conductivity. The all-solid-state cell with the prepared solid electrolyte exhibits superior cycle and rate performances."

However, there were differences in results found from blood gas analyzers for hemoglobin (Hgb) and electrolytes parameters. We conducted a comparative validity study in ED in patients who had requirements of venous gas analysis, complete blood count, and electrolytes. The objective was to find the correlation of Hgb, sodium (Na+), and potassium (K+) values between the blood gas analyzer and laboratory autoanalyzer. METHODS: A total of 206 paired samples were tested for Hgb, Na+, and K+. Total 4.6 ml of venous blood was collected from each participant, 0.6 ml was used for blood gas analysis as POC testing and 4 ml was sent to the central laboratory for electrolyte and Hgb estimation. RESULTS: The mean difference between POC and laboratory method was 0.608 ± 1.41 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.41-0.80; P < 0.001) for Hgb, 0.92 ± 3.5 (95% CI, 0.44-1.40) for Na+, and 0.238 ± 0.62 (95% CI, -0.32-0.15; P < 0.001) for K+. POC testing and laboratory method showed a strong positive correlation with Pearson correlation coefficient (r) of 0.873, 0.928, and 0.793 for Hgb, Na+, and K+, respectively (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Although there was a statistical difference found between the two methods, it was under the United States Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendment range. Hence, starting the therapy according to the blood gas analyzer results may be beneficial to the patient and improve the outcome."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Endovascular treatment (EVT) is the best treatment for acute ischemic stroke with large vessel occlusion (LVO) and makes it possible to analyze the blood contents from the occluded vascular compartments. In this study, we attempted to evaluate regional changes in blood gas values and electrolytes in the occluded vessels, aiming to determine whether these changes can predict outcomes in LVO patients receiving EVT. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We prospectively observed 45 consecutive ischemic stroke patients with LVO of the anterior circulation who underwent EVT. We collected the arterial blood proximal to the occlusion site before and after EVT, and the blood within the core of the occluded vascular compartment (distal to the thrombus) and evaluated the labs for blood gas values and electrolytes. Femoral samples were obtained under physiological flow conditions to represent systemic arterial blood. RESULTS: Compared with the femoral arterial blood samples, significant decreases in K+, Ca2+, HCO3-, BE, HCT, tHbc, and TCO2 levels were observed in the proximal luminal blood before EVT. Decreases in K+ and Ca2+ levels were also observed in the proximal luminal blood after EVT. Proximal/femoral ratio of pH and Na+ was associated with short-term clinical outcomes at 72 hours after EVT. A higher proximal/femoral Na+ ratio was associated with successful recanalization. Further analysis after propensity score matching showed significant changes in blood gas and electrolyte among different arterial locations in ICA and MCA LVO participants. Linear regression analyses indicated that the proximal/femoral ratio of pH, Na+, pCO2, HCO3, and TCO2 before EVT were associated with decrease in NIHSS score at 72 hours in ICA-LVO group. CONCLUSIONS: Obvious changes in several parameters of arterial blood gas and electrolyte from the ischemic vasculature occur during hyperacute stroke. Proximal/femoral pH and Na+ ratio before EVT may be associated with short-term clinical outcome, which deserve to be further investigated.",

The interruption of sympathetic nervous system was regarded as a possible mechanism for RDN regulating blood pressure. While the results reflected by renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), catecholamines and electrolytes remained inconsistent and was never systematically assessed. Pubmed, Embase, and Web of Science were comprehensively searched from inception to September 5, 2021. Studies that evaluated the effects of RDN on RAAS, catecholamines, and electrolytes were identified. Primary outcomes were changes in RAAS hormones after RDN, and secondary outcomes involved changes in plasma norepinephrine, serum, and urinary sodium and potassium. Out of 6391 retrieved studies, 20 studies (two randomized controlled studies and 18 observational studies) involving 771 persons were eventually included. Plasma renin activity had a statistically significant reduction after RDN (0.24 ng/mL/h, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.44, P = .02). While no significant change was found regarding plasma aldosterone (1.53 ng/dL, 95% CI -0.61 to 3.67, P = .16), norepinephrine (0.42 nmol/L, 95% -0.51 to 1.35, P = 0.38), serum sodium and potassium (0.16 mmol/L, 95% CI -0.17 to 0.49, P = .34; -0.02 mmol/L, 95% CI -0.09 to 0.04, P = .48, respectively), and urinary sodium and potassium (3.95 mmol/24 h, 95% CI -29.36 to 37.26, P = .82; 10.22 mmol/24 h, 95% CI -12.11 to 32.54, P = .37, respectively).

In this study, the structure and dynamics of water at the two prevalent crystallographic terminations of gamma-alumina, [110] and [100], and the influence of salts─sodium chloride, ammonium acetate, barium acetate, and barium nitrate on such properties─were investigated using equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations. The resulting interfacial phenomena were quantified from simulation trajectories via atomic density profiles, angle probability distributions, residence times, 2-D density distributions within the hydration layers, and hydrogen bond density profiles. Analysis and interpretation of the results are supported by simulation snapshots. Taken together, our results show stronger interaction and closer association of water with the [110] surface, compared to [100], while ion-induced disruption of interfacial water structure was more prevalent at the [100] surface. For the latter, a stronger association of cations is observed, namely sodium and ammonium, and ion adsorption appears determined by their size. The differences in surface-water interactions between the two terminations are linked to their respective surface features and distributions of surface groups, with atomistic-scale roughness of the [110] surface promoting closer association of interfacial water. The results highlight the fundamental role of surface characteristics in determining surface-water interactions, and the resulting effects on ion-surface and ion-water interactions. Since the two terminations of gamma-alumina considered represent interfaces of significance to numerous industrial applications, the results provide insights relevant for catalyst preparation and adsorption-based water treatment, among other applications.",

      "abstract": "Superionic halides have returned to the spotlight of solid electrolytes because of their satisfactory ionic conductivity, soft texture, and stability toward high-voltage electrode materials. Among them, Li2ZrCl6 has aroused interests since abundant Zr element can reduce the cost of large-scale synthesis. However, the related research is very limited, including the detailed parameters during synthesis and the possible strategies for enhancing ionic conductivity. In this work, we have systematically investigated the effects of synthesis parameters on the structure and ionic conductivity of Li2ZrCl6 during the ball-milling annealing process. It is found that mild heat treatment (100 °C) can largely enhance the ionic conductivity of ball-milled electrolytes by 2-3 times, which has not been previously reported. Such enhancement is mainly attributed to the network-like micromorphology composed of nanorods, nanowires, or nanoballs, which is beneficial for lithium ion migration. Finally, the modified Li2ZrCl6 (4.46 × 10-4 S cm-1 @ RT) is also proved to be applicable in LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2/ Li2ZrCl6/ Li6PS5Cl/Li-In all-solid-state lithium metal batteries (ASSLMBs). It presents high initial charge capacity of 176.4 mAh g-1 and satisfactory cycle stability since a discharge capacity of 90.8 mAh g-1 is maintained after 40 cycles at 0.1 C. The Li2ZrCl6 electrolytes synthesized via the mechanochemical method is promising to be applied in the high-voltage ASSLMBs, and its ionic conductivity can be enhanced by the strategies provided in our work."

However, the low Coulombic efficiency (CE) of the Na plating/stripping process and the problem of safety hinder their practical application. Herein, we report a facile strategy for employing the fluorinated phosphate solvents to realize highly reversible Na plating/stripping and improve the safety performance. The fluorinated phosphate molecules reduce the polarity of the solvent and lower the coordination number to Na+, which makes it possible to form the anion-induced ion-solvent-coordinated (AI-ISC) structures with high reduction tolerance. Moreover, the fluorination treatment enhances the oxidation resistance of the phosphate solvent, enabling compatibility with the high-voltage Na3V2(PO4)2F3 (NVPF) cathode. As expected, the Na@Al//NVPF full cell with the as-prepared 0.9 M NaFSI/tris(2,2,2-trifluoroethyl) phosphate (TFEP) demonstrates a capacity retention of 83.4% after 200 cycles with an average CE of 99.6%.

This prospective, randomized, clinical study compared two balanced crystalloid solutions regarding their influence on acid-base status, electrolytes, and lactate values, when given to dogs as a resuscitation bolus of 30 mL/kg. MATERIAL AND METHODS: One hundred client-owned dogs presenting to the emergency service with signs of fluid deficits were randomly assigned to receive an intravenous bolus of 30 mL/kg of either a lactate- (LAC), or an acetate-containing solution (ACET). Before and after the bolus, vital parameters were assessed, and a venous blood gas analysis was performed. RESULTS: Both solutions performed equally well in decreasing the heart rate (ACET: -10 ± 27 bpm, LAC: -12 ± 30 bpm; p = 0.737). The acetate-containing solution caused a significant decrease in plasma lactate levels (p = 0.016), anion gap (p < 0.001), and potassium (p < 0.001), and a significant increase in chloride (p < 0.001), and ionized calcium (p = 0.014). The lactate-containing solution caused a significant decrease in anion gap (p < 0.001), sodium (p = 0.016), and potassium (p = 0.001), and a significant increase in chloride (p < 0.001). ACET causes a stronger decrease in plasma lactate (p = 0.015), sodium (p = 0.039), potassium (p = 0.006), and an increase in chloride (p < 0.001), and ionized calcium (p = 0.016) compared to LAC. CONCLUSION: Both solutions caused mild changes in electrolyte concentrations and had minor influence on acid-base status when used for bolus therapy in dogs with fluid deficits. Further studies are needed to evaluate their influence on acid-base status, lactate, and electrolytes when used in larger volumes and for a longer time span."

METHODS: We designed a translational inpatient trial to elucidate the biological pathway leading from nutritional change, through hormonal response, reversal of urine electrolytes ratio, to BP reduction. RESULTS: A single-center open-label interventional trial. Volunteers were admitted for 14 days, transitioning from an American-style diet to DASH diet. Vital signs, blood, and urine samples were collected daily. Participants completed two 24-hour ambulatory BP measurements (ABPM) and two 24-hour urine collections on days 1 and 10. Nine volunteers completed the protocol. During inpatient stay, serum aldosterone increased from day 0 (mean 8.3 ± 5.0) to day 5 (mean 17.8 ± 5.8) after intervention and decreased on day 11 (mean 11.5 ± 4.7) despite continuous exposure to the same diet (p-value = 0.002). Urine electrolyte ratio ([Na]/[K]) decreased significantly from a mean of 3.5 to 1.16 on day 4 (p < 0.001). BP by 24-hour ABPM decreased by a mean of 3.7 mmHg systolic BP and 2.3 mmHg diastolic BP from day 1 to 10. CONCLUSION: Shifting from a high-sodium/low-potassium diet to the opposite composition leads to aldosterone increase and paradoxical BP reduction. Urine electrolyte ratio reflects nutritional changes and should guide clinicians in assessing adherence to lifestyle modification."

The MC activity of FC was dose-dependent: we observed a reduced but significant positive linear correlation between FC dose and sodium (r = 0.132) and negative linear correlation between FC and potassium (r = - 0.162) or renin (r = - 0.131, all p < 0.01). An overall reduction in the FC dose was observed at T2 in the group with longer follow-up (> 60 months, p < 0.05). Higher doses of FC were observed in patients with low-normal renin, especially in autoimmune PAI (86 vs 65 μg/daily, p < 0.05). On the contrary, reduced sodium and increased potassium levels were observed in patients with high renin at T2. The number of cardiovascular events (15 in the whole cohort) was similar in patients sorted by renin levels or FC dose. CONCLUSIONS: Renin and electrolytes can indicate the MC activity of FC treatment: they should be routinely evaluated and used to titrate its dose that can be reduced in the long-term follow-up.",

This article summarizes these main causes, the proposed pathophysiology and the recommended management for these disturbances. RECENT FINDINGS: There have been many cancer drugs approved in the field of oncology over the past several years and a subset of these drugs have been associated with electrolytes disturbances. This includes, for example, immune checkpoint inhibitor related hyperkalemia, fibroblast growth factor 23 inhibitor associated hyperphosphatemia and epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitor associated hypomagnesemia and hypocalcaemia. SUMMARY: This article provides an updated review of certain electrolytes disturbance in cancer patients and allows clinicians to have a greater awareness and knowledge of these electrolyte abnormalities in efforts to early recognition and timely management.",

Herein, we present a surface functionalization method to improve the ion conduction efficiency at the interface between a structural electrode and a solid electrolyte that consists of a bi-continuous network of epoxy and ionic liquid (IL). Composite supercapacitors made with this electrolyte and carbon fiber (CF) electrodes coated with manganese dioxide (MnO2) demonstrate that treating the electrodes with the silane can increase the areal capacitance by 300% without degrading the tensile strength. The dual-phase electrolyte containing 40 wt % IL and 60 wt % epoxy exhibits the highest multifunctional performance, measured by the product of stiffness and ionic conductivity. The outstanding mechanical and energy storage properties demonstrate that the silane treatment of MnO2-coated CF fabric structural electrodes is a promising method for future high-performance structural composite supercapacitors."

      "abstract": "Halide electrolytes are rising stars among inorganic solid-state electrolytes due to their high ionic conductivity and good compatibility with high-voltage electrodes. However, their traditional synthesis methods including ball-milling annealing are usually energy-intensive and time-consuming compared with liquid-mediated routes. What's more, the only method in aqueous solution is not perfect considering detrimental effect of trace water for battery performances. Here, we propose a novel ethanol-mediated synthesis route for superionic Li3InCl6 electrolyte via energy-friendly dissolution and post-treatment. The organics in ethanol-mediated precursor disappear in form of light gas during post-treatment. And Li3InCl6 with best thermal stability and ionic conductivity (0.79 mS cm-1, 20 °C) can be successfully prepared after postheating for 3 h at 200 °C. Besides, it is also found that the ionic conductivity of Li3InCl6 is positively correlated with peak intensity ratio of (131) plane/(001) plane since crystal plane and preferred orientation can directly affect polyhedrons through which lithium ions migrate in crystalline conductors. The assembled LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2/Li3InCl6/Li10GeP2S12/Li-In cell presents high initial charge capacity of 174.8 mAh g-1 at 0.05 C and a good rate performance of 122.9 mAh g-1 at 1 C. Especially, the retention rate of charge capacity can reach 94.8% after 200 cycles. The ethanol-mediated synthesized Li3InCl6 is a novel promising electrolyte which can be coupled with high-voltage cathode for the application of all-solid-state lithium-metal batteries."

      "abstract": "UNLABELLED: A pregnant mother undergoes significant changes in acid-base status as well as sodium and calcium metabolism to combat her physiological needs of pregnancy. Pregnant patients experience mild respiratory alkalosis due to the stimulation of the respiratory center by progesterone. This is associated with a corresponding increase in bicarbonate excretion by kidneys; as a result, the pH remains slightly high (7.40-7.45) but within the normal range. Pregnant women are predisposed to starvation ketosis as compared to nonpregnant states due to relative insulin resistance and increased production of the counter-regulatory hormone. Physiological mild hyponatremia occurs during pregnancy due to increased AVP secretion caused by resetting of osmoreceptors in the hypothalamus at a lower osmolality, but values below 130 mEq/L require a diagnostic workup and intervention. Gestational diabetes insipidus can occur due to increased production or decreased destruction of enzyme vasopressinase. Secretion of parathyroid hormone-related peptide by the placenta and breasts and two- to three-fold increased calcium and phosphate absorption in the maternal gut are the key changes in calcium metabolism during pregnancy. Though rare, both hypo- and hypercalcemia in pregnancy are associated with significant maternofetal morbidity and mortality. HOW TO CITE THIS ARTICLE: Ahmed A.

      "abstract": "Sulfide solid electrolytes with high ionic conductivity and high air stability must be developed for manufacturing sulfide all-solid-state batteries. Li10GeP2S12-type and argyrodite-type solid electrolytes exhibit a high ionic conductivity of ∼10-2 S cm-1 at room temperature, while emitting toxic H2S gas when exposed to air. We focused on hexagonal Li4SnS4 prepared by mechanochemical treatment because it comprises air-stable SnS4 tetrahedra and shows higher ionic conductivity than orthorhombic Li4SnS4 prepared by solid-phase synthesis. Herein, to enhance the ionic conductivity of hexagonal Li4SnS4, LiI was added to Li4SnS4 by mechanochemical treatment. The ionic conductivity of 0.43LiI·0.57Li4SnS4 increased by 3.6 times compared with that of Li4SnS4. XRD patterns of Li4SnS4 with LiI showed peak-shifting to lower angles, indicating that introduction of I-, which has a large ionic radius, expanded the Li conduction paths. Furthermore, Li3PS4, which is the most air-stable in the Li2S-P2S5 system and has higher ionic conductivity than Li4SnS4, was added to the LiI-Li4SnS4 system. We found that 0.37LiI·0.25Li3PS4·0.38Li4SnS4 sintered at 200 °C showed the highest ionic conductivity of 5.5 × 10-4 S cm-1 at 30 °C in the hexagonal Li4SnS4-based solid electrolytes. The rate performance of an all-solid-state battery using 0.37LiI·0.25Li3PS4·0.38Li4SnS4 heated at 200 °C was higher than those obtained using Li4SnS4 and 0.43LiI·0.57Li4SnS4. In addition, it exhibited similar air stability to Li4SnS4 by formation of LiI·3H2O in air. Therefore, addition of LiI and Li3PS4 to hexagonal Li4SnS4 by mechanochemical treatment is an effective way to enhance ionic conductivity without decreasing the air stability of Li4SnS4."

      "abstract": "Lithium metal batteries using solid electrolytes are considered to be the next-generation lithium batteries due to their enhanced energy density and safety. However, interfacial instabilities between Li-metal and solid electrolytes limit their implementation in practical batteries. Herein, Li-metal batteries using tailored garnet-type Li7-xLa3-aZr2-bO12 (LLZO) solid electrolytes is reported, which shows remarkable stability and energy density, meeting the lifespan requirements of commercial applications. We demonstrate that the compatibility between LLZO and lithium metal is crucial for long-term stability, which is accomplished by bulk dopant regulating and dopant-specific interfacial treatment using protonation/etching. An all-solid-state with 5 mAh cm-2 cathode delivers a cumulative capacity of over 4000 mAh cm-2 at 3 mA cm-2, which to the best of our knowledge, is the highest cycling parameter reported for Li-metal batteries with LLZOs. These findings are expected to promote the development of solid-state Li-metal batteries by highlighting the efficacy of the coupled bulk and interface doping of solid electrolytes."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Globally, rising blood pressure is of public health concern as it is a major cause of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), and preventable death. This study accessed the relationship of blood pressure status, dietary factors and serum electrolytes among in-school adolescents in Ilishan-Remo, Ogun State, Nigeria. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey of 488 secondary school students (aged 10-19 years). Blood pressures were assessed using auscultatory method and questionnaires were used to obtain food frequency and 24-hour dietary recall data. Blood samples from volunteers were used for serum sodium and potassium assays. RESULTS: The mean systolic blood pressure (SBP) increased with age, irrespective of gender. The prevalence of elevated blood pressure and hypertension among participants were 19.3% and 10.5%, respectively, with males and females having similar pattern. Dietary factors like addition of table salt to already prepared foods, higher intake of eggs, and lower intake of vegetables were associated with the development of elevated blood pressure among the adolescents. The estimated mean dietary intakes (mg/person/day) of sodium and potassium were 2289±938.7 and 1321±603.8, respectively, with majority consuming far higher (for sodium - 80%) or far below (for potassium - 95%) recommendations. The mean serum sodium (138.0±18.3 mmolL-1) and potassium (3.06±1.1 mmolL-1) were similar across genders. A significant (p<0.05) negative relationship exists between serum potassium and SBP. CONCLUSIONS: The blood pressure status of the adolescents studied are of great concern and are somewhat negatively influenced by poor dietary and lifestyle practices. They require prompt intervention to slow down the development of CVDs in the future.",

This drying-free nanofiller incorporation method enhances the homogeneous ZIF-8 distributions in the PVA/ZIF-8/GA composites to overcome the nanofiller aggregation problem in the mixed matrix membranes. Various ZIF-8 concentrations (25.4, 40.5 and 45.4 wt.%) are used to study the suitability of the resulting GA-crosslinked composites for direct alkaline methanol fuel cell (DAMFC). Surface morphological analysis confirmed homogeneous ZIF-8 particle distribution in the GA-crosslinked composites with a defect- and crack-free structure. The increased ionic conductivity (21% higher than the ZIF-free base material) and suppressed alcohol permeability (94% lower from the base material) of PVA/40.5%ZIF-8/GA resulted in the highest selectivity among the prepared composites. In addition, the GA-crosslinked composites’ selectivity increased to 1.5−2 times that of those without crosslink. Moreover, the ZIF-8 nanofillers improved the mechanical strength and alkaline stability of the composites. This was due to the negligible volume swelling ratio (<1.4%) of high (>40%) ZIF-8-loaded composites. After 168 h of alkaline treatment, the PVA/40.5%ZIF-8/GA composite had almost negligible ionic conductivity loss (0.19%) compared with the initial material. The maximum power density (Pmax) of PVA/40.5%ZIF-8/GA composite was 190.5 mW cm−2 at 60 °C, an increase of 181% from the PVA/GA membrane. Moreover, the Pmax of PVA/40.5%ZIF-8/GA was 10% higher than that without GA crosslinking. These swelling-resistant and stable solid electrolytes are promising in alkaline fuel cell applications."

The replacement of NH4F for NaAlO2 or Na2SiO3 in the glycerol solution and the influence of the H2O concentration have been examined. The obtained anodic layers were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Raman spectroscopy, and potentiodynamic polarization tests. Here, it was found that, although the anodic layers fabricated within the NaAlO2-electrolyte and high H2O concentrations presented limited adherence to the substrate, the anodizing in the Na2SiO3-electrolyte and low H2O concentrations allowed the growth oxide layers, and even a type of ordered morphology was observed. Furthermore, the electrochemical tests in chloride solution determined low chemical stability and active behavior of oxide layers grown in NaAlO2-electrolyte. In contrast, the corrosion resistance was improved approximately one order of magnitude compared to the non-anodized 304L SS substrate for the anodizing treatment in glycerol, 0.05 M Na2SiO3, and 1.7 vol% H2O at 20 mA/cm2 for 6 min. Thus, this anodizing condition offers insight into the sustainable growth of oxide layers with potential anti-corrosion properties."

While the binary electrolyte has been widely studied, such as the associated intriguing interfacial instabilities, multi-component electrolyte is by far less known. Here, based on the classic Cu|CuSO4 |Cu electrochemical system, the effect of supporting electrolyte is systematically investigated by highlighting the inert cations. In an annulus microfluidic device, the suppression of a previously known electro-osmotic instability and the emergence of an array of the remote electroconvection along the azimuthal direction is found. A distinctive inert-cation concentration valley propagates radially outward at a speed limited by the electromigration velocity. Remarkably, the simultaneous visualization of spatiotemporal evolution demonstrates the correlation of the concentration valley and electroconvection at a microscopic level. The underlying physical mechanism of their correlation is discussed, and the scaling analysis agrees with experiments. This work might inspire more future work on the multi-component electrolyte, such as for the suppression of interfacial hydrodynamic instability and mitigation of dendrite growth, with the technological implications for water treatment and energy storage in batteries."

The aim of the study was to evaluate the impact of time elapsed between the oral furosemide administration and sample collection on urine chemistry in dogs with myxomatous mitral valve disease (MMVD) receiving diuretic therapy in American College of Veterinary Internal Medicine (ACVIM) stage C. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Seventy-three dogs with MMVD ACVIM stage C and 106 healthy dogs were prospectively included. Dogs with MMVD were divided, based on the time of sampling, in morning group (MMVD-MG) of one to 6 h and an evening group (MMVD-EG) over 6 h from oral furosemide administration. Analogously, healthy dogs sampled between 9 a.m. and 1 p.m. and between 2 and 7 p.m. were divided in a morning group (H-MG) and an evening group (H-EG), respectively. Urine chemistry, including fractional excretion of electrolytes, was evaluated and compared among groups. RESULTS: Higher excretion of sodium and chloride and higher urine sodium to urine potassium ratio (uNa+:uK+) were detected in MMVD-MG than MMVD-EG (P = 0.021, P = 0.038, and P = 0.016, respectively). Natriuresis, chloriuresis, and uNa+:uK+ were higher in MMVD-MG than H-MG, while no differences were found in the comparison between H-MG and H-EG and between MMVD-EG and H-EG. CONCLUSIONS: Urinary electrolyte excretion is significantly increased within 6 h from furosemide administration in MMVD ACVIM stage C dogs. Time of sampling from furosemide administration significantly affects urine chemistry in MMVD dogs and should be considered in clinical practice and the research field.",

Spatial learning and memory were measured using the Morris water maze model and serum sodium, calcium, potassium, and chloride were evaluated using Cobas 6000. RESULTS: Spatial learning was improved with trials across the groups, while average escape latency (s) of rats received KESC 200 mg/kg (p<0.001), KESC 300 mg/kg (p<0.01) and KHJ 2.5 mL/kg (p<0.05) was significantly greater than rats that received vehicle. There was no significant difference in the latency between rats that received KESA 300mg/kg and vehicle (p>0.05). Thigmotaxis was significantly higher in rats that received all doses of khat extract (p<0.001). The time spent in the target quadrant in rats that received KESC 300 mg/kg was significantly reduced (p<0.05). Serum calcium level was inversely correlated with the escape latency (R = -0.417, p<0.05) in rats that received khat. CONCLUSIONS: Khat extract and juice administered subchronically, but not subacutely, impaired learning and memory and was associated with serum calcium reduction. The neuronal basis for such alteration should be investigated.",

After a 10-days intervention period supplementation with powder/granulate containing Mg oxide led to an increase in both ionized Mg concentration and % in total Mg in comparison with the baseline. Supplementation with Mg citrate was associated with the significant increase in % of ionized fraction and decrease in serum total Mg concentration. By contrast, among participants consuming Mg carbonate in the form of effervescent tablets ionized Mg concentration and % in total Mg decreased, without detectable changes in serum total Mg. In conclusion, after the short-term supplementation period, Mg oxide demonstrated superior bioavailability compared to the other examined Mg supplements without affecting other minerals' levels.",

      "abstract": "Charged fluids are ubiquitous in biology and in everyday products such as milk, cosmetics, lubricants, paints, or drugs. The stability and aggregation of charged colloidal solutions are of outstanding relevance in nature and in diverse biomedical applications, including the fabrication of photonic materials and scaffolds for biological assemblies, gene therapy, diagnostics, targeted drug delivery, and molecular labeling. When an electrode or a charged colloidal particle is immersed in a Coulombic fluid, an ionic cloud or electrical double layer forms. One of the most simple theoretical descriptions of the electrical double layer can be provided via the non-linear Poisson-Boltzmann theory of point-ions. In planar geometry, it is possible to derive an analytical description of the electrical double layer for z : z electrolytes. In spite of its simplicity, this mean field approach neglects important characteristics of charged fluids such as ion correlations, ionic excluded volume, polarization effects, etc. Thus, in this review article I would like to discuss some consequences of breaking the symmetry in the ionic size and/or valence of charged fluids in the presence of an external field when ion correlations and ionic excluded volume effects are included consistently. The external field can be produced by a charged electrode or an electrified colloidal particle, and the associated electrical double layer is studied via integral equations theory, and/or molecular simulations beyond the classical non-linear Poisson Boltzmann theory of point ions.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION AND AIMS: There are few studies that compare polyethylene glycol (PEG) 3350 and magnesium hydroxide (MH), as long-term treatment of functional constipation (FC) in children, and they do not include infants as young as 6 months of age. Our aim was to determine the efficacy, safety, and acceptability of PEG vs MH in FC, in the long term, in pediatric patients. METHODS: An open-label, parallel, controlled clinical trial was conducted on patients from 6 months to 18 years of age, diagnosed with FC, that were randomly assigned to receive PEG 3350 or MH for 12 months. Success was defined as: ≥ 3 bowel movements/week, with no fecal incontinence, fecal impaction, abdominal pain, or the need for another laxative. We compared adverse events and acceptability, measured as rejected doses of the laxative during the study, in each group and subgroup. RESULTS: Eighty-three patients with FC were included. There were no differences in success between groups (40/41 PEG vs 40/42 MH, p = 0.616). There were no differences in acceptability between groups, but a statistically significant higher number of patients rejected MH in the subgroups > 4 to 12 years and > 12 to 18 years of age (P = .037 and P = .020, respectively). There were no differences regarding adverse events between the two groups and no severe clinical or biochemical adverse events were registered. CONCLUSIONS: The two laxatives were equally effective and safe for treating FC in children from 0.5 to 18 years of age. Acceptance was better for PEG 3350 than for MH in patients above 4 years of age. MH can be considered first-line treatment for FC in children under 4 years of age.",

      "abstract": "Oral electrolyte solutions (OES) are a common, on-farm therapy to reestablish hydration and electrolyte balances in scouring and stressed calves. The objectives were to determine the effects of OES alkalinizing agent and the presence of a milk replacer feeding before OES administration on the abomasal environment in healthy Holstein calves. Abomasum cannulation was performed on 16 Holstein bull calves at 5 d of age. One calf was removed from the study before the calves were randomly assigned to treatments at 9 d of age. Treatments were arranged as a 2-by-2 factorial, with the following factors: oral electrolyte alkalinizing agent [acetate (A) or bicarbonate (B)] and liquid meal type milk replacer (MR) + OES (MR-A, MR-B), or OES only (OES-A, OES-B)]. The OES differed only by alkalinizing agent. On d 9, calves assigned to MR-A (n = 4) or MR-B (n = 4) received their morning MR aliquot 0.5 h before feeding 2 L of OES; the OES-A (n = 3) and OES-B (n = 4) treatment groups were fed 2 L of OES only. Peripheral blood samples and postprandial abomasal fluid samples were collected to assess abomasal pH, abomasal emptying rate (AER), and ex vivo abomasal Escherichia coli growth potential. Postprandial pH was greater in calves fed MR or B-based OES. Abomasal emptying rate was slower in calves receiving MR + OES, regardless of the alkalinizing agent. Ex vivo E. coli colony-forming unit counts were greater in calves fed either MR + OES or bicarbonate-based OES. Supplementing bicarbonate OES in addition to MR alters abomasal dynamics and may promote E. coli growth in postprandial abomasal fluid, partially due to sustained elevations in gastric pH and delayed gastric emptying rates. The OES containing sodium acetate limited ex vivo E. coli growth potential in abomasal fluid, thereby potentially reducing the risk of additional enteric bacterial complications associated with OES therapy.",

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Materials and methods: 60 patients with severe chronic left sided heart failure were enrolled in this study and they were divided in to 2 equal groups' one group with standard therapy of HF and the other with spironolactone in a dose of 25 mg / day, as an additive therapy to the standard one. Serum electrolytes and kidney function tests were assessed at the beginning of the study and after 3 months. RESULTS: Results: A significant increment in serum potassium (p<0.05) was observed in the spironolactone group after 3 months treatment, while no significant reduction in serum sodium (p>0.05) and no significant increase in serum creatinine and blood urea (p>0.05) was noticed in the same group, control group showed no significant changes (p>0.05), in both serum electrolytes (S.K and S.Na) and renal function tests (S.C and B.U). CONCLUSION: Conclusions: Spironolactone caused a significant elevation of serum potassium level but this elevation is still with the clinically accepted ranges when low dose of spironolactone is used and with intact renal function. Serum creatinine level was not significantly increased with 25 mgl day of spironolactone. We conclude that Renal function tests namely blood urea and serum Creatinine, and serum potassium should be closely monitored in patients on spironolactone therapy especially those patients who use ACEI and ARBs in addition.",
