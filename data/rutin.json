      "abstract": "Background: Rutin is a natural flavonoid extracted primarily from plants with anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, and it is highly valuable in the cosmetics industry. However, the poor transdermal permeability of rutin limits its application via transdermal administration. Previous studies have predominantly focused on chemical methods for enhancing penetration. This study investigated the potential of ultrasound as a physical method by which to augment the transdermal absorption and anti-inflammatory effects of rutin. Method: Through in vitro diffusion experiments, we analyzed the effects of the ultrasonic frequency and intensity on percutaneous absorption. The optimal ultrasound parameters were determined based on the intradermal retention rate, which is defined as the proportion of intradermal retention to the total penetration. Parameters with higher retention rates were considered optimal. To validate the anti-inflammatory efficacy of rutin delivered using the ultrasound-assisted method, we employed a tape-stripping technique to induce inflammation in BALB/c nude mice. Eight mice were assigned to each treatment group: (A) self-repair (control group), (B) regular rutin treatment, and (C) ultrasound-assisted treatment. Results: The research findings indicate that ultrasound frequency and intensity of 1 MHz and 0.2 W/cm2, as well as 3 MHz and 0.2 W/cm2, result in the maximum proportion of rutin intradermal retention, exhibiting values 1.8 times (using porcine skin) and 2.63 times (using nude mouse skin) higher than those achieved without ultrasound, respectively. Group C showed the shortest recovery time and displayed complete skin barrier function restoration by the fourth day (p<0.05), whereas group A exhibited the slowest recovery. Conclusions: This study offers an innovative approach for the transdermal delivery of rutin to facilitate skin barrier function repair."

Biofilms provide resistance to conventional antimicrobial treatments, necessitating innovative solutions. This study investigates rutin, a flavonoid glycoside, for its antimicrobial and antibiofilm properties against key oral pathogens. AIM: To evaluate the antibacterial and antibiofilm efficacy of rutin against oral pathogens, including Streptococcus mutans, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Candida albicans, and assess its hemocompatibility as a safe therapeutic agent. METHODOLOGY: Oral pathogens were isolated from clinical samples and identified using the VITEK®2 Compact System. Antimicrobial activity of five flavonoids was screened using the well diffusion method, with rutin demonstrating the highest efficacy. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and antibiofilm activity were assessed using broth microdilution and crystal violet staining, respectively. Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy analyzed live/dead cells in treated biofilms. Hemocompatibility was evaluated via a hemolysis assay. RESULTS: Rutin exhibited significant antimicrobial activity with zone of inhibition as 19 mm (C. albicans), 17 mm (P. aeruginosa), and 17 mm (S. mutans). MIC against mixed biofilms was 10 mM, while treatment at 2 × MIC reduced biofilm biomass by 92 %. Live/dead analysis confirmed extensive microbial cell death in biofilms. Hemolysis rates below 5 % established rutin's biocompatibility. CONCLUSION: Rutin demonstrates potent antimicrobial and antibiofilm efficacy with excellent safety, suggesting its potential as an alternative therapy for biofilm-associated oral infections. Further in vivo studies are warranted to validate these findings."

      "abstract": "Excess iron has been associated with cardiovascular diseases. Flavonoids are antioxidants and cardioprotectants. Therefore, the goal of the current study is to evaluate the anti-apoptotic, antioxidant, and iron-chelating qualities of two flavonoids, rutin (R) and hesperidin (H), as well as their potential to prevent induced ferroptosis in rats. It is an in vivo cross-sectional study, in which rats were divided into 12 groups; control, H, R, H + R, Fe, Fe + IR, Fe + IR + Ref, Fe + H, Fe + IR + H, Fe + R, Fe + IR + R and Fe + IR + H + R. Cardiac and serum iron levels, serum troponin I, creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB), total iron binding capacity (TIBC), transferrin, ferritin, and hepicidin were determined. Moreover, the levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), nitric oxide (NO) and glutathione (GSH) and the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx), were also determined. The expression levels of DMT1, ACSL4, GPX4, Nrf2, and caspase-3 genes were evaluated by RT-qPCR. Lastly, a histological analysis of the heart tissues from several groups of rats was conducted. After hesperidin and/or rutin treatment, our results revealed that cardiac markers (serum troponin I and CK-MB), iron metabolism markers (serum and cardiac iron, TIBC, ferritin, transferrin, hepicidin and DMT1 expression levels) and oxidative stress markers (MDA, NO and ACSL4 expression levels) were significantly (P ⩽ 0.05) reduced, while the antioxidant markers (GSH level, GPx and SOD activities and GPX4 and Nrf2 expression levels) were significantly (P ⩽ 0.05) increased. Also, hesperidin and rutin exerted its protective anti-apoptotic role by significantly (P ⩽ 0.05) decreasing caspase-3 expression levels. Hesperidin and/or rutin treatment can be proposed as a therapeutic candidate to attenuate ferroptosis.",

      "abstract": "Oxidative stress plays a pivotal role in the pathophysiology of infectious diseases, contributing to pathogenesis and the appearance of clinical symptoms. However, the involvement of oxidative stress in renal cryptococcosis remains unknown, as do the potential protective effects of rutin. Cryptococcus neoformans is considered the main agent of cryptococcosis, a systemic life-threatening opportunistic fungal disease that affects internal organs. In 2022, the World Health Organization classified it as a critical-priority group on its Fungal Priority Pathogens List. Rutin, a flavonoid with potent antioxidant and antifungal properties, has been proposed as a protective agent. Thus, this study aimed to evaluate whether 50 mg rutin/kg body weight prevents or reduces C. neoformans var. Grubii-induced renal oxidative stress. Renal fungal burden was significantly lower in rats that were treated with rutin and experimentally infected with C. neoformans, compared to those treated with saline solution and experimentally infected. Renal reactive oxygen species (ROS) and protein carbonylation levels were significantly higher in experimentally infected rats compared to uninfected controls, whereas catalase (CAT) and glutathione S-transferase (GST) activities were significantly lower. Treatment with rutin prevented the increase in renal ROS levels and the inhibition of CAT activity elicited by C. neoformans var. Grubii. However, no significant differences were observed in lipid damage or superoxide dismutase activity. This study is the first to demonstrate that C. neoformans var. Grubii infection induces renal oxidative damage in rats by promoting oxidative stress, increasing ROS levels, and impairing antioxidant defenses. Rutin treatment restored redox status in experimental rats through mechanisms involving oxidative stress. The protective effects of rutin against C. neoformans-induced kidney damage may result from its combined ability to scavenge ROS, inhibit protein damage, and enhance the antioxidant system."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Emerging evidence suggests that chronic stress compromises blood‒brain barrier (BBB) integrity by disrupting brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMECs), contributing to the development of cognitive impairments. Thus, targeting the BBB is expected to be a promising treatment strategy. The biological function of rutin has been investigated in neurological disorders; however, its regulatory role in stress-induced BBB damage and cognitive decline and the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. METHODS: In a chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) mouse model, a fluorescent dye assay and behavioral tests, including a novel object recognition test and Morris water maze, were performed to evaluate the protective effects of rutin on BBB integrity and cognition. The effects of rutin on BMEC function were also investigated in hCMEC/D3 cells (a human brain microvascular endothelial cell line) in vitro. Furthermore, the molecular mechanisms by which rutin restores BBB endothelium dysfunction were explored via RNA-seq, quantitative real-time PCR, western blotting, immunofluorescence and chromatin immunoprecipitation. Finally, biotinylated tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) was employed to test the influence of rutin on the ability of circulating TNF-α to cross the BBB. RESULTS: We identified that rutin attenuated BBB hyperpermeability and cognitive impairment caused by the 8-week CUMS procedure. Moreover, rutin promoted the proliferation, migration and angiogenesis ability of BMECs, and the integrity of the cellular monolayer through positively regulating the expression of genes involved. Furthermore, rutin impeded histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) recruitment and stabilized H3K27ac to increase Claudin-5 protein levels. Ultimately, normalization of the hippocampal HDAC1‒Claudin-5 axis by rutin blocked the infiltration of circulating TNF-α into the brain parenchyma and alleviated neuroinflammation. CONCLUSIONS: This work establishes a protective role of rutin in regulating BMEC function and BBB integrity, and reveals that rutin is a potential drug candidate for curing chronic stress-induced cognitive deficits.",

      "abstract": "Spinal cord injury (SCI) can cause irreversible nerve damage, imposing a significant burden on both patients and society. Methylprednisolone (MP), the recommended clinical drug, possesses antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antiapoptotic effects. It improves nerve damage by inhibiting secondary pathological processes. However, high-dose MP administration may result in side effects, including diabetes, femoral head necrosis, and infections. Therefore, there is a need to identify safer alternatives to mitigate the issues associated with MP administration. Rutin, a natural small molecule, exhibits multifaceted therapeutic capabilities and high biosafety, making it a promising alternative to MP treatment. However, its poor solubility and rapid metabolism limit its in vivo bioavailability. In this study, a drug-free polypeptide (PAH) containing hydrazide groups on the side chains is designed, which can be used for mitigating secondary SCI through scavenging toxic aldehydes. Then, we utilize PAH to encapsulate rutin and develop aldehyde-responsive nanomedicine for intravenous administration in SCI rats, providing a novel approach for the clinical replacement of MP.",

Hepatotoxicity, nephrotoxicity and myeloid suppression may lead to secondary malignancy which is an important adverse effect of paclitaxel-therapy. In this study, we have evaluated the potential protective role of natural flavonoid rutin against paclitaxel-induced toxicities in BALB/cmice. Paclitaxel was administered intraperitoneally (in alternate days at a dose of 8.5 mg/kg b. w.) and rutin was given every day by oral gavages (20 mg/kg b. w.) in BALB/c mice. Results showed that administration of paclitaxel significantly (P < 0.05) increased the generation of ROS and NO in bone marrow, liver and kidney tissues. In contrast, co-administration of rutin and paclitaxel significantly (p < 0.05) reduced the intracellular ROS and NO levels, reversed the toxic effects of paclitaxel through NRF2-mediated activation of antioxidant response element (ARE) pathway and upregulated activity of several phase-II antioxidant enzymes. Furthermore, rutin treatment inhibited apoptosis by downregulated expression of Bax, caspase-3 and cPARP in bone marrow, liver and kidney tissues. Additionally, the chemoprotective potential of rutin was confirmed by histopathological analysis. Thus, our results suggest that co-administration of rutin may serve as a promising preventive strategy against paclitaxel induced toxicities and indicate its future use as an adjuvant in chemotherapy.",

The present study aims to assess its therapeutic efficacy on complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA)induced inflammatory pain. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Arthritis was induced in Wistar rats via subcutaneous administration of CFA into the right hind paw. Rutin (15 and 30 mg/kg) and indomethacin (5 mg/kg, orally) were given once daily for three weeks. Parameters observed included alterations in paw swelling perimeter, arthritis scores, and body weight. Additionally, antinociceptive activity was measured through thermal hyperalgesia and cold allodynia responses. The Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) level in the serum was measured. Malondialdehyde (MDA), thiol levels, catalase, and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities were also evaluated as serum oxidative stress markers. RESULTS: Rutin and indomethacin significantly suppressed alterations in paw edema, pain responses, and arthritis scores and reduced the loss of body weight in contrast to disease-control rats. Furthermore, in contrast to disease control rats, rutin and indomethacin treatment exhibited an anti-inflammatory effect through a marked reduction in TNF-α levels in the serum. Rutin and indomethacin demonstrated a significant increase in catalase and SOD activities, a total thiol level, and a decrease in MDA level compared to the disease-control rats. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that rutin's antiarthritic effect is mediated by its antinociceptive, anti-oxidant, and anti-inflammatory properties."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) is a cyclical mood disorder that severely affects the daily life of women of reproductive age. Most of the medications being used clinically have limitations such as low efficacy, side effects, and high cost, so there is an urgent need to discover safer and more effective medications. Rutin is a natural flavonol glycoside with various pharmacological properties including antidepressant. The study of the efficacy and mechanism of action of rutin in PMDD-depressed subtype model rats plays an important role in the discovery of new drugs for the treatment of PMDD. METHODS: Binding of rutin to gamma-aminobutyric acid type A receptors (GABAA receptors) was probed using molecular docking, microscale thermophoresis, radioactive receptor ligand binding assay and cell membrane clamp experiment. Behavioral tests in mice were performed to screen the optimal dose of rutin. Behavioral tests were performed to evaluate the effects of rutin on depressed mood, memory impairment, and social impairment in PMDD-depressed subtype model rats. HE staining and Golgi staining were performed to observe the neuronal damage in rat hippocampus. UHPLC-MS/MS targeted metabolomics was performed to detect the changes of neurotransmitter content in rat hippocampus. PCR array to detect the effect of rutin on mRNA expression of GABAA receptor partial subunits in rat hippocampus. RESULTS: The docking score of rutin with the GABAA receptor benzodiazepine site was -11.442 and the gliding score was -11.470. The Kd of rutin with the GABAA receptor (α1β2γ2) was 1.17 ± 0.89 μM. Rutin competed with [H3]-flunitrazepam for the GABAA receptor benzodiazepine site and inhibited the inward flow of chloride ions (P < 0.05). In PMDD-depressed subtype rats, rutin alleviated depressed mood, memory impairment and social impairment, ameliorated hippocampal neuronal damage and reduces gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and acetylcholine (ACh) levels (P < 0.05). Moreover, we found that rutin did not affect the relative mRNA expression of GABAA receptor subunits in rat hippocampus. DISCUSSION: Overall, rutin alleviated depressed mood, memory impairment and social impairment in PMDD-depressed subtype rats, which may be related to binding to GABAA receptor benzodiazepine sites, inhibiting chloride ions inward flow, ameliorating hippocampal neuronal damage and reducing GABA and ACh levels. The results of this study provide an experimental basis and scientific evidence for the development of new drugs for the treatment of PMDD."

Rutin, a natural flavonoid with antioxidant activities, has been studied for its potential involvement in mitigating ZEA-induced apoptosis in porcine endometrial stromal cells (ESCs) and its potential molecular mechanism, particularly concerning the expression of Nrf2. This study investigates the molecular pathways by which rutin alleviates ZEA-induced ESC apoptosis, focusing on the role of Nrf2. Experimental data reveal that ZEA suppresses Nrf2 nuclear translocation and reduces mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), leading to oxidative stress, endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS), and mitochondrial pathway-driven apoptosis. Notably, rutin mitigates ZEA-induced apoptosis through Nrf2 activation. These findings highlight Nrf2 as a critical factor in rutin's protective effects against ZEA-induced apoptosis, offering valuable insights for the clinical prevention and treatment of ZEA toxicity.",

This approach aims to associate the advantages of hydrogels for topical administration of drugs and of lipid micelles that mimic skin composition for the delivery of poorly water-soluble compounds in combination therapy. Biomimetic micelles composed of L-α-phosphatidylcholine loaded with two distinct polyphenols (one non-flavonoid and one flavonoid) were produced using hot shear homogenisation followed by the ultrasonication method. All developed micelles were dispersed in a carbomer 940-based hydrogel to obtain three distinct semi-solid formulations, which were then characterised by analysing the thermal, rheological and textural properties. Olive pomace-based hydrogels were also produced to contain the same micelles as an alternative to respond to the needs of zero waste and circular economy. The thermograms showed no changes in the typical profiles of micelles when loaded into the hydrogels. The rheological analysis confirmed that the produced hydrogels achieved the ideal properties of a semi-solid product for topical administration. The viscosity values of the hydrogels loaded with olive pomace (hydrogels A) proved to be lower than the hydrogels without olive pomace (hydrogels B), with this ingredient having a considerable effect in reducing the viscosity of the final formulation, yet without compromising the firmness and cohesiveness of the gels. The texture analysis of both hydrogels A and B also exhibited the typical behaviour expected of a semi-solid system."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Obesity and high fasting blood glucose (FBG) resulting from high-fat diets (HFDs) have emerged as significant public health concerns, garnering increasing attention. Recently, gut microbiota has been linked with metabolic diseases such as type 2 diabetes (T2DM), and its mediating role in dietary supplements has been confirmed. Seeking various dietary supplements to lose body weight (BW) and decrease FBG and explaining the underlying mechanism have become the research hotspots in T2DM studies. METHODS: In this study, rutin and proanthocyanidins (PA) were selected as dietary supplements (200 mg/kg × day, oral gavage, 6 weeks) in T2DM mice induced with HFD to assess their efficacy in weight loss, FBG reduction, gut microbiota alterations, and the associated underlying mechanisms. RESULTS: Our findings indicate that rutin was more effective than PA in relieving inflammation and fat hypertrophy, although both significantly reduced BW and FBG within 2 weeks after the intervention. Analysis of 16S rRNA amplicons revealed substantial alterations in the gut microbial community composition of mice administered with PA and rutin compared to HFD-fed mice. Importantly, several core microbes, particularly a series of probiotics, such as Akkermansia, Lactococcus, Odoribacter, Faecalibaculum, and Roseburia were identified, which were significantly correlated with the changes in BW and FBG. CONCLUSION: Overall, our study highlights that rutin and PA can reduce BW, FBG, and inflammation by modulating the gut microbiota composition, providing novel perspectives for managing and treating weight and FBG concerns in obesity and T2DM patients through dietary supplements in clinical treatment."

Nanotechnology represents one of the utmost promising scientific technologies of the 21st century. Nanocarriers could be the key to unlocking its potential by encapsulating Rutin in targeted drug delivery systems, potentially for targeted Rheumatoid arthritis therapy. OBJECTIVE: The rationale of current research is to prepare liposomes loaded with a bioflavonoid drug rutin for effective management of rheumatoid arthritis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study investigated the formulation of rutin liposomes using the thinfilm hydration technique, also known as the Bangham method. A Box-Behnken design was employed to optimize the formulation parameters. The LP2 batch was then characterized for its mean particle size, zeta potential, shape, diffraction pattern, and thermal properties. Finally, the in-vitro anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory potential of the rutin liposomes were evaluated using appropriate assays. RESULTS: Out of thirteen batches, LP2 was found to be an optimized batch with a mean particle size of 167.1 nm, zeta potential -13.50 mV, and entrapment efficiency of 61.22%. The above results showed higher stability of rutin liposomes. Further characterization of LP2 for morphological assessment, XRD analysis, and DSC revealed its spherical shape less than 1 μm, polycrystalline nature, and thermographic peak at 139°C, respectively. Evaluation of the antioxidant properties and antiinflammatory potential of LP2 revealed its maximum therapeutic potential in the reduction of inflammation and protein denaturation when evaluated via in-vitro assays. CONCLUSION: Rutin liposomal formulation has tremendous potential for the management of Rheumatoid arthritis due to its enhanced bioavailability, anti-oxidant, and anti-inflammatory properties when compared to free rutin."

The present study focused on screening for synergistic antibacterial combinations containing rutin, and further explored the mechanisms behind this synergy. In vitro antibacterial test results of rutin showed that the ranges of minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and Minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) are 0.125-1 and 0.125-2 mg/mL, respectively. However, rutin and amikacin have a significant synergistic effect, with a fractional inhibitory concentration index (FICI) range of 0.1875-0.5. The time bactericidal curve proved that the combination of rutin and amikacin inhibited bacterial growth within 8 h. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) revealed that a low-dose combination treatment could disrupt the cell membrane of Escherichia coli (E. coli). A comprehensive analysis using alkaline phosphatase (AKP), K+, and a protein leakage assay revealed that co-treatment destroyed the cell membrane of E. coli, resulting in the significant leakage of AKP, intracellular K+, and proteins. Moreover, confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) and red-green cell ratio analysis indicated severe damage to the E. coli cell membrane following the co-treatment of rutin and amikacin.

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: In our quest to identify potent inhibitors against SARS-CoV-2, an extensive investigation was conducted for the binding and inhibitory efficacy of Rutin against nine SARS-CoV-2 proteins. METHOD: The first step of our analysis involved a comprehensive examination of structural similarity among the co-crystallized ligands associated with those proteins. A substantial structural similarity was observed between Rutin and Remdesivir, the ligand of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). This similarity was validated through a flexible alignment study. Molecular docking studies, involving superimposition, revealed a notable resemblance in the mode of binding between Rutin and Remdesivir inside the active site of the RdRp. A 200 ns molecular dynamics (MD) simulation confirmed that the RdRp-Rutin complex is more stable than the RdRp-Remdesivir complex. RESULT: The MM-GBSA studies showed that Rutin had much more favorable binding energies, with a significantly lower value of -7.76 kcal/mol compared to Remdesivir's -2.15 kcal/mol. This indicates that the RdRp-Rutin binding is more robust and stable PLIP and ProLIF studies helped clarify the 3D binding interactions and confirmed the stable binding seen in MD simulations. PCAT gave more insights into the dynamic behavior of the RdRp-Rutin complex. in vitro tests showed that Rutin has a strong inhibitory effect on RdRp with an IC50 of 60.09 nM, significantly outperforming Remdesivir, which has an IC50 of 24.56 µM. Remarkably, against SARS-CoV-2, Rutin showed a superior in vitro IC50 of 0.598 µg/ml compared to Remdesivir (12.47 µg/ml). CONCLUSION: The values of the selectivity index underscored the exceptional margin of safety of Rutin (SI: 1078) compared to Remdesivir (SI: 5.8). In conclusion, our comprehensive analysis indicates Rutin's promising potential as a potent SARS-CoV-2 RdRp inhibitor, providing a valuable insight for developing an effective COVID-19 treatment."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Flavonoids including quercetin, kaempferol, myricetin, rutin etc. have always been a part of traditional Chinese medicine for the treatment of several ailments. Rutin (RT), also known as rutoside, sophorin is one of the flavanol glycoside having structure resemblance with quercetin. It is found to exhibit several biological activities viz. anti-inflammatory, anticancer, antioxidant, cardioprotective, antidepressant, neuroprotective etc. but the mechanisms by which it exhibits these effects is still under research. AIM: The protective effects of rutin against drug induced nephropathy have already been discovered. Therefore, in this study, the main focus is to explore the mechanism by which rutin provides protection against drug-induced nephropathy using modern method like network pharmacology and molecular docking. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Genes linked to drug-induced nephropathy and targets connected with rutin were obtained by searching through a number of extensive databases, including David software, Venn plot database, Swiss target prediction database, String database, Gene card & OMIM database, and Pubchem. In order to locate mapping targets, the acquired targets were examined and intersected. A protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was then built to find potential targets. RESULTS: From the KEGG pathway, the target pathway responsible for drug-induced nephropathy were found to be XDH, HSD17B2, MET, PRKCB, CD38, ALDH2, CDK1, PTK2, CYP19A1, TNF, F2, PTGS2, ESR1, GSK3B, GLO1, ALOX12, MMP3, PRKCZ, CXCR1, CA4, EGFR, PDE5A, F10, AKR1B1, DRD4, TERT, CA3, PLG, TP53, PRKCH, PIK3R1, PRKACA, CYP1B1, ALOX5, PLK1, CHEK1, KCNH2, PRKCD, MAPT, MPO, NOX4, AVPR2, ACHE, MCL1, KDR, ABCG2, CCR1, PIK3CG, FLT3, ADORA1, IL2, SYK, IGF1R, CA2, SERPINE1, INSR, PRKCA, APP, MMP9. From these identified targets, the 14 selected pathways which have major role in providing protection in drug-induced nephropathy have been discussed. CONCLUSION: As RT can inhibit various metabolic and proinflammatory pathways involved, it can help in prevention and treatment of drug-induced nephropathy. FUTURE ASPECTS: The revelation of mode of action of bioactive constituent rutin against drug-induced nephropathy provides a theoretical basis for designing more promising compounds in future for treatment of nephropathy.",

This work investigates the anticancer properties of rutin-conjugated zinc oxide nanoparticles (Rut-ZnO NPs) against CML cells. Physicochemical properties of the NPs were studied by FT-IR, FE-SEM, XRD, zeta potential, and DLS analyses. The MTT, flow cytometry, and quantitative PCR assays were utilized to evaluate cell viability, apoptosis, and Bax/Bcl-2 ratio, respectively. The ZnO-Rut NPs were amorphous with an average size of 59.50 nm, and hydrodynamic size and zeta potential were 161.7nm and -34.3 mV, respectively. The ZnO-Rut NPs showed good cytocompatibility as the viability of peripheral blood mononuclear cells remained above 85% at concentrations up to 100 μg/mL. ZnO-Rut NPs reduced the viability of K562 cells from 92 to 31% at exposure concentrations from 3.125 to 400 μg/mL. The IC50 values for rutin, ZnO NPs, and ZnO-Rutin NPs against K562 cells were 501.8, 386.3, and 175.9 μg/mL, respectively. Following the exposure to ZnO-Rutin NPs, the percentage of early apoptosis increased slightly from 10.5% to 14.1%, and a significant increase (from 11% to 50.9%) in late apoptosis was observed. The mRNA level of the Bax elevated to 1.98 folds, and the Bcl-2 gene was downregulated to 0.33 folds, underscoring the mechanism by which ZnO-Rutin NPs promote apoptosis. This study highlights the efficient anticancer potential of ZnO-Rutin NPs against CML cells, providing the basis for further investigations into their clinical applicability and underlying mechanisms of action."

However, there have been no studies investigating the influences of roasting on the effects of these materials against bacteria. Therefore our study was performed to examine the alterations that this process would induce in SJ buds' antibacterial properties. Fresh buds were subjected to hot air drying or different roasting methods, as described in Materia Medica, including yellow-, dark yellow-, scorched-, and charred-roasting conditions. Antibacterial effects, total polyphenol and flavonoid contents, antioxidant activities, as well as rutin and quercetin concentrations in methanol extracts obtained from those materials, were then measured and compared. The results showed that dark yellow-roasted SJ buds exerted the strongest antibacterial and antioxidant activities and were also the richest in polyphenol contents. Analysis of rutin and quercetin revealed that, following the increment in heating temperatures up to 240 °C, the reduction in rutin content occurred in a parallel manner to the increment in quercetin content. However, overheating at 300 °C reduced both concentrations. Among the five tested samples, dark yellow-roasted SJ had the highest amounts of quercetin. Furthermore, the comparison of rutin and quercetin in antibacterial effects and antioxidant activities showed that the latter was significantly stronger in both of these functions, suggesting that the increment in quercetin content as a result of heat treatment was responsible, at least in part, for the potentiation of the two therapeutic effects."

This enzyme plays a crucial role in cell wall synthesis, nucleotide biosynthesis and amino acid synthesis in M tb. Any hindrance to these may affect the growth and survival of the organism. Phytochemicals were systematically screened for potential inhibitors to MtPrsA. Subsequently, based on molecular docking studies, three compounds, namely, hesperidin, rebaudiosideA and rutin were selected. The binding stabilities of these compounds were analyzed using molecular dynamics simulation. Based on the RMSD score obtained, the binding stability of the compounds was confirmed. To validate the findings, an enzyme inhibition assay was done using recombinant MtPrsA. Ligation Independent Cloning (LIC cloning) method was used to produce recombinant His-tagged MtPrsA, followed by purification using Histrap columns. Enzyme kinetic studies unveiled the distinct modes of inhibition exhibited by each compound towards MtPrsA. RebaudiosideA and rutin emerged as competitive inhibitors, while hesperidin showcased a mixed inhibition profile. In conclusion, the study contributes valuable insights into potential therapeutic strategies for TB, through the exploration of alternative enzyme targets and the identification of phytochemical inhibitors. Notably, todate, no effective plant compounds have been reported as inhibitors to MtPrsA."

      "abstract": "Total resection of glioblastoma (GB) tumors is nearly impossible, and systemic administration of temozolomide (TMZ) is often inadequate. This study presents a hybrid layered composite nanofiber mesh (LHN) designed for localized treatment in GB tumor bed. The LHN, consisting of polyvinyl alcohol and core-shell polylactic acid layers, was loaded with TMZ and rutin. In vitro analysis revealed that LHNTMZ and LHNrutin decelerated epithelial-mesenchymal transition and growth of stem-like cells, while the combination, LHNTMZ +rutin, significantly reduced sphere size compared to untreated and LHNTMZ-treated cells (P < 0.0001). In an orthotopic C6-induced GB rat model, LHNTMZ +rutin therapy demonstrated a more pronounced tumor-reducing effect than LHNTMZ alone. Tumor volume, assessed by magnetic resonance imaging, was significantly reduced in LHNTMZ +rutin-treated rats compared to untreated controls. Structural changes in tumor mitochondria, reduced membrane potential, and decreased PARP expression indicated the activation of apoptotic pathways in tumor cells, which was further confirmed by a reduction in PHH3, indicating decreased mitotic activity of tumor cells. Additionally, the local application of LHNs in the GB model mitigated aggressive tumor features without causing local tissue inflammation or adverse systemic effects. This was evidenced by a decrease in the angiogenesis marker CD31, the absence of inflammation or necrosis in H&E staining of the cerebellum, increased production of IFN-γ, decreased levels of interleukin-4 in splenic T cells, and lower serum AST levels. Our findings collectively indicate that LHNTMZ +rutin is a promising biocompatible model for the local treatment of GB."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Although clinical strategies for diabetic nephropathy (DN) therapy include stringent blood pressure control through blockade of the renin-angiotensin system and management of hyperglycemia, the condition is still observed to progress relentlessly. PURPOSE: To elucidate the protective effects of rutin on podocytes in db/db mice with integrative approach of network pharmacology and experimental verification. METHODS: The study employs network pharmacology to identify common targets between rutin and DN, constructs a potential protein-protein interaction (PPI) network, and conducts Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis. Molecular docking is utilized to evaluate the interaction between rutin and protein targets. Additionally, experimental validation is performed using db/db mice and human podocyte cell models. RESULTS: Rutin has been found to have a significant renoprotective effect, reducing blood glucose, proteinuria, and improving renal function in db/db mice. Rutin's inhibition of Src kinase reduces the phosphorylation levels of EGFR and ERK, which may mitigate podocyte injury. Additionally, rutin exhibits antioxidant properties, capable of lowering the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in kidney tissue and increasing the activity of antioxidant enzymes like superoxide dismutase (SOD). These effects help protect podocytes from oxidative stress, further supporting the potential application of rutin in the treatment of DN. CONCLUSIONS: The inhibition of rutin on Src kinase blocks high glucose-induced EGFR/ERK transactivation and protects podocyte injury in DN, indicating it might serve as a promising therapeutic agent for podocyte-targeted therapies.",

The nanogel's pH-responsive behavior and its potential as a targeted drug delivery platform are investigated. The gamma irradiation-induced crosslinking mechanism is elucidated, highlighting its role in creating a stable three-dimensional network structure within the polymer matrix. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy analysis sheds light on the molecular interactions within rutin and the nanogel-rutin complex. The pH-responsive behavior of the nanogel is explored, showcasing its ability to release rutin selectively in response to pH variations and displaying high physical and chemical stability. Transmission electron microscopy imaging provides visual insights into nanogel morphology and interactions. The cumulative drug content from the nanogel was 86.14 ± 2.61%. The pH-dependent release profile of the nanogel was examined, demonstrating selective rutin release in response to varying pH levels. Cytotoxicity studies were conducted against four human cancer cell lines-HepG2, A549, MCF-7, and HCT-116 showing significant reductions in IC50 values, indicating enhanced therapeutic efficacy. Additionally, molecular docking studies revealed strong binding interactions of rutin with VEGFR-2 and EGFRT790M. Our nanogel compound 5 significantly reduced the IC50 values for HepG2, A549, MCF-7, and HCT-116 cells by 58.19%, 81.29%, 71.81%, and 67.16%, respectively. Furthermore, it lowered the IC50 values for VEGFR-2 and EGFRT790M by 29.66% and 68.18%, respectively.",

Acrylamide (ACR) is a toxic substance widely found in human life that can induce neurotoxicity. Some studies have confirmed that neurotoxicity caused by ACR induces myelin damage, which in turn causes neurological dysfunction. Therefore, we established a rutin intervention model to investigate the protective effect of Rut on ACR-induced sciatic nerve injury in rats and its mechanism. The results showed that superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity and glutathione (GSH) content increased and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity decreased in the middle and high dose groups of Rut compared with the ACR group, and the expression of Myelin basic protein (MBP), Extracellular-regulated kinase 1/2(ERK1/2), Phosphorylated extracellular regulated kinase 1/2 (P-ERK1/2), and Nuclear factor E-2-associated factor (Nrf2) was promoted in the Rut-protected group, which suggests that Rutin has a protective effect on ACR-induced sciatic nerve injury and that the mechanism of Rutin's protective effect is related to activation of the ERK1/2 pathway and alleviation of oxidative stress injury.",

      "abstract": "Rutin is a flavonoid compound with potential for treating Alzheimer's disease, preventing brain damage, mitigating cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury, and exhibiting anti-glioblastoma activity. However, its efficacy is limited by its low solubility, poor bioavailability, and limited permeability across the blood-brain barrier (BBB). To enhance the bioavailability and brain-targeting ability of Rutin, transferrin-modified Rutin liposome (Tf-Rutin-Lip) was developed using liposomes as a delivery system. Rutin liposomes were prepared using the thin-film dispersion method, and the preparation conditions were optimized using the response surface methodology. Then, transferrin (Tf) was incorporated into the liposomes through covalent modification, yielding Tf-Rutin liposomes. The toxicity of these liposomes on bEnd.3 cells, as well as their impact on the tight junctions of these cells, was rigorously evaluated. Additionally, in vitro and in vivo experiments were conducted to validate the brain-targeting efficacy of the Tf-Rutin liposomes. A susceptible detection method was developed to characterize the pharmacokinetics of Tf-Rutin-Lip further. The optimized conditions for the preparation of Tf-Rutin-Lip were determined as follows: a lipid-to-cholesterol ratio of 4.63:1, a drug-to-lipid ratio of 1:45.84, a preparation temperature of 42.7 °C, a hydration volume of 20 mL, a sonication time of 10 min, a surfactant concentration of 80 mg/mL, a DSPE-MPEG-2000 concentration of 5%, and a DSPE-PEG2000-COOH to DSPE-MPEG-2000 molar ratio of 10%. The liposomes did not affect the cell activity of bEnd.3 cells at 24 h and did not disrupt the tight junction of the blood-brain barrier. Tf-modified liposomes were taken up by bEnd.3 cells, which, in turn, passed through the BBB, thus improving liposomal brain targeting. Furthermore, the results of pharmacokinetic experiments showed that the Cmax, AUC0-∞, AUC0-t, MRT0-∞, and t1/2 of Tf-Rutin-Lip increased 1.99-fold, 2.77-fold, 2.58-fold, 1.26-fold, and 1.19-fold compared to those of free Rutin solution, respectively. These findings suggest that Tf-Rutin-Lip is brain-targeted and may enhance the efficacy of Rutin in the treatment of brain disorders.",

Loss of function in NPC1 mutants trigger the accumulation of cholesterol in late endo-lysosomes and lysosomal dysfunction. The current study examined the potential of polyphenol-rich methanol extracts from Rosa canina L. (RCME) and two of its components, rutin and quercitrin, to enhance protein trafficking of NPC1 and restore cholesterol levels in fibroblasts derived from NPC patients, in comparison with miglustat, a drug approved in Europe for NPC treatment. Interestingly, RCME improved the trafficking of the compound heterozygous mutant NPC1I1061T/P887L, homozygous mutant NPC1R1266Q, and heterozygous mutant NPC1N1156S between the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi and significantly reduced the levels of cellular cholesterol in the cell lines examined. Miglustat did not affect the trafficking of the three NPC1 mutants individually nor in combination with RCME. Markedly, rutin and quercitrin exerted their effects on cholesterol, but not in the trafficking pathway of NPC1, indicating that other components in RCME are implicated in regulating the trafficking of NPC1 mutants. By virtue of its dual function in targeting the trafficking of mutants of NPC1 as well as the cholesterol contents, RCME is more beneficial than available drugs that target substrate reduction and should be therefore considered in further studies for its feasibility as a therapeutic agent for NPC patients.",

      "abstract": "Sucrose is a vital ingredient in numerous food items consumed regularly. However, exposure to excessive sucrose for a prolonged period can promote health issues. The reproductive system has a delicate physiology that can be targeted by various chemical stressors, including sucrose. Hence, the present in vivo study aims to unveil the impacts of High-Sucrose Diet (HSD) on the reproductive fitness of Drosophila melanogaster. In addition, the present work has also assessed the protective potential of a bioactive compound, rutin, against it. Here, first instar larvae were exposed to HSD (30 %) alone and in combination with rutin (100-300 µM) till their adult stage. HSD disturbed sex comb morphology in adult males, while fecundity and hatchability of eggs in females. Moreover, HSD triggered gonadal ROS production, oxidative stress, and modulated endogenous antioxidants such as SOD, catalase, and glutathione in both sexes. Nuclear fragmentation and tissue injuries, along with protein and lipid oxidation, were also apparent. Elevated levels of cytosolic Iron suggested an active Fenton reaction in adults. Further, HSD modulated the activities of reproductive and metabolic mediators, including vitellogenin, malate dehydrogenase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, and angiotensin-converting enzymes that are critical to maintain the overall reproductive fitness. Interestingly, co-treatment with rutin, mainly at 200 µM, mitigated these adverse effects and restored reproductive fitness. The protective potential of rutin might be attributed to its ability to normalize redox homeostasis, reduce oxidative stress, and optimize critical enzymes involved in reproductive physiology. These findings suggest that rutin has potential therapeutic implications for counteracting the reproductive hazards induced by HSD.",

Plant biomarkers suffer low bioavailability and solubility that lack clinical effectiveness. The smart nanoparticles conversion addresses this limitation with optimal particle size and targeted drug delivery. The present study involves QbD approach for formulation of Rutin silver nanoparticles and evaluation of antioxidant, anticancer and anticlastogenic potential. QbD experimentation involved particle size and drug release as dependent variables over the silver nitrate concentration, methanol and sonication time as independent variables devising 15 formulations (F1 -F15). F12 formulation was found to be optimized with 126.3 nm average size, stable and dispersible characterized by UV, FTIR, SEM and DLS studies. The calibration curve of Rutin was plotted at 352 nm with linearity (LOD = 0.061 μg/ml and LOQ = 0.187 μg/ml). The invitro drug release studies by USP dissolution apparatus I (Basket type) proved the sustained release characteristics with 97.3 % drug release when compared to the Rutin. The pharmacological screening for potential antioxidant and anticancer activity on G361 and MCF 7 cell line of F12 formulation have shown promising results and also enhanced solubility in water compared to Rutin. Anticalstogenic potential as a function of induced micronuclei frequency was evaluated as a characteristic feature in bone marrow cells obtained from mice. Results indicate pre-treatment with the F12 reduced frequency of micronuclei in mouse bone marrow cells caused by Cyclophosphamide (CP) significantly. The protective effect of F12 in suppression was demonstrated at both dosages of 100 and 200 mg/kg. Thus the findings suggest the novel Rutin silver nanoparticles as lead drug serving as antioxidant, anticancer and anticlastogenic agent."

This study aimed to evaluate whether rutin hydrate (RH) has neuroprotective effects in an AD-like learning and memory impairment rat model induced by scopolamine (SCO). Methods: The rats were administered with RH (100 mg/kg) and SCO (1.5 mg/kg) and underwent behavioral tests, including the Morris water maze test, Y-maze test, and passive avoidance test, to evaluate their learning and memory abilities. Additionally, long-term potentiation (LTP) was induced to observe changes in the field excitatory postsynaptic potential (fEPSP) activity. Results: RH treatment attenuated the SCO-induced shortening of step-through latency in the passive avoidance (PA) test, increased the percentage of alternation in the Y-maze, and increased the time spent in the target zone in the Morris water maze (MWM). Moreover, RH increased the total activity of fEPSP following theta burst stimulation and attenuated the SCO-induced blockade of fEPSP. RH also ameliorated the SCO-induced decrease in the expression levels of the BDNF, TrkB, ERK, CREB, and Bcl-2 proteins and the increase in the Bax protein level in the rat hippocampus. This demonstrates that RH has beneficial neuroprotective effects in the brain, improving learning, memory, and synaptic plasticity in rats. Conclusions: Our results highlight the molecular and cellular mechanisms through which RH exerts its neuroprotective effects in the prevention and treatment of learning and memory deficit disorders. RH could potentially be used as a therapeutic strategy for the restoration of learning and memory function and the prevention of the progression of AD."

      "abstract": "Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory autoimmune disease characterized by inflammation, joint pain, and cartilage degradation. The fluctuating nature of RA often necessitates long-term oral administration of treatment drugs, which can unfortunately lead to adverse effects such as gastrointestinal discomfort and hepatic and renal dysfunction. Therefore, a percutaneous local delivery method for the release of inflammatory modulators in arthritic joints represents a promising therapeutic approach for RA. In this study, we have developed a unique and innovative therapeutic platform (named BP-Rut@Gel). This hydrogel was formulated by incorporating the drug Rutin (Rut) into Black phosphorus nanosheets (BP) and subsequently integrating them within a Hyaluronic Acid (HA) and Polyvinyl Alcohol (PVA) matrix to create a composite hydrogel. Notably, Secondly, photothermal therapy (PTT) under Near-Infrared Irradiation (NIR) and anti-inflammatory drugs synergistically worked together to efficiently quell inflammation and enhance therapeutic effectiveness. Additionally, toxicity experiments have revealed that our synthesized black phosphorus nanosheet composite hydrogel possesses excellent biocompatibility and significantly reduces the inflammatory response in RA joints. Given these remarkable properties, our BP-Rut@Gel hydrogel held significant promise and demonstrated immense clinical potential for the treatment of RA."

      "abstract": "Nutritional supplementation enriched with protein and antioxidants has been demonstrated to effectively strengthen skeletal muscle function and mitigate the risk of sarcopenia. Dietary protein has also been a common carrier to establish bioactive delivery system. Therefore, in this study, a Pickering emulsion delivery system for rutin was constructed with whey protein, and its structural characteristics, bioaccessibility, and molecular interactions were investigated. In the in vivo study, zebrafish (n = 10 in each group), which have a high genetic homology to humans, were treated with dexamethasone to induce sarcopenia symptoms and were administered with rutin, whey protein and the Pickering emulsion, respectively, for muscle movement ability evaluation, and zebrafish treated with or without dexamethasone was used as the model and the control groups, respectively. Results showed that the Pickering emulsion was homogeneous in particle size with a rutin encapsulation rate of 71.16 ± 0.15% and loading efficiency of 44.48 ± 0.11%. Rutin in the Pickering emulsion exhibited a significantly higher bioaccessibility than the free form. The interaction forces between rutin and the two components of whey proteins (α-LA and β-LG) were mainly van der Waals forces and hydrogen bonds. After treatment for 96 h, the zebrafish in Picking emulsion groups showed a significantly increased high-speed movement time and frequency, an increased level of ATP, prolonged peripheral motor nerve length, and normalized muscular histological structure compared with those of the model group (p < 0.05). The results of this study developed a new strategy for rutin utilization and provide scientific evidence for sarcopenia prevention with a food-derived resource.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the potential therapeutic efficacy of rutin in the management of psoriasis and elucidate its underlying molecular mechanisms. METHODS: A systems biology approach, utilizing network pharmacology, was employed to identify and analyze putative targets of rutin relevant to psoriasis. The impact of rutin on the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) scores was assessed in an imiquimod (IMQ)-induced murine psoriasis model. Histopathological alterations in the skin lesions were examined using hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining. Expression levels of key inflammatory mediators, including Tnf, Hif1a, Ptgs2, Tlr4, Nfkb1, Mtor, and Il2, were quantified using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). RESULTS: A comprehensive analysis revealed 62 potential targets of rutin in the context of psoriasis, with these targets being part of 72 interconnected signaling pathways. In vivo studies demonstrated a significant reduction in PASI scores in rutin-treated mice compared to those in the control group. Additionally, rutin treatment was associated with marked improvements in skin lesions, characterized by reduced crust formation and epidermal thickness. qRT-PCR analysis indicated that rutin administration downregulated the mRNA expression of Tnf, Hif1a, Ptgs2, Tlr4, Nfkb1, Mtor, and Il2 in the lesional skin. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that rutin holds promise as a therapeutic agent for psoriasis, as it effectively ameliorates IMQ-induced psoriasis-like skin inflammation in mice through modulation of multiple signaling pathways and inflammatory mediators."

In this regard, we illustrated the synthesis of iron oxide/N-doped reduced graphene oxide (Fe2O3/N-rGO) nanocomposites through a one-step thermal treatment of iron phthalocyanine (FePc), melamine, and graphene oxide for electrochemical sensing. The large specific surface area and good conductivity of N-rGO can efficiently capture rutin molecules and accelerate electron transport, thereby improving the electrochemical performance. Moreover, the Fe2O3 nanoparticles with distinct electronic characteristics significantly enhanced the detection sensitivity of the constructed electrochemical platform. Because of the outstanding electrical conductivity, an extensive surface area, and synergistic catalysis, Fe2O3/N-rGO was employed as an advanced electrode modifier to build an electrochemical sensing platform for rutin detection. Significantly, the manufactured sensor showed a broad detection range from 7 nM to 150 μM and a high sensitivity of 5632 μA mM-1. Furthermore, the fabricated sensor showed desirable results in terms of stability, selectivity, and practical application. This work presents a facile method to prepare Fe2O3/N-rGO and supplies a valuable example for building metal oxide/graphene nanocomposites for electrochemical analysis."

This study aimed to prepare rutin-loaded chitosan nanoparticles (Rut-CS NPs) and assess their antibacterial activity against pathogenic strains of S. aureus. RESULTS: The synthesized Rut-CS NPs exhibited an amorphous morphology with a size ranging from 160 to 240 nm and a zeta potential of 37.3 mV. Rut-CS NPs demonstrated significant antibacterial activity against S. aureus strains. Following exposure to Rut-CS NPs, the production of staphyloxanthin pigment decreased by 43.31-89.63%, leading to increased susceptibility of S. aureus to hydrogen peroxide. Additionally, visual inspection of cell morphology indicated changes in membrane integrity and permeability upon Rut-CS NPs exposure, leading to a substantial increase (107.07-191.08%) in cytoplasmic DNA leakage in the strains. Furthermore, ½ MIC of Rut-CS NPs effectively inhibited the biofilm formation (22.5-37.5%) and hemolytic activity (69-82.59%) in the S. aureus strains. CONCLUSIONS: Our study showcases that Rut-CS NPs can serve as a novel treatment agent to combat S. aureus infections by altering cell morphology and inhibiting virulence factors of S. aureus.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory skin disease that can cause systemic inflammation in various organs. Rutin has been suggested to fight psoriasis, but the signaling pathways by which it works need to be explored. MATERIALS AND METHODS: HaCaT cells co-stimulated with interleukin (IL)-17, IL-22, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), IL-1α, and oncostatin M (M5) were used as an in vitro cell model of psoriasis. The proliferation and viability of HaCaT cells were determined by 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine and cell counting assays. Relative mRNA levels of IL-6, TNF-α, chemokines (CXCL1 and CXCL2), and anti-microbial peptides (S100A7 and S100A8) were detected by reverse transcriptase-quantitative PCR. Release of IL-6 and TNF-α from HaCaT cells was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Keratin1, Keratin5, p-JAK2, and p-STAT3 protein levels were estimated with western blotting. Molecular docking predicted binding sites for Rutin and STAT3. RESULTS: Rutin treatment undercut M5-urged viability increase and proliferation boost in HaCaT cells. Moreover, M5 stimulation mediated upregulation of IL-6, TNF-α, CXCL1, CXCL2, S100A7, and S100A8 was partially reversed after Rutin treatment. In addition, M5 stimulation induced downregulation of Keratin1 and Keratin5 proteins as well as upregulation of p-JAK2 and p-STAT3 proteins were attenuated in response to Rutin treatment, manifesting that Rutin treatment inhibited M5-promoted aberrant differentiation and impaired M5-mediated activation of the JAK2/STAT3 signaling in HaCaT cells. Molecular docking discovered that residues GLN326 and ASP334 in STAT3 might bind to Rutin. CONCLUSION: Rutin treatment blocked the JAK2/STAT3 signaling, thus attenuating psoriasis-related inflammation and anomalous differentiation in keratinocytes.",

      "abstract": "The global incidence of metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) has been steadily increasing, making it a leading chronic liver disease. MAFLD refers to a metabolic syndrome linked with type 2 diabetes mellitus, obesity. However, its pathophysiology is complex, there are currently no effective and approved medicines for therapy. Rutin, a naturally occurring polyphenolic flavonoid, is widely distributed in fruits, vegetables, and other plants. It exhibits a plethora of bioactive properties, such as antioxidant, anticancer, and anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective activities, making it an extremely promising phytochemical. Rutin has shown great potential in the treatment of a wide variety of metabolic diseases and received considerable attention in recent years. Fortuitously, various research studies have validated rutin's extensive biological functions in treating metabolic disorders. Despite the fact that the exact pathophysiological mechanisms through which rutin has a hepatoprotective effect on MAFLD are still not fully elucidated. This review comprehensively outlines rutin's multifaceted preventive and therapeutic effects in MAFLD, including the modulation of lipid metabolism, reduction of insulin resistance, diminution of inflammation and oxidative stress, combatting of obesity, and influence on intestinal flora. This paper details the known molecular targets and pathways of rutin in MAFLD pathogenesis. It endeavored to provide new ideas for treating MAFLD and accelerating its translation from bench to bedside.",

Disease activity index (DAI) and hematoxylin-eosin staining were employed to assess therapeutic effect of Rutin on dextran sulfate sodium-stimulated mice. The proliferation was detected by 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide assay. Oxidative stress (OS) was assessed by measuring reactive oxygen species (ROS), malondialdehyde (MDA), and superoxide dismutase (SOD). Inflammatory factors were detected using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and immunofluorescence staining. mRNA and protein expressions were detected by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction and immunoblotting assay. Rutin decreased DAI scores and ameliorated pathological damage in UC mice with decreased levels of inflammatory factors. Rutin recovered the inhibited proliferation of fetal human colon cells caused by lipopolysaccharide. Rutin inhibited OS by reducing ROS and MDA, while enhancing SOD activity in LPS-induced fetal human colon cells. Rutin inhibited NLRP3 inflammasome in UC mice and cell model. Silencing NLRP3 enhanced the inhibitory effect of Rutin on OS in lipopolysaccharide-induced fetal human colon cells. Conversely, NLRP3 overexpression reversed the restraining role of Rutin in OS. Rutin ameliorates UC by inhibiting inflammation and OS through suppressing NLRP3 inflammasome.",

      "abstract": "Polyphenols are a group of naturally occurring compounds that have intriguing biological activities. Among these compounds is rutin, a polyphenolic flavanol found in many plants, including passion flowers, buckwheat seed, fruits and fruit rinds, and citrus fruits (such as orange, grapefruit, lemon, and lime). Various studies have demonstrated rutin to possess antibacterial, antifungal, antiallergic, anti-inflammatory, anti-diabetic, anti-adipogenic, anti-carcinogenic, anti-apoptotic, anti-osteoporotic, radioprotective, gastroprotective, neuroprotective, and nephroprotective activities. Despite its benefits, rutin's therapeutic applicability is severely limited due to its low water solubility, sensitivity to oxidation, and dissolving rate. However, these problems can be overcome by employing an efficient delivery approach. An extensive number of nanocarriers can be developed for medicinal use if pre-clinical as well as human-clinical studies are completed. The current review presents an overview of effective rutin nano-formulations for targeted therapy in various health disorders. This review article discusses the clinical evidence, current status, as well as future opportunities of rutin nanocarriers for increasing rutin's bioactivity for possible medicinal uses."

METHODS: Four experimental groups were divided into control group, rutin group: treated with 100 mg/kg/day rutin orally for 10 days, acetic acid (AA) group: given intracolonic instillation of AA to induce ulcerative colitis, and acetic acid with rutin treatment (AA/Rutin) group. RESULTS: Acetic acid caused a marked increase in the colon weight/length ratio and induced colonic histopathological changes, leading to a marked rise in the colonic histopathological scores. Acetic acid exhibited a significant rise in LDH and CRP serum levels as well as TOS colonic levels, accompanied by a marked decline in TAS colonic contents compared to the control group. Moreover, AA-induced activation of the HMGB1/TLR4/MYD88/NF-kB signaling pathway. Rutin demonstrated a significant decrease in the colon weight/length ratio, ameliorated the colonic histopathological changes induced by AA, and exhibited a marked decline in the colonic histopathological scores. Rutin showed a significant decrease in serum LDH, and CRP levels as well as colonic TOS contents when compared with the AA group. Rutin suppressed the colonic activation of the HMGB1/TLR4/MYD88/NF-kB signaling pathway. CONCLUSION: Rutin could be a promising coloprotective agent against AA-induced ulcerative colitis by targeting the HMGB1/TLR4/MYD88/NF-kB signaling pathway."

This study was focused on effect of rutin against immunoglobulin A (IgA) nephropathy. METHODS: IgA nephropathy was induced in Sprague-Dawley rats with various inducing agents described in text. During the later part of the induction phase, rutin was administered. Control group rats did not receive any treatment or inducing agent, induced group rats received only the inducing agents, whereas treatment group received the inducing agents as well as rutin. RESULTS: During the study, various biochemical parameters pertaining to kidney function were evaluated and also, the expression of proteins and cytokines responsible for inflammation and fibrosis were assessed. The effect of rutin in IgA nephropathy was promising as treatment with rutin reduced the deposition of IgA in the glomeruli of rats. Along with this we also tried to establish the probable mechanism of action of rutin and based on the summary of the results it was concluded that rutin reduced the inflammation and fibrosis related to IgA nephropathy by inhibiting the TGF-β/SMAD pathways and ultimately reducing the expression of α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA). CONCLUSION: Comprehending all the above consideration, it may be safely said that that rutin alleviated inflammation and also fibrosis mediated by IgA, by suppressing the transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) activities through suppressor of mothers against decapentaplegic pathways and reduced the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition by downregulating the α-SMA which is a marker for fibrosis.",

      "abstract": "Lead (Pb) is harmful to almost all organs, particularly the developmental neural system, and previous studies revealed oxidative stress played an important role in Pb neurotoxicity. Rutin, a type of flavonoid glycoside found in various plants and fruits, is widely used as a dietary supplement due to its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, but whether rutin could protect against Pb neurotoxicity is unclear. In this study, we found rutin treatment significantly alleviated Pb-induced cell death, oxidative stress, and inflammation, resulting in cell survival. Moreover, rutin treatment promoted nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) translocation from cytoplasm to nucleus and subsequently activated antioxidant and detoxifying enzymes expression including HO-1. Knocking down Nrf2 by siRNA transfection abolished this protection of rutin against Pb. Overall, rutin could alleviate Pb-induced oxidative stress, inflammation, and cell death by activating the Nrf2/antioxidant response elements (ARE) system.",

      "abstract": "This work examines the capacity of Naringin and Rutin to influence the DNA damage response (DDR) pathway by investigating their interactions with key DDR proteins, including PARP-1, ATM, ATR, CHK1, and WEE1. Through a combination of in silico molecular docking and in vitro evaluations, we investigated the cytotoxic and genotoxic effects of these compounds on MDA-MB-231 cells, comparing them to normal human fibroblast cells (2DD) and quiescent fibroblast cells (QFC). The research found that Naringin and Rutin had strong affinities for DDR pathway proteins, indicating their capacity to specifically regulate DDR pathways in cancer cells. Both compounds exhibited preferential cytotoxicity towards cancer cells while preserving the vitality of normal 2DD fibroblast cells, as demonstrated by cytotoxicity experiments conducted at a dose of 10 µM. The comet experiments performed particularly on QFC cells provide valuable information on the genotoxic impact of Naringin and Rutin, highlighting the targeted initiation of DNA damage in cancer cells. The need to use precise cell models to appropriately evaluate toxicity and genotoxicity is emphasized by this discrepancy. In addition, ADMET and drug-likeness investigations have emphasized the pharmacological potential of these compounds; however, they have also pointed out the necessity for optimization to improve their therapeutic profiles. The antioxidant capabilities of Naringin and Rutin were assessed using DPPH and free radical scavenging assays at a concentration of 10 µM. The results confirmed that both compounds have a role in reducing oxidative stress, hence enhancing their anticancer effects. Overall, Naringin and Rutin show potential as medicines for modulating the DDR in cancer treatment. They exhibit selective toxicity towards cancer cells while sparing normal cells and possess strong antioxidant properties. This analysis enhances our understanding of the therapeutic uses of natural chemicals in cancer treatment, supporting the need for more research on their mechanisms of action and clinical effectiveness.",

BUS (4 mg kg-1 body weight (b.w) was injected intraperitoneally daily for 4 days. GAL + RUT or GAL + QUE (20 mg kg-1 b. w) was delivered by oral gavage for 52 days. Examination of the testes of BUS-treated rats both biochemically and under light microscopy revealed an increased level of lipid peroxidation, DNA fragmentation, glutathione-S-transferase, lactate dehydrogenase, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase, alkaline phosphatase and acid phosphatase with a concomitant decrease in the level of antioxidants: glutathione, ascorbic acid, superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase and glutathione reductase activities, suggesting testicular injury. Tissue sections confirmed the testicular injury-induced by BUS, including diminished spermatogenesis score index, tubular diameter, gonado-somatic index, testis weight, epithelia thickness and higher percentage of aberrant tubules. GAL + QUE co-administration had better recovery effects than GAL + RUT on the biochemical markers and protected against BUS-induced testicular damage. GAL + QUE treatment regimen has better capacity to maintain the antioxidant capacity of the testes and is more potent at reducing BUS-induced oxidative damage compared to GAL + RUT."

Recently, nitrogen-doped carbon dots (NCDs) have emerged as promising nanocarriers to cross BBB. The primary focus of our study was to evaluate the effectiveness of NCDs for the symptomatic treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). In this study, we developed and characterized NCDs bound to rutin, a flavonoid with known benefits for AD. Despite its benefits, the transportation of rutin via NCDs for AD therapy has not been explored previously. We characterized the particles using FTIR and UV-visible spectroscopy followed by atomic force microscopy. Once the design was optimized and validated, we performed in vivo testing via a hemolytic assay to optimize the dosage. Preliminary in vitro testing was performed in AlCl3-induced rat models of AD whereby a single dose of 10 mg/kg NCDs-rutin was administered intraperitoneally. Interestingly, this single dose of 10 mg/kg NCDs-rutin produced the same behavioral effects as 50 mg/kg rutin administered intraperitoneally for 1 month. Similarly, histological and biomarker profiles (SOD2 and TLR4) also presented significant protective effects of NCDs-rutin against neuronal loss, inflammation, and oxidative stress. Hence, NCDs-rutin are a promising approach for the treatment of neurological diseases.",

      "abstract": "Peptic ulcer is a sore on the stomach lining that results from the erosion of the gastrointestinal tract mucosa due to various influencing factors. Of these, Helicobacter pylori infection and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) stand out as the most prominent causes. This condition poses a significant global health concern due to its widespread impact on individuals worldwide. While various treatment strategies have been employed, including proton pump inhibitors and histamine-2 receptor antagonists, these have notable side effects and limitations. Thus, there is a pressing need for new treatments to address this global health issue. Rutin, a natural flavonoid, exhibits a range of biological activities, including anti-inflammatory, anticancer, and antioxidant properties. This review explores the potential anti-ulcer effect of rutin in experimental models and how rutin can be a better alternative for treating peptic ulcers. We used published literature from different online databases such as PubMed, Google Scholar, and Scopus. This work highlights the abundance of rutin in various natural sources and its potential as a promising option for peptic ulcer treatment. Notably, the anti-inflammatory properties of rutin, which involve inhibiting inflammatory mediators and the COX-2 enzyme, are emphasized. While acknowledging the potential of rutin, it is important to underscore the necessity for further research to fully delineate its therapeutic potential and clinical applicability in managing peptic ulcers and ultimately improving patient outcomes. This review on the anti-ulcer potential of rutin opened a new door for further study in the field of alternative medicine in peptic ulcer management.",

      "abstract": "Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), a crucial enzyme in anaerobic glycolysis, plays a pivotal role in the energy metabolism of tumor cells, positioning it as a promising target for tumor treatment. Rutin, a plant-based flavonoid, offers benefits like antioxidant, antiapoptotic, and antineoplastic effects. This study employed diverse experiments to investigate the inhibitory mechanism of rutin on LDH through a binding perspective. The outcomes revealed that rutin underwent spontaneous binding within the coenzyme binding site of LDH, leading to the formation of a stable binary complex driven by hydrophobic forces, with hydrogen bonds also contributing significantly to sustaining the stability of the LDH-rutin complex. The binding constant (Ka) for the LDH-rutin system was 2.692 ± 0.015 × 104 M-1 at 298 K. Furthermore, rutin induced the alterations in the secondary structure conformation of LDH, characterized by a decrease in α-helix and an increase in antiparallel and parallel β-sheet, and β-turn. Rutin augmented the stability of coenzyme binding to LDH, which could potentially hinder the conversion process among coenzymes. Specifically, Arg98 in the active site loop of LDH provided essential binding energy contribution in the binding process. These outcomes might explain the dose-dependent inhibition of the catalytic activity of LDH by rutin. Interestingly, both the food additives ascorbic acid and tetrahydrocurcumin could reduce the binding stability of LDH and rutin. Meanwhile, these food additives did not produce positive synergism or antagonism on the rutin binding to LDH. Overall, this research could offer a unique insight into the therapeutic potential and medicinal worth of rutin.",

      "abstract": "Ensartinib, an approved ALK inhibitor, is used as a first-line therapy for advanced ALK-positive non-small cell lung cancer in China. However, the hepatotoxicity of ensartinib seriously limits its clinical application and the regulatory mechanism is still elusive. Here, through transcriptome analysis we found that transcriptional activation of TXNIP was the main cause of ensartinib-induced liver dysfunction. A high TXNIP level and abnormal TXNIP translocation severely impaired hepatic function via mitochondrial dysfunction and hepatocyte apoptosis, and TXNIP deficiency attenuated hepatocyte apoptosis under ensartinib treatment. The increase in TXNIP induced by ensartinib is related to AKT inhibition and is mediated by MondoA. Through screening potential TXNIP inhibitors, we found that the natural polyphenolic flavonoid rutin, unlike most reported TXNIP inhibitors can inhibit TXNIP by binding to TXNIP and partially promoting its proteasomal degradation. Further studies showed rutin can attenuate the hepatotoxicity of ensartinib without antagonizing its antitumor effects. Accordingly, we suggest that TXNIP is the key cause of ensartinib-induced hepatotoxicity and rutin is a potential clinically safe and feasible therapeutic strategy for TXNIP intervention.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Liver cancer remains to be one of the leading causes of cancer worldwide. The treatment options face several challenges and nanomaterials have proven to improve the bioavailability of several drug candidates and their applications in nanomedicine. Specifically, chitosan nanoparticles (CNPs) are extremely biodegradable, pose enhanced biocompatibility and are considered safe for use in medicine. METHODS: CNPs were synthesized by ionic gelation, loaded with rutin (rCNPs) and characterized by ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy (UV-Vis), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), dynamic light scattering (DLS) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The rCNPs were tested for their cytotoxic effects on human hepatoma Hep3B cells, and experiments were conducted to determine the mechanism of such effects. Further, the biocompatibility of the rCNPs was tested on L929 fibroblasts, and their hemocompatibility was determined. RESULTS: Initially, UV-vis and FTIR analyses indicated the possible loading of rutin on rCNPs. Further, the rutin load was quantitatively measured using Ultra-Performance Liquid Chromatography (UPLC) and the concentration was 88 µg/mL for 0.22 micron filtered rCNPs. The drug loading capacity (LC%) of the rCNPs was observed to be 13.29 ± 0.68%, and encapsulation efficiency (EE%) was 19.55 ± 1.01%. The drug release was pH-responsive as 88.58% of the drug was released after 24 hrs at the lysosomal pH 5.5, whereas 91.44% of the drug was released at physiological pH 7.4 after 102 hrs. The cytotoxic effects were prominent in 0.22 micron filtered samples of 5 mg/mL rutin precursor. The particle size for the rCNPs at this concentration was 144.1 nm and the polydispersity index (PDI) was 0.244, which is deemed to be ideal for tumor targeting. A zeta potential (ζ-potential) value of 16.4 mV indicated rCNPs with good stability. The IC50 value for the cytotoxic effects of rCNPs on human hepatoma Hep3B cells was 9.7 ± 0.19 μg/mL of rutin load. In addition, the increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and changes in mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) were observed. Gene expression studies indicated that the mechanism for cytotoxic effects of rCNPs on Hep3B cells was due to the activation of Unc-51-like autophagy-activating kinase (ULK1) mediated autophagy and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) signaling besides inhibiting the epithelial-mesenchymal Transition (EMT). In addition, the rCNPs were less toxic on NCTC clone 929 (L929) fibroblasts in comparison to the Hep3B cells and possessed excellent hemocompatibility (less than 2% of hemolysis). CONCLUSION: The synthesized rCNPs were pH-responsive and possessed the physicochemical properties suitable for tumor targeting. The particles were effectively cytotoxic on Hep3B cells in comparison to normal cells and possessed excellent hemocompatibility. The very low hemolytic profile of rCNPs indicates that the drug could be administered intravenously for cancer therapy.",

However, conventional MONs have poor imaging performance due to low T1 relaxivity. Additionally, their lack of tumor-targeting theranostics capabilities and complex synthesis pathways have impeded clinical applications. Rutin (Ru) is an ideal tumor-targeted ligand that targets glucose transporters (GLUTs) overexpressed in various malignant tumors, and exhibits photothermal effects upon chelation with metal ions. Herein, a series of Ru-coated MONs (Ru/MnO2) were synthesized using a straightforward, rapid one-step process. Specifically, Ru/MnO2-5, with the smallest crystal size of approximately 4 nm, exhibits the highest T1 relaxivity (33.3 mM-1s-1 at 1.5 T, surpassing prior MONs) along with notable stability, photothermal efficacy, and tumor-targeting ability. Furthermore, Ru/MnO2-5 shows promise in MRI and photothermal therapy of H22 tumors owing to its superior GLUTs-mediated tumor-targeting capability.",

      "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to construct a rutin-controlled release system on the surface of Ti substrates and investigate its effects on osteogenesis and osseointegration on the surface of implants. The base layer, polyethylenimine (PEI), was immobilised on a titanium substrate. Then, hyaluronic acid (HA)/chitosan (CS)-rutin (RT) multilayer films were assembled on the PEI using layer-by-layer (LBL) assembly technology. We used scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and contact angle measurements to examine all Ti samples. The drug release test of rutin was also carried out to detect the slow-release performance. The osteogenic abilities of the samples were evaluated by experiments on an osteoporosis rat model and MC3T3-E1 cells. The results (SEM, FTIR and contact angle measurements) all confirmed that the PEI substrate layer and HA/CS-RT multilayer film were effectively immobilised on titanium. The drug release test revealed that a rutin controlled release mechanism had been successfully established. Furthermore, thein vitrodata revealed that osteoblasts on the coated titanium matrix had greater adhesion, proliferation, and differentiation capacity than the osteoblasts on the pure titanium surface. When MC3T3-E1 cells were exposed to H2O2-induced oxidative stressin vitro, cell-based tests revealed great tolerance and increased osteogenic potential on HA/CS-RT substrates. We also found that the HA/CS-RT coating significantly increased the new bone mass around the implant. The LBL-deposited HA/CS-RT multilayer coating on the titanium base surface established an excellent rutin-controlled release system, which significantly improved osseointegration and promoted osteogenesis under oxidative stress conditions, suggesting a new implant therapy strategy for patients with osteoporosis.",

Thirty rats were randomly divided into six groups (n = 5). The treatments, metformin (120 mg/kg), rutin (100 mg/kg), vitamin A (43 IU/kg), and a combination of rutin (100 mg/kg) and vitamin A (43 IU/kg) were given to relevant groups of rats along with high-fructose high-fat diet for 42 days. HbA1c, D-lactate, Glyoxylase-1, Hexokinase 2, malondialdehyde (MDA), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), catalase (CAT), nuclear transcription factor-B (NF-κB), interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-8 (IL-8) and histological examinations were performed after 42 days. The docking simulations were conducted using Auto Dock package. The combined effects of rutin and vitamin A in treated rats significantly (p < 0.001) reduced HbA1c, hexokinase 2, and D-lactate levels while preventing cellular damage. The combination dramatically (p < 0.001) decreased MDA, CAT, and GPx in treated rats and decreased the expression of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 andIL-8, as well as the transcription factor NF-κB. The molecular docking investigations revealed that rutin had a strong affinity for several important biomolecules, including as NF-κB, Catalase, MDA, IL-6, hexokinase 2, and GPx. The results propose beneficial impact of rutin and vitamin A as a convincing treatment strategy to treat AGE-related disorders, such as diabetes, autism, alzheimer's, atherosclerosis.",

This is best done by utilizing biocompatible materials in order to complete the healing in a rapid manner, with functional and esthetic outcomes. In this context, the zein protein fulfills the criteria of the ideal wound dressing which include non-toxicity and non-inflammatory stimulation. Zein gels containing rutin were prepared without any chemical refinement or addition of gelling agents in order to obtain a natural formulation characterized by antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties to be proposed for the treatment of burns and sores. In vitro scratch assay showed that the proposed gel formulations promoted cell migration and a rapid gap closure within 24 h (~90 %). In addition, the in vivo activities of rutin-loaded zein gel showed a greater therapeutic efficacy in Wistar rats, with a decrease of the wound area of about 90 % at day 10 with respect to the free form of the bioactive and to DuoDERM®. The evaluation of various markers (TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-10) confirmed the anti-inflammatory effect of the proposed formulation. The results illustrate the feasibility of exploiting the peculiar features of rutin-loaded zein gels for wound-healing purposes.",

Proteomics was used to detect differential proteins in the submandibular glands of normal mice and SS mice. Salivary secretion (SAS) and salivary gland index (SGI) were detected. Oxidative stress and inflammatory cytokine in submandibular glands were detected. The levels of NLRP3, ASC, Caspase-1, IL-1β, and p-NF-κBp65 in submandibular gland tissues and submandibular gland cells of overexpressed calcium-sensing receptor (over-CaR) mice and overexpressed CaR primary submandibular gland cells (over-CaR-PSGs) were detected. In total, 327 differential proteins were identified in the submandibular gland tissues of SS mice compared to control mice. CaR was one of the most differential proteins and significantly increased compared to control mice. Ru could significantly increase SGI and SGI, and inhibit oxidative stress and inflammatory cytokine in submandibular glands. In addition, Ru was shown to further improve SS via regulation of the CaR/NOD-like receptor thermal protein domain associated protein 3 (NLRP3)/nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB) signal pathway. Overexpression of CaR counteracted partial activity of Ru. CaR may be an important target for the treatment of SS. In addition, Ru improved the SS via the CaR/NLRP3/NF-κB signal pathway. This study provides a basis for the treatments for SS.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Vortioxetine (VORTX) is a potent and selective type of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) that is mainly prescribed for treating major depression along with mood disorders as the first drug of choice. Limited previous findings have indicated evidence of liver injury and hepatotoxicity associated with daily VORTX treatment. Rutin (RUT), which is known for its antioxidant properties, has demonstrated several beneficial health actions, including hepatoprotection. Therefore the current study aimed to evaluate and assess the ameliorative effect of RUT against the hepatotoxic actions of daily low and high-dose VORTX administration. METHODS: The experimental design included six groups of rats, each divided equally. Control, rats exposed to RUT (25 mg/kg), rats exposed to VORTX (28 mg/kg), rats exposed to VORTX (28 mg/kg) + RUT (25 mg/kg), rats exposed to VORTX (80 mg/kg), and rats exposed to VORTX (80 mg/kg) + RUT (25 mg/kg). After 30 days from the daily exposure period, assessments were conducted for serum liver enzyme activities, hepatotoxicity biomarkers, liver antioxidant endogenous enzymes, DNA fragmentation, and histopathological studies of liver tissue. RESULTS: Interestingly, the risk of liver damage and hepatotoxicity related to VORTX was attenuated by the daily co-administration of RUT. Significant improvements were observed among all detected liver functions, oxidative stress, and inflammatory biomarkers including aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine transaminase (ALT), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), albumin, malondialdehyde (MDA), superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione (GSH), glutathione S-transferase (GST), total protein, acid phosphatase, N-Acetyl-/β-glucosaminidase (β-NAG), β-Galactosidase (β-Gal), alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), caspase 3, and cytochrom-C along with histopathological studies, compared to the control and sole RUT group. CONCLUSION: Thus, RUT can be considered a potential and effective complementary therapy in preventing hepatotoxicity and liver injury induced by the daily or prolonged administration of VORTX.",

Rutin (RUT) is a natural flavonoid compound recognized for its significant antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and estrogenic properties. The present study aimed to determine the protective role of RUT against ZEN-induced reproductive toxicity in male mice. Twenty-four adult Kunming male mice were divided into four groups: control, RUT (500 mg/kg RUT), ZEN (10 mg/kg ZEN), ZEN + RUT (500 mg/kg RUT + 10 mg/kg ZEN), with six replicates per treatment. The results indicated that RUT mitigated ZEN-induced disruption in spermatogenic cell arrangement, decreased spermatozoa count, and increased sperm mortality in the testes. RUT significantly restored ZEN-induced reduction in T, FSH, LH, and E2 serum levels. Moreover, RUT mitigated ZEN-induced apoptosis by increasing the mRNA expression level of bcl-2, decreasing the mRNA expression level of kiss1-r, and decreasing the protein expression level of caspase 8 in reproductive tissues. These findings indicate the protective role of RUT against ZEN-induced reproductive toxicity in male mice by regulating gonadotropin and testosterone secretions to maintain normal spermatogenesis via the HPG axis, which may provide a new application direction for RUT as a therapeutic agent to mitigate ZEN-induced reproductive toxicity.",

MATERIAL AND METHODS: We used micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) and histologically Hematoxylin&Eosin (H&E) staining methods for evaluation. RESULTS: In the evaluation results, we saw a significant decrease in the brain volume of the tumor group to the control group. The difference in volume between the Rutin treatment group and the control group was not significant. In the brain tissues of the tumor group, numerous degenerated neurons characterized by pericellular/perivascular space expansion, cell swelling, or expansion were detected in the cortex and hippocampus regions. We showed a reduction in the damage rate in the Rutin treated group. CONCLUSION: As a result, Rutin was found to have an anticarcinogenic effect. In addition to the classical histological evaluation, we used a newer method, micro-CT, in our study. We believe that this study has important results both in terms of its originality and adding new information to the literature.",

These conditions are characterized by the dysregulation of multiple molecular signaling pathways and the presence of specific biomarkers such as inflammatory cytokines, indicators of oxidative stress, and components of the renin-angiotensin system. In this review, we systematically collected and collated the relevant information from MEDLINE, EMBASE, ELSEVIER, PUBMED, GOOGLE, WEB OF SCIENCE, and SCOPUS databases. This review was conceived with primary objective of revealing the functions of these biomarkers and signaling pathways in the initiation and progression of diabetic nephropathy and peripheral neuropathy. We also highlighted the potential therapeutic effectiveness of rutin and quercetin, two plant-derived flavonoids known for their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. The findings of our study demonstrated that both flavonoids can regulate important disease-promoting systems, such as inflammation, oxidative stress, and dysregulation of the renin-angiotensin system. Importantly, rutin and quercetin have shown protective benefits against nephropathy and neuropathy in diabetic animal models, suggesting them as potential therapeutic agents. These findings provide a solid foundation for further comprehensive investigations and clinical trials to evaluate the potential of rutin and quercetin in the management of diabetic nephropathy and peripheral neuropathy. This may contribute to the development of more efficient and comprehensive treatment approaches for diabetes-associated complications."

      "abstract": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory neurodegenerative disease of the central nervous system that injures the myelin sheath, provoking progressive axonal degeneration and functional impairments. No efficient therapy is available at present to combat such insults, and hence, novel safe and effective alternatives for MS therapy are extremely required. Rutin (RUT) is a flavonoid that exhibits antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and neuroprotective effects in several brain injuries. The present study evaluated the potential beneficial effects of two doses of RUT in a model of pattern-III lesion of MS, in comparison to the conventional standard drug; dimethyl fumarate (DMF). Demyelination was induced in in male adult C57BL/6 mice by dietary 0.2% (w/w) cuprizone (CPZ) feeding for 6 consecutive weeks. Treated groups received either oral RUT (50 or 100 mg/kg) or DMF (15 mg/kg), along with CPZ feeding, for 6 consecutive weeks. Mice were then tested for behavioral changes, followed by biochemical analyses and histological examinations of the corpus callosum (CC). Results revealed that CPZ caused motor dysfunction, demyelination, and glial activation in demyelinated lesions, as well as significant oxidative stress, and proinflammatory cytokine elevation. Six weeks of RUT treatment significantly improved locomotor activity and motor coordination. Moreover, RUT considerably improved remyelination in the CC of CPZ + RUT-treated mice, as revealed by luxol fast blue staining and transmission electron microscopy. Rutin also significantly attenuated CPZ-induced oxidative stress and inflammation in the CC of tested animals. The effect of RUT100 was obviously more marked than either that of DMF, regarding most of the tested parameters, or even its smaller tested dose. In silico docking revealed that RUT binds tightly within NF-κB at the binding site of the protein-DNA complex, with a good negative score of -6.79 kcal/mol. Also, RUT-Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1) model clarifies the possible inhibition of Keap1-Nrf2 protein-protein interaction. Findings of the current study provide evidence for the protective effect of RUT in CPZ-induced demyelination and behavioral dysfunction in mice, possibly by modulating NF-κB and Nrf2 signaling pathways. The present study may be one of the first to indicate a pro-remyelinating effect for RUT, which might represent a potential additive benefit in treating MS.",

Due to its unique structural features and promising therapeutic potential, CDK6 has emerged as a drug target for designing and developing small-molecule inhibitors for anti-cancer therapeutics and other CDK6-associated diseases. The current study evaluates binding affinity and the inhibitory potential of rutin for CDK6 to develop a proof of concept for rutin as a potent CDK6 inhibitor. Molecular docking and 200 ns all-atom simulations reveal that rutin binds to the active site pocket of CDK6, forming interactions with key residues of the binding pocket. In addition, the CDK6-rutin complex remains stable throughout the simulation trajectory. A high binding constant (Ka = 7.6 × 105M-1) indicates that rutin has a strong affinity for CDK6. Isothermal titration calorimetry has further validated a strong binding of rutin with CDK6 and its spontaneous nature. The kinase activity of CDK6 is significantly inhibited by rutin with an IC50 value of 3.10 μM. Our findings highlight the significant role of rutin in developing potential therapeutic molecules to manage cancer and CDK6-associated diseases via therapeutic targeting of CDK6.",

      "abstract": "Rutin, a phenolic compound, exhibits a diverse range of biological properties, including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antimicrobial effects. In this study, we aimed to investigate the potential of rutin, a naturally occurring plant bioactive molecule, to mitigate the neurotoxic effects induced by aluminum chloride (AlCl3). Over a period of 6 weeks, rats were intraperitoneally injected with AlCl3 at a weekly dose of 60 mg/kg, while rutin treatment was administered orally via gavage at a daily dose of 30 mg/kg. AlCl3 exposure resulted in a significant increase lipid peroxidation (LPO) by 316.24%, nitrate levels by 504.14%, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) levels by 93.82% in brain mitochondria. Additionally, AlCl3 exposure led to a reduction in glutathione levels and the activity of antioxidant enzymes, including superoxide dismutase (SOD) by 19.74%, glutathione peroxidase (GPx) by 44.76%, and catalase by 50.50%. There was also a significant decline in the activity of mitochondrial complex enzymes. In contrast, rutin treatment significantly enhanced the activity of antioxidant enzymes while concurrently reducing lipid peroxidation levels in rats. Specifically, rutin administration exerted a modulatory effect on the inflammatory response triggered by aluminum exposure, effectively suppressing the excessive production of nitrate and TNF-α. These findings highlight the potential of rutin as an effective therapeutic strategy in mitigating and combating neuro-inflammation and oxidative stress associated with aluminum-induced toxicity, thereby effectively restoring mitochondrial function.",

      "abstract": "Lung cancer (LC) represents one of the most prevalent health issues globally and is a leading cause of tumor-related mortality. Despite being one the most attractive compounds of plant origin due to its numerous biological properties, the therapeutic applications of rutin (RUT) are limited by its disadvantageous pharmacokinetics. Thus, the present study aimed to evaluate in vitro the application of two RUT fatty acids bioconjugates, rutin oleate (RUT-O) and rutin linoleate (RUT-L), as potential improved RUT-based chemotherapeutics in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treatment. The results indicate that both compounds lacked cytotoxic potential in EpiAirway™ tissues at concentrations up to 125 µM. However, only RUT-L exerted anti-tumorigenic activity in NCI-H23 NSCLC cells after 24 h of treatment by reducing cell viability (up to 47%), proliferation, and neutral red uptake, causing cell membrane damage and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) leakage, affecting cytoskeletal distribution, inducing cytoplasmic vacuolation, and increasing oxidative stress. The cytopathic effects triggered by RUT-L at 100 and 125 µM are indicators of a non-apoptotic cell death pathway that resembles the characteristics of paraptosis. The novel findings of this study stand as a basis for further investigations on the anti-cancer properties of RUT-L and their underlying mechanisms."

The selected plant is traditionally used for diabetes and cancer. It has several biological properties such as antibacterial, antioxidant and anti-aging. PURPOSE: Thirty-five buckwheat cultivars were obtained from Nepal Agriculture Genetic Resources Centre (NAGRC) Khumaltar, Kathmandu, Nepal, and Kumrek Sikkim. These plant varieties are scientifically evaluated their biological properties. METHODS: Rutin wasfractionated from buckwheat seeds using methanol fraction and analysed for quality by HPLC method. The rutin fraction of the cultivar NGRC03731 a tartary buck wheat and standard rutin was used against Osteosarcoma cell lines (SAOS2) and human gingival fibroblast cells (hGFs) for anticancer activity. The cell viability using rutin fraction and standard rutin treated with SAOS2 cells were assessed by MTT assay. For further research, the best doses (IC-50: 20 g/ml) were applied. By using AO/EtBr dual staining, the effects of Rutin fraction on SAOS2 cell death were analysed. The scratch wound healing assay was used to analyse cell migration. Real-time PCR was used to analyse the pro-/anti-apoptotic gene expression. RESULTS: The seeds with the highest rutin content, NGRC03731 seeds, had 433 mg/100 g of rutin.The rutin fraction treatment and standard rutin significantly reduced cell viability in the MTT assay, and osteosarcoma cells were observed on sensitive to the IC-50 dose at a concentration of 20 g/ml after 24 h.The SAOS2 cells exposed to rutin fraction at 20 g/ml and standard rutin at 10 g/ml exhibited significant morphological alterations, cell shrinkage and decreased cell density, which indicate apoptotic cells.Rutin-fraction treated cells stained with acridine orange/ethidium bromide (AO/EtBr) dual staining cells turned yellow, orange, and red which indicatesto measure apoptosis.The anti-migration potential of rutin fraction, results prevented the migration of SAOS2 cancer cells.Rutin-fraction significantly increased the expression of pro-apoptotic proteinsBad, using real-time PCR analysis (mRNA for Bcl-2 family proteins) resulted Bcl-2's expression is negatively regulated. CONCLUSION: Osteosarcoma (SAOS2) cell lines' proliferation, migration, and ability to proliferate were reduced markedly by rutin fraction and it also causes apoptosis of Osteosarcoma cell lines (SAOS2).",

This work aimed to investigate the possible effect of ALS on the tongue of adult male albino rats and to evaluate the possible protective role of RUT. Forty adult male albino rats were equally divided into four groups: group I (control), group II (RUT): Received RUT 50 mg/kg, group III (ALS): Received ALS 1 mg/kg, group IV (ALS+RUT): Received ALS and RUT with the same doses as pervious groups. The drugs were given once daily for 5 weeks. Tongue specimens were taken and processed for light and scanning electron microscopic inspection. ALS treated group revealed structural changes in the tongue in the form of decrease in the height of the filiform papillae with blunt ends, marked atrophy in some papillae with areas of focal loss, loss of some epithelial cells, pyknotic nuclei and cytoplasmic vacuoles in some epithelial cells. The lamina propria showed inflammatory cellular infiltration with congested blood vessels. Statistically, there were highly significant decrease in the number of proliferating cell nuclear antigen immunopositive cells, area percentage of Bcl-2 immunoexpression and highly significant increase in the collagen content compared to control group. Administration of RUT with ALS minimizes these changes. RUT protected the rat tongue against the histological and immunohistochemical changes induced by ALS through its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties."

Although the utilization of MSCs along with growth factors and scaffolds is a beneficial clinical approach for bone tissue engineering, there is need for improvement on the effectiveness of MSC osteogenesis and differentiation. Rutin is a natural flavonoid and a major component for cell proliferation and bone development. However, studies on the mechanism through which rutin regulates osteogenesis and MSC differentiation are limited. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the effect and mechanisms of rutin on osteogenic differentiation of MSCs. MSCs were extracted from umbilical cords and treated with rutin, followed by the examination of osteogenesis-related markers. Rutin treatment promoted the differentiation of MSCs towards the osteogenic lineage rather than the adipogenic lineage and increased the expression of osteogenic markers. RNA sequencing and bioinformatic analysis indicated that rutin regulated p53, a key gene in regulating the osteogenic differentiation of MSCs. Additionally, cellular experiments showed that rutin-induced decrease in p53 expression increased the formation of extracellular matrix (ECM) by promoting p65 phosphorylation and caspase-3 cleavage. Conclusively, this study demonstrates the importance of rutin in osteogenesis and indicates that rutin possesses potential pharmaceutical application for bone regeneration and bone tissue engineering.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic brought about a new normal, necessitating the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) like face shields, surgical masks, gloves, and goggles. However, prolonged mask-wearing introduced skin-related issues due to changes in the skin's microenvironment, including increased humidity and temperature, as well as pressure on the skin. These factors led to skin deformation, vascular issues, edema, and inflammation, resulting in discomfort and cosmetic concerns. Clinical reports quickly highlighted the consequences of long-term mask use, including increased cases of \"maskne\" (mask-related acne) or mask-wearing related disorders such as rosacea flare-ups, skin-barrier defects, itching, erythema, redness, hyperpigmentation, and lichenification. Some of these issues, like inflammation, oxidative stress, and poor wound healing, could be directly linked to acne-related disorders or skin hypoxia. AIM: To address these problems, researchers turned to rutin, a well-known flavonoid with antioxidant, vasoactive, and anti-inflammatory properties. However, rutin's poor water solubility presented a challenge for cosmetic formulations. To overcome this limitation, a highly water-soluble form of rutin was developed, making it suitable for use at higher concentrations. METHODS: In vitro and ex vivo tests were conducted, as well as an innovative clinical trial including volunteers wearing surgical masks for at least 2 h, to evaluate the biological activity of this soluble rutin on the main skin concerns associated with mask-wearing (inflammation, oxidative stress, skin repair, hyperpigmentation, and skin redness). RESULTS: The in vitro results showed that the active ingredient significantly reduced oxidative stress, improved wound healing, and reduced inflammation. In dark skin explants, the active ingredient significantly reduced melanin content, indicating its lightening activity. This effect was confirmed in the clinical study, where brown spots decreased significantly after 4 days of application. Moreover, measurements on volunteers demonstrated a decrease in skin redness and vascularization after the active ingredient application, indicating inflammation and erythema reduction. Volunteers reported improved skin comfort. CONCLUSION: In summary, the COVID-19 pandemic led to various skin issues associated with mask-wearing. A highly soluble form of rutin was developed, which effectively addressed these concerns by reducing inflammation, oxidative stress, and hyperpigmentation while promoting wound healing. This soluble rutin offers a promising solution for the rapid treatment of maskne-related disorders and other skin problems caused by prolonged mask use.",

RGCs isolated from C57/Bl6 mice were co-cultured with BV2 microglial cells under normal or in vitro oxygen-glucose deprivation and reoxygenation (OGD/R) conditions. Rutin's effects were evaluated by assessing cell viability, apoptosis rates, cytokine levels, microglial polarization markers and JAK/STAT3 phosphorylation levels. The specific target is confirmed through the inhibitory effect of rutin on the respectively activated signaling factors. Furthermore, molecular docking analyses elucidated rutin-JAK1 interactions. OGD/R conditions significantly reduced RGC viability, exacerbated by BV2 co-culture. However, both 1 μM and 5 μM rutin treatment dose-dependently enhanced RGC viability, reduced apoptosis, and suppressed pro-inflammatory cytokine levels. Western blot analysis indicated that rutin promoted the M2 microglial phenotype and suppressed JAK/STAT3 signaling. Notably, rutin selectively inhibited JAK1 phosphorylation without affecting STAT3. Molecular docking highlighted potential interaction sites between rutin and specific JAK1 pseudokinase domain. Rutin exerts neuroprotective effects against retinal I/R injury by promoting M2 microglial polarization, potentially through the selective inhibition of JAK1 phosphorylation within the JAK/STAT3 signaling pathway. These findings provide a foundation for the therapeutic potential of rutin in retinal I/R injuries.",

This study focused on investigating the use of rutin-gallium (Ga)(III) complex-mediated antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT) for the photoinactivation of Enterococcus faecalis biofilm. METHODS: The minimum biofilm eradication concentration of the rutin-Ga(III) complex and the minimum biofilm eradication dose of light-emitting diode against E. faecalis were evaluated. The antimicrobial effect of rutin-Ga(III) complex-mediated aPDT against E. faecalis was assessed. Additionally, the expression of genes associated with E. faecalis virulence, such as ace, gelE, and esp, as well as the production of reactive oxygen species within the cells were evaluated. RESULTS: The minimum biofilm eradication concentration of the rutin-Ga(III) complex was determined to be 25 μmol/L, whereas the minimum biofilm eradication dose of light-emitting diode irradiation was defined as 5 minutes with an energy density of 300-420 J/cm2. Rutin-Ga(III) complex-mediated aPDT demonstrated a significant dose-dependent reduction in the growth of E. faecalis biofilms. Moreover, aPDT led to increased intracellular reactive oxygen species generation in treated E. faecalis cells. Furthermore, the messenger RNA levels of ace, gelE, and esp genes were significantly down-regulated in E. faecalis treated with rutin-Ga(III) complex-mediated aPDT (P < .05). CONCLUSIONS: Rutin-Ga(III) complex-mediated aPDT effectively reduces E. faecalis biofilm growth by disrupting biofilm structure and down-regulating virulence genes. These findings highlight the potential of aPDT with the rutin-Ga(III) complex as an adjuvant therapeutic approach against E. faecalis biofilms.",

Adult male Wistar rats were submitted to stereotaxic injection with 6-hydroxydopamine or saline, and they were untreated or treated with rutin (10 mg/kg) for 14 days. The ileum was collected to analyze tissue reactivity and immunohistochemistry for neurons (HuC/HuD) and enteric glial cells (S100β) in the myenteric plexuses. Behavioral tests demonstrated that treatment with rutin improved the motor capacity of parkinsonian animals and improved intestinal transit without interfering with the cell population; rutin treatment modulated the reactivity of the ileal musculature through muscarinic activation, reducing relaxation through the signaling pathway of nitric oxide donors, and increased the longitudinal contractility of the colon musculature in parkinsonian animals. Rutin revealed modulatory activities on the myenteric plexus, bringing relevant answers regarding the effect of the flavonoid in this system and the potential application of PD adjuvant treatment.",

In the GBM microenvironment, interaction with microglia is associated with the dysregulation of cytokines, chemokines, and miRNAs, contributing to angiogenesis, proliferation, anti-apoptosis, and chemoresistance. The flavonoid rutin can inhibit glioma cell growth associated with microglial activation and production of pro-inflammatory mediators by mechanisms that are still poorly understood. The present study investigated the effect of rutin on viability, regulation of miRNA-125b, and the STAT3 expression in GBM cells, as well as the effects on the modulation of the inflammatory profile and STAT3 expression in microglia during indirect interaction with GBM cells. Human GL15-GBM cells and human C20 microglia were treated or not with rutin for 24 h. Rutin (30-50 μM) significantly reduced the viability of GL15 cells; however, it did not affect the viability of microglia. Rutin (30 μM) significantly reduced the expression of miRNA-125b in the cells and secretome and STAT3 expression. Microglia submitted to the conditioned medium from GBM cells treated with rutin showed reactive morphology associated with reduced expression of IL-6, TNF, and STAT3. These results reiterate the anti-glioma effects of the flavonoid, which may also modulate microglia towards a more responsive anti-tumor phenotype, constituting a promising molecule for adjuvant therapy to GBM."

Rutin is a phytochemical with prominent anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities. There is an information gap on the influence of rutin on AFB1-induced neurotoxicity. This study investigated the influence of rutin on neurobehavioral and biochemical abnormalities in male Wistar rats (six weeks old) orally treated with AFB1 (0.75, and 1.5 mg/kg body weight) or co-administered with rutin (50 mg/kg) for 30 uninterrupted days. Results indicate that AFB1-induced depression-like behavior by Tail Suspension Test (TST) and cognitive impairment by Y-maze was abated following rutin co-administration. Abatement of AFB1-induced decreases in acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity, and increased antioxidant status, by rutin was accompanied by a marked reduction in oxidative stress markers and increased hydrolysis of the purinergic molecules in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus of rats. Additionally, rutin co-treatment abrogated AFB1-mediated elevation of interleukin-6 (IL-6), nitric oxide (NO) levels, and activity of myeloperoxidase (MPO). Correspondingly, rutin co-treatment lowered the activity and immunocontent of immunosuppressive indoleamine 2, 3-dioxygenase (IDO). Further, rutin co-treatment prevented histological injuries in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus. In conclusion, abatement of AFB1-induced neurobehavioral abnormalities by rutin involves the mechanisms of anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and regulation of cholinergic, purinergic, and indoleaminergic pathways in rats.",

      "abstract": "In this investigation, soybean protein isolate-rutin (SPI-RT) complexes were treated using dynamic high-pressure microfluidization (DHPM). The effects of this process on the physicochemical and thermodynamic properties of SPI were investigated at different pressures. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy and fluorescence spectroscopy provided evidence that the SPI structure had been altered. The binding of SPI to RT resulted in a decrease in the percentage of α-helices and random curls as well as an increase in the percentage of β-sheets. In particular, the α-helix content decreased from 29.84 % to 26.46 %, the random curl content decreased from 17.45 % to 15.57 %, and the β-sheet content increased from 25.37 % to 26.53 %. Moreover, fluorescence intensity decreased, and the emission peak of the complex was red-shifted by 6 nm, exposing the internal groups. Based on fluorescence quenching analysis, optimal SPI-RT complexation was achieved after 120-MPa DHPM treatment, and molecular docking analysis verified the interaction between SPI and RT. The minimum particle size, maximum absolute potential, and total phenolic content of the complexes were 78.06 nm, 21.4 mV and 74.35 nmol/mg protein, respectively. Furthermore, laser confocal microscopy revealed that the complex particles had the best microstructure. Non-covalent interactions between the two were confirmed using sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Moreover, the hydrophobicity of the complex particle's surface increased to 16,045 after 120-MPa DHPM treatment. The results of this study suggest that DHPM strongly promotes the improvement of the physicochemical properties of SPI, and provide a theoretical groundwork for further research.",

Rutin is the main monomer of JYG, its therapeutic effect and mechanism on psoriasis need to be further clarified. PURPOSE: To explore the potential mechanisms of rutin on psoriasis through network pharmacology and experiments. METHODS: In vitro, cell viability was determined using the CCK8 assay, and inflammatory factors were identified using RT-qPCR. The hub genes and kernel pathways of action were identified by modular pharmacology analysis. In vivo, a BALB/c mice model of psoriasis was induced by Imiquimod (IMQ). The therapeutic effect and action pathway were detected through Western Blotting, RT-qPCR, histopathologic and immunohistochemical analysis. RESULTS: Rutin inhibited cell proliferation and expression of TNF-α and IL-6 in HaCaT cells. The hub genes include APP, INS, and TNF, while the kernel pathways contain the AGE-RAGE signaling pathway. In IMQ-induced psoriasis-like mice, rutin ameliorated skin lesions and inhibited cell proliferation. Rutin could attenuate inflammation by downregulating the AGE-RAGE signaling pathway. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that rutin can reduce IMQ-induced psoriasis like skin inflammation in mice, and regulation of AGE-RAGE signaling pathway may be one of its potential anti-inflammatory mechanisms. Rutin has a promising therapeutic use for the treatment of psoriasis.",

      "abstract": "As a common plant-derived dietary flavonoid, rutin receives widespread attention because of its good antioxidant bioactivities. Protein kinase Cα (PKCα) is a serine/threonine kinase that is involved in uncountable cellular processes, among which ferroptosis, a novel form of cell death, is triggered by lipid peroxidation and has been reported to be associated with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). But it is still not well appreciated how rutin inhibits ferroptosis in PAH and what function PKCα has in this process. In this study, we first observed whether rutin could prevent PAH by attenuating ferroptosis with a PAH animal model and pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (PASMCs) under hypoxia. Mitochondrial metabolomics and network pharmacology were employed to clarify the metabolic alterations and screen target proteins, and the results showed that PKCα was a vital node in rutin regulating mitochondrial metabolism related to ferroptosis in PAH. Based on molecular docking and multispectral analysis, we found that rutin could directly interact with PKCα through hydrogen bonds, which could induce static quenching, and then influence the secondary structure of PKCα. In conclusion, these findings mainly point to a novel mechanism that rutin protects PAH rats by modifying the structure and altering the activity of PKCα, and thus suppressing ferroptosis. This work reveals that the interaction behaviors between small molecules and bio-macromolecules are a critical factor to develop natural biological active ingredients and gives an insight into the potential applications of flavonoids in health and disease.",

The effects of different concentrations of rutin (0, 12.5, 25, and 50 μg/mL) on locomotor behavior, reproductive rate, and lifespan of C. elegans were determined. For establishing the aging mouse model, D-Gal (200 mg/kg) was subcutaneously injected into the back of mice, and mice were treated with rutin (200 mg/kg). At the end of treatment, memory and motor function was assessed by nest building test, open field test, and Y-maze. Serum and brain tissue were collected from each mouse to examine the ROS, lipofuscin, MDA, GSH-Px, and SOD levels. The results showed that rutin prolonged the lifespan of C. elegans, and increased the number of eggs of C. elegans (p < 0.05). In addition, rutin significantly improved the exercise capacity in mice (p < 0.05) and significantly reduced brain tissue ROS (p < 0.05) and MDA (p < 0.01) levels. Meanwhile, rutin could enhance the activity of SOD (p < 0.05) and GSH-Px (p < 0.01) significantly in the serum and brain. In summary, rutin exhibits anti-senescence capabilities which could be ascribed to its antioxidant activities.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Neuroinflammation following peripheral surgery plays a key role in postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) development and there is no effective therapy to inflammation-mediated cognitive impairment. Recent studies showed that rutin, a natural flavonoid compound, conferred neuroprotection. However, the effects and mechanisms of rutin on cognition of surgical and aged mice and LPS-induced BV2 need deeper exploration. METHODS: The effect of rutin in vivo and vitro were evaluated by Morris water maze test, HE stainin, Golgi-Cox staining, IF, IHC, RT-PCR, Flow Cytometer and Western blotting. In vivo, aged mice were treated with rutin and surgery. In vitro, rutin, Nrf2 knockdown, MAC-1 overexpression and VX765, a caspase-1 inhibitor, were administration on BV2 microglial cells. RESULTS: Surgery led to compensatory increase in nuclear Nrf2 and rutin could further increase it. Neural damage was accompanied with high level in MAC-1, caspase-1-mediated pyroptosis and M1 microglia, while rutin recovered the process. Nrf2 inhibition abolished the effect of rutin with the increase of MAC-1, caspase-1-mediated pyroptosis and M1 microglia. Activation of MAC-1 abrogated protection of rutin by increase in pyroptosis and M1 microglia. Finally, we found that treatment with VX765 improved injury and increased M2 microglia against overexpression of MAC-1. CONCLUSIONS: Our study indicated that rutin may be a potential therapy in POCD and exerted neural protection via Nrf2/ Mac-1/ caspase-1-mediated inflammasome axis to regulate pyroptosis and microglial polarization.",

Rutin (RUTIN) is a natural flavonoid with multiple biological activities, and its use in against kidney damage has been widely studied in recent years. It is not yet known whether rutin protects against kidney damage caused by PFOA. In this study, 30 ICR mice were randomly divided into three groups: CTRL group, PFOA group and PFOA+RUTIN group. The mice were fed continuously by gavage for 28 days. Renal pathological changes were assessed by HE and PASM staining, and serum renal function and lipid indicators were measured. RNA-seq and enrichment analysis using GO, KEGG and PPI to detect differential expression of genes in treatment groups. Kidney tissue protein expression was determined by Western blot. Research has shown that rutin can improve glomerular and tubular structural damage, and increase serum CREA, HDL-C levels and decrease LDH, LDL-C levels. The expression of AQP1 and ACOT1 was up-regulated after rutin treatment. Transcriptomic analysis indicated that PFOA and rutin affect the transcriptional expression of genes related to lipid metabolism and oxidative stress, and may affected by PI3K-Akt, PPAR, NRF2/KEAP1 signaling pathways. In conclusion, rutin ameliorated renal damage caused by PFOA exposure, and this protective effect may be exerted by ameliorating oxidative stress and regulating lipid metabolism.",

Due to long biological half-life, it is accumulated in the body, especially the liver, causing hepatocellular damage. This study was designed to assess the effects of rutin on PFOA-induced liver damage in rats. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Male Wistar rats were exposed to PFOA (10 mg/kg/day) alone, or in combination with different doses of rutin (25, 50, and 100 mg/kg/day) by oral gavage for 4 weeks. RESULTS: PFOA altered the levels of liver enzymes, induced a notable change in the tissue structure of the liver, caused some levels of mitochondrial dysfunction, and increased the expression of pro-apoptotic and pro-inflammatory genes. Co-treatment with rutin mitigated the PFOA-induced elevation of liver enzymes, histopathological defects, oxidative damage, and mitochondrial dysfunction. In addition, rutin declined the stimulatory effects of PFOA on the Bax: Bcl2 ratio and reduced the PFOA-induced gene expression of TNF-α, IL-6, NF-ƙB, and JNK. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest rutin as a protective agent for PFOA-induced liver injury, albeit the protection was partial. Possible mechanisms are inhibition of oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and inflammatory response."

      "abstract": "In developing countries, diarrhoea is a major issue of concern, where consistent use of antibiotics has resulted in several side effects along with development of resistance among pathogens against these antibiotics. Since natural products are becoming the treatment of choice, therefore present investigation involves mechanistic evaluation of antidiarrhoeal potential of Begonia roxburghii and its marker rutin against Shigella flexneri (SF) induced diarrhoea in rats following in vitro, in vivo and in silico protocols. The roots of the plant are used as vegetable in the North East India and are also used traditionally in treating diarrhoea. Phytochemically standardized ethanolic extract of B. roxburghii (EBR) roots and its marker rutin were first subjected to in vitro antibacterial evaluation against SF. Diarrhoea was induced in rats using suspension of SF and various diarrhoeagenic parameters were examined after first, third and fifth day of treatment at 100, 200 and 300 mg/kg, p.o. with EBR and 50 mg/kg, p.o. with rutin respectively. Additionally, density of SF in stools, stool water content, haematological and biochemical parameters, cytokine profiling, ion concentration, histopathology and Na+/K+-ATPase activity were also performed. Molecular docking and dynamics simulation studies of ligand rutin was studied against secreted extracellular protein A (Sep A, PDB: 5J44) from SF and Inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS, PDB: 1DD7) followed by network pharmacology. EBR and rutin demonstrated a potent antibacterial activity against SF and also showed significant recovery from diarrhoea (EBR: 81.29 ± 0.91% and rutin: 75.27 ± 0.89%) in rats after five days of treatment. EBR and rutin also showed significant decline in SF density in stools, decreased cytokine expression, potential antioxidant activity, cellular proliferative nature and recovered ion loss due to enhanced Na+/K+-ATPase activity, which was also supported by histopathology. Rutin showed a very high docking score of -11.61 and -9.98 kcal/mol against iNOS and Sep A respectively and their stable complex was also confirmed through dynamics, while network pharmacology suggested that, rutin is quite capable of modulating the pathways of iNOS and Sep A. Thus, we may presume that rutin played a key role in the observed antidiarrhoeal activity of B. roxburghii against SF induced diarrhoea.",

Subsequently, a mouse model of VILI was established to confirm the effects of rutin on VILI. HE staining showed that rutin alleviated VILI. TUNEL staining showed that rutin reduced apoptosis in the lung tissue of mice with VILI, and the same change was observed in the ratio of Bax/Bcl2. Furthermore, rutin reduced the expression of NLRP3, ASC, Caspase1, IL1β, and IL18 in the lung tissues of mice with VILI. Mechanistically, rutin suppressed the TLR4/NF-κB-P65 pathway, which promoted the M1 to M2 macrophage transition and alleviated inflammation in mice with VILI. Rutin relieved NLRP3 inflammasome activation by regulating M1/M2 macrophage polarization and inhibiting the activation of the TLR4/NF-κB-P65 pathway, resulting in the amelioration of VILI in mice."

      "abstract": "Sunburn is caused by prolonged exposure to ultraviolet (UV) rays from the sun, resulting in redness of the skin as well as tenderness, swelling, and blistering issues. During the healing process, it can cause peeling, irritation, and some long-term effects, including premature aging, pigmentation, and a high risk of skin cancer. Rutin has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects, which could potentially reduce inflammation and soothe sunburned skin. The objective of the current proposal is to develop and create carbopol gel-encased glycerosomes for the treatment of sunburn. The Design of Expert (DoE) technique was used to optimize the proposed formulation and was subjected to various characterization parameters such as nanovesicles size, polydispersity index (PDI), surface charge, entrapment efficiency (EE), and surface morphology. The optimized rutin-loaded glycerosomes (opt-RUT-loaded-GMs) were further characterised for drug release, 2,2-Diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) assay, and confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). The formulation showed sustained release, greater permeation into the skin, and good antioxidant activity. The dermatokinetic study of opt-RUT-loaded-GMs confirms that the Rutin hydrate had better retention in the epidermis as compared to the dermis, owing to its potential for long lasting protection after topical application. It was observed that the prepared formulation was stable, highly safe, and had good sun protection factor (SPF) values that could be used as a suitable option for topical drug administration to maximize the therapeutic efficacy of the drugs."

      "abstract": "Neuroinflammation is prevalent in multiple brain diseases and may also lead to dementia, cognitive impairment, and impaired spatial memory function associated with neurodegenerative diseases. A neuroprotective and antioxidant flavonoid, rutin hydrate (RH), was evaluated for the anti-neuroinflammatory activity mediated by copper sulfate (CuSO4) solution and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in zebrafish. The results showed that 100 mg/L RH significantly reduced the ratio of neutrophil mobility in caudal hematopoietic tissue (CHT) region caused by CuSO4 and the number of neutrophils co-localized with facial peripheral nerves. In the LPS model, RH co-injection significantly diminished neutrophil and macrophage migration. Therefore, RH exhibited a significant rescue effect on both models. In addition, RH treatment remarkably reduced the effects of neuroinflammation on the locomotor ability, expression levels of genes associated with behavioral disorders, and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity. Furthermore, network pharmacology techniques were employed to investigate the potential mechanisms, and the associated genes and enzyme activities were validated in order to elucidate the underlying mechanisms. Network pharmacological analysis and zebrafish model indicated that RH regulated the expressions of NF-κB pathway-related targets (Toll-like receptor 9 (tlr9), nuclear factor kappa B subunit 1 (nfkb1), RELA proto-oncogene (RelA), nitric oxide synthase 2a, inducible (nos2a), tumour necrosis factor alpha-like (tnfα), interleukin 6 (il6), interleukin 1β (il1β), chemokine 8 (cxcl8), and macrophage migration inhibitory factor (mif)) as well as six key factors (arachidonic acid 4 alpha-lipoxygenase (alox4a), arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase a (alox5), prion protein a (prnpa), integrin, beta 2 (itgb2), catalase (CAT), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) enzymes). Through this study, a thorough understanding of the mechanism underlying the therapeutic effects of RH in neuroinflammation has been achieved, thereby establishing a solid foundation for further research on the potential therapeutic applications of RH in neuroinflammatory disorders.",

      "abstract": "Gray mold is a destructive disease caused by Botrytis cinerea, a pervasive plant pathogen, which poses a threat to both tomato growth and postharvest storage. The utilization of induced resistance presents a potential strategy for combating plant pathogenic attacks. ZNC (zhinengcong), an extract derived from the endophytic fungus Paecilomyces variotii, has been discovered to play a vital role in preventing diverse forms of bacterial infections. Nevertheless, the precise mechanism behind its ability to enhance tomato resistance to fungi remains unclear. In this study, we found that the exogenous spraying of ZNC could significantly improve the resistance of tomato plants to B. cinerea. The results of both the metabolomic analysis and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) demonstrated that tomato plants responded to ZNC treatment by accumulating high levels of rutin. Additional transcriptome analysis uncovered that rutin enhances tomato resistance possible by initiating the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MPKs) related genes expression during the initial phase of invasion by B. cinerea. In addition, we also found that rutin might activate plant immunity by eliciting ethylene (ET) and jasmonic acid (JA)-mediated pathways. Therefore, plant immune inducer ZNC and rutin has bright application prospects and high utilization value to control gray mold."

In this study, we developed a nanofiber-based local therapy against GB cells using Oleuropein (OL), and rutin and their combinations with Temozolomide (TMZ). The polylactic acid (PLA) core-shell nanofiber webs were encapsulated with OL (PLAOL), rutin (PLArutin), and TMZ (PLATMZ) by an electrospinning process. A SEM visualized the morphology and the total immersion method determined the release characteristics of PLA webs. Real-time cell tracking analysis for cell growth, dual Acridine Orange/Propidium Iodide staining for cell viability, a scratch wound healing assay for migration capacity, and a sphere formation assay for tumor spheroid aggressiveness were used. All polymeric nanofiber webs had core-shell structures with an average diameter between 133 ± 30.7-139 ± 20.5 nm. All PLA webs promoted apoptotic cell death, suppressed cell migration, and spheres growth (p < 0.0001). PLAOL and PLATMZ suppressed GB cell viability with a controlled release that increased over 120 h, while PLArutin caused rapid cell inhibition (p < 0.0001). Collectively, our findings suggest that core-shell nano-webs could be a novel and effective therapeutic tool for the controlled release of OL and TMZ against recurrent GB cells.",

METHODS: In this trial with a double-blind and controlled design, fifty patients were randomly divided into intervention (n = 25) and control groups (n = 25) and were treated with 1 g of rutin or placebo for three months, respectively. At the baseline and end of the intervention, mean arterial pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR), pulse pressure (PP), systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP and DBP), serum levels of antioxidant enzymes, such as catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and superoxide dismutase (SOD) and quality of life (QOL) parameters, were evaluated. RESULTS: Rutin consumption caused a significant reduction in SBP, DBP, PP, MAP, and HR, with a significant increase in SOD, CAT, and GPx and some QOL parameters (emotional limitations, energy and freshness, mental health, social performance, and general health) compared with baseline (p for all <0.05). Also, the mean changes of emotional limitations, energy and freshness, mental health, and general health (unadjusted p for all <0.05) and GPX and SOD (adjusted p for all <0.05) were significantly higher in the rutin group compared with the placebo group. Although, in the supplement group compared with the placebo group, the mean changes of SBP, DBP, MAP, PP, and HR were significantly lower (adjusted p for all <0.05). CONCLUSION: Rutin consumption improved blood pressure, the levels of antioxidant enzymes, and QOL in patients with T2DM."

Besides, ROS generation of HN5 cells exposed to Rut-Cur-MSNs was evaluated. Several investigations showed that rutin and curcumin have potential effects as anticancer phytochemicals; however, their low aqueous solubility and poor bioavailability limited their applications. The assessment of physicochemical properties and anticancer effect of prepared nanoparticles was the objective of this study. METHODS: The physicochemical properties of produced nanoparticles were evaluated. The toxicity of Rut-Cur-MSNs on HN5 cells was assessed. In addition, the ROS production in cells treated with Rut- Cur-MSNs was assessed compared to control untreated cells. RESULTS: The results showed that Rut-Cur-MSNs have mesoporous structure, nanometer size and negative surface charge. The X-ray diffraction pattern showed that the prepared nanoparticles belong to the family of silicates named MCM-41. The cytotoxicity of Rut-Cur-MSNs at 24 h was significantly higher than that of rutin-loaded MSNs (Rut-MSNs) and curcumin-loaded MSNs (Cur-MSNs) (p<0.05). CONCLUSION: The achieved results recommend that the prepared mesoporous silica nanoparticles containing rutin and curcumin can be a useful nanoformulation for the treatment of cancer. The produced nanomaterial in this study can be helpful for cancer therapy.",

Gut microbiota are hypothesised to underpin these effects. We investigated the effect of rutin supplementation on pancreatic β-cell function measured as C-peptide/glucose ratio, and 16S rRNA gene-based gut microbiota profiles, in a cohort of individuals with overweight plus normoglycaemia or prediabetes. Eighty-seven participants were enrolled, aged 18-65 years with BMI of 23-35 kg/m2. This was a 12-week double-blind randomised controlled trial (RCT), with 3 treatments comprising (i) placebo control, (ii) 500 mg/day encapsulated rutin, and (iii) 500 mg/day rutin-supplemented yoghurt. A 2-h oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was performed at baseline and at the end of the trial, with faecal samples also collected. Compliance with treatment was high (~90%), but rutin in both capsule and dietary format did not alter pancreatic β-cell response to OGTT over 12 weeks. Gut bacterial community composition also did not significantly change, with Firmicutes dominating irrespective of treatment. Fasting plasma glucose negatively correlated with the abundance of the butyrate producer Roseburia inulinivorans, known for its anti-inflammatory capacity. This is the first RCT to investigate postprandial pancreatic β-cell function in response to rutin supplementation.",

      "abstract": "Flavonoids are ubiquitously distributed in plants, showing pleiotropic effects in defense against abiotic and biotic stresses. Although it has been shown that seed priming with flavonoids can enhance plant resistance to abiotic stress, little is known about its potential to enhance plant tolerance to biotic stresses, especially for herbivorous insects. Here, we investigated whether treatment of tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) seeds with rutin improves plant resistance against the whitefly (Bemisia tabaci). Specifically, we measured the effect of rutin seed treatment on tomato seedling vigour, plant growth, feeding behavior and performance of B. tabaci on plants grown from control and rutin-treated seeds, and plant defense responses to B. tabaci attack. We found that seed treatment with different concentrations of rutin (viz 1, 2, 5, 10, and 20 mM) had minimal impact on shoot growth. Furthermore, seed treatment of rutin reduced the developmental rate of nymphs, the fecundity and feeding efficiency of adult females on plants grown from these seeds. The enhanced resistance of tomato against B. tabaci is closely associated with increased flavonoids accumulation, callose deposition and the expression of jasmonic acid (JA)-dependent defense genes. Additionally, callose deposition and expression of JA-dependent genes in tomato plants grown from rutin-treated seeds significantly increased upon B. tabaci infestation. These results suggest that seed treatment with rutin primes tomato resistance against B. tabaci, and are not accompanied by reductions in shoot growth. Defense priming by seed treatments may therefore be suitable for commercial exploitation.",

Male Sprague Dawley rats were rendered diabetic by a single intraperitoneal injection of STZ (50 mg/kg). Rutin and metformin were orally administered to diabetic rats at a dose of 100 mg/kg and 300 mg/kg body weight/day, respectively, for 4 weeks. Plasma analysis was conducted to determine changes in the plasma glucose and lipid levels. Rat aortic ring reactivity in response to endothelium-dependent (acetylcholine, ACh) and endothelium-independent (sodium nitroprusside, SNP) relaxants, and to the α1-adrenergic agonist phenylephrine (PE) were recorded. Histology of pancreas, liver and kidney were evaluated. In results, rutin and metformin alone and in combination has led to significant improvements in blood glucose, cholesterol and triglyceride levels compared to diabetic group. Diabetic aortic rings showed significantly greater contraction in response to PE, and less relaxation in response to ACh and SNP. Treatment with rutin and metformin in combination significantly reduced PE-induced contraction and increased ACh-induced and SNP-induced relaxation in diabetes when compared to rutin or metformin alone. Significant histological improvements were seen with combination therapy. In conclusion, rutin and metformin combination therapy has the most potentiality for restoring blood glucose and lipid level as well as vascular function.",

The developed PEGylated Nano-phytosomes exhibited favorable characteristics in terms of size, charge, and stability. Notably, the anticolonic cancer activity of the Pegylated Nano-phytosomes loaded with oleuropein (IC50=0.14 μM) and rutin (IC50=0.44 μM) surpassed that of pure oleuropein and rutin alone. This outcome highlights the advantageous impact of Nano-phytosomes to augment the anticancer potential of oleuropein and rutin.

      "abstract": "Aging is a major risk factor for most chronic disorders, for which cellular senescence is one of the central hallmarks. Senescent cells develop the pro-inflammatory senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), which significantly contributes to organismal aging and age-related disorders. Development of senotherapeutics, an emerging class of therapeutic agents to target senescent cells, allows to effectively delay aging and alleviate chronic pathologies. Here we report preliminary outputs from screening of a natural medicinal agent (NMA) library for senotherapeutic candidates and validated several agents with prominent potential as senomorphics. Rutin, a phytochemical constituent found in a number of plants, showed remarkable capacity in targeting senescent cells by dampening expression of the full spectrum SASP. Further analysis indicated that rutin restrains the acute stress-associated phenotype (ASAP) by specifically interfering with the interactions of ATM with HIF1α, a master regulator of cellular and systemic homeostasis activated during senescence, and of ATM with TRAF6, part of a key signaling axis supporting the ASAP development toward the SASP. Conditioned media produced by senescent stromal cells enhanced the malignant phenotypes of prostate cancer cells, including in vitro proliferation, migration, invasion, and more importantly, chemoresistance, while rutin remarkably downregulated these gain-of-functions. Although classic chemotherapy reduced tumor progression, the treatment outcome was substantially improved upon combination of a chemotherapeutic agent with rutin. Our study provides a proof of concept for rutin as an emerging natural senomorphic agent, and presents an effective therapeutic avenue for alleviating age-related pathologies including cancer.",

      "abstract": "Flavonoids are secondary metabolites that are non-essential for plant growth or survival, and they also provide numerous health benefits to humans. They are antioxidants that shield plants from the ill effects of ultraviolet light, pests, and diseases. They are beneficial to health for several reasons, including lowering inflammation, boosting cardiovascular health, and lowering cancer risk. This study looked into the physicochemical features of these substances to determine the potential pharmacological pathways involved in their protective actions. Potential targets responsible for the protective effects of quercetin, naringenin, and rutin were identified with SwissADME. The associated biological processes and protein-protein networks were analyzed by using the GeneMANIA, Metascape, and STRING servers. All the flavonoids were predicted to be orally bioavailable, with more than 90% targets as enzymes, including kinases and lyases, and with common targets such as NOS2, CASP3, CASP9, CAT, BCL2, TNF, and HMOX1. TNF was shown to be a major target in over 250 interactions. To extract the \"biological meanings\" from the MCODE networks' constituent parts, a GO enrichment analysis was performed on each one. The most important transcription factors in gene regulation were RELA, NFKB1, PPARG, and SP1. Treatment with quercetin, naringenin, or rutin increased the expression and interaction of the microRNAs' hsa-miR-34a-5p, hsa-miR-30b-5p, hsa-let-7a-5p, and hsa-miR-26a-1-3p. The anticancer effects of hsa-miR-34a-5p have been experimentally confirmed. It also plays a critical role in controlling other cancer-related processes such as cell proliferation, apoptosis, EMT, and metastasis. This study's findings might lead to a deeper comprehension of the mechanisms responsible for flavonoids' protective effects and could present new avenues for exploration.",

      "abstract": "Cerebral ischemic stroke is one of the leading causes of adult disability worldwide. Reperfusion is the only therapeutic option with a lot of side effects. In the current study, we investigated the efficacy of rutin and lithium co-treatment in improving post-stroke neurological outcomes in a transient global cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury rat model. Middle-aged male rats were subjected to transient global cerebral ischemia-reperfusion. NORT and Y-maze were used to assess the cognitive processes. Lipid peroxidation, protein carbonylation, and nitric oxide assays were performed to study oxidative stress. The excitotoxicity index was calculated by HPLC. Real time-PCR and western blotting were performed to study gene and protein expressions. The co-administration of rutin and lithium improved the overall survival, recognition memory, spatial working memory, and neurological score following cerebral ischemia-reperfusion in rats. Further, a marked decrease in malonaldehyde, protein carbonyls, and nitric oxide levels was observed following combined treatment. The mRNA expression of antioxidant (Hmox1 and Nqo1) and pro-inflammatory (Il2, Il6, and Il1β) markers were significantly attenuated in the rutin and lithium co-administrated group. The treatment inhibited the Gsk-3β and maintained a normal pool of the downstream β-catenin and Nrf2 proteins. The results revealed that co-administration of rutin and lithium had a neuroprotective potential, suggesting it to be a viable treatment to overcome post-stroke deaths and neurological complications.",
