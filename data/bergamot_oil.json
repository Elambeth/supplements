      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Due to numerous stressors in intensive care, common psychosocial problems arise in patients. Among these, decreased anxiety and sleep quality are observed. This study aims to determine the effect of lavender and bergamot oil applied by inhalation on anxiety and sleep quality in surgical intensive care unit patients. METHODS: Fifty-four patients hospitalized in the intensive care unit of a hospital in Istanbul, Turkey, were included in this study. They were randomly divided into three groups (Lavender, Bergamot, Control). Intervention groups were exposed to 3 drops of lavender oil or bergamot oil on pillows for 20 min, which were then placed 10 cm away from the patient's head. This intervention was applied for two nights. The patients' sleep quality and anxiety level were evaluated using the \"State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI)\" and \"Richard-Campbell Sleep Scale (RCSS).\" Data were analyzed using Chi-square, independent t-test, One-way ANOVA tests. RESULTS: According to our results, anxiety scores significantly decreased in the lavender and bergamot groups. Sleep quality scores significantly increased (p = <0.001). The control group showed lower sleep quality scores. CONCLUSION: Lavender and bergamot oil inhalation appeared effective in reducing anxiety and improving sleep quality in surgical intensive care unit patients.",

      "abstract": "Background: Bergamot oil (BO) is a photosensitizer that can be used for photodynamic therapy (PDT) of dermatological diseases such as vitiligo. Being an oil, it can be integrated within the lipidic matrix of nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs) as the liquid lipid constituent, hence exhibiting a dual role. Research design and methods: NLCs were prepared with different emulsifiers and coemulsifiers, and the effect of the preparation method and formulation variables on the NLCs' size was elucidated. The prepared NLCs were further characterized for their in vitro release, viscosity, thermal behavior, and in vitro photostability. Furthermore, a preclinical photodynamic study on animal skin was conducted, followed by clinical experimentation on patients with vitiligo. Results: Results showed that BO was successfully incorporated within the NLCs. The selected NLCs formulation was in the nanometer range with a gel consistency, and it provided sustained release of BO for 24 h. NLCs improved the photostability and photodynamic properties of BO, and displayed promising preclinical and clinical results for the topical PDT of vitiligo. Expert Opinion: BO containing NLCs was proven to be promising means for PDT of vitiligo, and can be further explored in other dermatological diseases.",

      "abstract": "The impact of nanomedicine has grown in the current decade; however, only very few clinical translational attempts have been realized. Therefore in the present study, we hypothesized that bergamot oil, a psoralen-containing oil, would produce an optimized melanogenic effect in the clinical treatment of vitiligo when loaded within an elastic nanocarrier (spanlastics) and combined with PUVB for activation of psoralens. Spanlastics were prepared and characterized for particle size, physical stability, in vitro release, thermal behavior, deformability, morphology, and in vitro photostability. The efficacy of the selected formula was tested histopathologically on rat skin and clinically translated in patients suffering from vitiligo. Results revealed that the spanlastics were of reasonable nanosize, deformable, and provided sustained release of bergamot oil. The incorporation of bergamot oil within spanlastics improved its photostability and its photodynamic activity. Spanlastics exhibited promising clinical results in terms of extent and onset of repigmentation in vitiligo patients. Therefore, it can be concluded that spanlastics can be introduced as a promising nanotreatment modality for vitiligo.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Bergamot essential oil (BEO) possesses sedation and anxiolytic properties similar to diazepam. After long period of exposure to stressors, including restrained stress, depressive-like behavior can be produced. BEO has been suggested to reduce depression. However, there is no scientific evidence supporting this property. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of BEO in chronic stressed rats on: 1) behavior related depressive disorder, 2) hypothalamic pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis response, and iii) brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) protein levels in hippocampus. MATERIAL AND METHOD: Male Wistar rats, weighing 200 to 250 g, were induced chronic restrained stress 15 minutes dailyfor two weeks. For the next two weeks, these rats were divided intofour groups, control-i.p., fluoxetine-i.p., control-inhale, and BEO-inhale. Fluoxetine (10 mg/kg i.p.) or saline was intraperitoneally administered daily while 2.5% BEO or saline was inhaled daily. At the end of the treatment, rats were assessed for depressive-like behavior using the forced swimming test (FST). After the behavioral test, the animals were immediately decapitated and trunk blood samples were collected for the measurement ofcorticosterone and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) levels and hippocampus was dissected and stored in afreezer at -80 °C until assay for BDNF protein. RESULTS: BEO andfluoxetine significantly decreased the immobility time in the FST (p < 0.05). Fluoxetine tended to decrease serum corticosterone and significantly (p < 0.05) decreased serum ACTH while BEO had no effect on these two stress hormones. For BDNF protein determination, neither BEO norfluoxetine had any effect on BDNF protein levels in hippocampus compared to their controls. CONCLUSION: The inhalation ofBEO decrease behavior related depressive disorder similar tofluoxetine but has no effect on HPA axis response and BDNF protein levels in chronic restrained stress.",

This study evaluates the effect of the nonvolatile fraction (NVF), the antioxidant component of bergamot essential oil (BEO), on LOX-1 expression and free radical generation in a model of rat angioplasty. Common carotid arteries injured by balloon angioplasty were removed after 14 days for histopathological, biochemical, and immunohistochemical studies. Balloon injury led to a significant restenosis with SMC proliferation and neointima formation, accompanied by increased expression of LOX-1 receptor, malondialdehyde and superoxide formation, and nitrotyrosine staining. Pretreatment of rats with BEO-NVF reduced the neointima proliferation together with free radical formation and LOX-1 expression in a dose-dependent manner. These results suggest that natural antioxidants may be relevant in the treatment of vascular disorders in which proliferation of SMCs and oxyLDL-related endothelial cell dysfunction are involved.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Recently, bergamot oil was shown to be a potent antifungal agent in vitro against clinically important Candida species. In this study, the activities of bergamot natural essence and its furocoumarin-free and distilled extracts on dermatophytes such as Trichophyton, Microsporum and Epidermophyton species were investigated. METHODS: In vitro susceptibility testing assays on 92 clinical isolates of dermatophytes (Trichophyton mentagrophytes n = 20, Trichophyton rubrum n = 18, Trichophyton interdigitale n = 15, Trichophyton tonsurans n = 2, Microsporum canis n = 24, Microsporum gypseum n = 1 and Epidermophyton floccosum n = 12) were performed using the CLSI M38-A broth microdilution method, except for employing an inoculum of 1-3 x 10(3) cfu/mL. MICs were determined at a visual endpoint reading of 80% inhibition compared with the growth control. RESULTS: MICs (v/v) of all fungi ranged from 0.156% to 2.5% for the natural essence, from 0.02% to 2.5% for the distilled extract, and from 0.08% to 1.25% for the furocoumarin-free extract. The three isolates of T. tonsurans and M. gypseum exhibited the highest MIC values. CONCLUSIONS: Data from this study indicate that bergamot oil is active in vitro against several common species of dermatophytes, suggesting its potential use for topical treatment of dermatophytoses.",

      "abstract": "The present study investigated the phototoxic effect of bergamot oil and its photosensitive component, bergapten, on sunburn cell (SBC) production in guinea pig skin. The back skin was pretreated with bergamot oil or bergapten and exposed to monochromatic light under various conditions. After irradiation, skin specimens were excised, and histological sections were prepared. The number of sunburn cells in the interfollicular epidermis was counted. The SBC formation by bergamot oil or bergapten plus UVB radiation was the same as that without pretreatment with any photosensitizer. In contrast, a significant number of SBCs were induced by bergamot oil or bergapten plus UVA radiation, but no SBCs were found after the treatment with UVA alone. The result indicates that bergamot oil or bergapten was photosensitized by UVA irradiation. The SBCs were linearly increased in a UV-dose dependent manner. On the basis of the regression lines, an action spectrum and spectral peak for the photosensitizers plus UVA were obtained. The action spectrum for bergamot oil- and bergapten-induced SBC formation was in the ranges of 325-365 nm and 325-350 nm, and their spectral peaks were at 335-345 nm and 335-350 nm, respectively. The data are in good accordance with those estimated from skin erythema reactions. Therefore, counting SBCs is a very useful parameter for quantitative evaluation of phototoxicity.",

      "abstract": "The skin of the female hairless albino mouse (Skh 1) was used to study the enhancement of solar simulated radiation (SSR) tumorigenesis by 5-methoxypsoralen (5-MOP) in model perfumes that contain bergamot oil. This work was done in association with yeast mutagenicity studies and human skin phototoxicity studies. Analyses of time-to-onset of tumour observation with 5-MOP at 0, 5, 15 and 50 ppm show a highly significant 5-MOP dose effect and the data indicate that 5-MOP has phototumorigenic potential even at 5 ppm. The addition of 0.5% UVB and 0.5% UVA sunscreens significantly reduces the tumorigenicity associated with the vehicle (i.e. 5-MOP at 0 ppm) and 5-MOP at all concentrations. Pairwise comparisons of 5-MOP (at 5 or 15 ppm) plus sunscreens with vehicle plus sunscreens show that the sunscreens afford total protection at the lower 5-MOP concentrations. Additional studies show that a 5-6 h delay between 5-MOP application and SSR exposure defers the time-to-onset of tumours as does intermittent 5-MOP and SSR treatment. A comparison of 5-MOP at 50 ppm in bergamot oil with 5-MOP at 50 ppm prepared from pure 5-MOP crystals shows identical results, indicating that the active phototumorigenic agent in bergamot oil is 5-MOP and not other related compounds, which may be present at greater concentrations. Analyses of tumour histology at death show, in general, similar patterns of malignancy for all groups. Thus although it is possible to delay tumorigenesis by various strategies, the tumours that eventually develop are just as likely to be malignant, if not more so, when compared with non-delayed groups.",

At equal doses of SSR, equal concentrations of 5-MOP alone or 5-MOP in BO have a similar influence on survival and on the induction of cytoplasmic \"petite\" mutations, reverse and forward mutations, mitotic gene conversion and genetically aberrant colonies including mitotic crossing over. No reciprocity is found between SSR dose and 5-MOP concentration for cytotoxic, mutagenic and recombinogenic effects. In the presence of chemical filters (Parsol 1789, a UVA filter, and Parsol MCX, a cinnamate derivative acting as a UVB filter) considerable protection is observed against the induction of genetic effects by 5-MOP and BO containing 5-MOP in haploid and diploid cells. As indicated by the lower induction kinetics, the protection is higher than expected from the light-absorbing properties, suggesting photochemical interaction. The protection is slightly higher for BO than for 5-MOP. The induction of genetic effects by 5-MOP alone or BO containing 5-MOP is independent of oxygen. Experiments on suction blister fluids taken from patients after topical treatment with BO containing 5-MOP indicate that in comparison with water the bioavailability and thus the genotoxic effects of the compounds are decreased. Moreover, in addition to the filtering effect against the photoinduced genotoxic effects of BO, the presence of chemical filters apparently reduces the penetration of BO containing 5-MOP and provides a reduction in biological effectiveness.",
