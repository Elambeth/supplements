      "abstract": "PURPOSE: The purpose of this case was to investigate objectively and quantitatively the effects of the application of repeated focal muscle vibration (fMV) associated with neurocognitive exercise on a 46-year-old patient with spastic paraparesis secondary to the surgical removal of a C5-C6 ependymoma. METHODS: We have evaluated gait parameters, spasticity, and pain with clinical scales. We have applied focal muscle vibration on quadriceps femoris, hamstrings, gastrocnemius, and iliopsoas muscles bilaterally. A total of 30 sessions of fMV treatment of 80 min each was carried out over 30 consecutive days. RESULTS: After the whole treatment period, the patient showed an overall improvement in scores on the same assessment scales administered at admission. The gait analysis evaluation showed a reduction in stride time bilaterally, an increase in average walking speed, increased cadence, and a slight increase in step length. CONCLUSION: The improvements obtained have highlighted the relevance of the fMV application associated to physiotherapy in the field of neurological rehabilitation, particularly emphasizing the interest in increasing the number of sessions correlated with more durable clinical improvements over time. Results obtained have shown to persist for several months after discharge, allowing the patient to improve walking and to have greater autonomy in daily activities."

This meta-analysis aimed to examine the effects of neurocognitive rehabilitation interventions on the cognitive functioning and intellectual performance of pediatric cancer survivors. Four databases were searched until December 15, 2021. RevMan 5.4 was used to analyze the effects of neurocognitive rehabilitation interventions on the cognitive functioning of pediatric cancer survivors. Ten eligible randomized controlled trials were initially identified, and nine of these were included in the meta-analysis. For the working memory outcome, the pooled effect results favored study interventions and had statistical significance at postintervention assessment (Z = 2.24, P = 0.03). For the attention outcome, there were significant statistical differences at postintervention and 3/6-month follow-up assessment (Z = 2.72, P = 0.007 and Z = 10.45, P < 0.001, respectively). For the executive functioning outcome, there were significant statistical differences at postintervention and 3/6-month follow-up assessment (Z = 2.90, P = 0.004 and Z = 14.75, P < 0.001, respectively). For the academic/intellectual performance secondary outcome, the pooled overall effects of study interventions on the academic/intellectual outcome were positive at postintervention and follow-up assessment (Ps < 0.001). No studies reported any adverse events related to neurocognitive and educational interventions. This meta-analysis found that neurocognitive rehabilitation interventions improve the working memory, attention, and executive functioning of pediatric cancer survivors at postintervention and short-term follow-up. Neurocognitive rehabilitation also has positive effects on the academic/intellectual performance of this study population during a vulnerable period in their development.",

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Ninety-six patients, aged 53-88 years, with cognitive impairment of varying degrees are divided into two groups depending on the presence/absence of drug therapy during the neurocognitive rehabilitation program. Assessment of cognitive functions was carried out twice: at the beginning and at the end of the rehabilitation program using international cognitive status assessment scales (MMSE and MoCA). RESULTS: The analysis of the dynamics of cognitive functions revealed the high efficiency of the neurocognitive rehabilitation program in both groups. The results of the study demonstrate insignificant differences in the dynamics of cognitive functions in the two groups, however, a clear direct effect of drug therapy on changes in cognitive functions has not been established. An analysis of the statistical significance of the data did not reveal differences. CONCLUSIONS: The study confirmed the positive dynamics of cognitive functions in the elderly and old people who underwent the neurocognitive rehabilitation program both with the use of drug therapy and without its use. The issue of the need to use drugs in the framework of this program requires further study. The results of the study can be used in planning programs of psychological, medical and social support for the elderly and old people.",

OBJECTIVE: To examine the effect of neurocognitive rehabilitation on upper limb function in community-dwelling chronic stroke patients. METHODS: Eight community-dwelling chronic stroke patients participated in the study. The mean period from the stroke onset to the start of the intervention was 425.3 days (approximately 14 months post-stroke). All patients received neurocognitive rehabilitation for 60 min, twice per week, for 3 months. Fugl-Meyer Assessments (FMA) were performed, and the amount of use (AOU) and quality of movement (QOM) of the Motor Activity Log (MAL) were measured before and after the intervention. We used the Wilcoxon signed-rank test to analyze the data. RESULTS: The total, shoulder/elbow/forearm, and wrist scores of the FMA, MAL-AOU, and MAL-QOM significantly improved after the intervention compared to those before the intervention. However, significant improvement was not observed in the hand score of the FMA.

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Cognitive deficits are frequent after coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery and consequently could lead to a decrease in quality of life. This is the first study that has been conducted with the aim of examining the efficacy of a computerized cognitive rehabilitation therapy (CCRT) in improving quality of life in patients after CABG surgery. METHODS: In this study, an interventional trial with pre-, post-, and follow-up assessments in active (CCRT), active control and control groups was conducted. Seventy-five patients after CABG surgery were selected and assigned to the groups (n = 25 for each group). CCRT consists of four modules of attention, working memory, response inhibition and processing speed training with graded schedule in 20-min sessions three times per week within 8 weeks. Cognitive functions (attention and working memory) were assessed by the tests of continuous performance, Flanker, useful field of view and digit span at three time points: pre- and post-intervention (T0 and T1) and 6-month follow-up (T2). Quality of life was assessed by the SF-36 questionnaire at the same time points. The CCRT group received the cognitive rehabilitation for 2 months, active control group received a sham version of CCRT in an equal time duration and control group did not receive any cognitive intervention. RESULTS: Repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) revealed a time by group interaction on cognitive functions, with CCRT producing a significant improvement at T1 (p < 0.01) and these improvements were maintained at T2. Moreover, in CCRT and active control groups, quality of life (QoL) improved at T1 and these improvements remained stable throughout follow-up (T2). However, improvement of QoL in CCRT group was greater than improvement of QoL in the other two groups at T1. Pearson's correlation analysis shows a positive correlation between QoL improvement and sustained attention and working memory enhancement (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Cognitive rehabilitation can lead to a significant improvement in the cognitive functions that have been trained in patients receiving CABG. Interestingly enough, cognitive rehabilitation can also improve quality of life in patients after CABG surgery and this improvement is maintained for at least 6 months."

      "abstract": "Stroke has significant physical, psychological and social consequences. Recent rehabilitation approaches suggest that cognitive exercises with dual-task (sensory-motor) exercises positively influence the recovery and function of the hemiplegic hand grip. The purpose of this study was to describe a rehabilitation protocol involving the use of a new neurocognitive tool called \"UOVO\" for hand grip recovery after stroke. A 58-year-old right-handed male patient in the chronic stage of stroke, presenting with left-sided hemiparesis and marked motor deficits at the level of the left hand and forearm, was treated with the UOVO, a new rehabilitation instrument based on the neurocognitive rehabilitation theory of Perfetti. The patient was evaluated at T0 (before treatment), T1 (after treatment) and T2 (2 months of follow-up). At T2, the patient showed improvements of motor functions, shoulder, elbow and wrist spasticity, motility and performance. This case report explores the possibility of improving traditional rehabilitation through a neurocognitive approach with a dual-task paradigm (including motor and somato-sensory stimulation), specifically one involving the use of an original rehabilitation aid named UOVO, which lends itself very well to exercises proposed through the use of motor imagery. The results were encouraging and showed improvements in hemiplegic hand grip function and recovery. However, further studies, in the form of randomized controlled trials, will be needed to further explore and confirm our results.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The last 25 years have seen profound changes in neurocognitive rehabilitation that continue to motivate its evolution. Although the concept of nervous system plasticity was discussed by William James (1890), the foundation for experience-based plasticity had not reached the critical empirical mass to seriously impact rehabilitation research until after 1992. The objective of this review is to describe how the emergence of neural plasticity has changed neurocognitive rehabilitation research. METHOD: The important developments included (a) introduction of a widely available tool that could measure brain plasticity (i.e., functional MRI); (b) development of new structural imaging techniques that could define limits of and opportunities for neural plasticity; (c) deployment of noninvasive brain stimulation to leverage neural plasticity for rehabilitation; (d) growth of a literature indicating that exercise has positively impacts neural plasticity, especially for older persons; and (e) enhancement of neural plasticity by creating interventions that generalize beyond the boundaries of treatment activities. Given the massive literature, each of these areas is developed by example. RESULTS: The expanding influence of neural plasticity has provided new models and tools for neurocognitive rehabilitation in neural injuries and disorders, as well as methods for measuring neural plasticity and predicting its limits and opportunities. Early clinical trials have provided very encouraging results. CONCLUSION: Now that neural plasticity has gained a firm foothold, it will continue to influence the evolution of neurocognitive rehabilitation research for the next 25 years and advance rehabilitation for neural injuries and disease.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The theory of Structural Cognitive Modifiability and Mediated Learning Experience of Reuven Feuerstein states that individuals with brain impairment, because of congenital or acquired origin, may substantially and structurally improve their cognitive functioning, by a systematic intervention based on a specific, criteria-based type of interaction (\"mediated learning\"). Three application systems are based on it: a dynamic-interactive assessment of learning capacity and processes of learning, the LPAD (Learning Propensity Assessment Device); a cognitive intervention program called \"Instrumental Enrichment Program\", which trains cognitive, metacognitive and executive functions; and a program, which is oriented at working in context, Shaping Modifying Environments. These programs have been applied in widely different target groups: from children and young adults with learning and developmental disabilities, at risk of school failure, or having failed at school, because of socio-economic disadvantage or congenital neurological impairment; disadvantaged youngsters and adults in vocational training, to elderly people at the beginning of a dementia process. Experience with cognitive rehabilitation of children and adults with acquired brain damage, has been relatively recent, first in the Feuerstein Institute's Brain Injury Unit in Jerusalem, later in other centers in different parts of the world; therefore scientific data are scarce. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this paper is to examine how the Feuerstein-approach fits into the goals and proposed approaches of cognitive rehabilitation, and to explore its relevance for assessment and intervention in individuals with congenital or acquired brain damage. METHODS: The methodology of the Feuerstein approach consists of four pillars: dynamic assessment, cognitive activation, mediated learning and shaping a modifying environment. The criteria of mediated learning experience are explained with specific reference to people with acquired brain injury. The procedure of learning propensity assessment device uses visuo-spatial and verbal tasks known from neuropsychological assessment (such as Rey's complex figure drawing), as well as a in a pre-test - brief intervention - post-test format. Cognitive activation is done in various ways: a paper-and-pencil relatively content-free program called \"instrumental enrichment\", with transfer of learned principles into daily life situations, followed by metacognitive feedback. Four case histories of acquired brain damage are analyzed: a 19 year old man with extensive post-astrocytoma frontotemporal brain lesions; a 19 year old man with bilateral frontal and right temporal and parieto-occipital parenchymatous destruction after a traumatic brain injury; a 24 year old man with hemispherectomy for intractable epilepsy because of Sturge-Weber syndrome; and a 30-year old man with left porencephalic cyst after cerebral hemorrhage. RESULTS: Structural cognitive improvement could be demonstrated in positive change scores in visuo-spatial memory, associative and verbal memory, abstract thinking, and organizing tasks, even more than 10 years post-TBI. In some cases a rise in IQ has been documented. Improvement in daily life functioning and academic skills (re)learning has also been seen. CONCLUSIONS: Though impossible to claim scientific evidence, the case histories nevertheless suggest the importance of interactive assessment in designing intervention programs which have sufficient intensity, frequency, duration and consistency of mediation; furthermore, an essential ingredient is the ecological approach which requires working with the patient and the whole network around; a firm \"belief system\" or that modifiability is possible even with severe brain damage and many years after the injury; a cognitive, metacognitive and executive approach, and a quality of interaction according to criteria of mediated learning. They suggest that Feuerstein approach may offer interesting perspectives to cognitive rehabilitation. More extensive research is needed to provide a broader scientific evidence base.",

      "abstract": "Neurocognitive deficits are common with brain tumors. If assessed at presentation using detailed neurocognitive tests, problems are detected in 80 % of cases. Neurocognition may be affected by the tumor, its treatment, associated medication, mood, fatigue, and insomnia. Interpretation of neurocognitive problems should be considered in the context of these factors. Early post-operative neurocognitive rehabilitation for brain tumor patients will produce rehabilitation outcomes (e.g., quality of life, improved physical function, subjective neurocognition) equivalent to stroke, multiple sclerosis, and head injury, but the effect size and duration of benefit needs further research. In stable patients treated with radiotherapy +/- chemotherapy, the most frequent causes of distress include neurocognitive problems, psychological factors of anxiety, depression, fatigue, and sleep. Exercise, neurocognitive training, neurocognitive behavioral therapy, and medications to treat fatigue, behavior, memory, mood, and removal of drugs that may be associated with neurocognitive side effects (e.g., anti-epileptic drugs) all show promise in helping patients to manage the effects of their neurocognitive impairments better. As these are complex symptoms, multidisciplinary expertise is necessary to evaluate the influence of each variable to plan appropriate support and intervention. Neurocognitive rehabilitation should therefore occur in parallel with disease-centered, medical management from the outset. It should not occur in series, as a restricted phase in a patient's pathway. It should be considered in the pre- and post-operative period where there are good prospects of recovery, as one would for any brain-injured patient, so that the person may reach their optimal physical, sensory, intellectual, psychological, and social functional level. Yet the identification and selection of patients for early neurological rehabilitation and routine evaluation of cognition is uncommon in neurosurgical wards."

      "abstract": "Addiction, as a brain disorder, can be defined with two distinct but interacting components: drug dependency and neurocognitive deficits. Most of the therapeutic interventions in addiction medicine, including pharmacological or psychosocial therapies, that are in clinical use have been mainly focused on directly addressing addictive behaviors, especially drug use and urges to use drugs. In the field of addiction treatment, it is often presumed that drug users' neurocognitive deficits will reverse following abstinence. However, in many cases, neurocognitive deficits are not fully ameliorated following sustained abstinence, and neurocognitive function may further deteriorate in early abstinence. It can be argued that many cognitive functions, such as sustained attention and executive control, are essential for full recovery and long-term abstinence from addiction. Recent advances in cognitive neuroscience have provided scientific foundations for neurocognitive rehabilitation as a means of facilitating recovery from drug addiction. Neurocognitive rehabilitation for drug addicted individuals could be implemented as part of addiction treatment, with highly flexible delivery methods including traditional \"paper and pencil\" testing, or computer-based technology via laptops, web-based, or smartphones in inpatient and outpatient settings. Despite this promise, there has been limited research into the potential efficacy of neurocognitive rehabilitation as a treatment for drug addiction. Further, many questions including the optimum treatment length, session duration, and necessary treatment adherence for treatment efficacy remain to be addressed. In this chapter, we first introduce cognitive rehabilitation as one of the potential areas to bridge the gap between cognitive neuroscience and addiction medicine, followed by an overview of current challenges and future directions.",

      "abstract": "Currently, relapse prevention remains the main challenge in addiction medicine, indicating that the established treatment methods combining psychotherapy with neuropharmacological interventions are not entirely effective. Therefore, there is a push to develop alternatives to psychotherapy- and medication-based approaches to addiction treatment. Two major cognitive factors have been identified that trigger relapse in addicted patients: attentional biases directed toward drug-related cues, which increase the urge to consume, and impaired response inhibition toward these cues, which makes it more difficult for addicted people to resist temptation. Recent studies on newly detoxified alcoholic patients have shown that by using the appropriate tasks to index these cognitive functions with event-related potentials (ERPs), it is possible to discriminate between future relapsers and nonrelapsers. These preliminary data suggest that the ERP technique has great clinical potential for preventing relapse in alcohol-dependent patients, as well as for addictive states in general. Indeed, ERPs may help to identify patients highly vulnerable to relapse and allow the development of individually adapted cognitive rehabilitation programs. The implementation of this combined approach requires an intense collaboration between psychiatry departments, clinical neurophysiology laboratories, and neuropsychological rehabilitation centers. The potential pitfalls and limitations of this approach are also discussed.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Neurocognitive and social cognitive impairments represent important treatment targets in schizophrenia, as they are significant predictors of functional outcome. Different rehabilitative interventions have recently been developed, addressing both cognitive and psychosocial domains. Although promising, results are still heterogeneous and predictors of treatment outcome are not yet identified. In this study we evaluated the efficacy of two newly developed social cognitive interventions, respectively based on the use of videotaped material and comic strips, combined with domain-specific Cognitive Remediation Therapy (CRT). We also analysed possible predictors of training outcome, including basal neurocognitive performance, the degree of cognitive improvement after CRT and psychopathological variables. METHOD: Seventy-five patients with schizophrenia treated with CRT, were randomly assigned to: social cognitive training (SCT) group, Theory of Mind Intervention (ToMI) group, and active control group (ACG). RESULTS: ANOVAs showed that SCT and ToMI groups improved significantly in ToM measures, whereas the ACG did not. We reported no influences of neuropsychological measures and improvement after CRT on changes in ToM. Both paranoid and non-paranoid subjects improved significantly after ToMI and SCT, without differences between groups, despite the better performance in basal ToM found among paranoid patients. In the ACG only non-paranoid patients showed an improvement in non-verbal ToM. CONCLUSION: Results showed that both ToMI and SCT are effective in improving ToM in schizophrenia with no influence of neuropsychological domains. Our data also suggest that paranoid symptoms may discriminate between different types of ToM difficulties in schizophrenia.",

The balance and the risk of falls were determined using the Tinetti Balance and Gait Evaluation Scale. The pain was determined using the Visual Analog Scale and the course of the disease was examined using the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS). Endpoints were before the treatment, at the end of the treatment, and at a 12-week follow-up. The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of neurocognitive rehabilitation in PD with motor imagery. Primary outcome is the improvement in balance and the falls risk reduction; secondary outcome is lower limb pain reduction."

It is assumed that elementary cognitive disorders (attention and encoding) and complex cognitive disorders (recall, concept formation) reinforce each other. Cognitive disorders are supposed to cause detrimental effects on functional outcome. We used cognitive rehabilitation as a strategy to induce cognitive changes in 27 patients assigned to treatment groups following the cognitive modules of the Integrated Psychological Treatment (IPT). Ten schizophrenic patients without cognitive impairments worked as a control group. With only one minor conceptual change (replacing concept formation with executive function, a more comprehensive construct), we found that our data fitted with Brenner's model. A relationship has been found between neuropsychological improvements and higher levels of autonomy and social functioning. These findings have important implications not only for cognitive assessment but also for selecting targets in cognitive rehabilitation.",

      "abstract": "A critical review of randomized, controlled trials of extended programs of neurocognitive rehabilitation for the cognitive deficits characteristic of schizophrenia conducted between the years 2000 to 2002 was completed. Over the past several years, two models of cognitive rehabilitation have emerged. In one model, labeled \"cognitive remediation,\" cognitive deficits are treated directly through repeated practice and acquisition of compensatory strategies on cognitive exercises designed to engage underfunctioning brain systems. In a second model, labeled \"cognitive adaptation,\" neurocognitive deficits are addressed through modification of the patients' environment to allow patients to bypass their deficits. Results revealed that a range of cognitive remediation strategies varying widely along dimensions of duration, intensity, method, target of behavioral intervention, and clinical status of participants produced improvements on measures of working memory, emotion perception, and executive function distinct from those trained during remediation. No effects were evident in secondary verbal or nonverbal memory. Results of two pilot studies using functional magnetic resonance imaging to assess changes in task-evoked brain activation have revealed that these interventions may produce changes in several functionally relevant neural systems in a subset of patients. Results from studies of standardized cognitive adaptation interventions have indicated that these treatments can produce improvements in symptoms, psychosocial status, and relapse rates. A variety of approaches for future research are also discussed.",

Recent studies have demonstrated that although spontaneous recovery may occur during the weeks immediately after ictus, a significant number of patients continue to suffer from this disorder in a chronic manner. The paper describes a rehabilitation programme which has proved to be selectively effective in reducing hemi-inattention in the majority of patients persistently affected by the disorder. The results indicate a) that improvements are not confined to laboratory situations but extend to the patient's day-to-day behaviour in general, and b) that they are still present at a follow-up carried out several months after the end of therapy. Given the dramatic impact of this disorder on adult social relations it is important that rehabilitation centres dedicate time to this particular aspect.",
