      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Pathogenesis of systemic scleroderma is a complex subject. Previous research has emphasized a possible contribution of the intestinal microbiome in developing symptoms. The use of probiotic formulas brings benefit in treatment of various autoimmune diseases, but the evidence for scleroderma is still not exhaustive. No official recommendations have been formulated on this topic, nor has the existing evidence been evaluated. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to assess the efficacy of probiotics, prebiotics, or synbiotics in patients with scleroderma with a focus on the improvement of symptoms and change in the quality of life (QoL) both measured using validated scales, small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) eradication, as well as change in the intensity of interstitial lung disease and occurrence of pulmonary hypertension. METHODS: We performed a systematic search for randomised trials that assessed the beneficial and harmful effects of pro-, syn-, and prebiotics in patients with scleroderma. Pairs of authors independently selected studies for inclusion, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias (RoB) of the included studies. We examined the certainty of evidence in accordance with the GRADE approach. RESULTS: We screened 1,801 references (after the removal of duplicates), and assessed 16 citations in full text. We identified four randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with 103 participants in intervention and 87 in control groups. The evidence suggests that probiotic intake may not affect gastrointestinal symptoms measured with Visual Analogue Scale for Gastrointestinal Tract (VAS-GIT) (change in the VAS-GIT: MD 0.04, 95% CI -0.31 to 0.40, low certainty, n=56 probiotic group, n=57 placebo group) and the evidence is very uncertain about the effect on gastrointestinal symptoms measured with The University of California Los Angeles Scleroderma Clinical Trial Consortium GIT 2.0 instrument (UCLA GIT 2.0) (change in the UCLA GIT 2.0 - total score: MD -0.18 95% CI -0.44, 0.07, very low certainty, n=76 probiotic group, n=74 placebo group). Meta-analysis showed that probiotic intake may slightly improve the social functioning measured with UCLA GIT 2.0 compared to placebo (MD -0.21, 95% CI -0.32 to -0.10, low certainty, n=57 probiotic group, n=53 placebo group), yet may result in little to no difference in physical functioning measured with HAQ-DI (MD 0.08, 95% CI -0.15 to 0.32, low certainty, n=56 probiotic group, n=57 placebo group) and frequency of adverse events, change in QoL and SIBO eradication. We did not find any studies addressing the effect of pro-, pre-, synbiotics on interstitial lung disease or pulmonary hypertension. The certainty of evidence was low to very low mainly due to high RoB (lack of blinding, incomplete reporting) and imprecision. CONCLUSIONS: We were unable to definitively prove a positive or negative effect of probiotic intake in patients with systemic sclerosis. The results should be interpreted with caution due to low or very low certainty of evidence and would need more confirmation from strain and dose specific RCTs at a lower RoB."

      "abstract": "Estrogen receptors (ERs) play a critical role in breast cancer (BC) development and progression, with ERα being oncogenic and ERβ exhibiting tumor-suppressive properties. The interaction between ER signaling and other molecular pathways, such as PI3K/AKT/mTOR, influences tumor growth and endocrine resistance. Emerging research highlights the role of prebiotics in modulating gut microbiota, which may influence estrogen metabolism, immune function, and therapeutic responses in BC. This review explores the impact of prebiotics on estrogen receptor modulation, gut microbiota composition, immune regulation, and metabolic pathways in breast cancer. The potential of prebiotics as adjunctive therapies to enhance treatment efficacy and mitigate chemotherapy-related side effects is discussed. A comprehensive analysis of recent preclinical and clinical studies was conducted, examining the role of prebiotics in gut microbiota modulation, immune regulation, and metabolic reprogramming in breast cancer. The impact of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) derived from prebiotic fermentation on epigenetic regulation and endocrine resistance was also evaluated. Prebiotics were found to modulate the gut microbiota-estrogen axis, reduce inflammation, and influence immune responses. SCFAs demonstrated selective estrogen receptor downregulation and metabolic reprogramming, suppressing tumor growth. Synbiotic interventions mitigate chemotherapy-related side effects, improving the quality of life in breast cancer patients. Prebiotics offer a promising avenue for breast cancer prevention and therapy by modulating estrogen metabolism, immune function, and metabolic pathways. Future clinical trials are needed to validate their efficacy as adjunctive treatments in breast cancer management."

      "abstract": "Small Intestinal Bacterial Overgrowth (SIBO) is a condition marked by an increased proliferation of bacteria in the small intestine. This leads to a range of GI symptoms and nutritional issues. This article examines the preventive and therapeutic roles of nutrition, prebiotics, probiotics, and prokinetics in managing SIBO. Finding the prevalence of SIBO in the general population is challenging due to challenges in diagnosis and different diagnostic methods. Nevertheless, SIBO has been linked to several clinical conditions, such as obesity, celiac disease, irritable bowel syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease, and hepatic cirrhosis. The connection between SIBO and obesity remains controversial and unclear, with contraindicating evidence regarding its prevalence and association with body mass index (BMI). Anatomical changes from surgeries may also contribute to the development of SIBO, and disruptions in the migrating motor complex (MMC) can facilitate intestinal permeability. SIBO can lead to significant malabsorption of nutrients, including carbohydrates, fats, proteins, and iron, resulting in deficiencies and malnourishment. Additionally, increased levels of immunoglobulins observed point toward a possible immune response to bacterial overgrowth. Hence, understanding the prevalence, clinical manifestations, and nutritional impacts of SIBO is crucial for effective prevention and management. This article underscores the potential benefits of nutrition, including prebiotics and probiotics, in modulating gut microbiota and managing SIBO. Furthermore, prokinetics that enhance gastrointestinal motility may offer possible therapeutic advantages in the future. Continued research is necessary to clarify the underlying mechanisms and refine treatment strategies for SIBO."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Studies have suggested that the administration of prebiotics, probiotics and synbiotics (pre-, pro-, and synbiotics) may potentially decrease the incidence of atopic dermatitis (AD) and alleviate its severity in children; however, recent studies have yielded inconclusive findings. OBJECTIVE: This umbrella meta-analysis aimed to comprehensively assess the effect of pre-, pro-, and synbiotics on AD among children. METHODS: A systematic search was carried out in the PubMed and Scopus databases up to April 2024 to identify relevant meta-analyses. Relative risks (RR) and weighted mean differences (WMD) along with their 95% confidence intervals (CI) were pooled using a random effects model to evaluate the impacts on both the incidence of AD and its severity, as assessed by the Scoring Atopic Dermatitis (SCORAD) index. RESULTS: This umbrella meta-analysis included 38 meta-analyses, with 127,150 participants. The analysis suggested that intervention with pre-, pro-, and synbiotics significantly reduced the incidence of AD (RR = 0.74, 95% CI: 0.70-0.79), which was confirmed by subgroup analyses. The treatment significantly reduced SCORAD score (WMD = -3.75, 95% CI: -5.08 to -2.42). In subgroup analysis, multi-strain probiotics, Lactobacillus, synbiotics, and pre-, pro-, and synbiotics mixtures were found to significantly decrease the SCORAD score, while, Bifidobacterium and prebiotics alone did not show a significant effect on the SCORAD score. The treatment resulted in a significant decrease in SCORAD score among children with moderate to severe AD, but not in subjects with mild AD. CONCLUSIONS: Probiotics and synbiotics could be promising interventions to reduce the risk of developing AD and alleviate its severity in children."

      "abstract": "Prebiotics alter microbial communities by supplying carbon to specific bacteria that benefit the host. However, the effect of prebiotics added to the culture water on shrimp production and bacterial composition has not been demonstrated. Therefore, this study evaluated the effects of four prebiotics - short-chain fructooligosaccharide, galactooligosaccharide, inulin, and mannan-oligosaccharide - and two non-prebiotic carbohydrates - sucrose and wheat starch - on shrimp growth, nutrient composition of shrimp muscle and biofloc, biofloc concentration, and bacterial profiles in biofloc and gills, hepatopancreas, and intestine of Penaeus vannamei. Shrimp (6.0 ± 0.5 g) were stocked into 36 tanks (72 shrimp/m2) and raised in a biofloc technology system consisting of two phases: an autotrophic-dominated phase (days 0-4) and a heterotrophic-dominated phase (days 5-26). The prebiotic and non-prebiotic carbohydrates were added to the water at a rate of 3 % of the feed provided. Key findings revealed that adding prebiotics to the water did not affect shrimp growth. Notably, shrimp muscle from the mannan-oligosaccharide treatment exhibited a significantly higher lipid content than that from the galactooligosaccharide treatment (p ≤ 0.05). No significant effect was observed on the nutrient composition of biofloc. Biofloc concentration was lower in the wheat starch treatment (p ≤ 0.05). Finally, the prebiotics altered the bacterial composition of biofloc and shrimp gills, hepatopancreas, and intestine. These results revealed that adding prebiotics to the culture water of a biofloc system has an effect on shrimp quality and microbial communities of biofloc and various shrimp tissues, suggesting their potential benefit on shrimp production and health."

      "abstract": "Background and Objectives: Cystic fibrosis (CF), caused by CFTR gene mutations, primarily affects the respiratory and gastrointestinal systems. Microbiota modulation through probiotics, prebiotics, or synbiotics may help restore microbial diversity and reduce inflammation. This study aimed to evaluate their efficacy in CF. Materials and Methods: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published between 2000 and 2024 was conducted in Cochrane, ScienceDirect, Web of Science, LILAC, BMC, PubMed, and SCOPUS following PRISMA guidelines. Methodological quality was assessed using the Jadad scale, and RevMan 5.4® estimated effects on pulmonary function (FEV1), exacerbations, hospitalizations, quality of life, and inflammatory markers. Results: Thirteen RCTs (n = 552), mostly in pediatric populations, were included. Most examined probiotics (e.g., Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, L. reuteri), while four used synbiotics. Several studies reported reduced fecal calprotectin and proinflammatory interleukins (e.g., IL-6, IL-8), suggesting an anti-inflammatory effect. However, no significant differences were observed regarding hospitalizations or quality of life. Additionally, none of the studies documented serious adverse events associated with the intervention. The meta-analysis showed no significant decrease in exacerbations (RR = 0.81; 95% CI = 0.48-1.37; p = 0.43) or improvements in FEV1 (MD = 4.7; 95% CI = -5.4 to 14.8; p = 0.37), even in subgroup analyses. Sensitivity analyses did not modify the effect of the intervention on pulmonary function or exacerbation frequency, supporting the robustness of the findings. Conclusions: Current evidence suggests that probiotics or synbiotics yield inconsistent clinical benefits in CF, although some reduction in inflammatory markers may occur. Larger, multicenter RCTs with longer follow-up are needed for clearer conclusions. Until more definitive evidence is available, these supplements should be considered experimental adjuncts rather than standard interventions for CF management.",

      "abstract": "Barley malt residue (BMR) was subjected to microwave-assisted enzymatic hydrolysis to evaluate its potential as a raw material to produce xylooligosaccharides (XOS) suitable for use as a prebiotic. The influent factors on XOS production, microwave power, exposure time, and xylanase dosage were ascertained with response surface methodology based on Box-Behnken design (BBD). The fitted models of XOS and xylose yields were in good agreement with the experimental results. Using a microwave power of 1235.1 W, a 6 min exposure time, and a xylanase concentration of 89.12 U/g substrate gave the highest yield of XOS: 208.05 mg/g substrate at 4 h of enzyme incubation time. Based on the product composition, BMR-XOS purification by Saccharomyces cerevisiae treatment was superior to the process of activated carbon adsorption and ethanol precipitation treatment and was selected for further experiments. Thin-Layer Chromatography (TLC) and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) clearly elucidated the oligosaccharide compositions, and the result of Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) confirms the molecular structure and sugar components of achieved BMR-XOS. In vitro fermentation of BMR-XOS obtained from this study by the selected probiotics, Lactococcus lactis TISTR 1401, Levicaseibacillus brevis FS 2.1, Lactobacillus casei TISTR 1463, showed similar prebiotic activity compared with the commercial XOS, galactooligosaccharides (GOS), xylose, and glucose (control). In conclusion, the present study was successful in establishing the use of barley malt residue for the extraction of xylan and XOS, which could be further used as a prebiotic."

The SCIME colonic reactors were inoculated with fecal material from 3 different canine donors. After 2 d of stabilization, the 8-d parallel control/treatment period was initiated; reactors were fed with SCIME nutritional medium with or without test product. Changes in microbial metabolic activity were assessed by measuring levels of acetate, propionate, butyrate, lactate, branched short-chain fatty acids, and ammonium. Changes in microbial community composition were assessed using 16S-targeted Illumina sequencing. Overall, test product supplementation resulted in increased saccharolytic fermentation, as evidenced by increases in the health-promoting bacterial metabolites such as propionate (donor-dependent), acetate, and butyrate (donor-dependent) as well as increased abundances of several saccharolytic fermenting microbes, including Bifidobacterium. Conversely, proteolytic bacteria like Proteobacteria were reduced with the test product compared to control. Repeated supplementation with the test product was therefore able to induce-in vitro-a positive modulation of the microbiome originated from dogs with soft stools.",

This cross-sectional study aims to comprehensively evaluate potential biomarkers in patients with gallstones and assess the effects of microbiome-targeted interventions in mice. Microbiome taxonomic profiling was conducted on 191 samples via V3-V4 16S rRNA sequencing. Next, 60 samples (30 age- and sex-matched CGS patients and 30 controls) were selected for metagenomic sequencing and fecal metabolite profiling via liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Microbiome and metabolite characterizations were performed to identify potential biomarkers for CGS. Eight-week-old male C57BL/6J mice were given a lithogenic diet for 8 weeks to promote gallstone development. The causal relationship was examined through monocolonization in antibiotics-treated mice. The effects of short-chain fatty acids such as sodium butyrate, sodium acetate (NaA), sodium propionate, and fructooligosaccharides (FOS) on lithogenic diet-induced gallstones were investigated in mice. Gut microbiota and metabolites exhibited distinct characteristics, and selected biomarkers demonstrated good diagnostic performance in distinguishing CGS patients from healthy controls. Multi-omics data indicated associations between CGS and pathways involving butanoate and propanoate metabolism, fatty acid biosynthesis and degradation pathways, taurine and hypotaurine metabolism, and glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism. The incidence of gallstones was significantly higher in the Clostridium glycyrrhizinilyticum group compared to the control group in mice. The grade of experimental gallstones in control mice was significantly higher than in mice treated with NaA and FOS. FOS could completely inhibit the formation of gallstones in mice. This study characterized gut microbiome and metabolome alterations in CGS. C. glycyrrhizinilyticum contributed to gallstone formation in mice. Supplementing with FOS could serve as a potential approach for managing CGS by altering the composition and functionality of gut microbiota."

This systematic review provides a comprehensive summary of the existing evidence to guide future research. Literature searches were conducted in four databases to identify human trials published until May 2024 that examined the impact of probiotic, prebiotic, or synbiotic interventions on faecal microbiota composition changes in overweight and obese participants from Latin American and Caribbean populations (LACPs). Of the 13,090 identified records, five randomised controlled trials (RCTs) from Brazil, Mexico, and Chile met the inclusion criteria for this review. The included RCTs evaluated different forms of therapies over short-term interventions (6 or 8 weeks), with sample sizes ranging from 21 to 39 participants across the studies. Variations in the reported outcomes were observed due to differences in supplement formulation, dosage, population characteristics, and methodological heterogeneity. The findings indicate that the available data are inadequate to establish definitive conclusions regarding the impact of biotic treatments on gut microbiota profiles in LACP. Further research with larger sample sizes and precise microbiota analysis is required to elucidate the implications of dietary interventions on gut microbiota in obesity and related disorders."

      "abstract": "Diabetes Mellitus (DM) is a metabolic disease that manifests as a state of \"chronic low-grade inflammation\". Patients with DM have a disorder of intestinal flora. There is a discernible correlation between this disorder of intestinal flora and the onset and progression of eye diseases, which offers novel insights into treating eye diseases through the modulation of intestinal flora. Here, we demonstrated that a high-fat diet and streptozotocin injection-induced intestinal microbiota dysbiosis can lead to dry eye-like manifestations in T2DM mice. Probiotic and prebiotic treatments not only alleviated intestinal inflammation and barrier disruption, but also mitigated damage to the lacrimal barrier and suppressed immune cell infiltration and inflammatory responses. Additional mechanism investigation found that probiotics and prebiotics inhibited the TLR4/NF-κB signaling pathway and its downstream pro-inflammatory products both in the lacrimal gland and colon. 16S RNA sequencing identified a reduction in the bacterial genera Akkermansia and Lactobacillus in the fecal samples of DM mice. By contrast, treatment with probiotics and prebiotics led to a reshaping of the intestinal microbial community and a reduction in bile acid metabolites, such as taurocholic acid and deoxycholic acid. Our current study demonstrates that probiotic and prebiotic treatments can ameliorate dry eye-like symptoms and associated pathological changes in T2DM mice. Moreover, we proved that a high-fat diet and STZ-induced microbiota dysbiosis were involved in diabetic dry eye through the gut-eye axis.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: This review aims to assess the effect of oral administration of probiotics and/or prebiotics in children and women of reproductive age (WRA) to improve intestinal iron absorption, hemoglobin, and ferritin levels. METHODS: Randomized controlled trials from published literature on probiotics and or prebiotics for prevention or treatment of anemia as a supplement or fortification in children or WRA till Jan 31, 2023, were included. Studies on probiotics and prebiotics in patients with anemia due to other causes were excluded. Screening and data extraction was done using Distiller SR and meta-analysis was performed using Revman 5.4.1. RESULTS: A total of 1925 records were identified from Pubmed, Embase, and Cochrane, of which 29 were included in the systematic review (14 supplementation and 15 fortification studies; 15 studies in children and 14 studies in WRA). The major interventions included galacto-oligosaccharide, inulin, heat-killed H61, Lactobacillus plantarum 299v, Lactobacillus reuteri, Lactobacillus acidophilus. Meta-analysis of 5 studies in WRA showed that the use of prebiotics and/or probiotics with or without iron was associated with little or no effect on hemoglobin. However, there is low certainty of evidence that the intervention led to improvement in fractional absorption of iron as compared to placebo or iron [8 studies, n = 335, mean increase 0.74%, 95%CI-0.11-1.38, p = 0.02]. Meta-analysis of 6 studies in WRA using prebiotics and/or probiotics with or without iron led to a significant increase in ferritin levels in WRA (mean increase 2.45 ng/ml, 95% CI 0.61-4.3, p = 0.009, n = 320) [Moderate certainty of evidence]. In children, meta-analysis of up to 8 studies did not result in any significant change in hemoglobin, ferritin and fractional iron absorption [low or very low certainty of evidence]. CONCLUSION: There is some evidence to show that the use of prebiotics or probiotics (especially Lp299v and GOS) with or without oral iron can improve iron absorption in women and lead to improvement in ferritin levels in women. However, the current evidence does not conclusively show the benefit of these interventions in improving hemoglobin levels in women and children."

      "abstract": "Oral administration of probiotics holds promise for alleviating ulcerative colitis (UC), yet their efficacy is inevitably compromised by the hostile gastrointestinal (GI) environment. Here, we devised a strategy by coating β-glucan (GN) prebiotic onto the surface of Lactobacillus plantarum (Lp) probiotic at the single-cell level (Lp@CGN) based on bioorthogonal chemistry in a layer-by-layer manner. This achieved to form a firm, dense, and multifunctional GN-based \"armor\" with advances of superior protective properties, colon-targeted degradation, and prebiotic benefits. Under the protection of the prebiotic-based \"armor\", Lp@CGN exhibited a notable 276-fold increase in the survival rate compared to naïve Lp after exposure to whole GI conditions. Upon reaching the colon, the \"armor\" was metabolized into short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) by gut microbiota, facilitating the timely release of Lp within colon, thereby achieving a synergistic treatment effect due to sustained SCFAs generation and Lp liberation. As a result, oral administration of Lp@CGN efficiently realized the alleviation of UC in both preventative and therapeutic models through restoring intestinal mucosal barriers, positively regulating inflammatory cytokines, renovating the dysbiosis of gut microbiota, and promoting SCFAs production. In sum, our strategy marks the reconstruction of probiotics with chemical tools, offering useful insights into powering probiotics for disease treatment.",

      "abstract": "Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) is a disorder characterized by the excessive growth of bacteria in the small intestine. Bacterial overgrowth disrupts the bacterial balance and can lead to abdominal pain, weight loss, and gastrointestinal symptoms, including bloating, diarrhea, and malabsorption. SIBO is widespread in the population. There are two main methods for diagnosing SIBO: breath tests and bacterial culture. The most commonly used method is a breath test, which enables the division of SIBO into the following three types: hydrogen-dominant (H-SIBO), methane-dominant (CH4-SIBO), and hydrogen/methane-dominant (H/CH4-SIBO). This comprehensive review aims to present the current knowledge on the use of prebiotics, probiotics, and postbiotics in the context of SIBO. For this purpose, medical databases such as MEDLINE (PubMed) and Scopus were analyzed using specific keywords and their combinations. This review is based on research studies no older than 10 years old and those using only human models. In summary, clinical studies have shown that the efficacy of SIBO therapy can be increased by combining antibiotics with probiotics, especially in vulnerable patients such as children and pregnant women. The further development of diagnostic methods, such as point of care testing (POCT) and portable devices, and a better understanding of the mechanisms of biotics action are needed to treat SIBO more effectively and improve the quality of life of patients."

      "abstract": "Background/Objectives: This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to investigate the effect of prebiotics, alone or as part of synbiotics, on cardiometabolic parameters in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) women. Methods: Databases, including PubMed, Scopus, ISI Web of Science, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, were searched for relevant randomized-controlled trials (RCTs) until 12 December 2024. Changes in mean ± standard deviations were extracted and combined using a random-effects model. Bias was assessed using Cochrane risk of bias and evidence quality with GRADE. Results: Twenty RCTs with 1271 participants were included. Results showed high-quality evidence supporting prebiotics' effects, alone or as part of synbiotics, in reducing body-mass index [n = 853; weighted-mean difference (WMD): -0.510, 95%CI: -0.669, -0.351 kg/m2] and diastolic blood pressure (WMD: -2.218, 95%CI: -4.425, -0.010 mmHg), moderate-quality evidence for weight, waist-to-hip ratio, and triglycerides improvements, and low or very-low-quality evidence for waist circumference (WC), fat mass, fasting plasma glucose, fasting insulin, low-density lipoprotein (LDL), total cholesterol (TC), high sensitive-C reactive protein, total testosterone, follicle-stimulating hormone and free androgen index improvements. Subgroup analyses revealed possible reduction in LDL with prebiotics, as well as possible decreases in WC, TC, and total testosterone with synbiotics. Dietary approaches to stop hypertension diet improved insulin sensitivity. Conclusions: This study suggests that prebiotics may beneficially affect several cardiometabolic parameters in PCOS women. Approximately one-third of the results were based on moderate-to-high-quality evidence. This study highlights the need for future well-designed, larger RCTs with longer treatment duration to strengthen the evidence base and guide clinical decision-making."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a debilitating disorder characterized by intrusive memories, avoidance, negative thoughts and moods, and heightened arousal. Many patients also report gastrointestinal symptoms. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is an evidence-based treatment approach for PTSD that successfully reduces symptoms. However, many patients still meet criteria for PTSD after treatment or continue to have symptoms indicating the need for new treatment strategies for PTSD. Patients with PTSD have a disrupted intestinal microbiome (i.e., dysbiosis) which can promote neuroinflammation; thus, modulation of the microbiome could be an alternative or adjunct treatment approach for PTSD. METHODS: The current study was a 12-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial seeking to understand if CBT combined with a microbiota-modifying, prebiotic fiber intervention would beneficially impact clinical outcomes in veterans with PTSD (n = 70). This proof-of-concept, pilot trial was designed to assess: (1) the relationship between severity of PTSD symptoms and microbiota composition and SCFA levels (i.e., acetate, propionate, butyrate), (2) if CBT treatment with a concomitant prebiotic fiber intervention would beneficially impact clinical outcomes in veterans with PTSD, (3) evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of a prebiotic intervention as an adjunct treatment to CBT, and (4) assess the impact of treatment on the intestinal microbiota and stool SCFA (i.e., mechanism). RESULTS: This study found that PTSD severity may be associated with reduced abundance of taxa capable of producing the SCFA propionate, and that a subset of individuals with PTSD may benefit from a microbiota-modifying prebiotic intervention. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that targeting the intestinal microbiome through prebiotic supplementation could represent a promising avenue for enhancing treatment outcomes in some individuals with PTSD.

      "abstract": "Women's health is related to several factors that include physical, mental, and reproductive health. Additionally, the vaginal microbiota modulation performs a fundamental role in the regulation of physiological homeostasis and dysbiosis, which provides us a potential overview of the use of different biotic agents and their implications for female health. The objective of this work was propitiated insights and conception about the influence of probiotics, prebiotics, synbiotics, and postbiotics as adjuvants for prevention/treatment on the main infections that can affect women's health. Therefore, seventy-one studies published in the Web of Science Core Collection database from 1999 to 2024 were evaluated and performed to a bibliometric analysis employing the VOSviewer software for scientific mapping and network analysis. Our results suggest that administration of biotic agents as adjuvants are relevant for the prevention and/or treatment of the main diseases that affect female health, since they contribute to a healthy vaginal microbiota through anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial activities. Most clinical studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of intervention using probiotics to the detriment of other biotic agents in women's health, being bacterial vaginosis, polycystic ovary syndrome, and vulvovaginal candidiasis, the main diseases evaluated. However, preclinical studies have emphasized that the inhibition of pathogens responsible for the process of vaginal dysbiosis may be due to the formation of biofilm and the synthesis of compounds that could prevent the adhesion of these microorganisms. Future perspectives point to the beneficial modulation of the vaginal microbiota by biotic agents as a promising adjuvant approach to improve women's health."

      "abstract": "Background: Asthma (a chronic inflammatory disease of the airways) is characterized by a variable course, response to treatment, and prognosis. Its incidence has increased significantly in recent decades. Unfortunately, modern lifestyle and environmental factors contribute to the further increase in the incidence of this disease. Progressive industrialization and urbanization, widespread use of antibiotic therapy, excessive sterility and inappropriate, highly processed diets are some of the many risk factors that are relevant today. Over the years, a lot of evidence has been gathered showing the influence of microorganisms of the gut or airways on human health. Studies published in recent years indicate that dysbiosis (microbial imbalance) and oxidative stress (pro-oxidant-antioxidant imbalance) are important elements of the pathogenesis of this inflammatory disease. Scientists have attempted to counteract the effects of this process by using probiotics, prebiotics, and antioxidants. The use of probiotic microorganisms positively modulates the immune system by maintaining homeostasis between individual fractions of immune system cells. Moreover, recently conducted experiments have shown that probiotics have antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and protective properties in oxidative stress (OS). The aim of this study is to present the current state of knowledge on the role of dysbiosis and OS in the pathogenesis of asthma. Conclusions: This review highlights the importance of using probiotics, prebiotics, and antioxidants as potential strategies to support the treatment and prevention of this disease.",

      "abstract": "CONTEXT: The use of prebiotics and probiotics as a treatment for psychiatric conditions has gained interest due to their potential to modulate the gut-brain axis. This review aims to assess the effectiveness of these interventions in reducing symptoms of depression and anxiety in psychiatric populations. OBJECTIVE: The aim was to comprehensively review and appraise the effectiveness of prebiotic, probiotic, and synbiotic interventions in reducing clinical depression and anxiety symptoms. DATA SOURCES: Systematic searches were conducted across Embase, Medline, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, and Science Citation Index from database inception to May 22, 2023. DATA EXTRACTION: Randomized controlled trials investigating prebiotic, probiotic, or synbiotic interventions for treating clinical depression or anxiety symptoms in clinical samples were included. Data were extracted on study characteristics, intervention details, and outcome measures. The Cochrane Collaboration Tool was used to assess the risk of bias. DATA ANALYSIS: The standardized mean difference (SMD) was calculated using Hedge's g as the metric of effect size. A random-effects model was applied to estimate pooled effect sizes with 95% CIs. Subgroup analyses were performed based on study characteristics, methodological factors, and intervention types. Sensitivity analyses excluded studies with a high risk of bias. RESULTS: Twenty-three RCTs involving 1401 patients met the inclusion criteria, with 20 trials providing sufficient data for meta-analysis. Of these, 18 trials investigated probiotics for depression, 9 trials assessed probiotics for anxiety, and 3 trials examined prebiotics for depression. Probiotics demonstrated a significant reduction in depression symptoms (SMD: -0.96; 95% CI: -1.31, -0.61) and a moderate reduction in anxiety symptoms (SMD: -0.59; 95% CI: -0.98, -0.19). Prebiotics did not show a significant effect on depression (SMD: -0.28; 95% CI: -0.61, 0.04). High heterogeneity was observed across studies, and subgroup analyses indicated that study duration and probiotic formulations contributed to the variation in effect sizes. CONCLUSION: Probiotics showed substantial reductions in depression symptoms and moderate reductions in anxiety symptoms. Prebiotics showed a nonsignificant trend toward reducing depression. An adjunctive mental health treatment approach that diagnoses, monitors, and treats the gut microbiome alongside traditional pharmacological treatment holds promise for clinical practice.

The present study determines the effects of prebiotics and iron fortificants on liver function tests (LFTs) and renal function tests (RFTs) among women of reproductive age (WRA). A double-blind randomized controlled trial was performed for the duration of 90 days. A total of 75 iron-deficient women were selected and randomly divided into 5 groups (4 treatment groups and 1 control group). For this purpose, four different types of fortified wheat flour were prepared using two iron fortificants (NaFeEDTA and FeSO4) and two prebiotics (Inulin and Galacto oligosaccharides) were given to four treatment groups, while control groups were only given iron-fortified flour without the addition of prebiotics. Blood samples were collected every month to evaluate Liver Function Tests, including Alanine Transaminase (ALT), Aspartate Transaminase (AST), Alkaline Phosphatase (ALP), total bilirubin and Renal Function Tests, including serum urea and creatinine. Our results found that prebiotic and iron-fortified diets increased ALT, AST and total bilirubin levels among WRA. For AST, ALP and total bilirubin, our results found the highest increase in the treatment groups treated with prebiotics and iron fortificants at 963 mg/kg GOS + 15 ppm FeSO4. Moreover, the highest values of ALT and serum creatine were seen in groups treated with 963 mg/kg Inulin + 20 ppm NaFeEDTA, while maximum value for serum urea could be seen in the group given 963 mg/kg GOS + 30 ppm FeSO4. The study concluded that prebiotic and iron-fortified diets increased ALT, AST and total bilirubin levels among WRA.",

      "abstract": "Probiotics and prebiotics have been suggested as natural agents against viral infections and dysbiosis and may encourage clinical applications. This review aims to analyze the main and recent advances related to viral infections such as Covid-19 and its gastrointestinal complications, antiviral immunity generated and possible preventive role that probiotics and/or prebiotics can play in controlling and promoting antiviral immunity. The literature search was performed through a critical analysis of relevant publications reported in PubMed and Scopus databases on clinical trials and assays conducted in vitro on colon cells and in vivo on mice. Some studies using probiotics and prebiotics for the prevention of viral infection in different age groups are discussed. Covid-19 patients have been shown to suffer from gastrointestinal complications in addition to respiratory symptoms due to interactions between the respiratory system and the gastrointestinal tract infected with SARS-CoV-2. Unfortunately, therapies used to prevent (or treat) symptoms of Covid-19 have proven to be of limited effectiveness. In addition, the lack of access to coronavirus vaccines around the world and vaccine hesitancy continue to hamper control of Covid-19. It is therefore crucial to find alternative methods that can prevent disease symptoms. Evidence-based efficacy of certain probiotics (Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium) that may be useful in viral infections was shown with immunomodulatory properties (pro-inflammatory mediators reduction), promoting antiviral immunity (antibodies production, virus titers) and controlling inflammation (anti-inflammatory effect), as well as viral clearance and antimicrobial potential against opportunistic bacteria (anti-dysbiosis effect). But, available data about clinical application of probiotics in Covid-19 context remain limited and relevant scientific investigation is still in its early stages. Also, evidence for prebiotics potential in this field is limited, since the exact mechanism involved in systemic immune modulation by these compounds is till now unknown. Thus, further research is necessary to explore in the viral infection context the mechanism by which gut and lung interact in the presence of probiotics and prebiotics through more animal and clinical experiments."

Recent research suggests that probiotics and synbiotics may improve these parameters by modulating the gut microbiota. This study systematically reviewed randomized clinical trials evaluating the impact of probiotic, prebiotic, and synbiotic supplementation on insulin resistance and hormonal parameters in women with PCOS. Methods: Exhaustive searches were conducted in PubMed, Cochrane CENTRAL, Scopus, Web of Science, and Embase, following PRISMA guidelines. Randomized trials assessing supplementation with probiotics, prebiotics, or synbiotics for at least 8 weeks in women diagnosed with PCOS according to the Rotterdam criteria were included. Data on participants, interventions, and outcomes related to insulin resistance and hormones were extracted. Results: Eleven studies from Iran involving overweight or obese women aged 15 to 48 were included. Probiotic and synbiotic supplementation showed significant improvements in insulin resistance (reductions in HOMA-IR, fasting glucose, and insulin), lipid profiles (decreased LDL and triglycerides; increased HDL), and hormonal balance (increased SHBG, decreased total testosterone). Synbiotics had more pronounced effects than probiotics or prebiotics alone. Adherence was high, and side effects were minimal. Conclusions: Despite promising results, limitations such as small sample sizes, homogeneous populations, and short intervention durations limit the generalization of the findings. Larger, longer, multicenter trials with diverse populations and standardized methodologies are needed to confirm the efficacy and safety of synbiotics in managing PCOS. Integrating these interventions could improve clinical management and quality of life for affected women, but additional evidence is required to support widespread use.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial benefits of prebiotics may present an affordable and cost-effective strategy for not only the prevention but also treatment of malnutrition. Therefore, the present trial has been designed with the aim to evaluate the role of prebiotics on the gut microbiome of severe acute malnourished (SAM) children. METHODS: The study is designed as a prospective, double-blinded, triple-armed, multi-centered randomized controlled trial, with 6-59 months old uncomplicated SAM children recruited to the experimental group receiving ready-to-use therapeutic food (RUTF) plus prebiotics and the active comparator group receiving RUTF plus starch for 2 months duration (8 weeks). Healthy children with matching age and gender will be recruited to placebo comparator group and will receive starch as a placebo during the study period. A total of 58 participants will be recruited to each arm with 1:1:1 allocation ratio following a pre-defined inclusion and exclusion criteria. The results of the gut microbiome diversity will serve as the primary outcome, while weight-for-height/length z-score, mid-upper-arm circumference, neurodevelopment assessment, and body mass accumulation will serve as the secondary outcome. Data collection and evaluations will be conducted at baseline and at the end of the trial (week 8), while the safety monitoring will be conducted at every second week. For analysis, the principles of intention-to-treat will be followed. CONCLUSIONS: Conclusively, the results of the present trial would provide useful insights and high-quality data for the treatment and management of SAM children by evaluating the effect of RUTF plus prebiotic on the gut microbiome diversity of children, leading to medical evidence for designing the large-scale studies. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The present trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov with identifier No: NCT06155474 and registration date 4 December 2023.",

Dysbiosis in the composition of gut microbiota is one of the leading causes of chronic inflammatory diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). IBD is a global public health challenge and millions of people in the world are suffering from this disease. It is a recurring inflammatory disease that affects different parts of the human digestive system. Ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease are the two main types of IBD with similar clinical symptoms. The increasing incidence and severity of IBD require new treatment methods. The composition of the gut microbiota can be modified using dietary supplements such as prebiotics and bacterial supplements called probiotics. Furthermore, the effects of the microbiome can be improved by using paraprobiotics (non-viable, inactivated bacteria or their components) and/or postbiotics (products of bacterial metabolism).",

      "abstract": "Recent studies have linked Ruminococcus gnavus to inflammatory bowel disease and Fusobacterium nucleatum to various cancers. Agarooligosaccharides (AOS), derived from the acid hydrolysis of agar, have shown significant inhibitory effects on the growth of R. gnavus and F. nucleatum at concentrations of 0.1 and 0.2%, respectively. RNA sequencing and quantitative reverse-transcription PCR analyses revealed the downregulation of fatty acid biosynthesis genes (fab genes) in these bacteria when exposed to 0.1% AOS. Furthermore, AOS treatment altered the fatty acid composition of R. gnavus cell membranes, increasing medium-chain saturated fatty acids (C8, C10) and C18 fatty acids while reducing long-chain fatty acids (C14, C16). In contrast, no significant growth inhibition was observed in several strains of Bifidobacteria and Lactobacillales at AOS concentrations of 0.2 and 2%, respectively. Co-culture experiments with R. gnavus and Bifidobacterium longum in 0.2% AOS resulted in B. longum dominating the population, constituting over 96% post-incubation. In vivo studies using mice demonstrated a significant reduction in the Lachnospiraceae family, to which R. gnavus belongs, following AOS administration. Quantitative PCR also showed lower levels of the nan gene, potentially associated with immune disorders, in the AOS group. These findings suggest that AOS may introduce a novel concept in prebiotics by selectively inhibiting potentially pathogenic bacteria while preserving beneficial bacteria such as Bifidobacteria and Lactobacillales.",

An expert group was conceived in October 2023 to discuss the evidence base on the use of prebiotics to promote cognitive functioning, with a focus on highlighting knowledge gaps and proposing a list of recommendations to guide this specific area of research forward. To address this, we evaluated existing systematic reviews and meta-analyses of human intervention studies that examine the effects of prebiotics on cognitive functioning. These are predominantly conducted in healthy participants under basal conditions and have, to date, revealed limited effects. In this perspective, we propose that prebiotics should be investigated as agents to promote cognitive resilience by testing their effects on cognitive performance under certain cognition-taxing factors that individuals encounter across their lifespan. These include stress, poor sleep outcomes, sedentary behavior, and unhealthy dietary patterns, all of which have been shown to be associated with altered microbiome and impact global cognition or specific cognitive domains. In addition, we recommend identifying vulnerable populations that are either subclinical or that struggle chronically or periodically with 1 or more cognition-taxing factors, to better uncover the boundary conditions for prebiotic effectiveness. By broadening the scope of research to include diverse populations and challenging conditions in daily life or experimental settings, we can expand our understanding of the role of prebiotics not only in cognitive health or impairment, but also as potential preventative agents that may promote cognitive resilience during aging and in response to various lifestyle-related challenges.",

The prevalence of this condition is high and there is a need to develop strategies to reduce it. Probiotics, prebiotics, and synbiotics may be an alternative treatment for chronic functional constipation. METHODS: To compare the efficacy of dietary supplementation on symptoms of patients who suffer from chronic functional constipation. An exploratory, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled pilot clinical trial was conducted with 74 patients diagnosed with chronic functional constipation who were divided into four treatment groups-Group A: probiotics; Group B: prebiotics; Group C: synbiotics; Group D: placebo. Each patient was treated for 8 weeks. At the beginning and end of treatment, data were collected by administering questionnaires and scales, including the Bristol stool scale, on gastrointestinal symptoms, bowel movements, and sociodemographic and anthropometric characteristics. RESULTS: Stool frequency increased in all four study groups, and greatest difference was observed in the synbiotics group (2.8 ± 1.3 vs. 5.9 ± 2.6; P < 0.001). Stool consistency improved only in the active treatment groups. Based on the evaluation of gastrointestinal symptoms, participants treated with prebiotics, probiotics and synbiotics showed the greatest improvement in abdominal pain (8.28 ± 2.63 vs. 6.56 ± 2.62; P = 0.009), gastroesophageal reflux (4.60 ± 2.66 vs. 3.45 ± 2.42; P = 0.039) and constipation symptoms (13.00 ± 3.97 vs. 8.71 ± 3.35; P = 0.003), respectively. As for quality of life, the main changes were observed in physical health domains, with a placebo effect. CONCLUSIONS: The present study provides evidence supporting the efficacy of dietary supplementation with probiotics, prebiotics, and synbiotics in patients with chronic functional constipation after 8 weeks of treatment."

Probiotics are live microorganisms that provide benefits to the health of their hosts when administered in adequate amounts, while prebiotics are a substrate that is selectively used by host microorganisms. This narrative review aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of prebiotics and probiotics mostly in irritable bowel syndrome, particularly on issues such as the interaction between these products and the gut microbiota, the duration of supplementation and long-term effects, the definition of ideal dosages, and the regulation and quality control of these products. Methods: A bibliographic search was carried out in indexed databases and articles published within 10 years before the beginning of the study and publications in English language, which investigated the specific theme of the study were considered. Papers dealing with topics not covered by the research questions, or presenting errors related with the wrong population or the wrong methods, as well as experimental studies and case reviews were excluded. Fifty-five articles were selected, initially in isolation by the authors and, afterward, under consensus. Results: It was possible to observe the effectiveness mainly of probiotics, in improving specific symptoms of the respective disorder; however, the available data remain unclear due to limitations concerning samples and methods of the studies evaluated. Conclusions: Despite evidence suggestive of therapeutic efficacy, additional multicenter randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with better defined protocols are still necessary to fill in the gaps in this subject, define measures to ensure the safe administration of these products, and confirm their therapeutic potential."

Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the effects of L. paracasei K56, xylooligosaccharide (XOS), galactooligosaccharide (GOS), polyglucose (PG), and their synbiotic combinations (XOS + K56, GOS + K56, and PG + K56) on metabolism and gut composition in children with obesity, using an in vitro fermentation model. Fecal samples were collected from 14 children with obesity for in vitro fermentation, and the effects of the various treatments in gas production and short chain fatty acid synthesis (SCFAs) were assessed. Treatment with probiotics, prebiotics, and synbiotics regulated gut microbiota and metabolites in children with obesity. GOS and XOS had higher degradation rates than PG + K56 synbiotics in the gut microbiota of children with obesity. Moreover, treatment with XOS, GOS, and their synbiotic combinations, (XOS + K56) and (GOS + K56), significantly reduced the production of gas, propionic acid, and butyric acid compared with PG + K56 treatment. Treatments with GOS + K56 and XOS + K56 altered the composition of the gut microbiota, improved the abundance of Bifidobacteria and Lactobacilli, and reduced the abundance of Escherichia/Shigella.

METHODS: Type 2 diabetic mouse models were induced using high-fat diet (HFD) and streptozotocin (STZ), followed by IF treatment. Mice were then grouped for combined therapy with different doses of SLBZS and prebiotics. Fasting blood glucose (FBG) levels, body weight variations, and oral glucose tolerance tests were assessed to elucidate metabolic alterations. The hepatic and renal parameters were evaluated to determine systemic changes in T2DM mice, while the insulin levels were quantified by ELISA to assess glucose homeostasis. Gut microbiota alterations were examined via 16S rRNA sequencing. Alterations of the genes in relevant signaling pathways were analyzed using RT-qPCR. RESULTS: IF improved FBG, body weight, insulin levels, and other diabetes indicators. Combined IF with SLBZS or prebiotics yielded similar effects. Furthermore, it ameliorated dyslipidemia and mitigated hepatic and renal parameters in T2DM mice. Pancreatic tissue histopathology showed islet cell restoration post-intervention. IF therapy reduced the abnormally elevated GSK-3β gene expression and increased the abnormally reduced GLUT2 genes. Further analysis indicated that the combination of IF with prebiotics and high doses of SLBZS upregulated the expression of the INSR and IRS1 genes. Gut microbiota analysis revealed restored diversity and structure, with notable changes in specific bacterial families. At the family level, the contents of Akkermansiaceae and Bifidobacteriaceae were restored. Phylogenetic investigation of communities by reconstruction of unobserved states (PICRUSt2) analysis suggested metabolic pathway alterations. CONCLUSION: IF improved type 2 diabetic symptoms, with combined SLBZS and prebiotics showing similar effects. IF with high concentration of SLBZS and prebiotics doses upregulated the INSR and IRS1 genes and had superior effects on gut microbiota compared to IF alone."

We found that DALI02 and DALI02 + Prebiotics, especially DALI02 + Prebiotics, exhibited significant restorative effects on the immunocompromised state in rats (p < .05). Specifically, both of them promoted the recovery of body weight and immune organ function, enhanced the proliferative capacity of immune cells, and effectively reduced the levels of interleukin 6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α). Furthermore, both of them significantly reduced the levels of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and D-lactic acid in the blood (p < .05). Principal coordinate analysis (PCoA), principal component analysis (PCA), and unsupervised cluster analysis revealed that DALI02 and DALI02 + Prebiotics group were more similar to the blank group at the genus level of the gut microbiota. At the level of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), DALI02 + Prebiotics and blank group belonged to Cluster 3. These results suggested that the intervention with DALI02 and DALI02 + Prebiotics effectively modulated the structure of the gut microbiota, and DALI02 + Prebiotics restored the dysregulation of SCFAs. In summary, DALI02 and DALI02 + Prebiotics possess immunomodulatory functions, with the latter showing superior effects."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: A high-calorie diet results in the development of prediabetes (PD) or type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). This diet has been reported to cause changes in microbial composition, concentration levels of glycemic parameters, and immune cells or inflammatory cytokines. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the effects of prebiotics, as well as Mediterranean and plant-based dietary interventions, on gut microbiota composition and glucose homeostasis in individuals with PD or T2D. METHODS: This systematic review and meta-analysis was developed according to the 2020 PRISMA guidelines and checklist. PubMed, EBSCOhost and Google Scholar were the three databases that were used to search for electronically published studies. Data extraction was conducted and examined by the reviewers and all the eligible studies were selected. To test for the quality and biases of the included studies, the Downs and Black checklist was used, followed by the use of Review Manager 5.4. A forest plot was used for meta-analysis and sensitivity analysis. The strength of the evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendation Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach. RESULTS: Overall, eight studies met the inclusion criteria: seven focused on patients with T2D, and one focused on patients with PD. The prebiotic dietary intervention did not have a statistically significant effect on glycemic control, including fasting blood glucose (FBG) and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c). However, one study investigating the Mediterranean diet reported a significant effect on glycemic control. Both prebiotic and Mediterranean dietary interventions were found to beneficially influence gut microbial composition in the intervention groups compared to the placebo groups. No studies assessed the impact of a plant-based diet on microbial composition and glucose parameters. CONCLUSIONS: This review indicated that dietary intervention with a prebiotic or Mediterranean diet shows to beneficially improve the gut microbiota composition of Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes and Bifidobacteria in patients with PD or T2D. However, their beneficial effects on FBG and HbA1c were less clear and uncertain due to limited reports, particularly regarding the Mediterranean dietary intervention.",

This systematic review evaluates their intervention effects through a network meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials (RCTs). Searches of 4 electronic databases until January 7, 2024, yielded 17 papers reporting on 15 RCTs involving 820 participants. Multiple-strain probiotics (MSP) showed significant efficacy in reducing BMI (Mean Difference (MD) -2.13 kg/m2, 95% credible interval (CrI) [-2.7, -1.57]), waist circumference (MD -1.34 cm, 95% CrI [-2.33, -0.35]), total cholesterol (MD -6.55 mg/dL, 95% CrI [-10.61, -2.45]), triglycerides (MD -3.71 mg/dL, 95% CrI [-5.76, -1.67]), leptin (MD -3.99 ng/mL, 95% CrI [-4.68, -3.3]), and hypersensitive C-reactive protein (Hs-CRP) (MD -1.21 mg/L, 95% CrI [-1.45, -0.97]). Synbiotics were effective in reducing BMI-z score (MD -0.07, 95% CrI [-0.10, -0.04]) and LDL-C (MD -1.54 mg/dL, 95% CrI [-1.98, -1.09]) but led to a slight increase in fasting glucose (MD 1.12 mg/dL, 95% CrI [0.75, 1.49]). Single-ingredient prebiotics and single-strain probiotics also had some beneficial effects on BMI and Hs-CRP, respectively. Moderate to low evidence suggests MSP may be a potential choice for improving BMI and reducing lipids, leptin, and Hs-CRP levels, implying that MSP could aid in managing pediatric obesity and related metabolic issues by modulating the gut microbiota. Although synbiotics show their favorable effects on body metrics and lipid control, their potential impact on blood glucose currently prevents them from being an alternative to MSP for treating pediatric obesity. Further large-scale, well-designed studies are needed to confirm these findings."

      "abstract": "The intestinal barrier is a selective interface between the body´s external and the internal environment. Its layer of epithelial cells is joined together by tight junction proteins. In intestinal permeability (IP), the barrier is compromised, leading to increased translocation of luminal contents such as large molecules, toxins and even microorganisms. Numerous diseases including Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD), Coeliac disease (CD), autoimmune disorders, and diabetes are believed to be associated with IP. Dietary interventions, such as prebiotics, may improve the intestinal barrier. Prebiotics are non-digestible food compounds, that promote the growth and activity of beneficial bacteria in the gut. This systematic review assesses the connection between prebiotic usage and IP. PubMed and Trip were used to identify relevant studies conducted between 2010-2023. Only six studies were found, which all varied in the characteristics of the population, study design, and types of prebiotics interventions. Only one study showed a statistically significant effect of prebiotics on IP. Alteration of intestinal barrier function was measured by lactulose/mannitol, chromium-labelled Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (51Cr-EDTA), lactulose/rhamnose, and sucralose/erythritol excretion as well as zonulin and glucagon-like peptide 2 levels. Three studies also conducted gut microbiota assessment, and one of them showed statistically significant improvement of the gut microbiome. This study also reported a decrease in zonulin level. The main conclusion from this review is that there is a lack of human studies in this important field. Futhermore, large population studies and using standardized protocols, would be required to properly assess the impact of prebiotic intervention and improvement on IP.",

Age-related degenerative diseases are influenced by the intestinal microbiota. However, limited research exists on alterations in the intestinal microbiota in frail older individuals, and the effectiveness of prebiotic intervention for treating frailty remains uncertain.OBJECTIVEWe sought to examine the biological characteristics of the intestinal microbiome in frail older individuals and assess changes in both frailty status and gut microbiota following intervention with a prebiotic blend consisting of inulin and oligofructose.METHODSThe study consisted of 3 components: an observational analysis with a sample size of 1,693, a cross-sectional analysis (n = 300), and a multicenter double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial (n = 200). Body composition, commonly used scales, biochemical markers, intestinal microbiota, and metabolites were examined in 3 groups of older individuals (nonfrail, prefrail, and frail). Subsequently, changes in these indicators were reevaluated after a 3-month intervention using the prebiotic mixture for the prefrail and frail groups.RESULTSThe intervention utilizing a combination of prebiotics significantly improved frailty and renal function among the older population, leading to notable increases in protein levels, body fat percentage, walking speed, and grip strength. Additionally, it stimulated an elevation in gut probiotic count and induced alterations in microbial metabolite expression levels as well as corresponding metabolic pathways.CONCLUSIONSThe findings suggest a potential link between changes in the gut microbiota and frailty in older adults. Prebiotics have the potential to modify the gut microbiota and metabolome, resulting in improved frailty status and prevention of its occurrence.TRIAL REGISTRATIONClinicalTrials.gov NCT03995342.",

The Scopus, Cochrane Library, Web of Sciences, and PubMed databases were systematically searched to define the clinical trials published up to November 2022 in the English language. The comparison of the incidence of COVID-19 disease and levels of specific antibodies against SARS-cov2 between the intervention and placebo groups were evaluated in this systematic review.Results: According to the five included trials, four indicated the incidence of COVID-19, and no significant differences were observed between the probiotic and placebo groups during 1, 2, or 3 months of follow-up in the mentioned studies. Regarding the antibody assays against SARS-Cov2 including IgM, IgG, or IgA reported by three eligible trials, there were no significant differences between the intervention and control groups.Conclusion: It seems that the administration of single or multi-strain probiotics or synbiotics had no prophylactic effects in different populations such as high-risk staff exposed to COVID-19, elderly nursing home residents, healthy adults, and household contact with COVID-19 patients during 1-to-3-months of intervention.",

      "abstract": "Recently, there has been a burgeoning interest in harnessing the potential of biomass and industry byproducts for the development of novel products and materials. In particular, this study explored the efficient valorization of sunflower meal (SFM), an underutilized byproduct of the oil extraction industry, usually discarded or used as low-value animal feed through enzyme-aided fractionation, specifically targeting the extraction and conversion of its abundant carbohydrate component, xylan, into emerging prebiotic compounds-xylo-oligosaccharides (XOSs)-which are recognized as promotors of a healthy gut microbiome and overall human wellbeing. An enzymatic treatment using Alcalase® 2.4 L was implemented for facilitating the recovery of a highly pure hemicellulosic fraction (92.2% carbohydrates) rich in β-(1→4)-linked xylose residues with arabinose and glucuronic acid substitutions (DP-xylan). A further enzymatic treatment of this substrate, using ROHALASE® SEP-VISCO under optimized conditions (70 °C, pH 6, 0.005% v/v enzyme concentration), produced 52.3% of XOSs with a polymerization degree (DP) less than 20 after two hours. Further analyses demonstrated that the majority of the obtained product had a DP less than 6, predominantly consisting of di- and trisaccharides (XOS2 and XOS3) without the significant generation of xylose. These findings highlight the significant potential of SFM for the generation of valuable prebiotic compounds in a sustainable manner."

IBD is associated with 3.6 million physician visits per year, being the most common reason visiting a gastroenterologist and the second most common reason to be absent from work, sharply increasing the health care costs. METHODS AND RESULTS: Several treatments seem to be effective in IBD symptoms relief, such as probiotics, prebiotics, fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), and dietary patterns. Probiotics (living microorganisms that can be supplemented) can protect against pathogenic bacteria due to their antimicrobial qualities. Prebiotics (nondigestible food ingredients) promote the growth of beneficial microbial strains in the gut, giving a health benefit to the host. FMT is supposed to directly change the recipient's microbial composition when a transfer of gastrointestinal microbiota from a healthy donor is carried out. And finally, dietary patterns are in the spotlight, due to the presence of certain nutrients in the gastrointestinal tract affecting gastrointestinal motility, sensitivity, barrier function, and gut microbiota. CONCLUSION: It is particularly important to know what treatment options are available and which are the most efficient in relieving IBD symptoms and improving IBD patient's quality of life.",

      "abstract": "Introduction: The gut microbiota (MB), although one of the main producers of Aβ in the body, in physiological conditions contributes to the maintainance of a healthy brain. Dysbiosis, the dysbalance between Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria in the MB increases Aβ production, contributing to the accumulation of Aβ plaques in the brain, the main histopathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Administration of prebiotics and probiotics, maintaining or recovering gut-MB composition, could represent a nutraceutical strategy to prevent or reduce AD sympthomathology. Aim of this research was to evaluate whether treatment with pre- and probiotics could modify the histopathological signs of neurodegeneration in hippocampal CA1 and CA3 areas of a transgenic mouse model of AD (APP/PS1 mice). The hippocampus is one of the brain regions involved in AD. Methods: Tg mice and Wt littermates (Wt-T and Tg-T) were fed daily for 6 months from 2 months of age with a diet supplemented with prebiotics (a multi-extract of fibers and plant complexes, containing inulin/fruit-oligosaccharides) and probiotics (a 50%-50% mixture of Lactobacillus rhamnosus and Lactobacillus paracasei). Controls were Wt and Tg mice fed with a standard diet. Brain sections were immunostained for Aβ plaques, neurons, astrocytes, microglia, and inflammatory proteins that were evaluated qualitatively and quantitatively by immunofluorescence, confocal microscopy and digital imaging with ImageJ software. Results: Quantitative analyses demonstrated that: 1) The treatment with pre- and probiotics significantly decreased Aβ plaques in CA3, while in CA1 the reduction was not significant; 2) Neuronal damage in CA1 Stratum Pyramidalis was significantly prevented in Tg-T mice; no damage was found in CA3; 3) In both CA1 and CA3 the treatment significantly increased astrocytes density, and GFAP and IBA1 expression, especially around plaques; 4) Microglia reacted differently in CA1 and CA3: in CA3 of Tg-T mice there was a significant increase of CD68+ phagocytic microglia (ball-and-chain phenomic) and of CX3CR1 compared with CA1. Discussion: The higher microglia reactivity could be responsible for their more efficient scavenging activity towards Aβ plaques in CA3 in comparison to CA1. Treatment with pre- and probiotics, modifying many of the physiopathological hallmarks of AD, could be considered an effective nutraceutical strategy against AD symptomatology."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The use of gut biotics, including probiotics, prebiotics, and synbiotics, has shown substantial potential in the management of various health conditions possibly through the gut-organ axis. The role of gut biotics in modulating the gut-brain axis is becoming evident with more research focusing on this intervention. Improvement of gut-organ axis function is possible by using food-related products called gut biotics. However, there is limited comprehension of the knowledge and use of these intestinal or gut biotics. Our aim was to recognize knowledge gaps and assess the improvement of understanding following an education intervention. METHODS: A single-arm study encompassing a convenient sample of 161 inpatient and outpatient subjects aged 50 years and older was conducted at the University of Alberta Hospital from June to August 2023. Knowledge about gut biotics was evaluated using a structured questionnaire consisting of 16 questions and involving six thematic areas. To ensure validity, the questionnaire was pre-tested on 10 physicians and residents who were not part of the study. The questionnaire was administered to study subjects prior to receiving an information sheet about gut biotics. Two weeks after receiving the information sheet, all participants were contacted by phone, and the same questionnaire was administered again. Of the 161 patients, 122 completed the pre-intervention and post-intervention questionnaires and were considered in the analysis. RESULTS: The mean age of the participants was 72 years (SD: 10.8), 57% comprised women, and 39% had less than a high school education. The proportion of polypharmacy and multimorbidity was 87% and 97%, respectively. Following the intervention, there was a noticeable enhancement in knowledge across all the themes, with statistical significance (p<0.001) observed in 14 out of 16 questions as determined by the homogeneity statistical test. CONCLUSIONS: Knowledge gaps in gut biotics were prevalent among study participants, and the educational intervention effectively contributed to the enhancement of knowledge. The results of this study provide valuable information for the development of targeted health education strategies focusing on gut biotics, which may play a role in improving gut-organ axis function."

      "abstract": "The human gut microbiome accompanies us from birth, and it is developed and matured by diet, lifestyle, and environmental factors. During aging, the bacterial composition evolves in reciprocal communication with the host's physiological properties. Many diseases are closely related to the gut microbiome, which means the modulation of the gut microbiome can promote the disease targeting remote organs. This review explores the intricate interaction between the gut microbiome and other organs, and their improvement from disease by prebiotics, probiotics, synbiotics, and postbiotics. Each section of the review is supported by clinical trials that substantiate the benefits of modulation the gut microbiome through dietary intervention for improving primary health outcomes across various axes with the gut. In conclusion, the review underscores the significant potential of targeting the gut microbiome for therapeutic and preventative interventions in a wide range of diseases, calling for further research to fully unlock the microbiome's capabilities in enhancing human health."

The main intent of this study is to synthesize nanosynbiotics as nu traceuticals by combining probiotics, and prebiotics with nanoformulation. The effectiveness of the nanosynbiotics was evaluated using a variety of Nutra-pharmacogenetic assays leading to an AI-integrated formulation profiling was assessed by using machine learning methods. Consequently, Acetobacter oryzoeni as a probiotic and inulin as a prebiotic has been chosen and iron-mediated nanoformulation of symbiotic is achieved. Nanosynbiotics possessed 89.4, 96.7, 93.57, 83.53, 88.53% potential powers of Nutra-pharmacogenetic assays. Artificial intelligent solid dispersion formulation of nanosynbiotics has high dissolution, absorption, distribution, and synergism, in addition, they are non-tox, non-allergen and have a docking score of - 10.83 kcal/mol, implying the best interaction with Pregnane X receptor involved in dysbiosis. The potential of nanosynbiotics to revolutionize treatment strategies through precise targeting and modulation of the gut microbiome for improved health outcomes and disease management is promising. Their transformational influence is projected to be powered by integration with modern technology and customized formulas. Further in-vivo studies are required for the validation of nanosynbiotics as nutraceuticals.",

Recent research exploring the gut-brain axis has shed light on the potential influence of gut microbiota on mental health, offering novel avenues for therapeutic intervention. This paper reviews current evidence on the role of prebiotics and probiotics in the context of MDD treatment. Clinical studies assessing the effects of prebiotic and probiotic interventions have demonstrated promising results, showcasing improvements in depression symptoms and metabolic parameters in certain populations. Notably, prebiotics and probiotics have shown the capacity to modulate inflammatory markers, cortisol levels, and neurotransmitter pathways linked to MDD. However, existing research presents varied outcomes, underscoring the need for further investigation into specific microbial strains, dosage optimization, and long-term effects. Future research should aim at refining personalized interventions, elucidating mechanisms of action, and establishing standardized protocols to integrate these interventions into clinical practice. While prebiotics and probiotics offer potential adjunctive therapies for MDD, continued interdisciplinary efforts are vital to harnessing their full therapeutic potential and reshaping the landscape of depression treatment paradigms.",

Three pre-and probiotic intervention randomized control trials (RCTs) were included in the meta-analysis. A significant increase in butyrate (standardized mean difference (SMD) [confidence interval (CI)] 0.34; [0.02-0.67]) and an improvement in depression scores (SMD [CI] 0.15, [-0.35-0.70]) through pre- and probiotic interventions were shown in the meta-analysis. The intervention duration of the included studies ranged from three days to four weeks, with the examined population being healthy adults. Butyrate was measured in either plasma or feces, and the depression score was obtained under the Swedish core affect scale, the hospital anxiety and depression scale (HADS), or the depression, anxiety, and stress scale-21 items (DASS-21). In addition to butyrate, the total SCFA concentration also seems to be positively associated with pre- and probiotic administration (SMD [CI] 0.55 [0.15-0.95]). Despite the significant short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) and butyrate concentration changes, no significant correlation between butyrate and depression or between SCFAs and depression could be shown through linear regression models. Nevertheless, the regression coefficient b1 = 1.57 (p = 0.17) for butyrate suggests a strong, positive connection between butyrate and depression. Additionally, three studies were qualitatively analyzed, examining fasting as an intervention and revealing a connection between fasting, BHB, and depression. The association between fasting, BHB, and depression or mood elevation appeared to be related to BHB concentrations, which may be due to the similar biochemical properties of BHB and butyrate. Furthermore, caloric restrictions as alternatives to fasting were proposed as potential long-term interventions."

      "abstract": "Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are a significant contributor to global morbidity and death, underscoring the importance of their prevention and treatment. The association between the development and progression of CVD and several risk factors has been extensively studied. Among these risk factors, the gut microbiota has garnered considerable attention of the scientific community during the last two decades. In particular, dysbiosis is directly associated with many risk factors of CVD in the host, such as diabetes. Prior research has demonstrated a robust correlation between dysbiosis and the development of CVD. Probiotics, prebiotics, and synbiotics are considered important regulators of microbiota imbalances as they increase the colonization of beneficial bacteria and thereby alter the gut microbiota. Although these beneficial effects of biotics are now widely recognized, new evidence has demonstrated that target therapy of the microbiota affects many other organs, including the heart, through a process commonly referred to as the gut-heart axis. In this review, we will discuss the potential benefits of probiotics, prebiotics, and synbiotics for the beneficial effects on cardiovascular disease by modulating gut microbiota."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Dietary supplements can modulate the gut microbial ecosystem and affect the immune system. This has potential implications for autoimmune diseases, including multiple sclerosis (MS). Prior studies explored tolerability, symptomatic improvement, and immunologic effects of probiotics in people with MS (pwMS), but no study has examined prebiotics in this population or compared prebiotics with probiotics. METHODS: This is a randomized, open-label trial of participants with relapsing-remitting MS on B-cell depletion therapy from two MS centers. 22 participants enrolled in the original cross-over study in which probiotic (Visbiome, containing Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium and Streptococcus species) or prebiotic (Prebiotin, containing oligofructose enriched inulin) supplementation for 6 weeks was randomized, each followed by a washout period. Due to pandemic-related interruptions and expiration of the study supply of probiotics, another 15 participants enrolled in a single-arm study to receive prebiotic supplementation for 6 weeks followed by a washout period. We assessed supplement tolerability and patient-reported outcomes (PRO) relevant to MS (disability, fatigue, mood, and bowel symptoms) before and after each supplement administration period and each washout period. We bio-archived plasma, serum, peripheral blood mononuclear cells and stool samples at each timepoint for future multi-omic assessment. RESULTS: Prebiotics and probiotics had comparable adherence rates and both supplements were well tolerated in pwMS. Participants on either supplement reported minor adverse events, most of which were mild and self-limited. There was a subjective preference for prebiotics over probiotics. Comparing supplement-associated changes in PRO scores from baseline to 6 weeks post-supplementation, there were significant difference between prebiotics and probiotics for the change in patient-reported global symptom burden (MSRS-R Total) and bowel control (BWCS), but only probiotics statistically improved bowel control from baseline to post-supplementation. CONCLUSION: Supplementation with either prebiotics or probiotics is reasonably well-tolerated and safe. Probiotics improved bowel control, but did not improve other PROs in a 6-week time frame. These data regarding feasibility, tolerability, adherence, and adverse events of supplements will inform future clinical trial designs to definitively compare the efficacy and safety of prebiotics and probiotics. The biological data that will be generated from this study in the future will provide mechanistic insights into the effects of these dietary supplements on MS pathophysiology.",

There are increasing numbers of research studies exploring treatment options involving probiotics, prebiotics, synbiotics, and fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), but it is still uncertain which treatment option is superior. The research was conducted on various databases and unpublished trial data (up to February 2023). Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were screened for adult patients with IBS comparing interventions with placebo. Probiotics, prebiotics, synbiotics, and FMT were assessed for their impact using mean difference and Bayesian network meta-analysis. Out of 6528 articles, 54 were included for probiotics, 7 for prebiotics/synbiotics, and 6 for FMT. Probiotics showed improvement in IBS symptoms, particularly with Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus strains. Prebiotics and synbiotics did not show significant improvement. Network meta-analysis indicated the favorable effects of probiotics (OR = 0.53, 95% CI, 0.48 to 0.59) and FMT (OR = 0.46, 95% CI, 0.33 to 0.64) on IBS, with no serious adverse events reported. In short, probiotics and FMT are effective for managing IBS, with Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus being dominant strains. However, the most effective probiotic combination or strain remains unclear, while prebiotics and synbiotics did not show significant improvement.",

Prebiotics have the potential to improve iron bioavailability by modulating intestinal bacterial population, increasing SCFA production, and stimulating expression of brush border membrane (BBM) iron transport proteins among iron-deficient populations. This study intended to investigate the potential effects of soluble extracts from the cotyledon and seed coat of three pea (Pisum sativum) varieties (CDC Striker, CDC Dakota, and CDC Meadow) on the expression of BBM iron-related proteins (DCYTB and DMT1) and populations of beneficial intestinal bacteria in vivo using the Gallus gallus model by oral gavage (one day old chicks) with 1 mL of 50 mg/mL pea soluble extract solutions. The seed coat treatment groups increased the relative abundance of Bifidobacterium compared to the cotyledon treatment groups, with CDC Dakota seed coat (dark brown pigmented) recording the highest relative abundance of Bifidobacterium. In contrast, CDC Striker Cotyledon (dark-green-pigmented) significantly increased the relative abundance of Lactobacillus (p < 0.05). Subsequently, the two dark-pigmented treatment groups (CDC Striker Cotyledon and CDC Dakota seed coats) recorded the highest expression of DCYTB.

The quality assessment of clinical trials was conducted using the Cochrane Collaboration tool and for animal studies, the SYRCLE's tool was used. Our literature search resulted in 652 studies. After removing duplicates and screening the articles based on their titles and abstracts, we assessed the full text of 112 articles, which yielded 20 clinical trials and 30 animal studies in our systematic review. Most of human and animal studies reported an improvement in physical performance, a decrease in frailty index, and a lower reduction in bone mineral density in the intervention groups. Body composition tends to increase in muscle ratio, muscle mass, and reduce in appendicular lean mass and muscle atrophy. Also, the intervention induced bone turnover and mineral absorption, significantly increasing Ca, P, and Mg absorption and short-chain fatty acid concentration. Additionally, levels of inflammatory markers such as IL1, IL6, IL17, T helper 17, and TNF-α exhibited a decreasing trend, while an increase in IL10 and IFN-γ was observed. Prebiotics, probiotics, or synbiotics supplementations could effectively improve the physical performance and muscle strength and reduce the risk of bone loss and frailty in the elderly."

      "abstract": "The rampant use of antibiotics has led to the emergence of multidrug resistance and is often coupled with gut dysbiosis. To circumvent the harmful impact of antibiotics, probiotics have emerged as an effective intervention. However, while the new probiotics are being added to the list, more recently, the nature and role of their counterparts, viz. prebiotics, postbiotics and parabiotics have also drawn considerable attention. As such, intricate relationships among these gut-biotics vis-à-vis their role in imparting health benefits is to be delineated in a holistic manner. Prebiotic dietary fibers are selectively fermented by probiotics and promote their colonization in the gut. The proliferation of probiotics leads to production of fermentation by-products (postbiotics) which affect the growth of enteropathogens by lowering the pH and producing inhibitory bacteriocins. After completing life-cycle, their dead remnants (parabiotics e.g. exopolysaccharides and cell wall glycoproteins) also inhibit adhesion and biofilm formation of pathogens on the gut epithelium. These beneficial effects are not just endemic to gut but a systemic response is witnessed at different gut-organ axes. Thus, to decipher the role of probiotics, it is imperative to unravel the interdependence between these components. This review elaborates on the recent advancements on various aspects of these gut-biotics and the mechanism of potential attributes like anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-neoplastic, anti-lipidemic and anti-hyperglycemic benefits.",

In this study, the influence of the treatment by LrN1 GtfB on the fine structure and functional characteristics of three maize starches were furtherly investigated and elucidated. Due to the treatment of LrN1 GtfB, the starch molecules were transformed into reuterans containing linear and branched (α1 → 6) linkages with notably smaller molecular weight and shorter chain length. Moreover, the (α1 → 6) linkage ratios in the GtfB-modified high-amylose maize starch (GHMS)/normal maize starch (GNMS)/waxy maize starch (GWMS) increased by 18.3 %/12.6 %/9.0 % as compared to their corresponding controls. In vitro digestibility experiment revealed that the resistant starch content of GHMS, GNMS and GWMS increased by 16 %, 18 % and 25 % as compared to the starch substrates. Furthermore, the butyric acid yielded from GHMS, GNMS and GWMS in the in vitro fermentation experiments were 1.4, 1.5 and 1.4 times higher than those of commercial galactose oligosaccharides. These results indicated that the highly-branched short-clustered reuteran synthesized by LrN1 GtfB might serve as novel potential prebiotics, and provide insights for the synthesis of promising prebiotic dietary fiber from starch.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: This systematic review aimed to summarize the currently available evidence on the effect of oral probiotic therapy on infected wound healing among patients who underwent surgery. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An electronic search was conducted for articles published during 2010- 2022 in Embase, PubMed/Medline, Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar using the keywords \"probiotics,\" \"prebiotics,\" \"synbiotics,\" and \"wound infection.\" The titles and abstracts of 2625 articles were screened, and 22 publications that fulfilled the inclusion criteria were included. RESULTS: The current review provides evidence of the beneficial effects of probiotics on wound infection, significantly reducing the duration of antibiotic usage and the length of hospital stay for patients, with no serious side effects reported. Wound infections following various surgeries, such as abdominal wound surgery, colorectal cancer resection, periampullary neoplasms treatment, liver and bile duct resection, pancreaticoduodenectomy, esophagostomy, dental wound surgery, plastic surgery, and burns, are shown to be positively affected by probiotic usage. Although, in some cases, the improvements were not statistically significant, overall, the administration of probiotics appears to be satisfactory in this regard. CONCLUSION: Probiotics demonstrate the ability to prevent the growth of pathogens and maintain wound space sterility by recruiting M2 macrophages, which produce anti-inflammatory markers and enhance the activity of phagocytic cells. Additionally, probiotics can reduce bacterial translocation from their niche to other areas and inhibit the production of bacterial mediators that lead to bacterial invasion."

However, evidence on their role for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is unclear. This study systematically evaluated the research on prebiotics for treatment of IBD. METHODS: A search was performed in PubMed, Embase, Cochrane, and Web of Science. Eligible articles included randomized controlled trials or prospective observational studies that compared a prebiotic with a placebo or lower-dose control in patients with IBD. Meta-analyses were performed using random-effects models for the outcomes of clinical remission, clinical relapse, and adverse events. RESULTS: Seventeen studies were included. For induction of clinical remission in ulcerative colitis (UC), the fructooligosaccharide (FOS) kestose was effective (relative risk, 2.75, 95% confidence interval, 1.05-7.20; n = 40), but oligofructose-enriched inulin (OF-IN) and lactulose were not. For maintenance of remission in UC, germinated barley foodstuff trended toward preventing clinical relapse (relative risk, 0.40; 95% confidence interval, 0.15-1.03; n = 59), but OF-IN, oat bran, and Plantago ovata did not. For Crohn's disease, OF-IN and lactulose were no different than controls for induction of remission, and FOS was no different than controls for maintenance of remission. Flatulence and bloating were more common with OF-IN; reported adverse events were otherwise similar to controls for other prebiotics. CONCLUSION: Prebiotics, particularly FOS and germinated barley foodstuff, show potential as effective and safe dietary supplements for induction and maintenance of remission in UC, respectively. The overall certainty of evidence was very low. There would be benefit in further investigation on the role of prebiotics as treatment adjuncts for IBD."

      "abstract": "Repeated exposure to antibiotics and changes in the diet and environment shift the gut microbial diversity and composition, making the host susceptible to pathogenic infection. The emergence and ongoing spread of AMR pathogens is a challenging public health issue. Recent evidence showed that probiotics and prebiotics may play a role in decolonizing drug-resistant pathogens by enhancing the colonization resistance in the gut. This review aims to analyze available evidence from human-controlled trials to determine the effect size of probiotic interventions in decolonizing AMR pathogenic bacteria from the gut. We further studied the effects of prebiotics in human and animal studies. PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Scopus, and CINAHL were used to collect articles. The random-effects model meta-analysis was used to pool the data. GRADE Pro and Cochrane collaboration tools were used to assess the bias and quality of evidence. Out of 1395 citations, 29 RCTs were eligible, involving 2871 subjects who underwent either probiotics or placebo treatment to decolonize AMR pathogens. The persistence of pathogenic bacteria after treatment was 22%(probiotics) and 30.8%(placebo). The pooled odds ratio was 0.59(95% CI:0.43-0.81), favoring probiotics with moderate certainty (p = 0.0001) and low heterogeneity (I2 = 49.2%, p = 0.0001). The funnel plot showed no asymmetry in the study distribution (Kendall'sTau = -1.06, p = 0.445). In subgroup, C. difficile showed the highest decolonization (82.4%) in probiotics group. Lactobacillus-based probiotics and Saccharomyces boulardii decolonize 71% and 77% of pathogens effectively. The types of probiotics (p < 0.018) and pathogens (p < 0.02) significantly moderate the outcome of decolonization, whereas the dosages and regions of the studies were insignificant (p < 0.05). Prebiotics reduced the pathogens from 30% to 80% of initial challenges. Moderate certainty of evidence suggests that probiotics and prebiotics may decolonize pathogens through modulation of gut diversity. However, more clinical outcomes are required on particular strains to confirm the decolonization of the pathogens. Protocol registration: PROSPERO (ID = CRD42021276045).",

Therefore, we conducted an umbrella review to examine their effectiveness on anthropometric, cardiometabolic and inflammatory markers. METHODS: We conducted an umbrella review on eligible systematic reviews with meta-analysis (SRMA) published from journals' inception till 13 January 2023 retrieved from seven electronic databases (CINAHL, EMBASE, ProQuest, PubMed, Scopus, The Cochrane Library, and Web of Science). Methodological quality was appraised using the Assessment of Multiple Systematic Reviews 2 (AMSTAR2) tool and certainty of evidence was graded into five classes. Random-effects meta-analyses were performed on outcome effect sizes at the SRMA and primary study levels. Extent of overlapping articles were evaluated using corrected cover area. RESULTS: 24 systematic reviews representing 265 unique studies, 1076 unique effect sizes and 25,973 subjects were included. Synbiotics were evidently more effective in improving weight (-1.91 kg, 95%CI -3.45 kg to -0.37 kg, p = 0.02), total cholesterol (-12.17 mg/dl, 95%CI -17.89 mg/dl to -6.46 mg/dl, p < 0.001), low-density lipoprotein (-12.26 mg/dl, 95%CI -18.27 mg/dl to -6.25 mg/dl, p < 0.01), waist circumference (-1.85 cm, 95%CI -2.77 cm to -0.94 cm, p < 0.01), and fasting plasma glucose (-9.68 mg/dl, 95%CI -16.18 mg/dl to -3.18 mg/dl, p < 0.01). Prebiotics were more effective in improving body mass index (-0.34 kg/m2, 95%CI -0.48 kg/m2 to -0.20 kg/m2, p < 0.01), and HOMA-IR (-0.92, 95%CI -1.91 to 0.07, p = 0.06). Probiotics were shown to be more effective in reducing diastolic blood pressure (-1.34 mmHg, 95%CI -2.14 mmHg to -0.55 mmHg, P < 0.01) improving insulin level change (-0.84 mIU/mL, 95%CI -1.27 mIU/mL to -0.41 mIU/mL, p < 0.01), and the percentage of body fat (-0.66%, 95%CI -0.70% to -0.61%, p < 0.01). For all outcomes, the credibility of evidence was classified as class IV. CONCLUSION: Pre-, pro-, and synbiotics can significantly enhance anthropometric indices, glucose and lipid profiles, blood pressure, and inflammatory markers in individuals confronting obesity. While suggesting their supplementation holds promise for this population, the true clinical impact hinges on tailoring these interventions to specific indications and customizing treatment strategies to align with individual patient needs.",

This study aimed to elucidate the effects of CP on dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis via modulation of the gut microbiota. Mice received prophylactic CP (PCP) for three weeks and DSS in the second week. In the third week, therapeutic CP, mesalazine, and a combination of CP and mesalazine (CPM) were administered to mice with DSS-induced colitis. The administration of PCP and CPM was found to ameliorate colitis, as evidenced by increases in body weight and colon length, elevation of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10, and reductions in the disease activity index, histological scores, and levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in mice with DSS-induced colitis on days 14 or 21. Furthermore, an increase in the relative abundance of probiotics (Ligilactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, and Limosilactobacillus), alpha diversity indices, short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) contents, and microbial network complexity was observed following PCP or CPM treatment. Correlation analysis revealed positive associations between these probiotics and both SCFA and IL-10, and negative associations with pro-inflammatory cytokines. This study highlighted the potential of CP as novel prophylactic and adjunctive treatments for alleviating DSS-induced intestinal inflammation and maintaining gut microbiota homeostasis.",

UC is a type of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and it is a lifetime recurrent disease. UC as a common disease has become a financial burden for many people and has the potential to develop into cancer if not prevented or treated. There are multiple factors such as genetic factors, host immune system disorders, and environmental factors to cause UC. A growing body of research have suggested that intestinal microbiota as an environmental factor play an important role in the occurrence and development of UC. Meanwhile, evidence to date suggests that manipulating the gut microbiome may represent effective treatment for the prevention or management of UC. In addition, the main clinical drugs to treat UC are amino salicylate and corticosteroid. These clinical drugs always have some side effects and low success rate when treating patients with UC. Therefore, there is an urgent need for safe and efficient methods to treat UC. Based on this, probiotics and prebiotics may be a valuable treatment for UC. In order to promote the wide clinical application of probiotics and prebiotics in the treatment of UC. This review aims to summarize the recent literature as an aid to better understanding how the probiotics and prebiotics contributes to UC while evaluating and prospecting the therapeutic effect of the probiotics and prebiotics in the treatment of UC based on previous publications.",

Via analyzing the pathogenesis of rotavirus, it inducing diarrhea is mainly due to disturb enteric nervous system, destroy gut mucosal integrity, induce intracellular electrolyte imbalance, and impair gut microbiota and immunity. Many studies have already proved that prebiotics and probiotics can mitigate the damage and diarrhea induced by rotavirus infection in hosts. Based on these, the current review summarizes and discusses the effects and mechanisms of prebiotics and probiotics on rotavirus-induced diarrhea in piglets.

This NMA demonstrated that both prebiotics and synbiotics resulted in an increase in frequency of stool movements per week. Compared to placebo, lactulose (Mean difference [MD] = 3.39, 95% Confdence interval [CI] [1.13, 5.65], moderate certainty), mix2 (consisting of Lactulose and Bacillus coagulans) (MD = 3.63, 95% CI [1.37, 5.89], moderate certainty), mix6 (consisting of Lactulose and Bifidobacterium coagulans) (MD = 4.30, 95% CI [1.04, 7.54], low certainty), and mix7 (consisting of Lactulose, Bifidobacterium subtilis, and Enterococcus faecium) (MD = 4.58, 95% CI [1.35, 7.78], moderate certainty) exhibited a significant effect. Notably, mix7 demonstrated the highest probability of being the most effective intervention (94.8%). Furthermore, when compared to L. plantarum, four probiotics and two synbiotics showed significant advantages in the Patient Assessment of Constipation Symptoms (PAC-SYM) score. L. reuteri (MD = -13.74, 95% CI [-22.20, -4.66], very low certainty) exhibited a significant effect in improving the Patient Assessment of Constipation Quality of Life (PAC-QoL) score. In terms of safety, there were no statistically significant differences between the intervention and control groups in all adverse event analyses. CONCLUSIONS: Moderate to very low evidence supports the use of lactulose and synbiotics to increase the number of weekly stool movements in patients, particularly highlighting the significant impact of synbiotics in increasing the number of weekly stool movements in patients with constipation. The use of L. paracasei showed improvements in PAC-SYM scores, while L. reuteri demonstrated enhancements in PAC-QoL scores.",

Although hydroelectrolytic replacement is the gold standard in treating diarrhea, it does not interfere with the restoration of the intestinal microbiota. Several studies have searched for an adequate alternative in restructuring intestinal homeostasis, finding that treatments based on probiotics, prebiotics, and synbiotics are effective, which made such treatments increasingly present in clinical practice by reducing illness duration with minimal side effects. However, there are still controversies regarding some unwanted reactions in patients. The diversity of strains and the peculiarities of the pathogens that cause diarrhea require further studies to develop effective protocols for prevention and treatment. Here, we provide a descriptive review of childhood diarrhea, emphasizing treatment with probiotics, prebiotics, and synbiotics.",

To determine whether probiotics and prebiotics affect children with ADHD, a systematic review was conducted. METHODS: The present systematic review analyzed cohort studies and randomized controlled trials that examined whether prebiotics and probiotics are associated with ADHD. Seven randomized controlled trials and two cohort studies met our inclusion criteria. RESULTS: Research on Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) probiotic supplementation showed that children with ADHD had better emotional, physical, social, and school functioning, and a higher health-related quality of life compared to the placebo group. The studies also showed that Synbiotic 2000 reduces markers of intestinal and vascular inflammation in children with ADHD, in part through increasing SCFA levels. CONCLUSION: The use of probiotics and prebiotics as adjuvants therapy in patients with ADHD is beneficial. Further studies with longer duration, including more participants and a variety of age groups, and using various evaluation techniques such as in vivo observation are required to examine the effects of prebiotics and probiotics on ADHD.",

      "abstract": "Gut microbiota plays a crucial role in modulating immune responses, including effector response to infection and surveillance of tumors. This article summarizes the current scientific evidence on the effects of supplementation with prebiotics, probiotics, and synbiotics on high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) infections, precancerous lesions, and various stages of cervical cancer development and treatment while also examining the underlying molecular pathways involved. Our findings indicate that a higher dietary fiber intake is associated with a reduced risk of HPV infection, while certain probiotics have shown promising results in clearing HPV-related lesions. Additionally, certain strains of probiotics, prebiotics such as inulin and fructo-oligosaccharides, and synbiotics decrease the frequency of gastrointestinal adverse effects in cervical cancer patients. These agents attain their results by modulating crucial metabolic pathways, including the reduction of inflammation and oxidative stress, promoting apoptosis, inhibiting cell proliferation, and suppressing the activity of oncogenes, thus attenuating tumorigenesis. We conclude that although further human studies are necessary, robust evidence in preclinical models demonstrates that prebiotics, probiotics, and synbiotics play an essential role in cervical cancer, from infection to carcinogenesis and its medical treatment. Consequently, we strongly recommend conducting high-quality clinical trials using these agents as adjuvants since they have proven safe."

      "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic has profoundly impacted global health, leading to extensive research focused on developing strategies to enhance outbreak response and mitigate the disease's severity. In the aftermath of the pandemic, attention has shifted towards understanding and addressing long-term health implications, particularly in individuals experiencing persistent symptoms, known as long COVID. Research into potential interventions to alleviate long COVID symptoms has intensified, with a focus on strategies to support immune function and mitigate inflammation. One area of interest is the gut microbiota, which plays a crucial role in regulating immune responses and maintaining overall health. Prebiotics and probiotics, known for their ability to modulate the gut microbiota, have emerged as potential therapeutic agents in bolstering immune function and reducing inflammation. This review delves into the intricate relationship between long COVID, the gut microbiota, and immune function, with a specific focus on the role of prebiotics and probiotics. We examine the immune response to long COVID, emphasizing the importance of inflammation and immune regulation in the persistence of symptoms. The potential of probiotics in modulating immune responses, including their mechanisms in combating viral infections such as COVID-19, is discussed in detail. Clinical evidence supporting the use of probiotics in managing long COVID symptoms is summarized, highlighting their role as adjunctive therapy in addressing various aspects of SARS-CoV-2 infection and its aftermath.",

      "abstract": "Previous research has demonstrated that Prebiotics can influence the composition of the gut microbiota, consequently impacting mood regulation. This study aimed to assess the effects of Prebiotics, specifically Fructooligosaccharides (FOS) and Galactooligosaccharides (GOS) on neuroinflammation, depression, and anxiety-like behavior in a mouse model fed a high-fat diet (HFD). Initially, mice were divided into two groups: a control group on a standard diet (n = 15) and a group on an HFD for 18 weeks (n = 45). By the 13th week, the HFD group was further divided into experimental groups: Control (n = 15), HFD (n = 15), HFD receiving Prebiotics (n = 15), and HFD receiving Fluoxetine (n = 15). From the 13th week onward, the HFD + Prebiotics group received both the high-fat diet and a combination of FOS and GOS, while the HFD + Fluoxetine group received Fluoxetine in their drinking water. In the 18th week, all mice underwent tests to evaluate behavior, including the Tail Suspension Test (TST), Forced Swimming Test (FST), Sucrose Preference Test (SPT), and the Plus Maze Test (PMT), after which they were euthanized. Mice on the HFD exhibited increased body weight, abdominal size, blood glucose, triglyceride levels, cholesterol, insulin, HOMA index, and higher serum IL-1β. These obese mice also displayed an increased number of microglia and astrocytes, activation of the TLR4 pathway, and elevated levels of neuroinflammatory markers like TNF-α, IL-1β, and COX-2. Moreover, obese mice showed increased activation of the IDO pathway and decreased levels of NMDA receptors. Additionally, markers of neurogenesis and synaptic plasticity, such as PSD, SAP 102, CREB-p, and BDNF, were lower. Treatment with FOS and GOS reversed symptoms of depression and anxiety in mice subjected to HD. This improvement in behavior resulted from a reduction in dysbiosis with an increase in acetate-producing bacteria (B. acidifaciens and B. dorei) and intestinal permeability, leading to a decrease in chronic peripheral and central inflammation. Furthermore, the modulation of the gut-brain axis by FOS and GOS promoted elevated acetate and GPR43 levels in the brain and a reduction in the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, positively impacting signaling pathways of neuronal proliferation and survival in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: People affected by ulcerative colitis (UC) are interested in dietary therapies as treatments that can improve their health and quality of life. Prebiotics are a category of food ingredients theorised to have health benefits for the gastrointestinal system through their effect on the growth and activity of intestinal bacteria and probiotics. OBJECTIVES: To assess the efficacy and safety of prebiotics for the induction and maintenance of remission in people with active UC. SEARCH METHODS: We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, ClinicalTrials.gov, and WHO ICTRP on 24 June 2023. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) on people with UC. We considered any type of standalone or combination prebiotic intervention, except those prebiotics combined with probiotics (known as synbiotics), compared to any control intervention. We considered interventions of any dose and duration. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We followed standard Cochrane methodology. MAIN RESULTS: We included 9 RCTs involving a total of 445 participants. Study duration ranged from 14 days to 2 to 3 months for induction and 1 to 6 months for maintenance of remission. All studies were on adults. Five studies were on people with mild to moderate active disease, three in remission or mild activity, and one did not mention. We judged only one study as at low risk of bias in all areas. Two studies compared prebiotics with placebo for induction of remission. We cannot draw any conclusions about clinical remission (70% versus 67%; risk ratio (RR) 1.05, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.57 to 1.94); clinical improvement (mean Rachmilewitz score on day 14 of 4.1 versus 4.5; mean difference (MD) -0.40, 95% CI -2.67 to 1.87); faecal calprotectin levels (mean faecal calprotectin on day 14 of 1211 μg/mL versus 3740 μg/mL; MD -2529.00, 95% CI -6925.38 to 1867.38); interleukin-8 (IL-8) levels (mean IL-8 on day 7 of 2.9 pg/mL versus 5.0 pg/mL; MD -2.10, 95% CI -4.93 to 0.73); prostaglandin E2 (PGE-2) levels (mean PGE-2 on day 7 of 7.1 ng/mL versus 11.5 ng/mL; MD -4.40, 95% CI -20.25 to 11.45); or withdrawals due to adverse events (21% versus 8%; RR 2.73, 95% CI 0.51 to 14.55). All evidence was of very low certainty. No other outcomes were reported. Two studies compared inulin and oligofructose 15 g with inulin and oligofructose 7.5 g for induction of remission. We cannot draw any conclusions about clinical remission (53% versus 12.5%; RR 4.27, 95% CI 1.07 to 16.96); clinical improvement (67% versus 25%; RR 2.67, 95% CI 1.06 to 6.70); total adverse events (53.5% versus 31%; RR 1.71, 95% CI 0.72 to 4.06); or withdrawals due to adverse events (13% versus 25%; RR 0.53, 95% CI 0.11 to 2.50). All evidence was of very low certainty. No other outcomes were reported. One study compared prebiotics and anti-inflammatory therapy with anti-inflammatory therapy alone for induction of remission. We cannot draw any conclusions about clinical improvement (mean Lichtiger score at 4 weeks of 6.2 versus 10.3; MD -4.10, 95% CI -8.14 to -0.06) or serum C-reactive protein (CRP) levels (mean CRP levels at 4 weeks 0.55 ng/mL versus 0.50 ng/mL; MD 0.05, 95% CI -0.37 to 0.47). All evidence was of very low certainty. No other outcomes were reported. Three studies compared prebiotics with placebo for maintenance of remission. There may be no difference between groups in rate of clinical relapse (44% versus 33%; RR 1.36, 95% CI 0.79 to 2.31), and prebiotics may lead to more total adverse events than placebo (77% versus 46%; RR 1.68, 95% CI 1.18 to 2.40). The evidence was of low certainty. We cannot draw any conclusions about clinical improvement (mean partial Mayo score at day 60 of 0.428 versus 1.625; MD -1.20, 95% CI -2.17 to -0.22); faecal calprotectin levels (mean faecal calprotectin level at day 60 of 214 μg/mL versus 304 μg/mL; MD -89.79, 95% CI -221.30 to 41.72); quality of life (mean Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (IBDQ) score at day 60 of 193.5 versus 188.0; MD 5.50, 95% CI -8.94 to 19.94); or withdrawals due to adverse events (28.5% versus 11%; RR 2.57, 95% CI 1.15 to 5.73). The evidence for these outcomes was of very low certainty. No other outcomes were reported. One study compared prebiotics with synbiotics for maintenance of remission. We cannot draw any conclusions about quality of life (mean IBDQ score at 4 weeks 182.4 versus 176.1; MD 6.30, 95% CI -6.61 to 19.21) or withdrawals due to adverse events (23% versus 20%; RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.48 to 2.62). All evidence was of very low certainty. No other outcomes were reported. One study compared prebiotics with probiotics for maintenance of remission. We cannot draw any conclusions about quality of life (mean IBDQ score at 4 weeks 182.4 versus 168.6; MD 13.60, 95% CI 1.22 to 25.98) or withdrawals due to adverse events (22.5% versus 22.5%; RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.44 to 2.26). All evidence was of very low certainty. No other outcomes were reported. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There may be no difference in occurrence of clinical relapse when adjuvant treatment with prebiotics is compared with adjuvant treatment with placebo for maintenance of remission in UC. Adjuvant treatment with prebiotics may result in more total adverse events when compared to adjuvant treatment with placebo for maintenance of remission. We could draw no conclusions for any of the other outcomes in this comparison due to the very low certainty of the evidence. The evidence for all other comparisons and outcomes was also of very low certainty, precluding any conclusions. It is difficult to make any clear recommendations for future research based on the findings of this review given the clinical and methodological heterogeneity among studies. It is recommended that a consensus is reached on these issues prior to any further research.",

      "abstract": "Cisplatin is an antimitotic drug able to cause acute and chronic gastrointestinal side effects. Acute side effects are attributable to mucositis while chronic ones are due to neuropathy. Cisplatin has also antibiotic properties inducing dysbiosis which enhances the inflammatory response, worsening local damage. Thus, a treatment aimed at protecting the microbiota could prevent or reduce the toxicity of chemotherapy. Furthermore, since a healthy microbiota enhances the effects of some chemotherapeutic drugs, prebiotics could also improve this drug effectiveness. We investigated whether chronic cisplatin administration determined morphological and functional alterations in mouse proximal colon and whether a diet enriched in prebiotics had protective effects. The results showed that cisplatin caused lack of weight gain, increase in kaolin intake, decrease in stool production and mucus secretion. Prebiotics prevented increases in kaolin intake, changes in stool production and mucus secretion, but had no effect on the lack of weight gain. Moreover, cisplatin determined a reduction in amplitude of spontaneous muscular contractions and of Connexin (Cx)43 expression in the interstitial cells of Cajal, changes that were partially prevented by prebiotics. In conclusion, the present study shows that daily administration of prebiotics, likely protecting the microbiota, prevents most of the colonic cisplatin-induced alterations.",

It is hypothesized that administration of high-dose cholecalciferol (vitamin D3) together with a prebiotic (inulin) will be effective, and possibly additive or synergistic, in reducing CF-related GI and airway dysbiosis. Thus, a 2 x 2 factorial design, placebo-controlled, double-blinded, pilot and feasibility, clinical trial was proposed to test this hypothesis. Forty adult participants with CF were block-randomized into one of four groups: 1) high-dose oral vitamin D3 (50,000 IU weekly) plus oral prebiotic placebo daily; 2) oral prebiotic (12 g inulin daily) plus oral placebo vitamin D3 weekly; 3) combined oral vitamin D3 weekly and oral prebiotic inulin daily; and 4) oral vitamin D3 placebo weekly and oral prebiotic placebo. The primary endpoints included 12-week changes in the microbial bacterial communities, gut and airway microbiota richness and diversity before and after the intervention. This pilot study examined whether vitamin D3 with or without prebiotics supplementation was feasible, changed airway and gut microbiota, and reduced dysbiosis, which in turn, may improve health outcomes and quality of life of patients with CF."

      "abstract": "Dental caries, a highly prevalent oral disease, impacts a significant portion of the global population. Conventional approaches that indiscriminately eradicate microbes disrupt the natural equilibrium of the oral microbiota. In contrast, biointervention strategies aim to restore this balance by introducing beneficial microorganisms or inhibiting cariogenic ones. Over the past three decades, microbial preparations have garnered considerable attention in dental research for the prevention and treatment of dental caries. However, unlike related pathologies in the gastrointestinal, vaginal, and respiratory tracts, dental caries occurs on hard tissues such as tooth enamel and is closely associated with localized acid overproduction facilitated by cariogenic biofilms. Therefore, it is insufficient to rely solely on previous mechanisms to delineate the role of microbial preparations in the oral cavity. A more comprehensive perspective should involve considering the concepts of cariogenic biofilms. This review elucidates the latest research progress, mechanisms of action, challenges, and future research directions regarding probiotics, prebiotics, synbiotics, and postbiotics for the prevention and treatment of dental caries, taking into account the unique pathogenic mechanisms of dental caries. With an enhanced understanding of oral microbiota, personalized microbial therapy will emerge as a critical future research trend.",

This study aimed to evaluate the effects of pre-, pro- or synbiotic supplementation on fecal and semen microbiome composition and sperm quality parameters of stallions. This Latin square crossover trial involved four miniature pony stallions receiving control diet only, or addition of a pro-, pre- or synbiotic formulation. Full-length 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing was used to measure diversity of semen and fecal microbiomes. Total sperm count, total motility, progressive motility, DNA integrity, lipid peroxidation and mitochondrial oxidative stress, biomarkers of sperm quality, were measured after each intervention. A general linear model was employed to analyse and compare microbiome diversity measures and sperm quality data across four time points. Shannon's diversity index (alpha-diversity), and evenness of semen and gastrointestinal microbiomes were significantly different (p<0.001). A trend was observed for prebiotic effects on the diversity indices of the GI microbiome (p= 0.07). No effects of treatments were observed on either semen microbiome or sperm quality. Pre-, pro- and synbiotic supplements showed no negative effect on sperm quality parameters observed. This proof of concept provides preliminary data to inform future studies exploring the relationship between microbiomes and fertility.",

Recent studies suggest prescribing probiotics and prebiotics in ASD could relieve GI disturbances and behavioral issues. This narrative review generalizes the research progress on probiotic and prebiotic therapies for ASD over the past 5 years and further discusses the underlying mechanisms of interaction between probiotics and prebiotics with ASD. Preliminary evidence has demonstrated the beneficial effects of probiotics and prebiotics on GI problems, autism-related behavioral disorders, and gut microbiome composition; the mechanism of probiotics and prebiotics in the treatment of ASD is mediated through inflammatory signaling pathways, metabolic pathways, neuronal signaling pathways, and the involvement of the vagus nerve. However, the results are inconclusive and mainly generated by animal experiments. Overall, the present review recommends further standardization of clinical studies to draw more robust evidence for prescribing probiotics and prebiotics in ASD.",

Although several data indicate that psychological symptoms are frequently reported by patients with IBS, few therapies have been evaluated regarding these issues. METHODS: A retrospective observational study was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of a probiotic-based dietary supplement (Colicron®) in a group of patients with diarrhea-predominant IBS (IBS-D). We included patients treated with Colicron® (1 cps/day for 8 weeks). Primary endpoint was the gastrointestinal symptoms' remission evaluated by Visual Analogue Scale (VAS); secondary endpoint was the impact of the treatment on physical and mental health evaluated by Hospital Anxiety and Depression Score (HADS) and Short Form Health Survey 36 (SF-36). VAS was assessed at week 4 (T4), week 8 (T8) and week 12 (T12), whereas HADS and SF-36 were performed even at the start of the Colicron® treatment (T0). RESULTS: An improvement of VAS Score was observed at T8 (P<0.001) and T12 (P<0.05) compared to T4. Lower HADS-A (anxiety subdomain) score was obtained at each time point versus T0 (P<0.01), and higher scores of all SF-36 domains were observed during the treatment (0.05<P<0.001) compared to baseline. Moreover, HADS-D (depression subdomain) score, correlated positively, at T0 (P<0.05) and T4 (P<0.05) with the age, as well as a positive correlation was detected between disease duration (P<0.05) and age of patients (P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Colicron® could be useful in improving both gastrointestinal and psychological symptoms in IBS-D patients. Further prospective clinical trials are needed to confirm these preliminary data.",

      "abstract": "The main cause of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is abnormal intestinal permeability due to the disruption of the tight junction of the intestinal barrier through a pathogen-mediated inflammatory mechanism and an imbalance of the gut microbiota. This study aimed to evaluate whether 2-ketoglutaric acid alleviated permeability dysfunction with tight junction localization, activated the transforming growth factor beta-activated kinase 1 (TAK1) inflammation pathway, and regulated the homeostasis of the intestinal microbiome in vitro and in vivo IBD model. Our findings revealed that 2-ketoglutaric acid significantly suppressed abnormal intestinal permeability, delocalization of tight junction proteins from the intestinal cell, expression of inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-α, both in vitro and in vivo. 2-Ketoglutaric acid was found to directly bind to TAK1 and inhibit the TNF receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6)-TAK1 interaction, which is related to the activation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) pathways, thereby regulating the expression of mitogen-activated protein kinase. Dietary 2-ketoglutaric acid also alleviated gut microbiota dysbiosis and IBD symptoms, as demonstrated by improvements in the intestine length and the abundance of Ligilactobacillus, Coriobacteriaceae_UCG_002, and Ruminococcaceae_unclassified in mice with colitis. This study indicated that 2-ketoglutaric acid binds to TAK1 for activity inhibition which is related to the NF-κB pathway and alleviates abnormal permeability by regulating tight junction localization and gut microbiome homeostasis. Therefore, 2-ketoglutaric acid is an effective nutraceutical agent and prebiotic for the treatment of IBD.",

METHODS: The study included RCTs related to prebiotics and sepsis in infants. A random effects model and the odds ratio (OR) were applied to estimate the effect of prebiotic use and the incidence of sepsis in infants. The analysis included 16 studies with a total of 6,438 infants. The primary outcome was the OR of sepsis for infants who received prebiotics. RESULTS: The results of the meta-analysis demonstrated that the pooled OR of sepsis was significantly lower for infants who used prebiotics. However, the results indicated a medium level of heterogeneity. CONCLUSION: The results showed that the use of prebiotics might be associated with a reduction of sepsis in infants. The standardized application of this treatment might be an intriguing topic for future clinical research.",

A comprehensive meta-analysis and systematic review was conducted in order to evaluate the effectiveness and protection of many drugs targeted at manipulating the microbiota in the treatment of ASD. METHODS: The present study employed a comprehensive examination of various electronic databases yielded a total of 3,393 records that were deemed possibly pertinent to the study. RCTs encompassed a total of 720 individuals between the ages of 2 and 17, as well as 112 adults and participants ranging from 5 to 55 years old, all of whom had received a diagnosis of ASD. RESULTS: Overall, 10 studies reported Autism-Related Behavioral Symptoms (ARBS). Regarding the enhancement of autism-related behavioral symptoms, there wasn't a statistically significant difference between the intervention groups (combined standardized mean difference = -0.07, 95% confidence interval: -0.39 to 0.24, Z = 0.46, p = 0.65). We observed that in the patients with ASD treated with probiotic frontopolar's power decreased significantly from baseline to endpoints in beta band (Baseline: 13.09 ± 3.46, vs. endpoint: 10.75 ± 2.42, p = 0.043, respectively) and gamma band (Baseline: 5.80 ± 2.42, vs. endpoint: 4.63 ± 1.39, p = 0.033, respectively). Among all tested biochemical measures, a significant negative correlation was found between frontopolar coherence in the gamma band and TNF-α (r = -0.30, p = 0.04). CONCLUSION: The existing body of research provides a comprehensive analysis of the developing evidence that indicates the potential of probiotics, prebiotics, and synbiotics as therapeutic therapies for ASD. Our findings revealed that those there was no significant effect of such therapy on autism-related behavioral symptoms, it has significant effect on the brain connectivity through frontopolar power in beta and gamma bands mediated by chemicals and cytokines, such as TNF-α. The psychobiotics showed no serious side-effects."

      "abstract": "Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) like Crohn's and ulcerative colitis (UC) are multifactorial pathologies caused by environmental factors and genetic background. UC is a chronic inflammatory disorder that specifically targets the colon, resulting in inflammation. Various chemical interventions, including aminosalicylates, corticosteroids, immunomodulators, and biological therapies, have been extensively employed for the purpose of managing symptoms associated with UC. Nevertheless, it is important to note that these therapeutic interventions may give rise to undesirable consequences, including, but not limited to, the potential for weight gain, fluid retention, and heightened vulnerability to infections. Emerging therapeutic approaches for UC are costly due to their chronic nature. Alternatives like synbiotic therapy, combining prebiotics and probiotics, have gained attention for mitigating dysbiosis in UC patients. Prebiotics promote beneficial bacteria proliferation, while probiotics establish a balanced gut microbiota and regulate immune system functionality. The utilisation of synbiotics has been shown to improve the inflammatory response and promote the resolution of symptoms in individuals with UC through the stimulation of beneficial bacteria growth and the enhancement of intestinal barrier integrity. Hence, this review article aims to explore the potential benefits and underlying reasons for incorporating alternative approaches in the management of UC with studies performed using prebiotics, probiotics, and synbiotics to treat ulcerative colitis and to highlight safety and considerations in UC and future perspectives. This will facilitate the utilisation of novel treatment strategies for the safer and more efficacious management of patients with UC.",

Probiotics, prebiotics, and synbiotics have recently attracted attention as preventive measures against colorectal neoplasms. We aimed to analyze the findings of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on the effects of probiotics, prebiotics, and synbiotics in patients at a high risk of CRC, outlining the challenges and future prospects of using probiotics to prevent colorectal tumors and providing evidence for clinical physicians in particular. METHODS: PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library databases were searched for relevant studies published up to January 7, 2022. RCTs conducted on populations with a high risk of CRC who received probiotics, prebiotics or synbiotics in comparison with placebo, candidate agent or no treatment were included. The primary outcome was the incidence or recurrence of any colorectal neoplasms. Additional outcomes included their effects on the diversity of gut microbiota and relevant inflammatory biomarkers. Safety outcomes were also analyzed. Two authors independently screened and selected studies based on pre-specified eligible criteria, performed data extraction and risk-of-bias assessment independently. RESULTS: Nine RCTs were included in the systematic review and meta-analysis. Probiotic supplementation significantly reduced adenoma incidence, but no significant benefit was observed in CRC incidence. Additionally, probiotics modulated gut microbiota and inflammatory biomarkers. CONCLUSION: Probiotics may have beneficial effects in the prevention of CRC. More RCTs with larger sample sizes are warranted to further confirm these findings.",

Patients with UC have relative reductions in abundance of Firmicutes and Bifidobacterium in the colon, and an increase in sulfate-reducing bacteria. Prebiotics are dietary substrates which are selectively metabolised by the human colonic microbiota to confer health benefits to the host. This review explores our current understanding of the potential benefits of prebiotics on various clinical, biochemical, and microbiological endpoints in UC, including new perspectives gained from recent studies in the field.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Iron fortificants tend to be poorly absorbed and may adversely affect the gut, especially in African children. OBJECTIVE: We assessed the effects of prebiotic galacto-oligosaccharides/fructo-oligosaccharides (GOS/FOS) on iron absorption and gut health when added to iron-fortified infant cereal. METHODS: We randomly assigned Kenyan infants (n = 191) to receive daily for 3 wk a cereal containing iron and 7.5 g GOS/FOS (7.5 g+iron group), 3 g (3-g+iron group) GOS/FOS, or no prebiotics (iron group). A subset of infants in the 2 prebiotic+iron groups (n = 66) consumed 4 stable iron isotope-labeled test meals without and with prebiotics, both before and after the intervention. Primary outcome was fractional iron absorption (FIA) from the cereal with or without prebiotics regardless of dose, before and after 3 wk of consumption. Secondary outcomes included fecal gut microbiota, iron and inflammation status, and effects of prebiotic dose. RESULTS: Median (25th-75th percentiles) FIAs from meals before intervention were as follows: 16.3% (8.0%-27.6%) without prebiotics compared with 20.5% (10.4%-33.4%) with prebiotics (Cohen d = 0.53; P < 0.001). FIA from the meal consumed without prebiotics after intervention was 22.9% (8.5%-32.4%), 41% higher than from the meal without prebiotics before intervention (Cohen d = 0.36; P = 0.002). FIA from the meal consumed with prebiotics after intervention was 26.0% (12.2%-36.1%), 60% higher than from the meal without prebiotics before intervention (Cohen d = 0.45; P = 0.007). After 3 wk, compared with the iron group, the following results were observed: 1) Lactobacillus sp. abundances were higher in both prebiotic+iron groups (P < 0.05); 2) Enterobacteriaceae sp. abundances (P = 0.022) and the sum of pathogens (P < 0.001) were lower in the 7.5-g+iron group; 3) the abundance of bacterial toxin-encoding genes was lower in the 3-g+iron group (false discovery rate < 0.05); 4) fecal pH (P < 0.001) and calprotectin (P = 0.033) were lower in the 7.5-g+iron group. CONCLUSIONS: Adding prebiotics to iron-fortified infant cereal increases iron absorption and reduces the adverse effects of iron on the gut microbiome and inflammation in Kenyan infants. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT03894358.",

However, for some diseases related to the gut microbiota, current traditional medicines can only relieve symptoms, and it is difficult to solve the root causes or even cause side effects like disturbances in the gut microbiota. Increasing clinical studies and evidences have demonstrated that probiotics, prebiotics, and postbiotics can prevent and treat various diseases, but currently they can only be used as dietary supplements rather than medicines, which restricts the application of probiotics in the field of medicine. Here, this review analyzes the importance of gut microbiota in human health and the current problems of traditional medicines, and systematically summarizes the effectiveness and mechanisms of probiotics, prebiotics, and postbiotics in maintaining health and treating diseases based on animal models and clinical trials. And based on current research outcomes and development trends in this field, the challenges and prospects of their clinical application in maintaining health, alleviating and treating diseases are analyzed. It is hoped to promote the application of probiotics, prebiotics, and postbiotics in disease treatment and open up new frontiers in probiotic research."

      "abstract": "The human gut microbiota (GM) is a complex microbial ecosystem that colonises the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) and is comprised of bacteria, viruses, fungi, and protozoa. The GM has a symbiotic relationship with its host that is fundamental for body homeostasis. The GM is not limited to the scope of the GIT, but there are bidirectional interactions between the GM and other organs, highlighting the concept of the \"gut-organ axis\". Any deviation from the normal composition of the GM, termed \"microbial dysbiosis\", is implicated in the pathogenesis of various diseases. Only a few studies have demonstrated a relationship between GM modifications and disease phenotypes, and it is still unknown whether an altered GM contributes to a disease or simply reflects its status. Restoration of the GM with probiotics and prebiotics has been postulated, but evidence for the effects of prebiotics is limited. Prebiotics are substrates that are \"selectively utilized by host microorganisms, conferring a health benefit\". This study highlights the bidirectional relationship between the gut and vital human organs and demonstrates the relationship between GM dysbiosis and the emergence of certain representative diseases. Finally, this article focuses on the potential of prebiotics as a target therapy to manipulate the GM and presents the gaps in the literature and research."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a major public health problem affecting 13% of the global population. Prior research has indicated that CKD is associated with gut dysbiosis. Gut dysbiosis may lead to the development and/or progression of CKD, which in turn may in turn lead to gut dysbiosis as a result of uraemic toxins, intestinal wall oedema, metabolic acidosis, prolonged intestinal transit times, polypharmacy (frequent antibiotic exposures) and dietary restrictions used to treat CKD. Interventions such as synbiotics, prebiotics, and probiotics may improve the balance of the gut flora by altering intestinal pH, improving gut microbiota balance and enhancing gut barrier function (i.e. reducing gut permeability). OBJECTIVES: This review aimed to evaluate the benefits and harms of synbiotics, prebiotics, and probiotics for people with CKD. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Register of Studies up to 9 October 2023 through contact with the Information Specialist using search terms relevant to this review. Studies in the Register are identified through searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE, conference proceedings, the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) Search Portal and ClinicalTrials.gov. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) measuring and reporting the effects of synbiotics, prebiotics, or probiotics in any combination and any formulation given to people with CKD (CKD stages 1 to 5, including dialysis and kidney transplant). Two authors independently assessed the retrieved titles and abstracts and, where necessary, the full text to determine which satisfied the inclusion criteria. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Data extraction was independently carried out by two authors using a standard data extraction form. Summary estimates of effect were obtained using a random-effects model, and results were expressed as risk ratios (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous outcomes, and mean difference (MD) or standardised mean difference (SMD) and 95% CI for continuous outcomes. The methodological quality of the included studies was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. Data entry was carried out by one author and cross-checked by another. Confidence in the evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. MAIN RESULTS: Forty-five studies (2266 randomised participants) were included in this review. Study participants were adults (two studies in children) with CKD ranging from stages 1 to 5, with patients receiving and not receiving dialysis, of whom half also had diabetes and hypertension. No studies investigated the same synbiotic, prebiotic or probiotic of similar strains, doses, or frequencies. Most studies were judged to be low risk for selection bias, performance bias and reporting bias, unclear risk for detection bias and for control of confounding factors, and high risk for attrition and other biases. Compared to prebiotics, it is uncertain whether synbiotics improve estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) at four weeks (1 study, 34 participants: MD -3.80 mL/min/1.73 m², 95% CI -17.98 to 10.38), indoxyl sulfate at four weeks (1 study, 42 participants: MD 128.30 ng/mL, 95% CI -242.77 to 499.37), change in gastrointestinal (GI) upset (borborymgi) at four weeks (1 study, 34 participants: RR 15.26, 95% CI 0.99 to 236.23), or change in GI upset (Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale) at 12 months (1 study, 56 participants: MD 0.00, 95% CI -0.27 to 0.27), because the certainty of the evidence was very low. Compared to certain strains of prebiotics, it is uncertain whether a different strain of prebiotics improves eGFR at 12 weeks (1 study, 50 participants: MD 0.00 mL/min, 95% CI -1.73 to 1.73), indoxyl sulfate at six weeks (2 studies, 64 participants: MD -0.20 μg/mL, 95% CI -1.01 to 0.61; I² = 0%) or change in any GI upset, intolerance or microbiota composition, because the certainty of the evidence was very low. Compared to certain strains of probiotics, it is uncertain whether a different strain of probiotic improves eGFR at eight weeks (1 study, 30 participants: MD -0.64 mL/min, 95% CI -9.51 to 8.23; very low certainty evidence). Compared to placebo or no treatment, it is uncertain whether synbiotics improve eGFR at six or 12 weeks (2 studies, 98 participants: MD 1.42 mL/min, 95% CI 0.65 to 2.2) or change in any GI upset or intolerance at 12 weeks because the certainty of the evidence was very low. Compared to placebo or no treatment, it is uncertain whether prebiotics improves indoxyl sulfate at eight weeks (2 studies, 75 participants: SMD -0.14 mg/L, 95% CI -0.60 to 0.31; very low certainty evidence) or microbiota composition because the certainty of the evidence is very low. Compared to placebo or no treatment, it is uncertain whether probiotics improve eGFR at eight, 12 or 15 weeks (3 studies, 128 participants: MD 2.73 mL/min, 95% CI -2.28 to 7.75; I² = 78%), proteinuria at 12 or 24 weeks (1 study, 60 participants: MD -15.60 mg/dL, 95% CI -34.30 to 3.10), indoxyl sulfate at 12 or 24 weeks (2 studies, 83 participants: MD -4.42 mg/dL, 95% CI -9.83 to 1.35; I² = 0%), or any change in GI upset or intolerance because the certainty of the evidence was very low. Probiotics may have little or no effect on albuminuria at 12 or 24 weeks compared to placebo or no treatment (4 studies, 193 participants: MD 0.02 g/dL, 95% CI -0.08 to 0.13; I² = 0%; low certainty evidence). For all comparisons, adverse events were poorly reported and were minimal (flatulence, nausea, diarrhoea, abdominal pain) and non-serious, and withdrawals were not related to the study treatment. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: We found very few studies that adequately test biotic supplementation as alternative treatments for improving kidney function, GI symptoms, dialysis outcomes, allograft function, patient-reported outcomes, CVD, cancer, reducing uraemic toxins, and adverse effects. We are not certain whether synbiotics, prebiotics, or probiotics are more or less effective compared to one another, antibiotics, or standard care for improving patient outcomes in people with CKD. Adverse events were uncommon and mild.",

Therefore, a need exists to examine potential therapeutic or prophylactic molecules for obesity treatment. Prebiotics with non-digestible oligosaccharides (NDOs) have the potential to treat obesity. A limited number of prebiotic NDOs have demonstrated their ability as a convincing therapeutic solution to encounter obesity through various mechanisms, viz., stimulating beneficial microorganisms, reducing the population of pathogenic microorganisms, and also improving lipid metabolism and glucose homeostasis. NDOs include pectic-oligosaccharides, fructo-oligosaccharides, xylo-oligosaccharides, isomalto-oligosaccharides, manno-oligosaccharides and other oligosaccharides which significantly influence the overall human health by different mechanisms. This review provides the treatment of obesity benefits by incorporating these prebiotic NDOs, according to established scientific research, which shows their good effects extend beyond the colon."

A total of 800 as-hatched Ross 308 broiler chicks were equally divided into 4 experimental pens (200 chicks per pen) at a commercial poultry barn, allocating 2 pens per treatment. Birds were fed ad libitum with 2 dietary treatments; CON (without XOS) and XOS (with 0.1g XOS/kg diet) from d 0 to 35. From each pen, 60 Individual birds were weighed weekly whereas caecal content was obtained from 5 birds cervically dislocated on d 35. The caecal bacteria were lysed and their proteins were quantified using label-free quantitative proteomic mass spectrometry. The results showed that XOS significantly increased (P < 0.05) bird weight on d 7, 14, 21, and 28, and body weight gain on d 7, 14, 21, and 35 compared to CON. However, no difference (P > 0.05) in body weight gain was observed from d 0 to 35 between CON and XOS. The proteomic analysis of caecal bacteria revealed that 29 proteins were expressed differently between the CON and the XOS group. Out of 29, 20 proteins were significantly increased in the XOS group compared to CON and 9 of those proteins belonged to the starch-utilizing system (Sus)-like system of the gram-negative Bacteroidetes. Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron (Bt) is a significant constituent of the human gut microbiota, known for its remarkable ability to hydrolyze most glycosidic bonds of polysaccharides. This microorganism possesses a 5-protein complex in its outer membrane, named the starch utilization system (Sus), responsible for adhering to, breaking down, and transporting starch into the cell. Sus serves as an exemplar system for numerous polysaccharide utilization loci that target glycans found in Bt and other members of the Bacteroidetes phylum. The proteins of the Sus-like system are involved in the degradation of complex polysaccharides and transportation of the oligosaccharides into the periplasm of the caecal bacteria where they are further broken down into smaller units. These smaller units are then transported into the cytoplasm of the cell where they are utilized in metabolic pathways leading to potential generation of short-chain fatty acids, thus improving the nutritive value of residual feed. In conclusion, XOS supplementation upregulates the expression of the proteins of the Sus-like system indicating its role as a stimbiotic.",

OBJECTIVE: To assess the comparative effectiveness of alternative prophylactic strategies through a network meta-analysis (NMA) of randomized clinical trials. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, EMBASE, Science Citation Index Expanded, CINAHL, Scopus, Cochrane CENTRAL, and Google Scholar from inception until May 10, 2023. STUDY SELECTION: Eligible trials tested probiotics, prebiotics, lactoferrin, and combination products for prevention of morbidity or mortality in preterm infants. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: A frequentist random-effects model was used for the NMA, and the certainty of evidence and inferences regarding relative effectiveness were assessed using the GRADE approach. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: All-cause mortality, severe necrotizing enterocolitis, culture-proven sepsis, feeding intolerance, time to reach full enteral feeding, and duration of hospitalization. RESULTS: A total of 106 trials involving 25 840 preterm infants were included. Only multiple-strain probiotics were associated with reduced all-cause mortality compared with placebo (risk ratio [RR], 0.69; 95% CI, 0.56 to 0.86; risk difference [RD], -1.7%; 95% CI, -2.4% to -0.8%). Multiple-strain probiotics alone (vs placebo: RR, 0.38; 95% CI, 0.30 to 0.50; RD, -3.7%; 95% CI, -4.1% to -2.9%) or in combination with oligosaccharides (vs placebo: RR, 0.13; 95% CI, 0.05 to 0.37; RD, -5.1%; 95% CI, -5.6% to -3.7%) were among the most effective interventions reducing severe necrotizing enterocolitis.

Multiple-strain probiotics alone (RR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.46 to 0.80; RD, -10.0%; 95% CI, -13.9% to -5.1%) or in combination with oligosaccharides (RR, 0.45; 95% CI, 0.29 to 0.67; RD, -14.1%; 95% CI, -18.3% to -8.5%) and single-strain probiotics (RR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.51 to 0.72; RD, -10.0%; 95% CI, -12.6% to -7.2%) proved of best effectiveness in reduction of feeding intolerance vs placebo. Single-strain probiotics (MD, -1.94 days; 95% CI, -2.96 to -0.92) and multistrain probiotics (MD, -2.03 days; 95% CI, -3.04 to -1.02) proved the most effective in reducing the time to reach full enteral feeding compared with placebo. Only single-strain and multistrain probiotics were associated with greater effectiveness compared with placebo in reducing duration of hospitalization (MD, -3.31 days; 95% CI, -5.05 to -1.58; and MD, -2.20 days; 95% CI, -4.08 to -0.31, respectively). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this systematic review and NMA, moderate- to high-certainty evidence demonstrated an association between multistrain probiotics and reduction in all-cause mortality; these interventions were also associated with the best effectiveness for other key outcomes. Combination products, including single- and multiple-strain probiotics combined with prebiotics or lactoferrin, were associated with the largest reduction in morbidity and mortality.",

      "abstract": "Introduction. Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common gastrointestinal disorder that affects the quality of life of numerous people worldwide.Gap statement. The therapeutic role of gut microbiota modulation in IBS remains controversial.Aim. We aimed to assess the efficacy of probiotics, prebiotics or synbiotics in patients with IBS.Methodology. We searched MEDLINE and EMBASE up to 1 August 2023, to identify the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials investigating the effectiveness of probiotics, prebiotics or synbiotics among patients with IBS. Pooled analyses of the effects of probiotics in relieving IBS symptoms were calculated using a random-effects model. Further subgroup analyses were performed by different genera, doses and duration of treatment.Results. Our final analysis included 52 trials involving 6289 IBS patients. Probiotics significantly increased the overall response rate (RR:1.64; P<0.00001), subjective relief rate (RR:1.50; P=0.0002) and abdominal pain relief rate (RR:1.69; P<0.00001). As for specific genera, mixed probiotics (RR:1.41; P=0.0001), Bifidobacterium (RR:1.76; P<0.00001), Lactobacillus (RR:1.97; P=0.0004) and Saccharomyces (RR:1.31; P=0.0004) markedly relieved IBS symptoms. Mixed probiotics (RR:1.31; P=0.005), Lactobacillus (RR:2.22; P=0.04) and Bifidobacterium (RR:1.62; P<0.0001) elevated patients' subjective relief rate. Besides, probiotics effectively relieved the abdominal pain in IBS patients (RR:1.69; P<0.00001). Probiotics appeared to show a remarkable beneficial role at a dose of 109 c.f.u./day or above (RR:1.662; P<0.0001) and started to work at 4 weeks (RR 1.72; P<0.00001). Efficacy of prebiotics and synbiotics in IBS remained uncertain, due to the deficiency of available RCTs.Conclusions. Probiotics have a therapeutic role in IBS. However, the effect of different probiotics varies. The minimal effective dose of probiotics may be 109 c.f.u./day. With appropriate probiotic formula, the therapeutic effect can occur at 4 weeks. These data provide a basis for further research on the optimal probiotic therapy in IBS.",

      "abstract": "The gastrointestinal tract (GIT) promotes the digestion and absorption of feeds, in addition to the excretion of waste products of digestion. In fish, the GIT is divided into four regions, the headgut, foregut, midgut, and hindgut, to which glands and lymphoid tissues are associated to release digestive enzymes and molecules involved in the immune response and control of host-pathogens. The GIT is inhabited by different species of resident microorganisms, the microbiota, which have co-evolved with the host in a symbiotic relationship and are responsible for metabolic benefits and counteracting pathogen infection. There is a strict connection between a fish's gut microbiota and its health status. This review focuses on the modulation of fish microbiota by feed additives based on prebiotics and probiotics as a feasible strategy to improve fish health status and gut efficiency, mitigate emerging diseases, and maximize rearing and growth performance. Furthermore, the use of histological assays as a valid tool for fish welfare assessment is also discussed, and insights on nutrient absorptive capacity and responsiveness to pathogens in fish by gut morphological endpoints are provided. Overall, the literature reviewed emphasizes the complex interactions between microorganisms and host fish, shedding light on the beneficial use of prebiotics and probiotics in the aquaculture sector, with the potential to provide directions for future research."

      "abstract": "Hypoglycemic medications that could be co-administered with prebiotics and functional foods can potentially reduce the burden of metabolic diseases such as Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM). The efficacy of drugs such as metformin and sulfonylureas can be enhanced by the activity of the intestinal microbiome elaborated metabolites. Functional foods such as prebiotics (e.g., oligofructose) and dietary fibers can treat a dysbiotic gut microbiome by enhancing the diversity of microbial niches in the gut. These beneficial shifts in intestinal microbiome profiles include an increased abundance of bacteria such as Faecalibacterium prauznitzii, Akkermancia muciniphila, Roseburia species, and Bifidobacterium species. An important net effect is an increase in the levels of luminal SCFAs (e.g., butyrate) that provide energy carbon sources for the intestinal microbiome in cross-feeding activities, with concomitant improvement in intestinal dysbiosis with attenuation of inflammatory sequalae and improved intestinal gut barrier integrity, which alleviates the morbidity of T2DM. Oligosaccharides administered adjunctively with pharmacotherapy to ameliorate T2DM represent current plausible treatment modalities.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a multisystem disease; the importance of growth and nutritional status is well established given their implications for lung function and overall survivability. Furthermore, it has been established that intestinal microbial imbalance and inflammation are present in people with CF. Oral prebiotics are commercially available substrates that are selectively utilised by host intestinal micro-organisms and may improve both intestinal and overall health. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the benefits and harms of prebiotics for improving health outcomes in children and adults with CF. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register compiled from electronic database searches and handsearching of journals and conference abstract books. We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles and reviews. Date of last search: 19 October 2022. We also searched PubMed and online trials registries. Date of last search: 13 January 2023. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs assessing the efficacy of prebiotics in children and adults with CF. We planned to only include the first treatment period from cross-over RCTs, regardless of washout period. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We did not identify any relevant trials. MAIN RESULTS: We did not identify any relevant trials for inclusion in this review. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: This review did not find any evidence for the use of prebiotics in people with CF. Until such evidence is available, it is reasonable for clinicians to follow any local guidelines and to discuss the use of dietary prebiotics with their patients. Large and robust RCTs assessing the dietary prebiotics of inulin or galacto-oligosaccharides or fructo-oligosaccharides, or any combination of these, are needed. Such studies should be of at least 12 months in duration and assess outcomes such as growth and nutrition, gastrointestinal symptoms, pulmonary exacerbations, lung function, inflammatory biomarkers, hospitalisations, intestinal microbial profiling, and faecal short-chain fatty acids. Trials should include both children and adults and aim to be adequately powered to allow for subgroup analysis by age.",

Promising results from preclinical and clinical research underline the emerging trend of a microbiome-based approach in oncology. Favorable bacterial species and higher gut diversity are associated with increased treatment efficacy, mainly in chemo- and immunotherapy. On the other hand, alterations in the composition and activity of gut microbial communities are linked to intestinal dysbiosis and contribute to high treatment-induced toxicity. In this Review, we provide an overview of studies concerning gut microbiota modulation in patients with solid and hematologic malignancies with a focus on probiotics, prebiotics, postbiotics, and fecal microbiota transplantation. Targeting the gut microbiome might bring clinical benefits and improve patient outcomes. However, a deeper understanding of mechanisms and large clinical trials concerning microbiome and immunological profiling is warranted to identify safe and effective ways to incorporate microbiota-based interventions in routine clinical practice.",
