      "abstract": "The poor functional properties of walnut protein (WP) limit its application in food colloids. To address this issue, walnut protein-casein composites (WCCs) were fabricated using the pH-shift treatment featuring cost-effectiveness, high safety, and solvent-free nature. Both morphological and physiochemical analyses confirmed the nanoscale novel structures of WCCs. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) results demonstrated their structural integrity. The WCC structures were reshaped from more rigid α-helices and β-sheets to more flexible β-turns and random coils after complexation of WP with casein, as supported by circular dichroism spectral analysis. Moreover, fluorescence spectroscopy analysis of WCCs verified the contribution of electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions in maintaining WCC structures. The results of interfacial kinetics and interfacial rheology experiments found that WCCs with a WP/casein mass ratio of 1:1 (WCC-1:1) rapidly diffused, penetrated, and rearranged at the oil-water interface, forming a strong viscoelastic interfacial film. In addition, the high internal phase emulsion (HIPE) stabilized by WCC-1:1 (HIPE-1:1) exhibited optimal storage stability. Rheological experiments showed that HIPEs stabilized by WP, casein, and WCCs presented a gel network structure with viscoelastic behavior. HIPE-1:1 demonstrated notable viscosity, strain hardening, and structural reconstruction under large deformations. This study provides a strategy for manufacturing emulsion stabilizers based on heterologous dual proteins and insights for developing high-value WP products."

      "abstract": "The global protein demand is in constant increase requiring sustainable and healthier alternative proteins for animal and human nutrition. Yeast-based proteins (YBP) represent a non-negligible environmental-friendly fermentation-based solutions with high nutritional quality and bioavailability. Although in vitro studies cannot reflect the full complexity of in vivo digestion, it is considered as useful alternatives to animal models assessing protein digestibility. A 5 h TIM-1 digestion model (TNO Gastro-Intestinal Model) was used to assess the digestibility profile and amino acid bio-accessibility of YBP (3 separate production batches) versus whey and casein as references. Every hour, dialysate and ileal effluent samples were collected. Total nitrogen and free amino acid (FAA) were quantified. To assess the microbial impact, YBP digestate was subjected to 48 h Colon-on-a-Plate batch fermentation, after which the microbial composition by shotgun sequencing and microbial activity by Short-Chain Fatty Acids (SCFAs), Branched-Chain Fatty Acids (BCFAs) (GC-MS) and untargeted metabolomics (LA-REIMS) was analysed (from N = 11 healthy donors of faecal material). YBP, casein and whey were comparable in terms of digestibility. Although YBP showed a different metabolomic fingerprint compared to casein and whey, the microbial activity through SCFA quantification was significantly increased for all proteins compared to blank but not between protein sources. Whey and casein resulted in a higher abundance of Clostridium compared to YBP, while the treatment with YBP resulted in higher abundance of Bacteroides. Altogether, our results suggest that YBP could be a nutritionally relevant alternative protein.",

      "abstract": "Casein-derived peptides have been shown to reduce blood pressure in animal studies, but evidence from human trials remains limited. This study aimed to investigate the antihypertensive effect and possible mechanisms of a hydrolyzed casein peptide tablet containing GPFPIIV and FFVAPFPEVFGK (HCP-C7C12) in prehypertensive/hypertensive patients. In this double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial, 131 participants were recruited and randomly allocated to either the test product group (HCP) taking tablets containing HCP-C7C12 or the placebo group for an eight-week intervention. 114 participants finally completed the study. After the intervention, both the systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure in the HCP group were significantly reduced (P < 0.01) by 9.41% and 9.53%, respectively. The antihypertensive mechanisms may involve (1) HCP-C7C12 acting as an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, reducing angiotensin II production, and (2) modulating amino acid abundance such as L-Arginine, L-valine, leucine, and phenylalanine, resulting in anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects that improve endothelial function. Additionally, HCP-C7C12 exhibited prebiotic-like effects, activating the butyrate and propionate production pathway and increasing the abundance of gut microbes with anti-inflammatory potentials. Overall, long-term consumption of the HCP-C7C12 tablet could be advantageous for blood pressure control in prehypertensive or hypertensive individuals.",

      "abstract": "This study utilized MAC-T cells cultured in vitro as a model to investigate the effects of varying concentrations of valine on α-casein synthesis and its underlying regulatory mechanisms. In this experiment, MAC-T cells were subjected to a 12 h starvation period, followed by the addition of valine in a range of concentrations (a total of seven concentrations: 0.000, 1.596, 3.192, 6.384, 12.768, 25.536, and 51.072 mM, as well as in 10% Fetal Bovine Serum). The suitable range of valine concentrations was determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs). Real-time fluorescent quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) and Western blot analyses were employed to evaluate the expression levels and phosphorylation states of the casein alpha s1 gene (CSN1S1), casein alpha s2 gene (CSN1S2) and mTOR signaling pathway-related genes. The functionality of the mTOR signaling pathway was further validated through rapamycin (100.000 nM) inhibition experiments. Results indicated that 1× Val (6.384 mM), 2× Val (12.768 mM), 4× Val (25.536 mM), and 8× Val (51.072 mM) significantly enhanced α-casein synthesis (p < 0.01). Within this concentration range, valine significantly upregulated the expression of CSN1S1, CSN1S2, and mTOR signaling pathway-related genes including the RagA gene (RRAGA), RagB gene (RRAGB), RagC gene (RRAGC), RagD gene (RRAGD), mTOR, raptor gene (RPTOR), and 4EBP1 gene (EIF4EBP1), eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (EIF4E), and S6 Kinase 1 (S6K1) (p < 0.01). Notably, the expression of the eukaryotic elongation factor 2 (EEF2) gene peaked at 1× Val (6.384 mM), while the expression of other genes reached their maximum at 4× Val (25.536 mM). Additionally, valine significantly increased the phosphorylation levels of mTOR, S6K1, 4E-binding protein-1 (4EBP1), ribosomal protein S6 (RPS6), and eEF2 (p < 0.01), with the highest phosphorylation levels of mTOR, S6K1, and RPS6 observed at 4× Val (25.536 mM). Rapamycin treatment significantly inhibited mTOR phosphorylation and α-casein synthesis (p < 0.01); however, the addition of 4× Val (25.536 mM) partially mitigated this inhibitory effect. In conclusion, valine promotes α-casein synthesis by activating the mTOR signaling pathway, with an optimal concentration of 4× Val (25.536 mM).",

      "abstract": "Oxytetracycline (OTC) residues in milk spontaneously bind to casein, forming casein-OTC complexes that complicate their removal. This study assessed the degradation effect of pulsed electric field (PEF) treatment on OTC, with a particular focus on its protein-bound form. Casein-bound OTC was successfully prepared, and the effectiveness of PEF in removing casein-bound antibiotics was confirmed using DESI-MSI technology. Under optimal treatment conditions, the degradation rates of OTC in casein-free whey (86.30 % - 93.43 %) and milk (82.47 % - 90.31 %) showed no significant difference, further confirming that the removal efficacy of PEF on OTC was unaffected by casein binding. The degradation of OTC in both matrices followed the Hülsheger model. Four major degradation products were identified, involving three distinct pathways: epimerization, demethylation, and deamidation. Furthermore, cytotoxicity assays demonstrated that PEF treatment significantly reduced the overall toxicity of OTC in milk. This study provides an effective and safe strategy for removing OTC residues from milk."

      "abstract": "In milk, casein proteins orientate themselves into spherical micellar structures with hydrophobic casein subtypes concentrated in the core, while hydrophilic casein subtypes populate the exterior. Previous research demonstrated that milk with the addition of emulsifying salts coupled with high-pressure homogenization induced an unprecedented amount of casein micelle dissociation. This research aims to quantify the extent of casein micelle dissociation in diluted skim milk and evaluate the functionality of these proteins following emulsifying salt treatment coupled with high-pressure homogenization. To evaluate the extent of micellar dissociation, dilute skim milk solutions (20% v/v) were prepared with a varying amount of treatment: no processing (control), just emulsifying salts (Treatment E, 100 mM sodium hexametaphosphate), just high-pressure homogenization (Treatment H, at 300 MPa), and EH (a combination of E and H treatments). Samples were then put through varying filter sizes (0.22 µm, 0.05 µm), and the permeates were analyzed using sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. In the control group (20% skim milk), 9.35% ± 2.53% casein protein permeated through a 0.05 µm filter. Alternatively, 93.2% ± 7.71% casein protein was present in EH samples post-filtration through a 0.05 µm filter, demonstrating a significant processing-induced dissociation of casein micelles. A potential benefit to this casein micelle size reduction is the exposure of highly functional hydrophobic subunits from the core of the micelle. In agreement, compared to the control samples, the EH samples had higher foam expansion index values (138.3% ± 12.58% vs. 33.33% ± 14.43% at 0 h), foam stability (113.3% ± 5.774% vs. 21.67% ± 2.887% after 8 h), emulsifying activity (ca. two-fold higher), and interaction with caffeine. These data demonstrate that E, coupled with H, enhances skim milk system functionality, and these changes are likely due to micellar dissociation and protein conformational changes. This work has direct applications in dairy systems (e.g., dairy foams, dairy ingredients) as well as implications for potential processing strategies for other protein-rich systems."

      "abstract": "Triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) have recently demonstrated great application potential for accelerating wound healing in the field of medical research due to their unique electrical stimulation effect. Among the various types of TENGs, solid-liquid TENGs have attracted much attention due to their significant advantages, such as high contact-separation efficiency and a wide range of liquid motion. Therefore, this study innovatively proposed a solid-liquid biphasic TENG electronic dressing constructed from a casein hydrogel enhanced by the metal-organic framework Zeolitic Imidazolate Framework-8 (ZIF-8). This hydrogel dressing comprised sodium caseinate (SC)/multi-walled carbon nanotubes-polydopamine@polydopamine (MWCNT@PDA)/polyacrylamide (PAM)/ZIF-8. It ingeniously integrates multiple functions such as photothermal, photodynamic antibacterial, and electrical stimulation therapies, thereby establishing a new multimodal synergistic treatment paradigm. Notably, the addition of ZIF-8 not only controlled photothermal release of antibacterial agents but also facilitates the development of a distinctive solid-liquid biphasic operational modality in TENG system, achieving a 131 V peak output voltage through significant enhancement of electrical performance parameters. In addition, the TENG-based system adopts a non-contact electrical stimulation method for wound treatment, fundamentally reducing the risk of infection caused by direct contact. Experiments using mouse fibroblasts revealed that the simultaneous real-time use of near-infrared light and TENG can significantly improve the cell migration process. Empirical studies on animals demonstrated that it could accelerate tissue regeneration and wound healing by increasing collagen deposition and angiogenesis. Based on these results, this study provides new perspectives for the developing intelligent biomedical composites for future wound management. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Chronic wounds have become a major threat to global medical and health fields due to pathogenic infections. Traditional wound dressings mostly focus on passive healing, which has limited effectiveness. To overcome these limitations, we developed an electronic dressing of a casein-based hydrogel TENG enhanced by a MOF. This electronic dressing combines photothermal, photodynamic antibacterial, and electrical stimulation functions and efficiently promotes wound healing through multifunctional synergy. This research provides a promising solution for diabetic wound care and a broader field of chronic wound treatment. It is a solid step in the scientific exploration of interdisciplinary integration, offering new ideas for making the wound treatment field more intelligent, efficient, and precise."

Thus, the current study has explained the casein (CN) mechanism to improve EWP thermal stability. In the methods, EWP-CN intermolecular forces, covalent bonds, secondary structure thermal behaviors, and micro-rheology were investigated. The results showed that EWP-CN sulfhydryl bonds and hydrophobicity were enhanced significantly (p < 0.05) after dynamic heat treatment. Whereas, EWP-CN complex (2,1, v/v) demonstrated the lowest turbidity (61.6 %) and highest stability coefficient (78.2 %) at 90 °C for 20 min compared to EWP. Besides, CN (10 mg/mL) has decreased the EWP aggregated particles up to 1.8 times compared to the control. That was in harmony with viscosity, storage modulus, and thermogram patterns, indicating high heat resistance. In conclusion, this study establishes a new concept to enhance the sensitive raw protein's responses by their conjugations with potential active stabilizers.",

This randomized controlled trial investigated the effect of casein presence in colostrum replacer on serum IgG dynamics on calves. Seventy-one calves (BW: 45.3 ± 5.9 kg) were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 colostrum treatments: colostrum replacer with casein addition to match the maternal colostrum (CR+C; n = 23; 85 g/L of IgG; Premolac Plus, Zinpro; 95 g/L of casein); colostrum replacer without casein addition (CR-C; n = 23; 85 g/L of IgG; Premolac Plus, Zinpro); and maternal colostrum (MC; n = 25; 85 g/L of IgG). Dystocia scores were recorded, and 3 h after birth, calves received 3.7 L of solution via tube feeding. Blood samples and calf vigor assessments were conducted at colostrum feeding (0 h) and 6, 12, 18, 24, 36, 48, and 72 h after colostrum feeding. Serum was analyzed for IgG concentration (g/L) and serum total protein (g/dL; STP). In addition, apparent efficiency of absorption of IgG (%; AEA), maximum IgG concentration (g/L; Cmax), time to maximum IgG concentration (h; Tmax), IgG area under the curve (g/L × h; AUC), and the apparent IgG persistency (%; AIP) were calculated. An ordinal logistic model was used to evaluate the odds of treatment improving a calf's vigor category from colostrum feeding (3 h of age) to 72 h after colostrum feeding. Vigor score was categorized as abnormal (≤4), average (5), or alert (≥6), with hour as a fixed effect. Mixed linear models were used to evaluate the effect of colostrum treatments on serum IgG, STP, AEA, Cmax, Tmax, AIP, and AUC, with time, dystocia score, calf sex, BW, and a treatment by time interaction as fixed effects. Calf vigor scores were not influenced by colostrum treatments. Treatment and time interaction affected serum IgG and STP levels after colostrum feeding. Serum IgG was lower for CR with casein addition (CR+C- compared with CR-C-treated calves) from 6 to 72 h. No difference was observed for serum IgG between CR+C- and MC-treated calves, regardless of time. Additionally, treatment affected AEA, with CR+C-treated calves exhibiting reduced AEA compared with CR-C calves (CR-C = 36.7 ± 2.0%, CR+C = 27.4 ± 2.1%, MC = 31.3 ± 2.1%). Treatment affected the Cmax, with CR+C-treated calves exhibiting reduced Cmax compared with CR-C and MC calves (CR-C = 29.5 ± 1.3 g/L, CR+C = 21.1 ± 1.3 g/L, MC = 26.2 ± 1.4 g/L). No differences were observed between treatments for Tmax and AIP. The AUC was lower for CR+C- compared with CR-C- and MC-treated calves (CR-C = 2,641.2 ± 117.5 g/L × h, CR+C = 1,719.3 ± 120.6 g/L × h, MC = 2,197.5 ± 124.4 g/L × h). For STP, no differences were observed between CR+C- and CR-C-treated calves (from 6 to 72 h). However, calves fed CR+C and CR-C displayed lower STP levels compared with MC-treated calves (from 12 to 24 h). These findings suggest that casein presence in colostrum replacer influences calf serum IgG concentration, STP levels, and AEA in neonatal calves."

Structural analysis revealed the intermolecular covalent interactions between oligochitosan and CH, confirming the occurrence of TGase-type glycation.

In addition, glycated CH treated with ultrasound treatment exhibited superior solubility, foaming capacity, antioxidant activity, and thermal stability.

      "abstract": "Under current dairy cow feeding conditions, the conversion efficiency of dietary nitrogen into milk protein is less than 30%. A thorough understanding of amino acids (AA) uptake and utilization in mammary in response to AA supply is essential for accurately modeling nutritional requirements. This study utilized bovine mammary epithelial cells (BMEC) as a model to investigate the effects of increasing total essential amino acids (EAA) concentrations (0.00, 0.97, 1.94, 3.88, and 7.76 mM) on AA uptake, metabolism, and casein synthesis. The control group (0.00 mM) contained the basal medium without any additional EAA supplementation. The EAA mixture consisted of Thr, Lys, Met, His, Arg, Leu, Ile, Val, and Phe, maintained at fixed relative proportions that matched those found in the mammary artery of dairy cows at peak lactation. Nine cell culture plates were used per treatment, with 6 plates for casein expression analysis and 3 plates for proteomics analysis. After 24 h of incubation with the EAA, cells were harvested for the respective analyses. The culture medium from 6 plates was collected for individual AA content measurement. Data were analyzed using SAS (version 9.4). Orthogonal polynomial contrasts were used to determine the linear, quadratic, and cubic effects of treatments. Significance was declared at P < 0.05. As EAA concentrations in the BMEC medium increased, protein expression of αS1-casein, β-casein, and κ-casein, as well as total EAA, total AA, and each individual EAA uptake (except for Lys) increased quadratically (Pquadratic < 0.01). Meanwhile, the uptake efficiency of total EAA, Thr, Met, Ile, Phe, and His decreased linearly (Plinear < 0.01). Moreover, with increasing total EAA concentration from 0.97 to 7.76 mM, decreases in the uptake efficiency of Thr, Ile, and Phe were greater than for other EAA. Lysine uptake efficiency showed no difference among EAA-treated groups (P > 0.05). The protein expression of key enzymes involved in Met catabolism exhibited significant decreases with increasing EAA concentration (Plinear < 0.01). In contrast, The protein expression of key enzymes associated with Lys (Plinear = 0.008), branched-chain amino acids (Pquadratic < 0.05), and Arg (Plinear < 0.001 or Pquadratic < 0.001) catabolism demonstrated opposite trends, showing significant increases with increasing EAA concentration. These findings suggest that when EAA supply exceeds BMEC metabolic requirements, further increases in EAA supply reduce EAA utilization efficiency without enhancing casein synthesis. Furthermore, individual EAA demonstrate distinct uptake patterns and catabolic responses to changes in total EAA concentration.",

      "abstract": "Objective The study aimed to assess the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of casein hydrolysate-based food supplement, HuPaVir®, in high-risk human papillomavirus (HR-HPV)-positive women. Methods A prospective, multicenter, and non-interventional observational study was carried out in Spain. At the end of the study, 118 HR-HPV-positive women (20 to 65 years old) were enrolled and completed the follow-up as required by the protocol. All participants performed HPV-DNA testing, liquid-based cytology, and DNA extraction by multiplex PCR at zero and six months. Upon baseline evaluation, participants were provided with a casein hydrolyzed formula or managed with a wait-and-see approach. Supplementation treatment consisted of daily consumption of one dose of the casein hydrolysate formula for six months. The study population was then divided into four groups based on the baseline cytology result and the supplementation treatment performed during the follow-up period. Treated participants underwent blood tests to determine different immune parameters. Treated participants were also provided with case report forms to register any adverse effect during the study and were asked to complete a voluntary survey to assess product tolerance and acceptability by rating their level of agreement. Results At six months, consumption of the casein hydrolysate formula resulted in total or partial clearance of the HR-HPV type and normalization of cervical cytology in a statistically significant percentage of cases compared to the untreated group (74.6% vs. 35.6%; p<0.01 and 67.4% vs. 41.9%; p<0.05, respectively). Notably, a positive trend in increasing serum levels of innate immunity markers, such as natural killer (NK) cells, and adaptive immunity markers, such as CD8 and CD4 T lymphocytes, was observed in the treated participants. Conclusion The results suggest that daily supplementation with the casein hydrolysate formula is effective in causing significant virus clearance and lesion remission compared to the conventional approach in clinical practice for HR-HPV-positive women. However, a large, multicenter, standardized, and randomized study with longer-term follow-up, 12 months after supplementation treatment, is needed to confirm and strengthen these findings. The formula was found to be safe and well-tolerated."

In this study, modified casein (CAS-OCS NPs)-based Pickering emulsions were constructed under the combined effect of TGase-type glycation and ultrasound treatment as delivery systems for lutein fortification. Pickering emulsions based on CAS-OCS NPs enhanced the encapsulation efficiency of lutein (87.04 ± 0.30 %). The modification treatments improved the emulsifying properties, environmental stability, and digestive stability, as well as the delivery capability of lutein and antioxidant activity in simulated in vitro gastrointestinal digestion. After glycation modification, the lutein release rate of CAS-OCS NPs-based Pickering emulsions after in vitro digestion was higher than that of untreated casein-based Pickering emulsions, and the maximum release rate was 55.44 ± 0.50 %. Moreover, the CAS-OCS NPs-based Pickering emulsions showed improved lutein bioaccessibility, reaching the maximum value of 58.52 ± 0.52 %. These findings demonstrated the suitability of TGase-type glycation and ultrasound treatment for the preparation of Pickering emulsions to deliver bioactive compounds."

This study assessed the allergenicity of CAP-treated CN in KU812 cells and BALB/c mouse models, supported by a multiomics approach integrating 16S rDNA sequencing, serum metabolomics, and jejunal transcriptomics. CAP treatment reduced CN allergenicity, evidenced by decreased KU812 cell degranulation, alleviated allergic responses in mice, and a Th1/Th2 balance shift toward Th1 dominance. Furthermore, CAP-treated CN restored the gut microbiota equilibrium, increasing the number of beneficial bacteria. Multiomics analysis highlighted its impact on lipid metabolism pathways, with Zbp1 and Hbb-bt identified as potential regulators of allergic responses. These findings underscore the potential of cold argon plasma as an innovative strategy to reduce food allergenicity through multifaceted physiological mechanisms, offering promising therapeutic applications in food allergy management.",

Fluorescence quenching and isothermal titration calorimetry experiments confirmed that OTC binds spontaneously to casein via non-covalent interactions. The -N(CH3)2 group in OTC was identified as the primary binding site. Casein-bound OTC was prepared using a combination of dialysis and ultrafiltration. During thermal treatment, the degradation of free OTC followed zero-order kinetics, whereas casein-bound OTC adhered to first-order kinetics. Seven identical thermal transformation products were identified, but the quantities of these products varied significantly depending on the existing form of OTC molecule. The binding of casein weakened the reactivity of the -N(CH3)2 group while enhancing the reactivity of degradation sites on the adjacent ring, resulting in decreased production of three lower-toxic products and increased production of four higher-toxicity products. Cytotoxicity assays revealed that heating increased the overall toxicity of OTC, particularly in its bound form.",

The ultrasound treatment led to changes in particle size, with an initial increase in aggregation followed by fragmentation. Calcium addition resulted in looser packing, as evidenced by a decrease in both bulk and tapped densities. DSC analysis indicated that calcium addition stabilized the protein-lactose matrix by increasing the glass transition temperature and reducing the number of thermal events. FTIR analysis revealed structural changes in proteins, with a decrease in β-sheet and β-turn and an increase in α-helix structures. These findings suggest that calcium plays a crucial role in reinforcing the structural integrity of the protein-lactose matrix, while ultrasound-induced mechanical forces lead to dynamic changes in particle size and protein conformation."

However, limited studies have been done on the effects of various cow milk varieties, especially β-Casein A2 milk. This study aims to investigate the effect of β-Casein A2 cow milk supplementation on physical growth, inflammation, growth, and metabolism hormonal profiles in stunted children. METHODS: This is a quasi-experimental study with only one group, pre-and post-test design. This research is divided into three stages: allele testing in the β-casein gene, process into ready-to-drink milk, and clinical trial. The participants studied were children aged 12-36 months who were given 200ml Allele-2 milk supplementation once a day for three months. The outcome assessment included physical growth (body weight and height), inflammation (tumour necrosis factor-alpha [TNF-α] and cortisol levels), and growth and metabolism hormonal profiles (insulin-like growth factor-1 [IGF-1], transferrin, and growth hormone [GH] levels) that were measured during pre, middle (week 6), and post (week 12) of intervention. RESULTS: This study included 30 study participants. Significant body weight and height improvements were observed at week six and post-intervention (week 12) compared to pre-intervention. Inflammation markers showed significant reductions in TNF-α and cortisol levels post-intervention. Additionally, growth hormone profiles exhibited significant increases in IGF-1, transferrin, and GH levels post-intervention. CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the potential of β-Casein A2 milk as a dietary intervention to address stunting in low- and middle-income countries. Additionally, β-Casein A2 milk reduces the risk of several diseases due to lower BCM-7 metabolite production than β-Casein A1 milk."

This in vitro study aimed to evaluate and compare SMH changes in the enamel after treatment with these agents. Materials and methods An in vitro study was conducted in which 40 human premolars extracted for orthodontic reasons were sectioned into four enamel sections, which were randomly allocated into four groups: group A (fluoride varnish), group B (CPP-ACP cream), group C (CESP), and group D (control). Group A was treated with a thin layer of fluoride varnish (MI Varnish®, GC Corp., Tokyo, Japan), which was left to absorb for 20 s before air drying. Group B specimens were treated with CPP-ACP cream (GC Tooth Mousse®; GC Corp.) for at least three minutes. Group C received CESP application to the enamel surface, which was allowed to absorb for five minutes. Group D (the control group) did not receive any surface treatment. Artificial carious lesions were induced using a demineralization solution and pH cycling for five days. The treated samples were stored in artificial saliva for 21 days at 37 °C. The SMH was assessed using a Vickers microhardness tester at baseline, post-demineralization, and post-treatment. Statistical analyses included paired t-test, one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), and Tukey's post-hoc test. Results After demineralization, SMH significantly decreased in all groups (p<0.05). After treatment with various remineralizing agents, groups A, B, and C demonstrated significant improvement in SMH compared to the control group (p<0.05). Group C exhibited the greatest improvement in SMH, followed by groups A and B. The difference in the SMH between the treatment groups was statistically significant (p<0.05). Conclusions All three remineralizing agents effectively increased SMH, with CESP showing superior results. Fluoride varnish and CPP-ACP also demonstrated substantial remineralization potential. Further in vivo studies are required to validate these findings in a clinical setting."

The breakdown of A1-β-casein produces β-casomorphin-7 (BCM-7), a peptide with opioid-like properties that is associated with health aspects. In addition, A1- and A2-β-casein have different technological properties. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether cheese produced from the milk of homozygous A1A1 and A2A2 cows varies in terms of its physicochemical parameters and BCM-7 concentration. These parameters were analyzed during initial cheese processing, six weeks of ripening and 84 days of storage, including additional microbiological analyses during the storage period. The pH values of the A1A1 cheeses were higher than those of the A2A2 cheeses from the beginning of production until the starter culture bacteria were added. The yellowness values of the A1A1 cheeses were lower until the salt bath treatment. Water activity, lightness, hardness, fat, protein, NaCl and dry matter content, as well as color and microbiological parameters, were not affected by the β-casein genotype. BCM-7 concentrations were higher in the A1A1 cheeses after pressing and during ripening. We found mainly comparable quality characteristics and slightly different BCM-7 levels in the A1A1 and A2A2 cheeses. From this point of view, both varieties are equally suitable for cheese production."

Ultrasonic treatment ensured effective homogenization of SBO in both types of emulsions, resulting in yellow-tinted semi-opaque films with relatively low micro-roughness. Generally, GEL films demonstrated lower UV barrier properties and solubility but exhibited higher compactness, crystallinity, transparency, surface hydrophobicity, oxygen barrier performance, strength, and antiradical activity compared to their NaCAS-based counterparts. In a concentration-dependent manner, SBO decreased the solubility and water absorption of the gelatin-based film and enhanced its oxygen permeability. Conversely, SBO improved the water vapor barrier properties of both films in a concentration-independent manner. At the highest SBO concentration, the tensile strength of NaCAS- and GEL-based films decreased by 27% and 20%, respectively, while their antiradical activity increased by 9.3× and 4.3× (based on the time required for the half-neutralization of 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl radicals). Migration studies showed that at the lowest concentration, SBO was released (into 95% ethanol) approximately 2× faster from the GEL-based film than from the NaCAS film, whereas at higher concentrations, the trend reversed."

METHODS: This was a blind, crossover study, performed in 5 experimental phases with a duration of 3 days each. At first, the initial surface hardness (SH) and hardness after demineralization (SH1) were determined. Then, volunteers (n = 10) used palatal appliances containing 4 bovine enamel specimens with initial caries lesions. The treatment regimens were: 1) Placebo (No F-TMP-CPP-ACP), 2) 1100 ppm F (1100F), 3) 1100F+3 %TMP (1100F-TMP), 4) 1100F+10 %CPP-ACP (1100F-CPP-ACP) and 5) 1100F-CPP-ACP-TMP. After 3 days, the final surface hardness (post-remineralization) (SH2), percentage of surface hardness recovery (%SHR), integrated recovery of subsurface hardness (ΔIHR), fluoride- (F), calcium- (Ca) and phosphorus- (P) concentration in the enamel were determined. Data were analyzed by ANOVA (one-way, repeated measures) and Student-Newman-Keuls test (p < 0.05). RESULTS: The enamel surface showed greater remineralization (SH2) when treated with 1100F-CPP-ACP-TMP (224.8KHN±1.6) compared to 1100F (163.9KHN±2.0) (p < 0.033). Treatment with 1100F-CPP-ACP-TMP led to remineralization of the subsurface lesion (ΔIHR) by 84 % and 91 % when compared to the 1100F and 1100F-CPP-ACP treatments (p < 0.05). For the F concentration values in the enamel, there was an increase of ⁓ 63 % compared to 1100F (p < 0.05). The Ca concentration in the enamel after 1100F-CPP-ACP-TMP treatment was significantly higher in ⁓ 65 %, ⁓ 28 % and ⁓ 15 % when compared to the 1100F, 1100F-CPP-ACP and 1100F-TMP treatments (p < 0.05). The highest concentration of P was observed for 1100F-ACP-CPP-TMP, which was ⁓ 41 % and ⁓ 17 % higher than the 1100F and 1100F-TMP treatments respectively (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The result of this study demonstrates that the combined use of remineralizing agents (F, CPP-ACP, and TMP) in a single toothpaste formulation (1100F-CPP-ACP-TMP) significantly enhances mineral gain compared to conventional toothpaste, as evidenced by a short-term in situ model. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: The findings of our study offer essential insights for future investigations and potential clinical applications, especially for individuals with initial caries lesions.",

However, the development of printable protein-based MIPEs is still a considerable challenge because reducing oil content will cause phase separation and increase the fluidity of emulsion. In this study, we successfully prepared printable MIPEs (φ = 40 %) inks by co-stabilizing with casein and tamarind seed polysaccharide (TSP) and using post-acid modification technology. Interestingly, compared with pre-acid-treated MIPEs, the G' and viscosity of the post-acid-treated MIPEs were increased by 86.29 % and 78.81 %, respectively. Additionally, with increasing the TSP concentration in the post-acid-treated MIPEs from 0.5 % to 1.5 %, the G' increased from 619.16-1381.67 Pa to 804.38-2165.94 Pa. The self-supporting properties and excellent rheological properties desired for 3D printing were achieved by inducing emulsion droplets to form dense structures owing to the synergistical effect of post-acid treatment and high concentration of TSP.

Protein kinases have been rewarding drug targets across diverse indications but remain untapped for antifungal development. Previously, screening kinase inhibitors against C. albicans revealed a 2,3-aryl-pyrazolopyridine, GW461484A (GW), which targets casein kinase 1 (CK1) family member Yck2. Here, we report optimization of GW via two complementary approaches, synthesis of bioisosteres possessing an imidazo[1,2-a]pyridine core, and R-group substitution of GW's pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyridine core. Characterization of compounds synthesized revealed two 6-cyano derivatives with improved pharmacological properties that retained whole-cell bioactivity and selectivity for fungal Yck2 compared to human CK1α. Efficacy studies in mice indicated both analogs possess single-agent activity against C. albicans resistant to first-line echinocandin antifungals and potentiate non-curative echinocandin treatment. Results validate Yck2 as an antifungal target and encourage further development of inhibitors acting by this previously unexploited mode of action."

The results showed that although HHP had no marked impact on the zeta potential and secondary structure, it altered the protein's spatial structure (primarily its tertiary structure), and improved dispersion properties (such as particle size, solubility, and turbidity), as well as foaming properties. Additionally, HHP improved the antioxidant activity and antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli. However, HHP treatment negatively affected the water-holding capacity, emulsion stability, and antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus. These findings suggest that HHP treatment is a potential method for modifying buffalo milk casein and provides a theoretical basis for its comprehensive utilization.",

However, the development of low-fat mayonnaise is still a big challenge since reducing oil content will increase the fluidity, induce phase separation and decrease the stability of mayonnaise. Herein, we provide a novel strategy for developing yolk-casein-based low-fat mayonnaise (30% oil content) with a similar texture to commercial high-fat mayonnaise through post-acidification. Unexpectedly, compared with pre-acid-treated low-fat mayonnaise, the G' and viscosity of the post-acid-treated low-fat mayonnaise were significantly improved by 77.80% and 90.18%, respectively. The semisolid properties required for low-fat mayonnaise were realized by forming a dense yolk-casein self-assembly network structure. This study provides a novel perspective for constructing edible soft-solid products with low fat intake."

Results showed that the oral administration of CH at a dose of 600 mg/kg/day for 4 weeks reduced the fasting blood glucose levels by 14.73 ± 9.77%, alleviated insulin resistance (HOMA-IR index) by 36.91 ± 22.62%, and mitigated hepatic damage in db/db diabetic-like mice. Hepatic differential metabolites after CH treatment were enriched in Glu-related metabolites, which acted as substrates for the TCA cycle, enhancing hepatic glucose consumption. The hepatic transcriptomic results revealed that CH treatment upregulated (p < 0.05) hub gene expressions of pparg and pik3cb, leading to an activation of the PPAR signaling pathway, further improving the insulin/PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. The hub gene expressions were highly correlated with Glu-related metabolites in multiomics integrated analysis. Glx/Glx-containing peptides (Glx represents Glu and Gln) in CH, as a dietary supplement to increase hepatic Glu-related metabolites, might be the key active component responsible for its hypoglycemic effect. Particularly, the supplement of Glx was confirmed to effectively (p < 0.05) enhance glucose consumption in hepatocytes. This provides a basis for the development of CHs as functional food.",

Among others, a dibenzofuran scaffold has emerged as highly prospective for the development of new CK2 inhibitors. Thirty-three newly synthesized dibenzofuran-based compounds were tested on their inhibitory potential in vitro. 7,9-Dichloro-8-hydroxy-4-[(phenylamino)methylene]-1,2-dihydro-dibenzo[b,d]furan-3(4H)-one (12b) and 7,9-dibromo-8-hydroxy-4-[(phenylamino)methylene]-1,2-dihydro-dibenzo[b,d]furan-3(4H)-one (12c) showed the lowest IC50 values with 5.8 nM for both. The dibenzofuran-based CK2 inhibitors crossed the cell membrane of LNCaP human prostate carcinoma cells and reduced intracellular CK2 activity. Among 70 kinases from different representative subgroups of the human kinome, CK2 was most strongly inhibited by compound 12c. Co-crystallization of 12c together with CK2α indicated a π-halogen bond of the bromine at position C9 with the gatekeeper amino acid Phe113. CK2α could bind both the E- and Z-isomers of 12c. Our results provide new insights into the structure-activity relationships of dibenzofuran derivatives."

Methods: This study examined the effect of CX-4945, a selective CK2 inhibitor, in a human U-87 glioblastoma (GBM) cell line, treated with CX-4945 (5, 10, and 15 μM) for 24 h. Similarly, the hCMEC/D3 cell line was used to mimic the blood-brain barrier (BBB), examining the ability of CX-4945 to restore BBB homeostasis, after stimulation with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and then treated with CX-4945 (5, 10, and 15 μM). Results: We reported that CX-4945 reduced the proliferative activity and modulated the main pathways involved in tumor progression including apoptosis. Furthermore, in confirmation of the in vitro study, performing a xenograft model, we demonstrated that CX-4945 exerted promising antiproliferative effects, also restoring the tight junctions' expression. Conclusions: These new insights into the molecular signaling of CK2 in GBM and BBB demonstrate that CX-4945 could be a promising approach for future GBM therapy, not only in the tumor microenvironment but also at the BBB level."

Transmission electron microscopy and electrophoresis revealed that certain CN aggregated, while multispectral analysis indicated that part of CN was fragmented into smaller peptides. The predictive 3D model suggested the disruption of linear epitopes located in the α-helix region might contribute to the reduced allergenicity. The peptide sequences were compared to the linear epitopes predicted by immunoinformatics approaches, revealing some reduction or breakage of key allergic sequences.

Compared with native CS, adding HBP caused CS to denature owing to hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions, and LF-SMF treatment further promoted these changes. During the acidification (pH 7.0-2.0) and coacervation processes, the integration of LF-SMF treatment with the addition of HBP enhanced the rate and extent of casein (CS) aggregation and crosslinking, attributable to alterations in the ζ-potential of CS. Among the formed coacervates, the yield and particle size of CS/HBP complex coacervates after being treated with LF-SMF (M-CS/HBP) increased from 67.9 % to 78.4 % and from 803.12 nm to 1253.43 nm, respectively. Additionally, M-CS/HBP demonstrated improved viscoelasticity and a more uniform, compact microstructure with denser packing. The alterations observed in CS-based coacervates were due to non-covalent interactions between CS and HBP, further promoted by LF-SMF treatment, leading to the unfolding and disordering of protein secondary structure. Consequently, M-CS/HBP complex coacervates demonstrated superior encapsulation efficiency for L. plantarum and provided enhanced protection for probiotics under adverse environments.",

However, the influence of enzymatic hydrolysis on the structural properties of yak casein and its inhibitory effects on xanthine oxidase (XOD) remain largely unexplored. This study demonstrated that when yak casein was subjected to treatment with flavourzyme, the degree of hydrolysis progressively increased over time, resulting in the fragmentation of the casein's flake-like structure into smaller particles. Circular dichroism analysis revealed that after 4 h of enzymatic treatment, there was an elevation in the β-sheet content of the yak casein hydrolysate, while other secondary structure elements diminished. Furthermore, flavourzyme treatment induced modifications in the tertiary structure of yak casein. The study also examined the impact of varying hydrolysis durations on XOD inhibitory activity, discovering that the hydrolysate obtained after 3 h displayed the highest inhibition on XOD, with an inhibition rate of (40.63 ± 3.36) %. Additionally, the fraction of the hydrolysate with a molecular weight exceeding 3 kDa demonstrated enhanced XOD inhibitory activity. This study is the first to investigate how varying hydrolysis durations with flavourzyme affect the structural characteristics of yak casein and its XOD inhibitory activity."

This study compared the efficacy of 660 nm diode laser, 980 nm diode laser, and amorphous calcium phosphate-casein phosphopeptide (ACP-CPP) agent in the treatment of DH. Materials and Methods: A total of 39 patients with minimum three hypersensitive teeth in at least one quadrant were selected and randomly divided into three groups; Group A, B, and C patients were treated by 660 nm diode laser, 980 nm diode laser, and ACP-CPP agent, respectively. All the hypersensitive teeth were stimulated with tactile; thermal and air stimuli, and the pretreatment and posttreatment hypersensitivity scores were evaluated with the numeric rating scale (NRS) at baseline, 30 min, 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months. The Shapiro-Wilk test was used to determine the uniformity of the data. The Chi-square (χ 2) test of significance was used to compare proportions. For intergroup comparison, the Kruskal-Wallis test and the Mann-Whitney U test were utilized. Results: At 30 min and 1 week, the 980 nm laser was more effective than the 660 nm laser, but there was no statistically significant difference between the two groups at 1, 3, and 6 months. Throughout the trial period, the 660 nm and 980 nm diode lasers were more effective than the ACP-CPP agent in lowering DH. Conclusions: 660 nm diode laser, 980 nm diode laser, and ACP-CPP agent showed positive prospective as effective desensitizers when utilized as a clinical procedure."

      "abstract": "The increased demand for plant-based products brings a new challenge to the food industry. Especially, proteins from soy, chickpea, and pea are being highly demanded as food ingredients. However, they still present some drawbacks such as poor techno-functional properties and remarkable beany flavor that hamper their wider application. Contrarily, milk products such as yogurt and cheeses are highly consumed and accepted worldwide. Therefore, the association of plant proteins, such as pea with milk proteins is an interesting strategy to incorporate more plant-based proteins into people's diet. However, this strategy can largely impact gel formation and final structure. This study aims to develop mixed casein micelles (CMs) and pea proteins gel at high concentrations in four protein ratios, 80:20, 60:40, 40:60, and 20:80 by acidification. The effect of a thermal treatment before gelation was also evaluated. The replacement of CMs for pea proteins disturbed the gel formation at the beginning of acidification, demand more time to increase the G*, being this effect more pronounced as more casein is replaced in the system. Despite of this effect, the final gel elasticity was higher in the presence of pea proteins for the ratios 80:20 and 60:40, probably due to the formation of pea network. It is hypothesized that pea proteins can form a network when surrounded by CMs, however, CMs restrict pea proteins aggregation. This study describes that the final characteristics of mixed gels can be tailored by changing protein ratios and applying thermal treatment before acidification, opening the possibility for the development of innovative food products.",

      "abstract": "In PKU, it is suggested that casein glycomacropeptide based protein substitute (GMP) may have physiological advantage when satiety, oxidative stress, renal function and inflammation are considered. Its prebiotic properties may also help gastrointestinal (GI) tolerance. In children with PKU, a randomized/crossover trial comparing phenylalanine-free amino acids (AA) vs GMP as the single source of protein substitute for 12-weeks in each arm was conducted. There was a 4-week wash out period with AA in-between. At baseline and end of each intervention, blood and fecal samples were taken to monitor gut health, oxidative stress, renal function, inflammatory markers and plasma amino acids. Satiety and Pediatric Quality of Life (PedsQL) GI symptoms questionnaires were completed. Usual weekly blood spots for phenylalanine and tyrosine were done. Twelve patients (8 males; aged 4-9y) with PKU participated. GMP improved the following GI symptoms: stomach pain (p = 0.003), heartburn and reflux (p = 0.041) wind and bloating (p = 0.018). With GMP, there was also a trend for less constipation (p = 0.068), discomfort with eating (p = 0.065) and nausea and vomiting (p = 0.087). There were no changes on stool gut health markers (IgA, short chain fatty acids and fecal calprotectin). There were no statistically significant differences for renal, oxidative stress, inflammatory and gut health markers or measures of satiety except for adiponectin (p = 0.028) and total antioxidant capacity (p = 0.049), although the latter was possibly without clinical significance. Mean dried blood spot phenylalanine (Phe) was 114 μmol/L higher with GMP vs AA (p < 0.001). There was no difference in tyrosine levels. In conclusion, GI symptoms statistically significantly improved with GMP versus AA. The Phe content of GMP may present challenges when it is used as the only protein substitute in children with classical PKU with low Phe tolerance.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Milk allergy commonly occurs in children, mainly caused by bovine-derived casein (CAS) protein. Neutrophil-activating protein (NAP) of Helicobacter pylori plays an immunomodulatory role with potential to suppress Th2-type immune responses. Bacillus subtilis (B. subtilis) spores are commonly used as oral vectors for drug delivery. OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether recombinantly expressed NAP on B. subtilis spores could be an effective treatment for CAS allergy in mouse. METHODS: After CAS sensitization, mice were orally administered B. subtilis spores expressing recombinant NAP for 6 weeks. Allergic symptoms and parameters were evaluated after CAS challenge oral gavage, including allergic inflammation, splenic cytokines, and serum-specific antibodies. Protein levels of Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) and c-JUN in the jejunum tissue were measured by western blot. Bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) were stimulated with inactivated NAP spores to measure the influence on cytokine profiles in vitro. RESULTS: NAP recombinant spore treatment significantly reduced allergic symptoms and intestinal inflammation. Interleukin-12 and interferon-gamma levels increased, whereas serum CAS-specific IgG1 and IgE levels decreased. TLR2 and c-JUN expression levels were elevated in the jejunal tissue. Inactivated NAP spores polarized BMDMs to the M1 phenotype and enhanced cytokine expression, which were inhibited by a TLR2 neutralizing antibody. CONCLUSION: NAP offers a new strategy in the treatment of CAS allergy by inhibiting the Th2 response, while eliciting macrophages to promote Th1 immune responses.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Alpha-s1 casein hydrolysate (ACH; Lactium®) is recognized as a supplementary treatment to enhance sleep quality. However, limited studies utilizing objective sleep assessment tools have resulted in a lack of substantial validation. This study aimed to assess the effects of ACH on both subjective sleep assessments and objective polysomnography (PSG) recordings in a hospital-based cohort of Taiwanese individuals with chronic insomnia. METHODS: In this 4-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 36 participants diagnosed with chronic insomnia were enrolled and randomly assigned to either the ACH or placebo groups. Initially, participants in the ACH group received 600 mg of ACH daily, which was reduced to 300 mg for the latter two weeks; the placebo group received maltodextrin capsules throughout the study. The study utilized polysomnography (PSG), along with detailed sleep questionnaires including the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), Global Sleep Disorders Score (GSDS), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), to assess improvements in sleep quality and related health markers. The efficacy of the intervention was assessed through measures of sleep efficiency, stage distribution, and psychological well-being, comparing results from before to after the treatment phase. RESULTS: The study demonstrated that ACH treatment notably enhanced sleep quality, evidenced by significant improvements in ISI, GSDS, PSQI, ESS, and HADS scores at both week 2 and 4 (all p-values <0.05) compared with baseline scores. When compared to the placebo group, the ACH group experienced a marked reduction in GSDS scores over time (p = 0.045). Furthermore, PSG data revealed a significant decrease in sleep onset latency from baseline in the ACH group compared to the placebo group (p = 0.012; -7.7 ± 16.0 min vs. 6.1 ± 17.7 min for ACH and placebo groups, respectively). These results indicate that ACH treatment effectively improved sleep initiation and overall sleep quality. CONCLUSION: ACH Supplementation significantly improved sleep quality, particularly by reducing GSDS scores and sleep onset latency, demonstrating its potential as an effective intervention for chronic insomnia. Future studies with larger samples and exploration of long-term effects are needed to confirm these results.",

However, how leptin influences milk production in lactating mammary glands remains unclear. Also, whether leptin in milk or blood influences mammary epithelial cells (MECs) during lactation needs further investigation. This study investigated the effects of leptin on mouse MECs using a culture model in which MECs produced milk components and formed less permeable tight junctions. Our results showed that β-casein production in MEC was inhibited by leptin in a concentration-dependent manner. Leptin also inactivated the signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5), a transcription factor that facilitates milk production in MECs. Leptin treatment induced the activation of p38 and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) in MEC before STAT5 inactivation, and anisomycin, an activator of p38 and JNK, induced the inactivation of STAT5. Furthermore, leptin exposure on the apical surface of MECs inhibited β-casein production and inactivated STAT5. However, leptin exposure on the basolateral surface hardly caused these effects. These findings suggested that milk leptin, but not plasma leptin, inhibited milk production in MECs.",

We found deficits in reward-based operant learning in AD mice, suggesting possible VTA DA neuron dysregulation. Physiological assessment revealed hyperexcitability and disrupted firing in DA neurons caused by reduced activity of small-conductance calcium-activated potassium (SK) channels. RNA sequencing from contents of single patch-clamped DA neurons (Patch-seq) identified up-regulation of the SK channel modulator casein kinase 2 (CK2), which we corroborated by immunohistochemical protein analysis. Pharmacological inhibition of CK2 restored SK channel activity and normal firing patterns in 3xTg-AD mice. These findings identify a mechanism of ion channel dysregulation in VTA DA neurons that could contribute to behavioral abnormalities in AD, paving the way for novel treatment strategies.",

      "abstract": "Lung cancer remains a leading cause of global cancer‑related deaths, therefore the identification of prognostic factors for lung cancer is critical. Casein kinase 2 alpha (CK2α) is one of the driver kinases in various cancers, and it was previously demonstrated that CK2α localization was associated with a poor prognosis in invasive breast cancer. In the present study, the importance of CK2α in the nucleolus was explored as a potential prognostic marker for surgically resected early‑stage lung adenocarcinoma. The present study included 118 patients who underwent pulmonary lobectomy between 2014 and 2018 in Fukushima Medical University Hospital (Fukushima, Japan), and in whom CK2α localization in tumor samples was assessed by immunohistochemistry. Patient and tumor characteristics, including pathological stage, histological type and histological grade, were analyzed. Recurrence‑free survival (RFS) and overall survival were evaluated in relation to nucleolar CK2α staining. CK2α staining in the nucleoli was observed in 50.8% of lung adenocarcinoma tumors. Positive nucleolar CK2α staining was independent of pathological stage, histological type and histological grade. Patients with positive nucleolar CK2α staining exhibited significantly worse RFS compared with patients with negative staining. Multivariate analysis identified nucleolar CK2α staining and lymph node metastasis as independent poor prognostic factors. The results of the present study suggested that nucleolar CK2α staining is a novel and independent prognostic factor in surgically resected early‑stage lung adenocarcinoma. These findings indicated the potential of nucleolar CK2α as a predictive biomarker for future recurrence, and a guide to treatment decisions. Further research is required, particularly in understanding the molecular mechanisms linking nucleolar CK2α to recurrence.",

Here, we report on the results of the phase 1 clinical trial of BTX-A51 in patients with relapsed or refractory AML and MDS. Thirty-one patients were enrolled into 8 dose-escalation cohorts at BTX-A51 doses ranging from 1mg to 42mg dosed three days/week for 21 or 28 days out a 28-day cycle. The recommended phase 2 dose was 21mg dosed three days/week for 4 weeks of a 28-day cycle. BTX-A51 increased expression of p53 and reduced expression of MCL1 and RNA polymerase II phosphorylation on pre- and post-treatment immunocytochemistry studies. Overall, 3 patients (10%) experienced complete remission with incomplete count recovery (CRi). All 3 responding patients had RUNX1 mutations and the CR/CRi rate for RUNX1-mutated patients receiving BTX-A51 at efficacious doses (11mg or higher) was 30%. Ex-vivo studies confirmed higher efficacy of BTX-A51 on RUNX1-mutated myeloblasts and demonstrate synergy with azacitidine and venetoclax. Although the overall efficacy was modest, this study lays the groundwork for future studies with improved patient selection and combination approaches."

      "abstract": "Overall response rates in advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) remains low. Thus, novel molecular targets, tailored drugs and/or drug combinations are needed. Casein Kinase-2 (CK2) is a constitutively active and frequently over-expressed enzyme which fosters tumor survival, proliferation and metastasis. By using a clinical-grade and Cell Penetrating Peptide-based inhibitor coined as CIGB-300, we explore the anti-neoplastic effects caused by interruption of CK2 signaling in lung cancer cells lacking EGFR, ALK and ROS mutations. CIGB-300 penetrated and impaired viability and proliferation of Lung Adenocarcinoma (LUAD) (A549, NCI-H522) and Lung Squamous Carcinoma (LUSC) (NCI-H226 and SK-MES-1) cells in a dose-response manner. The differential activity could not be explained by overall peptide uptake or its subcellular distribution, as evidenced by flow cytometry and confocal microscopy. Upon internalization, CIGB-300 interacted with CK2 catalytic subunits (ɑ1/ɑ2) and CK2 substrates, thus impairing phosphorylation of enzyme substrates (CDC37s13, NPM1s125) and downstream proteins (RPS6s325/326). CK2 inhibition induced an early Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) and mitochondrial membrane depolarization, which predates lung cancer cell death. Finally, intravenous injection of CIGB-300 in a cell line-based xenograft corroborated CIGB-300's anti-tumor effects and suggested concurrent in situ reductions of CSNK2ɑ subunit and downstream RPS6s235/236 phosphorylation. Overall, CIGB-300 therapeutic hypothesis and antineoplastic effects demonstrated herein, further support the evaluation of this clinical-grade CK2 inhibitor in advanced NSCLC with limited therapeutic options.",

      "abstract": "With the increasing prevalence of electronic devices, awareness of the risks linked to blue light exposure has significantly heightened. Lutein, a powerful antioxidant, safeguards eye tissue by filtering blue light, while supplementation with docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) enhances retinal function. Adequate intake of these nutrients can help reduce the potential damage from prolonged blue light exposure. The protective effects of lutein and algal oil stabilized with Pickering emulsion were investigated using casein-dextran (CD) conjugates via Maillard reaction. Microstructural analysis revealed a three-dimensional network structure surrounding oil droplets formed by CD conjugates. With the increase of the oil phase ratio from 55 % to 80 %, the average size of Pickering emulsion droplets decreased. Pickering emulsion demonstrated higher viscoelasticity, excellent recovery, thixotropy, and good thermal stability as the oil phase ratio increased. The retention of lutein in CD-75 % Pickering emulsions showed significant improvement under various conditions. Simulated gastrointestinal digestion demonstrated that CD-75 % Pickering emulsions effectively enhanced the lutein bioaccessibility from 19.97 % to 48.99 %. In vivo experiments showed that lutein-loaded Pickering emulsion could effectively relieve blue light-induced retinal degeneration in mice. These findings suggested that Pickering emulsion can serve as a delivery system to protect lutein, offering a nutritional intervention to mitigate blue light-induced retinal degeneration.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: This in situ study aimed to evaluate a new toothpaste formulation containing fluoride (F), casein phosphopeptide amorphous calcium phosphate (CPP-ACP) and sodium trimetaphosphate (TMP) on the process of dental demineralization and biofilm composition. METHODS: This crossover double-blind study consisted of five phases, in which 10 volunteers wore intraoral appliances containing four bovine enamel specimens. The cariogenic challenge was performed using 30 % sucrose solution. Blocks were treated 3 ×/day with the following toothpastes: 1) Placebo (No F-TMP-CPP-ACP), 2) 1100 ppm F (1100F), 3) 1100F + 3 %TMP (1100F-TMP), 4) 1100F + 10 %CPP-ACP (1100F-CPP-ACP) and 5) 1100F-CPP-ACP-TMP. After 7 days, the percentage loss of surface hardness (%SH), integrated loss of subsurface hardness (ΔKHN), F, calcium (Ca) and phosphorus (P) concentration in the enamel was determined. The concentration of F, Ca, P and insoluble extracellular polysaccharide (EPS) in the biofilm were analyzed. RESULTS: The addition of CPP-ACP-TMP to 1100F reduced %SH by 42 % and 39 % when compared to the 1100F and 1100F-CPP-ACP (p < 0.001); in addition, to a reduction in lesion body (ΔKHN) by 36 % for the same treatments. The treatment with 1100F-CPP-ACP-TMP led to a significant increase in the concentration of F, P and Ca in the enamel and biofilm, and reduced the concentration of EPS (p < 0.001). SIGNIFICANCE: Toothpaste formulation containing 1100F-CPP-ACP-TMP prevented the reduction of enamel hardness and significantly influenced the ionic biochemical composition and insoluble extracellular polysaccharide (EPS) in biofilm formed in situ. These results are promising and provide valuable insights for the design of further clinical trials.",

When applying pressures ranging from 100 to 500 MPa for 30 min at 25 ± 2°C, it was observed that BMCC exhibited a notable increase in soluble minerals and solubility percentages with a simultaneous reduction in particle size and zeta potential compared with CMCC. In BMCC, Ca and P solubility rose from 27.71% and 33.02% to 90.33% and 92.01%, respectively. In CMCC, the solubility of Ca and P increased from 36.12% and 38.29% at 100 MPa to 52.57% and 56.77% at 500 MPa. Additionally, the reduction in particle size was more pronounced in BMCC, with a 53% decrease at 500 MPa, compared with a 19.90% reduction in CMCC. Furthermore, fluorescence intensity, indicative of surface hydrophobicity, decreased in BMCC samples (from 3,478 to 2,571 arbitrary units [a.u.]), whereas it increased in CMCC samples (from 2,388 to 4,058 a.u.) across the same pressure range. Comparative analysis revealed that HPP-treated CMCC samples exhibited a decline in α-helix content until the treatment at 300 MPa, followed by an increase post-treatment at 500 MPa. Additionally, a rise in β-sheet structure content was observed, except for the sample treated at 500 MPa, where β-sheet content significantly decreased. These findings suggest that HPP holds promise as a viable technological approach in the dairy sector for enhancing the functional characteristics of CMCC.",

Numerous non-invasive techniques have been extensively researched to effectively manage WSLs. The objective of this study was to investigate the efficacy of MI varnish application, diode laser irradiation and their combination on remineralization of WSLs. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this in vitro study, 40 enamel samples were divided randomly into 4 groups based on the applied treatment after demineralization. In Group I, MI varnish was applied to the enamel samples for a period of 7 days. In Group II, samples were irradiated with diode laser. In Group III, MI varnish was applied for 7 days, followed by diode laser irradiation. Whereas Group IV (control group) received no treatment and samples were stored in artificial saliva for 7 days. Microhardness assessments were performed at baseline, after demineralization and following the different treatment protocols. A representative sample from each group was randomly selected for scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis. One-way ANOVA, repeated measures ANOVA, and Tukey's Post Hoc tests were used for statistical analysis, with significance set at P≤0.05. RESULTS: All treatment groups demonstrated significantly higher mean microhardness values compared to the control group (P<0.05). Group 1 (MI varnish) had a final microhardness mean value of 193.50 (P<0.001), Group 2 (diode laser) recorded the highest final mean of 214.20 (P=0.018), and Group 3 (MI varnish+diode laser) had a mean of 203.93 (P=0.011). SEM observations supported these findings by showing enhanced surface morphology in the treatment groups. CONCLUSIONS: MI varnish application, laser irradiation, and their combination demonstrated enhanced microhardness of artificially demineralized enamel, highlighting their effectiveness in remineralization of WSLs.",

      "abstract": "The use of low-concentration-factor ultrafiltered (LCF-UF) milk for cheesemaking has become popular in recent years. Research on using LCF-UF milk to make low-moisture part-skim (LMPS) mozzarella manufacture is limited due to concerns about the negative effect of the higher CN content on functional properties, such as melt and stretch. Pre-acidification (PA; reflects acid added to milk before the addition of the starter culture) has been used in low- and nonfat mozzarella cheeses to lower calcium levels and improve their texture and melting properties. We explored the use of PA to reduce the insoluble calcium content of cheese (calcium that is a crosslinking material for the CN proteins) and its effect on the functionality of LMPS mozzarella made from high-CN (4.2%) milk. Seven vats of LMPS mozzarella, with a control (no PA), 2 pH values for PA (6.40 and 6.00) and 3 different acidification methods (use of acetic, citric, or carbonic acid from carbon dioxide) were evaluated for their effect on solubilization of colloidal calcium phosphate during LMPS manufacture. Composition, proteolysis, and microstructural and functional changes in the LMPS cheeses were monitored during 90 d of refrigerated storage. All cheeses had similar composition except for the cheese made with milk PA with carbonic acid, which had a lower fat-in-dry matter, probably due to foaming observed in this sample during the gas sparging. The cheese made with milk PA with citric acid to pH 6.00 had the lowest amount of total and insoluble calcium compared with other cheeses at all steps during cheese manufacture and storage, likely due to the calcium chelating ability of citric acid. The cheese that was made with milk PA with citric acid to pH 6.40 had a trend of slightly lower (not significant) total and insoluble calcium during cheese manufacture compared with other cheeses that were made with milk PA to pH 6.40. The pH value in all the cheeses remained similar throughout 90 d of storage, whereas the cheese that was made with milk PA with citric acid to pH 6.00 had the lowest pH values during storage. Treatment significantly affected instrumental hardness, the maximum loss tangent during heating, the melting temperature, and the storage modulus values measured at 70°C. Proteolysis was not affected by treatment, suggesting that typical aging should occur. Cheese that was PA with citric acid to pH 6.00 initially had lower maximum loss tangent values and higher hardness, possibly due to the lower pH value of this cheese. The performance of cheeses on pizza was assessed using the Sensory Spectrum method and quantitative descriptive analysis. The PA of cheese milk with citric acid helped to reduce the insoluble Ca level and at 30 and 90 d of storage, these cheeses had lower first chew hardness, lower chewiness, and lower strand thickness values compared with other cheeses. The use of PA could help improve the functionality of LMPS mozzarella made from milk high in CN, with citric acid being the most efficient in dissolving the insoluble calcium from CN.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Various topical gels, varnishes, and fluoride gels are being used by dentists for the treatment of White spot lesions (WSLs). The remineralizing effect of casein phosphopeptide-amorphous calcium phosphate (CPP-ACP), nano-hydroxyapatite (nHAp), and lasers has been proven earlier. This study was designed to evaluate the remineralizing effect of nHAp and CPP-ACP with and without erbium-doped yttrium aluminum garnet (Er: YAG) laser irradiation on demineralized primary enamel. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of CPP-ACP and nHAp with and without Er:YAG laser irradiation on the microhardness and surface morphology of demineralized primary enamel. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The present study is an experimental in vitro study. Fifty extracted primary incisors were selected for the study. Following cleaning and sectioning, teeth were embedded in acrylic. The tooth models were divided into four groups randomly - Group 1 (CPP-ACP), Group 2 (nHAp), Group 3 (CPP-ACP + laser), and Group 4 (nHAp + laser). The baseline, postdemineralization, and postremineralization Vickers hardness testing was performed. One sample from each group was analyzed by scanning electron microscopy. Descriptive statistics such as frequencies and percentages for categorical data, mean and standard deviation for numerical data were depicted. The normality of numerical data was checked using the Shapiro-Wilk test. The level of significance was kept at 5%. Intergroup comparison (>2 groups) was done using one-way analysis of variance followed by pair-wise comparison using the post hoc test. RESULTS: There was a statistically significant increase in surface microhardness in each group after remineralization. The highest increase in microhardness value was seen in Group 4 (nHAp + laser) followed by Group 3 (CPP-ACP + laser) and the least in Group 1 (CPP-ACP). Similar observations were made in scanning electron microscopic images. This indicated that nHAp has a comparable, if not better ability for remineralization than CPP-ACP. The remineralizing capacity of both the remineralizing agents was seen to be improved in this study when simultaneous laser application was employed. CONCLUSION: Currently, the evidence supporting the efficacy of nHAp dentifrices and laser in primary teeth is limited. Additional long-term in vivo studies employing standardized protocols and large sample sizes are necessary to draw definitive findings about the effect of remineralizing agents and lasers on primary enamel."

After 16 weeks of LL diet administration, mice exhibited a nonobese nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NONAFLD) phenotype, characterized by reduced body weight gain, hypolipidemia, and intrahepatic lipid accumulation. Nontarget metabolomic analysis showed that casein-bound LL induced alterations in plasma levels of compounds associated with lipid degradation. Mechanistically, casein-bound LL may impair the function of 5'-adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase and apolipoprotein B100 by inducing dicarbonyl stress, thereby promoting carbonyl glycation in the liver. Consequently, the long-term consumption of LL-rich dairy products may be a contributing factor to the risk of developing NONAFLD."

However, the clinical compatibility of DAU is limited due to its lack of specificity and its highly toxic effects, which interfere with normal cells. This toxicity can be reduced with nanocarriers and targeted drug delivery systems. In this study, to develop the drug delivery of DAU, the surface of synthesized nanoparticles was modified by folic acid to target cancer cells optimally. Encapsulation of DAU in protein sodium caseinate (NaCAS) was done by adding calcium ions to bring the casein (CAS) in the solution to a micellar structure to synthesize dense nanoparticles. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy transmission, fluorescence spectroscopy, UV-Vis spectroscopy, field emission scanning electron microscopy, and zeta potential studies designed and distinguished the synthesized nanocomplexes. The results showed that CAS nanoparticles successfully encapsulated DAU, and the protein surface was targeted by folic acid. Light scattering analysis determined that the particles with a scattering index number of 306.0 and an average size of 8.117 nm were synthesized. The zeta potential of CAS micelles is more harmful than CAS nanoparticles. This is because calcium ions are added during the formation of CAS nanoparticles during the drug-loading stages. These studies prove that the synthesized \"NaCAS-DAU\" and \"NaCAS-DAU-folic acid\" complexes can be favorable carriers in the targeted drug delivery of cancer drugs.",

Adherence to dietary management of NTBC-induced tyrosinemia, a low-protein diet with or without protein substitutes, can be difficult for patients. This 28-day interventional study evaluated a low tyrosine casein glycomacropeptide (cGMP) protein substitute (TYR sphere)®, a 20 g protein equivalent, cGMP-based protein substitute, in terms of adherence, palatability, usability, comparison to amino acid (AA)-based protein substitutes, gastrointestinal tolerance and metabolic control in adults with NTBC-induced tyrosinaemia. METHODS: Four adults (mean 61.1 years, range 53.3-69.3 years) with AKU and NTBC-induced tyrosinaemia were recruited from the United Kingdom National Alkaptonuria Centre (NAC). The cGMP protein substitute was prescribed based on individual nutritional requirements, replacing ≥1 AA-based protein substitute. Participants recorded product-related data in study diaries, using five-point Likert scales and daily and weekly logs. To determine metabolic control, prestudy blood tyrosine levels were compared to weekly blood spot tests during the study. RESULTS: Median cGMP protein substitute adherence was 98%. Most participants rated palatability and usability positively, and preferred cGMP protein substitute to AA-based products. There were no notable gastrointestinal changes, and metabolic control was maintained. CONCLUSIONS: cGMP protein substitute is a palatable and well-tolerated option in the dietary management of AKU patients with NTBC-induced tyrosinaemia.",

      "abstract": "In dairy-based imitation mozzarella cheese (IMC) formulations, intact casein is critical and imparts IMC with a firm and elastic, stringy, melted texture. Rennet casein (RCN) is the desired ingredient to provide intact casein in IMC and is preferred over milk protein concentrate (MPC) and micellar casein concentrate (MCC). Transglutaminase (TGase), a crosslinking enzyme, alters the physical properties of MPC or MCC and may change IMC functionality. The objective of this study was to determine the effect of TGase-crosslinked MPC and MCC powders on the functionality of IMCs. The TGase treatment included TGase at 0.3 (L) and 3.0 (H) units/g of protein and a control (C) with no TGase addition. Each IMC formulation was balanced for constituents and was produced in a Rapid Visco Analyzer (RVA). The MCC or MPC powder with high TGase enzyme in IMC formulation did not form an emulsion. The IMC containing TGase-treated powders had a significantly (p ≤ 0.05) higher RVA-viscosity during manufacture and transition temperature (TT), and a significantly (p ≤ 0.05) lower Schreiber melt test area. The IMC made from MPC (with or without TGase) had lower TT values and Schreiber melt test area as compared with that made from MCC. The TGase-treated MPC and MCC, when used for IMC manufacture, were comparable to IMC manufactured with RCN in texture and some measured melted characteristics. In conclusion, TGase treatment alters the melt characteristics of MCC and MPC in IMC applications."

Protein aggregation can inter alia occur via nonreducible covalent cross-links derived from either Maillard or dehydroalanine (DHA) pathways. To study this further in relation to processing method and lactase enzyme purity, LHM was produced using 3 different lactase preparations, with lactase enzymes added in a dairy setting either before (prehydrolysis) or after (posthydrolysis) UHT treatment. The prepared LHM types were subsequently stored at either 25°C or 35°C for up to one year. Mass spectrometry was used to absolutely quantify the level of furosine, N-ε-(carboxymethyl)lysine, N-ε-(carboxyethyl)lysine, lanthionine, and lysinoalanine in these products using a newly developed method on triple quadrupole for these processing-induced markers. The results showed higher levels of Maillard-related processing markers in prehydrolyzed LHM compared with posthydrolyzed LHM and conventional UHT milk, which, on the other hand, contained higher concentrations of DHA-derived cross-links. Proteomics of collected particles from asymmetrical flow field-flow fractionation in combination with gel electrophoresis indicated the presence of intramicellar cross-links during storage, especially for larger particles involving αS1- and αS2-caseins.",

This study aimed to evaluate the effect of cheese and casein phosphopeptide-amorphous calcium phosphate (CPP-ACP) on erosive lesions of primary teeth enamel following exposure to amoxicillin and ibuprofen syrups. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this in vitro study, 60 noncarious deciduous molars were used. After measuring the surface microhardness of the samples, they were randomly separated into two groups and immersed in either amoxicillin or ibuprofen for 1 min three times per day. CPP-ACP, cheese, and artificial saliva were then applied to each of the three subgroups (n = 10). After each immersion time, 10 min of therapy was given. Between treatment intervals, the samples were kept in artificial saliva. The microhardness was remeasured after 1 week. Data were analyzed using SPSS software through repeated-measures ANOVA (α = 0.05). RESULTS: All samples' microhardness reduced considerably after immersion in liquid pharmaceuticals (amoxicillin [84.9 kgf/mm2] and ibuprofen [75.1 kgf/mm2]), but increased significantly following exposure to therapeutic solutions. There was no difference between the amoxicillin-cheese and amoxicillin-CPP-ACP subgroups (P = 0.975). A statistically insignificant difference was found between the ibuprofen group and the ibuprofen-CPP-ACP subgroup (P = 0.499). CONCLUSION: As a result, cheese and CPP-ACP can be utilized to remineralize erosive lesions caused by amoxicillin or ibuprofen exposure."

In this work, we prepared Na-caseinate coated magnetic nanoparticles (MNP) to assess their capability as a theranostic system. This system enables monitoring by magnetic particle imaging (MPI), drug delivery and magnetic hyperthermia. MNP were synthesized in a continuous flow, coated with Na-caseinate and enzymatically crosslinked with transglutaminase to increase their colloidal stability and enable drug loading. They were investigated concerning their magnetic behaviour by DC magnetization measurements (DCM), magnetic particle spectroscopy (MPS) and AC-magnetometry to evaluate their suitability for MPI and hyperthermia. Further, their stability in different salt solutions as well as their encapsulation efficiency with a hydrophobic model drug (nile red), cell viability and uptake were investigated. Our results show that the Na-caseinate coating of MNP marginally effects the magnetic behaviour of the MNP with a consistent magnetization saturation M S of 109(5) A m2 per kg(Fe) for uncoated and casein coated MNP and with a decrease of <15% of A 3*, but only a slight decrease of 2% of A 5/A 3 for Na-caseinate coated MNP. Furthermore, the Na-caseinate coating of MNP increased their salt stability, under unchanged magnetic behaviour. Drug loading (up to ∼75%) and release kinetics such as the delivery into cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma cells (SCL-1) was shown. Our results demonstrate that casein coated MNP are highly promising candidates for theranostic applications in drug delivery, magnetic hyperthermia and magnetic particle imaging."

      "abstract": "Pasta filata-style cheese products are among the world's most famous cheese varieties. Thermo-mechanical processing of cheese curd results in stringy, fibrous, and anisotropic structures with pleasing texture attributes. A recent area of research focuses on improving yield during the manufacturing of pasta filata-type cheese products by homogenizing the milk. This process reduces the size of fat droplets, leading to better retention of milk fat during curd plasticization. As this sometimes results in texture deficits, this study aims to investigate the impact of thermo-mechanical processing on curd from homogenized and non-homogenized milk. The hypothesis is that increased thermo-mechanical processing, leading to more anisotropic structural elements, may offset texture deficits caused by homogenization. To assess textural and structural changes due to homogenization and thermo-mechanical processing, mechanical tests including rheology and texture analysis were conducted, along with confocal-laser-scanning microscopy. Additionally, sensory evaluation involving panelists consuming the samples and recording mastication properties such as muscle activity and jaw movement was carried out. Dynamic data modeling was used to derive connections between structure and texture. Results showed that homogenization alone did not yield significant differences between the samples, but plasticization and texturization properties differed significantly. Non-homogenized samples developed a distinct fibrous structure, and muscle activities and jaw movements increased significantly (p < 0.01) with longer thermo-mechanical processing.",

      "abstract": "We previously demonstrated that postruminal casein infusion and exogenous glucagon-like peptide 2 (GLP-2) administration independently stimulated growth and carbohydrase activity of the pancreas and jejunal mucosa in cattle. The objective of the current study was to profile the jejunal mucosal transcriptome of cattle using next-generation RNA sequencing in response to postruminal casein infusion and exogenous GLP-2. Twenty-four Holstein steers [250 ± 23.1 kg body weight (BW)] received a continuous abomasal infusion of 3.94 g raw corn starch/kg of BW combined with either 0 or 1.30 g casein/kg of BW for 7 d. Steers received subcutaneous injections at 0800 and 2000 h to provide either 0 or 100 μg GLP-2/kg of BW per day. At the end of the 7-d treatment period, steers were slaughtered for collection of the jejunal mucosa. Total RNA was extracted from jejunal mucosal tissue, strand-specific cDNA libraries were prepared, and RNA sequencing was conducted to generate 150-bp paired-end reads at a depth of 40 M reads per sample. Differentially expressed genes (DEG), KEGG pathway enrichment, and gene ontology enrichment were determined based on the FDR-corrected P-value (padj). Exogenous GLP-2 administration upregulated (padj < 0.05) 667 genes and downregulated 1,101 genes of the jejunal mucosa. Sphingolipid metabolism, bile secretion, adherens junction, and galactose metabolism were among the top KEGG pathways enriched with upregulated DEG (padj < 0.05) in response to exogenous GLP-2 administration. The top gene ontologies enriched with upregulated DEG (padj < 0.05) in response to exogenous GLP-2 administration included nutrient metabolic processes, brush border and bicellular tight junction assembly, and enzyme and transporter activities. Exogenous GLP-2 administration increased or tended to increase (padj < 0.10) brush border carbohydrase (MGAM, LCT, TREH), hexose transporter (SLC5A1, SLC2A2), and associated transcription factor (HNF1, GATA4, KAT2B) mRNA expression of the jejunal mucosa. Gene ontologies and KEGG pathways that were downregulated (padj < 0.05) in response to exogenous GLP-2 were related to genetic information processing. Postruminal casein infusion downregulated (padj < 0.05) 7 jejunal mucosal genes that collectively did not result in enriched KEGG pathways or gene ontologies. This study highlights some of the transcriptional mechanisms associated with increased growth, starch assimilation capacity, and barrier function of the jejunal mucosa in response to exogenous GLP-2 administration.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: To synthesize casein enzymatic hydrolysate (CEH)-laden gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA) fibrous scaffolds and evaluate the cytocompatibility and anti-inflammatory effects on dental pulp stem cells (DPSCs). MATERIALS AND METHODS: GelMA fibrous scaffolds with 10%, 20%, and 30% CEH (w/w) and without CEH (control) were obtained via electrospinning. Chemo-morphological, degradation, and mechanical analyses were conducted to evaluate the morphology and composition of the fibers, mass loss, and mechanical properties, respectively. Adhesion/spreading and viability of DPSCs seeded on the scaffolds were also assessed. The anti-inflammatory potential on DPSCs was tested after the chronic challenge of cells with lipopolysaccharides (LPS), followed by treatment with extracts obtained after immersing the scaffolds in α-MEM. The synthesis of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6, IL-1α, and TNF-α was measured by ELISA. Data were analyzed by ANOVA/post-hoc tests (α = 5%). RESULTS: CEH-laden electrospun fibers had a larger diameter than pure GelMA (p ≤ 0.036). GelMA scaffolds laden with 20% and 30% CEH had a greater mass loss. Tensile strength was reduced for the 10% CEH fibers (p = 0.0052), whereas no difference was observed for the 20% and 30% fibers (p ≥ 0.6736) compared to the control. Young's modulus decreased with CEH (p < 0.0001). Elongation at break increased for the 20% and 30% CEH scaffolds (p ≤ 0.0038). Over time, DPSCs viability increased across all groups, indicating cytocompatibility, with CEH-laden scaffolds exhibiting greater cell viability after seven days (p ≤ 0.0166). Also, 10% CEH-GelMA scaffolds decreased the IL-6, IL-1α, and TNF-α synthesis (p ≤ 0.035). CONCLUSION: CEH-laden GelMA scaffolds facilitated both adhesion and proliferation of DPSCs, and 10% CEH provided anti-inflammatory potential after chronic LPS challenge. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: CEH incorporated in GelMA fibrous scaffolds demonstrated the potential to be used as a cytocompatible and anti-inflammatory biomaterial for vital pulp therapy.",

To be effective, the modification must be performed in the presence of 0.5 M urea, as the enzyme was not inhibited under standard conditions, very likely because the catalytic Cys was not fully exposed to the medium. Activity could be fully recovered by incubation with 1 M mercaptoethanol. This biocatalyst could hydrolyze hemoglobin and casein. The objective of this paper was to increase the enzyme specificity versus small proteins by generating steric hindrances to the access of large proteins. The step by step blocking via ionic exchange of the biocatalyst with aminated bovine serum albumin (BSA), aldehyde dextran and a second layer of aminated BSA produced a biocatalyst that maintained its activity versus small synthetic substrates, increased the biocatalyst stability, while reduced its activity to over 50 % versus casein. Interestingly, this treatment almost fully annulled the activity versus hemoglobin, more effectively at 37 °C than at 55 °C. The biocatalyst could be reused 5 times without changes in activity. The changes could be caused by steric hindrances, but it cannot be discarded some changes in enzyme sequence specificity caused by the modifications.",

Herein, the dynamic interaction between β-Lg and casein micelles during UHT processing was investigated by experimental techniques and molecular dynamics simulations. Results showed that β-Lg decreased the stability of casein micelles, increased their size and zeta potential. Raman and FTIR spectra analysis suggested that hydrogen and disulfide bonds facilitated their interaction. Cryo-TEM showed that the formation of the casein micelle/β-Lg complex involved rigid binding, flexible linking, and severe cross-linking aggregation during UHT processing. SAXS and MST demonstrated β-Lg bound to κ-casein on micelle surfaces with a dissociation constant (Kd) of 3.84 ± 1.14 μm. Molecular docking and dynamic simulations identified the interacting amino acid residues and clarified that electrostatic and van der Waals forces drove the interaction. UHT treatment increased hydrogen bonds and decreased total binding energy. The non-covalent binding promoted the formation of disulfide bonds between β-Lg and casein micelles under heat treatment. Ultimately, it was concluded that non-covalent interaction and disulfide bonding resulted in casein micelle/β-Lg aggregates. These findings provided scientific insights into protein aggregation in UHT milk.",

Piperine (PIP) is an alkaloid with antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and neuroprotective activities; however, poor therapeutic efficacy limits its further use. The current study focuses on the enhanced therapeutic potential of PIP@CM against an experimental zebrafish model of HD. PIP@CM was fabricated using spray drying technology, followed by solid-state investigations. We performed in vitro release and in vitro antioxidant activity (DPPH assay) of PIP and PIP@CMs. In addition, in vivo studies were conducted on zebrafish using 3-nitropropionic acid (3-NPA) (60 mg/kg) as a neurotoxin and treated with PIP (5 mg/kg) and PIP@CM (25 mg/kg equivalent to 5 mg/kg PIP). After dosing, various in vivo studies (behavioral, biochemical, and histological) were conducted. The solid-state characterization techniques revealed the loss of crystallinity after micelles formation. In vitro release and antioxidant assays showed higher release and enhanced activity of PIP@CM. In vivo studies revealed that 3-NPA administration causes HD, as evidenced by the results of open field test (OFT) and novel tank diving test (NTD) tests. Moreover, 3-NPA causes an increase in oxidative stress, as confirmed by biochemical and histopathological studies. PIP@CM treatment significantly improved behavioral performance in OFT and NTD tests and reduced oxidative stress markers as compared to pure PIP and untreated HD model.",

      "abstract": "Smoking during lactation harmfully affects the amount and constituents of breast milk. Infants who consume breast milk containing miR-210-5p may have a higher risk of brain-related diseases. We investigated whether smoking during lactation decreases β-casein concentrations in milk and whether miR-210-5p expression is involved in smoking-induced β-casein suppression. During lactation, maternal CD1 mice were exposed to cigarette smoke (1.7 mg of tar and 14 mg of nicotine) in a smoke chamber for 1 h twice/day for five consecutive days. Control mice were placed in an air-filled chamber equivalent in size to the smoke chamber, with maternal separation times identical to those of the smoked mice. Maternal exposure to smoke during lactation significantly decreased β-casein expression in the mammary epithelia of smoked mice compared to that of the control mice. Signal transducer and activator transcription 5 (STAT5) and phosphorylated STAT5 (pSTAT5) are transcription factors involved in β-casein expression. In the mammary epithelia of smoked mice, the pSTAT5 and STAT5 levels were significantly lower, and miR-210-5p expression was significantly higher than that of the control mice. The β-casein, pSTAT5, and STAT5 protein levels of miR-210-5p mimic-transfected human mammary epithelial MCF-12A cells were significantly lower than those of control siRNA-transfected cells. These results indicate that smoke exposure led to an increase in miR-210-5p expression in mammary epithelium and a decrease in pSTAT5 and β-casein protein levels through the inhibition of STAT5 expression. Moreover, nicotine treatment decreased β-casein protein levels and increased miR-210-5p expression in non-malignant human mammary epithelial MCF-12A cells in a concentration-dependent manner, demonstrating that nicotine significantly affects the β-casein and miR-210-5p levels of breast milk. These results highlight the adverse effects of smoking on breast milk, providing essential information for healthcare professionals and general citizens."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: In the realm of sports science, nutrition is a well-established pillar for athletes' training, performance, and post-workout recovery. However, the role of gut microbiota, often overlooked, is a novel and intriguing aspect that can significantly impact athletic performance. With this in mind, our study ventures into uncharted territory, investigating the effect of probiotic and casein supplementation on the aerobic capacity of male soccer players. METHOD: A double-blinded and placebo-controlled study was conducted with 44 male soccer players (Age: 22.81 ± 2.76 yr, Height: 177.90 ± 6.75 cm, Weight: 67.42 ± 8.44 kg). The participants were subjected to the Bruce test in the beginning; then, they were randomly divided into four groups, each consisting of 11 people: probiotics (PRO), casein (CAS), probiotics with casein (PRO+CAS), and placebo (PLA). PRO group was given one probiotic capsule (containing strains of Lactiplantibacillus plantarum BP06, Lacticaseibacillus casei BP07, Lactobacillus acidophilus BA05, Lactobacillus delbrueckii BD08 bulgaricus, Bifidobacterium infantis BI04, Bifidobacterium longum BL03, Bifidobacterium breve BB02 and Streptococcus salivarius thermophilus BT01, with a total dose of 4.5 × 1011 CFU) during dinner, while the CAS group consumed 20 grams of casein powder 45 minutes before bed. The PRO+CAS group was given one probiotic capsule during dinner and 20 grams of casein powder 45 minutes before bed. The participants in the PLA group were given one red capsule (containing 5 grams of starch) during dinner. All participants were instructed to take the supplements only on training days, three times a week for four weeks. The maximal oxygen consumption (VO2max), Ventilatory Threshold (VT), Time-to-exhaustion (TTE), Respiratory Compensation Point (RCP), Isocapnic area Time (Time-IC), Isocapnic area oxygen consumption (VO2-IC), and Hypocapnic Hyperventilation area Time (Time-HHV), after the Bruce test were Measured. All data were analyzed using SPSS Windows software, mixed repeated measure ANOVA, and Bonferroni post hoc test at p < 0.05 level. RESULTS: The current study's findings illustrated that, after the intervention, TTE (p = 0.01) and RCP (p = 0.01) were significantly improved in PRO+CAS compared to the PLA group. No significant difference was observed between PRO and PLA (p = 0.52), PRO and CAS (p = 0.999), PRO and PRO+CAS (p = 0.9), CAS and PLA (p = 0.65), CAS and PRO+CAS (p = 0.73) in TTE. In addition, no significant difference was observed between PRO and CAS (p = 0.999), PRO and PLA (p = 0.40), PRO and PRO+CAS (p = 0.999), CAS and PLA (p = 0.263), CAS and PRO+CAS (p = 0.999) in RCP. Time-HHV was significantly higher in PRO+CAS (p = 0.000) and CAS (p = 0.047) compared to the PLA group. However, no significant difference was observed in the Time-HHV between PRO and CAS (p = 0.999), PRO and PRO+CAS (p = 0.25), PRO and PLA (p = 0.12), and CAS and PRO+CAS (p = 0.57). Additionally, all the groups had no significant differences in VO2max, VT1, VO2-IC and Time-IC. CONCLUSION: The findings showed that consuming probiotics and casein could relatively improve the aerobic capacity of male soccer players. Nevertheless, simultaneous consumption of probiotics and casein had a more pronounced effect on aerobic capacity indicators, especially TTE and Time-HHV.",

      "abstract": "The androgen receptor (AR) is a key driver of prostate cancer (PCa) and, as such, current mainstay treatments target this molecule. However, resistance commonly arises to these therapies and, therefore, additional targets must be evaluated to improve patient outcomes. Consequently, alternative approaches for indirectly targeting the AR are sought. AR crosstalk with other signalling pathways, including several protein kinase signalling cascades, has been identified as a potential route to combat therapy resistance. The casein kinase 1 (CK1) family of protein kinases phosphorylate a multitude of substrates, allowing them to regulate a diverse range of pathways from the cell cycle to DNA damage repair. As well as its role in several signalling pathways that are de-regulated in PCa, mutational data suggest its potential to promote prostate carcinogenesis. CK1α is one isoform predicted to regulate AR activity via phosphorylation and has been implicated in the progression of several other cancer types. In this review, we explore how the normal biological function of CK1 is de-regulated in cancer, the impact on signalling pathways and how this contributes towards prostate tumourigenesis, with a particular focus on the CK1α isoform as a novel therapeutic target for PCa."

While tumors can be surgically removed and treated with chemotherapy, radiotherapy, immunotherapy, hormonal therapy, or combined therapies, current treatments often result in toxic side effects in normal tissue. Therefore, researchers are actively seeking ways to selectively eliminate cancerous cells, minimizing the toxic side effects in normal tissue. Caseins and its derivatives have shown promising anti-cancer potential, demonstrating antitumor and cytotoxic effects on cells from various tumor types without causing harm to normal cells. Collectively, these data reveals advancements in the study of caseins and their derivative peptides, particularly providing a comprehensive understanding of the molecular mechanism of action in cancer therapy. These mechanisms occur through various signaling pathways, including (i) the increase of interferon-associated STAT1 signaling, (ii) the suppression of stemness-related markers such as CD44, (iii) the attenuation of the STAT3/HIF1-α signaling, (iv) the down-expression of uPAR and PAI-1, (v) the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and reduced intracellular ATP production, (vi) the increase of caspase-3 activity, and (vii) the suppression of TLR4/NF-кB signaling. Therefore, we conclude that casein could be an effective adjuvant for cancer treatment.",

      "abstract": "UNLABELLED: Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV) is a double-stranded tumor virus that is the main causative agent of Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC). The MCPyV large T antigen (LT), an essential viral DNA replication protein, maintains viral persistence by interacting with host Skp1-Cullin 1-F-box (SCF) E3 ubiquitin ligase complexes, which subsequently induces LT's proteasomal degradation, restricting MCPyV DNA replication. SCF E3 ubiquitin ligases require their substrates to be phosphorylated to bind them, utilizing phosphorylated serine residues as docking sites. The MCPyV LT unique region (MUR) is highly phosphorylated and plays a role in multiple host protein interactions, including SCF E3 ubiquitin ligases. Therefore, this domain highly governs LT stability. Though much work has been conducted to identify host factors that restrict MCPyV LT protein expression, the kinase(s) that cooperates with the SCF E3 ligase remains unknown. Here, we demonstrate that casein kinase 1 alpha (CK1α) negatively regulates MCPyV LT stability and LT-mediated replication by modulating interactions with the SCF β-TrCP. Specifically, we show that numerous CK1 isoforms (α, δ, ε) localize in close proximity to MCPyV LT through in situ proximity ligation assays (PLA) and CK1α overexpression mainly resulted in decreased MCPyV LT protein expression. Inhibition of CK1α using short hairpin RNA (shRNA) and treatment of a CK1α inhibitor or an mTOR inhibitor, TORKinib, resulted in decreased β-TrCP interaction with LT, increased LT expression, and enhanced MCPyV replication. The expression level of the CSNK1A1 gene transcripts is higher in MCPyV-positive MCC, suggesting a vital role of CK1α in limiting MCPyV replication required for establishing persistent infection. IMPORTANCE: Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV) large tumor antigen is a polyphosphoprotein and the phosphorylation event is required to modulate various functions of LT, including viral replication. Therefore, cellular kinase pathways are indispensable for governing MCPyV polyomavirus infection and life cycle in coordinating with the immunosuppression environment at disease onset. Understanding the regulation mechanisms of MCPyV replication by viral and cellular factors will guide proper prevention strategies with targeted inhibitors for MCPyV-associated Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) patients, who currently lack therapies.",

Besides, plasma treatment time profoundly influenced protein oxidation, and treatment for 2 and 3 min could be the preferred conditions to minimize protein change. The protein conformation became unstable with the extension of treatment time. Particle size, polymer dispersity index, and microscopy images confirmed alterations in the protein structure following 3 min of processing.

This study aimed to explore the transepithelial transport and stability of LNDP. Results showed that LNDP retained over 90% stability after 2 h of treatment with gastrointestinal enzymes. The stability of LNDP on Caco-2 cell monolayers ranged from 93.4% ± 0.9% to 101.1% ± 1.2% over a period of 15-60 min, with no significant differences at each time point. The permeability of LNDP across an artificial lipid membrane was very low with the effective permeability of 3.6 × 10-11 cm/s. The Caco-2 assay demonstrated that LNDP could traverse the intestinal epithelium, with an apparent permeability of 1.22 × 10-6 cm/s. Its transport was significantly inhibited to 67.9% ± 5.0% of the control by Gly-Pro, a competitor of peptide transporter 1 (PEPT1). Furthermore, PEPT1 knockdown using siRNA significantly inhibited LNDP transport by 77.6% ± 1.9% in Caco-2 cell monolayers. The LNDP uptake in PEPT1-expressing HEK293 cells was significantly higher (54.5% ± 14.6%) than that in mock cells. These findings suggest that PEPT1 plays a crucial role in LNDP transport, and LNDP exhibits good resistance to gastrointestinal enzymes.",

However, challenges such as safety, gastrointestinal stability, and bioavailability of oral drugs often limit their effectiveness. Natural biomacromolecule micelles, known for their safety, stability, biocompatibility, and diverse functions, have emerged as promising carriers for oral treatment of chronic diseases like systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) with fat-soluble drugs. This study introduces an innovative approach by developing an oral delivery system using chemically synthesized natural biomacromolecules to load artesunate for treating SLE. By synthesizing amphiphilic polymer micelles from pectin and casein through a carbodiimide reaction, a more stable structure is achieved. The hydrophobic core of these micelles encapsulates artesunate, resulting in the formation of an oral delivery system (PC-AS) with several advantages, including high drug loading and encapsulation efficiency, small particle size, negative potential, strong stability in the gastrointestinal tract, low toxicity and side effects, strong adhesion in the small intestine, and high bioavailability. These advantages facilitate efficient absorption of artesunate in the gastrointestinal tract, leading to improved bioavailability and effective alleviation of SLE-like symptoms in MRL/lpr mice. By utilizing chemically synthesized natural macromolecular micelles for delivering artesunate in the treatment of SLE, this study overcomes the oral barriers associated with the original drug and presents a novel solution for the long-term oral treatment of chronic diseases.",

Starting from a CRISPR knockout screen, we identified that loss of RB1 in TNBC or HGSC cells generates a synthetic lethal dependency on casein kinase 2 (CK2) for surviving the treatment with replication-perturbing therapeutics such as carboplatin, gemcitabine, or PARP inhibitors. CK2 inhibition in RB1-deficient cells resulted in the degradation of another RB family cell cycle regulator, p130, which led to S phase accumulation, micronuclei formation, and accelerated PARP inhibition-induced aneuploidy and mitotic cell death. CK2 inhibition was also effective in primary patient-derived cells. It selectively prevented the regrowth of RB1-deficient patient HGSC organoids after treatment with carboplatin or niraparib. As about 25% of HGSCs and 40% of TNBCs have lost RB1 expression, CK2 inhibition is a promising approach to overcome resistance to standard therapeutics in large strata of patients.",

Bovine enamel blocks with initial caries lesions were divided into groups (n = 12): 1) Toothpaste without F-TMP-MI Plus (Placebo); 2) Toothpaste 1100 ppm F (1100F), 3) 1100F + MI Paste Plus (1100F-MI Paste Plus), 4) Toothpaste with 1100F + Neutral gel with 4,500 ppm F + 5%TMP (1100F + Gel TMP) and 5) Toothpaste with 1100F + Neutral gel with 9,000 ppm F (1100F + Gel F). For the 4 and 5 groups the gel was applied only once for 1 minute, initially to the study. For the 3 group, after treatment with 1100F, MI Paste Plus was applied 2x/day for 3 minute. After pH cycling, the percentage of surface hardness recovery (%SHR); integrated loss of subsurface hardness (ΔKHN); profile and depth of the subsuperficial lesion (PLM); concentrations of F, calcium (Ca) and phosphorus (P) in enamel was determined. The data were analyzed by ANOVA (1-criterion) and Student-Newman-Keuls test (p < 0.001). Treatment with 1100F alone led to ~ 28% higher remineralization when compared to treatment with 1100F associated with MI Paste Plus (p < 0.001). The 1100F and 1100F + Gel F groups showed similar values for %SHR (p = 0.150). 1100F + Gel TMP treatment also remineralized the enamel surface by ~ 30% and 20% when compared to the 1100F + Gel F and 1100F groups (p < 0.001). The lower lesion depth (ΔKHN) was observed for the 1100F + Gel TMP group (p < 0.001), where it was 54% and 44% lower in comparison to the 1100F and 1100F + Gel F groups (p < 0.001). Polarized light microscopy photomicrographs showed subsurface lesions in all groups, but these lesions were present to a lower extent in the 1100F + Gel TMP group (p < 0.001). Treatment with 1100F + Gel TMP promoted an increase in the concentration of Ca in the enamel by ~ 57% and ~ 26% when compared to the 1100F and 1100F + MI Paste Plus groups (p < 0.001), respectively. There were no significant differences between the 1100F, 1100F + MI Paste Plus and 1100F + Gel F groups (p > 0.001). Similar values of P in the enamel were observed in the 1100F, 1100F + MI Paste Plus and 1100F + Gel F groups (p > 0.001), except for the 1100F + Gel TMP group, which presented a high concentration (p < 0.001). We conclude that the 1100F+TMP gel treatment/protocol led to a significant increased remineralization when compared to the other treatments/protocols and may be a promising strategy for patients with early caries lesions.",

We previously prepared a casein hydrolysate (CP) rich in the sleep-enhancing peptide YPVEPF, and this study aims to systemically investigate the different protective effects of CP and casein on dysfunction and anxiety/insomnia behavior and its underlying mechanisms in chronically stressed mice. Behavioral results showed that CP ameliorated stress-induced insomnia and anxiety more effectively than milk casein, and this difference in amelioration was highly correlated with an increase in GABA, 5-HT, GABAA, 5-HT1A receptors, and BDNF and a decrease in IL-6 and NMDA receptors in stressed mice. Furthermore, CP restored these dysfunctions in the brain and colon by activating the HPA response, modulating the ERK/CREB-BDNF-TrκB signaling pathway, and alleviating inflammation. The abundant YPVEPF (1.20 ± 0.04%) and Tyr-based/Trp-containing peptides of CP may be the key reasons for its different effects compared to casein. Thus, this work revealed the main active structures of CP and provided a novel dietary intervention strategy for the prevention and treatment of chronic-stress-induced dysfunction and anxiety/insomnia behaviors.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The effects of consuming hemp seed protein (HSP) as well as its hydrolysate-derived bioactive peptide (HSP+) on blood pressure (BP) has not, to our knowledge, been investigated in humans. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to investigate how consumption of HSP and its hydrolysate modulates 24-h systolic (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP) and plasma biomarkers of BP compared with casein. METHODS: In a double-blind, randomized, crossover design trial, 35 adults who had mild hypertension with SBP between 130 and 160 mmHg and DBP ≤110 mmHg were recruited. Participants were randomly assigned to varying sequences of 3 6-wk treatments, 50 g casein/d, 50 g HSP/d, or 45 g HSP plus 5 g HSP-derived bioactive peptides/d (HSP+), separated by a 2-wk washout period. Treatment effects were assessed with a linear mixed model with repeated measures. RESULTS: Compared with casein, after HSP+ consumption, 24-h SBP and 24-h DBP decreased from 135.1 and 80.0 mmHg to 128.1 ± 1.6 (P < 0.0001) and 76.0 ± 1.4 mmHg (P < 0.0001), respectively, whereas these values were 133.5 ± 1.6 and 78.9 ± 1.4 mmHg after HSP consumption (P < 0.0001). There were no differences between the HSP and HSP+ consumption in plasma angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) activity, renin, or nitric oxide (NO) concentrations. However, these 2 treatments were able to lower both ACE and renin activities and raise NO concentration in plasma compared with casein. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that hemp protein consumption, as well as in combination with bioactive peptides, may have a role in the dietary management of hypertension. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT03508895.",

Microparticles produced by depletion flocculation and film drying remain stable in acidic media but swell and disintegrate under slightly alkaline conditions. Heat treatment after formation can stabilize the microparticles via a disulfide bridge network and newly formed hydrophobic contacts. Temperatures >60 °C are required so that denatured whey protein initiate formation of disulfide bridges via thiol exchange reactions. The particles then swell in a two-step process and exhibit an overshooting effect. If formation of disulphide bridges is prevented during heat treatment by adding N-methylmaleimide, overshooting swelling disappears and microparticles continue to expand instead. The analysis with parallel system dynamics models is based on the swelling of uncross-linked caseins, which is limited by the expansion capacity of cross-linked caseins.",

Both covalent and non-covalent (hydrogen bonding, electrostatic, and hydrophobic) interactions contributed to the complex formation. The formed complexes had an average diameter of ~80 nm. The complexation of shellac and casein prevented the precipitation of protonated shellac during neutralization, and dispersions with casein:shellac mass ratios of 2:1 and above were absent of precipitates at pH 7.0.

Our interventional study aimed to assess the effectiveness of the gluten-free, casein-free (GFCF) diet in a cohort of Egyptian children with ASD. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The present clinical trial was conducted as a prospective 12-month, open-label, case-controlled interventional study. Thirty-six ASD children who were newly diagnosed and had not taken any prior psychiatric or rehabilitation therapy were included in this study. The patients were randomly assigned into two groups: group A, which received the GFCF diet, and group B, which served as the control group and was not restricted to food containing gluten and casein for 12 months. All patients were followed up for 1 year. RESULTS: Following the implementation of the GFCF diet in group A, significant improvements in CARS scores were observed compared to group B after 6-month and 1-year follow-up periods. CONCLUSIONS: The introduction of the GFCF diet could be helpful and promising for autistic children. Conclusive evidence regarding the effectiveness of the GFCF diet remains a subject of controversy. Nonetheless, our study contributes some evidence supporting its potential benefits for children with ASD. It is recommended that future research on the GFCF diet employ a more sophisticated research design, incorporating a consistent baseline measure that can effectively assess the therapeutic effects of these interventions for individuals with ASD."

In addition, in vivo results showed that HC effectively alleviated allergic response symptoms of Balb/c mice; a significant tendency toward decreased serum IgG1 and mast cell tryptase levels was observed, accompanied by a decrease of Th2-associated IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13 and an increase of IFN-γ levels in spleen. Moreover, the inflammation of the lung, jejunum, and ileum was remarkably ameliorated. The findings indicated that HC induced a shift toward Th1 response and maintained the Th1/Th2 immune balance.

Atovaquone, known as an antimalarial drug, has emerged as a potential candidate for anti-cancer therapy. This study investigated atovaquone's effects on gastric cancer and its underlying mechanisms. Using gastric cancer cell lines, we found that atovaquone, at concentrations relevant to clinical use, significantly reduced their viability. Notably, atovaquone exhibited a lower effectiveness in reducing the viability of normal gastric cells compared to gastric cancer cells. We further demonstrated that atovaquone inhibited gastric cancer growth and colony formation. Mechanism studies revealed that atovaquone inhibited mitochondrial respiration and induced oxidative stress. Experiments using ρ0 cells, deficient in mitochondrial respiration, indicated a slightly weaker effect of atovaquone on inducing apoptosis compared to wildtype cells. Atovaquone increased phosphorylated β-catenin at Ser45 and Ser33/37/Thr41, elevated Axin, and reduced β-catenin. The inhibitory effects of atovaquone on β-catenin were reversed upon depletion of CK1α. Furthermore, the combination of atovaquone with paclitaxel suppressed gastric cancer growth and improved overall survival in mice. Given that atovaquone is already approved for clinical use, these findings suggest its potential as a valuable addition to the drug arsenal available for treating gastric cancer.",

Flow cytometry showed G1 phase arrest of cell cycle and 26% increased apoptotic cells population upon treatment as compared to control. Sorafenib-loaded casein nanoparticles showed 6-fold increased ROS production in HepG2 cells as compared to 4-fold increase shown by the free drug. Gene and protein expression studies done by qPCR and western blotting depicted upregulation of tumor suppressor gene p53, pro-apoptotic Bax, and caspase-3 along with downregulated anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 gene and protein expression which further emphasized death by apoptosis.

      "abstract": "The treatment of various organic pollutants from industrial wastewater using bio-based materials has gained significant attention owing to their excellent properties such as low-cost, eco-friendly, non-toxic, and biodegradability. In this perspective, casein (Cn), a protein-based biopolymer, was extracted from the cow milk as a low-cost adsorbent, and the adsorption performances were determined for the pristine Cn. The adsorbent was employed for the removal of two different classes of targeted pollutant anionic dyes such as Congo red (CR), Eriochrome Black T (EBT), Eosin Y (EY), and pharmaceutical waste i.e., diclofenac sodium (DS) and displayed better adsorption performances with the maximum adsorption capacity of 85.54, 31.72, 70.42 and 358.42 mg g-1 respectively. The interactions between Cn and pollutants are mainly ascribed to the electrostatic interaction, hydrogen bonding, hydrophobic interaction, and π-π interactions. Furthermore, to validate with realistic application the adsorbent proved with an excellent removal efficiency of 91.43% for fabric whitener i.e., Ujala Supreme®. These obtained results suggest that the Cn could be the potential adsorbent to effectively eliminate toxic pollutants from the aqueous solutions.",

      "abstract": "Age-related macular degeneration (AMD), a leading cause of visual impairment in the aging population, lacks effective treatment options due to a limited understanding of its pathogenesis. Lutein, with its strong antioxidant properties and ability to mitigate AMD by absorbing ultraviolet (UV) rays, faces challenges related to its stability and bioavailability in functional foods. In this study, we aimed to develop delivery systems using protein-saccharide conjugates to enhance lutein delivery and protect adult retinal pigment epithelial (ARPE-19) cells against sodium iodate (NaIO3)-induced damage. Various saccharides, including mannose, galactose, lactose, maltose, dextran, and maltodextrin, were conjugated to casein via the Maillard reaction for lutein delivery. The resulting lutein-loaded nanoparticles exhibited small size and spherical characteristics and demonstrated improved thermal stability and antioxidant capacity compared to free lutein. Notably, these nanoparticles were found to be nontoxic, as evidenced by reduced levels of cellular reactive oxygen species production (167.50 ± 3.81, 119.57 ± 3.45, 195.15 ± 1.41, 183.96 ± 3.11, 254.21 ± 3.97, 283.56 ± 7.27%) and inhibition of the mitochondrial membrane potential decrease (58.60 ± 0.29, 65.05 ± 2.91, 38.88 ± 1.81, 42.95 ± 1.39, 23.52 ± 1.04, 25.24 ± 0.08%) caused by NaIO3, providing protection against cellular damage and death. Collectively, our findings suggest that lutein-loaded nanoparticles synthesized via the Maillard reaction hold promise for enhanced solubility, oral bioavailability, and biological efficacy in the treatment of AMD.",

      "abstract": "The rapid metastasis & heterogenic constitution of triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) limits drug entry to the tumor, reducing treatment effectiveness. To address this, we have synthesized Casein nanoparticles (Cn NPs) with attached glutathione (GSH), a natural ligand for cancer cell overexpressed γ-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT). Cn NPs encapsulated with Camptothecin and NIR dye IR 797 (CCN NPs) for combinatorial therapy of TNBC. The GSH-CCN nanoparticles (CCNG NPs) act as a Nano-Trojan to deceive the cancer cells by delivering therapeutic payloads directly to specific target cells. In this study, Casein Nano-Trojan is equipped with GSH as a targeting ligand for GGT. The binding of CCNG NPs with cell surface receptors switched the anionic charge to catanionic, prompting the target cell to engulf the nanoparticles. The Casein Nano-Trojan releases its therapeutic payload inside the target cell, potentially inhibiting proliferation & inducing a high percentage of cell death (85 ± 7 %). Disintegration of mitochondrial membrane potential, inhibition of both migration & re-growth were observed. Immunofluorescence, acridine orange/ethidium bromide stain, and nuclear fragmentation assay further confirmed the substantial DNA damage induced by the high expression of γH2AX and p53. Significant therapeutic efficacy was observed in the 3D spheroids of 4T1 cells and in vivo breast cancer mice model (BALB/c). These findings demonstrate that CCNG NPs could be an effective treatment approach for highly metastatic triple negative breast cancer.",

The objectives of this study were to determine how glucose affects hexokinase (HK) activity in BMEC and investigate the regulatory effect of HK in kappa casein (CSN3) synthesis via the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling pathway in BMEC. For this, HK1 and HK2 were knocked out in BMEC using the CRISPR/Cas9 system. The gene and protein expression, glucose uptake, and cell proliferation were measured. We found that glucose uptake, cell proliferation, CSN3 gene expression levels, and expression of HK1 and HK2 increased with increasing glucose concentrations. Notably, glucose uptake was significantly reduced in HK2 knockout (HK2KO) BMEC treated with 17.5 mM glucose. Moreover, under the same glucose treatment conditions, the proliferative ability and abundance of CSN3 were significantly diminished in both HK1 knockout (HK1KO) and HK2KO BMEC compared with that in wild-type BEMC. We further observed that the phosphorylation levels of ribosome protein subunit 6 kinase 1 (S6K1) were reduced in HK1KO and HK2KO BMEC following treatment with 17.5 mM glucose. As expected, the levels of glucose-6-phosphate and the mRNA expression levels of glycolysis-related genes were decreased in both HK1KO and HK2KO BMEC following glucose treatment. These results indicated that the knockout of HK1 and HK2 inhibited cell proliferation and CSN3 expression in BMEC under glucose treatment, which may be associated with the inactivation of the S6K1 and inhibition of glycolysis."

METHODS: Fifty participants were selected and assigned to one of four groups: (1) PLACEBO group-received a placebo paste and PBMT simulation; (2) PBMT group-received a placebo paste + PBMT; (3) CPP-ACPF group-received CPP-ACPF paste and PBMT simulation; (4) CPP-ACPF + PBMT group-received both CPP-ACPF paste and PBMT. The participants used whitening trays containing 22% carbamide peroxide for 2 h a day for 21 days. TS was measured daily using a visual analog scale, while shade change was assessed using a spectrophotometer: before bleaching treatment (T0), after the first (T1), second (T2), and third (T3) weeks of treatment, and 30 days (T4) after completing the whitening treatment. RESULTS: Intragroup analysis revealed that the PLACEBO group had the highest increase in sensitivity during the whitening treatment. The CPP-ACPF and PBMT groups showed no significant difference tooth whitening (TW) between weeks regarding aesthetic change. The CPP-ACPF and PBMT group exhibited a significant reduction in TS between the first and third and between the second and third weeks TW, but not between the first and second. Conversely, the PLACEBO group showed a higher sensitivity than the other groups (p < .05). The CPP-ACPF and PBMT groups did not differ from each other. Furthermore, the CPP-ACPF and PBMT group showed a greater decrease in sensitivity than the PLACEBO group at T1, T2, and T3 (p < .01), and was significantly differed from CPP-ACPF and PBMT groups only at T2 and T3. All groups confirmed TW effectiveness. Student's and paired t-test did not reveal any significant difference between groups (p > .05). CONCLUSION: Therefore, PBMT associated with CPP-ACPF paste can reduce TS without compromising the efficacy of TW.",

      "abstract": "Every 1.2 s, a diabetic foot ulcer is developed, and every 20 s, one amputation is carried out in diabetic patients. Monitoring and controlling protease activity have been considered as a strategy for more efficient management of diabetic and other chronic wounds. This study aimed to develop a casein-based dressing that, by its disappearance, provides information about the activity of proteases and simultaneously harnesses proteolytic activity. Casein films were fabricated by using an aqueous solution, and heat treatment was successfully deployed as a green and clean approach to confer hydrolytic stability. Our results showed that casein-based films' mechanical characteristics, water absorption, and proteolytic stability could be controlled by the length of the heat treatment, which proved to be a useful tool. An increase in the treatment duration from 30 min to 3 h led to toleration of 2.4 times higher stress, 2 times lower water uptake, and 3.4 times higher proteolytic stability at examined conditions. Selected casein-based structures responded to Bacillus sp. bacteria's protease (BSP) and human neutrophil elastase (HNE) as representatives of bacterial and nonbacterial proteases found in the wounds at 10 and 200 ng mL-1 levels, respectively. The hydrolysis was accompanied by a 36% reduction in proteolytic activity measured by using a casein-based universal protease activity assay. The released casein fragments could scavenge 90% of the examined radicals. In-vitro cell culture studies showed that the hydrolysates were not cytotoxic, and the casein-based film had a favorable interaction with fibroblast cells, indicating its potential as a scaffold in the case that proteolytic activity would not be to the extent that causes its rapid disintegration. In general, these findings hold promise for applying the developed casein-based structure for detecting proteolytic activity without the need for any equipment, kits, or expertise and, more importantly, in a highly economical manner. In the case that the proteolytic activity would not be severe, it could also serve as a substrate for cell adhesion and growth; this would aid in the healing process.",

METHODS: This in vivo study involved 40 orthodontic patients with fixed appliances, who were randomly assigned to either a routine oral hygiene group or a CPP-ACP supplementary regimen group. Twenty new NiTi archwires served as controls. All archwires underwent scanning electron microscopy and energy-dispersive spectroscopy to evaluate their surface topography and elemental composition. The nickel content was quantified as a percentage of total weight and the Ni/Ti ratio, and statistical comparisons were made using pairwise tests. RESULTS: Wires exposed to fluoride toothpaste showed signs of pitting corrosion, deep grooves, and corrosion debris. In contrast, wires exposed to supplementary CPP-ACP exhibited smooth surface areas interspersed with microdefects and deposits. Statistically significant differences in nickel content were found between the new and retrieved archwires, as well as between wires exposed to routine oral hygiene and CPP-ACP (P < 0.001). The archwires exposed to CPP-ACP had the lowest nickel content (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: The use of CPP-ACP holds promise for application as a safe anticariogenic agent with possible protective properties during orthodontic treatment.",

A gradual reduction in the α-helix content of the secondary structure (as a stable structure) indicates that casein under EBI treatment mainly undergoes fragmentation and aggregation from a structural perspective. Furthermore, the hydrophobic group and tryptophan in the tertiary structure were exposed, which opened up the internal structure of the protein. In addition, a continuously increasing irradiation dose led to casein aggregation, as confirmed by electron microscopy. The structural changes affected its functional properties, such as solubility, emulsification, foaming, and rheological properties, all of which increased first and subsequently decreased. Finally, at irradiation doses of 4-6 kGy, casein was modified to exhibit optimal functional properties, which enhanced its food processing value and performance.",

The level of significance was determined to be 0.05. RESULTS: The microorganism count variable at baseline, first, and second follow-ups was significantly different for all groups except the probiotic yogurt group (P = 0.340). S. mutans count was significantly different when comparing the first follow-up and baseline values in the CHX and xylitol gum groups (P = 0.027, P = 0.037). When comparing the second follow-up with baseline values, a significant difference was observed in the xylitol gum group (P = 0.003). CONCLUSION: Xylitol chewing gum seems to be a viable alternative to the gold standard (CHX mouthwash) in reducing the salivary count of S. mutans."

Patients were randomly assigned to three distinct groups with each group consisting of 30 patients. Group 1 served as the control and received regular dentifrice, Group 2 received strontium-doped nano-hydroxyapatite paste, and Group 3 received casein phosphopeptide-amorphous calcium phosphate topical cream. Patients were instructed to locally apply a specified amount of the prescribed preparation twice daily for six weeks. The data were analysed using the statistical programme SPSS 22.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA), and the level of significance had been set at p < 0.05. RESULTS: Group 1 did not show any change in the enamel following the application of toothpaste. Both Group 2 and 3 demonstrated higher post-treatment scores, indicating effective remineralization potential (p < 0.001). However, Group 2 (strontium-doped nano-hydroxyapatite paste) displayed significantly greater remineralization capacity when compared to group 3 (casein phosphopeptide-amorphous calcium phosphate topical cream). CONCLUSION: Compared to conventional dentifrice and casein phosphopeptide-amorphous calcium phosphate paste, strontium-doped nano-hydroxyapatite preparation demonstrated greater enamel remineralization of the white spot lesions and favourable surface alterations in the enamel surface. strontium-doped nano-hydroxyapatite can be utilised safely and efficiently to treat early caries and remineralise white spot lesions on the enamel."

      "abstract": "Recently, we have demonstrated casein manganese oxide nanoparticles (CMnNP) that exhibit pro-angiogenic property established through different in vitro and in vivo experiments. The CMnNP was explored for therapeutic angiogenesis for treatment of wounds and recovery of hindlimb ischemia in pre-clinical mouse prototypical. It is well known that to translate any therapeutic nanoparticle for future clinical applications, their biosafety evaluation in small and large animals is essential. Herein, in the current study, the biosafety and bioavailability of the CMnNP have been explored by a systematic toxicity profiling study in C57BL/6J mice model. Initially, the in vitro cytotoxic effects of CMnNP were validated in RAW 264.7 cells. Later, the CMnNP was administered intraperitoneally with different doses (50, 300, and 2000 mg/kg b.wt./day) at different time points of exposure (acute: 2 weeks, sub-chronic: 4 weeks as well as chronic exposure: 8 and 20 weeks) with reference to the maximum tolerable dose (MTD) of CMnNP as per the OECD guidelines. The blood hematological and serum biochemical parameters of CMnNP treatment groups indicate negligible changes similar to untreated group. The histopathological examination of CMnNP-treated vital organs (lung, spleen, liver, brain, kidney, and heart) illustrates no major changes even at higher doses. Further, the biodistribution and excretion study depicts normal clearance of CMnNP. Additionally, the serum cytokine levels were normal in the therapeutic dose of CMnNP. The results altogether indicate that the non-toxic nature of CMnNP makes them useful as future therapeutic angiogenic agent for the treatment of various diseases where angiogenesis plays an important role.",

      "abstract": "Sweet and, to a lesser extent, acid whey protein ingredients can be used for the formulation of infant nutritional products. Unlike acid whey, sweet whey contains caseinomacropeptide (CMP), a heat-stable peptide liberated from κ-casein during cheese and rennet casein manufacture. Four protein systems-sweet whey (SW) and acid whey (AW), with or without standardization for CMP protein content-were added to skim milk (50/50, wt/wt) and unheated or heated to 85 or 110°C. These 12 samples were assessed for physicochemical stability in the presence of added calcium at pH 6.8. The effect of CMP content on the physicochemical properties of the protein systems was also assessed. Without preheat treatment, mixtures of AW and skim milk (SM) were more heat stable than SW and SM, demonstrating the effect of whey protein type on heat stability. Preheat treatment of the SW in the presence of SM significantly improved the heat stability of the resultant protein systems on subsequent heating. All of the protein systems had significantly lower heat stability with the addition of Ca, although the reduction was significantly smaller for the heated protein systems than the unheated controls. The findings can help identify heating parameters and ingredients for optimizing processing stability and physicochemical characteristics of nutritional beverages such as infant formulations.",

      "abstract": "Casein Kinase 1 (CK1) is a family of serine/threonine protein kinases that play a crucial role in various cellular processes, including cell proliferation, survival, and metabolism. The dysregulation of CK1 expression has been implicated in the development and progression of several types of cancer, making it an attractive target for anticancer therapy. In this review, we provide an overview of the current strategies employed to target CK1 for cancer therapy and discuss the future perspectives in this field. We highlight the different approaches, including small molecule inhibitors, RNA interference, genome editing, and immunotherapies, which hold immense potential for targeted modulation of CK1 activity in cancer cells. Furthermore, we discuss the challenges associated with targeting CK1 and propose potential strategies to overcome these hurdles. Overall, targeting CK1 holds great promise as a therapeutic strategy for cancer treatment, and further research in this area is warranted."

      "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients exhibit neuropsychiatric symptoms that extend beyond classical cognitive deficits, suggesting involvement of subcortical areas. Here, we investigated the role of midbrain dopamine (DA) neurons in AD using the amyloid + tau-driven 3xTg-AD mouse model. We found deficits in reward-based operant learning in AD mice, suggesting possible VTA DA neuron dysregulation. Physiological assessment revealed hyperexcitability and disrupted firing in DA neurons caused by reduced activity of small-conductance calcium-activated potassium (SK) channels. RNA sequencing from contents of single patch-clamped DA neurons (Patch-seq) identified up-regulation of the SK channel modulator casein kinase 2 (CK2). Pharmacological inhibition of CK2 restored SK channel activity and normal firing patterns in 3xTg-AD mice. These findings shed light on a complex interplay between neuropsychiatric symptoms and subcortical circuits in AD, paving the way for novel treatment strategies."
