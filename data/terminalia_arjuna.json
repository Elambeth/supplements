      "abstract": "Entisol soil is hard and compact in nature, rendering it high in bulk density, which influences root penetration adversely and thereby poor plant growth. In this experiment, used seven treatments in different combination in normal soil, were used as growth media for the Terminalia arjuna seedling. T3 (60% entisol) found the best as it gave the highest biomass in the species regardless of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) treatment. AMF treatment enhanced the growth and biomass of plants significantly in all the given treatments. AMF colonization observed a maximum in tertiary roots. T1 (100% entisol soil) exhibited the highest degree of AMF colonization in tertiary roots, resulting in the highest mycorrhiza dependency of plants for this soil. The addition of normal soil to entisol soil was found to decrease the bulk density, resulting in increased root diameter, and T3 plants exhibited the highest biomass and AMF compatibility for T. arjuna species. The T. arjuna plant's growth and biomass responded positively to AMF in all types of treatments. The plant's growth and biomass were highest in the T3 treatment, which had a bulk density of 1.50 g/cm3. In this study, we combined the entisol with mycorrhizal inoculation of the nursery growing medium to promote plant growth and biomass, improve the plant's ability to hold water and absorb nutrients, and lower the entisol's bulk density. The T. arjuna (Roxb) plant responds very favorably to mycorrhiza inoculation in nursery conditions with the entisol growth medium."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) manifests in various clinical presentations ranging from asymptomatic but cosmetic problems to severe symptoms, such as lower limb edema, skin trophic changes, and ulceration. CVI substantially affects the quality of life and work productivity of the patients. Ayurveda, an ancient traditional medicine in India, evaluates the various pathological stages of CVI with a wide range of pathological conditions such as Siragranthi (venous abnormalities), Raktavaritavāta (disorders of vāta occluded by rakta ∼ blood), ApanaVaigunya (vitiated apānavāyu), Arsha (hemorrhoids), VataRakta (rheumatism due to rakta), Kushtha (integumentary disease) and Dushta Vrana (putrefied wound) depending upon the presentations of the patient. Ayurvedic texts mention Terminalia arjuna as a potential herb for treating various conditions related to the circulatory system. The drug is an effective anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant, and anti-hypertensive and has a definite role in improving cardiovascular hemodynamics and wound healing. These attributes suggest that the potential of Terminalia arjuna needs to be explored as a promising venoactive drug. METHODS: This prospective observational study included 25 patients (31 limbs) with CVI who were treated with Tab Terminalia arjuna (Bark extract of Terminalia arjuna in a dose of 500 mg, given twice a day) and were observed on two visits on day 30 and day 90. Follow-up was carried out for three months to evaluate post-treatment complications or adverse effects. The clinical outcome assessment was done using Venous Clinical Severity Score (VCSS), and clinical grading was performed using clinical classification (C0 - C6) of CEAP (Clinical-Etiology-Anatomy-Pathophysiology) classification. RESULTS: The median VCSS score (of both limbs) during the third visit was comparatively lower than the first, with a statistically significant improvement at 0.05 level. Further, there was a substantial positive improvement in the clinical classification of CEAP among the patients in pre and post treatment phase. CONCLUSION: The prospective observational study shows that Tab Terminalia arjuna is safe and effective in CVI, reducing the symptoms like pain, edema, inflammation, pigmentation, induration and also expediting ulcer healing.",

      "abstract": "Terminalia arjuna is one of the important herbal plants with cardioprotective, antihyperlipidemic activity and many more applications. In the present investigation, In order to find out the protective role, we prepared aqueous and ethanolic extract of Terminalia arjuna. The objective of this study was to comparatively evaluate the antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory activity of aqueous and ethanolic extract of Terminalia arjuna and to compare between the two. Antimicrobial activity of the plant extract was assessed by using agar well diffusion method against oral pathogens. The anti-inflammatory activity of prepared Terminalia arjuna plant extract was analyzed using egg albumin denaturation assay. The results of this study, showed that both aqueous and ethanolic extract had very good antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas species followed by Escherichia coli. However, the aqueous extract showed higher anti-inflammatory activity when compared with ethanolic extract. So it can be concluded that aqueous extract of Terminalia arjuna could be used as a local drug delivery agent in the treatment of chronic periodontitis."

      "abstract": "Congestive cardiac failure (CCF) is a pathophysiologic state when the heart is not able to maintain its cardiac output to meet the demand of metabolising tissues. CCF is responsible for approximately 2.9 million deaths worldwide. The heterogeneous nature of CCF draws the attention of researchers to find more enthralling and promising diagnostic and treatment options. Terminalia arjuna (Arjuna) is an evergreen, deciduous tree exhibited various astringent, anti-bacterial, and anti-microbial properties. T. arjuna is being used in various regions for anginal pain, hypertension, congestive heart failure, and dyslipidemia. Although previous in vitro studies have demonstrated the therapeutic potential of T. arjuna, the exact molecular mechanism underlying its protective effect on the heart remains unclear. In this study, a network pharmacology technique was used to explore the active ingredients, potential targets in T. arjuna for the treatment of CCF. In the framework of this study, we explored the active ingredient-target-pathway network and figured out that oleanolic acid, arjunolic acid, luteolin, kaempferol, cholesterol, ellagic acid 4-O-xylopyranoside 3,3'-dimethyl ether, and cyclohexyl (2,4-dimethyl phenyl) methanone contributed significantly to the development of CCF by affecting AKT1, MAPK14, TNF, IL6, ESR1, and HSP90AA1 genes. Molecular docking analysis further validated the activities of these compounds against potential targets. To sum up, integrated network pharmacology and docking analysis revealed that T. arjuna exerts its cardioprotective effect by acting on various signalling pathways, including the thyroid hormone, VEGF signalling pathway, AGE-RAGE signalling pathway in diabetic complications, HIF signalling pathway, sphingolipid signalling pathway, and oestrogen signalling pathways. Overall, this study provides valuable insights into the molecular mechanism of T. arjuna in CCF and highlights its potential as a promising preventive treatment for this condition."

      "abstract": "ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Terminalia arjuna (Roxb. ex DC.) Wight & Arnot (Combretaceae) is one of the most frequently used medicinal trees in Indian traditional medicinal systems. It is used for the treatment of a variety of diseases including cardiovascular disorders. AIM OF THE STUDY: The purpose of this review was to provide a comprehensive overview of the phytochemistry, medicinal uses, toxicity, and industrial applications of T. arjuna bark (BTA), as well as to identify gaps in research and applications of this important tree. It also aimed to analyze trends and future research paths to utilize the full potential of this tree. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Extensive bibliographic research on the T. arjuna tree was carried out using scientific research engines and databases such as Google Scholar, PubMed, and Web of Science, covering all relevant English-language articles. The database \"World Flora Online (WFO)\" (http://www.worldfloraonline.org) was used to confirm plant taxonomy. RESULTS: To date, BTA has been traditionally employed for several disorders such as snakebites, scorpion stings, gleets, earaches, dysentery, sexual disorders, and urinary tract infections along with the cardioprotective activity. About 38 phytocompounds were identified from BTA and were classified as triterpenoids, tannins, flavonoids, and glycosides. A wide range of in vitro and in vivo pharmacological effects of BTA were reported such as anti-cancer, antimicrobial, antiviral, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, hepatoprotective, anti-allergic, anti-diabetic, and wound healing activities. The oral administration of BTA (500 mg/kg) per day did not result in any toxicity in humans. The in vivo acute and sub-acute toxicity analysis of the methanol extract of BTA and one of its major compounds, 7-methyl gallate, did not produce any adverse effects up to a dose of 1000 mg/kg. CONCLUSIONS: This comprehensive review highlights various aspects of traditional knowledge, phytochemicals, and pharmacological significance of BTA. The review covered safety information on employing BTA in pharmaceutical dosage forms. Despite its long history of medicinal benefit, more studies are needed to understand the molecular mechanisms, structure-activity relationship, and potential synergistic and antagonistic effects of its phytocompounds, drug administration, drug-drug interactions, and toxicological effects.",

      "abstract": "Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading cause of mortality worldwide. Terminalia arjuna (Roxb. ex DC.) Wight & Arnot of the Combretaceae family is one of the most frequently approved and utilized medicinal trees in the traditional medicinal system, which was used for the treatment of a variety of diseases, including cardiovascular disorders. The present study aims to identify phytochemicals from T. arjuna, that do not exhibit any toxicity and have significant cardioprotective activity using an in-silico technique. Four different cardiovascular proteins, namely human angiotensin receptor (PDB ID: 4YAY), P38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK, PDB ID: 4DLI), 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-Co A) reductase (PDB ID: 1HW9), and human C-reactive protein (PDB ID: 1B09), were used as target proteins to identify potential inhibitors using a virtual screening of the phytochemicals in T. arjuna revealed casuarinin as a potential inhibitor of all selected target proteins with strong binding energy. Furthermore, MD simulations for a 100 ns time scale also revealed that most of the key protein contacts of all target proteins were retained throughout the simulation trajectories. Binding free energy calculations using the MM-GBSA approach also support a strong inhibitory effect of casuarinin on target proteins. Casuarinin's effective binding to these proteins lays the groundwork for the development of broad-spectrum drugs as well as the understanding of the underlying mechanism against cardiovascular diseases through in vivo and clinical studies.",

      "abstract": "Utilizing agro-industrial waste and herbal products to create a circular bioeconomy is becoming increasingly popular. Terminalia arjuna is a significant ethnomedicinal plant that has not yet been exploited in animal feed. In the present study, nutritional Terminalia arjuna bark powder-based fish feed was created and supplied to a candidate fish species Labeo rohita at varied levels: 0% (0 g/kg), 0.5% (5 g/kg), 1% (10 g/kg), and 1.5% (15 g/kg). These treatment groups are denoted as CT, T1, T2, and T3, respectively. Utilizing a contemporary comprehensive biomarker response strategy, the study clarified the genomic influence of dietary herb inclusion. In response to bacterial infection, the immunogenic genes, STAT 1 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 1), ISG 15 (interferon stimulating gene), and Mx \"myxovirus resistance gene\", were shown to be elevated. The results of densitometry demonstrated a dose-dependent increase in STAT 1 and ISG 15, with Mx exhibiting maximal values at 1 g/kg TABP (Terminalia arjuna bark powder-based feed). This is the first study to identify TABP as an immunomodulator in fish and established the IBR (Integrated Bio-marker Response) as a reliable marker in evaluating the impact of multiple drivers in a holistic manner. Thus, the present study cleared the path for TABP to be utilized as an effective feed additive which enhances the specific adaptive immune system of the fish for the production of the Green fish product for a sustainable circular bioeconomy."

It is believed that natural phyto compounds and extracts have been a potential source of treating health conditions and have been practiced since several decades. The aim of the study is to identify phyto compounds having significant cardio protective activity targeting APOE4. Since protein-ligand interactions play a leading role in structure-based drug design, with the help of molecular docking, we selected 20 phyto chemicals present in different plants and investigated their binding affinity against targeted APOE isoforms. Among all selected phytoc ompounds, arjunolic acid, from Terminalia arjuna plant was found as promising candidate for developing therapeutic against APOE4 activated CAD. Findings from the present work could be further studied for clinical evaluations on human to adopt strategies and reduce the prevalence and mortality. Arjunolic acid derivatives can be used as a source of new medication or development of novel compounds in the treatment of CAD."

However, no scientific study has been done to validate its usefulness in the alleviation of osteoporosis. To investigate the efficacy of stem bark TA against post-menopausal osteoporosis using bilateral ovariectomized rat model. METHODS: Aqueous (TAA) and methanolic (TAM) extracts of TA was evaluated for its anti-osteoporotic activity. Sham control rats were allotted as Group I (Normal control); Group II animals acted as OVX control (Disease control); Group III OVX rats were treated with estrogen (Standard group - 2 mg/kg) Group IV and V OVX rats give treatment to TAA (250 and 500 mg/kg, p.o.), respectively. This treatment is continue for the four weeks and at the end, serum biochemical parameters such as serum calcium and alkaline phosphate were evaluated. Femoral bone parameters (Compression of vertebrae, femoral neck load testing, Three point bending of tibia, Femur length and weight), histology, body weight, and fifth lumbar vertebra breaking strength were also assessed after the sacrificing the animal. RESULTS: In OVX rats, atrophy of uterus and descent of BMD were suppressed by treatment with TAA and TAM. In addition, TAM 500 completely corrected the decreased serum concentration of Calcium, Phosphorus, ALP and TRAP observed in OVX rats. TAA and TAM both increased biomechanical strength significantly in comparison to the sham group. Histological results also revealed its protective action through elevation of bone formation. TAM significantly increase the uterine and femoral bone weight The TAM showed maximum anti-osteoporotic activity in in vivo study as compare to TAA. CONCLUSIONS: The results, evaluated on the basis of biochemical, bone mineral density, biomechanical, and histopathological parameters, presented that TAA and TAM has a definite antiosteoporotic effect, like to estrogen, especially effective for inhibition bone fracture induced by estrogen deficiency."

Ayurvedic herbalism authenticates the multiple therapeutic applications of Terminalia arjuna bark due to its rich phytochemical repertoire. OBJECTIVE: To observe the extent of oxidative damage caused to erythrocytes by alcohol and assess the protective ability of T. arjuna bark powder aqueous extract (AETA) against the damage. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Wister albino rats were categorized into four groups of eight rats per group; first group (control) was fed with glucose, second group was given alcohol at a dose of 20% v/v; 5g alcohol/kg b. wt/day, third group was co-administered with AETA (0.5 g/kg b. wt/day) and alcohol and the fourth group was kept on bark extract alone. Blood samples were collected and evaluated for different biochemical parameters after the completion of the treatment period. RESULTS: Alcohol significantly increased the erythrocyte membrane protein carbonyl and malondialdehyde (MDA) contents, along with a concomitant decrease in the membrane antioxidant status, when compared to the control group. Chromatographic analysis of the alcohol-treated rat erythrocyte membranes revealed altered membrane individual phospholipid contents and fluidity properties. Alcohol-induced morphological changes in the erythrocytes and its effect on decreasing the resistance of hypotonic shock induced by NaCl are evident from the hemolysis curves. However, AETA administration to alcoholic rats beneficially modulated the membrane properties anvd protected erythrocytes from damage. CONCLUSION: Results suggest that AETA protects erythrocytes from alcohol-induced oxidative stress, biophysical, and biochemical changes very effectively."

Apart from its therapeutic properties it also has anti-spermatogenic activity, but its effectiveness and mode of action on male gonadal activity remains to be revealed. METHODS: TA bark extract was dissolved in 1% dimethyl sulfoxide and applied in primary Leydig cell culture from rat testis in dose dependent manner. After 24 h of treatment cellular toxicity marker, cytokines, steroid 5-alpha-reductase 1 (SRD5A1) and androgen receptor (AR) were measured. RESULTS: Present study first proposed the cytotoxic impacts of TA on Leydig cells via leakage of lactate dehydrogenase and inflammatory responses by altering the pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines in dose-dependent-manner. Furthermore, down regulation of SRD5A1 and AR indicated inhibition of normal steroidogenesis which well corroborated with cytotoxity and inflammation related parameters to promote damage of Leydig cell function. Nevertheless, it can be speculated that the inhibition of normal steroidogenesis and thereby spermatogenesis induced by TA is possibly due to the presence of β-sitosterol. CONCLUSIONS: Therefore, the dose and duration of treatment should be carefully monitored in cases of its medicinal uses and longer duration should be avoided to protect reproductive health and fertility.",

The control group (35 patients) received conventional drugs alone. Hemogram, liver function tests and kidney function tests were done at baseline and then every 6 months until the end of the study. Electrocardiography was done every 6 months and echocardiography was done yearly for left ventricular ejection fraction and regional wall motion abnormalities. Any adverse drug reactions reported by the patients were also recorded. RESULTS: The mean age of patients in test and control groups was 60.88 ± 9.02 and 58.51 ± 12.64 years, respectively. There was a predominance of male patients in both the groups. The patients were observed for duration ranging from 9 months to 4 years and 9 months. Other than baring gastritis and constipation, no other noteworthy adverse effects were reported. No significant difference was found in laboratory value on baseline and end of therapy in both the groups. CONCLUSION: The results of the present study concluded that Arjuna is safe and effective in patients with chronic coronary artery disease."

      "abstract": "Aqueous extract of the bark of Terminalia arjuna (TA) is used by a large population in the Indian subcontinent for treating various cardiovascular conditions. Animal experiments have shown its anti-atherogenic, anti-hypertensive, and anti-inflammatory effects. It has several bioactive ingredients with hemodynamic, ROS scavenging, and anti-inflammatory properties. Earlier we have done limited proteomic and transcriptomic analysis to show its efficacy in ameliorating cardiac hypertrophy induced by isoproterenol (ISO) in rats. In the present study we have used high-throughput sequencing of the mRNA from control and treated rat heart to further establish its efficacy. ISO (5 mg/kg/day s.c.) was administered in male adult rats for 14 days to induce cardiac hypertrophy. Standardized aqueous extract TA bark extract was administered orally. Total RNA were isolated from control, ISO, ISO + TA, and TA treated rat hearts and subjected to high throughput sequence analysis. The modulations of the transcript levels were then subjected to bio-informatics analyses using established software. Treatment with ISO downregulated 1,129 genes and upregulated 204 others. Pre-treatment with the TA bark extracts markedly restored that expression pattern with only 97 genes upregulated and 85 genes downregulated. The TA alone group had only 88 upregulated and 26 downregulated genes. The overall profile of expression in ISO + TA and TA alone groups closely matched with the control group. The genes that were modulated included those involved in metabolism, activation of receptors and cell signaling, and cardiovascular and other diseases. Networks associated with those genes included those involved in angiogenesis, extracellular matrix organization, integrin binding, inflammation, drug metabolism, redox metabolism, oxidative phosphorylation, and organization of myofibril. Overlaying of the networks in ISO and ISO_TA group showed that those activated in ISO group were mostly absent in ISO_TA and TA group, suggesting a global effect of the TA extracts. This study for the first time reveals that TA partially or completely restores the gene regulatory network perturbed by ISO treatment in rat heart; signifying its efficacy in checking ISO-induced cardiac hypertrophy."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Increased macrophage and foam cell apoptosis during early atherogenesis retards plaque progression by impeding foam cell formation, suppressing inflammation and limiting lesion cellularity. Our previous in vitro study in THP1 macrophages demonstrated that Terminalia Arjuna (TA) attenuates dual-specificity phosphatase1 (DUSP1), a key negative regulator of JNK/P38MAPK signaling cascade, the branch also implicated in the UPR (unfolded protein response)-CHOP-mediated apoptotic pathway; however this pathway has not been explored so far in the presence of TA. Therefore, we aimed to elucidate the pro-apoptotic effect of aqueous bark extract of TA (aqTAE) on macrophage and foam cells and the underlying mechanism associated with it. METHODS: THP1 cells were initially differentiated into macrophages with phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA) (100 ng/ml) for 24 h, followed by ox-LDL (100 μg/ml) treatment for another 24 h to induce foam cell formation. Thereafter, macrophages and ox-LDL- treated cells were incubated with aqTAE (100 μg/ml) for the next 24 h. Further, Oil Red O (ORO) staining, CD36 expression profiling, apoptotic assay and transcriptional and translational expression of ER-stress markers i.e., X-box binding protein 1 (XBP1) and C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) were performed for elucidating the potential mechanism underlying TA-induced macrophage and foam cell apoptosis. RESULTS: We demonstrated that ox-LDL treatment significantly increased lipid accumulation and upregulated CD36 expression, indicating foam cell formation; while the addition of aqTAE resulted in a significant decline in ORO positive cells, and suppression of CD36 expression in ox-LDL-stimulated macrophages, suggestive of reduced formation of lipid-laden foam cells. Further, aqTAE treatment alone and in combination with oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL) stimulus, significantly attenuated CD36 expression; increased apoptosis; and augmented the expression of UPR regulatory proteins including XBP1 and CHOP, and similar observations were noted when cells were treated with ox-LDL alone. These findings indicate that TA promotes macrophage and foam cell apoptosis via enhancing UPR-mediated activation of JNK/p38MAPK-CHOP pathway in a DUSP1-dependent manner, implying a possible interplay between ox-LDL-induced ER stress- and TA-mediated MAPK signaling. CONCLUSION: Our data shows that aqTAE inhibits foam cell formation, as well as promotes macrophage and foam cell apoptosis by augmenting UPR- JNK/p38MAPK-CHOP signaling cascade via inhibiting DUSP1. These findings provide novel mechanistic insight into the anti-atherogenic potential of TA, which may prove beneficial against early-stage atherosclerotic lesions.",

In the present study, we evaluated cardioprotective potential of Terminalia arjuna extract (TAE) and AA against cobalt chloride (CoCl2)-induced hypoxia damage and apoptosis in rat cardiomyocytes. TAE (50 μg/ml) and AA (8 μg/ml) significantly (p < 0.001) protected H9c2 cells as evidenced by cell viability assays against CoCl2 (1.2 mM)-induced cytotoxicity. TAE and AA pretreatments protected the cells from oxidative damage by decreasing the generation of free radicals (ROS, hydroperoxide, and nitrite levels). TAE and AA pretreatments retained mitochondrial membrane potential by alleviating the rate of lipid peroxidation induced by CoCl2 treatment. TAE and AA pretreatments elevated antioxidant status including phase II antioxidant enzymes (superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, and glutathione reductase) and total glutathione levels against CoCl2-induced oxidative stress. Further immunoblotting studies confirmed anti-apoptotic effects of TAE and AA by alleviating the phosphorylation of JNK and c-jun and also by regulating protein expression levels of Bcl2, Bax, caspase 3, heat shock protein-70, and inducible nitric oxide synthase. Overall, our results suggest that both the extract and the active component exhibit antioxidant and anti-apoptotic defense against CoCl2-induced hypoxic injury.",

The present study was conducted to evaluate the protective role of aqueous bark extract of Terminalia arjuna (TA) against Cd induced oxidative damage in hepatic and cardiac tissues as the TA bark extract has folkloric medicinal use in the treatment of various hepatic and cardiac disorders. Male Wistar rats were divided into 4 groups. The control group was treated with normal saline as the vehicle; the second group orally administered with TA (20 mg/kg bw) daily for 15 days; the third group injected with Cd-acetate (0.44 mg/kg bw, s.c.) every alternate day for a period of 15 days; and the fourth group was administered with TA, 60 min prior to Cd treatment. The biomarkers of organ damage were significantly increased in the Cd treated groups. Besides, a significant alteration in the tissue levels of biomarkers of oxidative stress, the activities and the levels of antioxidant enzymes was observed following treatment with Cd. Additionally, some of the enzymes were found to be inhibited uncompetitively by Cd when tested in an in vitro system. Furthermore, evidence gathered from studies on the histological parameters and mitochondrial membrane potential in both the tissues argue in favour of the possible protective role of TA against Cd induced damage. Finally, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry revealed the presence of eight major bioactive phytochemicals in aqueous bark extract of TA having potent free radical scavenging property. The results indicate that the extract could protect hepatic and cardiac tissues against Cd-induced oxidative stress mediated damages through antioxidant mechanism(s).",

      "abstract": "ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Terminalia arjuna Roxb. (Combretaceae) is traditionally used in Ayurveda medicine and holds ethnomedicinal importance for treatment of gastrointestinal disorders. In view of its anti-inflammatory, antidiarrheal and antioxidant potential, it could be beneficial for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), which is associated with interaction between genetic, environmental factors and intestinal microbiome leading to dysregulated immune responses. This study evaluates the effect of hydroalcoholic extract of Terminalia arjuna bark (TAHA) in trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS) model of rat colitis which resembles human IBD. MATERIALS AND METHODS: TAHA (500, 250, 125 mg/kg) was administered orally for 28 days in TNBS induced rats. Response to treatment was assessed by comparing observations in diseased and treated groups using disease activity index (DAI); macroscopic/histological damage; determining oxidative stress indicators: myeloperoxidase, malondialdehyde, nitric oxide, catalase, superoxide dismutase, and reduced glutathione; gene expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, IL-1β, TNF-α and chemokine: MCP-1. Furthermore, the role of TAHA in altering the gut microbiota profile in rat feces and plasma zinc was also studied. RESULTS: TAHA treatment in colitic rats directed decreased DAI scores, macroscopic and histologic damage. It also reduced myeloperoxidase, malondialdehyde and nitric oxide level. Whereas, prevented depletion of plasma catalase, superoxide dismutase and glutathione level. In addition, TAHA treatment down-regulated the gene expression of pro-inflammatory mediators and displayed altered beneficial effect on fecal microbiota. Furthermore, enhanced plasma zinc level supported the beneficial effect of TAHA in colitic rats. The dose of TAHA that produced most significant beneficial effect was 500 mg/kg. CONCLUSION: TAHA administration relieved the disease activity in TNBS induced colitis by reducing expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokine, decreasing oxidative stress, and improving plasma zinc level and structure of gut microbiota.",

      "abstract": "The prevalence of Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) is increasing globally. Terminalia arjuna W. & Arn. (Combretaceae) is an endemic tree found in India and Sri Lanka and used traditionally for its cardioprotective and hepatoprotective effects. Arjunolic acid (AA) is an oleanane triterpenoid found mainly in the heartwood of T. arjuna. This study was aimed to evaluate the hepatoprotective effect of AA using cellular and rodent models of NAFLD. AA was isolated from the ethyl acetate extract of the heartwood of T. arjuna. The structure of AA was confirmed by physical and spectroscopic data. Steatosis was induced in HepG2 cells using palmitate-oleate mixture and the effects of AA on triglyceride accumulation and lipotoxicity were assessed. In vivo effect of AA on NAFLD was assessed using HFD fed rats. The treatment with AA did not affect the cell viability upto 100 μM and showed GI25 value of 379.9 μM in HepG2 cells. The treatment with AA significantly lowered the ORO concentration by 35.98% and triglyceride accumulation by 66.36% at 50 μM concentration (P < 0.005) compared to the vehicle treated group. The treatment with AA also reduced the leakage of ALT and AST by 61.11 and 48.29% in a significant manner (P < 0.005). The in vivo findings clearly demonstrated that the animals treated with AA at 25 and 50 mg/kg concentrations showed a significant decrease in the levels of transaminases, phosphatase and GGT (P < 0.005). In the liver, the expression of PPARα and FXRα expressions were upregulated, while PPARγ expression was downregulated by the treatment with AA. The liver histology of the animals showed reduction in steatosis and MNC infiltration. These preliminary evidences suggested that AA might be a promising lead to treat NAFLD. Future robust scientific studies on AA will lead to tailoring it for the treatment of NAFLD.",

But its fruit has not been used for any such purposes despite its potential to retard oxidation. Hence, the antioxidant potential of Arjuna fruit extract (AFE) in retarding lipid and protein oxidation of raw ground pork was evaluated during refrigerated storage for 9 days. METHODS: The AFEs were prepared using different solvents viz. ethanol (EH), water, ethanol: water (60:40) and methanol:hot water (60:40). The AFEs were analysed for total phenolic content (TPC), 2, 2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl radical scavenging activity and reducing power. Water extract (WE) and ethanol-water extract (EH-WE) were selected and incorporated at 1.0% into freshly minced pork meat and compared with a synthetic antioxidant, in retarding lipid and protein oxidation during storage. RESULTS: The TPC in AFEs using different solvents ranged from 11.04 to 16.53 mg gallic acid equivalents/g and extracts exhibited appreciable scavenging activity ranging from 50.02% to 58.62%. Arjuna extracts significantly (p<0.05) improved the colour score of meat samples by reducing the formation of metmyoglobin during storage. Both the AFEs (WE and EH-WE) significantly (p<0.05) lowered the thiobarbituric acid reactive substances value, peroxide formation and formation of protein carbonyls in raw pork than control sample during storage. Upon sensory evaluation of all samples, it was found that AFE treatment could prolong the storage period of meat samples, without influencing the colour and odour score, up to 6 days. CONCLUSION: AFEs used at 1% improved the oxidative stability, colour and odour score and prolonged the refrigerated shelf life of ground pork up 6 days. Therefore, AFE could be explored as an alternative natural antioxidant in retarding lipid and protein oxidation in meat products."

Hence, the present study was carried out to investigate the toxicity of methanolic extracts of Terminalia chebula fruit (TCF), Terminalia arjuna bark (TAB) and its bioactive constituent 7- Methyl gallic acid (7MG) under in vitro and in vivo conditions. In vitro toxicity profile of TCF, TAB and 7MG (250-2000 μg/ml) were assessed through cytotoxicity, hemolytic activity, mutagenicity and genotoxicity assays. Results of Ames test, comet assay, MTT and hemolytic assays illustrated that TCF, TAB and 7MG exhibited neither cytotoxic and genotoxic effect in PBMC nor hemolytic activity in RBC and no mutagenic effect in TA 98 and TA 100 up to a limited dose of 2000 μg/ml. Acute and subacute toxicity studies showed no significant change in body weight, behavior, hematology, biochemical parameters, organ weight and histopathology. Over all the results of acute and subacute toxicity studies conclude that oral administration of TCF, TAB and 7MG were observed to be relatively non-toxic and affords practical guidance for selecting safe dose for further clinical trials.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The aqueous extract of Terminalia arjuna (TA) bark (TAAqE) has been shown to have a direct inotropic effect on ventricular myocytes. Active constituents of TAAqE contain various flavonoids and proanthocyanidins, some of which are known to have antioxidant activities. Whether TAAqE affords a cardioprotective action against oxidative stress (OS) remains unclear. PURPOSE: Increased OS is one of the major mechanisms underlying cardiotoxicity induced by doxorubicin (DOX), a commonly-used anticancer agent. The aim of the present study was to investigate potential cardioprotective effect of TAAqE against DOX-induced OS and cardiac dysfunction. METHODS: OS and cytotoxicity were induced by 1 µM DOX for 24 h in H9c2 cells, a cardiac tissue-derived cell line, and left ventricular (LV) dysfunction was induced by intrapleural injection of DOX (accumulative 20 mg/kg body weight) to mice. Cellular oxidative levels and morphology were assessed using microscopy and oxidative-sensitive fluorescent dyes with and without co-treatment with TAAqE. LV function was monitored weekly with echocardiography. RESULTS: TAAqE reduced OS and preserved mitochondria and cell growth of H9c2 cells against DOX treatment. TAAqE (in drinking water) attenuated the decreased LV function and altered myocardial structure caused by DOX treatment. CONCLUSION: TAAqE exerts a protective action against cardiotoxicity caused by DOX in part via suppression of OS. Thus, TAAqE is a promising cardiotonic in adjuvant cancer chemotherapy.",

      "abstract": "The development of neuroprotective drugs through eco-friendly production routes is a major challenge for current pharmacology. The present study was carried out to synthesize gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) through biogenic route using ethanolic bark extract of Terminalia arjuna, a plant of high interest in Asian traditional medicine, and to evaluate its neuroprotective effects. The synthesized AuNPs were characterized by UV-Vis spectroscopy, FTIR spectroscopy, XRD, FESEM, EDX, HRTEM, DLS, and zeta potential analyses. UV-Vis spectroscopy showed a characteristics SPR absorption band at 536 nm specific for AuNPs. XRD, TEM, and FESEM analyses revealed the formation of face-centered cubic crystalline, spherical and triangular shaped AuNPs, with size ranging between 20 and 50 nm. DLS and ZP analysis illustrated that the average size of AuNPs was 30 nm, which was found to be stable at 45 mv. The neuroprotective potential of AuNPs was evaluated by assessing its antioxidant, cholinesterase inhibitory, and antiamyloidogenic activities. AuNPs showed dose-dependant inhibition of acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase with IC50 value of 4.25 ± 0.02 and 5.05 ± 0.02 μg/ml, respectively. In vitro antioxidant assays illustrated that AuNPs exhibited the highest reducing power and DPPH radical scavenging activity. In addition, AuNPs also efficiently suppressed the fibrillation of Aβ and destabilized the preformed mature fibrils. Results of toxicity studies in PBMC and adult zebra fish illustrated that AuNPs are non-toxic and biocompatible. Overall, our results highlighted the AuNPs promising potential in terms of antioxidant, anticholinesterase, antiamyloidogenic effects, and non-lethality allowing us to propose these nanomaterials as a suitable candidate for the development of drugs helpful in the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer's disease.

We hypothesized that aqueous stem bark extract of T. arjuna (TAE) may inhibit IL-18-induced atherosclerosis via NF-κB/PPAR-γ-mediated pathway in Apo E-/- mice. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 12-week-old, male Apo E-/- mice divided into four groups (n = 6/group) fed with normal chow-diet were employed: GP I: phosphate buffer saline (PBS) (2 month); GP II: rIL-18 (1 month) followed by PBS (1 month); GP III: rIL-18 (1 month) followed by TAE (1 month); GP IV: rIL-18 (1 month) followed by atorvastatin (1 month). RESULTS: IL-18 treatment induced a significant increase (p < 0.001) in pro-inflammatory marker (IL-18) (170 ± 9.16 vs. 1178.66 ± 8.08, pg/ml), and downregulated cholesterol efflux gene (PPAR-γ) by ~0.6-fold vs. 1.00 in IL-18-treated mice as compared to the control animals, respectively. TAE treatment to both groups caused a significant reduction in IL-18 to 281.66 ± 9.60 vs. 1178.66 ± 8.08 (pg/ml), upregulated cholesterol efflux gene by ~1.5- vs. 0.6-fold in TAE-treated group, decreased atherogenic lipids, and percentage atherosclerotic lesion area, demonstrating comparable effects with atorvastatin.

      "abstract": "Domoic acid is a potent marine algal toxin produced by diatomic genus of Pseudo-nitzschia causing amnesic shell fish poisoning. Domoic acid toxicosis mainly involves excitotoxic effects coupled with oxidative stress. The present study was aimed to evaluate the protective effects of hydro-alcoholic extract of Terminalia arjuna (TA) against domoic acid induced toxic effects in Caco-2 cell line. It was observed that the toxicity induced by domoic acid in Caco-2 cells was mediated by oxidative insult leading to morphological changes, DNA damage and apoptosis. In our study pre-treatment of the cells with TA (10, 20 and 30 μg/ml) showed significant protection against domoic acid induced morphological, oxidative and apoptotic damages in a dose dependent manner. The effect of phytocompounds present in TA viz., kaempferol and arjungenin showed significant protection against domoic acid induced toxicity in Caco-2 cell line. Hence, it could be inferred that the protective effect of TA extract against domoic acid induced toxicity could be due to the individual or synergistic effects of kaempferol and argungenin. However, further clinical studies are warranted to consider TA as a natural remedy to prevent amnesic shell fish poisoning."

The bark of Terminalia arjuna (T. arjuna), very well known in Ayurveda for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases, possesses antioxidant and diuretic activity. The present study was undertaken to investigate the antiurolithiatic efficacy of aqueous extract of bark of T. arjuna on oxalate-induced injury to renal tubular epithelial cells. Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells were exposed to 2 mM oxalate for 48 h to evaluate the protective effect of T. arjuna aqueous extract on cell viability, CaOx crystal adherence and apoptotic changes caused by oxalate. The results confirmed that oxalate injured MDCK cells were protected by T. arjuna extract. On treatment with a range concentrations, the cell viability increased in a concentration dependent manner. Moreover, the extract prevented the interaction of the calcium oxalate (CaOx) crystals with the cell surface and reduced the number of apoptotic cells. The current data suggests that T. arjuna bark confers a cytoprotective role and based on our results it could be a potential candidate from natural plant sources against urolithiasis."

      "abstract": "ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Aqueous bark extract of Terminalia arjuna (TA) has been in use as an ethnomedicine for cardiovascular ailments in the Indian subcontinent for centuries. Studies using hemodynamic, ROS scavenging and anti-inflammatory parameters in animal models have shown its anti-atherogenic, hypotensive, inotropic, anti-inflammatory effects. However, details analysis on its effects on established molecular and cell biological markers are a prerequisite for its wider acceptance to the medical community. AIMS OF THE STUDY: To test the efficacy of TA extract in ameliorating cardiac hypertrophy induced by ISO in rats. METHODS: Cardiac hypertrophy was induced by ISO (5mg/kg/day s.c. for 14 days) in rats and a standardized aqueous extract of TA stem bark was orally administered by gavage. Total RNA and protein were isolated from control, ISO, ISO plus TA and TA treated rat hearts and analyzed for the transcripts for the markers of hypertrophy, signaling kinases, transcription factors and total protein profile. RESULTS: TA extract reversed the induction of fetal genes like β-myosin heavy chain, skeletal α-actin and brain natriuretic peptide in hypertrophic rat hearts. While ISO slightly increased the level of phospho-ERK, TA repressed it to about one third of the base line level. Survival kinase Akt, ER stress marker Grp78 and epigenetic regulator HDAC5 were augmented by ISO and TA restored them by various extents. ISO administration moderately increased the transcription factor NFκB binding activity, while coadministration of TA further increased it. AP-1 binding activity was largely unchanged by ISO treatment but it was upregulated when administered along with TA. MEF2D binding activity was increased by ISO and TA restored it to the baseline level. Global proteomic analysis revealed that TA treatment restored a subset of proteins up- and down-regulated in the hypertrophied hearts. Amongst those restored by TA were purinergic receptor X, myosin light chain 3, tropomyosin, and kininogen; suggesting a nodal role of TA in modulating cardiac function. CONCLUSIONS: This study for the first time reveals that TA partially or completely restores the marker mRNAs, signaling kinases, transcription factors and total protein profile in rat heart, thereby demonstrating its efficacy in preventing ISO-induced cardiac hypertrophy.",

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 25 samples of tube well water, fodder and buffalo blood were collected through a survey from arsenic contaminated areas and 20 samples from the uncontaminated, i.e., control areas of Ludhiana district, Punjab for determination of arsenic concentration. A total of 30 buffaloes (selected from above 45 animals) were divided into three groups of 10 each on the basis of blood arsenic level, viz., control group: Clinically healthy buffaloes from the uncontaminated area with the blood arsenic level within the normal limit (0-0.05 ppm); Arsenic exposed group: Buffaloes exposed to arsenic through intake of contaminated water and fodder in the arsenic affected area with the blood arsenic level above the normal limit of 0-0.05 ppm; treatment group: Arsenic exposed buffaloes treated with T. arjuna bark powder orally at 42 mg/kg b.w. OD for 30 days. Single blood samples were collected from control and arsenic exposed groups. Blood samples from the treatment group were collected on 0, 15th, and 30th day of treatment along with one sample on the 45th day, i.e., after withdrawal of treatment. Activities of alkaline phosphatase (ALP), gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and creatine kinase (CK) were assayed in plasma. RESULTS: Significantly (p<0.05) higher arsenic concentration was observed in tube well water, fodder and buffalo blood samples collected from the arsenic contaminated area. A significant positive correlation was noticed between arsenic concentrations of tube well water, fodder and untreated buffalo blood samples, collected from the arsenic affected area. ALP, GGT, LDH, and CK activities were significantly (p<0.05) increased in the arsenic exposed buffaloes compared to control. Treatment with T. arjuna bark powder reduced the plasma levels of ALP, GGT, LDH, and CK in arsenic exposed buffaloes comparable to that of control. CONCLUSION: Exposure to arsenic altered the hepatic and muscle function enzymes in buffaloes. T. arjuna bark powder supplementation lowered the ALP, GGT, LDH, and CK activities in arsenic exposed buffaloes toward the values exhibited by the control group."

      "abstract": "Kidney stone formation during hyperoxaluric condition is inherently dependent on the interaction between renal epithelial cells and calcium oxalate (CaOx) crystals. Although modern medicine has progressed in terms of removal of these stones, recurrence and persistent side effects restricts their use. Strategies involving plant based agents which could be used as adjunct therapy is an area which needs to be explored. Plant proteins having antilithiatic activity is a hitherto unexplored area and therefore, we conducted a detailed identification and characterization of antilithiatic proteins from Terminalia arjuna (T. arjuna). Proteins were isolated from the dried bark of T. arjuna and those having molecular weights > 3 kDa were subjected to anion exchange chromatography followed by gel filtration chromatography. Four proteins were identified exhibiting inhibitory activity against CaOx crystallization and crystal growth kinetics The cytoprotective and anti-apoptotic efficacy of these purified proteins was further investigated on oxalate injured renal epithelial cells (MDCK and NRK-52E) wherein, injury due to oxalate was significantly attenuated and led to a dose dependent increase in viability of these cells. These proteins also prevented the interaction of the CaOx crystals to the cell surface and reduced the number of apoptotic cells. Identification of these 4 anionic proteins from the bark of T. arjuna was carried out by Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight Mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). This was followed by database search with the MASCOT server and sequence similarity was found with Nuclear pore anchor, DEAD Box ATP-dependent RNA helicase 45, Lon protease homolog 1 and Heat shock protein 90-3. These novel proteins isolated from T. arjuna have the potential to inhibit CaOx crystallization and promote cell survival and therefore, offer novel avenues which need to be explored further for the medical management of urolithiasis.",

      "abstract": "ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: The stem bark of Terminalia arjuna (Roxb.) is widely used in Ayurveda in various cardiovascular diseases. Many animal and clinical studies have validated its anti-ischemic, antihypertensive, antihypertrophic and antioxidant effects. Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is a fatal disease which causes right ventricular hypertrophy and right heart failure. Pulmonary vascular smooth muscle hypertrophy and increased oxidative stress are major pathological features of PH. As available limited therapeutic options fail to reduce the mortality associated with PH, alternative areas of therapy are worth exploring for potential drugs, which might be beneficial in PH. AIM OF THE STUDY: The effect of a standardised aqueous extract of the stem bark of Terminalia arjuna (Roxb.) in preventing monocrotaline (MCT)-induced PH in rat was investigated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study was approved by Institutional Animal Ethics Committe. Male Wistar rats (150-200g) were randomly distributed into five groups; Control, MCT (50mg/kg subcutaneously once), sildenafil (175µg/kg/day three days after MCT for 25 days), and Arjuna extract (TA125 and TA250 mg/kg/day orally after MCT for 25 days). PH was confirmed by right ventricular weight to left ventricular plus septum weight (Fulton index), right ventricular systolic pressure (RVSP), echocardiography, percentage medial wall thickness of pulmonary arteries (%MWT). Oxidative stress in lung was assessed by super oxide dismutase (SOD), catalase, reduced glutathione (GSH) and thiobarbituric acid reactive substance (TBARS). The protein expressions of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase (NOX-1) in lung and gene expression of Bcl2 and Bax in heart were analyzed by Western blot and RT PCR respectively. RESULTS: MCT caused right ventricular hypertrophy (0.58±0.05 vs 0.31±0.05; P<0.001 vs. control) and increase in RVSP (33.5±1.5 vs 22.3±4.7mm of Hg; P<0.001). Both sildenafil and Arjuna prevented hypertrophy and RVSP. Pulmonary artery acceleration time to ejection time ratio in echocardiography was decreased in PH rats (0.49±0.05 vs 0.32±0.06; P<0.001) which was prevented by sildenafil (0.44±0.06; P<0.01) and TA250 (0.45±0.06; P<0.01). % MWT of pulmonary arteries was increased in PH and was prevented by TA250. Increase in TBARS (132.7±18.4 vs 18.8±1.6nmol/mg protein; P<0.001) and decrease in SOD (58.4±14.1 vs 117.4±26.9U/mg protein; P<0.001) and catalase (0.30±0.05 vs 0.75±0.31U/mg protein; P<0.001) were observed in lung tissue of PH rats, which were prevented by sildenafil and both the doses of Arjuna extract. Protein expression of NOX1 was significantly increased in lung and gene expression of Bcl2/Bax ratio was significantly decreased in right ventricle in MCT-induced PH, both were significantly prevented by Arjuna and sildenafil. CONCLUSIONS: Aqueous extract of Terminalia arjuna prevented MCT-induced pulmonary hypertension which may be attributed to its antioxidant as well as its effects on pulmonary arteriolar wall thickening.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The stem bark of Terminalia arjuna (Roxb. ex DC.) Wight and Arn. (Arjuna) is used in Indian system of medicine (Ayurveda) for treatment of various cardiac diseases, including heart failure. However, well designed clinical trials exploring its efficacy and safety in chronic heart failure (CHF) are lacking. PURPOSE: To ascertain the add-on efficacy and safety of a standardized water extract of stem bark of Arjuna (Arjuna extract) in CHF patients on standard pharmacotherapy. STUDY DESIGN: Double-blind, parallel, randomized, placebo-controlled add-on clinical trial. METHODS: After approval of institutional ethics committee, 100 patients of CHF of New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class II on standard pharmacotherapy having an echocardiographic left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≤ 40% were consecutively recruited with informed consent and randomized 1:1 to Arjuna extract 750 mg or matching placebo twice daily. The primary outcome measure was change in LVEF at 12 weeks. Secondary outcome measures included changes in (i) NYHA functional class, (ii) distance covered in 6 min walk test (6MWT), (iii) quality of life (QoL), as determined by the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ), (iv) plasma brain natriuretic peptide, (v) plasma cytokines (interleukin-6, high sensitivity C-reactive protein and tumour necrosis factor-α) and (vi) oxidative stress markers [serum thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), red blood cell (RBC) superoxide dismutase (SOD), RBC catalase and RBC glutathione (GSH)] at 6 and 12 weeks. Safety assessment was done by adverse event monitoring and laboratory investigations. Results were expressed as mean ± SD or median (interquartile range) and analysed with intention-to- treat principle using appropriate two-sided statistical tests. A p-value < 0.05 was considered significant. RESULTS: Arjuna extract was well-tolerated, but did not change LVEF (24.3 ± 7.1 versus 25.5 ± 7.7%; p = 0.4) or secondary outcome measures except preservation of RBC catalase activity [1275(104, 10350) versus 1243.5(104, 10350) U/g haemoglobin; p = 0.01] compared to placebo. Significantly greater percentage increases occurred in distance covered in 6 MWT, RBC-SOD, RBC catalase, RBC GSH and in symptom severity and stability domains of KCCQ in patients on Arjuna extract versus those on placebo, on a post-hoc analysis, between subgroups of patients who improved in these outcomes. CONCLUSION: Arjuna extract did not improve LVEF in CHF patients over 12 weeks, although there was improvement in functional capacity, antioxidant reserves and symptom-related QoL domains in some patients.",

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Rats, divided into three groups, and were administered with the methanolic extract of the bark powder of Terminalia arjuna (TAME) by oral gavage (6.75 and 9.75 mg/kg: 6 days/week for 12 weeks). Control and TAME extract treated rat hearts were subjected to in-vitro global ischemic reperfusion injury (5 min perfusion, 9 min noflow and 12 min reperfusion). RESULTS: Oxidative stress in MIRI was evidenced by, raised levels of myocardial TBARS and depletion of endogenous myocardial antioxidants GSH, SOD and catalase. Western blot analysis showed a single band corresponding to 72 kDa in homogenates of hearts from rat treated with both the doses. In the methanolic extract of the bark powder of Terminalia arjuna treatment groups, both the doses had better recovery of myocardial function, with significant reduction in TBARS, and rise in SOD, GSH, catalase were observed. CONCLUSION: The results of the present study suggest that the methanolic extract of the bark powder of Terminalia arjuna in rat induces myocardial HSP72 and augments myocardial endogenous antioxidants, without causing any cellular injury and offers better cardioprotection against oxidative stress associated with myocardial IR injury."

      "abstract": "Worldwide, Ischemic heart disease (IHD) affects a large population. Implication of myocardial infarction (MI) and its multiple pathophysiology in cardiac function is well known. Further, isoproterenol (ISP) is known to induce MI. Today, there is an urgent need for effective drug that could limit the myocardial injury. Therapeutic intervention with antioxidants has been shown useful in preventing the deleterious changes produced by ISP. Here, we investigated the protective effects of oral pre-treatment of hydroalcoholic extract of bark of Terminalia arjuna (HETA) on biochemical and apoptotic changes during cardiotoxicity induced by isoproterenol (ISP) in rats. HETA was orally administered at a dose of 100, 200 and 400 mg/kg body wt., for 30 days with concurrent administration of ISP (85 mg/kg body wt.) on days 28th and 29th at an interval of 24 h. ISP caused deleterious changes in the myocardium and significantly increased (P < 0.05) malondialdehyde, serum glutamate oxaloacitate transaminase, creatine kinase-MB, lactate dehydrogenase and troponin-I. However, it significantly decreased (P < 0.05) glutathione and superoxide dismutase compared to healthy control. Oral pre-treatment of HETA for 30 days significantly decreased (P < 0.05) the biochemical parameters of oxidative stress and cardiac markers as compared to ISP control. Histopathological findings also revealed that architecture of the myocardium was restored towards normal in HETA pre-treated group. Overall, the present study has shown that the hydroalcoholic extract of bark of T. arjuna (HETA) attenuates oxidative stress, apoptosis and improves antioxidant status in ISP-induced cardiotoxicity in rats.",

      "abstract": "Increasing demand for eco-friendly botanical piscicides and pesticides as replacements for harmful synthetic chemicals has led to investigation of new sources of plant materials. Stem bark of Terminalia arjuna, which has been used as a popular folk medicine since ancient time, was examined for its piscicidal activity. This study aims to determine toxicity of ethanol extract of T. arjuna bark on fresh water stinging catfish (Heteropneustes fossilis), along with evaluation of changes in hematological parameters of the fishes exposed to a lethal concentration. The percent mortality of fishes varied significantly in response to concentrations of the extract and exposure times (between exposure time F = 36.57, p < 0.001; between concentrations F = 39.93, p < 0.001). The lethal concentrations (LC50) of ethanol extract were found to be 12.7, 8.94, 5.63 and 4.71 mg/l for 24, 48, 72 and 96 h, respectively. During acute toxicity test, blood samples of treatment fishes showed significant decreases in the red blood cells count, hematocrit content, hemoglobin concentration, mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration and plasma protein level when compared to those of the control group, while there were significant increases in the mean corpuscular volume, mean corpuscular hemoglobin, white blood cells count and plasma glucose concentration. These results suggest that T. arjuna bark extract could be considered as a potent piscicide due to its toxic effect on fish, particularly fish hematology.",

We proposed to evaluate its antioxidant potential against focal cerebral ischemia reperfusion (I/R) injury in rats subjected to middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). METHODS: In the present study, rats were randomly divided into a sham, MCAO, AA (10 and 20mg/kg) treated groups. Rats received their respective treatment orally by gavage for 7 days prior to MCAO. Rats were anaesthetized with ketamine (100mg/kg), xylazine (10mg/kg) and subjected to 2h occlusion and 22h reperfusion. Neurological deficit, brain water content and oxidative stress markers were measured after 22h of reperfusion. RESULTS: Rats pretreated with AA showed significantly reduced neurological deficit score, infarct size. AA prevented neuronal damage induced by I/R by regulating the levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), reduced glutathione (GSH), nitric oxide (NO), protein carbonyl content and mitochondria generated reactive oxygen species. In addition, it also controlled the enzyme activities of Na(+)-K(+) ATPase, superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and glutathione reductase (GR). CONCLUSIONS: Pre-treatment with AA effectively prevented the cerebral I/R induced oxidative damage by virtue of its antioxidant potential. These results indicate that supplementation of AA may be beneficial in stroke prone population.",

To understand the specificity and efficacy of T. arjuna, we evaluated its effect through microarray and in silico analysis in few representative samples. Data was further validated via real-time PCR (n = 50) each at baseline, 3 months, and 6 months, respectively. rIL-18 cytokine was used to induce inflammation in vitro to compare its effects with atorvastatin. T. arjuna significantly down-regulated TG, VLDL-C, and immuno-inflammatory markers in stable CAD versus placebo-treated subjects. Microarray and pathway analysis of a few samples from T. arjuna/placebo-treated groups and real-time PCR validation further confirmed our observations.

Its bark decoction is being used in the Indian subcontinent for anginal pain, hypertension, congestive heart failure, and dyslipidemia, based on the observations of ancient physicians for centuries. The utility of arjuna in various cardiovascular diseases needs to be studied further. Therefore, the present review is an effort to give a detailed survey of the literature summarizing the experimental and clinical studies pertinent to arjuna in cardiovascular disorders, which were particularly performed during the last decade. Systematic reviews, meta-analyses, and clinical studies of arjuna were retrieved through the use of PubMed, Google Scholar, and Cochrane databases. Most of the studies, both experimental and clinical, have suggested that the crude drug possesses anti-ischemic, antioxidant, hypolipidemic, and antiatherogenic activities. Its useful phytoconstituents are: Triterpenoids, β-sitosterol, flavonoids, and glycosides. Triterpenoids and flavonoids are considered to be responsible for its beneficial antioxidant cardiovascular properties. The drug has shown promising effect on ischemic cardiomyopathy. So far, no serious side effects have been reported with arjuna therapy. However, its long-term safety still remains to be elucidated. Though it has been found quite useful in angina pectoris, mild hypertension, and dyslipidemia, its exact role in primary/secondary coronary prevention is yet to be explored."

METHODS: Arthritis was induced in rats by intradermal injection of the collagen-complete Freund's adjuvant emulsion. Right hind paw thickness was measured as a primary marker for severity of arthritis. Biochemical parameters such as tissue levels of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase, reduced glutathione (GSH), nitrites and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) were measured to determine the effect of treatment on antioxidant defenses. Articular elastase (ELA) level in the arthritic tissue was measured as a marker for neutrophil infiltration. RESULT: Terminalia arjuna bark extract administration significantly inhibited the increase in paw thickness induced by immunization with collagen as compared to CIA-control animals. Further, it attenuated the fall in tissue SOD and GSH levels and mitigated the increase in tissue nitrites and TBARS levels as compared to CIA-control animals. Tissue ELA levels, which were significantly increased in the CIA-control animals as compared to normal animals were also significantly reduced by TABE administration. CONCLUSION: Results of our study demonstrate the antioxidant and antiarthritic activity of TABE in CIA in rats. We believe that TABE could find clinical application in the management of rheumatoid arthritis and associated disorders.",

METHODS: Wistar albino rats were pre-treated with hydroalcoholic extract of T. arjuna (HETA) and α-tocopherol (100 mg/kg b. w) daily for 30 days. Isoproterenol (ISP, 85 mg/kg b.w) was administered on 28th and 29th days at an interval of 24 hr. RESULTS: ISP treated rats showed significant increase in lipid peroxidation (MDA), cardiac markers (CK-MB, SGOT, Trop I and LDH), pro-inflammatory cytokine (IL-6, CRP, TNF-α) levels and apoptotic markers (Bcl-2/Bax) as compared to healthy group. Pre-treatment with HETA 100 mg/kg b. w, reduced the elevated levels of these markers and significant effect (p<0.05) were observed with the combination of HETA and α-tocopherol at a dose of 100 mg/kg b. w, which was further confirmed by histopathological studies. CONCLUSION: The present study concluded that the combination of α-tocopherol (100 mg/kg b. w) and hydroalcoholic extract of T. arjuna (100 mg/kg b. w) augments endogenous antioxidant compounds of rat heart and also prevents the myocardium from ISP-induced myocardial injury and it may have therapeutic and prophylactic value in the treatment of ischemic heart disease.",

Wight & Arn. is one of the most popular and beneficial medicinal plants in indigenous system of medicine for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. This comprehensive review provides latest updates on traditional use, phytochemistry, pharmacological and toxicological data, clinical efficacy and safety of Terminalia arjuna as well as outlined strategies for future research and development to scientifically validate the therapeutic potential of this plant. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Information about Terminalia arjuna was collected via a systematic electronic and library search of various indexed and non-indexed journals, some local books and varied articles published on ethnopharmacology, phytochemistry and traditional uses. Various pre-clinical (2000-2014) and clinical studies (1990-2014) have also been considered regarding efficacy and safety profile of Terminalia arjuna. RESULTS: Evidence from various in vitro, in vivo and clinical trials reveal the pleiotropic effects of Terminalia arjuna such as anti-atherogenic, hypotensive, inotropic, anti-inflammatory, anti-thrombotic and antioxidant actions for treatment of various cardiovascular disorders. It is clearly documented that this plant has a good safety profile when used in conjunction with other conventional drugs. However, there is a paucity of data regarding the exact molecular mechanism of its action, appropriate form of drug administration, whether whole crude drug or aqueous or alcoholic extract should be used, toxicological studies and its interaction with other drugs. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, this review highlights the importance as well as pleiotropic actions and functional aspects of Terminalia arjuna especially in cardiovascular diseases. Though, various pharmacological studies and clinical trials support its benefit in the CVD as per traditional use, new clinical trials using more rigorous state of the art technology and in a larger population setup are warranted to assess the traditional putative efficacy of Terminalia arjuna.",

      "abstract": "Background. Terminalia arjuna is a popular Indian medicinal plant with its bark been used for over centuries as cardiotonic. The bark has been found to contain several bioactive compounds including saponins and flavonoids. A number of experimental and clinical studies have been conducted to explore therapeutic potential of Terminalia arjuna in cardiovascular ailments specially in patients of coronary heart disease. A number of narrative reviews have been done but no systematic review has been conducted to date. Objective. To systematically review and conduct a meta-analysis on the available literature evaluating the efficacy of Terminalia arjuna in patients of chronic stable angina. Study selection. We included randomised, pseudo-randomized and before-after comparative studies which compared Terminalia arjuna/commercial preparation of Terminalia arjuna with current standard/ conventional treatment regimens in patients with chronic stable angina. Findings. Studies were found to be of poor methodological design. We found no significant difference in the Terminalia arjuna group as compared to control arm in the outcomes for which we were able to pool data and undertake meta-analysis. Conclusions. Currently, the evidence is insufficient to draw any definite conclusions in favour of or against Terminalia arjuna in patients of chronic stable angina. Further, well-controlled multicentric clinical trials need to be conducted in large number of patients to explore the therapeutic potential of Terminalia arjuna if any."

The present study was designed to examine the therapeutic potential of Terminalia arjuna bark extract in improving myocardial function in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats. After 8 weeks of STZ administration, rats showed a decline in left ventricular pressure (LVP), maximal rate of rise and fall in LVP (LV [dP/dt] max and LV [dP/dt] min), cardiac contractility index (LV [dP/dt] max/LVP), and rise in LV end-diastolic pressure. Altered lipid profile, oxidative stress, and increased levels of endothelin 1 (ET-1), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and interleukin 6 (IL-6) along with histological changes in heart and pancreas were observed in diabetic rats. T arjuna significantly attenuated cardiac dysfunction and myocardial injury in diabetic rats. It also reduced oxidative stress, ET-1, and inflammatory cytokine levels. The decreased body weight, heart rate blood pressure, and raised blood sugar in diabetic rats did not improve after T arjuna therapy. Results suggest that T arjuna bark extract improves the altered myocardial function in diabetic rats possibly through maintaining endogenous antioxidant enzyme activities, decreasing ET-1 and cytokine levels.",

      "abstract": "The bark of Terminalia arjuna (TA) has been used for centuries in ayurvedic medicine as cardiotonics for treatment of cardiac disorders. It became recently available as over-the-counter supplements marketed for maintaining a healthy heart. However, the cellular mechanism of its cardiotonic effect remains undefined. The present study was designed to investigate the physicochemical property and inotropic effect of the aqueous extract of TA bark (TA(AqE)) on adult rat ventricular myocytes in comparison with extracts prepared sequentially with organic solvents (organic extracts). The kinetics of myocyte contraction and caffeine-induced contraction were analyzed to assess the effect of TA(AqE) on sarcoplasmic reticular (SR) function. The inotropic effect of TA(AqE) was also compared with that of known cardiotonics, isoproterenol (ISO) and ouabain (Ouab). We found that TA(AqE) decoctions exerted positive inotropy, accelerated myocyte relaxation and increased caffeine-induced contraction concentration-dependently. In contrast, TA organic extracts caused interruption of excitability and arrhythmias without consistent inotropic action. In conclusion, TA(AqE)-induced cardiotonic action via enhancing SR function, a unique action minimizing the occurrence of arrhythmias, makes TA(AqE) a promising and relatively safe cardiotonic beneficial to the healthy heart and the treatment for chronic heart disease. The cardiotonic effect of TA(AqE) is consistent with the therapeutic property of TA bark used in ayurvedic medicine. The method of administration and/or selective omission of hydrophobic components from bark powder could be crucial to the efficacy and safety of TA bark in cardiac therapy and uses as over-the-counter supplements.",

      "abstract": "CONTEXT: Terminalia arjuna Roxb. (Combretaceae), commonly known as Arjuna, is a large tree grown throughout the Indian peninsula and used traditionally for several medicinal purposes. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate antihyperglycemic and antioxidant role of methanol extract of T. arjuna leaf (META) in Wistar rats. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Hyperglycemia was induced in rats by single intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin (STZ, 65 mg/kg body weight). Three days after STZ induction, the hyperglycemic rats were treated with META orally at the dose of 100 and 200 mg/kg body weight daily for 15 days. Glibenclamide (0.5 mg/kg, orally) was used as reference drug. The fasting blood glucose levels were measured on every fifth day during the 15-day treatment. Serum biochemical parameters such as serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase (SGPT), serum glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase (SGOT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), cholesterol, and total protein were estimated. Antioxidant properties were assessed by estimating hepatic lipid peroxidation, reduced glutathione (GSH), and catalase (CAT). RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: META at the dose of 100 and 200 mg/kg orally significantly (P < 0.001) and dose-dependently reduced and normalized blood glucose levels as compared with that of STZ control group. Serum biochemical parameters were significantly (P < 0.001) restored toward normal levels in META-treated rats as compared with STZ control. META treatment also significantly (P < 0.001) decreased lipid peroxidation and recovered GSH level and CAT activity toward normal as compared with STZ control. CONCLUSION: The present study infers that T. arjuna leaf demonstrated remarkable antihyperglycemic activity in STZ-induced diabetic rats. The potential antihyperglycemic action is plausibly due to its underlying antioxidant role.",

Various bioactive compounds, like triterpinoids, tannins, flavonoids and minerals have been isolated from the stem bark. A number of clinical studies have also reported its beneficial effects in patients of chronic stable angina, endothelial dysfunction, heart failure and even ischemic mitral regurgitation.

In the current study we have investigated the antioxidative properties of an ethanol extract of the bark of Terminalia arjuna (T. arjuna ethanol extract [TAEE]) against sodium fluoride (NaF)-induced oxidative stress in murine heart. Experimental mice were divided into four groups. The first group served as the normal control. The second group received NaF at a dose of 600 ppm through drinking water for 1 week and served as the toxin control. The third group was exposed to TAEE (at a dose of 50 mg/kg of body weight for 1 week) prior to NaF intoxication, and the last group was treated with vitamin C at a dose of 100 mg/kg body weight for 1 week prior to NaF intoxication and served as the positive control in the study. The activities of various antioxidant enzymes (superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione S-transferase), levels of cellular metabolites, reduced glutathione, and oxidized glutathione, levels of lipid peroxidation end products, and protein carbonyl contents were determined in the cardiac tissues of all the experimental animals. NaF intoxication significantly altered all the indices related to the prooxidant-antioxidant status of the heart; treatment with the active constituents prior to NaF administration, however, prevented these alterations. In addition, the ferric reducing/antioxidant power assay revealed that TAEE enhanced the cardiac intracellular antioxidant activity. Histological studies also demonstrated a cardioprotective action of TAEE. The combined results suggest that TAEE protects murine hearts from NaF-induced oxidative stress, probably via its antioxidant properties.",

Pretreatment of lymphocytes with TAE before ADR treatment resulted in a significant decline in micronuclei formation. Increasing doses of ADR caused a dose-dependent increase in the frequency of lymphocytes bearing one, two and multiple micronuclei. Prior exposure of lymphocytes to 15 microg/mL of TAE significantly reduced the frequency of lymphocytes bearing one, two and multiple micronuclei when compared with ADR-treated control. TAE-inhibited the induction of (*)OH (hydroxyl), O2(*-) (superoxide), DPPH (1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl), ABTS(*+) (2,2-azino-bis-3-ethyl benzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid) radicals in a dose-dependent manner.

H. pylori-induced gastric pathology is prevalent throughout the world. Herbal medicines are attracting attention because of their traditional values, popularity and belief, as well as for their advantages such as less toxicity, affordability and medicinal value. The present study aimed to evaluate the anti-ulcer effect of a methanolic extract of Terminalia arjuna (TA) against HP-LPS-induced gastric damage in rats. Ulcers were induced with HP-LPS (50 mug per animal) administered orally daily for 3 days. The efficacy of TA on gastric secretory parameters such as volume of gastric juice, pH, free and total acidity, pepsin concentration, and the cytoprotective parameters such as protein-bound carbohydrate complexes in gastric juice and gastric mucosa was assessed. The protective effect of TA was also confirmed by histopathological examination of gastric mucosa. HP-LPS-induced alterations in gastric secretory parameters were altered favourably in rats treated with TA, suggesting that TA has an anti-secretory role. Furthermore, HP-LPS-induced impairments in gastric defence factors were also prevented by treatment with TA. These results suggest that the severe cellular damage and pathological changes caused by HP-LPS are mitigated by TA; these effects are comparable with those of sucralfate. The anti-ulcer effect of TA may reflect its ability to combat factors that damage the gastric mucosa, and to protect the mucosal defensive factors.",

The present study was aimed to investigate the effects of butanolic fraction of Terminalia arjuna bark (TA-05) on Doxorubicin (Dox)-induced cardiotoxicity. Male wistar rats were used as in vivo model for the study. TA-05 was administered orally to Wistar rats at different doses (0.42 mg/kg, 0.85 mg/kg, 1.7 mg/kg, 3.4 mg/kg and 6.8 mg/kg) for 6 days/week for 4 weeks. Thereafter, all the animals except saline and TA-05-treated controls were administered 20 mg/kg Dox intraperitonially. There was a significant decrease in myocardial superoxide dismutase (38.94%) and reduced glutathione (23.84%) in animals treated with Dox. Concurrently marked increase in serum creatine kinase-MB (CKMB) activity (48.11%) as well as increase in extent of lipid peroxidation (2.55-fold) was reported. Co-treatment of TA-05 and Dox resulted in an increase in the cardiac antioxidant enzymes, decrease in serum CKMB levels and reduction in lipid peroxidation as compared to Dox-treated animals. Electron microscopic studies in Dox-treated animals revealed mitochondrial swelling, Z-band disarray, focal dilatation of smooth endoplasmic reticulum (SER) and lipid inclusions, whereas the concurrent administration of TA-05 led to a lesser degree of Dox-induced histological alterations. These findings suggest that butanolic fraction of Terminalia arjuna bark has protective effects against Dox-induced cardiotoxicity and may have potential as a cardioprotective agent.",

However, very little is known about carbon tetrachloride (CCl(4)) induced cardiac oxidative stress. The present study was conducted to find out CCl(4) induced oxidative insult in cardiac tissue and the cardioprotective effect of the 70% ethanol extractable active constituents of the bark of Terminalia arjuna (TA) against that stress in mice. Oral administration of CCl(4) at a dose of 1ml/kg body weight for 2 days significantly reduced the activities of antioxidant enzymes, superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and glutathione-S-transferase (GST), as well as depleted the level of reduced glutathione (GSH) in the cardiac tissue. In addition, extent of lipid peroxidation and the level of oxidized glutathione (GSSG) were increased under the same experimental conditions. Oral treatment of the active constituents of TA at a dose of 50mg/kg body weight for 7 days prior to CCl(4) administration significantly restored the activities of all antioxidant enzymes as well as increased the level of GSH and decreased the level of lipid peroxidation end products. In addition, FRAP assay showed that the active constituents of TA enhanced the cardiac intracellular antioxidant activity. Histological studies also supported the cardioprotective role of the active constituents. The active constituents-induced protective effect was compared with a known antioxidant, vitamin C. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report describing the CCl(4) induced cardiac oxidative stress and cardioprotective action of the active phytoconstituents of Terminalia arjuna against that oxidative insult."

In the present study we investigated the possible involvement of thyroid hormones in the amelioration of cardiac and hepatic lipid peroxidation (LPO) by a bark extract of the plant in albino rats. While L-thyroxine (L-T4) treatment increased the level of thyroid hormones, heart/body weight ratio as well as cardiac and hepatic lipid peroxidation, simultaneous administration of 21.42 and 42.84 mg/kg of the plant extract decreased the level of thyroid hormones and also the cardiac LPO, suggesting the possible mediation of the drug action through an inhibition in thyroid function. These effects were comparable to a standard antithyroid drug, propyl thiouracil (PTU). When the drug was administered to euthyroid animals, serum concentrations of thyroid hormones were decreased, whereas the hepatic LPO increased indicating a drug induced toxicity in euthyroid subjects. Although a suboptimal dose of the drug was found to be non-toxic to the liver, it appeared to be of no use, as it could neither affect the thyroid functions nor the cardiac lipid peroxidation. Since in euthyroid animals, thyroid hormones were decreased and hepatic LPO was increased, it is suggested that high amounts of this plant extract should not be consumed, as hepatotoxicity as well as hypothyroidism may be caused.",

The results indicated a statistically significant increase in the tensile strength of the incision wounds and the percent epithelialization of excision wounds compared with control (p < 0.05). However, topical treatment with fraction I, consisting mainly of tannins, was found to demonstrate a maximum increase in the tensile strength of incision wounds. Even with respect to excision wounds, the fastest rate of epithelialization was seen with fraction I. Hexosamine estimation of granulation tissue obtained from excision wounds revealed an increase in the hexosamine content with fraction I compared with the control. In addition, fraction I from the hydroalcohol extract of Arjuna bark possessed antimicrobial activity against tested microorganisms such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes but not Candida albicans. These results strongly document the beneficial effects of fraction I, consisting mainly of tannins, of Terminalia arjuna in the acceleration of the healing process. Thus, the present study validates the claim made with respect to the plant as well as corroborating the astringent effect of tannins by drawing the tissues closer together.",

METHODS: Human hepatoma cells were treated with different concentrations of ethanolic extract of T. arjuna and its cytotoxicity effect was measured by trypan blue exclusion method and lactate dehydrogenase leakage assay. Apoptosis was analyzed by light and fluorescence microscopic methods, and DNA fragmentation. The mechanism of apoptosis was studied with expression of p53 and caspase-3 proteins. Glutathione (GSH) content was also measured in HepG2 cells after T. arjuna treatment. RESULTS: T. arjuna inhibited the proliferation of HepG2 cells in a concentration-dependent manner. Apoptotic morphology was observed in HepG2 cells treated with T. arjuna at the concentrations of 60 and 100 mg/L. DNA fragmentation, accumulation of p53 and cleavage of procaspase-3 protein were observed in HepG2 cells after the treatment with T. arjuna. The depletion of GSH was observed in HepG2 cells treated with T. arjuna. CONCLUSION: T. arjuna induced cytotoxicity in HepG2 cells in vitro. Apoptosis of HepG2 cells may be due to the DNA damage and expression of apoptotic proteins. Depletion of GSH may be involved in the induction of apoptosis of HepG2 cells.",

Smoking cessation and antioxidant vitamin therapy are shown to have beneficial role by restoring altered endothelial physiology. The present study was aimed to determine whether Terminalia arjuna, an Indian medicinal plant with potent antioxidant constituents, would improve endothelial dysfunction in smokers. METHODS AND RESULTS: Eighteen healthy male smokers (age 28.16+/-9.45 years) and equal number of age-matched non-smoker controls participated in the study. The baseline brachial artery reactivity studies were performed using high frequency ultrasound according to standard protocol under identical conditions to determine endothelium-dependent, flow-mediated dilation and endothelium-independent nitroglycerine-mediated dilation. The two groups were matched regarding age, body mass index, blood pressure, serum cholesterol, mean resting vessel diameters and post-occlusion flow velocities (all p=NS). While flow-mediated dilation was significantly impaired amongst smokers compared to controls (4.71+/-2.22 v. 11.75+/-5.94%, p <0.005), the nitroglycerine-mediated dilation was similar in the two groups (20.35+/-3.89 v. 19.68+/-3.74%, p=NS). Subsequently the smokers were given Terminalia arjuna (500 mg q8h) or matching placebo randomly in a double blind cross-over design for two weeks each, followed by repetition of brachial artery reactivity studies to determine various parameters including flow-mediated dilation after each period. There was no significant difference as regards vessel diameter and flow velocities between the two therapies. However, the flow-mediated dilation showed significant improvement from baseline values after Terrminalia arjuna therapy but not with placebo (9.31+/-3.74 v. 5.17+/-2.42%, p <0.005). CONCLUSIONS: Smokers have impaired endothelium-dependent but normal endothelium-independent vasodilation as determined by brachial artery reactivity studies. Further, Terrminalia arjuna therapy for two weeks leads to significant regression of this endothelial abnormality amongst smokers.",

Previous laboratory investigations have demonstrated the use of the bark in cardiovascular complications. The present study was aimed to find the effect of 70% alcoholic extract of Terminalia arjuna on anaesthetized dog blood pressure and probable site of action. METHODS: Six dogs were anaesthetized with intraperitoneal injection of thiopental sodium and the blood pressure of each dog (n = 6) was measured from the left common carotid artery connected to a mercury manometer on kymograph. The femoral vein was cannulated for administration of drug solutions. The extract of T. arjuna (dissolved in propylene glycol) in the dose range of 5 to 15 mg/kg were administered intravenously in a pilot study and the dose (6 mg/kg) which produced appreciable hypotension was selected for further studies. RESULTS: Intravenous administration of T. arjuna produced dose-dependent hypotension in anaesthetized dogs. The hypotension produced by 6 mg/kg dose of the extract was blocked by propranolol but not by atropine or mepyramine maleate. This indicates that muscarinic or histaminergic mechanisms are not likely to be involved in the hypotension produced by the extract. The blockade by propranolol of the hypotension produced by T. arjuna indicates that the extract might contain active compound(s) possessing adrenergic beta2-receptor agonist action and/or that act directly on the heart muscle. CONCLUSION: The results indicated the likely involvement of peripheral mechanism for hypotension produced by the 70% alcoholic extract of Terminalia arjuna and lends support for the claims of its traditional usage in cardiovascular disorders.",

The TAAE was administered orally to Wistar albino rats (150-200 g) in three different doses, by gastric gavage [3.4 mg/kg: (T1), 6.75 mg/kg: (T2) and 9.75 mg/kg: (T3)] 6 days/week for 4 weeks. At the end of this period, all the animals, except the normal untreated rats that served as the control group, were administered isoproterenol (ISO) 85 mg/kg, S.C., for two consecutive days to induce in vivo myocardial injury. After 48 hours rats were anaesthetized with anaesthetic ether, then sacrificed and the hearts were harvested for biochemical and histological studies. A significant rise in myocardial thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) and loss of reduced glutathione (GSH), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (suggestive of increased oxidative stress) occurred in the hearts subjected to in vivo myocardial ischemic reperfusion injury. The 6.75 mg/kg TAAE treatment group (baseline) shows a significant increase in myocardial TBARS as well as endogenous antioxidants (GSH, SOD, and catalase), but not in the other treatment groups. In in vivo ischemic reperfusion injury of the TAAE treated rats there was a significant decrease in TBARS in all the groups. In 6.75 mg/kg treatment group, a significant rise in the levels of GSH, SOD and catalase were observed, and it shows better recovery profile than the other groups subjected to in vivo ischemic reperfusion injury. In histological studies, all the groups, except the isoproterenol treated group, showed preserved myocardium. The present study demonstrates that the 6.75 mg/kg TAAE augments endogenous antioxidant compounds of the rat heart and also prevents the myocardium from isoproterenol induced myocardial ischemic reperfusion injury.",

However, the topical treatment with tannins was found to be superior in both incision and excision wound studies. The estimated increase in hydroxyproline content of the granulation tissue of the excision wounds indicated rapid collagen turnover thus, leading to rapid healing of the wounds.",

Maximum 8.9 shoots/explant could be recorded after 30 days of inoculation on modified MS medium supplemented with BAP (0.5 mg/l). A proliferating shoot culture was established by reculturing the original cotyledonary nodes (2-3 times) on shoot multiplication medium after each harvest of the newly formed shoots. Shoots (each having 2-3 nodes/shoot) thus obtained were also used as a source of nodal explant that gave rise to 1-2 shoots when cultured on modified MS+BAP (0.5 mg/l) medium. Thus, 45-55 shoots could be obtained after 60 days of culture initiation from a single cotyledonary node. About 88% shoots rooted well after 15 hr pulse treatment with IBA (1 mg/l) in liquid MS medium followed by transfer to modified MS medium without IBA. About 80% of these plantlets were successfully acclimatized in plastic pots containing sand and soil mixture and 70% plantlets transferred in the field those survived even after 6 months of transplantation.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Terminalia arjuna, an Indian medicinal plant, has been reported to have beneficial effects in patients with ischemic heart disease in a number of small, open studies. The need for a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study with adequate sample size has long been felt. The bark extract (IPC-53) contains acids (arjunic acid, terminic acid), glycosides (arjunetin arjunosides I-IV), strong antioxidants (flavones, tannins, oligomeric proanthocyanidins), minerals. etc. and exhibits antifailure and anti-ischemic properties. METHODS AND RESULTS: Fifty-eight males with chronic stable angina (NYHA class II-III) with evidence of provocable ischemia on treadmill exercise test received Terminalia arjuna (500 mg 8 hourly), isosorbide mononitrate (40 mg/daily) or a matching placebo for one week each, separated by a wash-out period of at least three days in a randomized, double-blind, crossover design. They underwent clinical, biochemical and treadmill exercise evaluation at the end of each therapy which were compared during the three therapy periods. Terminalia arjuna therapy was associated with significant decrease in the frequency of angina and need for isosorbide dinitrate (5.69+/-6.91 mg/week v. 18.22+/-9.29 mg/week during placebo therapy, p<0.005). The treadmill exercise test parameters improved significantly during therapy with Terminalia arjuna compared to those with placebo. The total duration of exercise increased (6.14+/-2.51 min v. 4.76+/-2.38 min, p<0.005), maximal ST depression during the longest equivalent stages of submaximal exercise decreased (1.41+/-0.55 mm v. 2.21+/-0.56 mm, p<0.005), time to recovery decreased (6.49+/-2.37 min v. 9.27+/-3.39 min, p<0.005) and higher double products were achieved (25.75+/-4.81x10(3) v. 23.11+/-4.83x10(3), p<0.005) during Terminalia arjuna therapy. Similar improvements in clinical and treadmill exercise test parameters were observed with isosorbide mononitrate compared to placebo therapy. No significant differences were observed in clinical or treadmill exercise test parameters when Terminalia arjuna and isosorbide mononitrate therapies were compared. No significant untoward effects were reported during Terminalia arjuna therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Terminalia arjuna bark extract, 500 mg 8 hourly, given to patients with stable angina with provocable ischemia on treadmill exercise, led to improvement in clinical and treadmill exercise parameters as compared to placebo therapy. These benefits were similar to those observed with isosorbide mononitrate (40 mg/day) therapy and the extract was well tolerated. Limitations of this study include applicability of the results to only men with chronic stable angina but not necessarily to women, as they were not studied.",

We found that the phenolic fractions of T. arjuna inhibited revertants induced by the S9-dependent mutagen more remarkably than the direct-acting mutagens. Furthermore, the phenolic fractions showed maximum inhibition of 98% and 101.55%, respectively, in the pre-incubation mode of treatment against the mutations induced by 2AF. Overall, the fractions inhibited the revertants induced by S9-dependent mutagens more effectively than those induced by direct-acting mutagens. The percentage of inhibition was higher in the pre-incubation than with direct acting mutagens. The fraction insoluble in chloroform showed more inhibition than the soluble one, which corresponds to a higher polyphenol content in the insoluble fraction than in the soluble extract.",

Thereafter, rats were sacrificed either for determination of baseline changes in cardiac endogenous antioxidant compounds [superoxide dismutase (SOD), reduced glutathione (GSH) and catalase (CAT)] or the hearts were subjected to oxidative stress associated with in vitro ischemic-reperfusion injury (IRI). There was significant increase in the baseline contents of thiobarbituric acid reactive substance (TBARS) (a measure of lipid peroxidation) with both doses of TA. However, only in the 500 mg/kg treated group, this was accompanied by a simultaneous increase in SOD, GSH and CAT levels, but not in the 750 mg/kg treated group, where only CAT was raised. Significant rise in myocardial TBARS and loss of SOD, CAT and GSH (suggestive of increased oxidative stress) occurred in the vehicle-treated hearts subjected to in vitro IRI. Only hearts, harvested from the 500 mg/kg rats treated rats, were significantly protected from oxidative stress, when subjected to in vitro IRI. The results suggest that crude bark of TA augments endogenous antioxidant compounds of rat heart and also prevents oxidative stress associated with IRI of the heart.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the antioxidant and hypocholesterolaemic effects of Terminalia arjuna tree bark (a popular cardiotonic substance in Indian pharmacopoeia) and to compare it with a known antioxidant, vitamin E, we performed a randomized controlled trial. METHODS: One hundred and five successive patients with coronary heart disease (CHD) presenting to our centre were recruited and using a Latin-square design divided into 3 groups of 35 each. The groups were matched for age, lifestyle and dietary variables, clinical diagnosis and drug treatment status. None of the patients was on lipid-lowering drugs. Supplemental vitamins were stopped for one month before study began and American Heart Association Step II dietary advice was given to all. At baseline, total cholesterol, triglycerides, HDL and LDL cholesterol and lipid peroxide estimated as thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) were determined. Group I received placebo capsules; Group II vitamin E capsules 400 units/day; and Group III received finely pulverized T. arjuna tree bark-powder (500 mg) in capsules daily. Lipids and lipid peroxide levels were determined at 30 days follow-up. RESULTS: Response rate in various groups varied from 86% to 91%. No significant changes in total, HDL, LDL cholesterol and triglycerides levels were seen in Groups I and II (paired t-test p > 0.05). In Group III there was a significant decrease in total cholesterol (-9.7 +/- 12.7%), and LDL cholesterol (-15.8 +/- 25.6%) (paired t-test p < 0.01). Lipid peroxide levels decreased significantly in both the treatment groups (p < 0.01). This decrease was more in vitamin E group (-36.4 +/- 17.7%) as compared to the T. arjuna group (-29.3 +/- 18.9%). CONCLUSIONS: Terminalia arjuna tree bark powder has significant antioxidant action that is comparable to vitamin E. In addition, it also has a significant hypocholesterolaemic effect.",

Although the transformed cells appeared to have fragmented nucleus by Hoechst staining, no deoxy-ribonucleic acid laddering effect was observed. In response to the extract treatment, the tumor suppressor protein, p53, was induced in U2OS but not in U251 and WI-38 cells. A cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, p21WAF1, was induced in transformed cells only.

      "abstract": "Twelve patients with refractory chronic congestive heart failure (Class IV NYHA), related to idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (10 patients); previous myocardial infarction (one patient) and peripartum cardiomyopathy (one patient), received Terminalia Arjuna, an Indian medicinal plant, as bark extract (500 mg 8-hourly) or matching placebo for 2 weeks each, separated by 2 weeks washout period, in a double blind cross over design as an adjuvent to maximally tolerable conventional therapy (Phase I). The clinical, laboratory and echocardiographic evaluation was carried out at baseline and at the end of Terminalia Arjuna and placebo therapy and results were compared. Terminalia Arjuna, compared to placebo, was associated with improvement in symptoms and signs of heart failure, improvement in NYHA Class (Class III vs. Class IV), decrease in echo-left ventricular enddiastolic (125.28 +/- 27.91 vs. 134.56 +/- 29.71 ml/m2; P < 0.005) and endsystolic volume (81.06 +/- 24.60 vs. 94.10 +/- 26.42 ml/m2; P < 0.005) indices, increase in left ventricular stroke volume index (44.21 +/- 11.92 vs. 40.45 +/- 11.56 ml/m2; P < 0.05) and increase in left ventricular ejection fractions (35.33 +/- 7.85 vs. 30.24 +/- 7.13%; P < 0.005). On long term evaluation in an open design (Phase II), wherein Phase I participants continued Terminalia Arjuna in fixed dosage (500 mg 8-hourly) in addition to flexible diuretic, vasodilator and digitalis dosage for 20-28 months (mean 24 months) on outpatient basis, patients showed continued improvement in symptoms, signs, effort tolerance and NYHA Class, with improvement in quality of life.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

      "abstract": "The effect of bark powder of Terminalia arjuna, an indigenous drug, on anginal frequency, blood pressure, body mass index, blood sugar, cholesterol and HDL-cholesterol was studied in 15 stable (Group A) and 5 unstable (Group B) angina patients before and 3 months after T. arjuna therapy. Tread mill test (TMT) and echocardiographic left ventricular ejection fraction was evaluated in some cases. There was 50% reduction in anginal episodes in Group A cases (P < 0.01). TMT performance improved from moderate to mild changes in 5 patients and one with mild changes became negative for ischemia. The time to the onset of angina and appearance of ST-T changes on TMT after T. arjuna was delayed significantly. However, in patients with unstable angina there was an insignificant reduction in anginal frequency. These patients also needed diltiazem, B-blockers and nitroglycerine in addition to T. arjuna. The drug lowered systolic blood pressure and body mass index to a significant level (p < 0.05) and increased HDL-cholesterol only slightly along with marginal improvement in left ventricular ejection fraction in stable angina patients. There were no deleterious effects on liver or kidney functions. Our results suggest that monotherapy with T. arjuna is fairly effective in patients with symptoms of stable angina pectoris. However, it has a limited role in unstable angina.",
