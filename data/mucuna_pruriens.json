      "abstract": "Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) poses significant challenges as it lacks specific treatment approaches. In this study, we synthesized niobium-nitrogen-doped titanium dioxide (Nb-NTO) nanoparticles (NPs) functionalized with Mentha arvensis ethanolic and Mucuna pruriens methanolic extracts and evaluated their anti-cancer potential against MDA-MB-231 TNBC cells. The functionalization of doped Nb-NTO NPs with Mentha arvensis and Mucuna pruriens extract exhibited significant synergistic effects, reducing cell viability in a dose-dependent manner with enhanced cytotoxicity at lower concentrations compared to individual treatments. Microscopic analysis revealed morphological changes indicative of apoptosis and necrosis, while flow cytometry demonstrated increased apoptotic and necrotic cell populations in the combination-treated groups. These treatments also significantly reduced the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IL-8, suggesting modulation of the inflammatory tumor microenvironment. Furthermore, the functionalized Nb-NTO NPs effectively targeted cancer stem cell (CSC) properties, inhibiting mammosphere formation and clonogenic survival and downregulating critical CSC markers, including c-Myc, OCT4, and NANOG. This study highlights the potential of Nb-NTO NPs functionalized with Mentha arvensis and Mucuna pruriens as a novel therapeutic strategy for TNBC, addressing key hallmarks of cancer, including apoptosis, inflammation, and CSC targeting. While these findings demonstrate promising in vitro anti-cancer efficacy, further in vivo validation and mechanistic studies are necessary to advance these treatments toward clinical anti-cancer applications."

      "abstract": "Levodopa remains central to Parkinson's disease (PD) treatment, but long-term use can cause motor complications, highlighting the need for additional therapies. Mucuna pruriens (MP), a natural source of levodopa, shows potential in managing these complications. Further research is needed to compare its pharmacokinetics (PK) and clinical outcomes with traditional levodopa formulations. This randomised, single-blind, crossover trial compared the PK, clinical outcomes, and safety of MP powder against levodopa/benserazide dispersible tablets (Levodopa DT) in PD patients with motor complications. Twelve participants were recruited to receive either 30 g of MP powder or two 100/25 levodopa DT in separate sessions with a two-week washout between sessions. Key PK parameters (AUC, Cmax, Tmax, and t½) were measured. Clinical assessments used standard rating scales and adverse events were recorded. Data from 11 participants were analysed after one withdrawal. MP powder demonstrated significantly higher overall drug exposure, with a geometric mean AUC0-∞ of 12,424.81 compared to 7981.69 ng·h/mL for levodopa DT. The geometric mean ratio was 155.67% (90% CI 134.59-180.04), exceeding the bioequivalence acceptance range of 80-125%. However, the two treatments exhibited similar Tmax and t₁/₂ values, indicating comparable rates of absorption and elimination. Clinically, MP provided a longer ON state without dyskinesia-232.2 min versus 161.8 min for levodopa DT (p = 0.01). Mild and transient adverse events, such as nausea and dizziness, were more frequently associated with MP. MP offers superior drug exposure and extends the ON state without increasing dyskinesia, positioning it as a promising alternative to synthetic levodopa for managing motor symptoms. These findings support MP's potential role in alleviating motor complications in PD treatment."

      "abstract": "Depression is a mental disorder that depicts a wide variety of symptoms, including mood and cognitive alterations, as well as recurrent thoughts of death or suicide. It could become the second leading cause of premature death or disability worldwide. Treatments with conventional antidepressants have several limitations in terms of effectiveness, side effects, and high costs. Therefore, medicinal plants such as Mucuna pruriens are potent candidates for treating depressive disorders. This review shows a compendium of evidence supporting the antidepressant effect of the Mucuna pruriens plant in diverse animal models. This includes the mechanisms of action underlying the antidepressant activity of the treatment concerning dopamine, serotonin, norepinephrine, reactive oxygen species, nitric oxide, cortisol, and inflammation. Clinical trials are needed to study the efficacy and safety of Mucuna pruriens for depression."

      "abstract": "Modulation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway may aid in discovering new medications for the effective management of pulmonary artery hypertension (PAH). Given the therapeutic potential of Mucuna pruriens in several diseases, the present study aimed to analyze interactions of different bioactive compounds of Mucuna pruriens plant seeds with Wnt/β-catenin pathway targeting its various components like Wnt 3a, Frizzled 1, LRP 5/6, β-catenin, Disheveled, cyclin D1 by in silico analysis. The proposed work is based on computational analysis including ADME/T properties, by a Swiss ADME server. To understand the molecular interaction pattern Schrodinger, suit a stand-alone software was used to predict the interaction of bioactive molecules of Mucuna Pruriens with target proteins that are involved in Wnt/ β catenin pathway. Further, the simulation pattern of the top docked complex was subjected to MD simulation in Desmond for 100 ns. Bioactive molecules from Mucuna Pruriens have drug-like properties and minimal toxicity. Further, the docking study revealed that among the nine compounds, three compounds (Gallic acid, L-dopa, and β-sitosterol) showed good interaction with target proteins. As gallic acid showed good interaction with all target proteins, the docked complex was subjected to MD simulation which was stable throughout the simulation time in terms of RMSD and RMSF. These findings suggest that the bioactive molecules of Mucuna pruriens compounds have potential therapeutic value in the treatment of pulmonary vascular disease. Further, in vivo and in vitro studies are necessary to determine its efficacy and validate its pharmacological activity conclusively."

      "abstract": "Cerebroside sulfotransferase (CST) is considered a target protein in developing substrate reduction therapy for metachromatic leukodystrophy. This study employed a multistep virtual screening approach for getting a specific and potent inhibitor against CST from 35 phytoconstituents of Bacopa monnieri (L.) Pennell and 31 phytoconstituents of Mucuna pruriens (L.) DC. from the IMPPAT 2.0 database. Using a binding score cutoff of -8.0 kcal/mol with ADME and toxicity screening, four phytoconstituents IMPHY009537 (Stigmastenol), IMPHY004141 (alpha-Amyrenyl acetate), IMPHY014836 (beta-Sitosterol), and IMPHY001534 (jujubogenin) were considered for in-depth analysis. In the binding pocket of CST, the major amino acid residues that decide the orientation and interaction of compounds are Lys85, His84, His141, Phe170, Tyr176, and Phe177. The molecular dynamics simulation with a 100ns time span further validated the stability and rigidity of the docked complexes of the four hits by exploring the structural deviation and compactness, hydrogen bond interaction, solvent accessible surface area, principal component analysis, and free energy landscape analysis. Stigmastenol from Bacopa monnieri with no potential cross targets was found to be the most potent and selective CST inhibitor followed by alpha-Amyrenyl acetate from Mucuna pruriens as the second-best performing inhibitor against CST. Our computational drug screening approach may contribute to the development of oral drugs against metachromatic leukodystrophy.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a severe health problem for which there is no specific treatment, leading to neurological or neuropsychological consequences. One of the most described disorders, even after mild TBI (mTBI), is depression, related to mechanisms involving reactive oxygen species (ROS). The Mucuna pruriens (M. pruriens) plant has various antioxidant, neuroprotective, and anti-inflammatory properties. PURPOSE: There is insufficient evidence of M. pruriens use for the treatment of neurobehavioral and depressive impairments induced by TBI and of the mechanisms underlying this effect, so we aimed to evaluate the ability of shortterm administration of M. pruriens extract to prevent neurobehavioral impairment and depression-like behaviors in a murine model of mTBI as well as evaluate the role of oxidative stress. METHODS: Male Wistar rats underwent mTBI or sham surgery. Immediately after, they were treated with vehicle or M. pruriens extract (50 mg/kg ip/day for five days). We evaluated neurobehavioral recovery using the Neurobehavioral Severity Scale-Revised (NSS-R) and the immobility time in the forced swimming test 3, 7, 15, 30, and 60 days after mTBI. In addition, lipid peroxidation (LP) and GSH concentrations were determined in some brain areas (motor cortex, striatum, midbrain, and nucleus accumbens). RESULTS: M. pruriens extract did not decrease neurobehavioral impairment caused by mTBI. Nevertheless, it prevented depression-like behaviors starting three days after mTBI, reduced LP, and increased GSH in some brain areas. Conclusions: M. pruriens may prevent depression-like behaviors and reduce oxidative stress by decreasing LP and increasing concentrations of antioxidant compounds."

      "abstract": "Usage of soyabean meal (SBM) in broiler diets is economically and environmentally unsustainable thus necessitating investigation of alternative protein sources. Therefore, this study investigated effects of incremental inclusion levels of Mucuna pruriens utilis seed meal (MSM) for partial substitution of SBM in broiler diets. In a completely randomized design (CRD), 400 day-old Ross 308 chicks were allotted to 5 iso-caloric-nitrogenous MSM-containing (0, 5, 10, 15, and 20%) dietary treatments. Each treatment was replicated 8 times, with each pen having 10 birds, during starter (d1 - 14), grower (d15 - 28), and finisher (d29 - 42) phases. Results showed that dietary MSM decreased feed intake (FI: quadratic: P < 0.001), body weight gain (BWG: linear: P < 0.001), and feed conversion efficiency (FCE: linear: P < 0.001) as it linearly decreased slaughter weight (SW: P < 0.001), hot carcass weight (HCW: P < 0.001), cold carcass weight (CCW: P < 0.001), dressing percentage (P < 0.001), and breast weight (P < 0.05). In contrast, dietary MSM linearly increased the weights of the liver (P < 0.01), proventriculus (P < 0.001), gizzard (P < 0.001), duodenum (P = 0.01), jejunum (P < 0.001), ileum (P < 0.001), caecum (P < 0.01), and colon (P < 0.01). Also, dietary MSM quadratically increased blood heterophils (P < 0.05) and alkaline phosphatase activity (P < 0.05) of the chickens whilst linearly increasing their serum amylase (P = 0.001) and lipase (P = 0.001) activities and linearly decreasing their serum symmetric dimethylarginine (SDMA: P = 0.001) and cholesterol (P < 0.05). Further, dietary MSM linearly decreased chicken breast meat ultimate pH (P < 0.05) whilst linearly increasing its cooking loss (P < 0.01), drip loss (P < 0.05) and shear force (P < 0.01). In conclusion, dietary MSM compromised growth performance, carcass characteristics, and meat quality of broilers as it increased the weights of their digestive-metabolic organs.",

      "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second leading neurodegenerative disease after Alzheimer's disease. Mucuna pruriens (L.) DC. (MP) is a plant that contains Levodopa (L-DOPA) and has been known to improve the symptoms of PD. In this preliminary study, we investigated the anti-parkinsonian potential of MP to compare the effects of L-DOPA. We first developed an in vivo model of the PD in C57BL/6 male mice using rotenone. A total of twelve mice were used for this experiment. Nine mice were injected with rotenone (28 mg/kg) daily for 28 days. The mice experiments were performed to validate the effectiveness of MP to treat PD. Synthetic L-DOPA in a ratio of 1:20 with MP was used as MP contains 5% L-DOPA by weight in it. MP and L-DOPA were injected for 19 days on a daily basis. Cognitive function was evaluated using beam balance and olfactory tests. Serum analysis was performed using serum enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) analysis test. IL-12, IL-6, and TGF-β 1 were evaluated to validate the PD inducement and treatment. The levels of IL-12, IL-6, and TGF-β1 (p < 0.0001) in the PD mice group were significantly higher than those in the control group. The PD mice also showed higher latencies in beam balance and olfactory tests (p < 0.0001) compared to the control group. Both MP and L-DOPA-treated groups showed alleviation in latencies in beam balance and olfactory tests and decreased neuroinflammation in ELISA analysis (p < 0.001). The results treated by MP and L-DOPA showed insignificant differences in their values (p > 0.05). This proved that the MP and L-DOPA had similar effects in improving the symptoms of PD when used in the ratio of 1:20. Furthermore, both MP and L-DOPA reduced the level of IL-6 and TGF-β1 in this study. It may be inferred that a reduction in the level of IL-6 and TGF-β1 eventually leads to a reduction in the Th17 cells. The pathogenic Th17 is thought to be present in virtually all chronic inflammatory disorders. This can be an interesting area of research in further understanding the immunological effect of MP in ameliorating PD symptoms."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Photobiomodulation, also referred to as Low-Level Light Therapy (LLLT), has emerged as a promising intervention for pruritus, a prevalent and often distressing symptom. OBJECTIVES: This study investigated the efficacy of low-level light therapy (LLLT) in alleviating pruritus, hyperknesis, and alloknesis induced by histamine and Mucuna pruriens. METHODS: In a double-blind, randomized, sham-controlled trial with a split-body design, healthy volunteers underwent 6 minutes of LLLT and sham treatments in separate upper back quadrants. The histamine model was applied to the upper quadrants, and Mucuna pruriens to the lower quadrants. Pruritus intensity, alloknesis, hyperknesis, flare area, and skin temperature were measured pre and post treatment. RESULTS: Seventeen individuals (eight females, nine males) participated in the study. In the histamine model, LLLT notably reduced itch intensity (difference = 13.9 (95% CI: 10.5 - 17.4), p = 0.001), alloknesis (difference = 0.80 (95% CI: 0.58-1.02), p = 0.001), and hyperknesis (difference = 0.48 (95% CI: 0.09-0.86), p = 0.01). Skin temperature changes were not significantly different between the two groups (difference = -2.0 (95% CI: -6.7-2.6), p = 0.37). For the Mucuna pruriens model, no significant differences were observed in any measures, including itch intensity (difference = 0.8 (95% CI: -2.3 - 3.8), p = 0.61) hyperknesis (difference = 0.08 (95% CI: -0.06-0.33), p = 0.16) and alloknesis (difference = 0. 0.09 (95% CI: -0.08-0.256), p = 0.27). CONCLUSIONS: LLLT effectively reduced histamine-induced pruritus, alloknesis, and hyperknesis; however, LLLT was ineffective against Mucuna pruriens-induced pruritus. Further investigations are required to determine LLLT's effectiveness of LLLT in various pruritus models.",

      "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive and disabling neurodegenerative disease that rapidly worsens and results in premature mortality if left untreated. Although levodopa is the gold standard treatment for PD globally, its accessibility and affordability are severely limited in low- and middle-income countries worldwide. In this scenario, Mucuna pruriens (MP), a leguminous plant growing wild in tropical regions, emerges as a potential alternative or adjunct to levodopa-based medications due to its cost-effectiveness and global natural availability. Recent studies have demonstrated that MP can significantly ameliorate motor symptoms, although tolerability may vary. The proposition that MP could play a pivotal role in providing affordable and symptomatic relief for PD in low- and middle-income countries is grounded in its promising therapeutic profile, yet caution is warranted until more comprehensive data on the long-term safety and efficacy of MP become available. This manuscript summarizes the knowledge gained about MP by the authors, focusing on how to cultivate, store, and provide it to patients in the safest and most effective way in clinical trials. We aim to increase clinical trials investigating its safety and efficacy in PD, before promoting individual use of MP on a global scale, particularly in countries where availability and affordability of levodopa-based medications is still limited.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Previous studies have shown that the velvet bean, an indigenous legume in Indonesia, possesses high protein content and bioactive compounds. However, the utilization of velvet beans in tempe production remains underexplored. METHODS: This study aims to address this research gap by investigating the physicochemical properties and sensory profiles of tempe made from velvet beans, both individually and in combination with soybean. The study involved the production of tempe using germinated and non-germinated velvet bean, soybean, and a soy-velvet bean combination (61:39% ratio). Physicochemical analyses, including hardness, firmness, colour, antioxidant capacity, proximate, pH, and titratable acidity, were conducted. Hedonic rating and Check-All-That-Apply (CATA) tests were also performed to assess the sensory attributes of fresh and fried tempe. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Germination treatment of velvet bean resulted in tempe with reduced hardness, firmness, antioxidant capacity, and pH levels compared to non-germinated velvet bean tempe. However, velvet bean tempe exhibited a darker colour, higher antioxidant capacity, higher pH levels, and lower titratable acidity compared to soybean tempe and soy-velvet bean combination tempe. The protein content in velvet bean tempe was found to be below the required threshold of 15%. Hedonic rating tests revealed that fresh and fried velvet bean tempe received lower scores than other samples. CATA tests identified specific sensory attributes essential for fresh and fried tempe, including beany aroma, white colour, nutty aroma, golden brown colour, solid and crunchy texture, umami taste, and nutty aftertaste. These findings provide valuable insights into the potential applications of velvet beans in tempe production and emphasize the significance of considering germination as a factor affecting the quality and sensory attributes of tempe."

      "abstract": "Objective Mucuna pruriens (MP) is a legume whose seeds contain levodopa (LD), which has potential therapeutic effects against Parkinson's disease (PD). However, further research is needed to thoroughly evaluate its efficacy and safety for treating this condition. In this study, we analyzed the pharmacokinetics of MP grown in Japan and investigated its mechanism of action in PD. Methods MP seeds ground after roasting (containing 4.02% LD per MP powder) were used as the reagent and compared with an equivalent LD/carbidopa (CD) preparation. This clinical trial was conducted using a crossover design among PD patients attending our institution. Each patient received a single dose of 100/10 mg LD/CD tablets and 11 g of MP reagent. Results Among the seven patients with PD, MP prolonged the ON time 2-fold compared to LD/CD. The LD concentrations after MP intake were higher than those after LD/CD intake, whereas dyskinesia did not increase. An analysis of the LD metabolites showed that the 3-O-methyl-dopa/LD metabolic ratio was significantly lower after MP ingestion than after LD/CD ingestion, indicating that MP has a catechol-O-methyl transferase inhibitory effect. Conclusions This is the first report of a pharmacokinetic analysis conducted on actual patients with PD showing that MP significantly prolongs the ON time. The advantages of MP as a treatment for PD have been confirmed: it is inexpensive, as effective as LD, works faster and longer than LD, and does not increase dyskinesia.",

A total of 35 male Wistar rats were randomized into 5 groups (n=7). The animal in group 1 received normal saline (0.2 ml) orally, while groups 2-5 received carbamazepine (CBZ) 25 mg/kg per oral. Groups 1, and 2 were fed with standard rats' chow, while groups 3-5 rats were supplied with a diet containing MP seed powder at 2.25 g, 1.5 g, and 0.75 g respectively. The serum level of male reproductive hormones, estradiol, seminal profiles, and histoarchitecture of the hypothalamus, pituitary, and testis was delineated. Descriptive and inferential statistics were used to analyze the result. There was a marked decrease in the testicular weight, follicle-stimulating hormone, testosterone concentration, and normal sperm cells in the CBZ, and CBZ + MP (2.25 mg/kg) treatment groups.  There was a marked increase in the testicular tissue lipid peroxidation in the CBZ, and CBZ + MP (g) treated rats in addition to various morphological alterations in the hypothalamus, pituitary, and testis. These anomalies were receded in the CBZ + MP (1.5 g), and CBZ + MP (0.75 g) treatment groups. Consumption of MP (1.5 g, and 0.75 g) may alleviate the injurious effects of CBZ treatment on the hypothalamic-pituitary-testicular functions.",

      "abstract": "Mucuna pruriens (MP) is leguminous plant which contains 5% of L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (levodopa) in its seeds. It may have a potential to be used as an alternative therapy for Parkinson's disease (PD). Meanwhile, there is a concern in terms of public health that MP products can be overused by patients with PD. As an entry for patients with PD to acquire MP products in Japan, they are often purchased via internet auctions or free markets. MP products are not reagrded as 'pharmatheutical' by Japanese law as long as the specific legal requirements on advertisements are met, so that the MP products can be advertised or sold without any permission from the authorities. In this study, we aimed to conduct internet survey as to the complianse status of these legal requirements. Several major internet auction or free market websites in Japan were surveyed in May-June 2023 by the authors, and 1157 MP product pages were examined. We found approximately 30-40% of the MP products were suspected to have potential legal risks in terms of their advertisements in their website descriptions, such as claiming pharmatheutical efficacy or describing pharmatheutical-like dosages. In addition, approximately 30-40% of the MP products also did not refer to cautions not to take MP products excessively because of the levodopa ingredients. Current study suggested the need of careful description of the MP products in the auction or free market websites for the MP products exhibitors or sellers, in order to fullfill legal requirements as well as to prevent MP abuse.",

The seeds were cleaned, washed and subjected to single treatments of soaking (24 h, 48 h, 72 h), cooking (20 min, 40 min, 60 min, 80 min), roasting (10 min, 15 min, 20 min), germination (24 h, 48 h, 72 h) and fermentation (24 h, 48 h, 72 h). Combined treatments: soaking (72 h) + cooking (60 min); germination (48 h) + roasting (15 min); germination (48 h) + cooking (60 min); fermentation (72 h) + roasting (15 min) were also separately carried out. Proximate composition and antinutrients were evaluated. Crude protein ranged from 25.34 to 29.50%, ash 3.02-3.82% and crude fibre 0.70-4.69. Crude protein was increased by single and double treatments while ash content was increased by only single treatments. All the treatments reduced the crude fibre. For single and double treatments, phenol, L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine and trypsin inhibitor were in the range of 0.69-3.49%, 0.01-6.83% and 0.00-12.58 TIU/mg protein respectively. This research indicated that the use of up to 72 h soaking, 80 min cooking, 20 min roasting, 72 h germination or 72 h fermentation (Rhizopus oligosporus) is not adequate to reduce phenol and L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine in Mucuna pruriens seed flour to below the recommended safe limits of 0.003% and 0.1% respectively. The double treatment of 72 h fermentation +15 m roasting was the only treatment that reduced L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine to safe limit of 0.01%."

The goal of this study was to determine if daily oral treatment with an extract of Mucuna pruriens, starting after the MPTP-induced loss of nigrostriatal dopamine in male mice, would result in recovery/restoration of motor function, tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) protein expression in the nigrostriatal pathway, or glutamate biomarkers in both the striatum and motor cortex. Following MPTP administration, resulting in an 80 % loss of striatal TH, treatment with Mucuna pruriens failed to rescue either striatal TH or the dopamine transporter back to the control levels, but there was restoration of gait/motor function. There was an MPTP-induced loss of TH-labeled neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta and in the number of striatal dendritic spines, both of which failed to be recovered following treatment with Mucuna pruriens. This Mucuna pruriens-induced locomotor recovery following MPTP was associated with restoration of two striatal glutamate transporter proteins, GLAST (EAAT1) and EAAC1 (EAAT3), and the vesicular glutamate transporter 2 (Vglut2) within the motor cortex. Post-MPTP treatment with Mucuna pruriens, results in locomotor improvement that is associated with recovery of striatal and motor cortex glutamate transporters but is independent of nigrostriatal TH restoration.",

Extracts of MP have also been identified for their antidiabetic, antioxidant, and antineoplastic effects. Commonly, the antioxidant and anticancer properties of a drug are linked together as antioxidants scavenge free radicals and prevent the cellular DNA damage which could result in cancer development. In this investigation, comparative assessment of the anticancer and antioxidant potentials of methanolic seed extracts from two common varieties of MP, Mucuna pruriens var. pruriens (MPP) and Mucuna pruriens var. utilis (MPU) against human colorectal cancer adenocarcinoma cells COLO-205, was carried out. The highest antioxidant potential was recorded with MPP with an IC50 of 45.71 μg/ml. The in vitro antiproliferative effects of MPP and MPU on COLO-205 showed an IC50 of 131.1 μg/ml and 246.9 μg/ml respectively. Our results revealed intervention of the MPP and MPU extracts in growth kinetics of the COLO-205 cells in concomitance with apoptosis induction up to 8.73- and 5.58-folds respectively. The AO/EtBr dual staining and the flow cytometry results also confirmed the better apoptotic efficacy of MPP over MPU. MPP at a concentration of 160 μg/ml exhibited highest apoptosis and cell cycle arrest. Furthermore, effect of the seed extracts on p53 expression was investigated by quantitative RT-PCR and a maximum upregulation of 1.12-fold was recorded with MPP.",

Arsenic poisoning results in the suppression of spermatogenesis and the liver and kidneys are vulnerable to the toxic effects as well. Mucuna pruriens has been identified to have fertility-enhancing and anti-lipid peroxidation properties. Based on these properties of M. pruriens, this study aimed to investigate the efficacy of M. pruriens seed extract in reducing sodium arsenite-induced testicular impairment and hepato-renal histopathology in rats. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study was divided into two groups; short-term (45 days) and long-term (90 days) treatment groups and each group was divided into nine subgroups. Subgroups 1 and 2 served as normal and N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) controls, respectively. Subgroups 3-9 received sodium arsenite in the drinking water (50 mg/L). Subgroup-4 received NAC (210 mg/kg body weight [BW]) orally once daily. Subgroups 5-7 received aqueous seed extract of M. pruriens (350, 530, and 700 mg/kg BW, respectively) orally once daily. Subgroups 8 and 9 received a combination of NAC and aqueous seed extract (350 and 530 mg/kg BW, respectively) orally once daily. Following the treatment, animals were sacrificed and sperm parameters and DNA damage were evaluated. Testis, liver, and kidneys were analyzed for histopathology. RESULTS: Sodium arsenite-induced a significant reduction in sperm parameters and increase in the abnormal architecture of spermatozoa. Histology revealed tissue necrosis. The M. pruriens seed extract ameliorated the damaging effects of sodium arsenite with respect to tissue architecture and sperm parameters when coadministered. CONCLUSION: Mucuna pruriens has beneficial effects against the deleterious effects of sodium arsenite on various tissues. Thus, M. pruriens (530 and 700 mg/kg BW) supplementation would reduce the adverse changes observed with sodium arsenite exposure."

      "abstract": "Levodopa (L-DOPA) is an essential drug for the treatment of Parkinson's disease. Currently, L-DOPA can be produced by chemical synthesis and can also be found naturally in many herbs, especially Mucuna Pruriens (MP). According to clinical research, the MP extract containing L-DOPA for the treatment of Parkinson's disease could reduce side effects more than the synthetic one. Unfortunately, MP extracts can be easily degraded. Changes in physical and chemical properties such as the appearance (color, melt, solid lump) and the reduction of L-DOPA content in the extract were commonly observed. Therefore, it is necessary to develop an extraction procedure to stabilize the extract of L-DOPA. This study attempted to enhance the extraction process by modifying the traditional acidification approach using hydrochloric acid, citric acid, or ascorbic acid. According to the stability test results, using Phyllanthus emblica water (PEW) as a solvent improved the preservative properties more than other solvents. The color of the PEW-MP powder changed slightly after 12 months of accelerated storage, but the amount of L-DOPA remained the highest (73.55%). Moreover, L-DOPA was only detected in MP and PEW-MP, but not PEW alone (the HPTLC chromatogram at Rf 0.48 and the HPLC chromatogram at Rt 6.0 min). The chemical profiles of PEW and L-DOPA observed in the chromatograms indicated that they are independently separated. As a result, they can be applied to a quality control process. Therefore, PEW was proven to be a powerful solvent for L-DOPA herbal extract that could be readily used as a raw material for herbal products.",

In Thai folklore medicine, seeds of Mucuna pruriens (L.) DC. var. pruriens (Thai Mhamui or T-MP) have been used for treating erectile dysfunction. This study aimed to determine l-DOPA levels in T-MP seed extract and investigate its preventive on sexual behaviors and reproductive parameter damages including essential proteins in chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) mice. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE: Mice were divided into 4 groups: (I) control, (II) CUMS, (III) T-MP300 + CUMS, and (IV) T-MP600 + CUMS. Groups I and II received DW while groups III and IV were pretreated with the seed extracts (300 and 600 mg/kg BW) for 14 consecutive days before co-treatment with a randomly different CUMS/day (from 12 mild stressors) for 43 days. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: T-MP seed extract contained l-DOPA approximately 10% of total dried weight. A dose of 600 mg/kg improved sexual performances and degenerative seminiferous epithelium in CUMS mice. Sperm qualities and testosterone level were elevated while corticosterone was decreased in co-treatment groups. T-MP-CUMS cotreated groups also improved expressions of AKAP4, AR, and TyrPho proteins in testis, epididymis, and sperm. T-MP increased StAR and CYP11A1 expressions in testis. It also suppressed testicular apoptosis via decreased expressions of Hsp70, caspases 3, and 9. T-MP seeds containing l-DOPA could improve sexual behaviors and essential reproductive proteins caused by CUMS. SECTION: Natural Products.

Ninety mice were kindled with picrotoxin, strychnine, or pilocarpine hydrochloride at the 30th minute of intraperitoneal injection (i.p) of normal saline (0.2 ml), MP (200, 100, 50 mg/kg), diazepam (7.5 mg/kg), or haloperidol (5 mg/kg). The onset of convulsion and percentage mortality was recorded. The histoarchitectural and immunohistochemical profiles of the brains were determined. Data were expressed as mean ± SEM with a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), while p < 0.05 was considered significant. There was a significant prolongation of the latency to first seizure across the treatment groups following picrotoxin, and pilocarpine-induced convulsion; a decrease in percentage mortality in the MP (50 mg/kg) treatment group, and an increase in the hippocampal nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 count, and Neu-N expression in the MP (200 mg/kg, and 100 mg/kg) treated mice. Treatment with MP seed may abolish seizure occurrence and consequential mortality; mechanisms traceable to its GABAergic expression and hippocampal NRF 2 and Neu N expression.",

      "abstract": "The first line therapy of patients with Parkinson's disease, a neurodegenerative disorder caused by the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons, is levodopa (L-dopa) given orally. Recently, the presence of natural L-dopa in the seed of Mucuna pruriens, a tropical legume in the Fabaceae family, was reported and it showed superior efficiency compared with synthetic L-dopa. Therefore, this study aimed to examine the phytochemical compounds, particularly for natural L-dopa, in M. pruriens seed extract and subsequently prepare a nanogel containing the extract prior to incorporation into a jelly formulation for use as a functional food in elderly patients with Parkinson's disease. The results show that M. pruriens seed extract contains phenolic compounds, flavonoids, tannins, alkaloids, terpenoids, and saponins. The quantitative analysis performed by the HPLC method revealed that spray-dried M. pruriens seed extract contained 5.59 ± 0.21% L-dopa. M. pruriens seed extract possesses a ferric-reducing antioxidant power and shows free-radical scavenging activity, determined by DPPH and ABTS methods, suggesting a distinctive antioxidant ability of the extract. M. pruriens seed extract at 10 ng/mL did not show cytotoxicity against a neuronal cell line (SH-SY5Y cells), kidney cells (HEK293 cells), or Caco-2 cells. Nanogel of M. pruriens seed extract prepared by ionic gelation had the hydrodynamic diameter, polydispersity index and zeta potential value of 384.53 ± 11.24 nm, 0.38 ± 0.05, and -11.23 ± 1.15 mV, respectively. The transepithelial transport of L-dopa in M. pruriens seed-extract nanogel through Caco-2 cells was measured. Nanogel containing M. pruriens seed extract at the concentration of 10 ng/mL exhibited neuroprotective activity. A jelly formulation containing M. pruriens seed-extract nanogel was successfully developed. The prepared jelly exhibited the acceptable physical and microbiological stabilities upon 6 months of the stability test. The half-life of natural L-dopa in jelly were 3.2, 0.9, and 0.6 years for storage conditions at 4, 30, and 40 °C, respectively, indicating the thermal degradation of natural L-dopa. The prepared jelly containing natural L-dopa from M. pruriens seed extract with the prominent antioxidant activity is a promising option for elderly patients suffering from Parkinson's disease."

      "abstract": "L-dopa, a dopaminergic agonist, is the gold standard for the treatment of Parkinson's disease. However, due to the long-term toxicity and adverse effects of using L-dopa as the first-line therapy for Parkinson's disease, a search for alternative medications is an important current challenge. Traditional Ayurvedic medicine has suggested the use of Mucuna pruriens Linn. (Fabaceae) as an anti-Parkinson's agent. The present study aimed to quantify the amount of L-dopa in M. pruriens seed extract by HPLC analysis. The cytotoxicity and neuroprotective properties of M. pruriens aqueous extract were investigated by two in vitro models including the serum deprivation method and co-administration of hydrogen peroxide assay. The results showed the significant neuroprotective activities of M. pruriens seed extracts at a concentration of 10 ng/mL. In addition, the effects of L-dopa and M. pruriens seed extract on in vitro acetylcholinesterase activities were studied. M. pruriens seed extract demonstrated acetylcholinesterase inhibitory activity, while synthetic L-dopa enhanced the activity of the enzyme. It can be concluded that the administration of M. pruriens seed might be effective in protecting the brain against neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases. M. prurience seed extract containing L-dopa has shown less acetylcholinesterase activity stimulation compared with L-dopa, suggesting that the extract might have a superior benefit for use in the treatment of Parkinson's disease.",

      "abstract": "The medicinal plant Mucuna pruriens (Fabaceae) is widely known for its anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory properties. It is a well-established drug in Ayurveda and has been widely used for the treatment of neurological disorders and male infertility for ages. The seeds of the plant have potent medicinal value and its extract has been tested in different models of neurodegenerative diseases, especially Parkinson's disease (PD). Apart from PD, Mucuna pruriens is now being studied in models of other nervous systems disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and stroke because of its neuroprotective importance. This review briefly discusses the pathogenesis of PD, AD, ALS and stroke. It aims to summarize the medicinal importance of Mucuna pruriens in treatment of these diseases, and put forward the potential targets where Mucuna pruriens can act for therapeutic interventions. In this review, the effect of Mucuna pruriens on ameliorating the neurodegeneration evident in PD, AD, ALS and stroke is briefly discussed. The potential targets for neuroprotection by the plant are delineated, which can be studied further to validate the hypothesis regarding the use of Mucuna pruriens for the treatment of these diseases.",

      "abstract": "ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Thai Mucuna pruriens (L.) DC. var. pruriens (T-MP) has been traditionally used in treating depressive disorders, dysuria and enhancing male sexual desire. Although T-MP seed is demonstrated to have antioxidant capacity, its aphrodisiac and protective tissue damage properties have never been documented. Recently, ethanol (Eth) is known to cause sexual behavior dysfunction and damage reproductive system. This study aimed to investigate the protective effects of T-MP seed extract on sexual behavior dysfunction and reproductive damages in male rats admisted with Eth. MATERIALS AND METHODS: T-MP possessing antioxidant activity was determined for L-DOPA content using NMR analysis. Thirty-six male rats were divided into four groups (9 animals/group). Control rats received DW and the ethanol (Eth) group was given with Eth (3 g/kgBW; 40%v/v). In preventive groups (T-MP150 + Eth and MP300 + Eth groups), animals were treated with T-MP extract at a dose of 150 and 300 mg/kgBW before Eth administration for consecutive 56 days. Sexual behaviors including mounting frequency (MF), intromission frequency (IF), mounting latency (ML), intromission latency (IL), ejaculation latency (EL), post-ejaculatory interval (PEI), and ejaculation frequency (EF) were evaluated. Epididymal sperm quality and daily sperm production (DSP) were examined. Testicular histology was observed using Masson's trichrome staining. The malondialdehyde (MDA) levels and expressions of androgen receptor (AR), heat shock protein 70 (HSP70), steroidogenic acute regulatory (StAR), and tyrosine-phosphorylated (TyrPho) proteins in testis were also determined. RESULTS: T-MP extract contained L-DOPA and improved sexual behaviors including increased MF and IF and decreased ML and IL in Eth treated rats. Significantly, sperm quality, DSP, and testicular histopathology observed in Eth group were improved after T-MP treatment. T-MP also decreased the testicular MDA levels. Additionally, T-MP could correct testicular functional proteins of AR and StAR except HSP70 expression in Eth group. Expressions of TyrPho proteins in testicular and sperm lysates were improved in co-administered groups. CONCLUSIONS: T-MP seed extract possessing L-DOPA could enhance the sexual behaviors and protect reproductive damages via improvement of testicular functional proteins.",

About 40 min after ingesting the plant, the patient showed adverse digestive symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, and abundant diarrhea followed by a state of confusion, hallucinations, and amnesia. She was brought to the emergency department. After medical examination, her vitals were normal, and only her nausea lingered. The poison control center was contacted by the medical team. The plant, previously well described and known by the patient, was later picked from the garden and reviewed by the Indian Ocean toxicovigilance department. Expert botanists confirmed the plant species to be M pruriens. The patient ate the raw seeds after reading articles on the Internet, without confirming whether the seeds should have been cooked before consumption. This case highlights that ingesting raw, unprepared M pruriens seeds can cause severe digestive symptoms, possibly accompanied by neurologic disorders.",

The present study therefore investigates the hepatoprotective and nephroprotective potentials of its leaves extract with a view to providing a potent alternative in the management of liver and kidney diseases. METHODOLOGY: Forty male albino rats were randomly placed into eight groups comprising five animals each. Animals in group I were administered with the distilled water, while groups II and VI were exposed to CCl4 and rifampicin respectively. Animals in groups III and IV were initially exposed CCl4 and treated with 50 and 100 mg/kg bw M. pruriens respectively. Similarly, groups VII and VIII animals were exposed to rifampicin and treated with 50 and 100 mg/kg bw M. pruriens respectively. Animals in group V were treated with 100 mg/kg bw silymarin by oral gavage after an initial exposure to CCl4. Selected biomarkers of liver and kidney damage were determined in the serum and organs homogenate. Liver and kidney slices of experimental animals were also stained for histopathological examination. RESULTS: Exposure to CCl4 and rifampicin respectively resulted in marked distortion in lipid profile, inhibition of antioxidant enzymes and a surge in ALT, AST, ALP, urea, uric acid, bilirubin and creatine kinase. Treatment with M. pruriens extract reversed all deranged biochemical and histopathological parameters in a dose-dependent manner. CONCLUSION: Extract of M. pruriens leaves restored deranged biochemical and histopathological parameters in the liver and kidney with similar potency to silymarin. Hence, leaf extract of M. pruriens is a potential hepatoprotective and nephroprotective agent that can be exploited in the management of liver and kidney diseases.",

      "abstract": "Mucuna pruriens (L.) DC var. pruriens is the natural source for L-DOPA, precursor of the neurotransmitter dopamine, used widely in the treatment of Parkinson's disease. However, L-DOPA synthesis in plants is mediated either by Catecholamine (CA) pathway or alternate pathway catalyzed by Cytochrome P450 (CYP450) class of enzymes. Interestingly, the CA pathway itself can be initiated either by tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) or polyphenol oxidase (PPO). The CA pathway mediated synthesis of L-DOPA has not yet been proved in M. pruriens albeit strong indications. Therefore, the present investigation is focused on metabolite analysis of major intermediates of CA pathway up to the formation of dopamine and expression analysis of the selected genes, in different tissues and callus cultures. The four major intermediates, L-tyrosine, tyramine, L-DOPA and dopamine, were detected using NMR spectroscopy and quantified by HPLC in the callus cultures and in different tissues of the field plant, respectively. The various stages of leaf tissue were also analyzed for metabolite profiling. The relative amount of intermediates detected during the ontogeny of leaf indicates that PPO mediated conversion of L-tyrosine to dopamine through L-DOPA is relatively higher compared to dopamine production from tyramine. Among the two possible enzymes, activity of PPO was 6.5-fold more than TH in metabolically active young leaves compared to intermediate leaves. The gene expression profiles comprising upstream genes of L-tyrosine synthesis and downstream up to dopamine synthesis shows strong correlation with L-DOPA synthesis. The study validates CA pathway mediated synthesis of L-DOPA with PPO as candidate enzyme, in M. pruriens.",

Current study expected to determine the biological activities of peptide fractions of Mucuna pruriens against hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines (HepG2/ADM, HepG2, SMMC-7721, and QGY-7703), as well as normal cell line to prove their selectivity. Moreover, anti-genotoxicity and antiviral activity against the hepatitis C virus (HCV) were assessed. The methods of this study were to isolate the peptides of M. pruriens and hydrolysate fractionation via fractionated pepsin-pancreatin hydrolysates by ultrafiltration/high-performance ultrafiltration cell, identify anti-hepatoma activity of peptide fractions human liver cancer and normal cells by (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazole-2-yl)-2,5-biphenyl tetrazolium bromide) (MTT) assay, determine anti-HCV, and assess anti-genotoxic effect of peptide fractions against damage that induced via alkylating agent methyl methanesulphonate in human mononuclear cells. The results showed that the fraction 5-10 kDa has been reported to exhibit significant cytotoxic activity against HepG2 and QGY-7703. It was proven that both of 5-10 and >10 kDa fractions are active against HCV. The cytotoxic concentration (CC50) of 5-10 kDa against the cell line was 703.04 ± 5.21 µg/ml. Anti-genotoxic activities of the peptide fractions were evaluated as mean values for the analyzed comet images. In this regard, the highest activity of protecting DNA damages was observed by the peptide fraction of 5-10 kDa. This study revealed the potential ability of peptide fractions of M. pruriens for the treatment of liver cancer, HCV, and high activities of protecting DNA damages."

A total of 32 adult male Wistar rats were initially randomized into a healthy group (HG, n = 16) which consumed a control diet and an obese group (OG, n = 16) which consumed a cafeteria diet for eight weeks. They were then subdivided into four groups: healthy (HG, n = 8); healthy treated with MP (HGMP, n = 8); obese (OG, n = 8); obese treated with MP (OGMP, n = 8), with consumption of their respective diets continuing for another eight weeks; the treated groups received 750 mg kg-1 of MP extract via gavage. Food consumption and body weight were monitored weekly. Glucose and insulin tolerance tests were performed, and feces were collected for bacterial count and quantification of organic acids. The rats were euthanized, their blood was collected for biochemical analysis, organs and adipose tissue for histological analysis and carcasses for body composition. The obsese rats showed a preference for processed meat, stuffed biscuits, popcorn, hot dog sausages, Bologna and ham. The OGMP exhibited lower caloric intake (17%), body weight (14%), fat mass (44%), triglycerides (68%), insulin (58%), leptin (40%), C-reactive protein (75%) and alpha1-glycoprotein acid (62%) and increased HDL (45%) compared to the OG. Moreover, MP reversed changes in liver and adipose tissues induced by obesity and increased counts of lactic acid bacteria and organic acids in feces. The MP treatment demonstrated an anti-obesity effect with improvement in body composition, biochemical profile, and intestinal health of obese rats.",

      "abstract": "This study evaluated the effect of Mucuna pruriens (MP) administration on neuroinflammation and behavioral and murinometric parameters in obese rats. Proximate composition, oligosaccharide and phenolic compound profile of MP were determined. Wistar adult male rats were randomized into healthy (HG) and obese group (OG). The HG consumed a control chow diet while OG consumed a cafeteria diet for eight weeks. Then, they were subdivided into: Healthy (HG); Healthy with MP administration (HGMP); Obese (OG); Obese with MP administration (OGMP), with the consumption of the respective diets remaining for another eight weeks, in addition to gavage with MP extract to supplemented groups (750 mg/kg weight). MP presented a composition rich in proteins and phenolic compounds, especially catechin, in addition to 1-kestose and levodopa. Supplementation reduced food intake, body weight, and thoracic and abdominal circumferences in obese rats. MP showed anxiolytic and antidepressant effects and reduced morphological damage and expression of interleukin 6 in the hippocampus of obese rats. MP treatment showed satietogenic, slimming, anxiolytic and antidepressant effects, besides to minimizing hippocampal neuroinflammation in obese rats. Our results demonstrated the potential anti-obesity of MP which are probably related to the high content of bioactive compounds present in this plant extract.",

      "abstract": "ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Inflammation caused by activated microglia is known to be associated with neurodegenerative diseases, e.g., Parkinson's disease (PD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Inhibiting the inflammatory process can be considered a potential strategy for the treatment of inflammation-associated diseases. Mucuna pruriens (L.) DC. (Leguminosae) has long been used in Thailand, India, China and other tropical countries to treat several diseases including PD. M. pruriens seeds have been found to possess a variety of pharmacological properties including antioxidant and anti-Parkinsonism effects. However, the anti-inflammatory effects of M. pruriens seeds during microglial activation have yet to be reported. AIM OF THE STUDY: The present study was performed to evaluate the anti-inflammatory effects of M. pruriens seed extract and elucidate its underlying mechanism using lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated BV2 microglial cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: BV2 microglial cells were pretreated with various concentrations of M. pruriens seed extract before being stimulated with LPS. The levels of inflammatory mediators were analyzed by Griess assay and enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA). The protein expression levels of inflammatory cytokines were determined by Western blot analysis. The translocation of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) was assessed by immunofluorescence microscopy. RESULTS: M. pruriens seed extract significantly inhibited the release of inflammatory mediators including nitric oxide (NO), IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α in LPS-stimulated BV2 microglial cells. The extract also decreased the protein expression of IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α. Moreover, M. pruriens seed extract inhibited the translocation of NF-κB. CONCLUSIONS: M. pruriens seed extract could suppress inflammatory responses in LPS-activated BV2 microglial cells by inhibiting the NF-κB signaling pathway. These findings support the use of M. pruriens seeds in traditional and alternative medicine for the treatment of PD and other inflammation-associated diseases.",

Mucuna pruriens has been identified for its medicinal properties. The aim of the study was to investigate the protective effect of aqueous seed extract of M. pruriens on sodium arsenite-induced memory impairment, liver, and kidney functions in rats. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The experiment was divided into short-term treatment (45 days) and long-term treatment (90 days), with each group divided into nine sub-groups consisting of six animals each. Sub-groups 1 and 2 served as normal, and N-acetylcysteine (NAC) controls, respectively. Sub-groups 3-9 received sodium arsenite in drinking water (50 mg/L). In addition, sub-group 4 received NAC (210 mg/kg b.wt) orally once daily, sub-groups 5-7 received aqueous seed extract of M. pruriens (350 mg/kg b.wt, 530 mg/kg b.wt, and 700 mg/kg b.wt) orally once daily and sub-groups 8 and 9 received a combination of NAC and aqueous seed extract of M. pruriens (350 mg/kg b.wt and 530 mg/kg b.wt) orally once daily. Following the treatment, the blood was drawn retro-orbitally to assess the liver (serum alanine transaminase [ALT], serum aspartate transaminase, and serum alkaline phosphatase) and kidney (serum urea and serum creatinine) functions. Learning and memory were assessed by passive avoidance test. Animals were sacrificed by an overdose of ketamine, and their Nissl stained hippocampal sections were analyzed for alterations in neural cell numbers in CA1 and CA3 regions. RESULTS: In the short-term treatment, groups administered with M. pruriens 530 mg/kg b.wt alone and combination of NAC + M. pruriens 350 mg/kg b.wt exhibited a significant improvement in memory retention, less severe neurodegeneration, and decrease in serum ALT levels. In long-term treatment, groups administered with M. pruriens 700 mg/kg b.wt alone and combination of NAC+M. pruriens 350 mg/kg b.wt, respectively, showed better memory retention, decreased neural deficits, and reduced levels of kidney and liver enzymes. CONCLUSION: The seed extract of M. pruriens showed significant enhancement in memory and learning. The number of surviving neurons in the CA1 and CA3 regions also increased on treatment with M. pruriens. Serum ALT, serum urea, and serum creatinine levels showed significant improvement on long-term treatment with M. pruriens."

      "abstract": "Mucuna pruriens L., commonly known as velvetbean or cow-itch, is a self-pollinated tropical legume of the family Fabaceae, known for its medicinal properties. The active principle L-DOPA extracted from the plant is a potent drug used in the treatment of Parkinson's disease. Although, it is hypothesized that a single step reaction can produce L-DOPA, the presence of optional routes makes the pathway more intricate. For instance, the catecholamine biosynthetic pathway, which leads to L-DOPA production, could occur by hydroxylation of tyrosine to L-DOPA either by polyphenol oxidase (PPO) or tyrosine hydroxylase (TH). Furthermore, Cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes can also cause hydroxylation of tyrosine, resulting in L-DOPA synthesis. Therefore, the present investigation was focused on validating the step, which catalyzes the synthesis of L-DOPA, at the biochemical and molecular levels. Enzyme inhibitor studies showed significant inhibition of PPO enzyme with corresponding decrease in L-DOPA synthesis while TH and CYP inhibition had no effect on L-DOPA synthesis. Activity staining of non-denaturing PAGE gel for PPO and TH showed activity only to PPO enzyme. Following in-gel assay and tryptic digestion of the excised stained gel portion, peptide recovery and LC-MS/MS analysis were performed. Degenerate primers based on peptide sequence resulted in an 800bp amplicon. The subsequent sub-cloning, RACE analysis and BLAST search resulted in the isolation of full-length PPO coding sequence of 1800 bp. Structure prediction and phylogenetic analysis of the obtained sequence revealed strong similarity to other plant PPO's like Glycine max, Vigna radiata and Vicia faba of the same family.",

Levodopa remains the gold standard treatment for PD globally, although it is largely unavailable and unaffordable for the majority of patients in many sub-Saharan African and other low-income countries (LICs). We suggest the potential for Mucuna pruriens (MP), a leguminous plant, to replace or supplement levodopa-based medicines in countries where levodopa is unaffordable and inaccessible due to its low costs of preparation and high natural availability. MP has been shown to induce a great improvement of motor symptoms with few adverse events in recent studies. However, caution is important until more robust data on the long-term safety of MP are available. We believe that MP could potentially be part of the answer to affordable, symptomatic treatment of PD in LICs worldwide.",

      "abstract": "Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease induced by abnormal insulin secretions from β-cells in pancreas. The present study aimed to investigate the immunosuppressive effects from protein derivatives of Mucuna pruriens on a murine model of Type 1 diabetes. Hydrolyzate and five peptide fractions with different molecular weight were administered orally by 14 days, followed T1D murine model was built by intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin over 5 days. The mice weight, blood glucose levels, anti-insulin, and anti-pancreatic islet β-cells antibodies, pro-inflammatory cytokines as tumor necrosis factor alpha and interleukin-6 were determined in four times (0, 15, 30, and 45 day). Mice were sacrificed and pancreatic tissues samples were obtained and staining with hematoxylin and eosin to determine the degree of damage. The study demonstrated immunosuppressive activity in four of the six treatment groups: (a) T1D PPH, (b) T1D F 5-10 kDa, (c) T1D F 3-5 kDa, and (d) T1D F 1-3 kDa. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Due to the high content of native protein in seeds of Mucuna pruriens, studies have reported potential in the elaboration of hydrolysates and peptides with biological activity. These protein derivatives could help in the treatment of immunological disorders that are observed in several chronic non-communicable disease and inflammatory diseases, such as T1D. Activated macrophages and lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate plays a crucial role in the initiation and maintenance of T1D; therefore, several studies has focused to reduce the effector functions of this cells for diminishing the clinical manifestations in inmmunocompromised patients. Thus, this study indicates the potential application of hydrolyzate and peptide fractions of M. pruriens in functional foods and dietary supplements could be developed for the treatment of inflammatory and chronic non-communicable diseases.",

Studies have shown the potential use of by-products derived from Mucuna as a functional food because of the hypoglycemic and antihypertensive activities. Thus, this study aims to assess the antioxidant and protective effect of the peptide fractions derived from M. pruriens L., in vitro on the HeLa cell line. An enzymatic hydrolysis with pepsin-pancreatin was performed on the total protein concentrate, from which five peptide fractions were obtained. RESULTS: All protein derivatives from M. pruriens L., except F5-10 kDa, decreased the hydrogen peroxide production by more than 50%. The highest antioxidant activity was exhibited by F1-3 kDa, which lowered the intracellular reactive oxygen species by 207 ± 4.20%. No significant differences were found in the protective effects of the protein hydrolysate, F5-10 kDa, F3-5 kDa and F1-3 kDa relative to the N-acetylcysteine control group. CONCLUSION: This elucidated the potential action mechanisms of M. pruriens L. protein derivatives for future investigations and their role in the prevention and treatment of oxidative stress. © 2019 Society of Chemical Industry.",

Twenty-four 12-week-old rabbit bucks weighing 1002 to 1156 g were randomly allocated to three experimental diets containing 0, 1.5, and 3% of MSM in a 3-month trial. Sexual behavior parameters such as mounting latency, mounting frequency, successful mounting frequency, intromission latency, and post ejaculatory interval were monitored at the end of the experiment by mating with receptive females. Thereafter, rabbits were weighed, stunned, and humanely sacrificed and testes, epididymis, and vas deferens were harvested for evaluation of organ weights and semen characteristics. Results indicate that supplementing rabbit diet with MSM induced a significant decrease (P < 0.05) in mounting latency (69.7%) and intromission latency (19.7%), while it significantly (P < 0.05) increased successful mounting frequency (60%) as well as relative weight of testis (33.3%) and vas deferens (54.5%). There was a dose-dependent increase (P < 0.05) in sperm motility (35.7%) and concentration (65.9%), serum albumin (19.1%) and protein concentration (9.9%), and a decrease in sperm morphological alterations (68.3%), serum cholesterol (13.4%), and urea (11.6%) in treatment groups where MSM was supplemented at 3% compared to controls. From the findings, it appears MSM is a potential enhancer of male reproductive performance that can be recommended to rabbit farmers for improving reproductive performance and quality of semen, hence a boon to reproduction and production in rabbit farming industry.",

Our previous studies on standardized Mucuna pruriens extract (Mpe) have shown usefulness in the Drosophila model of PD. In this communication, we provide new information on the effect of Mpe on basal and serotonin treated contractions in the crop (i.e., an important and essential part of the gut) in Drosophila PD mutant for PTEN-induced putative kinase 1 (PINK1B9) gene. The effect of Mpe on PINK1B9 supplied with standard diet to larvae and/or adults, were assayed on 10-15 days old flies. Conversely from what we observed in the wild type flies, recordings demonstrated that exogenous applications of serotonin on crop muscles of untreated PINK1B9 affect neither the frequency nor the amplitude of the crop contraction, while the same muscle parameters are enhanced following brain injections of serotonin, thus suggesting that PINK1B9 mutants may likely have an impairment in the serotonergic pathways. Also, the mitochondrial morphology in the crop muscles is strongly compromised, as demonstrated by the transmission electron microscopy analysis. The Mpe treatment rescued the crop muscle parameters and also the mitochondrial morphology when supplied to both larvae and adults. Overall, this study strengthens the relevance of using PINK1B9 Dm as a translational model to study the gastrointestinal symptoms in PD and also confirms the useful employment of M. pruriens for PD treatment.",

Male rats (n = 28) were divided into 4 groups as control, M. pruriens, fructose, and M. pruriens plus fructose. All rats were fed a standard diet supplemented or no supplemented with M. pruriens (200 mg/kg/d by gavage). Fructose was given in drinking water for 8 weeks. High fructose consumption led to an increase in the serum level of glucose, triglyceride, urea and renal malondialdehyde (MDA) levels. Although M. pruriens treatment reduced triglyceride and MDA levels, it did not affect other parameters. M. pruriens supplementation significantly decreased the expression of NF-ҡB and decreased expression of Nrf2 and HO-1 proteins in the kidney. This study showed that the adverse effects of high fructose were alleviated by M. pruriens supplementation via modulation of the expression of kidney nuclear transcription factors in rats fed high fructose diet.",

      "abstract": "ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Mucuna pruriens (L.) DC (MP) is an ancient Indian medicinal plant traditionally used to treat Parkinson's disease. L-Dopa (LD), precursor of dopamine is abundantly found in the seeds of MP. L-dopa is a natural inhibitor of prolactin (PRL) hormone which is required to maintain lactation in women but it's over production (hyperprolactinemia) plays critical role in advancement of breast cancer. AIM OF THE STUDY: We aim to examine the pharmacological effect of LD and MP on this hyperprolactinemia associated breast cancer and related signaling for effective management of the disease. We also investigated chemo-sensitizing effect of MP on hyperprolactinemia-mediated cisplatin resistance. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Methanolic seed extract of MP were prepared and analysed using HPLC. Effect of LD and MP on the cellular viability of breast cancer cells (T47D, MCF-7, MDA-MB-468 and MDA-MB-231) were evaluated using MTT assay. Further, effect of LD and MP on colony forming potential, DNA damage, cell cycle distribution and apoptosis was determined using agar/agarose method, comet assay and annexin and PI method followed by FACS analysis. To reveal the molecular mechanism involved in the anti-cancer activity of MP, transcriptional and translational level analysis of the key proteins involved in the PRL-mediated signaling, was performed using RT-PCR and western blot analysis. The effect of MP extract on PRL-mediated signaling was validated using dopaminergic agonist bromocriptine. MP extract and cisplatin was given in different combination with appropriate controls to check their effect on chemo-resistivity of breast cancer cells. RESULTS: Our results demonstrated that MP seed extract has the potential to inhibit cellular proliferation of PRL expressing T47D and MCF-7 breast cancer cells via induction of DNA damage, G1 phase of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis more effectively as compare to LD. Further, MP-mediated anti-cancerous effect was associated with the downregulation of PRL expression, further suppressing the JAK2/STAT5A/Cyclin D1 signaling pathway which has been validated using dopaminergic agonist bromocriptine. Cancer-related hyperprolactinemia confers cisplatin resistance, we observed that MP via PRL inhibition, enhances cisplatin efficacy after their combinatorial treatment in breast cancer cells. CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, our study suggests that MP could be recommended as dietary supplement along with the chemotherapeutic agents against breast cancer.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Thousands of individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD) in low-income countries have limited access to marketed levodopa preparations. Mucuna pruriens (MP), a levodopa-containing leguminous plant growing in tropical areas, may be a sustainable alternative therapy for indigent patients. Single-dose intake of MP proved noninferior to marketed levodopa preparations. METHODS: Fourteen PD patients with motor fluctuations and dyskinesias received MP powder (obtained from roasted seeds) and marketed levodopa/carbidopa (LD/CD) in a randomized order and crossover design over a 16-week period. Efficacy measures were changes in quality of life, motor and non-motor symptoms, and time with good mobility without troublesome dyskinesias. Safety measures included tolerability, frequency of adverse events, changes in laboratory indices and electrocardiogram. RESULTS: Daily intake of MP was associated with a variable clinical response, especially in terms of tolerability. Seven patients (50%) discontinued MP prematurely due to either gastrointestinal side-effects (n = 4) or progressive worsening of motor performance (n = 3), while nobody discontinued during the LD/CD phase. In those who tolerated MP, clinical response to MP was similar to LD/CD on all efficacy outcome measures. Patients who dropped out entered a study extension using MP supernatant water (median[IQR], 16 [7-20] weeks), which was well tolerated. CONCLUSIONS: The overall benefit provided by MP on the clinical outcome was limited by tolerability issues, as one could expect by the relatively rapid switch from LD/CD to levodopa alone in advanced PD. Larger parallel-group studies are needed to identify appropriate MP formulation (e.g. supernatant water), titration scheme and maintenance dose to minimize side-effects in the long-term.

      "abstract": "Till date, drugs that have been used to manage Parkinson's disease (PD) have only shown symptomatic relief with several adverse effects besides their inability to prevent neurodegeneration. Neuroinflammation plays an important role in the advancement of PD and can be targeted for its effective treatment. Researchers have suggested that herbal plants exhibiting the anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant properties are therefore beneficial to human health. Conventionally, Mucuna pruriens (Mp) seeds are used for maintaining male virility in India. Reportedly, Mp is used as a rejuvenator drug having neuroprotective property. Our study aimed to investigate effects of aqueous extract of Mp (100 mg/kgbwt) on neuroinflammation, orally administered to mice intoxicated with 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) as well as the molecular mechanism involved in the progression of PD. In this study, we have observed significant behavioral abnormalities beside decreased antioxidant defense in MPTP intoxicated mice. We have also observed significant increase in inflammatory parameters like Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein, Inducible Nitric Oxide Synthase, Intercellular Cell Adhesion Molecule, and Tumor Necrosis Factor alpha in substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) of parkinsonian mice, while Mp treatment has notably reduced these inflammatory parameters. Mp also inhibited the MPTP induced activation of NF-κB and promoted pAkt1 activity which further prevented the apoptosis of the dopaminergic neurons. Moreover, Mp exhibited significant antioxidant defense by inhibiting the lipid peroxidation and nitrite level, and by improving catalase activity and enhancing GSH level in nigrostriatal region of mouse brain. Mp also recovered the behavioral abnormalities in MPTP treated mice. Additionally, Mp treatment considerably increased the immunoreactivity of Tyrosine Hydroxylase and Dopamine Transporter in SNpc of parkinsonian mice. Our high performance liquid chromatography analysis of the Mp seed extract have shown L-DOPA, gallic acid, phytic acid, quercetin, and catechin equivalents as the major components which might cause neuroprotection in PD mice. Our result suggested that Mp extract treatment containing L-DOPA and a mixture of rich novel phytochemicals significantly alleviates the MPTP induced neurotoxicity by NF-κB and pAkt pathway. The findings observed thereby indicate that Mp extract have suggestively ameliorated MPTP induced neuroinflammation, restored the biochemical and behavioral abnormalities in PD mouse and thus provided a scientific basis for its traditional claim."

The wild genotype of M. pruriens have the largest trichome length (2015 ± 29 μm) compared to other genotype and mutants. The white-seeded variety of M. pruriens was found to be the most suitable for large-scale cultivation due to the small trichome size and less trichome density on the pod. The external surface trichomes have protuberance with unknown function. The unicellular trichomes of Mucuna show the flowing fluid or cytoplasm inside the trichome. The unigenes regulating the differentiation and development of the trichome such as GLABRA-1, GLABRA-2, and cpr-5 have been identified in M. pruriens transcriptome of the leaf. The Mucunain shows a higher transcript abundance in the flower and pod cover compared to the seeds. The Mucunain was found in every stage of plant growth, but it was highly expressed during maturity (about 170 days) with a high fragment per kilobase per million value.",

      "abstract": "Stroke is considered to be one of the most important causes of death worldwide. Global ischemia causes widespread brain injury and infarctions in various regions of the brain. Oxidative stress can be considered an important factor in the development of tissue damage, which is caused because of arterial occlusion with subsequent reperfusion. Kapikacchu or Mucuna pruriens, commonly known as velvet bean, is well known for its aphrodisiac activities. It is also used in the treatment of snakebites, depressive neurosis, and Parkinson's disease. Although this plant has different pharmacological actions, its neuroprotective activity has received minimal attention. Thus, this study was carried out with the aim of evaluating the neuroprotective action of M. pruriens in bilateral carotid artery occlusion-induced global cerebral ischemia in Wistar rats. The carotid arteries of both sides were occluded for 30 min and reperfused to induce global cerebral ischemia. The methanolic plant extract was administered to the study animals for 10 days. The brains of the Wistar rats were isolated by decapitation and observed for histopathological and biochemical changes. Cerebral ischemia resulted in significant neurological damage in the brains of the rats that were not treated by M. pruriens. The group subjected to treatment by the M. pruriens extract showed significant protection against brain damage compared with the negative control group, which indicates the therapeutic potential of this plant in ischemia.",

METHODS: We investigated efficacy and safety of single-dose intake of MP powder from roasted seeds obtained without any pharmacologic processing. Eighteen patients with advanced PD received the following treatments, whose sequence was randomized: (1) dispersible levodopa at 3.5 mg/kg combined with the dopa-decarboxylase inhibitor benserazide (LD+DDCI; the reference treatment); (2) high-dose MP (MP-Hd; 17.5 mg/kg); (3) low-dose MP (MP-Ld; 12.5 mg/kg); (4) pharmaceutical preparation of LD without DDCI (LD-DDCI; 17.5 mg/kg); (5) MP plus benserazide (MP+DDCI; 3.5 mg/kg); (6) placebo. Efficacy outcomes were the change in motor response at 90 and 180 minutes and the duration of on state. Safety measures included any adverse event (AE), changes in blood pressure and heart rate, and the severity of dyskinesias. RESULTS: When compared to LD+DDCI, MP-Ld showed similar motor response with fewer dyskinesias and AEs, while MP-Hd induced greater motor improvement at 90 and 180 minutes, longer ON duration, and fewer dyskinesias. MP-Hd induced less AEs than LD+DDCI and LD-DDCI. No differences in cardiovascular response were recorded. CONCLUSION: Single-dose MP intake met all noninferiority efficacy and safety outcome measures in comparison to dispersible levodopa/benserazide. Clinical effects of high-dose MP were similar to levodopa alone at the same dose, with a more favorable tolerability profile. CLINICALTRIALSGOV IDENTIFIER: NCT02680977.",

METHODS: Seed of M. pruriens plant that cultivated in Mae Taeng District, Chiang Mai Province, Thailand, was collected. Component of its seeds were extracted and isolated into 2 fractions using methanol, polar and nonpolar. Each fraction was investigated for phytochemicals using gas chromatography and mass spectroscopy and was screened for biological activity in vitro using three different cell lines. The most biological active fraction was used to treat both streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetes mellitus-erectile dysfunction (DM-ED) male Wistar rats and normal rats (n = 6 per groups) to compare the effect on sexual behavior parameters, including number of intromission, mounting and ejaculation, with that of rats given Sildenafil by individually pairing with their female counterparts. Penile tissues and serums were collected to determine histological structure, related gene expression and biomolecules. RESULTS: The phytochemicals of the polar fraction were possibly catechol and its derivatives plus polyphenols, whereas the nonpolar fraction consisted of lipid derivatives. l-DOPA was not detected in either of the extracts. The polar fraction was able to up-regulate the expression of ED-related genes including eNOS and nNOS in vitro which subsequently promotes nitric oxide production and maintains intracellular cyclic guanosine monophosphate levels. When administrated to DM-ED rats, the polar extract significantly improved all sexual behavior parameters in DM-ED rats compared to untreated group (18.3 ± 1.8 to 10.8 ± 2.9 for intromission, 9.8 ± 2.2 to 5.7 ± 1.3 for mounting, and 1.8 ± 0.6 to 0.2 ± 0.4 for ejaculation). That effect might due to the ability of the extract to stimulate the expression of eNOS and nNOS which results in nitric oxide production and subsequently maintains cyclic guanosine monophosphate levels in penile tissue. Moreover, this extract may also prevent penile tissue deterioration due to diabetes. CONCLUSIONS: The polar extract of M. pruriens seed can be used for ED therapy, especially in patients with metabolic diseases including diabetes. The action of the extract might be due to catechol and its derivatives and polyphenols."

Twenty four Swiss albino mice were divided into three groups; Control, PQ and PQ+Mp. PQ doses were given intraperitoneally, twice in a week and oral dose of ethanolic extract of Mp seed was given for 9 weeks. Nitrite content and lipid peroxidation was measured in all treated groups along with respective controls. RNA was isolated from the nigrostriatal tissue of control and the treated mice and was reverse transcribed into cDNA. PCR was performed to amplify iNOS mRNA and western blot analysis was performed to check its protein level. We had also perfused the mice in all treated group and performed Tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and iNOS immunoreactivity in substantia nigra region of mice brain. PQ-treatment increased nitrite content, expression of iNOS and lipid peroxidation compared to respective controls. Mp treatment resulted in a significant attenuation of iNOS expression, nitrite content and lipid peroxidation demonstrating that it reduces nitric oxide in PQ-induced Parkinson's disease. Interestingly; we also observed that mRNA, protein expression and immunoreactivity of iNOS was significantly decreased after Mp treatment and TH immunoreactivity was significantly improved after the treatment of Mp. Our results demonstrated that Mp protects the dopaminergic neurons from the NO injury in substantia nigra.",

Hence, the present study was conducted to evaluate wound healing activities of sequential different extracts of Aegle marmelos leaves (AM) and Mucuna pruriens seeds (MP) by in vivo experimental models. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Wistar albino rats were subjected to excision, incision and dead space wounds measuring approximately 250 mm2, 3 cm and implanting sterilized polyvinyl chloride tube on the back of each rat near either side of the vertebral column respectively. The experimental animals were randomized into eight groups (n = 6), control, standard and treatment groups. Hydrogel of different extracts were applied topically once daily. The parameters observed were percentage of wound contraction, epithelization period, tensile strength, hydroxyproline content of the granulation tissue, and histological changes during wound healing. RESULTS: The statistical study revealed that in excision, incision, and dead space wound models all formulations have significant (P < 0.01) wound healing potential. However, methanolic extract formulation was found to be superior to all other treatments as evidenced by rapid wound contraction, lesser number of days required for complete epithelization, increased tensile strength and significant increase in hydroxyproline content. CONCLUSIONS: As compared to the reference standard treated group the wound healing process of the experimental groups was decelerated. All extracts obtained from AM and MP facilitated the wound healing process in all experimental models.",

Treatment of PD has been shifted recently towards herbal medicines.Bacopa monnieri (L.) Wettst. (BM) and Mucuna pruriens (L.) DC (MP) are traditional herbal plants known to have neuroprotective effects due to the presence of bacosides in whole plant extract of Bacopa monnieri (BME) and L-DOPA in MP seed extract (MPE). In this study, the comparative effect of BME and MPE in Parkinsonian mice induced by chronic exposure to 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) was evaluated. Twenty four Swiss albino mice (35-45 g) were grouped into Control, MPTP, MPTP+BME and MPTP+MPE (6 mice in each). Experimental mice were given 40 mg/kg body wt. BME, 48 mg/kg body wt. MPE treatment was given orally for one month with prior use of 15 mg/kg body wt. of MPTP for 2 wk. After the treatment period, behavioral study was performed and assessment of neuroprotective effect was done via neurochemical analysis, Immunohistochemical parameters studied included functional viability of dopaminergic neurons in substantia nigra by Tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) using monoclonal antibody against TH and apoptotic study through caspase-3 and m-RNA expression of neurogenic gene in substantia nigra region of brain. Treatment with BME or MPE for one month significantly decreased the elevated levels of oxidative stress found in Parkinsonian mice. In behavioral tests, comparative analysis of BME and MPE showed a significant increase in spontaneous locomotor activity and grip strength test. Moreover, it was found that the use of BME considerably improved the tyrosine hydroxylase activity, caspase-3 and expression of neurogenic gene in the substantia nigra region of the brain. The results suggest that BME may provide a better platform for future drug discoveries and novel treatment strategies for PD as compared to MPE.",

Most PD patients in low-income areas cannot afford long-term daily Levodopa therapy. The aim of our study was to investigate if Mucuna pruriens (MP), a legume with high LD content that grows in tropical regions worldwide, might be potential alternative for poor PD patients. METHODS: We analyzed 25 samples of MP from Africa, Latin America and Asia. We measured the content in LD in various MP preparations (dried, roasted, boiled). LD pharmacokinetics and motor response were recorded in four PD patients, comparing MP vs. LD+Dopa-Decarboxylase Inhibitor (DDCI) formulations. RESULTS: Median LD concentration in dried MP seeds was 5.29%; similar results were obtained in roasted powder samples (5.3%), while boiling reduced LD content up to 70%. Compared to LD+DDCI, MP extract at similar LD dose provided less clinical benefit, with a 3.5-fold lower median AUC. CONCLUSION: Considering the lack of a DDCI, MP therapy may provide clinical benefit only when content of LD is at least 3.5-fold the standard LD+DDCI. If long-term MP proves to be safe and effective in controlled clinical trials, it may be a sustainable alternative therapy for PD in low-income countries.",

The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of another legume, soybeans, on the pharmacokinetics and metabolism of levodopa. Seven parkinsonian patients with the wearing-off phenomenon and dyskinesia and five healthy volunteers participated in this study. We conducted a crossover study of the clinical effects on the participants before and after taking either levodopa (100mg)/carbidopa (10mg) only (LD/CD) or levodopa/carbidopa with 11 g of ground soybeans (LD/CD/soy). Parkinsonism and dyskinesia before and after ingestion of these substances were evaluated using UPDRS part III, the modified Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (mAIMS) and a self-rating scale. The concentrations of plasma levodopa and its major metabolites were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography. Clinical assessment and blood sampling were conducted before and three hours after the ingestion of ground soybeans. When the patients took LD/CD/soy, they had a significantly longer on-period (p=0.028) and a lower mAIMS score (p<0.001). From the comparison of the results of pharmacokinetic study before and after taking LD/CD or LD/CD/soy, the estimated marginal mean (EMM) of HVA after LD/CD/soy increased in the PD group. EMMs of 3-OMD after LD/CD/soy significantly decreased both in PD patients and healthy controls. These results indicate that soy partly increased the bioavailability of levodopa and suppressed levodopa degradation through COMT. Soybeans may have favorable effects on the motor complications occurring under current levodopa therapy. Further investigation to clarify the mechanism underlying such effects is required.",

M. pruriens varieties are protein rich supplements, and are used as food and fodder worldwide. Here, we report L-dopa contents in seeds of fifty six accessions of four M. pruriens varieties, M. pruriens var. pruriens, M. pruriens var. hirsuta, M. pruriens var. utilis and M. pruriens var. thekkadiensis, quantified by HPTLC-densitometry. L-dopa contents varied between 0.58 to 6.42 (%, dr. wt.). High and low L-dopa yielding genotypes/chemotypes of M. pruriens could be multiplied for medicinal and nutritional purposes, respectively. HPTLC profiles of M. pruriens seeds on repeated extraction (24 h) in 1:1 formic acid-alcohol followed by development in butanol:acetic acid:water (4:1:1, v/v) showed consistent degradation of L-dopa (Rf 0.34 ± 0.02) into a second peak (Rf 0.41 ± 0.02). An average of 52.11% degradation of L-dopa was found in seeds of M. pruriens varieties. Since M. pruriens seeds and/or L-dopa are used for treatment of Parkinson's disease and as an aphrodisiac both in modern and/or traditional systems of medicine, the finding of high level of L-dopa degradation (in pure form and in M. pruriens extracts) into damaging quinones and ROS is very significant.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The effects of antidepressant treatments have traditionally been discussed primarily in terms of effects on noradrenergic and serotonergic systems. Multiple lines of investigation have also explored the role of dopaminergic systems in mental depression. Seed of Mucuna pruriens Linn. (DC) (Leguminoseae) is well-known with dopaminergic action and has several therapeutic applications in folk medicine in curing or managing a wide range of diseases including Parkinsonism. AIM: To elucidate the anti-depressent profile and possible dopaminergic modulating action of M. pruriens seeds in various experimental models of depression. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In the present study, antidepressant effect of the hydroalcoholic extract of the M. pruriens seeds (MPE) (100 and 200 mg/kg, p.o.) was investigated in the Forced Swimming Test (FST), Tail Suspension Test (TST), and Chronic Unpredictable Mild Stress (CUMS) test in mice. Further, dopaminergic interaction of same doses of MPE in the FST and TST were checked by the administration of a haloperidol (0.1 mg/kg, i.p.) and bromocriptine (2 mg/kg, i.p.) on the 7(th) day of MPE treatment. Effect of MPE on locomotor activity was also checked using actophotometer. RESULTS: MPE produced a significant reduction of the immobility time in the FST and TST. Further, antidepressant action of MPE was significantly inhibited by haloperidol and potentiated by bromocriptine in the FST and TST. 21 days of MPE treatment produced protection in CUMS as indicated by a significant increase of sucrose intake of stressed mice. Locomotor activities of mice were not significantly changed after 1 h and 7(th) day of the MPE treatment. CONCLUSION: The results of this study indicate that hydroalcoholic extract of MPE have antidepressant action, which may be mediated by an interaction with the dopaminergic system."

Using PINK1B9 mutant Dm we sought to explore the effects of Mucuna pruriens methanolic extract (Mpe), a L-Dopa-containing herbal remedy of PD. The effects of Mpe on PINK1B9 mutants, supplied with standard diet to larvae and adults, were assayed on 3-6 (I), 10-15 (II) and 20-25 (III) days old flies. Mpe 0.1% significantly extended lifespan of PINK1B9 and fully rescued olfactory response to 1-hexanol and improved climbing behavior of PINK1B9 of all ages; in contrast, L-Dopa (0.01%, percentage at which it is present in Mpe 0.1%) ameliorated climbing of only PINK1B9 flies of age step II. Transmission electron microscopy analysis of antennal lobes and thoracic ganglia of PINK1B9 revealed that Mpe restored to wild type (WT) levels both T-bars and damaged mitochondria. Western blot analysis of whole brain showed that Mpe, but not L-Dopa on its own, restored bruchpilot (BRP) and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) expression to age-matched WT control levels. These results highlight multiple sites of action of Mpe, suggesting that its effects cannot only depend upon its L-Dopa content and support the clinical observation of Mpe as an effective medication with intrinsic ability of delaying the onset of chronic L-Dopa-induced long-term motor complications. Overall, this study strengthens the relevance of using PINK1B9 Dm as a translational model to study the properties of Mucuna pruriens for PD treatment.",

This study investigated the hepatoprotective and in vivo antioxidant activities of the hydroethanolic extract of Mucuna pruriens leaves in antitubercular and alcohol-induced hepatotoxicity assays in rats. METHOD: In each of the models used, seven groups were allotted. The different groups received normal saline (10 mL·kg(-1), p.o.); hepatotoxicant (isoniazid-rifampicin, INH-RIF, 100 mg·kg(-1), i.p. or 20% ethanol 5 g·kg(-1), p.o.) and normal saline (10 mL·kg(-1), p.o.); hepatotoxicant and extract at doses of 100, 200, and 400 mg·kg(-1) p.o.; hepatotoxicant and silymarin 50 mg·kg(-1) p.o.; and extract at 400 mg·kg(-1) p.o. On the 21(st) day of treatment, blood was collected for assessment of serum biochemical parameters and harvested liver samples were assessed for antioxidants. RESULTS: The hepatotoxicants significantly (P < 0.05-0.001) increased the levels of alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), bilirubin, and malondialdehyde (MDA); and reduced the levels of catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and reduced glutathione GSH compared to control. M. pruriens significantly reversed (P < 0.05-0.001) the elevation in the level of ALT, AST, ALP, and bilirubin caused by the hepatotoxicants. The extract (200 and 400 mg·kg(-1)) significantly reversed (P < 0.05) the diminution in the level of in vivo antioxidants and increased the level of MDA produced by INH-RIF. M. pruriens (100-400 mg·kg(-1)) elicited significant reduction (P < 0.001) in the level of MDA compared to the alcohol group. Silymarin also reversed the deleterious effects of the hepatotoxicants. CONCLUSION: The hydroethanolic extract of Mucuna pruriens leaves possesses hepatoprotective activity with enhancement of in vivo antioxidants as a possible mechanism of action.",

      "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative disease found in the aging population. Currently, many studies are being conducted to find a suitable and effective cure for PD, with an emphasis on the use of herbal plants. In Ayurveda, Mucuna pruriens (Mp), a leguminous plant, is used as an anti-inflammatory drug. In this study, the neuroprotective effect of an ethanolic extract of Mp seed is evaluated in the 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) model of PD and compared to estrogen, a well reported neuroprotective agent used for treating PD. Twenty-four Swiss albino mice were randomly divided into four groups: Control, MPTP, MPTP+Mp and MPTP+estrogen. The behavioural recovery in both Mp and estrogen treated mice was investigated using the rotarod, foot printing and hanging tests. The recovery of dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra (SN) region was estimated by tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), immunostaining. Additionally inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) immunoreactivity was evaluated to assess the level of oxidative damage and glial activation respectively. The levels of dopamine and its metabolite in the nigrostriatal region were measured by HPLC. Mp treatment restored all the deficits induced by MPTP more effectively than estrogen. Mp treatment recovered the number of TH-positive cells in both the SN region and the striatum while reducing the expression of iNOS and GFAP in the SN. Treatment with Mp significantly increased the levels of dopamine, DOPAC and homovanillic acid compared to MPTP intoxicated mice. Notably, the effect of Mp was greater than that elicited by estrogen. Mp down regulates NO production, neuroinflammation and microglial activation and all of these actions contribute to Mp's neuroprotective activity. These results suggest that Mp can be an effective treatment for neurodegenerative diseases, especially PD by decreasing oxidative stress and possibly by implementing neuronal and glial cell crosstalk.",

      "abstract": "ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Mucuna pruriens (Mp) is a plant belonging to the Fabaceae family, with several medicinal properties among which its potential to treat diseases where reactive oxygen species (ROS) play an important role in the pathogeneses. The aim was to investigate the effects of Mp leaf methanolic extract (MPME) on human keratinocytes protein expression and its role in preventing proteins oxidation after oxidative stress (OS) exposure. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The effects of MPME on HaCaT cells protein expression were evaluated treating cells with different concentrations of MPME, with glucose oxidase (GO, source of OS) and with MPME subsequently treated with GO. The protein patterns of treated HaCaT cells are analyzed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) and compared with that of untreated HaCaT. Immunoblotting was then used to evaluate the role of MPME in preventing the 4-hydroxynonenal protein adducts (4-HNE PAs) formation (marker of OS). RESULTS: Eighteen proteins, identified by mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-CID-MS/MS), were modulated distinctly by MPME in HaCaT. Overall, MPME counteract GO effect, reducing the GO-induced overexpression of several proteins involved in stress response (T-complex protein 1, Protein disulfide-isomerase A3, Protein DJ-1, and Stress-induced-phosphoprotein 1), in cell energy methabolism (Inorganic pyrophosphatase, Triosephosphate isomerase isoform 1, 2-phosphopyruvate-hydratase alpha-enolase, and Fructose-bisphosphate aldolase A isoform 1), in cytoskeletal organization (Cytokeratins 18, 9, 2, Cofilin-1, Annexin A2 and F-actin-capping protein subunit beta isoform 1) and in cell cycle progression (Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5A-1 isoform B). In addition, MPME decreased the 4-HNE PAs levels, in particular on 2-phosphopyruvate-hydratase alpha-enolase and Cytokeratin 9. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings show that MPME might be helpful in the treatment of OS-related skin diseases by preventing protein post-translational modifications (4-HNE PAs).",

Mucuna pruriens (L.), is a traditional herbal medicine, used in India since 1500 B.C., as a neuroprotective agent. In this present study, we evaluated the therapeutic effects of aqueous extract of M. pruriens (Mp) seed in Parkinsonian mouse model developed by chronic exposure to paraquat (PQ). Results of our study revealed that the nigrostriatal portion of Parkinsonian mouse brain showed significantly increased levels of nitrite, malondialdehyde (MDA) and reduced levels of catalase compared to the control. In the Parkinsonian mice hanging time was decreased, whereas narrow beam walk time and foot printing errors were increased. Treatment with aqueous seed extract of Mp significantly increased the catalase activity and decreased the MDA and nitrite level, compared to untreated Parkinsonian mouse brain. Mp treatment also improved the behavioral abnormalities. It increased hanging time, whereas it decreased narrow beam walk time and foot printing error compared to untreated Parkinsonian mouse brain. Furthermore, we observed a significant reduction in tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) immunoreactivity in the substantia nigra (SN) and striatum region of the brain, after treatment with PQ which was considerably restored by the use of Mp seed extract. Our result suggested that Mp seed extract treatment significantly reduced the PQ induced neurotoxicity as evident by decrease in oxidative damage, physiological abnormalities and immunohistochemical changes in the Parkinsonian mouse.",

      "abstract": "Mucuna is the source of L-Dopa (L 3,4 dihydroxyphenylalanine), a precursor of a dopamine used to treat Parkinson's disease. Leaf blight symptoms were observed on Mucuna pruriens plants in October to November 2010 in a field at the Indian Council of Agricultural Research Complex for the Northeastern Hill Region, Umiam, Meghalaya, India. Symptoms included black necrotic areas on leaves, collapsed leaf tissue and, occasionally, fungal growth visible on the leaf. In advanced infections, dead leaves were attached to the stem, followed by defoliation with only infected pods still attached. Approximately 10% of plants were infected in ~0.5 ha surveyed. Symptomatic leaf pieces were washed with sterile water, surface-sterilized using 4% NaOCl for 30 s, washed again, blotted dry, and plated on PDA amended with streptomycin (100 ppm). Characteristics of three fungal isolates were typical of Rhizoctonia solani J.G. Kühn [teleomorph = Thanatephorus cucumeris (A. B. Frank) Donk], i.e., hyphal branching at 90° angles, basal constriction at the hyphal branching point with a septum close to the lateral hyphum (3), and presence of multinucleate hyphal cells confirmed using DAPI (2-(4-amidinophenyl)-1H-indole-6-carboxamidine) staining (1). A culture was deposited at the Agharkar Research Institute, Pune, India (NFCCI No. 2602). The ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 region of nuclear rDNA of one isolate was sequenced after amplification with primers ITS1 and ITS4 (4), (GenBank Accession No. JQ675536). A BLAST search revealed 99% similarity of the sequence with that of 2 R. solani AG 1-IB isolates (AB122137 and AB000039). Sequences were aligned using MAFT Version 6. Maximum parsimony analysis using MEGA 5 placed the test isolate in AG 1-IB with 99% bootstrap support. PCR assays with primers for R. solani AG 1-IB produced a DNA band of ~300 bp (2). Koch's postulates were completed by inoculating 5-mm colonized plugs of PDA at the soil line of each of 5 potted, 40-day-old plants of M. pruriens, and covering the base of each plant with moistened cheesecloth. In addition, 3 plants were inoculated with colonized plugs at the junction of the lamina and petiole of 9 leaves/plant, spraying the plants with sterilized water, and covering the plants with polythene for 3 days. In addition, 10 detached leaves were inoculated with colonized PDA plugs and incubated in a moist chamber. Three non-inoculated plants served as a control treatment for the first 2 methods, and 10 leaves as a control treatment for the third method with sterilized PDA plugs. Symptoms of leaf blight (necrosis from base to leaf tip, with abundant fungal growth) developed in 6 to 7 days on plants inoculated at the soil line, 4 days on leaves inoculated at the junction of the lamina and petiole, and 2 to 3 days on detached leaves. Control plants and leaves remained asymptomatic for all 3 methods. R. solani was reisolated from inoculated plants as described above, and confirmed to be AG 1-IB. The fungus was not reisolated from control plants or leaves. To our knowledge, this is the first record of R. solani AG 1-IB causing leaf blight on M. pruriens in India. References: (1) M. M.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The Ayurvedic medicinal system claims Mucuna pruriens (MP) to possess pro-male fertility, aphrodisiac and adaptogenic properties. Some scientific evidence also supports its pro-male fertility properties; however, the mechanism of its action is not yet clear. The present study aimed at demonstrating spermatogenic restorative efficacy of MP and its major constituent L-DOPA (LD), and finding the possible mechanism of action thereof in a rat model. METHODOLOGY/FINDINGS: Ethinyl estradiol (EE) was administered at a rate of 3 mg/kg body weight (BW)/day for a period of 14 days to generate a rat model with compromised spermatogenesis. MP and LD were administered in two separate groups of these animals starting 15(th) day for a period of 56 days, and the results were compared with an auto-recovery (AR) group. Sperm count and motility, testis histo-architecture, level of reactive oxygen species (ROS), mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), apoptosis, peripheral hormone levels and testicular germ cell populations were analysed, in all experimental groups. We observed efficient and quick recovery of spermatogenesis in MP and LD groups in comparison to the auto-recovery group. The treatment regulated ROS level, apoptosis, and mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), recovered the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis and the number of testicular germ cells, ultimately leading to increased sperm count and motility. CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: M. pruriens efficiently recovers the spermatogenic loss induced due to EE administration. The recovery is mediated by reduction in ROS level, restoration of MMP, regulation of apoptosis and eventual increase in the number of germ cells and regulation of apoptosis. The present study simplified the complexity of mechanism involved and provided meaningful insights into MP/LD mediated correction of spermatogenic impairment caused by estrogens exposure. This is the first study demonstrating that L-DOPA largely accounts for pro-spermatogenic properties of M. pruriens. The manuscript bears CDRI communication number 8374.",

Mucuna pruriens endocarp powder (MPEP) contains several compounds including natural LD and has been reported to not cause drug-induced dyskinesias. We evaluated the effects of Mucuna pruriens to determine if its underlying mechanistic actions are exclusively due to LD. We first compared MPEP with and without carbidopa (CD), and LD+CD in hemiparkinsonian (HP) monkeys. Each treatment ameliorated parkinsonism. We then compared the neuronal firing properties of the substantia nigra reticulata (SNR) and subthalamic nucleus (STN) in HP monkeys with MPEP+CD and LD+CD to evaluate basal ganglia circuitry alterations. Both treatments decreased SNR firing rate compared to HP state. However, LD+CD treatments significantly increased SNR bursting firing patterns that were not seen with MPEP+CD treatments. No significant changes were seen in STN firing properties. We then evaluated the effects of a water extract of MPEP. Oral MPWE ameliorated parkinsonism without causing drug-induced dyskinesias. The distinctive neurophysiological findings in the basal ganglia and the ability to ameliorate parkinsonism without causing dyskinesias strongly suggest that Mucuna pruriens acts through a novel mechanism that is different from that of LD."

L-DOPA extracted from seeds of Mucuna is a constituent of more than 200 indigenous drug formulations and is more effective as drug than the synthetic counterpart. A densitometric high performance thin-layer chromatographic (HPTLC) method was developed for quantification of L-DOPA content present in the seeds extract. The method involves separation of L-DOPA on precoated silica gel 60 GF(254) HPTLC plates using a solvent system of n-butanol-acetic-acid-water (4:1:1, v/v) as the mobile phase. Quantification was done at 280 nm using absorbance reflectance mode. Linearity was found in the concentration range of 100 to 1000 ng/spot with the correlation coefficient value of 0.9980. The method was validated for accuracy, precision and repeatability. Mean recovery was 100.89%. The LOD and LOQ for L-DOPA determination were found to be 3.41 ng/spot and 10.35 ng/spot respectively. The proposed HPTLC method was found to be precise, specific and accurate for quantitative determination of L-DOPA. It can be used for rapid screening of large germplasm collections of Mucuna pruriens for L-DOPA content. The method was used to study variation in fifteen accessions of Mucuna germplasm collected from different geographical regions."

Callus cultures were initiated in Mucuna pruriens L. and Mucuna prurita H. on MS medium supplemented with BAP and IAA at different concentrations. Suspension cultures were established in MS liquid medium supplemented with BAP, IAA, the elicitors methyl jasmonate, chitin and pectin or the precursor L-tyrosine at different concentrations for L-DOPA production. Compared to the controls, several-fold increases in L-DOPA concentration were observed in elicitor-treated and precursor-fed suspension cultures of both plant species. L-DOPA concentrations were comparatively higher in precursor-fed cultures than those receiving elicitor treatments. A parallel increase in tyrosinase and PPO levels was also observed. Loss of cell viability was observed at high concentrations of elicitor-treated cultures, whereas L-tyrosine did not cause any cell death.

The trichomes present on the pods can cause severe itching, blisters and dermatitis, discouraging cultivation. We screened genetic stocks of velvet bean for the trichome-less trait, along with high seed yield and L-DoPA content. The highest yielding trichome-less elite strain was selected and indentified on the basis of a PCR-based DNA fingerprinting method (RAPD), using deca-nucleotide primers. A genetic similarity index matrix was obtained through multivariant analysis using Nei and Li's coefficient. The similarity coefficients were used to generate a tree for cluster analysis using the UPGMA method. Analysis of amplification spectra of 408 bands obtained with 56 primers allowed us to distinguish a trichome-less elite strain of M. pruriens.",

METHODS: Diabetes was induced in Wistar rats by single intravenous injection of 120 mg/kg of alloxan monohydrate and different doses of the extract were administered to diabetic rats. The blood glucose level was determined using a glucometer and results were compared with normal and untreated diabetic rats. The acute toxicity was also determined in albino mice. RESULTS: Results showed that the administration of 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, and 100 mg/kg of the crude ethanolic extract of M. pruriens seeds to alloxan-induced diabetic rats (plasma glucose > 450 mg/dL) resulted in 18.6%, 24.9%, 30.8%, 41.4%, 49.7%, 53.1% and 55.4% reduction, respectively in blood glucose level of the diabetic rats after 8h of treatment while the administration of glibenclamide (5 mg/kg/day) resulted in 59.7% reduction. Chronic administration of the extract resulted in a significant dose dependent reduction in the blood glucose level (P<0.001). It also showed that the antidiabetic activity of M. pruriens seeds resides in the methanolic and ethanolic fractions of the extract. Acute toxicity studies indicated that the extract was relatively safe at low doses, although some adverse reactions were observed at higher doses (8-32 mg/kg body weight), no death was recorded. Furthermore, oral administration of M. pruriens seed extract also significantly reduced the weight loss associated with diabetes. CONCLUSIONS: The study clearly supports the traditional use of M. pruriens for the treatment of diabetes and indicates that the plant could be a good source of potent antidiabetic drug.",

Twenty-four lambs, 15 females and nine males of 18.7 ± 2.4 kg average weight, were allocated in three treatments using a completely randomized block design with eight replicates per treatment. Each group was given a diet with a ratio of 60% of Napier grass (Pennisetum purpureum) and 40% of a supplement with the addition of 0%, 50% whole pod or 66% of M. pruriens seeds, for TI, TII and TIII respectively. Diets were formulated to meet the requirements for 100-g daily live weight gain (LWG). The total dry matter intake (836 g a(-1) d(-1), forage + supplement), LWG (90 g a(-1) d(-1)) and feed conversion (9.66 kg DM/kg LWG) of lambs from TIII were lower (P < 0.05) compared to 941 g, 121 g, and 7.78 kg DM/kg LWG from TII and 976 g, 132 g and 7.50 kg DM/kg LWG from TI respectively. No difference was found (P > 0.05) between TI and TII in the three evaluated variables. The ME values of whole pod and seeds of M. pruriens used in this work were validated. It was concluded that M. pruriens can be included as a component in diets for growing sheep, as a partial replacement of conventional feedstuffs.",

      "abstract": "Velvet bean [Mucuna pruriens (L.) DC] is one of the most important medicinal plants. It is used to treat many ailments, but is widely used for the treatment especially for Parkinson's disease because of the presence of 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-dopa) in it. It was noticed in last 5 years that the plants in the field showed severe mosaic, downward curling of the leaves, stunting, etc. This is consistently observed over the years in India. The disease was transmitted by whiteflies and by grafting and the causal agent was found to be a bipartite begomovirus. The whole genome was amplified by rolling circle amplification (RCA) using ϕ-29 DNA polymerase and characterized. DNA-A and DNA-B shared a 124-nucleotide (nt) long highly conserved (98%) common region (CR). Comparisons with other begomovirus showed that DNA-A sequence has highest identity (76%) with an isolate of Mungbean yellow mosaic India virus (MYMIV; AY937195) reported from India. This data suggested that the present isolate is a new species of genus Begomovirus for which the name \"Velvet bean severe mosaic virus\" (VbSMV) is proposed. DNA-B has a maximum sequence identity of 49% with an isolate of Horsegram yellow mosaic virus (HgYMV; AM932426) reported from India. Infectious clones consisting of a 1.7 mer partial tandem repeat of DNA-A and a dimer of DNB-B were constructed and agro-inoculated to Macuna pruriens (L.) DC plants, which showed field observed symptoms 24 days post-infiltration (dpi). In phylogenetic analysis, DNA-A and DNA-B of the present isolate grouped with DNA-A of different begomoviruses reported from fabaceous crops. The study presents first ever molecular evidence of any disease in velvet bean and whole genome analysis of the causative virus which is a distinct bipartite species of Begomovirus.",

The phytochemical screening and antioxidant property of fresh leaves of Vitex doniana and Mucuna pruriens, used in the management and treatment of various diseases, were studied. The extracts (ethanol and distilled water) were screened for the presence of phytochemicals, and their inhibition of 2,2-diphenyl-1-picryl-hydrazyl (DPPH) radical was used to evaluate their free radical scavenging activity. Liver levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and catalase (CAT) in carbon tetrachloride- (CCl(4)) treated albino rats were also used to assess the antioxidant activity of the extracts. The animals were treated with 250 mg/kg body weight of the extracts for six consecutive days before a single dose (2.5 mL/kg body weight) of CCl(4). Vitamin C was used as the standard antioxidant. Phytochemical screening revealed the presence of saponins, tannins, anthraquinones, terpenoids, and flavonoids in all the extracts, while alkaloids were detected in extracts of Vitex doniana only, and cardiac glycosides occurred in extracts of Mucuna pruriens only. All the extracts inhibited DPPH radical in a concentration-dependent manner, water extract of Vitex doniana producing highest inhibition which was not significantly different (P > .05) from vitamin C. The extracts produced a significant decrease (P < .05) in liver MDA, while the levels of SOD and CAT significantly increased (P < .05) relative to the positive control. These results are an indication of antioxidant potential of the extracts and may be responsible for some of the therapeutic uses of these plants."

A total of 180 infertile patients were administered M. pruriens seed powder for a period of three months. Age-matched healthy men comprised the control (n=50) group in the study. Lactate, alanine, choline, citrate, glycerophosphocholine (GPC), glutamine, tyrosine, histidine, phenylalanine, and uridine were measured in seminal plasma by (1)H NMR spectroscopy. To evaluate the degree of infertility and extent of hormonal imbalance induced by this milieu, separate sperm concentration, motility, lipid peroxide in seminal plasma and LH, FSH, T, and PRL hormone concentration in serum were measured using standard laboratory methods and RIA, respectively, in the same subjects. M. pruriens therapy rectifies the perturbed alanine, citrate, GPC, histidine and phenylalanine content in seminal plasma and improves the semen quality of post-treated infertile men with compared to pre-treated. Concomitantly, clinical variables in seminal plasma and blood serum were also improved over post therapy in infertile men. On the basis of these observations, it may be proposed that M. pruriens seed powder not only reactivates the enzymatic activity of metabolic pathways and energy metabolism but also rejuvenates the harmonic balance of male reproductive hormones in infertile men. These findings open more opportunities for infertility treatment and management by improving semen quality.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Erectile dysfunction is one of the major secondary complications of diabetes. Mucuna pruriens (M. pruriens), a leguminous plant identified for its antidiabetic, aphrodisiac, and fertility enhancing properties, has been the choice of Indian traditional medicine. AIM: The objective of the present study was to analyze the efficacy of M. pruriens on free radicals-mediated penile tissue alterations in hyperglycemic male rats. Methods.  Male albino rats were divided as group I (sham) control, group II (STZ) diabetes-induced (streptozotocin 60 mg/kg of body weight [bw] in 0.1 M citrate buffer), group III (STZ + MP) diabetic rats administered with 200 mg/kg bw of ethanolic extract of M. pruriens seed, group IV (STZ + SIL) diabetic rats administered with 5 mg/kg bw of sildenafil citrate, group V (sham + MP) administered with 200 mg/kg bw of extract alone, and group VI (sham + SIL) administered with 5 mg/kg bw of sildenafil citrate. The M. pruriens and sildenafil citrate were given (gavage) once daily for a period of 60 days. At the end of 60 days, the animals were sacrificed and subjected to analysis of reactive oxygen species levels, enzymic and nonenzymic antioxidant levels, levels of NOx, histological, and histomorphometrical study of penile tissue. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Remedial use of M. pruriens seed extract on diabetes-induced erectile tissue damage. RESULTS: Significantly high levels of oxidative stress and low levels of antioxidants in the penile tissue seem to contribute to the increased collagen deposition and fibrosis of erectile tissue in STZ rats. Relatively, there was increased damage in STZ + SIL group. Supplementation of M. pruriens in STZ + MP group has revealed the potency to overcome oxidative stress, and good preservation of penile histoarchitecture. CONCLUSION:  The ethanolic extract of M. pruriens seed significantly recovered or protected erectile tissue from the oxidative stress-induced degeneration by its antioxidant potentials. These findings propound to serve mankind by the treatment of diabetes-induced erectile dysfunction.",

The effect of MEMP was also evaluated in terms of the generation of hydroxyl and 1,1-diphenyl,2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical. MEMP (100 and 200 mg kg⁻¹) inhibited haloperidol-induced vacuous chewing movements, orofacial bursts and biochemical changes. MEMP also inhibited hydroxyl radical generation and DPPH.

      "abstract": "Dopaminergic anti-parkinsonian medications, such as levodopa (LD) cause drug-induced dyskinesias (DID) in majority of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). Mucuna pruriens, a legume extensively used in Ayurveda to treat PD, is reputed to provide anti-parkinsonian benefits without inducing DID. We compared the behavioral effects of chronic parenteral administration of a water extract of M. pruriens seed powder (MPE) alone without any additives, MPE combined with the peripheral dopa-decarboxylase inhibitor (DDCI) benserazide (MPE+BZ), LD+BZ and LD alone without BZ in the hemiparkinsonian rat model of PD. A battery of behavioral tests assessed by blinded investigators served as outcome measures in these randomized trials. In experiment 1, animals that received LD+BZ or MPE+BZ at high (6mg/kg) and medium (4mg/kg) equivalent doses demonstrated significant alleviation of parkinsonism, but, developed severe dose-dependent DID. LD+BZ at low doses (2mg/kg) did not provide significant alleviation of parkinsonism. In contrast, MPE+BZ at an equivalent low dose significantly ameliorated parkinsonism. In experiment 2, MPE without any additives (12mg/kg and 20mg/kg LD equivalent dose) alleviated parkinsonism with significantly less DID compared to LD+BZ or MPE+BZ. In experiment 3, MPE without additives administered chronically provided long-term anti-parkinsonian benefits without causing DID. In experiment 4, MPE alone provided significantly more behavioral benefit when compared to the equivalent dose of synthetic LD alone without BZ. In experiment 5, MPE alone reduced the severity of DID in animals initially primed with LD+BZ. These findings suggest that M. pruriens contains water-soluble ingredients that either have an intrinsic DDCI-like activity or mitigate the need for an add-on DDCI to ameliorate parkinsonism. These unique long-term anti-parkinsonian effects of a parenterally administered water extract of M. pruriens seed powder may provide a platform for future drug discoveries and novel treatment strategies in PD.",

Soaking in 0.2% sodium bicarbonate solution + autoclaving treatment caused a substantial reduction on the levels of various antinutritional compounds such as tannins (84%), L: -Dopa (79%), phytic acid (87%), raffinose (93%), stachyose (83%), verbascose (73%), haemagglutinating activity (84%), trypsin inhibitor activity (77%), and alpha-amylase inhibitor activity (78%) without affecting the nutritional quality of velvet bean seeds. The processed velvet bean meal was incorporated as an alternative protein source by replacing soybean meal protein at 0, 20%, 40%, 60%, 80%, and 100% levels in the broiler diets. Replacement of soybean meal protein up to 40% level, which corresponds to the inclusion of velvet bean meal up to 15.7% and 11% in the starter and finisher phase poultry feeds, respectively, exhibited better growth performance of broiler birds without any adverse effects.",

This study was conducted to examine the validity of such claims. AIM OF THE STUDY: The aim of this study was to determine if ingestion of Mucuna seeds reduces helminth parasite infestation in lambs. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-six Dorper x Katahdin ram lambs were assigned to three treatments, a cottonseed meal based control diet, a diet in which Mucuna replaced cottonseed meal and the control diet with levamisole (7.5mg/kg body weight) administration. All diets were isonitrogenous and isocaloric. The 12 lambs in each treatment were assigned randomly to 4 pens, each containing 3 lambs. Lambs were trickle infected three times per week by gavage with infectious Haemonchus contortus larvae (2000 larvae/lamb) for 3 weeks. RESULTS: Levamisole treatment decreased fecal egg counts by 87% and abomasal worm counts by 83%. Mucuna intake did not statistically affect fecal egg counts or abomasal worm counts, though numerical (P>0.10) reductions of 7.4% and 18.1%, respectively were evident. Anemia indicators, feed intake, and lamb growth were unaffected by treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Levamisole reduced the Haemonchus parasite burden in lambs significantly but feeding Mucuna reduced the burden by levels unlikely to eliminate the clinical effects of parasitism.",

Experiments were conducted on guinea fowl to assess the effects of two types of heat processing (cooking and toasting) on chemical composition and nutrient digestibility of Mucuna seeds offered alone or incorporated at three concentrations (40, 120 or 200 g/kg) in complete diets. 3. Diets containing 200 g/kg seeds had more crude fibre and less ether extract. L-Dopa content increased with the amount of Mucuna inclusion. Cooking reduced markedly L-Dopa content while toasting had no effect. When fed alone, Mucuna seeds dramatically decreased feed intake. 4. Feed intake (FI) and body weight gain (BWG) were not influenced by the complete diets. Cooking significantly increased crude fibre digestibility. 5. It is suggested that cracked and cooked Mucuna bean can be incorporated at a safe level of 120 g/kg in complete diets for guinea fowl production.",

In Nigeria, the seed is used as oral prophylactics for snakebite. AIM OF THE STUDY: To study the protective effects of Mucuna pruriens seed extract against the lethalities of various snake venoms. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Rats were pre-treated with Mucuna pruriens seed extract and challenged with various snake venoms. The effectiveness of anti-Mucuna pruriens (anti-MPE) antibody to neutralize the lethalities of snake venoms was investigated by in vitro neutralization. RESULTS: In rats, MPE pre-treatment conferred effective protection against lethality of Naja sputatrix venom and moderate protection against Calloselasma rhodostoma venom. Indirect ELISA and immunoblotting studies showed that there were extensive cross-reactions between anti-MPE IgG and venoms from many different genera of poisonous snakes, suggesting the involvement of immunological neutralization in the protective effect of MPE pre-treatment against snake venom poisoning. In vitro neutralization experiments showed that the anti-MPE antibodies effectively neutralized the lethalities of Asiatic cobra (Naja) venoms, but were not very effective against other venoms tested. CONCLUSIONS: The anti-MPE antibodies could be used in the antiserum therapy of Asiatic cobra (Naja) bites.",

      "abstract": "AIM OF THE STUDY: According to Indian Systems of Medicine, Mucuna pruriens Linn., belonging to the leguminous family (Papilionaceae), were used for treating male sexual disorders since ancient times. In this study, the effects of ethanolic extracts of the Mucuna pruriens Linn. seed on general mating behaviour, libido and potency of normal male Wister albino rats were investigated and also compared with the standard reference drug, Sildenafil citrate. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Animals were divided into one control group (Group I--received saline) and four experimental groups (Groups II-V). Experimental groups were divided on the basis of the dosage of extract to the animals as follows: 150 mg/kg body weight (Group I), 200mg/kg body weight (Group II) and 250 mg/kg body weight (Group IV) while Group V received Sildenafil citrate (5mg/kg body weight). Animals were fed PO with saline or extract or standard drug once in a day for 45 days. To analyse the mating behaviour, female rats with oestrus phase were used. RESULTS: The extract administered PO significantly increased the mounting frequency, intromission frequency and ejaculation latency, and decreased the mounting latency, intromission latency, post-ejaculatory interval and inter-intromission interval. The potency test significantly increased erections, quick flips, long flips and total reflex. Therefore, the results indicated that the ethanolic extracts of Mucuna pruriens Linn. seed produced a significant and sustained increase in the sexual activity of normal male rats at a particular dose (200mg/kg). When compared to control, all the drug-treated groups have shown drug-induced effects for a few parameters. However in Group II, there was an obvious enhancement in all parameters, without affecting the normal behaviour. When compared with the standard drug, the net effect of extract is even less than that in Group II. CONCLUSIONS: Therefore, the resulting aphrodisiac activity of the extract lends support to the claim that it has traditionally been used for the treatment of sexual disorders.",

      "abstract": "Mucuna pruriens (MP) has long been used in Indian traditional medicine as support in the treatment of Parkinson's disease. However, no systematic preclinical studies that aimed at evaluating the efficacy of this substance are available to date. This study undertook an extensive evaluation of the antiparkinsonian effects of an extract of MP seeds known to contain, among other components, 12.5% L: -dihydroxyphenylalanine (L: -DOPA), as compared to equivalent doses of L: -DOPA. Moreover, the neuroprotective efficacy of MP and its potential rewarding effects were evaluated. The results obtained reveal how an acute administration of MP extract at a dose of 16 mg/kg (containing 2 mg/kg of L: -DOPA) consistently antagonized the deficit in latency of step initiation and adjusting step induced by a unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine lesion, whereas L: -DOPA was equally effective only at the doses of 6 mg/kg. At the same dosage, MP significantly improved the placement of the forelimb in vibrissae-evoked forelimb placing, suggesting a significant antagonistic activity on both motor and sensory-motor deficits. The effects of MP extract were moreover investigated by means of the turning behavior test and in the induction of abnormal involuntary movements (AIMs) after either acute or subchronic administration. MP extract acutely induced a significantly higher contralateral turning behavior than L: -DOPA (6 mg/kg) when administered at a dose of 48 mg/kg containing 6 mg/kg of L: -DOPA. On subchronic administration, both MP extract (48 mg/kg) and L: -DOPA (6 mg/kg) induced sensitization of contralateral turning behavior; however, L: -DOPA alone induced a concomitant sensitization in AIMs suggesting that the dyskinetic potential of MP is lower than that of L: -DOPA. MP (48 mg/kg) was also effective in antagonizing tremulous jaw movements induced by tacrine, a validated test reproducing parkinsonian tremor. Furthermore, MP induced no compartment preference in the place preference test, indicating the lack of components characterized by rewarding effects in the extract. Finally, in a subchronic mice model of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6 tetrahydropyridine hydrochloride (MPTP)-induced dopamine neuron degeneration, MP extract did not prove capable of preventing either tyrosine hydroxylase decrease induced by MPTP or astroglial or microglial activation as assessed by means of GFAP and CD11b immunohistochemistry, supporting the absence of neuroprotective effects by MP. Characterization MP extract strongly supports its antiparkinsonian activity.",

      "abstract": "The present investigation was undertaken to assess the role of Mucuna pruriens in infertile men who were under psychological stress. Study included 60 subjects who were undergoing infertility screening and were found to be suffering from psychological stress, assessed on the basis of a questionnaire and elevated serum cortisol levels. Age-matched 60 healthy men having normal semen parameters and who had previously initiated at least one pregnancy were included as controls. Infertile subjects were administered with M. pruriens seed powder (5 g day(-1)) orally. For carrying out morphological and biochemical analysis, semen samples were collected twice, first before starting treatment and second after 3 months of treatment. The results demonstrated decreased sperm count and motility in subjects who were under psychological stress. Moreover, serum cortisol and seminal plasma lipid peroxide levels were also found elevated along with decreased seminal plasma glutathione (GSH) and ascorbic acid contents and reduced superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase activity. Treatment with M. pruriens significantly ameliorated psychological stress and seminal plasma lipid peroxide levels along with improved sperm count and motility. Treatment also restored the levels of SOD, catalase, GSH and ascorbic acid in seminal plasma of infertile men. On the basis of results of the present study, it may be concluded that M. pruriens not only reactivates the anti-oxidant defense system of infertile men but it also helps in the management of stress and improves semen quality."

The aim of the present study was to investigate plasma proteome changes associated with MPE treatments and identify proteins responsible for survival of envenomated mice (CHALLENGED mice). Six treatment groups were studied. Three control groups: one saline, one short-term and one long-term MPE treatment. One group received EV alone. Two test groups received EV with either a short-term or long-term MPE treatment (CHALLENGED mice). The plasma from each group was analysed by 2-DE/MALDI-TOF MS. The most significant changes with treatment were: albumin, haptoglobin, fibrinogen, serum amyloid A and serum amyloid P. Most of these changes were explained by EV effects on coagulation, inflammation and haemolysis. However, MPE treatments prevented the EV-induced elevation in HPT. Consequently, HPT levels were similar to controls in the plasma of CHALLENGED mice. The plasma of CHALLENGED mice showed substantial proteomic modifications. This suggests the mechanism of MPE protection involves the activation of counterbalancing processes to compensate for the imbalances caused by EV.",

Oxidative stress plays an important role in the pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease. The ancient Indian medical system, Ayurveda, traditionally uses Mucuna pruriens to treat Parkinson's disease. In our earlier studies, Mucuna pruriens has been shown to possess antiparkinson and neuroprotective effects in animal models of Parkinson's disease. The antioxidant activity of Mucuna pruriens was demonstrated by its ability to scavenge DPPH radicals, ABTS radicals and reactive oxygen species. Mucuna pruriens significantly inhibited the oxidation of lipids and deoxyribose sugar. Mucuna pruriens exhibited divalent iron chelating activity and did not show any genotoxic/mutagenic effect on the plasmid DNA. These results suggest that the neuroprotective and neurorestorative effect of Mucuna pruriens may be related to its antioxidant activity independent of the symptomatic effect. In addition, the drug appears to be therapeutically safe in the treatment of patients with Parkinson's disease.",

Mucuna pruriens cotyledon powder (MPCP) has shown anti-parkinson and neuroprotective effects in animal models of Parkinson's disease that is superior to synthetic levodopa. In the present study two different doses of MPCP protected both plasmid DNA and genomic DNA against levodopa and divalent copper-induced DNA strand scission and damage.

      "abstract": "Mucuna pruriens possesses significantly higher antiparkinson activity compared with levodopa in the 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) lesioned rat model of Parkinson's disease. The present study evaluated the neurorestorative effect of Mucuna pruriens cotyledon powder on the nigrostriatal tract of 6-OHDA lesioned rats. Mucuna pruriens cotyledon powder significantly increased the brain mitochondrial complex-I activity but did not affect the total monoamine oxidase activity (in vitro). Unlike synthetic levodopa treatment, Mucuna pruriens cotyledon powder treatment significantly restored the endogenous levodopa, dopamine, norepinephrine and serotonin content in the substantia nigra. Nicotine adenine dinucleotide (NADH) and coenzyme Q-10, that are shown to have a therapeutic benefit in Parkinson's disease, were present in the Mucuna pruriens cotyledon powder. Earlier studies showed that Mucuna pruriens treatment controls the symptoms of Parkinson's disease. This additional finding of a neurorestorative benefit by Mucuna pruriens cotyledon powder on the degenerating dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra may be due to increased complex-I activity and the presence of NADH and coenzyme Q-10.",

In this paper we demonstrate that the MPE immunogen generating the antibody that cross-reacts with the venom proteins is a multiform glycoprotein (gpMuc) whose immunogenic properties mainly reside in its glycan-chains. The glycoprotein was purified from the protein extract of M. pruriens seeds using Concanavalin A affinity chromatography. Using 2-D gel electrophoresis it separated into seven isoforms having MWs in the range from 20.3 to 28.7 kDa and pIs from 4.8 to 6.5. N-terminal sequencing of these spots revealed close similarity since all of them contained the consensus sequence DDREPV-DT found in soybean Kunitz-type trypsin inhibitor. We suggest that gpMuc contains both N- and O-glycans. Mild alkaline treatment but not PNGase F led to loss of reactivity, indicating that O-glycans are probably involved in the antigenicity of gpMuc.",

Mucuna pruriens endocarp has also been shown to be more effective compared to synthetic levodopa in an animal model of Parkinson's disease. The present study was designed to elucidate the long-term effect of Mucuna pruriens endocarp in HP-200 on monoaminergic neurotransmitters and its metabolite in various regions of the rat brain. HP-200 at a dose of 2.5, 5.0 or 10.0 g/kg/day was mixed with rat chow and fed daily ad lib to Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 6 for each group) for 52 weeks. Controls (n = 6) received no drug. Random assignment was made for doses and control. The rats were sacrificed at the end of 52 weeks and the neurotransmitters were analyzed in the cortex, hippocampus, substantia nigra and striatum. Oral administration of Mucuna pruriens endocarp in the form of HP-200 had a significant effect on dopamine content in the cortex with no significant effect on levodopa, norepinephrine or dopamine, serotonin, and their metabolites- HVA, DOPAC and 5-HIAA in the nigrostriatal tract. The failure of Mucuna pruriens endocarp to significantly affect dopamine metabolism in the striatonigral tract along with its ability to improve Parkinsonian symptoms in the 6-hydorxydopamine animal model and humans may suggest that its antiparkinson effect may be due to components other than levodopa or that it has an levodopa enhancing effect.",

In the present study, the effects of the crude methanolic extract of leaves of Mucuna pruriens and the petroleum-ether extract of seeds of Carica papaya against I. multifiliis were investigated under in vivo and in vitro conditions. Goldfish (Carassius auratus auratus) infected with the parasites were immersed for 72 h in baths with M. pruriens extract, and for 96 h in baths with C. papaya extract. There was a 90% reduction in numbers of I. multifiliis on fish after treatment in baths of each plant extract at 200 mg l(-1 )compared to untreated controls. Consequently, parasite-induced fish mortality was reduced significantly. A complete interruption of trophont recruitment was achieved by immersion in the M. pruriens extract. In vitro tests led to a 100% mortality of I. multifiliis in 150 mg/l M. pruriens extract, and in 200 mg/l of C. papaya extract after 6 h. Although the active constituents of the medicinal plant extracts are still unknown, we have demonstrated that they have potential for effective control of I. multifiliis.",

Cooking or autoclaving of both raw seeds and presoaked seeds in different solutions (water, tamarind extract, sodium bicarbonate, and citric acid) significantly (p < 0.05) reduced the content of total phenolics, phytic acid, trypsin inhibitor and chymotrypsin inhibitor activities, and L-dopa compared to soaking or dry heating techniques. The germination processes (24 and 48 h) were also effective in the reduction of various antinutrients, although this reduction appeared to be more pronounced in a prolonged period of germination (72 h). Water soaking followed by dehusking was found to be ineffective in the reduction of trypsin and chymotrypsin inhibitor activities in both varieties. All of the treatments were effective in significantly (p < 0.05) reducing the resistant starch content in the presently investigated samples. Cooking as well as autoclaving brought about a more significant (p < 0.05) improvement in the digestibility of protein and starch compared to germination and dry heat treatment. Moreover, among the different processing techniques, soaking in sodium bicarbonate solution followed by cooking (29.6-34.8%) or autoclaving (33.0-37.2%) seemed to be the best method for improving starch digestibility.",

Some of its properties are probably linked to high concentrations of dopa since it is useful in the treatment of Parkinson's disease. The antisnake properties of an extract of Mucuna pruriens' seeds (MP101UJ) in vivo were recently demonstrated and one is now investigating its biochemical mechanism. Echis carinatus venom (EV) contains a mixture of proteins that affect the coagulative cascade, causing severe bleeding and haemorrhage. Here the effect of an extract of MP101UJ in prothrombin activation by EV in vitro by clotting and chromogenic assay is studied. An increase in procoagulant activity was found. This could explain the protective effect in vivo.",

Michaëlis-Menten kinetics was applied for each bioconversion. The apparent affinity constants were comparable with the affinity constants obtained with a homogenate directly prepared from the cells used for entrapment and with a derived partly purified phenoloxidase. The values found for the apparent maximum rates of bioconversion of the entrapped cells were ca. 50% of the values of the maximum rates of bioconversion of the cell homogenate, indicating that the entrapped cell system was not operating optimally. The effective diffusivities of the substrates and products were measured with alginate-entrapped, inactivated cells. From the five inactivation methods tested, glutaric aldehyde treatment was chosen as the general procedure. Calculated effective diffusivities for the monophenols and catechols demonstrated that these compounds could diffuse freely into and out of the beads. For each bioconversion, the observable modulus was calculated from the initial rate of bioconversion and the effective diffusivity of the substrate. The resulting values indicated that the diffusional supply rate of the substrates was not the limiting factor, except for the conversion of tyramine for which a modulus higher than one was obtained. Analogously, the observable moduli were calculated for oxygen, which was utilized for bioconversion and cell respiration, and these values pointed towards strong oxygen limitation in all cases. The bioconversion rates of the entrapped cells increased with decreasing cell aggregate size. Therefore, it was concluded that direct cell-matrix contact determined the amount of phenoloxidase involved in the bioconversions. The bioconversion rate on a protein basis was constant with enhancement of the bead charge and thus, in spite of limitations, the mixing conditions as such were relatively optimal. In conclusion, the nonoptimal efficiency of the plant cell system studied was caused by oxygen limitation and a partial phenoloxidase participation, but not by mass transfer limitations for substrates and products with the exception of the conversion of tyramine into dopamine."
