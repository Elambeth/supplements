      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: This work intended to assess the disinfection efficacy of hypochlorous acid (HA) and silver nanoparticles (AgNP) disinfectants in disinfecting the dental unit waterlines (DUWL) during comprehensive oral treatment and explore their potential applications in the oral medical environment. METHODS: Firstly, AgNP solution was prepared and evaluated through X-ray diffraction (XRD), field emission transmission electron microscope (FE-TEM), and stability tests. Subsequently, 15 dental units were selected and randomly assigned to three groups, each receiving a different disinfection method. Specifically, one group (5 units) received HA disinfectant (HA group), one group (5 units) received AgNP disinfectant (AgNP group), and another group (5 units) received a combination of HA and AgNP disinfectant (HA + AgNP group). Bacterial counts before and after disinfection were compared and analyzed at four sites on the dental units: high-speed handpiece tubing, mouthwash, ultrasonic scaler, and three-way syringe. RESULTS: The growth of biofilm on the waterlines was observed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and laser confocal microscopy (LCM). The results indicated that AgNP solution was successfully prepared and demonstrated excellent stability. There was no significant difference in the average weekly number of patients treated across the three groups (P > 0.05). After disinfection, bacterial counts were significantly reduced in all groups. Compared to the HA and AgNP groups, the HA + AgNP group exhibited a markedly lower bacterial count, with statistical significance (P < 0.05). The compliance rates observed during the first disinfection and two weeks post-disinfection were slightly lower in the HA and AgNP groups compared to the HA + AgNP group, although no significant statistical difference was found (P > 0.05). SEM images revealed uneven biofilm plaques on the inner surface of the pipes prior to disinfection, embedded within a dense matrix, while the biofilm was visibly disrupted post-disinfection. LCM software analysis showed that, compared to the HA and AgNP groups, the HA + AgNP group had a significantly lower percentage of live bacteria on the biofilm post-disinfection (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Compared to any single disinfectant regimen, the combined use of HA and AgNPs effectively inhibited bacterial growth and exerted a significant destructive effect on biofilms. Therefore, this combination is expected to be a viable option for disinfection of DUWL in the oral healthcare setting. CLINICAL TRIAL NUMBER: Not applicable."

      "abstract": "Oxidative stress is universal to all cell types, including cancer. It is elicited by a surplus of reactive oxygen species (ROS) or a reduced cellular ability to defend against those. At low levels (oxidative eustress), this induces altered cellular signaling, while at higher levels (oxidative distress), cellular toxicity and non-specific redox signaling become apparent. While oxidation-induced cell death is a hallmark of many cancer therapies, including ROS-producing radiotherapy, some chemotherapies and targeted therapies, photodynamic therapy, and recently emerging physical modalities such as medical gas plasma (a multi-ROS generating technology), less is known about the transcriptional profiles predisposing cancer cells to oxidative demise. In particular, which genes are associated with resistance or sensitivity to ROS overload and subsequent toxicity has not been systematically investigated. Moreover, it is unclear if there are differences between oxidant types, such as hydrogen peroxide and hypochlorous acid. To this end, we here employed 35 cell lines of various origins (e.g., adenocarcinoma, melanoma, leukemia, squamous cell carcinoma, and neuroblastoma). We first performed in-house transcriptomic analysis to assess baseline transcriptional profiles. Second, all cell lines were exposed to four different ROS concentrations of either hydrogen peroxide, hypochlorous, or gas plasma exposure. Third, correlation analysis was performed to identify genes associated with (i) oxidative stress sensitivity, (ii) oxidative stress resistance, and (iii) similarities and/or differences between the different oxidative stress inducers. Intriguingly, distinct gene sets were found for all treatments, and there was a striking difference between hydrogen peroxide and hypochlorous acid, suggesting different modes of action of both oxidants."

      "abstract": "Hypochlorous acid has been attempted as an additive to animal drinking water in practical animal farming processes for water microbial quality control. Despite its potential, there is still a knowledge gap concerning the effects of hypochlorous acid on both poultry growth performance and gut microbial load. To address this gap, an animal study was conducted using flow cytometry to quantify the age-related microbial load in broiler manure and gut contents. We observed that the effect on growth performance was sustained only during the starter phase, with no significant impact throughout the entire production cycle. The treatment could reduce the microbial load of both fresh broiler manure and cecal contents. Despite this convergence in the duodenum, significant differences in microbial loads between the control and treatment groups persisted in the manure and cecal contents throughout the later stages. Our findings demonstrate that consuming low-concentration hypochlorous acid water over the long term can lower the microbial load in the broiler gut throughout the entire growth cycle without impacting overall growth performance. Future research on drinking or feed additives should incorporate microbial absolute quantification methods to achieve a more precise assessment of microbiota."

PURPOSE: The objective of this study was to determine the rate of bacteria-related postoperative complications following surgical reconstruction of stage IV PIs in which a pure hypochlorous acid (pHA) antimicrobially preserved wound cleaning solution was used. METHODS: This 1-year retrospective review evaluated the outcomes of patients who underwent surgical reconstructive treatment of chronic stage IV PI. Surgical management consisted of wide debridement, intraoperative cultures, and irrigation with 8 to 10 minutes indwelling of a pHA antimicrobially preserved wound cleaning solution prior to closure and application of incisional negative pressure wound therapy (iNPWT). RESULTS: Thirteen patients (18 chronic, stage IV PIs) were included in the study. Intraoperative cultures were positive for 10/18 wounds (55.6%). A bacteria-related postoperative complication occurred in 1 patient (1/13, 7.7%; postoperative dehiscence requiring reoperation). CONCLUSIONS: Adjunctive irrigation and indwelling of a pHA antimicrobially preserved wound cleansing solution in the surgical management of chronic, stage IV PIs in this 1-year retrospective review resulted in a 7.7% bacteria-related postoperative complication rate.",

      "abstract": "To answer the call for effective and timely intervention in cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), the development of fluorescent probes that can precisely identify atherosclerotic plaques, the root cause of various fatal CVDs, is highly desirable but remains a great challenge. Herein, by integrating bis(trifluoromethyl)benzyl and phenothiazine into the coumarin matrix, a robust fluorescent probe, NOR1, has been developed. NOR1 responds sequentially to lipid droplets (LDs) and HClO via fluorescence turn-on and ratiometric readouts, respectively, with a fast response rate (within 70 s for LDs and 80 s for HClO), excellent sensitivity (detection limit: 0.41 μg/mL for LDs and 23.38 nM for HClO), and high selectivity. Based on these impressive features, NOR1 was successfully applied to discriminate foam cells from others by simultaneously monitoring two hallmark events, lipid accumulation and oxidative stress, in foam cells. Furthermore, the use of NOR1 to monitor in real time the transformation process of A7r5 cells into foam cells under high LDL/glucose conditions was successfully realized for the first time. Importantly, we further demonstrate the ability of NOR1 to precisely identify atherosclerotic plaques with clear margin delineation, highlighting its potential utility in elucidating the pathological mechanism and clinical diagnosis of atherosclerosis.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Chronic or hard-to-heal wounds fail to proceed through an orderly and timely healing process, resulting in a lack of anatomic and functional integrity. Infection is a common driver of nonhealing processes; therefore, infection prevention and management are essential components to healing chronic wounds. Inexpensive specialized cleansers, such as pure hypochlorous acid (pHA), can be used to cleanse vulnerable wounds to reduce microbial burden, thereby reducing the risk of infection and significantly decreasing the likelihood of the patient developing a costly wound complication. OBJECTIVE: To report the findings of an expert panel composed of 10 health care professionals (HCPs) from diverse medical specialties convened to discuss the use of pHA in various care settings. METHODS: During the panel discussion, experienced HCPs presented specific case examples in which pHA was used, along with associated costs. RESULTS: A major theme of the panel discussion was the widespread benefit of pHA across various types of wounds and wound care settings. In addition, the patient cases illustrated a negligible economic impact of pHA coupled with positive effects on patient outcomes. This work did not include the development of a consensus statement. CONCLUSION: Together, the information presented in the panel discussion supports pHA as a dominant strategy (more effective, less costly) compared with standard wound management practices in many treatment settings.",

      "abstract": "Over 40,000 patients in the United States (US) require hospitalization for burns annually. The treatment regimen can cost more than $6,000 a day and requires the use of numerous supplies to ensure the graft takes for successful wound healing. Irrigation of the wound is a critical step for burn treatment, yet little is known about the cost-effectiveness of different irrigation modalities. In a recent study, pure hypochlorous acid preserved wound cleanser (pHA) was shown to be safe and effective compared to mafenide. This study estimated the associated costs of two common wound irrigation modalities, pHA and mafenide solution, for the treatment of patients with burns. In this study, a patient-level Monte Carlo simulation model using data from a randomized control trial (RCT) was used to conduct the cost analysis from the US Hospital perspective. Based upon 100,000 simulated patients, pHA was expected to save $133 ($123 to $144, 10th to 90th percentile) for the hospital compared to using a mafenide solution over 14 days. Adoption of pHA should be considered a cost-saving strategy when treating patients with burns."

      "abstract": "Microbial contamination during seafood processing can often lead to a reduction in shelf life and the possibility of food-borne illnesses. Sanitisation with chlorine-based products during seafood processing is therefore sometimes undertaken. This study compared the effects of two sanitisers, chlorine dioxide (ClO2) and hypochlorous acid (HOCl) at their suggested concentration (5 ppm and 10 ppm; 50 ppm and 100 ppm respectively), on physical, chemical, and microbial qualities of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) fillets throughout 7 days of simulated retail display refrigeration. Parameters used for assessment included quality index (QI), drip loss, colour, texture, histology, total volatile base nitrogen (TVB-N), lipid oxidation (malonaldehyde, MDA), pH, and total viable count changes. Results indicated that whilst drip loss increased over the storage time, day 4 and 7 drip loss in both sanitisers decreased significantly compared with the control. There was a linear relationship (R > 0.70) between QI and storage time in all treatments, particularly in regard to skin brightness, flesh odour, and gaping parameters, but treatment differences were not present. Texture parameters including gumminess, chewiness, and hardness increased over time in the control whilst both sanitiser treatments seemed to provide protective effects against texture hardening during storage. The observed softening effects from the sanitiser treatments were aligned with microstructural and cytological changes in the histology results, as evidenced by a reduced fibre-fibre adhesion, myodigeneration, and an increase in interfibrillar space over storage time. Colour, especially chroma (C*), was shown to decrease over time in control, whereas insignificant protective effects were observed in both sanitiser treatments at day 7. Irrespective of treatment and storage time, MDA levels exceeded the acceptable limit on all days, whilst TVB-N levels were below the critical limit. Although pH was influenced by treatment and storage time, the pH was within the normal range. Microbiological results showed that with sanitiser addition, TVC was below the permissible level (106 CFU/g) until day 4 but ClO2 ice (5 ppm), ClO2 (10 ppm), and HOCl (100 ppm) treated fillets all exceeded the limit on day 7. The mixed results on the effect of sanitiser addition on fillet quality and shelf life suggested that further investigation on pathogen reduction, sanitiser introductory method, as well as testing the same treatments in low-fat fish models would be recommended."

The probe demonstrated high specificity for ClO- over other ROS and exhibited a strong linear detection relationship. Based on its performance, we focused on the TGF-β pathway in the development of keloids. ROS upregulation was observed in keloid-derived fibroblasts. Using ClO- as an intrinsic overexpression marker, our probe effectively distinguished between normal fibroblasts and keloid-derived fibroblasts both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, Pro-NBS showed potential for monitoring the progression and evaluating the systematic therapy of abnormal scarring or keloids.",

Heteroatoms P and O were introduced into the carbon felt by phosphoric acid activation followed by heat treatment. The maximum active chlorine concentration on the P@CF electrode could reach 616.8 mg/L in 60 min under the optimal synthesis conditions of a phosphoric acid mass fraction of 30%, a phosphoric acid impregnation time of 3 h, and a heat treatment temperature of 300 °C. The active chlorine concentration was 1.8 times higher on the P@CF electrode compared to the original carbon felt electrode. The optimal reaction conditions for the generation of active chlorine were as follows: salt concentration of 9 g/L, voltage of 7 V, and electrode spacing of 2 cm as verified by response surfaces. This electrolysis reaction follows one-stage reaction kinetics. Subsequently, the disinfection efficacy of the produced disinfectants was examined.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: People who suffered type 2 diabetes have impaired healing of wounds due to the large number of circulating inflammatory cells resulting from high blood sugar levels. The wound healing process involves various complex processes including the degradation of extracellular matrix, a process characterized by an increase in matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9). Conventional management of diabetic wounds usually involves systemic blood sugar control and topical antimicrobial treatment, including hydrogen peroxide and povidone-iodine, which are known to be cytotoxic to the cells involved in the wound healing cascade. Finding a safe, non-toxic, and effecting wound cleansing still poses a challenge, and hypochlorous acid (HOCl) could act as a potential candidate. PURPOSE: Unveiling an HOCl ion as an agent for diabetic wound management and MMP-9 as a marker for delayed diabetic wound healing. METHODS: The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) Flow Diagram is used to find and select related, eligible literatures for the review. The authors used several databases such as Pro Quest, Scopus, Springer link and Science Direct. In addition, and to expand the data, the database on Google Scholar was also opened. Then, the compiled data are analyzed to form results and discussions to the research question. RESULTS: Five eligible articles passed the inclusion criteria and reviewed for data synthesis. From 5 pieces of literature, it was found that the use of HOCl ions can be a good choice of topical agent in the management of diabetic wounds and decrease the activity of MMP-9, which act as a marker for delayed healing of diabetic wounds. CONCLUSION: Topical agent, in this case HOCl ion, shows good results and can be used as an option in the management of diabetic wounds and MMP-9 can be used as a predictive marker in the management of diabetic wounds."

Its use for air treatment can be an effective tool for the prevention and therapy of infectious diseases. In this work, the in vivo study was conducted on 110 Wistar Han rats (12 and 72 weeks old) on the effect of a single inhalation of air containing gaseous HOCl on the activity of antioxidant system enzymes. For this, a special installation was designed to uniformly maintain the concentration of HOCl in the air and regulate it over a wide range. Inhalation exposure was carried out for 4 h at total chlorine concentrations in the air of approximately 2.0 mg/m3 and 5.0 mg/m3, after which the animals were observed for 14 days. The effect of inhalation on the antioxidant system activity varied significantly in animals of different ages. Catalase activity in young rats increased approximately 2-fold on days 1-2 after inhalation, regardless of the HOCl concentration, while in old animals a sharp dose-dependent decrease was initially observed. The glutathione peroxidase activity in animals of both ages increased upon inhalation of air with 5.0 mg/m3 HOCl, and in old animals this was more pronounced; when the HOCl concentration decreased to 2.0 mg/m3, this indicator increased slightly in old rats and remained virtually unchanged in young ones. The glutathione reductase activity when exposed to 2.0 mg/m3 HOCl did not change for both age groups, and with increasing HOCl concentration it increased by 1.5-2.0 times in all animals.",

However, the effects of exogenous HOCl on biological processes have not been reported. In this study, the effects of highly purified slightly acidic hypochlorous acid water (HP-HAW) were investigated. After the safety of oral administration of HP-HAW was confirmed, the effects of HP-HAW on glucose homeostasis were assessed in mice. HP-HAW treatment significantly improved blood glucose levels in hyperglycemic condition. Based on the 16S rRNA sequencing, HP-HAW treatment significantly increased the diversity and changed the composition of gut microbiota by decreasing the abundance of genus Romboutsia in mice fed normal chow. In obese mice, HP-HAW administration tended to improve glucose tolerance. HP-HAW also attenuated memory impairments and changes N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor mRNA expression in obese mice. HP-HAW treatment suppressed Il-6 mRNA expression in the hippocampus in type 2 diabetic mice. Overall, these results support HP-HAW as a potential therapeutic agent to improve or prevent glucose tolerance and memory decline via gut microbiota alteration.",

Although there are numerous probes available for detecting HOCl in the OA region, probes with dual functions of diagnostic and therapeutic capabilities are still significantly lacking. While this type of probe can reduce the time gap between diagnosis and treatment, which is clinically needed. Methods: We developed a fluorescent probe (DHU-CBA1) toward HOCl with theranostics functions through the release of methylene blue (MB) and ibuprofen (IBP) in this work. DHU-CBA1 can detect HOCl with high specificity and sensitivity, releasing MB and IBP with an impressive efficiency of ≥ 95% in vitro. Results: DHU-CBA1 exhibits good biosafety, enabling in vivo imaging of endogenous HOCl, along with reducing arthritis scores, improving synovitis and cartilage damage, and maintaining catabolic balance while alleviating senescence in cartilage. Conclusions: This study proposes a novel approach to enhance osteoarthritis therapy by releasing IBP via a smart HOCl-enabled fluorescent probe.",

OBJECTIVE: To illustrate the clinical efficacy of the use of pure hypochlorous acid (pHA) antimicrobially preserved wound cleansing solution as the instillation fluid for NPWTi-d (NPWTi-d/pHA) in wound bed preparation in patients with complex wounds. CASE REPORT: The treatment protocol for use of NPWTi-d/pHA in preparing wound beds for final closure is demonstrated in 3 illustrative cases of patients with complex wounds resulting from necrotizing infection and trauma with heavy contamination. All 3 patients developed a healthy-appearing wound bed deemed suitable for primary closure an average of approximately 1 month following initial surgical debridement. CONCLUSION: The cases presented demonstrate the ability of a pHA antimicrobially preserved wound cleansing solution used as the instillation fluid with NPWTi-d to aid in bacterial reduction, mechanical debridement, and promotion of wound healing. Use of NPWTi-d/pHA in these cases of extensive necrotizing infection and posttraumatic injury with heavy contamination allowed for final closure an average of 1 month after initial surgical debridement.",

Hypochlorous acid (HClO), an important biomarker of oxidative stress originating mainly from the mitochondria, has been shown to be intimately connected to the development and course of ALI. Herein, a novel BODIPY-based NIR ratiometric fluorescent probe Mito-BS was constructed for the specific recognition of mitochondrial HClO. The probe Mito-BS can rapidly respond to HClO within 20 s with a ratiometric fluorescence response (from 680 nm to 645 nm), 24-fold fluorescence intensity ratio enhancement (I645/I680), a wide pH adaptation range (5-9) and the low detection limit (31 nM). The probe Mito-BS has been effectively applied to visualize endogenous and exogenous HClO fluctuations in living zebrafish and cells based on its low cytotoxicity and prominent mitochondria-targeting ability. Furthermore, the fluorescent probe Mito-BS makes it possible to achieve the non-invasive in-situ diagnosis of ALI through in mice, and provides a feasible strategy for early diagnosis and drug therapy of ALI and its complications.",

This challenge was addressed by developing the SoftOx Biofilm Eradicator (SBE) composed of hypochlorous acid (HOCl) and acetic acid with strong broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity. Approach: First-in-human study investigating the safety and tolerability as primary endpoints and wound size effect and antimicrobial efficacy as secondary endpoints of SBE treatment in chronic leg wound patients. The study was divided into two as follows: a randomized, double-blinded, Single Ascending Dose (SAD) phase (n = 16 SBE; n = 4 placebo), where patients were treated with SBE or saline (placebo) only once, followed by an open-label, Multiple Ascending Dose (MAD) phase (n = 8), where patients were treated with SBE once daily or twice daily over five days. Reporting is according to CONSORT guidelines. Results: SBE was safe and well-tolerated in chronic leg wound patients. There were no significant differences in pain during and after treatment with SBE or the placebo. The SBE treatment reduced bioburden in wounds compared to baseline, with 98% and 49% median reduction after SBE or placebo treatment, respectively. A dose-dependent trend in absolute wound size reduction was observed in the MAD groups with a median (min, max) change of -2.99 (-14.25, -1.5) cm2 in the once-daily and -10.48 (-17.95, -0.38) cm2 in the twice-daily group, respectively. Innovation and Conclusion: This study demonstrated the safe use of HOCl-based SBE in chronic leg wounds with promising trends of immediate antimicrobial action and beneficial effect on wound healing.",

NPWTi-d (or NPWTi) is an established adjunctive wound modality for a variety of wound etiologies in various anatomic locations in which an instillate solution dwells on the surface of the wound to assist in wound bed preparation. A variety of solutions have been used, including 0.9% normal saline wound cleansers and antiseptics. pHAp is growing in popularity as the solution of choice for NPWTi-d. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate consensus statements on the use of NPWTi-d with pHAp. METHODS: A 15-member multidisciplinary panel of expert clinicians in the United States, Canada, and France convened in person in April 2023 in Washington, D.C. and/or corresponded later to discuss 10 statements on the use of pHAp with NPWTi-d. The panelists then replied \"agree\" or \"disagree\" to each statement and had the option to provide comments. RESULTS: Ten consensus statements are presented, along with the proportion of agreement or disagreement and summary comments. Although agreement with the statements on NPWTi-d with pHAp varied, the statements appear to reflect individual preferences for use rather than concerns about safety or efficacy. CONCLUSION: The consensus indicates that NPWTi-d with pHAp can have a beneficial effect in wound care.",

This study was performed using 64 dentin blocks. E. faecalis suspension was dispensed to each sample and incubated under anaerobic conditions at 37°C throughout 21 days. After the inoculation period, the following solutions were added to each group and kept for 5 min: Group 1, 5.25% sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl); Group 2, 2.5% NaOCl; Group 3, 1% NaOCl; Group 4, 2% chlorhexidine (CHX); Group 5, 200 ppm hypochlorous acid (HOCl); and Group 6, AgNPs. The samples of positive control were treated with sterile saline. Biofilm viability assay was performed using the LIVE/DEAD BacLight Bacterial Viability Kit. Samples were examined using confocal laser scanning microscopy, respectively. There was no significant difference between the 5.25% NaOCl, 2.5% NaOCl, and 1%NaOCl groups (p > .05). However, these groups showed statistically higher antibacterial activity than the 2% CHX, 200 ppm HOCl, and AgNP groups. Also, 2% CHX showed greater percentage of dead cells compared with the AgNP and HOCl groups. While AgNPs group showed lower dead cell rate than all NaOCl groups and 2% CHX, it caused higher dead cells than 200 ppm HOCl group. The 200 ppm HOCl group showed the lowest percentage of dead cells (p < .05) Although the antibacterial effect of AgNPs is not as high as NaOCl and CHX, it has considerable bactericidal activity against E. faecalis and can be improved by further studies.

Disinfectants such as alcohol, quaternary ammonium salts, and chlorine-releasing agents, including hypochlorous acid, are used to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection. In the present study, we investigated the efficacy of ionless hypochlorous acid water (HOCl) in suspension and by spraying to inactivate SARS-CoV-2. The virucidal efficacy of HOCl solution in tests against SARS-CoV-2 was evaluated as 50% tissue culture infectious dose. Although the presence of organic compounds influenced the virucidal efficacy, HOCl treatment for 20 s was significantly effective to inactivate Wuhan and Delta strains in the suspension test. HOCl atomization for several hours significantly reduced the SARS-CoV-2 attached to plastic plates. These results indicate that HOCl solution with elimination containing NaCl and other ions may have high virucidal efficacy against SARS-CoV-2.

      "abstract": "Myeloperoxidase (MPO) plays critical role in the pathology of cerebral ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury via producing hypochlorous acid (HOCl) and inducing oxidative modification of proteins. High-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) oxidation, particularly disulfide HMGB1 formation, facilitates the secretion and release of HMGB1 and activates neuroinflammation, aggravating cerebral I/R injury. However, the cellular sources of MPO/HOCl in ischemic brain injury are unclear yet. Whether HOCl could promote HMGB1 secretion and release remains unknown. In the present study, we investigated the roles of microglia-derived MPO/HOCl in mediating HMGB1 translocation and secretion, and aggravating the brain damage and blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption in cerebral I/R injury. In vitro, under the co-culture conditions with microglia BV cells but not the single culture conditions, oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R) significantly increased MPO/HOCl expression in PC12 cells. After the cells were exposed to OGD/R, MPO-containing exosomes derived from BV2 cells were released and transferred to PC12 cells, increasing MPO/HOCl in the PC12 cells. The HOCl promoted disulfide HMGB1 translocation and secretion and aggravated OGD/R-induced apoptosis. In vivo, SD rats were subjected to 2 h of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) plus different periods of reperfusion. Increased MPO/HOCl production was observed at the reperfusion stage, accomplished with enlarged infarct volume, aggravated BBB disruption and neurological dysfunctions. Treatment of MPO inhibitor 4-aminobenzoic acid hydrazide (4-ABAH) and HOCl scavenger taurine reversed those changes. HOCl was colocalized with cytoplasm transferred HMGB1, which was blocked by taurine in rat I/R-injured brain. We finally performed a clinical investigation and found that plasma HOCl concentration was positively correlated with infarct volume and neurological deficit scores in ischemic stroke patients. Taken together, we conclude that ischemia/hypoxia could activate microglia to release MPO-containing exosomes that transfer MPO to adjacent cells for HOCl production; Subsequently, the production of HOCl could mediate the translocation and secretion of disulfide HMGB1 that aggravates cerebral I/R injury. Furthermore, plasma HOCl level could be a novel biomarker for indexing brain damage in ischemic stroke patients.",

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the in vitro cytotoxicity and antibacterial activity of different concentrations of hypochlorous acid (HOCl). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Five different concentrations (100, 200, 300, 400, and 500 ppm) of HOCl were evaluated for their antimicrobial efficacy against Gram-negative (A. actinomycetcmcomitans and P. gingivalis) and Gram-positive bacteria (S. mutans and S. sanguinis) after treatment for 1 and 10 min. Sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) and chlorhexidine (CHX) were used as positive controls. In addition, HOCl was examined for L929 cytotoxicity and RAW 264.7 growth. RESULTS: The bacteriostatic ratio of NaOCl was comparable to that of CHX and significantly (P < 0.05) higher than that of all HOCl solutions. Higher HOCl concentration had significantly (P < 0.05) higher antibacterial effect, and the bacteriostatic ratio of 10 min treatment was slightly higher than that of 1 min treatment. CHX and NaOCl seeded into L929 cells resulted in low cell viability with only 30-39%, much significantly (P < 0.05) lower than all HOCl groups (greater than 80%). All HOCl solutions met the recommendations of ISO 10993-5 and showed no cytotoxicity, although there was a concentration-dependent decrease in cell viability. All antimicrobial agents showed the same trend of response to RAW 264.7 as L929. CONCLUSION: Within the limit of this study, 400 ppm HOCl disinfectant may be a potential antimicrobial candidate for mouthwash, endodontic irrigants, and periodontitis treatment."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND/AIMS: To investigate the clinical outcomes and antimicrobial activity of an hypochlorous acid hygiene solution compared with hyaluronic acid wipes for blepharitis treatment in patients with dry eye disease (DED). METHODS: This study involved 48 eyes of 48 patients affected by blepharitis with mild to moderate DED. 24 patients were treated with a hypochlorous acid hygiene solution (HOCL group) and 24 patients were treated with hyaluronic acid wipes (HYAL group) for a period of 4 weeks. The following clinical outcomes were assessed before (V0) and after the treatment period (V1): non-invasive keratograph break up time (NIK-BUT), tear film BUT (TF-BUT) tear meniscus height (TMH), Keratograph meibography, Meibomian Gland Yield Secretion Score (MGYSS), Corneal Staining Score (CSS), Schirmer test I, Keratograph conjunctival redness score and Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI). Moreover, microbiological analysis of upper and lower eyelid margins was performed at V0 both before and 5 min after treatment. RESULTS: After 1-month NIK-BUT and TF-BUT significantly increased in HOCL group, while they did not show a statistically significant difference in HYAL group compared with baseline. OSDI, TMH and MGYSS showed a significant difference in both groups, while Schirmer test, meibography, CSS and conjunctival redness score did not significantly change in both groups. Bacterial load showed a significant reduction in both groups, more pronounced in HOCL group compared with HYAL group. CONCLUSIONS: Hypochlorous acid hygiene solution can be securely employed in blepharitis treatment considering the satisfying clinical outcomes and antimicrobial activity compared with hyaluronic acid wipes.",

This study evaluated the efficiency of hypochlorous acid (HOCl) as an antimicrobial disinfectant by spraying technique for the alginate impression materials, compared with sodium hypochlorite, and its effect on dimensional stability and reproduction of details. HOCl with a concentration of 200 ppm for 5 and 10 min was compared with the control group (no treatment) as a negative control and with sodium hypochlorite (% 0.5) as a positive control. Candida albicans, Staphylococcus aureus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were selected to assess the antimicrobial activity with the colony forming unit test in addition to the dimensional stability and reproduction of details tests. The results revealed that HOCl had significant antimicrobial activity against all tested microorganisms and experimental time. Interestingly, HOCl showed no impact on the dimensional stability of alginate impression material. HOCl could be an effective antimicrobial agent for alginate impression material without interfering with their surface details and dimensional stability."

      "abstract": "It is essential to employ efficient measures to prevent the transmission of pathogenic agents during a pandemic. One such method involves using hypochlorous acid (HClO) solution. The oxidative properties of HClO water (HAW) can contribute to its ability to eliminate viral particles. Here, we examined a highly purified slightly acidic hypochlorous acid water (Hp-SA-HAW) obtained from the reverse osmosis membrane treatment of an electrolytically-generated SA-HAW for its anti-viral activity and mode of action on viral proteins. Hp-SA-HAW exhibited broad-spectrum antiviral effects against various viruses, including adenovirus, hepatitis B virus, Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), and rotavirus. Additionally, Hp-SA-HAW treatment dose-dependently resulted in irreversibly aggregated multimers of the JEV envelope and capsid proteins. However, Hp-SA-HAW treatment had no discernible effect on viral RNA, indicating that Hp-SA-HAW acts against amino acids rather than nucleic acids. Furthermore, Hp-SA-HAW substantially reduced the infectivity of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), including the ancestral variant and other multiple variants. Hp-SA-HAW treatment induced the aggregation of the SARS-CoV-2 spike and nuclear proteins and disrupted the binding of the purified spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 to human ACE2. This study demonstrates that the broad-spectrum virucidal activity of highly purified HClO is attributed to viral protein aggregation of virion via protein oxidation."

The existing protocols tend to antagonize the risk factors that promote the chronicity of this type of wound. Hypochlorous acid (HOCl) is used to treat ulcers and wounds because of its antiseptic and noncytotoxic properties. Its liquid form is effective but has little residual effect, while in gel it has more residual power. METHODS: An experimental nonrandomized study has been carried out treating 346 chronic ulcers of various etiologies in 220 patients. Ulcer outcomes were originally classified as: \"complete healing,\" \"incomplete healing without infection,\" and \"incomplete healing with infection.\" Various antiseptic solutions were used as ulcers cleaning solutions: liquid HOCl, gel HOCl, polymeric biguanide, or chlorhexidine. Only one was applied to the lesion as monotherapy. But, in other cases, we used a combined HOCl (liquid then gel: bitherapy). Bivariate (Chi-square and variance tests) and multivariate studies (logistic regression) evaluated associations of ulcer characteristics and mono or bitherapy outcomes. RESULTS: Four factors reduce the probability of complete ulcer healing: patient age (odds ratio [OR]: 0.97); weeks of ulcer evolution (OR: 0.99); poor granulation on admission (OR: 0.35); and need for antibiotic therapy (OR: 0.41). One factor favored healing: combined HOCl therapy with liquid plus gel (OR: 4.8). Infections were associated with longer times of evolution (OR: 1.002) and bad odor of the ulcer on admission (OR: 14), but bitreatment with HOCl reduced the risk of infection (OR: 0.3). CONCLUSION: A double HOCl formulation (liquid plus gel) reduces the probability of poor healing and infection, in chronic ulcers of various etiologies."

However, the high pigmentation in melanin-containing tumors can hide the tumor cell structures, making diagnosing challenging. Previously, hydrogen peroxide and potassium permanganate were utilized for melanin bleaching with several limitations. For instance, hydrogen peroxide has a weak bleaching ability, and the process is time-consuming (12 h). Meanwhile, potassium permanganate affects the antigenicity of antigens and is unsuitable for immunohistochemical (IHC) staining. In this study, the hypochlorous acid (HClO) solution was applied to hematoxylin-eosin and IHC staining of melanin tissue sections. The study discovered that 1% HClO could completely bleach melanin particles in tumor tissues in a short period (19.95 ± 2.53 min) without compromising the hematoxylin-eosin staining. In addition, 2% HClO was utilized for bleaching at room temperature for 61.17 ± 4.32 minutes after the tissue was incubated with 3,3'-diaminobenzidine in IHC staining. This treatment effectively removed melanin without negatively impacting 3,3'-diaminobenzidine signal expression, thus ensuring that the sections met the necessary diagnostic requirements. Therefore, this method could facilitate pathologists in disease diagnosis of melanin-containing tissues.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The effects of a low concentration of hypochlorous acid (HOCl) mouthwash on salivary bacteria remained unclear. We aimed to evaluate the antibacterial effects of 100 ppm HOCl mouthwash on salivary bacteria, including Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), in patients with periodontal disease (PD). METHODS: Patients with PD were randomized into mouthwash-only (MW, n = 26) and mouthwash with periodontal flosser (MWPF, n = 27) groups. Patients without PD were selected for the control group (n = 30). S. aureus culture and saliva samples (before and after the intervention) were collected for bacterial DNA extraction. A real-time polymerase chain reaction assay and serial dilutions of S. aureus culture and saliva samples were used to measure the salivary bacteria total count (SBTC) and confirm the antibacterial effects of the mouthwash using S. aureus. RESULTS: No significant difference in demographic data was observed among the three groups. Before the intervention, the baseline SBTC of the MW and MWPF groups was significantly higher than that of the control group. After the mouthwash rinses, the SBTC data significantly changed in the MW and MWPF groups only (by 62.4% and 77.4%, respectively). After the base-2 log-transformation of the SBTC data, a similar trend was observed. Linear regression revealed that baseline SBTC and the MWPF intervention significantly affected SBTC reduction percentage by volume. After incubation with 10% (v/v) of mouthwash, the survival rates of 106 and 107 colony-forming units/mL of S. aureus were 0.51% ± 0.06% and 1.42% ± 0.37%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: These study results indicated that 100 ppm HOCl mouthwash treatment could effectively reduce SBTC in patients with PD and the abundance of S. aureus. It provides that the HOCl mouthwash can be an option for individuals to help control SBTC, especially in patients with PD. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The study protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Kaohsiung Medical University Hospital (KMUHIRB-F(I)-20200042) on 20/03/2020 and retrospectively registered at ClinicalTrial.gov (NCT05372835) on 13/05/2022.",

Currently, low-impact but effective biocides that are prepared in a way that avoids waste, with a very low toxicity, and safe and easy to handle and store are strongly needed. In this study, produced electrochemically activated hypochlorous (HOCl) acid solutions are investigated and proposed, integrated in a scrubbing machine for floor cleaning treatment. Such an innovative machine has been used for floor cleaning and sanitation in order to evaluate the microbial charge and organic dirt removal capacity of HOCl in comparison with a machine charged with traditional Ecolabel standard detergent.

It could have an equivalent or no inferiority effect to chlorhexidine (CHX) to avoid recolonization of these microorganisms after the post-surgical period. OBJECTIVE: The objective is to compare the reduction of plaque index (PI), gingival index (GI), pocket depth (PD), gain of clinical attachment level (CAL), and bacterial recolonization of periodontopathic microorganisms in subgingival biofilm at 7, 21, and 90 days after Open Flap Debridement (OFD) under two antimicrobial protocols: (A) HOCl 0.05% followed by HOCl 0.025% and (B) CHX 0.2%/CHX 0.12% used per 21 days without regular oral hygiene during the post-surgical period. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A no-inferiority randomized controlled trial was carried out. Thirty-two patients were randomly divided to receive each antiplaque protocol after OFD in patients with periodontitis. Clinical indexes and bacterial recolonization were assessed using qPCR for up to 90 days. Data were analyzed using repeated measures ANOVA, mixed effects models adjusted for treatment, time, and the Chi-squared/Fisher test. A no-inferiority analysis was also performed using the Hodges-Lehmann hypothesis test for non-inferiority. RESULTS: HOCl was not inferior to CHX in reducing PI. Both groups showed a comparable reduction of recolonization for Porphyromonas gingivalis, Tannerella forsythia, and Eubacterium nodatum. However, the HOCl protocol was non-inferior to the CHX protocol for Treponema denticola and Aggregatibacter actinomicetemcomitans. CONCLUSIONS: HOCl improved periodontal healing. HOCl showed an impact in reducing the recolonization of periodontopathic bacteria in the postoperative period."

METHODS: The time-kill assay and broth microdilution procedures were used in vitro to demonstrate that 0.01% HCLO was fungicidal and fungistatic. The severity of the disease was evaluated in vivo using a clinical score and slit-lamp photographs. Fungal load, polymorphonuclear neutrophil infiltration, and the production of related proteins were determined using colony plate counting, in vivo confocal microscopy, periodic acid-Schiff staining, fungal fluorescence staining, immunofluorescence staining, myeloperoxidase assay, and Western blotting. RESULT: In vitro, 0.01% HCLO can destroy A. fumigatus spores in 1 minute. The optical density of the 0.01% HCLO group was significantly lower than that of the phosphate-buffered saline control group (P < 0.01), and no visible mycelium was observed using a fluorescence microscope. 0.01% HCLO reduced the severity of A. fumigatus keratitis in rats by decreasing the clinical score, fungal loading (periodic acid-Schiff, plate count, and fungal fluorescence staining), and inhibiting neutrophil infiltration and activity (immunofluorescence staining and myeloperoxidase). Furthermore, the Western blot analysis revealed that 0.01% HCO decreased protein expression levels of tumor necrosis factor-α and IL-1β. CONCLUSIONS: According to our findings, 0.01% HCLO can kill A. fumigatus spores in vitro. It has antifungal and anti-inflammatory effects on A. fumigatus keratitis in rats. It also inhibited A. fumigatus growth; decreased neutrophil infiltration, tumor necrosis factor-α, and IL-1β expression; and provided a potential treatment for fungal keratitis.

METHODS: A total of 96 patients (96 eyes) with fungal keratitis were randomly divided into two groups: group Ι (conventional treatment + topical HOCI eye drops); The group II (conventional treatment). According to its severity, those patients were divided into grade Ι or grade II. Use of fungal scraping and culture to identify the type of fungal infection, slit lamp examination, and corneal fluorescein staining to observe regression, and confocal corneal microscopy to assess fungal mycelial changes. The main outcome measures were the success rate, healing time, visual recovery, and complications. The Kaplan-Meier curve method was used to analysis of the survival function of days to cure between the two groups. RESULTS: There were no statistical differences between the two groups in terms of general condition, medical history, and grading. Corneal scraping results showed that all patients had filamentous fungi. For grade Ι patients, all patients were cured, and the patients in Group I showed faster healing speed than that in Group II (t = -3.665, p < .01). For grade II patients, the recovery time (t = -4.121, p < .01) and the disappearance of hypopyon (t = -4.291, p < .01) were significantly faster in the combination group. In grade Ι and II patients, the final visual acuity and the incidence of complications such as corneal neovascularization, cataract, and hyphema showed no differences in both groups. The survival curve showed that the healing rate of ulcers in the combination treatment group was faster than that in the conventional treatment group (χ2 = 14.332, p = .001). CONCLUSION: HOCI can accelerate the healing of fungal keratitis without obvious complications, indicating a promising future in the field of keratitis treatment.",

      "abstract": "UNLABELLED: To eradicate bacterial pathogens, neutrophils are recruited to the sites of infection, where they engulf and kill microbes through the production of reactive oxygen and chlorine species (ROS/RCS). The most prominent RCS is antimicrobial oxidant hypochlorous acid (HOCl), which rapidly reacts with various amino acids side chains, including those containing sulfur and primary/tertiary amines, causing significant macromolecular damage. Pathogens like uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC), the primary causative agent of urinary tract infections (UTIs), have developed sophisticated defense systems to protect themselves from HOCl. We recently identified the RcrR regulon as a novel HOCl defense strategy in UPEC. The regulon is controlled by the HOCl-sensing transcriptional repressor RcrR, which is oxidatively inactivated by HOCl resulting in the expression of its target genes, including rcrB . rcrB encodes the putative membrane protein RcrB, deletion of which substantially increases UPEC's susceptibility to HOCl. However, many questions regarding RcrB's role remain open including whether (i) the protein's mode of action requires additional help, (ii) rcrARB expression is induced by physiologically relevant oxidants other than HOCl, and (iii) expression of this defense system is limited to specific media and/or cultivation conditions. Here, we provide evidence that RcrB expression is sufficient to E. coli 's protection from HOCl and induced by and protects from several RCS but not from ROS. RcrB plays a protective role for RCS-stressed planktonic cells under various growth and cultivation conditions but appears to be irrelevant for UPEC's biofilm formation. IMPORTANCE: Bacterial infections pose an increasing threat to human health exacerbating the demand for alternative treatment options. UPEC, the most common etiological agent of urinary tract infections (UTIs), are confronted by neutrophilic attacks in the bladder, and must therefore be well equipped with powerful defense systems to fend off the toxic effects of RCS. How UPEC deal with the negative consequences of the oxidative burst in the neutrophil phagosome remains unclear. Our study sheds light on the requirements for the expression and protective effects of RcrB, which we recently identified as UPEC's most potent defense system towards HOCl-stress and phagocytosis. Thus, this novel HOCl-stress defense system could potentially serve as an attractive drug target to increase the body's own capacity to fight UTIs."

Accurate detection of HOCl with high sensitivity and selectivity is required to understand its activities in healthy bio-systems and diseases. By integrating acceptable design principles and dye screening methodologies, we proposed and developed a novel near-infrared fluorescent HOCl sensing probe (FNIR-HOCl). The FNIR-HOCl probe has a quick reaction rate, high sensitivity (LOD = 70 nM), and excellent selectivity toward HOCl over other metal ions and reactive oxygen species. It has been successfully implemented to detect endogenous HOCl produced by RAW264.7 cells, as well as in vivo imaging towards mice with osteoarthritis. As a result, the probe FNIR-HOCl is extremely promising as a biological tool for revealing the roles of HOCl in various physiological and pathological contexts.",

AIMS: To investigate both the effectiveness of anolyte for microbial bioburden reduction in debrided ulcer tissues and the population of resident S. aureus. METHODS: Fifty-one debrided tissues from 30 people with type II diabetes were aliquoted by wet weight and immersed in 1- or 10-mL volumes of anolyte (200 parts per million) or saline for 3 min. Microbial loads recovered were determined in colony forming units/g (cfu/g) of tissue following aerobic, anaerobic and staphylococcal-selective culture. Bacterial species were identified and 50 S. aureus isolates from 30 tissues underwent whole-genome sequencing (WGS). FINDINGS: The ulcers were predominantly superficial, lacking signs of infection (39/51, 76.5%). Of the 42/51 saline-treated tissues yielding ≥105 cfu/g, a microbial threshold reported to impede wound-healing, only 4/42 (9.5%) were clinically diagnosed DFUIs. Microbial loads from anolyte-treated tissues were significantly lower than saline-treated tissues using 1 mL (1065-fold, 2.0 log) and 10 mL (8216-fold, 2.1 log) immersion volumes (P<0.0005). S. aureus was the predominant species recovered (44/51, 86.3%) and 50 isolates underwent WGS. All were meticillin susceptible and comprised 12 sequence types (STs), predominantly ST1, ST5 and ST15. Whole-genome multi-locus sequence typing identified three clusters of closely related isolates from 10 patients indicating inter-patient transmission. CONCLUSIONS: Short immersions of debrided ulcer tissue in anolyte significantly reduced microbial bioburden: a potential novel DFUI treatment.",

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty pulp tissue samples were standardized to a weight of 9 mg and divided into four groups according to the irrigating solution used: 5.25% NaOCl, 500 ppm hypochlorous acid, 200 ppm hypochlorous acid, and distilled water. Eppendorf tubes carrying 2 mL of the irrigants were taken and the pulp tissue samples were placed in the tubes for the specified time interval: Subgroup A: 30 minutes and subgroup B: 60 minutes. After the designated time interval, the solution from each sample tube was filtered using Whatman filter paper and left for drying overnight. The residual weight was calculated by filtration method. The mean dissolution time for each experimental group at the different time intervals was statistically analyzed. RESULTS: Mean tissue dissolution increases with an increase in the time period. Approximately 5.25% NaOCl was most effective at both time intervals followed by 500-ppm hypochlorous acid at 60 minutes. Least amount of tissue dissolution was shown by 200-ppm of hypochlorous acid at 30 minutes. Distilled water did not show the ability to dissolve human pulp tissue. CONCLUSION: Within the limitations of the study, 5.25% NaOCl dissolved the pulp tissue most efficiently at both time intervals and both concentrations. Human pulp tissue dissolution by hypochlorous acid was found to gradually increase with time and with an increase in its concentration. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: With the basic information that hypochlorous acid does have the capacity to dissolve human pulp tissue, further research can be undertaken to assess methods to increase its efficiency. Sooner than later, hypochlorous acid may be able to completely replace the toxic NaOCl in clinical practice, as the irrigant of choice during root canal therapy.",

      "abstract": "One of the main problems in oral implantology today is peri-implantitis, which affects almost 20% of dental implants placed in patients. One of the most commonly used techniques to eliminate bacterial biofilm is the implantoplasty, that consists of the mechanical modification of the implant surface topography followed by treatments with chemical reagents for decontamination. In this study, the main aim is to evaluate the use of two different chemical treatments based on hypochlorous acid (HClO) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). For this purpose, 75 titanium grade 3 discs were treated with implantoplasty according to established protocols. Twenty-five discs were used as controls, 25 were treated with concentrated HClO and 25 were treated with concentrated HClO followed by treatment with 6% H2O2. The roughness of the discs was determined using the interferometric process. Cytotoxicity with SaOs-2 osteoblastic cells was quantified at 24 and 72 h, whereas bacteria proliferation using S. gordonii and S. oralis bacteria was quantified at 5 s and 1 min of treatment. The results showed an increase in the roughness values, the control discs had an Ra of 0.33 μm and those treated with HClO and H2O2 reached 0.68 μm. Cytotoxicity was present at 72 h, together with a significant proliferation of bacteria. These biological and microbiological results can be attributed to the roughness produced by the chemical agents that triggered bacterial adsorption while inhibiting osteoblast adhesion. The results indicate that even if this treatment can decontaminate the titanium surface after implantation, the produced topography will generate an environment that will not favor long-term performance."

Under exposure to high levels of HOCl, the released MB from UCNPs-LMB/VQIVYK will produce singlet oxygen (1O2) under red light to depolymerize Aβ aggregation and reduce cytotoxicity. Meanwhile, UCNPs-LMB/VQIVYK can act as an inhibitor to decrease Tau-induced neurotoxicity. Besides, UCNPs-LMB/VQIVYK can be used for upconversion luminescence (UCL) due to its unexceptionable luminescence properties. This HOCl-responsive nanosystem offers a new therapy for AD treatment."

An experimental non-randomised study was carried out, treating 346 chronic ulcers in 220 patients. The antiseptic treatment has been divided into 'hypochlorous acid' (Clortech), 'hypochlorous acid liquid + gel' (Clortech + Microdacyn60R -hydrogel) and 'Others' (Prontosan or Chlorhexidine or Microdacyn60R -hydrogel). Bivariate and multivariate studies analysed the characteristics of the patients and their ulcers, including size, symptoms, signs, treatments received and their duration, and so on. The ulcers were complicated, of long evolution, and most had a vascular origin. On average, antiseptic treatment lasted 14 weeks. At the time of their discharge, or last treatment in the clinics, 59% of the ulcers had healed completely, 9.5% worsened, and 6.9% had become infected during this period. In the bivariate and multivariate studies, we took as reference the 'others' treatments that showed no significant differences in healing time or infection rates compared with liquid hypochlorous acid 100-500 mg/L alone. However, hypochlorous acid liquid + gel showed a synergistic effect, with a higher probability of achieving complete healing (four times) and a lower probability of infection (a fifth), compared to the 'other' antiseptics. In conclusion, a synergistic effect was found with the successive application of hypochlorous acid in liquid followed by gel, an effect that increased healing probability and decreased the risk of the ulcer becoming infected.",

The production of HOCl eliminates a wide range of pathogens. However, HOCl can also cause significant oxidative damage in cells and tissues where it is generated. The protective effect of curcumin was studied on HOCl-induced oxidative damage to human red blood cells (RBC). Isolated RBC were incubated with HOCl at 37 °C in absence or presence of different concentrations of curcumin. Hemolysates were prepared and assayed for various biochemical parameters. Treatment of RBC with HOCl alone increased hemolysis, protein carbonyls, heme degradation and chloramines as compared to untreated control cells. This was accompanied by reduction in glutathione level, total sulfhydryls and free amino groups. HOCl also lowered the activities of major antioxidant enzymes and diminished the antioxidant power of RBC. Pre-treatment of RBC with different concentrations of curcumin resulted in concentration-dependent attenuation in all these parameters while curcumin alone had no significant effect. Scanning electron microscopy showed that curcumin prevented HOCl-induced morphological changes in RBC and restored their normal biconcave shape. Thus curcumin can be used as a chemoprotective agent to mitigate HOCl-induced oxidative damage to cells. These results also explain the beneficial effects of curcumin against Helicobacter pylori induced stomach ulcers, caused by excessive production of HOCl at the site of bacterial infection.",

Treatment with topical antibiotics is oftentimes ineffective as a result of antibiotic-resistant microorganisms and biofilm-specific antibiotic tolerance. Use of biocides such as hypochlorous acid (HOCl) has gained increasing attention due to the lack of known resistance mechanisms. We designed an HOCl-generating electrochemical bandage (e-bandage) that delivers HOCl continuously at low concentrations targeting infected wound beds in a similar manner to adhesive antimicrobial wound dressings. We developed a battery-operated wearable potentiostat that controls the e-bandage electrodes at potentials suitable for HOCl generation. We demonstrated that e-bandage treatment was tunable by changing the applied potential. HOCl generation on electrode surfaces was verified using microelectrodes. The developed e-bandage showed time-dependent responses against in vitro Acinetobacter baumannii and Staphylococcus aureus biofilms, reducing viable cells to non-detectable levels within 6 and 12 hours of treatment, respectively. The developed e-bandage should be further evaluated as an alternative to topical antibiotics to treat wound biofilm infections."

DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial. METHODS: Patients with blepharitis were randomized into two groups: topical 0.01% HOCL through ultrasonic atomization (HOCL group, 42 eyes) or eyelid scrubs (control group, 37 eyes). Patients in both groups received warm compresses twice daily and topical 0.5% levofloxacin three times a day. Primary outcomes were the ocular surface disease index scores (OSDI), lid margin redness, lid margin abnormalities, meibum expressibility, meibum quality, and noninvasive breakup time after 2 weeks. Secondary outcomes were conjunctiva redness, corneal fluorescein staining, and tear meniscus height. A questionnaire of treatment adherence with a free response section was administered to confirm patient compliance and comments. RESULTS: Sixty-seven participants participated in this study. Both groups show an improvement in all primary outcomes, while statistically significant improvements in OSDI, lid margin redness, lid margin abnormality, meibum expressibility and quality are only limited to the HOCL group after 2 weeks of treatment (p < 0.05, p < 0.05, p < 0.001, p < 0.001 and p < 0.001, respectively). Subgroup analysis in HOCL reveals that only the change in lid margin abnormality and meibum expressibility in the mild-moderate meibomian glands loss patients at baseline has a statistically significant difference p < 0.05). Multiple linear regression shows that the improvement in OSDI is negatively associated with meibum expressibility score at the baseline (95% CI [-28.846, -1.815], p = 0.028). The patient compliance is 7.1 ± 2.0 in the HOCL group and 7.1 ± 1.8 in the control group (p > 0.05). No adverse events are reported. CONCLUSION: Topical 0.01% HOCL through ultrasonic atomization is a tolerable and effective eyelid hygiene treatment for blepharitis."

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate hypochlorous acid as an ear flushing and antimicrobial agent in dogs with chronic OE. ANIMALS: Twenty dogs with chronic OE caused by the same organisms bilaterally. MATERIALS AND METHODS: One ear was flushed under anaesthesia with hypochlorous acid, the other with saline solution. Subsequently, the ear flushed with hypochlorous acid was cleaned with the same solution twice daily for 2 weeks, the other ear with a commercial ear cleaner. An ear medication containing miconazole, polymyxin B and prednisolone was used once daily in both ears. Clinical scores were determined before the flush. Ear cytological results were obtained, a hearing test was conducted before and after the ear flush, and a culture was taken directly after flushing. Ears were evaluated after 2 weeks of therapy. RESULTS: Yeast was present in the ears of 11, cocci in one and a mixed infection in eight dogs. Five ears were negative on culture after flushing with hypochlorous acid, one after the saline flush. Clinical and cytological scores decreased significantly with both solutions after 2 weeks of treatment. There was no difference between treatments in any of the scores at any time point between treatments and in the results of the hearing test before and after the flushing procedure.

      "abstract": "This study involves isothermal kinetic simulation to evaluate the parameters of inhibition conditions for Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) of high-risk pathogens. This is because the new type of the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is continuously spreading and the importance of public health issues. Environmental disinfection and personal wearing of masks have become important epidemic prevention measures. Selection of concentration kinetics could be estimated best for E. coli and S. aureus of pathogens, 2.74 × 104 and 105 and 2.44 × 104 and 105 colony-forming units (CFU mL-1), by isothermal micro-calorimeter (TAM Air) tests, respectively. Comparisons were made of different doses of 0-70 ppm (in 20 mL test ampoule) hypochlorous acid treatment for conducting nth-order and autocatalytic reaction simulation to evaluate the inhibition reaction parameters, which determined the autocatalytic kinetic model that was beneficially applied on the E. coli and S. aureus. We developed the inhibition reaction parameters of the pathogens, which included the activation energy (E a), the natural logarithm of pre-exponential factor (lnk 0), the enthalpy of inhibition microbial growth reaction (∆H), inhibition microbial growth, and the inhibition growth analysis. Overall, we conducted isothermal kinetic simulation to understand the antimicrobial activity effects of electrolytically generated hypochlorous acid-treated pathogenic microorganisms, which will provide reference for public health and medical-related fields for SDG3, and can contribute to ensuring human health and hygiene."

      "abstract": "The aims of this study were as follows. First, we determined the antimicrobial efficacy of hypochlorous acid (HClO) against bacterial, fungal, and yeast strains growing planktonically and growing in biofilms. Second, we sought to compare the activity of the combination of daptomycin and HClO versus those of the antimicrobial agents alone for the treatment of experimental catheter-related Staphylococcus epidermidis infection (CRI) using the antibiotic lock technique (ALT) in a rabbit model. HClO was generated through direct electric current (DC) shots at determined amperages and times. For planktonic susceptibility studies, 1 to 3 DC shots of 2, 5, and 10 mA from 0 to 300 s were applied. A DC shot of 20 mA from 0 to 20 min was applied to biofilm-producing strains. Central venous catheters were inserted into New Zealand White rabbits, inoculated with an S. epidermidis strain, and treated with saline solution or ALT using daptomycin (50 mg/mL), HClO (20 mA for 45 min), or daptomycin plus HClO. One hundred percent of the planktonic bacterial, fungal, and yeast strains were killed by applying one DC shot of 2, 5, and 10 mA, respectively. One DC shot of 20 mA for 20 min was sufficient to eradicate 100% of the tested biofilm-producing strains. Daptomycin plus HClO lock therapy showed the highest activity for experimental CRI with S. epidermidis. HClO could be an effective strategy for treating infections caused by extensively drug-resistant or multidrug-resistant and biofilm-producing strains in medical devices and chronic wounds. The results of the ALT using daptomycin plus HClO may be promising. IMPORTANCE Currently, drug-resistant infections are increasing and there are fewer antibiotics available to treat them. Therefore, there is an urgent need to find new antibiotics and nonantimicrobial strategies to treat these infections. We present a new nonantibiotic strategy based on hypochlorous acid generation to treat long-term catheter-related and chronic wounds infections.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Caries and periodontitis are amongst the most prevalent diseases worldwide, leading to pain and loss of oral function for those affected. Prevention relies heavily on mechanical removal of dental plaque biofilms but for populations where this is not achievable, alternative plaque control methods are required. With concerns over undesirable side-effects and potential bacterial resistance due to the use of chlorhexidine gluconate (CHX), new antimicrobial substances for oral use are greatly needed. Here we have investigated the antimicrobial effect of hypochlorous acid (HOCl), stabilized with acetic acid (HAc), on oral biofilms and compared it to that of CHX. Possible adverse effects of stabilized HOCl on hydroxyapatite surfaces were also examined. METHODS: Single- and mixed-species biofilms of six common oral bacteria (Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus gordonii, Actinomyces odontolyticus, Veillonella parvula, Parvimonas micra and Porphyromonas gingivalis) within a flow-cell model were exposed to HOCl stabilized with 0.14% or 2% HAc, pH 4.6, as well as HOCl or HAc alone. Biofilm viability was assessed in situ using confocal laser scanning microscopy following LIVE/DEAD® BacLight™ staining. In-situ quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation (QCM-D) was used to study erosion of hydroxyapatite (HA) surfaces by stabilized HOCl. RESULTS: Low concentrations of HOCl (5 ppm), stabilized with 0.14% or 2% HAc, significantly reduced viability in multi-species biofilms representing supra- and sub-gingival oral communities, after 5 min, without causing erosion of HA surfaces. No equivalent antimicrobial effect was seen for CHX. Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria showed no significant differential suceptibility to stabilized HOCl. CONCLUSIONS: At low concentrations and with exposure times which could be achieved through oral rinsing, HOCl stabilized with HAc had a robust antimicrobial activity on oral biofilms, without causing erosion of HA surfaces or affecting viability of oral keratinocytes. This substance thus appears to offer potential for prevention and/or treatment of oral biofilm-mediated diseases.",

      "abstract": "Previously, an electrochemical bandage (e-bandage) that uses a three-electrode system to produce hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) electrochemically on its working electrode was developed as a potential strategy for treating biofilms; it showed activity in reducing biofilms in an agar biofilm model. Xanthan gum-based hydrogel, including NaCl, was used as the electrolyte. While H2O2 generated at the working electrode in the vicinity of a biofilm is a main mechanism of activity, the role of the counter electrode was not explored. The goal of this research was to characterize electrochemical reactions occurring on the counter electrode of the e-bandage. Counter electrode potential varied between 1.2 and 1.5 VAg/AgCl; ∼125 µM hypochlorous acid (HOCl) was generated within 24 h in the e-bandage system. When HOCl was not produced on the counter electrode (achieved by removing NaCl from the hydrogel), reduction of Acinetobacter baumannii BAA-1605 biofilm was 1.08 ± 0.38 log10 CFU/cm2 after 24 h treatment, whereas when HOCl was produced, reduction was 3.87 ± 1.44 log10 CFU/cm2. HOCl inhibited catalase activity, abrogating H2O2 decomposition. In addition to H2O2 generation, the previously described H2O2-generating e-bandage generates HOCl on the counter electrode, enhancing its biocidal activity.",

This work has investigated the kinetics and mechanism of the reaction between H2O2 and HOCl. The kinetics study showed the species-specific second order rate constants for HOCl with H2O2 (k1), HOCl with HO2- (k2) and OCl- with H2O2 (k3) are 195.5 ± 3.3 M-1s-1, 4.0 × 107 M-1s-1 and 3.5 × 103 M-1s-1, respectively. The density functional theory calculation showed k2 is the most advantageous thermodynamically pathway because it does not need to overcome a high energy barrier. The yields of 1O2 generation from the reaction of H2O2 with HOCl were reinvestigated by using furfuryl alcohol (FFA) as a probe, and an average of 92.3% of 1O2 yields was obtained at pH 7-12. The second order rate constants of the reaction of 1O2 with 13 phenolates were determined by using the H2O2/HOCl system as a quantitative 1O2 production source. To establish a quantitative structure activity relationship, quantum chemical descriptors were more satisfactory than empirical Hammett constants. The potential implications in electrochemical oxidative water treatment were discussed at the end.",

Meanwhile, existing treatment of depression is dominated by antidepressants, which produce troublesome side effects and usually require months to achieve effect. Therefore, more reliable diagnostic criteria and effective therapy are urgently needed. Some core hallmarks in the etiology of depression have been established, including declined neurotransmitters and inflammatory responses, manifesting in oxidative stress. Thus, we fabricated a HClO-triggered multifunctional fluorescence platform (MB-Rs) for simultaneous neurotransmitter/antidepressant delivery and efficacy evaluation. In MB-Rs, although a urea linkage could be specifically cut off by HClO, methylene blue (MB) endowed with excellent anti-inflammatory and optical properties was covalently linked with neurotransmitters (dopamine or 5-hydroxytryptamine) or antidepressants (fluoxetine). Encountering excess HClO in the brain of mice with depression, MB-Rs released corresponding antidepressants and MB with anti-inflammatory and bright fluorescence. By relieving oxidative stress, inflammation, and coinstantaneous increasing neurotransmitters, MB-Rs elicited better antidepressant response and fewer side effects compared with clinical antidepressants. Furthermore, MB-Rs successfully evaluated the efficacy of antidepressants in mice based on HClO-induced fluorescence. Therefore, this work provides a promising platform for depression diagnosis and treatment.",

A study was conducted to assess whether the use of hypochlorous acid preserved wound cleanser (HAPWOC) (Vashe, Urgo Medical North America, Fort Worth, TX, USA) as the irrigant would reduce the cost of care in comparison to 0.9% saline (NaCl). Method A comparative, observational, retrospective analysis assessed 27 serious and infected wounds in 24 patients. The lesions were of different and complex etiologies, including necrotizing fasciitis and stage IV diabetic foot ulcers. NPWT was used as part of the overall multimodal treatment regimen. The only variance in the treatment protocol was the use of saline (N=8) or HAPWOC (N=19) as the irrigant. Results When compared to NaCl, wounds treated with HAPWOC trended toward fewer operating room (OR) visits versus NaCl (3.3 versus 4.1) and a shorter length of hospital stay (LOS) (24.3 days versus 37.9 days). The Orlando Health Transparency guide shows the cost of OR debridement as $2,525. Thus, debridement for HAPWOC-treated wounds ($8,332) costs $2,020 (24%) less than for NaCl-treated wounds ($10,352). Using the 2016 Kaiser Health data (average daily hospital cost, excludingall interventions: $2,052), the cost of HAPWOC and NaCl instill translates to $49,864 and $77,771, respectively, a difference of $27,906 (56%) more for NaCl treatment. The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) 2012 data indicate an average daily cost of hospital stay, including all interventions, of $10,400. Thus, HAPWOC treatment cost translates to $252,720 versus NaCl-related costs of $394,160; in these calculations, using NaCl costs $141.440 (+56%) more per patient than HAPWOC. Conclusion The use of NPWT with HAPWOC versus NaCl as instillation in NPWT reduces the number of visits to the operating room and LOS. This has a significant impact on lowering the cost of care when HAPWOC is used."

Naringin (NR) is a flavonoid with antineoplastic and anti-inflammatory effects. Here, we aimed to investigate the antifibrotic effects of NR and underlying mechanisms in a Hypochlorous acid (HOCl)-induced mouse model of skin fibrosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 24 six-week-old female BALB/c mice were randomly allocated into five groups: HOCl, Sham, PBS, HOCl + NR and DMSO and selected skin regions were treated for 6 weeks, until sacrifice. The histopathologic and collagenesis of skin resections were analyzed using H&E and PR staining. The mRNA levels of COL1, COL3 and αSMA genes were quantified. Serum samples were also used to evaluate TGF-β levels and LDH activity. RESULTS: HOCl could increase the relative collagen content, while NR administration on HOCl-treated biopsies decreased collagenesis. COL1, COL3 and αSMA mRNA levels were significantly increased among HOCl-treated skin samples, while NR treatment could decrease these mRNA levels of genes to the extent equal to the levels in the Sham group. Similarly, Naringin-treated samples could decrease TGF-β levels. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated that Naringin could exert protective effects against fibrotic complications of HOCL in skin tissue in vivo, by reducing the collagenesis and decreasing the levels of fibrosis-associated genes.",

Stabilized hypochlorous acid/control (sterile 0.9% NaCl) solutions were assigned to either wound by randomization. Wounds were irrigated and treated on days 0, 2 and 4. Re-epithelialization was assessed blindly by digital planimetry, and bacterial growth was assessed as the number of colony-forming units cultured from surface swabs. Hypochlorous acid solution increased the degree of re-epithelialization on day 4 by 14% compared with the control solution (95% confidence interval (CI) 6.8-20%, p = 0.00051) and was not inferior (p < 0.0001) to the control solution on day 10 (0.3%, 95% CI -1.3-1.9%). Median bacterial counts were lower with stabilized hypochlorous acid compared with control and were further reduced after irrigation and treatment of both groups on day 4, but remained lower in the stabilized hypochlorous acid group compared with the control group.

      "abstract": "The development of effective bioanalytical methods for the visualization of hypochlorous acid (HOCl) in situ in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) directly contributes to better understanding the roles of HOCl in this disease. In this work, a new quinoline-based fluorescence probe (HQ) has been developed for the detection and visualization of a HOCl-mediated inflammatory response in a RA model. HQ possesses a donor-π-acceptor (D-π-A) structure that was designed by conjugating p-hydroxybenzaldehyde (electron donor) and 1-ethyl-4-methylquinolinium iodide (electron acceptor) through a C[double bond, length as m-dash]C double bond. In the presence of HOCl, oxidation of phenol to benzoquinone led to the red-shift (93 nm) of the adsorption and intense quenching of the fluorescence emission. The proposed response reaction mechanism was verified by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and high-resolution mass spectroscopy (HRMS) titration analysis. The remarkable color changes of the HQ solution from pale yellow to pink enabled the application of HQ-stained chromatography plates for the \"naked-eye\" detection of HOCl in real-world water samples. HQ featured high selectivity and sensitivity (6.5 nM), fast response time (<25 s) to HOCl, reliability at different pH (3.0 to 11.5) and low cytotoxicity. HQ's application in biological systems was then demonstrated by the monitoring of HOCl-mediated treatment response to RA. This work thus provided a new tool for the detection and imaging of HOCl in inflammatory disorders."

      "abstract": "Compensatory angiogenesis is an important adaptation for recovery from critical ischemia. We recently identified 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (20-HETE) as a novel contributor of ischemia-induced angiogenesis. However, the precise mechanisms by which ischemia promotes 20-HETE increases that drive angiogenesis are unknown. This study aims to address the hypothesis that inflammatory neutrophil-derived myeloperoxidase (MPO) and hypochlorous acid (HOCl) critically contribute to 20-HETE increases leading to ischemic angiogenesis. Using Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry/Mass Spectrometry, Laser Doppler Perfusion Imaging, and Microvascular Density analysis, we found that neutrophil depletion and MPO knockout mitigate angiogenesis and 20-HETE production in the gracilis muscles of mice subjected to hindlimb ischemia. Furthermore, we found MPO and HOCl to be elevated in these tissues postischemia as assessed by immunofluorescence microscopy and in vivo live imaging of HOCl. Next, we demonstrated that the additions of either HOCl or an enzymatic system for generating HOCl to endothelial cells increase the expression of CYP4A11 and its product, 20-HETE. Finally, pharmacological interference of hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) signaling results in ablation of HOCl-induced CYP4A11 transcript and significant reductions in CYP4A11 protein. Collectively, we conclude that neutrophil-derived MPO and its product HOCl activate HIF-1α and CYP4A11 leading to increased 20-HETE production that drives postischemic compensatory angiogenesis. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Traditionally, neutrophil derived MPO and HOCl are exclusively associated in the innate immunity as potent bactericidal/virucidal factors. The present study establishes a novel paradigm by proposing a unique function for MPO/HOCl as signaling agents that drive critical physiological angiogenesis by activating the CYP4A11-20-HETE signaling axis via a HIF-1α-dependent mechanism. The findings from this study potentially identify novel therapeutic targets for the treatment of ischemia and other diseases associated with abnormal angiogenesis.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The aims of our experiment were to compare the microorganisms in meibomian gland secretions from patients with internal hordeolum before and after treatment using hypochlorous acid eyelid wipes, to elucidate the mechanism underlying hypochlorous acid eyelid wipe treatment of internal hordeolum. METHODS: This was a prospective, matched-pair study. A total of eight patients with internal hordeolum who attended the ophthalmology clinic of our hospital from April to August 2020 were included. Meibomian gland secretions were collected from subjects before treatment (Group A) and from patients cured after eyelid cleaning with hypochlorous acid eyelid wipes for 7 days (Group B). Samples were submitted to 16S rRNA high-throughput sequencing, and the resulting data were analyzed to compare the differences in the structure and composition of meibomian gland secretion microbial flora before and after treatment of internal hordeolum. RESULTS: A total of 2127 operational taxonomic units were obtained from the two groups of samples, and there was no significant difference in alpha diversity before and after eyelid cleaning. At the phylum level, there was no significant difference between the two groups. The predominant phyla in Group A included the following: Firmicutes (32.78% ± 20.16%), Proteobacteria (26.73% ± 7.49%), Acidobacteria (10.58% ± 11.45%), Bacteroidetes (9.05% ± 6.63%), Actinobacteria (8.48% ±1.77%), and Chloroflexi (3.15% ± 3.12%), while those in Group B were the following: Proteobacteria (31.86% ± 9.69%), Firmicutes (29.07% ± 24.20%), Acidobacteria (11.33% ± 7.53%), Actinobacteria (7.10% ± 1.98%), Bacteroidetes (5.39% ± 5.17%), and Chloroflexi (3.89% ± 3.67%). Starting from the class level, significant differences in microbial communities were detected before and after eyelid cleaning (P < 0.05). Linear discriminant analysis effect size analysis showed the core flora in Group A microbiome comprising Actinobacteria, Staphylococcus, Staphylococcaceae, Staphylococcus aureus, Ruminococcacea UCg-014, Ruminococcacea-UCG-014, Halomonadaceae, Neisseria, Methylobacterium, Frankiales, and Neisseria sicca, while those in Group B microbial were Streptococcus sp., Blautia, Bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum, Subdoligranulum, Subdoligranulum variabile, Faecalibacterium, and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii. CONCLUSION: Eyelid cleaning with hypochlorous acid eyelid wipes does not change the biodiversity in the meibomian gland secretions of patients with internal hordeolum. Hypochlorous acid eyelid wipes may affect the internal hordeolum through broad-spectrum antibacterial action to effectively reduce the relative abundance of symbiotic pathogens, such as Staphylococcus, Neisseria, Actinomycetes, and Ruminococcus and increase that of Faecalibacterium prausnitzii and other symbiotic probiotics with anti-inflammatory effects.",

The conditions in which cells are cultured and treated impact CDS, and cellular insults alter their composition and function. In this study, we generated CDS from tumor cells exposed to normal culture conditions, hypoxia, cisplatin, radiotherapy, photodynamic therapy, or hypochlorous acid (HOCl). In vitro HOCl-CDS showed the strongest stimulatory effects on dendritic cells and macrophages compared to CDS generated by hypoxia, cisplatin, radiotherapy or photodynamic therapy. To improve HOCl-CDS activity at the tumor site, we loaded HOCl-CDS into a melittin-encapsulated hydrogel scaffold. When injected intratumorally, the HOCl-CDS hydrogel promoted tumor cell death, cytotoxic T lymphocyte infiltration, and tumor-associated macrophage reprogramming towards an M1 phenotype. The hydrogel inhibited tumor growth and prolonged the survival of mice bearing B16-F10 melanoma. Furthermore, hydrogel-delivered HOCl-CDS augmented the antitumor effects of immune checkpoint blockade. These results underscore the importance of the CDS generation method and delivery approach for improving cancer immunotherapy."

A recent clinical study compared hypochlorous acid preserved wound cleanser (HAPWOC) to saline and found HAPWOC to be a more effective adjunct to low frequency ultrasound debridement. However, HAPWOC has an added cost. The primary objective of this study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of HAPWOC as an irrigation modality with low-frequency ultrasound debridement for the treatment of severely complex wounds that were destined to be closed primarily via a flap. The secondary objective of this study was to estimate the number needed to treat (NNT) to avoid a wound-related complication and its expected cost per NNT. Methods: A patient-level Monte-Carlo simulation model was used to conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis from the US health system perspective. All clinical data were obtained from a prospective clinical trial. Cost data were obtained from the publicly available data sources in 2021 US dollars. The effect measure was the avoidance of wound-related complications at 14-days post-debridement. The primary outcome was the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), a measure of the additional cost per benefit. The secondary outcomes were the NNT and expected cost per NNT to avoid one complication (complementary to the ICER in assessing cost-effectiveness). Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses (PSA) were performed to gauge the robustness and reliability of the results. Results: The ICER for HAPWOC versus saline irrigation was US$90.85 per wound complication avoided. The expected incremental cost per patient in the study and effect was US$49.97 with 55% relative reduction in wound-related complications at day 14 post debridement procedure. The NNT and cost per NNT were 2 and US$99.94, respectively. Sensitivity analyses demonstrated that these results were robust to variation in model parameters. Conclusion: HAPWOC was a cost-effective strategy for the treatment of complex wounds during ultrasonic debridement. For every two patients treated with HAPWOC, one complication was avoided."

However, owing to the unknown etiology and rapid progression of the disease, the diagnosis of ALI is full of challenges with no effective treatment. Since the inflammatory response and oxidative stress played vital roles in the development of ALI, we herein developed the largest emission cross-shift (△λ = 145 nm) two-photon ratiometric fluorescent probe of TPRS-HOCl with high selectivity and short response time toward hypochlorous acid (HOCl) for exploring the relevance between the degree of ALI and HOCl concentration in the development process of the disease. In addition, the inhibition effect of HOCl during different treatment periods was also evaluated. Moreover, the tendency of imaging results was basically in accordance with that of hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining and the treatment effect became better in the early stage when using N-acetylcysteine (NAC), demonstrating the sensitivity of TPRS-HOCl toward ALI response. Thus, TPRS-HOCl has great potential to diagnose ALI in the early stage and guide for effective treatment.",

      "abstract": "Central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI) contributes to mortality and cost. While aseptic dressings and antibiotic-impregnated catheters prevent some extraluminal infections, intraluminal infections remain a source of CLABSIs. In this proof-of-concept study, an electrochemical intravascular catheter (e-catheter) prototype capable of electrochemically generating hypochlorous acid intraluminally using platinum electrodes polarized at a constant potential of 1.5 electrode potential relative to saturated silver/silver chloride reference electrode measured in volts (VAg/AgCl) was developed. After 24 h of prepolarization at 1.5 VAg/AgCl, their activity was tested against clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecium, and Escherichia coli derived from catheter-related infections. e-catheters generated a mean HOCl concentration of 15.86 ± 4.03 μM and had a mean pH of 6.14 ± 0.79. E-catheters prevented infections of all four species, with an average reduction of 8.41 ± 0.61 log10 CFU/ml at 48 h compared to controls. Polarized e-catheters which generate low amounts of HOCl continuously should be further developed to prevent intraluminal infection. IMPORTANCE Catheter-related infections constitute an economic and mortality burden in health care. Several options are available to reduce the risk of infection, but only a few focus on preventing intraluminal infection, which occurs in long-term catheters, most often used for dialysis, prolonged treatment, or chemotherapy. A prototype of a catheter called an \"e-catheter\" composed of three electrodes, capable of producing hypochlorous acid (HOCl) electrochemically in its lumen, was developed. When polarized at 1.5 V, chloride ions in the solution are oxidized to continuously produce low amounts of HOCl, which exhibits antibacterial activity in the lumen of the catheter. Here, this prototype was shown to be able to generate HOCl as well as prevent infection in a preliminary in vitro catheter model. This approach is a potential strategy for catheter infection prevention.",

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Patients with chronic rhinosinusitis who had received FESS for treatment were recruited and assigned to one of two groups at random at one month post-surgery. In the HOCl group, patients received 0.02% HOCl nasal spray three times a day for two months. In the control group, normal saline (NS) nasal irrigation was given. Before FESS and before and after nasal spray or irrigation, patients completed the Taiwanese version of the 22-item Sino-Nasal Outcome Test (TWSNOT-22). In addition, patients received endoscopic examination, acoustic rhinometry, smell test, saccharine transit test, and bacterial cultures obtained from their middle meatus. RESULTS: Seventy-eight patients completed the study. Among them, 41 received HOCl nasal spray, and 37 received NS irrigation. Endoscopic score significantly decreased after 2-month HOCl nasal spray (p = 0.036). TWSNOT-22 score also decreased, although insignificantly (p = 0.285). In contrast, TWSNOT-22 score significantly decreased after NS nasal irrigation (p = 0.017), but endoscopic score did not significantly decrease (p = 0.142). CONCLUSIONS: Our results showed that HOCl nasal spray had a similar effect to that of NS nasal irrigation in post-FESS care. It can be an alternative of NS nasal irrigation for its convenient application.",

The objective was to provide long-term evidence on the clinical performance and safety of AOS when used in association with the usual SoC in patients with stalled, hard-to-heal ulcers of various aetiologies. METHOD: As per the main study, wounds were formally assessed by the study lead at 28 days (±14 days, depending on patient attendance). Parameters assessed at fortnightly visits included area, depth and duration of ulcer; pain; wound bed preparation (WBP) score; and infection status. Wounds were managed in accordance with the SoC protocol. RESULTS: By T224, 35.5% (n=11) of wounds healed completely and 83.9% showed some types of improvement. All wounds were free of infection and colonisation, the WBP score improved (100% A1-A2 at T196), and pain scores fell. Use of AOS in combination with several types of dressing (SoC) for such a long period confirmed a good safety profile. CONCLUSION: This follow-up evaluation, coupled with the primary study, suggests that AOS might represent a valuable therapeutic addition for the management of hard-to-heal ulcers for long periods of treatment.

Five percent povidone iodine (PI) is an accepted antiseptic used for prophylaxis. Dilute 2.5% PI and 0.01% hypochlorous acid (HOCl) may be more patient comfortable and equally effective. PI at 5% and 2.5% were compared to HOCl against a battery of bacterial endophthalmitis isolates using corneoscleral tissue as a solid-phase medium to determine antiseptic efficacy. METHODS: Bacteria from 20 cases of endophthalmitis were tested for the elimination of growth against topical 5% PI, 2.5% PI, HOCl, and no antiseptic using donor corneoscleral tissue. The tissue was inoculated with 103 colony forming units of bacteria prior to a 3-minute contact time with the antiseptics, placed in liquid growth medium, and monitored for growth at three days. No growth indicated antiseptic treatment success. Differences were analyzed using Chi square (χ2). RESULTS: For 20 isolates, 5% PI was comparable to 2.5% PI for preventing bacteria growth (p=0.71), and both were more effective than HOCl (p=0.004). Estimated weighted comparison over a 27-year period indicated that for all bacterial groups, except Streptococcus viridans, 5% PI was equally effective to 2.5% PI for preventing bacterial growth (p=1.0). For Streptococcus viridans, 5% PI was more effective than 2.5% PI (p=0.0001). Both concentrations of PI were more effective than HOCl (p=0.00001). CONCLUSION: Five percent PI appears to be optimal as a prophylaxis prior to ocular surgery."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Wound cleansing is an important component of wound management. PURPOSE: This study was conducted to examine the effect of a wound management solution (WMS) containing hypochlorous acid (HOCl) on methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and healing when used in conjunction with debridement. METHODS: Nineteen (19) deep reticular dermal wounds (22 mm × 22 mm × 3 mm deep) were created on the paravertebral and thoracic areas of 3 female pigs using a specialized electrokeratome. Wounds were separated by at least 5 cm to 7 cm of unwounded skin and inoculated with MRSA. After 72 hours, all wounds were debrided with a curette and irrigated with either the WMS or sterile saline solution twice per day from day 0 to day 4. Wounds then were irrigated once a day until the completion of the study (day 11). Wound tissue specimens were taken using punch biopsy for microbiological and histological analysis on days 4, 8, and 11 post treatment. Percent of wound epithelialized, epithelial thickness (cell layers µm), white cell infiltrate (1 = absent, 2 = mild, 3 = moderate, 4 = marked, 5 = exuberant), and percent of granulation tissue formation were calculated and assessed. Microbiology and histology results were analyzed for significant differences between treatments and among assessment days using one-way analysis of variance and student t-tests. A P value ≤ .05 was considered significant. RESULTS: The WMS effected a bacterial reduction (P ≤ .05) of more than 2.74 ± 0.43 and 1.03 ± 0.22 Log CFU/g in all assessment days compared with baseline before and after debridement, respectively. Percent epithelialization was significantly different between treatments on day 8, only 78.3% and 67.8% for HOCl and saline, respectively (P ≤ .05). No significant differences between treatments were observed for epithelial thickness or granulation tissue formation. CONCLUSION: The combination of debridement and HOCl wound irrigation can significantly reduce MRSA contamination and facilitate the healing process compared to saline irrigation. Clinical studies are needed to confirm these results.",

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of HOCl nasal irrigation to reduce allergic rhinitis (AR) symptoms compared with saline nasal irrigation. METHODS: This was multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Initially, 139 patients with perennial AR were enrolled; however, 25 did not successfully complete the study. Patients were randomly assigned to the nasal irrigation with low-concentration HOCl (n = 55) or normal saline (n = 59) treatment groups for the 4-week study period. Participants completed the Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality of Life Questionnaire (RQLQ) at every visit (baseline, Weeks 2 and 4), and Total Nasal Symptom Score (TNSS) was determined before and after nasal irrigation every morning and evening. RESULTS: We found that RQLQ scores significantly decreased after 4 weeks in the HOCl and placebo groups, but the decrement of the RQLQ score was similar between the 2 groups. Additionally, TNSS improved in both groups between baseline and Week 4, whereas there were no significant differences in the change of TNSS between the 2 groups. The HOCl group did not show any clinical side effects related to nasal irrigation. CONCLUSION: Allergic symptoms significantly decreased with low-concentration HOCl nasal irrigation, without significant adverse events. However, HOCl showed no additional improvement in symptoms compared with saline nasal irrigation for patients with perennial AR.",

Wound irrigation solutions are used to debride wounds, removing cell debris and infecting microorganisms, therefore preventing infection. The aim of this study was to evaluate a Polihexanide (PHMB) based wound irrigation solution, Octenidine HCl based wound irrigation solution and electrolysed water based wound care solution for antibiofilm efficacy against Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and a multispecies biofilm in several models to gain a broad understanding of ability. The PHMB based wound irrigation solution demonstrated broad range antibiofilm efficacy against P. aeruginosa, S. aureus and the multispecies biofilm. The Octenidine HCl based wound irrigation solution and the electrolysed water based wound care solution demonstrated potent antibiofilm efficacy against S. aureus and to a lesser extent P. aeruginosa. Overall, less efficacy was observed in the drip flow bioreactor model for all 3 test solutions, which may be attributed to the continuous flow of nutrients during treatment, which may have diluted or washed away the solution. The data presented also highlights the importance of testing antibiofilm activity in a range of biofilm models and against different bacterial strains to get an overall representation of efficacy.",

      "abstract": "Hypochlorous acid (HOCl) is the active oxidizing principle underlying drinking water disinfection, also delivered by numerous skin disinfectants and released by standard swimming pool chemicals used on a global scale, a topic of particular relevance in the context of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. However, the cutaneous consequences of human exposure to HOCl remain largely unknown, posing a major public health concern. Here, for the first time, we have profiled the HOCl-induced stress response in reconstructed human epidermis and SKH-1 hairless mouse skin. In addition, we have investigated the molecular consequences of solar simulated ultraviolet (UV) radiation and HOCl combinations, a procedure mimicking co-exposure experienced for example by recreational swimmers exposed to both HOCl (pool disinfectant) and UV (solar radiation). First, gene expression elicited by acute topical HOCl exposure was profiled in organotypic human reconstructed epidermis. Next, co-exposure studies (combining topical HOCl and UV) performed in SKH-1 hairless mouse skin revealed that the HOCl-induced cutaneous stress response blocks redox and inflammatory gene expression elicited by subsequent acute UV exposure (Nos2, Ptgs2, Hmox1, Srxn1), a finding consistent with emerging clinical evidence in support of a therapeutic role of topical HOCl formulations for the suppression of inflammatory skin conditions (e.g. atopic dermatitis, psoriasis). Likewise, in AP-1 transgenic SKH-1 luciferase-reporter mice, topical HOCl suppressed UV-induced inflammatory signaling assessed by bioluminescent imaging and gene expression analysis. In the SKH-1 high-risk mouse model of UV-induced human keratinocytic skin cancer, topical HOCl blocked tumorigenic progression and inflammatory gene expression (Ptgs2, Il19, Tlr4), confirmed by immunohistochemical analysis including 3-chloro-tyrosine-epitopes. These data illuminate the molecular consequences of HOCl-exposure in cutaneous organotypic and murine models assessing inflammatory gene expression and modulation of UV-induced carcinogenesis. If translatable to human skin these observations provide novel insights on molecular consequences of chlorination stress relevant to environmental exposure and therapeutic intervention.",

Moderately stable (t1/2 ~ minutes) aqueous O2•- stocks were prepared by several approaches at pH>12 and either (a) added directly to aqueous free available chlorine (FAC; i.e., HOCl/OCl-) at circumneutral pH, or (b) premixed with alkaline FAC and then acidified to pH 7, to degrade various organic probe compounds via in situ generated HO• and RCS. Radical production was optimal at [HO2•/O2•-]0/[FAC]0 ~ 2, with ~0.8 mol HO• formed/mol FAC consumed, and HO• and RCS exposures reaching ~5×10-10 and ~10-9 M×s, respectively. Similar trends were observed in natural waters and organic matter-amended phosphate buffer containing up to 5 mgC/L of dissolved organic carbon. Direct formation of oxyhalides, trihalomethanes (THMs), and haloacetic acids (HAAs), was minimal, though THM and HAA formation was moderately enhanced during post-chlorination of O2•-/FAC-treated solutions. This process could provide a beneficial addition to the range of available AOPs due to its high radical exposures, simplicity, rapid time-scales, potential for on-site O2•- generation, and widespread accessibility of FAC and other reagents.",

The purpose of this study is to compare the antimicrobial effect of hypochlorous acid (HA) 0.01% with PI 5% applied topically to the ocular surface. METHODS: Swabs of the inferior conjunctiva and posterior lower eyelid margin of 40 patients were taken from both eyes and plated onto blood agar plates. One eye was treated with HA and the other with PI, and swabs were taken after 1-minute exposure. The eye treated with PI was rinsed with sterile saline and another swab was taken. Colony-forming units (CFUs) were recorded after 2 days. Patients rated the level of irritation after treatment in each eye. RESULTS: HA and PI both gave significant reduction in CFUs from baseline (P < .001 for HA and P = .002 for PI). The mean reduction in logCFU ± 95% CI was 0.850 ± 0.387 or greater for HA and 0.749 ± 0.385 or greater for PI; this was equivalent to a mean reduction of 7.1-fold or greater or 86% or greater (95% CI, 66%-94%) for HA and 5.6-fold or greater or 82% or greater (95% CI, 57%-93%) for PI. CFUs increased in 17 eyes after saline rinse. PI caused substantial irritation in 31 of the 40 participants, whereas no individuals had any irritation from topical HA. CONCLUSIONS: Both HA and PI were effective in reducing ocular bacterial load. Unlike PI, HA was not irritating to the eye. Saline rinse after topical PI may increase bacterial counts in some individuals."

      "abstract": "Acute wounds may require cleansing to reduce the risk of infection. Stabilized hypochlorous acid in acetic buffer (HOCl + buffer) is a novel wound irrigation solution with antimicrobial properties. We performed a first-in-man, prospective, open-label pilot study to document preliminary safety and performance in the treatment of acute wounds. The study enrolled 12 subjects scheduled for a split-skin graft transplantation, where the donor site was used as a model of an acute wound. The treatment time was 75 s, given on 6 occasions. A total of 7 adverse events were regarded as related to the treatment; all registered as pain during the procedure for 2 subjects. One subject had a wound infection at the donor site. The mean colony-forming unit (CFU) decreased by 41% after the treatment, and the mean epithelialization was 96% on both days 14 (standard deviation [SD] 8%) and 21 (SD 10%). The study provides preliminary support for the safety, well-tolerance, and efficacy of HOCl + buffer for acute wounds. The pain was frequent although resolved quickly. Excellent wound healing and satisfying antimicrobial properties were observed. A subsequent in vitro biofilm study also indicated good antimicrobial activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa with a 96% mean reduction of CFU, when used for a treatment duration of 15 min (P < .0001), and a 50% decrease for Staphylococcus aureus (P = .1010). Future larger studies are needed to evaluate the safety and performance of HOCl + buffer in acute wounds, including the promising antimicrobial effect by prolonged treatment on bacterial biofilms.",

The increased and sustained production of HOCl at inflammatory sites may lead to tissue injury and this process is believed to play an important role in the progression of several diseases like chronic inflammation, atherosclerosis and some types of cancers. We have examined the effect of HOCl on human red blood cells (RBCs) under in vitro conditions. Treatment of RBC with different concentrations of HOCl (0.05-2.5 mM) at 37°C resulted in decreased activities of major antioxidant enzymes while the antioxidant power of RBC was weakened, as shown by lowered metal-reducing and free radical quenching ability of HOCl treated cells. RBC plasma membrane redox system was also inhibited suggesting membrane damage. The enzymes of glucose metabolism were inhibited indicating deranged energy metabolism. Electron microscopic images showed gross morphological changes in HOCl treated RBC. These results show that HOCl causes major alterations in the cellular antioxidant defense system and inhibition of glycolytic pathways, which increase the susceptibility of RBC to oxidative damage."

      "abstract": "Tumors of the abdominal cavity, such as colorectal, pancreatic and ovarian cancer, frequently metastasize into the peritoneum. Large numbers of metastatic nodules hinder curative surgical resection, necessitating lavage with hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC). However, HIPEC not only causes severe side effects but also has limited therapeutic efficacy in various instances. At the same time, the age of immunotherapies such as biological agents, checkpoint‑ inhibitors or immune‑cell therapies, increasingly emphasizes the critical role of anticancer immunity in targeting malignancies. The present study investigated the ability of three types of long‑lived reactive species (oxidants) to inactivate cancer cells and potentially complement current HIPEC regimens, as well as to increase tumor cell expression of danger signals that stimulate innate immunity. The human abdominal cancer cell lines HT‑29, Panc‑01 and SK‑OV‑3 were exposed to different concentrations of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), hypochlorous acid (HOCl) and peroxynitrite (ONOO‑). Metabolic activity was measured, as well as determination of cell death and danger signal expression levels via flow cytometry and detection of intracellular oxidation via high‑content microscopy. Oxidation of tumor decreased intracellular levels of the antioxidant glutathione and induced oxidation in mitochondria, accompanied by a decrease in metabolic activity and an increase in regulated cell death. At similar concentrations, HOCl showed the most potent effects. Non‑malignant HaCaT keratinocytes were less affected, suggesting the approach to be selective to some extent. Pro‑immunogenic danger molecules were investigated by assessing the expression levels of calreticulin (CRT), and heat‑shock protein (HSP)70 and HSP90. CRT expression was greatest following HOCl and ONOO‑ treatment, whereas HOCl and H2O2 resulted in the greatest increase in HSP70 and HSP90 expression levels. These results suggested that HOCl may be a promising agent to complement current HIPEC regimens targeting peritoneal carcinomatosis.",

There is only observational evidence supporting the use of hypochlorous acid (HOCl) as a topical wound solution on VLU and some limited randomised evidence for the effect of a prescribed regimen of exercise. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The Factorial4VLU trial is a pragmatic, blinded, factorial randomised controlled trial, with 380 participants receiving either a prescribed exercise regimen compared with usual care and either active HOCl wound solution or placebo wound solution at each dressing change for up to 24 weeks. All participants will receive compression therapy. The primary outcome is the proportion of participants with healed VLU at 12 weeks after randomisation as adjudicated by blinded review of ulcer photographs. Secondary outcomes are proportion healed at 24 weeks, time to healing, estimated change in ulcer area, change in 2-Minute Walk Test, change in health-related quality of life, incidence of infection and incidence of all-cause adverse events. If either of the interventions shows a statistically significant positive difference on healing outcomes, cost-effectiveness will be modelled using a health service perspective. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The Factorial4VLU trial received ethical approval from the Northern B Health and Disability Ethics Committee. We plan to publish the results within 1 year of trial completion and will include the results on the trial registration page.

METHOD: Virucidal assays and intranasal and oral irritation tests were undertaken in accordance with relevant national and international guidance and methods. RESULTS: In pre-clinical tests, the AOS2020, showed > 99.8% virucidal efficacy in < 1 min against SARS-Cov-2. The safety profile testing on both the nasal and oral mucosa indicates that AOS2020 is non-irritant.

      "abstract": "Lysosome of phagocyte is the main site of hypochlorous acid (HClO) production, and HClO can be employed as the biomarker for the diagnosis and treatment evaluation of arthritis. In recent years, developing fluorescent probes for lysosomal HClO has attracted considerable attention, but most of them still have some defects, such as autofluorescence, phototoxicity and photobleaching because of their excitation and emission located in short-wavelength region. Due to the advantages of two-photon fluorescent probes with near-infrared emissions, a lysosome-targetable two-photon fluorescent probe (Lyso-TP-HClO) with a near-infrared emission was reported in this paper. Lyso-TP-HClO has a high selectivity and a high sensitivity to HClO in the linear range (10.0 × 10-8 to 5.0 × 10-6 M), with a detection limit of 3.0 × 10-8 M. Due to the two-photon excited near-infrared emission, Lyso-TP-HClO has excellent imaging performances, such as small autofluorescence, excellent photostability, and large imaging depth. Furthermore, Lyso-TP-HClO was successfully employed for visualizing lysosomal HClO in bacteria-infected cells. At last, we have successfully used Lyso-TP-HClO to image the arthritis and evaluate the treatment of arthritis in mice. All the results confirm that Lyso-TP-HClO is a useful chemical tool for imaging of lysosomal HClO, the diagnosis of arthritis, and treatment evaluation of arthritis.",

A kinetic model for conditions relevant to chloramine disinfection of drinking water (pH 6-9 and carbonate-buffered) was developed to simulate incomplete bromide (Br-) oxidation during short prechlorination periods because it is the first step in a complex system of reactions that leads to disinfectant loss and DBP formation. Hypochlorous acid (HOCl+Br-→kHOClHOBr+Cl-) and molecular chlorine (Cl2+Br-+H2O→kCl2HOBr+2Cl-+H+) were the free chlorine species relevant to Br- oxidation, and Cl2 hydrolysis and formation reactions (Cl2+H2O+A-⇌k-4k4HOCl+HA+Cl-) were necessary to accurately simulate Cl2 concentrations instead of assuming equilibrium. Previous work has shown that Br- oxidation by HOCl and Cl2 formation are acid-catalyzed and Cl2 hydrolysis is base-catalyzed, but the impact of carbonate species had not been studied. This work showed that the carbonate species have an enhanced catalytic impact with rate constants up to 1000 times larger than would be estimated by the Brønsted relationship for similar acids, which causes the oxidation by HOCl rate constant (kHOCl) to nearly double and oxidation by Cl2 to occur above pH 7 in high-alkalinity waters.",

The investigations were conducted in two seasons, namely winter and summer, in order to examine the correlation between the bioaerosol concentration and the environmental factors. In addition, a single-daily disinfection mode (SM) and a twice-daily disinfection mode (TM) were applied in this study. The results showed that the bacteria and fungi colony counts were strongly correlated with the temperature. Both disinfectants reduced the bacteria and fungi concentrations in the considered rooms. However, of the two disinfectants, the ClO2 showed a stronger disinfection effect than the WAHW. It means that when using ClO2 as the disinfectant, the disinfection efficiency of the TM treatment mode is significantly better than that of the SM treatment mode. But, when using WAHW as the disinfectant, no significant difference is found between the disinfection efficiencies of the two methods. Overall, the results showed that the application of ClO2 twice daily provided the most effective means of satisfying the Taiwan EPA guidelines for the indoor air quality of hospital medical wards."

Hypochlorous acid (HOCl), one kind of ROS, is a hopeful biological marker for inflammation-related diseases. Therefore, the excessive generation of HOCl might be a significant reason for oxidative injury in ALI. Herein, we developed a fluorescent probe, namely BCy-HOCl, for quantitatively monitoring and visualizing HOCl in living cells and in vivo. The probe BCy-HOCl displayed a significant fluorescence signal enhancement towards HOCl with excellent selectivity and sensitivity. The variation of HOCl in the ALI cell model and ALI mouse model was evaluated with BCy-HOCl to clarify the relationship between ALI and HOCl. Our results verified that the HOCl levels conspicuously increased with the severity of the ALI. Thus, HOCl is likely to play a crucial part in the process of ALI, which will probably provide a new strategy for its treatment.",

The probe was designed by incorporating a MR contrast agent, Gd-DOTA, into a HClO-responsive bipyridine-Ru(II) complex derivative. The specific reaction between Ru-AN-Gd and HClO triggers the cleavage of an ether bond in the probe molecule, resulting in phosphorescence turn-on and MR turn-off responses to HClO. The integration of MR and phosphorescence detection modes allows the probe to be employed for detecting HClO in a quite wide concentration range (0.6-2000 μM) and for imaging HClO at various resolutions ranging from the subcellular level to the whole body without a depth limit. Its applicability was demonstrated by phosphorescence imaging of lysosomal HClO in live cells, visualization of HClO generation in a mouse arthritis model, and bimodal phosphorescence-MR imaging of HClO in drug-induced acute liver and kidney injury of a mouse. The research achievements suggested the potential of Ru-AN-Gd for diagnosis and treatment monitoring of HClO-related disease.",

These compounds form in fast second-order reactions between N-methyl amino acids and hypochlorous acid. The comparison of the activation parameters for the reactions of N-methyl substituted and nonsubstituted branched-chain amino acids reveals the transition-state features less organized structure and stronger bonds between the reactants in the reactions with the N-methyl derivatives. This is due to a combined positive inductive effect of the N-methyl group and the alkyl side chain as well as to the steric effects of the substituents. N-Methyl-N-chloro amino acids decompose much faster than the nonsubstituted compounds. The reaction rates do not depend on the pH, and the same final product is formed in the entire pH range. N-Chlorosarcosine is an exception, as it decomposes via competing paths, kdobs = kd + kdOH[OH-], yielding different final products. This feature is most likely due to the lack of an alkyl substituent on the α-carbon atom. Under physiological pH, aldehydes and methylamine form in these reactions, which are not particularly toxic.",

However, the mechanisms behind the improved immunogenicity are still elusive. To address this question, we conducted a proteomic and immunopeptidomics analyses to map modifications and alterations introduced by HOCl treatment using a human melanoma cell line as a model system. First, we show that one-hour HOCl incubation readily induces extensive protein oxidation, mitochondrial biogenesis, and increased expression of chaperones and antioxidant proteins, all features indicative of an activation of oxidative stress-response pathways. Characterization of the DC proteome after loading with HOCl treated tumor lysate (Ox-L) showed no significant difference compared to loading with untreated whole tumor lysate (FT-L). On the other hand, detailed immunopeptidomic analyses on monocyte-derived DCs (mo-DCs) revealed a great increase in human leukocyte antigen class II (HLA-II) presentation in mo-DCs loaded with Ox-L compared to the FT-L control. Further, 2026 HLA-II ligands uniquely presented on Ox-L-loaded mo-DCs were identified. In comparison, identities and intensities of HLA class I (HLA-I) ligands were overall comparable. We found that HLA-II ligands uniquely presented by DCs loaded with Ox-L were more solvent exposed in the structures of their source proteins, contrary to what has been hypothesized so far. Analyses from a phase I clinical trial showed that vaccinating patients using autologous Ox-L as an antigen source efficiently induces polyfunctional vaccine-specific CD4+ T cell responses. Hence, these results suggest that the increased immunogenicity of Ox-L is, at least in part, due to qualitative and quantitative changes in the HLA-II ligandome, potentially leading to an increased HLA-II dependent stimulation of the T cell compartment (i.e., CD4+ T cell responses). These results further contribute to the development of more effective and immunogenic DC-based vaccines and to the molecular understanding of the mechanism behind HOCl adjuvant properties."

When cyanocobalamin (10 μmol/L) was treated with these compounds, hypochlorous acid water (an effective chlorine concentration of 30 ppm) rapidly reacted with cyanocobalamin. The maximum absorptions at 361 and 550 nm completely disappeared by 1 h, and vitamin B12 activity was lost. There were no significant changes observed in the absorption spectra of cyanocobalamin for 0.01% (w/v) sodium metabisulfite; however, a small amount of the reaction product was formed within 48 h, which was subsequently identified as sulfitocobalamin through high-performance liquid chromatography. Similar results were shown for sodium sulfite. The effects of these food additives on the vitamin B12 content of red shrimp and beef meats were determined, revealing no significant difference in vitamin B12 content of shrimp and beef meats with or without the treatment even in hypochlorous acid water. The results suggest that these food additives could not react with food vitamin B12 in food, as most of this vitamin present in food is its protein-bound form rather than the free form."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Management of the open abdomen (OA) has rapidly evolved over the last several decades due to the improved understanding of the underlying pathophysiology of patients with an OA, adoption of damage control surgery, and the use of temporary abdominal closure (TAC) techniques for this patient population. The TAC utilizing negative pressure has been successful for managing patients with an OA with improved time to closure. Recent studies have started to examine the use of TAC in conjunction with negative pressure wound therapy with instillation and dwell time (NPWTi-d) for the management of the OA. OBJECTIVE: This case series illustrates the capability, safety, and clinical effectiveness of TAC/NPWTi-d with hypochlorous acid (HOCl) solution. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Three successfully treated cases describe the use of NPWTi-d using HOCl solution for the management of patients with a septic OA. RESULTS: This initial experience suggests instillation of HOCl through the tubing set, in conjunction with the TAC device, is safe and easy to use. This technique decreased the need for more frequent OA lavages in the operating room (OR) after the index procedure, as well as the associated concomitant risks of transporting patients who are critically ill between the SICU and OR. No acute complications related to the TAC device with HOCl were noted. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the results of this study, the authors believe instillation through the TAC device may be the next evolution in the use of abdominal NPWT and programmed intermittent lavage of the peritoneal cavity represents an effective method in the care of patients with a septic OA.",

      "abstract": "Neutrophils kill invading microbes and therefore represent the first line of defense of the innate immune response. Activated neutrophils assemble NADPH oxidase to convert substantial amounts of molecular oxygen into superoxide, which, after dismutation into peroxide, serves as the substrate for the generation of the potent antimicrobial hypochlorous acid (HOCl) in the phagosomal space. In this minireview, we explore the most recent insights into physiological consequences of HOCl stress. Not surprisingly, Gram-negative bacteria have evolved diverse posttranslational defense mechanisms to protect their proteins, the main targets of HOCl, from HOCl-mediated damage. We discuss the idea that oxidation of conserved cysteine residues and partial unfolding of its structure convert the heat shock protein Hsp33 into a highly active chaperone holdase that binds unfolded proteins and prevents their aggregation. We examine two novel members of the Escherichia coli chaperone holdase family, RidA and CnoX, whose thiol-independent activation mechanism differs from that of Hsp33 and requires N-chlorination of positively charged amino acids during HOCl exposure. Furthermore, we summarize the latest findings with respect to another bacterial defense strategy employed in response to HOCl stress, which involves the accumulation of the universally conserved biopolymer inorganic polyphosphate. We then discuss sophisticated adaptive strategies that bacteria have developed to enhance their survival during HOCl stress. Understanding bacterial defense and survival strategies against one of the most powerful neutrophilic oxidants may provide novel insights into treatment options that potentially compromise the ability of pathogens to resist HOCl stress and therefore may increase the efficacy of the innate immune response.",

HHD-derived keratinocytes have increased oxidative-stress that is associated with impaired proliferation and differentiation. Additionally, HHD is characterized by skin lesions that do not heal and by recurrent skin infections, indicating that HHD keratinocytes might not respond well to challenges such as wounding or infection. Hypochlorous acid has been demonstrated in vitro and in vivo to possess properties that rescue both oxidative stress and altered wound repair process. Thus, we investigated the potential effects of a stabilized form of hypochlorous acid (APR-TD012) in an in vitro model of HHD. We found that treatment of ATP2C1-defective keratinocytes with APR-TD012 contributed to upregulation of Nrf2 (nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2). Additionally, APR TD012-treatment restored the defective proliferative capability of siATP2C1-treated keratinocytes. We also found that the APR-TD012 treatment might support wound healing process, due to its ability to modulate the expression of wound healing associated cytokines. These observations suggested that the APR-TD012 might be a potential therapeutic agent for HHD-lesions.",

Hypobromous acid (HOBr) and hypochlorous acid (HOCl) are generated by eosinophils and neutrophils at inflammation sites. The administered methotrexate may encounter HOBr and HOCl, and react with them to generate products. When methotrexate was incubated with HOBr or HOCl at pH 7.4 and 37°C for 30 min, a single product was generated almost exclusively in each case, identified as 3'-bromomethotrexate for HOBr and 3'-chloromethotrexate for HOCl. When methotrexate was incubated with HOCl in the presence of NaBr, the concentration of 3'-bromomethotrexate increased with decreasing concentration of 3'-chloromethotrexate in a dose-dependent manner with NaBr, probably due to the formation of HOBr. Free amino acids suppressed the reactions of methotrexate with HOBr and HOCl. Taurine suppressed the HOCl reaction but not the HOBr reaction. These results suggest that 3'-bromomethotrexate and 3'-chloromethotrexate may be generated from methotrexate at inflammation sites in humans, although their formation will be suppressed by coexistent amino acids.",

Exposure of the oxygen transport protein horse heart myoglobin (hhMb) to HOCl inhibits Iron III (Fe(III))-heme reduction by cytochrome b5 to oxygen-binding Iron II (Fe(II))Mb. Pathological concentrations of HOCl yielded myoglobin oxidation products of increased electrophoretic mobility and markedly different UV/Vis absorbance. Mass analysis indicated HOCl caused successive mass increases of 16 a.m.u., consistent serial addition of molecular oxygen to the protein. By contrast, parallel analysis of protein chlorination by quantitative mass spectrometry revealed a comparatively minor increase in the 3-chlorotyrosine/tyrosine ratio. Pre-treatment of hhMb with HOCl affected the peroxidase reaction between the hemoprotein and H2O2 as judged by a HOCl dose-dependent decrease in spin-trapped tyrosyl radical detected by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy and the rate constant of 2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid (ABTS) oxidation. By contrast, Mb catalase-like antioxidant activity remained unchanged under the same conditions. Notably, HOCl-modification of Mb decreased the rate of ferric-to-ferrous Mb reduction by a cytochrome b5 reductase system. Taken together, these data indicate oxidizing HOCl promotes Mb oxidation but not chlorination and that oxidized Mb shows altered Mb peroxidase-like activity and diminished rates of one-electron reduction by cytochrome b5 reductase, possibly affecting oxygen storage and transport however, Mb-catalase-like antioxidant activity remains unchanged."

In aqueous solutions hypochlorous acid may decompose into oxygen or chlorate. Using density functional theory (DFT) modelling we have for the first time established detailed mechanisms for the respective decomposition pathways. Our calculations indicate, that both oxygen and chlorate formation proceed through an identical set of intermediates. At neutral pH the reaction is initiated by a fast equilibrium between HOCl, OCl-, Cl2O and Cl3O2-. The subsequent abstraction of Cl- to form Cl2O2 is rate determining for chlorate formation while it is the decomposition of Cl2O2 in the case of oxygen formation. Under alkaline conditions, OCl- decomposition to chlorate proceeds through chlorite. This reaction path is significantly less active. The highest rate for chlorate or oxygen formation is found at pH 7.1. These results highlight the need to consider a complex mixture of different Cl species when addressing the chemistry of hypochlorous acid containing solutions."

Samples were inoculated with two levels of inoculum and rinsed for 15 s in 100 mL of antimicrobial solution treatment. Caprylic acid was the most effective treatment, followed by lactic acid and peroxyacetic acid. Electrolytically-generated hypochlorous acid had no effect. Sensory analysis showed no significant differences either in flavor or in color between samples treated with caprylic acid and reference samples. Caprylic acid appears to be an effective and viable alternative to conventional interventions frequently used for meat product decontamination.",

Excision and grafting have led to a decrease in incidence, but to ensure successful skin grafting, antimicrobial irrigants are frequently utilized to prevent infection. A safe, efficacious, and cost-effective irrigant capable of preventing infections would be a valuable adjunctive therapy. The objectives of this study were to determine whether the test article was noninferior to current therapy in controlling infection and reducing postoperative pain in patients with skin graft. Methods: Patients with burns requiring skin grafting were randomized to hypochlorous acid or 5% Sulfamylon solution as topical dressings postoperatively. Inclusion criteria included thermal injury 20% or more total body surface area requiring excision and autografting, and age 18 years or more. Exclusion criteria included pregnant females, chlorine sensitivity, and electrical/chemical/cold injuries. The following outcomes were assessed: patient demographics, graft viability, infection, pain score, narcotic usage, adverse events, and cost. Results: Treatment groups were demographically equivalent. There were no differences in adverse or serious adverse events between the 2 groups. Graft viability and infection rate were equivalent between the 2 groups. In addition, pain scores and narcotic usage were similar. Hypochlorous acid was significantly less expensive than 5% Sulfamylon solution. Conclusions: Hypochlorous acid demonstrated equivalent efficacy and safety compared with 5% Sulfamylon when used as the postoperative topical dressing for skin grafts. Hypochlorous acid was more cost-effective. This pilot study was limited by its small sample size. However, hypochlorous acid shows promise as a topical wound dressing and further study with larger groups is warranted."

Specifically, HOCl triggered conversion of the nonfluorescent MB-DOPA to MB enabling far-red fluorescence emission (λmax ∼ 683 nm) and additional ability to photogenerate 1O2 species. Owing to the catechol nature of dopamine characterized with strong electron-donating property, MB-DOPA underwent HOCl-mediated conversion with response time of ∼20 s and a strong fluorescence OFF-to-ON contrast by a factor of more than 3000. The preliminary bioimaging results confirmed the intracellular HOCl sensing ability of MB-DOPA and the in-situ photodynamic therapy (PDT) effectiveness for inducing massive apoptosis of cancer cells. The figure of merits of MB-DOPA, including ability for sensing of nanomolar HOCl with high specificity, rapid response, practicality for intracellular fluorescence imaging, and the in-situ generation of 1O2 for killing tumor cells, is expected to enable diagnosis of early-stage oncogenesis based on the highly specific detection of abnormal HOCl levels in the transformed cells and the simultaneous treatment in biomedical applications.",

Acinetobacter baumannii, Staphylococcus aureus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa are three difficult-to-treat biofilm-forming bacteria frequently found in wound infections. This work describes a novel wound dressing in the form of an electrochemical scaffold (e-scaffold) that generates controlled, low concentrations of hypochlorous acid (HOCl) suitable for killing biofilm communities without substantially damaging host tissue. Production of HOCl near the e-scaffold surface was verified by measuring its concentration using needle-type microelectrodes. E-scaffolds producing 17, 10 and 7 mM HOCl completely eradicated S. aureus, A. baumannii, and P. aeruginosa biofilms after 3 hours, 2 hours, and 1 hour, respectively. Cytotoxicity and histopathological assessment showed no discernible harm to host tissues when e-scaffolds were applied to explant biofilms. The described strategy may provide a novel antibiotic-free strategy for treating persistent biofilm-associated infections, such as wound infections.",

Herein, a upconversional nanoparticle (UCNP)-based nanoprobe, Ru@UCNPs, for specific sensing and imaging of hypochlorous acid (HOCl) is reported. This Ru@UCNP nanoprobe consists of two functional components,, i.e., NaYF4 :Yb, Tm UCNPs that can convert near infrared light-to-visible light as the energy donor, and a HOCl-responsive ruthenium(II) complex [Ru(bpy)2 (DNCH-bpy)](PF6 )2 (Ru-DNPH) as the energy acceptor and also the upconversion luminescence (UCL) quencher. Within this luminescence resonance energy transfer nanoprobe system, the UCL OFF-ON emission is triggered specifically by HOCl. This triggering reaction enables the detection of HOCl in aqueous solution and biological systems. As an example of applications, the Ru@UCNPs nanoprobe is loaded onto test papers for semiquantitative HOCl detection without any interference from the background fluorescence. The application of Ru@UCNPs for background-free detection and visualization of HOCl in cells and mice is successfully demonstrated. This research has thus shown that Ru@UCNPs is a selective HOCl-responsive nanoprobe, providing a new way to detect HOCl and a new strategy to develop novel nanoprobes for in situ detection of various biomarkers in cells and early disgnosis of animal diseases.",

They are attributed with lower cytotoxicity and have therefore gained increasing attention in daily clinical practice. OBJECTIVES: To determine the cytotoxicity and antimicrobial efficacy of six NaClO/HClO wound irrigation solutions. METHODS: For cytotoxicity evaluation (based on DIN EN 10993-5), human keratinocytes (HaCaT) and human skin fibroblasts (BJ) were used. Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were used for antimicrobial efficacy evaluation (based on DIN EN 13727). Solutions were evaluated after 1, 5 and 15 min of exposure. Additionally, physicochemical properties (pH and oxidation-reduction potential values) were investigated. RESULTS: Efficacy and cytotoxicity varied significantly between solutions. Generally, increasing antimicrobial activity was associated with decreasing cell viability. Furthermore, a concentration- and time-dependent impact on pathogens and cells was observed: cytotoxic and antimicrobial activity increased with rising NaClO/HClO solution concentrations and extended exposure times. Based on these in vitro evaluations, the following ranking (lowest to highest microbicidal effect and cytotoxic impact) was found: Microdacyn60® (SHC/HCA-M) < Granudacyn® (SHC/HCA-G) < Veriforte™ (SHC/HCA-V) < KerraSol™ (SHC-K) < Lavanox® (SHC-L) ≪ ActiMaris®forte (SHC/SM-A). CONCLUSIONS: The presented results indicate that microbicidal effects are almost always associated with certain negative side effects on cell proliferation. Efficacy and biocompatibility of NaClO/HClO solutions depend on their specific formulation and physicochemical properties. The investigations also underline the necessity for exact product- and application-specific efficacy profiles.",

      "abstract": "Phagocytes destroy ingested microbes by producing hypochlorous acid (HOCl) from chloride ions (Cl-) and hydrogen peroxide within phagolysosomes, using the enzyme myeloperoxidase. HOCl, the active ingredient in bleach, has antibacterial/antiviral properties. As myeloperoxidase is needed for HOCl production, non-myeloid cells are considered incapable of producing HOCl. Here, we show that epithelial, fibroblast and hepatic cells have enhanced antiviral activity in the presence of increasing concentrations of sodium chloride (NaCl). Replication of enveloped/non-enveloped, DNA (herpes simplex virus-1, murine gammaherpesvirus 68) and RNA (respiratory syncytial virus, influenza A virus, human coronavirus 229E, coxsackievirus B3) viruses are inhibited in a dose-dependent manner. Whilst treatment with sodium channel inhibitors did not prevent NaCl-mediated virus inhibition, a chloride channel inhibitor reversed inhibition by NaCl, suggesting intracellular chloride is required for antiviral activity. Inhibition is also reversed in the presence of 4-aminobenzoic hydrazide, a myeloperoxidase inhibitor, suggesting epithelial cells have a peroxidase to convert Cl- to HOCl. A significant increase in intracellular HOCl production is seen early in infection. These data suggest that non-myeloid cells possess an innate antiviral mechanism dependent on the availability of Cl- to produce HOCl. Antiviral activity against a broad range of viral infections can be augmented by increasing availability of NaCl.",
