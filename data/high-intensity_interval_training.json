      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Extensive research has demonstrated the effectiveness of high-intensity interval training (HIIT) in children and adults; however, evidence specific to university students remains limited. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of HIIT on promoting physical health in university students and to identify potential factors influencing intervention outcomes. METHOD: A systematic search was conducted across five electronic databases (Web of Science, Scopus, PubMed, SportDiscus, and MEDLINE) up to December 2024 using Boolean operators and keywords related to HIIT and university students. INCLUSION CRITERIA: (1) Experimental studies; (2) Physical-related outcomes; (3) Intervention duration of at least 3 weeks; (4) Meets the definition of high-intensity activity; (5) Participants are general university students. A meta-analysis was conducted using RevMan 5.4 software, comparing intervention and control groups. Effect sizes were calculated using Cohen's d, and heterogeneity was assessed with the I² statistic. Subgroup analyses were performed based on intervention duration and rest interval duration. RESULTS: Results showed that HIIT significantly reduced BMI, body fat percentage, waist-to-hip ratio, and heart rate, while significantly improving VO2max and muscle strength in university students. Interventions lasting longer than eight weeks demonstrated greater improvements in muscle strength compared to those lasting eight weeks or less. However, there are no significant differences in rest interval across any of the groups. Notably, HIIT also has positive effects on agility and speed with varying effect sizes. CONCLUSION: The unique characteristics of university students make HIIT a time-efficient and effective intervention strategy for this population. Future studies should consider the specific needs of the university environment, incorporating the latest technological advancements and developing tailored intervention strategies that align with students' preferences."

      "abstract": "High-intensity interval training (HIIT) in hypoxia has demonstrated superior increases in aerobic capacity (VO2 max) adaptations, but this has not been explored in distance runners. This study examined the methodological and VO2 max adaptations of HIIT under different altitude conditions in distance runners. We searched the PubMed, ProQuest, Europe PMC, ScienceDirect, and Cochrane databases until August 2024. Among the 1183 reviewed studies, six studies were included. The PEDro score determined the methodological quality, and a meta-analysis was performed using Jamovi software. The results revealed that VO2 max improved more in hypoxic (4.4%-13%) HIIT than in normoxic (1%-8.3%) HIIT. The meta-analysis results revealed that the effect of HIIT under hypoxia on the VO2 max overall standardized mean difference (SMD) was 0.68, with a 95% confidence interval [0.3, 1.06], p < 0.001. Conversely, the pooled SMD was not related to the type of hypoxia (p = 0.4), training status (p = 0.36), intervention week (p = 0.82), and sex (p = 0.32). In conclusion, HIIT under hypoxia achieves a greater VO2 max improvement than normoxia. Endurance athletes and coaches could plan to benefit from such training. However, studies on females using different HIIT protocols and participants at different natural altitudes are limited. This review is registered under the PROSPERO CRD42024578473."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: High-intensity interval training (HIIT) has emerged as an effective strategy for mitigating postprandial glycemia in overweight or obese individuals. This scoping review aims to examine randomized controlled trials (RCTs) conducted between 2008 and 2024 that evaluated the impact of HIIT on acute postprandial glycemic response. METHODS: A comprehensive search strategy was employed using terms such as \"high-intensity interval training (HIIT)\" and \"postprandial glycemia\", combined with Boolean operators, with no restrictions on study type. Electronic databases searched included PubMed, SPORTDiscus, Scopus, and Web of Science from their inception through 2024. Of the 67 studies that met the inclusion criteria, five RCTs were selected for final analysis. All selected studies involved individuals with a body mass index (BMI) ≥ 25. RESULTS: Each of the five included RCTs featured at least one HIIT intervention group, with variations in frequency, duration, intensity, and testing protocols. Despite differences in glucose tolerance test timelines, the glucose-loading protocol (75 g) and exercise interventions demonstrated minimal heterogeneity across studies. The findings suggest that short-term HIIT interventions may positively influence acute postprandial glycemic responses in overweight and obese populations. CONCLUSIONS: Short-term HIIT appears to be a promising intervention for improving postprandial glycemic control in individuals with elevated BMI. Future research is warranted to further elucidate both the acute and long-term effects of HIIT, particularly the role of skeletal muscle in regulating systemic glucose levels in this population.",

Long-term maintenance of TRE and HIIT in real-world settings is unknown. In our previous TREHIIT trial, 131 women (body mass index (BMI) ≥ 27 kg/m2) were randomized to 7 weeks of TRE (eating window 10-h/day), HIIT (3 sessions/week), a combination (TREHIIT), or no intervention (CON). We investigated self-reported continuation of TRE and/or HIIT after 2 years. Fifty-nine participants (39.0 years (standard deviation (SD) 6.1), BMI 30.7 kg/m2 (SD 4.2)) attended the follow-up. Of those who completed the 7-week TRE or HIIT intervention, 46% maintained TRE and 45% continued HIIT for 2 years. There were no statistically significant (at p < .01) between-group differences in cardiometabolic outcomes, but non-significant lower body mass in HIIT (-4.2 kg, 95% confidence interval (CI), -7.7 to -0.7, p = .019) and visceral fat in TREHIIT (-18 cm2, CI, -33 to -4, p = .015) versus CON. After 2 years, HIIT and TREHIIT had ~ 4 kg lower fat mass and ~ 20 cm² lower visceral fat (both p < .001) compared with baseline. A short-term TRE and HIIT intervention may promote long-term lifestyle changes and health benefits.

This narrative review aims to comprehensively evaluate the efficacy of HIIT in enhancing CV health and preventing CV disease (CVD). METHODS: A comprehensive search of PubMed identified 257 articles, of which 39 studies met predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria for quality assessment. Key metrics evaluated included blood pressure, vascular function, lipid profiles, body composition, and CRF. RESULTS: HIIT significantly improved vascular function, evidenced by reductions in systolic and diastolic blood pressure and enhanced flow-mediated dilation. Improvements in cardiac function were observed through increased cardiac output and heart rate variability. Additionally, HIIT positively influenced lipid profiles, decreasing low-density lipoprotein and triglycerides while increasing high-density lipoprotein. Significant reductions in body fat and improvements in VO2peak were noted, contributing to enhanced CRF. HIIT also positively impacted mental health and QoL, reducing anxiety and depressive symptoms. Importantly, HIIT was safely and effectively applied to high-risk populations-individuals with obesity, metabolic syndrome, CVD, and cancer survivors-with a low incidence of adverse effects. CONCLUSIONS: This review highlights HIIT as an effective and safe exercise modality for improving CV health, metabolic indicators, mental health, and QoL. Future research should focus on developing tailored HIIT protocols to optimize adherence and efficacy across diverse populations, considering variations in age, sex, health status, and underlying medical conditions."

The effects of repeated-sprint training vs. short-bout high-intensity interval training on hamstring architecture and physical fitness. J Strength Cond Res 39(5): e620-e627, 2025-The aim of the study was to quantify and compare the effects of repeated-sprint training (RST) vs. short-bout high-intensity interval training (HIIT) on hamstring architecture and physical fitness in rugby league players. A parallel, 2-group, pretest posttest design was used, whereby 24 representative U20 players were assigned to either RST or short-bout HIIT for a 6-week intervention delivered alongside usual training. Assessments of biceps femoris long-head (BFlh) muscle architecture, countermovement jump (CMJ), eccentric hamstring strength, sprint force-velocity power (FVP) profiles, and 1,200 m shuttle run time (i.e., aerobic fitness) were performed. Compared with baseline, the RST group was associated with moderate improvements in aerobic fitness (change ±90% confidence interval [CI]: -4 ± 5 seconds) and maximal theoretical velocity (0.11 ± 0.10 m·s-1), as well as a moderate increase in BFlh fascicle length (1.05 ± 0.46 cm), a small increase in BFlh muscle thickness (0.12 ± 0.16 cm), and a moderate reduction in the BFlh pennation angle (-0.85 ± 0.64°). The short-bout HIIT group was associated with a moderate improvement in aerobic fitness (-10 ± 4 seconds) and a small improvement in CMJ peak power (1.4 ± 1.4 W·kg-1), as well as a large increase in BFlh fascicle length (0.99 ± 0.44 cm), a moderate increase in BFlh muscle thickness (0.15 ± 0.13 cm), and a small reduction in the BFlh pennation angle (-0.67 ± 0.50°). Changes in aerobic fitness were greater for short-bout HIIT when compared to RST, and this difference was moderate (effect size ±90% CI: 0.89 ± 0.82; pMET 0.108). Conversely, changes in 10-m sprint (0.82 ± 0.66; pMET 0.062), 20-m sprint (0.95 ± 0.71; pMET 0.043), 30-m sprint (0.104 ± 0.73; pMET 0.031) times, and certain FVP characteristics, were greater for RST, and these differences were moderate. Both groups increased fascicle length, but RST was more effective at improving sprint speed, while short-bout HIIT was more effective for improving aerobic fitness. Collectively, our findings demonstrate the potential benefits of these conditioning methods, which may cause morphological, physiological, and neuromuscular adaptations in athletes when applied alongside usual training practice.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: This study examined the effects of 8-week interventions based on two variants of typical exercises, namely, high-intensity interval training (HIIT) and high-intensity plyometric training (HIPT), on body fat (BF%), blood pressure, and cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF). In addition, the sustainability of the effects after another 8 weeks was assessed. METHODS: The project was designed as a randomized controlled trial with eight groups of participants (two variants, two sexes, and two groups (experimental and control)) and was conducted in a school physical education (PE) program. The outcomes analyzed were the BF%, systolic (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), and CRF expressed in terms of maximum oxygen uptake (VO2max). A total of 307 healthy adolescents participated in this study and were randomly assigned into the two groups. During the 8 weeks, the participants completed two exercise sessions each week with progressively increasing volumes. For the first 2 weeks, the sessions involved four rounds of 20 s of intense effort followed by 10 s of rest; this increased to six rounds during weeks 3-4 and eight rounds during weeks 5-8. The HIPT program was based on plyometric exercises, whereas the HIIT was based on bodyweight resistance exercises. RESULTS: Multidimensional analysis of variance (ANOVA) indicated a statistically significant second-order interaction (time × variant × group: Ʌ = 0.943, F = 2.20, p < 0.027, η2 pG = 0.057, d = 0.25), confirming the changes in the BF%, SBP, DBP, and VO2max dependent on the type of intervention and group assignment. The ANOVA results revealed significant main and interaction effects for BF%, SBP, and DBP, with time and the HIIT variant as the main contributors (BF%: F = 3.911, p = 0.023, η2 pG = 0.001, d = 0.04 vs. F = 9.900, p < 0.001, η2 pG = 0.001, d = 0.03; SBP: F = 31.801, p < 0.001, η2 pG = 0.012, d = 0.16 vs. F = 8.939, p = 0.003, η 2 pG = 0.026, d = 0.16; DBP: F = 3.470, p = 0.033, η2 pG = 0.002, d = 0.06 vs. F = 4.982, p = 0.026, η2 pG = 0.014, d = 0.12). The second-order interaction for VO2max (time × sex × group: F = 6.960, p = 0.001, η2 pG = 0.003, d = 0.05) indicated that the improvements over time were not related to the training variant. Although these effects were small (low eta values), post hoc tests (all comparisons in post-intervention, p > 0.05) showed that both the HIIT and HIPT groups exhibited beneficial changes compared to controls; however, no statistically significant differences were observed between the experimental and control groups. Furthermore, the observed improvements were maintained through the 8-week follow-up period, as demonstrated by no significant changes between the post-intervention and follow-up measurements (p > 0.05). Discriminant analysis showed that BF% and SBP were the key variables for the two exercise variants in men, with HIPT yielding greater reductions in SBP and HIIT resulting in more pronounced decreases in BF%. DISCUSSION: In conclusion, both HIIT and HIPT interventions effectively improved health-related parameters, providing valuable enrichment to the PE lessons in schools. These benefits were also sustained for at least 8 weeks post-intervention."

Therefore, this study investigates the combined effects of HIIT and TRF on the AKT/FOXO1/PEPCK signaling pathway in the liver tissue of type 2 diabetic rats. 42 male Wistar rats (4-5 weeks of age) were included in the study. The animals were randomly divided into two groups: (1) Standard diet (SD, non-Diabetic (Non-D, n = 7) (2) High-fat diet (HFD, n = 35) for 4 weeks. To induce diabetes, 35 mg/kg of streptozotocin (STZ) was injected intraperitoneally (IP). Animals with blood glucose levels of > 250 mg/dL were considered as diabetic. Diabetic rats were randomly divided into 5 groups (n = 7): (1) Diabetes-exercise (D-EX), (2) Diabetes-TRF (D-TRF), (3) Diabetes-combined TRF and exercise (D-TRF&EX), (4) Diabetes no treatment (D-NT), (5) Diabetes with metformin (D-MET). Interventions (HIIT and TRF) were performed for 10 weeks. Rats in the Non-D group did not exercise and did not receive metformin or TRF. Periodic Acid-Schiff (PAS) staining was used to histologically analyze the liver tissue. Levels of blood glucose, insulin resistance (IR), FOXO1 protein, PEPCK, and area under the curve (AUC) following the IPGTT test, were significantly decreased in treatment groups compared to the D-NT group (p < 0.05). The AKT protein levels (p < 0.01), glycogen content (p < 0.05), and insulin sensitivity (p < 0.001) increased in the treatment groups as compared with the D-NT group. Microscopic examination of the liver tissue in general showed a better tissue arrangement in both treatment groups than in the D-NT group. Combining HIIT and TRF may be effective for improving blood glucose regulation, insulin sensitivity, in type 2 diabetes, as compared to TRF or HIIT interventions alone.",

Thirty-six obese young adults (eleven female, age: 22.1 ± 2.3 years, BMI: 25.1 ± 1.2 kg/m2) were to Whole-body high-intensity interval training group (WB-HIIT) (n = 12), jump rope high-intensity interval training group (JR-HIIT) (n = 12), or non-training control group (CG) (n = 12). WB-HIIT and JR-HIIT groups performed an 8-week HIIT protocol. WB-HIIT, according to the program of unarmed resistance training, JR-HIIT use rope-holding continuous jump training, each execution of 4 sets of 4 × 30 s training, interval 30 s, inter-set interval 1min, and the control group maintained their regular habits without additional exercise training. Body composition and muscular strength were assessed before and after 8 weeks. Repeated measures analysis of variance and clinical effect analysis using Cohen's effect size were used, with a significance level of p < 0.05. In comparison with the CG group in both experimental groups, Body Mass and BMI significantly reduced (p < 0.05), and Muscular strength significantly improved (p < 0.05).WB-HIIT versus JR-HIIT: Fat Mass (- 1.5 ± 1.6; p = 0.02 vs - 2.3 ± 1.2; p < 0.01) and % Body Fat (- 1.3 ± 1.7; p = 0.05 vs - 1.9 ± 1.9; p < 0.01) the effect is more pronounced in the JR-HIIT group; Muscle Mass (1.5 ± 0.7; p < 0.01 vs - 0.8 ± 1.1; p = 0.07) the effect is more pronounced in the WB-HIIT group.

All three groups had no significant changes in visceral adipose tissue (p > 0.05). Significant differences in Lipid and Carbohydrate oxidation and energy output were observed between the two groups, as well as substantial differences in WB-HIIT and JR-HIIT VO2, ventilation, and energy consumption minute during the 0-5 min post-exercise period (p > 0.05). WB-HIIT and JR-HIIT interventions effectively improve the body composition of young adults with obesity, while WB-HIIT additionally improves muscular fitness.

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: The aim was to evaluate the safety and possibility of performing high-intensity interval training (HIIT) on a stationary bike for participants with cancer-related lower limb lymphedema (LLL) with and without compression garments in a cross-over design. METHODS: Twenty-one participants with LLL were randomized to two sessions of HIIT on a stationary bike, one with and one without compression garments. The sessions were separated by a seven-day washout period. The trial was carried out in a hospital setting from September to November 2018. The acceptability and safety of the intervention were assessed. The safety was evaluated as adverse events and immediate and 24-h changes in self-reported symptoms (pain, heaviness, and tension). Additionally, recruitment, completion rate, and post-exercise changes in LLL were assessed by circumferential measurements of the legs, dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), and bioimpedance spectroscopy (BIS), respectively. RESULTS: Twenty-one out of 35 (60%) eligible patients were included, and 19 (90%) patients completed both exercise sessions. Acceptability was high, and there were no adverse events. There was no clinically relevant difference between performing exercise with and without compression in self-reported symptoms or in limb volume. Small statistically significant differences in soft tissue mass (164.2 g corresponding to 1.4%) and extracellular fluid (L-Dex range < 5 units) were observed with and without compression, respectively, both favoring exercise with compression. CONCLUSION: HIIT on a stationary bike was acceptable for patients with LLL and seemed safe regardless of the use of compression garments.

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To examine the separate and combined effects of low-volume high-intensity interval training (HIIT) and walking compared with no training on insulin sensitivity and skeletal metabolic capacity in individuals with prediabetes. DESIGN: Individuals were randomized to: (1) control (no exercise), (2) HIIT (3 × 20 s's cycle sprint 3 times weekly), (3) HIIT + walking (walking >10 000 steps/day), or (4) walking for 12 weeks. METHODS: Insulin sensitivity was assessed by an oral glucose tolerance test at baseline and end-of-trial. Additionally, proteins important for mitochondria capacity and insulin sensitivity were measured in the vastus lateralis muscle. RESULTS: Seventy sedentary individuals with prediabetes (women n = 36; age: 60.8 ± 11.3 years (mean ± SD); body mass index: 31.6 ± 4.4 kg/m2; fasting plasma glucose: 6.6 ± 0.8 mmol/L; glycated hemoglobin A1c 5.7 ± 0.4% (39.0 ± 4.3 mmol/mol) were included. Compared with control, peripheral insulin sensitivity (measured by the Cederholm index) was significantly improved with HIIT (estimated treatment difference [ETD]: 18.5% [95% confidence interval (CI): 7.4; 28.3%] and HIIT + walking [ETD: 15.7% (95% CI: 4.4; 25.6%)]), but not with walking alone (ETD: 9.4% [95% CI: -2.5; 19.9%]). Whole-body insulin sensitivity (measured by the Matsuda index) was significantly increased with HIIT + walking (ETD: 28.0% [95% CI: 10.3; 42.3%]) and walking alone (ETD: 42.3% [95% CI: 28.3; 53.5%]), but not with HIIT alone (ETD: 17.0% [95% CI: -4.0; 33.7%]). Protein expression of proteins involved in mitochondrial capacity in skeletal muscle and glucose uptake were most improved with HIIT + walking, and no significant effects were observed with walking alone. CONCLUSIONS: Twelve weeks of low-volume HIIT training can improve glucose control and induces adaptations in skeletal muscle important for metabolic health in individuals with prediabetes.",

      "abstract": "Background: The relationship between endometriosis and cardiovascular disease (CVD) is well established. However, the effects of various exercise training modalities and the anti-inflammatory effects of pentoxifylline (PTX) remain inadequately understood. This investigation is aimed at evaluating the effects of PTX, both independently and in conjunction with high-intensity interval training (HIIT) and moderate-intensity continuous training (MICT), on lipid and inflammatory markers including triglycerides (TGs), total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and C-reactive protein (CRP) in a rat model of endometriosis. Materials and Methods: Sprague-Dawley's rats were divided into two primary groups: the healthy control group that received no intervention and the induced endometriosis group. Endometriosis was surgically induced in rats, and those with confirmed endometriotic lesions were further categorized into six groups: control, MICT, drug of PTX (D), MICT+D, HIIT, and HIIT+D. Two weeks after laparotomy, PTX consumption and exercise training were performed for 8 weeks. PTX was administered orally at 100 mg/kg/day. MICT and HIIT sessions were conducted 5 days per week, with MICT beginning at 55% of maximum capacity for 31 min in the first week and progressing to 70% of maximum capacity for 46 min by the eighth week. HIIT sessions consisted of 2 min of running followed by 1 min of passive rest at 85% of maximum capacity, starting with seven intervals in the first week and increasing to twelve by the end of the eighth week. The macroscopic size of endometriosis lesions was measured, and cardiovascular risk factors, including hs-CRP, TC, TG, HDL-C, and LDL-C, were assessed in serum samples. Results: The induction of endometriosis was associated with elevated cardiovascular risk factors, including hs-CRP, TC, and TG. HIIT+D significantly decreased lesion volume (p < 0.0001, 95%confidence interval (CI) = 57.239-94.718), hs-CRP (p = 0.049, CI = -54.083 to - 29.478), TC (p = 0.045, CI = -38.607 to - 25.392), and TG (p = 0.042, CI = 25.531-55.801). PTX significantly decreased lesion volume (p < 0.0001, CI =34.709-73.919) and TC (p = 0.016, CI = -45.153 to - 30.179). Conclusion: All interventions except MICT reduced lesion volume, whereas only HIIT+PTX and PTX, in the order of importance, improved some cardiovascular risk indices in the rat model of endometriosis.",

      "abstract": "High-intensity interval training (HIIT) has potential health benefits in the treatment of many chronic diseases. However, the efficacy of HIIT in patients with metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) remains unclear. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to assess the impact of HIIT on intrahepatic lipids (IHLs) , liver enzymes, and metabolic profiles in individuals with MASLD. All randomized-controlled trials (RCT) that evaluated and compared the effects of HIIT on clinical parameters in patients with MASLD were searched using the PubMed, EMBASE, WOS, and Cochrane databases. Data analysis and integration were performed using RevMan 5.3 (Cochrane Collaboration, Copenhagen, Denmark) and Stata version 18 software (StataCorp LLC, College Station, Texas, USA), and outcomes were assessed using the standardized mean difference (SMD). Our results showed that compared with other types of exercise or no exercise, HIIT could reduce the levels of IHL [SMD: -0.56%, 95% confidence interval (CI): -0.99 to -0.13, P = 0.01], BMI (SMD: -0.31, 95% CI: -0.62 to -0.01, P = 0.04), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (SMD: -0.61, 95% CI: -0.95 to -0.26, P = 0.0006), and aspartate aminotransaminase (AST) (SMD: -0.43, 95% CI: -0.81 to -0.05, P = 0.03) in patients with MASLD. In addition, subgroup analyses showed that HIIT had a positive impact on clinical indicators in patients with MASLD with an intervention duration of less than equal to 8 weeks. This study supports the idea that HIIT can significantly reduce IHL, BMI, ALT, and AST levels, and further studies are needed to assess the long-term adherence and treatment effects of HIIT."

      "abstract": "Introduction: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a chronic, neurodegenerative disease of the central nervous system (CNS). Complications in PD are related to impaired cardiorespiratory capacity, and the presence of motor and nonmotor symptoms, such as reduced cardiorespiratory fitness, decreased respiratory muscle strength and lung volumes and capacities, bradykinesia, muscle rigidity, attenuation of strength and lower limb muscle power, sleep disorders, anxiety, and depressive symptoms. The practice of high-intensity exercise and the examination of the aquatic environment may help to minimize these symptoms and slow disease progression. Objective: To develop a water physical exercise program (WPEP) focusing on high-intensity interval training (HIIT) for individuals with DP. Methods: This is a protocol for a single blinded controlled clinical trial. The sample will consist of individuals with PD between Stages 1 and 4 on the Hoehn and Yahr (HY) Scale, divided into a control group and a WPEP group (which will participate in the WPEP). The outcomes will be divided into three categories: cardiorespiratory, motor, and nonmotor aspects. The WPEP will last 12 weeks, and the intervention will take place two times a week, with a duration of approximately 35 min, with an interval between 48 and 72 h between training sessions for muscle recovery, for a total of 24 sessions. It is expected that this study will establish parameters for prescribing and monitoring a WPEP for individuals with PD Stages 1-4 on the HY scale, enhancing the practice of exercise prescription.

METHODS: Male C57BL/6 J mice aged 19 months (n = 16) were randomly assigned to Old Sedentary (OSED), HIIT, OSED+Glycine (O-Gly), and HIIT+Glycine (H-Gly) groups for an 8-week intervention. Maximum grip strength and running speed were assessed. Myocyte apoptosis was detected by TUNEL staining; myofiber cross-sectional area was measured by laminin staining; reactive oxygen species (ROS) in myocytes were detected by dihydroethidium staining. Western blot and RT-qPCR were used to measure protein and gene expression levels related to senescence, apoptosis, and ferroptosis in myocytes. Chemical methods were employed to detect changes in Malondialdehyde (MDA), Lipid peroxide (LPO), glutathione (GSH), Glutathione-oxidized (GSSG), and total glutathione (T-GSH) contents. RNA-seq technology was utilized to screen for key differentially expressed genes. AutoDockTools software was used for molecular docking predictions between glycine and key differential proteins. RESULTS: H-Gly group mice showed an improved maximum grip strength and muscle fiber cross-sectional area, with a significant reduction in TUNEL-positive cells. RNA-seq analysis revealed a high correlation between ferroptosis pathway genes and Slc25a25 ion transport-related genes, which was further validated by the detection of ferroptosis-related markers. Molecular docking indicated that glycine has binding sites with Slc25a25, with the highest binding energy of -3.7 kcal/mol. CONCLUSIONS: Glycine supplementation has a significant synergistic effect with HIIT in increasing muscle mass and grip strength in aged muscle. The mechanism might be associated with the decrease of Slc25a25-mediated ferroptosis."

      "abstract": "Introduction: This study investigated the effect of vitamin D3 injection combined with high-intensity interval training on cell signaling pathways involved in excessive autophagy, specifically the mTOR (mechanistic target of rapamycin)-Beclin-1-Fyco-1 (FYVE and coiled-coil domain-containing protein 1)-cathepsin D pathway, in the heart tissue of Type 2 diabetes-induced rats. Method: In this experimental study, 32 male Wistar rats were fed a high-fat diet for 6 weeks to induce Type 2 diabetes, followed by a single subcutaneous injection of 35 mg/kg streptozotocin (STZ). The rats were then randomly assigned to one of four groups: (1) diabetes control (DC), (2) diabetes + HIIT (DT), (3) diabetes + vitamin D3 (DV), and (4) diabetes + HIIT + vitamin D3 (DTV). HIIT sessions were conducted for 8 weeks, five times per week, at an intensity of 85%-95% of maximum running speed (V max), while vitamin D3 was administered weekly via subcutaneous injection at a dose of 10,000 IU/kg. Twenty-four hours after the intervention period, heart and left ventricular tissues were collected for analysis of the levels of autophagy signaling proteins mTOR, phosphorylated mechanistic target of rapamycin (pmTOR), Beclin-1, Fyco-1, and cathepsin D. Results: Two-way ANOVA revealed that Type 2 diabetes significantly increased the levels of Beclin-1, Fyco-1, and cathepsin D (p < 0.001) while significantly reducing the levels of mTOR and pmTOR (p < 0.001). HIIT, vitamin D3 injection, and their combined treatment significantly decreased the levels of Beclin-1, Fyco-1, and cathepsin D and increased the levels of mTOR and pmTOR compared to the diabetes control group (p < 0.001). Conclusion: Type 2 diabetes increases autophagy in the left ventricle, marked by altered levels of key autophagy proteins. HIIT and vitamin D3 injections mitigate these effects by enhancing mTOR signaling and reducing excessive autophagy. These interventions show promise as nonpharmacological strategies to improve cardiac health in Type 2 diabetes and could be incorporated into clinical and rehabilitation programs.",

DESIGN: An assessor-blinded randomised controlled trial. SETTING: Community-based setting. PARTICIPANTS: 89 participants (91% female, mean age 62 (SD 13) years) with RMDs were randomly allocated to AHIIT (n=44) or AMICT (n=45). INTERVENTIONS: Both groups participated in group-based peer-led exercise programmes two times per week for 12 weeks. The AHIIT group included four intervals of 4 min at high intensity (Borg scale 14-18). The AMICT group maintained moderate continuous intensity level (Borg scale 12-13). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Peak aerobic capacity (VO2peak) was estimated by time to exhaustion and lower limb functional strength with the 30-second sit-to-stand test (30sSTS) at baseline, 3 months and 6 months. A linear mixed model for repeated measures estimated the mean difference with 95% CI in VO2peak and 30sSTS. RESULTS: Mean exercise intensity was Borg scale 15 (SD 2) and 13 (SD 2) in the AHIIT and AMICT, respectively. Mean improvement in VO2peak in AHIIT was 1.9 mL∙kg-1∙min-1 (95% CI 0.045 to 3.77) compared with AMICT after 12 weeks (p<0.05). There was no statistically significant difference between groups in VO2peak after 6 months or in 30sSTS at either 3 or 6 months (p>0.05). No adverse events during exercise were reported. CONCLUSIONS: AHIIT demonstrated significant improvements in aerobic capacity after 12 weeks, and the intervention was well tolerated with no adverse events reported. However, there was no maintenance of aerobic capacity at 6 months. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT05209802.",

Discovering appropriate exercise interventions combined with beneficial herbal supplements has always been investigated. Hence, our study aimed to assess the impact of 12 weeks of high-intensity interval training (HIIT) and spirulina supplementation on the apolipoproteins, insulin resistance, and body composition of men with obesity. Forty-four men with obesity (height: 168.42 ± 2.63 cm, body mass: 93.24 ± 2.23 kg; BMI: 32.89 ± 1.23 kg/m2; age: 25-40 years) were divided into four groups: control group (CG, n = 11), spirulina group (SG, n = 11), high-intensity interval training group (HIITG, n = 11), and SG + HIIT group (n = 11). The intervention involved the daily administration of either spirulina or a placebo and HIIT three times a week for the training groups. Anthropometric indices, HOMA-IR, insulin, and apolipoproteins (Apo-A, Apo-B, and Apo-J) were measured before and after the 12-week intervention. Post-intervention analysis indicated differences between the CG and the three interventional groups for percent body fat (%BF), insulin, HOMA-IR, and apolipoproteins levels (p < 0.05). Spirulina supplementation with HIIT increased Apo-A while causing decreases in Apo-B and Apo-J levels and improved body composition (weight, %fat), BMI, and HOMA-IR (p < 0.05).

This meta-analysis evaluates the effects of HIIT on cognitive performance compared to moderate-intensity continuous training (MICT) and control groups in older adults and cognitively Impaired Patients. METHODS: A systematic search of PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases was conducted for articles published until 10 October 2024. Eighteen studies were included, comparing cognitive outcomes across HIIT, MICT, and control groups. Cognitive tests evaluated included the Stroop test, Digit Span Test (DST), Trail Making Test (TMT), and the MOST test. RESULTS: HIIT significantly improved performance compared to MICT in the Stroop test (SMD = -0.8, 95% CI: -1.3 to -0.2) and DST (SMD = 0.3, 95% CI: -0.0-0.5). Compared to control groups, HIIT significantly enhanced performance in the TMT (SMD = -0.7, 95% CI: -1.3 to 0.0) and MOST test (SMD = -1.2, 95% CI: -1.8 to -0.7). CONCLUSION: This meta-analysis supports the efficacy of HIIT in enhancing cognitive functions, particularly in cognitive flexibility, working memory, task switching, attention control, and inhibitory control. These findings suggest that HIIT can be an effective intervention for improving cognitive behavior in older adults and cognitively Impaired Patients.

METHODS: Study I recruited 34 overweight female college students and 38 normal-weight female college students, using the GO/NOGO task and the Flanker task to measure the participants' response inhibition and interference inhibition. Study II randomly divided the recruited 64 overweight female college students into an experimental group (n = 32) and a control group (n = 32), with the experimental group undergoing 8 weeks of Tabata-based HIIT and the control group not engaging in any form of exercise. The body composition of the participants was measured using a bioelectrical impedance body composition analyzer made in South Korea, the GAIA KIKO. Based on the SPSS 21.0 software, statistical techniques such as independent sample t-tests, Pearson correlation analysis, and mediation effect tests were used for analysis. RESULTS: The reaction times of overweight female college students were significantly shorter than those of normal-weight female college students under the GO stimulus, consistent conditions, and inconsistent conditions (P < 0.05). 8 weeks of HIIT could effectively reduce the reaction times of overweight female college students under the GO stimulus, consistent conditions, and inconsistent conditions (P < 0.05), and effectively improve BMI, fat-free weight, fat content, muscle content, and basal metabolic rate (P < 0.05). There was a significant positive correlation between fat content and reaction times under the GO stimulus, consistent conditions, and inconsistent conditions (P < 0.05), and a significant negative correlation between waist-hip ratio and reaction times under the GO stimulus (P < 0.05). In addition, the mediation effect test found that fat content had a significant mediating effect in the reaction times under the consistent conditions after HIIT intervention (P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: Overweight female college students have poorer inhibitory function, and HIIT can effectively improve their inhibitory function, with fat content playing a potential mediating role in the intervention process. It is recommended that HIIT be used as an important means to control the weight of overweight female college students and improve their inhibitory function.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Curcumin is the most widely known active substance of turmeric extract, which attributed numerous functional properties, including anti-inflammatory and cardioprotective properties. Inactivity and changes in lifestyle and subsequent overweight/obesity are becoming major health risk factors. OBJECTIVE: the aim of this study was to determine the effect of curcumin supplementation combined with high intensity interval trainings (HIIT) exercise on serum irisin and lipid profile in obese women. METHODS: 40 inactive women (aged 30-35 years, and body mass index 30 and above) allocated in four groups (10 in each) as followed; curcumin (C), exercise plus curcumin (EC), placebo (P), and exercise plus placebo (EP). All subjects completed an eight-week HIIT program. The C and EC groups received one capsule containing 80 mg curcumin nanomicelle daily throughout study. Blood samples were taken in the beginning and after eight weeks to measure changes in the study variables (irisin and lipid profile). The ANCOVA and Bonferroni's post hoc test was used to compare variables between 4 groups and pairwise at a significance level of ≤0.05 using SPSS-22. RESULTS: The results revealed that mean serum irisin (p = 0.023), cholesterol (p = 0.019), triglyceride (p = 0.022), high-density lipoprotein (p = 0.009) and low-density lipoprotein (p = 0.011) were significantly changed in all intervention groups compared to the placebo group. CONCLUSION: Based on these results, it can be concluded that HIIT training with curcumin consumption has a greater significancy on obesity reduction in women; Therefore, curcumin and HIIT exercise can be considered as a therapeutic approach to reduce the negative outcomes of obesity. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRY NUMBER: IRCT20141004019397N2, link. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: This study investigated the effects of curcumin supplementation combined with high-intensity interval training (HIIT) on human serum Irisin levels for the first time, in a clinical randomized trial. This suggests that HIIT training alongside curcumin consumption may be a promising therapeutic approach to reduce the negative health consequences of obesity in women."

However, it is unclear how much exercise load can be achieved depending on subjective intensity. This study aims to examine the extent to which body weight exercise at different subjective intensities produces an exercise load according to exercise type in young, healthy adults. METHODS: The participants were 28 young healthy male adults, who performed a progressive exercise load test, and peak oxygen uptake [Formula: see text] was measured. [Formula: see text], heart rate (HR), and exercise frequency at each subjective intensity during HIIT were also measured, compared, and verified. RESULTS: [Formula: see text] during high-intensity exercises increased significantly with increasing subjective intensity in squats, side lunges, front lunges, and fast walking (p<0.01). However, in squats and fast walking, no significant differences were found between somewhat hard and hard. More than 60% of peak [Formula: see text] was achieved in squats, side lunges, and front lunges at a subjective intensity of somewhat hard, but only 60% of peak [Formula: see text] was achieved in fast walking at a hard subjective intensity. CONCLUSIONS: Exercise modalities under body weight, squats, front lunges, and side lunges can produce high-intensity loads. However, subjective intensity should be \"somewhat hard\" or higher. The results also suggest that fast walking under body weight is an exercise modality in which high-intensity load, even at a high subjective intensity, is difficult to achieve."

      "abstract": "Poor sleep quality is a major problem for women with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Potential causes of poor sleep quality include elevated symptoms of anxiety, hyperarousal, and decreased high frequency-heart rate variability (HF-HRV). Exercise training both decreases anxiety symptoms and increases HF-HRV among samples without PTSD. The effect of exercise training on sleep quality, HF-HRV and PTSD-related symptoms has not been tested in a sample of women exposed to trauma. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) on sleep quality in a sample of women with probable PTSD and test if reductions in anxiety or hyperarousal symptoms and/or increased HF-HRV mediate improved sleep quality. Thirty women with poor sleep quality and a Post-Traumatic Diagnostic Scale (PDS-5) score indicative of PTSD (≥ 28) were randomly assigned to either six-weeks of HIIT or a waitlist control (WL). Sleep quality, PTSD and anxiety symptoms were assessed at baseline (BL), weeks 2, 4, 6, and post-intervention (POST). HF-HRV was measured at BL and POST. A mixed model ANOVA 2 group × 5 time interaction for sleep quality was significant (p < 0.001; HIIT BL: 11.27 ± 2.55; POST: 5.60 ± 2.03 versus WL BL: 9.47 ± 2.83; POST: 8.23 ± 2.39; Hedges' d = -1.57). Anxiety and hyperarousal symptom reductions significantly mediated sleep quality changes. HF-HRV mediation models were non-significant. HIIT-based cycle exercise training in a sample of women with probable PTSD improves sleep quality, and reductions in trait anxiety and hyperarousal symptoms mediated these improvements.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND & AIMS: Exercise is a key component of lifestyle management in patients with metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), but neither its therapeutic effect on the active stage of the disease, that is metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) nor the mediating mechanisms have been characterized. Therefore, we performed multi-omic phenotyping of patients with MASLD-MASH on an exercise program. METHODS: Fifteen patients with MASLD conducted high-intensity interval training (HIIT) combined with home-based training for 12 weeks. MASLD was evaluated using histology, transient elastography, and multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) before and after the intervention. Change in maximal oxygen consumption (VO2max) and MRI-determined liver fat were compared with a control group of patients with MASLD (n = 22). RNA sequencing was performed on liver, muscle, and fat biopsies of patients in the exercise group. Stool was analyzed by shotgun metagenomics and untargeted metabolomics was performed on plasma, urine, adipose, and stool. RESULTS: HIIT increased VO2max by 10.1% and improved mitochondrial metabolism in skeletal muscle, indicating improved cardiorespiratory fitness and adherence. VO2max increased significantly in the exercise group compared with controls. Histologically, no reduction in steatosis, MASH, or liver fibrosis was observed; however, transient elastography tended to improve. MRI-determined liver fat did not change in the exercise group compared with controls. HIIT induced changes in mRNA expression of genes related to beiging of adipose tissue and fibrogenesis in liver. In addition, specific gut microbial taxa and metabolites changed. CONCLUSIONS: HIIT increased cardiorespiratory fitness and induced beneficial gene expression changes in muscle, adipose tissue, and liver, but without translation into histological improvement of MASLD. Longer exercise intervention trials are warranted to validate or refute current recommendations for exercise as a cornerstone treatment for MASLD-MASH. IMPACT AND IMPLICATIONS: Despite exercise being considered as a key component of lifestyle management for steatotic liver disease, neither the clinical effects nor the mechanisms involved are completely understood. We show that a high-intensity interval training (HIIT) program in 15 patients with metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) improved cardiorespiratory fitness, compared with 22 control patients with MASLD who did not participate in an exercise program, however, it did not improve MASLD. HIIT induced a positive effect on fat tissue and muscle metabolism which was accompanied with changes in certain gut bacteria and metabolites in blood and urine. These findings improve our understanding of the effects of exercise on the whole-body metabolism in relation to steatotic liver disease. As such, this study provides a basis for future exercise interventions in patients with MASLD, required to thoroughly test current guideline advice for exercise as a cornerstone treatment for MASLD of all stages.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: In recent years, high-intensity interval training (HIIT) has gained significant attention due to its efficient use of time. Studies have shown that engaging in regular physical activity can effectively reduce symptoms of anxiety. Given the potential side effects and limitations associated with pharmacological treatments for anxiety disorders, there is a growing interest in exploring non-pharmacological interventions. HIIT, as an alternative approach, offers a promising avenue for managing anxiety without relying on medication. However, the specific efficacy and applicability of HIIT for individuals diagnosed with anxiety disorders have not been systematically summarized in the literature. This scoping review aims to explore the effectiveness of HIIT as an intervention for improving anxiety symptoms, as well as its range of applicability, by synthesizing existing research. METHODS: A scoping review methodology was employed to search databases including PubMed, Web of Science, EMbase, and the Cochrane Library. Studies were selected based on predefined criteria: randomized controlled trials (RCTs), cohort studies, and quasi-experimental designs focusing on the improvement of anxiety, using HIIT as the primary intervention. Exclusion criteria included studies with mixed interventions or populations with comorbid conditions. Two independent evaluators screened titles, abstracts, and full texts, extracted data using a pre-tested form, and resolved discrepancies through discussion to ensure consistency and accuracy. RESULTS: A total of 541 articles were identified, of which 16 met the inclusion criteria for this review. The samples comprised various populations, including healthy subjects, overweight males, prostate cancer patients, etc. Twelve studies indicated that HIIT significantly improves anxiety symptoms, especially for individuals with lower baseline anxiety. The effect was less pronounced in those with higher baseline anxiety. Additionally, the studies suggest that variations in training protocols-such as frequency, intensity, and duration-may influence the extent to which HIIT improves anxiety symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: This study underscores the potential of High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) as an effective intervention for reducing anxiety symptoms, especially when tailored to individual baseline characteristics. Variations in training parameters such as frequency, intensity, and duration are critical factors in optimizing HIIT's effectiveness for mental health benefits.HIIT shows promise as a valuable tool for managing anxiety, with the potential to significantly improve mental health outcomes when implemented with careful consideration of individual differences and protocol variations. This study provides a foundation for refining HIIT protocols and expanding their applicability across diverse populations."

METHODS: A total of thirty-one COPD patients underwent HIIT, while an equal number underwent moderate-intensity continuous training (MICT) were included in this randomized controlled clinical study. The randomization method used was stratified block randomization, stratified by center. During the 6 months follow-up period, the clinical data, including cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) results, cardiopulmonary function index, quality of life, and follow-up outcomes, were collected before and after the interventions. The therapeutic effects of the two groups were compared. RESULTS: After the intervention, the HIIT group exhibited significantly higher peak power, exercise test duration, anaerobic threshold, peak oxygen uptake, peak ventilation, FEV1/FVC ratio, FEV1% of expected value, LVEF (%), and SF-36 scores compared to the MICT group (P < 0.05). Moreover, LVEDD was significantly lower in the HIIT group compared to the MICT group (P < 0.05). At the 6-month follow-up, the incidence of COPD acute exacerbation in the HIIT group was significantly lower than in the MICT group (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Implementation of HIIT in rehabilitation nursing effectively improved cardiopulmonary function and exercise capacity in COPD patients during clinical treatment, highlighting its promising application potential.

High intensity interval training (HIIT) has been shown to be an effective alternative to traditional aerobic exercise in patients with hypertension. We evaluated the completeness of reporting of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with HIIT for hypertension and to compare both exercise modes in reporting quality. RCTs of HIIT with a minimum duration of 6 weeks in adults with at least high normal blood pressure (≥130 mmHg/≥85 mmHg) were evaluated using the Consensus on Exercise Reporting Template (CERT). Nine RCTs conducting HIIT in hypertensive patients (N=718; 51.8 years) were evaluated. A mean of 62.6% of items were sufficiently described, compared with 49.2% in moderate intensity training interventions. Exercise dose was adequately reported in 8 out of 9 studies. Only one study reported information on adverse events. In a small sample of RCTs with HIIT in patients with hypertension we found a better reporting quality than in moderate intensity training interventions. However, reporting completeness is not optimal for a good replicability in clinical practice. The lack of reporting of adverse events in interventions using high intensities is particularly unfavourable."

Methods: Participants, recruited according to the primary dysmenorrhea criteria, were divided into non-PD (control) and PD groups, with the PD group further classified into dysmenorrhea (Dysmen), dysmenorrhea with probiotics (DysmenPro), dysmenorrhea with exercise (DysmenEx), and dysmenorrhea with both (DysmenExPro). Interventions included 10 weeks of HIIT and probiotics. Pre- and post-intervention assessments included questionnaires on premenstrual and menstrual symptoms, physical fitness evaluations, and blood sample analyses for biochemical, hormonal, and prostaglandin levels. Results: HIIT significantly reduced premenstrual symptoms, menstrual distress, and pain severity, likely due to hormone (estradiol, prolactin, progesterone, cortisol) modulation and decreased inflammation (high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, PGE2, PGF2α). Cardiovascular endurance and explosive strength showed improvement through high-intensity interval training (HIIT), whereas probiotics had no significant effect on these aspects of physical fitness. While probiotics reduced premenstrual and menstrual distress symptoms, they had no notable impact on pain, inflammation, or hormone levels. Dysmenorrhea-related discomforts were correlated significantly with inflammation and hormones. Conclusions: The intervention strategy involving probiotics and HIIT exercise may be utilized as an alternative and complementary treatment to alleviate PD symptoms. Furthermore, this strategy could also be incorporated into educational health plans to promote women's health and potentially prevent gynecological disorders in the adolescent population.",

      "abstract": "Background: Obesity is a growing public health issue, increasing the risk of metabolic disorders and cardiovascular diseases. Physical activity is a key factor in obesity treatment; however, the effectiveness of different exercise modalities remains unclear, especially considering age-related physiological differences. High-intensity interval training (HIIT) and moderate-intensity continuous training (MICT) are two commonly recommended strategies, but their impact on fat reduction across different age groups has not been thoroughly analyzed. This study aims to determine which training modality is most effective for fat reduction in individuals with obesity, considering age as a crucial factor in exercise response. Methods: A systematic review was conducted, analyzing studies published between 2014 and 2024. The inclusion criteria focused on the studies comparing HIIT and MICT effects on body composition in obese individuals of different age groups. The data extraction included training protocols, fat mass reduction, and adherence levels. The primary outcomes measured changes in body fat percentage and muscle mass retention. Results: HIIT was found to be most effective for younger individuals (18-30 years), promoting fat oxidation and muscle retention. In middle-aged adults (31-40 years), both HIIT and MICT yielded similar benefits, with MICT preferred due to better adherence. In older adults (41-60 years), MICT provided a more sustainable strategy for fat reduction and muscle preservation. However, the variability across the studies limits definitive conclusions. Conclusions: Age influences the effectiveness of HIIT and MICT for obesity treatment, highlighting the need for age-specific exercise recommendations. Future studies should standardize training protocols and assess long-term metabolic adaptations to optimize physical activity guidelines."

After being invited, 26 sedentary women aged between 20 and 54 voluntarily agreed to participate in the study. The sample was obtained through convenience sampling, and the participants chose either PIL or WBHIIT, which resulted in 13 participants in each group. Spinal posture was assessed pre- and post-intervention through videogrammetry during standing and walking. Markers were placed on the back, and the volunteers were instructed to remain in a standing position on a stationary treadmill for ten seconds. Subsequently, the treadmill was activated at a speed of 5 km/h. After one minute of walking, a complete gait cycle was recorded for analysis. The results showed no significant changes in spinal angles in static position between groups. However, in the walking position, there was a large-magnitude increase in the spinal range of motion (ROM) post-intervention (PIL Lumbar d = 1.8; PIL Thoracic d = 2.9; WBHIIT Lumbar d = 1.0; WBHIIT Thoracic d = 3.5) within groups in the sagittal plane. The adaptations promoted by these interventions in spinal ROM are important for reducing the risks of spinal stiffness and pain due to sedentary behaviour.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Standard lifestyle interventions have shown limited efficacy in preventing type 2 diabetes among individuals with isolated impaired fasting glucose (i-IFG). Hence, tailored intervention approaches are necessary for this high-risk group. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to (1) assess the feasibility of conducting a high-intensity interval training (HIIT) study and the intervention acceptability among individuals with i-IFG, and (2) investigate the preliminary efficacy of HIIT in reducing fasting plasma glucose levels and addressing the underlying pathophysiology of i-IFG. METHODS: This study is a 1:1 proof-of-concept randomized controlled trial involving 34 physically inactive individuals (aged 35-65 years) who are overweight or obese and have i-IFG. Individuals will undergo a 3-step screening procedure to determine their eligibility: step 1 involves obtaining clinical information from electronic health records, step 2 consists of completing questionnaires, and step 3 includes blood tests. All participants will be fitted with continuous glucose monitoring devices for approximately 80 days, including 10 days prior to the intervention, the 8-week intervention period, and 10 days following the intervention. Intervention participants will engage in supervised HIIT sessions using stationary \"spin\" cycle ergometers in groups of 5 or fewer. The intervention will take place 3 times a week for 8 weeks at the Aerobic Exercise Laboratory in the Rehabilitation Hospital at Emory University. Control participants will be instructed to refrain from engaging in intense physical activities during the study period. All participants will receive instructions to maintain a eucaloric diet throughout the study. Baseline and 8-week assessments will include measurements of weight, blood pressure, body composition, waist and hip circumferences, as well as levels of fasting plasma glucose, 2-hour plasma glucose, and fasting insulin. Primary outcomes include feasibility parameters, intervention acceptability, and participants' experiences, perceptions, and satisfaction with the HIIT intervention, as well as facilitators and barriers to participation. Secondary outcomes comprise between-group differences in changes in clinical measures and continuous glucose monitoring metrics from baseline to 8 weeks. Quantitative data analysis will include descriptive statistics, correlation, and regression analyses. Qualitative data will be analyzed using framework-driven and thematic analyses. RESULTS: Recruitment for the study is scheduled to begin in February 2025, with follow-up expected to be completed by the end of September 2025. We plan to publish the study findings by the end of 2025. CONCLUSIONS: The study findings are expected to guide the design and execution of an adequately powered randomized controlled trial for evaluating HIIT efficacy in preventing type 2 diabetes among individuals with i-IFG.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: With the increasing utilization of cardiac rehabilitation in clinical treatment and prognosis for patients with cardiovascular diseases, exercise training has become a crucial component. High-intensity interval training (HIIT) and moderate-intensity continuous training (MICT) are commonly employed in rehabilitating patients with cardiovascular diseases. However, further investigation is required to determine whether HIIT and MICT can effectively enhance the prognosis of patients with coronary artery disease. Therefore, this study aims to assess the effectiveness of HIIT and MICT interventions, optimal intervention duration for different intensity levels of training, as well as effective training modalities that improve cardiorespiratory function and exercise capacity among patients. METHODS: We conducted a comprehensive search of the Cochrane Library, PubMed, EMbase, Web of Science, and CINAHL databases for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) pertaining to high-intensity interval training (HIIT) and moderate-intensity continuous training (MICT) interventions in patients with coronary artery disease from inception until publication on September 26, 2024. Two independent researchers assessed articles that met the inclusion criteria and analyzed the results using Sata 17.0 software. Forest plots were employed to evaluate the impact of HIIT and MICT on outcome indicators. Sensitivity analysis and funnel plot assessment were performed to examine publication bias. Subgroup analysis was conducted to determine optimal intervention duration and training methods. RESULTS: A total of 22 studies with 1364 patients were included in the study, including the HIIT group (n = 685) and the MICT group (n = 679). The results showed that compared to MICT, HIIT significantly increased PeakVO2(Peak oxygen uptake)[WMD = 1.42mL /kg/min 95%CI (0.87, 1.98), P = 0.870, I2 = 0%], 6MWT(6-minute walk test)[WMD = 18.60m 95%CI (2.29, 34.92), P = 0.789, I2 = 0%], PHR(Peak heart rate)[WMD = 4.21bpm 95%CI (1.07, 7.36), P = 0.865, I2 = 0%], DBP(diastolic blood pressure)[WMD = 3.43mmHg 95%CI (1.09, 5.76), P = 0.004, I2 = 60.2%]. However, in LVEF(left- ventricular ejection fraction)[WMD = 0.32mL 95%CI (-1.83, 2.46), P = 0.699, I2 = 0%], LVEDV(left ventricular end-diastolic volume)[WMD = 0.91 ml 95%CI (-1.83, 2.46), P = 0.995, I2 = 0%] and SBP(systolic blood pressure)[WMD = 1.85mmHg 95%CI (-0.23, 3.93),P = 0.266, I2 = 18.2%], there was no significant difference between HIIT and MICT. CONCLUSION: Based on the findings of this systematic review, HIIT demonstrates superior efficacy compared to MICT in enhancing PeakVO2, PHR, 6MWT and DBP. However, no significant differences were observed in LVEF, LVEDV, and SBP. In summary, HIIT exhibits potential for improving cardiopulmonary function and exercise capacity among patients with coronary artery disease.",

In addition to medical treatment, the current EULAR recommendations describe the relevance of physical activity, exercise and training as a non-pharmacological management option in patients with SLE. A positive interaction between fatigue and the basic health-promoting effects of exercise is well established. Still unclear is what kind of training, setting, and intensity show optimal objective and subjective outcomes. The study will include 40 adult SLE patients with moderate to severe fatigue. The study lasts 28 weeks and is divided into a 12-week \"real-world\" monitoring phase before rehabilitation, a 4-week inpatient rehabilitation phase, and a 12-week maintenance activity and training phase after the rehabilitation. The parameters consisted of physical performance parameters, laboratory parameters, physician and patient-related questionnaires and activity data based on a fitness watch. During rehabilitation, patients receive individual high-intensity interval training (HIIT), basic endurance training and functional interval training. This proof-of-concept trial aims to investigate if high-intensity interval training is feasible and how VO2peak is increased. Additionally, the effect of the severity of fatigue measured by patient-related outcomes and the number of anti-NR2 antibodies is focussed.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: High-intensity interval training (HIIT) has been recognized as an effective form of short-duration exercise. The purpose of this study was to assess whether HIIT could reduce renal injury induced by myocardial ischemia-reperfusion (MIR) in rats. METHODS: Male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly assigned to the Sham (SHAM), coronary artery occlusion (CAO), HIIT, and ischemic precondition (IPC) groups. Rats underwent 40 minutes of left anterior descending CAO under anesthesia, followed by 3 hours of reperfusion, to induce MIR. Postsurgery, rats were sacrificed, and their blood, heart, and kidney tissues were examined. The HIIT group underwent 4 weeks of HIIT training before surgery. RESULTS: HIIT intervention significantly reduced renal injury after MIR and the concentrations of blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine (CRE) in the serum. Moreover, proinflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), and IL-6, were significantly decreased, while the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 was significantly increased in the serum. Additionally, HIIT intervention suppressed the expression of FoxO1, Bax/Bcl-2 ratio, TNF-α, and cleaved-caspase-3/caspase-3 ratio in kidney tissues, ultimately reducing renal cell apoptosis. CONCLUSION: This study is the first to demonstrate that HIIT has effects similar to IPC, significantly reducing renal injury after MIR. HIIT regulates the production of proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines and inhibits renal cell apoptosis, thereby reducing the occurrence of cardiorenal syndrome.",

The aim of this study was to compare the effects of continuous moderate-intensity training, strength training combined with continuous moderate-intensity training and strength training combined with high-intensity interval training in adults with high blood pressure. METHODS: A 12-week randomized control trial was performed. A total of 100 volunteers, 51 women and 49 men with hypertension participated. The sample was randomly assigned into three intervention groups and one control group. RESULTS: All intervention groups significantly improved their hemodynamic parameters, body composition, lipid profile, glucose, and physical fitness as compared to the control group. Both combined training groups showed greater improvements than the moderate-intensity continuous training group. However, the strength group combined with the moderate-intensity continuous group showed the greatest benefits in systolic, diastolic and mean arterial pressure, of -13.4 mmHg, -6.8 mmHg and -8.9 mmHg respectively, abdominal circumference, upper and lower limb strength and VO₂peak, versus the continuous moderate-intensity group; it also achieved greater reductions in systolic and mean blood pressure, up to -6.8 mmHg and 4.3 mmHg respectively, than the strength group combined with the high intensity interval group. CONCLUSION: Performing a strength training program combined with continuous moderate intensity training, 2 days per week for 12 weeks, produces significant improvements in cardiometabolic biomarkers, body composition, and physical condition of adults with hypertension, with these adaptations being superior to those produced by continuous moderate-intensity training and strength training combined with high-intensity intervallic training.",

      "abstract": "UNLABELLED: Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a prevalent neurodevelopmental condition in children, characterized by inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity. Recent studies have investigated the potential role of physical exercise as a complementary intervention to traditional ADHD treatments. This study aimed to compare the effects of moderate-intensity continuous training (MICT) and high-intensity interval training (HIIT) on ADHD symptoms and behavioral inhibition in children diagnosed with ADHD. In a randomized controlled trial, 60 male participants aged 7-10 years were allocated into three groups: control, MICT, and HIIT. The intervention lasted 12 weeks, with the MICT group performing 20 min of running at 70-75% of their individual VO2 max and the HIIT group performing alternating intervals of running at 100% and 50% of their VO2 max for 1 min each. The control group received no exercise intervention. Cognitive and symptomatic assessments were conducted using the Children's Symptom Questionnaire (CIS-4) and go/no-go tasks before and 48 h post-intervention. Both MICT and HIIT demonstrated significant improvements in behavioral components, including attention deficit, hyperactivity, and impulsivity (all P < 0.0001). HIIT showed superior effects on attention deficit compared to MICT (P = 0.008). Both HIIT (P < 0.0001) and MICT (P = 0.028) improved correct responses (CR) in the Go task compared to the control group. HIIT also outperformed the control group in erroneous responses (ER) (P = 0.022) and correct reaction time (P = 0.027) in the Go task. In the No-Go task, HIIT showed superiority over the control group in both CR (P = 0.013) and ER components. CONCLUSION: This study highlights the comparative efficacy of MICT and HIIT as nonpharmacological interventions for children with ADHD. HIIT, in particular, demonstrated superior benefits for attention deficits, suggesting its potential as a targeted adjunctive treatment. These findings may inform the development of exercise programs to enhance the quality of life and daily functioning of children with ADHD. WHAT IS KNOWN: • Physical exercise has been explored as a complementary intervention for ADHD, with evidence suggesting its potential to improve symptoms such as inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity. • Moderate-intensity continuous training (MICT) has shown positive effects on cognitive and behavioral outcomes in children with ADHD. WHAT IS NEW: • High-intensity interval training (HIIT) demonstrated superior benefits over MICT in improving attention deficits in children with ADHD. • Both HIIT and MICT significantly improved behavioral inhibition, with HIIT showing additional advantages in reducing erroneous responses and enhancing reaction times in cognitive tasks.",

METHODS: Four databases (PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and Cochrane Library) were searched for randomized controlled studies conducted using LV-HIIT interventions (HIIT/SIT protocols involving ≤ 15 min of intense training, within a session lasting ≤ 30 min; < 30 s all-out sprint for SIT additionally). The inclusion criteria required glucose and insulin resistance markers to be evaluated pre- and post-intervention among adults who were not trained athletes. RESULTS: As a result, twenty studies were included, and meta-analyses were conducted using sixteen studies employing HIIT protocols. Compared with CON, LV-HIIT with reduced intensity and extended interval duration significantly improved fasting glucose (FPG) (mean difference (MD) in mg/dL=-16.63; 95% confidence interval (CI): -25.30 to -7.96; p<0.001) and HbA1c (MD=-0.70; 95% CI: -1.10 to -0.29; p<0.001). Greater improvements were found in participants who were overweight/obese or having type 2 diabetes (T2D). FPG decreased with every additional second of interval duration (β;=-0.10; 95% CI: -0.19 to -0.00; p=0.046). FPI (β;=-0.65; 95% CI: -1.27 to -0.02; p=0.042) and HOMA-IR (β;=-0.22; 95% CI: -0.36 to -0.09; p=0.001) decreased with every additional minute of interval duration per session. HOMA-IR also decreased with every additional minute of weekly interval duration (β;=-0.06; 95%CI: -0.08 to -0.04; p<0.001). Compared with MICT, LV-HIIT was more effective in improving insulin sensitivity (SMD=-0.40; 95%CI: -0.70 to -0.09; p=0.01), but there were no differences in FPG, FPI, HbA1c or HOMA-IR (p>0.05). The effect of LV-HIIT on FPI was larger compared with MICT among individuals who lost weight. CONCLUSION: Conclusively, a practical model of LV-HIIT with reduced intensity and extended interval was effective in improving glucose control and its effects were similar to MICT. Greater improvements were found in individuals with overweight/obesity or T2D in protocols with longer intervals or accumulated interval duration per session/week. More large-scale, randomized controlled studies with similar intervention protocols in a wide range of population are warranted to confirm these important results.

      "abstract": "High-intensity interval training (HIIT) is considered an effective therapy strategy for improving chronic pain associated with osteoarthritis (OA). Perineuronal nets (PNNs) are specialized extracellular matrix structures in the cerebral cortex that play a crucial role in regulating chronic pain. However, little is unknown whether HIIT could alleviate OA pain sensitization by reducing PNN levels. This study aimed to determine whether HIIT could reduce sensitivity of the affected joint(s) to pain in a chronic pain model in rats with OA. A rat model of interest was induced by intra-articular injection of monosodium iodoacetate (MIA) into the right knee. Thereafter, the mechanical withdrawal thresholds (MWTs) and PNN levels in the contralateral medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) were measured in rats in the presence or absence of HIIT alone or in combination with injection of chondroitinase-ABC (ChABC) into the contralateral mPFC (inducing the degradation of PNNs), respectively. Results indicated that rats with OA exhibited significant reductions in MWTs, but a significant increase in the PNN levels; that HIIT reversed changes in MWTs and PNN levels in rats with OA, and that pretreatment of ChABC abolished effects of HIIT on MWTs, with PNN levels not changed. We concluded that pain sensitization in rats with OA may correlate with an increase in PNN levels in the mPFC, and that HIIT may increases OA pain-sensitive threshold by reduction of the PNN levels in the mPFC.

We compared the efficacy of RT and HIIT in reducing non-responders (NRs) between weeks 4 and 8 and analyzed time-course adaptations in NRs and responders (Rs). METHODS: Thirty-nine participants were randomized into RT-G (n = 13), HIIT-G (n = 13), or control (CG, n = 13) groups. RT utilized elastic bands, and HIIT involved cycle ergometers, with three weekly 30 min sessions for 8 weeks. SBP and DBP were measured before intervention and at weeks 4 and 8, respectively. Individual responses were classified as NRs or Rs using the Hopkins method (SDIR = √[SDExp2-SDCon2]). Time-course adaptations were evaluated. RESULTS: Both the RT-G and HIIT-G reduced SBP at 8 weeks (RT-G: -13 mmHg; [ES: 1.12]; HIIT-G: -12 mmHg [ES: 0.8]; both p < 0.05). The proportion of NRs for SBP decreased from 46% to 38% in RT-G and 69% to 46% in HIIT-G. Rs showed a peak SBP reduction at 4 weeks (-14.7 and -25.5 mmHg), stabilizing by week 8 (-22.8 and -19.6 mmHg) in RT-G and HIIT-G, respectively. CONCLUSION: Eight weeks of RT and HIIT effectively reduced SBP and NR prevalence, with time-course adaptations favoring Rs."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: High-intensity interval training (HIIT) alternates short periods of intense exercise with recovery, effectively enhancing cardiorespiratory fitness, endurance, and strength in various populations. Concurrently, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) supports neuronal resilience and activity-dependent plasticity, which are vital for learning and memory. This study aims to systematically review changes in BDNF levels in response to HIIT, with three primary objectives: evaluating the benefits of HIIT for BDNF modulation, assessing methodological quality and the risk of bias in reviewed studies, and identifying patterns in BDNF response based on HIIT protocols and population characteristics. METHODS: Comprehensive database searches were conducted in PubMed and SPORTDiscus to identify relevant studies published up to April 2024. Given the diversity in study designs and outcomes, a narrative synthesis was performed rather than a meta-analysis. Bias was evaluated using visualization tools such as RobVis, and the review was conducted by a single researcher, which may limit its comprehensiveness. RESULTS: Twelve studies met the inclusion criteria, with most indicating significant increases in BDNF levels post-HIIT, suggesting HIIT's potential to enhance neuroplasticity and cognitive functions. However, variations in BDNF responses were observed across different HIIT protocols and study populations. Some studies reported decreases or no change in BDNF levels, reflecting the complex regulation of BDNF influenced by factors such as exercise intensity, duration, and individual variability. CONCLUSIONS: HIIT shows promise as an intervention for increasing BDNF levels, with potential benefits for brain health and cognitive function. These findings underscore the need for further research to confirm the optimal conditions under which HIIT can effectively enhance neurological outcomes. Future studies should explore standardized HIIT protocols and the long-term impact of HIIT on BDNF and neuroplasticity."

Preoperative High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) improves cardiorespiratory fitness and postoperative outcomes but is challenging to implement in frailty due to perceived risks. PURPOSE: The aim of this case report was to demonstrate feasibility of HIIT in a patient with frailty and multimorbidity. CASE PRESENTATION: An 83-year-old frail male with atrial fibrillation and limited mobility presenting with locally advanced rectal cancer was assessed as unfit for major surgery unless his cardiorespiratory fitness improved. Initial cardiopulmonary exercise testing demonstrated low cardiorespiratory fitness (peak oxygen consumption (V˙O2peak) of 11.45 mL·min-1·kg-1). He subsequently underwent 15 supervised HIIT sessions targeting a Rating of Perceived Exertion ≥ 15. OUTCOMES: The patient demonstrated initial substantial improvements in his physical condition, increasing maximal work rate from 27.5 W to 55 W. However, there was no additional progress following session eight. At his post-exercise CPET he rapidly fatigued, resulting in a V˙O2peak of 7.4 mL·min-1kg-1. Clinical investigations revealed a worsening anemia with a hemoglobin of 92 g/L caused by an undiagnosed synchronous cecal tumor which was corrected preoperatively. Postoperatively, the patient recovered without complications and was successfully discharged home. CONCLUSION: Personalized HIIT improved exercise duration and work rate and was associated with positive postoperative outcomes in this patient with frailty and multimorbidity. A unique feature of this case was the unexpected loss of training progress and V˙O2peak deterioration post-HIIT, which prompted further clinical investigations. These identified a worsening anemia and resulted in important changes in both the preoperative and intraoperative treatment."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: To our knowledge, there is no clear consensus on a definitive cardiac rehabilitation method for patients undergoing Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG). We conducted this systematic review to compare and evaluate the effects of two of the most frequent cardiac rehabilitation modalities, high-intensity interval training (HIIT) and moderate-intensity continuous training (MICT), on cardiopulmonary variables. METHODS: We carried out a systematic search of the databases PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, Scopus, and Google Scholar. Following the removal of duplicate results, the original search yielded 385 citations. We identified four randomized clinical trials after reviewing titles, abstracts, and potential full-text studies. We utilized the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool (RoB2) to assess the risk of bias. RESULTS: We included four randomized clinical trials involving 143 people. All trials included individuals who had CABG and completed HIIT or MICT sessions for at least four weeks. The findings indicated that HIIT programs may improve functional capacity, heart rate variability indices, and blood pressure management while lowering brain natriuretic peptide (BNP1-32) and N-terminal pro-b-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP1-76) levels. CONCLUSION: Given the findings, it appeared that supervised high-intensity exercise regimens could be more useful to patients. Following the surgery, HIIT therapy improves exercise capacity, the autonomic nervous system, volume overload, and blood pressure regulation."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Meta-analysts have found that high-intensity interval training (HIIT) improves physical performance, but limited evidence exists regarding its effects on highly trained athletes, measures beyond maximum oxygen uptake (  V ˙   O2max), and the moderating effects of different types of HIIT. In this study, we present meta-analyses of the effects of HIIT focusing on these deficits. METHODS: The effects of 6 types of HIIT and other moderators were derived from 34 studies involving highly trained endurance and elite athletes in percent units via log-transformation from separate meta-regression mixed models for sprint, time-trial, aerobic/anaerobic threshold, peak speed/power, repeated-sprint ability,  V ˙   O2max, and exercise economy. The level of evidence for effect magnitudes was evaluated based on the effect uncertainty and the smallest important change of 1%. RESULTS: Compared with control training, HIIT showed good to excellent evidence for the substantial enhancement of most measures for some athlete subgroups in practically important study settings defined by effect moderators (maximum of 12.6%, for endurance female athletes after 6 weeks of aerobic traditional long intervals). The assessment of the moderators indicated good evidence of greater effects as follows: with more aerobic types of HIIT for  V ˙   O2max (+2.6%); with HIIT added to conventional training for most measures (+1.1-2.3%); during the competition phase for  V ˙   O2max (+4.3%); and with tests of longer duration for sprint (+5.5%) and time trial (+4.9%). The effects of sex and type of athlete were unclear moderators. The heterogeneity of HIIT effects within a given type of setting varied from small to moderate (standard deviations of 1.1%-2.3%) and reduced the evidence of benefit in some settings. CONCLUSION: Although athletes in some settings can be confident of the beneficial effects of HIIT on some measures related to competition performance, further research is needed. There is uncertainty regarding the mean effects on exercise economy and the modifying effects of sex, duration of intervention, phase of training, and type of HIIT for most measures.

This study aimed to investigate the effects of HIIT on metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD)-related biomarkers in overweight/obese adolescent girls. METHODS: Thirty-three overweight/obese adolescent girls (age, 17.0 ± 1.15 yr.; body mass index, 33.3 ± 4.77 kg/m2) were randomly assigned to HIIT (n = 17) or control (n = 16) groups. The HIIT group participated in a nine-week HIIT program (three times weekly) without caloric restriction. Maximal aerobic speed, body composition indexes, blood pressure, MASLD-related biomarkers [liver enzymes (alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST)), plasma lipids, uric acid, platelet count, and homeostasis model assessment index for insulin-resistance (HOMA-IR)] were examined at baseline and after the intervention. RESULTS: Significant \"time × group\" interactions were found for body composition indexes, systolic blood pressure, maximal aerobic speed, liver enzymes ALT and AST, plasma lipids, glucose, and HOMA-IR. The HIIT program resulted in an increase in maximal aerobic speed (p = 0.035) and a decrease in body composition and plasma lipids (p < 0.01), systolic blood pressure (p = 0.011), ALT (p = 0.013), AST (p = 0.012), and HOMA-IR (p = 0.01), but no significant changes in uric acid and platelet count. None of these markers changed in the control group. CONCLUSIONS: HIIT resulted in an improvement in MASLD-related biomarkers. HIIT could be an effective exercise therapy to prevent and reverse MASLD in adolescents with obesity.",

This study aimed to investigate the effects of high-intensity interval training (HIIT) on insulin resistance, oxidative stress, soleus muscle function, and myokine levels in a PCOS rat model. Female rats were assigned to four groups: Control, PCOS, PCOS+Exercise, and Exercise (n=15 each). PCOS was induced by subcutaneous administration of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) for 3 weeks, and exercise groups underwent HIIT for 12 weeks. Insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), serum oxidative stress markers, hormone levels (FSH, LH), soleus myokine expression, and muscle function were analyzed. Results showed that the PCOS group exhibited increased blood pressure and insulin resistance compared to controls, with a significant reduction in FSH and LH levels in the PCOS+Exercise group. Exercise improved insulin sensitivity and reduced insulin resistance in the PCOS+Exercise group. Serum oxidative stress markers did not differ significantly between groups. Soleus muscle IL-6 levels were significantly reduced in the PCOS+Exercise group. Histological analysis revealed a larger cross-sectional area of the soleus muscle in the PCOS+Exercise group compared to the PCOS group, suggesting improved muscle morphology. Furthermore, exercise improved the functional capacity of soleus muscles, as evidenced by weightlifting performance. These findings indicate that HIIT has beneficial effects on insulin resistance, reproductive hormone levels in PCOS. Exercise also shows potential in slowing oocyte loss and improving follicle health, highlighting its role as a therapeutic intervention for reproductive health in PCOS. This study suggests that HIIT could be a beneficial approach for managing PCOS, and further research is needed to better understand its underlying mechanisms and potential long-term benefits.",

Despite the large body of research investigating the effects of high-intensity interval training (HIIT) on cognitive performance, reports of its effectiveness are inconsistent and it is difficult to determine what factors moderate these effects. The purpose of this study was to conduct a meta-analysis of existing randomised controlled trials investigating the effects of HIIT on various domains of cognitive performance, and to further examine the intervention cycle and age-related moderating effects. A comprehensive literature search was conducted across a range of databases, including PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Scopus, and EBSCO. The meta-analysis included data from 20 RCT studies. The results of the analyses demonstrated that HIIT significantly enhanced information processing (SMD = 0.33, 95% CI: 0.15-0.52, P = 0.0005), executive function (SMD = 0.38, 95% CI: 0.26 - 0.50, P < 0.00001), and memory (SMD = 0.21, 95% CI: 0.07-0.35, P = 0.004). Subgroup analyses demonstrated that HIIT enhanced information processing in individuals aged 60 and above, improved executive functioning in individuals of all ages, and enhanced memory in individuals aged 30 to 60. Acute HIIT improved executive function, less than 8 weeks of HIIT improved executive function and memory, and more than 8 weeks of HIIT improved information processing, executive function and memory. The findings of this study indicate that HIIT has a beneficial effect on cognitive performance. Chronic HIIT represents a potential non-pharmacological intervention for cognitive health. Further high-quality research is required to validate and extend these findings.",

Each PE class lasted 45 min, with the HIIT regimen occupying 10 min of the warm-up phase. The HIIT sessions followed a Tabata-style structure, performed twice weekly. A two-way ANOVA with repeated measures assessed group and time interaction effects. Results: The results revealed changes in physical well-being following the HIIT intervention (p = 0.01) compared to the control group (p = 0.42). The results of the two-way ANOVA with repeated measures revealed interaction effects between group and time for the various fitness tests, countermovement jump (p = 0.04), 4 × 10 m agility test (p = 0.02), medicine ball throw test (p = 0.04), and sit-ups (30 s) (p = 0.01). Conclusions: This study highlights the effectiveness of school-based HIIT in significantly enhancing physical well-being and physical fitness among adolescents."

      "abstract": "Acute high-intensity interval training (HIIT) has cognitive benefits in individuals with methamphetamine use disorder (MUD), yet it remains largely unknown the benefits of long-term HIIT on emotional conflict control and its neural mechanism in individuals with MUD. The current study conducted a 36-week low-volume HIIT intervention to investigate the effects of HIIT on emotional conflict control in males with MUD and their prefrontal cortex (PFC) activation. This study was a sub-study of the Study for Rehabilitation Training Model Construction and Training Effect of High Intensity Compound Exercise Prescription. Forty males with MUD (31.50 ± 4.33 years) were randomly assigned to the HIIT group and control group. The HIIT group received a 36-week low-volume HIIT intervention, while the control group maintained daily physical exercise. The emotional conflict task (emotional face-word Stroop task) with functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) recording and subjective craving test were performed before and after the intervention. The results showed that the HIIT intervention reduced the emotional conflict and increased cortical activations of right dorsolateral PFC (dlPFC) and right ventrolateral PFC (vlPFC). More importantly, the HIIT-induced decreased emotional conflict was associated significantly with increased right vlPFC activation. In addition, subjective craving was also reduced after HIIT intervention. While the control group showed significant changes in neither brain activation nor the craving. These findings suggest that long-term low-volume HIIT can improve PFC activation, promote emotional conflict control, and reduce subjective craving in males with MUD. HIIT seems to be an effective method of withdrawal rehabilitation for males with MUD.",

METHODS: We enrolled fifty-nine obese women (perimenopausal and postmenopausal), aged approximately 56.6 years in a six-week HIIT program. Measurements of fitness, health, and PV were taken before and after the intervention. PV was assessed at two points during each session: at post-warm-up (PV1), and immediately post-training (PV2). These measurements were derived using hematocrit (Ht) and hemoglobin (Hb) values. RESULTS: The intervention led to notable reductions in anthropometric measures and blood pressure (P < 0.01). For all women pre- and post-HIIT comparisons revealed significant differences in the extent of PV reduction at all two points (P < 0.01). Multiple linear regression analysis revealed that age was a significant contributor to the decreases in plasma volume (PV) observed both after warm-up and following the supramaximal cycling test - SCT (r = 0.44 and r = 0.57). On the other hand, menopause status was an independent predictor for PV decreases after warm-up (r = 0.33) as well after SCT (r = 0.38). Following HIIT, only menopause status accounted for 19 % of the variation in PV decreases after warm-up and 21 % of the variation in PV decreases after SCT. CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that HIIT is effective in enhancing plasma volume among obese menopausal women, attenuating the age-related decline in PV.",

      "abstract": "Regular exercise leads to various adaptations and many pathophysiological changes that significantly benefit exercise stamina and overall health, both in the general population and in patients with chronic cardiovascular diseases. High-intensity interval training (HIIT) is a form of exercise training that consists of short repetitive bursts of intense workouts that push the body to more than 90 percent of its maximal oxygen consumption (VO2 max) and more than 75 percent of maximal power, with in between periods of low-intensity exercise for recovery, followed by a cool-down period. HIIT has unquestionably emerged as a powerful and effective intervention in rehabilitating patients, particularly those recovering from heart attacks and strokes. HIIT significantly enhances cardiovascular fitness by improving parameters such as VO2 max, endothelial function, and overall cardiac output. In addition to these cardiovascular benefits, HIIT also contributes to improved metabolic health, including better glycemic control and lipid profile regulation, which are often compromised in patients with cardiovascular conditions. Furthermore, HIIT has a positive impact on stroke patient's functional recovery and quality of life, allowing them to regain mobility, independence, and a sense of well-being more quickly. While concerns about the safety of high-intensity exercises in individuals with compromised heart function remain, current evidence suggests that when properly supervised, HIIT is both safe and well-tolerated in these populations. As healthcare continues to evolve, the incorporation of innovative and evidence-based approaches such as HIIT may redefine the future of cardiovascular rehabilitation, ultimately providing long-term health benefits for patients recovering from MI and stroke."

METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted to analyze 60 overweight children, who were randomly divided into an experimental group (high-intensity interval training) and a control group (health education as intervention). Baseline data, physical indicators, and biochemical indicators were analyzed. RESULTS: The body mass Index (BMI) of the experimental group decreased significantly more, with BMI of male and female participants showing change rates of 0.43% and 0.85%, respectively. After intervention, there were significant differences in triglycerides, total cholesterol, and lipoprotein levels between the two groups (P<0.05). After intervention, the serum tumor necrosis factor alpha levels of the experimental group showed significant differences (P<0.01), with an average value decreasing from 83.24 ng/L to 64.37 ng/L, and their C-reactive protein values also showed good intergroup and intragroup statistical differences (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: High-intensity interval training can effectively improve the physical fitness of overweight children, regulate their inflammatory factors, and help with weight loss."

However, their respective effects on enjoyment and affective responses remain contentious. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this meta-analysis is to evaluate and compare the effectiveness of HIIT and MICT on enjoyment and affective responses in overweight or obese people, and to find the most appropriate exercise mode for overweight or obese people. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study was conducted following PRISMA guidelines and the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. A comprehensive search was performed across databases including Cochrane, EMBASE, PubMed, and Web of Science, with a cutoff date of August 2024. Data extraction and organization were carried out using Excel, and Review manager was used to evaluate the quality of the literature and to analyze and process the data. The Stata was used to test publication bias. RESULTS: A total of 16 articles were included in the literature, and a total of 537 participants met the inclusion criteria, including 213 participants in HIIT, 183 participants in MICT, 84 participants in alternating HIIT and MICT, and 57 participants in other forms of intervention (self-selected intensity exercise, very-high-intensity interval exercise, repetitive sprint training, and blank control). All study participants were between the ages of 18-70 years old, and the duration of the intervention ranged from 1 to 16 weeks. Enjoyment and affective effects of HIIT and MICT were analyzed using the Physical Activity Enjoyment Scale, Feeling Scale and Felt Arousal Scale. CONCLUSION: Both HIIT and MICT can bring about similar enjoyable and positive affective responses in overweight and obese people, HIIT caused participants to experience higher enjoyment and similar affect responses compared to MICT.",

      "abstract": "High-intensity interval training (HIIT) interventions are typically prescribed according to several laboratory-based parameters and fixed reference intensities to accurately calibrate exercise intensity. Repeated all-out printing efforts, or sprint interval training, is another form of HIIT that is prescribed without individual reference intensity as it is performed in maximal intensities. No previous study has performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate the effect of HIIT and SIT on cardiometabolic health markers in children and adolescents. Moreover, previous studies have focused on single risk factors and exercise modalities, which may restrict their ability to capture a complete picture of the factors that could be affected by different interval interventions. The present study aimed to conduct a novel meta-analysis on the effects of HIIT and SIT on multiple cardiometabolic health markers in children and adolescents. An electronic search was conducted in three main online databases including PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus were searched from inception to July 2024 to identify randomized and non-randomized control trials comparing HIIT and SIT versus the non-exercise control group in children and adolescents with mean age ranges from 6 to 18 years old on cardiometabolic health markers including fasting glucose and insulin, insulin resistance, triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL), systolic blood (SBP) and diastolic blood (DBP) pressures. Standardized mean differences (SMD), weighted mean differences (WMD), and confidence were calculated using a random effect model. HIIT decreased insulin, insulin resistance, TG, TC, LDL, and SBP and increased HDL but did not decrease glucose and DBP. Furthermore, subgroup analyses show that insulin and insulin resistance were decreased by sprint interval training (SIT) and in those with obesity. Lipid profile mainly is improved by SIT and in those with obesity. Also, SBP was decreased by SIT and in those with obesity. Our results prove that HIIT is an effective intervention for improving cardiometabolic health in children and adolescents, mainly those with obesity. Specifically, SIT is an effective interval training mode in children and adolescents.",

We reviewed randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that focused their intervention on HIIT for people with MS to improve exercise capacity or fatigue. Two researchers performed the search process independently in the different databases and assessed methodological quality and risk of bias. RESULTS: Eleven studies were included in the systematic review and seven of them were meta-analyzed. The overall pooled effect favored HIIT interventions in improving exercise capacity (SMD = 0.29; 95% CI = 0-05,0.53; p = 0.02) and reducing fatigue (SMD = -0.26; 95% CI = -0.50, -0.02; p = 0.03) in people with MS. We generally found a low risk of bias and a good methodological quality. CONCLUSION: The results of this review and meta-analysis provide evidence that HIIT interventions improved and reduced fatigue in people with MS. HIIT intervention may be a good option to improve exercise capacity and reduce fatigue of these people."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF), as assessed by VO2peak, along with metabolic and cardiovascular health indices, represents the strongest predictors of survival. However, it remains unclear whether concurrent high-intensity interval training (HIIT) and resistance training (RT) can similarly enhance these health markers in patients with type-1 diabetes (T1D) or type-2 diabetes (T2D) compared to healthy individuals. METHODS: Adults with uncomplicated T1D or T2D and healthy normoglycemic controls matched for sex and age (HC1 and HC2) performed 3 training sessions/week of concurrent HIIT and RT for 12 weeks. Pre- and post-intervention assessments included: lipids and glycemic profile, body composition (dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry) and a cyclo-ergometric cardio-pulmonary exercise test. RESULTS: Training improved VO2peak, the ventilatory threshold (VT1), maximal workload, ventilation and O2pulse, similarly in T1D in HC1 without changes in body composition or glycemic profile. In patients with T2D, training improved insulin sensitivity (HOMA-IR), lean mass, VE/VCO2 slope, VT1 and maximal O2pulse, workload and VO2peak with reduction in fat mass and visceral adipose tissue (VAT) (all, p < 0.05). However, improvements in VO2peak and O2pulse were lower than in healthy controls (respectively, T2D: +9%, HC2: +18% and T2D: +6%, HC2: +19%, p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Both patients with T1D and T2D benefit from combined HIIT and RT by improving CRF with specific adaptations influenced by the presence and type of diabetes. While identical magnitude of achievements were observed in T1D and HC1, T2D patients exhibited lower VO2peak and maximal O2pulse improvements but associated with notable additional health benefits regarding insulin sensitivity, body composition, visceral adipose tissue and ventilatory efficiency."

The aim of this study was to examine the impact of HIIT on health-related fitness in adolescents. METHODS: The total sample consisted of 60 adolescents (age 16.33 ± 0.62 years) from secondary Grammar school, randomly divided into two groups: the experimental (EG) (30) and the control group (CG) (30). The experimental program (12-weeks; 2 times per week) involved two Tabata sessions during one physical education class lasting 4 min each. Participants were tested for health-related fitness components-cardiorespiratory fitness (The Shuttle Run Test (SRT) and strength, hand grip test, standing long jump (SLJ) and counter movement jump (CMJ). RESULTS: Both the EG and the CG experienced significant positive changes in SRT (meters) and VO2max values compared to baseline value (p < 0.05), however, the increase in the EG was significantly higher than that in the CG (SRT - ηp 2 = 0.111; VO2max - ηp 2 = 0.111, p < 0.01). The EG showed significant improvement in SRT (meters) and VO2max values compared to the CG (p < 0.01). Regarding the hand grip test results, a significant time × group interaction was found only for right hand (p < 0.01). Moreover, the improvements in SLJ and CMJ values was greater in EG than that in the CG group (SLJ- ηp 2 = 0.182; CMJ- ηp 2 = 0.112, p < 0.01). CONCLUSION: Findings indicate that HIIT implemented into physical education classes can result in significant improvements in selected health related fitness components in adolescents."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: High-intensity interval training (HIIT) has been shown to improve chronic diseases. Probiotics have been found to have similar effects. However, the additive effects of HIIT in combination with probiotics supplementation are unclear. The aim of current study was to investigate whether there were additive effects when implementing both HIIT and probiotics simultaneously. METHODS: Forty-seven obese middle-aged women (Age: 44.5 ± 5.94 years, body fat percentage: 40.0 ± 4.1%) were recruited and assigned into four groups: control group (C, n = 12), probiotics group (P, n = 12), HIIT group (H, n = 11), and HIIT with probiotics group (HP, n = 12). All the participants consumed probiotics (Lactiplantibacillus plantarum TWK10, 6 × 1010 CFU/day) or placebo supplements daily. Exercise intervention groups conducted HIIT training (85-90% vVO2max for 2 min, followed by a 1-min inactive rest interval, repeated for 7 cycles) 3 sessions per week for 8 weeks. Anthropometry, cardiorespiratory endurance, blood glucose, and lipid profile were measured at baseline and after the 8-week intervention. RESULTS: After the intervention, there were significant changes between groups in the variations and rates of change in waist circumference, hip circumference, and TTE. The waist circumference in group H significantly increased compared to groups C and P, while group HP did not show significant difference compared to group C. On the other hand, the hip circumference decreased significantly in group HP compared to group C, and the decreased rate in group HP was significantly greater than in groups C and P. Furthermore, the increase rates in TTE were higher in group H and HP compared to group C. CONCLUSION: HIIT improves TTE but negatively affects waist circumference compared to the control group. However, when combined with probiotics, the probiotics not only help enhance TTE but also counteract the negative impact on waist circumference and further reduce hip circumference, resulting in a synergistic effect.

OBJECTIVES: The aims were to (1) identify the characteristics of HIIT and the formats that have been prescribed, (2) analyze which anchors have been utilized to prescribe effort and pause intensity, (3) examine characteristics of the physical tests used for HIIT prescription, and (4) identify potential adverse events related to HIIT intervention. METHODS: This scoping review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) guidelines, including PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases. RESULTS: A total of 51 studies were retrieved, and the following results were found: (1) Only 25 studies reported all four essential variables for HIIT prescription [effort intensity (effort duration): pause intensity (pause duration)]. Of these studies, 23 used active pause and employed the following prescription (on average): [84% (116 s): 39% (118 s)] when percentage of maximal aerobic power (MAP) [maximal/peak oxygen uptake ( V O2max/peak)/MAP] was used; [124% (161 s): 55% (142 s)] when percentage of anaerobic threshold (AT) was used; [83% (230 s): 62% (165 s)] when maximal heart rate percentage (%HRmax) was used. From these 23 studies, 12 used V O2max/peak/MAP (one of the most recommended variables for HIIT prescription). Seven studies adopted the HIIT-long format, and in the remaining five studies, the format was unclear. (2) Twenty-four studies used fractions of V O2max/peak or mechanical variables like MAP as anchors for prescribing effort intensity, two studies used AT, 20 studies used fractions of HRmax/heart rate reserve, two studies used rate of perceived exertion (RPE), while one used RPE and % V O2peak concomitantly, and two studies utilized RPE/%HRmax concomitantly. Two studies utilized passive resting, 12 studies used % V O2peak/%MAP for prescribing pause intensity, four studies used AT, seven studies used %HRmax, one study used %HRmax/% V O2peak, and two studies used absolute loads. (3) Ten studies did not report the characteristics of the physical tests employed, two studies used submaximal tests, and 39 studies utilized graded exercise tests. (4) Ten studies did not report if there were adverse events associated with the exercise program, while 34 studies did not report any adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: Only 50% of the studies provided all the necessary variables for accurate HIIT prescription, raising concerns about the replicability, comprehension, and effective application of HIIT in cancer patients. Most of the studies that reported all variables appeared to have employed the HIIT-long format. Only a few studies used more individualized anchors (e.g., AT) to prescribe HIIT-long format for cancer patients, which is considered a very heterogeneous population.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to compare the effects of high-intensity interval training (HIIT) combined with resistance training (RT) versus HIIT alone on body composition, cardiorespiratory fitness and glycolipid metabolism in young women with overweight/obesity. METHODS: This randomized controlled trial divided 40 subjects into an experimental group (HIIT+RT) and a control group (HIIT). Both groups underwent training three times per week for eight weeks. Body composition, cardiorespiratory fitness and glycolipid levels were assessed before and after the intervention. RESULTS: The results revealed that compared to baseline, both the experimental and control groups showed significant improvements in body weight, body mass index (BMI), Body fat, waist circumference (WC), waist-hip ratio (WHR), peak oxygen uptake (VO2peak), vital capacity (VC), oxygen pulse (VO2/HR), minute ventilation, resting heart rate, blood oxygen saturation, blood pressure, fasting blood glucose, triglycerides and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (p<0.05). Additionally, a significant increase in muscle mass and a significant reduction in 2-hour postprandial glucose were observed in the experimental group (p<0.05). Muscle mass (mean difference: 2.75%), VO2peak (mean difference: 1.61 mL/min/kg), VC (mean difference: 334mL), and VO2/HR (mean difference: 0.51mL/beat) showed greater improvement in the HIIT+RT group compared to the HIIT group (p<0.05). CONCLUSION: In conclusion, an 8-week regimen of either combined HIIT and RT or HIIT significantly improves body composition, cardiorespiratory fitness and glycolipid metabolism in women with overweight/obesity. However, the combined training appears to offer more benefits than HIIT alone. Further research is needed to evaluate the long-term effects and feasibility of combined training.

      "abstract": "Human skeletal muscle displays an epigenetic memory of resistance exercise induced-hypertrophy. It is unknown, however, whether high-intensity interval training (HIIT) also evokes an epigenetic muscle memory. This study used repeated training intervention interspersed with a detraining period to assess epigenetic memory of HIIT. Twenty healthy subjects (25 ± 5 yr) completed two HIIT interventions (training and retraining) lasting 2 mo, separated by 3 mo of detraining. Measurements at baseline, after training, detraining, and retraining included maximal oxygen consumption (V̇o2max). Vastus lateralis biopsies were taken for genome-wide DNA methylation and targeted gene expression analyses. V̇o2max improved during training and retraining (P < 0.001) without differences between interventions (P > 0.58). Thousands of differentially methylated positions (DMPs) predominantly demonstrated a hypomethylated state after training, retained even after 3-mo of exercise cessation and into retraining. Five genes, ADAM19, INPP5a, MTHFD1L, CAPN2, and SLC16A3, possessed differentially methylated regions (DMRs) with retained hypomethylated memory profiles and increased gene expression. The retained hypomethylation during detraining was associated with an enhancement in expression of the same genes even after 3 mo of detraining. SLC16A3, INPP5a, and CAPN2 are involved in lactate transport and calcium signaling. Despite similar physiological adaptations between training and retraining, memory profiles were found at epigenetic and gene expression level, characterized by retained hypomethylation and increased gene expression after training into long-term detraining and retraining. These genes were associated with calcium signaling and lactate transport. Although significant memory was not observed in physiological parameters, our novel findings indicate that human skeletal muscle possesses an epigenetic memory of HIIT.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Cells possess a \"memory\" such that adaptations can be more quickly regained when a previously encountered challenge is reintroduced. Exercise provides an excellent experimental model to explore the concept of cellular memory to physiologically relevant stressors in humans. This study highlights molecular mechanisms that contribute to muscle memory in response to high-intensity interval training in humans, showing retention of DNA methylation and gene expression profiles from earlier training into detraining and retraining.",

      "abstract": "Evidence-based guidelines suggest that High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) is more beneficial than aerobic exercise for patients with cardiovascular disease, but the differences in underlying pathophysiological mechanisms require further confirmation. The comparison between HIIT and Moderate-Intensity Continuous Training (MICT) in regulating vascular dysfunction in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR), along with their underlying mechanisms, has not been previously reported. The purpose of this study is to provide an experimental basis for exercise prescription therapy in hypertensive patients. In this study, six-week-old male SHR were randomly assigned to a HIIT group, MICT group, or sedentary group. Wistar Kyoto rats (WKY) of the same age were used as the control group. The weight, heart rate, and blood pressure of the rats were monitored weekly throughout twelve weeks of treadmill training. At the end of the protocol, serum and aortic vascular tissues were collected for further vascular function tests and molecular and biochemical analyses. The results show that MICT is more favorable for weight control than HIIT, while both forms of exercise offer equal protection against hypertension. However, MICT demonstrates a greater benefit in preserving vascular morphology, whereas HIIT is more effective in reducing oxidative stress. Both HIIT and MICT ameliorate vascular dysfunction in SHR by suppressing nucleotide-binding domain and leucine-rich repeat pyrin-domain containing protein 3 (NLRP3)-induced pyroptosis. The superior effect of HIIT on vascular dysfunction may be related to the inhibition of oxidative stress injury through AMPKα-SIRT1 activation. This study provides insight into the dose-effect relationship of exercise for cardiovascular health and offers foundational evidence for the development of exercise prescription therapies."

We compared the effects of resistance training (RT) and high-intensity interval training (HIIT) on these outcomes in survivors of breast cancer. METHODS: Twenty-eight survivors of breast cancer, post-treatment (Stage I-III), aged 55.5 ± 8.8 years and body mass index 27.9 ± 5 kg/m2 were randomly allocated to a 12-week supervised RT (n = 14) or HIIT (n = 14) intervention, 3 days per week. Body composition (dual energy x-ray absorptiometry), upper and lower body muscle strength (1-repetition maximum), cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) (Ekblom Bak Cycle Test), and QoL domains (EORTC QLQ-C30 and EORTC QLQ-BR45) were assessed at baseline and 12 weeks. RESULTS: There were no significant differences between groups at baseline. Exercise attendance ranged from 81 to 85%. Between groups, there were significant differences (p ≤ 0.001) after 12 weeks in chest press strength for RT (mean difference [MD] = 4.7 kg) and CRF for HIIT (MD = 1.9 ml/min/kg). Within groups, there were significant improvements (p < 0.05) for % lean mass and % fat mass in both RT and HIIT, as well as for upper and lower body muscle strength, CRF, and QoL domains. No major adverse events were noted. CONCLUSION: Both exercise groups improved body composition, physical fitness, and QoL domains over 12 weeks of RT or HIIT, although mode-specific benefits were apparent with more substantial improvements in lean mass and muscle strength with RT and reductions in % fat mass and improved CRF with HIIT. Tailored exercise programs should address the specific health needs of each patient.",

      "abstract": "UNLABELLED: Women with breast cancer (BC) experience multiple symptoms related to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) treatment that impair their functioning and quality of life (QoL). This study aimed to explore the effect of high-intensity aerobic interval training (HIIT) on quality of life and NAC side effects in women with BC. METHODS: 56 patients (48.56 (7.84) years, range 35-64 years) diagnosed locally advanced (stage II-III) ER + BC receiving doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide-based NAC were randomly assigned to the HIIT group and a control group (CG) for 6 months. The HIIT group performed 2 to 3 HIIT sessions per week according to the study protocol (4 × 4 minutes at 85%-95% peak heart rate (HR)). The CG followed the standard of care instructions by the oncologists. To assess the QoL participants completed the EORTC QLQ-C30 with the additional BC module of QLQ BR-23. Weekly self-reports on NAC side effects were collected through online survey. RESULTS: Study data were analyzed for 37 participants (nHIIT = 17, nCON = 20) who reported at least 14 (60%) weeks. HIIT was effective to reduce BC symptom scale outcomes (ES = 0.113, P = .048), and alleviate systemic therapy side effects (ES = 0.154, P = .020) and cancer related symptoms (ES = 0.124, P = .038). The most common side effect participants experienced at least 1 to 4 days/week was pain (average 50.9% and 56.8% for HIIT and CG, respectively), followed by sleep disturbances (average 50.9% and 49.9%, respectively). About 31% in both groups experienced sleep disturbances 5 to 7 days/week. The NAC induced physical, social and fatigue side effects had significantly lower incidence in HIIT group, while psychological side effects were significantly more common in training group. CONCLUSIONS: HIIT is an effective physical exercise program to maintain higher quality of life and help to reduce some of NAC induced side effects for women with BC.",

Sixty-eight participants (age = 42 ± 10.2; 20-60 years; BMI = 29.8 ± 3.7) were analysed across four groups: HIIT (n = 15, 4 males, 11 females), VLCHF (n = 19, 4 males, 15 females), VLCHF + HIIT (n = 19, 4 males, 15 females), and control (n = 15, 4 males, 11 females). The 12-week intervention, involved VLCHF diet or HIIT sessions, depending on group affiliation and completing online questionnaires via Qualtrics software before and after the intervention. The questionnaires included the 12-item Short Form Survey (SF-12) for mental (MHS) and physical health scores (PHS), the Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS), and the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS). Using the Kruskal-Wallis test, we found no significant differences in mental health-related indicators between groups after 12 weeks, except for SWLS (p = 0.031; ES = 0.133; medium), which improved significantly in the VLCHF + HIIT group compared to the HIIT group. Our findings indicate that HIIT and VLCHF, alone or combined, do not significantly affect mental health-related indicators.",

High-intensity interval training (HIIT) is effective in this regard in the general population, but there is a lack of evidence of its effectiveness during pregnancy. This study aimed to compare an 8-week HIIT program to self-performed moderate-to-vigorous physical activity among pregnant women by evaluating changes in BP after a maximal progressive cardiorespiratory exercise test (CPET) performed at pre-intervention and post-intervention time points. A total of 54 Caucasian women in uncomplicated, singleton pregnancies (age 32 ± 4 years, 22 ± 4 weeks of gestation; M ± SD) with normal BP values completed the interventions. The experimental (HIIT) group (n = 34) completed an online supervised HIIT program consisting of three sessions per week and supplemented by an educational class once per week. Participants in the education (EDU) group (n = 20) attended an educational class once per week and were encouraged to perform moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (PA) on their own. Pre- and post-intervention, all women underwent a CPET on a cycle ergometer with a respiratory gas analyzer. On the day of the CPET, maternal systolic and diastolic BP (mmHg) was measured at rest (before the CPET) and approximately 60 min after the CPET using an electronic BP monitor. Identical CPET and BP measurement protocols were employed for both the HIIT and EDU groups at the pre- and post-intervention time points. Pre-intervention, the HIIT and EDU groups both showed a decrease in systolic and diastolic BP after the CPET, though only the change in systolic BP was statistically significant (HIIT group: p = 0.01; EDU group: p = 0.001). Post-intervention, there were no significant differences in either group between resting and post-CPET BP. There were significant post-intervention differences in VO2peak (p < 0.001) and HRmax (p = 0.002) between the HIIT and EDU groups. From pre- to post-intervention, the EDU and HIIT groups both showed decreases in resting systolic or diastolic BP; there was a significant difference in systolic BP in the EDU group (p = 0.005) and a significant difference in diastolic BP in the HIIT group (p = 0.03). Both groups maintained normal BP values throughout the experiment. However, HIIT, in addition to maintaining normotension, improved cardiorespiratory fitness in pregnant women. It seems that both supervised HIIT and self-performed moderate-to-vigorous PA can be recommended as strategies to prevent BP disorders during pregnancy. More studies are needed to confirm our findings.Trial registration The full study protocol was registered in ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT05009433).",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Superior physical fitness and performance are essential in male team sports. Among a myriad of training methodologies, high-intensity interval training (HIIT) has gained popularity owing to its unparalleled efficiency and effectiveness. Previous studies have established that HIIT is a proven and effective approach for enhancing various physiological performance outcomes, particularly oxygen consumption capacity, in individual sports. Despite potential differences in training practices between male and female athletes, HIIT is recognized as an anaerobic training approach for team-sport athletes. This systematic review aimed to comprehensively and innovatively analyze the existing literature to examine the effectiveness of HIIT on oxygen consumption performance among male team-sport athletes. METHODS: A comprehensive literature search was conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines across the PubMed, SCOPUS, Web of Science, and SPORTDiscus databases until December 31, 2023. The inclusion criteria for this review encompassed research articles published in peer-reviewed journals that specifically focused on the impact of HIIT on the oxygen consumption performance of male players engaged in team sports. The study population exclusively consisted of male participants. The collected data included study characteristics, participant demographics, intervention details, and outcomes. Methodological quality assessment was performed using standardized criteria. The effect sizes (ESs) were calculated, and a meta-analysis was conducted using a random-effects model. RESULTS: The literature search yielded 13 eligible studies encompassing 286 athletes aged 14-26 years. The meta-analysis showed statistically significant enhancements in maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max) in six studies (ES, 0.19-0.74; p < 0.005), Yo-Yo Intermittent Recovery Test (YYIRT) performance in six studies (ES, 0.20-2.07; p = 0.009), repeated-sprint ability total time (RSAtotal) in five studies (ES, 0.18-1.33; p < 0.001), and the best and average times for repeated-sprint ability (RSAbest and RSAmean, respectively) in four studies (ES, 0.47-1.50; p < 0.001). However, two studies did not report any significant differences in the outcomes of the Velocity in 30-15 Intermittent Fitness Test (VIFT) between the experimental and control groups (ES, -0.08 and -0.27; p = 0.87 and 0.443, respectively). Moreover, one study did not report any significant differences in the maximal aerobic speed (MAS) (ES, 0.41, p = 0.403). CONCLUSIONS: HIIT significantly improved VO2max, YYIRT, and RSA; however, it did not appear to enhance VIFT and MAS performance, irrespective of age or competition level. These findings indicate that HIIT could serve as a valuable method for improving oxygen consumption performance (VO2max, YYIRT, and RSA) in male team-sport athletes, offering a time-efficient alternative to the traditional training methods. Further research is warranted to investigate its impact on performance outcomes in competitive settings and identify optimal HIIT protocols tailored to specific team sports.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: High-intensity interval training (HIIT) is an effective strategy for improving a variety of health and fitness outcomes within school settings. Incorporating HIIT into existing physical activity opportunities appears practically feasible, yet the process evaluation and effectiveness of this strategy needs to be further evaluated. Therefore, a PRO-HIIT intervention will be conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of a 12-week school-based HIIT intervention on cardiorespiratory fitness, physical activity, body composition, muscular strength, bone health, cognitive function, wellbeing and academic performance among 12-13-year-olds. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Eight classes of year 7 students (12-13-year-olds) from a secondary school in Ningbo, China, will be recruited and randomly allocated into an intervention or control group. While the control group maintains their usual activities, a 6 to 10 min HIIT session will be embedded in the physical education or physical activity lessons five days a week for 12 weeks for the intervention group. Training workshops will be conducted for participants, teachers, and research staff for facilitating the intervention. Outcome data will be collected at three time points: pre- and post-intervention, and two months (summer holiday) upon completion of the intervention. Linear mixed models will be used to analyse the impact of groups (intervention and control), timepoints (pre-, post- and two-month after intervention) and group by time interactions. The implementation process of the intervention will be evaluated using a process evaluation framework. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethics approval is obtained from the Ningbo University Ethics Committee (TY2024002). Results from PRO-HIIT study will be disseminated via peer-reviewed journals, scientific conferences as well as local education system. The study protocol has been retrospectively registered on ClinicalTrials.gov Protocol Registration and Results System (NCT06374732), https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06374732."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is a protein important for synaptic plasticity and formation of memory. It is suggested to play an important role in the development of psychiatric disorders like post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Individuals with PTSD usually show decreased BDNF levels in serum. Physical exercise has shown to be effective in increasing serum BDNF levels. OBJECTIVE: As the most beneficial form of exercise to raise serum BDNF levels in individuals with PTSD is yet to be determined, we compared two training protocols and their effects on BDNF release. We expected that a training with higher intensity increases BDNF serum levels more than a low intensity training (LIT). METHOD: 40 participants (80% female) diagnosed with PTSD were randomized to either high-intensity interval training (HIIT) or a low intensity training group (LIT). They underwent a 12-day training period. We measured serum BDNF levels pre- and post-exercise on first and last intervention day. BDNF was controlled for platelet counts. RESULTS: In the HIIT group there was a significant increase in serum BDNF post-exercise on both days measured, respectively when controlled for platelets. The increase was transient. Both groups did not show an increase in serum BDNF over the course of the 12-day training period. CONCLUSION: A single session of HIIT raised serum BDNF levels in individuals with PTSD transiently. Neither HIIT nor LIT raised serum BDNF levels over the course of 12 days.",

      "abstract": "Recent studies have highlighted the role of mitophagy in tumorigenesis. This study aimed to investigate the effects of high-intensity interval training (HIIT) on mitophagy in tumor tissues of mice with breast cancer. Twenty-eight female BALB/c mice were randomly assigned to four groups: Healthy Control (CO), Cancer (CA), Exercise (EX), and Cancer + Exercise (CA + EX). Mammary tumors were induced in the CA and CA + EX groups via 4T1 cell injections. Upon confirmation of tumor formation, the EX and CA + EX groups underwent 8 weeks (40 sessions) of HIIT, comprising 4-10 intervals of running at 80-100 % of maximum speed. The expression levels of mitophagy-related proteins, including parkin, PTEN-induced putative kinase 1 (PINK1), NIP3-like protein X (NIX), BCL2 interacting protein-3 (BINP3), microtubule-associated protein light chain 3-I (LC3-I), microtubule-associated protein light chain 3-II (LC3-II), AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), Unc-51 like autophagy activating kinase-1 (ULK1), and sirtuin-1 (SIRT1), were measured in breast and tumor tissues. Tumor volume relative to body weight was assessed weekly during the eight-week HIIT intervention. Protein expression of parkin, PINK1, NIX, BINP3, LC3-II, LC3-I, AMPK, ULK1, and SIRT1 was reduced in the breast tissue of the CA group, while HIIT restored expression levels across all measured variables (P < 0.01). Additionally, tumor volume relative to body weight was significantly lower in the CA + EX group compared to the CA group from weeks 3-8 (P < 0.01). These findings suggest that breast cancer suppresses mitophagy, yet HIIT effectively reverses this suppression, potentially reducing tumor burden. HIIT may thus represent a promising therapeutic strategy for managing breast cancer.",

In addition, the search for alternative therapies for weight loss has intensified. The administration of Hibiscus sabdariffa (Hs) has been described as an efficient supplement in weight loss and in the treatment of metabolic changes associated with obesity. In this context, the objective was to investigate the effects of the association of Hs and HIIT on metabolic adaptations and lipid metabolism in obese rats. Wistars rats were subjected to obesity and subsequently randomized into 4 groups: obese (Ob), obese + HS (ObHs), obese + HIIT (ObHIIT), and obese + HS + HIIT (ObHsHIIT). For 8 weeks, ObHs and ObHsHIIT rats received Hs extract daily (150 mg/kg of body weight) and trained groups (ObHIIT and ObHsHIIT) were subjected to a HIIT program on a treadmill. Nutritional profile, glycemic curve, biochemical profile, and liver glycogen were determined. HIIT decreased caloric intake, feed efficiency, body adiposity, total body fat, and body weight gain, associated with improvements in physical performance parameters and a smaller glycemic curve and area. Hs had a hepatoprotective effect, reducing alkaline phosphatase values, but its effects were more pronounced when associated with HIIT. Therefore, the combination of treatments promoted a reduction in food consumption and body adiposity, as well as an improvement in physical performance and glycemic profile, but without changes in lipid metabolism.",

Notably, fructose feeding increased the DNL. Lifestyle modifications resulting from dietary changes and increased physical activity/exercise can decrease the IHL content. We examined the effects of vitamin D3 supplementation (VDS), high-intensity interval training (HIIT), and their combination on the transcription factors and enzymes of the DNL pathway in male Sprague‒Dawley rats fed a high-fructose diet (HFrD). METHODS: Forty male rats were assigned to 5 groups (n = 8): CS (the control group had a standard diet); CF (the control group had HFrD (10% (w/v) fructose solution in tap water)); and FT (HFrD + HIIT: 10 bouts of 4 min of high-intensity running, corresponding to 85-90% of the maximal speed with 2 min active rest periods of 50% maximal speed, 5 days per week); FD (HFrD + intervention of intraperitoneal injection of 10000 IU/kg/week VDS); FTD (HFrD + HIIT + VDS) that were maintained for 12 weeks. ELISA, the GOD-POD assay, folch, western blotting, and oil red O staining were used to determine insulin, fasting blood glucose (FBG), hepatic triglyceride (TG) and cholesterol levels; SREBP1c, ChREBP-β, ACC1, FASN, p-ACC1, AMPK, p-AMPK, and PKA protein expression; and IHL content, respectively. RESULTS: Both HIIT and VDS led to significant increases in the levels of PKA, AMPK, p-AMPK, and p-ACC1, as well as significant decreases in the levels of SREBP1c, ChREBP-β, ACC1, FASN, insulin, FBG, liver TG, liver cholesterol, and IHL. HIIT exhibited superior efficacy over VDS in reducing ChREBP-β, ACC1, insulin, FBG, liver TG and cholesterol, as well as increasing p-ACC1 and PKA. Notably, the combined intervention of HIIT and VDS yielded the most substantial improvements across all the parameters. CONCLUSIONS: HFrD causes IHL accumulation and the onset of diabetes, whereas VDS and HIIT, along with their combined effects, prevent the consequences of HFrD.",

METHODS: Thirty-seven children (94.6% with obesity; 45.9% girls), with a mean age of 10.4 (±1.8) years and a mean body mass index (BMI) z-score of 3.31 (±1.09) were recruited to use the app during 6 weeks. Assessments were performed at baseline, 6 (end of intervention), and 12 weeks (follow up). RESULTS: Thirty-two (86.3%) participants completed both intervention and follow-up assessments and were analyzed. On average, children used the HIIT app 2.5 times per week (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.9 to 3.0), with the highest perceived exertion of 4.1 (95% CI: 3.6 to 4.5). No over-time differences were found in body composition, physical activity, screen time, sleep duration, or water intake after the intervention; however, an over-time decrease in sugary beverages intake (Δ-0.9, 95% CI: -1.6 to -0.1, p = .019). No differences in body composition were found at follow up. Although none of the children or parents perceived impairments in nutritional behavior, general wellbeing, or fitness as a consequence of intervention, most children (64.5%), but not parents, perceived improvements in nutritional behavior and general wellbeing. CONCLUSION: Although feasible, the 6-week effect of HIIT app use is modest or absent regarding body composition, movement, and nutritional behavior change, probably due to its low volume. More studies are needed to explore the utility of HIIT apps as a remote exercise support strategy for children with obesity further."

We hypothesized that adding high-intensity interval training (HIIT) to a multidisciplinary lifestyle intervention would improve BMI z-score (primary outcome), waist circumference, blood pressure, and health-related quality of life (HRQOL). METHODS: This randomized controlled trial included 173 children and adolescents with obesity. Participants were allocated to 12-months lifestyle intervention (N = 83), or 12-month lifestyle intervention accompanied by a 12-week HIIT program (N = 90). HIIT consisted of three weekly sessions and included activities eliciting intensities >85% of maximal heart rate. RESULTS: Attendance rate for the 3-months HIIT intervention was 68.0 ± 23.2%. Dropout was lower in HIIT compared to control at three months (7.8% vs. 20.5%) and 12 months (26.5% vs 48.2%). Changes in BMI z-score did not differ between HIIT and control at 3 months (Mean Difference (MD): 0.01, 95% confidence interval (CI): -0.09; 0.12, P = 0.82) or 12 months (MD: 0.06, CI: -0.07;0.19, P = 0.34). Across randomization, BMI z-score was reduced by 0.11 (CI: 0.17; 0.06, P < 0.01) at 3 months and 0.20 (CI: 0.26;0.14, P < 0.01) at 12 months. At 3 months, HIIT experienced a greater increase in HRQOL of 2.73 (CI: 0.01;5.44, P = 0.05) in PedsQL Child total-score and 3.85 (CI: 0.96; 6.74, P < 0.01) in psychosocial health-score compared to control. At 12 months, PedsQL Child physical-score was reduced by 6.89 (CI: 10.97; 2.83, P < 0.01) in HIIT compared to control. No group differences or changes over time were found for waist circumference or blood pressure. CONCLUSION: Adding a 12-week HIIT program did not further augment the positive effects of a 12-month lifestyle intervention on BMI z-score. Adding HIIT improved HRQOL after 3 months, but reduced HRQOL at 12 months. Implementation of HIIT in community-based settings was feasible and showed positive effects on adherence to the lifestyle intervention.",

However, the volume of this type of training is not well established. OBJECTIVE: To assess the impact of two volumes of HIIT, low (LV-HIIT, <10 min at high intensity) and high (HV-HIIT, >10 min at high intensity), on vascular-endothelial function in individuals after an acute myocardial infarction (AMI). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Clinical trial in 80 AMI patients (58.4 ± 8.3 years, 82.5% men) with three study groups: LV-HIIT (n = 28) and HV-HIIT (n = 28) with two sessions per week for 16 weeks and control group (CG, n = 24) with unsupervised physical activity recommendations. Endothelial function (brachial flow-mediated dilation, FMD), atherosclerosis (carotid intima-media thickness ultrasound, cIMT), and levels of oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL) as a marker of oxidative stress were determined before and after the intervention period. RESULTS: After the intervention, in the exercise groups, there was an increase in FMD (LV-HIIT, ↑58.8%; HV-HIIT, ↑94.1%; p < 0.001) concurrently with a decrease in cIMT (LV-HIIT, ↓3.0%; HV-HIIT, ↓3.2%; p = 0.019) and LDLox (LV-HIIT, ↓5.2%; HV-HIIT, ↓8.9%; p < 0.001), with no significant changes in the CG. Furthermore, a significant inverse correlation was observed between ox-LDL and endothelial function related to the volume of HIIT training performed (LV-HIIT: r = -0.376, p = 0.031; HV-HIIT: r = -0.490, p < 0.004), with no significance in the CG (r = 0.021, p = 0.924). CONCLUSION: In post-AMI patients, HIIT may lead to a volume-dependent enhancement in endothelial function, attributed to a decrease in oxidative stress, with added beneficial effects in reducing vascular wall thickness. An LV-HIIT program, with less than 10 min at high intensity per session, has proven enough efficiency to initiate favorable vascular-endothelial adaptations, potentially reducing cardiovascular risk among patients with coronary artery disease.

While exercise training is the cornerstone in the non-pharmacological treatment of COPD, there is a need for new exercise training methods due to suboptimal adaptations when following traditional exercise guidelines, often applying moderate-intensity continuous training (MICT). In people with COPD, short-duration high-intensity interval training (HIIT) holds the potential to induce a more optimal stimulus for training adaptations while circumventing the ventilatory burden often associated with MICT in people with COPD. We aim to determine the effects of supramaximal HIIT and MICT on extrapulmonary manifestations in people with COPD compared to matched healthy controls. METHODS: COPD-HIIT is a prospective, multi-centre, randomized, controlled trial with blinded assessors and data analysts, employing a parallel-group designed trial. In phase 1, we will investigate the effects and mechanisms of a 12-week intervention of supramaximal HIIT compared to MICT in people with COPD (n = 92) and matched healthy controls (n = 70). Participants will perform watt-based cycling two to three times weekly. In phase 2, we will determine how exercise training and inflammation impact the trajectories of neurodegeneration, in people with COPD, over 24 months. In addition to the 92 participants with COPD performing HIIT or MICT, a usual care group (n = 46) is included in phase 2. In both phases, the primary outcomes are a change from baseline in cognitive function, cardiorespiratory fitness, and muscle power. Key secondary outcomes include change from baseline exercise tolerance, brain structure, and function measured by MRI, neuroinflammation measured by PET/CT, systemic inflammation, and intramuscular adaptations. Feasibility of the interventions will be comprehensively investigated. DISCUSSION: The COPD-HIIT trial will determine the effects of supramaximal HIIT compared to MICT in people with COPD and healthy controls. We will provide evidence for a novel exercise modality that might overcome the barriers associated with MICT in people with COPD. We will also shed light on the impact of exercise at different intensities to reduce neurodegeneration. The goal of the COPD-HIIT trial is to improve the treatment of extrapulmonary manifestations of the disease. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinicaltrials.gov: NCT06068322.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Exercise is a non-pharmacological intervention for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), including moderate-intensity continuous training (MICT) and high-intensity interval training (HIIT). Despite diverse exercise protocol variations, the impact of these variations in HIIT on T2DM anthropometrics, glycemic control, and cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) remains unclear. OBJECTIVE: The aim was to examine the influence of HIIT protocol characteristics on anthropometrics, glycemic control, and CRF in T2DM patients and compare it to control (without exercise) and MICT. METHODS: This review is registered in PROSPERO (CRD42021281398) and follows Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. The search, employing \"high-intensity interval training\" and \"diabetes mellitus\" in PubMed and Web of Science databases, with a \"randomized controlled trial\" filter, spanned articles up to January 2023. RESULTS: Of 190 records, 29 trials were included, categorized by HIIT interval duration, training volume, and intervention period. Long-duration, high-volume, and long-term HIIT yields superior outcomes compared to control conditions for body mass, waist circumference, fasting plasma glucose, Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR), glycosylated hemoglobin (%HbA1c), and CRF. The findings favored HIIT over MICT for body mass in long-duration, high-volume, and short-term intervals (mean difference [MD] - 3.45, - 3.13, and - 5.42, respectively, all p < 0.05) and for CRF in long and medium work intervals and high volume (MD 1.91, 2.55, and 2.43, respectively, all p < 0.05), as well as in medium and long-term intervention (MD 2.66 and 2.21, respectively, all p < 0.05). Regardless of specific HIIT characteristics, no differences were found in the HIIT versus MICT comparison for glycemic control. CONCLUSIONS: Specific HIIT protocol characteristics influence changes in anthropometrics, glycemic control, and CRF compared to control groups. However, compared to MICT, only longer duration, higher volume, and short-term HIIT improved body mass, waist circumference, and CRF in individuals with T2DM.",

In contrast, high-intensity interval training (HIIT) is effective in improving physical fitness but has never been studied in the context of BED. In the study, 47 young inactive females with mild to moderate BED were recruited and randomly assigned to a HIIT group (HIIT), a Yoga group (YG), or a control group (CG; age, 19.47 ± 0.74, 19.69 ± 0.874, and 19.44 ± 0.63 years; BMI, 21.07 ± 1.66, 21.95 ± 2.67, and 20.68 ± 2.61 kg/m2, respectively). The intervention groups participated in 8-week specific exercises, while the CG maintained their usual daily activity. Before and after the training, participants were evaluated for BED using the binge eating scale (BES) and for physical fitness. The obtained data were compared within groups and between groups, and a correlation analysis between BES and physical fitness parameters was performed. After the training, the YG presented significant improvements in BES (- 20.25%, p = 0.006, ηp2 = 0.408), fat mass (FM, - 3.13%, p = 0.033, ηp2 = 0.269), and maximal oxygen consumption (VO2max, 11.51%, p = 0.000, ηp2 = 0.601), whereas the HIIT showed significant improvements in body weight (BW, - 1.78%, p = 0.006, ηp2 = 0.433), FM (- 3.94%, p = 0.033, ηp2 = 0.285), and BMI (- 1.80%, p = 0.006, ηp2 = 0.428), but not in BES. Comparisons between groups revealed that both HIIT and YG had significantly higher VO2max levels than CG (HIIT 12.82%, p = 0.006, ηp2 = 0.088; YG: 11.90%, p = 0.009, ηp2 = 0.088) with no difference between HIIT and YG. Additionally, YG presented significantly lower BES than both HIIT (15.45%, p = 0.02, ηp2 = 0.03) and CG (11.91%, p = 0.022, ηp2 = 0.03). In conclusion, Yoga is an effective treatment for BED, but HIIT is not, despite its high efficacy in improving physical fitness.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effects of a 4-week intervention combining small-sided games (SSGs) and high-intensity interval training (HIIT) on physical fitness in collegiate male soccer players. METHODS: Twenty-one soccer players were randomly assigned to either the HIIT + SSGs group (n = 11) or a control group (n = 10). Physical fitness was assessed at baseline and 1-week post-intervention, including countermovement jump (CMJ), change of direction (COD) test, sprint test, repeated sprint ability (RSA) test, and 30-15 Intermittent Fitness Test (30-15IFT). The intervention comprised eight sessions over 4 weeks: four SSGs and four HIIT. RESULTS: The intervention group showed small to moderate improvements: mean RSA improved by 4.5% (p = 0.07), CMJ increased by 3.2% (p = 0.12), and 30-15IFT scores enhanced by 6.8% (p = 0.09). Key predictors of group membership included heart rate load per minute (OR 1.602) and various GPS variables. CONCLUSION: The 4-week intervention combining SSGs with HIIT did not produce statistically significant improvements in most physical fitness variables compared to the control group. Although there were positive trends in variables such as RSA and 30-15IFT, these changes were modest and not statistically significant. The results suggest that while the combined SSGs and HIIT approach shows potential, its impact on physical fitness over a 4-week period is limited, with some variables, like CMJ, even showing decreases."

High-intensity interval training (HIIT) is time-efficient and may improve adherence. Our aim was to determine barriers and enablers of adherence to HIIT in patients diagnosed with cancer. DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis. DATA SOURCE: PubMed-MEDLINE, Scopus and Web of Science. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Intervention studies including patients diagnosed with any type of cancer, who engaged in HIIT with or without co-intervention in any stage of treatment and have reported outcomes for adherence. RESULTS: Eight hundred articles were screened and 22 were included (n=807); 19 were included in the meta-analysis (n=755). Weighted adherence to HIIT was 88% (95% CI, 81% to 94%). None of the studies reported serious adverse events. Although being a woman and having breast cancer were associated with lower adherence (p<0.05), age was not (p=0.15). Adherence was significantly lower during the treatment phase in comparison with pre- and post-treatment phases, 83% versus 94% and 96%, respectively (p<0.001). Session time of more than 60 min, when unsupervised and combined with other interventions, was associated with decreased adherence (p<0.05). CONCLUSION: Adherence to HIIT programmes among cancer patients varies and is improved when the intervention is supervised, of shorter duration, consists of solely HIIT and not in combination with other exercise and occurs during pre- and post-treatment phases. Strategies to improve adherence to HIIT in specific subpopulations may be needed to ensure all patients with cancer are provided optimal opportunities to reap the benefits associated with physical activity.

Exercise is known for its anti-inflammatory effects, but the influence of different training modalities on hepatoprotection is still unclear. This study aims to compare the impacts between preconditioning with high-intensity interval training (HIIT) and traditional continuous training of low (LT) and moderate (MT) intensities on inflammatory markers in Wistar female rats with CDDP-induced hepatotoxicity. Thirty-five rats were divided into five groups: control and sedentary (C + Sed), treated with CDDP and sedentary (CDDP + Sed), treated with CDDP and subjected to LT (CDDP + LT), treated with CDDP and subjected to MT (CDDP + MT), and treated with CDDP and subjected to HIIT (CDDP + HIIT). The training protocols consisted of treadmill running for 8 weeks before CDDP treatment. The rats were euthanized 7 days after the treatment. Liver samples were collected to evaluate the expression of various inflammatory markers and types of macrophages. Our results indicated that HIIT was the only protocol to prevent the increase in all analyzed pro-inflammatory cytokines and reduce the number of ED-1-positive cells, attenuating the TLR4/NF-κB signaling pathway in the liver. Additionally, HIIT increased the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 and regulated M1/M2 macrophage polarization. Thus, this study suggests that preconditioning with HIIT is more effective in promoting hepatoprotective effects than LT and MT, regulating inflammatory markers through modulation of the TLR4/NF-κB signaling pathway and M2 macrophage polarization in the hepatic tissue of female rats treated with CDDP.",

METHOD: This study used a three-arm partially-blinded randomized controlled trial to test the effects of two different kinds of 8-week game-based training programs (game-based HIIT program, GameHIIT; and game-based structured aerobic exercise program, GameSAE) on EF and other health indicators of children with ADHD, which was compared with a non-treatment control group. RESULTS: A total of 49 children with ADHD completed the program. Analyses of EF tests and parental survey indicated that (i) there is no significant intragroup difference among all measures between pre-/post-intervention tests for two game-based intervention groups. The only significant intergroup difference was observed in self-monitor score of parent-reported child's EF between GameSAE group and the control (large effect). Similarly, cerebral hemodynamic responses also found no significant group effect for all EF tests. However, the time effects were observed in several channels in the GameHIIT group in two EF tests (Color Words Stroop Test and Tower of London Test). No significant change of participants' overall ADHD symptoms was found in the pre-/post-tests for three groups. Nonetheless, further analyses revealed that both of two game-based training programs exhibited the significant positive effects on child's PA levels and the large effects on levels of physical fitness, when they were compared to the control. CONCLUSION: By this study, a significant enhancement in physical fitness and PA levels were found in both game-based PA interventions when they were compared with control group. However, the effectiveness of game-based PA interventions on improving EF or reducing ADHD symptoms remains unclear. This implies that a larger intervention dosage or a tailored intervention design may be warranted to improve the EF of children with ADHD."

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: While the benefits of exercises for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are well-established, the relative effectiveness of different exercise types for stable COPD remains unclear. This network meta-analysis aims to investigate the comparative effects of aerobic exercise (AE), resistance training (RT), endurance training (ET), and high-intensity interval training (HIIT) in stable COPD. METHODS: Electronic searches were performed in PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane library to identify relevant randomized controlled trials (RCTs) investigating the effects of exercises on 6-minute walk test distance (6MWD), forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), and forced vital capacity (FVC), and St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) score. Two authors screened the retrieved articles, extracted relevant data, and assessed the risk of bias. Network meta-analysis was conducted using Stata 14.0. RESULTS: This study included a total of 19 studies involving 951 patients with stable COPD. HIIT emerged as the most favorable exercise type for enhancing 6MWD, with a probability of 82.9%. RT exhibited the greatest efficacy in reducing SGRQ scores, with probability of 49.8%. Notably, ET demonstrated superiority in improving FEV1 and FVC, with probabilities of being most effective at 78.1% and 42.0%, respectively. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that HIIT may be a viable intervention for improving exercise capacity in stable COPD patients, compared to AE, RR, and ET. RT may hold promise for improving quality of life, and ET may demonstrate superiority in improving pulmonary function. However, variation in response likely depends on patient characteristics, program parameters, and delivery context. Future research should explore the synergistic effects of combining RT with ET/HIIT, focusing on patient subgroups, optimal dosing, and settings, as current guidelines indicate this combination may offer the most significant benefits.",

Exercise is an established intervention, but the relative efficacy of different exercise modalities remains unclear. The aim of this study was to compare the effects of moderate-intensity continuous aerobic training and High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) on physical fitness, biochemical parameters, and liver function in NAFLD patients. METHODS: Sixty NAFLD patients (32 males, 28 females; age: 49.7±8.7 years; BMI: 31.1±3.3 kg/m2) were randomized into HIIT, aerobic training, and control cohorts. The HIIT cohort performed 4-minute high-intensity intervals at 85-95% of peak heart rate, interspersed with 3-minute active recovery at 60-70% of peak heart rate for 30-40 minutes per session. The aerobic training cohort performed continuous exercise at 60-70% of peak heart rate for 45-60 minutes per session. Both intervention cohorts underwent 12 weeks of supervised training, thrice weekly. Before and after the intervention, assessments included cardiorespiratory fitness, muscular strength, flexibility, lipid profile, liver enzymes, inflammatory markers, insulin sensitivity, and oxidative stress markers. RESULTS: Compared to controls, both exercise cohorts showed significant improvements in cardiorespiratory fitness, muscular strength, and flexibility. However, HIIT elicited superior enhancements in cardiorespiratory fitness and muscular strength. Biochemically, both exercise cohorts exhibited reductions in triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, liver enzymes (alanine aminotransferase [ALT], aspartate aminotransferase [AST]), inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein [CRP], interleukin-6 [IL-6]), insulin resistance (homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance [HOMA-IR]), and oxidative stress markers (malondialdehyde [MDA], protein carbonyl). Notably, HIIT yielded more substantial improvements in these parameters. CONCLUSIONS: HIIT and traditional aerobic training are effective in improving physical fitness and ameliorating biochemical indicators in NAFLD patients. Notably, HIIT appears to be more advantageous in enhancing cardiorespiratory fitness, muscular strength, and metabolic, inflammatory, and oxidative stress profiles, suggesting its potential as a time-efficient and effective exercise modality for managing NAFLD.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The optimal exercise regimen for alleviating sarcopenia remains uncertain. This study aimed to investigate the efficacy of high-intensity interval training (HIIT) over moderate-intensity continuous training (MICT) in ameliorating sarcopenia. METHODS: We conducted a randomized crossover trial to evaluate plasma proteomic reactions to acute HIIT (four 4-min high-intensity intervals at 70% maximal capacity alternating with 4 min at 30%) versus MICT (constant 50% maximal capacity) in inactive adults. We explored the relationship between a HIIT-specific protein relative to MICT, identified via comparative proteomic analysis, eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1 epsilon 1 (EEF1E1) and sarcopenia in a paired case-control study of elderly individuals (aged over 65). Young (3 months old) and aged (20 months old) mice were randomized to sedentary, HIIT and MICT groups (five sessions/week for 4 weeks; n = 8 for each group). Measurements included skeletal muscle index, hand grip strength, expression of atrophic markers Atrogin1 and MuRF1 and differentiation markers MyoD, myogenin and MyHC-II via western blotting. We examined the impact of EEF1E1 siRNA and recombinant protein on D-galactose-induced myoblast senescence, measuring senescence-associated β-galactosidase and markers like p21 and p53. RESULTS: The crossover trial, including 10 sedentary adults (32 years old, IQR 31-32) demonstrated significant alterations in the abundance of 21 plasma proteins after HIIT compared with MICT. In the paired case-control study of 84 older adults (84 years old, IQR 69-81; 52% female), EEF1E1 was significantly increased in those with sarcopenia compared to those without (14.68 [95%CI, 2.02-27.34] pg/mL, p = 0.03) and was associated with skeletal muscle index (R2 = 0.51, p < 0.001) and hand grip strength (R2 = 0.54, p < 0.001). In the preclinical study, aged mice exhibited higher EEF1E1 mRNA and protein levels in skeletal muscle compared to young mice, accompanied by a lower muscle mass and strength, increased cellular senescence and protein degradation markers and reduced muscle differentiation efficiency (all p < 0.05). HIIT reduced EEF1E1 expression and mitigated age-related muscle decline and atrophy in aged mice more effectively than MICT. Notably, EEF1E1 downregulation via siRNA significantly counteracted D-galactose-induced myoblast senescence as evidenced by reduced markers of muscle protein degradation and improved muscle differentiation efficiency (all p < 0.05). Conversely, treatments that increased EEF1E1 levels accelerated the senescence process (p < 0.05). Further exploration indicated that the decrease in EEF1E1 was associated with increased SIRT1 level and enhanced autophagy. CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the potential of HIIT as a promising approach to prevent and treat sarcopenia while also highlighting EEF1E1 as a potential intervention target.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: As a novel and time-efficient exercise form, high-intensity interval training (HIIT) has shown great potential in improving health-related physical fitness among diverse populations. However, empirical evidence on its efficacy among the elderly has not been well summarized. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to determine the effect of HIIT interventions on the parameters related to physical fitness and health of older adults, including resting heart rate (HR), systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF), body mass index (BMI), body fat percent (BF%), waist circumference (WC), muscular endurance (ME), muscular strength (MS), muscular power (MP), balance and flexibility, compared to non-exercise and other-exercise (e.g., moderate-intensity continuous training, resistance training) conditions. METHODS: Literature published from January 2000 to May 2023 was collected through extensive searches across eight databases and relevant review papers. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) featuring a minimum 2-week exercise intervention for older adults (≥ 60 years) were included. The pooled effect size of Hedges'g was estimated using random-effects models in R. Meta-regression was performed for both categorical (health status, duration of training programme, and frequency) and continuous moderators (mean age, male rate, and attrition rate). RESULTS: Forty-four eligible RCTs with 1863 participants (52.1% female; 60.5-81.2 years) were included in the quantitative analysis. Compared to non-exercise condition, HIIT significantly improved resting HR (g = -0.36, 95%CI = [-0.67, -0.05], P = 0.032), SBP (g = -0.29, 95%CI = [-0.54, -0.03], P = 0.008), CRF (g = 0.77, 95%CI = [0.51, 1.04], P < 0.001), BF% (g = -0.26, 95%CI = [-0.41, -0.11], P = 0.006), MS (g = 0.47, 95%CI = [0.23, 0.71], P = 0.004), ME (g = 0.65, 95%CI = [0.10, 1.19], P = 0.036), and balance (e.g., timed-up-and-go) (g = -0.79, 95%CI = [-1.19, -0.40], P = 0.035). Compared to other-exercise condition, HIIT significantly improved resting HR (g = -0.11, 95%CI = [-0.21, -0.01], P = 0.029), SBP (g = -0.14, 95%CI = [-0.28, -0.01], P = 0.038), and CRF (g = 0.23, 95%CI = [0.07, 0.38], P = 0.008). No significant difference was found between HIIT and non-exercise condition for DBP, BMI and WC, as well as between HIIT and other-exercise condition for DBP, BMI, BF%, WC, ME, and balance (all P > 0.05). Meta-regression indicated that mean age moderated the HIIT effect on resting HR (b = -0.02, P = 0.014; HIIT vs. other-exercise condition) and SBP (b = 0.03, P = 0.048; HIIT vs. non-exercise), and attrition rate moderated the effect on CRF (b = 0.03, P = 0.007; HIIT vs. non-exercise). CONCLUSION: This study supports the efficacy of HIIT in improving resting HR, SBP, CRF, BF%, MS, ME and balance among older adults. More empirical evidence is needed to determine the efficacy of HIIT for MP and flexibility in this population. TRIAL REGISTRATION: PROSPERO CRD42022316246."

In the present study, we examined the effects of the same HIIT scheme on LVM, pulmonary diffusing capacity, symptom severity and functional capacity at 12-month follow-up. In this investigator-blinded, randomised controlled trial, 12 weeks of a supervised HIIT scheme (4 × 4 min, three times a week) was compared to standard care (control) in patients recently discharged from hospital due to COVID-19. At inclusion and at 12-month follow-up, LVM was assessed by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (cMRI, primary outcome), while pulmonary diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCOc, secondary outcome) was examined by the single-breath method. Symptom severity and functional status were examined by the Post-COVID-19 Functional Scale (PCFS) and King's Brief Interstitial Lung Disease (KBILD) questionnaire score. Of the 28 patients assessed at baseline, 22 completed cMRI at 12-month follow-up (12.4 ± 0.6 months after inclusion). LVM was maintained in the HIIT but not the standard care group, with a mean between-group difference of 9.68 [95% CI: 1.72, 17.64] g (P = 0.0182). There was no differences in change from baseline to 12-month follow-up between groups in DLCOc % predicted (-2.45 [-11.25, 6.34]%; P = 0.578). PCFS and KBILD improved similarly in the two groups. In individuals previously hospitalised for COVID-19, a 12-week supervised HIIT scheme resulted in a preserved LVM at 12-month follow-up but did not affect pulmonary diffusing capacity or symptom severity."

DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis DATA SOURCES: Five databases were searched from inception to March 2024. STUDY APPRAISAL AND SYNTHESIS: Meta-analyses of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing HIIT with MICT/CON were performed for components of MetS (waist circumference (WC), systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), triglyceride (TG), and fasting blood glucose (BG)) and clinically relevant cardiometabolic health parameters. Subgroup moderator analyses were conducted based on the intervention duration and HIIT volume. RESULTS: Out of 4819 studies, 23 RCTs involving 1374 participants were included (mean age: 46.2-67.0 years, 55% male). HIIT significantly improved WC (weighted mean difference (WMD) -4.12 cm, 95% CI -4.71 to -3.53), SBP (WMD -6.05 mm Hg, 95% CI -8.11 to -4.00), DBP (WMD -3.68 mm Hg, 95% CI -5.70 to -1.65), HDL-C (WMD 0.12 mmol/L, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.20), TG (WMD -0.34 mmol/L, 95% CI -0.41 to -0.27) and BG (WMD -0.35 mmol/L, 95% CI -0.54 to -0.16) compared with CON (all p<0.01). HIIT approaches demonstrated comparable effects to MICT across all parameters. Subgroup analyses suggested that HIIT protocols with low volume (ie, <15 min of high-intensity exercise per session) were not inferior to higher volume protocols for improving MetS components. CONCLUSION: This review supports HIIT as an efficacious exercise strategy for improving cardiometabolic health in individuals with MetS. Low-volume HIIT appears to be a viable alternative to traditional forms of aerobic exercise.",

However, there are no studies that investigate the effects of HIIT on contractility and intracellular Ca2+ handling. The purpose of this study was to explore the impact of HIIT on cardiomyocyte contractile function and intracellular Ca2+ handling in rats in which obesity was induced by a saturated high-fat diet (HFD). Male Wistar rats were initially randomized into a standard diet and a HFD group. The experimental protocol spanned 23 weeks, comprising the induction and maintenance of obesity (15 weeks) followed by HIIT treatment (8 weeks). Performance was assessed using the maximum oxygen consumption test (   V ̇ O 2 max  ${{\\dot{V}}_{{{{\\mathrm{O}}}_{\\mathrm{2}}}{\\mathrm{max}}}}$  ). Evaluation encompassed cardiac, adipose and skeletal muscle histology, as well as contractility and intracellular Ca2+ handling. HIIT resulted in a reduction in visceral area, an increase in   V ̇ O 2 max  ${{\\dot{V}}_{{{{\\mathrm{O}}}_{\\mathrm{2}}}{\\mathrm{max}}}}$  , and an augmentation of gastrocnemius fibre diameter in obese subjects. Additionally, HIIT led to a decrease in collagen fraction, an increase in percentage shortening, and a reduction in systolic Ca2+/percentage shortening and systolic Ca2+/maximum shortening rates. HIIT induces physiological cardiac remodelling, enhancing the contractile function of cardiomyocytes and improving myofilament sensitivity to Ca2+ in the context of obesity. This approach not only enhances cardiorespiratory and physical performance but also reduces visceral area and prevents interstitial fibrosis.",

METHODS: Eighteen sedentary normal-weight adolescents (age: 18.5 ± 0.3 years, 11 females) were randomized into three groups. HIIT group protocol consisted of three sessions/week for 8-week of \"all out\" sprints to reach 85%-95% of HRmax, and MICT group protocol undertook three sessions/week for 8-week of continuous running to reach 65%-75% of HRmax. The control group resumed normal daily activities without any intervention. Blood pressure and body composition were measured, and fasting blood samples were obtained at baseline and 48 h post-trial. Mixed-design ANOVA analysis was employed followed by post hoc t-tests and Bonferroni alpha-correction was used to evaluate interaction, between-group, and within-group differences, respectively. RESULTS: Results indicated that HIIT and MICT similarly affected body fat mass (p = 0.021, ES = 0.19; p = 0.016, ES = 0.30, respectively), body fat percentage (p = 0.037, ES = 0.17; p = 0.041, ES = 0.28, respectively), visceral fat area (p = 0.001, ES = 0.35; p = 0.003, ES = 0.49, respectively) of body composition. A positive outcome was observed for waist/hip ratio (p = 0.033, ES = 0.43) in HIIT, but not MICT (p = 0.163, ES = 0.33). No significant differences were found between groups for any clinical biomarkers. However, pairwise comparison within the group showed a significant decrease in systolic blood pressure (p = 0.018, ES = 0.84), diastolic blood pressure (p = 0.008, ES = 1.76), and triglyceride (p = 0.004, ES = 1.33) in HIIT, but no significant differences were found in the MICT and Control group. CONCLUSION: Both 8-week HIIT and MICT programmes have similar positive effects on reducing body fat mass, fat percentage, and visceral fat area. However, sedentary adolescents may have limited scope to decrease insulin resistance after these 8-week interventions. Notably, the 8-week HIIT intervention was highly effective in increasing cardiometabolic health compared to the MICT. The exercise intensity threshold value and metabolic outcomes of high-intensity interval sprints should be explored further to extend the long-term benefit in this cohort."

The aim of this assessor-blinded, two-armed multicentre randomised controlled trial was to evaluate the effects of high-intensity interval training (HIIT) and strength exercise on cardiovascular health, physical fitness and overall health in patients with RA. METHODS: In total, 87 patients (86% female; aged 20-60 years) were randomly assigned to an intervention group (IG) or a control group (CG). The IG performed HIIT and strength exercise for 12 weeks. The CG was instructed to be physically active on a moderately intensive level, ≥150 min/week. Primary outcome was change in VO2max. Secondary outcomes were changes in anthropometry measures, muscle strength, overall health (Visual Analogue Scale (VAS)-Global), Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC), pain and disease activity (Disease Activity Score in 28 joints (DAS28)). RESULTS: There was a significant mean group difference of change on VO2max (3.71 mL/kg/min; 95% CI 2.16, 5.25) in favour of the IG. Significant mean group differences of change were also seen for O2-pulse (1.38; 95% CI 0.85 to 1.91), waist circumference (-2.6; 95% CI -5.09 to -0.18), 1-minute sit-to-stand (5.0; 95% CI 3.35 to 6.72), handgrip strength (28.5; 95% CI 3.80 to 52.8), overall health (-14.7; 95% CI -23.8 to -5.50) and PGIC (p<0.0001) in favour of the IG. No significant mean group differences of change were found for pain (-4.0; 95% CI -13.07 to 5.06), DAS28 (-0.25; 95% CI -0.60 to 0.10) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (-0.64; 95% CI -3.23 to 1.90). CONCLUSION: Supervised HIIT and strength exercise improved cardiovascular health, physical fitness and overall health without a deterioration in pain and disease activity and should be considered in patients with well-controlled RA.

      "abstract": "Peripheral neuropathy (PN) is a prevalent and debilitating complication of obesity, prediabetes, and type 2 diabetes, which remains poorly understood and lacks disease-modifying therapies. Fortunately, diet and/or exercise have emerged as effective treatment strategies for PN. Here, we examined the impact of caloric restriction (CR) and high-intensity interval training (HIIT) interventions, alone or combined (HIIT-CR), on metabolic and PN outcomes in high-fat diet (HFD) mice. HFD feeding alone resulted in obesity, impaired glucose tolerance, and PN. Peripheral nerves isolated from these mice also developed insulin resistance (IR). CR and HIIT-CR, but not HIIT alone, improved HFD-induced metabolic dysfunction. However, all interventions improved PN to similar extents. When examining the underlying neuroprotective mechanisms in whole nerves, we found that CR and HIIT-CR activate the fuel-sensing enzyme AMPK. We then performed complimentary in vitro work in Schwann cells, the glia of peripheral nerves. Treating primary Schwann cells with the saturated fatty acid palmitate to mimic prediabetic conditions caused IR, which was reversed by the AMPK activator, AICAR. Together, these results enhance our understanding of PN pathogenesis, the differential mechanisms by which diet and exercise may improve PN, and Schwann cell-specific contributions to nerve insulin signaling and PN progression.",

AIM: This study aimed to determine the effect of Low-Volume High-Intensity Interval Training (LV-HIIT) on fatty liver index (FLI) and GFR estimation in patients with T2DM. METHODS: This randomized controlled trial included 80 patients with T2DM and a sedentary lifestyle, randomly divided into HIIT (n=40) and a control group (n=40). Patients with a history of T2DM for at least one year and HbA1C levels between 6.4% and 10% were selected. The intervention group underwent a 4-week LV-HIIT course, comprising 3 sessions per week, while the control group did not receive any intervention. FLI, eGFR, anthropometric measurements, and laboratory variables were assessed in all participants before and after the intervention. RESULTS: FLI (62.0 at baseline, 53.0 at follow-up) significantly decreased in the LV-HIIT group after the intervention, while eGFR (71.0 at baseline, 73.6 at follow-up) significantly increased (P<0.001). However, the control group showed a significant reduction only in Fasting Blood Sugar (FBS) (P<0.05). After the intervention, the LV-HIIT group had significantly lower FBS (129.0 at baseline, 121.0 at follow-up), Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT) (24.0 at baseline, 18.0 at follow-up), and Gamma-Glutamyl Transferase (GGT) (22.0 at baseline, 19.0 at follow-up), as well as higher eGFR, compared to the control group (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: LV-HIIT exercise appears to be a promising and effective training method for improving FLI and eGFR in patients diagnosed with T2DM."

      "abstract": "Sleep disturbances are common in individuals with posttraumatic stress disorder. Exercise interventions are a promising approach in the treatment of sleep disorders, but little is known about the efficacy of exercise interventions for sleep disturbances associated with posttraumatic stress disorder. A total of 40 individuals with posttraumatic stress disorder were randomized to six sessions of either high-intensity interval training or low-to-moderate-intensity training, administered within 12 days. Sleep quality was assessed over 24 days from baseline to post with the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, a sleep log, and a waist-worn actigraphy. Analyses revealed that, regardless of group allocation, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index score improved significantly by 2.28 points for high-intensity interval training and 1.70 points for low-to-moderate-intensity training (d = 0.56 for high-intensity interval training; 0.49 for low-to-moderate-intensity training) over time, while there were no significant changes in any sleep log or actigraphy measure. Analysis of a subsample of those affected by clinically significant sleep disturbances (n = 24) revealed a significant time effect with no difference between exercise interventions: Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index improved significantly by 2.65 points for high-intensity interval training and 2.89 points for low-to-moderate-intensity training (d = 0.53 for high-intensity interval training; 0.88 for low-to-moderate-intensity training), and actigraphy measure of wake after sleep onset was reduced significantly by 14.39 minutes for high-intensity interval training and 6.96 minutes for low-to-moderate-intensity training (d = 0.47 for high-intensity interval training; 0.11 for low-to-moderate-intensity training) from baseline to post. In our pilot study, we found an improvement in sleep quality from pre- to post-assessment. There were no significant differences between exercise groups. Further studies are needed to investigate whether the found time effects reflect the exercise intervention or unrelated factors.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Cardiac rehabilitation (CR) is essential in reducing cardiovascular mortality and morbidity. High-intensity interval training (HIIT) has emerged as a promising exercise intervention for enhancing clinical outcomes in cardiac patients. This study aimed to investigate the effects of two short-term exercise-based programs employing HIIT and moderate-intensity continuous training (MICT) in comparison to a control group concerning blood pressure, body composition, and blood biomarkers in patients diagnosed with coronary artery disease (CAD). METHODS: Seventy-two CAD patients (14% women) underwent randomization into three groups: HIIT, MICT, and control. The training programs encompassed six weeks of supervised treadmill exercises, conducted thrice weekly. MICT targeted ≈ 70-75% of peak heart rate (HRpeak), while HIIT was tailored to ≈ 85-95% of HRpeak. The control group received guidance on adopting healthy lifestyles. Outcome measurements included evaluations of blood pressure, body composition, and blood biomarkers. RESULTS: In contrast to MICT, the HIIT exhibited superior improvements in body fat mass ( Δ %HIIT: 4.5%, p < 0.001 vs. Δ %MICT: 3.2%, p < 0.001), waist circumference ( Δ %HIIT: 4.1%, p = 0.002 vs. Δ %MICT: 2.5%, p = 0.002), hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) ( Δ %HIIT: 10.4%, p < 0.001 vs. Δ %MICT: 32.3%, p < 0.001) and thyrotropin (TSH) ( Δ %HIIT: 16.5%, p = 0.007 vs. Δ %MICT: 3.1%, p = 0.201). Both HIIT and MICT induced significant enhancements across all variables compared to the control group. CONCLUSIONS: HIIT and MICT emerged as effective modalities for enhancing systolic and diastolic function, body composition, and blood biomarkers in CAD patients, with HIIT demonstrating incremental improvements over MICT. The absence of participation in exercise-based programs following cardiovascular events yielded less favorable outcomes. HIIT holds promise as an adjunct intervention in CR programs for CAD patients.

      "abstract": "As athletes pursue excellence, training techniques continue to advance, making structured physical activity an essential tool for enhancing performance. To optimize athletic performance in modern competitive sports, the balance of physical performance and mental clarity is required. This study seeks to examine the effects of High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) on cognitive and physical skills in basketball and soccer players. A 3-week HIIT protocol was incorporated based on the Wingate technique. This study included 10 soccer players and 10 basketball players with an average age of 22.79 ± 1.90 years. Participants performed pre- and post-intervention assessments. Physical proficiency was assessed using 20 m sprint, change-of-direction (COD) and dribbling tests, while cognitive skills were assessed using motion object tracking (MOT), working memory, perceptual load (PL), and attention window (AW) tests. The HIIT intervention significantly improved cognitive performance in particular; noteworthy observations were a 15% improvement in motion object tracking test scores and a 16% increase in working memory test scores for basketball players. The attention window test scores showed a 32% increase, and perceptual load test scores were 31% decreased for soccer players post-intervention. There were significant improvements in physical skills; for example, sprint times were decreased by 6%, and change-of-direction and dribbling times were reduced by 8% and 7%, respectively, indicating improved agility, speed, and ball control abilities. In conclusion, both groups performed significantly better on cognitive and physical skill tests post-HIIT intervention."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Consequences of spinal cord injury (SCI) with a sedentary lifestyle will progress to muscle weakness and muscle atrophy, leading to muscle fatigue. This study aimed to determine the feasibility and preliminary effects of high-intensity interval training (HIIT) using functional electrical stimulation (FES) cycling on changes in thigh muscle volume and muscle strength, in patients with incomplete SCI. METHODS: Eight incomplete SCI patients (mean age 50 years; 6 women) with stable SCI paraplegia (mean 6.75 years since injury) participated in the HIIT FES cycling (85%-90% peak Watts; 4 × 4-min intervals) three times a week (over 6 weeks). The main outcomes were adherence, participant acceptability, and adverse events. Secondary outcomes were muscle strength (peak torque) and leg volume changes. RESULTS: Our findings revealed that the program was well-received by participants, with high levels of adherence, positive feedback, and satisfaction, suggesting that it could be a promising option for individuals seeking to enhance their lower body strength and muscle mass. Additionally, all participants successfully completed the training without any serious adverse events, indicating that the program is safe for use. Finally, we found that the 6-week HIIT FES leg cycling exercise program resulted in notable improvements in isometric peak torque of the quadriceps (range 13.9%-25.6%), hamstring muscle (18.2%-23.3%), and leg volume (1.7%-18.2%). CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights HIIT FES leg cycling exercise program potential as an effective intervention for improving lower limb muscle function.",

This study examined HIIT's feasibility and clinical effectiveness in the early post-stroke stage in Benin. This was a prospective interventional study comprising an HIIT programme executed on a recumbent bike, three times/week, 20-30 min/session for 6 weeks, added to a conventional physiotherapy. The primary outcomes were feasibility, credibility and expectancy assessed with credibility and expectancy questionnaire. A maximal exercise test, 6-min walking test (6MWT), 10-m walking test (10mWT), Berg balance scale (BBS) and five repetitions sit-to-stand test (5 R-STS) were performed before and after the training programme. Ten outpatients, with a median age [P25-P75]: 63.5[56.7-71.2] years; time since stroke: 15.0[9.7-21.0] days, started and completed all training sessions without serious adverse events. High scores were observed on the Credibility subscale at admission (27.0[25.7-27.0]), which remained so after intervention (26.5[25.7-27.0]). Expectancy subscale scores were high at admission (25.5[24.0-27.0]) and post-training (25.5[24.5-27.0]). Peak workload (p < 0.001), BBS (p < 0.001), 6MWT (p < 0.001), 10mWT (p < 0.001) and 5 R-STS (p = 0.004) were all improved. HIIT is feasible and safe in the early subacute post-stroke stage and is perceived by patients as highly credible, meeting their expectations of recovery.",
