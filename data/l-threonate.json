      "abstract": "Impaired adult hippocampal neurogenesis is a key pathological mechanism contributing to memory deficits in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Recent studies have shown that elevating magnesium levels promotes neurogenesis by enhancing the neuronal differentiation of adult neural progenitor cells in vitro. Therefore, this in vivo study aims to determine if magnesium-L-threonate (MgT) can ameliorate cognitive deficit of AD mice by attenuating adult hippocampal neurogenesis impairment and to reveal the underlying mechanisms. APPswe/PS1dE9 mice were treated with different doses of MgT and ERK inhibitor PD0325901. The memory ability of each mouse was recorded by Morris Water Maze test. After cognitive test, hippocampus tissues were collected to measure the proportion of BrdU/doublecortin double-labeled cells using the flow cytometry test and assess the expression of doublecortin using PCR and Western blot. Furthermore, the activations of CREB, ERK, P38 and JNK were measured by Western blot to identify the involved mechanisms. The cognitive test confirmed that MgT treatment attenuated the memory impairment of APPswe/PS1dE9 mice. Flow cytometry test showed that Brdu/doublecortin labeled newborn neurons gradually increased following MgT administration. In line with the flow cytometry results, Western blot and PCR confirmed that MgT administration significantly increased doublecortin expression levels. Furthermore, the ratios of p-ERK/ERK and p-CREB/CREB increased with MgT elevation. In addition, these effects of MgT treatment were markedly reversed by PD0325901 supplementation. In conclusion, MgT treatment improved cognitive decline by ameliorating adult hippocampal neurogenesis impairment in this AD model, possibly via ERK/CREB activation."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE/BACKGROUND: Sleep problems challenge overall wellbeing. Magnesium has been implicated to benefit sleep, although the clinical evidences varied based on the magnesium source used. Magnesium L-threonate (MgT) is a promising intervention due to its brain bioavailability and effects on cognition, memory and mood. We investigated MgT supplementation on sleep quality and daily function. PATIENTS/METHODS: Eighty 35-55-year-olds with self-assessed sleep problems participated in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-arm study, taking 1 g/day of MgT or placebo for 21 days. Sleep and daily behaviors were measured subjectively using standardized questionnaires including the Insomnia Severity Index, Leeds Sleep Evaluation Questionnaire, and Restorative Sleep Questionnaire, and objectively using an Oura ring. The Profile of Mood States questionnaire and a daily diary were used to evaluate mood, energy and productivity, and record any safety concerns. RESULTS: The MgT group maintained good sleep quality and daytime functioning, while placebo declined. From objective Oura ring measurements, MgT significantly (p < 0.05) improved vs placebo deep sleep score, REM sleep score, light sleep time, and activity and readiness parameters activity score, activity daily movement score, readiness score, readiness activity balance, and readiness sleep balance. From subjective questionnaires, MgT significantly (p < 0.05) improved vs placebo behavior upon awakening, energy and daytime productivity, grouchiness, mood and mental alertness. MgT was safe and well tolerated. CONCLUSIONS: This showed MgT improved sleep quality, especially deep/REM sleep stages, improved mood, energy, alertness, and daily activity and productivity. These are consistent with how MgT works in neuron cells and animal models, suggesting broader positive impacts on overall brain health."

Magnesium-L-threonate has recently been found to have protective effects on learning and memory in aged and Alzheimer's disease model mice. However, the effects of magnesium-L-threonate on the gut microbiota in Alzheimer's disease remain unknown. Previously, we reported that magnesium-L-threonate treatment improved cognition and reduced oxidative stress and inflammation in a double-transgenic line of Alzheimer's disease model mice expressing the amyloid-β precursor protein and mutant human presenilin 1 (APP/PS1). Here, we performed 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry to analyze changes in the microbiome and serum metabolome following magnesium-L-threonate exposure in a similar mouse model. Magnesium-L-threonate modulated the abundance of three genera in the gut microbiota, decreasing Allobaculum and increasing Bifidobacterium and Turicibacter. We also found that differential metabolites in the magnesium-L-threonate-regulated serum were enriched in various pathways associated with neurodegenerative diseases. The western blotting detection on intestinal tight junction proteins (zona occludens 1, occludin, and claudin-5) showed that magnesium-L-threonate repaired the intestinal barrier dysfunction of APP/PS1 mice. These findings suggest that magnesium-L-threonate may reduce the clinical manifestations of Alzheimer's disease through the microbiota-gut-brain axis in model mice, providing an experimental basis for the clinical treatment of Alzheimer's disease."

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: Post-mastectomy pain syndrome is a common yet debilitating neuropathic complication after breast cancer procedures, resulting in significantly reduced quality of life. Recently, emerging evidence has supported the therapeutic effect of magnesium administration in chronic pain. However, the role of magnesium supplementation in development of chronic pain after breast cancer surgery remains less known. The aim of this study was to evaluate therapeutic effect of magnesium supplementation on persistent pain after breast cancer procedure. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial. A total of 109 patients who underwent breast cancer procedure received magnesium-L-threonate (n = 48) or placebo (n = 61) for 12 weeks. Chronic pain incidence, short form of the McGill Pain Questionnaire (SF-MPQ), Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7), Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status (TICS) were evaluated at 3- and 6-month follow-up. RESULTS: About 31% (15 out of 48) of patients reported chronic pain after magnesium supplementation, and 26% (16 out of 61) of the control group at 6-month follow-up respectively. Total scores of SF-MPQ were significantly increased in the control group 6 months after surgical intervention (mean difference, 1.475; 95% CI, -2.730 to -0.2211), but NOT in the magnesium treated group (mean difference, 1.250; 95% CI, -2.775 to 0.2748). No significant differences were found between two cohorts on SF-MPQ, GAD-7, PHQ-9, PSQI, or TICS at each timepoint. CONCLUSION: Oral supplementation of magnesium-L-threonate did not effectively prevent the development of persistent pain in breast cancer survivors, nor provide sufficient pain relief over placebo. We did not observe improvement of pain, mood, sleep disorder, or cognitive function after 12-week magnesium supplementation. Future study may focus on magnesium combined with other effective anti-neuropathic pain treatment."

      "abstract": "Chronic postsurgical pain (CPSP) and its emotional comorbidities poses health burden to patients who have received the surgical treatment. However, its underlying mechanism remains unclear. Emerging studies indicate that magnesium deficiency is associated with neurological diseases, and magnesium supplement confers protection under these disease conditions. In this study, we examined the role and mechanism of magnesium deficiency in the pathology of surgery-induced allodynia and negative emotion using a rat model of skin/muscle incision and retraction (SMIR) and investigated the therapeutic effects of magnesium supplementation by oral magnesium-L-Threonate (L-TAMS) in SMIR-injured rats. In the SMIR model, rats developed mechanical allodynia and anxiodepressive-like behaviors. Further, SMIR caused microglia and astrocyte activation and enhanced expression of pro-inflammatory cytokine (TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6) in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). Importantly, magnesium ion (Mg2+) levels decreased in the serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of SMIR-injured rats, which exhibited high correlation with pain and emotion behavioral phenotypes in these rats. Repeated oral administration of L-TAMS increased serum and CSF levels of Mg2+ in SMIR-injured rats. Notably, L-TAMS administration reversed SMIR-induced mechanical allodynia and anxiodepressive-like behaviors but did not affect pain and emotional behaviors in sham rats. Moreover, L-TAMS administration suppressed SMIR-caused glial activation and proinflammatory cytokine expression in the ACC but had no such effect in sham rats. Together, our study demonstrates the contributing role of magnesium deficiency in the pathology of surgery-induced chronic pain and negative emotion. Moreover, we suggest that L-TAMS might be a novel approach to treat CPSP and its emotional comorbidities.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Oxidative stress results in the production of excess reactive oxygen species (ROS) and triggers hippocampal neuronal damage as well as occupies a key role in the pathological mechanisms of neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). A recent study confirmed that magnesium had an inhibitory effect against oxidative stress-related malondialdehyde in vitro. However, whether Magnesium-L-threonate (MgT) is capable of suppressing oxidative stress damage in amyloid β (Aβ)25-35-treated HT22 cells and the AD mouse model still remains to be investigated. AIM: To explore the neuroprotective effect of MgT against oxidative stress injury in vitro and in vivo, and investigate the mechanism. METHODS: Aβ25-35-induced HT22 cells were preconditioned with MgT for 12 h. APPswe/PS1dE9 (APP/PS1) mice were orally administered with MgT daily for 3 mo. After MgT treatment, the viability of Aβ25-35-treated HT22 cells was determined via conducting cell counting kit-8 test and the cognition of APP/PS1 mice was measured through the Morris Water Maze. Flow cytometry experiments were applied to assess the ROS levels of HT22 cells and measure the apoptosis rate of HT22 cells or hippocampal neurons. Expression of B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2), Bcl-2-associated X (Bax), hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1α, NADPH oxidase (NOX) 4, Aβ1-42 and phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (Akt) pathway proteins was quantified by Western blot. RESULTS: In vitro data confirmed that Aβ25-35-induced HT22 cells had a significantly lower cell viability, higher ROS level and higher apoptosis rates compared with those of control cells (all P < 0.001). MgT prevented the Aβ25-35-triggered oxidative stress damage by elevating viability and decreasing ROS formation and apoptosis of HT22 cells (all P < 0.001). APP/PS1 mice exhibited worse cognitive performance and higher apoptosis rate of hippocampal neurons than wild-type (WT) mice (all P < 0.01). Meanwhile, significant higher expression of Aβ1-42 and NOX4 proteins was detected in APP/PS1 mice than those of WT mice (both P < 0.01). MgT also ameliorated the cognitive deficit, suppressed the apoptosis of hippocampal neuron and downregulated the expression of Aβ1-42 and NOX4 proteins in APP/PS1 mouse (all P < 0.05). Moreover, MgT intervention significantly downregulated HIF-1α and Bax, upregulated Bcl-2 and activated the PI3K/Akt pathway both in vitro and in vivo (all P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: MgT exhibits neuroprotective effects against oxidative stress and hippocampal neuronal apoptosis in Aβ25-35-treated HT22 cells and APP/PS1 mice."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of vitamin C (vit C) and magnesium L-threonate (MgT) on the learning ability and memory of mice intoxicated with lead acetate. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The experimental male Swiss albinos were divided into five groups of 10 during a 40-day treatment period. One group were untreated controls, one received lead acetate at 90 mg/kg b.w., one additionally vit C at 40 mg/kg b.w., another additionally MgT at 100 mg/kg b.w., and the last was administered MgT without lead acetate. After a 20-day washout period, the animals were trained in the Morris water maze test for 6 days and after a 24-hour interval, were assessed for memory in the same test. At test end the mice were sacrificed and their organs sampled. RESULTS: The results of total time and number of entries into the platform zone showed that significantly poorer performances were recorded for the group poisoned with lead acetate alone and significantly lower scores for learning and memory were recorded for the intoxicated and supplemented groups compared to the control group. Catalase activity was significantly reduced in the liver, pancreas and kidney but significantly potentiated in brain tissue by these two supplements compared to the control group. Lead concentration in brain tissue was significantly higher in the presence of vit C than in the control or lead acetate-only groups. CONCLUSION: Lead acetate had adverse effects on learning and memory of mice and also increased catalase activity."

      "abstract": "Antineoplastic drugs such as oxaliplatin (OXA) often induce memory and emotional deficits. At present, the mechanisms underlying these side-effects are not fully understood, and no effective treatment is available. Here, we show that the short-term memory deficits and anxiety-like and depression-like behaviors induced by intraperitoneal injections of OXA (4 mg/kg per day for 5 consecutive days) were accompanied by synaptic dysfunction and downregulation of the NR2B subunit of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors in the hippocampus, which is critically involved in memory and emotion. The OXA-induced behavioral and synaptic changes were prevented by chronic oral administration of magnesium-L-threonate (L-TAMS, 604 mg/kg per day, from 2 days before until the end of experiments). We found that OXA injections significantly reduced the free Mg2+ in serum and cerebrospinal fluid (from ~ 0.8 mmol/L to ~ 0.6 mmol/L). The Mg2+ deficiency (0.6 mmol/L) upregulated tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α) and phospho-p65 (p-p65), an active form of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-κB), and downregulated the NR2B subunit in cultured hippocampal slices. Oral L-TAMS prevented the OXA-induced upregulation of TNF-α and p-p65, as well as microglial activation in the hippocampus and the medial prefrontal cortex. Finally, similar to oral L-TAMS, intracerebroventricular injection of PDTC, an NF-κB inhibitor, also prevented the OXA-induced memory/emotional deficits and the changes in TNF-α, p-p65, and microglia. Taken together, the activation of TNF-α/NF-κB signaling resulting from reduced brain Mg2+ is responsible for the memory/emotional deficits induced by OXA. Chronic oral L-TAMS may be a novel approach to treating chemotherapy-induced memory/emotional deficits.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Hypoxia inhibits the uptake of glutamate (a major neurotransmitter in the brain closely related to cognitive function) into brain cells, and the initial response of cells to cortical hypoxia depends on glutamate. Previous studies have suggested that magnesium may have protective effects against hypoxic injuries. In particular, magnesium L-threonate (MgT) may increase magnesium ion concentrations in the brain better than MgSO4 and improve cognitive function. METHODS: We evaluated cell viability under hypoxic conditions in the MgT- and MgSO4-treated human SH-SY5Y neurons, in vivo behavior using the T-maze test following hypoxia in MgT-treated zebrafish, activity of brain mitochondrial dehydrogenase by 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining, and protein expression of the excitatory amino acid transporter (EAAT) 4 glutamate transporter by western blotting. RESULTS: Among the groups treated with hypoxia, cell viability significantly increased when pre-treated with 1 or 10 mM MgT (p = 0.009 and 0.026, respectively). Despite hypoxic insult, MgT-treated zebrafish showed preferences for the red compartment (p = 0.025 for distance and p = 0.007 for frequency of entries), suggesting memory preservation. TTC staining showed reduced cerebral infarction and preserved absorbance in the MgT-treated zebrafish brain after hypoxia (p = 0.010 compared to the hypoxia group). In addition, western blot showed upregulation of EAAT4 protein in the MgT treated group. CONCLUSIONS: Pre-treatment with MgT attenuated cell death and cerebral infarction due to hypoxia and protected cognitive function in zebrafish. In addition, MgT appeared to modulate expression of the glutamate transporter, EAAT4.",

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: Epidemiology research has demonstrated that magnesium (Mg) deficiency is associated with a high incidence of Parkinson's disease (PD). It is known that the systemic administration of MgSO4 is not able to elevate the Mg concentration in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). This study aims to verify the protective effect of magnesium-L-threonate (MgT) in 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1, 2, 3, 6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) mouse model. METHODS: C57BL/6J mice were orally administered MgT or MgSO4 for 4 weeks, and received MPTP in the third week. After analysis of open-field and rotarod tests on the last day, tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) immunopositive cells and protein levels were quantified in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) and striatum. The expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) level was evaluated. Mg concentration in serum and CSF was measured after oral administration of MgSO4 or MgT in normal mice. Mg concentration in the CSF was increased in the mice treated with MgT but not MgSO4. RESULTS: The total distance and mean speed in open-field tests, and the time spent on rotarod in the MgT group were increased, compared with MPTP group. The MgT treatment but not MgSO4 dose-dependently attenuated the loss of TH-positive neurons, and the reduction of the TH expression in the SNpc. The MgT treatment also inhibited the expression of iNOS as measured by immunohistochemistry and Western blots. Double-immunofluorescence staining of TH and iNOS showed iNOS-positive cells were collocalized for TH-positive cells. CONCLUSION: The treatment with MgT is associated with an increase of Mg in the CSF. MgT, rather than MgSO4, can significantly attenuate MPTP-induced motor deficits and dopamine (DA) neuron loss."

      "abstract": "Magnesium (Mg) is an essential biomineral that acts as an intracellular cofactor for more than 300 enzymes. It is an important modulator of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor which is involved in memory function and depression. The purpose of this study was to compare the dose dependent effect of oral supplementation of Magnesium chloride (MgCl2), Magnesium sulphate (MgSO4) and Magnesium-L-threonate (MgT) on memory and depression-related behaviors in rats. Rats were orally administered with different doses (50 mg/kg, 100 mg/kg and 150 mg/kg) of each Mg salt. Following 28 days of oral supplementation, animals were subjected to behavioral tests. After completion of behavioral test, rats were decapitated. Brain and plasma samples were used for neurochemical and biochemical analysis. Assessment of behaviors in elevated plus maze (EPM) test and forced swim test (FST) showed that MgT more significantly improved memory of rats and decreased depression-like symptoms in healthy rats as compared to controls. Biochemical analysis indicated significant increase in plasma Mg levels dose dependently following MgT administration. This increase might be related to observe enhanced cholinergic functions and decline in oxidative stress in rats in the present study. This comparative study highlights that MgT (100mg/kg) is the most appropriate Mg salt and dose for oral treatment that strengthens cholinergic system and improves brain related functions through attenuation of oxidative burden in adult healthy rats.",

      "abstract": "Oral administration of the combination of L-threonate (threonate) and magnesium (Mg(2+)) in the form of L-Threonic acid Magnesium salt (L-TAMS) can enhance learning and memory in young rats and prevent memory decline in aging rats and in Alzheimer's disease model mice. Recent results from a human clinical trial demonstrate the efficacy of L-TAMS in restoring global cognitive abilities of older adults. Previously, we reported that neuronal intracellular Mg(2+) serves as a critical signaling molecule for controlling synapse density, a key factor that determines cognitive ability. The elevation of brain Mg(2+) by oral administration of L-TAMS in intact animals plays a significant role in mediating the therapeutic effects of L-TAMS. The current study sought to elucidate the unique role of threonate. We aimed to understand if threonate acts directly to elevate intraneuronal Mg(2+), and why Mg(2+) given without threonate is ineffective for enhancing learning and memory ability. We discovered that threonate is naturally present in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and oral treatment with L-TAMS elevated CSF threonate. In cultured hippocampal neurons, threonate treatment directly induced an increase in intracellular Mg(2+) concentration. Functionally, elevating threonate upregulated expression of NR2B-containing NMDAR, boosted mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm), and increased functional synapse density in neuronal cultures. These effects are unique to threonate, as other common Mg(2+) anions failed to have the same results. Mechanistically, threonate's effects were specifically mediated through glucose transporters (GLUTs). We also evaluated the effects of threonate in human neural stem cell-derived neurons, and found it was equally effective at upregulating synapse density. The current study provides an explanation for why threonate is an essential component of L-TAMS and supports the use of L-TAMS to promote cognitive abilities in human.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Clinical studies have shown that about two-thirds of patients with chronic pain suffer from short-term memory (STM) deficits and an effective drug for treatment of the neurological disorder is lacking at present. OBJECTIVE: We tested whether chronic oral application of magnesium L-threonate (MgT), which has been shown to improve memory in normal and aging animals by elevating Mg2+ in the brain, could prevent or restore the STM deficits induced by spared nerve injury (SNI), an animal model of chronic neuropathic pain. The mechanisms underlying the effect of MgT on STM deficits were also investigated. STUDY DESIGN: The experiments were conducted in a random and double-blind fashion in adult male rats. MgT was administrated via drinking water at a dose of 609 mg/kg/d for 2 weeks, starting either one week before SNI (preventative group) or one week after SNI (therapeutic group), and water without the drug served as control. METHODS: STM was accessed with a novel object recognition test (NORT), followed by recording of long-term potentiation (LTP) in the hippocampus in vivo and the measurement of the expression of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) with Western Blot or Immunohistochemistrical staining, a-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole-propionic acid (AMPA) and N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptor (NMDAR) currents were recorded with patch clamp in CA1 neurons in acute and cultured hippocampal slices. RESULT: We found that chronic oral application of MgT was able to prevent and restore the deficits of STM and of LTP at CA3-CA1 synapses in the hippocampus induced by SNI. Furthermore, both preventative and therapeutic chronic oral application of MgT blocked the up-regulation of TNF-α in the hippocampus, which has been previously shown to be critical for memory deficits. SNI reduced NMDAR current and the effect was dramatically attenuated by elevating extracellular Mg2+ concentration ([Mg2+]○). In cultured hippocampal slices, chronic application of recombinant rat TNF-α (rrTNF-α) for 3 days reduced NMDAR current in a concentration-dependent manner and the effect was again blocked by elevating [Mg2+]○. LIMITATIONS: We showed that oral application of MgT inhibited the over-expression of TNF-α and rescued the dysfunction of the NMDAR, but the causal relationship between them remains elusive. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggested that oral application of MgT was able to prevent and restore the STM deficits in an animal model of chronic neuropathic pain by reversing the dysfunction of the NMDAR, and normalization of TNF-α expression may play a role in the effect. Oral application of MgT may be a simple and potent means for handling this form of memory deficit.",

      "abstract": "Elevation of brain magnesium enhances synaptic plasticity and extinction of conditioned fear memories. This experiment examined the generalizability of this phenomenon by studying the effects of a novel magnesium compound, magnesium-L-threonate (MgT), on conditioned taste aversion (CTA) extinction and spontaneous recovery (SR). Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were maintained on a 23-hour water deprivation cycle and acquired a CTA following the taste of a CS [0.3% saccharin+16 mg/ml MgT (SAC+MgT)] paired with a US [81 mg/kg (i.p.) lithium chloride (LiCl)]. Following CTA acquisition, rats drank a water+MgT solution for up to 1 hour/day over the next 31 days. For 14 additional days, some animals continued water+MgT treatment, but others drank water only to allow MgT to be eliminated from the body. We then employed 2 different extinction paradigms: (1) CS-Only (CSO), in which SAC was presented, every-other day, or (2) Explicitly Unpaired (EU), in which both SAC and LiCl were presented, but on alternate days. EU extinction procedures have been shown to speed CTA extinction and reduce spontaneous recovery of the aversion. Throughout extinction, half of the rats in each group continued to drink MgT (now in SAC or supplemental water+MgT solution), whereas the other half drank SAC only/water only until SAC drinking reached ≥90% of baseline (asymptotic extinction). Rats receiving MgT just before/during extinction drank less SAC on the first day of extinction suggesting that they had retained a stronger CTA. MgT enhanced the rate of extinction. Furthermore, the MgT-treated rats showed a relatively modest SR of the CTA 30 days later - indicating that the extinction procedure was more effective for these animals. Our data suggest that long-term dietary MgT may enhance the consolidation/retention of a CTA, speed extinction, and inhibit SR of this learned aversion.",

However, calcium bioavailability of this drug is unknown due to lack of effective evaluation methods. In this study, we sought to measure the bioavailability of calcium L-threonate with a double-label stable isotope method. METHODS: Fourteen healthy Chinese subjects were enrolled in the clinical study and were given 300 mg calcium L-threonate tablets containing 40 mg (44)Ca after an intravenous injection of 4 mg (42)Ca solution (as calcium chloride). Fractional urine samples were collected at the following time intervals: 0-3, 3-6, 6-9, 9-13, 13-24, 24-36 and 36-48 h. The abundance ratios of (44)Ca/(40)Ca and (42)Ca/(40)Ca in the urine were determined with thermal-ionization mass spectrometry (TI-MS). The calcium bioavailability was estimated by calculating the true fractional calcium absorption (TFCA) using the abundance ratios of (44)Ca/(40)Ca and (42)Ca/(40)Ca. RESULTS: The bioavailability of calcium L-threonate in 14 healthy Chinese subjects was 26.49 ± 9.39 %. There was good agreement between TFCA from the 24 to 36 h and the 36 to 48 h urine pool, indicating that calcium balance was achieved at 24 h after dosing. The TFCA of the subjects did not statistically correlate with total urinary calcium excretion (0-48 h). There were no serious adverse events in this study. CONCLUSIONS: The bioavailability of calcium L-threonate in humans was successfully determined by estimating TFCA with the double-label stable isotope method, thus providing a useful approach for the evaluation of bioavailability of calcium formulations.",

Here, we investigated whether or not L-threonate could attenuate DHT-induced DKK-1 expression. We observed via RT-PCR analysis and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay that DHT-induced DKK-1 expression was attenuated in the presence of L-threonate. We also found that DHT-induced activation of DKK-1 promoter activity was significantly repressed by L-threonate. Moreover, a co-culture system featuring outer root sheath (ORS) keratinocytes and DPCs showed that DHT inhibited the growth of ORS cells, which was then significantly reversed by L-threonate. Collectively, these results indicate that L-threonate inhibited DKK-1 expression in DPCs and therefore is a good treatment for the prevention of androgen-driven balding.",
