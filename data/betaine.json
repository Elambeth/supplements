      "abstract": "This study aimed to assess the effect of betaine supplementation on the proteomic profile of the longissimus thoracis muscle in finishing pigs. Thirty-six crossbred female pigs (initial body weight = 88.96 ± 3.48 kg) were allocated in a completely randomized experimental design with two dietary treatments, with nine replications per treatment and two pigs per replication. The experimental diets consisted of a control diet (CON) and the CON diet supplemented with 2.5 g/kg of betaine (BET). At the end of the trial, one pig per unit was slaughtered, and longissimus thoracis (LT) muscle samples were analyzed via mass spectrometry to identify differentially abundant proteins (DAPs). Additionally, the intramuscular fat (IMF) content in the LT muscle was evaluated. Network analyses were performed to identify the biological processes and KEGG pathways. Results indicated that eleven DAPs were down-regulated (q-Value < 0.05) in the BET group compared to the CON group. Most DAPs were associated with carbohydrate metabolism, indicating that betaine may modulate cellular energy metabolism. These proteins were involved in glycolysis, glycogenolysis, the pentose phosphate pathway, and the glucagon signaling pathway. Moreover, pigs in the BET group had higher (P = 0.02) IMF compared to the CON group. In conclusion, betaine supplementation in finishing pigs down-regulated proteins related to carbohydrate metabolism in skeletal muscle, suppressed glucose metabolic processes and carbohydrate catabolic processes. These findings indicate alterations in glucose flow, possibly favoring other metabolic pathways, such as the pentose phosphate pathway. Furthermore, betaine supplementation increased IMF deposition and improved meat tenderness.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) and its precursors, as intestinal metabolites, have already been explored in Parkinson's disease (PD). However, whether such an association reflects the risk of cognitive impairment (CI) remains unclear. The purpose of this research is to analyze the diagnostic value of TMAO and its precursors in the detection of PD-related CI. METHODS: Using high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, plasma TMAO and its precursors were detected from 220 healthy controls (HC) and 234 PD patients who underwent cognitive function assessment. 162 PD patients were enrolled in normal cognitive function group (PD-NCI), while 72 in cognitive impairment group (PD-CI). The expression levels of TMAO and its precursors were compared across different groups. The research carried out logistic regression analysis and built receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves to assess the diagnostic utility of TMAO and its precursors. RESULTS: Compared to HC, there were higher expression levels of TMAO and precursor carnitine and betaine in the PD and PD-CI groups (p < 0.001). A higher plasma TMAO level exists in PD-CI compared to that of PD-NCI (p < 0.001). After adjusting for differentiating variables, logistic regression analysis substantiated the findings. The combination of TMAO and its precursors demonstrated fine predictive value with high sensitivity and specificity with areas under the ROC curve (AUCs) of 0.880, 0.707, and 0.941 for distinguishing between PD and HC, PD-NCI and PD-CI, and PD-CI and HC, respectively. CONCLUSION: TMAO and its metabolic precursors are potential biomarkers for early identification of cognitive dysfunction, offering timely opportunities for intervention in PD patients."

      "abstract": "Betaine plays a crucial role in regulating the physiological metabolism of plant fruits and exhibits specific biological activities across animals, plants, and microorganisms. This review highlights that betaine can serve as a nutritional supplement with antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antifungal properties. Specifically, through its antioxidant activity, betaine enhances liver detoxification, reduces cell apoptosis, potentially mitigates the progression of liver fibrosis, and exerts beneficial effects on radiation-induced liver injury. A growing body of research utilizing animal models has indicated that betaine, due to its unique bioactivity, may be integral to both human health and industrial progress. However, there remains a notable scarcity of reviews focusing on the biological synthesis of betaine. This paper presents a comprehensive and up-to-date account of the natural sources and concentrations of betaine, encompassing its biosynthetic pathways, bioactive functions, and potential mechanisms underlying its effects on human health. Special emphasis is placed on the biological effects of betaine in animal therapy as well as its mechanisms influencing human health. Furthermore, recommendations are offered for optimizing the utilization of betaine."

      "abstract": "In this report, we present the case of a 16-month-old patient who was diagnosed with cobalamin G deficiency at 4 months of age via whole exome sequencing by detecting compound heterozygous variants of uncertain significance (VUS) in the MTR gene: (1) c.1283T>A, p.Met428Lys; (2) c.2411T>C, p.Ile804Thr. Before the diagnosis, the initial clinical presentation included failure to thrive, skin hyperpigmentation, hypotonia, seizures, and developmental delay. We initiated the treatment with high-dose parenteral hydroxocobalamin, oral betaine, and folinic acid at 5 months of age (right after receiving WES report). His symptoms, such as skin hyperpigmentation, seizure resolution, developmental delay, and anemia, improved rapidly after the treatment initiation. With treatment, his homocysteine levels declined rapidly and significantly from 117.08 μmol/L at 5 months to 20.23 μmol/L at 5 months and 2 weeks of age. Further, methionine levels increased with treatment from 9.26 μM at 5 months to 14.05 μM at 5 months and 2 weeks of age. The patient is currently receiving intramuscular hydroxocobalamin (2 mg/kg), oral betaine (200 mg/kg), and oral folinic acid (7.5 mg) daily without adverse effects. This case demonstrates the safety and efficacy of early high-dose parenteral hydroxocobalamin, and oral betaine and folinic acid treatment for cobalamin G deficiency. Moreover, given the patient's clinical manifestations, serologic data, and rapid response to therapy, the MTR gene variant previously classified as a VUS should be reclassified as pathogenic and necessitating early diagnosis and treatment."

      "abstract": "Plants are constantly subjected to various abiotic stresses (drought, salinity, heavy metals and low temperature) throughout their life cycle, which significantly hinder their growth and productivity. Key abiotic stresses include drought, salinity, heavy metals, and extreme temperatures. In response, plants modulate glycine betaine (GB) levels, a vital compatible solute that influences growth and stress tolerance by interacting with phytohormones and cellular signaling pathways. Not all species can synthesize endogenous GB; however, some non-GB accumulating plants have been genetically modified to enhance GB production through the overexpression of synthesis genes such as choline oxidase, choline monooxygenase, and betaine aldehyde dehydrogenase. Exogenous GB treatment can mitigate stress effects by improving nutritional balance, reducing reactive oxygen species (ROS), minimizing membrane damage, and alleviating photoinhibition. Nonetheless, the specificity of GB application, transport, and accumulation across species, as well as its interaction with phytohormones in stress alleviation, remains uncertain. This review focuses on GB's role as an antioxidant, osmo-regulator, and nitrogen source, evaluating the physiological, biochemical, and molecular mechanisms by which GB mitigates abiotic stresses, aiming to develop GB-based strategies for enhancing plant stress resilience.",

      "abstract": "Glycine betaine (GB), a secondary metabolite that regulates plant responses to biotic and abiotic stresses, may help reduce pesticide phytotoxicity, but this fact remains unestablished. This study investigated the physiological response of rice (Oryza sativa) to six dosages of oxyfluorfen (OFF) (0-0.25 mg/L) and two concentrations of GB (0 and 175 mg/L). GB treatment counteracted the considerable decrease in rice seedling growth caused by OFF treatment at doses higher than 0.15 mg/L. The biochemical processes and catalytic events associated with OFF-triggered degradation in rice were investigated using RNA-Seq-LC-Q-TOF-HRMS/MS after six rice root and shoot libraries were created and subjected to either OFF or OFF-GB. Rice treated with both GB and an ecologically relevant dose of OFF showed a marked upregulation of 1039 root genes and 111 shoot genes compared with those treated with OFF alone. Multiple OFF-degradative enzymes implicated in molecular metabolism and xenobiotic tolerance to environmental stress were identified by gene enrichment analysis. In comparison to treated with 0.25 mg/L OFF alone, exogenous GB administration decreased OFF accumulation, with the OFF concentration in roots being 44.47 % and in shoots being 51.03 %. The production of essential enzymes involved in the OFF decay process was attributed to certain genes with variable expression, including cytochrome P450, methyltransferase, glycosyltransferases, and acetyltransferases. Using LC-Q-TOF-HRMS/MS, 3 metabolites and 16 conjugates were identified in metabolic pathways including hydrolysis, acetylation, glycosylation, and interaction with amino acids in order to enhance OFF-degradative metabolism. All things considered, by reducing phytotoxicity and OFF buildup, external GB treatment can increase rice's resistance to oxidative stress caused by OFF. This study offers valuable insights into the function of GB in enhancing OFF degradation, which may have ramifications for designing genotypes that maximize OFF accumulation in rice crops and promote OFF degradation in paddy crops."

      "abstract": "Soil salinity is one of the most challenging environmental factors affecting rice productivity, particularly in regions with high saline soils such as Egypt. The ability of rice to maintain high yield and quality under saline stress is often limited, leading to significant reductions in productivity. With the increasing salinization of agricultural lands, finding effective agronomic practices and treatments to mitigate salt-induced damage in rice crops is critical for ensuring food security. This study investigates the potential of exogenous glycine betaine (GB) and proline (Pro) applications to mitigate the adverse effects of salt stress on rice (cv. Sakha 108) over two consecutive growing seasons (2021-2022). Treatments of 30 mM GB and 30 mM Pro significantly enhanced dry weight (162.2 and 169.7 g in 2021 and 2022, respectively), plant height (88.94 and 99.00 cm), tiller number (10.58 and 10.33), and grain yield (4.22 and 4.30 t/ha) compared to control groups. Combined treatments of 30 mM GB and 30 mM Pro exhibited the greatest improvements across both years, with maximum dry weight (193.44 and 186.56 g), plant height (112.00 and 112.33 cm), tiller number (15.33 and 16.28), spikelet number per meter (264.00 and 264.05), thousand-kernel weight (70.00 and 73.2 g), and grain yield (6.17 and 6.64 t/ha). Additionally, the combined treatments resulted in the highest harvest index (53.22% in 2021 and 48.94% in 2022), amylose content (24.24% and 20.09%), and protein content (12.33% and 12.00%). Correlation analysis highlighted strong positive relationships among traits, such as plant height with grain yield (r = 0.94), biomass yield (r = 0.92), and harvest index (r = 0.90). Path analysis further demonstrated that thousand-kernel weight and biomass yield had the most significant direct effects on grain yield, with values of 0.43 and 0.42, respectively. Heatmap clustering and principal component analysis (PCA) confirmed the synergistic effects of combined GB and Pro treatments, with the 30P_30GB treatment consistently clustering with high-yield traits, enhancing nitrogen use efficiency and stress resilience. In conclusion, the combined application of glycine betaine and proline significantly enhances the agronomic and chemical traits of rice under salt stress. This study demonstrates that these osmoprotectants improve vegetative growth, grain yield, and quality, with synergistic effects observed at optimal concentrations. The findings highlight the potential of glycine betaine and proline as effective tools for improving salt tolerance in rice, offering practical solutions to address challenges in saline-affected agricultural regions.",

Twenty-eight 35-day-old male Jiangnan white geese with similar body weight (BW) and good health conditions were randomized into four groups (seven birds per group). All the birds were housed with the same type of basal diet. The control group was treated with normal saline intraperitoneally (I.P.); the AZA group was treated I.P. with AZA (2 mg/kg); the betaine group was fed with betaine through the diet and treated I.P. with normal saline (1.2 g/kg); the AZA+betaine group was fed with betaine through the diet and treated I.P. with AZA. The results showed that the administration of AZA significantly increased serum levels of total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and VNN1 enzyme activity (p < 0.05); additionally, the expression levels of the molecules in various tissues were up-regulated to different extents, such as VNN1, fatty acid synthase (FAS), acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), stearoyl-CoA dehydrogenase (SCD), and sterol regulatory element binding protein (SREBP); in contrast, the treatment of betaine reduced serum TC levels and the S-adenosylmethionine/S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAM/SAH) ratio; furthermore, hepatic DNA methylation in the AZA group was decreased in terms of the VNN1 promoter region. The results demonstrated that the expression of the VNN1 gene was negatively correlated with DNA methylation. This finding verified the key role of VNN1 and its methylation in the inhibition of liver lipid synthesis by betaine and provided a novel molecular mechanism for the regulation of liver lipid metabolism."

The present study aimed to investigate the effect of betaine on growth performance, methionine metabolism, and methyl transfer in broilers aged 1 to 21 days fed a low-methionine diet. A total of 960 one-day-old male broilers were randomly divided into four groups: positive control (0.62% methionine in the diet), negative control (0.37% methionine in the diet), and two treatment groups (0.37% methionine in the diet plus either 1500 or 3000 mg betaine/kg diet). Chicks fed the 1500 mg betaine/kg diet had the highest feed-to-gain ratio (P < 0.05), but no significant difference in final body weight, average daily gain, average daily feed intake, or mortality. Serum S-adenosyl-L-methionine and total homocysteine were higher at 1500 mg betaine/kg diet; whereas serum S-adenosylhomocysteine exhibited the opposite trend. Except for DNA methyltransferase 1, key enzymes and metabolites involved in the hepatic single-carbon pathway showed the highest levels at 1500 mg betaine/kg diet and declined thereafter. Furthermore, betaine promoted dose-dependent mRNA and protein expression of enzymes involved in the hepatic single-carbon metabolic cycle and methyl transferase pathways in chicks fed methionine-deficient diets. In conclusion, while the addition of betaine did not significantly improve the growth performance of chicks aged 1-21 days, inclusion of 1500 mg betaine/kg diet effectively stabilized methionine metabolism and methyl transfer in methionine-deficient diets."

However, its poor water solubility, low bioavailability, and potential side effects, such as allergies, irritation, and dryness, hinder its widespread application. In this study, we prepared a betaine-salicylic acid (BeSA) cocrystal and systematically characterized its crystal structure, biological activity, and clinical efficacy. The results showed that BeSA has significantly lower irritancy and cytotoxicity than SA, but exhibits excellent anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties as well as high moisturizing and anti-acne efficacy, making it a potential alternative to SA. Further, quantum chemical calculations and molecular docking simulations were conducted to investigate the intrinsic mechanisms underlying the excellent bioactivity of BeSA cocrystals. This study introduces an innovative solution for safer and more effective skincare formulations based on SA and offers theoretical guidance regarding material engineering and further material optimization, which has crucial implications for both industry and academia."

      "abstract": "Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) is a major predisposing factor of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis, hepatic fibrosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Abnormal RNA m6A modification leads to the disturbance of lipid metabolism, insulin resistance, and chronic inflammation, all of which are critical for the onset and progression of MASLD. It has been shown that betaine supplementation has an ameliorative effect on symptoms associated with MASLD. The purpose of this study is to explore the role of RNA m6A modification in the alleviation of MASLD by betaine, and to find out the possible targets of betaine. Methylated RNA immunoprecipitation sequencing (MeRIP-seq) and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) were respectively employed to contrast m6A methylation profiles of livers from high-fat diet mice with betaine supplementation vs. those without betaine supplementation (HB vs. HFD). Functional enrichment analysis showed that up-methylated genes are mainly related to mTOR signaling pathway, Rap1 signaling pathway and MAPK signaling pathway. In addition, differentially expressed mRNAs were enriched in pathways such as promoting lipid catabolism and reducing lipid accumulation. By combining analyses of MeRIP-seq and RNA-seq, we identified 27 genes exhibiting significant differences in m6A abundance and mRNA levels. Notably, a new candidate gene, Trub2, was screened out and identified. Inhibition of Trub2 increased intracellular TG levels in AML12 cells, and this promotion was reduced by betaine, suggesting that betaine reduces intracellular TG levels by increasing Trub2 expression. Our findings in this study provide a new target and a new approach for the treatment of MASLD.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Betaine is an effective antioxidant and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is an inflammatory stimulus that can disrupt the antioxidant system. However, the precise mechanisms of betaine's antioxidant activity remain undetermined. This study aimed to examine the impact of betaine on growth, antioxidant capacity, and inflammatory cytokine production in LPS-challenged goslings. In this study, 168 healthy Jiangnan White Goslings (males, 15 days old) were selected and randomly categorized into four groups. There were 7 goslings per replicate and 6 replicates for each treatment. This study employed a 2 × 2 factorial arrangement, the goslings were provided a diet containing 0% or 0.06% betaine and were injected with physiological saline or LPS. RESULTS: Subsequent analyses revealed that on day 21 of LPS treatment, there was a significant decrease in gosling's ADFI, ADG, and BW, whereas dietary betaine supplementation improved ADFI and BW in LPS-stressed individuals (p = 0.08, p = 0.09). LPS challenge significantly upregulated pro-inflammatory interleukin-1β (IL-1β) mRNA (p < 0.05), whereas betaine significantly lowered these levels (p < 0.05). During the LPS stress period (days 16-21), the superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity and total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC) were significantly reduced, while malondialdehyde (MDA) levels were increased in the liver and jejunal mucosa (p < 0.05). Betaine administration reversed these changes and significantly increased SOD and T-AOC levels while decreasing the MDA content (p < 0.05). However, both LPS and betaine did not affect the mRNA levels of SOD1 or glutathione peroxidase 4 (GSH-Px4) in the liver or jejunal mucosa during the stress (days 16-21) or recovery (days 22-28) periods. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, these analyses revealed that dietary betaine administration can effectively abrogate LPS-induced oxidative liver damage.",

      "abstract": "The mecA gene confers methicillin resistance in both MRSA and MR-CoNS by encoding the PBP2a protein and poses a significant public health threat due to its resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics. Rapid and accurate detection of mecA is critical for timely treatment, reducing morbidity, and preventing its spread in healthcare settings. In this study, we developed an advanced one-pot recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA)-CRISPR/Cas12a system, enhanced with glycerol and betaine, for ultrasensitive detection of the mecA gene. Glycerol's viscosity effect prevents premature interaction between Cas12a and early amplification products, while betaine enhances nucleic acid amplification. The assay demonstrated superior sensitivity, detecting as low as 5 copies/μL of mecA DNA within 60 min. Specificity testing against a panel of bacterial species confirmed the high selectivity of the assay for mecA-carrying strains with negligible cross-reactivity. Furthermore, this method exhibited excellent performance across various clinical samples, including blood, urine, and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Our findings underscore the potential of this advanced RPA-CRISPR/Cas12a assay as a powerful diagnostic tool for rapid, cost-effective, and highly sensitive mecA detection, offering a promising solution for clinical diagnostics and infection control."

      "abstract": "Persimmon fruit is highly susceptible to chilling injury (CI) during cold storage. Notably, glycine betaine (GB), a compound that helps regulate cell osmotic balance, can alleviate postharvest CI in various fruits. In this study, the postharvest application of GB increased chilling tolerance, delayed CI, and reduced the CI index in 'Youhou' sweet persimmon fruit during cold storage. Moreover, GB treatment markedly decreased the O2 -· production rate and malondialdehyde (MDA) and H2O2 content while significantly increasing the ascorbic amounts of acid and glutathione (GSH). Compared with the control group, GB treatment increased activities of antioxidant enzymes such as glutathione reductase (GR), glutathione peroxidase (GPX), ascorbate peroxidase (APX), catalase (CAT), and superoxide dismutase (SOD). GB treatment also reduced the activities of phenylalanine ammonia-lyase, polyphenol oxidase, and peroxidase. RNA sequencing revealed that GB treatment significantly altered gene expression linked to sugar metabolism, GSH metabolism, and phenylpropanoid biosynthesis. This study provides novel insights into the regulatory mechanisms of GB treatment alleviating CI in postharvest persimmon fruit. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: 'Youhou' sweet persimmons are prone to rapid softening after harvest. This softening process can be limited through cold storage; this can also result in chilling injury (CI). The research findings suggest that glycine betaine (GB) treatment delays 'Youhou' persimmon fruit softening and alleviates CI during cold storage. GB application could be a feasible technique for extending the storage life of 'Youhou' sweet persimmon fruit.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Childhood asthma is a heterogeneous disease that exhibits different characteristics and varying severity; however, the metabolite alterations underlying the difference in asthma severity, especially in severe asthma, are not well understood. The aim of this study was to identify the plasma metabolic profile of children with different asthma severity and explore the potential intervention targets in severe asthma and glucocorticoid resistance. METHODS: Untargeted liquid chromatography mass spectrometry was utilized to analyze plasma metabolites in 54 children with mild-to-moderate asthma, 50 children with severe asthma and 39 healthy controls. Multivariate statistical analyses were used to explore plasma metabolic alterations that were strongly associated with asthma severity. Meanwhile, the severe allergic airway inflammation mice with glucocorticoid resistance were constructed to validate the potential therapeutic capacity of metabolites. RESULTS: The plasma metabolic profiles of children with mild to moderate asthma and severe asthma exhibited significant alterations. The distinct plasma metabolite shifts were accompanied by functional alterations in lipid metabolism, particularly choline metabolism, glycerophospholipids and sphingolipid metabolism. 11-cis-retinol, LysoPC (20:4 [8Z,11Z,14Z,17Z]), and glycerophosphatidylcholine were associated with exacerbated airway inflammation and lung function. Furthermore, 2-Hydroxyestradiol, LysoPC (18:3 [6Z,9Z,12Z]), zeaxanthin, and betaine were shifted exclusively in the severe asthma group and may serve as potential biomarkers. Subsequent in vivo studies demonstrated that betaine supplementation partially improved glucocorticoid resistance. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, children with different asthma severity displayed distinct plasma metabolic patterns. These may contribute to the difference in response to glucocorticoids in childhood asthma and could be potential targets and interventions."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The cartilage tissue regeneration mediated with mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) is considered as a viable strategy for temporomandibular joint osteoarthritis (TMJOA). Betaine has been confirmed to modulate the multidirectional differentiation of MSCs, while its effect on chondrogenic differentiation of Stem Cells from the Apical Papilla (SCAPs) is unknown. Here, we explored the effects and underlying mechanisms of betaine on chondrogenic differentiation of SCAPs. METHODS: Betaine was added for SCAPs chondrogenic induction. The chondrogenic differentiation potential was assessed using Alcian Blue staining, Sirius Red staining and the main chondrogenic markers. In vivo cartilage regeneration effects were evaluated by the rat TMJOA model. RNA-sequencing and biological analyses were performed to select target genes and biological processes involved. The mechanism betaine acts on chondrogenic differentiation of SCAPs was further explored. RESULTS: Betain-treated SCAPs demonstrated stronger cartilage regeneration in vitro and promoted cartilage repair of TMJOA in vivo. Betaine enhanced the expression of WDR81 in SCAPs during chondrogenesis. WDR81 overexpression promoted chondrogenic differentiation of SCAPs, while WDR81 depletion inhibited chondrogenic differentiation. In addition, both betaine treatment and WDR81 overexpression reduced intracellular reactive oxygen species levels and increased mitochondrial membrane potential in SCAPs. CONCLUSION: Betaine promotes SCAPs chondrogenic differentiation and provided an effective candidate for TMJOA treatment. WDR81 may serve as the potential drug target through mitophagy.",

      "abstract": "Toxicity is associated with undue sodium fluoride (NaF) exposure, and Betaine (BET) is recognised for its nutraceutical benefits. Although it is necessary to reduce toxic level exposure to fluoride, the literature lacks information on the role of BET in mitigating fluoride-induced reproductive toxicity. Therefore, this study assesses the impact of BET on NaF-induced reproductive perturbation in male rats. Wistar rats were treated with NaF (9 mg/kg) alone or co-treated with BET (50 or 100 mg/kg) for 28 d. Our findings indicate that BET significantly mitigated alterations in sperm functionality indices caused by NaF treatment. BET substantially increased reproductive hormone levels and averted NaF-induced increases in oxidative stress biomarkers and testicular enzymes. NaF-induced increases in inflammatory markers in the testis, epididymis, and hypothalamus were effectively reversed upon BET co-treatment. Also, co-treatment with BET protected genome integrity, as evidenced by p53 and apoptotic markers Bax and Bcl-2 levels, abating damages in the testes, epididymis, and hypothalamus of NaF-treated rats. Also, our findings from in-silico studies revealed that BET moderately inhibits the molecular activation of the inhibitor of nuclear factor-κB kinase, hypoxia-inducible factor -1 alpha, and proviral integration for the Moloney murine leukaemia virus-1 kinase. While it is preferable to reduce fluoride exposure, the relevant findings here indicate that BET exhibits anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and anti-apoptotic properties that ameliorate inadvertent NaF-mediated toxicities in experimental rats exposed to NaF."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Skin wounds are highly common in diabetic patients, and with increasing types of pathogenic bacteria and antibiotic resistance, wounds and infections in diabetic patients are difficult to treat and heal. AIM: To explore the effects of betaine ointment (BO) in promoting the healing of skin wounds and reducing the inflammation and apoptosis of skin cells in microbially infected diabetic mice. METHODS: By detecting the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of betaine and plant monomer components such as psoralen, we prepared BO with betaine as the main ingredient, blended it with traditional Chinese medicines such as gromwell root and psoralen, and evaluated its antibacterial effects and safety in vitro and in vivo. The skin infection wound models of ordinary mice and diabetic mice were constructed, and the OTC drugs mupirocin ointment and Zicao ointment were used as controls to evaluate the antibacterial effects in vivo and the anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic effects of BO. RESULTS: The MICs of betaine against microorganisms such as Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), Candida albicans and Cryptococcus neoformans ranged from 4 to 32 μg/mL. Gromwell root and psoralea, both of which contain antimicrobial components, mixed to prepare BO with MICs ranging from 16 to 64 μg/mL, which is 32-256 times lower than those of Zicao ointment, although the MIC is greater than that of betaine. After 15 days of treatment with BO for USA300-infected ordinary mice, the wound scab removal rates were 83.3%, while those of mupirocin ointment and Zicao ointment were 66.7% and 0%, respectively, and the differences were statistically significant. In diabetic mice, the wound scab removal rate of BO and mupirolacin ointment was 80.0%, but BO reduced wound inflammation and the apoptosis of skin cells and facilitated wound healing. CONCLUSION: The ointment prepared by mixing betaine and traditional Chinese medicine can effectively inhibit common skin microorganisms and has a strong effect on the skin wounds of sensitive or drug-resistant S. aureus-infected ordinary mice and diabetic mice."

This study demonstrates the potential of a king grass-Serratia marcescens strain S27 (KS) co-symbiotic system to enhance heavy metal remediation. The KS symbiosis increased the biomass of king grass by 48 % and enhanced the accumulation of Cd and Cr in the whole plant by 2.75-fold and 1.82-fold, respectively. Root exudates like γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), glycine betaine (GB), and allantoin (Alla) were tested for enhancing the KS symbiotic, with 0.75 mM GB (GB3X-KS) showing the highest removal efficiencies at 15.1 % for Cd and 14.2 % for Cr. Correlation analysis indicated a link between this enhancement and increased soil nitrogen content. Mechanistic studies revealed GB treatment altered the rhizosphere microbial community, promoting denitrifying bacteria and upregulating nitrogen transformation genes (nrfA) by over 7-fold. GB also enhanced nitrogen assimilation enzymes and antioxidant defenses in king grass, facilitating Cd and Cr transport and sequestration. X-ray fluorescence imaging and two-dimensional correlation spectroscopy showed GB promoted Cd and Cr accumulation in the xylem and phloem of king grass, with phenols and alcohols as key functional groups.

Glycine betaine (GB), an osmotic regulator, is widely applied in crop resistance to abiotic stress. This study investigates the role of GB and its biosynthetic enzyme CsBADH in enhancing cold tolerance in tea plants. Two cultivars, 'Shuchazao' (cold-resistant) and 'Baiye 1' (cold-sensitive), were subjected to low temperature stress (0 °C). GB accumulation was measured, revealing that 'Shuchazao' exhibited 1.4-fold higher GB levels than 'Baiye 1', suggesting a link between higher GB accumulation and cold tolerance. Exogenous GB treatment improved cold resistance, especially in the cold-sensitive cultivar 'Baiye 1'. The CsBADH gene, a key enzyme in GB biosynthesis, was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli, confirming its activity. Transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana, Nicotiana tabacum, and C. sinensis plants overexpressing CsBADH showed increased GB levels (1.5- to 2.4-fold), proline content, peroxidase (POD) activities, and enhanced cold tolerance, while silencing CsBADH decreased GB accumulation and cold resistance. These findings demonstrate that CsBADH plays a critical role in cold stress response by promoting GB accumulation, offering potential strategies for improving the resilience of tea and other leaf crops to cold stress.",

The study was carried out to explore the protective effect and potential mechanism of betaine on early FLS. METHODS: There were three groups: Con group (basal diet), FLS group (Dexamethasone injection + basal diet) and betaine group (Dexamethasone injection + basal diet with 8 g/kg betaine). Birds in FLS and betaine groups were treated with subcutaneous dexamethasone injection once a day at a dosage of 4.50 mg/kg body weight for 7 days. RESULTS: The results revealed that DXM treatment significantly increased the liver index, serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST), total protein (TP), total bilirubin (TBIL), total biliary acid (TBA), total cholesterol (TC), high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c), low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c), and glucose (GLU) (p < 0.05). Additionally, hepatic TC and TG levels were also elevated (p < 0.05). Meanwhile, H&E and oil red O staining showed that there were a large number of vacuoles and lipid droplets in the liver of hens in FLS group. Dietary betaine addition significantly alleviated the increasing of serum TBIL, TBA and hepatic TC caused by dexamethasone treatment (p < 0.05). There existed 1,083 up- and 996 down-regulated genes in FLS group when compared with the control, and there were 169 upregulation and 405 downregulation genes in BT group when compared with FLS group. A total of 37 differential expression genes (DEGs) were rescued by betaine addition, which were related to lipid metabolism and antioxidant functions including APOC3, APOA4, G0S2, ERG28, PLA2G3, GPX4 and SLC5A8. Serum metabolomics analysis showed that 151 differential metabolites were identified in FLS group when compared with the control. Dietary betaine addition could rescue the changes of metabolites partly such as chicoric acid, gamma-aminobutyric acid, linoleic acid, telmisartan, which were associated with anti-oxidative function. In addition, RT-PCR results showed that genes involved in lipid metabolism, such as ACC, FAS, SCD1, ELOVL6, SREBP1, GR, ATGL and MTTP were markedly upregulated at the mRNA level (p < 0.05). However, dietary supplementation with betaine can reversed the expression of these genes (p < 0.05). Importantly, dietary betaine supplementation could reverse increased lipid synthesis partly by regulating PI3K/AKT/SREBP and CEBPα pathways in the liver based on western blot results (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Dexamethasone treatment could establish the early FLS model in laying hens with hepatic lipid accumulation and no inflammation, which could be attenuated by dietary betaine addition."

Betaine is thought to be a promising hepatoprotective agent. The current investigation focused on whether orally administered PET-NPs caused hepatotoxicity and ameliorative effect of betaine. Forty adult male Swiss albino mice were randomly split into four groups: group I control, group II betaine (1000 mg/kg I/P), group III PET-NPs (200 mg/kg orally), and group IV betaine plus PET-NPs at doses similar to group II& III respectively. After 30 days, blood sample were collected then animals were euthanized and liver specimens were dissected out for biochemical and histopathological examination. PET-NPs induced a significant elevation in alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and malondialdehyde (MDA), as well as an increase in the inflammatory genes a proto-oncogene (c-FOS) and cyclooxygenase 2 (COX2) (p ≤ 0.05), with a substantial decrease in glutathione (GSH) (p ≤ 0.05). Furthermore, on the level of histopathological analysis PET-NPs caused alterations in hepatic tissue architecture as vascular dilatation and congestion with hepatocytes degeneration, bile duct epithelial hyperplasia and inflammatory cell infiltrations While on the level of immunohistochemistry, PET-NPs trigger positive tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-ҠB) expression in comparison to control. Meanwhile, betaine treatment reduced the deleterious effects of PET-NPs. To summarize, PET-NPs may cause hepatotoxicity in mice, with a belief that betaine could mitigate the detrimental impact.",

      "abstract": "Chronic diabetes wound repairing is still a huge challenge in clinical practice. High concentration of reactive oxygen species and vascular disfunction are the main factors hindering the recovery of diabetes wounds. This research grafted betaine onto chitosan (CSBT) to enhance the antibacterial property and the CSBT was cross-linked with PEO90 dialdehyde (PEO DA) to prepare hydrogel with Ca2+ loading to promote the coagulation. The polydopamine nanoparticles (PDA NPs) with photothermal property and antioxidant property was composited to the hydrogel and deferoxamine (DFO) was loaded to fabricate the multifunctional CBPCa/PDA/DFO hydrogel to promote vascular regeneration in combination with photothermal antibacterial performance for the diabetes wounds treatment. The CBPCa/PDA/DFO hydrogel showed good mechanical strength, injectability, anti-inflammatory property and coagulation performance. Furthermore, the antibacterial effect of chitosan based hydrogel was enhanced with near infrared (NIR) stimulated photothermal treatment. Combined with the photothermal effect and the angiogenic drug DFO release, the CBPCa/PDA/DFO hydrogel significantly enhanced vascular regeneration and reduced the inflammation in the in vivo wound repairing experiment. As a result, the CBPCa/PDA/DFO hydrogel may provide a promising therapeutic platform for diabetic trauma repairing.",

      "abstract": "Excessive fluoride exposure beyond the tolerable limit may adversely impacts brain functionality. Betaine (BET), a trimethyl glycine, possesses antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic functions, although the underlying mechanisms of the role of BET on fluoride-induced neurotoxicity remain unelucidated. To assess the mechanism involved in the neuro-restorative role of BET on behavioural, neurochemical, and histological changes, we employed a rat model of sodium fluoride (NaF) exposure. Animals were treated with NaF (9 mg/kg) body weight (bw) only or co-treated with BET (50 and 100 mg/kg bw) orally uninterrupted for 28 days. We obtained behavioural phenotypes in an open field, performed negative geotaxis, and a forelimb grip test, followed by oxido-inflammatory, apoptotic, and histological assessment. Behavioural endpoints indicated lessened locomotive and motor and heightened anxiety-like performance and upregulated oxidative, inflammatory, and apoptotic biomarkers in NaF-exposed rats. Co-treatment with BET significantly enhanced locomotive, motor, and anxiolytic performance, increased the antioxidant signalling mechanisms and demurred oxidative, inflammatory, and apoptotic biomarkers and histoarchitectural damage in the cerebrum and cerebellum cortices mediated by NaF. The in-silico analysis suggests that multiple hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions of BET with critical amino acid residues, including arginine (ARG380 and ARG415) in the Keap1 Kelch domain, which may disrupt Keap1-Nrf2 complex and activate Nrf2. This may account for the observed increased in the Nrf2 levels, elevated antioxidant response and enhanced anti-inflammatory response. The BET-Keap1 complex was also observed to exhibit structural stability and conformational flexibility in solvated biomolecular systems, as indicated by the thermodynamic parameters computed from the trajectories obtained from a 100 ns full atomistic molecular dynamics simulation. Therefore, BET mediates neuroprotection against NaF-induced cerebro-cerebellar damage through rats' antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-apoptotic activity, which molecular interactions with Keap1-Nrf2 may drive.",

Brassinosteroids (BRs) play a crucial role in enhancing plant tolerance to abiotic stress, yet their potential in mitigating salt stress in pepper plants, particularly by promoting sugar and glycine betaine accumulation, remains underexplored. In this study, we investigated the effects of the foliar application of 2,4-epibrassinolide (EBR) on salt-stressed pepper seedlings. Our findings revealed that EBR treatment significantly increased the levels of proline, sugar, and glycine betaine under salt stress compared to untreated controls. Moreover, EBR enhanced the antioxidant defense mechanisms in pepper seedlings by increasing sugar and glycine betaine levels, which contributed to the reduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and malondialdehyde (MDA) accumulation."

This approach enhances both biomass yield （380.83 mg L-1 d-1）and resistance to lead toxicity. Analytical assessments revealed that glycine betaine (GB) supplementation drastically reduced lead accumulation, decreasing the extracellular and intracellular contents by 39.7 % and 60.7 %, respectively. A notable decrease in extracellular dissolved organic matter was also observed. Furthermore, transcriptomic analyses confirmed that GB treatment strengthened osmotic stress responses and suppressed metal ion transport.

Herein, ultrasmall CuS NPs modified with polyzwitterion containing acylsulfonamide betaine (PCBSA@CuS), which provides a sensitive and reversible charge conversion around pH 6.8, are used to enhance the healing of bacteria-infected wounds. In the acidic infection microenvironment, the majority of PCBSA@CuS can electrostatically adsorb onto bacterial cells through cationic exposure, resulting in direct damage and death of bacteria upon NIR irradiation. Additionally, the photothermal NPs rapidly return to a zwitterionic nature in normal physiological environments, ensuring lower affinity and avoiding thermal damage to healthy tissues during continuous PTT. Compared to inert photothermal systems such as PEG-modified CuS NPs, the NPs used in this study exhibited higher bactericidal and wound healing efficacy. Therefore, this nano-antibacterial agent with highly sensitive thermal-targeting function provides a novel photothermal strategy for efficient and biosafe treatment of infected wounds.",

Fluorescent carbon dots have been synthesized using jamun juice (Syzygium cumini) as the carbon source subjected to surface modification with betaine (BT@JCD). This BT@JCD exhibits strong blue fluorescence, which significantly decreases in the presence of Cr(VI) due to the inner filter effect in a range of 5-450 nM with a detection limit of 0.033 μM. Due to its easy translocation in the vascular bundles, these fluorescence nanosensors can be applied to detect Cr(VI) in rice plants Oryza sativa) through fluorescence confocal imaging.

      "abstract": "Background/objectives: The porcine intestinal epithelium plays a fundamental role as a defence interface against pathogens. Its alteration can cause severe inflammatory conditions and diseases. Hyperosmotic stress under physiological conditions and upon pathogen challenge can cause malabsorption. Different cell types counteract the osmolarity increase by accumulating organic osmolytes such as betaine, taurine, and myo-inositol through specific transporters. Betaine is known for protecting cells from hyperosmotic stress and has positive effects when fed to pigs. The aim of this study is to demonstrate the modulation of osmolyte transporters gene expression in IPEC-J2 during osmolarity changes and assess the effects of betaine. Methods: IPEC-J2 were seeded in transwells, where differentiate as a polarized monolayer. Epithelial cell integrity (TEER), oxidative stress (NO) and gene expression of osmolyte transporters, tight junction proteins (TJp) and pro-inflammatory cytokines were evaluated. Results: Cells treated with NaCl hyperosmolar medium (500 mOsm/L) showed a TEER decrease at 3 h and detachment within 24 h, associated with an osmolyte transporters reduction. IPEC-J2 treated with mannitol hyperosmolar medium (500 mOsm/L) upregulated taurine (TauT), myo-inositol (SMIT) and betaine (BGT1) transporters expression. A decrease in TJp expression was associated with a TEER decrease and an increase in TNFα, IL6, and IL8. Betaine could attenuate the hyperosmolarity-induced reduction in TEER and TJp expression, the NO increase and cytokines upregulation. Conclusions: This study demonstrates the expression of osmolyte transporters in IPEC-J2, which was upregulated upon hyperosmotic treatment. Betaine counteracts changes in intracellular osmolarity by contributing to maintaining the epithelial barrier function and reducing the inflammatory condition. Compatible osmolytes may provide beneficial effects in therapies for diseases characterized by inflammation and TJp-related dysfunctions."

This study investigated the application, in continuous treatment, of polymeric bubbles produced with cationic polymer P2900 and cocamidopropyl betaine (CAPB), a zwitterionic surfactant. The proposed reagent combination aims to form aerated flakes, solid waste structures, and rapidly rising air bubbles, ideal for treatments in compact units. Using this combination, it was possible to achieve a total solids concentration of 45% with the modified bubbles and 25% with the conventional water treatment. This level of thickening occurred under the following operating conditions: initial total solids (TS) concentration of 10 g L-1, a flow rate of 5 L min-1, saturation pressure (psat) of 3 atm, and polymer dosage of 10 mg (gTS)-1. The suggested mechanism of action involves the adhesion of P2900 molecules to CAPB at the air/water interface, forming a lining on the bubble surface. Additionally, polymerized species form due to the residual aluminum (Al) in the sludge, which would occur during flocculation in the helical tubular flocculator (HTF), adsorbing the micelles and bubbles of CAPB. The critical micellar concentration (CMC) of CAPB was 0.26 mmol L-1. Polymeric bubble technology can provide an efficient and cost-effective approach to sludge thickening in continuous treatment.",

This process ultimately leads to prolonged hospital stays and increased cost of burn wound care, especially in developing countries. Hence, large-area biofilm-targeted therapy should be a mainstay in burn wound care. Polyhexanide is a polymer used as a disinfectant, and betaine is a surfactant. We report a patient managed with a combined preparation of the above two substances. A 44-year-old patient sustained a 22% superficial partial-thickness and mid-dermal burns on the back and right arm after a high-voltage electrocution injury. The patient was treated with dressings containing the above preparation and closely monitored for the healing stages of the burn wound. Complete wound epithelialization with healthy granulation tissue was achieved within 15 days. No surface wound swab culture became positive during the treatment. The patient did not develop any fever spikes, and the white blood cell count was maintained at less than 12,000 mm-3 with a C-reactive protein level below 50 mg/L. No surgical intervention was needed for further management of the wound. Polyhexanide and betaine combined preparation may be used effectively on the superficial partial-thickness and mid-dermal burns to prevent wound infection and improve granulation and epithelialization. However, high-quality comparative evidence is needed for the confirmation."

      "abstract": "We have reported that D,L-thiol esters, including D-cysteine ethyl ester (D-CYSee), are effective at overcoming opioid-induced respiratory depression (OIRD) in rats. Our on-going studies reveal that co-injections of D-CYSee with multi-day morphine injections markedly diminish spontaneous withdrawal that usually occurs after cessation of multiple injections of morphine in rats. Chronically administered opioids are known (1) to alter cellular redox status, thus inducing an oxidative state, and (2) for an overall decrease in DNA methylation, therefore resulting in the transcriptional activation of previously silenced long interspersed elements (LINE-1) retrotransposon genes. The first objective of the present study was to determine whether D-CYSee and the one carbon metabolism with the methyl donor, betaine, would maintain redox control and normal DNA methylation levels in human neuroblastoma cell cultures (SH-SY5Y) under overnight challenge with morphine (100 nM). The second objective was to determine whether D-CYSee and/or betaine could diminish the degree of physical dependence to morphine in male Sprague Dawley rats. Our data showed that overnight treatment with morphine reduced cellular GSH levels, induced mitochondrial damage, decreased global DNA methylation, and increased LINE-1 mRNA expression. These adverse effects by morphine, which diminished the reducing capacity and compromised the maintenance of the membrane potential of SH-SY5Y cells, was prevented by concurrent application of D-CYSee (100 µM) or betaine (300 µM). Furthermore, our data demonstrated that co-injections of D-CYSee (250 μmol/kg, IV) and to a lesser extent, betaine (250 μmol/kg, IV), markedly diminished the development of physical dependence induced by multi-day morphine injections (escalating daily doses of 10-30 mg/kg, IV), as assessed by the lesser number of withdrawal phenomena elicited by the injection of the opioid receptor antagonist, naloxone (1.5 mg/kg, IV). These findings provide evidence that D-CYSee and betaine prevent the appearance of redox alterations and epigenetic signatures commonly seen in neural cells involved in opioid physical dependence/addiction, and lessen development of physical dependence to morphine."

      "abstract": "Salinity stress represents a major threat to crop production by inhibiting seed germination, growth of seedlings, and final yield and, therefore, to the social and economic prosperity of developing countries. Recently, plant growth-promoting substances have been widely used as a chemical strategy for improving plant resilience towards abiotic stresses. This study aimed to determine whether melatonin (MT) and glycine betaine (GB) alone or in combination could alleviate the salinity-induced impacts on seed germination and growth of maize seedlings. Increasing NaCl concentration from 100 to 200 mM declined seed germination rate (4.6-37.7%), germination potential (24.5-46.7%), radical length (7.7-40.0%), plumule length (2.2-35.6%), seedling fresh (1.7-41.3%) and dry weight (23.0-56.1%) compared to control (CN) plants. However, MT and GB treatments lessened the adverse effects of 100 and 150 mM NaCl and enhanced germination comparable to control plants. In addition, results from the pot experiments show that 200 mM NaCl stress disrupted the osmotic balance and persuaded oxidative stress, presented by higher electrolyte leakage, hydrogen peroxide, superoxide radicals, and malondialdehyde compared to control plants. However, compared to the NaCl treatment, NaCl+MT+GB treatment decreased the accumulation of malondialdehyde (24.2-42.1%), hydrogen peroxide (36.2-44.0%), and superoxide radicals (20.1-50.9%) by up-regulating the activity of superoxide dismutase (28.4-51.2%), catalase (82.2-111.5%), ascorbate peroxidase (40.3-59.2%), and peroxidase (62.2-117.9%), and by enhancing osmolytes accumulation, thereby reducing NaCl-induced oxidative damages. Based on these findings, the application of MT+GB is an efficient chemical strategy for improving seed germination and growth of seedlings by improving the physiological and biochemical attributes of maize under 200 mM NaCl stress.",

      "abstract": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the most common demyelinating disease of the central nervous system, especially the cerebellum, with numerous physical and mental symptoms. Oxidative stress caused by inflammation can play a role in the occurrence of this disease. Betaine, a natural methyl donor compound, has potent neuroprotective effects. Here, we investigated the effects of betaine on motor behavior, cerebellar histological changes, oxidative stress response, and endoplasmic reticulum stress in a cuprizone (CPZ)-induced multiple sclerosis model in male rats. Twenty Wistar adult male rats were randomly divided into four groups including control, MS, betaine-treated MS, and betaine groups. MS was induced by feeding animals with rodent chow containing 0.5% CPZ for 12 weeks. Betaine was daily administrated as 1% in drinking water for the last 6 weeks. The motor behavioral performance was evaluated by open field, rotarod, and reverse basket tests. Histological analysis of the cerebellum was performed by hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and Cresyl violet (Nissl) staining. Oxidative stress factors (GSH, GSSG, GPX, GR, and GT) were assessed in the experimental groups and finally, the expression of ERS-associated proteins was measured using western blot analysis. Data showed that treatment with betaine could effectively prevent and reverse the adverse behavioral manifestation compared with the MS group. Betaine treatment protected cerebellar demyelination and neuron and Purkinje cell degeneration against CPZ-induced demyelination. Betaine attenuated the protein levels of ESR-related proteins in the cerebellum of MS rats and similarly increased the level of enzymes related to antioxidants in the cerebellum. Therefore, our results suggest that oral administration of betaine may be used as a novel adjunct therapy against cerebellar dysfunctions in an animal model of MS.",

      "abstract": "Dengue virus (DENV) infection is a worldwide public health concern infecting approximately 400 million individuals and about 40,000 mortalities yearly. Despite this, no licensed or readily available antiviral medication is currently available specifically for DENV infection, and therapy is typically symptomatic. Therefore, the objective of the study was to investigate the antiviral activity of Beta vulgaris L. phytoconstituents against DENV-2 targeting NS3 protein. The antiviral activity of phytochemicals was examined through virtual ligand-based screening, antiviral inhibition and dosage response assays, western blotting analysis and MD simulations. We conducted toxicological, and pharmacokinetic analysis to assess plant-based natural compound's efficacy, safety, and non-toxic doses. Molecular docking and MD simulation results revealed that the nonstructural protein-3 (NS3) might prove as a funamental target for Betanin and Glycine Betaine against Dengue virus. Betanin and Glycine betaine were initially studied for their non-toxic doses in HeLa, CHO, and Vero cells via MTT assay. HeLa cells were transiently transfected with cloned vector pcDNA3.1/Zeo(+)/DENV-2 NS3 along with non-toxic doses (80 μM-10 μM) of selected phytochemicals. The dose-response assay illustrated downregulated expression of DENV-2 NS3 gene after administration of Betanin (IC50 = 4.35 μM) and Glycine Betaine (IC50 = 4.49 μM). Dose response analysis of Betanin (80 μM-10 μM) depicted the significant inhibition of NS3 protein expression as well. These results suggested downregulated expression of DENV-2 NS3 at mRNA and protein level portraying the DENV replication inhibition. Based on our study findings, NS3 protease is depicted as distinctive DENV-2 inhibitor target. We will channel our study further into in vitro characterization employing the mechanistic study to understand the role of host factors in anti-flavi therapeutic.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Mitochondrial dysfunction is one of the hallmarks of aging and a leading contributor to sarcopenia. Nutrients are essential for improving mitochondrial function and skeletal muscle health during the aging process. Betaine is a nutrient with potential muscle-preserving properties. However, whether and how betaine could regulate the mitochondria function in aging muscle are poorly understood. We aimed to explore the molecular target and underlying mechanism of betaine in attenuating the age-related mitochondrial dysfunction in skeletal muscle. METHODS: Young mice (YOU, 2 months), old mice (OLD, 15 months), and old mice with betaine treatment (BET, 15 months) were fed for 12 weeks. The effects of betaine on muscle mass, strength, function, and subcellular structure of muscle fibres were assessed. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) was conducted to identify the molecular target of betaine. The impacts of betaine on mitochondrial-related molecules, superoxide accumulation, and oxidative respiration were examined using western blotting (WB), immunofluorescence (IF) and seahorse assay. The underlying mechanism of betaine regulation on the molecular target to maintain mitochondrial function was investigated by luciferase reporter assay, chromatin immunoprecipitation and electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Adenoassociated virus transfection, succinate dehydrogenase staining (SDH), and energy expenditure assessment were performed on 20-month-old mice for validating the mechanism in vivo. RESULTS: Betaine intervention demonstrated anti-aging effects on the muscle mass (P = 0.017), strength (P = 0.010), and running distance (P = 0.013). Mitochondrial-related markers (ATP5a, Sdha, and Uqcrc2) were 1.1- to 1.5-fold higher in BET than OLD (all P ≤ 0.036) with less wasted mitochondrial vacuoles accumulating in sarcomere. Bioinformatic analysis from RNA-seq displayed pathways related to mitochondrial respiration activity was higher enriched in BET group (NES = -0.87, FDR = 0.10). The quantitative real time PCR (qRT-PCR) revealed betaine significantly reduced the expression of a novel mitochondrial regulator, Mss51 (-24.9%, P = 0.002). In C2C12 cells, betaine restored the Mss51-mediated suppression in mitochondrial respiration proteins (all P ≤ 0.041), attenuated oxygen consumption impairment, and superoxide accumulation (by 20.7%, P = 0.001). Mechanically, betaine attenuated aging-induced repression in Yy1 mRNA expression (BET vs. OLD: 2.06 vs. 1.02, P = 0.009). Yy1 transcriptionally suppressed Mss51 mRNA expression both in vitro and in vivo. This contributed to the preservation of mitochondrial respiration, improvement for energy expenditure (P = 0.008), and delay of muscle loss during aging process. CONCLUSIONS: Altogether, betaine transcriptionally represses Mss51 via Yy1, improving age-related mitochondrial respiration in skeletal muscle. These findings suggest betaine holds promise as a dietary supplement to delay skeletal muscle degeneration and improve age-related mitochondrial diseases.",

      "abstract": "Oxidative stress is a frequent concern in the breeding of laying hens, and limit the healthy development of poultry. Dexamethasone (DXM) has been demonstrated to induce oxidative stress. Conversely, betaine is an alkaloid with a potent antioxidant activity. The study was designed to investigate the ameliorative effect of betaine on DXM-induced oxidative stress in laying hens. The results revealed that DXM treatment significantly decreased laying rate, shell strength, albumen height, Haugh unit, egg weight, folk weight and albumen weight, alongside increased malondialdehyde (MDA) and decreased total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC) in serum and liver (P < 0.05). In contrast, dietary betaine addition reversed those parameters mentioned above (P < 0.05). Hepatic RNA-seq analysis showed that there existed 110 up- and 88 down-regulated genes in DXM group when compared with the control. Meanwhile there were 117 upregulation and 169 downregulation genes in BT group when compared with DXM group. Besides, we found that dietary betaine addition significantly down-regulated cell adhesion molecules, glycerolipid metabolism and glycolysis gluconeogenesis pathways. In addition, a total of 44 and 94 differential metabolites were identified respectively from Con vs. DXM and DXM vs BT. More importantly, dietary betaine addition significantly increased the levels of pantothenic acid, gamma-Aminobutyric acid, equol and choline, all of which were related to antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. Furthermore, gut microbiota analysis indicated that the Chao and Observed_species indexes were remarkably higher in BT group (P<0.05). Heatmap analysis revealed that Subdoligranulum, Prevotella, Blautia, YRC22, Bacteroides, Ruminococcus and Coprococcus were notably restored in BT group (P<0.05). Taken together, our findings collectively illustrate that dietary betaine addition could attenuate DXM-induced oxidative stress, improve egg quality and gut microbes of laying hens.",

METHODS: C57BL 6J mice were fed a standard diet (SF), a standard diet with betaine (SFB), a nutritionally complete high fat (HF) diet, or a high fat diet with betaine (HFB) for 14 weeks. In a separate experiment, mice were fed high fat diet for 18 weeks, half of whom received betaine for the final 4 weeks. Activation of insulin signaling in the liver was assessed by western blot. Insulin signaling was also assessed in insulin resistant primary human hepatocytes treated with betaine. RESULTS: As compared with SF, mice receiving HF diet were heavier, had more hepatic steatosis, and abnormal glucose tolerance test (GTT). Betaine content in liver and serum was 50% lower in HF than in SF; betaine supplementation restored serum and liver betaine content. Betaine treatment of HF reduced whole body insulin resistance as measured by GTT. Betaine treatment of HF increased tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate-1 and phosphorylation (activation) of Akt, and increased hepatic glycogen content. In vitro, betaine reversed insulin resistance in primary human hepatocytes by increasing insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS1 and of Akt. CONCLUSION: Betaine supplementation reduced whole body insulin resistance and increased activation of insulin signaling pathways in the liver in a mouse model of insulin resistance and fatty liver created by feeding a nutritionally complete high fat diet for 14 weeks. Betaine also reduced liver injury as assessed by ALT and by liver histology. In vitro, betaine reversed insulin resistance by increasing insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS1 and activation of downstream proteins in the insulin signaling cascade in insulin resistant primary human hepatocytes."

The metabolizable energy (ME) intake, HP and respiratory quotient (RQ) were measured over 24 h. No differences (p > 0.05) were found in HP and RE between treatments. For RQ, TN-CON was greater (p < 0.01) than HT treatments, except for HT-BET. All RQs indicated an overall lipogenesis where betaine supplementation showed an intermediate value, indicating that it may have a positive effect on lipogenesis and overall growth. At 30 °C, betaine or zinc had no effect on HP and RE; ME intake was not reduced, indicating a genetic adaptation of Iberian pigs to heat."

With the escalating prevalence of METH abuse, there is a pressing need to explore effective therapeutic interventions. Thus, the objective of this research was to investigate whether betaine can protect against depressive-like behavior and cognitive impairment induced by METH. Following intraperitoneal injections of METH in mice, varying doses of betaine were administered. Subsequently, the behavioral responses of mice and the impact of betaine intervention on METH-induced neural damage, synaptic plasticity, microglial activation, and NLRP3 inflammatory pathway activation were assessed. Administration 30 mg/kg and 100 mg/kg of betaine ameliorated METH-induced depressive-like behaviors in the open field test, tail suspension test, forced swimming test, and sucrose preference test and cognitive impairment in the novel object recognition test and Barnes maze test. Moreover, betaine exerted protective effects against METH-induced neural damage and reversed the reduced synaptic plasticity, including the decline in dendritic spine density, as well as alterations in the expression of hippocampal PSD95 and Synapsin-1. Additionally, betaine treatment suppressed hippocampal microglial activation induced by METH. Likewise, it also inhibited the activation of the hippocampal NLRP3 inflammasome pathway and reduced IL-1β and TNF-α release. These results collectively suggest that betaine's significant role in mitigating depressive-like behavior and cognitive impairment resulting from METH abuse, presenting potential applications in the prevention and treatment of substance addiction.",

      "abstract": "In this study, the effects of different salinity gradients and addition of compatible solutes on anaerobic treated effluent water qualities, sludge characteristics and microbial communities were investigated. The increase in salinity resulted in a decrease in particle size of the granular sludge, which was concentrated in the range of 0.5-1.0 mm. The content of EPS (extracellular polymeric substances) in the granular sludge gradually increased with increasing salinity and the addition of betaine (a typical compatible solute). Meanwhile, the microbial community structure was significantly affected by salinity, with high salinity reducing the diversity of bacteria. At higher salinity, Patescibacteria and Proteobacteria gradually became the dominant phylum, with relative abundance increasing to 13.53% and 12.16% at 20 g/L salinity. Desulfobacterota and its subordinate Desulfovibrio, which secrete EPS in large quantities, dominated significantly after betaine addition.Their relative abundance reached 13.65% and 7.86% at phylum level and genus level. The effect of these changes on the treated effluent was shown as the average chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal rate decreased from 82.10% to 79.71%, 78.01%, 68.51% and 64.55% when the salinity gradually increased from 2 g/L to 6, 10, 16 and 20 g/L. At the salinity of 20 g/L, average COD removal increased to 71.65% by the addition of 2 mmol/L betaine. The gradient elevated salinity and the exogenous addition of betaine played an important role in achieving stability of the anaerobic system in a highly saline environment, which provided a feasible strategy for anaerobic treatment of organic saline wastewater.",

      "abstract": "Arsenic, an environmental pollutant and poisonous metalloid, has adverse effects on different body organs, including the kidneys. Betaine is a natural nutrient that has many beneficial health effects. This research was conducted to examine the impact of betaine on nephrotoxicity caused by inorganic arsenic (NaAsO2) in mice. Mice were separated into following groups: control, NaAsO2 (50 ppm), NaAsO2 (50 ppm) + betaine (500 mg/kg), and betaine (500 mg/kg). Mice were received NaAsO2 via drinking water for 8 consecutive weeks and betaine was given to the animals via gavage once daily in the 7th and 8th weeks of the study. Upon completion of the study, the mice were euthanized and samples of serum and kidney were obtained for further evaluations. Administration of NaAsO2 increased the levels of blood urea nitrogen and creatinine in the serum. It enhanced the amounts of renal malondialdehyde and decreased the total thiol levels, as well as the activity of antioxidant enzymes (catalase, superoxide dismutase, and glutathione peroxidase). Furthermore, it enhanced the levels of renal inflammatory indicators (tumor necrosis factor-alpha and nitric oxide). Western blot results exhibited an increase in the protein expression of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB), and phosphorylated NF-κB in NaAsO2-treated mice. Histopathological results also confirmed kidney damage caused by NaAsO2. However, treatment with betaine improved NaAsO2-related kidney injuries in mice. The results of this work indicated that betaine can attenuate kidney damage caused by NaAsO2 by inhibiting oxidative stress and inflammation.",

      "abstract": "Cardiotoxicity is a well-established adverse effect of several drugs across multiple therapeutic indications. It is particularly prevalent following anticancer therapy. In order to evaluate the changes in cellular metabolism associated with methotrexate cardiotoxicity, we treated Wistar rats with a single high dose of methotrexate (HDMTX), and after five days, the animals were sacrificed. We then analyzed the cardiotoxicity parameters in serum like Cardiac enzymes(CK-MB, Troponin T, ALP), Inflammatory markers (TNF-α and IL-6), oxidative stress markers (NO, NOX-2), histopathology and cardiac tissue with the goal of identifying a metabolic signature of cardiotoxicity using discovery-based metabolomics. The biochemical parameters for cardiac enzymes, oxidative stress and inflammatory markers showed a significant increase in all three categories in rats treated with HDMTX. These findings were mirrored in the histopathological analysis confirming cardiotoxicity due to HDMTX. The results showed a total of 95 metabolites that were found to be significantly (p < 0.05) modulated: either up- or downregulated in the HDMTX-treated group when compared with the control group. Using integrated pathway analysis we found these metabolites were associated with many important cardiac tissue metabolic pathways, such as the malate aspartate shuttle, taurine and hypotaurine metabolism, betaine metabolism, spermidine biosynthesis, and homocysteine degradation. Among them, L-arginine, homocysteine, and betaine were significantly upregulated, suggesting their possible association with cardiac tissue injury. Overall, we provided evidence for using untargeted metabolomics to identify novel metabolites associated with HDMTX cardiac toxicity.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Due to the close correlation between choline, L-carnitine, betaine and their intestinal microbial metabolites, including trimethylamine (TMA) and trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), and creatinine, there has been an increasing interest in the study of these compounds in vivo. METHODS: In this study, a rapid stable isotope dilution (SID)-UHPLC-MS/MS method was developed for the simultaneous determination of choline, L-carnitine, betaine, TMA, TMAO and creatinine in plasma, liver and feces of rats. The method was validated using quality control (QC) samples spiked at low, medium and high levels. Second, we applied the method to quantify the effects of Rosa Roxburghii Tratt juice (RRTJ) on plasma, liver, and fecal levels of choline, L-carnitine, betaine, TMA, TMAO, and creatinine in high-fat diet-induced hyperlipidemic rats, demonstrating the utility of the method. RESULTS: The limits of detection (LOD) were 0.04-0.027 µM and the limits of quantification (LOQ) were 0.009-0.094 µM. The linear ranges for each metabolite in plasma were choline1.50-96 µM; L-carnitine: 2-128 µM; betaine: 3-192 µM; TMA: 0.01-40.96 µM; TMAO: 0.06-61.44 µM and creatinine: 1-64 µM (R2 ≥ 0.9954). The linear ranges for each metabolite in liver were Choline: 12-768 µM; L-carnitine: 1.5-96 µM; betaine: 10-640 µM; TMA: 0.5-32 µM; TMAO: 0.02-81.92 µM and creatinine: 0.2-204.8 µM (R2 ≥ 0.9938). The linear ranges for each metabolite in feces were choline: 1.5-96 µM; L-carnitine: 0.01-40.96 µM; Betaine: 1.5-96 µM; TMA: 1-64 µM; TMAO: 0.02-81.92 µM and Creatinine: 0.02-81.92 µM (R2 ≥ 0.998). The intra-day and inter-day coefficients of variation were < 8 % for all analytes. The samples were stabilized after multiple freeze-thaw cycles (3 freeze-thaw cycles), 24 h at room temperature, 24 h at 4 °C and 20 days at -80 °C. The samples were stable. The average recovery was 89 %-99 %. This method was used to quantify TMAO and its related metabolites and creatinine levels in hyperlipidemic rats. The results showed that high-fat diet led to the disorder of TMAO and its related metabolites and creatinine in rats, which was effectively improved after the intervention of Rosa Roxburghii Tratt juice（RRTJ）. CONCLUSIONS: A method for the determination of choline, L-carnitine, betaine, TMA, TMAO and creatinine in plasma, liver and feces samples was established, which is simple, time-saving, high precision, accuracy and recovery.",

This study investigates the role of MIF in liver fibrosis and the modulating effect of betaine on MIF in thioacetamide (TAA)-induced liver fibrosis. The wild-type and knockout MIF-/- C57BL/6 mice were divided into the following groups: control; Bet group, which received betaine; MIF-/-; MIF-/-+Bet; TAA group, which received TAA; TAA+Bet; MIF-/-+TAA; and MIF-/-+TAA+Bet group. After eight weeks of treatment, liver tissue was collected for further analysis. The results revealed that TAA-treated MIF-deficient mice had elevated levels of hepatic TGF-β1 and PDGF-BB, as well as MMP-2, MMP-9, and TIMP-1 compared to TAA-treated wild-type mice. However, the administration of betaine to TAA-treated MIF-deficient mice reduced hepatic TGF-β1 and PDGF-BB levels and also the relative activities of MMP-2, MMP-9 and TIMP-1, albeit less effectively than in TAA-treated mice without MIF deficiency. Furthermore, the antifibrogenic effect of MIF was demonstrated by an increase in MMP2/TIMP1 and MMP9/TIMP1 ratios. The changes in the hepatic levels of fibrogenic factors were confirmed by a histological examination of liver tissue. Overall, the dual nature of MIF highlights its involvement in the progression of liver fibrosis. Its prooxidant and proinflammatory effects may exacerbate tissue damage and inflammation initially, but its antifibrogenic activity suggests a potential protective role against fibrosis development. The study showed that betaine modulates the antifibrogenic effects of MIF in TAA-induced liver fibrosis, by decreasing TGF-β1, PDGF-BB, MMP-2, MMP-9, TIMP-1, and the deposition of ECM (Coll1 and Coll3) in the liver."

      "abstract": "Drought stress is a serious challenge for global food production. Nanofertilizers and nanocomposites cope with such environmental stresses and also increase nutritional contents of fruits. An in vitro experiment was designed to use Zinc Oxide Nanoparticles (ZnO NPs) primed with Proline and Betaine (ZnOP and ZnOBt NPs) at 50 and 100 mg/kg soil against drought stress in Tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) plants. Plant morphological, biochemical, and fruit nutritional quality were accessed. Maximum plant height was observed under the treatment of ZnOP50 (1.09 m) and ZnO 100 (1.06 m). ZnOP and ZnOBt also improved the chlorophyll content up to 86% and 87.16%, respectively. Application of ZnOP NPs also demonstrated maximum tomato yield (204 g tomato/plant) followed by ZnO NPs and ZnOBt NPs. Nanocomposites decreased phenolics and flavonoids contents in drought stressed plants demonstrating the mitigation of oxidative stress. Nanofertilizer also increased the concentration of phenolics and flavonoids in fruits that increased the nutritional contents. Furthermore a significant accumulation of betaine, proline, and lycopene in fruits on nanocomposite treatment made it nutritional and healthy. Lycopene content increased up to 2.01% and 1.23% in presence of ZnOP50 and ZnOP100, respectively. These outcomes validate that drought stress in plant can be reduced by accumulation of different phytochemicals and quenching oxidative stress. The study deems that nano zinc carrying osmoregulators can greatly reduce the negative effects of drought stress and increase nutritional quality of tomato fruits.",

Two hundred Ross 308 broilers at 28 days of age were randomly assigned to five groups. The control group, housed at 24 ± 1℃, was fed a basal diet. High-temperature treatment groups, housed at 32 ± 1℃, received a basal diet with 0 (HS group), 250 mg/kg VC (HSVC group), 1000 mg/kg Bet (HSBe group), and 250 mg/kg VC + 1000 mg/kg Bet (HSVCBe group). On day 42, assessments were made on growth performance, muscle quality, serum biochemistry, and antioxidant function. Results revealed that HS significantly lowered (P < 0.05) average daily feed intake (ADFI), the degree of redness (a*) in muscles, and serum total superoxide dismutase (T-SOD) level. It also reduced (P < 0.01) average daily gain (ADG), and serum total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC) level, while increasing (P < 0.05) shear force, serum direct bilirubin (D-BIL), uric acid (UA), and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels compared with the control group. Dietary supplementation of VC and Bet, either alone or in combination, significantly decreased shear force and serum UA level, while increasing ADG and serum T-AOC, T-SOD level compared with the HS group (P < 0.05). In conclusion, the addition of VC and/or Bet to the diet proves effective in enhancing the growth performance of HS-exposed broilers through the positive regulation of serum chemical metabolism and the alleviation of oxidative damage.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Oligoasthenozoospermia is the most common type of semen abnormality in male infertile patients. Betaine (BET) has been proved to have pharmacological effects on improving semen quality. BET also belongs to endogenous physiological active substances in the testis. However, the physiological function of BET in rat testis and its pharmacological mechanism against oligoasthenozoospermia remain unclear. PURPOSE: This research aims to prove the therapeutic effect and potential mechanism of BET on oligoasthenozoospermia rat model induced by Tripterygium wilfordii glycosides (TWGs). METHODS: The oligoasthenozoospermia rat model was established by a continuous gavage of TWGs (60 mg/kg) for 28 days. Negative control group, oligoasthenozoospermia group, positive drug group (levocarnitine, 300 mg/kg), and 200 mg/kg, 400 mg/kg, and 800 mg/kg BET groups were created for exploring the therapeutic effect of BET on the oligoasthenozoospermia rat model. The therapeutic effect was evaluated by HE and TUNEL staining. Immunofluorescence assay of DNMT3A, PIWIL1, PRMT5, SETDB1, BHMT2, and METTL3, methylation capture sequencing, Pi-RNA sequencing, and molecular docking were used to elucidate potential pharmacological mechanisms. RESULTS: It is proved that BET can significantly restore testicular pathological damage induced by TWGs, which also can significantly reverse the apoptosis of spermatogenic cells. The spermatogenic cell protein expression levels of DNMT3A, PIWIL1, PRMT5, SETDB1, BHMT2, and METTL3 significantly decreased in oligoasthenozoospermia group. 400 mg/kg and 800 mg/kg BET groups can significantly increase expression level of the above-mentioned proteins. Methylation capture sequencing showed that BET can significantly increase the 5mC methylation level of Spata, Spag, and Specc spermatogenesis-related genes. Pi-RNA sequencing proved that the above-mentioned genes produce a large number of Pi-RNA under BET intervention. Pi-RNA can form complexes with PIWI proteins to participate in DNA methylation of target genes. Molecular docking indicated that BET may not directly act as substrate for methyltransferase and instead participates in DNA methylation by promoting the methionine cycle and increasing S-adenosylmethionine synthesis. CONCLUSION: BET has a significant therapeutic effect on oligoasthenozoospermia rat model induced by TWPs. The mechanism mainly involves that BET can increase the methylation level of Spata, Specc, and Spag target genes through the PIWI/Pi-RNA pathway and up-regulation of methyltransferases (including DNA methyltransferases and histone methyltransferases).",

NaF mechanisms of toxicity include perturbation of intracellular redox homeostasis and apoptosis. Betaine (BET) is a modified amino acid with anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and anti-apoptotic properties. This study investigates BET's effect on NaF-induced hepatorenal toxicities in rats. Experimental rats (n = 30) were randomly assigned to groups (n = 6) and treated by gavage for 28 days. Group I (2 mL of distilled water), Group II (NaF: 9 mg/kg) alone, Group III: (BET: 100 mg/kg), Group IV: (NaF: 9 mg/kg and BET 1: 50 mg/kg), and Group V: (NaF: 9 mg/kg and BET 2: 100 mg/kg). Our findings revealed significantly (p < 0.05) increased hepatic transaminase activities alongside creatinine and urea levels following NaF-alone treatment in addition to increased oxidative status, lipid peroxidation, reactive oxygen and nitrogen species, decreased superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione-s-transferase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione, and total sulfhydryl groups. The reduced levels of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor-2 and the activities of heme oxygenase-1, thioredoxin, and thioredoxin reductase in NaF-alone treated rats equally compromised cellular molecular responses to oxidative stress. Also, NaF increased (p < 0.05) hepatorenal inflammatory biomarkers-nitric oxide, interleukin-10, myeloperoxidase, and xanthine oxidase. Furthermore, caspase-3 and caspase-9 were increased (p < 0.05) in rats treated with NaF alone. Contrastingly, BET was observed to alleviate the harmful effects of NaF. Treatment with BET mitigated NaF-induced oxido-inflammatory responses and apoptosis in the experimental rat's hepatorenal system. The study demonstrates the potential of BET to abate NaF-induced hepatorenal toxicity.",

However, the latter two proteases caused degradation of chitin molecules. Further investigation revealed that subtilisin A in Bet/G did not exhibit \"pH memory\", which is a universal characteristic displayed by enzymes dispersed in organic phases, and the catalytic characteristics of subtilisin A in Bet/G differed significantly from those in aqueous phase. The conditions for protein removal from chitin by subtilisin A in Bet/G were determined: Chitin dissolved in Bet/G with 0.5 % subtilisin A (442.0 U/mg, based on the mass of chitin) was hydrolyzed at 45 °C for 30 min. The residual protein content in chitin decreased from 5.75 % ± 0.10 % to 1.01 % ± 0.12 %, improving protein removal by 57.20 % compared with protein removal obtained by Bet/G alone.

      "abstract": "Betaine-homocysteine methyltransferase (BHMT) regulates protein methylation and is correlated with tumorigenesis; however, the effects and regulation of BHMT in hepatocarcinogenesis remain largely unexplored. Here, we determined the clinical significance of BHMT in the occurrence and progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) using tissue samples from 198 patients. BHMT was to be frequently found (86.6%) expressed at relatively low levels in HCC tissues and was positively correlated with the overall survival of patients with HCC. Bhmt overexpression effectively suppressed several malignant phenotypes in hepatoma cells in vitro and in vivo, whereas complete knockout of Bhmt (Bhmt-/-) produced the opposite effect. We combined proteomics, metabolomics, and molecular biological strategies and detected that Bhmt-/- promoted hepatocarcinogenesis and tumor progression by enhancing the activity of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) and PPP metabolism in DEN-induced HCC mouse and subcutaneous tumor-bearing models. In contrast, restoration of Bhmt with an AAV8-Bhmt injection or pharmacological inhibition of G6PD attenuated hepatocarcinogenesis. Additionally, coimmunoprecipitation identified monomethylated modifications of the G6PD, and BHMT regulated the methylation of G6PD. Protein sequence analysis, generation and application of specific antibodies, and site-directed mutagenesis indicated G6PD methylation at the arginine residue 246. Furthermore, we established bidirectionally regulated BHMT cellular models combined with methylation-deficient G6PD mutants to demonstrate that BHMT potentiated arginine methylation of G6PD, thereby inhibiting G6PD activity, which in turn suppressed hepatocarcinogenesis. Taken together, this study reveals a new methylation-regulatory mechanism in hepatocarcinogenesis owing to BHMT deficiency, suggesting a potential therapeutic strategy for HCC treatment.",

      "abstract": "Doxorubicin (DOX) is a broad-spectrum antibiotic with potent anti-cancer activity. Nevertheless, despite having effective anti-neoplasm activity, its use has been clinically restricted due to its life-threatening side effects, such as cardiotoxicity. It is evident that betaine has anti-oxidant, and anti-inflammatory activity and has several beneficial effects, such as decreasing the amyloid-β generation, reducing obesity, improving steatosis and fibrosis, and activating AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). However, whether betaine could mitigate DOX-induced cardiomyopathy is still unexplored. Cardiomyopathy was induced in male Sprague Dawley rats using DOX (4 mg/kg dose with a cumulative dose of 20 mg/kg, i.p.). Further, betaine (200 and 400 mg/kg) was co-treated with DOX through oral gavage for 28 days. After the completion of the study, several biochemical, oxidative stress parameters, histopathology, western blotting, and qRT-PCR were performed. Betaine treatment significantly reduced CK-MB, LDH, SGOT, and triglyceride levels, which are associated with cardiotoxicity. DOX-induced increased oxidative stress was also mitigated by betaine intervention as the SOD, catalase, MDA, and nitrite levels were restored. The histopathological investigation also confirmed the cardioprotective effect of betaine against DOX-induced cardiomyopathy as the tissue injury was reversed. Further, molecular analysis revealed that betaine suppressed the DOX-induced increased expression of phospho-p53, phospho-p38 MAPK, NF-kB p65, and PINK 1 with an upregulation of AMPK and downregulation of Nrf2 expression. Interestingly, qRT-PCR experiments show that betaine treatment alleviates the DOX-induced increase in inflammatory (TNF-α, NLRP3, and IL-6) and fibrosis (TGF-β and Acta2) related gene expression, halting the cardiac injury. Interestingly, betaine also improves the mRNA expression of Nrf2, thus modulating the expression of antioxidant proteins and preventing oxidative damage. Here, we provide the first evidence that betaine treatment prevents DOX-induced cardiomyopathy by inhibiting oxidative stress, inflammation, and fibrosis by regulating AMPK/Nrf2/TGF-β expression. We believe that betaine can be utilized as a potential novel therapeutic strategy for preventing DOX-induced cardiotoxicity.",

Understanding the mechanisms and utilization of exogenous substances underlying plant tolerance to cold stress would lay the foundation for improving temperature resilience in this important crop. Our study is aiming to investigate the effect of exogenous glycine betaine (GB) on tomato seedlings to increase tolerance to low temperatures. By treating tomato seedlings with exogenous GB under low temperature stress, we found that 30 mmol/L exogenous GB can significantly improve the cold tolerance of tomato seedlings. Exogenous GB can influence the enzyme activity of antioxidant defense system and ROS levels in tomato leaves. The seedlings with GB treatment presented higher Fv/Fm value and photochemical activity under cold stress compared with the control. Moreover, analysis of high-throughput plant phenotyping of tomato seedlings also supported that exogenous GB can protect the photosynthetic system of tomato seedlings under cold stress. In addition, we proved that exogenous GB significantly increased the content of endogenous abscisic acid (ABA) and decreased endogenous gibberellin (GA) levels, which protected tomatoes from low temperatures. Meanwhile, transcriptional analysis showed that GB regulated the expression of genes involved in antioxidant capacity, calcium signaling, photosynthesis activity, energy metabolism-related and low temperature pathway-related genes in tomato plants. In conclusion, our findings indicated that exogenous GB, as a cryoprotectant, can enhance plant tolerance to low temperature by improving the antioxidant system, photosynthetic system, hormone signaling, and cold response pathway and so on."

      "abstract": "High salinity inhibits microbial activity in the bioremediation of saline wastewater. To alleviate osmotic stress, glycine betaine (GB), an osmoprotectant, is added to enhance the secretion of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS). These EPS are pivotal in withstanding environmental stressors, yet the intricate interplay between GB supplementation and microbial responses through EPS modifications-encompassing composition, molecular architecture, and electrochemical features-remains elusive in hypersaline conditions. Here we show microbial strategies for salinity endurance by investigating the impact of GB on the dynamic alterations of EPS properties. Our findings reveal that GB supplementation at 3.5% salinity elevates the total EPS (T-EPS) content from 12.50 ± 0.05 to 24.58 ± 0.96 mg per g dry cell weight. The observed shift in zeta potential from -28.95 to -6.25 mV at 0% and 3.5% salinity, respectively, with GB treatment, indicates a reduction in electrostatic repulsion and compaction. Notably, the EPS protein secondary structure transition from β-sheet to α-helix, with GB addition, signifies a more compact protein configuration, less susceptible to salinity fluctuations. Electrochemical analyses, including cyclic voltammetry (CV) and differential pulse voltammetry (DPV), reveal GB's role in promoting the release of exogenous electron shuttles, such as flavins and c-type cytochromes (c-Cyts). The enhancement in DPV peak areas (QDPV) with GB addition implies an increase in available extracellular electron transfer sites. This investigation advances our comprehension of microbial adaptation mechanisms to salinity through EPS modifications facilitated by GB in saline habitats."

We investigated whether an additive-enriched feed can reduce negative effects in pigs during summer conditions. Sixty growing-finishing pigs were allocated into two groups: the control (CF) and summer feed (SF) group. The CF group contained 0.4 mg/kg inorganic selenium and 100 ppm vitamin E, while the SF group contained 0.3 mg/kg inorganic selenium, 0.1 mg/kg selenomethionine, 200 ppm vitamins E and C, and 0.2% betaine. Feed was offered ad libitum. Respiration rate, rectal and skin temperature, behaviour, and weight gain were assessed weekly. Daily measurements of these parameters were performed during a 3-day heat wave (temperature humidity index (THI) ≥ 75) and during an artificial heating period. Individual average daily water intake (ADWI) and feed intake were measured using RFID systems. The ADWI of the SF group did not change during heat load while it increased for the CF group. Independent of dietary treatment, increases in ∆THI or the THI were accompanied by significant increases in both respiration rate and skin temperature. In conclusion, the SF may induce a reduced need to increase ADWI during hot periods. In addition, mainly skin temperatures and especially respiration rates revealed the sensitivity of pigs to heat stress."

Testicular and ovarian cells were subjected to four different conditions, including normal glucose and hyperglycemia, with or without betaine (5 mM). The cells with hyperglycemia saw an increase in malondialdehyde (MDA), methylglyoxal (MGO), expression of a receptor for AGE, and aging-related genes (β-GAL), and a decrease in the activity of antioxidant enzymes including catalase, glutathione peroxidase, and superoxide dismutase. The treatment with betaine, in contrast, decreased the amount of MGO and MDA, and also downregulated aging-related signaling.

A total of 100 weaned Qixing meat rabbits aged 35 d with body weight of 748.61 ± 38.59 g were randomly divided into 5 treatment groups: control group (basal diet) and Bet groups (basal diet + 0.75, 1.0, 1.5 or 2.0 g/kg Bet). The average daily temperature in the rabbitry during the experiment was 30.48 °C and the relative humidity was 69.44%. RESULTS: Dietary addition of Bet had no significant effect on growth performance and health status of growing rabbits (P > 0.05), but it increased ileal secretory immunoglobulin A content compared to the control under summer heat (P < 0.05). Addition of 0.75 g/kg Bet up-regulated jejunal IL-4, down-regulated ileal TNF-α expression (P < 0.05). The addition of 1.0 g/kg Bet increased the villi height (VH) in the jejunum (P < 0.05). Serum glucose levels were reduced, and the expression of SLC6A20 was up-regulated in jejunum and ileum of rabbits fed with 1.5 g/kg Bet (P < 0.05). When added at 2.0 g/kg, Bet reduced serum HSP70 content, increased jejunal VH, and up-regulated duodenal SLC7A6, SLC38A2, mTOR and 4EBP-2 expression (P < 0.05). Correlation analysis revealed that intestinal mTOR expression was significantly and positively correlated with SLC7A6, SLC38A2, SLC36A1 and IL-4 expression (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Dietary addition of Bet can up-regulate the expression of anti-inflammatory factors through the AAT/mTOR pathway, improve the intestinal immune function, alleviate intestinal damage in growing rabbits caused by summer heat, and improve intestinal health."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Glycyrrhiza uralensis Fisch., a valuable medicinal plant, shows contrasting salt tolerance between seedlings and perennial individuals, and salt tolerance at seedling stage is very weak. Understanding this difference is crucial for optimizing cultivation practices and maximizing the plant's economic potential. Salt stress resistance at the seedling stage is the key to the cultivation of the plant using salinized land. This study investigated the physiological mechanism of the application of glycine betaine (0, 10, 20, 40, 80 mM) to seedling stages of G. uralensis under salt stress (160 mM NaCl). RESULTS: G. uralensis seedlings' growth was severely inhibited under NaCl stress conditions, but the addition of GB effectively mitigated its effects, with 20 mM GB had showing most significant alleviating effect. The application of 20 mM GB under NaCl stress conditions significantly increased total root length (80.38%), total root surface area (93.28%), and total root volume (175.61%), and significantly increased the GB content in its roots, stems, and leaves by 36.88%, 107.05%, and 21.63%, respectively. The activity of betaine aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (BADH2) was increased by 74.10%, 249.38%, and 150.60%, respectively. The 20 mM GB-addition treatment significantly increased content of osmoregulatory substances (the contents of soluble protein, soluble sugar and proline increased by 7.05%, 70.52% and 661.06% in roots, and also increased by 30.74%, 47.11% and 26.88% in leaves, respectively.). Furthermore, it markedly enhanced the activity of antioxidant enzymes and the content of antioxidants (SOD, CAT, POD, APX and activities and ASA contents were elevated by 59.55%, 413.07%, 225.91%, 300.00% and 73.33% in the root, and increased by 877.51%, 359.89%, 199.15%, 144.35%, and 108.11% in leaves, respectively.), and obviously promoted salt secretion capacity of the leaves, which especially promoted the secretion of Na+ (1.37 times). CONCLUSIONS: In summary, the exogenous addition of GB significantly enhances the salt tolerance of G. uralensis seedlings, promoting osmoregulatory substances, antioxidant enzyme activities, excess salt discharge especially the significant promotion of the secretion of Na+Future studies should aim to elucidate the molecular mechanisms that operate when GB regulates saline stress tolerance.",

Betaine, found in food or supplements, has been found to lower blood glucose concentrations, but its exact mechanism of action is not well understood. OBJECTIVES: A comprehensive evaluation of the potential mechanisms by which betaine supplementation improves glucose metabolism. METHODS: Hyperglycemic mice were fed betaine to measure the indexes of glucose metabolism in the liver and muscle. To explore the mechanism behind the regulation of betaine on glucose metabolism, Ribonucleic Acid-Seq was used to analyze the livers of the mice. In vitro, HepG2 and C2C12 cells were treated with betaine to more comprehensively evaluate the effect of betaine on glucose metabolism. RESULTS: Betaine was added to the drinking water of high-fat diet-induced mice, and it was found to reduce blood glucose concentrations and liver triglyceride concentrations without affecting body weight, confirming its hypoglycemic effect. To investigate the specific mechanism underlying its hypoglycemic effect, protein-protein interaction enrichment analysis of the liver revealed key nodes associated with glucose metabolism, including cytochrome P450 family activity, insulin sensitivity, glucose homeostasis, and triglyceride concentrations. The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes and gene ontogeny enrichment analyses showed significant enrichment of the Notch signaling pathway. These results provided bioinformatic evidence for specific pathways through which betaine regulates glucose metabolism. Key enzyme activities involved in glucose uptake, glycogen synthesis, and glycogenolysis pathways of the liver and muscle were measured, and improvements were observed in these pathways. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides new insight into the mechanisms by which betaine improves glucose metabolism in the liver and muscle and supports its potential as a drug for the treatment of metabolic disorders related to glucose.",

All treatment foods were fed for ninety days. Untargeted blood metabolomic analysis and immune response were measured at the beginning and end of the 90-day feeding trial. Feeding betaine increased single-carbon metabolites while decreasing many carnitine-containing metabolites. Feeding L-carnitine increased many carnitine metabolites, while the combination synergistically influenced the metabolome. The combination of betaine and L-carnitine increased the cytokines released in a Tru-culture system in response to stimulation while numerically decreasing their release when unstimulated. Therefore, the combination of dietary betaine and L-carnitine could have the dual positive effects of reducing cytokine stimulation, controlling inflammation during health, and providing a robust response to bacterial infection."

      "abstract": "An experiment was conducted to determine the effects of betaine on growth performance and intestinal health in rabbits fed diets with different levels of digestible energy. During a 36-d experiment, a total of 144 healthy 35-d-old weaned New Zealand white rabbits with a similar initial body weight (771.05 ± 41.79 g) were randomly distributed to a 2 × 3 factorial arrangement. Experimental treatments consisted of two levels of digestible energy (normal: 10.20 and low: 9.60 MJ/kg) and three levels of betaine (0, 500, and 1,000 mg/kg). Results indicated that rabbits fed the diet with low digestible energy (LDE) had reduced body gain/feed intake on days 1 to 14 and 1 to 36 (P < 0.05), increased the apparent total tract digestibility (ATTD) of neutral detergent fiber, acid detergent fiber (ADF), and n-free extract, and decreased the ATTD of gross energy (GE), crude fiber, and organic matter (OM; P < 0.05). The LDE diet upregulated the gene abundance levels of duodenum junctional adhesion molecule-3 (JAM-3) and downregulated the ileum toll-like receptor 4, myeloid differentiation factor 88, and interleukin-6 (IL-6; P < 0.05). Activities of amylase, lipase, trypsin, and the immunoglobulin M content in the jejunum were decreased in the LDE treatment group (P < 0.05). Dietary betaine supplementation increased the ATTD of GE, dry matter (DM), ADF, and n-free extract by LDE (P < 0.05). The villus height, crypt depth, and goblet cell numbers were decreased, and the villus-crypt ratio was increased in the duodenum (P < 0.05). The gene abundance levels of duodenum IL-2 were downregulated, and the duodenum JAM-2 and JAM-3 were upregulated (P < 0.05). Furthermore, the addition of betaine to the LDE diet increased the ATTD of GE, DM, and OM in rabbits (P < 0.05). Gene abundance levels of ileum IL-6 and duodenum JAM-3 were upregulated (P < 0.05). In summary, LDE diets can reduce the activity of intestinal digestive enzymes and decrease the ATTD of nutrients. However, the addition of betaine to LDE diets improved the intestinal barrier structure and nutrient ATTD in rabbits, with better results when betaine was added at an additive level of 500 mg/kg.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Spontaneous hypertension is a leading risk factor for cardiovascular diseases morbidity and mortality. Glycine betaine (GB) is a natural vitamin that has the potential to lower blood pressure. This work attempted to investigate the role and mechanisms of GB in spontaneous hypertension. METHODS: Spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) were administrated with 100, 200, or 400 mg/kg of GB by gavage or combined with by injection of lentivirus-mediated STIM1 overexpression vector. The heart rate (HR), systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and heart weight/body weight (HW/BW) of rats were monitored. The pathological changes in myocardium were examined by hematoxylin and eosin staining and Masson staining. The expression of genes and proteins was detected by quantitative real-time PCR, western blotting, and immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: GB at 200 and 400 mg/kg reduced the HR, SBP, DBP and HW/BW in SHRs. GB decreased the cross-sectional area and fibrotic area in the myocardium and downregulated the expression of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and β-myosin heavy chain (β-MHC) in the myocardium of SHRs. It indicated that GB treatment effectively alleviated myocardial hypertrophy in SHRs. Additionally, GB treatment repressed the expression of stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1) and calcium release-activated calcium channel protein 1 (Orai1) in the myocardium of SHRs. STIM1 overexpression reversed GB treatment-mediated inhibition of myocardial hypertrophy in SHRs. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, GB repressed STIM1/Orai1 signaling pathway, which contributed to alleviating myocardial hypertrophy in SHRs. Thus, our study provides a theoretical basis for GB as an antihypertensive drug."

      "abstract": "Dementia, with homocysteine (Hcy) as an important risk factor, is a severe public health problem in the aging society. Betaine serves as a methyl donor and plays an important role in reducing Hcy. However, the effects and mechanisms of betaine on Hcy-induced cognitive impairment remain unclear. Firstly, SD rats were injected with Hcy (400 μg/kg) through vena caudalis, and betaine (2.5 % w/v) was supplemented via drinking water for 14 days. Betaine supplementation could attenuate Hcy-induced cognitive impairment in the Y maze and novel object recognition tests by repairing brain injury. Meanwhile, microglial activation was observed to be inhibited by betaine supplementation using immunofluorescence and sholl analysis. Secondly, HMC3 cells were treated with betaine, which was found to decrease the ROS level, ameliorate cell membrane rupture, reduce the release of LDH, IL-18 and IL-1β, and attenuate the damage of microglia to neurons. Mechanistically, betaine alleviates cognitive impairment by inhibiting microglial pyroptosis via reducing the expressions of NLRP3, ASC, pro-caspase-1, cleaved-caspase-1, GSDMD, GSDMD-N, IL-18 and IL-1β. Betaine treatment can increase SAM/SAH ratio, confirming its enhancement on methylation capacity. Furthermore, betaine treatment was found to enhance N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification of NLRP3 mRNA, and reduced the NLRP3 mRNA stability through increasing the expression of the m6A reader YTH N6-methyladenosine RNA binding protein 2 (YTHDF2). Finally, silencing YTHDF2 could reverse the inhibitory effect of betaine on pyroptosis. Our data demonstrated that betaine attenuated Hcy-induced cognitive impairment by suppressing microglia pyroptosis via inhibiting the NLRP3/caspase-1/GSDMD pathway in an m6A-YTHDF2-dependent manner.",

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: Investigate the association between choline and betaine intake and all-cause mortality in a large Swedish cohort. METHODS: Women (52,246) and men (50,485) attending the Västerbotten Intervention Programme 1990-2016 were included. Cox proportional hazard regression models adjusted for energy intake, age, BMI, smoking, education, and physical activity were used to estimate mortality risk according to betaine, total choline, phosphatidylcholine, glycerophosphocholine, phosphocholine, sphingomyelin, and free choline intakes [continuous (per 50 mg increase) and in quintiles]. RESULTS: During a median follow-up of 16 years, 3088 and 4214 deaths were registered in women and men, respectively. Total choline intake was not associated with all-cause mortality in women (HR 1.01; 95% CI 0.97, 1.06; P = 0.61) or men (HR 1.01; 95% CI 0.98, 1.04; P = 0.54). Betaine intake was associated with decreased risk of all-cause mortality in women (HR 0.95; 95% CI 0.91, 0.98; P < 0.01) but not in men. Intake of free choline was negatively associated with risk of all-cause mortality in women (HR 0.98; 95% CI 0.96, 1.00; P = 0.01). No other associations were found between intake of the different choline compounds and all-cause mortality. In women aged ≥ 55 years, phosphatidylcholine intake was positively associated with all-cause mortality. In men with higher folate intake, total choline intake was positively associated with all-cause mortality. CONCLUSION: Overall, our results do not support that intake of total choline is associated with all-cause mortality. However, some associations were modified by age and with higher folate intake dependent on sex. Higher intake of betaine was associated with lower risk of all-cause mortality in women.",

      "abstract": "The toxicity of lead (Pb) in agricultural soil is constantly increasing as a result of anthropogenic activities. Pb is one of the most phytotoxic metals in soil that accumulates in plant tissue, resulting in yield loss. It is currently becoming more popular to supplement glycine betaine (GB) for Pb-induced stress tolerance in crop plants. Currently, no report describes the use of GB as a stress mitigator for growth attributes and stress-specific biomarkers in barley plants under Pb stress conditions. Hence, the present research was designed to examine the stress-mitigating behavior of GB on various growth attributes including germination percentage, seed vigor index (SVI), radicle length, plant biomass (fresh and dry), shoot and root length, physiological attributes such as relative water content (RWC), and stress-specific biomarkers like electrolyte leakage (EL), and H2O2 content of two barley varieties viz. BH959 and BH946 at three Pb stress treatments (15 mM, 25 mM, and 35 mM), with and without GB (2 mM) supplementation in natural conditions. The present investigation showed that at the highest Pb stress (35 mM), the germination rate was reduced to zero, and the growth attributes and RWC of both barley varieties were also reduced as compared to the non-stressed plants (control) with an increase in Pb treatment. However, EL up to 70% and H2O2 content up to 30% increased with an increase in Pb stress concentration indicated by ROS accumulation, resulting in more oxidative stress. Additionally, GB application alleviated the toxic effect of Pb stress by improving the rate of germination by 33.3% and growth performance by reducing the ROS accumulation in terms of reducing stress biomarkers H2O2 by 25%, and EL by 12%. It has been revealed that the application of GB can minimize or reduce the toxic effects caused by Pb toxicity in both varieties, positively modulating plant growth performances and lowering oxidative stress. This research may provide a scientific basis for assessing Pb tolerance in barley plants and developing alternative approaches to protecting them from the severe effects of Pb toxicity.",

A previous study demonstrated that betaine, a commonly used nutrient supplement, has an anti-nociceptive effect, but whether betaine can alleviate chronic pain-induced depressive emotion is elusive. Our current study found that betaine administration significantly eliminated complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA)-induced pain-related depressive-like behaviour. Mechanistically, betaine treatment inhibited microglia and astrocyte activation. Furthermore, betaine significantly promoted the transition of microglia from the M1 to the M2 phenotype, as well as the transition of astrocytes from the A1 to the A2 phenotype. Additionally, the release of pro-inflammatory factors such as IL-18, IL-1β and IL-6 and anti-inflammatory factors such as IL-10 in the hippocampus induced by CFA were also reversed by betaine administration. Overall, betaine has therapeutic effects on pain-related depressive-like phenotypes caused by CFA, possibly through altering the polarization of microglia and astrocytes to reduce neuroinflammation.",

      "abstract": "Water treatment for most public pools involves disinfection with active chlorine leading to the formation of disinfection by-products (DBPs). Among them, nitrogen-containing compounds (N-DBPs) having increased toxicity and adverse effects on human health are of the greatest concern. Being the major component of various body washers for swimmers, cocamidopropyl betaine (CAPB) represents a potential and still underestimated anthropogenic precursor of N-DBPs in pool water. The purpose of this study was to investigate CAPB transformation pathways and mechanisms under the aqueous chlorination conditions. High-performance liquid and two-dimensional gas chromatography hyphenated with high-resolution mass spectrometry were used for the search and tentative identification of the primary and final CAPB transformation products. A wide range of DBPs containing up to five chlorine atoms including these in combination with hydroxyl and additional carbonyl groups has been revealed in model chlorination experiments for the first time. The proposed mechanism of their formation involves nucleophilic substitution of the secondary amide hydrogen atom at the first stage with subsequent free radical and electrophilic addition reactions resulting in non-selective introduction of halogen atoms and hydroxyl groups in the alkyl chain. The deep transformation products include short-chain chlorinated hydrocarbons and their oxidation products as well as dimethylcarbamoyl chloride possessing high toxicity and carcinogenic properties. Targeted analysis of real swimming pool water samples confirmed the results of model experiments enabling semi-quantitative determination of CAPB (0.8 µg L-1) and 18 primary DBPs, including 10 chlorine-containing compounds with the total concentration of 0.1 µg L-1. Among them, monochloro (50%) and hydroxydichloro (25%) derivatives predominate. The toxicity and health of the main DBPs has been estimated using QSAR/QSTR approach. Thus, the possibility of formation of new classes of potentially toxic chlorine-containing DBPs associated with the widespread use of detergents and cosmetics was shown.",

Therefore, this study examined the anti-inflammatory effect of maternal betaine intake in offspring mice and its mechanism. MATERIALS/METHODS: Female C57BL/6J mice and their offspring were randomly divided into 3 groups according to the treatment received during gestation and lactation: control diet (CD), fatty liver disease (FLD), and fatty liver disease + 1% betaine (FLD-BET). The FLD group was given a high-fat diet and streptozotocin (HFD + STZ), and the FLD-BET group was treated with HFD + STZ + 1% betaine. After weaning, the offspring mice were given a normal diet for 5 weeks and then dissected to measure the relevant indexes. RESULTS: Compared to the CD group, the offspring mice in the FLD group revealed obvious hepatic steatosis and increased serum levels of alanine aminotransferase, interleukin (IL)-6, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α; maternal betaine supplementation reversed these changes. The hepatic mRNA expression levels of IL-6, IL-18, and Caspase-1 were significantly higher in the FLD group than in the CD group. Maternal betaine supplementation reduced the expression of IL-1β, IL-6, IL-18, and apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing C-terminal caspase recruitment domain (ASC). Maternal betaine supplementation also reversed the increasing protein expressions of nitric oxide dioxygenase-like receptor family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3), ASC, Caspase-1, IL-1β, and IL-18 in offspring mice exposed to HFD + STZ. Maternal betaine supplementation decreased the homocysteine (Hcy) and s-adenosine homocysteine (SAH) levels significantly in the livers. Furthermore, the hepatic Hcy concentrations showed significant inverse relationships with the mRNA expression of TNF-α, NLRP3, ASC, and IL-18. The hepatic SAH concentration was inversely associated with the IL-1β mRNA expression. CONCLUSIONS: The lipotropic and anti-inflammatory effect of maternal betaine supplementation may be associated with the inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasome in the livers of the offspring mice."

Aggressive treatment of RVF is considered an important therapeutic strategy to treat PAH. Previous studies have indicated that betaine may be may a promising therapeutic approach for PAH-induced RVF. Therefore, in this study, betaine solution for injection was prepared and characterised using various techniques. The therapeutic efficacy of three different methods of administration (intragastric, nebulised inhalation and intravenous injection) were comprehensively evaluated in terms of pharmacokinetics, tissue distribution and pharmacodynamics. The pharmacokinetic results demonstrated that betaine injection administered via nebulised inhalation significantly prolonged betaine's half-life and increased its internal circulation time compared to the intragastric and intravenous routes. Biodistribution experiments verified that the betaine formulation accumulated in the lung tissue when administered via inhalation. The results of the pharmacodynamic analysis further confirmed that right ventricular systolic pressure, mean pulmonary artery pressure and right ventricular hypertrophy index increased in the model group and that inhaled betaine suppressed these pathological changes to a level comparable to those observed in the control group. Taken together, these results indicate that betaine administered by inhalation is a promising strategy for the treatment of PAH-induced RVF.",

The study aimed to investigate the influence of the exogenous application of salicylic acid alone (SA) or in combination with glycine betaine (GB) on the growth, yield quality, and water-use efficiency of onions under different DDI treatments (100%, 70%, and 40% field capacity (FC)). Spray treatments (sub-treatments) were as follows: T1: (distilled water), T2: (1.09 mM SA), T3: (1.09 mM SA + 25 mM GB), T4: (1.09 mM SA + 50 mM GB), and T5: (1.09 mM SA + 100 mM GB). Our results indicated that T2 slightly ameliorated the effects of water stress by improved plant heights, leaf number, pseudostem diameter, bulb quality, and nutrient content of onion bulbs, especially under the 70% FC treatment. However, T3 recorded the poorest results on leaf number, pseudostem diameter, and bulb quality under the 70% and 40% FC treatments. Generally, our results indicated that onions could tolerate moderate water stress (70% FC) without severely affecting the growth and yield of onion. In conditions where freshwater is a limiting factor, a DDI treatment of 40% FC is recommended.",

      "abstract": "The aim of this research was to determine the anti-inflammatory effect of betaine on sepsis-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in rats through histopathological examination, radiologic imaging, and biochemical analysis. Eight rats were included in the control group, and no procedure was performed. Feces intraperitoneal procedure (FIP) was performed on 24 rats to create a sepsis-induced ARDS model. These rats were separated into three groups as follows: FIP alone (sepsis group, n=8), FIP + saline (1 mL/kg, placebo group, n=8), and FIP + betaine (500 mg/kg, n=8). Computed tomography (CT) was performed after FIP, and the Hounsfield units (HU) value of the lungs was measured. The plasma levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin-1β (IL-1β), IL-6, C-reactive protein, malondialdehyde (MDA), and lactic acid (LA) were determined, and arterial oxygen pressure (PaO2) and arterial CO2 pressure (PaCO2) were measured from an arterial blood sample. Histopathology was used to evaluate lung damage. This study completed all histopathological and biochemical evaluations in 3 months. All evaluated biomarkers were decreased in the FIP + betaine group compared to FIP + saline and FIP alone (all P<0.05). Also, the parenchymal density of the rat lung on CT and histopathological scores were increased in FIP + saline and FIP alone compared to control and these findings were reversed by betaine treatment (all P<0.05). Our study demonstrated that betaine suppressed the inflammation and ameliorated acute lung injury in a rat model of sepsis.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the associations between dietary and microbiological factors, and the levels and dynamics of 5-amino valeric acid betaine (5-AVAB) in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) through a prospective nested case-control study. An added meta-analysis aimed to provide a comprehensive evaluation of the relationship between 5-AVAB levels and T2D risk. METHODS: A total of 1200 T2D patients and 1200 age- and sex-matched controls were recruited for this study. Dietary information was collected through 24-hour dietary recall questionnaires, while fecal samples were analyzed for gut microbiota composition using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. 5-AVAB levels were measured in plasma samples using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Multivariate logistic regression and general linear models were applied to evaluate the associations between 5-AVAB levels, dietary factors, and gut microbiota composition. RESULTS: The T2D patients exhibited significantly lower plasma 5-AVAB concentrations compared to the control group (P < .001). Lower 5-AVAB levels were associated with higher odds of T2D (adjusted OR = 2.89, 95% CI: 1.76-4.74). Higher intake of dietary factors, including fiber and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), were positively associated with 5-AVAB levels. Furthermore, specific bacterial taxa were significantly associated with 5-AVAB levels. A meta-analysis of five studies corroborated the inverse association between 5-AVAB and T2D risk (pooled OR = 2.68, 95% CI: 1.61-4.46). CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that lower 5-AVAB levels are associated with an increased risk of T2D. Dietary factors and gut microbiota composition appear to significantly influence 5-AVAB levels. The potential use of 5-AVAB as a therapeutic target in T2D management is an exciting area of research that requires further investigation. If successful, it could lead to new treatment options for T2D patients, ultimately improving their long-term health outcomes and quality of life.",

As climate change effects continue to emerge, ensuring productivity and quality becomes increasingly important for viticulturists, as those directly determine their profits. Cultural approaches, such as the use of biostimulants, are actively being developed to mitigate abiotic stress. The main objective of this work was to assess the effect of foliar sprays of a seaweed (Ascophyllum nodosum)-based extract (ANE) and glycine betaine (GB) on grape berry quality, bioactive compounds, and antioxidant activity. A trial was installed in a commercial vineyard (cv. 'Touriga Franca') in the Douro Superior (Upper Douro) sub-region of the Douro Demarcated Region. In 2020 and 2021, three foliar sprayings were performed during the growing season, namely at pea size, bunch closure, and veraison. There was a positive effect of both biostimulants (ANE and GB) on the physiological and biochemical performance of cv. 'Touriga Franca' exposed to summer stress. In general, the GB 0.2% spraying was the most promising treatment for this grape cultivar, as it increased berry quality, the concentration of bioactive compounds (total phenolics, flavonoids, and ortho-diphenols), and the antioxidant activity. These results revealed the efficacy of biostimulant sprayings as a sustainable viticultural practice, improving berry quality under summer stress conditions."

Betaine at 16 mm exerted a greater inhibitory effect on HS-induced viability attenuation of cells, which also significantly suppressed the heat shock protein 70 level in HS-treated cells. Furthermore, betaine ameliorated certain negative effects, including increased cell apoptotic ratio, enhancement of apoptosis-related modulator caspase-3 activity, reduced activity levels of such antioxidant enzymes as SOD, CAT, GSH-Px, and MDA upregulation, and inhibited the protein levels of critical endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress indices like CHOP and GRP78 in mLCs exposed to HS. Besides, treatment of cells with betaine significantly restored diminished testosterone production in response to HS. Correspondingly, betaine effectively rescued the reduced serum testosterone concentration in vivo. In summary, betaine ameliorated HS-induced apoptosis by affecting oxidative and ER stress, thereby providing benefits for the treatment of hyperthermia-related impairment in mLCs.",

      "abstract": "Chronic social isolation (SI) stress, which became more prevalent during the COVID-19 pandemic, contributes to abnormal behavior, including mood changes and cognitive impairment. Known as a functional nutrient, betaine has potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties in vivo. However, whether betaine can alleviate the abnormal behavior induced by chronic SI in mice remains unknown. In this study, we investigated the efficacy of betaine in the treatment of behavioral changes and its underlying mechanism. Three-week-old male mice were randomly housed for 8 weeks in either group housing (GH) or SI. The animals were divided into normal saline-treated GH, normal saline-treated SI, and betaine-treated SI groups in the sixth week. The cognitive and depression-like behavior was determined in the eighth week. We found that long-term betaine administration improved cognitive behavior in SI mice but failed to prevent depression-like behavior. Moreover, long-term betaine administration inhibited hippocampal microglia over-activation and polarized microglia toward the M2 phenotype, which effectively inhibited the expression of inflammatory factors in SI mice. Finally, the protective effect of betaine treatment in SI mice might not be due to altered activity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. Collectively, our findings reveal that betaine can improve SI-induced cognitive impairment, thus providing an alternative natural source for the prevention of memory loss caused by SI or loneliness.",

      "abstract": "Doxorubicin (Dox) is an anthracycline antibiotic used to treat various cancers and shows severe toxicity in multiple organ systems, including kidneys. Evidence shows that betaine's antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties could prevent the onset of several disorders. Hence, the present study aims to investigate the therapeutic potential of betaine on Dox-induced nephrotoxicity (DIN). Nephrotoxicity was induced in male Sprague Dawley rats using Dox at a dose of 4 mg/kg (cumulative dose: 20 mg/kg) by the intraperitoneal route and cotreated with betaine through oral gavage (200 and 400 mg/kg) for 28 days. At the end of the experiment, biochemical, oxidative stress parameters, histopathology, and qRT-PCR were performed. DIN was indicated by elevated serum creatinine, urea, and decreased albumin levels representing kidney damage; the histopathological lesions (increased capsular space, renal tubule damage, and fibrosis) in renal tissues supported these biochemical findings. Interestingly, betaine treatment improves these alterations in Dox-treated rats. Further, betaine treatment decreases the lipid peroxidation and nitrite concentration and increases the superoxide dismutases and catalase enzyme concentration in Dox-treated rats. Fascinatingly, at the molecular level, DIN in rats shows upregulation of the Nrf2/HO-1 gene, while betaine treatment attenuated its expression along with the downregulation of inflammatory genes (NLRP3, TLR-4, TNF-α, and IL-6) and fibrosis-related genes (TGF-β and Acta2) expression in Dox-treated rats. These results showed that betaine has reno-protective properties by reducing inflammatory and fibrotic mediators and enhancing antioxidant capacity in the renal tissue of rats treated with Dox. We believe betaine can be exploited as a dietary supplement to attenuate DIN.",

These studies also demonstrate that betaine supplementation in healthy humans is straight-forward with no reported adverse effects. Here, we explore betaine uptake in the central nervous system (CNS) and contribute to evidence that betaine may be uniquely protective to the brain. We specifically describe the therapeutic potential of betaine and explore the potential implications of betaine on inhibition mediated by GABA and glycine neurotransmission. The influence of betaine on neurophysiology complement betaine's role as an osmolyte and metabolite and is consistent with clinical evidence of betaine-mediated improvements to cognitive function (reported in elderly populations) and its anti-convulsant properties. Betaine's therapeutic potential in neurological disorders including epilepsy and neurodegenerative diseases combined with benefits of betaine supplementation on athletic performance support the unique application of betaine as a prophylaxis to concussion. As an example, we identify young athletes (15-24 years old), especially females, for prophylactic betaine supplementation to promote brain health and resilience in a cohort at high risk for concussion and for developing Alzheimer's disease."

Our results indicated that both 10 mM and 20 mM treatments effectively reduced weight and firmness losses and maintained total soluble solid (TSS), titratable acidity (TA), and ascorbic acid contents. Additionally, GB treatment significantly increased the activity of antioxidant enzymes, maintained higher levels of total phenols and total flavonoids, and led to slower accumulation of H2O2. A transcriptome analysis conducted at 28 days after treatment (DAT)identified 391 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between 20 mM GB (GB-2) and the control (CK) group. These DEGs were enriched in various pathways, particularly related to oxygen oxidoreductase, peroxidase activity, and flavonoid biosynthesis. Overall, the application of GB proved beneficial in enhancing the storability and extending the shelf life of 'Huangguogan' fruit."

Accumulating evidence suggests a role in metabolic dysfunction associated with obesity, diabetes, and fatty liver disease. However, whether 5-AVAB plays a role in human disease is unclear, and human data are sparse. METHODS: We measured circulating 5-AVAB serum levels in 143 individuals with overweight or obesity participating in a randomized intervention study (NCT00850629) investigating the long-term effect of a weight maintenance strategy after diet-induced weight reduction. RESULTS: Higher 5-AVAB serum levels correlate with worse estimates of obesity, glucose metabolism, and hepatic steatosis after weight loss. Furthermore, higher 5-AVAB levels after weight loss independently predict detrimental changes in glucose metabolism 18 months after the successful weight reduction. CONCLUSION: Our human data supports previous findings in rodents indicating a relevant, potentially disadvantageous function of 5-AVAB in the context of metabolic dysbalance.",

The results indicated that Bet and PCB supplementation individually and together did not differ performance, relative weights of heart, gizzard, proventriculus, bursa of Fabricius and pancreas, water holding capacity (WHC), cooking loss (CL), blood biochemical values except for glucose and triglyceride. Bet supplementation significantly increased relative liver weights, while PCB supplementation decreased glucose levels in serum. Moreover, carcass yield was increased and triglyceride value in blood serum, malondialdehyde (MDA), and the pH levels of breast meats both on the 1st and 30st day of post-mortem were decreased in all treatment groups. Therefore, based on these results, the combination of betaine and butyrate improves both carcass yield and meat quality in growing Japanese quails. More research is needed to determine the impact of betaine and butyrate on the structure of amino acids in meat, antioxidant enzyme activity, and the immune system in poultry.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The objective of the present study was to investigate the effect of dietary betaine (BT) supplementation on the hepatic transcriptome profiles in broiler chickens raised under heat stress (HS) conditions. METHODS: A total of 180 (21-d-old) Ross 308 male broiler chicks were allotted to 1 of 3 treatment groups with 6 replicated cages in a completely randomized design. One group was kept under thermoneutral conditions at all times and was fed a basal diet (PC). Other 2 groups were exposed to a cyclic heat stress condition. One of the 2 groups under heat stress conditions was fed the basal diet as a negative control (NC), whereas the other group was fed the basal diet supplemented with 0.2% BT. All chickens were provided with diets and water ad libitum for 21 d. Following the experiment, the liver samples were collected for RNA sequencing analysis. RESULTS: Broiler chickens in NC and BT group had decreased (p<0.05) growth performance. In the transcriptome analysis, the number of differentially expressed genes were identified in the liver by HS conditions and dietary BT supplementation. In the comparison between NC and PC treatments, genes related to energy and nucleic acid metabolism, amino acid metabolism, and immune system were altered by HS, which support the reason why heat-stressed poultry had decreased growth performance. In the comparison between NC and BT treatments, genes related to lipid metabolism, carbohydrate metabolism, and immune system were differently expressed under HS conditions. CONCLUSION: HS negatively impacts various physiological processes, including DNA replication, metabolism of amino acids, lipids, and carbohydrates, and cell cycle progression in broiler chickens. Dietary BT supplementation, however, offers potential counteractive effects by modulating liver function, facilitating gluconeogenesis, and enhancing immune systems. These findings provide a basis for understanding molecular responses by HS and the possible benefits of dietary BT supplementation in broiler chickens exposed to HS."

      "abstract": "In this research, the cationization process of microporous starch with betaine hydrochloride (BHC) in the presence of H3PO4 (as a catalyst) under heating/cooling cycles was reported for the first time. Granular microporous starch was initially prepared from normal corn starch (NS) through amyloglucosidase treatment. Then, solid state cationization reaction of microporous starch (MS) with betaine hydrochloride (BHC) was performed under repeated dry-heat modification. The cationic microporous starch showed higher substitution degree (0.031) and reaction efficiency (89.1 %) in comparison with cationic starch based on NS (0.021, 60.3 %), which this can be attributed to the increased probability of effective collision between BHC molecules and starch granules after enzymatic treatment. The analysis of cationic starches by FTIR and 13C NMR confirmed the presence of cationic functional groups on starch chains. Further examinations on the modified starches by single and dual treatments were accomplished with respect to morphology, particle size distribution, X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), colour parameters, zeta potential, amylose content, viscosity, solubility, and swelling power. The greenness of the suggested dual treatment (score: 82) in this work was evaluated and compared to a conventional method reported in literature (score: 67) on the preparation of cationic starches.",

The results showed that the lignin (47.1%) and xylan (44.6%) were removed, the cellulase digestibility of Betaine:LA-treated SCB was 4.2 times that of the raw material. This improved efficiency was attributed to the enhanced accessibility of cellulose, the weakened surface area of lignin, the declined hydrophobicity, and the decreased crystallinity of cellulose.

Glycine betaine (GB), an osmoregulatory substance, has increasingly valuable effects on plant stress resistance. In this study, pepper seedlings were treated with different concentrations of GB under LL stress, and 20 mM of GB was the best treatment. To further explore the mechanism of GB in response to LL stress, four treatments, including CK (normal temperature and light, 28/18 °C, 300 μmol m-2 s-1), CB (normal temperature and light + 20 mM GB), LL (10/5 °C, 100 μmol m-2 s-1), and LB (10/5 °C, 100 μmol m-2 s-1 + 20 mM GB), were investigated in terms of pepper growth, biomass accumulation, photosynthetic capacity, expression levels of encoded proteins Capsb, cell membrane permeability, antioxidant enzyme gene expression and activity, and subcellular localization. The results showed that the pre-spraying of GB under LL stress significantly alleviated the growth inhibition of pepper seedlings; increased plant height by 4.64%; increased root activity by 63.53%; and decreased photoinhibition by increasing the chlorophyll content; upregulating the expression levels of encoded proteins Capsb A, Capsb B, Capsb C, Capsb D, Capsb S, Capsb P1, and Capsb P2 by 30.29%, 36.69%, 18.81%, 30.05%, 9.01%, 6.21%, and 16.45%, respectively; enhancing the fluorescence intensity (OJIP curves), the photochemical efficiency (Fv/Fm, Fv'/Fm'), qP, and NPQ; improving the light energy distribution of PSΠ (Y(II), Y(NPQ), and Y(NO)); and increasing the photochemical reaction fraction and reduced heat dissipation, thereby increasing plant height by 4.64% and shoot bioaccumulation by 13.55%. The pre-spraying of GB under LL stress also upregulated the gene expression of CaSOD, CaPOD, and CaCAT; increased the activity of the ROS-scavenging ability in the pepper leaves; and coordinately increased the SOD activity in the mitochondria, the POD activity in the mitochondria, chloroplasts, and cytosol, and the CAT activity in the cytosol, which improved the LL resistance of the pepper plants by reducing excess H2O2, O2-, MDA, and soluble protein levels in the leaf cells, leading to reduced biological membrane damage. Overall, pre-spraying with GB effectively alleviated the negative effects of LL stress in pepper seedlings."

A nutrition-based intervention was investigated in cats with CKD for its effects on body composition, the plasma metabolome, and possible implications on health. METHODS: After a 4-week prefeed period with the control food, cats with CKD (N = 24) were randomized to one of six groups to consume a control food; a food supplemented with 0.5% betaine, 0.39% oat beta-glucan, and 0.27% short-chain fructooligosaccharides (scFOS, test food 1); and a food supplemented with 0.5% betaine, 0.59% oat beta-glucan, and 0.41% scFOS (test food 2) in a William's Latin Square design, each for 10 weeks. Body composition was assessed via dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry measurements, and the plasma metabolome was characterized. RESULTS: Despite no significant differences in daily intake among the three foods, significant increases in total body mass, lean body mass, and lean plus bone mineral composition were observed when cats with CKD consumed test food 1 compared with the control food; numerical increases were seen with test food 2 versus the control food. Plasma metabolomics indicated increased one-carbon metabolism following consumption of test food 1 and/or 2, with significant increases in sarcosine and numerical increases in methionine. Lower levels of plasma trans-4-hydroxyproline and N-methylproline following consumption of test foods 1 and 2 indicates reduced collagen breakdown and perhaps reduced fibrosis. Several acylcarnitines and branched-chain fatty acids associated with CKD were also reduced when cats ate test food 1 or 2 versus the control food. Higher plasma levels of sphingomyelins with consumption of test food 1 or 2 may reflect less severe CKD. CONCLUSIONS: Consumption of foods with supplemental betaine and fibers by cats with CKD led to improvements in body composition and changes in the plasma metabolome that correspond to better kidney health.",

Day-of-hatch Cobb 500 male broiler chicks (n = 475) were randomly divided into four groups. Group 1: No heat stress (Thermoneutral) + control diets with no antibiotics; Group 2: heat stress control + control diets; Group 3: heat stress + control diets supplemented with thymol chemotype (45 ppm) and herbal betaine (150 ppm) formulation EO1; Group 4: heat stress + control diets supplemented with phellandrene (45 ppm) and herbal betaine (150 ppm) formulation EO2. From day 10-42, the heat stress groups were exposed to cyclic HS at 35°C for 12 h (8:00-20:00). BW, BWG, FI, and FCRc were measured at d 0, 10, 28, and 42. Chickens were orally gavaged with FITC-d on days 10 (before heat stress) and 42. Morphometric analysis of duodenum and ileum samples and bone mineralization of tibias were done. Meat quality was assessed on day 43 with ten chickens per pen per treatment. Heat stress reduced BW by day 28 (p < 0.05) compared to thermoneutral chickens. At the end of the trial, chickens that received both formulations of EO1 and EO2 had significantly higher BW than HS control chickens. A similar trend was observed for BWG. FCRc was impaired by EO2 supplementation. There was a significant increase in total mortality in EO2 compared with EO1 EO1 chickens had lower FITC-d concentrations at day 42 than the HS control. In addition, EO1 treatment is not statistically different if compared to EO2 and thermoneutral. Control HS broilers had significantly lower tibia breaking strength and total ash at day 42 than heat-stressed chickens supplemented with EO1 and EO2. Heat stress affected intestinal morphology more than thermoneutral chickens. EO1 and EO2 improved intestinal morphology in heat-stressed chickens. Woody breast and white striping were more common in thermoneutral chickens than heat stress chickens. In conclusion, the EO-containing diet could improve broiler chicken growth during cyclic heat stress, becoming increasingly relevant in antibiotic-free production in harsh climates."

      "abstract": "The purpose of the present study was to assess the performance, quality of eggs internally and externally, and antioxidant capacity of yolks in laying quails with the administration of choline and betaine to diets containing reduced methionine levels. A total of 150 Japanese laying quails (Coturnix coturnix japonica) at the 10-wk age were randomly assigned to 6 experimental groups, each consisting of 5 replicates and 5 birds for 10 wk. The treatment diets were designed by adding the following substances: 0.45% methionine (C), 0.30% methionine (LM), 0.30% methionine + 0.15% choline (LMC), 0.30% methionine + 0.20% betaine (LMB), 0.30% methionine + 0.075% choline + 0.10% betaine (LMCB1), 0.30% methionine + 0.15% choline + 0.20% betaine (LMCB2). The treatments did not affect performance, egg production, or egg internal quality (P > 0.05). No significant effect was determined on the damaged egg rate (P > 0.05), but the egg-breaking strength, eggshell thickness, and eggshell relative weight decreased in the LMCB2 group (P < 0.05). Regarding lipid peroxidation, treatments did not affect the yolk 2,2 diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl value (P > 0.05), although the lowest thiobarbituric acid reactive substances value was observed in the LMB compared to the control group (P < 0.05). It may be summarized that methionine can be decreased to levels of 0.30% for laying quail diets with no negative effect on performance, egg production, or egg internal quality, whereas the combination of methionine (0.30%) and betaine (0.2%) could improve antioxidant stability of eggs over the 10-wk experimental period. These findings provide useful information to the traditional recommendations on the requirements of laying quail. However, further studies are needed to test whether these effects persist throughout extended study periods.",

This experiment measured metabolic responses to glucose (intravenous glucose tolerance, IVGTT), insulin (insulin tolerance test, ITT), and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) challenges in Merino ewes (n = 36, 39.7 kg) maintained at thermoneutral (TN, 21 °C) or HE (18-43 °C) and supplemented with either 0, 2, or 4 g/day dietary betaine (n = 6 per group). Sheep had ad libitum access to water and were pair-fed such that the intake of the TN sheep mimicked that of the HE sheep. After 21 days of treatment, sheep were fitted with jugular catheters and subjected to consecutive daily challenges (IVGTT, ITT, and ACTH, d 21-23, respectively), followed by skeletal muscle and subcutaneous adipose tissue biopsy collections for gene expression analysis (d 24). The HE-treated sheep had a greater insulin:glucose ratio (p = 0.033), a greater estimated homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMAIR; p = 0.029), and a reduced revised quantitative insulin sensitivity check index (RQUICKI; p = 0.015). Sheep fed betaine (2 + 4 g/day) had a greater basal plasma insulin (p = 0.017) and a reduced basal non-esterified fatty acid (NEFA; p = 0.036) concentration, while the RQUICKI was reduced (p = 0.001) in sheep fed betaine. The results suggested that betaine supplementation alters lipid metabolism by potentially improving insulin signaling, although these responses differ between TN and HE conditions. There was no other impact of temperature or dietary treatments on the tissue gene expressions measured. Our results support the notion that betaine, in part, acts to modify lipid metabolism."

A total of four hundred twenty 21-d-old Ross 308 broiler chickens were randomly allotted to 1 of 5 dietary treatments with 7 replicates. Birds in treatment 1 were raised under the thermoneutral condition (TN; 23 ± 0.6°C). Birds in other 4 treatment groups were subjected to a cyclic HS by exposing them to 32 ± 0.9°C for 8 h/d (from 09:00 to 17:00 h) and 28 ± 1.2°C for the remaining time for 14 d. Birds were fed a basal diet in TN condition (TN-C) and one group in HS conditions (HS-C), whereas other birds raised under HS conditions were fed the basal diet supplemented with 0.20% Bet (HS-Bet), 0.79% Gly (HS-Gly), or their combination (0.20% Bet + 0.79% Gly; HS-Bet+Gly). Results indicated that birds in HS-Bet, HS-Gly, or HS-Bet+Gly treatment had higher (P < 0.05) final BW and BW gain, but lower (P < 0.05) feed conversion ratio (FCR) than those in HS-C treatment. However, values for improved final BW, BW gain, and FCR by dietary treatments were lower (P < 0.05) than those measured in TN-C treatment. Under HS conditions, birds in HS-Bet, HS-Gly, or HS-Bet+Gly treatment had lower (P < 0.05) heterophil to lymphocyte ratio than those in HS-C treatment. Birds in HS-Gly or HS-Bet+Gly treatment had higher (P < 0.05) villus height and goblet cell number than birds in HS-C treatment. Intestinal permeability was higher (P < 0.05) in all HS-treatment groups than in TN-C treatment, but it was not affected by dietary treatment. In conclusion, individual supplementation of 0.20% Bet or 0.79% Gly in diets alleviates the negative effect of HS in broiler chickens. However, the synergistic effect of the combination of 0.20% Bet and 0.79% Gly in broiler diets seems lower than expected.",

      "abstract": "The beneficial role of glycine betaine (GB) in the adaptation of plants to abiotic stresses is well known; therefore, the study of physiological and molecular responses induced by exogenous GB under NaCl stress can provide a suitable reference for the application of this compound to enhance the adaptation of plants to salinity. The present study was conducted under in vitro conditions to evaluate the effect of GB (25 and 50 mM) on the growth, physiological, and molecular traits of Stevia rebaudiana during NaCl toxicity (50 mM). The results showed that applying NaCl treatment increased Na accumulation, induced oxidative stress, and disrupted N metabolism and K/Na homeostasis, which, as a result, decreased the stevia plant's growth and biomass. However, application of GB improved the adaptation of NaCl-stressed plants by improving N metabolism and modulating the metabolism of polyamines. By increasing the activity of antioxidant enzymes, GB diminished oxidative stress, protected the plasma membrane, and restored photosynthetic pigments under NaCl toxicity. By reducing Na accumulation and increasing K accumulation, GB maintained the K/Na balance and reduced the effects of toxicity caused by the high Na concentration in stevia leaves. GB increased the leaf accumulation of rebaudioside A in NaCl-stressed plants by modulating the expression of genes (KAH, UGT74G1, UGT76G1, and UGT85C2) involved in the sugar compounds of the stevia plants. Our results provide a broad understanding of GB-induced responses in NaCl-stressed plants, which can help increase our knowledge of the role of GB in the defense mechanisms of plants under abiotic stresses."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: With an ageing population, the incidence of bone loss and obesity are increasing. Numerous studies emphasized the multidirectional differentiation ability of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), and reported betaine modulated the osteogenic differentiation and adipogenic differentiation of MSCs in vitro. We wondered how betaine affected the differentiation of hAD-MSCs and hUC-MSCs. METHODS AND RESULTS: ALP staining and alizarin red S (ARS) staining were proved 10 mM betaine significantly increased the number of ALP-positive cells and plaque calcified extracellular matrices, accompanying by the up-regulation of OPN, Runx-2 and OCN. Oil red O staining demonstrated the number and size of lipid droplets were reduced, the expression of adipogenic master genes such as PPARγ, CEBPα and FASN were down-regulated simultaneously. For further investigating the mechanism of betaine on hAD-MSCs, RNA-seq was performed in none-differentiation medium. The Gene Ontology (GO) analysis showed fat cell differentiation and bone mineralization function terms were enriched, and KEGG showed PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction and ECM-receptor interaction pathways were enriched in betaine treated hAD-MSCs, demonstrated betaine had a positive inducing effect on osteogenic of hAD-MSCs in the non-differentiation medium in vitro, which is opposite to the effect on adipogenic differentiation. CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrated that betaine promoted osteogenic and compromised adipogenic differentiation of hUC-MSCs and hAD-MSCs upon low concentration administration. PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction and ECM-receptor interaction were significantly enriched under betaine-treated. We showed hAD-MSCs were more sensitive to betaine stimulation and have a better differentiation ability than hUC-MSCs. Our results contributed to the exploration of betaine as an aiding agent for MSCs therapy.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: This research aimed to examine the effects of water-added betaine (BET) and/or nano-emulsified vegetable oil (MAGO) on carcass and meat quality characteristics of broilers raised under thermoneutral (TN) and heat stress (HS) conditions. METHODS: On day 21, 640 birds (Ross 308) were randomly assigned to one of two thermal conditions (thermoneutral 22 ± 1°C and heat stress 32 ± 1°C) each containing four treatment groups: Control, BET, MAGO, and a mixture of both (BETMAGO) in a 2 × 4 factorial arrangement (eight groups). Each group has eight replicates, with ten birds each. The birds' carcass and meat quality characteristics were evaluated at 35 days. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The dressing percentage, breast, leg, wing, heart, initial pH, color change, cooking loss (CL), water-holding capacity (WHC), shear force (SF), and texture profile with exception of springiness significantly affected by the treatments. The results showed that HS had negative effects on carcass weight and relative weights of the breast, spleen, and heart. Moreover, HS increased dressing percentage, wing, initial pH, final core temperature, initial lightness, WHC, and hardness. Significant differences in interactions between treatments and temperature were observed in the spleen, WHC, and SF. CONCLUSION: Water supplemented with BET effectively improved carcass dressing percentage, breast weight, and meat quality in terms of water-holding capacity and tenderness under HS conditions. More studies on the use of BET and/or MAGO at different levels were recommended."

      "abstract": "Skeletal muscle atrophy is represented by a dramatic decrease in muscle mass, and it is related to a lower life expectancy. Among the different causes, chronic inflammation and cancer promote protein loss through the effect of inflammatory cytokines, leading to muscle shrinkage. Thus, the availability of safe methods to counteract inflammation-derived atrophy is of high interest. Betaine is a methyl derivate of glycine and it is an important methyl group donor in transmethylation. Recently, some studies found that betaine could promote muscle growth, and it is also involved in anti-inflammatory mechanisms. Our hypothesis was that betaine would be able to prevent tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α)-mediated muscle atrophy in vitro. We treated differentiated C2C12 myotubes for 72 hr with either TNF-α, betaine, or a combination of them. After the treatment, we analyzed total protein synthesis, gene expression, and myotube morphology. Betaine treatment blunted the decrease in muscle protein synthesis rate exerted by TNF-α, and upregulated Mhy1 gene expression in both control and myotube treated with TNF-α. In addition, morphological analysis revealed that myotubes treated with both betaine and TNF-α did not show morphological features of TNF-α-mediated atrophy. We demonstrated that in vitro betaine supplementation counteracts the muscle atrophy led by inflammatory cytokines.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Wounds cost £8.3 billion per year in the United Kingdom (UK) annually. Venous leg ulcers (VLUs) account for 15% of wounds and can be complicated to heal, increasing nurse visits and resource costs. Recent wound bed preparation consensus recommends wound cleansing and biofilm disrupting agents. However, inert cleansers such as tap water or saline are inexpensive, an evaluation of evidence is required to justify the higher upfront costs of treatment with active cleansers. We undertook a cost-effectiveness analysis of the use of a biofilm disrupting and cleansing solution and gel, Prontosan® Solution and Gel X, (PSGX) (B Braun Medical), as compared to the standard practice of using saline solution, for treating VLUs. METHODS: A Markov model was parameterised to one-year costs and health-related quality of life consequences of treating chronic VLUs with PSGX versus saline solution. Costs are viewed from a UK healthcare payer perspective, include routine care and management of complications. A systematic literature search was performed to inform the clinical parameters of the economic model. Deterministic univariate sensitivity analysis (DSA) and probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA) were undertaken. RESULTS: For PSGX an Incremental Net Monetary Benefit (INMB) of £1,129.65 to £1,042.39 per patient (with a Maximum Willingness to Pay of £30k and £20k per QALY respectively), of which cost savings are £867.87 and 0.0087 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gain per patient. PSA indicates a 99.3% probability of PSGX being cost-effective over saline. CONCLUSIONS: PSGX for the treatment of VLUs is dominant compared with saline solution in the UK with expected cost-savings within a year and improved patient outcomes.",

      "abstract": "The earliest manifestation of alcohol-associated liver disease is hepatic steatosis, which is characterized by fat accumulation in specialized organelles called lipid droplets (LDs). Our previous studies reported that alcohol consumption elevates the numbers and sizes of LDs in hepatocytes, which is attenuated by simultaneous treatment with the methyl group donor, betaine. Here, we examined changes in the hepatic lipidome with respect to LD size and dynamics in male Wistar rats fed for 6 weeks with control or ethanol-containing liquid diets that were supplemented with or without 10 mg betaine/mL. At the time of sacrifice, three hepatic LD fractions, LD1 (large droplets), LD2 (medium-sized droplets), and LD3 (small droplets) were isolated from each rat. Untargeted lipidomic analyses revealed that each LD fraction of ethanol-fed rats had higher phospholipids, cholesteryl esters, diacylglycerols, ceramides, and hexosylceramides compared with the corresponding fractions of pair-fed controls. Interestingly, the ratio of phosphatidylcholine to phosphatidylethanolamine (the two most abundant phospholipids on the LD surface) was lower in LD1 fraction compared with LD3 fraction, irrespective of treatment; however, this ratio was significantly lower in ethanol LD fractions compared with their respective control fractions. Betaine supplementation significantly attenuated the ethanol-induced lipidomic changes. These were mainly associated with the regulation of LD surface phospholipids, ceramides, and glycerolipid metabolism in different-sized LD fractions. In conclusion, our results show that ethanol-induced changes in the hepatic LD lipidome likely stabilizes larger-sized LDs during steatosis development. Furthermore, betaine supplementation could effectively reduce the size and dynamics of LDs to attenuate alcohol-associated hepatic steatosis."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Choline is an important metabolite involved in phospholipids synthesis, including serum lipids, and is the immediate precursor of betaine. There are numerous studies with inconsistent results that evaluated the association between dietary choline intakes with cardiovascular risk factors. In addition, the association between dietary betaine and choline intakes with cardio-metabolic risk factors is not well studied. In the current study, our aim was to evaluate dietary choline and betaine intakes in the usual diet of obese individuals and to assess its association with serum lipids, blood pressure and glycemic markers among obese individuals. METHODS: We recruited a total number of 359 obese people aged between 20 and 50 years in the present study. A semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) was used for dietary assessment; dietary choline and betaine intakes were calculated using the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) database. National cholesterol education program adult treatment panel (NCEP-ATP)-III criteria was used metabolic syndrome (MetS) definition. Enzymatic methods were used to assess biochemical variables. Body composition was measured with the bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) method. RESULTS: Higher body mass index (BMI), waist to hip ratio (WHR), fat-free mass (FFM) and basal metabolic rate (BMR) were observed in higher tertiles of dietary choline intake (P < 0.01). There was no significant difference in terms of biochemical parameters among different tertiles of dietary choline intake, while systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) were reduced in higher betaine tertiles (P < 0.05). For total dietary choline and betaine intakes, there was a reduction in DBP and low density lipoprotein (LDL) concentrations (P < 0.05). Also, a non-significant reduction in serum total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG) and MetS prevalence was observed in higher tertiles of dietary choline and betaine intakes. After classification of the study population according to MetS status, there was no significant difference in biochemical variables in subjects with MetS (P > 0.05), while in the non-MetS group, SBP, DBP, TG and insulin levels reduced in higher tertiles of dietary betaine and choline (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: According to our findings, higher dietary intakes of choline and betaine were associated with lower levels of blood pressure and LDL concentrations among obese individuals. Further studies are warranted to confirm the results of the current study.",

      "abstract": "CONTEXT: In diabetes, abnormalities of granulosa cells (GCs) and steroidogenesis are associated with hyperglycaemia-induced oxidative stress. Betaine has beneficial effect in experimental model of diabetes by reducing oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis. AIMS: In this study we investigate the effects of betaine to prevent oxidative stress in GCs induced by high glucose and improve steroidogenesis. METHODS: Primary GCs, isolated from ovarian follicles of C57BL/6 mice were cultured in 5mM (control) and 30mM (hyperglycaemia) of glucose and in presence of 5mM of betaine for 24h. Then antioxidant enzymes, malondialdehyde, oestradiol and progesterone were measured. In addition, the expression of Nrf2 and NF-κB , antioxidant enzymes (Sod1 , Gpx and Cat ) were analysed by qRT-PCR assay. KEY RESULTS: We observed significant (P <0.001) up-regulation of NF-κB and down-regulation of Nrf2 due to high concentration of glucose. Also significant (P <0.001) down-regulation of related antioxidant genes (Cat , Sod1 and GPx ) and activity reduction of these enzymes as well as significant (P <0.001) elevation of malondialdehyde was observed. In addition, betaine treatment compensated the drastic effect of high glucose induced oxidative stress via down-regulating the expression of NF-κB and up-regulating the expression of Nrf2 , Cat , Sod1 and GPx . It was also shown that betaine in the presence of FSH significantly (P <0.001) restored the oestradiol and progesterone level. CONCLUSION: Betaine compensated the antioxidant stress in mouse GCs under hyperglycaemic condition via regulation of Nrf2/NF-κB at transcription level. IMPLICATIONS: As betaine is a natural product and no side effect has been reported to today, we suggest more research needs to be carried out especially on patients whom suffer from diabetes to find the probability of using betaine as a therapeutic agent.",
