      "abstract": "Artificial sweeteners (ASs) and dyes are widely used in foods, beverages and pharmaceutical and are recognized as emerging environmental contaminants due to their persistence and widespread occurrence. These substances often pass through the human body unchanged and resist wastewater treatment processes, leading to continuous introduction into aquatic environments and potential long-lasting term environmental effects. This study investigated, for the first time, the biodegradability of nine commercial dietary supplements, both natural and those containing ASs and synthetic dyes, using the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) 301 F ready biodegradation test (RBT), which is a respirometry-manometric method. While the products showed good biodegradability, those containing ASs and dyes were further studied to determine their fate at the end of the RBT. The study involved developing and validating a chromatographic method to quantitatively determine the presence of Acesulfame K (1), Sucralose (2), Tartrazine (3) and Carmoisine (4) in the RBT mineral medium, using ultra-high performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC) coupled with two detectors: a high-resolution mass-spectrometer with quadrupole time-of-flight (qToF) and a UV-Vis diode array detector (DAD). Results indicated that these additives were not readily biodegraded, highlighting a potential significant environmental concern. This issue extends beyond dietary supplements to all Pharmaceutical and Personal Care Products (PPCP) including drugs and medical devices. The findings underscore the importance of raising cultural awareness about the environmental impact of persistent substances, encouraging the healthcare chain and patients to make informed choices. From a One Health perspective, reducing environmental contamination can lead to positive outcomes for human health.",

      "abstract": "Artificial sweeteners (ASs) were frequently detectable in wastewater, which pose high risks to human health and ecological security. The feasibility of anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox) process for treatment of ASs-containing wastewater was evaluated in this study. The 86-d continuous flow experiment results showed that 0-30 μg L-1 cyclamate and acesulfame did not significantly affect the nitrogen removal efficiency (NRE) of anammox processes, which were 94.5 ± 3.0 % and 96.6 ± 2.5 %, respectively. Simultaneously, specific anammox activity (SAA) was inhibited by 15 μg L-1 ASs. Fortunately, anammox consortia adapted to the ASs stress by secreting extracellular polymeric substance (EPS). The relative abundances of Candidatus Kuenenia slightly decreased by 0.2 % and 2.3 % under stress of two ASs, and the microbial diversity increased. In addition, the anammox consortia regulated metabolites expression by cell energy allocation. The dominant metabolic pathways were amino acid metabolism, lipid metabolism and nucleotide metabolism. Particularly, the abundances of 5-hydroxylysinonorleucine and L-hypoglycin A significantly increased with ASs concentrations, which were crucial for bacterial proliferation. The co-metabolism between different bacteria might contribute to the biodegradation of ASs. This work demonstrates the feasibility of anammox process to treat the ASs-containing wastewater and reveals the regulation and adaptation mechanism of anammox microbiota, which further drives the implementation and development of anammox process.",

Meanwhile, Micro-KL and Nano-KL increased ACE degradation by 76.8 % and 84.2 %, and SUC degradation by 75.3 % and 77.7 %, and significantly shifted microbial community structure. Furthermore, kaolin caused a positive association between Actinobacteria and sweetener degradation. Taken together, kaolin effectively inhibited nitrogen loss and promoted the degradation of ACE and SUC during the SS composting, which is of great significance for the removal of emerging organic pollutants in SS.",

      "abstract": "Acesulfame (ACE), sucralose (SUC), cyclamate (CYC), and saccharin (SAC) are widely used artificial sweeteners that undergo negligible metabolism in the human body, and thus ubiquitously exist in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). Due to their persistence in WWTPs, ACE and SUC are found in natural waters globally. Wastewater samples were collected from the primary influent, primary effluent, secondary effluent, and final effluent of a WWTP in Alberta, Canada between August 2022 and February 2023, and the artificial sweeteners concentrations were measured by LC-MS/MS. Using wastewater-based epidemiology, the daily per capita consumption of ACE in the studied wastewater treatment plant catchment was estimated to be the highest in the world. Similar to other studies, the removal efficiency in WWTP was high for SAC and CYC, but low or even negative for SUC. However, ACE removal remained surprisingly high (>96%), even in the cold Canadian winter months. This result may indicate a further adaptation of microorganisms capable of biodegrading ACE in WWTP. The estimated per capita discharge into the environment of ACE, CYC, and SAC is low in Alberta due to the prevalent utilization of secondary treatment throughout the province, but is 17.4-18.8 times higher in Canada, since only 70.3% of total discharged wastewater in Canada undergoes secondary treatment.",

      "abstract": "Artificial sweeteners (ASs) are emerging contaminants in the environment, primarily derived from wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluents. In this study, the influents and effluents of three WWTPs in the Dalian urban area, China, were analyzed for the distribution of 8 typical ASs to investigate their seasonal fluctuations in the WWTPs. The results showed that acesulfame (ACE), sucralose (SUC), cyclamate (CYC), and saccharin (SAC) were both detected in the influent and effluent water samples of WWTPs, with concentrations ranging from not detected (ND) to 14.02 μg·L-1. In addition, SUC was the most abundant ASs type, accounting for 40 %-49 % and 78 %-96 % of the total ASs in the influent and effluent water, respectively. The WWTPs revealed high removal efficiencies of CYC, SAC, and ACE, while the SUC removal efficiency was poor (26 % ± 36 %). The ACE and SUC concentrations were higher in spring and summer, and all ASs showed lower levels in winter, which may be caused by the high consumption of ice-cream in warmer months. The per capita ASs loads in the WWTPs were determined in this study based on the wastewater analysis results. The calculated per capita daily mas loads for individual ASs ranged from 0.45 g·d-1·1000p-1 (ACE) to 2.04 g·d-1·1000p-1 (SUC). In addition, the relationship between per capita ASs consumption and socioeconomic status showed no significant correlation.",

This study systematically investigated the occurrence and distribution of four commonly used ASs in the effluent of wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), surface water and groundwater in the middle and lower reaches of the Yellow River (Henan section). Sucralose (SUC) was dominant in WWTP effluents and had the highest mass loading. Acesulfame (ACE), cyclamate (CYC), saccharin (SAC), and SUC were consistently detected in surface water at concentrations ranging from 1.364 ng/L (CYC) to 7786 ng/L (ACE). Spatial analysis showed that the pollution level of ASs in the trunk stream was lower than that in most tributaries. The total concentrations of ASs detected in surface water ranged between 308.7 and 10,498 ng/L, while in groundwater, the total concentration of ASs detected was between ND-4863 ng/L. ACE and SUC are the main pollutants in surface water and groundwater within this survey area. The risk assessment showed that the risks of the four target ASs to aquatic organisms were negligible (risk quotient (RQ) values < 0.1), and the maximum risk quotient of the mixtures (MRQ) values of all rivers were all much less than 0.1.",

      "abstract": "Artificial sweeteners discharged into aquatic environments have raised concern because of their ubiquitous occurrence and potential biological effect. And some of them, such as sucralose (SUC) and acesulfame (ACE), have been identified as emerging contaminants. Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are considered as important sources and sinks of artificial sweeteners discharged into the environment. In this study, the occurrence and removal of four representative artificial sweeteners in 12 WWTPs located in different provinces of China were investigated. The results showed that artificial sweeteners were detected widely in the investigated WWTPs. The median concentrations of the four target artificial sweeteners were detected in influents at levels of 0.03-3.85 μg L-1 and decreased in the order of SUC > ACE > aspartame (APM) > neotame (NTM). Additionally, the per capita mass loads of total artificial sweeteners in the WWTPs could be affected by the location of the WWTPs and were higher in southern cities than in northern cities. It was also found that there was a distinct linear correlation between the per capita mass load of ACE in influents and population density. During the treatment of WWTPs, the overall removal efficiency of artificial sweeteners ranged from -116% to 99.1%. Among the target artificial sweeteners, SUC and ACE might have potential risk to aquatic environments based on the calculation of the risk quotient. Thus, advanced treatment processes were carried to further remove SUC and ACE to reduce their long-term cumulative effect. Overall, UV/H2O2 and UV/PDS showed a better effect than granular activated carbon (GAC) adsorption in the removal of artificial sweeteners. The reaction constants of ACE by UV/H2O2 and UV/PDS were higher than those of SUC, which is related to molar extinction coefficients. Meanwhile, the adsorption ability of GAC adsorption for SUC was better than that of ACE, which is in correlation with the octanol-water partition coefficient. By comparison of removal efficiency, UV/PDS was considered as the most suitable advanced treatment process to remove ACE and SUC.",

      "abstract": "Artificial sweeteners have been developed as substitutes for sugar. Sucralose, acesulfame K (ACE K), aspartame, and saccharin are artificial sweeteners. Previously, artificial sweeteners were thought to be effective in treating obesity and diabetes. Human meta-analyses have reported that artificial sweeteners have no effect on body weight or glycemic control. However, recent studies have shown that artificial sweeteners affect glucose absorption in the intestinal tract as well as insulin and incretin secretion in humans and animals. Moreover, artificial sweeteners alter the composition of the microbiota and worsen the glycemic control owing to changes in the gut microbiota. The early intake of ACE K was also shown to suppress the taste response to sugar. Furthermore, a large cohort study showed that high artificial sweetener intake was associated with all-cause mortality, cardiovascular risk, coronary artery disease risk, cerebrovascular risk, and cancer risk. The role of artificial sweeteners in the treatment of diabetes and obesity should be reconsidered, and the replacement of sugar with artificial sweeteners in patients will require the long-term tracking of not only intake but also changes in blood glucose and weight as well as future guidance based on gut bacteria data. To utilize the beneficial properties of artificial sweeteners in treatment, further studies are needed.",

      "abstract": "Artificial sweeteners (ASs) are of growing concern as an emerging contaminant. In the study, the seasonal occurrence, removal and mass load of six ASs in sewage, suspended particulate matter (SPM) and sludge were investigated throughout the treatment process of the largest water reclamation plant in China. The highest ASs concentrations in the influent (13.0 μg/L), effluent (2.22 μg/L), SPM (4.48 μg/g) and sludge (0.15 μg/g) were observed in the dry season, which were 1.24- to 5.0-fold higher than in the normal season and 1.06- to 37.5-fold higher than the flood season. Following treatment, ASs concentrations decreased by 24.3 %, 51.7 % and 5.1 % (on average) in primary, secondary and reclaimed processes, respectively. Among the investigated ASs, acesulfame (93.1 %) and cyclamate (98.4 %) were removed most efficiently, with removal occurring mainly in secondary processes, while sucralose exhibited the lowest removal efficiency (38.7 %). Seasonal characteristics affect the consumption of ASs, which subsequently changes the input and discharge ASs loads of STPs. The maximum mass load of ASs occurred in the dry season, ranging from 0.002 (neotame) to 1.33 mg/d/person (cyclamate), while the maximum emission load occurred in the flood season, ranging from 0.003 (neotame) to 0.83 mg/d/person (sucralose). The mass and emission load of ASs in Beijing is significantly lower than in European or the United States, due to Beijing having low per capita consumption of ASs (5.50 mg/d/person). The highest ASs risk in the receiving water occurred in the flood season due to the input of other pollution sources by rainfall runoff. Meanwhile, attention should be paid to the risk of receiving water close to the STP outlet in the dry seasons for the highest ASs concentration in the STP effluent in the season. The present study provides important guidance on controlling the input and reducing the emission of ASs in different seasons.",

Targeted MS-based metabolome profiling (plasma and feces) and fecal 16S gene sequencing were conducted. Both sweeteners exhibited only minor effects on the fecal metabolome and microbiota. Saccharin treatment significantly altered amino acids, lipids, energy metabolism and specifically, bile acids in the plasma metabolome. Additionally, sex-specific differences were observed for conjugated primary and secondary bile acids. Acesulfame potassium treated male rats showed larger alterations in glycine conjugated primary and secondary bile-acids than females. Other changes in the plasma metabolome were more profound for saccharin than acesulfame potassium, for both sexes. Changes in conjugated bile-acids in plasma, which are often associated with microbiome changes, and the absence of similarly large changes in microbiota suggest an adaptative change of the latter, rather than toxicity. Further studies with a high resolution 16S sequencing data and/or metagenomics approach, with particular emphasis on bile acids, will be required to explore the mechanisms driving this metabolic outcome of saccharin in Wistar rats.",

Here we investigated four commonly used artificial sweeteners (saccharin, sucralose, aspartame, and acesulfame potassium) against both Gram-negative (Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae) and positive (Bacillus subtilis) strains. Results show that all four sweeteners exhibit antimicrobial effects on these strains. The antimicrobial mechanism is due to increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) and cell envelope damage. Compared to sucrose and glucose, the treatment of artificial sweeteners stimulates bacterial efflux pumps and promotes bacterial evolution of antibiotic tolerance. Collectively, our finding provides insights into roles of artificial sweeteners in the emergence of antibiotic tolerance and calls for a re-evaluation of risks due to their intensive usage.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Recent epidemiological cohort studies have suggested that consumption of artificial sweeteners (AS) is associated with adverse cardiovascular events and mortality. However, these population association studies cannot establish a causal relationship. In this study we investigated the effect of long-term (1-year) consumption of AS (Equal and Splenda, two commonly used AS) on cardiovascular health and survival in rats. METHODS: Adult Sprague-Dawley rats (both sexes, 4-5 months old) were randomized into the following 3 groups: control (n = 21), AS Equal (n = 21) and Splenda (n = 18). In the AS groups, Equal or Splenda was added to the drinking water (2-packets/250 ml), while drinking water alone was used in the control rats. The treatment was administered for 12 months. Cardiovascular function and survival were monitored in all animals. RESULTS: It was found that rats in the AS groups consistently consumed more sweetened water than those in the control group. AS did not affect body weight, non-fasting blood cholesterol, triglycerides, blood pressure or pulse wave velocity. There were no significant differences in left ventricular wall thicknesses, chamber dimension, cardiac function or survival. AS did not affect heart rate or atrial effective refractory period. However, rats in both Equal and Splenda groups had prolonged PR intervals (63 ± 5ms in Equal, 68 ± 6 ms in Splenda, vs 56 ± 8 ms in control, p < 0.05) and a tendency of increased atrial fibrillation inducibility. CONCLUSION: Long-term consumption of AS does not affect cardiovascular structure, function or survival but may cause some electrophysiological abnormalities with prolonged PR intervals and a tendency of increased atrial fibrillation inducibility in rats.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Nonnutritive (NNSs) are used in place of sugars to reduce caloric and glycemic intake while providing desired sweetness, commonly replacing sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) with \"diet\" (zero-calorie) alternatives. Concern has developed due to observational data associating NNSs with obesity and adiposity-based chronic disease. This counterpoint argues that, in general, NNSs used in place of added or excess sugars in the diet are likely beneficial. METHODS: A literature review was conducted on interventional trials investigating NNSs and obesity or type 2 diabetes mellitus. Key words used in the search included artificial sweeteners, nonnutritive sweeteners, saccharin, sucralose, aspartame, stevia/steviol, acesulfame potassium, meal replacements, type 2 diabetes mellitus, obesity, and weight. RESULTS: Interventional data and indirect interventional data consistently showed beneficial effects on weight and cardiometabolic health, including glycemia, when SSBs or other energy-dense foods were replaced by artificially sweetened beverages or artificially sweetened meal replacements. CONCLUSION: Although NNSs correlate with obesity and adiposity-based chronic disease, those data are fraught with confounding and error. Plausibility has been suggested on the basis of preclinical research on neuroendocrine control of appetite, satiety, and cravings plus the gut microbiome. However, interventional data reveal that replacing caloric/glycemic energy intake via NNSs creates an energy deficit resulting in weight loss and improvement in disease-especially dysglycemic disease. Intensive dietary intervention using artificially sweetened meal replacements shows a marked clinical benefit without detriment from their NNSs. Furthermore, beverages sweetened with NNSs rather than SSBs have been noted to be a critical component for those succeeding in maintaining weight loss. Although individual responses to the effects of NNSs are always warranted just like in any clinical situation, patients should not be advised to avoid NNSs in the context of dietary intervention to improve quality and energy deficit.",

We searched 4 databases for comparative studies of AS consumption (exposed) versus no consumption (nonexposed) and the odds or risk of GI luminal or non-luminal cancer (primary outcome). Estimates were pooled using a random-effects model. Studies were evaluated for quality, bias, and heterogeneity. We analyzed 8 (4 prospective, 4 case-control) studies comprising data on 1,043,496 individuals, among whom 3271 pancreatic, 395 gastric, 304 esophageal, 3008 colorectal, and 598 oropharyngeal cancers occurred. While there was no significant association between AS consumption and odds of GI cancer overall, AS consumption was associated with 19% reduced likelihood of luminal GI cancer (OR 0.81, 95% CI:0.68-0.97). There was no association between AS consumption and non-luminal GI cancer. Meta-regression demonstrated no difference in effect estimates based on study type. Based on this first meta-analysis of AS and GI cancer, we demonstrated that AS consumption is associated with a significantly lower likelihood of luminal, but not non-luminal, GI cancer.",

The release of artificial sweeteners from the use of biosolids in Australia was assessed. The concentration of seven artificial sweeteners was quantified in biosolids samples collected from 71 wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) across Australia during Census 2016. Sucralose, saccharin, acesulfame, aspartame and cyclamate were detected in biosolids samples at median concentrations ranging from 0.18 ng/g (dry weight) (range: <LOQ-34 ng/g) for cyclamate to 220 ng/g (range: <LOQ -3,670 ng/g) for sucralose, while neotame and neohesperidin dihydrochalcone were not detected. The relationship between the concentration of artificial sweeteners in biosolids and moisture content was assessed with the concentration of artificial sweeteners decreasing as dewatering time increased in a biosolids drying hall. The geometric means (± standard deviation) for per capita loads of individual artificial sweeteners ranged from 8.7 (1.6, 48) µg year-1 person-1 for cyclamate to 4,000 (1,000, 15,000) µg year-1 person-1 for sucralose with 223 kg of artificial sweeteners released to terrestrial environment from biosolids end-use annually in Australia.

Once ingested, sufficient amount of these artificial sweeteners escape unchanged from the human body and are added to the environment. However, some are added in the form of their breakdown products through excretion. Artificial sweeteners are resistant to wastewater treatment processes and are therefore continuously introduced into the water environments. However, the environmental behavior, fate, and long-term ecotoxicological contributions of artificial sweeteners in our water resources still remain largely unknown. Some artificial sweeteners like saccharin are used as a food additive in animal feeds. It also forms the degradation product of the sulfonylurea herbicides. All artificial sweeteners enter into the wastewater treatment plants from the industries and households. From the effluents, they finally reside into the receiving environmental bodies including wastewaters, groundwaters, and surface waters. The global production of these sweeteners is several hundred tons annually and is continuously being added into the environment.",

In this study, the distribution and polluted loading of six typical ASs were analyzed based on the measurement in influent, primary effluent, secondary effluent, tertiary effluent, suspended particulate matter (SPM), and sludge from four WWTPs and receiving waters near the coast of Shenzhen city, China. Elevated levels of ASs were detected in WWTPs located near a highly populated area (about 14,000 people km-2). Sucralose was predominant in all water samples (0.1-22.2 μg L-1), and had a 1.6-704.0 times higher concentration than the means of other ASs detected. Aspartame were mainly distributed in SPM and sludge, and the fractions in offshore water exceeded 45%. Acesulfame, sucralose, cyclamate and saccharin could be effectively removed by secondary biochemical treatment. The average daily loading (4.2 g d-1 1000people-1) and discharge loading (0.4 g d-1 1000people-1) of sucralose in WWTPs was higher than those of the other ASs. Dissolved organic carbon and UV254 can affect the fate of ASs, and SPM mainly affects the distributions of aspartame and neotame.

SETTING: Online databases (Medline, CINAHL, Embase, Cochrane Library, Scopus, Web of Science, FSTA - the food resource database, and ClinicalTrials.gov) were searched up to 9 April 2020. Studies of all designs (except case studies and reviews) were eligible, which contained information on the relevant population (pregnant women), intervention/exposure (any AS consumption), comparator (no AS consumption) and birth outcomes (preterm delivery, gestational age, birth weight). RESULTS: From 677 citations, ten cohort studies and one randomised controlled trial (n 138 007 women) were included. 'Low' to 'very low' certainty evidence revealed that daily consumption of AS was associated with an increased risk of preterm delivery (three studies, n 129 009; risk ratio = 1·18, 95 % CI 1·09, 1·28, I2 = 9 %), a 24 g increase in birth weight (three studies, n 64 417; mean difference (MD): 23·74 g, 95 % CI 0·89, 45·58, I2 = 0 %) and a 0·11 week decrease in gestational age (three studies, n 64 417; MD: -0·11 weeks, 95 % CI -0·19, -0·03, I2 = 0 %). CONCLUSIONS: 'Low' to 'very low' certainty evidence suggests daily AS consumption during pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of preterm delivery, increased birth weight and decreased gestational age. Additional 'high'-quality research is urgently needed to further assess these relationships.PROSPERO registration number: CRD42019136728.",

The sweeteners consumed by each participant consisted of a standardized dose of 14% (0.425 g) of the acceptable daily intake (ADI) for aspartame and 20% (0.136 g) of the ADI for sucralose. Faecal samples collected before and after treatments were analysed for microbiome and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs). There were no differences in the median relative proportions of the most abundant bacterial taxa (family and genus) before and after treatments with both NNSs. The microbiota community structure also did not show any obvious differences. There were no differences in faecal SCFAs following the consumption of the NNSs.

The results showed that SPE-HPLC can accurately determine micro acesulfame (ACE), saccharin (SAC), aspartame (ASP), and neotame (NEO) in water. The detection limits were 57, 120, 170, and 47 μg·L-1, and the quantification limits were 190, 400, 567, and 157 μg·L-1, respectively. After optimization of the solid phase extraction procedure when using PWAX columns, the recoveries of ACE and SAC were enhanced to 86.5% and 97.7%; however, it slightly decreased to 66.5% for NEO. The occurrence rates of ACE, SAC, and NEO in domestic sewage were 100.0%, and it was only 33.3% for ASP. The highest concentrations of four aforementioned artificial sweeteners in domestic sewage were 0.83, 4.52, 1.22, and 7.57 μg·L-1, respectively. The highest concentrations of acesulfame, saccharin, aspartame, and neotame in source water were 22.94, 39.17, 0.73, and 8.92 μg·L-1, respectively, and detection rates were 72.7%, 90.9%, 18.2%, and 90.9%, respectively. Most artificial sweeteners were removed by the prozone process; the removal efficiencies of ACE, SAC, and NEO ranged from 67.7% to 100.0%, and the removal efficiencies of ACE, SAC, and NEO by the advanced treatment process ranged from 73.7% to 100.0%, which effectively reduced the risk of drinking water quality. The four artificial sweeteners were not detected in the water supply network."

A triple quadrupole mass spectrometer and an electrospray ionization source (ESI-MS) run in negative ionization and multiple reaction monitoring modes were employed for instrumental analysis. The TF-SPME method was optimized for the extraction phase, sample pH, desorption solvent, extraction time, and desorption time. In-house-synthetized-hydrophilic-lipophilic balance weak anion exchange (HLB-WAX) particles imbedded within a polyacrylonitrile (PAN) binder were selected as the extraction phase for the thin-film coating due to their cost-effectiveness and enhanced sensitivity for artificial sweeteners. Suitable analytical parameters that include linearity (R2 > 0.9914), recovery > 80%, inter, and intra-reproducibility less than 18% were obtained for the AS compounds studied. The developed method estimated limits of detection (LODs) ranging from 0.004 to 0.038 ng mL-1 The SPME method was successfully applied for the determination of ultra-trace levels of AS in water samples collected from Grand River (Ontario, Canada), downstream of three municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). Concentrations ranging from 0.03 to 20.3 ng mL-1 were found for the AS compounds studied."

      "abstract": "The human gut is inhabited by several hundred different bacterial species. These bacteria are closely associated with our health and well-being. The composition of these diverse commensals is influenced by our dietary intakes. Non-caloric artificial sweeteners (NAS) have gained global popularity, particularly among diabetic patients, due to their perceived health benefits, such as reduction of body weight and maintenance of blood glucose level compared to caloric sugars. Recent studies have reported that these artificial sweeteners can alter the composition of gut microbiota and, thus, affect our normal physiological state. Here, we investigated the effect of aspartame and acesulfame potassium (ace-K), two popular NAS, in a commercial formulation on the growth and metabolic pathways of omnipresent gut commensal Escherichia coliby analyzing the relative expression levels of the key genes, which control over twenty important metabolic pathways. Treatment with NAS preparation (aspartame and ace-K) modulates the growth of E. colias well as inducing the expression of important metabolic genes associated with glucose (pfkA, sucA, aceE, pfkB, lpdA), nucleotide (tmk, adk, tdk, thyA), and fatty acid (fabI) metabolisms, among others. Several of the affected geneswere previously reported to be important for the colonization of the microbes in the gut. These findings may shed light on the mechanism of alteration of gut microbes and their metabolism by NAS.",

Healthy participants consumed pure forms of a non-nutritive sweetener (NNS) that were mixed with water and standardized to doses of 14% (0.425 g) of the acceptable daily intake (ADI) for aspartame and 20% (0.136 g) of the ADI for sucralose every day for 2 weeks. Blood samples were collected and analyzed for glucose, insulin, active glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), and leptin. Seventeen participants (10 females and 7 males; age, 24 ± 6.8 years; body mass index, 22.9 ± 2.5 kg/m2) participated in the study. The total area under the curve values of glucose, insulin, active GLP-1 and leptin were similar for the aspartame and sucralose treatment groups compared with the baseline values in healthy participants. There was no change in insulin sensitivity after NNS treatment compared with the baseline values. These findings suggest that daily repeated consumption of pure sucralose or aspartame for 2 weeks had no effect on glucose metabolism among normoglycaemic adults. However, these results need to be tested in studies with longer durations. Novelty Daily consumption of pure aspartame or sucralose for 2 weeks had no effect on glucose metabolism. Daily consumption of pure aspartame or sucralose for 2 weeks had no effect on insulin sensitivity among healthy adults.",

The target emerging contaminants included eight pharmaceuticals (carbamazepine, caffeine, sulfamethoxazole, 3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine, 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine, ibuprofen, gemfibrozil, and naproxen), four artificial sweeteners (acesulfame-K, sucralose, saccharin, and cyclamate), and two perfluoroalkyl substances (perfluorooctanoic acid and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid). The samples for target contaminant analysis were collected from the influent, effluent, and profile (along the flow direction) ports of each column. The removal data (concentration vs. residence time) for each target contaminant were fitted to the first-order (exponential decay equation) or zero-order (linear equation) model using SigmaPlot. The removal rate, removal rate constant (k obs ), mass normalized rate constant (k M ), surface area normalized rate constant (k SA , specific reaction rate constant), and half-life (t 0.5 ) of target contaminants in Columns ZVI, BC, and (ZVI + BC) were calculated and summarized in this dataset."

The ultraviolet/persulfate (UV/PS) advanced oxidation process has been proven to remove ASs in real wastewater effectively. In this study, radical-based degradation kinetic model, pathways and toxicity evaluation of ASs by UV/PS process were explored. ACE and SUC were effectively removed by UV/PS process, and UV photolysis, hydroxyl radicals (HO∙) and sulfate radicals (SO4∙-) contributes the degradation of ASs. A kinetic prediction model for ASs degradation was established based on the second-order rate constants with HO∙ and SO4∙-, and the steady state concentrations of HO∙ and SO4∙- were calculated through the degradations of two reference compounds. The kinetic model could predict the degradation process of ASs in five real wastewaters effluents. Furthermore, two models based on the kinetic and the water matrices parameters for ASs degradation in wastewater were compared. Finally, the tentative pathways of ASs degradations by UV/PS were proposed. Also, toxicity evaluation showed that ASs after UV/PS treatment enhanced the toxicity on C. carpio liver, and prolongation of treatment time and recovery in fresh water can reduce the toxicity on C. carpio.",

Advanced oxidation processes are among the most effective methods for removing emerging contaminants from water; however, high energy consumption greatly increases the operating costs and limits large-scale applications. In this study, a passive treatment system consisting of four columns packed with mixtures of silica sand, zero-valent iron (ZVI), biochar (BC), and a mixture of (ZVI + BC) were evaluated for simultaneous removal of eight pharmaceuticals, four artificial sweeteners, and two perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) from water. Overall, the passive treatment system was more effective for removing target pharmaceuticals (almost complete removal) than artificial sweeteners and PFASs (partial removal). Columns ZVI, BC, and (ZVI + BC) exhibited similarly effective removal (>97%) of target pharmaceuticals, including carbamazepine, caffeine, sulfamethoxazole, 3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine, 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine, ibuprofen, gemfibrozil, and naproxen, from ~9 to <0.25 μg L-1; pharmaceuticals were more rapidly removed by Columns ZVI and (ZVI + BC) than Column BC, except for ibuprofen. Column ZVI was more effective for removing artificial sweeteners acesulfame-K and sucralose than Columns BC and (ZVI + BC); however, BC exhibited relatively greater removal of saccharin than ZVI and (ZVI + BC). Acesulfame-K and saccharin (~110 μg L-1) were partially removed in the treatment columns. Cyclamate was not removed in any of the columns. However, >76% of input sucralose (~110 μg L-1) was removed in the three treatment columns. Reactive medium BC alone was more effective for removing target PFASs than ZVI and (ZVI + BC). Input perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) (~45 μg L-1) was partially removed in the columns containing BC but not ZVI alone. Between 10 and 80% of input perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) (24 ̶ 90 μg L-1) was removed in Column ZVI; greater removals (57 ̶ 99%) were observed in Columns BC and (ZVI + BC).",

While the impacts of artificial sweeteners on energy balance remain controversial, this work aimed to evaluate the protective effects in mice of a low digestible carbohydrate (LDC) diet on plasma glucose, plasma fasting insulin, sweet taste receptors, glucose transporters, and absorption of carbohydrates, together with consumption of acesulfame potassium (AK) or saccharin (SAC). RESULTS: Artificial sweetener was administered to mice for 12 weeks to induce glucose metabolism disorders; mice were treated with an LDC diet for the final 6 weeks. The experimental groups were treated with an LDC diet that had the same energy as the normal-diet group. Prolonged administration of artificial sweeteners led to metabolic dysfunction, characterized by significantly increased plasma glucose, insulin resistance, sweet taste receptors, glucose transporters, and absorption of carbohydrates. Treatment with an LDC diet positively modulated these altered parameters, suggesting overall beneficial effects of an LDC diet on detrimental changes associated with artificial sweeteners. CONCLUSIONS: Reducing digestible carbohydrates in the diet can significantly reduce the absorption of carbohydrates and improve glucose metabolism disorders caused by dietary factors. These effects may be due to the fact that reducing the amount of digestible carbohydrates in the feed can reduce the number of intestinal sweet receptors induced by exposure to artificial sweeteners. © 2019 Society of Chemical Industry.",

      "abstract": "The detection of wastewater impact on stream chemistry is often hindered by high background concentrations of ubiquitous solutes. In the present study we tested the applicability of artificial sweeteners (AS) and iodinated X-ray contrast media (ICM) as tracers to detect this impact by examining wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluents and surface water samples. The developed direct injection LC-MS/MS method enabled the detection of these anthropogenic micropollutants in aqueous samples down to trace level concentrations. The 2-h-composite sampling of WWTP effluent revealed fluctuating ICM concentrations between and within days with highest concentrations at the end of the week. Diatrizoic acid (DTZ) and iopromide (IOP) were the predominant ICM with concentrations up to 7 μg/L. Concentrations of the AS acesulfame (ACE) fluctuated between 0.5 μg/L and 1 μg/L. Concentrations of AS and ICM in surface water were both associated with wastewater impact. DTZ contamination was more widespread whereas some sampling points exhibited a more pronounced contamination with non-ionic ICM. Surface water was frequently contaminated with AS. Particularly ACE was detected in every surface water sample indicating that it is chemically stable and that inputs to the aquatic environment via WWTP effluents are widespread. The broad application of ACE as food additive enables its application as a tracer throughout Germany. Furthermore, the developed LC-MS/MS method enables rapid detection of ACE down to the low ng/L-range. Nonetheless, DTZ or IOP could be used in addition to ACE to verify anthropogenic influences on natural waters.",

Comparisons between ACE removal in a full-scale WWTP and in lab-scale SBRs were conducted. Results showed that CYC and SAC were completely removed, whereas SUC was persistent. However, ACE removal in lab-scale SBRs was significantly greater than in the full-scale WWTP. In SBRs, chemical oxygen demand (COD), ammonia nitrogen (NH4+-N) and total nitrogen (TN) removal appeared unchanged after adding ASWs (p > 0.05). Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) concentrations and triphenyl tetrazolium chloride-dehydrogenase activity (TTC-DHA) declined significantly (p < 0.05). The mixed ASWs had more evident effects than the individual ASWs. Microbial community analyses revealed that Proteobacteria decreased obviously, while Bacteroidetes, Chloroflexi and Actinobacteria were enriched with the addition of ASWs.

However, in rural areas, the extent to which septic systems contribute these same compounds to groundwater aquifers is largely unknown. We examined the occurrence of four commonly used artificial sweeteners in an unconfined sand aquifer that serves as a water supply for rural residents, as a receptor of domestic wastewater from septic systems, and as a source of baseflow to the Nottawasaga River, ON, Canada. Groundwater from the Lake Algonquin Sand Aquifer in the southern Nottawasaga River Watershed was collected from private domestic wells and as groundwater seeps discharging along the banks of the Nottawasaga River. Approximately 30% of samples had detectable levels of one or more artificial sweeteners, indicating the presence of water derived from septic system effluent. Using acesulfame concentrations to estimate the fraction of septic effluent in groundwater samples, ∼3.4 to 13.6% of the domestic wells had 1% or more of their well water being derived from septic system effluent. Similarly, 2.0 to 4.7% of the groundwater seeps had a septic effluent contribution of 1% or more. No relationship was found between the concentration of acesulfame and the concentration of nitrate, ammonium, or soluble reactive phosphorus in the groundwater, indicating that septic effluent is not the dominant source of nutrients in the aquifer. It is expected that the occurrence of artificial sweeteners in shallow groundwater is widespread throughout rural areas in Canada.",

All four ASs (acesulfame (ACE), sucralose (SUC), cyclamate (CYC) and saccharin (SAC)) were detected, ranging from 0.43 to 27.34μg/L in the influent. Higher concentrations of ASs were measured in winter. ACE could be partly removed by 7.11-50.76% through biodegradation and especially through the denitrifying process. The A2/O process was the most efficient at biodegrading ASs. Adsorption (by granular activated carbon (GAC) and magnetic resin) and ultraviolet radiation-based advanced oxidation processes (UV/AOPs) were evaluated to remove ASs in laboratory-scale tests. The amounts of resin adsorbed were 3.33-18.51 times more than those of GAC except for SUC. The adsorption ability of resin decreased in the order of SAC > ACE > CYC > SUC in accordance with the pKa. Degradation of ASs followed pseudo-first-order kinetics in UV/H2O2 and UV/PDS. When applied to the secondary effluent, ASs could be degraded from 30.87 to 99.93% using UV/PDS in 30 minutes and UV/PDS was more efficient and economic.",

      "abstract": "Pig farm is an important potential source for artificial sweeteners (ASs) in the environment due to their wide use as additives in pig feed. The objective of this study was to evaluate the fate of typical ASs in pig farm and neighboring farmland. For this purpose, the levels of four typical artificial ASs, i.e. saccharin (SAC), cyclamate (CYC), acesulfame (ACE) and sucralose (SUC), in pig feed and manure from a pig farm and water samples from an on-farm wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) in Tianjin, China were measured and the mass loadings and removal efficiencies were assessed. Moreover, the levels of ASs in different layers of soil and vegetables in neighboring farmland that received manure fertilizers and wastewater from the farm were consecutively monitored for 60-80days. The SAC, CYC and ACE were widely determined in all kinds of the samples, while SUC was only found in few soil samples. The mass loadings of the ASs in pig feed were estimated up to 311kg/year for SAC, 59.1kg/year for CYC, and 17.1kg/year for ACE, respectively. The fractions of the total mass of ASs excreted via manure were estimated to be 36.0% for SAC, 59.4% for CYC, and 36.7% for ACE as compared to those in pig feed. High removal efficiencies (>90%) of ASs in the on-farm WWTP was achieved. In greenhouse soils, CYC, SAC, ACE, and SUC were degraded quickly, with half-lives of 4.3-5.9 d, 2.7-4.2 d, 8.4-12.3 d, and 7.3-10.8 d, respectively. Lower levels of ASs were found in deeper soil layer (20-30cm). The ASs were considerably absorbed by plants when the ASs' concentrations were high in soil. This study presents the first comprehensive overview of ASs fate from a pig farm to the neighboring agricultural ecosystem.",

      "abstract": "One of the main risks associated with effluents from both wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) and on-site sewage treatment facilities (OSSFs) is the release of micropollutants (MPs) in receiving water bodies. However, the impact of MPs present in the effluents of OSSFs in the aquatic environment has not been studied so far. The current study evaluates the impact of the effluents of OSSFs and small-to-large scale WWTPs on natural waters. The discharge of 74 MPs was assessed including pharmaceuticals, personal care products, pesticides, artificial sweeteners and perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs). The sampling was carried out within a Swedish catchment and included three sites that are exclusively affected by OSSFs and other sites that are mainly affected by WWTPs or a mixture of sources (7 sites, 28 samples). Results show that although OSSFs serve a much smaller total number of people, the MPs emitted from OSSFs reached the aquatic environment in significant quantities (concentrations of >150ngL-1 of ∑MPs). The composition profiles for sites affected by WWTPs were similar and were dominated by sucralose (27% of the ∑MPs), caffeine (27% of the ∑MPs), lamotrigine (10% of the ∑MPs), desvenlafaxine (5% of the ∑MPs), and diclofenac (4% of the ∑MPs). In contrast, the sites affected by OSSFs showed high variability, exhibiting a different profile from those affected by WWTPs and also from each other, demonstrating that OSSFs are not homogeneous sources of MPs. Some specific compounds, such as diethyltoluamide (DEET) and caffeine, were proportionally much more important at sites affected by OSSFs than at sites affected by WWTPs (representing a much higher percentage of the ∑MPs in the OSSFs). In contrast, PFASs did not show high concentration variation among the different sampling sites and the composition profiles were relatively similar, indicating that these substances follow different routes of entry into the aquatic environment."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Processed foods are part of daily life. Almost all processed foods contain food additives such as sweeteners, preservatives and colourants. From childhood, it is difficult to avoid consuming food additives. It is thought that oral tolerance for food antigens is acquired during early life. If tolerance fails, adverse immune responses to food proteins may occur. OBJECTIVE: We hypothesized that food additives prevent acquisition of oral tolerance and aimed to verify the safety of food additives. METHODS: We induced experimental oral tolerance in mice for ovalbumin (OVA), a food antigen, by previous oral treatment with OVA before sensitization with OVA injections. Food additives were administered at the induction of oral tolerance, and food allergy was induced by repeated administration of OVA. Symptoms of food allergy were defined as a change in body temperature and allergic diarrhoea. RESULTS: Saccharin sodium and a mixture of food additives inhibited acquisition of oral tolerance. Hypothermia and allergic diarrhoea with elevation of OVA-specific IgE were induced in the murine model of oral tolerance. Analyses of antigen-presenting cells in mesenteric lymph nodes showed that food additives affected their manner of migration. Additionally, food additives decreased the proportion of CD25hi regulatory T cells among CD4+ T cells in the mesenteric lymph nodes. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: A large amount of food additives may prevent acquisition of oral tolerance. Intake of food additives in early life may increase the risk of food allergies.",

      "abstract": "Wastewater indicator is a useful tool for evaluating the wastewater impact on natural water, but there is little information about the suitability of wastewater indicators for different regions. This study aimed to select suitable wastewater indicators in the Pearl River Delta region, south China by screening a range of wastewater related organic compounds. The screening campaign was carried out by investigating the occurrence and removal efficiencies of 93 pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) and 5 artificial sweeteners (ASs) in nine wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) located in the region, and the occurrence of these target compounds in the contaminated and clean surface water of the Pearl River. An ideal wastewater indicator should be hydrophilic, source-specific for domestic wastewater, ubiquitous in contaminated surface water with detection frequency (DF) >80% and absent in background water samples. For liable indicators, high removal rates (>90%) should be observed in WWTPs and they should be detected in all the influent samples at concentrations fifty times higher than their limits of quantification. For conservative indicators, low removal rates (<50%) should be observed in WWTPs and they should be detected in all the effluent samples at concentrations fifty times higher than their limits of quantification. Based on the above criteria, sucralose and fluconazole were selected as conservative indicators in the region, while cyclamate, saccharin, methyl paraben, ethyl paraben, propyl paraben, paracetamol, salicylic acid and caffeine were selected as liable indicators."

      "abstract": "We studied the direct and indirect photochemical reactivity of artificial sweeteners acesulfame, saccharin, cyclamic acid and sucralose in environm entally relevant dilute aqueous solutions. Aqueous solutions of sweeteners were irradiated with simulated solar radiation (>290 nm; 96 and 168 h) or ultraviolet radiation (UVR; up to 24 h) for assessing photochemical reactions in surface waters or in water treatment, respectively. The sweeteners were dissolved in deionised water for examination of direct photochemical reactions. Direct photochemical reactions degraded all sweeteners under UVR but only acesulfame under simulated solar radiation. Acesulfame was degraded over three orders of magnitude faster than the other sweeteners. For examining indirect photochemical reactions, the sweeteners were dissolved in surface waters with indigenous dissolved organic matter or irradiated with aqueous solutions of nitrate (1 mg N/L) and ferric iron (2.8 mg Fe/L) introduced as sensitizers. Iron enhanced the photodegradation rates but nitrate and dissolved organic matter did not. UVR transformed acesulfame into at least three products: iso-acesulfame, hydroxylated acesulfame and hydroxypropanyl sulfate. Photolytic half-life was one year for acesulfame and more than several years for the other sweeteners in surface waters under solar radiation. Our study shows that the photochemical reactivity of commonly used artificial sweeteners is variable: acesulfame may be sensitive to photodegradation in surface waters, while saccharin, cyclamic acid and sucralose degrade very slowly even under the energetic UVR commonly used in water treatment.",

This study utilized pilot-scale conventional and biological drinking water treatment processes to assess the removal of nine PhACs and EDCs, and two artificial sweeteners. Conventional treatment (coagulation, flocculation, settling, non-biological dual-media filtration) was compared to biofilters with or without the addition of in-line coagulant (0.2-0.8 mg Al(3+)/L; alum or PACl). A combination of biofiltration, with or without in-line alum, and conventional filtration was able to reduce 7 of the 9 PhACs and EDCs by more than 50% from river water while artificial sweeteners were inconsistently removed by conventional treatment or biofiltration. Increasing doses of PACl from 0 to 0.8 mg/L resulted in average removals of PhACs, EDCs increasing from 39 to 70% and artificial sweeteners removal increasing from ~15% to ~35% in lake water. These results suggest that a combination of biological, chemical and physical treatment can be applied to effectively reduce the concentration of EDCs, PhACs, and artificial sweeteners.",

This study investigated the fate of ASs in both the aqueous and solid phases in a water reclamation plant (WRP). All the four targeted ASs, i.e. acesulfame (ACE), sucralose (SUC), cyclamate (CYC) and saccharine (SAC), were detected in both the aqueous and solid phases of raw influent and primary effluent samples. The concentrations of CYC and SAC in secondary effluent or MBR permeate were below their method detection limits. ACE and SUC were persistent throughout the WRP, whereas CYC and SAC were completely removed in biological treatment (>99%). Experimental results showed that sorption played a minor role in the elimination of the ASs due to the relatively low sorption coefficients (Kd), where Kd<500L/kg. In particular, the poor removal of ACE and SUC in the WRP may be attributed to their physiochemical properties (i.e. logKow<0 or logD<3.2) and chemical structures containing strong withdrawing electron functional groups in heterocyclic rings (i.e. chloride and sulfonate).",

High concentrations (low micrograms per liter) of ASs, including aspartame, saccharin, and sucralose, were found in wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) influents from Vietnam. Three ICMs, iohexol, iopamidol, and iopromide were detected in Vietnamese WWTP influents and effluents, suggesting that these ICMs are frequently used in Vietnam. ASs and ICMs were found in river water from downtown Hanoi at concentrations comparable to or lower than the concentrations in WWTP influents. The ASs and ICMs concentrations in WWTP influents and adjacent surface water significantly correlated (r (2) = 0.99, p < 0.001), suggesting that household wastewater is discharged directly into rivers in Vietnam. Acesulfame was frequently detected in northern Vietnamese groundwater, but the concentrations varied spatially by one order of magnitude even though the sampling points were very close together. This implies that poorly performing domestic septic tanks sporadically leak household wastewater into groundwater. High acesulfame, cyclamate, saccharin, and sucralose concentrations were found in surface water from Manila, The Philippines. The sucralose concentrations were one order of magnitude higher in the Manila samples than in the Vietnamese samples, indicating that more sucralose is used in The Philippines than in Vietnam. Acesulfame and cyclamate were found in surface water from Pathein (rural) and Yangon (urban) in Myanmar, but no ICMs were found in the samples. The ASs concentrations were two-three orders of magnitude lower in the samples from Myanmar than in the samples from Vietnam and The Philippines, suggesting that different amounts of ASs are used in these countries. We believe this is the first report of persistent ASs and ICMs having ubiquitous distributions in economically emerging South Asian countries.",

In the present study, a method is developed for the determination of a group of artificial sweeteners in environmental waters. Considering the polar and hydrophilic character of these compounds, hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography is proposed for their separation as an alternative to traditional reversed-phase liquid chromatography. Two stationary phases with different chemistry were compared for this purpose. For the detection of the analytes, high-resolution mass spectrometry (Orbitrap) was employed to take advantage of its benefits in terms of reliable quantification and confirmation for the measurement of accurate masses. Solid-phase extraction was chosen as the sample treatment, in which the extract in a mixture of NH4OH:MeOH:ACN (1:4:15) was directly injected into the chromatographic system, simplifying the analytical procedure. The optimized method was validated on river and waste water samples. For example, in the case of effluent water samples, limits of detection ranged from 0.002 to 0.7 μg/L and limits of quantification ranged from 0.004 to 1.5 μg/L. Apparent (whole method) recoveries ranged from 57 to 74% with intra-day precision (%RSD, n = 5) ranging from 6 to 25%. The method was successfully applied to water samples from different rivers in Catalonia and different waste water treatment plants in Tarragona.

In this study, mass loadings, removal efficiencies, and environmental emission of sucralose, saccharin, aspartame, and acesulfame were determined based on the concentrations measured in wastewater influent, primary effluent, effluent, suspended particulate matter (SPM), and sludge collected from two WWTPs in the Albany area of New York State, U.S.A. All ASWs were detected at a mean concentration that ranged from 0.13 (aspartame) to 29.4 μg/L (sucralose) in wastewater influent, 0.49 (aspartame) to 27.7 μg/L (sucralose) in primary influent, 0.11 (aspartame) to 29.6 μg/L (sucralose) in effluent, and from 0.08 (aspartame) to 0.65 μg/g dw (sucralose) in sludge. Aspartame was found in 92% of influent SPM samples at a mean concentration of 444 ng/g dw, followed by acesulfame (92 ng/g) and saccharin (49 ng/g). The fraction of the total mass of ASWs sorbed to SPM was in the rank order: aspartame (50.4%) > acesulfame (10.9%) > saccharin and sucralose (0.8%). The sorption coefficients of ASWs ranged from 4.10 (saccharin) to 4540 L/kg (aspartame). Significant removal of aspartame (68.2%) and saccharin (90.3%) was found in WWTPs; however, sucralose and acesulfame were less efficiently removed (<2.0%). The total mass loading of sucralose, saccharin, and acesulfame in the WWTP that served a smaller population (∼15,000) was 1.3-1.5 times lower than that in another WWTP that served a larger population (∼100,000). The average daily loading of sucralose in both WWTPs (18.5 g/d/1000 people) was ∼2 times higher than the average loading of saccharin. The daily discharge of sucralose from the WWTPs was the highest (17.6 g/d/1000 people), followed by acesulfame (1.22 g/d/1000 people), and saccharin (1.07 g/d/1000 people). Approximately, 1180 g of saccharin and 291 g of acesulfame were transformed in or removed daily from the two WWTPs.

NAS consumption is considered safe and beneficial owing to their low caloric content, yet supporting scientific data remain sparse and controversial. Here we demonstrate that consumption of commonly used NAS formulations drives the development of glucose intolerance through induction of compositional and functional alterations to the intestinal microbiota. These NAS-mediated deleterious metabolic effects are abrogated by antibiotic treatment, and are fully transferrable to germ-free mice upon faecal transplantation of microbiota configurations from NAS-consuming mice, or of microbiota anaerobically incubated in the presence of NAS. We identify NAS-altered microbial metabolic pathways that are linked to host susceptibility to metabolic disease, and demonstrate similar NAS-induced dysbiosis and glucose intolerance in healthy human subjects. Collectively, our results link NAS consumption, dysbiosis and metabolic abnormalities, thereby calling for a reassessment of massive NAS usage.",

The ASs were widely detected in Chinese atmospheric dry deposition and soil samples, at concentrations up to 6450 and 1280 ng/g, respectively. To give a picture on AS distribution and source in the whole environment, the concentrations and seasonal variations of ASs in Tianjin were studied, including atmosphere, soil, and water samples. The AS levels were significantly higher in Haihe river at TJW (a sampling site in central city) in winter, while no obviously seasonal trends were obtained at BYL (close to a AS factory) and the site at a wastewater treatment plant. Saccharin, cyclamate, and acesulfame were the dominant ASs in both gas and particulate phase, with concentrations varying from 0.02 to 1940 pg/m(3). Generally, gas phase concentrations of the ASs were relatively higher in summer, while opposite results were acquired for particulate phase. Wet and dry deposition fluxes were calculated based on the measured AS levels. The results indicated that both wet and dry deposition could efficiently remove ASs in the atmosphere and act as important pollutant sources for the ASs in surface environment.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: There is a lack of appetite studies in free-living subjects supplying the habitual diet with either sucrose or artificially sweetened beverages and foods. Furthermore, the focus of artificial sweeteners has only been on the energy intake (EI) side of the energy-balance equation. The data are from a subgroup from a 10-wk study, which was previously published. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to investigate changes in EI and energy expenditure (EE) as possible reasons for the changes in body weight during 10 wk of supplementation of either sucrose or artificial sweeteners in overweight subjects. DESIGN: Supplements of sucrose-sweetened beverages and foods (2 g/kg body weight; n = 12) or similar amounts containing artificial sweeteners (n = 10) were given single-blind in a 10-wk parallel design. Beverages accounted for 80% and solid foods for 20% by weight of the supplements. The rest of the diet was free choice. Indirect 24-h whole-body calorimetry was performed at weeks 0 and 10. At week 0 the diet was a weight-maintaining standardized diet. At week 10 the diet consisted of the supplements and ad libitum choice of foods. Visual analog scales were used to record appetite. RESULTS: Body weight increased in the sucrose group and decreased in the sweetener group during the intervention. The sucrose group had a 3.3-MJ higher EI but felt less full and had higher ratings of prospective food consumption than did the sweetener group at week 10. Basal metabolic rate was increased in the sucrose group, whereas 24-h EE was increased in both groups at week 10. Energy balance in the sucrose group was more positive than in the sweetener group at the stay at week 10. CONCLUSION: The changes in body weight in the 2 groups during the 10-wk intervention seem to be attributable to changes in EI rather than to changes in EE.",

The data for this study are drawn from a nationwide survey of ASWs in sewage sludge from 40 representative wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) that receive domestic (WWTPD), industrial (WWTPI), or mixed (domestic plus industrial; WWTPM) wastewaters in Korea. Five ASWs (concentrations ranged from 7.08 to 5220 ng/g dry weight [dw]) and ten PPCPs (4.95-6930 ng/g dw) were determined in sludge. Aspartame (concentrations ranged from 28.4 to 5220 ng/g dw) was determined for the first time in sewage sludge. The median concentrations of ASWs and PPCPs in sludge from domestic WWTPs were 0.8-2.5 and 1.0-3.4 times, respectively, the concentrations found in WWTPs that receive combined domestic and industrial wastewaters. Among the five ASWs analyzed, the median environmental emission rates of aspartame through domestic WWTPs (both sludge and effluent discharges combined) were calculated to be 417 μg/capita/day, followed by sucralose (117 μg/capita/day), acesulfame (90 μg/capita/day), and saccharin (66μg/capita/day). The per-capita emission rates of select PPCPs, such as antimicrobials (triclocarban: 158 μg/capita/day) and analgesics (acetaminophen: 59 μg/capita/day), were an order of magnitude higher than those calculated for antimycotic (miconazole) and anthelmintic (thiabendazole) drugs analyzed in this study. Multiple linear regression analysis of measured concentrations of ASWs and PPCPs in sludge revealed that several WWTP parameters, such as treatment capacity, population-served, sludge production rate, and hydraulic retention time could influence the concentrations found in sludge.",

Conventional dialysis uses a membrane dialysis tube approximately 15 cm in length and is carried out over many hours owing to the small membrane area and owing to inefficient mixing. In particular, processed cereal products such as cookies required treatment for 48 hours to obtain satisfactory recovery of the compounds. By increasing the tube length to 55 cm and introducing efficient mixing by inversion at half-hour intervals, the dialysis times of the four artificial sweeteners, spiked at 0.1 g/kg in the cookie, were shortened to 4 hours. Recovery yields of 88.9-103.2% were obtained by using the improved method, whereas recovery yields were low (65.5-82.0%) by the conventional method. Recovery yields (%) of Sa, AK, APM, and Du, spiked at 0.1 g/kg in various foods, were 91.6-100.1, 93.9-100.1, 86.7-100.0 and 88.7-104.7 using the improved method.",

The method was validated for surface, ground, and drinking water samples. In order to gain higher sensitivities, a 10-fold sample enrichment step using a Genevac EZ-2 plus centrifugal vacuum evaporator that provided excellent recoveries (90 ± 6 %) was selected for sample preparation. Limits of quantification below 10 ng/L were obtained for all compounds. Furthermore, sample preparation recoveries and matrix effects were investigated thoroughly for all matrix types. Considerable matrix effects were observed in surface water and could be compensated by the use of four stable isotope-labeled internal standards. Due to their persistence, fractions of diatrizoic acid, iopamidol, and acesulfame could pass the whole drinking water production process and were observed also in drinking water. To monitor the fate and occurrence of these compounds, the validated method was applied to samples from different stages of the drinking water production process of the Industrial Works of Basel (IWB). Diatrizoic acid was found as the most persistent compound which was eliminated by just 40 % during the whole drinking water treatment process, followed by iopamidol (80 % elimination) and acesulfame (85 % elimination). All other compounds were completely restrained and/or degraded by the soil and thus were not detected in groundwater. Additionally, a direct injection method without sample preparation achieving 3-20 ng/L limits of quantification was compared to the developed method.",

      "abstract": "Artificial sweeteners have been widely incorporated in human food products for aid in weight loss regimes, dental health protection and dietary control of diabetes. Some of these widely used compounds can pass non-degraded through wastewater treatment systems and are subsequently discharged to groundwater and surface waters. Measurements of artificial sweeteners in rivers used for drinking water production are scarce. In order to determine the riverine concentrations of artificial sweeteners and their usefulness as a tracer of wastewater at the scale of an entire watershed, we analyzed samples from 23 sites along the entire length of the Grand River, a large river in Southern Ontario, Canada, that is impacted by agricultural activities and urban centres. Municipal water from household taps was also sampled from several cities within the Grand River Watershed. Cyclamate, saccharin, sucralose, and acesulfame were found in elevated concentrations despite high rates of biological activity, large daily cycles in dissolved oxygen and shallow river depth. The maximum concentrations that we measured for sucralose (21 µg/L), cyclamate (2.4 µg/L) [corrected], and saccharin (7.2 µg/L) are the highest reported concentrations of these compounds in surface waters to date anywhere in the world. Acesulfame persists at concentrations that are up to several orders of magnitude above the detection limit over a distance of 300 km and it behaves conservatively in the river, recording the wastewater contribution from the cumulative population in the basin. Acesulfame is a reliable wastewater effluent tracer in rivers. Furthermore, it can be used to assess rates of nutrient assimilation, track wastewater plume dilution, separate human and animal waste contributions and determine the relative persistence of emerging contaminants in impacted watersheds where multiple sources confound the usefulness of other tracers. The effects of artificial sweeteners on aquatic biota in rivers and in the downstream Great Lakes are largely unknown.",

      "abstract": "While having a long tradition as safe food additives, artificial sweeteners are a newly recognized class of environmental contaminants due to their extreme persistence and ubiquitous occurrence in various aquatic ecosystems. Resistant to wastewater treatment processes, they are continuously introduced into the water environments. To date however, their environmental behavior, fate as well as long term ecotoxicological contributions in our water resources still remain largely unknown. As a first step in the comprehensive study of artificial sweeteners, this work elucidates the geographical/seasonal/hydrological interactions of acesulfame, cyclamate, saccharin and sucralose in an open coast system at an estuarine/marine junction. Higher occurrence of acesulfame (seasonal average: 0.22 μg L(-1)) and sucralose (0.05 μg L(-1)) was found in summer while saccharin (0.11  μg L(-1)) and cyclamate (0.10 μg L(-1)) were predominantly detected in winter. Seasonal observations of the four sweeteners suggest strong connections with the variable chemical resistance among different sweeteners. Our photodegradation investigation further projected the potential impact of persistent acesulfame and sucralose compounds under prolonged exposure to intensive solar irradiation. Real-time observation by UPLC-ESI/MS of the degradation profile in both sweeteners illustrated that formation of new photo by-products under prolonged UV irradiation is highly viable. Interestingly, two groups of kinetically behaved photodegradates were identified for acesulfame, one of which was at least six times more persistent than the parent compound. For the first time, acute toxicity for the degradates of both sweeteners were arbitrarily measured, revealing photo-enhancement factors of 575 and 17.1 for acesulfame and sucralose, respectively. Direct comparison of photodegradation results suggests that the phototoxicity of acesulfame degradation products may impact aquatic ecosystems. In an attempt to neutralize this prolonged environmental threat, the feasibility of UV/TiO2 as an effective mineralization process in wastewater treatment was evaluated for both sweeteners. Under an environmental and technical relevant condition, a >84% removal rate recorded within 30 min and complete photomineralization was achieved within 2 h and delivering the best cost efficiency comparing to existing removal methods. A compilation of distribution, degradation, toxicity and attenuation results presented in this paper will go through critical discussions to explore some current issues and to pinpoint solutions for a better control in the emergent contamination of artificial sweeteners.",

The procedure is based on pressurised liquid extraction (PLE) with water followed by solid-phase extraction (SPE) and subsequent liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis. After optimisation of the different PLE parameters, extraction with aqueous 500mM formate buffer (pH 3.5) at 80°C during a single static cycle of 21min proved to be best conditions. After a subsequent SPE, quantification limits, referred to dry weight (dw) of sewage sludge, ranged from 0.3ng/g for acesulfame (ACE) to 16ng/g for saccharin (SAC) and neohespiridine dihydrochalcone. The trueness, expressed as recovery, ranged between 72% and 105% and the precision, expressed as relative standard deviation, was lower than 16%. Moreover, the method proved its linearity up to the 2μg/g range. Finally, the described method was applied to the determination of the artificial sweeteners in primary and secondary sewage sludge from urban wastewater treatment plants. Four of the six studied artificial sweeteners (ACE, cyclamate, SAC and sucralose) were found in the samples at concentrations ranging from 17 to 628ng/g dw.",

      "abstract": "G protein-coupled receptors mediate responses to a myriad of ligands, some of which regulate adipocyte differentiation and metabolism. The sweet taste receptors T1R2 and T1R3 are G protein-coupled receptors that function as carbohydrate sensors in taste buds, gut, and pancreas. Here we report that sweet taste receptors T1R2 and T1R3 are expressed throughout adipogenesis and in adipose tissues. Treatment of mouse and human precursor cells with artificial sweeteners, saccharin and acesulfame potassium, enhanced adipogenesis. Saccharin treatment of 3T3-L1 cells and primary mesenchymal stem cells rapidly stimulated phosphorylation of Akt and downstream targets with functions in adipogenesis such as cAMP-response element-binding protein and FOXO1; however, increased expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein α was not observed until relatively late in differentiation. Saccharin-stimulated Akt phosphorylation at Thr-308 occurred within 5 min, was phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-dependent, and occurred in the presence of high concentrations of insulin and dexamethasone; phosphorylation of Ser-473 occurred more gradually. Surprisingly, neither saccharin-stimulated adipogenesis nor Thr-308 phosphorylation was dependent on expression of T1R2 and/or T1R3, although Ser-473 phosphorylation was impaired in T1R2/T1R3 double knock-out precursors. In mature adipocytes, artificial sweetener treatment suppressed lipolysis even in the presence of forskolin, and lipolytic responses were correlated with phosphorylation of hormone-sensitive lipase. Suppression of lipolysis by saccharin in adipocytes was also independent of T1R2 and T1R3. These results suggest that some artificial sweeteners have previously uncharacterized metabolic effects on adipocyte differentiation and metabolism and that effects of artificial sweeteners on adipose tissue biology may be largely independent of the classical sweet taste receptors, T1R2 and T1R3.",

      "abstract": "Seventy water samples, including wastewaters, tap waters, fresh surface waters, coastal waters, groundwaters, and precipitation samples, from Tianjin, China, were analyzed for seven commonly used artificial sweeteners (ASs). The concentrations of the investigated ASs were generally in the order of wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) influent > WWTP effluent > surface water > tap water > groundwater ≈ precipitation, while the composition profiles of ASs varied in different waters. Acesulfame, sucralose, cyclamate, and saccharin were consistently detected in surface waters and ranged from 50 ng/L to 0.12 mg/L, while acesulfame was the dominant AS in surface and tap waters. Aspartame was found in all of the surface waters at a concentration up to 0.21 μg/L, but was not found in groundwaters and tap waters. Neotame and neohesperidin dihydrochalcone were less frequently detected and the concentrations were low. The concentrations of the ASs in some of the surface waters were of the same order with those in the WWTP influents, but not with the effluents, indicating there are probably untreated discharges into the surface waters. The ASs were detected in precipitation samples with high frequency, and acesulfame, saccharin, and cyclamate were the predominant ASs, with concentrations ranging from 3.5 ng/L to 1.3 μg/L. A gross estimation revealed that precipitation may act as a source for saccharin and cyclamate in the surface environment of Tianjin city. Moreover, the presence of ASs in the atmosphere was primarily assessed by taking 4 air samples to evaluate their potential source in precipitation.",

Considering the prevailing diabesity (obesity and diabetes) epidemic, this can, therefore, be an important alternative to natural, calorie-containing sweeteners. The purpose of this review is to summarize the current evidence on the effect of artificial sweeteners on body weight, appetite, and risk markers for diabetes and CVD in humans. RECENT FINDINGS: Short-term intervention studies have shown divergent results wrt appetite regulation, but overall artificial sweeteners cannot be claimed to affect hunger. Data from longer term intervention studies are scarce, but together they point toward a beneficial effect of artificial sweeteners on energy intake, body weight, liver fat, fasting and postprandial glycemia, insulinemia, and/or lipidemia compared with sugar. Epidemiological studies are not equivocal, but large cohort studies from the USA point toward decreased body weight and lower risk of type-2 diabetes and coronory heart diseases with increased intake of artificial sweeteners compared with sugar. SUMMARY: Artificial sweeteners, especially in beverages, can be a useful aid to maintain reduced energy intake and body weight and decrease risk of type-2 diabetes and CVD compared with sugars. However, confirmative long-term intervention trials are still needed.",

      "abstract": "Over the past several decades, the increased use of artificial sweeteners as dietary supplements has resulted in rising concentrations of these contaminants being detected in influent waters entering treatment facilities. As conventional treatments may not quantitatively remove these sweeteners, radical-based advanced oxidation and reduction (AO/RP) treatments could be a viable alternative. In this study, we have established the reaction kinetics for both hydroxyl ((•)OH) and sulfate (SO(4)(•-)) radical reaction with five common artificial sweeteners, as well as their associated reaction efficiencies. Rate constants for acesulfame K, aspartame, rebaudioside A, saccharin, and sucralose were <2 × 10(7), (2.28 ± 0.02) × 10(9), (2.1 ± 0.1) × 10(8), <2 × 10(7), and (1.7 ± 0.1) × 10(8) M(-1) s(-1) for the sulfate radical, and (3.80 ± 0.27) × 10(9), (6.06 ± 0.05) × 10(9), (9.97 ± 0.12) × 10(9), (1.85 ± 0.01) × 10(9), and (1.50 ± 0.01) × 10(9) M(-1) s(-1) for the hydroxyl radical, respectively. These latter values have to be combined with their corresponding reaction efficiencies of 67.9 ± 0.9, 52.2 ± 0.7, 43.0 ± 2.5, 52.7 ± 2.9, and 98.3 ± 3.5% to give effective rate constants for the hydroxyl radical reaction that can be used in the modeling of the AOP based removal of these contaminants.",

      "abstract": "An overview is given of existing trace analytical methods for the determination of seven popular artificial sweeteners [acesulfame (ACE), aspartame, cyclamate (CYC), neotame, neohesperidine dihydrochalcone, saccharin (SAC), and sucralose (SUC)] from aqueous environmental samples. Liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry and liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization high-resolution mass spectrometry are the methods most widely applied, either directly or after solid-phase extraction. Limits of detection and limits of quantification down to the low nanogram per liter range can be achieved. ACE, CYC, SAC, and SUC were detected in wastewater treatment plants in high microgram per liter concentrations. Per capita loads of individual sweeteners can vary within a wide range depending on their use in different countries. Whereas CYC and SAC are usually degraded by more than 90% during wastewater treatment, ACE and SUC pass through wastewater treatment plants mainly unchanged. This suggests their use as virtually perfect markers for the study of the impact of wastewater on source waters and drinking waters. In finished water of drinking water treatment plants using surface-water-influenced source water, ACE and SUC were detected in concentrations up to 7 and 2.4 μg/L, respectively. ACE was identified as a precursor of oxidation byproducts during ozonation, resulting in an aldehyde intermediate and acetic acid. Although the concentrations of ACE and SUC are among the highest measured for anthropogenic trace pollutants found in surface water, groundwater, and drinking water, the levels are at least three orders of magnitude lower than organoleptic threshold values. However, ecotoxicology studies are scarce and have focused on SUC. Thus, further research is needed both on identification of transformation products and on the ecotoxicological impact of artificial sweeteners and their transformation products.",

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: The two artificial sweeteners cyclamate (CYC) and acesulfame (ACE) have been detected in wastewater and drinking water treatment plants. As in both facilities ozonation might be applied, it is important to find out if undesired oxidation products (OPs) are formed. METHODS: For the separation and detection of the OPs, several analytical techniques, including nuclear magnetic resonance experiments, were applied. In order to distinguish between direct ozone reaction and a radical mechanism, experiments were carried out at different pH values with and without scavenging OH radicals. Kinetic experiments were used for confirmation that the OPs are formed during short ozone contact time applied in waterworks. Samples from a waterworks using bank filtrate as raw water were analyzed in order to prove that the identified OPs are formed in real and full-scale ozone applications. RESULTS: In the case of CYC, oxidation mainly occurs at the carbon atom, where the sulfonamide moiety is bound to the cyclohexyl ring. Consequently, amidosulfonic acid and cyclohexanone are formed as main OPs of CYC. When ozone reacts at another carbon atom of the ring a keto moiety is introduced into the CYC molecule. Acetic acid and the product ACE OP170, an anionic compound with m/z=170 and an aldehyde hydrate moiety, were identified as the main OPs for ACE. The observed reaction products suggest an ozone reaction according to the Criegee mechanism due to the presence of a C=C double bond. ACE OP170 was also detected after the ozonation unit of a full-scale drinking water treatment plant which uses surface water-influenced bank filtrate as raw water. CONCLUSIONS: Acesulfame can be expected to be found in anthropogenic-influenced raw water used for drinking water production. However, when ACE OP170 is formed during ozonation, it is not expected to cause any problem for drinking water suppliers, because the primary findings suggest its removal in subsequent treatment steps, such as activated carbon filters.",

      "abstract": "Due to incomplete removal of artificial sweeteners in wastewater treatment plants some of these compounds end up in receiving surface waters, which are used for drinking water production. The sum of removal efficiency of single treatment steps in multi-barrier treatment systems affects the concentrations of these compounds in the provided drinking water. This is the first systematic study revealing the effectiveness of single treatment steps in laboratory experiments and in waterworks. Six full-scale waterworks using surface water influenced raw water were sampled up to ten times to study the fate of acesulfame, saccharin, cyclamate and sucralose. For the most important treatment technologies the results were confirmed by laboratory batch experiments. Saccharin and cyclamate proved to play a minor role for drinking water treatment plants as they were eliminated by nearly 100% in all waterworks with biologically active treatment units like river bank filtration (RBF) or artificial groundwater recharge. Acesulfame and sucralose were not biodegraded during RBF and their suitability as wastewater tracers under aerobic conditions was confirmed. Sucralose proved to be persistent against ozone and its transformation was < 20% in lab and field investigations. Remaining traces were completely removed by subsequent granular activated carbon (GAC) filters. Acesulfame readily reacts with ozone (pseudo first-order rate constant k = 1.3 x 10(-3) s(-1) at 1 mg L(-1) ozone concentration). However, the applied ozone concentrations and contact times under typical waterworks conditions only led to an incomplete removal (18-60%) in the ozonation step. Acesulfame was efficiently removed by subsequent GAC filters with a low throughput of less than 30 m(3) kg(-1), but removal strongly depended on the GAC preload. Thus, acesulfame was detected up to 0.76 microg L(-1) in finished water.",

SUBJECTS: WLM (N=172) had maintained > or = 10% weight loss for 11.5 years, and had a body mass index (BMI) of 22.0 kg m(-2). NW (N=131) had a BMI of 21.3 kg m(-2) and no history of being overweight. Three, 24-h recalls on random, non-consecutive days were used to assess dietary intake. RESULTS: WLM reported consuming a diet that was lower in fat (28.7 vs 32.6%, P<0.0001) and used more fat-modification strategies than NW. WLM also consumed a significantly greater percentage of modified dairy (60 vs 49%; P=0.002) and modified dressings and sauces (55 vs 44%; P=0.006) than NW. WLM reported consuming three times more daily servings of artificially sweetened soft drinks (0.91 vs 0.37; P=0.003), significantly fewer daily servings of sugar-sweetened soft drinks (0.07 vs 0.16; P=0.03) and more daily servings of water (4.72 vs 3.48; P=0.002) than NW. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that WLM use more dietary strategies to accomplish their weight loss maintenance, including greater restriction on fat intake, use of fat- and sugar-modified foods, reduced consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages and increased consumption of artificially sweetened beverages. Ways to promote the use of fat-modified foods and artificial sweeteners merits further research in both prevention- and treatment-controlled trials.",

The analytes were extracted by solid phase extraction using Bakerbond SDB 1 cartridges at pH 3 and analyzed by liquid chromatography electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry in negative ionization mode. Ionization was enhanced by post-column addition of the alkaline modifier Tris(hydroxymethyl)amino methane. Except for aspartame and neohesperidin dihydrochalcone, recoveries were higher than 75% in potable water with comparable results for surface water. Matrix effects due to reduced extraction yields in undiluted waste water were negligible for aspartame and neotame but considerable for the other compounds. The widespread distribution of acesulfame, saccharin, cyclamate, and sucralose in the aquatic environment could be proven. Concentrations in two influents of German sewage treatment plants (STPs) were up to 190 microg/L for cyclamate, about 40 microg/L for acesulfame and saccharin, and less than 1 microg/L for sucralose. Removal in the STPs was limited for acesulfame and sucralose and >94% for saccharin and cyclamate. The persistence of some artificial sweeteners during soil aquifer treatment was demonstrated and confirmed their environmental relevance. The use of sucralose and acesulfame as tracers for anthropogenic contamination is conceivable. In German surface waters, acesulfame was the predominant artificial sweetener with concentrations exceeding 2 microg/L. Other sweeteners were detected up to several hundred nanograms per liter in the order saccharin approximately cyclamate > sucralose.",

This study aimed to determine whether alcohol in drinking water sweetened with artificial sweeteners would give adequate alcohol intake to achieve the desired hepatic effects. Rats were fed alcohol (8% v/v) in drinking water sweetened with sucrose (5% w/v) (n = 12), or with one of the artificial sweeteners aspartame (0.025%), saccharin (0.025%) or cyclamate (0.05%) (n = 8 per agent). During the alcohol treatment the animals were exposed to carbon tetrachloride vapour, 40 ppm, six hours per night for five nights per week, over a period of 14 weeks. All groups achieved good alcohol intakes of 5-6 g/kg/day. Only one rat, in the aspartame group, became cirrhotic; all the others had varying degrees of fibrosis which did not differ significantly among the treatments. Although it was not effective in reliably achieving cirrhosis, sweetening the alcohol solution with artificial sweeteners led to reasonable alcohol intakes with resultant hepatic fibrosis, and without the high carbohydrate intake which occurs when sucrose is used.",

      "abstract": "The effect of N-methyl-N-nitrosourea (MNU), sodium saccharin, sodium cyclamate and cyclophosphamide on rat bladder explants in vitro was studied. MNU administered as a single dose or in multiple treatments induced concentration-dependent changes in urothelial ultrastructure and cell surface topography. In a single treatment protocol, extensive cytotoxicity was observed in both the urothelium and stroma at concentrations of 500 to 1000 micrograms/ml, establishing a toxic threshold within this range. In a multiple treatment protocol, repeated doses of low concentrations of carcinogen (7 or 8 x 50 micrograms/ml, 6 x 100 micrograms/ml) induced hyperplastic and dysplastic changes in the urothelium with no cytotoxicity, but cytotoxic effects were observed following treatments of 4 x 200 micrograms/ml or 2 x 400 micrograms/ml. Sodium saccharin, sodium cyclamate, and cyclophosphamide induced changes in urothelial cell surface topography consistent with hyperplasia and preneoplasia. Prolonged exposure to saccharin or cyclamate followed by a single dose of MNU elicited more extensive abnormalities in the urothelium than either saccharin or cyclamate alone, suggesting that these artificial sweeteners have initiating activity in a multistage process. The ultrastructural changes induced by in vitro treatment showed a good correlation with the pathological changes observed in vivo in rats treated with MNU or fed either with saccharin or cyclamate.",
