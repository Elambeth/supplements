      "abstract": "Gout, a prevalent arthritic disease, can be mitigated by adenosine deaminase (ADA) inhibitors that reduce uric acid production. In this study, the extraction process of rosmarinic acid (RA) from Perilla frutescens L. (P. frutescens) was optimized, and the best yield was 2.22 mg/g. Quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) model was used to predict ADA inhibitors (ADAIs) in potential foods. The random forest model constructed by ChemoPy descriptor was the best (AUC = 0.9648), and five candidate compounds (including RA) were screened. The inhibitory activity of RA on ADA was confirmed in vitro (IC50 = 55.11 μM). Molecular docking showed that ADAIs and ADA were stably bound through hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interaction. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation verified the dynamic stability of ADAIs and ADA complexes. This study provides a theoretical basis for RA from P. frutescens extract as a potential compound for the treatment of gout and for the rapid screening of foodborne ADAIs."

      "abstract": "Lavandula angustifolia is widely reported for its biological activities and essential compounds. However, research confirming the physiological activities of L. angustifolia cell suspension culture extracts is limited. In this study, a high-yield method utilizing elicitation techniques was developed, specifically aimed at enhancing the production of rosmarinic acid (RA) in L. angustifolia cell suspension cultures. Among the various elicitors tested, methyl jasmonate (MJ) treatment was the most effective in enhancing RA production. The highest RA production [16.4 mg/g dry weight (DW)] was observed in cell suspension cultures treated with 100 μM MJ for 3 days. MJ application activated the expression of structural genes (PAL, C4H, 4CL, TAT, HPPR, AAT1, and CYP450) involved in the RA biosynthetic pathway, thereby significantly enhancing RA production. Furthermore, extracts from MJ-treated cell cultures grown in a 1-ton bioreactor exhibited significantly high antioxidant activity, inhibition of melanin synthesis, and enhanced procollagen synthesis. These findings not only demonstrate the feasibility of large-scale cultures of MJ-treated L. angustifolia cells but also highlight their industrial potential for applications in cosmetics and pharmaceuticals."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Erythrocyte deformability, the ability of red blood cells to bend and twist as they pass through capillaries, is es-sential for tissue perfusion. This study investigates the effects and underlying mechanisms of rosmarinic acid treatment on erythrocyte deformability in rats subjected to lower limb ischemia-reperfusion injury. METHODS: The study was conducted on Wistar albino rats weighing 400-450 g. The rats were randomly divided into five groups: the control group with no treatment (C), the group receiving only the solvent dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), the ischemia-reperfusion group (IR) subjected to 90 minutes of ischemia followed by 90 minutes of reperfusion in the femoral artery of the lower limb, the rosmarinic acid control group (RA-C) to assess the effects of rosmarinic acid alone, and the group (IR+RA) in which rosmarinic acid was administered intraperitoneally one hour before the ischemia-reperfusion procedure. At the end of the experiment, intracardiac blood samples were collected. Analyses included May-Grünwald-Giemsa (MGG) staining, measurement of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), erythrocyte deformability indexes, malondialdehyde (MDA), and superoxide dismutase (SOD) levels. RESULTS: Significant findings were observed in the study. Erythrocyte deformability was statistically significantly improved in the group that received rosmarinic acid prior to ischemia-reperfusion compared to the group that underwent ischemia-reperfusion alone. Morphological changes of erythrocytes were also significantly better in the IR+RA group than in the IR group. Immunohistochemical analysis of eNOS staining revealed that eNOS activity was higher in the IR group compared to the IR+RA group. Malondialdehyde (MDA) levels were significantly elevated in the IR group compared to all other groups. Analysis of superoxide dismutase levels showed that the SOD levels in the IR+RA group were significantly higher than those in the other groups. CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that rosmarinic acid treatment administered prior to ischemia provides protective effects against erythrocyte deformation and morphological deterioration. It is suggested that the improvement in deformability may be mediated by increased SOD activity, which reduces reactive oxygen anions, by-products of nitric oxide (NO) production, thereby exerting an antioxidant effect and enhancing the beneficial actions of NO.",

      "abstract": "Prostate cancer remains a significant health concern due to its high mortality rate, emphasizing the need for innovative therapeutic approaches. This study aims to explore the potential anticancer effects of a drug nanocomplex containing rosmarinic acid in the treatment of prostate cancer, aiming to contribute to the development of safer and more effective treatment options for cancer patients. Nanocomposite Graphene Oxide was synthesized following the Hummers' method. The resulted product dissolved in deionized water with rosmarinic acid to prepare the final product. To investigate the effects of rosmarinic acid@Se-TiO2-GO, PC3, LNCaP, and normal (HFF-1) cell lines were treated with varying concentrations (7.8, 15.6, 31.2, 62.5, 125, 250, and 500 µg/ml) of the nanocomplex. Cell viability was assessed using the Resazurin test, while levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), gene expression (Bcl-2 and Bax), and total antioxidant capacity were measured in both cancerous and normal cells. The Se-TiO2-GO nanoparticles demonstrated high entrapment efficiency and loading capacity for rosmarinic acid. The IC50 values after 24 and 48 h of RA treatment were significantly greater than those recorded for treatments involving rosmarinic acid@Se-TiO2-GO. Treatment with rosmarinic acid@Se-TiO2-GO resulted in decreased cell viability and increased apoptosis in PC3 and LNCaP cells, while showing no inhibitory effects on the normal cell line (HFF-1) at concentrations toxic to cancer cells. Additionally, a dose-dependent increase in ROS levels, a decrease in total antioxidant capacity, elevated Bax gene expression, and reduced Bcl-2 expression were observed in the cancer cells following treatment with the nanocomplex. The cytotoxic effects of rosmarinic acid@Se-TiO2-GO nanoparticles on prostate cancer cells appear to be mediated through the generation of oxidative stress and induction of apoptosis. The unique formulation of these nanoparticles holds promise for future prostate cancer treatment strategies.",

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: Parkinson's disease (PD) is neuropathologically characterized by the progressive degeneration of dopaminergic (DA) neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc), affecting 10 million people worldwide. Rosmarinic acid (RA), a polyphenol found in plants like rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis), is known for its intriguing biological properties and potential antioxidant and neuroprotective effects. In a previous study we showed that RA treatment prevented hyperlocomotion in mice with MPTP (1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine)-induced parkinsonism and improved the monoaminergic system in healthy animals. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying RA's action in PD remain unclear. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: In this study, we treated MPTP-induced PD animals (C57BL/6 male mice) with RA orally at a dose of 100 mg/kg for 15 days and examined the proteome of substantia nigra (SN) to identify possible regulatory targets of RA treatment to shed some lights into its neuroprotective effects. RESULTS: Quantitative proteomics revealed that RA treatment regulated proteins associated with oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), glutamatergic synapse, and vesicular cycle signaling pathway. We identified 371 proteins significantly regulated in response to RA administration (255 upregulated and 116 downregulated). Notably, some cellular targets of RA treatment reported here, including mGluR2/mGluR3/EAAT-proteins from the glutamatergic system-and proteins from the Complex I of the electron transport chain are promising targets for therapeutic intervention. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: These findings highlight the molecular differences between MPTP-induced PD mice and those treated with RA, providing insights on the molecular basis behind the neuroprotective effects of RA and revealing potential PD signatures that warrant further investigation."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Breast cancer is the highest cancer incidence in the world. Chemotherapy is currently one of the main breast cancer treatments besides surgery. It is capable of evolving to become resistant to chemotherapy agents. Chemotherapy also has significant side effects. Rosmarinic acid could become an anti-cancer agent candidate for the treatment of breast cancer, but its molecular mechanism is still unclear. AIM: This study aimed to clarify the molecular mechanism of rosmarinic acid anti-breast cancer properties via an in-silico study. METHODS: Web-based screening tools such as SwissTargetPrediction, Similarity Ensemble Approach (SEA), and TargetNet were used as initial screening. From web-based screening, potential proteins that interact with rosmarinic acid could be determined. Intersected proteins from 3 web-based screenings were assessed via literature review. We found 11 intersected proteins, and 6 of 11 proteins are involved in breast cancer development and progression. Those 6 proteins are MMP-1, MMP-2, MMP-9, MMP-12, aldose reductase, and M-phase Inducer Phosphatase 2 (CDC25B). Then molecular docking using Autodock 4.6.2 was used in ligand and protein interaction simulation. Those 6 proteins were selected as macromolecules in the docking study. RESULTS: Based on the docking result, we found that rosmarinic acid can bind MMP-1, MMP2, MMP-9, and MMP-12 active sites. The binding profile of rosmarinic acid with aldose reductase has similarities with other confirmed inhibitors. Docking with CDC25B showed that rosmarinic acid also binds in the same place as cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs). CONCLUSION: The ability of rosmarinic acid to inhibit MMP-1, MMP-2, MMP-9, aldose reductase, and CDC25B activity may underlie how rosmarinic acid is able to inhibit the development of breast cancer."

      "abstract": "Pseudorabies virus (PRV), a swine alphaherpesvirus, is a double-stranded DNA virus. It may infect various animals, especially pigs. PRV infection in pigs leads to high mortality rates, and causes huge economic lose for swine industry. Currently, there are few effective antiviral treatments available. Rosmarinic acid (RA), a hydrophilic phenolic compound, shows potential for inhibiting herpes simplex virus. Given that PRV is a member of the Herpesviridae family, this study investigated the antiviral effects of RA against PRV infection through both in vitro and in vivo, as well as the underlying molecular mechanisms. PK-15 cells were used to assess the cytotoxicity of RA in vitro, followed by an investigation of its anti-PRV activity. The study then explored how RA regulates the cGAS-STING signaling pathway, along with inflammatory and apoptotic factors in PRV-infected cells. Molecular docking and dynamics simulations further elucidated the binding interactions between RA and cGAS-STING, providing insight into how RA activates the cGAS-STING pathway against PRV infection. In vivo, the antiviral efficacy of RA was evaluated in a PRV-infected mouse model by assessing tissue viral genome copies, the innate immune cGAS-STING signaling pathway activation, and inflammatory and apoptotic responses. The results showed that RA exhibited a half-maximal cytotoxic concentration (CC50) of 26.23 µg/mL on PK-15 cells and a half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 0.84 µg/mL against PRV, resulting in a selectivity index (SI) of 31.22. These findings suggest that RA is a highly effective and low-toxicity compound. RA significantly inhibited PRV adsorption, penetration, and replication within cells. Additionally, while PRV infection suppresses the cGAS-STING signaling pathway, RA treatment activates the innate immune response, enhances downstream antiviral effector IFN-β expression, and reduces inflammation and apoptosis in PRV-infected cells. Molecular docking results showed that the docking scores of cGAS_RA and STING_RA complexes were both less than - 5 kcal/mol, suggesting that RA binds well to cGAS and STING proteins. Molecular dynamics simulations, including RMSD, RMSF, and MM-GBSA analyses, confirmed the high binding stability of cGAS with RA, further validating the potential activity of RA as a cGAS agonist. In vivo studies revealed that RA dramatically lowered viral genome copies in various organs, activated the cGAS-STING signaling pathway, inhibited PRV-induced inflammation and apoptosis, alleviated clinical symptoms, and decreased mortality rate in PRV-infected mice. Overall, RA significantly inhibited PRV proliferation in vitro and in vivo, effectively reduced inflammation and apoptosis, and decreased the mortality rate in infected mice. The study supports the development of RA as an antiviral drug and emphasizes its potential as a candidate for PRV therapy.",

      "abstract": "Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is expected to rise ca. 40 % by 2040. Rosmarinic acid (RA) has been recognized for its anticancer properties, although its role in OSCC has been neglected. This work exploits the activity of RA in 2D and 3D models of OSCC cells to compel a roadmap for its anticancer properties. The results demonstrated that RA significantly reduced cell mass and metabolic activity in a dose, time, and cell-type-dependent manner, predominantly in highly-invasive OSCC, without compromising normal mucosa in therapeutic doses. RA decreased mitochondria membrane potential and increased redox state, which was corroborated by pioneering observations on the metabolome landscape of OSCC cells (glutathione reduction and acetate and fumarate release). RA triggered autophagy, upregulating BNIP3 and BCNL1 and downregulating BIRC5. The upregulation of CADM1 and downregulation of VIM, CADM2, SNAIL1, and SOX9 highlighted the modulation of epithelial-mesenchymal transition and the remodeling of the extracellular matrix by the downregulation of MMP-2 and MMP-9. RA interacts with P-glycoprotein with the highest docking score of -6.4 kcal/mol. The HSC-3 cell surface charge decreased after RA treatment (-22.6 ± 0.3 mV vs. -26.3 ± 0.3 mV, p < 0.0001), suggesting a reversion of cell polarity and the impairment of invasion. RA also shrank the growth and the metabolic activity of multicellular tumor spheroids. Its modest protein binding with human saliva sheds light on its administration by the oromucosal route. Overall, this work supports the need for further research on the anticancer potential of RA in OSCC, either in monotherapy, combined with conventional treatments, or conveyed in nanosystems.",

      "abstract": "Nowadays, salinity is one of the most serious environmental problems affecting plant performance and metabolites. Biochar as a biological and sustainable amendment can be a valuable tool for improving soil health and plant growth traits under salinity stress and reducing its effects. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of biochar (0, 1.5, and 3% by a mass percentage of the pot) on physicochemical properties and soil enzyme activity, as well as functional, physiological, and phytochemical traits of Thymus vulgaris L. under salinity stress (0, 2, 4, and 6 ds m-1 NaCl), were investigated. Biochar increases porosity, water-holding capacity, enzyme activity, phosphorus, and potassium nutrient content of the soil and reduces sodium uptake by the plant under salinity stress. Growth and performance traits were significantly increased under the influence of biochar and salinity conditions. The maximum fresh weight (104.87 g/plant) and dry weight (63.56 g/plant) of shoot were observed in the 3% biochar treatment in normal conditions. The highest content of essential oil (1.91%), thymol (63.51%), carvacrol (9.12%), and rosmarinic acid (15.05 mg/g DW) was observed at the highest levels of biochar and salinity. The activity of antioxidant enzymes and osmotic substances increased significantly (P < 0.01) in salinity conditions, which were reduced by adding biochar (P < 0.01). Generally, biochar as an organic and environmentally friendly material can be a suitable solution for increasing resistance to salinity in the garden thyme and enabling its cultivation and production in low-yielding and saline lands."

CCK-8 and colony formation assays were used to evaluate the potential inhibitory effects of RA on TNBC cells and to measure intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels. Flow cytometry was employed to analyze the cell cycle and apoptosis. RNA-seq analysis was performed to investigate the potential mechanisms of RA on MDA-MB-231 cells. RA inhibited the proliferation of TNBC cells in a concentration-dependent manner and reduced intracellular ROS levels. RA induced cell cycle arrest at the G1/G0 phase and promoted apoptosis by decreasing mitochondrial membrane potential. RNA-seq differential expression analysis, identified 1,929 differentially expressed genes, including 601 upregulated genes and 1,328 downregulated genes. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) showed that these differentially expressed genes were significantly enriched in pathways associated with ferroptosis, ABC transporters, and fatty acid metabolism. Additionally, RA significantly upregulated the expression of dynamin-related protein 1 (DRP1) in MDA-MB-231 cells, promoting mitochondrial fission, disrupting mitochondrial dynamics, and leading to dysfunction. Furthermore, RA increased the expression of intracellular ferroportin and heme oxygenase 1 (HMOX-1), resulting in elevated intracellular iron levels. The study suggests that RA inhibits the proliferation of TNBC cells through multiple mechanisms and may have potential therapeutic effects in the treatment of TNBC."

      "abstract": "Rosmarinic acid (RA) is an attractive candidate for ulcerative colitis (UC) application due to its bioactive properties, including antioxidant and anti-inflammatory functions, however, the poor water solubility and on-targeting hamper its therapeutic outcome. Therefore, this work reported the synthesis and preparation of novel water-soluble rosmarinic acid-chondroitin sulfate A (RA-CSA) nanoconjugate, which was used for the treatment of UC in dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced acute colitis mouse model. RA was functionalized with CSA as confirmed by FTIR and 1H NMR, and self-assembled to form nanoassemblies with a diameter of 247.3 ± 2.99 nm. RA-CSA nanoassemblies exhibited radical scavenging and antioxidant capacity. RA-CSA remarkably inhibited lipopolysaccharide-induced nitric oxide and TNF-α production in RAW 264.7 cells without cytotoxicity, whose inhibition rate was <5 % at 200 μg mL-1. Oral administration of RA-CSA nanoassemblies significantly attenuated colonic inflammation compared to the parent RA, as evidenced by significantly reduced the shortening of colon length (4.20 ± 0.15 cm), body weight loss, and colonic inflammatory damage in DSS-induced colitis mice. In addition, RA-CSA nanoassemblies suppressed the expression and production of typical pro-inflammatory cytokines of ulcerative colitis. These results suggest that RA-CSA nanoassemblies deserve further consideration as a potential therapeutic drug for the treatment of UC.",

The effects of Thy and Ros-A separately or in combination (Thy × Ros-A) on the intestinal function and health of piglets challenged with Escherichia coli K88 (E. coli K88) were investigated. A total of 30 piglets aged 21 d were assigned to 5 groups (n = 6). The control (Con) and K88 groups piglets received a basal diet, while the Thy, Ros-A, and Thy × Ros-A groups were fed a basal diet supplemented with 500 mg/kg Thy, 500 mg/kg Ros-A, and 250 mg/kg Thy + 250 mg/kg Ros-A, respectively. On the 19th and 20th day, piglets in the K88, Thy, Ros-A, and Thy × Ros-A groups were orally administered 10 mL of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing approximately 1 × 109 CFU/mL of E. coli K88, while the Con group received an equal volume of PBS. The results showed that the Thy × Ros-A treatment reduced the damage to ileal villi induced by the E. coli K88 challenge, leading to longer villi in the ileum (P < 0.05). Thy and Ros-A modulated the composition of the ileal microbiota. Compared to the K88 group, the Thy × Ros-A group had a higher abundance of Lactobacillus and Romboutsia, while Escherichia-Shigella and Desulforvibrio were lower (P < 0.05). Additionally, the Thy × Ros-A group showed elevated levels of gene and protein expressions for zonula occludens-1, occludin, and claudin-1 compared to the K88 group (P < 0.05).

This study aimed to explore the anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic properties of RA in folic acid-induced renal injury. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-six male C57/BL6 mice were randomly divided into six groups (N=6): Control (received normal saline), NaHCO3 (received NaHCO3 as folic acid solvent), FA (received folic acid (FA)(IP) to induce renal injury), RA (received 100 mg/kg RA), RA50-FA (received 50 mg/kg RA solution after folic acid injection), and RA100-FA (received 100 mg/kg RA after folic acid injection). For ten days, the treatment groups received RA by gavage. The effects of RA were assessed using H & E staining, biochemical tests, western blotting, and ELISA in the kidney tissues of the mice. Real-time RT-PCR was also performed to evaluate the expression changes of renal genes. RESULTS: Our data showed that treatment by RA led to the over-expression of FoxO3 (P<0.05) and decrease in NFκB levels (P<0.01 and P<0.05) and expression of TNFα (P<0.05) and IL6 (P<0.001 and P<0.01). Other evaluations showed a decrease in p53 (P<0.01 and P<0.001), Bax/Bcl-2 ratio expression (P<0.01 and P<0.05), and Caspase-3 level (P<0.01 and P<0.05) compared to the folic acid group. Histological and biochemical results also confirmed the attenuation of tissue damage. CONCLUSION: This study revealed that RA's positive effects on folic acid-induced renal injury might result from the involvement of the FoxO3/NFκB pathway, thereby suppressing inflammation and apoptosis."

      "abstract": "UNLABELLED: The prevention and treatment of metabolic disorders, such as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), have emerged as critical global health challenges. Current lipid-lowering pharmacotherapies are associated with side effects, including hepatotoxicity, rhabdomyolysis, and decreased erythrocyte counts, underscoring the urgent need for safer therapeutic alternatives. Hepatocyte nuclear factor 4α (HNF4α) has been identified as a pivotal regulator of lipid metabolism, making it an attractive target for drug development. In this study, we investigated the structural characteristics and binding interactions of four HNF4α agonists: Alverine, Benfluorex, N-trans caffeoyltyramine (NCT), and N-trans feruloyltyramine (NFT). Our results indicate that the conjugated structure formed by the amide bond and the aromatic ring in NCT and NFT enhances electron density, potentially contributing to their increased specificity for HNF4α relative to Alverine and Benfluorex. Additionally, electrostatic interactions between the aromatic moieties of the compounds and HNF4α residues were found to play a crucial role in ligand binding. Leveraging these insights, we performed a high-throughput virtual screening of 2131 natural compounds, using the binding modes of NCT and NFT as reference templates. Rosmarinic acid emerged as a promising HNF4α agonist, exhibiting a high consensus score and favorable binding affinity. Subsequent biological assays demonstrated that rosmarinic acid significantly inhibited HepG2 cell proliferation which related to the enhancement of autophagy. After the knockdown of P2 isoform of HNF4α, HepG2 was more sensitive to the administration of NCT and rosmarinic acid. Furthermore, the proliferation of DLD-1 cell, which only expresses the P2 isoform of HNF4α, was not significantly inhibited by the administration of NCT and rosmarinic acid. Collectively, these findings suggest that rosmarinic acid is a promising HNF4α agonist which is more effective to activate the P1 isoform of HNF4α and holds potential as an effective treatment for NAFLD, providing a foundation for the development of novel lipid-lowering drugs with enhanced efficacy and reduced side effect.

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Neuronal damage is criminal to cognitive dysfunction, closely related to endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS). However, due to the pathogenesis of endotoxin-induced long-term cognitive dysfunction is not fully clarified, there is still a lack of effective treatment. This study was conducted to explore the protective effects and mechanism of rosmarinic acid (RA) against ERS in endotoxin-induced cognitive dysfunction in mice and neuronal injury in cells. METHODS: The efficacy of RA was evaluated using an endotoxin-induced cognitive dysfunction mice model and an in vitro neuronal injury model. Brain injury was assessed using behavioral tests and hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining. Western blotting and Immunohistochemistry (IHC) were performed to determine NeuN, GRP78, PERK, ATF6, IRE1α, and MANF expression levels. Molecular docking was used to assess the associated mechanisms. RESULTS: Behavioral tests indicated that 20 and 40 mg/kg RA significantly improve endotoxin-induced cognitive dysfunction without dose differences. Histological analysis revealed no significant alterations in the number, morphology, and arrangement of neurons in the hippocampus and amygdala. However, 40 mg/kg RA treatment significantly decreased the hippocampal level of PERK protein and increased MANF in CA1 and DG in mice. Furthermore, our data showed that 120 μM RA pretreatment significantly inhibited LPS-conditioned culture-induced GRP78, PERK, and MANF upregulation in vitro. Finally, molecular docking studies suggested that RA could directly interact with GRP78, PERK, and IRE1, but not with MANF. CONCLUSION: RA plays a protective role in improving cognitive function against endotoxemia-associated encephalopathy in mice via inhibiting the GRP78/PERK/MANF pathway.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Rosmarinic acid (RosA) is a natural polyphenol compound that has been shown to be effective in the treatment of inflammatory disease and a variety of malignant tumors. However, its specific mechanism for the treatment of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) has not been fully elucidated. Therefore, this study aims to clarify the mechanism of RosA in the treatment of LUAD by integrating bioinformatics, network pharmacology and in vivo experiments, and to explore the potential of the active ingredients of traditional Chinese medicine in treating LUAD. METHODS: Firstly, the network pharmacology was used to screen the RosA targets, and LUAD-related differential expressed genes (DEGs) were acquired from the GEO database. The intersection of LUAD regulated by RosA (RDEGs) was obtained through the Venn diagram. Secondly, GO and KEGG enrichment analysis of RDEGs were performed, and protein-protein interaction networks (PPIs) were constructed to identify and visualize hub RDEGs. Then, molecular docking between hub RDEGs and RosA was performed, and further evaluation was carried out by using bioinformatics for the predictive value of the hub RDEGs. Finally, the mechanism of RosA in the treatment of LUAD was verified by establishing a xenograft model of NSCLC in nude mouse. RESULTS: Bioinformatics and other analysis showed that, compared with the control group, the expressions of MMP-1, MMP-9, IGFBP3 and PLAU in LUAD tissues were significantly up-regulated, and the expressions of PPARG and FABP4 were significantly down-regulated, and these hub RDEGs had potential predictive value for LUAD. In vivo experimental results showed that RosA could inhibit the growth of transplanted tumors in nude mice bearing tumors of lung cancer cells, reduce the positive expression of Ki67 in lung tumor tissue, and hinder the proliferation of lung tumor cells. Upregulated expression of PPARG and FABP4 by activating the PPAR signaling pathway increases the level of ROS in lung tumor tissues and promotes apoptosis of lung tumor cells. In addition, RosA can also reduce the expression of MMP-9 and IGFBP3, inhibit the migration and invasion of lung tumor tissue cells. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that RosA could induce apoptosis by regulating the PPAR signaling pathway and the expression of MMP-9, inhibit the proliferation, migration and invasion of lung cancer cells, thereby exerting anti-LUAD effects. This study provides new insight into the potential mechanism of RosA in treating LUAD and provides a new therapeutic avenue for treatment of LUAD."

To combat this effect, plant stem cells offer a renewable and eco-friendly source for various industries, including cosmeceuticals. Salvia miltiorrhiza (SM), which contains the bioactive compound Rosmarinic acid (RA) and has been proposed for its anti-wrinkle effect. Methods: In the present study, calli from SM were cultured and Quality by Design (QbD) was implemented to investigate the effect of different types and concentrations of elicitors; jasmonic acid (JA) and salicylic acid (SA). Both raised RA levels yet, jasmonic acid (50 µM) has resulted in the highest yield for RA, at 16 mg/g. A nanofiber patch was prepared and characterized in-vitro by the release percentage, drug content, swelling degree, scanning electron microscope, and surface roughness. Then, the anti-wrinkle effect of the patch was tested in a UV wrinkle-induced mouse model. Results: Interestingly, after treatment, there were visibly fewer wrinkles, and the skin was softer than in the untreated control group. This study suggests that the treatment exerted its effect through the Nrf2/Keap1 pathway, which plays a crucial role in cellular antioxidant protective processes. By activating this pathway through boosting Nrf2 and diminishing Keap1 cellular content, the nanofiber patch enhances the production of antioxidant enzymes, such as superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase, enhancesglutathione, and reduces the skin lipid peroxidation, collectively indicating enhanced skin quality. Conclusions: In conclusion, this study highlights the importance of this formula as an anti-wrinkle treatment, and future clinical studies are recommended to further unveil the potential of this formula."

Treatment methods are listed as surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy, depending on the stage of cancer, but developing resistance to chemotherapy increases the need for alternative agents that act on the same pathways. The effects of rosmarinic acid (RA) and doxorubicin (DX) on the activation of FOXP3, an important tumor suppressor gene, in OVCAR3 cells were examined. Materials and Methods: In this study, a human ovarian adenocarcinoma cell line was used. MTT analysis was performed to reveal the result of RA and DX on ovarian cancer cell proliferation. Expression levels of FOXP3 for cell proliferation and Capase-3 for apoptosis were determined by RT-qPCR. The wound healing model was applied to determine cell migration rates. The results were evaluated with one-way ANOVA in an SPSS 20.0 program as p ≤ 0.05. Results: It was determined that RA and DX alone and in combination inhibited the proliferation of OVCAR3 cells in different doses for 24, 48, and 72 h, and caused the cells to die by causing them to undergo apoptosis. Caspase-3 expression increased approximately tenfold in OVCAR3 cells, while FOXP3 expression was upregulated only in RA treatment and was downregulated in DX and RA + DX treatments. Conclusions: According to the results of our study, it was determined that the FOXP3 signaling pathway related to apoptosis, and proliferation was affected by the combination treatment of RA and DX in the OVCAR3 cancer cell line. This shows that RA will gain an important place in cancer treatment with more comprehensive study."

      "abstract": "The management of diabetic wounds (DW) is a significant challenge within the medical field. Effectively regulating the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) at the wound site and orchestrating the inflammatory response are effective strategies for DW treatment. In this study, a novel hydrogel was developed by cross-linking polyboronic acid-modified carboxymethyl chitosan with herbal active ingredient rosmarinic acid (RA), an active herbal ingredient, through dynamic boronic esters formation. In this RA hydrogel (RAgel), RA serves both as an active pharmaceutical ingredient and as a linker for the creation of a dynamic covalent hydrogel, which can decrease the potential toxicity of chemical crosslinking agents and improve the utilization of RA. RAgel demonstrated potential for controlling RA loading and responsiveness to ROS and glucose levels in a diabetic wound environment. Additionally, the intrinsic antioxidant and antibacterial properties of RA were effectively preserved and enhanced upon integration into RAgel. Furthermore, RAgel not only promoted the migration of L929 cells, a key aspect of tissue repair, but also induced M2 polarization in macrophages,while inhibiting the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines. In a murine model of diabetic wound healing, RAgel significantly enhanced the proliferation of both the epidermal and granulation tissues. It also exerts a marked anti-inflammatory effect and promotes collagen deposition, thereby expediting the overall wound healing process. The reported RAgel formulation has potential to address the complex challenges associated with diabetic wound management.",

Rosmarinic acid (RA) is a natural and safe compound with powerful antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. In this study, the ameliorative effects of RA were assayed in folic acid (FA)-induced renal injury by involving the SIRT1/NOX1 pathway. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Thirty-six male C57/BL6 mice were divided into 6 groups (n = 6) including control, vehicle, FA, RA, FA + RA 50, and FA + RA 100. After 10 days, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, and oxidative stress were measured. The expression of SIRT1 and NOX1 proteins was evaluated by western blot. Also, histopathological alterations were assayed by H&E and PAS staining methods. FINDINGS/RESULTS: BUN and creatinine were significantly higher in the FA group compared to the control group; however, their levels decreased after RA treatment in both doses. A significant decrease was observed in swelling, necrosis, and desquamation of tubular epithelial cells in the FA + RA 50 and FA + RA 100 groups compared to the FA group. RA in the animals receiving FA increased SIRT1 expression and the levels of GSH and SOD compared to the FA group. RA in the animals receiving FA showed a significant decrease in NOX1 expression and MDA level compared to the FA group. CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS: The findings declared that the administration of RA has positive effects against renal damage induced by FA. The effect might result from involvement in the SIRT1/NOX1 pathway and thereby attenuation of oxidative stress."

      "abstract": "Gastric cancer (GC) ranks as the fifth most prevalent cancer globally. Owing to the absence of early manifest symptoms, it is difficult to diagnose GC until it has metastasized to other organs. Hence, the prevention and treatment of GC have become major concerns for patients. Echium amoenum, a traditional medicinal plant from the Boraginaceae family, exhibits various biological activities. Although recent studies have reported the anticancer properties of E. amoenum, its effects and mechanisms of action on GC cells are not yet fully understood. This study examined the anticancer effects of the ethyl acetate extract of E. amoenum (EAEC) and its main active ingredient, rosmarinic acid (RA), in GC AGS cells. EAEC and RA suppressed AGS cell growth by inducing apoptosis through caspase mediation and inhibited AGS cell metastasis by influencing the expression of crucial epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) biomarkers. Furthermore, the anti-growth and anti-metastatic effects of EAEC and RA on AGS cells involved inactivation of the STAT3, AKT, and ERK1/2 pathways. Additionally, RA notably inhibited the in vivo tumor growth in AGS cells. Overall, these results indicate that EAEC and RA could serve as potential anticancer and anti-metastasis agents for GC.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) is a mosquito-borne zoonotic pathogen that causes encephalitis in humans and reproductive failure in pigs. The transmission of JEV between humans and animals poses a significant public health threat and results in substantial economic losses. Excessive inflammation in the central nervous system of JEV-infected patients is a major cause of mortality and disability. Rosmarinic acid (RA), a polyhydroxyphenolic compound isolated from medicinal herbs, has been preliminarily shown to possess anti-inflammatory properties and significantly inhibit JEV-induced neuroinflammation in mice. RESULTS: This study investigated the antiviral capacity and potential mechanisms of RA in JEV-infected cells. The results demonstrated that RA could inhibit JEV replication in vitro. Furthermore, the expression levels of inflammatory cytokines (including IL-6, IL-1β, CCL-2, and TNF-α), membrane receptors (including RIG-I, TLR3, TLR4, TLR7, and TLR8), NF-κB complex and p62/SQSTM1 were assessed using qPCR, ELISA, and Western blot, respectively. The findings indicated that RA significantly suppressed the expression of IL-6, IL-1α, TNF-α, and CCL-2 in JEV-infected BV-2 cells in a dose-dependent manner. Additionally, RA treatment downregulated the expression levels of RIG-I and p62, while p62 silencing inhibited the upregulation of inflammatory cytokines in JEV-infected BV-2 cells. CONCLUSION: Our present study highlights the important role of RA-mediated reduction of RIG-I and p62 in microglia, conferring resistance to Japanese encephalitis virus-induced inflammation.",

This review examined the molecular mechanisms underlying these properties and their potential application in cancer prevention and therapy. It focuses specifically on RA's role in modulating cancer-related pathways and presents a detailed analysis of recent advancements in this area. A systematic review of PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases was conducted in accordance with PRISMA (Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis) guidelines, focusing on studies published between 2019 and 2024. A total of 25 articles providing evidence from in vitro, in vivo, and in silico studies were selected. These findings elucidate the role of RA in inhibiting tumor cell proliferation, inducing apoptosis, and preventing metastasis in various types of cancer through diverse mechanisms, including its antioxidant properties. Despite these promising results, RA's bioavailability challenges limit its therapeutic efficacy, underscoring the necessity for improved delivery methods. This review concludes that RA exhibits significant potential as a natural agent for cancer prevention and treatment, although further clinical trials are warranted."

This is related, among other things, to the non-specific symptoms, especially in the initial stages, and also to the limited possibilities for treatment. Therefore, research is still being conducted to improve the detection of this type of cancer and increase the effectiveness of therapy. The potential application of natural compounds in cancer management deserves special attention. In the group of such products, there are polyphenolic compounds that reveal, e.g., anti-oxidative, anti-carcinogenic, anti-inflammatory, anti-diabetic, and neuroprotective properties. One of these polyphenols is rosmarinic acid, commonly found in plants such as the Boraginaceae and Nepetoideae subfamilies of the Lamiaceae (mint) family. A number of studies have considered the positive effects of rosmarinic acid in the treatment of many cancers, including gastrointestinal ones such as oral, stomach, pancreas, colon, and liver cancers. The main aim of this paper was to summarize the mechanisms of action of rosmarinic acid in gastrointestinal cancers.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The natural polyphenolic compound known as Rosmarinic acid (RosA) can be found in various plants. Although its potential health benefits have been extensively studied, its effect on osteoarthritis (OA) progression and cartilage regeneration function still needs to be fully elucidated in OA animal models. This study elucidated the effect of RosA on OA progression and cartilage regeneration. METHODS: In vitro assessments were conducted using RT-PCR, qRT-PCR, Western blotting, and ELISA to measure the effects of RosA. The molecular mechanisms of RosA were determined by analyzing the translocation of p65 into the nucleus using immunocytochemistry (ICC). Histological analysis of cartilage explant was performed using alcian blue staining and immunohistochemistry (IHC). For in vivo analysis, the destabilization of the medial meniscus (DMM)-induced OA mouse model was utilized to evaluate cartilage destruction through Safranin-O staining. The expression of catabolic and anabolic factors in mice knee joints was quantified by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: The expression of catabolic factors in chondrocytes was significantly impeded by RosA. It also suppressed the NF-κB signaling pathway by decreasing phosphorylation of p65 and reducing degradation of IκB protein. In ex vivo experiments, RosA protected sulfated proteoglycan erosion triggered by IL-1β and suppressed the catabolic factors in cartilage explant. RosA treatment in animal models resulted in preventing cartilage destruction and reducing catabolic factors in the cartilage. RosA was also found to promote the expression of Sox9, Col2a1, and Acan in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo analyses. CONCLUSIONS: RosA attenuated the OA progression by suppressing the catabolic factors expression. These effects were facilitated through the suppression of the NF-κB signaling pathway. Additionally, it promotes cartilage regeneration by inducing anabolic factors. Therefore, RosA shows potential as an effective therapeutic agent for treating OA."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Glioblastoma (GB) is a highly malignant type of brain cancer with a poor prognosis. Therapeutic strategies for GB are still limited. Rosmarinic acid (RA), a polyphenolic compound, is a promising experimental anticancer agent, but its specific protein targets for GB remain unclear. PURPOSE: This study aimed to elucidate the anticancer effects of RA in 2D- and 3D-GB cells and the underlying mechanisms. METHODS: 3D-tumor spheroids (mimics in vivo tumors) were obtained by the hanging-drop/agarose method. RA's anti-glioma activity on U-87MG (p53-wt/PTEN-mt) and LN229 (p53-mt/PTEN-wt) cells was evaluated through cell viability, colony-formation, migration/invasion/angiogenesis assays, fluorescence imaging, and spheroid growth analysis. The underlying mechanism of the anticancer effects of RA was investigated by Western blot and immunofluorescence analysis. The MEK inhibitor U0126 was used to block ERK phosphorylation. RESULTS: RA treatments exerted anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects on human GB cells. RA dose-dependently reduced angiogenesis and intracellular ROS levels, suppressed glioma growth, and migration/invasion in 2D-culture and cancer stem cell (CSC)-like 3D-spheroid culture (SPC). Repeated therapy in SPC was more effective by leading to disrupted structure than a single treatment. Treatments in SPC also suppressed epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and CSC-like properties. Strikingly, RA downregulated the SIRT1/FOXO1/NF-κB axis independently of p53 or PTEN function in both gliomas. Immunofluorescence labeling revealed decreased SIRT1 and NF-κB-p65 and increased FOXO1 and GAPDH proteins in nuclear location (associated with apoptosis). Surprisingly, RA increased p-ERK1/2 levels, but priming with U0126 abolished RA-mediated p-ERK upregulation; thus, autophagy and apoptosis induction in GB cells were prevented, and the growth of GB spheroids accelerated. Specifically, RA also inhibited the PTEN/PI3K/AKT pathway in U-87MG cells. Due to genetic differences in cells, U-87MG cells were more sensitive to RA treatments than LN229 cells. Meanwhile, our positive control drug trial results with FDA-approved temozolomide (TMZ) used in GB treatment showed that our test compound rosmarinic acid exhibited higher therapeutic effects than TMZ at lower doses. CONCLUSION: Suppression of EMT, downregulation of SIRT1/FOXO1/NF-κB axis, inhibition of PTEN/PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, and ERK-induced apoptosis and autophagy were determined to be involved in stopping glioma progression. Our findings for the first time, revealed that RA may have potential therapeutic use by having multiple targets in human brain cancer with further clinical studies.",

      "abstract": "This study aimed to explore the potential antiallodynic effects of rosmarinic acid, a natural antioxidant with a demonstrated safety profile across a broad dose range. Using a chronic constriction injury-induced neuropathic pain model, the impact of rosmarinic acid on allodynia was investigated. Furthermore, the involvement of adrenergic and opioidergic mechanisms in its activity was assessed. To evaluate rosmarinic acid's efficacy, doses of 10, 20, and 40 mg/kg were administered and the electronic von Frey test was utilized along with an activity cage apparatus. % MPE values were calculated to gauge the extent of pain relief. Mechanistic insights were obtained by pretreating animals with the β-adrenergic receptor antagonist propranolol, the α1-adrenergic receptor antagonist prazosin, α2-adrenergic receptor antagonist yohimbine, and the opioid receptor antagonist naloxone. Rosmarinic acid demonstrated a statistically significant antiallodynic effect that was independent of locomotor activity. This effect was noteworthy as it resembled both the level and duration of relief provided by pregabalin. Additionally, the %MPE value of the group treated with 40 mg/kg rosmarinic acid showed a significant difference compared to the value of the pregabalin-treated group (P<0.001). Pre-administration of the antagonists revealed that the antiallodynic activity was shown to be mediated by the stimulation of opioid and adrenergic receptors, with a primary contribution from α2-adrenergic receptor stimulation. Our findings suggest that rosmarinic acid may hold promise as a potential therapeutic agent for neuropathic pain. By elucidating the involvement of adrenergic and opioidergic mechanisms, we have provided valuable preclinical data that could inform novel treatment approaches.",

The birds were fed a basal diet (Con group), a basal diet supplemented with 40 mg/kg Hes (Hes group), a basal diet supplemented with 40 mg/kg Thy (Thy group), a basal diet supplemented with 20 mg/kg RA (RA group), or a basal diet supplemented with 40 mg/kg Hes + 40 mg/kg Thy + 20 mg/kg RA (HTR group) for 42 d. The results indicated that dietary Hes and HTR supplementation enhanced average daily gain, final body weight, and eviscerated yield of broilers compared with the Con group (P < 0.05). Notably, the HTR treatment showed a decrease in abdominal fat yield and ratio of feed to weight gain (P < 0.05). HTR treatment increased ileal villus height, villus height/crypt depth, and number of goblet cells, decreased the crypt depth (P < 0.05), up-regulated the mRNA expression of tight junction proteins (ZO-1, Claudin-1, Occludin) and MUC2 (P < 0.05). Hes, Thy, RA, HTR treatment decreased the concentrations of pro-inflammatory factors (IL-8, IFN-γ and TNF-α), and down-regulated the mRNA expression of TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB (P < 0.05). Importantly, the supplementation of HTR increased the relative abundance of beneficial bacteria (Parabacteroides, Lachnosiraceae NK4A136 and Turicbacter) and significantly decreased the relative abundance of opportunistic pathogenic bacteria such as Colidextribacter (P < 0.05). Additionally, the concentrations of propionate and butyrate in the cecum were elevated in the HTR group (P < 0.05). These findings indicate that the diet supplemented with HTR improved the growth performance and intestinal barrier function in broilers by modulating the cecal microbiota and its metabolites.",

The abnormal expression of microRNA (miRNA) regulates the gene expression and plays a role as an oncogenic or tumor suppressor in TNBC. However, the biological role of RA in miR-30a-5p on BCL2L11 during MDA-MB-231 induced breast cancer stem-like cells (BCSCs) progression and its regulatory mechanism have not been elucidated. OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether RA inhibited the silencing effect of miR-30a-5p on the BCL2L11 gene and promoted apoptosis in BCSCs. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We assessed the migration, colony formation, proliferation, cell cycle, and apoptosis of BCSCs after RA treatment using the wound-healing assay, colony formation assay, CCK-8 assay, and flow cytometry, respectively. The expression of mRNA and protein levels of BCL-2, Bax, BCL2L11, and P53 genes in BCSCs after RA treatment was obtained by real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blot. Differential miRNA expression in BCSCs was analyzed by high-throughput sequencing. Targetscan was utilized to predict the targets of miR-30a-5p. The dual luciferase reporter system was used for validation of the miR-30a-5p target. RESULTS: Wound-healing assay, colony formation assay, CCK-8 assay, and cell cycle assay results showed that RA inhibited migration, colony formation and viability of BCSCs, and cell cycle arrest in the G0-G1 phase. At the highest dose of RA, we noticed cell atrophy, while the arrest rate at 100 μg/mL RA surpassed that at 200 μg/mL RA. Apoptotic cells appeared early (Membrane Associated Protein V FITC+, PI-) or late (Membrane Associated Protein V FITC+, PI+) upon administration of 200 μg/mL RA, Using high-throughput sequencing to compare the differences in miRNA expression, we detected downregulation of miR-30a-5p expression, and the results of dual luciferase reporter gene analysis indicated that BCL2L11 was a direct target of miR-30a-5p. CONCLUSION: RA inhibited the silencing effect of miR-30a-5p on the BCL2L11 gene and enhanced apoptosis in BCSCs."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Radiation-induced pulmonary fibrosis (RIPF) is a common complication after radiotherapy in thoracic cancer patients, and effective treatment methods are lacking. The purpose of this study was to investigate the protective effect of rosmarinic acid (RA) on RIPF in mice as well as the mechanism involved. METHODS: m7G-tRNA-seq and tRNA-seq analyses were conducted to identify m7G-modified tRNAs. Western blotting, immunohistochemistry, northwestern blotting, northern blotting, immunofluorescence, wound-healing assays and EdU experiments were performed to explore the molecular mechanism by which RA regulates fibroblast-to-myofibroblast transformation (FMT) by affecting the exosomes of lung epithelial cells. Ribo-seq and mRNA-seq analyses were used to explore the underlying target mRNAs. Seahorse assays and immunoprecipitation were carried out to elucidate the effects of RA on glycolysis and FMT processes via the regulation of 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-biphosphatase 3 (PFKFB3) acetylation. RESULTS: We found that RA had an antifibrotic effect on the lung tissues of RIPF model mice and inhibited the progression of FMT through exosomes derived from lung epithelial cells. Mechanistically, RA reduced the transcription and translation efficiency of sphingosine kinase 1 in lung fibroblasts by decreasing N7-methylguanosine modification of tRNA, downregulating the expression of tRNAs in irradiated lung epithelial cell-derived exosomes, and inhibiting the interaction between sphingosine kinase 1 and the N-acetyltransferase 10 protein in fibroblasts. Furthermore, the acetylation and cytoplasmic translocation of PFKFB3 were reduced by exosomes derived from irradiated lung epithelial cells, which following RA intervention. This suppression of the FMT process, which is triggered by glycolysis, and ultimately decelerating the progression of RIPF. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that RA is a potential therapeutic agent for RIPF."

      "abstract": "Magnetic drug delivery systems using nanoparticles present a promising opportunity for clinical treatment. This study explored the potential anti-inflammatory properties of RosA- CrFe2O4 nanoparticles. These nanoparticles were developed through rosmarinic acid (RosA) co-precipitation via a photo-mediated extraction technique. XRD, FTIR, and TEM techniques were employed to characterize the nanoparticles, and the results indicated that they had a cubic spinel ferrite (FCC) structure with an average particle size of 25nm. The anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties of RosA- CrFe2O4 nanoparticles were evaluated by using LPS-induced raw 264.7 macrophages and a hydrogen peroxide scavenging assay, respectively. The results showed that RosA- CrFe2O4 nanoparticles had moderate DPPH scavenging effects with an IC50 value of 59.61±4.52μg/ml. Notably, these nanoparticles effectively suppressed the expression of pro-inflammatory genes (IL-1β, TNF-α, IL-6, and iNOS) in LPS-stimulated cells. Additionally, the anti-inflammatory activity of RosA- CrFe2O4 nanoparticles was confirmed by reducing the release of secretory pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6 and TNF-α) in LPS-stimulated macrophages. This investigation highlights the promising potential of Phyto-mediated CrFe2O4-RosA as an anti-inflammatory and antioxidant agent in biomedical applications.",

On the other hand, drug resistance is recognized as the main cause of chemotherapeutic treatment failure. Rosmarinic acid (RA) is a polyphenol of the phenylpropanoid family that is widely distributed in plants and vegetables, including medicinal aromatic herbs, consumption of which has demonstrated beneficial activities as antioxidants and anti-inflammatories and reduced the risks of cancers. Recently, several studies have shown that RA is able to reverse cancer resistance to first-line chemotherapeutics, as well as play a protective role against toxicity induced by chemotherapy and radiotherapy, mainly due to its scavenger capacity. This review compiles information from 56 articles from Google Scholar, PubMed, and ClinicalTrials.gov aimed at addressing the role of RA as a complementary therapy in cancer treatment.",

Research has shown that rosmarinic acid (RA) is a promising phenolic compound with antineoplastic properties. Thus, we investigated the effects of RA on apoptosis-inducing in melanoma cells, purinergic signaling modulation, and cytokine levels. We treated SK-MEL-28 cells for 24 h with different concentrations of RA and assessed the apoptosis, CD39, CD73, and A2A expression, and cytokine levels. We found RA-induced apoptosis in melanoma cells. Regarding the purinergic system, we verified that RA downregulated the expression of CD73 and A2A, specially at high concentrations of treatment. Additionally, RA increased IL-6, IL-4, IL-10, IFN-γ, and TNF-α levels. Our in vitro results confirm RA's potential to be used to induce melanoma cell apoptosis, having CD73 and A2A as targets when reversion of immune suppression is desired. Further studies in animal models and clinical trials focusing on RA's modulation of purinergic signaling in melanoma are required."

Current DED therapies have shown restricted therapeutic effects such as frequent dosing and temporary relief with potential unwanted side effects, urgently necessitating the development of innovative efficient therapeutic approaches. Herein, we developed rosmarinic acid (RosA) conjugated gelatin nanogels loading diquafosol sodium (DQS), DRGNG, for simultaneous ROS-scavenging and mucin-secreting DED treatment. Mechanically, DRGNG suppressed the ROS production, reduced inflammatory factors, and prompted mucin secretion in vitro and in vivo. The whole transcriptome RNA sequencing in vitro further provided a detailed analysis of the upregulation of anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, and mucin-promotion pathways. Therapeutically, both in evaporative DED and aqueous deficient DED models, the dual-functional DRGNG could prolong the retention time at the ocular surface, efficiently suppress the oxidative stress response, reverse ocular surface morphology, and recover tear film homeostasis, thus alleviating the DED when the dosage is halved compared to the commercial Diquas®. Our findings contribute to developing innovative therapies for DED and offer insights into the broader applications of nanogels in ocular drug delivery and oxidative stress-related conditions.",

PURPOSE: To investigate the potential neuroprotective effects of Rosmarinic acid (RosA) encapsulated within nanoliposomes (RosA-LIP) on ischemic stroke. METHODS: Wild-type (WT) and TfR1EC cKO (specific knockout of the TfR1 gene in BMECs) mice used to establish a dMCAO model, with simultaneous administration of RosA-LIP (20 mg/kg/d, i.p.) or RosA (20 mg/kg/d, i.p.). RESULTS: The successful synthesis of RosA-LIP resulted in enhanced stability and precise delivery in both the serum and brain. The administration of RosA-LIP effectively mitigated ischemia-induced behavioral abnormalities and pathological damage. RosA-LIP inhibited ferroptosis by ameliorating mitochondrial abnormalities, increasing GPX4 levels, and decreasing ACSL4/LPCAT3/Lox-dependent lipid peroxidation. RosA-LIP effectively improved blood‒brain barrier (BBB) permeability, increased tight junctions (TJs) protein expression and reduced iron levels in ischemic tissue and brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMECs) by modulating FPN1 and TfR1 levels. Furthermore, RosA-LIP suppressed TfR1 to attenuate ACSL4/LPCAT3/Lox-mediated ferroptosis in TfR1EC cKO mice subjected to dMCAO. CONCLUSION: RosA-LIP effectively increased the brain level of RosA and protected against ferroptosis through the regulation of TfR1 in BMECs.",

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Asthma was induced in rats using ovalbumin injection and inhalation. The study assessed lung inflammation, pathological changes, and oxidative stress in control, untreated asthmatic rats and three treatment groups. These groups received M. officinalis extract (50, 100, 200 mg/kg), RA (0.5, 1, 2 mg/kg), or dexamethasone (Dex) 1 mg/kg. RESULTS: In the sensitized group, white blood cell counts, malondialdehyde, and nitrite levels increased significantly, while thiol levels and the activity of superoxide dismutase and catalase decreased (p<0.001). However, all treatment groups with the extract, RA, and Dex showed a significant reduction in total white blood cells, eosinophils, monocytes, malondialdehyde, and nitrite levels compared to the asthma group (p<0.001 in all groups). Thiol levels and catalase and superoxide dismutase activity were significantly higher in all treated groups with RA and high extract doses (p<0.001). Lung pathological changes were also significantly less severe in the treated groups with dexamethasone, plant extract, and RA compared to the asthma group (p<0.05 to p<0.001). CONCLUSION: This study showed that M. officinalis and RA have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects in an animal asthma model, suggesting their potential for treating asthma symptoms."

To address potential challenges in the future, the continued development of effective drugs targeting SARS-CoV-2 remains an important task for the scientific as well as the pharmaceutical community. The main protease (Mpro) of SARS-CoV-2 is an ideal therapeutic target for COVID-19 drug development, leading to the introduction of various inhibitors, both covalent and non-covalent, each characterized by unique mechanisms of action and possessing inherent strengths and limitations. Natural products, being compounds naturally present in the environment, offer advantages such as low toxicity and diverse activities, presenting a viable source for antiviral drug development. Here, we identified a natural compound, rosmarinic acid, which exhibits significant inhibitory effects on the Mpro of the SARS-CoV-2. Through detailed structural biology analysis, we elucidated the precise crystal structure of the complex formed between rosmarinic acid and SARS-CoV-2 Mpro, revealing the molecular basis of its inhibitory mechanism. These findings not only enhance our understanding of the antiviral action of rosmarinic acid, but also provide valuable structural information and mechanistic insights for the further development of therapeutic strategies against SARS-CoV-2.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Rosmarinic acid (RA) has a wide range of beneficial effects on human health. On the other hand, RA has been reported to induce metal-mediated reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and DNA damage. However, its mechanism remains unknown. In this study, to clarify the underlying mechanism, we analyzed metal-mediated DNA damage in isolated DNA treated with RA and its analog isorinic acid. RESULTS: RA plus Cu(II), but not Fe(III), significantly increased 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-oxodG) formation, an indicator of oxidative DNA damage, in calf thymus DNA. Furthermore, a comparison of the 8-oxodG formation induced by RA and its analog isorinic acid suggested that the catechol groups in RA could be associated with their abilities to form 8-oxodG. Interestingly, the 8-oxodG formation induced by RA and isorinic acid plus Cu(II) was markedly enhanced by the addition of NADH, an endogenous reductant. To elucidate the mechanism of RA plus Cu(II)-induced oxidative DNA damage, we examined DNA damage in 32P-labeled DNA treated with RA in the presence of Cu(II). RA plus Cu(II) caused DNA cleavage, which was enhanced by piperidine treatment, suggesting that RA causes not only DNA strand breakage but also base modification. RA plus Cu(II)-induced DNA damage was inhibited by catalase (H2O2 scavenger), bathocuproine (Cu(I) chelator), and methional (scavenger of a variety of ROS other than •OH) but not by typical •OH scavengers and SOD, indicating the involvement of H2O2, Cu(I), and ROS other than •OH. DNA cleavage site analysis showing RA-induced site-specific DNA damage (frequently at thymine and some cytosine residues) supports the involvement of ROS other than •OH, because •OH causes DNA cleavage without site specificity. Based on these results, Cu(I) and H2O2 generation with concomitant RA autoxidation could lead to the production of Cu(I)-hydroperoxide, which induces oxidative DNA damage. o-Quinone and o-semiquinone radicals are likely to be again reduced to RA by NADH, which dramatically increases oxidative DNA damage, particularly at low concentrations of RA. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, physiologically relevant concentrations of RA effectively induced oxidative DNA damage in isolated DNA through redox cycle reactions with copper and NADH."

Rosmarinic acid (RosA) is an active ingredient of natural products with anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects. This study aimed to investigate the role of RosA in inhibiting autophagy-regulated immune cells-CD8+ T cells via the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK signaling pathway in a CT-infected mouse model. Mice were inoculated with CT infection solution vaginally, and the mechanistic basis of RosA treatment was established using H&E staining, flow cytometry, immunofluorescence, transmission electron microscopy, and western blot. The key factors involved in RosA treatment were further validated using the MEK inhibitor cobimetinib. Experimental results showed that both RosA and the reference drug azithromycin could attenuate the pathological damage to the endometrium caused by CT infection; flow cytometry showed that peripheral blood CD8+ T cells increased after CT infection and decreased after treatment with RosA and the positive drug azithromycin (positive control); immunofluorescence showed that endometrial CD8 and LC3 increased after CT infection and decreased after RosA and positive drug treatment; the results of transmission electron microscopy showed that RosA and the positive drug azithromycin inhibited the accumulation of autophagosomes; western bolt experiments confirmed the activation of autophagy proteins LC3Ⅱ/Ⅰ, ATG5, Beclin-1, and p62 after CT infection, as well as the inhibition of Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK signaling. RosA and azithromycin inhibition of autophagy proteins activates Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK signaling. In addition, the MEK inhibitor cobimetinib attenuated RosA's protective effect on endometrium by further activating CD8+ T cells on a CT-induced basis, while transmission electron microscopy, immunofluorescence, and western blots showed that cobimetinib blocked ERK signals activation and further induced phagocytosis on a CT-induced basis. These data indicated that RosA can activate the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK signaling pathway to inhibit autophagy, and RosA could also regulate the activation of immune cells-CD8+T cells to protect the reproductive tract of CT-infected mice.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The Chikungunya virus is an Alphavirus that belongs to the Togaviridae family and is primarily transmitted by mosquitoes. It causes acute infection characterized by fever, headache, and arthralgia. Some patients also experience persistent chronic osteoarthritis-like symptoms. Dedicated antiviral treatments are currently unavailable for CHIKV. This study aims to explore the potential anti-CHIKV effect of rosmarinic acid using network pharmacology. METHODS: This study employed network pharmacology to predict and verify the molecular targets and pathways associated with ROSA in the context of CHIKV. The analysis outcomes were further validated using molecular docking and in vitro experiments. RESULTS: The analysis of CHIKV targets using the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes and MCODE identified IL-17 as an important pathogenic pathway in CHIKV infection. Among the 30 targets of ROSA against CHIKV, nearly half were found to be involved in the IL-17 signaling pathway. This suggests that ROSA may help the host in resisting CHIKV invasion by modulating this pathway. Molecular docking validation results showed that ROSA can stably bind to 10 core targets out of the 30 identified targets. In an in vitro CHIKV infection model developed using 293T cells, treatment with 60 μM ROSA significantly improved the survival rate of infected cells, inhibited 50% CHIKV proliferation after CHIKV infection, and reduced the expression of TNF-α in the IL-17 signaling pathway. CONCLUSION: This study provides the first confirmation of the efficacy of ROSA in suppressing CHIKV infection through the IL-17 signaling pathway. The findings warrant further investigation to facilitate the development of ROSA as a potential treatment for CHIKV infection.",

      "abstract": "We previously reported that rosmarinic acid (RA) ameliorated renal fibrosis in a unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) murine model of chronic kidney disease. This study aimed to determine whether RA attenuates indoxyl sulfate (IS)-induced renal fibrosis by regulating the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome/IL-1β/Smad circuit. We discovered the NLRP3 inflammasome was activated in the IS treatment group and downregulated in the RA-treated group in a dose-dependent manner. Additionally, the downstream effectors of the NLRP3 inflammasome, cleaved-caspase-1 and cleaved-IL-1β showed similar trends in different groups. Moreover, RA administration significantly decreased the ROS levels of reactive oxygen species in IS-treated cells. Our data showed that RA treatment significantly inhibited Smad-2/3 phosphorylation. Notably, the effects of RA on NLRP3 inflammasome/IL-1β/Smad and fibrosis signaling were reversed by the siRNA-mediated knockdown of NLRP3 or caspase-1 in NRK-52E cells. In vivo, we demonstrated that expression levels of NLRP3, c-caspase-1, c-IL-1β, collagen I, fibronectin and α-SMA, and TGF- β 1 were downregulated after treatment of UUO mice with RA or RA + MCC950. Our findings suggested RA and MCC950 synergistically inhibited UUO-induced NLRP3 signaling activation, revealing their renoprotective properties and the potential for combinatory treatment of renal fibrosis and chronic kidney inflammation.",

      "abstract": "Currently, chemotherapy is one of the most practiced approaches for the treatment of cancers. However, existing chemotherapeutic drugs have poor aqueous solubility, poor selectivity, higher systematic toxicity, and poor target accumulation. In this study, we designed and synthesized a boronic acid/ester-based pH-responsive nano-valve that specifically targets the microenvironment in cancer cells. The nano-valve comprises phenylboronic acid-coated mesoporous silica nanoparticles (B-MSN) loaded with polyphenolic compound Rosmarinic acid (ROS-B-MSN). The nano-valve was further coated with lignin (LIG) to achieve our desired LIG-ROS-BMSN nano-valve for targeted chemotherapy against Hep-G2 and NCI-H460 cell lines. The structure and properties of NPs were characterized by Fourier-transformed infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) in combination with EDX, and Dynamic light scattering (DLS). The outcomes revealed that the designed LIG-ROS-BMSN were in the nanorange (144.1 ± 0.70 nm), had negative Zeta potential (-15.7 ± 0.46 mV) and had a nearly spherical morphology. In vitro, drug release investigations showed a controlled pH-dependent release profile under mild acidic conditions that could enhance the targeted chemotherapeutic response against cancer in mild acidic environments. The obtained LIG-ROS-BMSN nano valve achieved significantly lower IC50 values of (1.70 ± 0.01 μg/mL and 3.25 ± 0.14 μg/mL) against Hep-G2 and NCI-H460 cell lines as compared to ROS alone, which was (14.0 ± 0.7 μg/mL and 29.10 ± 0.25 μg/mL), respectively. The cellular morphology before and after treatment was further confirmed via inverted microscopy. The outcomes of the current study imply that our designed LIG-ROS-BMSN nanovalve is a potential carrier for cancer chemotherapeutics.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: In brain tumors, the complexity of the pathophysiological processes such as oxidative stress, cell proliferation, angiogenesis, and apoptosis have seriously challenged the definitive treatment. Rosmarinic acid (RA), as a polyphenolic compound, has been found to prevent tumor progression in some aggressive cancers. This study was designed to evaluate the anticancer effects of RA on brain tumors. METHOD: Rats were divided into six groups. Implantation of C6 glioma cells was carried out in the caudate nucleus of the right hemisphere. RA at doses of 5, 10, and 20 mg/kg (i.p.) was administered to the treatment groups for seven days. Tumor volume (by MRI imaging), locomotor ability, survival time, histological alterations (by H & E staining), expression of p53 and p21 mRNAs (by RT-PCR), activities of antioxidant enzymes (superoxide dismutase [SOD] and catalase [CAT] by assay kits), expression of caspase-3 and VEGF (by immunohistochemical analysis), and TUNEL-positive cells (by tunnel staining) were analyzed. RESULTS: The results indicated that the RA at a dose of 20 mg/kg reduced the tumor volume, prolonged survival time, increased p53 and p21 mRNAs, attenuated SOD and CAT activities in tumor tissue, elevated caspase-3, and increased the number of TUNEL-positive cells. Furthermore, histological analysis revealed less invasion of tumor cells into the normal parenchyma in rats treated with RA (20 mg/kg). CONCLUSION: These findings provide evidence that the ability of RA to reduce tumor volume could be related to factors that modulate oxidative stress (SOD and CAT enzymes), cell proliferation (p53 and p21), and apoptosis (caspase-3).",

METHODS: This multicenter randomized double-blind placebo-controlled phase 2 trial included 110 solid malignant tumor patients (stage II-IV) undergoing chemotherapy. They were randomly selected and provided oral Nuvastatic™ 1000 mg (N = 56) or placebo (N = 54) thrice daily for 9 weeks. The primary outcomes were fatigue (Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI)) and Visual Analog Scale for Fatigue (VAS-F)) scores measured before and after intervention at baseline and weeks 3, 6, and 9. The secondary outcomes were mean group difference in the vitality subscale of the Medical Outcome Scale Short Form-36 (SF-36) and urinary F2-isoprostane concentration (an oxidative stress biomarker), Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group scores, adverse events, and biochemical and hematologic parameters. Analysis was performed by intention-to-treat (ITT). Primary and secondary outcomes were assessed by two-way repeated-measures analysis of variance (mixed ANOVA). RESULTS: The Nuvastatic™ group exhibited an overall decreased fatigue score compared with the placebo group. Compared with the placebo group, the Nuvastatic™ group significantly reduced BFI-fatigue (BFI fatigue score, F (1.4, 147) = 16.554, p < 0.001, partial η2 = 0.333). The Nuvastatic™ group significantly reduced VAS-F fatigue (F (2, 210) = 9.534, p < 0.001, partial η2 = 0.083), improved quality of life (QoL) (F (1.2, 127.48) = 34.07, p < 0.001, partial η2 = 0.243), and lowered urinary F2-IsoP concentrations (mean difference (95% CI) = 55.57 (24.84, 86.30)), t (55) = 3.624, p < 0.001, Cohen's d (95% CI) = 0.48 (0.20, 0.75)). Reported adverse events were vomiting (0.9%), fever (5.4%), and headache (2.7%). CONCLUSION: Nuvastatic™ is potentially an effective adjuvant for CRF management in solid tumor patients and worthy of further investigation in larger trials.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Myoglobin (Mb) induced death of renal tubular epithelial cells (RTECs) is a major pathological factor in crush syndrome-related acute kidney injury (CS-AKI). It is unclear whether ferroptosis is involved and could be a target for treatment. PURPOSE: This study aimed to evaluate the potential therapeutic effects of combining the natural small molecule rosemarinic acid (RA) and the iron chelator deferasirox (Dfe) on CS-AKI through inhibition of ferroptosis. METHODS: Sequencing data were downloaded from the GEO database, and differential expression analysis was performed using the R software limma package. The CS-AKI mouse model was constructed by squeezing the bilateral thighs of mice for 16 h with 1.5 kg weight. TCMK1 and NRK-52E cells were induced with 200 μM Mb and then treated with RA combined with Dfe (Dfe + RA, both were 10 μM). Functional and pathological changes in mouse kidney were evaluated by glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and HE pathology. Immunofluorescence assay was used to detect Mb levels in kidney tissues. The expression levels of ACSL4, GPX4, Keap1, and Nrf2 were analyzed by WB. RESULTS: We found that AKI mice in the GSE44925 cohort highly expressed the ferroptosis markers ACSL4 and PTGS2. CS-AKI mice showed a rapid decrease in GFR, up-regulation of ACSL4 expression in kidney tissue, and down-regulation of GPX4 expression, indicating activation of the ferroptosis pathway. Mb was found to deposit in renal tubules, and it has been proven to cause ferroptosis in TCMK1 and NRK-52E cells in vitro. We found that Dfe had a strong iron ion scavenging effect and inhibited ACSL4 expression. RA could disrupt the interaction between Keap1 andNrf2, stabilize Nrf2, and promote its nuclear translocation, thereby exerting antioxidant effects. The combination of Dfe and RA effectively reversed Mb induced ferroptosis in RTECs. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, we found that RA combined with Dfe attenuated CS-AKI by inhibiting Mb-induced ferroptosis in RTECs via activating the Nrf2/Keap1 pathway.",

Rosmarinic acid (RA), an excellent antioxidant, exhibits neuroprotective activity, but its anti-NDs efficacy remains puzzling. Here, Caenorhabditis elegans models were employed to systematically reveal RA-mediated mechanisms in delaying NDs from diverse facets, including oxidative stress, the homeostasis of neural and protein, and mitochondrial disorders. Firstly, RA significantly inhibited reactive oxygen species accumulation, reduced peroxide malonaldehyde production, and strengthened the antioxidant defense system via increasing superoxide dismutase activity. Besides, RA reduced neuronal loss and ameliorated polyglutamine and ɑ-synuclein-mediated dyskinesia in NDs models. Further, in combination with the data and molecular docking results, RA may bind specifically to Huntington protein and ɑ-synuclein to prevent toxic protein aggregation and thus enhance proteostasis. Finally, RA ameliorated mitochondrial dysfunction including increasing adenosine triphosphate and mitochondrial membrane potential levels and rescuing mitochondrial membrane proteins' expressions and mitochondrial structural abnormalities via regulating mitochondrial dynamics genes and improving the mitochondrial kinetic homeostasis. Thus, this study systematically revealed the RA-mediated neuroprotective mechanism and promoted RA as a promising nutritional intervention strategy to prevent NDs.",

      "abstract": "This study describes a simple, cost-effective, and eco-friendly method for synthesizing silver nanoparticles using a rosmarinic acid extract from Perilla frutescens (PFRAE) as the bioreduction agent. The resulting nanoparticles, called PFRAE-AgNPs, were characterized using various analytical techniques. The UV-Vis spectrum confirmed the formation of PFRAE-AgNPs, and the FTIR spectrum indicated the participation of rosmarinic acid in their synthesis and stabilization. The XRD pattern revealed the crystal structure of PFRAE-AgNPs, and the TEM analysis showed their spherical morphology with sizes ranging between 20 and 80 nm. The DLS analysis indicated that PFRAE-AgNPs were monodispersed with an average diameter of 44.0 ± 3.2 nm, and the high negative zeta potential (-19.65 mV) indicated their high stability. In the antibacterial assays, the PFRAE-AgNPs showed potent activity against both Gram-positive (Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus) and Gram-negative (Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) bacterial pathogens, suggesting that they could be used as a potential antibacterial agent in the clinical setting. Moreover, the antioxidant activity of PFRAE-AgNPs against DPPH and ABTS radical scavengers highlights their potential in the treatment of various oxidative stress-related diseases. PFRAE-AgNPs also demonstrated significant anticancer activity against a range of cell lines including human colon cancer (COLO205), human prostate carcinoma (PC-3), human lung adenocarcinoma (A549), and human ovarian cancer (SKOV3) cell lines suggesting their potential in cancer therapy. The nanoparticles may also have potential in drug delivery, as their small size and high stability could enable them to cross biological barriers and deliver drugs to specific target sites. In addition to the aforementioned properties, PFRAE-AgNPs were found to be biocompatible towards normal (CHO) cells, which is a crucial characteristic for their application in cancer therapy and drug delivery systems. Their antibacterial, antioxidant, and anticancer properties make them promising candidates for the development of new therapeutic agents. Furthermore, their small size, high stability, and biocompatibility could enable them to be used in drug delivery systems to enhance drug efficacy and reduce side effects.",

Detailed characterization of the fabricated fibrous CA/RA and CA/PEG/RA materials was performed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD), UV-Vis spectroscopy and water contact angle analysis. The optimal ratio between CA, RA and PEG for preparation of defect-free and uniform fibers was accomplished by varying their concentrations. Furthermore, the incorporation of the PEG improved the hydrophilicity and wettability of the fibrous CA materials. Moreover, PEG facilitated the RA release and over 360 min, the amount released from fibrous CA/PEG/RA fibers was 91%, while that released from CA/RA materials was 53%. Both of the RA-containing fibrous materials, with and without PEG, manifested high antioxidant activity as determined by the DPPH free radical-scavenging method. In addition, the electrospun CA/PEG/RA materials displayed good antifungal activity against C. albicans. These features make the fibrous CA/PEG/RA materials promising candidates for treatment of wound infections."

      "abstract": "Rosmarinic acid (RA) is an important medicinal metabolite and a potent food antioxidant. We discovered that exposure to high light intensifies the accumulation of RA in the leaves of perilla (Perilla frutescens (L.) Britt). However, the molecular mechanism underlying RA synthesis in response to high light stress remains poorly understood. To address this knowledge gap, we conducted a comprehensive analysis employing transcriptomic sequencing, transcriptional activation, and genetic transformation techniques. High light treatment for 1 and 48 h resulted in the upregulation of 592 and 1,060 genes, respectively. Among these genes, three structural genes and 93 transcription factors exhibited co-expression. Notably, NAC family member PfNAC2, GBF family member PfGBF3, and cinnamate-4-hydroxylase gene PfC4H demonstrated significant co-expression and upregulation under high light stress. Transcriptional activation analysis revealed that PfGBF3 binds to and activates the PfNAC2 promoter. Additionally, both PfNAC2 and PfGBF3 bind to the PfC4H promoter, thereby positively regulating PfC4H expression. Transient overexpression of PfNAC2, PfGBF3, and PfC4H, as well as stable transgenic expression of PfNAC2, led to a substantial increase in RA accumulation in perilla. Consequently, PfGBF3 acts as a photosensitive factor that positively regulates PfNAC2 and PfC4H, while PfNAC2 also regulates PfC4H to promote RA accumulation under high light stress. The elucidation of the regulatory mechanism governing RA accumulation in perilla under high light conditions provides a foundation for developing a high-yield RA system and a model to understand light-induced metabolic accumulation.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Asthma affects 3% of the global population, leading to over 0.25 million deaths. Due to its complexity, asthma is difficult to cure or prevent, and current therapies have limitations. This has led to a growing demand for alternative asthma treatments. We found rosmarinic acid (RosA) as a potential new drug candidate from natural medicine. However, RosA has poor bioavailability and remains mainly in the gastrointestinal tract after oral administration, suggesting the involvement of gut microbiota in its bioactivity. PURPOSE: To investigate the mechanism of RosA in alleviating allergic asthma by gut-lung axis. METHODS: We used 16S rRNA gene sequencing and metabolites analysis to investigate RosA's modulation of gut microbiota. Techniques of molecular biology and metabolomics were employed to study the pharmacological mechanism of RosA. Cohousing was used to confirm the involvement of gut microbiota in RosA-induced improvement of allergic asthma. RESULTS: RosA decreased cholate levels from spore-forming bacteria, leading to reduced 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) synthesis, bronchoconstriction, vasodilation, and inflammatory cell infiltration. It also increased short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) levels, facilitating the expression of intestinal tight junction proteins to promote intestinal integrity. SCFAs upregulated intestinal monocarboxylate transporters (MCTs), thereby improving their systemic delivery to reduce Th2/ILC2 mediated inflammatory response and suppress eosinophil influx and mucus production in lung. Additionally, RosA inhibited lipopolysaccharide (LPS) production and translocation, leading to reduced TLR4-NFκB mediated pulmonary inflammation and oxidative stress. CONCLUSIONS: The anti-asthmatic mechanism of oral RosA is primarily driven by modulation of gut microbiota-derived 5-HT, SCFAs, and LPS, achieving a combined synergistic effect. RosA is a safe, effective, and reliable drug candidate that could potentially replace glucocorticoids for asthma treatment.",

The purpose of this narrative review is to discuss the antifibrotic effects of rosmarinic acid (RA) and plant extracts that contain RA, as observed in various experimental models. RA, as well as the extracts of Glechoma hederacea, Melissa officinalis, Elsholtzia ciliata, Lycopus lucidus, Ocimum basilicum, Prunella vulgaris, Salvia rosmarinus (Rosmarinus officinalis), Salvia miltiorrhiza, and Perilla frutescens, have been shown to attenuate fibrosis of the liver, kidneys, heart, lungs, and abdomen in experimental animal models. Their antifibrotic effects were associated with the attenuation of oxidative stress, inflammation, cell activation, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and fibrogenic gene expression. RA treatment activated peroxisomal proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ), 5' AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), and nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2) while suppressing the transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) and Wnt signaling pathways. Interestingly, most plants that are reported to contain RA and exhibit antifibrotic activity belong to the family Lamiaceae. This suggests that RA is an active ingredient for the antifibrotic effect of Lamiaceae plants and that these plants are a useful source of RA. In conclusion, accumulating scientific evidence supports the effectiveness of RA and Lamiaceae plant extracts in alleviating fibrosis and maintaining the structural architecture and normal functions of various organs under pathological conditions."

Data on the pharmacokinetics of RA are lacking in cases of the chronic use of supplements containing this compound, and only limited data on the metabolism and distribution of RA are available. The aim of the study was to investigate the plasma levels of RA after 12 weeks of use and determine potential interactions of RA and selected antiretroviral drugs. Patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus took a supplement containing RA for 12 weeks, after which the RA concentrations in the plasma samples were analyzed. A detailed in silico analysis was conducted in order to elucidate the potential interactions between RA and the drugs efavirenz, darunavir and raltegravir. It was found that RA can be detected in patients' plasma samples, mainly in the form of sulphoglucuronide. The potential interactions are suggested on the level of liver metabolizing enzymes and efflux P-glycoprotein, with RA competing with antiretroviral drugs as a substrate in metabolism and distribution systems. The present study suggests that the simultaneous use of RA and antiretroviral therapy (containing efavirenz, darunavir or raltegravir) may affect the plasma levels of RA after prolonged supplementation.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Acrylamide (ACR) is a widely used compound that is known to be neurotoxic to both experimental animals and humans, causing nerve damage. The widespread presence of ACR in the environment and food means that the toxic risk to human health can no longer be ignored. Rosmarinic acid (RA), a natural polyphenolic compound extracted from the perilla plant, exhibits anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and other properties. It has also been demon strated to possess promising potential in neuroprotection. However, its role and potential mechanism in treating ACR induced neurotoxicity are still elusive. PURPOSE: This study explores whether RA can improve ACR induced neurotoxicity and its possible mechanism. METHODS: The behavioral method was used to study RA effect on ACR exposed mice's neurological function. We studied its potential mechanism through metabolomics, Nissl staining, HE staining, immunohistochemical analysis, and Western blot. RESULTS: RA pretreatment reversed the increase in mouse landing foot splay and decrease in spontaneous activity caused by 3 weeks of exposure to 50 mg/kg/d ACR. Further experiments demonstrated that RA could prevent ACR induced neuronal apoptosis, significantly downregulate nuclear factor-κB and tumor necrosis factor-α expression, and inhibit NOD-like receptor protein 3 inflammasome activation, thereby reducing inflammation as confirmed by metabolomics results. Additionally, RA treatment prevented endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) caused by ACR exposure, as evidenced by the reversal of significant P-IRE1α,TRAF2,CHOP expression increase. CONCLUSION: RA alleviates ACR induced neurotoxicity by inhibiting ERS and inflammation. These results provide a deeper understanding of the mechanism of ACR induced neurotoxicity and propose a potential new treatment method.",

However, its side effects, particularly nephrotoxicity, are limiting factors in its clinic use. Rosmarinic acid (RA), a natural antioxidant compound, is reported to attenuate oxidative stress and associated pathophysiological outcomes. Our study aimed to explore the protective effect of RA against CP-induced acute kidney injury (AKI). MATERIALS AND METHODS: We investigated the effect of RA at the dose of 100 mg/kg on AKI induced by CP (20 mg/kg) in mice. Various parameters of nephrotoxicity such as levels of serum electrolytes, albumin, and globulin were measured using standardized methods. Besides, a specific biomarker of damage to proximal tubular cells, kidney injury molecule-1 (Kim-1), was measured in the serum by ELISA. mRNA expression of Kim-1 and a transmembrane transporter, copper transporter 1 (Ctr1), was analyzed by quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. CTR1 expression was also analyzed by western blot technique. RESULTS: RA treatment restored the downregulated CTR1 , a renal transmembrane transporter in CP-treated mice. It was accompanied by a reduction in the level of serum albumin and globulin. Serum electrolytes such as Na+, K+, and Ca2+ in CP-treated mice were found to be restored with RA treatment. Moreover, RA also significantly downregulated the increased expression of nephrotoxicity biomarker KIM-1. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, RA proved to be an effective nephroprotective compound which afforded protection at cellular and subcellular levels with an appreciable modulatory effect on a transmembrane transporter.",

METHODS: Ovarian adenocarcinoma cell line (OVCAR3) and human skin keratinocyte cell line human skin keratinocyte cell line (HaCaT) were used as control. (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) test was applied to determine the effect of RA and DOX on the proliferation of OVCAR3 and HaCaT cells. Bcl2 expression and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and western blot analysis were performed to determine the expression levels of the markers. RESULTS: It was determined that RA (IC50 = 437.6 μM) and DOX (IC50 = 0.08 μM) have the ability to inhibit the proliferation of OVCAR3 cells and induce apoptosis in a 72-hour time and dose-dependent manner. Western blot showed that the expression level of Bcl-2 and EGFR in OVCAR3 cells was down-regulated by RA and DOX. CONCLUSIONS: Apoptosis in OVCAR3 cells can potentially be induced by RA via the EGFR pathway, and RA may be a potent agent for cancer therapy.",

In this study, rosmarinic acid (RA) is used as an anti-inflammatory agent that encapsulates in exosomes and is used to attenuate lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced endometritis and improve implantation. For this purpose, exosomes were loaded with RA and then administrated into the animal groups, including RA, exosome, RA plus exosome (RA + Exo), and RA-loaded exosomes (RALExo) groups. The concentrations of RA or exosomes used in this study were 10 mg/kg, and the compounds were injected into the uterine horn 24 h following the induction of endometritis. Upon the presence of inflammation detected by the histopathological method, the most proper groups were mated with male mice. The effect of the treatment group on the implantation rate, progesterone levels, and gene expressions were assessed by Chicago Blue staining, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and Quantitative PCR (qPCR), respectively. Results showed RALExo10 and RA10 + Exo10 groups improved pathological alterations, enhanced progesterone levels, increased implantation rate, as well as heightened expression levels of Leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and Mucin-16 (MUC-16) genes.

METHODS AND RESULTS: Hereon, we investigated the anti-allergic activity of RA on immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated anaphylaxis responses in rat basophilic leukemia (RBL)-2H3 mast cell. RA hindered the morphological changes of IgE-induced degranulated RBL-2H3 cells. The release of two key biomarkers (β-hexosaminidase (β-HEX) and histamine) of IgE-induced degranulated mast cells was also remarkably down-regulated by RA intervention in a dose dependent manner. Moreover, RA inhibited IgE-induced ROS overproduction and flux of intracellular Ca2+ in IgE-mediated degranulated mast cells. The q-PCR analysis showed that the expressions of genes (COX 2, PGD 2, LTC 4, HDC, Nrf2, HO-1 and NQO1) involved in MAPK and oxidative stress signaling pathways were significantly regulated by RA intervention. Moreover, the degranulation inhibitory effect of rosmarinic acid was investigated on the anti-DNP IgE/DNP-HSA induced passive cutaneous anaphylaxis (PCA) mice model in vivo. It showed that RA significantly inhibited the PCA reaction and allergic edema of ears in anti-DNP IgE/DNP-HSA stimulated mice. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that RA has the potential to be used as a therapeutic candidate for allergic diseases by inhibiting mast cell degranulation. This indicates a possible role for RA in managing allergic reactions and related conditions.",

      "abstract": "Rosmarinic acid (RA) is a phenolic ester that protects human keratinocytes against oxidative damage induced by ultraviolet B (UVB) exposure, however, the mechanisms underlying its effects remain unclear. This study aimed to elucidate the cell signaling mechanisms that regulate the antioxidant activity of RA and confirm its cyto-protective role. To explore the signaling mechanisms, we used the human keratinocyte cell line HaCaT and SKH1 hairless mouse skin. RA enhanced glutamate-cysteine ligase catalytic subunit (GCLC) and glutathione synthetase (GSS) expression in HaCaT cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Moreover, RA induced nuclear factor erythroid-2-related factor 2 (NRF2) nuclear translocation and activated the signaling kinases protein kinase B (AKT) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK). Treatment with the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor LY294002, the ERK inhibitor U0126, and small interfering RNA (siRNA) gene silencing suppressed RA-enhanced GCLC, GSS, and NRF2 expression, respectively. Cell viability tests showed that RA significantly prevented UVB-induced cell viability decrease, whereas the glutathione (GSH) inhibitors buthionine sulfoximine, LY294002, and U0126 significantly reduced this effect. Moreover, RA protected against DNA damage and protein carbonylation, lipid peroxidation, and apoptosis caused by UVB-induced oxidative stress in a concentration-dependent manner in SKH1 hairless mouse skin tissues. These results suggest that RA protects against UVB-induced oxidative damage by activating AKT and ERK signaling to regulate NRF2 signaling and enhance GSH biosynthesis. Thus, RA treatment may be a promising approach to protect the skin from UVB-induced oxidative damage."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Electromagnetic radiation (EMR) causes stable aggregation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), producing oxidative stress. Rosmarinic acid (RA), a plant-origin antioxidant, has been proposed against the side effects of cell phone and ultrahigh-frequency waves. METHODS: Forty-two male Wistar rats were randomly divided into 6 groups. Group 1 (controls) received 5 mL of normal saline with the gavage method, Group 2 received 915 MHz radiation, Group 3 received 2450 MHz radiation, Group 4 received RA plus 915 MHz radiation, Group 5 received RA plus 2450MHz radiation, and Group 6 received oral RA (5 mg/kg). Treatment and radiation (1 hour per day) continued for up to 30 days. RESULTS: EMR significantly reduced the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and glutathione peroxidase (GPx), the content of glutathione (GSH), and the level of total antioxidant capacity (TAC) and significantly increased oxidative stress indices, such as the levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) and nitric oxide (NO), and the content of protein carbonyl (PC). In contrast, RA significantly elevated TAC level (all groups), GSH content (the RA/cell phone radiation group), GPx activity (the RA/ultrahigh-frequency radiation group), SOD activity (all groups), and CAT activity (RA/ultrahigh-frequency radiation group) and conversely reduced MDA level (all groups), NO level (all groups), and PC content (all groups) in the RA/cell phone and RA/ultrahigh-frequency radiation groups compared with the NS/cell phone and NS/ultrahigh-frequency radiation groups, respectively. The administration of RA resulted in a significant reversal of cardiac markers in EMR-intoxicated rats. CONCLUSION: RA treatment showed a significant protective effect against EMR-induced cardiotoxicity."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Rosmarinic acid (RA) possesses promising anticancer potential, but further development of chemotherapeutic agents is hindered by their toxicity to off-target tissue. In particular, chemotherapy-related anemia is a major obstacle in cancer therapy, which may be aggravated by hemolysis and eryptosis. This work presents a toxicity assessment of RA in human RBCs and explores associated molecular mechanisms. METHODS: RBCs isolated from healthy donors were treated with anticancer concentrations of RA (10-800 μM) for 24 h at 37 °C, and hemolysis and related markers were photometrically measured. Flow cytometry was used to detect canonical markers of eryptosis, including phosphatidylserine (PS) exposure by annexin-V-FITC, intracellular Ca2+ by Fluo4/AM, cell size by FSC, and oxidative stress by H2DCFDA. Ions and pH were assessed by an ion-selective electrode, while B12 was detected by chemiluminescence. RESULTS: RA elicited concentration-dependent hemolysis with AST and LDH release but rescued the cells from hypotonic lysis at sub-hemolytic concentrations. RA also significantly increased annexin-V-positive cells, which was ameliorated by extracellular Ca2+ removal and isosmotic sucrose. Furthermore, a significant increase in Fluo4-positive cells and B12 content and a decrease in FSC and extracellular pH with KCl efflux were noted upon RA treatment. Hemolysis was augmented by blocking KCl efflux and was blunted by ATP, SB203580, staurosporin, D4476, isosmotic urea, and PEG 8000. CONCLUSIONS: RA stimulates Ca2+-dependent and sucrose-sensitive hemolysis and eryptosis characterized by PS exposure, Ca2+ accumulation, loss of ionic regulation, and cell shrinkage. These toxic effects were mediated through energy deprivation, p38 MAPK, protein kinase C, and casein kinase 1α.",

The aim of this study is to investigate the effects and potential mechanisms of RA on chronic CORT injection induced depression-like behavior in mice. Male C57BL/6 J mice were intraperitoneally injected with CORT (10 mg/kg) and were orally given RA daily (10 or 20 mg/kg) for 21 consecutive days. In vitro, the HT22 cells were exposed to CORT (200 μM) with RA (12.5, 25 or 50 μM) and LY294002 (a PI3K inhibitor) or ANA-12 (a TrkB inhibitor) treatment. The depression-like behavior and various neurobiological changes in the mice and cell injury and levels of target proteins in vitro were subsequently assessed. Here, RA treatment decreased the expression of p-GR/GR, HSP90, FKBP51, SGK-1 in mice hippocampi. Besides, RA increased the average optical density of Nissl bodies and number of dendritic spines in CA3 region, and enhanced Brdu and DCX expression and synaptic transduction in DG region, as well as up-regulated both the BDNF/TrkB/CREB and PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling. Moreover, RA reduced structural damage and apoptosis in HT22 cells, increased the differentiation and maturation of them. More importantly, LY294002, but not ANA-12, reversed the effect of RA on GR nuclear translocation. Taken together, RA exerted antidepressant activities by modulating the hippocampal glucocorticoid signaling and hippocampal neurogenesis, which related to the BDNF/TrkB/PI3K signaling axis regulating GR nuclear translocation, provide evidence for the application of RA as a candidate for depression.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Rosmarinic acid (RA) is an active polyphenol that is widely found in various edible herbs. This study explored the potential anti-allergic activities and the underlying mechanisms of RA in ovalbumin (OVA)-induced intestinal allergic mice. RESULTS: Forty female BALB/c mice were randomly divided into five groups: control group, model group (OVA sensitized/challenged), RA-Low group (OVA sensitized/challenged, 30 mg kg-1 RA intervention), RA-Middle group (OVA sensitized/challenged, 90 mg kg-1 RA intervention) and RA-High group (OVA sensitized/challenged, 270 mg kg-1 RA intervention). RA effectively attenuated allergic reactions, including alleviating allergic symptoms and regulating the hypothermia of mice in the model group. Moreover, the anaphylactic mediator (OVA-specific IgE, histamine and mMCP-1) levels of OVA allergic mice were markedly decreased after RA intervention. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis showed that RA significantly inhibited Th2 cytokine expression, while Th1 and Treg cytokines were markedly increased. 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis indicated that RA effectively regulated the richness and diversity of the intestinal microbiota in OVA allergic mice. At the phylum level, the relative abundance of Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes and the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio were altered by RA intervention. At the genus level, RA was found to regulate the disturbances in the relative abundance of Muribaculaceae, Lactobacillus and Prevotella. CONCLUSION: RA exhibited potential anti-allergic activity in OVA allergic mice by regulating hypersensitive immune responses and the intestinal microbiota structure. These results provide important evidence that RA can be developed into a novel functional food-derived ingredient against food allergy. © 2023 Society of Chemical Industry.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Phenolic modulators have attracted attention for their potential in shaping functional traits in plants. This work investigated the impact of naringenin (Nar) and rosmarinic acid (RA) on the functional properties of Lepidium sativum leaves and roots. RESULTS: Untargeted metabolomics identified a diverse phenolic profile, including flavonoids, phenolic acids, low molecular weight phenolics, lignans, and stilbenes. Cluster, analysis of variance multiblock orthogonal partial least squares (AMOPLS), and orthogonal projection to latent structures discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) multivariate analyses confirmed tissue-specific modulation of bioactive compounds. The tissue was the hierarchically most influential factor, explaining 27% of observed variability, while the treatment and their interaction were statistically insignificant. Thereafter, various in vitro assays were employed to assess antioxidant capacity, including 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), 2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline)-6-sulfonic acid (ABTS) radical scavenging activity, cupric ion reducing antioxidant capacity (CUPRAC), and ferric ion reducing antioxidant power (FRAP), metal chelating ability, and phosphomolybdenum (PMD) assays. Extracts were also tested for inhibitory effects on cholinesterase, amylase, glucosidase, and tyrosinase enzymes. RA application positively impacted antioxidant and enzyme inhibitory activities, holding valuable implications in shaping the health-promoting properties of L. sativum. CONCLUSION: The untargeted metabolomics analysis showed a significant tissue-dependent modulation of bioactive compounds, determining no synergistic effect between applying phenolic compounds in combination. Specifically, the sole application of RA increased anthocyanins and hydroxyphenyl propanoic acid content on leaves, which was strictly related to enhancing the biological activities. © 2023 The Authors.

Proper healing of the damaged nasal mucosa is important for health. OBJECTIVE: There is no study in the literature investigating the effects of rosmarinic acid on mucosal healing. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of rosmarinic acid on nasal mucosal healing. METHODS: 21 male, adult Spraque Dawley albino rats were divided into three groups as the control group, the local treatment group in which rosmarinic acid was applied locally to the nasal mucosa, and the systemic treatment group in which rosmarinic acid was injected intraperitoneally. The wound area was obtained by creating a trauma area by inserting a 10 mm interdental brush through the right nasal nostril into the right nasal cavities of all animals. For the following 15 days, the treatment agent was applied as indicated once a day and on the 15th day the animals were decapitated and tissue samples taken from the nasal mucosa were prepared for histopathological examination. The preparations were examined in terms of cellular hyperplasia, goblet cell hypertrophy and degeneration, leukocyte infiltration, cilia loss and degeneration, edema and vascular dilatation, and they have been classified into four categories as mild (+), moderate (++), severe (+++) and very severe (++++). RESULTS: There was a significant difference between the groups in terms of all parameters evaluated, and there is a decrease in the intensity of the parameters with transition from the control group to the local group and from there to the systemic group. CONCLUSION: Systemic rosmarinic acid administration showed an enhancing effect on the healing of experimentally induced nasal mucosal injury due to its possible anti-inflammatory effect.",

We demonstrated the synergistic protective activity of the MD-RA combination in Hs68 cells against ultraviolet B (UVB)-induced photoaging. The cell viabilities of MD, RA, and MD-RA combinations at various ratios (9:1, 8:2, 7:3, 6:4, 5:5, 4:6, 3:7, 2:8, and 1:9, v/v) were measured to compare their protective effects against UVB radiation. The synergistic interaction between MD and RA was confirmed using a combination index. The strongest effect of the MD-RA combination was observed at a ratio of 3:7. The combination of MD-RA 3:7 exerted a synergistic effect against UVB-induced changes in cell viability, as well as superoxide dismutase activity, reactive oxygen species, glutathione, catalase activity, and malondialdehyde levels. Moreover, the inhibitory effect of the MD-RA combination (3:7) on matrix metalloproteinases and total collagen production was higher than that of MD or RA alone. These results demonstrated that the MD-RA combination (3:7) generated a strong synergistic effect against UVB-induced photoaging in Hs68 cells. Overall, our results provide scientific evidence to support the development of a new combination therapy for skin protection against UVB-induced photoaging through the synergistic interaction between MD and RA. These natural compounds are promising options for antiaging and skin protection in the cosmetic and pharmaceutical industries.",

During storage, CH, CHT, and CHTRA treatments showed lower aerobic mesophilic and psychrotrophic bacteria counts than the control. However, the differences between coating treatments were not significant. The highest mean pH value was determined in the control group. As the storage time increased, the thiobarbituric acid reactive substances value increased. At the end of the storage period, no significant differences were observed between the treatments, including in the control group. The total volatile basic nitrogen (TVB-N) level in the control group was above 25 mg/100 g on day 15 of storage. However, the TVB-N level in the treatment groups was below 20 mg/100 g on day 18. It was also determined that coating application×storage period interaction had a significant effect on all color parameters (p<0.01). At the end of storage, the highest CIE L* was observed in CHTRA treatment. However, the value of this treatment did not differ from that of the CH treatment."

However, the effects of RosA on influenza A virus-mediated acute lung injury remain unknown. In this study, we aimed to explore whether RosA could protect against H1N1 virus-mediated lung injury and elucidate the underlying mechanisms. METHODS: Mice were intragastrically administered with RosA for 2 days before intranasal inoculation of the H1N1 virus (5LD50) for the establishment of an acute lung injury model. At day 7 post-infection (p.i.), gross anatomic lung pathology, lung histopathologic, and lung index (lung weight/body weight) were examined. Luminex assay, multiple immunofluorescence and flow cytometry were performed to detect the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and apoptosis, respectively. Western blotting and plasmid transfection with hematopoietic-type PGD2 synthase (h-PGDS) overexpression were conducted to elucidate the mechanisms. RESULTS: RosA effectively attenuated H1N1 virus-triggered deterioration of gross anatomical morphology, worsened lung histopathology, and elevated lung index. Excessive pro-inflammatory reactions, aberrant alveolar epithelial cell apoptosis, and cytotoxic CD8+ T lung recruitment in the lung tissues induced by H1N1 virus infection were observed to be reduced by RosA treatment. In vitro experiments demonstrated that RosA treatment dose-dependently suppressed the increased levels of pro-inflammatory mediators and apoptosis through inhibition of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) and P38 MAPK signaling pathways in H1N1 virus-infected A549 cells, which was accompanied by promoting activation of the h-PGDS-PGD2-HO-1 signal axis. Furthermore, we strikingly found that h-PGDS inhibition significantly abrogated the inhibitory effects of RosA on H1N1 virus-mediated activation of NF-κB and P38 MAPK signaling pathways, resulting in diminishing the suppressive effects on the increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines as well as apoptosis. Finally, suppressing h-PGDS prominently abolished the protective effects of RosA on H1N1 virus-mediated severe pneumonia and lung injury. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, our study demonstrates that RosA is a promising compound to alleviate H1N1 virus-induced severe lung injury through prompting the h-PGDS-PGD2-HO-1 signal axis."

      "abstract": "Medulloblastoma (MB) is a heterogeneous group of malignant pediatric brain tumors, divided into molecular groups with distinct biological features and prognoses. Currently available therapy often results in poor long-term quality of life for patients, which will be afflicted by neurological, neuropsychiatric, and emotional sequelae. Identifying novel therapeutic agents capable of targeting the tumors without jeopardizing patients' quality of life is imperative. Rosmarinic acid (RA) is a plant-derived compound whose action against a series of diseases including cancer has been investigated, with no side effects reported so far. Previous studies have not examined whether RA has effects in MB. Here, we show RA is cytotoxic against human Daoy (IC50 = 168 μM) and D283 (IC50 = 334 μM) MB cells. Exposure to RA for 48 h reduced histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) expression while increasing H3K9 hyperacetylation, reduced epidermal growth factor (EGFR) expression, and inhibited EGFR downstream targets extracellular-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2 and AKT in Daoy cells. These modifications were accompanied by increased expression of CDKN1A/p21, reduced expression of SOX2, and a decrease in proliferative rate. Treatment with RA also reduced cancer stem cell markers expression and neurosphere size. Taken together, our findings indicate that RA can reduce cell proliferation and stemness and induce cell cycle arrest in MB cells. Mechanisms mediating these effects may include targeting HDAC1, EGFR, and ERK signaling, and promoting p21 expression, possibly through an increase in H3K9ac and AKT deactivation.

      "abstract": "The infiltration of inflammatory cells, especially macrophages, integrated with the production of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (RONS) and the release of inflammatory cytokines play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Synergistic combination of RONS scavenging and macrophage repolarization from pro-inflammatory M1 phenotype towards anti-inflammatory M2 phenotype, provides a promising strategy for efficient RA treatment. Herein, this study reported a unique self-assembly strategy to construct distinct rosmarinic acid nanoparticles (RNPs) for efficient RA treatment using the naturally occurring polyphenol-based compound, rosmarinic acid (RosA). The designed RNPs exhibited favorable capability in scavenging RONS and pro-inflammatory cytokines produced by macrophages. Attributing to the widened vascular endothelial-cell gap at inflammation sites, RNPs could target and accumulate at the inflammatory joints of collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) rats for guaranteeing therapeutic effect. In vivo investigation demonstrated that RNPs alleviated the symptoms of RA, including joint swelling, synovial hyperplasia, cartilage degradation, and bone erosion in CIA rats. Additionally, the designed RNPs promoted macrophage polarization from M1 phenotype towards M2 phenotype, resulting in the suppressed progression of RA. Therefore, this research represents the representative paradigm for RA therapy using antioxidative nanomedicine deriving from the natural polyphenol-based compound."

Injectable hydrogels have attracted extensive attention in the treatment of MI. By promoting the coupling of mechanical and electrical signals between cardiomyocytes, combined with synergistic therapeutic strategies targeting the pathological processes of inflammation, proliferation, and fibrotic remodeling after MI, it is expected to improve the therapeutic effect. In this study, a pH/ROS dual-responsive injectable hydrogel was developed by modifying xanthan gum and gelatin with reversible imine bond and boronic ester bond double crosslinking. By encapsulating polydopamine-rosmarinic acid nanoparticles to achieve on-demand drug release in response to the microenvironment of MI, thereby exerting anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic, and anti-fibrosis effects. By adding conductive composites to improve the conductivity and mechanical strength of the hydrogel, restore electrical signal transmission in the infarct area, promote synchronous contraction of cardiomyocytes, avoid induced arrhythmias, and induce angiogenesis. Furthermore, the multifunctional hydrogel promoted the expression of cardiac-specific markers to restore cardiac function after MI. The in vivo and in vitro results demonstrate the effectiveness of this synergistic comprehensive treatment strategy in MI treatment, showing great application potential to promote the repair of infarcted hearts."

Rosmarinic acid (RA) is a polyphenol holding anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and neuroprotective properties. The aim of this study was to characterise the efficacy of an oral administration of RA in promoting healthspan in a mouse model of physiological aging. Aged C57Bl/6 male and female (24-month-old) mice were either administered with RA (500 mg/Kg) or a vehicle in drinking bottles for 52 days while 3-month-old mice receiving the same treatment were used as controls. All subjects were assessed for cognitive abilities in the Morris water maze (MWM) and for emotionality in the elevated-plus maze test (EPM). Brain-derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) protein levels were evaluated in the hippocampus. Since the interaction between metabolic signals and cerebral functions plays a pivotal role in the etiopathogenesis of cognitive decline, the glycaemic and lipid profiles of the mice were also assessed. RA enhanced learning and memory in 24-month-old mice, an effect that was associated to improved glucose homeostasis. By contrast, the lipid profile was disrupted in young adults. This effect was associated with worse glycaemic control in males and with reduced BDNF levels in females, suggesting powerful sex-dependent effects and raising a note of caution for RA administration in young healthy adult subjects.",

      "abstract": "Oxidative stress induces the adaptive response and alteration of energy metabolism across human cell types. Dermal fibroblasts shift their energy system to overload anaerobic glycolysis when exposed to sub-lethal hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). However, oxidative stress levels in the cells can be depleted by antioxidants, and such cellular changes can therefore be modulated. The present study aimed to investigate the modulatory effect of rosmarinic acid (a polyphenol antioxidant) against H2O2-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the glycolytic adaptive response in fibroblasts. The results showed that H2O2 caused a significant ROS increase in the cells, and pre-treatment with rosmarinic acid (5-50 µM) decreased ROS significantly in the presence of glutathione. Rosmarinic acid modulated the adaptive response in H2O2-treated cells by decreasing glucose consumption and lactate production. The rosmarinic acid also recovered intracellular ATP and decreased NADPH production via the pentose phosphate pathway. Several glycolytic enzymes, including hexokinase-2 (HK-2), phosphofructokinase-2 (PFK-2), and lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA), were downregulated in cells treated with rosmarinic acid. Furthermore, the key antioxidant enzymes: glutathione-disulfide reductase (GSR), glutathione peroxidase-1 (GPx-1), and peroxiredoxin-1 (Prx-1) and redox protein thioredoxin-1 (Trx-1) were upregulated in treated cells compared to control cells. To sum up, the rosmarinic acid could be used as an antioxidant against H2O2-induced adaptive responses in fibroblasts by modulating glucose metabolism, glycolytic genes, and GSH production. The present work indicates that rosmarinic acid holds promise in cell-based research applications for combating ROS and enhancing dermal fibroblast health.",

Rosmarinic acid (RA) can have potent anti-inflammatory effects in the drug-loading system. The purpose of this was to evaluate the anti-inflammatory effects of RA loaded to exosomes (RLE) on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced endometritis in mice. RA was loaded into serum-derived exosome, using sonication methods. Animals in the treatment groups were subjected to uterine horn injection of RA, exosome, RA combination with exosome (R+E), and RA loaded to exosome (RLE) in uterine horn by two dosages in each group (5 and 10 mg/kg of RA or exosome), 24 h after inducing endometritis. Histopathological analysis, MPO production, immunohistochemistry, and qPCR were used to determine whether the treatment groups were adequate in controlling inflammation. The results showed that treatment groups, and mainly RLE10 and R10 +E10 groups, could modulate pathological changes, inhibit myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity, and significantly reduce the gene and protein expression of TLR4, NLRP3, inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β, IL-18, and TNF-α, and lastly, GSDM-D as a pyroptosis factor. In conclusion, RA loaded and combination with exosomes at a dosage of 10 mg/kg (RLE10 and R10 +E10) improved endometritis in mice through a suppressing TLR4-NLRP3 signaling pathway.",

However, inappropriate response to self-nucleic acids leads to sustained type I interferon (IFN) production, which is implicated in the development of several autoimmune diseases, such as Aicardi-Goutières syndrome (AGS). Therefore, effective confinement of intracellular nucleic acid-induced IFN expression is a potential strategy for the treatment of such autoimmune diseases. In this study, we found that rosmarinic acid (RA), a natural compound isolated from rosemary, inhibits intracellular nucleic acid-stimulated IFN expression. Mechanistic investigation revealed that RA binds to both G3BP1 and cGAS, and impairs cGAS activation through disrupting the binding of DNA with cGAS. More importantly, we showed that RA could effectively attenuate the expression of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) in the well-established cell models for AGS. Thus, our study provides a promising compound for the treatment of autoimmune responses induced by aberrant nucleic acid-sensing.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Dermatophyte caused by Trichophyton mentagrophytes is a global disease with a growing prevalence that is difficult to cure. Perilla frutescens (L.) Britt. is an edible and medicinal plant. Ancient books of Traditional Chinese Medicine and modern pharmacological studies have shown that it has potential anti-fungi activity. This is the first study to explore the inhibitory effects of compounds from P. frutescens on Trichophyton mentagrophytes and its mechanism of action coupled with the antifungal activity in vitro from network pharmacology, transcriptomics and proteomics. METHODS: Five most potential inhibitory compounds against fungi in P. frutescens was screened with network pharmacology. The antifungal activity of the candidates was detected by a broth microdilution method. Through in vitro antifungal assays screening the compound with efficacy, transcriptomics and proteomics were performed to investigate the pharmacological mechanisms of the effective compound against Trichophyton mentagrophytes. Furthermore, the real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was applied to verify the expression of genes. RESULTS: The top five potential antifungal compounds in P. frutescens screened by network pharmacology are: progesterone, luteolin, apigenin, ursolic acid and rosmarinic acid. In vitro antifungal assays showed that rosmarinic acid had a favorable inhibitory effect on fungi. The transcriptomic findings exhibited that the differentially expressed genes of fungus after rosmarinic acid intervention were mainly enriched in the carbon metabolism pathway, while the proteomic findings suggested that rosmarinic acid could inhibit the average growth of Trichophyton mentagrophytes by interfering with the expression of enolase in the glycolysis pathway. Comparison of real-time PCR and transcriptomics results showed that the trends of gene expression in glycolytic, carbon metabolism and glutathione metabolic pathways were identical. The binding modes and interactions between rosmarinic acid and enolase were preliminary explored by molecular docking analysis. CONCLUSION: The key findings of the present study manifested that rosmarinic acid, a medicinal compound extracted from P. frutescens, had pharmacological activity in inhibiting the growth of Trichophyton mentagrophytes by affecting its enolase expression to reduce metabolism. Rosmarinic acid is expected to be an efficacious product for prevention and treatment of dermatophytes."

Lipid mediators (LMs) are a kind of inflammatory signaling molecules which are believed to be involved in the development of asthma. Hyssopus cuspidatus Boriss. is a traditional Uyghur medicine, which is widely used in the treatment of asthma and other respiratory diseases. Extraction of Hyssopus cuspidatus Boriss. was reported to neutralize asthma symptoms. The purpose of the study was to investigate both the anti-inflammatory and immunoregulation properties of the Hyssopus cuspidatus Boriss. extract (SXCF) and its main active constituent, rosmarinic acid (RosA), in vivo. The effect of RosA, a major constituent of SXCF, was evaluated on an asthmatic model, with both anti-inflammatory and immunoregulation properties. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Anti-inflammatory effect of SXCF and RosA was assessed using OVA-induced asthma model mice by UPLC-MS/MS method. RESULTS: Overall, RosA played a critical role in anti-asthma treatment. In total, 90% of LMs species that were significantly regulated by SXCF were covered. On the most important LMs associated with asthma, RosA equivalent induced similar effects as SXCF did. It is believed that some constituents in SXCF could neutralize RosA excessive impacts on LMs.",

Microgreens of P. frutescens were grown under light and dark conditions and harvested after 10, 15, 20, and 25 days of each treatment. Although dry weight values of microgreens gradually increased from 10 to 25 days of both treatments, the microgreens grown under light treatment possessed slightly higher levels of dry weight than those grown in the dark. Rosmarinic acid and total phenolic content (TPC) were also analyzed using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and Folin-Ciocalteu assay. The accumulation patterns of rosmarinic acid and TPC gradually increased and decreased, respectively, in P. frutescens microgreens grown in continuous darkness. The highest accumulation was observed in microgreens grown for 20 days. However, rosmarinic acid and TPC values were not significantly different in microgreens grown under light conditions. According to the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical inhibition assay, the extracts of P. frutescens microgreens were confirmed to be strong antioxidants, and their ability to scavenge DPPH radicals was positively correlated with the total phenolic content in the microgreens after 10, 15, 20, and 25 days of both treatments. Considering the relatively higher values of dry weight, rosmarinic acid, TPC, and DPPH assay, P. frutescens microgreens after 20 days of darkness and 20 days of light treatment, respectively, were selected for screening antibacterial activity using nine pathogens. Both microgreen extracts showed strong antibacterial activity against pathogens. In particular, the extracts of microgreens grown for 20 days under light treatment showed higher antimicrobial effects. Therefore, the light treatments for 20 days, as well as the darkness treatment for 20 days, were the best conditions for P. frutescens microgreen production because of their high levels of dry weight, phenolics, and biological activities."

These plants have therapeutic benefits due to their high rosmarinic acid (RA) content. However, the molecular mechanisms behind RA generation in two species of Salvia plants are still poorly understood. As a first report, the objectives of the present research were to determine the effects of methyl jasmonate (MeJA) on the rosmarinic acid (RA), total flavonoid and phenolic contents (TFC and TPC), and changes in the expression of key genes involved in their biosynthesis (phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL), 4-coumarate-CoA ligase (4CL), and rosmarinic acid synthase (RAS)). The results of High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis indicated that MeJA significantly increased RA content in S. yungii and S. abrotanoides species (to 82 and 67 mg/g DW, respectively) by 1.66- and 1.54-fold compared with untreated plants. After 24 h, leaves of Salvia yangii and Salvia abrotanoides species treated with 150 M MeJA had the greatest TPC and TFC (80 and 42 mg TAE/g DW, and 28.11 and 15.14 mg QUE/g DW, respectively), which was in line with the patterns of gene expression investigated. Our findings showed that MeJA dosages considerably enhanced the RA, TPC, and TFC contents in both species compared with the control treatment. Since increased numbers of transcripts for PAL, 4CL, and RAS were also detected, the effects of MeJA are probably caused by the activation of genes involved in the phenylpropanoid pathway.",

      "abstract": "Rosmarinic acid (RA) is a natural polyphenolic compound with several pharmacological activities, including immunomodulation and anti-tumor effect. Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase-1 (IDO1), the rate-limiting enzyme that metabolizes tryptophan into kynurenine, is an important negative immune regulator. This study aimed to explore the effect of combined action of IDO1 gene silencing and RA on tumor immune microenvironment. H22 tumor-bearing mice were treated with combination therapy with RA and IDO1-shRNA. The percentages and apoptosis of T-cells and subsets of splenic regulatory T-cells (Tregs) were detected by flow cytometry. Levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α), Interferon-γ (IFN-γ), interleukin-2 (IL-2) and interleukin-10 (IL-10) were measured by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Treatment with RA + IDO1-shRNA significantly increased the percentage of CD4+ T cells, ratio of CD4+/CD8+ and the levels of IFN-γ and IL-2, while decreased CD8+ apoptosis, the proportion of splenic Tregs and the levels of TNF-α and IL-10. The present study demonstrated that combination therapy with RA and IDO1-shRNA had anti-tumor effects on HCC. The mechanism might be related to regulating immune response and immunocytokines, as well as alleviating immunosuppression induced by Tregs in the tumor immune microenvironment.",

Rosmarinic acid (RA) is among the first secondary metabolites discovered and it is a bioactive compound identified in plants such as Boraginaceae and Nepetoideae subfamilies of the Lamiaceae family, including Thymus masticmasti chinaythia koreana, Ocimum sanctum, and Hyptis pectinate. This updated review is to highlight the chemopreventive and chemotherapeutic effects of RA and its derivatives, thus providing valuable clues for the potential development of some complementary drugs in the treatment of cancers. Relevant information about RA's chemopreventive and chemotherapeutic effects and its derivatives were collected from electronic scientific databases, such as PubMed/Medline, Scopus, TRIP database, Web of Science, and Science Direct. The results of the studies showed numerous significant biological effects such as antiviral, antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, anti-tumour, antioxidant and antiangiogenic effects. Most of the studies on the anticancer potential with the corresponding mechanisms are still in the experimental preclinical stage and are missing evidence from clinical trials to support the research. To open new anticancer therapeutic perspectives of RA and its derivatives, future clinical studies must elucidate the molecular mechanisms and targets of action in more detail, the human toxic potential and adverse effects.",

      "abstract": "Obesity and elevated blood free fatty acid (FFA) levels lead to impaired insulin action causing insulin resistance in skeletal muscle, and contributing to the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Mechanistically, insulin resistance is associated with increased serine phosphorylation of the insulin receptor substrate (IRS) mediated by serine/threonine kinases including mTOR and p70S6K. Evidence demonstrated that activation of the energy sensor AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) may be an attractive target to counteract insulin resistance. We reported previously that rosemary extract (RE) and the RE polyphenol carnosic acid (CA) activated AMPK and counteracted the FFA-induced insulin resistance in muscle cells. The effect of rosmarinic acid (RA), another polyphenolic constituent of RE, on FFA-induced muscle insulin resistance has never been examined and is the focus of the current study. Muscle cell (L6) exposure to FFA palmitate resulted in increased serine phosphorylation of IRS-1 and reduced insulin-mediated (i) Akt activation, (ii) GLUT4 glucose transporter translocation, and (iii) glucose uptake. Notably, RA treatment abolished these effects, and restored the insulin-stimulated glucose uptake. Palmitate treatment increased the phosphorylation/activation of mTOR and p70S6K, kinases known to be involved in insulin resistance and RA significantly reduced these effects. RA increased the phosphorylation of AMPK, even in the presence of palmitate. Our data indicate that RA has the potential to counteract the palmitate-induced insulin resistance in muscle cells, and further studies are required to explore its antidiabetic properties.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Allergic contact dermatitis (ACD) is one of the most common dermatoses, which has high disease burden and quality of life impairment. Anti-histamine is not effective in a part of the ACD patients. Thus, the discovery of novel antipruritic therapy is of highly demand. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we investigated the anti-pruritic effects of rosmarinic acid (RA) and explored the underlying mechanism. METHOD: SPF Balb/c mice were randomly divided into control group, ACD model group, RA group (1.0 mg/kg) and loratadine (LORA) group (1.5 mg/kg). Back epidermal thickness was recorded. H&E staining was used for pathological observation. Mast cell degranulation was assessed by toluidine blue staining. ELISA assay was employed to detect cytokines levels. Cortistatin-14 (CST-14) and Mas-related G protein-coupled receptor X2 (MRGPRX2) expression was detetcted by RT-PCR and western blot. Molecular docking assay was used to predict the affinity of RA and MRGPRX2. Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) assay was used to verify structure affinity of RA and MRGPRX2. RESULTS: RA treatment significantly decreased epidermal keratinization and inflammatory cell infiltration in ACD mouse model. Administration of RA significantly reduced secretion of histamine, IL-13, and mRNA expression of CST-14. Furthermore, RA treatment increased mRNA expression of MRGPRX2. In addition, Molecular docking results predict that RA has a good affinity with MRGPRX2. RA displayed a structure affinity (KD = 8.89 × 10-4) with MRGPRX2 by SPR. RA inhibited CST-14 and Compound 48/80 (C48/80)-induced mast cell activation via MRGPRX2-PLCγ1-PKC-NF-κB signaling pathway. CONCLUSION: RA exhibits anti-pruritic and anti-inflammatory effects in ACD mice by inhibiting MRGPRX2-PLCγ1-PKC-NF-κB signaling pathway. RA might emerge as a potential drug for the treatment of pruritus and skin inflammation in the setting of ACD.",

      "abstract": "Maintaining a steady state of mucus barrier is an important potential target for polyphenol to exert its anticolitis activity. This study elucidates the pivotal role of polyphenol rosmaric acid (RA) in regulating the mucus barrier function and alleviating inflammation by identifying its gut microbiota-derived metabolites and evaluating its inhibitory effect on inflammasomes in colitis mice. Results demonstrated that RA treatment promoted the proliferation of goblet cells and restored the level of mucus secretion, especially Muc2. RA reshaped the microbiota of colitis mice, particularly the boost of core probiotics, such as p. Bacteroidaceae, f. Muribaculaceae, g. Muribaculaceae, g. Alistipes, and g. Clostridia_UCG-014. Nontargeted metabonomics and targeted metabonomics confirmed a significant increase in the bile acids and their metabolites (7-sulfocholic acid, stercobilin, chenodeoxycholic acid 3-sulfate, chenodeoxycholic acid sulfate, and ursodeoxycholic acid 3-sulfate), indole metabolites ((R)-2,3-dihydro-3,5-dihydroxy-2-oxo-3-indoleacetic acid, frovatriptan, 3-formyl-6-hydroxyindole, and brassicanal A), and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) (acetic acid, butyric acid, isobutyric acid, isovaleric acid, and valeric acid) that contributed to the strengthened mucus barrier function. In addition, being absorbed mainly in the lower digestive tract, RA inhibited the overexpression of inflammasomes (especially NLRP6) that occurred in colitis mice to promote the mucus secretion of goblet cells. These data confirmed that RA, as a promising candidate to enhance gut health, restored colonic mucus secretion in colitis mice by mediating the production of gut microbiota-derived metabolites and the overexpression of inflammasomes. The presented study provides scientific evidence explaining the apparent paradox of low bioavailability and high bioactivity in polyphenols.",

      "abstract": "Cutaneous melanoma is the most aggressive type of skin cancer; it is difficult to treat, and has been highlighted in recent years due to increasing numbers of cases worldwide. The use of antitumoral therapeutics for this neoplasm has been associated with severe side effects, low quality of life, and resistance. We aimed in this study to explore the effect of the phenolic compound rosmarinic acid (RA) on human metastatic melanoma cells. SK-MEL-28 melanoma cells were treated for 24 h with different concentrations of RA. In parallel, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) also were treated with RA under the same experimental conditions to verify the cytotoxic effect on non-tumoral cells. Then, we assessed cell viability and migration, levels of intracellular and extracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), as well as nitric oxide (NOx), non-protein thiols (NPSH), and total thiol (PSH). Gene expression of the caspase 8, caspase 3 and NLRP3 inflammasome was evaluated by RT-qPCR. The enzymatic activity of the caspase 3 protein was assessed by a sensitive fluorescent assay. Fluorescence microscopy was employed to corroborate the effects of RA on melanoma cell viability, mitochondria transmembrane potential and apoptotic bodies formation. We found that RA potently reduces melanoma cell viability and migration after 24 h of treatment. On the other hand, it has no cytotoxic effect on non-tumoral cells. The fluorescence micrographics indicated that RA reduces transmembrane potential of mitochondria and induces apoptotic bodies formation. Moreover, RA significantly decreases intracellular and extracellular ROS levels, and increases the antioxidant defenders NPSH and PSH. A remarkable feature found in our study was that RA strongly upregulates the gene expression of the caspase 8 and caspase 3, and downregulates NLRP3 inflammasome expression. Similar to gene expression, RA greatly increases the enzymatic activity of caspase 3 protein. Taken together, we have shown for the first time that RA reduces cell viability and migration of human metastatic melanoma cells, in addition to modulates apoptosis-related gene expression. We suggest that RA may have the potential to be used in a therapeutic perspective, particularly for CM cell treatment.",

      "abstract": "Epilepsy is characterized by a predisposition to generate recurrent and spontaneous seizures; it affects millions of people worldwide. Status epilepticus (SE) is a severe type of seizure. In this context, screening potential treatments is very important. In the present study, we evaluated the beneficial effects of rosmarinic acid (RA) in pilocarpine-induced in vitro and in vivo models of epileptiform activity. Using an in vitro model in combined entorhinal cortex-hippocampal from Wistar rats we evaluated the effects of RA (10 µg/mL) on the lactate release and a glucose fluorescent analogue, 2-(N-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl)amino)-2-deoxyglucose (2-NDBG), after incubation in high potassium aCSF supplemented or not with pilocarpine. In the in vivo model, SE was induced in male C57BL/6 mice by pilocarpine. At 1, 24, and 48 h after the end of SE mice were treated with RA (30 mg/kg/v.o.). We evaluated the neuromotor impairment by neuroscore tests and protein carbonyl levels in the cerebral cortex. In both in vitro models, RA was able to decrease the stimulated lactate release, while no effect on 2-NBDG uptake was found. RA has beneficial effects in models of epileptiform activity in vivo and in vitro. We found that RA treatment attenuated SE-induced neuromotor impairment at the 48 h timepoint. Moreover, post-SE treatment with RA decreased levels of protein carbonyls in the cerebral cortex of mice when compared to their vehicle-treated counterparts. Importantly, RA was effective in a model of SE which is relevant for the human condition. The present data add to the literature on the biological effects of RA, which could be a good candidate for add-on therapy in epilepsy."

      "abstract": "Chronic exposure to Ultraviolet B radiation (UV-B) evokes a myriad of toxic signalling events in the irradiated skin. One of such response is ER stress, which is known to exacerbate photodamage responses. Also, recent literature has highlighted the adverse impact of environmental toxicants on mitochondrial dynamics and mitophagy. Impaired mitochondrial dynamics escalates oxidative damage and causes apoptosis. There have been evidences that support crosstalk between ER stress and mitochondrial dysfunction. However, mechanistic clarification is still needed to verify the interactions between UPR responses and mitochondrial dynamics impairment in UV-B-induced photodamage models. Lastly, plant-based natural agents have garnered attention as therapeutic agents against skin photodamage. Thus, gaining mechanistic insights of plant-based natural agents is required for their application and feasibility in clinical settings. With this aim in view, this study was performed in primary human dermal fibroblasts (HDFs) and Balb/C mice. Different parameters regarding mitochondrial dynamics, ER stress, intracellular damage and histological damage were analyzed using western blot, rt-PCR and microscopy. We demonstrated that UV-B exposure leads to induction of UPR responses, upregulation of Drp-1 and inhibition of mitophagy. Further, 4-PBA treatment leads to reversal of these noxious stimuli in irradiated HDF cells, thereby, indicating an upstream role of UPR induction in mitophagy inhibition. Also, we explored the therapeutic effect of Rosmarinic acid (RA) against ER stress and impaired mitophagy in photodamage models. RA prevents intracellular damage via alleviation of ER stress and mitophagic responses in HDFs and irradiated Balb/C mice skin. The current study summarizes the mechanistic insights into UVB-mediated intracellular damage and role of natural plant-based agent (RA) in ameliorating these toxic responses.",

However, there are no reports on the effects of SPR and its bioactive components on muscle atrophy. Herein, we investigated the anti-atrophic effect of SPR and rosmarinic acid (RosA), a major compound of SPR, on dexamethasone (DEX)-induced skeletal muscle atrophy in C2C12 myotubes. Myotubes were treated with 10 μM DEX in the presence or absence of SPR or RosA at different concentrations for 24 h and subjected to immunocytochemistry, western blot, and measurements of ROS and ATP levels. SPR and RosA increased viability and inhibited protein degradation in DEX-treated C2C12 myotubes. In addition, RosA promoted the Akt/p70S6K/mTOR pathway and reduced ROS production, and apoptosis. Furthermore, the treatment of RosA significantly recovered SOD activity, autophagy activity, mitochondrial contents, and APT levels in DEX-treated myotubes. These findings suggest that SPR and RosA may provide protective effects against DEX-induced muscle atrophy and have promising potential as a nutraceutical remedy for the treatment of muscle weakness and atrophy.",

      "abstract": "A primary concern about photodynamic therapy (PDT) is its inability to regulate the generation levels of reactive oxidative species (ROS) based on the complex microenvironment, resulting in the impairment toward normal tissues and immunosuppression. Besides, tumor metastasis also compromises PDT's efficacy and drives mortality. However, it is very challenging to achieve such two goals within one nanosystem. Here, the nanoassembly (CPR) with self-regulated photodynamic and antimetastasis properties comprises three parts: chlorin e6-conjugated β-cyclodextrin (CD-Ce6) acts as the main PDT agent and ferrocene (Fc)-terminated phenylboronic acid-containing conjugates entering into the cavity of CD-Ce6, as well as rosmarinic acid (RA)-boronic acid crosslinked shell. Compared with non-crosslinked counterpart, CPR displays better stability and enhanced tumor accumulation. Under laser irradiation, CPR generates plenty of ROS to damage tumor cells and induce immunogenic cell death. Mildly acidic TME partly cleaves the crosslinkers to dissociate antioxidant RAs from micelles, which together with Fc in CPR scavenge PDT-induced ROS in the TME. By contrast, under acidic lysosomal conditions, Fc catalyzes abundant H2 O2 in tumor cells to produce highly cytotoxic •OH, while RA continuously reduces ferroptosis-generated Fc+ into Fc, both to augment the PDT efficacy in tumor cells. CPR also remarkably hinders the epithelial-mesenchymal transition to prevent the lung metastasis.",

      "abstract": "Hypertrophy of adipose tissues and dysbiosis are hallmarks of obesity. Although drugs are applied for obesity treatment, side effects limit their use. The anti-obesity capacity of rosmarinic acid (RA) has been documented. Trichodesma khasianum Clarke is an edible RA-rich plant grown in Taiwan. Our previous study found that an 80 % ethanol extract of T. khasianum Clarke leaves (80EETC) ameliorates gastric mucosal damage through its anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and microbiota modulation abilities. However, the anti-obesity effect of 80EETC remains unclear. Therefore, the objective of this study was to explore the protective effects of low-dose 80EETC (125 mg/kg b.w., 80EETCL) or high-dose 80EETC (250 mg/kg b.w., 80EETCH) on obesity development through gut microbiota modulation in high-fat diet (HFD)-induced C57BL/6 mice. The results showed a high RA content (89.2 ± 7.4 mg/g) in 80EETC. 80EETC administration significantly decreased body weight, body fat ratio, serum lipid levels (TC, TG, and LDL-C), adipose tissue accumulation, malondialdehyde (MDA), and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) in HFD-fed mice. Furthermore, supplementation with 80EETC reduced the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio and enhanced the relative abundance of gut microbiota (p_Bacteroidetes, f_Lactobacillus, f_Muribaculaceae, f_Prevotellaceae, g_Lactobacillus, g_Prevotellaceae_NK3B31_group, g_Ruminococcaceae_UCG-013, and g_Ruminococcaceae_UCG-014), which negatively correlated with obesity-related factors such as body weight, energy intake, fat accumulation in adipose tissue, TC, TG, LDL, and MDA. In conclusion, RA-rich 80EETC had a protective effect against obesity development and it has potential in healthy food applications.",

METHODS: The synthetic RA-SS-mPEG was characterized with NMR spectroscopy, before preparation of luteolin-coated RA-SS-mPEG polymer micelles. The in vitro characterization and evaluation of the formulation were accomplished, couple with its pharmacokinetic parameters. The levels of PEG2, MDA, CRP and GSH, as well as concentrations of TNF-α, IL1-β, IL-6 and IL-10 in serum and colon tissue were detected via ELISA kit. The degree of colon injury and inflammation was evaluated via histopathologic examination. RESULTS: L-RSPMs displayed small average droplet size (133.40 ± 4.52 nm), uniformly dispersed (PDI: 0.163 ± 0.011), good stability, slow release and enhanced solubility. We observed 353.28% increase in the relative bioavailability of L-RSPMs compared to free luteolin, while the half-life of the micelle was extended by 6.16h. Compared to model (M) group, luteolin (low and high doses) and L-RSPMs (low and high doses) significantly reduced levels of MDA, PEG2, CRP, TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-1β in colon tissue and serum of colitic rats but dose dependently increased IL-10 and SOD levels (p < 0.01). Histopathologic examination of colon showed that luteolin (low and high doses) and L-RSPMs (low and high doses) improved colonic inflammation in colitic rats to varying degrees compared to M group. CONCLUSION: L-RSPMs could improve TNBS-induced colon inflammation by enhancing bioavailability, promoting antioxidant effects and regulating cytokine release, which may become a potential agent for UC treatment in clinical settings.",

      "abstract": "In the present work Origanum dictamnus L. was studied as a suitable in vitro adventitious root culture system for the production of important bioactive molecules, such as rosmarinic acid (RA). Callus culture was initiated from leaf, petiole and root explants on solid MS medium supplemented with either 5 μM NAA + 5 μM kinetin (ODK3) or 5 μM NAA + 0.5 μM kinetin (ODK4). New roots formed from leaf, petiole and root calluses were aseptically transferred into Erlenmeyer flasks containing 100 mL liquid medium and shaken at 120 rpm in the dark. The liquid medium used was the MS supplemented either with 35 μM IBA + 2.5 μM kinetin (ODY1) or 5 μM NAA + 0.5 μM kinetin (ODY2). Biomass production parameters, RA content (%) and yield index (YI) were recorded for each treatment explant type, medium composition and incubation period. Results showed, in every case, the production of RA in vitro. Between the two liquid media (ODY1, ODY2) and the different culture periods, the ODY1 medium and the longest 200-day-culture period were more effective for RA and biomass production, regardless of the initial explant type used. The combination of ODK4-ODY1 resulted in higher RA (5.1% and 4.7%), fresh biomass production (19.0 g and 11.6 g), mean YI (93.7 mg and 51.4 mg) and YI per explant (3.75 mg and 2.06 mg) for roots derived from leaf calluses and root calluses, respectively. However, the solid ODK3 (200 days)-liquid ODY1 (40 days) transition treatment was more beneficial for roots derived from petiole calluses leading to an 18.8-fold increase in fresh biomass growth rate. RA accumulation and YIs were also significantly influenced by explant type, with the highest value produced from root petiole calluses (6.6% RA dry weight, 115.3 mg mean YI and 4.61 mg YI per explant) after 240 days."

      "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a multifaceted neurodegenerative disorder characterized by substantial neuronal damage which manifests in the form of deficits in memory and cognition. In spite of the debilitating nature of Alzheimer's disease (AD), a dearth of treatment strategies calls for the need to develop therapeutic agents that stimulate neurogenesis and alleviate the associated cognitive deficits. The present study investigates the therapeutic potential of two major phytochemicals, rosmarinic acid (RA) and ursolic acid (UA) in an amyloid beta1-42 (Aβ1-42)-induced model of AD. UA, a natural pentacyclic triterpenoid and RA, a phenolic ester are major bioactive constituents of Rosmarinus officinalis, which is a medicinal herb belonging to family Lamiaceae and exhibiting significant biological properties including neuroprotection. Donepezil, a second generation cholinesterase inhibitor approved for the treatment of mild, moderate and severe Alzheimer's disease (AD) is used as control. Out of eight groups of male BALB/c mice, stereotaxic surgery was performed on four groups (n = 6 each) to introduce Aβ1-42 in the hippocampus followed by treatment with vehicle (phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)), donepezil, UA or RA. The other four groups were given vehicle, donepezil, UA and RA only. Behavior analysis for social interaction was performed which constitutes the social affiliation and the social novelty preference test. Presence of Aβ plaques and expression of neurogenesis markers i.e., doublecortin (DCX) and Ki-67 were also assessed. Results revealed the neuroprotective effect of UA and RA observed through substantial reduction in Aβ plaques as compared to the Aβ1-42- and donepezil-treated groups. The neuronal density was also restored as evident via DCX and Ki-67 immunoreactivity in Aβ1-42 + RA and Aβ1-42+UA-treated groups in comparison to Aβ1-42-treated and Aβ1-42+donepezil-treated groups. The social affiliation was reestablished in the Aβ1-42 administered groups treated with UA and RA. Molecular docking studies further validated the comparable binding of UA and RA with Ki-67 and DCX to that of donepezil. Our findings suggest that UA and RA are potential neuroprotective compounds that reverses the histological hallmarks of AD and ameliorate impaired social memory and hippocampal neurogenesis."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: There is no doubt that Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the greatest threats facing mankind today. Within the next few decades, Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AChEIs) will be the most widely used treatment for Alzheimer's disease. The withdrawal of the first generation AChEIs drug Tacrine (TAC)/ Cognex from the market as a result of hepatotoxicity has always been an interesting case study. Rosmarinic acid (RA) is a natural compound of phenolic acids that has pharmacological activity for inhibiting Alzheimer's disease, as well as liver protection. PURPOSE AND STUDY DESIGN: In this study, we determined that RA can reduce the hepatotoxicity of TAC, and both of them act synergistically to inhibit the progression of AD in mice. METHODS: In addition to the wild type mice (WT) group, the 6-month-old APP/PS1 (APPswe/PSEN1dE9) double-transgenic (Tg) mice were randomly divided into 6 groups: Tg group, TAC group, RA group, TAC+Silymarin (SIL) group, TAC+RA-L (Rosmarinic Acid Low Dose) goup and TAC+RA-H (Rosmarinic Acid High Dose) group. A series of experiments were carried out, including open field test, Morris water maze test, Hematoxylin - Eosin (HE) staining, Nissl staining, biochemical analysis, immunofluorescence analysis, western blotting analysis and so on. RESULTS: RA combined with TAC could enter the brain tissue of AD mice, and the combination of drugs could better improve the cognitive behavior and brain pathological damage of AD mice, reduce the expression of A β oligomer, inhibit the deposition of A β, inhibit the activity of AChE and enhance the level of Ach in hippocampus. Both in vivo and in vitro experiments showed that RA could alleviate the hepatotoxicity or liver injury induced by TAC. The Western blot analysis of the liver of AD mice showed that RA combined with TAC might inhibit the apoptosis of Bcl-2/Bax, reduce the programmed apoptosis mediated by caspase-3 and reduce the burden of liver induced by TAC, could inhibit the development of liver apoptosis by alleviating the hepatotoxicity of TAC and inhibiting the phosphorylation of JNK. CONCLUSION: The potential drug combination that combines rosmarinic acid with tacrine could reduce tacrine's hepatotoxicity as well as enhance its therapeutic effect on Alzheimer's disease.",

Transient receptor potential canonical channel 1 (TRPC1) is a important target for myocardial injury treatment. OBJECTIVE: This work screens the active component acting on TRPC1 from Salvia miltiorrhizae. MATERIALS AND METHODS: TCM Systems Pharmacology Database and Analysis Platform (TCMSP) was used to retrieve Salvia miltiorrhiza compounds for preliminary screening by referring to Lipinski's rule of five. Then, the compound group was comprehensively scored by AutoDock Vina based on TRPC1 protein. Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) was used to determine the affinity of the optimal compound to TRPC1 protein. Western blot assay was carried out to observe the effect of the optimal compound on TRPC1 protein expression in HL-1 cells, and Fura-2/AM detection was carried out to observe the effect of the optimal compound on calcium influx in HEK293 cells. RESULTS: Twenty compounds with relatively good characteristic parameters were determined from 202 compounds of Salvia miltiorrhiza. Rosmarinic acid (RosA) was obtained based on the molecular docking scoring function. RosA had a high binding affinity to TRPC1 protein (KD value = 1.27 µM). RosA (50 μM) could reduce the protein levels (417.1%) of TRPC1 after oxygen-glucose deprivation/reperfusion (OGD/R) in HL-1 cells and it could inhibit TRPC1-mediated Ca2+ influx injury (0.07 ΔRatio340/380) in HEK293 cells. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: We obtained the potential active component RosA acting on TRPC1 from Salvia miltiorrhizae, and we speculate that RosA may be a promising clinical candidate for myocardial injury therapy.",

Various online databases, including PubMed, Science Direct, EMBASE, Web of Sciences, Cochrane trials, and Scopus, were searched from inception until October 2022. Due to the suppression of the nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) pathway, the main factor in allergic asthma, RA may be a promising candidate for the treatment of asthma. The other ingredients comprising CA and UA reduce the expression of interleukin (IL)-4, IL-5, and IL-13 and improve airway inflammation. Rosemary's anti-cancer effect is mediated by several mechanisms, including DNA fragmentation, apoptosis induction, inhibition of astrocyte-upregulated gene-1 expression, and obstruction of cell cycle progression in the G1 phase. The compounds, essentially found in Rosemary essential oil, prevent smooth muscle contraction through its calcium antagonistic effects, inhibiting acetylcholine (ACH), histamine, and norepinephrine stimulation. Additionally, CA exhibits a substantially greater interaction with the nicotinic ACH receptor than a family of medications that relax the smooth muscles, making it a potent antispasmodic treatment. The components have demonstrated therapeutic effects on the immune, allergy, and respiratory disorders.",
