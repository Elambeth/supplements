      "abstract": "The human gut contains a complex and highly variable microbial ecosystem of which the composition is affected by the health condition, lifestyle and diet of the host. Fermented dairy products harbour microorganisms favourable to the human gut microbial community. Mabisi, a spontaneous fermented local dairy product from Zambia, carries a variety of potentially beneficial microorganisms. Using the gastrointestinal tract (GI-tract) model system, SHIME®, we tested how the administration of mabisi affects the composition and functionality of the human colon gut microbiota. After ten days of feeding mabisi into the GI-tract model system, the composition of the gut microbial community shifted towards a more even distribution of genera was similar to the community composition obtained by intervention with a standard prebiotic, fructooligosaccharide (FOS). This effect remained even when mabisi was heat-treated and all bacteria there were killed prior to the administration. Comparably to FOS, the microbial shift after mabisi treatment coincides with an increase in concentration of short chain fatty acids. Our findings suggest that mabisi carries important bioactive compounds with a prebiotic potential and might support and stabilize the gut microbial community."

      "abstract": "The incidence of bovine mastitis caused by K. pneumoniae increases during summer. This experiment aimed to clarify the connection between heat stress and K. pneumoniae-induced mastitis in terms of inflammatory responses and barrier function. From day 9-16 of the postpartum period, lactating rats were exposed to 35 °C in the daytime and 29 °C at night to establish a heat stress model. On day 8 of the heat stress treatment, the rat mastitis model was established by intramammary infection with K. pneumoniae through the milk ducts. At 12 h post-infection, the rectal temperature, serum biochemistry, K. pneumoniae burden, as well as histopathology, epithelium integrity, inflammatory response, and HSP70 expression of the mammary glands were detected. The results showed that heat-stressed rats with K. pneumoniae infection displayed higher rectal temperatures, more neutrophil infiltration, and more significant pathological damage to the acinar lumen. Heat stress promoted the disruption of the structural integrity of tight junction and the downregulation of relative protein expressions (ZO-1, Occludin, and Claudin-3) as a consequence of the increased production of inflammatory parameters (endotoxin, MPO, IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α) by accelerating NF-κB pathway activation and HSP70 expression after K. pneumoniae infection. Thus, heat stress disrupts mammary epithelium integrity, contributing to the pathogen invasion, and aggravates intramammary damage during K. pneumoniae mastitis by facilitating barrier disruption and inflammatory response, which could trigger more severe mastitis."

      "abstract": "The nutrient-rich composition of milk creates an optimal environment for bacterial proliferation, making the inhibition of microbial growth essential for maintaining dairy product quality and ensuring consumer safety. Klebsiella pneumoniae is an important contaminant of milk and a leading cause of bovine mastitis. Although the increasingly serious antibiotic resistance has led to a renewed interest in phage therapy, research on antimicrobial potential of Klebsiella phages in milk remains scarce. The K5 serotype of K. pneumoniae is a major concern due to its high virulence and prevalence in dairy farming operations. Despite its clinical and economic importance, the availability of phages specifically targeting this serotype remains substantially limited. Here, we successfully isolated and sequenced 2 K1-specific Klebsiella phages, P284 and P287, and one K5-specific Klebsiella phage P252. We identified the receptor-binding proteins with depolymerization activity in these phages. The phage library against K5 K. pneumoniae was enriched by phage genome modification. Specifically, we replaced the receptor-binding protein of K1-specific phage P284 with that of K5-specific phage P252, resulting in the generation of recombinant phages T and F, which exhibit specific lytic activity against K5 K. pneumoniae. Compared with phage P252, recombinant phages T and F exhibited better and more prolonged antibacterial potential in planktonic assay. In addition, all these K5-specific phages could significantly inhibit bacterial growth and reduce bacterial populations in milk at 4°C and 38°C. In summary, this study provided K5-specific phages with potential application in managing K. pneumoniae contamination and infection in the dairy industry."

The aim was to compare prebiotic effects of HMOs (2'FL, 3'FL, 3'SL, 6'SL, LNT, LNnT, and 1:1 ratio mixes of 2'FL/3'SL and 3'SL/LNT) in faecal samples from irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) donors and healthy controls, and to determine the best-performing HMO in IBS. Fluorescent in situ hybridisation coupled with flow cytometry was utilised to study microbiota changes in major colonic genera, and organic acid production was assessed by gas chromatography. IBS donors had different starting microbial profiles compared to healthy controls and lower levels of organic acids. In response to HMOs, there were alterations in both the control and IBS faecal microbiomes. In IBS donor fermenters, Bifidobacterium, Faecalibacterium, total bacterial numbers, and organic acid production significantly increased post-HMO intervention. When comparing the effect of HMO interventions on the microbiota and organic acid production, a mix of 3'SL/LNT HMOs may be the most promising intervention for IBS patients."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Enteric and diarrheal diseases pose a significant threat to infant health, highlighting the importance of immune defenses in early life, especially maternal protection, in establishing a robust gastrointestinal environment. Surfactin, a bioactive peptide from Bacillus subtilis, has immunomodulatory properties, yet its influence on offspring via maternal gut interference is not fully understood. This study examines the effects of maternal surfactin consumption on breast milk's immunological properties and its consequent effects on neonatal intestinal health. METHODS: Twenty-eight gravid mice were randomly categorized into two cohorts and were given surfactin or not in drinking water from one week after conception to 21 days postpartum. Cross-fostering experiments were conducted within 12 h after birth. Pups from the surfactin-supplemented dams were fostered and nursed by the control dams, while the pups from the control dams were nursed by the surfactin-supplemented dams. RESULTS: The findings show that the pups from the surfactin-supplemented dams had increased body weight, improved intestinal morphology with longer villus and deeper crypts, the upregulation of genes related to mucins and antimicrobial peptides, and an increase in IgA+ and CD3+ T cells within the intestinal mucosa. Further, the cross-fostering experiments suggested that the pups nursed by the surfactin-supplemented dams gained more weight, had less intestinal damage, less inflammation, and lower oxidative stress levels induced by Salmonella typhimurium, indicating the immunological benefits of surfactin conveyed through breast milk. Additionally, the expression of pro-inflammatory factors, including nitric oxide, TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, MCP-1, and ROS, induced by LPS in the macrophages was significantly inhibited with milk from the surfactin-supplemented dam (MSD) treatment. Interestingly, the MSD treatment induced a shift in macrophage polarization from pro-inflammatory (M1-like) to anti-inflammatory (M2-like), evidenced by the decreased expression of IL-12p40 and iNOS and the increased expression of CD206, TGF-β, and Arg-1. In terms of mechanism, surfactin improved the contents of the anti-inflammatory factors IL-4, IL-10, and TGF-β in the breast milk. CONCLUSIONS: This research contributes to understanding how maternal interference can modulate breast milk composition, influence infant gastrointestinal development and immunity, and provide nutritional strategy insights.",

AIM: This study aimed to examine the effects of \"oral administration of breast milk droplets\" and \"palatal stimulation with a finger\" methods on feed tolerance in preterm newborns fed via an orogastric tube. METHODS: This randomized controlled trial was conducted in the neonatal intensive care unit of a private hospital. The study included 90 premature newborns born at the 28th-36th gestational weeks and admitted to intensive care. We applied breast milk droplets inside the oral cavity of newborns (30) in one of the intervention groups and stimulated the palate of newborns (30) by using a finger in the other. We performed these interventions every 3 hours for 5 minutes at the feeding times of the newborns for 7 days. Babies in the control group were not applied any intervention. We used SPSS (Statistical Package for Social Sciences) 22.0 for Windows software for statistical analyses. RESULTS: The number of defecations, frequencies of residuals, body weight, and abdominal circumference were significantly different between the groups (P < 0.05). The increments in body weight and reductions in abdominal circumference were significantly different between the groups in the study (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Palatal stimulation with a finger acted on feed tolerance more favorably than the oral administration of breast milk droplets or no intervention in preterm infants fed via OGT. We suggest primarily that palatal stimulation with a finger and secondarily the oral administration of breast milk droplets as the two methods to be employed to overcome feeding intolerance, which is a significant problem in premature infants.",

      "abstract": "This study investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying the formation of dense aging gels in skimmed milk subjected to different direct ultra-high temperature (dUHT) treatments. The results showed that in accelerated assays, plasmin could interact with αs1-casein (αs1-CN), αs2-CN, β-CN, κ-CN, and La through van der Waals interactions, hydrophobic interactions, and hydrogen bonding. During storage, dUHT milk samples treated at 147 °C for 6 s, 142 °C for 6 s, and 142 °C for 3 s exhibited an 8 % reduction in α-helix content, along with an increase in β-fold and irregular curl content. The dUHT treatment disrupted the tertiary structure of milk protein molecules, leading to a decrease in surface hydrophobicity and surface free sulfhydryl content. Peptidomics analysis indicated that plasmin mainly hydrolyzed α-CN and β-CN. The hydrolysis sites of four casein monomers and whey proteins by plasmin were identified, and this was further confirmed by molecular docking. Peptide hydrogel modeling and molecular dynamics results demonstrated that electrostatic interactions, van der Waals forces, and hydrogen bonding were the key forces maintaining the three-dimensional mesh structure of peptide hydrogel gels. This study revealed the formation mechanism of dUHT milk aging gel, which has practical guidance for the process of dUHT milk processing."

Metagenomic analysis revealed that Lactococcus spp., Lactobacillus spp., and Staphylococcus spp. were the dominant genera in raw milk, while Pseudomonas spp. became more prevalent after 14 days of refrigerated storage. The microorganisms in raw milk were isolated using selective media and identified as Serratia quinivorans 4364 and Latilactobacillus curvatus DSM 20019. To compare the UV resistance of these microorganisms, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Lactococcus lactis, and Latilactobacillus curvatus were inoculated into sterilized milk and subjected to UV-C treatment. The reduction rates of P. aeruginosa were significantly lower than those of the other strains (S. aureus, L. lactis, and L. curvatus). These findings provide insights into the microbial distribution in raw milk and the degree of resistance to UV treatment, which can serve as fundamental data for the pasteurization of raw milk."

Four milk treatments were examined using a benchtop Optisep filtration system: skim milk (SM) processed in UF at 15 °C, homogenized WM processed in UF at 15 °C (T1), non-homogenized WM processed in UF at 15 °C (T2), and non-homogenized WM processed at 43 °C (T3). UF was performed using 10 kDa membranes to achieve 3× concentration, and the retention and flux rates were compared across treatments. Compositional changes were analyzed at each stage: initial, retentate (2X, 3X, Final), and permeate. The permeate flux varied across treatments; SM showed the highest initial permeate flux and achieved the target concentration in a shorter time. T1 maintained a steady permeate flux over time. T2 exhibited a steep decline in flux, reaching only a 2.5× concentration. In contrast, T3 initially displayed a higher permeate flux due to heat treatment and reduced viscosity. There were significant differences in compositional parameters. T1 retentate had significantly (p < 0.05) higher crude protein (CP), Ca, Mg, and Zn retention. Higher total solids (TS), non-protein nitrogen (NPN), and non-casein nitrogen (NCN), K, and P content were found in T3 permeate. The results from this study demonstrate that homogenization and heat treatment significantly impact the UF performance of WM, offering valuable approaches for achieving dairy product composition."

The experimental subjects were randomly divided into two homogeneous groups, control (CTL) and trace element (TE). The donkeys in the TE group were fed a diet supplemented with Zn, Fe, Cu, Mn, Se, Co, and I. The dietary treatment did not significantly affect neither the milk yield per milking nor the milk macro ingredients. However, these variables were significantly affected by the stage of lactation. The serum concentrations of total Ca, P, Na, and K were not affected by the dietary treatment, but the serum Mg level in the TE group was significantly higher than that in the CTL group (26.6 vs. 25.0 mg/L). The effect of stage of lactation was found to be significant for all the investigated minerals in the blood serum, and negative trends were observed for serum Ca, P, Mg, Na, and K during the experimental period."

Furthermore, when maternal milk is unavailable, donor human milk, which goes through a rigorous preparation process including pooling and pasteurization, is used. The different pasteurization methods can have implications for the bioactive components of human milk.

      "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of using different levels of flaxseed in dairy cattle diet on performance and milk fatty acid profile. For this purpose, 9 lactating Holstein cows of the same parity and lactation stage were used. The study followed a crossover design with three periods, three treatment groups, and three cows per group. Each period lasted 21 days, of which 14 days was the adaptation period and 7 days was the data collection period. During the experiment, 2 different concentrate feeds were used, along with corn silage, vetch hay, wet sugar beet pulp, and straw as roughages. Feeds were prepared as a total mixed ration. Cows in control, 1st and 2nd treatment groups received a diet containing 0, 250 and 500 g/d flaxseed, respectively. Adding flaxseed to the diet did not affect dry matter intake, milk yield, feed efficiency, or milk fat, lactose, and urea nitrogen (P > 0.05). However, it increased omega-3 fatty acids in milk and decreased the ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 fatty acids (P < 0.05). Results showed that adding different levels of flaxseed to the diets increased omega-3 fatty acids in milk without negatively affecting performance or fat percentages, making it suitable for producing functional milk.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Recurrent herpes simplex (RHS) is a disease caused by reactivation of the herpes simplex virus. Patients with RHS are treated with anti-herpes virus medication. Amenamevir is one such medication used for RHS in Japan and is administered as patient-initiated therapy (PIT); this involves initiation at the discretion of the patient, based on early symptoms. However, there are insufficient data on the transfer of amenamevir into breast milk among breastfeeding patients with RHS. OBJECTIVES: This study aims to assess the transfer of amenamevir into breast milk and evaluate the infant's risk of drug exposure. METHODS: This study is a single-arm, open-label, interventional multicenter study. Patients who experience RHS during breastfeeding will be recruited and treated with amenamevir. The concentration of amenamevir in breast milk will be determined by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. The primary outcome is relative infant dose (RID) calculated by Cave[AUC(0-24 h)]. The secondary outcome is RID calculated by Cmax and Cave[AUC(0-48 h)]. DISCUSSION: This study will provide evidence of the transfer profile of amenamevir into breast milk during PIT. If the RID of amenamevir is less than 10%, such therapy is generally considered to be safe, and use of PIT with amenamevir may consequently lead to a new standard therapy for breastfeeding patients."

The Breast Milk Mother applications offer an alternative to provide information on breastfeeding. This study aims to analyze the effectiveness of the Breast Milk Mother mobile applications in increasing knowledge, attitudes, breastfeeding timing, and breast milk adequacy for infants. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This quasiexperimental study with a pre-post control design was conducted in 2022 in Candirejo, Magetan, East Java, Indonesia. The sample consisted of 100 pregnant women in their third trimester until their infants were 7 days old, divided into two groups: intervention (50) and control (50). Purposive sampling was used, with the intervention group receiving the Breast Milk Mother applications, while the control group received breastfeeding counseling. Data on knowledge and attitude were collected using questionnaires and analyzed using the Mann-Whitney U test and Wilcoxon test, with significance set at p < 0.05. RESULTS: There was no significant difference in knowledge and attitudes between the intervention and control groups before treatment (Z = -0.40, p > 0.05 and Z = -0.66, p > 0.05). After treatment, significant differences were found (Z = -7.81, p < 0.001 and Z = -5.76, p < 0.001). In both groups, significant improvements in knowledge and attitudes were observed post treatment (Z = -6.10, p < 0.001 for the intervention group and Z = -5.66, p < 0.001 for the control group). CONCLUSIONS: The Breast Milk Mother mobile applications effectively improve knowledge, attitudes, breastfeeding timing, and breast milk adequacy for infants. The Breast Milk Mother mobile applications support exclusive breastfeeding and enhance midwifery services."

The present study examines the gut microbiota diversity in obesity-induced rats treated with intermittent fasting, fermented camel milk (FCM), and FCM-incorporated Sukkari date or their combinations. The metagenomic analysis of the gut microbiome through 16 S rRNA revealed 226 families, 499 genera, and 879 bacterial species. In the taxonomy distributions and heatmap analysis, Bacteroidota (i.e., Prevotella) had the uppermost relative abundance in groups before treatments (Before_Groups, most samples clustered in one sub-cluster) reached 80.50% in sample S11 (Before_G2), whereas Firmicutes (i.e., Lactobacillus) presented the dominant in groups after treatments (After_Groups, generality samples grouped in another sub-cluster) and counted 70.86% in sample S88 (After_G6), reflecting potential short-chain fatty acids production. The alpha and beta diversity explored by Shannon and PCoA indices presented high diversity in most groups after treatment. Deferribacterota and Fusobacteriota, in addition to Stenotrophomonas and Listeria, were the key phylotypes in the treated groups at the Phylum and genus levels, respectively. The proposed functional pathways involving mannan, rhamnose I, glucose, and xylose degradation were the most supported pathways in After_Groups with potential carbohydrate degradation. Eventually, intermittent fasting and probiotic fermented camel milk increased microbiome diversity and accelerated weight loss, preventing health issues.",

Twenty-three (BW = 532 ± 9.13 kg; age 36 mo) crossbred Angus cows were randomly assigned to three treatment groups: (1) not supplemented (CON, n = 7); (2) supplemented with 250 mg/head/day (PHYT250, n = 8); or (3) supplemented with 500 mg/head/day (PHYT500, n = 8) of the botanical supplement. The cows were individually fed the supplement from 30 days (±6 days) pre-calving to 60 days post-calving. Colostrum was collected on d 0 (pre-suckling), and d 1, d 2, and d 3 post-calving. The total milk from all quarters was collected 45 and 90 d post-calving and at weaning. Colostrum and milk volumes were recorded, and samples were analyzed for percentages of fat, protein, milk urea nitrogen, other solids, and lactose. Colostrum samples were analyzed for concentrations of IgG, IgA, and IgM, and milk samples were analyzed for IgG concentration using radial immunodiffusion. Blood samples were collected from dams and calves, and serum was analyzed for concentrations of IgG (cows and calves) and IgA (calves). Cow and calf BW were measured periodically until weaning. Supplementation with PHYT linearly increased fat in colostrum (CON = 3.29, PHIT250 = 4.23, and PHYT500 = 4.17 ± 0.77%; p = 0.05) and IgA in calf serum (96.91, 151.69, and 183.42 ± 29.78 mg/dL for CON, PHYT250, and PHYT500, respectively; p = 0.04) and tended to linearly increase concentrations of fat in milk (CON = 3.84, PHYT250 = 4.05, and PHYT500 = 4.71 ± 1.04%; p = 0.07), IgG in calf serum (2082.31; 2196.29; and 2577.78 ± 213.08 mg/dL for CON, PHYT250, and PHYT500, respectively; p = 0.09), and IgM in colostrum (CON = 179.04; PHYT250 = 170.79; PHYT500 = 218.30 ± 16.08 mg/dL; p = 0.09). A quadratic response was observed for calf ADG (p = 0.03), where CON (0.99 ± 0.03 kg/d) was less than PHYT250 (1.10 ± 0.03 kg/d), and intermediate values were observed for PHYT500 (1.01 ± 0.03 kg/d). In summary, supplementation with PHYT led to a linear increase in colostrum fat and IgA levels in calf serum. Additionally, supplementation tended to linearly elevate fat concentrations in milk, IgG levels in calf serum, and IgM levels in colostrum. Our results suggest that supplementing beef cows in late gestation and early lactation with 250 or 500 mg/head/d of PHYT improves colostrum quality and calf health and performance. Further investigation is needed to determine both the biological significance and the economic benefits of botanical additives in beef production."

      "abstract": "This study planned to evaluate the impact of low (0.1 mg/kg) and high (1 mg/kg) doses of dexamethasone on the plasma and milk distribution of danofloxacin (6 mg/kg) in sheep after intravenous administration. Utilizing a crossover pharmacokinetic design, the research was conducted on six lactating ewes, with blood and milk samples collected at 18 predetermined time points over a 48-h period. Danofloxacin analysis from plasma and milk samples was performed by high-performance liquid chromatography. The pharmacokinetic data were derived using non-compartmental analysis. Plasma t1/2ʎz, AUC0-∞, ClT, and Vdss values of danofloxacin were found to be 5.20 h, 9.26 h*µg/mL, 0.65 L/h/kg, and 4.23 L/kg, respectively. The administration of both low and high doses of dexamethasone did not result in any changes in the plasma pharmacokinetics of danofloxacin. Milk t1/2ʎz, AUC0-∞, and Cmax values of danofloxacin were 4.30 h, 99.52 h*µg/mL, and 20.61 µg/mL, respectively. Dexamethasone administration resulted in prolonged milk t1/2ʎz, with high-dose dexamethasone significantly enhancing both the milk AUC0-∞ and Cmax of danofloxacin. The AUC0-∞ milk/AUC0-∞ plasma ratio of danofloxacin was 10.75 and was further increased with dexamethasone treatment. These results highlight the necessity for careful evaluation of drug interactions in lactating sheep to ensure both efficacy and safety, as well as the need for further research to establish guidelines for concurrent administration of dexamethasone and danofloxacin."

Pigs were fed each treatment diet with various levels of milk by-products (phase 1: 5%, 10%, 20% or 30%; phase 2: 0%, 5%, 10% or 15%) for 5 weeks. Linear increase of BW, average daily gain, average daily feed intake, and gain to feed ratio with increasing milk by-products was observed in whole experimental period (linear response, p < 0.05). In blood profiles, however, there were no differences in blood urea nitrogen, insulin like growth factor 1, and immunoglobulin A and G among the treatments. In addition, no differences were found in diarrhea incidence and intestinal morphology. In conclusion Increasing milk by-product content in the diets of weaned pigs improved growth performance but high or low level of milk by-product content did not negatively affect blood profiles, diarrhea incidence, and gut health of nursery pigs."

      "abstract": "The use of antibiotics in camels is generally based on the doses applied to cattle, despite the known differences in plasma pharmacokinetics between camel and cattle. The demand for camel milk increased due to the belief that traditional camel farming practices produce safe milk with health benefits. For assessing the importance of antibiotic residues in camel milk and to propose a convenient withdrawal period, a trial was conducted on 10 lactating camels (7-12 years old; 450 kg life weight (LW), 7-8 liter of milk production per day) at mid-lactation receiving an injection of 40 mL of Pen-strep® (benzylpenicillin-procaine 200,000 IU/1 ml and dihydrostreptomycin sulfate 200 mg/1 ml) and Nitox® (oxytetracycline dihydrate 200 mg/1 ml). The antibiotic residues were measured in the milk 30 min after injection then on day 1, 2, 3, 7, 9, 14, 19, 24 and 56 by using HPLC-MS/MS. Results showed that penicillin's mean residual concentration (0.3 ± 0.013 mg/kg) remained 7.5 times above the maximum residue limit (MRL) even on 56th day. In contrast, streptomycin fell below the MRL within 30 minutes and averaged 1 µg/kg by day 56. Oxytetracycline levels exceeded the MRL (0.1 mg/kg) until day 14 but dropped to a safe level of 0.018 ± 0.01 mg/kg by day 24. In conclusion, the decline in streptomycin concentration post-injection appeared rapid and efficient, the elimination of penicillin and tetracycline was slow. These preliminary results lead to considering the necessity to adapt the waiting time to the dairy camel.",

Forty mature crossbred Angus beef cows (6 ± 2.0 y, 534 ± 60 kg BW) were used each year along with their suckling steer calves (84 ± 8.7 d, 130 ± 15 kg BW). Cows were stratified by early-lactation milk yield and randomly assigned to 1 of 5 levels of metabolizable energy intake. Each treatment group was housed in a dry lot pen. During yr 1, maternal MEI ranged from 225 to 320 kcal·BW0.75·d-1, while in yr 2, MEI ranged from 215 to 288 kcal·BW0.75·d-1. Calves were provided ad libitum access to the same TMR diet as the cows in a creep area. Parameters evaluated included apparent total tract nutrient digestibility, milk production and nutritional composition, cow body weight (BW), body condition score (BCS), ultrasound carcass characteristics, calf BW, and calf creep feed intake. Data were analyzed using the GLIMMIX procedure of SAS (SAS Inst. Inc., Cary, NC) as a general linear mixed model. The final model included the linear effect of maternal metabolizable energy intake as a fixed effect and year of experiment as a random effect. Significance of the fixed effects was declared when P ≤ 0.05, while tendencies were declared when 0.05 < P ≤ 0.10. Cow 100-d BW, BCS and ADG linearly increased (all, P < 0.01) with increasing levels of maternal MEI. Similarly, calf 100-d BW and ADG linearly increased (P = 0.03, P < 0.01, respectively) with increasing maternal MEI. Milk yield, milk energy production and all milk nutrients linearly increased (P ≤ 0.04) with increasing maternal MEI, except for milk urea nitrogen (MUN) which significantly decreased (P < 0.01). Cow energy partitioned to tissue accretion and milk production linearly increased (both, P < 0.001). As maternal MEI increased, the proportion of net retained energy partitioned to maternal tissue accretion initially increased. However, at approximately 275 kcal·BW0.75·d-1 of maternal MEI, the proportion plateaued. Increased maternal MEI reduced the efficiency of calf BW gain (BW gain per unit of calf MEI from both creep feed and milk) in a linear fashion (P = 0.03). These findings suggest that maternal energy intake, rather than genetic capacity for milk yield, limited milk energy production in these cows. Furthermore, the maximum proportion of retained energy as maternal tissue was achieved at about 275 kcal·BW0.75·d-1."

This paper explores the effects of hyaluronic acid (HA)-modified mEXOs (HA-mEXOs) in LUAD. HA-mEXOs were isolated and prepared, and PMX-resistant cells were developed. CCK-8, colony formation, Transwell, flow apoptosis, xenograft tumor assay, immunohistochemistry, and TUNEL experiments were conducted to explore the impact of mEXOs and HA-mEXOs on malignant behaviors and PMX sensitivity. The role of ZNF516 and ABCC5 on malignant behaviors and PMX sensitivity was investigated by shRNA lentiviral infection. HA modification increased the uptake and affinity of LUAD cells for mEXOs. mEXOs induced PMX-resistant LUAD cell sensitivity and inhibited their malignant behaviors. mEXOs enhanced PMX sensitivity and inhibited tumor growth. HA-mEXOs had superior effects to mEXOs. ZNF516 was lowered in LUAD-resistant cells and upregulated by mEXOs. ZNF516 bound to the ABCC5 promoter and repressed its transcriptional activation. The combined knockdown of ZNF516 reversed the antitumor benefits of mEXOs. HA-mEXOs-carrying ZNF516 enhance ZNF516 levels in LUAD/PMX cells and repress ABCC5, which in turn induces cell sensitivity to PMX and inhibits LUAD progression.",

The presence of veterinary drug residues in milk constitutes a potential risk to human health and undesirable effects on consumers. In this study, a chromatographic method was developed and optimized for quantitative analysis of imidocarb dipropionate (IMD), flunixin meglumine (FNM), and sulfadimidine (SDD) residues in milk. These drugs are used together as a combination therapy for the management of anaplasmosis in cattle. The chromatographic separation was performed using an ODS Hypersil C18 column with UV detection at 270 nm. The mobile phase consisted of 0.05 M phosphate buffer, pH 3: acetonitrile: methanol (55:30:15, by volume), with a flow rate of 1 mL/min. Before analysis, a protein precipitation procedure was performed to extract the studied drugs from milk by using methanol as an extractor/deproteinization agent. The proposed method was successfully employed to quantify the studied drug residues in cattle milk samples within and after their withdrawal periods. The developed method was statistically compared with reported methods, demonstrating no significant difference in terms of accuracy and precision. Greenness and environmental impact were also evaluated for the proposed procedure, verifying it was a green and eco-friendly analytical method."

      "abstract": "Lameness, defined as an impaired gait, impacts cow welfare and performance, compromising future health and production, and increasing culling risk. Untargeted milk lipidomics, together with the use of machine learning methods, have shown promise in identifying potential biomarkers for the early detection of lameness, before the development of visible clinical lameness. Prediction of early lameness would allow for the earlier implementation of management and treatment strategies, ultimately reducing the negative consequences. This study aimed to evaluate the predictive accuracy of differences in the milk metabolome and identify milk lipid biomarkers for early lameness detection in first-lactation dairy cows. Untargeted lipidomics and machine learning approaches were used to evaluate the differences in the milk metabolomic profiles in samples collected from heifers during the transition period (before lameness) and at the time of first lameness onset. A total of 56 milk samples from 32 cows (16 lame, 16 control) were analyzed by liquid chromatography-high-resolution mass spectrometry after calving (before lameness) and at lameness onset. Elastic net regression achieved 83% accuracy in predicting lameness from samples collected after calving and 100% accuracy at the time of lameness. A total of 10 mass ions selected by different statistical methods showed potential to be considered predictors of lameness. Pathway analysis revealed significant dysregulation of retinol metabolism after calving in cows that go on to develop lameness in that lactation. This study demonstrated potential for using milk lipidomics for early lameness detection. This, in turn, provides insights into lameness pathogenesis, furthering our understanding of lameness, with the ultimate goal of developing interventions to improve dairy cow welfare and farm productivity."

      "abstract": "Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) with their potential health benefits are naturally prevalent in dairy and fermented food products. This probiotic microbiota can be an alternative biological tool for controlling other pathogenic bacteria. The study aimed to isolate lactic acid bacteria (LAB) from raw cow milk and evaluate their probiotic potential. Twelve gram-positive isolates showing tolerance to bile salt, acid, and low pH were identified by 16S rRNA sequencing, which revealed the isolates belong to the genera including Lactococcus, Enterococcus, Streptococcus, Bacillus, and Weissella. In case of probiotic potential, the isolates exhibited arrays of probiotic properties: autoaggregation (33.65-84.63 %), co-aggregation (8.17-83.22 %), cell surface hydrophobicity for both polar (13.37-90.24 %) and non-polar solvents (5.52-53.58 %) and able to form biofilm (75 % weak, 16.67 % moderate and 8.33 % strong). Statistical analysis revealed the correlation pattern between the probiotic properties and showed a significant strong positive correlation between cell surface hydrophobicity and aggregation. Additionally, three isolates L. lactis, W. confusa, and E. gallinarum that were sensitive to antibiotics, able to produce biofilm, and did not contain virulence genes were able to reduce the biofilm formation of pathogen K. pneumoniae (1.3-4 log) in the co-culture assay. These Findings suggest that LAB from the raw cow milk could serve as a natural biocontrol agent for preventing and controlling K. pneumoniae biofilm formation and pave the way for innovative intervention of LAB in food safety and clinical settings."

      "abstract": "Cadmium (Cd) contamination in plants and soil poses significant risks to livestock, particularly sheep. Cd exposure often leads to severe gastrointestinal diseases in sheep that are difficult to treat. Milk-derived exosomes, particularly those from sheep milk (SM-Exo), have shown potential in treating gastrointestinal disorders, though their efficacy in Cd-induced colitis remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the therapeutic potential of SM-Exo in a Cd-induced colitis model. Hu sheep were exposed to Cd, and their fecal microbiota were collected to prepare bacterial solutions for fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) in mice. The changes in gut microbiota and gene expression were analyzed through microbiome and transcriptomics. Our results showed that prior to treatment, harmful bacteria (e.g., Bacteroides and Parabacteroides) were increased in FMT mice. SM-Exo treatment increased beneficial bacteria, particularly Lachnoclostridium, and activated the Cyclic Adenosine Monophosphate (cAMP) pathway, upregulating genes like Adcy1, Adcy3, CREB, and Sst. These changes were linked to reduced Cd-induced cell death and alleviation of colonic inflammation. In conclusion, SM-Exo appears to be a promising treatment for Cd-induced colitis, likely through modulation of the gut microbiota and activation of the cAMP pathway.",

      "abstract": "Wound healing presents a significant challenge in healthcare, imposing substantial physiological and economic burdens. While traditional treatments and stem cell therapies have shown benefits, milk-derived exosomes (MDEs) offer distinct advantages as a cell-free therapeutic approach. MDEs, isolated from mammalian milk, are characterized by their biocompatibility, ease of acquisition, and high yield, making them a promising tool for enhancing wound repair. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of the composition, sources, and extraction methods of MDEs, with a focus on their therapeutic role in both acute and diabetic chronic wounds. MDEs facilitate wound healing through the delivery of bioactive molecules, modulating key processes such as inflammation, angiogenesis, and collagen synthesis. Their ability to regulate complex wound-healing pathways underscores their potential for widespread clinical application. This review highlights the importance of MDEs in advancing wound management and proposes strategies to optimize their use in regenerative medicine."

      "abstract": "The human milk/plasma (M/P) drug concentration ratio is crucial in pharmacology, especially for breastfeeding mothers undergoing treatment. It determines the extent to which drugs ingested by the mother pass into breast milk, potentially affecting the infant. This study conducted a comprehensive evaluation of multiple machine learning algorithms to assess their effectiveness in predicting the M/P ratio. The dataset consists of 162 drugs and 11 predictor variables. M/P ratios were categorized into two groups of (0, 1) and (≥ 1), and a refined three-category system: (0, < 0.5), (0.5, < 1), and (≥ 1). The ML techniques utilized include K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Neural Networks. We implied the five-fold cross-validation to ensure the model's robustness and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was applied for data visualization. Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) was used in the KNN model selection to balance complexity and explanatory power. In our study, KNN achieved average accuracies of 79% for the two-category system and 60% for the three-category. Random Forest models show 77 and 64% average accuracy, respectively. SVM achieved similar results with 78 and 67%, while Neural Networks have the overall best result among the other models with average accuracies of 82 and 76% accuracy. The study highlights the potential of machine learning (ML) techniques in predicting M/P ratios, offering valuable insights for risk assessment during drug development. These predictive models can serve as a valuable tool for estimating drug transfer into breast milk, helping to bridge knowledge gaps in drug safety for lactating individuals. Further validation and refinement by incorporating larger datasets can enhance their reliability and applicability. Advancing these techniques can support safer medication use and informed clinical decision-making for lactating individuals.",

This study assessed the degradation effect of pulsed electric field (PEF) treatment on OTC, with a particular focus on its protein-bound form. Casein-bound OTC was successfully prepared, and the effectiveness of PEF in removing casein-bound antibiotics was confirmed using DESI-MSI technology. Under optimal treatment conditions, the degradation rates of OTC in casein-free whey (86.30 % - 93.43 %) and milk (82.47 % - 90.31 %) showed no significant difference, further confirming that the removal efficacy of PEF on OTC was unaffected by casein binding. The degradation of OTC in both matrices followed the Hülsheger model. Four major degradation products were identified, involving three distinct pathways: epimerization, demethylation, and deamidation. Furthermore, cytotoxicity assays demonstrated that PEF treatment significantly reduced the overall toxicity of OTC in milk. This study provides an effective and safe strategy for removing OTC residues from milk."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: In infants with chronic kidney disease (CKD), the management of nutrition and growth is highly challenging, particularly compared to older children. Management of hyperkalemia and hyperphosphatemia is difficult, and incorporating potassium and phosphate binders directly in formulas could be beneficial, as it avoids direct ingestion of resins by infants. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a study using Gallia® standard first-stage infant formula and Pregestimil®. We added either carbonate sevelamer (Renvela®, 200, 400 or 800 mg) or polystyrene sulfonate (Resikali®, 2000, 4000 or 8000 mg) to 90 ml of formula. Additionally, we evaluated the combined use of the resins with Gallia® by adding in 90 mL 200 mg/2000 mg, 400 mg/4000 mg, and 200 mg/4000 mg of Renvela® and Resikali®, respectively. The Milk was decanted for 10 minutes, and the resulting supernatants were weighted and analyzed for osmolality and pH. Sodium, potassium, chlore, bicarbonate, magnesium, glucose, calcium, phosphate, protein, cholesterol, triglycerides, iron, folate, vitamin B12 levels were measured after centrifugation. RESULTS: With polystyrene sulfonate, potassium levels in milk decreased in a dose-dependent manner, by 36%, 52% and 68%, respectively. Polystyrene sulfonate also reduced magnesium levels and increased both calcium concentration (from 9.7 to 21 mmol/L) and osmolality (from 359 to 423 mOsm/kg). No significant effect on phosphate was observed. Sevelamer decreased both calcium and phosphate concentrations in a dose-dependent manner, by 14%, 26% and 29%, and by 24%, 36% and 40%, respectively. Sevelamer also increased pH from 6.9 to 9.1, and decreased folate levels by 32%, 66% and 81% respectively, from 465 to 88 mmol/L. The combined use of sevelamer and polystyrene sulfonate results in decreased levels of potassium (by 45%, 59% and 59%, respectively), phosphate (by 38%, 39% and 36%, respectively), and folate, albeit with a slighter increase in pH. Osmolality remained unchanged and no other relevant differences were observed. CONCLUSION: Pretreating formulas with resins is a reproducible and straightforward method when specific diets for CKD are unavailable. However, it is important to keep in mind that resins may impact the overall composition (osmolality) and the concentration of other nutrients (folates).",

      "abstract": "The accurate quantification of food allergens is crucial for ensuring consumer safety and compliance with regulatory requirements. A proficiency test (PT) was organised to evaluate the performance of laboratories in quantifying total egg and total milk protein in cookies. The PT involved 20 laboratories, which reported results using mainly commercial ELISA kits and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The findings indicate a satisfactory performance for milk protein determination among the majority of participant laboratories. However, the quantification of egg proteins in heated products remains a challenge, with most laboratories reporting results significantly below the reference value. Several potential factors contributing to this challenge are discussed, including the denaturation of egg proteins during heat treatment, differences in extraction strategies and the antibodies used in ELISA kits, and the lack of standardised methods and conversion factors for LC-MS/MS analysis. These findings underscore the importance of regular PT exercises to evaluate laboratory performance and ensure compliance with WHO/FAO recommendations. The results of this study aim to guide the development of improved analytical methods and strategies for ensuring the accurate quantification of food allergens."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: We investigated the impact of different classification schemes for postpartum uterine disease on genital tract involution, milk yield, and reproductive performance in dairy cows. The reproductive tracts of 223 Polish Holstein cows were examined between 21 and 29 days postpartum (median 24 days). Transrectal ultrasonography was employed to assess reproductive tract dimensions, vaginoscopy was used for visual scoring of vaginal discharge, and endometrial cytology with the cytobrush was used to calculate the percentage of polymorphonuclear cells (PMN). The health status of the cows was classified using two diagnostics models. Model 1 categorized cows as healthy (H; <5% PMN and absence of purulent vaginal discharge [PVD0]), subclinical endometritis (SE; ≥5% PMN and PVD0), and further subdivided PVD into three categories: flecks of pus in vaginal discharge (PVD1), mucopurulent discharge (PVD2), or purulent discharge including red-brownish watery fetid discharge (PVD3), irrespective of endometrial PMN%. Model 2 classified cows as healthy (H; <5% PMN and PVD0), subclinical endometritis (SE; ≥5% PMN and ≤ PVD1), and clinical endometritis (CE; ≥5% PMN and > PVD1). RESULTS: Cows with ≥ PVD2 (Model 1) and CE (Model 2) had larger cervical and uterine horn diameters and were less likely to resume ovarian activity by the fourth week postpartum in comparison to H and SE. For Model 1, the milk yield to 120 days postpartum was lower in PVD3 in comparison to H while for Model 2, CE produced less milk to 120 days postpartum when compared to H or SE. For both models, SE had a lower first service conception rate than H cows, but the pregnancy risk to 210 days postpartum did not differ. When compared to H, PVD2 (Model 1), and CE (Model 2) had the lowest first service conception rate and pregnancy risk to 210 days postpartum. CONCLUSION: Model 1 provides detailed PVD severity assessment, which is valuable for potential targeted treatment and management but adding complexity due to multiple categories. Model 2 offers simpler categorization for clear management decisions but may overlook disease nuances. Though labor-intensive and less practical for routine use, these protocols are useful for population-level decision-making in dairy farm reproductive performance.",

A feed supplement containing 17.04 % crude protein and 2864.62 Kcal/kg digestible energy was formulated using wheat bran, sorghum grain, sunflower meal and maize germ. A feeding trial was conducted with four dietary treatments i.e. ad libitum fodder browsing without concentrate supplementation (treatment 1-control) and ad libitum fodder browsing plus 1 kg, 1.5 kg and 2 kg concentrate for treatment 2, 3 and 4 respectively. A 4 × 4 Latin square design was used with eight lactating dromedary camels for 56 days and were supplemented every evening. Milking was done in the morning and milk yield recorded. Body weight and milk samples were taken fortnightly. Milk samples were analyzed for constituents and fatty acid composition. Supplementation slightly increased the protein, fat content and milk yield over the experimental period. Milk protein content for treatment 2 and 4 were similar (2.82 %). Adding 2 kg of concentrate displayed higher milk fat content (3.51 %). Total saturated fatty acids in milk were higher (68.13 %) in treatment 2. Unsaturated fatty acids remained relatively constant under all the treatments (29.9 %). Milk proximate and fatty acid profile indicated stable milk composition and supplementation increased yield. Therefore, supplementing lactating camels during dry season increase milk production."

      "abstract": "β-galactosidase (B-gal) is a vital enzyme used in the food industry to reduce lactose from dairy ingredients through hydrolysis and to synthesize galacto-oligosaccharides (GOS), a known bifidogenic prebiotic, from galactose moieties through transgalactosylation. To favor transgalactosylation, high carbohydrate concentrations must be available to accept the galactose moiety. Since many dairy products rely on sweeteners for flavor and texture, B-gal from GRAS status Lactobacillus bulgaricus strains LB11, YB1, L. helveticus B548, or Kluyveromyces lactis (KL) in the commercial product Lactozyme® 2600L were used to determine if transgalactosylation can be driven in reconstituted nonfat dry milk (NDM, 10%, wt/wt) with commercial sweeteners compared with unsweetened NDM at 50°C for 18 h. Sucrose (14.4%, wt/wt), corn syrup solids (14.4%, wt/wt), or a mixture of sucrose (9.9%, wt/wt) and corn syrup solids (4.5%, wt/wt) were dissolved with NDM (n = 3), then heated with stirring for 30 min at 70°C for batch pasteurization. For Lactobacillus strains, whole cells were inoculated at 7 log cfu/mL, or the same quantity of cells were lysed before adding to the milk and carbohydrate mixtures, or 1.85 U of KL B-gal was used. The sucrose mixture released the highest glucose from all B-gal preparations, with LB11 lysate releasing the highest (245.57 ± 25.16 mM). High-Performance Anion-Exchange Chromatography with Pulsed Amperometric Detection was used to visualize the presence of oligosaccharides with degrees of polymerization of 3 to 7. Oligosaccharides from YB1 lysate treated sucrose mixtures also increased the anaerobic growth of Bifidobacterium breve 2141 at 37°C compared with untreated or KL B-gal treated sucrose mixtures. B-gal treatment of sucrose in nonfat milk with and without corn syrup can be a source of prebiotic oligosaccharides, although more work is needed to determine the composition of the oligosaccharides."

This research sought to evaluate the effects of feeding mixed silage of rye-vetch-mixture and straw (RVS silage) in replacement of whole crop rye silage on feed intake, ECM yield, milk composition, nutrient digestibility, and metabolic variables of dairy cows. The study was a crossover trial with 10 Holstein and 4 Simmental cows (average 593 kg BW and 53 DIM at the start of the trial) tested in 2 experimental runs of 4 weeks each, whereby the last 2 weeks were used for the measurements. The cows were randomly allocated to one of the 2 diets differing only in the major forage source, either rye-vetch-straw silage (RVSS treatment) or a pure rye silage (RS treatment) as control. The diets were fed as partial mixed rations consisting on a DM basis of 43.8% RVS silage or rye silage, 14.6% corn silage, 14.6% meadow hay, and 27.0% concentrate mixture. The cows were additionally supplemented with 5 kg concentrate per day. Data showed that feeding the RVSS diet tended to decrease the DMI without affecting performance (mean ECM yield: 28.4 kg/d) and mean BW during a sampling period. Feeding the RVSS diet tended to increase dairy feed efficiency (kg ECM/kg DMI), likely due to the higher total-tract apparent OM digestibility of the RVSS diet compared with the RS diet. Furthermore, cows fed the RVSS diet spent significantly more time on rumination per kg intake of physically effective NDF. Diet did not affect the concentration of glucose, BHB, urea, total protein, albumin, triglycerides, cholesterol, liver enzymes and macro minerals in blood. Neither of the diets affected the concentration and proportions of short-chain fatty acids in the rumen fluid and feces. In conclusion, the mixed silage of catch crop and straw holds potential to replace traditional rye silage in the feeding of dairy cows yielding up to 30 kg ECM per day. Feeding the RVSS diet enhanced total-tract apparent OM digestibility and rumination index, without any negative effects on ECM yield, milk composition, BW, ruminal and fecal VFA concentration and key blood variables. Future research may evaluate the potential of mixed silages of catch crop and straw in the feeding of high-producing dairy cows as a viable option to overcome shortages in forage production."

      "abstract": "Milk has high risk for microbial contamination. RSQ01, a bacteriocin, previously has shown potentiality for pasteurized milk preservation. This study analyzed the effects of RSQ01 on milk microbiota by comparison of bacterial number and composition in 3 pasteurized milk groups: controls without RSQ01, treatment group with the addition of 2 × MIC (low concentration) and 4 × MIC RSQ01 (high concentration). Integrated 16S rDNA sequencing and metagenomics of these groups after 3 d of storage showed inhibition of RSQ01 on microbiota diversity. Pathogenic bacteria such as Salmonella showed a decrease in relative abundance after RSQ01 treatment, while probiotic bacteria such as Lactococcus showed an increase, indicating that RSQ01 contributed to milk preservation by maintaining a low abundance of pathogens and a relatively high abundance of probiotics. Further investigations revealed that milk preservation was primarily attributed to the ability of RSQ01 to decrease the relative abundance of genes related to metabolism of energy and nutrients (e.g., vitamins, lipids, and amino acids) of microbiota, with change of genetic, environmental, and cellular processes. Interestingly, RSQ01 generally reduced the relative abundance of virulence factors- and quorum-sensing-related genes in microbiota, likely reducing virulence and resistance. The findings provided insights into microbiomics mechanisms regarding pasteurized milk preservation of bacteriocins."

Eighty-four Holstein heifer calves (body weight at 7 d of age, 42.2 ± 2.54 kg; mean ± SD) were assigned to one of the 3 treatments: milk replacer containing 21% fat (LF; 4.7 Mcal of metabolizable energy/kg), 26% fat (MF; 5.0 Mcal of metabolizable energy/kg), and 32% fat (HF; 5.3 Mcal of metabolizable energy/kg) on a DM basis (n = 14 each for summer and winter). Milk replacers were offered at 600 g/d (powder basis; 3.6 L/d) from 8 to 14 d, increased up to 800 g/d (4.8 L/d) from 15 to 21 d, 1200 g/d (7.2 L/d) from 22 to 42 d, decreased down to 800 g/d (4.8 L/d) from 43 to 49 d, and 600 g/d (3.6 L/d) from 50 to 56 d, then weaned at 56 d of age. Data and samples were collected until 91 d of age. All the calves were fed a calf starter and chopped hay ad libitum from 7 d of age. In summer, HF group had lower starter intake than LF and MF groups during 51 to 56 d of age while the HF treatment did not decrease starter intake in winter. These results are consistent with a tendency of interaction between treatment and season for body circumference gain during 43 to 56 d; HF group had lower body circumference gain than LF and MF groups in summer, but not for winter. In addition, we found a trend for an interaction between treatment and season for withers height gain during 8 to 21 d; withers height gain in winter increased linearly as fat content of milk replacer increased but not for summer. These results suggested that increasing fat content of milk replacer increases growth performance of dairy calves in the early age, and does not decrease starter intake during the weaning transition in winter while it decreases starter intake in summer."

      "abstract": "In dairy sheep, optimum nutrition is required to maintain a positive energy and nitrogen balance, and therefore, achieve adequate performance levels. In this sense, supplemental rumen-protected methionine (RPMet) has been a nutritional strategy used to improve the availability of amino acids in sheep for milk production. The aim of the current study is to assess the effect of RPMet supplementation on the milk yield and milk composition of crossbred dairy sheep. Twenty F1 sheep (50% Pelibuey × 50% East Friesian) were randomly assigned to one of the following three treatments: C (control: 0 g/d), 3 g (3.0 g/d), or 6 g (6 g/d) of RPMet added to the basal diet from day 2 to 120 after lambing. Milk yield was significantly higher in sheep supplemented with 6 g of RPMet (p = 0.04) with a linear effect (p < 0.001). In relation to protein yield, the 6 g treatment showed the highest values (55.5 g/day) in comparison with the control (35.2 g/day) and 3 g (42.3 g/day) treatments. Also, lactose (p = 0.02) and non-fat solid yield (p = 0.03) were positively affected by the methionine supplementation. Our results suggest that methionine supplementation is an option to increase milk production, likely associated with the better availability of nutrients of dairy sheep farms using crossbred sheep in regions with an incipient dairy sheep industry."

      "abstract": "In housed systems, administration of oral monopropylene glycol (MPG) in postpartum cows increases the likelihood that cows resolve hyperketonemia (HYK), reduces the incidence of clinical ketosis, and improves milk production, uterine health, and reproductive performance. The objective of our study was to investigate the efficacy of MPG as a treatment for hyperketonemia (blood BHB 1.2 to 2.9 mmol/L) and its effects on milk production, uterine health, and reproductive performance in 3 seasonal-calving, pasture-based dairy herds in New Zealand. Cows were tested a maximum of 15 times for HYK (3 times weekly on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday; mean ± SD; 14.9 ± 0.4 tests) from 1 to 35 DIM using a handheld meter. In total, 749 (76.4%) of 980 cows sampled were diagnosed with HYK (blood BHB ≥1.2 to 2.9 mmol/L) or severe HYK (blood BHB ≥3.0 mmol/L) at least once during the first 35 DIM. Cows that never tested above 1.2 mmol/L were classified as non-HYK (n = 231) and were excluded from the study. Cows with HYK that were randomly allocated to the control group (n = 362) were left untreated, whereas those allocated to the MPG treatment group (n = 387) were orally drenched with 300 mL of MPG (equivalent dose 310 g) every time the BHB test was ≥1.2 to 2.9 mmol/L during the first 35 DIM (mean ± SD treatment bouts per cow: 2.0 ± 1.2 bouts). The MPG treatment was repeated once daily until blood BHB was <1.2 mmol/L at subsequent tests. Data from the survival analysis indicated that MPG reduced the time to resolve HYK (blood BHB <1.2 mmol/L) and delayed time to onset of severe HYK. The MPG-treated cows were 52% more likely (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.52, 95% CI: 1.30-1.76) to resolve HYK and 69% less likely (HR = 0.31, 95% CI: 0.17-0.58) to develop severe HYK compared with control cows. However, repeated measures analysis indicated that MPG-treated cows had marginally lower ECM yield in the first 15 wk in milk (24.7 ± 0.24 kg/d) compared with control cows (25.1 ± 0.24 kg/d). Logistic regression was used to determine the effect of MPG on uterine health and reproductive performance. The prevalence of purulent vaginal discharge endometritis (score ≥3) was lower in MPG (n = 9/350) compared with control cows (n = 19/301). There were no overall effects of treatment on risk of submission to artificial insemination (AI) within 21 d of breeding start, confirmed pregnancy to first AI, pregnant within 42 d of breeding start, or the entire seasonally defined breeding period. Treating HYK with MPG improved the likelihood of a cow resolving HYK and reduced the incidence of severe HYK; however, there were minimal benefits for improving uterine health and reproductive performance and a biologically small difference in milk production in cows diagnosed with HYK based on a threshold of 1.2 mmol/L and treated with MPG."

      "abstract": "The study investigated how different milk feeding levels and the composition of the starter feed interact to influence growth performance, rumen fermentation, certain blood parameters, and the excretion of purine derivatives in the urine of dairy calves. A total of 72 female Holstein dairy calves (mean BW = 40.6 ± 1.9 kg) were assigned to a completely randomized design with a 2 × 3 factorial arrangement. The starter diets differed in CP (20% vs. 24%, DM basis) and total crude fat (CF, ether extract; 3.0% vs. 5.5%, DM basis). The 6 treatment groups were as follows: moderate milk with 20% CP and 3% CF (MM-CON), moderate milk with 24% CP and 3% CF (MM-HCP), moderate milk with 20% CP and 5.5% CF (MM-HCF), high milk with 20% CP and 3% CF (HM-CON), high milk with 24% CP and 3% CF (HM-HCP), and high milk with 20% CP and 5.5% CF (HM-HCF). Calves had free access to a starter feed and water and were weaned on d 53 but remained in the study until d 73. Calves fed the HM-HCF diet had the lowest starter feed intake both pre- and postweaning, and calves fed the HM-HCP and HM-CON diets had the greatest preweaning ADG. Feed efficiency and protein intake were also lowest in HM-HCF calves before weaning, whereas fat intake was consistently greater in calves fed HCF diets. Calves fed the HM-HCP diet had the largest body size, heart girth, and withers height at weaning and at the end of the study, whereas the HM-HCF calves had the smallest. Rumen fermentation profiles showed that total VFA concentrations were lowest in HM-HCF calves, along with an increased acetate-to-propionate ratio. In contrast, HM-HCP calves had a greater molar proportion of propionate preweaning and butyrate postweaning, along with a greater proportion of branched-chain VFA in high-CP diets, indicating more efficient microbial activity in the rumen. Urinary analyses were consistent with these results, as HM-HCF calves had the greatest creatinine levels and lowest urine volumes, whereas HM-HCP calves showed the greatest excretion of the microbial protein synthesis markers allantoin and uric acid. Blood metabolite analysis showed that glucose levels were greater in HM-fed calves preweaning, whereas BHB levels were lowest in HM-HCF calves. Overall, diets with high milk allowance, high CP (24% of DM), and moderate fat (3% of DM) may promote growth, rumen function, and metabolic efficiency, whereas high-fat starter diets (5.5% of DM) may limit feed intake and growth of dairy calves."

      "abstract": "This study aimed to characterize plasma bile acid changes from birth to first calving and evaluate the effects of early transition milk (TM) feeding versus milk replacer (MR) during key stages. Fecal bile acids in TM-fed calves were also analyzed, offering insights into bile acid metabolism. Thirty female Holstein calves were fed TM or MR for the first 5 d, followed by 12 L/d MR. From d 14, calves were fed MR and starter with gradual weaning between wk 8 and 14. Blood samples were collected at 7 time points: 30 min and 12 h after birth, preweaning (wk 2, 6), weaning (wk 14), 8 mo, 13 mo, 3 wk before calving, at calving, and 3 wk after calving. Fecal samples were collected from a subset of TM-fed calves (n = 10) at birth, wk 6, wk 14, 8 mo, and calving. Samples were analyzed for bile acids using the Biocrates MxP Quant 500 kit. Cholic acid (CA) in plasma showed significant time-treatment interactions, with higher levels in TM-fed calves at weaning. Taurine- and glycine-conjugated bile acids had no treatment or time-treatment interactions, but all plasma bile acids showed significant time effects. Principal component analysis revealed that bile acid profiles at birth and after colostrum intake were tightly clustered. Plasma bile acid profiles showed greater dispersion during milk feeding and weaning, with tighter clustering observed postweaning, particularly at 13 mo, and in the transition period. Significant effects were observed for CA, deoxycholic acid (DCA) and chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA), with CA showing a notable interaction and being higher in TM-fed calves at weaning than in MR-fed calves. Bile acid levels increased toward weaning, peaked at wk 14, and decreased after weaning. Glycine-conjugated bile acids changed over time, with glycocholic acid (GCA) and glycodeoxycholic acid (GDCA) peaking at weaning, and glycochenodeoxycholic acid (GCDCA) being elevated before weaning, decreasing thereafter, and increasing again at calving. Taurine-conjugated bile acids also showed temporal changes, peaking at wk 6. The shifts in bile acid composition from birth to postcalving, with taurolithocholic acid (TLCA), GDCA, and taurocholic acid (TCA) initially dominating, CA increasing at weaning, and GDCA and DCA dominating at calving, with CA increasing again postcalving. During the transition to calving, CA decreased whereas glycine-conjugated bile acids increased relative to taurine-conjugated bile acids in plasma, irrespective of treatment. Fecal bile acid profiles in TM-fed calves clustered distinctly at birth, evolving through pre- to postweaning and calving, with increasing profile overlap over time. Most fecal bile acids, except DCA and CA, were abundant at birth but declined over time. Both DCA and CA increased postweaning, mirroring plasma trends. From wk 6 to calving, DCA was the dominant bile acid, accounting for the highest percentage of total bile acids excreted in feces. Spearman's correlation analysis was performed to assess the relationship between plasma and fecal bile acids in TN-fed calves. A significant positive correlation was observed only for GCDCA (Spearman's rank correlation coefficient [rho] = 0.35), whereas all other bile acids were not correlated. These results illustrate the complex dynamics of bile acid profiles during calf development."

Breast milk is rich in mesenchymal stem cells, extracellular vesicles, and neurotrophins, all of which have been shown to have therapeutic effects. Intranasal drug administration has been demonstrated to be a reliable method for delivering various therapeutic agents directly to the brain via the olfactory nerve pathway. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the neuroprotective role of intranasal breast milk in very low birth weight (VLBW) infants with GM-IVH by assessing ventricular dilation and GM-IVH size on ultrasound, as well as neurodevelopmental outcomes using the Bayley-III scale. This study included 22 VLBW infants diagnosed with GM-IVH in the first postnatal week. A total of 11 infants received intranasal breast milk (inFBM) for at least 28 days or until discharge, while 11 infants in the control group received standard treatment. Patients were clinically monitored via cranial transfontanelle ultrasonography. A total of 14 patients from both groups were evaluated using the Bayley-III Infant Developmental Screening Scale. The incidence of posthemorrhagic ventricular dilation (PHVD) was significantly lower in the study group than in the control group (p = 0.010). In addition, the incidence of grade regression in the transfontanelle ultrasonography findings at discharge was significantly greater in the study group than in the control group (p = 0.008). Moreover, the incidence of retinopathy of prematurity was lower in the study group than in the control group. Compared with non-administration, the intranasal administration of fresh breast milk to VLBW premature infants with GM-IVH results in regression of GM-IVH and significantly reduces progression to posthemorrhagic ventricular dilation. It may also reduce the incidence of retinopathy of prematurity."

The paediatrics department of the Affiliated Hospital of Nantong University sees an average of approximately 300 outpatient children per day, and an average of about 180 preterm infants are hospitalised annually due to colic. PURPOSE: To assess the relevance of positional management and milk type management to colic in preterm infants. METHODS: 313 cases of preterm infants who underwent colic treatment in the paediatric department of Affiliated Hospital of Nantong University from February 2021 to December 2022 were taken as the study subjects. 125 cases participated in positional management, while 188 cases participated in milk type management, and the samples were not duplicated between the two groups. The positional management was divided into lateral group, kangaroo care group, supine group, flexed group and prone group, and the milk type management was divided into human milk group, formula group and mixed group. A p value of <0.05 difference was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: There was a statistically significant difference in the degree of colic and type of stool in position management (p<0.05), with the best performance in the kangaroo care group. There was a statistically significant difference in the degree of colic and type of stools in milk type management (p<0.05), with the human milk group performing the best. CONCLUSION: For preterm infants with colic, kangaroo care may offer potential advantages, and human milk is also recommended whenever possible.",

To compare the impact of different formulas on the occurrence of other atopic manifestations (AMs), autoimmune disorders (ADs) and the time of immune tolerance acquisition in a population of children with immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated cow CMPA. METHODS: In a 72-month prospective cohort study the occurrence of other AMs (i.e., eczema, urticaria, asthma, and rhinoconjunctivitis), ADs (i.e., celiac disease, thyroiditis, type 1 diabetes, inflammatory bowel diseases, idiopathic juvenile arthritis) and the time of immune tolerance acquisition were comparatively evaluated in IgE-mediated CMPA children treated with different formulas: extensively hydrolyzed casein formula containing the probiotic L. rhamnosus G (EHCF + LGG), rice hydrolyzed formula (RHF), soy formula (SF), extensively hydrolyzed whey formula (EHWF), or amino-acid based formula (AAF). RESULTS: 313 subjects were evaluated: EHCF + LGG (n = 64), RHF(n = 62), SF(n = 63), EHWF(n = 60) and AAF (n = 64). The incidence of AMs was: 0.30(Bonferroni-corrected 95%CI 0.15 to 0.44) for EHCF + LGG cohort, 0.68 (0.52-0.83) for RHF cohort, 0.73 (0.59-0.87) for SF cohort, 0.70 (0.55-0.85) for EHWF cohort and 0.83 (0.71-0.95) for AAF cohort. The corresponding risk ratios are 2.28 (1.51-3.45) for RHF vs. EHCF + LGG (p < 0.001), 2.46 (1.64-3.69) for SF vs. EHCF + LGG (p < 0.001), 2.36 (1.56-3.56) for EHWF vs. EHCF + LGG (p < 0.001), and 2.79 (1.88-4.13) for AAF vs. EHCF + LGG (p < 0.001). The 72-month immune tolerance acquisition rate was higher in the EHCF + LGG cohort. The incidence of celiac disease was 2/313 (0.006, binomial exact 95%CI 0.0007 to 0.023). No cases of other ADs were reported. CONCLUSION: The dietary treatment with EHCF + LGG is associated with lower incidence of AMs and higher rate of immune tolerance acquisition in children with CMPA.",

      "abstract": "For the first time, the analysis of milk solutions without previous acid decomposition is presented using microwave-induced plasma optical emission spectrometry (MIP OES) with aerosol dilution (AD) as a sample introduction strategy. The milk samples were previously diluted using formic acid (concentration 2 % v v-1) and directly introduced in the MIP OES instrument equipped with an AD system of laminar flux. The system introduced a controlled nitrogen gas stream (dilution gas, DG) between the spray chamber and the plasma torch. The milk and formic acid proportions, the samples' dilution, and the DG and the nebulizer gas (NG) flow rates were evaluated, considering plasma robustness (N2+/OH ratio) and the intensity of the emission lines. A 50-fold dilution of milk and flow rates of 0.6 L min-1 for DG and 0.4 L min-1 for NG were chosen as a compromise condition. This simple strategy allowed the determination of Ca, K, Na, Mg, and P by MIP OES, with recoveries of 96-109 % obtained in addition and recovery assays and RSD lower than 6 %. The developed methodology used minimal reactants, and the aerosol dilution was performed online with the plasma gas, generating less waste. Besides, the sample treatment was fast, and the multi-elemental determination was performed using the cost-effective multi-elemental spectrometric technique of MIP OES."

      "abstract": "BackgroundThe application of recombinant adeno associated virus (rAAV) in gene therapy is accepted as an effective strategy for the treatment of monogenic diseases. However, eligibility for such therapies is contingent upon the absence or minimal presence of antibodies against adeno-associated virus (AAV) capsid protein. While the passive transfer of maternal immunoglobulins in utero is well established, the potential impact of maternal antibodies transferred via breastfeeding remains less explored.ObjectiveThis study aims to quantify and compare the levels of anti-AAV9 and anti-AAVrh74 immunoglobulin G (IgG) and M (IgM) in both plasma and human milk from a group of healthy lactating mothers.MethodsIn this cross-sectional study, we analyzed plasma and human milk samples from healthy lactating mothers. We used an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to determine the levels of circulating IgG and IgM antibodies against AAV9 and AAVrh74 capsids and compared their concentrations in the paired samples.ResultsThirty-one paired plasma and human milk samples were analyzed. The median age at participation was 34 years (range: 25-43), median duration of breastfeeding at the time of sample collection was 7.5 months (range:0.7-33), and median body mass index was 23 Kg/m2 (range: 19.7-35.4). Median anti-AAV9 IgG in plasma and human milk, were 183 U/mL (range: 29-7214) and 1 U/mL (range: 1-33), respectively. Median anti-AAVrh74 IgG, in plasma and human milk were 138 U/mL (range: 23-8725) and 1 U/mL (range: 1-27), respectively. The differences in anti-AAV9 and anti-AAVrh74 IgG levels between plasma and human milk were statistically significant (p < 0.0001). Additionally, a strong correlation (r: 0.97, p: < 0.0001) was observed between anti-AAV9 and anti-AAVrh74 IgG levels in plasma.ConclusionsThe levels of anti-AAV9 and anti-AAVrh74 antibodies in human milk are remarkably lower than those in plasma. Consequently, breastfeeding should not be restricted for term infants who are potential candidates for AAV-related gene therapy products."

The results revealed that both homogenization alone (1.94 ± 0.08 μm) and homogenization followed by high-temperature short-time treatment (HHTST) (1.93 ± 0.10 μm) significantly reduced the particle size of raw MFGs. Following homogenization plus ultra-pasteurization (HUP) and homogenization plus ultra-high temperature sterilization (HUHT), more denatured milk proteins were adsorbed to the interface of MFGs, and there was an extensive polymerization and aggregation of MFGs. Furthermore, the proportion of glycoproteins, sphingomyelin and phosphatidylethanolamine at the interface of MFGs increased following HUP and HUHT treatments. Homogenization and HHTST enhanced lipolysis, whereas HUP and HUHT treatment reduced lipolysis due to alterations in the interfacial structure and aggregation of MFGs. The outcomes of this study provide valuable insights for optimizing processing conditions to improve the digestibility and bioavailability of camel milk."

      "abstract": "Staphylococcus aureus is a major concern in the dairy industry due to its significance as a pathogen causing bovine mastitis as well as a source of food poisoning. The nutrient-rich milk environment supports bacterial growth, but the specific genetic determinants that facilitate S. aureus proliferation and persistence in milk are poorly understood. In this study, we conducted a genome-wide CRISPR interference sequencing (CRISPRi-seq) screen with the laboratory strain S. aureus NCTC8325-4, to identify fitness determinants essential for S. aureus growth and survival in milk. We identified 282 milk-essential genes, including those with key roles in DNA replication, protein synthesis, and metabolism. Comparative analysis with brain heart infusion (BHI) as growth medium, revealed 79 genes with differential fitness, highlighting specific adaptations required for growth in milk. Notably, we found that purine biosynthesis, folate cycle pathways, and metal acquisition were particularly important in this environment. Based on this, we further demonstrate that S. aureus is more sensitive to the folate inhibitors trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) in milk and identify several genes whose knockdown results in hypersensitivity to TMP-SMX in milk. Additionally, our analysis showed a relatively reduced importance of cell wall components, such as teichoic acids, for S. aureus fitness in milk, which is also reflected in reduced efficiency of antimicrobials targeting teichoic acids. Together, these findings provide new insights into the genetic basis of S. aureus fitness and antibiotic susceptibility in milk, offering directions for novel treatment strategies against bovine mastitis.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND & AIMS: Lactose-hydrolyzed milk is widely used to address lactose intolerance. However, its monosaccharide content may rapidly increase postprandial blood glucose levels and heighten glycemic variability. We aimed to explore the effects of mulberry leaf and corn silk extracts (medicinal and edible homologous materials) and their supplementation in lactose-hydrolyzed milk on postprandial glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes. METHODS: Eligible participants in this crossover trial were randomized to four interventions, separated by a 7 d washout. Intervention foods were whole-grain bread (50 g carbohydrates) together with water, mulberry leaf and corn silk extracts (MCE), lactose-hydrolyzed milk (LHM), or lactose-hydrolyzed milk supplemented with mulberry leaf and corn silk extracts (LHM-MCE). Continuous glucose monitoring systems were used to collect fasting and postprandial interstitial glucose over 2 h after interventions and to calculate the incremental area under the curve (iAUC). Paired Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to compare the difference in iAUC, 1-h postprandial glycemic (1h PG), 2h PG, maximum glycemic, and maximum glucose excursion from baseline across interventions. RESULTS: Twenty-eight adults with type 2 diabetes (55 ± 10 years old, fasting blood glucose: 6.93 ± 1.22 mmol/L) completed the trial. MCE was associated with lower levels of maximum glycemic (median of difference [interquartile range]: (-0.9 [-1.9, 0.4], P = 0.025) and maximum glucose excursion from baseline (-0.9 [-1.5, -0.03], P = 0.005) compared to water. LHM-MCE was associated with lower levels of 1h PG (-0.7 [-1.9, 0.4], P = 0.04), maximum glycemic (-0.9 [-2.2, 0.4], P = 0.014), and maximum glucose excursion from baseline (-1.0 [-2.3, -0.4], P = 0.003) compared to LHM. CONCLUSIONS: Mulberry leaf and corn silk extracts may benefit postprandial glycemic control and their incorporation into lactose-hydrolyzed milk could be a promising dietary intervention for patients with type 2 diabetes.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Lactational performance depends heavily on age, health, and nutrition. L-Citrulline (Cit) is an effective precursor of L-arginine (Arg), an amino acid that has important roles in synthesis of nitric oxide (NO) and polyamines. Ruminal microbes degrade extracellular Arg; however, extracellular L-citrulline (Cit) is not degraded by ruminal microbes due to lack of uptake and can be fed unencapsulated as a precursor for Arg. As NO is a vasodilator, an increase in blood flow and transport of molecules to mammary tissue may enhance lactational performance and milk composition. Increases in polyamine production may increase milk protein synthesis within mammary tissue, thus increasing milk protein content. This study determined, for the first time, effects of dietary Cit supplementation on milk production and milk composition of Alpine dairy goats. METHODS: Does were synchronized to estrus and bred to Alpine bucks. Parturition was induced on d 149 of gestation and does were suckled overnight allowing kid(s) to obtain colostrum before being milked 24 h later (d 1 of lactation). Does were assigned to either control (CON, n = 24) or Cit (CIT, n = 23) diets. The isonitrogenous control diet consisted of 97.63% basal diet and 2.37% supplement (1.37% L-alanine and 1.00% soybean hydrogenated oil). The CIT supplemented diet consisted of 97.63% basal diet and 2.37% supplement (0.5% Cit, 0.5% L-glutamine, 1% soybean hydrogenated oil, 0.37% cornstarch). Diets were group fed ad-libitum by treatment group. Blood samples were collected on d 0 and 30 of lactation, milk volumes measured twice daily, and on d 10, 20, and 40 of lactation, milk samples were collected. RESULTS: CIT-treated does had greater daily milk production (P < 0.05) and there was an effect of day of lactation on daily milk production (P < 0.0001). Sire had significant effect on daily milk production as well (P < 0.05). Milk compositional analyses revealed Cit supplementation increased solid-non-fat (SNF; P < 0.05) and protein (P < 0.05) content in milk. CONCLUSIONS: Our novel results indicate that dietary supplementation of Cit fed ad-libitum in Alpine does increased daily milk yield, milk SNF content, and protein content. Supplemental Cit may be a proxy for Arg in goats to enhance lactational performance."

Lacticaseibacillus paracasei Shirota (LcS) is a probiotic strain that positively affects the human gut. However, the evidence of its effects on the Indonesian population remains limited. AIM: To investigate the effect of LcS-fermented milk on the gut microbiota and environment of Indonesian elderly houses. METHODS: This double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial involved 112 participants from Indonesian elderly houses, spanning a 2-week baseline and 24-week treatment. Participants were randomly assigned to probiotic or placebo groups, consuming fermented milk with or without LcS (> 6.5 × 109 colony-forming units). Fecal samples were collected every three months. Gut microbiota analysis was performed using 16S rRNA gene sequencing and reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction, while gut environment was assessed by measuring fecal organic acids, amino acid metabolites, and stool frequency. RESULTS: Analyses of 16S rRNA gene sequence data at the 3-month period revealed increased Bifidobacterium and Succinivibrio and decreased Rikenellaceae RC9 gut group in the probiotic group. These shifts were associated with significant differences in β-diversity metrics. The change in Bifidobacterium was confirmed by reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction, demonstrating higher abundance in the probiotic group than in the placebo group (8.5 ± 1.1 vs 8.0 ± 1.1, log10 bacterial cells/g; P = 0.044). At 6-month period, the differences in Succinivibrio and Rikenellaceae RC9 gut group persisted. The probiotic group showed higher butyrate levels than the placebo group at the 6-month period (5.04 ± 3.11 vs 3.95 ± 2.89, μmol/g; P = 0.048). The effect on amino acid metabolites and stool frequency was not significant. CONCLUSION: Daily intake of LcS positively affects the gut microbiota and environment of people living in Indonesian elderly houses.",

Milky white fluid containing urate crystals, referred to as urate milk, may incidentally accumulate in the joint cavity and tophus of patients with gout. We report a rare case of gouty flexor tenosynovitis in the finger, characterized by urate milk, which closely resembled pyogenic tenosynovitis. A 54-year-old man with a history of gout attacks presented unprovoked right ring finger pain with marked erythema, swelling, and limited range of motion of the palmar side of the proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joint. He experienced gout attacks without tophus in both feet once a year since the age of 30 years. At the time of the initial onset, the patient took uric acid-lowering drug just for one month for hyperuricemia, but then stopped outpatient treatment and had been using non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) only during attacks. No abnormalities were observed on radiographs, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed T1-low and T2-very high-intensity regions from precisely above the flexor tendon to subcutaneously at the PIP joint level. Blood examination revealed C-reactive protein level of 2.5 mg/L, white blood cell count of 8.1 × 109 /L, and uric acid level of 666 µmol/L (normal range ≦ 360 µmol/L). The operation was performed for the patient suspected of suppurative flexor tenosynovitis. A milky white fluid overflowed subcutaneously, and multiple gouty tophi were observed on the tendon sheath. The diagnosis of gouty flexor tenosynovitis was made based on the absence of bacteria on culture and uric acid crystals on optical microscopy. Histopathological examination revealed an accumulation of multinucleated giant cells around the amorphous deposits characteristic of gouty tophi. Gouty tenosynovitis with urate milk should be considered in cases presenting a history of gout attacks, hyperuricemia, and high T2 signal intensity on MRI, such as subcutaneous pus accumulation in the clinical picture of infection.",

The aim of this study was to examine the effect of including re-ensiled PCS from GCS in dairy cows' diet on feed intake, milk production and composition, feed conversion, apparent total tract digestibility (ATTD) as well as feed sorting and rumination behaviour compared to a control ration. Three total mixed rations (TMR) were tested in this experiment differing in PCS and GCS proportion in forage: 0% PCS and 50% GCS (CON), 25% PCS and 25% GCS (PCS25) and 50% PCS and 0% GCS (PCS50). The study was designed as a cross-over trial with six Holstein Friesian and nine Simmental cows (average 624 ± 68 kg body weight and 60 ± 20 days in milk at the start of the trial). The experiment consisted of three experimental runs, each lasting for 35 days with a 14 days adaptation phase and a 21 days measurement period. Diets were fed as TMR containing 37% grass silage, 26% concentrates and differing proportions of PCS or GCS depending on experimental group (37% GCS in CON, 18.5% PCS and 18.5% GCS in PCS25, 37% PCS in PCS50). Dry matter intake of dairy cows was higher in the PCS25 compared to the PCS50 group with both groups being not different from the CON treatment. Energy-corrected milk (ECM) production was lowest in the PCS50 group but did not differ significantly between treatments. Milk composition was also similar in all three treatments, except for milk urea content, which was lower in the PCS50 group. Moreover, ATTD of crude protein and ruminal nitrogen balance as well as phosphorus intake and the phosphorus effort for production of 1 kg ECM decreased with rising PCS inclusion in the diet. In contrast, no differences between treatments were found for dry matter, crude protein and energy effort for ECM production as well as for feed sorting and rumination behaviour. In conclusion, replacing GCS by re-ensiled PCS in TMR-diets did not affect ECM production and feed conversion of dairy cows while increasing the utilisation of crude protein and phosphorus. Therefore, re-ensiled PCS can substitute GCS in dairy cows' TMR-diets. However, the long-term effects of decreased phosphorus intake and ATTD of crude protein in cows fed PCS-rich diets should be examined in future studies.",

The basis for this increase remains elusive. In low-income settings, breastfeeding is recommended because health benefits outweigh the risk of transmission, especially when maternal antiretroviral therapy is provided. We profiled the milk metabolome of 326 women sampled longitudinally for 18 months postpartum using global metabolomics. We identify perturbations in several metabolites, including tryptophan, dimethylarginine, and a recently discovered antiviral ribonucleotide, that are robustly associated with maternal HIV infection. Quantitative tryptophan and kynurenine levels in both milk and plasma reveal that these perturbations reflect systemic depletion of tryptophan and alterations in tryptophan catabolism in WWH. Our findings provide intriguing evidence that decreases in tryptophan availability and perturbations in tryptophan catabolism in children born to WWH may contribute to their increased morbidity and mortality."

      "abstract": "This study's objective was to determine the effects of pre-pregnancy obesity induced by a high-fat diet and exposure to circadian-disrupting light-dark phase shifts on birth littler size, pup survival to 24h and growth to lactation day 12, and their relationship to maternal feeding patterns, fecal corticosterone levels, milk composition, and lipid profiles of liver, plasma, mammary gland, and milk. A 2 by 2 factorial designed experiment of female ICR mice assigned to control (CON; 10% fat) or high-fat (HF; 60% fat) and either a 12-hour light-dark (LD) cycle or a chronic jet lag model of 6-hour phase-shifts (PS) in light-dark cycle every 3 days throughout pregnancy and lactation, resulted in 4 treatment groups: CON-LD, CON-PS, HF-LD and HF-PS. HF diet increased maternal pre-pregnancy body weight and elevated milk lactose. Whereas PS reduced milk lactose within the CON diet group, and increased maternal feed intake and fecal corticosterone levels. PS exposure also affected the time of day of birth. Neither PS nor HF affected birth litter size or pup survival. Only diet impacted final litter weight, with HF greater than CON. Among the 1204 lipids detected by multiple reaction monitoring (MRM)-profiling, diet altered 67.1% in milk, 58.1% in mammary gland, 27.2% in the liver, and 10.9% in plasma, with HF increasing the carbon length of diacylglycerols in the liver and milk, and carbon length of triacylglycerols in plasma, mammary gland and milk. Although exposure to PS had no overall impact on maternal lipid profiles, interactions (P < 0.05) were found between PS and diets in the phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolanine class of lipids. Findings support that high fat diet and exposure to circadian disrupting environments impact maternal feeding behavior and stress responses as well as lipid profiles, which may relate to their negative association with maternal health and offspring development.",

      "abstract": "This study aims to explore the impact of adding sodium acetate and sodium butyrate on the composition, blood biochemical parameters, and volatile flavor compounds of lactating mares' milk. By assessing the influence of these additives on milk flavor enhancement, the findings provide scientific evidence for optimizing flavor characteristics and offer new strategies for improving the sensory attributes of mare milk products. Eighteen lactating Yili mares were randomly assigned to three groups: a control group, a sodium acetate group (85 mg/kg·BM-1), and a sodium butyrate group (85 mg/kg·BM-1). The experiment lasted 90 days, with milk yield recorded on days 0, 30, 60, and 90. Milk samples were collected on day 60 (peak lactation) for compositional analysis, and GC-IMS was employed to identify and quantify volatile compounds. Additionally, blood samples were drawn from the jugular vein before morning feeding on day 60 using heparinized tubes to assess key biochemical markers, including glucose, triglycerides, total cholesterol, and urea. The results revealed the following findings: (1) Milk yield and composition: The addition of sodium acetate and sodium butyrate had no significant effect on milk yield. However, both treatment groups exhibited significantly or extremely significantly higher milk fat content compared to the control group, whereas milk protein and lactose levels remained largely unchanged. (2) Blood biochemical indicators: The sodium butyrate group showed an extremely significant increase in urea levels compared to the sodium acetate and control groups. Glucose levels in the sodium acetate group were also significantly higher than in the control group. Moreover, triglyceride levels were markedly elevated in the sodium butyrate group compared to the sodium acetate group, while total bilirubin concentrations were significantly higher in the sodium acetate group than in the control group. (3) Volatile compounds: The addition of these additives led to a significant increase in the diversity and concentration of volatile compounds in mare milk. Notably, esters, aldehydes, and ketones showed substantial enrichment in both treatment groups. The relative abundance of esters such as butyl acetate, L-lactic acid ethyl ester, 1-pentene-3-ol, pentanol, and 3-pentanone increased, alongside a significant rise in aldehydes and ketones, including 2-heptenal and 3-pentanone. In conclusion, sodium acetate and sodium butyrate enhance milk flavor by modulating milk composition and metabolic parameters, providing a scientific foundation for improving the quality of mare milk products."

      "abstract": "In livestock ruminants such as sheep, different infectious diseases such as mastitis or contagious agalactia are originated from pathogens as Staphylococcus aureus and Mycoplasma agalactiae. Fluoroquinolones are authorized in dairy animals, including their extralabel use, as an alternative when other treatment failed in the European Union (EU), however, in the United States, are prohibited from extralabel drug use in food-producing animals. Marbofloxacin, a well-known fluoroquinolone is commonly used in dairy cattle in the EU at 10 mg/kg. However, their off-label use in sheep also has been described. Nevertheless, the dose extrapolations from dairy cows should include pharmacokinetic (PK) studies because of interspecies differences and the potential risks of antimicrobial resistance or toxicity. In this regard, the aims of this research were to (1) describe the i.v. and i.m. PK analysis of marbofloxacin in plasma and milk of lactating sheep at 10 mg/kg, (2) determine the MIC and calculate the tentative epidemiological cutoff values (TECOFF) for Mycoplasma agalactiae and Staphylococcus aureus wild-type isolates from sheep, and (3) conduct a pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) analysis with the Monte Carlo simulation to obtain the probability of target attainment for different MIC values, known as the PK/PD cutoff values. The results of this study could help to establish the efficacy of a 10 mg/kg dosage regimen of marbofloxacin in lactating sheep. Plasma and milk concentrations were described with a nonlinear mixed effects model. The intramuscular bioavailability was 88%, and the volume of distribution was 1.31 L/kg with a clearance value of 0.38 L/h/kg. Half-lives after i.v. and i.m. dosing were 6.53 and 7.09 h in plasma, and 6.62 and 6.65 h in milk, respectively. High concentrations were determined in milk with area under the curve (AUC) milk/plasma ratios close to 1.28. The MIC values for Staphylococcus aureus and Mycoplasma agalactiae were obtained, and TECOFF values of 1.0 and 2.0 µg/mL, respectively, were determined. The Monte Carlo simulations predicted that the dosage regimen of 10 mg/kg per 24 h in lactating sheep can be adequate for intermediate and high MIC values of 0.5 and 1.0 μg/mL, respectively, and could be useful for populations with a target AUC/MIC ratio ≤48 for Staphylococcus aureus, but not for Mycoplasma agalactiae. Results derived for this study could be taken as previous tentative points for further studies of marbofloxacin in lactating and nonlactating sheep in a clinical context."

      "abstract": "Suboptimal preweaning nutrition of dairy calves has been causally associated with impaired adult metabolic health and lactation performance. However, the biological mechanisms linking early life nutrient supply and future performance remain insufficiently understood. Thus, the objective of this study was to characterize growth, reproductive performance, glucose metabolism, and the metabolic profile of growing heifers fed a restricted (RES) or an elevated (ELE) milk supply preweaning. Heifer calves (n = 86) born from a single herd of ∼120 dairy cows were blocked in pairs by the dam's parity and birth date. Within block, calves were fed an identical colostrum supply and randomly assigned to a milk replacer (MR) allowance level treatment of either 5.41 Mcal of ME in 8 L of MR/d (ELE) or 2.71 Mcal of ME in 4 L of MR/d (RES). The MR (150 g/L), containing 24% crude protein, 18% crude fat, and 45% lactose, was fed from d 2 after birth until calves were stepped down by 50% at d 49 and fully weaned at d 56. All calves were kept in individual hutches until wk 10 and had ad libitum access to fresh pelleted calf starter, chopped wheat straw, and water. Starting from wk 8, heifers from both treatments were fed and managed in the same way, and preweaning treatments were blind to caretakers. Blood samples for metabolomics analysis were collected at 330 d of age, and an insulin-modified intravenous glucose tolerance test was conducted at 370 ± 12 d of age. Heifers fed the ELE diet exhibited higher average daily gain in the preweaning period, leading to higher body weight at 70 d of age (+ 9 kg). At 330 d of age, growth advantages were no longer significant, and preweaning nutrition had no effect on age at first service, first service conception rates, age at conception, or number of services per conception. The metabolomic serum data sampled at 330 d of age revealed that carnitine, glycerolipid, and purine metabolism were predicted to be significantly affected by preweaning nutrient supply, reflecting long-term metabolic programming. At 370 d of age, during the first 20 min following the glucose infusion, blood insulin levels were greater (10.3 ng/mL vs. 7.7 ng/mL), the area under the curve for insulin tended to be greater, and insulin sensitivity was lower in RES heifers. Increasing the amount of MR fed to calves preweaning had a sustained impact on metabolic processes, but long-term differences could not be detected in growth or reproductive performance, potentially due to the low number of animals."

CsCEase1, with a molecular weight of 45.0 kDa, exhibited a specific activity of 254.75 U/mg and showed optimal activity at 40 °C and pH 7.5. Using CsCEase1, 44.30 % of lactose was converted into epilactose, yielding a production level of 26.58 g/L. An efficient purification method was developed, incorporating crystallization and β-galactosidase treatment to remove the unconverted lactose, while Saccharomyces cerevisiae was used to consume the produced glucose. Final purification with activated carbon resulted in epilactose with 98 % purity and a recovery rate of 66.47 %. Furthermore, CsCEase1 was incubated with whey power and expired milk, achieving epilactose conversion rates of 29.65 % and 32.69 %, respectively.

      "abstract": "Glioblastoma (GBM) is a highly aggressive brain tumor with resistance to conventional therapies. Mithramycin (Mit-A), a potent antitumor agent, has shown promise in several tumor types including, GBM. However, its clinical application is limited by toxicity. To address this, we explored the use of milk-derived extracellular vesicles (mEVs) as a delivery system to enhance the therapeutic efficacy of Mit-A. In this study, mEVs were isolated using a 3000 PEG precipitation method and confirmed their size, morphology, and stability through dynamic light scattering (DLS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and atomic force microscopy (AFM). The isolated vesicles with a size of 125.6 ± 2.78 nm, a polydispersity index (PDI) of 0.083 ± 0.02, and a ζ-potential of 15 ± 0.57 mV. The presence of typical EV markers such as TSG101, HSP70, and CD63 confirmed their purity. Encapsulation of Mit-A within mEVs led to a slight increase in size to 131.8 ± 6.9 nm, a PDI of 0.081 ± 0.006, and a decrease in ζ-potential to -17 ± 2.0 mV, with an encapsulation efficiency of 58% by the freeze-thaw method. The in vitro transepithelial transport assay revealed that mEV(Mit-A) transported Mit-A more effectively than free Mit-A. The mEV(Mit-A) formulation demonstrated excellent stability in simulated salivary and gastrointestinal fluids, with a sustained release of Mit-A observed over 24 h in vitro in PBS (pH 6.8). Furthermore, mEV(Mit-A) formulations significantly inhibited glioma cell growth, and migration, and induced apoptosis, showing a 2-fold lower IC50 than free Mit-A, indicating superior efficacy. These findings suggest that mEVs represent a promising delivery vehicle for Mit-A, enhancing its potential as an effective treatment for glioblastoma."

In this study, milk-derived Lactobacillus spp. from Ningxia, China were screened in vitro and the anti-mastitis effect of a candidate strain was evaluated through a Staphylococcus aureus-induced rat mastitis model. The results showed that Lactobacillus plantarum X86 exhibited a high adhesion rate of MAC-T cells, presented the best probiotic properties, and demonstrated anti-S. aureus effects in vitro through comprehensive assessment. Furthermore, L. plantarum X86 alleviated pathological damage to the mammary gland, liver, and colon, inhibited the mRNA expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines factors IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α in mammary gland tissue; and increased the content of intestine SCFAs in a rat mastitis model induced by S. aureus. In conclusion, our results suggested that L. plantarum X86 could be a promising probiotic for the prevention and treatment of S. aureus-induced mastitis."

Hypercalcemia after consuming almond milk has been reported in infants, but to our knowledge, we report the first case of almond milk-induced severe hypercalcemia in an adult. CASE REPORT: A 66-year-old male with a history of diabetes and chronic kidney disease was referred to the emergency department because of laboratory results that showed severe hypercalcemia and acutely elevated serum creatinine. The family member who brought the patient to the hospital reported that he had displayed intermittent confusion. History revealed that 4 weeks prior, the patient had stopped his habit of consuming a gallon of cow's milk every day because of hyperglycemia. He switched to consuming a gallon of unsweetened almond milk every day, leading to severe hypercalcemia. Other causes of hypercalcemia were ruled out. Treatment with intravenous fluids and calcitonin normalized the patient's serum calcium level and improved his kidney function. CONCLUSION: The consumption of almond milk in large quantities is associated with the potential risk of hypercalcemia, especially in patients with chronic kidney disease. Careful consideration of the mineral content is recommended."

The addition of multicomponent additive (MA) to human milk (HM) is used as a treatment strategy. The objective of the research is to analyze the association between the use of MA added to HM with nutritional and clinical outcomes in low-birth weight PTNB admitted to a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). METHODS: Prospective cohort study with PTNB weighing less than 2500 g during hospitalization in the NICU, who were divided into two distinct groups based on the presence or absence of MA supplementation. We investigated outcomes related to nutritional status at discharge, length of stay, presence of metabolic bone disease of prematurity (MBDP), extrauterine growth restriction (EUGR) and encouragement of breastfeeding at discharge. RESULTS: A total of 65 PTNB were included. We found that the lower the BW, the more often the use of MA was observed (p = 0.006). At discharge, there was a decline in z- scores, in which 46 % of PTNB who used MA developed malnutrition. The length of stay was longer in the group of PTNB who used MA (p < 0.001). The percentage of PTNB with MBDP who used MA (52.5 %) was higher than the percentage of those who did not use it (p = 0.006). The probability of PTNB with MBDP using MA is 2.65 times higher than those without MDBP. CONCLUSION: The use of MA to HM did not prevent or avoid the decline in nutritional status of the PTNBs, considering that those who used it had greater difficulty gaining weight, longer hospital stays, and more MBPD diagnoses compared to the group that did not use supplementation. However, the MA was crucial as it provided essential nutritional support for those PTNB who are more susceptible to MBDP."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: This study aims to assess the impact of an educational intervention based on the theory of planned behavior (TPB) on breastfeeding mothers' knowledge, attitude, subjective norms, perceived behavioral control regarding donor human milk (DHM), intention to donate milk and milk donation behavior. METHOD: This cluster randomized controlled trial (CRT) was performed on 67 breastfeeding mothers (intervention, n = 33; control, n = 34) in health centers affiliated to Tehran University of Medical Sciences (TUMS) from April 2023 to October 2023. Four weekly 60-min educational sessions were conducted based on the TPB through lectures, group discussions, psychodrama method, videos and pictures display for mothers in the intervention group, while the control group received only routine care. The data collection tool was a researcher-made questionnaire based on the TPB. It assessed breastfeeding mothers' knowledge, attitudes, subjective norms, perceived behavioral control regarding milk donation, intention to donate milk, and actual milk donation behavior. The questionnaire was completed by participants in both groups before, immediately and three months after the intervention. RESULTS: The findings indicated that both the intervention and control groups were similar in terms of demographic and obstetrics variables. Additionally, before the intervention, there were no significant differences between the two groups regarding knowledge (P = 0.552), attitude (P = 0.734), subjective norms (P = 0.813), perceived behavioral control (P = 0.453), intention to donate milk (P=0.476) and actual milk donation behavior (P = 0.105). However, the intervention group showed significant improvements in the mean score of noted variables immediately and three months after the intervention (P < 0.05). Moreover, regarding the frequency of milk donations, three months after the intervention, eight mothers in the intervention group had donated milk, whereas none of the mothers in the control group had done so (P = 0.002). CONCLUSION: Our findings showed that the TPB-based educational intervention significantly enhanced milk donation behavior among breastfeeding mothers. Given that donor mothers are crucial for the establishment and sustainability of human milk banks (HMBs), such programs should be implemented to increase milk donation rates and support the development of HMBs.

      "abstract": "The absence of multi-functional antimicrobial agents in clinical settings hinders cutaneous wound healing. Milk-derived antimicrobial peptides (MAPs) may be the imperative solution to wound repair, combining the dermatic curative properties of antimicrobial peptides with the biological activity of milk. Three novel MAPs, which were hLFT-68 (IAENRADAV) and hLFT-309 (GSPSGQKDLLF) identified in human milk and bLGB-111 (LDTDYKKY) identified in bovine milk in our previous work, were initially investigated for their function in wound healing. In vitro, the antibacterial activity and cellular mechanism of the MAPs were examined. It was found that they presented inhibition for Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli, decreased the secretion of inflammatory factors (IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α), and promoted fibroblast and keratinocyte proliferation. An infected wound model was established to evaluate the in vivo anti-inflammatory and regeneration properties of the MAPs. The wound area shrank more rapidly, and the wound inflammation was reduced by MAP treatment. Especially on days 3-5 after mouse modeling, the wound repair rate increased by up to 35%. Furthermore, it was suggested that they encouraged collagen synthesis and deposition, and tissue regeneration. The presented results indicated that MAPs accelerated the recovery of infected wounds, possessing the potential for developing wound-healing therapy.",

This study presents investigations on plasma treatment to inactivate Prototheca directly in milk. However, microbiological tests revealed a surprisingly high survival rate of Prototheca in milk compared to saline solution treated under the same conditions. This phenomenon appears to be due to presence of proteins that act as scavengers of plasma reactive species, with OH• radicals playing a major role. Studies using MALDI-TOF MS, FTIR, XPS and UV-VIS on a model solution of peptone K (simulating the molecular structure of milk protein fractions) confirmed the high reactivity of peptides with OH• radicals, leading primarily to the substitution of hydrogen atoms with hydroxyl groups and cleavage of peptide chains. The obtained results encourage a broader consideration of proteins' role in plasma treatment processes, including applications in food products and plasma medicine.",

Paneer slices were pre-treated at 4°C with four different concentrations of salt solution for 12 h at an osmotic solution-to-product ratio of 1:4 (w/w). Following pre-treatment, the samples were dried in a tray dryer at 50°C. The full-cream milk paneer was found to have the highest moisture content compared to other paneer varieties due to the homogenization process. The overall dimensional properties of OD-treated paneer, including average length, width, thickness, geometric mean diameter, surface area, and volume, ranged from 0.0174 to 0.0196 m, 0.0164 to 0.0186 m, 0.004 to 0.0054 m, 0.0108 to 0.0121 m, 0.34 × 10-3 to 0.464 × 10-3 m2, and 11.71 × 10-7 to 17.991 × 10-7 m3, respectively. The highest sphericity value of 0.6656 was noted in 12% OD-treated full-cream milk paneer. Bulk and true density increased non-linearly, while porosity decreased linearly with a reduction in moisture content from 12.46% to 9.25% (w.b) in buffalo milk samples. Untreated full-cream milk paneer exhibited the lowest angle of repose (29.89°) and volume shrinkage (19.82%) with an 8.37% decrease in moisture (w.b). Osmotic dehydration was found to have a favorable effect on the weights of 10, 50, and 100-paneer slice samples in buffalo milk, while cow milk paneer with higher solute concentration exhibited the highest rehydration ratio of 1.89. The OD-treated paneer sample with 12% concentration from cow milk exhibited a higher volume shrinkage value of 37.84%. The OD-treated paneer with a solute concentration of 3% from cow and buffalo milk was found to have the highest volume expansion of 60.25% and 88.81%, respectively, at room temperature. Regarding external friction coefficients, the highest value was observed for aluminum plates (0.59) in full-cream milk paneer, followed by galvanized iron (0.52) and stainless steel (0.42) in buffalo milk paneer. Paneer prepared from buffalo milk with a 3% solute concentration showed a significant decrease in hardness value to 393.56 N.",

This study investigates the effects of E. gracilis supplementation during late gestation and lactation on sow colostrum and milk biomolecular profiles. Sixty-one crossbred sows (Landrace × Yorkshire) were assigned to a standard diet (CON; n = 30) or the CON diet supplemented with 1 g/sow/day of E. gracilis (TRT; n = 31) from day 85 of gestation until day 21 of lactation. Sow performance, including litter size and weight, was recorded from birth to day 21 of age. Colostrum samples (n = 20; 10 sows/group) were collected within 1 h of farrowing, and milk samples were collected from the same sows on days 3 and 10 of lactation to assess alterations in non-volatile polar metabolites (NVM), fatty acids (FA), and associated metabolic pathways. On average, the litter size at birth was 14.2 ± 2.5 piglets/litter, with no effect of dietary treatment from birth to day 21 of lactation (P > 0.05). However, piglets suckled by TRT sows tended to have higher average daily gain from birth to day 21 of age than those suckled CON sows (191.0 ± 6.7 vs. 173.6 ± 6.8 g/day, P = 0.073). Chemometric analysis revealed distinct NVM and FA profiles between the groups, particularly in the colostrum. Although E. gracilis supplementation influenced the contents of multiple metabolites, focus has been given to those that have direct impact on piglet development, including increased colostrum leucine (P = 0.001), threonine (P < 0.001), and N-acetylglucosamine (P = 0.002), enhancing colostrum quality and immunomodulatory potential. Elevated colostrum gamma-linolenic acid (P = 0.047) and arachidonic acid (P = 0.019) levels suggested enhanced immune development. Pathways associated with amino sugars and nucleotide sugars and glucose-related metabolism in colostrum were also modulated. These findings suggest E. gracilis-derived β-glucan as a potential dietary supplement for enhancing sow colostrum quality and piglet growth."

Methods: In this randomized controlled trial, 120 mothers of premature newborns in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) were assigned to three intervention groups (massage, n = 30; warm compression, n = 30; massage-warm, n = 30) and one control group (n = 30). Mothers in the massage group performed massage, those in the warm compression group applied compresses, and the combined group used both methods, whereas the control group used a breast pump with no intervention. Milk production was measured in milliliters (mL) after each pumping session over 4 days, and anxiety levels were assessed at baseline and on the 4th day. Results: Mothers with premature newborns in the NICU had mean breast milk amounts of 1,321.43 ± 569.01 mL in the massage group, 1,470 ± 718.93 mL in the warm compression group, 1,484.23 ± 889.28 mL in the massage-warm group, and 913.75 ± 679.90 mL in the control group. The massage, warm compression, and massage-warm groups had significantly higher milk production than the control group (p < 0.05). In addition, anxiety levels in the intervention groups significantly decreased compared with the control group (p < 0.05). Mothers reported satisfaction with all interventions, with no significant differences between the groups (p > 0.05). Conclusion: Breast massage, warm compression, and breast massage-warm compression can be suggested as effective, simple, and cost-effective methods for increasing milk quantity and decreasing maternal anxiety."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Lofexidine (LUCEMYRA®) is the only FDA-approved, non-opioid, non-addictive treatment for opioid withdrawal symptoms, crucial for postpartum and pregnant women affected by the opioid crisis. Despite its clinical importance, data on its secretion into breast milk is limited. This study aims to develop a novel, microfluidic-based blood-milk-barrier on a chip model, a static human mammary cell transwell model, and a physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) lactation model to estimate the breast milk secretion of lofexidine, thereby ensuring maternal and infant safety and improving withdrawal management. METHODS: A novel microfluidic device was developed to build a mammary epithelium-on-a-chip model, and a transwell plate was used to develop a static mammary epithelium using a human noncarcinogenic mammary epithelial cell (MEC) population that can form an integrated barrier with tight junctions. Both models were used to evaluate the transfer of lofexidine through the in vitro mammary cell barrier. The fraction of unbound lofexidine in the breast milk was determined by a Rapid Equilibrium Dialysis (RED) assay. Eleven approaches, including a novel, previously published in vitro to in vivo extrapolation (IVIVE) approach and various other approaches, were used to estimate milk-to-plasma (M/P) ratios of lofexidine. A whole-body lactation PBPK model was built using Simcyp® simulator v22 and used to predict the concentration-time profiles of lofexidine in both human plasma and breast milk. RESULTS: A subpopulation of human normal mammary epithelial MCF10A cells (named MCF10A-TJ) was identified to form an integrated barrier that reaches trans-epithelial electrical resistance (TEER) values of over 1000 Ω·cm2 by culturing with in-house designed maintenance and boosting medium. The microfluidic device-based mammary epithelium-on-a-chip model generated slightly higher lofexidine permeability values than the static transwell mammary epithelial cell model. The predicted milk-to-plasma (M/P) ratio of lofexidine ranged from 0.40 to 15.88. Four approaches estimated an M/P ratio below 1, while seven predicted values above 1, mostly between 1.35 and 5.48. The whole-body lactation PBPK model predicted the concentration-time profile of lofexidine in breast milk, with an estimated M/P ratio of approximately 2.0. This value falls within the mid-range of the predictions obtained from all eleven methods. CONCLUSION: This study introduces comprehensive and novel approaches to predict lofexidine secretion into breast milk. Most predictions suggest higher lofexidine concentration in milk than in plasma, raising potential safety concerns for opioid withdrawal management. Further pharmacokinetic clinical lactation studies are needed to validate these predictions."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Breastfeeding rates among US mothers, particularly Black or African American mothers, fall short of recommended guidelines. Despite the benefits of human milk, only 24.9% of all infants receive human milk exclusively at 6 months. OBJECTIVE: Our team previously explored the key content areas a mobile health intervention should address and the usability of an initial prototype of the Knowledge and Usage of Lactation using Education and Advice from Support Network (KULEA-NET), an evidence-based mobile breastfeeding app guided by preferences of Black or African American parents. This study aimed to identify the preferences and acceptability of additional features, content, and delivery methods for an expanded KULEA-NET app. Key social branding elements were defined to guide app development as a trusted adviser. The study also aimed to validate previous findings regarding approaches to supporting breastfeeding goals and cultural tailoring. METHODS: We conducted a qualitative study using in-depth interviews and focus groups with potential KULEA-NET users. A health branding approach provided a theoretical framework. We recruited 24 participants across 12 interviews and 2 focus groups, each with 6 participants. The Data methods aligned with qualitative research principles and concluded once saturation was reached. Given the focus on cultural tailoring, team members who shared social identities with study participants completed data collection and coding. Two additional team members, 1 with expertise in social branding and 1 certified in lactation, participated in the thematic analysis. RESULTS: All participants identified as Black or African American mothers, and most interview participants (7/12, 58%) engaged in exclusive breastfeeding. In total, 4 themes were recognized. First, participants identified desired content, specifying peer support, facilitated access to experts, geolocation to identify resources, and tracking functions. Second, delivery of content differentiated platforms and messaging modality. Third, functionality and features were identified as key factors, highlighting content diversity, ease of use, credibility, and interactivity. Finally, appealing aspects of messaging to shape a social brand highlighted support and affirmation, inclusivity and body positivity, maternal inspiration, maternal identity, social norms, and barriers to alignment with aspirational maternal behaviors as essential qualities. Crosscutting elements of themes included a desire to communicate with other mothers in web-based forums and internet-based or in-person support groups to help balance the ideal medical recommendations for infant feeding with the contextual realities and motivations of mothers. Participants assigned high value to personalization and emphasized a need to achieve both social and factual credibility. CONCLUSIONS: This formative research suggested additional elements for an expanded KULEA-NET app that would be beneficial and desired. The health branding approach to establish KULEA-NET as a trusted adviser is appealing and acceptable to users. Next steps include developing full app functionality that reflects these findings and then testing the updated KULEA-NET edition in a randomized controlled trial.",

For this reason, it is very important to perform a monitoring. METHODS AND RESULTS: Muscle samples from bovine, pig, poultry, turkey and fish, as well as bovine milk and hen's egg samples, deriving from 444 farms of both Umbria and Marche regions (Italy) were analyzed by well-established and validated analytical methods in order to evaluate the presence or not of antibiotic residues (penicillins, quinolones, tetracycline and sulphonamides). The samples were collected during 2012-2021 period of time. In total, 15/2,354 samples resulted positive to the analyses. The amount of antibiotics found in the 15 samples resulted below the maximum residue limit fixed by EU Regulation 37/2010 and for this reason considered compliant. CONCLUSIONS: Despite irregular samples were not found, the presence of antibiotic residues in foodstuff represents a risk for public health as they are responsible for the selection of resistant strains contributing to antimicrobial resistance problem spread. In the present work, this aspect was evaluated in relation to the results obtained from the analyzed samples coming from Umbria and Marche regions.",

      "abstract": "Extracellular vesicles have emerged as promising nanocarriers for targeted drug delivery, but their therapeutic potential is limited by challenges related to administration route, loading, targeted delivery and production at scale. Here, we report an innovative approach for targeted delivery of therapeutic peptides to injured tissues using milk-derived small extracellular vesicles (mEVs) as an abundant, safe, orally administrable nanoplatform. We demonstrate that a sub-population of mEVs naturally contain Connexin 43 (Cx43) and its Carboxyl-Terminal (CT) polypeptides, which have been shown to play crucial roles in wound healing and tissue repair. Leveraging this intrinsic property, we developed an esterification method to efficiently and uniformly load mEVs with enhanced levels of an exogenous Cx43 CT peptide (αCT11 - RPRPDDLEI), as assessed by flow cytometry-based vesicle quantification and mass spectrometry. These engineered mEVs exhibited remarkable injury targeting capabilities, with > 30-fold increases in uptake by injured cells compared to non-wounded cells in vitro and preferential accumulation in wounded tissues in vivo. Notably, αCT11-loaded mEVs orally administered after myocardial infarction reduced infarct size by >60% and preserved heart function in a mouse model of ischemia-reperfusion injury. This study represents a significant advance in nanomedicine, demonstrating the utilization of naturally occurring milk-derived extracellular vesicles as an oral delivery system for therapeutic peptides, achieving unprecedented targeting efficiency and efficacy in the treatment of myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury."

      "abstract": "UNLABELLED: Many environmental, genetic, and epigenetic variables are considered to influence the evolution of cow's milk allergy (CMA). The gastro-intestinal microbiota may play a direct role in or inhibit tolerance development. In this study, we planned to evaluate the presence of previously identified risk factors for microbiota composition. This study used a cross-sectional electronic survey in Turkiye, utilizing a national convenience sample of 270 children with CMA, as reported by their caregivers, and 2154 healthy controls. We developed a web-based questionnaire to gather information on pregnancy and maternal-related factors, delivery mode, feeding patterns, antibiotic use, and the presence of pets in the home. The risk factors affecting CMA were maternal age (OR 0.897; 0.862-0.934, p < 0.01), presence of maternal allergic disorders (OR 3.070; 1.891-4.983, p < 0.001) and in both parents (OR 3.831; 1.202-12.210, p < 0.001), maternal weight at conception (OR 1.016; 1.003-1.030, p < 0.05), maternal weight gain during pregnancy (OR 1.033; 1.012-1.056, p < 0.01), (absence of a) pet at home (OR 1.394; 1.003-1.938, p < 0.05), intrapartum antibiotic use (OR 1.469; 1.092-1.975, p < 0.05), antibiotic use during the first 6 months of life (OR 1.933; 1.306-2.863, p < 0.001), and number of householders (OR 0.794; 0.650-0.969, p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: In addition to allergic disorders in parents, maternal weight and weight gain during pregnancy, intrapartum and first 6 months of life antibiotic use, and the presence of pets at home were found to be microbiota-related risk factors in children with CMA. Potential strategies related to microbiota composition may contribute positively to the disease's development and progression. WHAT IS KNOWN: • The gut microbiome contributes to the development of cow milk allergy, and disrupted microbiota maturation during the first year of life appears to be common in pediatric food allergies. • Factors that influence an infant's microbiota within the first 1000 days and the relationship between these factors and microbiota may enhance allergy diagnosis, prevention, and treatment. WHAT IS NEW: • Besides parental allergy disorders, maternal weight and weight gain during pregnancy, antibiotic use during intrapartum and first six months of life, and the presence of pets at home were identified as microbiota-related risk factors in children with CMA.",

      "abstract": "This study evaluated the effects of EO administered via intramammary inoculation in dairy cows during the drying-off period and its impact on milk quality in the subsequent lactation. Ten pregnant Holstein cows, free of mastitis, were selected from an organic dairy farm in Córdoba, Argentina. Twenty-four quarters were inoculated with EO: eight received 0.25 g, eight received 0.50 g, and eight received 1.00 g. Control groups included uninoculated quarters and quarters treated with cephapirin. Milk samples were collected before treatment and within 4 days after calving to assess microbial count and somatic cell counts (SCC). The expression of TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-10 was quantified using qPCR and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels were also measured. Blood samples were collected before treatment and within 4 days after calving to determine serum IL-6 and IL-4 levels using ELISA. No significant effects were observed on milk's physical-chemical properties following EO or cephapirin treatment. EO at 1.00 g significantly reduced microbial load (p < 0.05), comparable to cephapirin. SCC increased with all EO doses (p < 0.01, p < 0.05, p < 0.05, respectively). Differential cell counts showed an increase in macrophages after 1.00 g EO treatment. The relative expression of TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-10 decreased without statistical significance. MDA levels significantly increased with cephapirin (p < 0.001), but EO had no effect. Serum IL-6 and IL-4 levels remained unchanged. In conclusion, intramammary EO inoculation enhanced immune response, reduced microbial load, and did not induce lipid peroxidation, suggesting its potential as a preventive treatment for mastitis.",

      "abstract": "Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are released by all cell types into the extracellular environment. A subset of EVs, known as exosomes, range in size from 30 to 200 nm and are of biochemical interest due to their function as vehicles of intercellular communication. Their ability to transport proteinaceous species and genetic material at the cellular level makes them prime candidates as vectors in gene therapies. Focusing on biotherapeutics, bovine milk-derived extracellular vesicles (MDEVs) hold particular promise as an alternative to other exosome sources for therapeutics delivery. Bovine milk poses unique challenges due to the complex colloidal matrix, composed predominantly of fats and proteins like casein, which form micelles that exhibit exosome-like characteristics, specifically size and density. When faced with complex matrices like milk, conventional size/density-based isolation methods including ultracentrifugation and size exclusion chromatography struggle to provide high purity yields on practical time and cost scales. When paired with a stepwise hydrophobic interaction chromatography (HIC) gradient, polyester (PET) capillary-channeled polymer (C-CP) fibers in column and spin-down tips formats have been used effectively to isolate exosomes from highly diverse sources. Here, PET C-CP fiber columns are demonstrated to isolate MDEVs from pre-treated raw milk, yielding concentrations of 1.5 × 1010 particles mL⁻1 with purities of ~2 × 1010 EVs µg-1 protein in less than 20 min. The efficacy of the isolation process is verified by a suite of characterization methods. Implementing PET C-CP fiber columns for MDEV isolation addresses the challenges associated with conventional isolation methods, holding promise for scale-up towards therapeutic applications.",

      "abstract": "Background/Objectives: Individuals with HIV on combined antiretroviral therapy (ART) with virologic suppression exhibit chronic immune activation and immune dysfunction. Numerous studies have shown that human milk oligosaccharide (HMO) controls the postnatal transmission of HIV-1, but its effect on adult HIV-1 infection is not known. The purpose of this study was to investigate the anti-HIV activity of Lacto-N-fucopentaose III (LNFPIII) in adult blood-borne macrophages. Methods: Primary human monocyte-derived macrophages from the blood of HIV-seronegative individuals were infected with HIV and treated with or without dextran-conjugated LNFPIII (P3DEX). HIV replication was measured by quantifying the accumulation of HIV Gag p24 in the culture supernatants by ELISA. The quantities of chemokines MIP-1α, MIP-1β, and CCL5 in the culture supernatant were also measured by ELISA. The expression of IL-1β, IL-18, TNFα, IL-10, BECN1, and housekeeping gene HuPO in the macrophages was determined by qRT PCR. The expression of NF-kB, LC3, p62, and β-actin was measured by immunoblotting. Results: We found that P3DEX controls HIV replication without affecting HIV binding and/or internalization by human macrophages. The treatment of HIV-infected macrophages with P3DEX increased the quantity of beta (β)-chemokines MIP-1α, CCL5, and MIP-1β, which are known to have anti-HIV activity. Furthermore, the treatment of HIV-infected macrophages with P3DEX increased autophagic flux in a TLR8-dependent manner and ameliorated the expression of proinflammatory cytokines. These results suggest that P3DEX is a prominent milk-derived sugar that simultaneously augments anti-viral mechanisms and controls immune activation. These findings prudently justify the use and clinical development of P3DEX as a host-directed therapeutic option for people living with HIV.",

      "abstract": "The protective effects of the milk fat globule membrane (MFGM) in alleviating inflammation have been reported. However, limited attention has been paid to the key fraction of milk fat globule membrane protein (MFGMP). This study investigated the protective effects of camel MFGMP against dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced ulcerative colitis (UC) in mice. The results revealed that administering 50 mg/kg MFGMP significantly alleviated colonic inflammation, as evidenced by a marked decrease in IL-6, IL-1β, and TNF-α levels, along with pathological damage in DSS-induced mice with UC. MFGMP supplementation partially regulated gut microbiota dysbiosis in mice with UC by increasing α-diversity and the relative abundance of beneficial gut bacteria, such as Lactobacillus, while decreasing the abundance of Akkermansia. Additionally, MFGMP treatment exhibited significant regulatory effects on metabolites, particularly amino acid metabolism, in the feces. Specifically, this treatment restored L-valine to normal physiological levels and increased the concentrations of L-leucine, L-lysine, and L-tyrosine to nearly twice their baseline levels, whereas the concentration of L-tryptophan increased threefold. These upregulated amino acids were negatively correlated with pro-inflammatory cytokines and positively correlated with the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10, as indicated by Spearman's correlation analysis. Furthermore, the significant reduction in the mRNA expression levels of WNT-1, β-catenin, and Cyclin D1 suggests that MFGMP exerts a positive effect on UC via the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. These findings indicate that MFGMP exerts a protective effect against UC by modulating intestinal microbiota and amino acid metabolism in mice, with potential implications for treating intestinal inflammatory diseases.",

      "abstract": "Protein constitutes the primary nutrient in soy, and its modifications are intricately linked to the properties of the soy milk powder. This study employed six main commercial enzymes (bromelain, neutrase, papain, trypsin, flavourzyme, and alcalase) to investigate the impact of enzymatic hydrolysis on the structural and functional properties of soy protein isolate (SPI), as well as its influence on the physicochemical properties of soy milk powder. The findings indicated that each of enzymes exhibits distinct specificity, with the degree of hydrolysis following the order: alcalase > flavourzyme > papain > bromelain > neutrase > trypsin. Enzymatic hydrolysis facilitates the unfolding of SPI, leading to the exposure of chromogenic fluorophores and hydrophobic amino acid residues, which in turn promotes an increase in free sulfhydryl content. Concurrently, this process induces the transformation of α-helix and β-sheet into β-turn and random coil. The enzyme modification enhances the solubility, emulsification, and foaming activities of SPI and significantly augment its antioxidant properties (p < 0.05). However, this enzymatic treatment adversely affects the stability of its emulsification and foaming properties. Subsequent to enzymatic hydrolysis, soy milk powder demonstrated a reduction in particle size and an improvement in solubility, which significantly enhanced its flavor profile. In summary, alcalase offers substantial advantages in augmenting the functional properties of SPI and increasing the solubility of soy milk powder. However, this process adversely affects the flavor profile of soy milk powder, a consequence attributed to the broad hydrolysis specificity of alcalase."

      "abstract": "Globally, mothers are increasingly combining breastfeeding with formula milk, fresh animal milk, or powdered milk in different proportions in the world including Ethiopia. However, the spatial evidence of mixed milk feeding practice (MMFP) and its spatial predictors among mothers with 0-6 months of children is limited in Ethiopia. Hence, this study aimed to map MMFP and its spatial predictors among mothers with children aged 0-6 months in Ethiopia. A secondary data analysis was carried out using a weighted sample of 550 mothers with children aged 0-6 months. Spatial analysis techniques were employed to identify geographic hotspots and predictors of mixed milk feeding practices (MMFP) among mothers of children aged 0-6 months in Ethiopia. Statistical significance was determined at a p-value < 0.05, and the geographic weighted regression coefficients were reported. The spatial autocorrelation analysis, with a global Moran's I value of 0.41 and a p-value < 0.001, revealed a significant clustering of MMFP in Ethiopia. Spatial hotspot analysis revealed clusters of MMFP in regions such as Addis Ababa, Dire Dawa, Amhara, Afar, Oromia, and Somali. Interpolated MMFP prevalence was observed to be high in Somalia, Afar, Addis Ababa, and Dire Dawa. Geographically weighted regression analysis indicated that higher maternal education, female-headed households, urban residence, community-level maternal literacy, wealthier households, multiple births, and child age (4-6 months) were associated with an increased likelihood of MMFP. In contrast, antenatal care (ANC) visits were associated with a reduced likelihood of MMFP with distinct geographically dependent relationships in specific regions of Ethiopia. The spatial hotspot revealed that MMFP clustered in Ethiopia specifically in urban areas of Somali, Addis Ababa, Afar, Amara, Diredawa, and Oromo regions. The geographically weighted regression analysis revealed that the educational status of mothers, female household heads, urban residents, community-level maternal literacy, rich households, multiple births, and children aged 4-6 months increases the likelihood of MMFP in Ethiopia. However, ANC visits reduce the likelihood of MMFP with distinct geographic dependent relationships in a specific region of Ethiopia. The study highlights the need to tailor region/space-specific intervention based on these geographically identified predictors in specific regions.",

Two thermal treatment categories were applied: moderate (63 °C for 30 min and 72 °C for 15 s) and high (85 and 90 °C for 15 s and 30 min). Findings indicated that raw camel milk was found to be microbiologically unacceptable. Heating milk to 90 °C for 30 min notably reduced fermentation time, increased fermented milk viscosity, and altered whey protein electrophoretic patterns. While thermal treatments below 90 °C boosted lactic acid bacteria count in fermented milk compared to raw milk-derived samples (control), all treatments exceeded the recommended standards throughout storage. Thermal treatment decreased the proteolysis degree and DPPH radical scavenging activity but enhanced the ferric-reducing power of fermented milk compared to the control. Among, thermal treatments, samples from milk heated at 90 °C exhibited the highest scavenging activity and reducing power. Antibacterial efficacy against Salmonella Typhimurium surpassed that against Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus; the most pronounced effect was observed in samples from milk heated at 90 °C. In conclusion, thermal treatment of camel milk is crucial to ensure sufficient hygiene for safe milk consumption. Heating camel milk at 90 °C before fermentation positively impacted most of the studied properties.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Although breast milk is ideal for newborns, in some cases, it is replaced with cow's milk, which contains proteins that increase the risk of cow's milk protein allergy (CMPA). AIM: To evaluate CMPA prevalence in Bahrain and compare clinical characteristics of children with immunoglobulin E (IgE)- and non-IgE-mediated CMPA. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study examined children with CMPA diagnosed at the pediatric gastroenterology outpatient clinic of the Salmaniya Medical Complex, Bahrain, between 2014 and 2022, and assessed CMPA prevalence. Clinical presentations, laboratory findings, dietary modifications, and outcomes were compared between children with IgE-mediated and non-IgE-mediated CMPA. Categorical variables were compared using Fisher's exact test or Pearson's χ 2 test, whereas continuous variables were compared using Student's t-test or the Mann-Whitney U test. RESULTS: Of 8332 patients, 6022 (72.3%) adhered to their appointment. Of them, 618 (10.3%) were suggested of having CMPA and 595 (96.3%) were included; CMPA prevalence was 2%. Most patients were Bahraini (93.8%) and males (55.3%). Non-IgE-mediated type accounted for 77.3% cases and IgE-mediated type, 22.7%. IgE-mediated CMPA presented more in boys (P = 0.030), and later in life (5.1 months ± 4.5 months vs 4.2 months ± 4.2 months, P = 0.016, 95%CI: 0.08-1.73), had more associated diseases (P < 0.001); and presented with more cutaneous (P = 0.024) and respiratory (P = 0.003) manifestations, severe symptoms [rash/dry skin (P = 0.031), facial swelling/angioedema (P = 0.003), failure to thrive (P = 0.013), apparent life-threatening event (P < 0.001)], and positive physical findings (P = 0.002) than non-IgE-mediated CMPA. Most patients were exclusively fed cow milk formula (50.3%). The amino acid-based formula (AAF) was most prescribed (60.5%) with no difference between the two types (P = 0.173). Although breastfeeding was recommended to 49.6%, only 8.2% were exclusively breastfed. IgE-mediated CMPA was associated with a longer follow-up duration than non-IgE-mediated CMPA (17.3 months ± 14.0 months vs 13.5 months ± 13.4 months, P = 0.005, 95%CI: 1.1-6.3). CONCLUSION: This study revealed a high CMPA prevalence with clinical differences between both types that can influence treatment. AAF was most prescribed, while breastfeeding with dietary modification is rarely applied."

      "abstract": "The association of pea proteins (PP) with a more consumer-accepted product, such as milk, is considered as a strategy to improve plant protein consumption. This study investigates the physicochemical and rheological properties of mixed milk protein (MP): PP systems at different protein ratios (100:0, 80:20, 60:40, 40:60, 20:80, 0:100, MP:PP) in high-concentrated protein systems, before and after thermal treatment. The results showed that MP, represented by casein, and PP form independent networks with rheological behavior dependent on the major protein fraction involved in the mixture. However, a synergistic effect on elasticity and viscosity was observed for the 20:80 ratio, which was further accentuated by temperature and protein concentration increase. Also, the water dynamic was reduced after the thermal treatment, showing that in this ratio the casein, present in the milk proteins suspension is finely distributed within the PP network. These results bring new insights into the physical properties of composite plant/animal protein systems for the development of innovative mixed formulations.",

      "abstract": "The European Commission (EC) requested the European Food Safety Authority to evaluate the nutritional safety and suitability of a specific protein hydrolysate derived from sources of skimmed cow's milk (including non-fat) and whey protein concentrates for use in infant and follow-on formula manufactured by Healthcare Reckitt B.V. Healthcare Reckitt B.V. submitted a dossier to the EC seeking an amendment to Regulation (EU) 2016/127 regarding the protein sources permissible in the manufacture of infant and/or follow-on formula. The protein hydrolysate under evaluation is sufficiently characterised with respect to the hydrolysed protein. In the pertinent intervention study provided, an infant formula manufactured from the protein hydrolysate with a protein content of 2.3 g/100 kcal and consumed as the sole source of nutrition for 3 months led to growth that is similar to an infant formula manufactured from intact cow's milk protein with a protein content of 1.9 g/100 kcal. Data on adverse events and tolerance of the formula did not raise any concerns. No experimental data have been provided on the nutritional safety and suitability of this protein source in follow-on formula. Given that follow-on formula is consumed with complementary foods and the protein source is nutritionally safe and suitable in an infant formula that can be the sole source of nutrition of young infants, the Panel considers that the protein hydrolysate is also a nutritionally safe and suitable protein source for use in follow-on formula. The Panel concludes that the protein hydrolysate under evaluation is a nutritionally safe and suitable protein source for use in infant and follow-on formula, as long as the formula in which it is used contains a minimum of 2.3 g/100 kcal protein and complies with the compositional criteria of Regulation (EU) 2016/127 and the amino acid pattern in its Annex IIIA."

Milk fortification provides an efficient way to supplement young calves before they transition to solid feed. This study evaluated the response of dairy calves to milk fortification with an advanced chelated trace minerals supplement containing Zn, Mn, Cu, Fe, Co, Cr, and Se, each selected for their specific roles in calf development, synthesized using Chelate Compounds technology. METHODS: Forty-two Holstein dairy calves (21 male and 21 female) were randomly assigned to three experimental groups: control (CON, unfortified milk), chelated minerals (BON, milk fortified with chelated trace minerals), and inorganic minerals (IOR, milk fortified with inorganic trace minerals). Calves received their respective milk treatments daily from d 3 until weaning at 70 d of age. Growth performance and body measurements were measured throughout the experimental, while rectal temperature, fecal consistency, and frequency of medical treatment were recorded until d 21. Blood metabolites and nutrient digestibility were also determined. RESULTS: BON showed significant positive effects on body weight and some body measurements, with trends towards improved average daily gain and feed efficiency. The calves in BON group showed a lower fecal consistency index and lower frequency of medical treatments compared to CON and IOR. Lower globulin levels as well as higher levels of albumin and albumin/globulin ratio were observed in BON compared to the other two groups. The activities of liver enzymes were higher in IOR than BON and CON group. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that milk fortification with advanced chelated trace minerals have the potential to improve growth performance and health in dairy calves, while inorganic sources showed no benefits. Further research is needed to determine optimal supplementation levels and long-term effects on health and productivity of dairy calves."

METHODS: A total of 57 F1 multiparous sows (Yorkshire × Landrace) were allotted to one of three treatment groups in a completely randomized design. The sows were fed corn-soybean meal-based diet supplemented with 0, 0.05, or 0.10% of bacteriophage cocktail during the gestation period and they were fed a common diet during the lactation period. Body weight and bacfact thickness were measured throughout the trial along with blood collection for immunoglobulin analysis. Fecal samples were collected on 4, 6, 8, and 10 weeks of gestation period for fecal microflora. Litter performance and milk composition were investigated on 24 hrs postpartum and d 21 of location. RESULTS: Increasing bacteriophage cocktail supplementation levels in gestation diets linearly increased (P < 0.05) feed intake of lactating sows and alive litter weight, and quadratically increased (P < 0.05) litter weight gain from d 0 to 21 of lactation. Dietary treatment did not affect the serum concentrations of immunoglobulin G and immunoglobulin M in the sows. Increasing dietary bacteriophage cocktail levels in gestation diets linearly increased (P < 0.05) the fat content in colostrum. In fecal microflora of sows, the dietary bacteriophage cocktail significantly increased (P < 0.05) the counts of Lactobacillus for d 63 and 105 of the gestation period and decreased the counts of E. coli (P < 0.05) and Salmonella (P < 0.10) for the late gestation period. CONCLUSION: Supplementation of bacteriophage cocktail at 0.05% in the diet for gestating sows could improve total litter weight and alive litter weight at birth and litter weight gain during the lactation period through a positive change in fecal microflora with an increase of Lactobacillus and decrease of E. coli, and Salmonella."

Thirty-six lactating multiparous Holstein cows were used with a milk yield average of 39 kg/d and 64 d in milk. The experiment was conducted over 60 d using two groups: control (CON; n = 18) was supplemented with sodium bicarbonate at 1.1% dry matter and a treatment group that received Lithothamnium calcareum at 0.5% of dry matter (LITHO; n = 18). Each group was fed daily with the buffers mixed to the total mixed ration containing 29.28% starch. Ruminal fluid collections were performed weekly to evaluate pH and volatile fatty acids. Feeding behaviour data were obtained through automatic feeders, while overall behavioural data were obtained using monitoring collars. Milk yield was recorded daily and adjusted for fat and energy. Milk samples were retrieved once weekly for analysis of fat, protein, lactose and total solids. Blood samples were collected weekly for metabolic analysis and faecal samples were collected weekly to evaluate pH and starch concentrations. LITHO produced more fat- and energy-corrected milk (P ≤ 0.01) as well as the highest percentage of fat and solids (P < 0.05) when compared to the CON group. Data on feeding behaviour showed an increased eating time (P ≤ 0.01) in the LITHO group but a higher eating rate (P < 0.01) in the CON group. Animals from the LITHO group had lower faecal pH (P < 0.05). The treatment did not affect dry matter intake, animal behaviour, ruminal acid-base balance, or faecal starch. In summary, Lithothamnium calcareum supplementation at 0.5% of dry matter improved milk yield, milk composition and, presumably, feed conversion efficiency."

      "abstract": "Our objective was to determine the effects of storage temperature and storage time on the chemical, physical, and sensory properties of ultra-high-temperature-direct steam injection aseptic milk. Milk was collected on 2 different processing dates (2 replicates) at a commercial aseptic milk processing facility immediately as containers came off the processing line. Milk was heat treated by direct steam injection (142°C for 3 s) with a flash vacuum cooling step following the holding tube and packaged aseptically in 946-mL aseptic packages. Packages were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 treatment groups (storage temperature of 4°C or 21°C). Half of the packages of 1% aseptic milk were cooled immediately off the processing line in ice and held at 4°C, and the other half were cooled to 21°C and held at 21°C for 12 mo. An unopened package of 1% aseptic milk that had been stored at 4°C or 21°C was opened and analyzed each month (for 12 mo) by chemical and descriptive sensory analyses. Chemical analyses included volatile compounds, viscosity, furosine, and dissolved oxygen. At 2 wk, 6 mo, and 12 mo, milk samples stored at each temperature were evaluated by consumers along with commercial 1% HTST milk. By descriptive sensory analysis, sulfur-eggy flavor decreased faster and caramelized flavor increased faster in aseptic milk stored at 21°C than in that stored at 4°C. Similarly, relative abundance of sulfur volatiles was lower initially in milk stored at 21°C than in that cooled and stored at 4°C. Furosine concentration was higher in milk stored at 21°C than in milk stored at 4°C. There were differences in consumer liking between the aseptic milk samples stored at the 2 storage temperatures, but they did not translate to an advantage in flavor liking for aseptic milk. Consumers indicated higher liking scores for fresh, refrigerated HTST milk than aseptic milk stored at either temperature at all 3 storage time points. Fluid milk processors need to focus on developing technology to increase the sensory liking scores of aseptic milk to maintain and increase fluid milk consumption as consumer lifestyles increase the demand for shelf-stable beverages."

      "abstract": "Milk fat synthesis is tightly regulated by hormones and growth factors. Leptin is a versatile peptide hormone that exerts pleiotropic effects on metabolic pathways. In this study, we evaluated the expression and function of leptin and its long form receptor OB-Rb in dairy cow mammary tissues from different physiological stages and in cultured mammary epithelial cells. The results showed that the expression of leptin and OB-Rb were significantly higher in the mammary tissues of lactating cows as compared with dry cows, suggesting that they are related to milk component synthesis. In cultured dairy cow mammary epithelial cells, leptin treatment significantly increased OB-Rb expression and intracellular triacylglycerol content. Transcriptome analysis identified the difference in gene expression between leptin treated cells and control cells, and 317 differentially expressed genes were identified. Gene ontology and pathway mapping showed that lipid metabolism-related gene expression increased and signal transduction pathway-related genes were the most significantly enriched. Mechanistic studies showed that leptin stimulation enhanced sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 expression via activating the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/protein kinase B/mammalian target of rapamycin (PI3K/AKT/mTOR) signaling pathway, which in turn up-regulated the expression of genes related to milk fat synthesis. Moreover, we found that fatty acid synthesis precursors, acetate and β-hydroxybutyrate, could positively regulate the expression of leptin and OB-Rb in bovine mammary epithelial cells, thereby potentially increasing milk fat synthesis. Our study provided novel evidence in the regulation of leptin on milk fat production in mammary glands of dairy cows, as well as experimental basis for artificial regulation of milk fat."

Our hypothesis was that weight growth velocity in the test group would be non-inferior to that in the control group. DESIGN: Double-blind, randomised controlled trial. SETTING: Nine European neonatal intensive care units. PATIENTS: HM-fed infants born at <32-week gestational age. INTERVENTIONS: Fortification of HM with Test or Control HMF for a minimum of 21 days. PRIMARY OUTCOME: Weight growth velocity between baseline and intervention day 21. RESULTS: From March 2018 to July 2020, 102 and 103 infants were enrolled in the test and control groups, respectively. Weight growth velocity during the first 21 days in the test group (mean 18.4 g/kg/day) was non-inferior to that of controls (mean 18.5 g/kg/day), with a difference in estimated means of -0.175 g/kg/day (90% CI -1.34 to +0.99 g/kg/day; per-protocol population). No significant differences between groups were observed for gain in length, head circumference or anthropometric Z-scores. Rates of digestive intolerance, stool frequency and consistency were comparable. No significant differences were reported in common neonatal morbidities including necrotising enterocolitis (test: 2.9%, control: 6.9%, mean difference -4.0% (95% CI -11.1% to 2.2%); all subjects treated population). CONCLUSIONS: Use of the novel HMF containing lipids, higher protein and lower carbohydrate levels supports adequate postnatal growth and appears safe and well tolerated in very preterm infants.

      "abstract": "The health status of the growing infant is closely related to the development of the gut microbiota during infancy, which is also a major stimulator of the immune system. Goat milk oligosaccharides (gMOs) are a class of bioactive compounds in goat milk, which have attracted extensive research interest in recent years. Recent studies have highlighted that gMOs as prebiotics can regulate the gut microbiota, exhibit multiple health effects, and act as immunomodulators. This article outlines the structure, classification, and functions of gMOs. In addition, we also deeply explored the mechanism of gMO interaction with infant gut microbiota and regulation of infant immunity. Finally, the possibility of gMOs as an effective substitute for natural prebiotics in breast milk is revisited. We concluded that gMOs improve infant immune function by regulating intestinal beneficial bacteria (Bifidobacteria, Lactobacilli, etc.) and their metabolism. Therefore, gMOs are significant to infant immune health and are expected to become a substitute for human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs).",

Eighty multiparous sows (Landrace × Large white) were randomly allocated to two treatment groups (with or without 1000 mg/kg GML) with 40 replicates per treatment. The feeding experiment lasted from d 85 of gestation (G85) to d 23 of lactation (L23). The samples were collected on d 1 (L1) and 21 (L21) of lactation. Our results showed that maternal GML supplementation significantly increased litter weight (P = 0.002), average daily gain of piglets (P = 0.048), and sow average daily feed intake (P = 0.032). Compared with CON group, the concentrations of lauric acid (C12:0; P = 0.022), C16:0 (P = 0.001), and total saturated fatty acids (P = 0.006) in colostrum as well as C12:0 in L21 milk (P = 0.001) were higher in GML group. Besides, the concentrations of immunoglobulin A (IgA) and IgG in colostrum as well as sow and piglet plasma, the total antioxidant capacity and superoxide dismutase activity in sow colostrum were also significantly higher in the GML group (P < 0.05). Microbiome results showed that GML addition increased fecal microbial alpha diversity as well as the relative abundances of short chain fatty acids producing bacteria Ruminococcaceae and Parabacteroides; and decreased the harmful Proteobacteria of sows (P < 0.05). The Spearman analysis showed that the microbial biomarkers Prevotellaceae, Ruminococcaceae, and Parabacteroides were positively correlated with IgA and IgG of sow plasma and milk (P < 0.05). Besides, maternal GML addition up-regulated the relative protein expressions of proliferating cell nuclear antigen, cyclin D1, G protein-coupled receptor 84 (GPR84) and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (Akt) pathway in the duodenum and jejunum of piglets. Collectively, current findings suggested that maternal GML supplementation enhanced piglet growth during lactation, which might be associated with improving milk fat and lauric acid contents, microbiota derived immunoglobulins transfer, and gut health through potential involvement of GPR84 and PI3K/Akt signaling pathway."

Traditionally antibiotics are used for their treatment, but the development of antibiotic resistance has increased the importance of using non antibiotic alternative such as probiotic. In current study a previously in vitro characterized isolate Lactobacillus plantarum CM49 infused into two groups of cattle suffering from clinical mastitis (n = 5) and sub-clinical mastitis (n = 5). RESULTS: The bacterial composition and diversity analysis of milk samples before and after probiotic administration was analyzed using 16S rRNA gene base metagenomic analysis and lactobacillus counts were also evaluated using Real time PCR. The results show that there was an increase in abundance of Proteobacteria and decrease in Firmicutes at phylum level in both groups while major mastitogens genera Staphylococcus and Streptococcus abundance was reduced after treatment in sub-clinical mastitis group (SCMG) and clinical mastitis group (CMG) respectively. Lactobacilli counts evaluated through Real time PCR showed an increase in number, furthermore diversity indices showed an increase in diversity after treatment with probiotic. CONCLUSION: It is concluded from the results that Lactobacillus plantarum CM49 may serve as promising candidate for improving dysbiosis resulting from mastitis and improving microbial diversity.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Lacticaseibacillus paracasei strain Shirota (LcS) has shown benefits for stool consistency in populations with certain bowel complaints (e.g., constipation), but data in a United States population are limited. OBJECTIVES: This study evaluated the effects of LcS on hard or lumpy stools (HLS) in an otherwise healthy population that generally represents the United States adult demographic. METHODS: In this randomized, controlled, open-label study, 50 participants (41 females, 9 males) with HLS in ≥25% of bowel movements (BMs) during a 14-d run-in period were randomly assigned to receive either 80 mL fermented milk containing 8.0 × 109 colony forming units LcS/mL for 28 d (active group) or no intervention (control group) followed by a 14-d postintervention period. Bowel habits were recorded daily using a novel smartphone application. The primary endpoint was the presence of HLS in ≥25% of the participant-rated BMs using the Bristol Stool Form Scale over the 28-d intervention. Secondary endpoints included the presence of reduced frequency of BMs with HLS from baseline, stool frequency, straining, incomplete evacuation, artificial intelligence-derived stool image scores, and Patient Assessment of Constipation Quality of Life (PAC-QOL) scores. RESULTS: The active group showed a significantly lower proportion of participants with HLS in ≥25% of BMs [odds ratio: 0.34; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.14, 0.80; P = 0.014] along with a higher proportion of participants with a reduced frequency of BMs with HLS from baseline (odds ratio: 2.86; 95% CI: 1.03, 7.92; P = 0.043). The active group also demonstrated positive improvements in total PAC-QOL scores (P = 0.003). CONCLUSIONS: Daily consumption of LcS-containing fermented milk significantly reduced constipation symptoms and improved quality of life in an otherwise generally healthy United States adult population with a history of intermittent BMs producing HLS. The intervention was well tolerated, with no serious adverse events related to the product, suggesting its safety and potential as a dietary strategy for managing constipation. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT06014008 (https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06014008).",

      "abstract": "Raw milk is susceptible to bacterial contamination. While low-temperature storage inhibits the growth of most bacteria, psychrophilic bacteria can compromise dairy quality. Their complex community structure and diverse sources pose significant challenges for control. A total of 120 samples from 24 farms in Shandong, including raw milk, udder swabs, feed, tank water, and groundwater, were analyzed. All samples were collected from environments directly associated with the raw milk production process, where bacterial control measures could be readily implemented. SMRT sequencing and SourceTracker analysis identified groundwater as the main source of bacteria in raw milk. Groundwater can introduce bacteria into raw milk through the washing of cow surfaces and the cleaning of refrigerated tanks. High-abundance psychrophilic bacteria in raw milk included Pseudomonas, Lactobacillus, Acinetobacter, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. SouceTracker analyses found that the main source of Pseudomonas was not in an environment where bacterial control measures could be easily implemented. This finding analyses the reasons for the prevalence of Pseudomonas contamination in terms of the traceability of psychrophilic bacteria. Pseudomonas can be removed from raw milk (not source control) by methods such as CO2 treatment. This study identified the main environmental sources of the major psychrophilic bacteria Lactobacillus, Acinetobacter, and S. pneumoniae in raw milk in on-farm habitats as forage, water and udder, respectively. According to the contamination of psychrophilic bacteria in raw milk, targeted source control measures can be implemented, such as forage fermentation, water filtration, and udder cleaning, which are expected to achieve targeted psychrophilic bacteria prevention and control effects.",

      "abstract": "This study aimed to investigate the gastric digestion behaviour of heat-treated enriched milk containing Coenzyme Q10-loaded emulsions with different interfacial compositions. Four enriched milk types were compared: pasteurized with a Tween 80 stabilised emulsion (PAST-TW80), or with a sodium caseinate-stabilised emulsion (PAST-NaCN), and UHT with a TW80-stabilised emulsion (UHT-TW80), or PAST with a NaCN-stabilised emulsion (UHT-NaCN); all loaded with Coenzyme Q10. An in vitro dynamic gastric digestion model (Human Gastric Simulator) was utilized and the kinetics of milk coagulation and emptying of protein, lipid and Coenzyme Q10 were monitored. Adding NaCN-stabilised emulsion to heated milk led to a largely fragmented curd with signs of extensive droplets coalescence, disintegrating rapidly and accelerating protein and lipid release. Heated milk with TW80-stabilised emulsion produced a compact and closely integrated curd with limited coalescence, slowing nutrient emptying. UHT milk showed more curd fragmentation than PAST milk, regardless of emulsion type. The release profiles of Coenzyme Q10 were similar between UHT-TW80 and PAST-TW80 or between PAST-NaCN and UHT-NaCN, indicating the emulsion's interfacial composition as a key factor in controlling lipophilic bioactive release from the food matrix, regardless of heat treatment. These findings demonstrate that the emulsion's interfacial composition (NaCN vs TW80) and the heat treatment (PAST vs UHT) can be combined as a strategy to modulate milk coagulation kinetics and the rate of nutrient delivery to the small intestinal stage. This study provides insights into the development of functional milk products fortified with lipophilic bioactive compounds, as well as strategies for optimizing the controlled release of these compounds upon consumption.",

      "abstract": "This study investigates the metabolic impact of skim milk whey-derived protein concentrate (SPC) for infant formula, including its heat-treated (HT-SPC) and stored (HTS-SPC) variants, on the plasma, urine, and gut metabolites of newborn piglets, compared to conventional whey protein concentrate (WPC). Preterm piglets were fed formula containing WPC, SPC, HT-SPC, or HT-SPC, HTS-SPC for 5 days. Metabolomic analysis of plasma, urine, and colon content was performed using 1H NMR. Relative to WPC, SPC mainly affected colon content metabolites, increasing 19 metabolites in the colon and tyrosine in plasma, while decreasing pyruvate in colon content and glycine in plasma. Heat-treatment and storage of SPC led to increased metabolite concentrations in colon contents and urine. Notably, significant correlations between gut metabolites and abundant gut bacteria genes were observed only in the SPC-fed pigs. SPC induced higher branched chain amino acid concentrations in the gut, but had minimal effects on plasma and urinary metabolites, likely due to differences in dietary proteins and in microbiota metabolism. While the clinical effects of SPC-induced gut branched chain amino acids remain unclear, the results from our study suggest that SPC-based infant formula is metabolically safe for sensitive newborns, comparable to WPC-based formulas.",
