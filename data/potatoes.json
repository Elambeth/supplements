      "abstract": "Purple sweet potato (PSP) (Ipomoea batatas (L.) Lam) is a nutrient-rich \"K-favoring\" crop. The reasonable application of potassium is an important means of improving the quality and yield of PSP. We designed four different forms of potassium fertilizer treatments: K2SO4, KCl, KH2PO4, and K2HPO4, and used qRT-PCR and HPLC techniques to explore their differences in anthocyanin synthesis, accumulation, quality, and yield in PSP tubers. Our findings indicate that potassium fertilizer treatment enhances the expression of structural genes such as CHI (chalcone--flavonone isomerase), F3H (naringenin,2-oxogluturate 3-dioxygenase-like), F3‧H (flavonoid 3'-monooxygenase), ANS (leucoanthocyanidin dioxygenase-like), DFR (dihydroflavonol 4-reductase-like), and CHS (chalcone synthase), which encode key enzymes of the anthocyanin metabolism pathway. This is achieved by stimulating the high levels of expression of the transcription factor MYB, which controls anthocyanin accumulation. Consequently, this leads to increased activities of key anthocyanin biosynthetic enzymes Phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL, EC 4.3.1.5), chalcone isomerase (CHI, EC 5.5.1.6), dihydroflavonol 4-reductase (DFR, EC 1.1.1.219), and UDP-galactose flavonoid 3-O-galactosyltransferase (UFGT, EC 2.4.1.234), thereby promoting the synthesis and accumulation of anthocyanins within PSP tubers. This ultimately improves tuber quality and yield. Analysis conducted through hierarchical clustering heat map, principal component analysis (PCA), and comprehensive evaluation revealed that PSP exhibits varying sensitivities to different forms of potassium fertilizer, with KCl treatment significantly enhancing anthocyanin production efficiency. Our results will provide a theoretical basis and data support for the rational selection of potassium fertilizer types for actual PSP production.",

      "abstract": "Leaf-vegetable sweet potatoes incurred significant losses during storage, which resulted in a shortened shelf life and reduced commercial value. This study investigated the effects of tea polyphenols (TPs) fumigation and microporous packaging (MP) during 10 days at 10 °C and 90-95% RH. The results indicated that the preservation effects followed the order TP + MP > MP > TP > CK, with the TP + MP treatment effectively controlling the degradation rate of chlorophyll and delaying leaf yellowing. In addition, TP + MP treatment increased the activity of antioxidant enzymes, especially catalase (CAT) and ascorbate peroxidase (APX), and also enhanced non-enzymatic systems (flavonoids, total phenolics, and ascorbic acid). Pearson's correlation analysis showed a positive correlation between the decline in postharvest quality of leaf-vegetable sweet potatoes and the increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels. This study provided a robust theoretical and technical foundation for the development of effective postharvest preservation strategies for leaf-vegetable sweet potatoes."

      "abstract": "Enzymatic browning is one of the most troublesome issues for fresh-cut fruits and vegetables, as it not only reduces product quality and shelf life but also causes great waste and economic loss. Although many antibrowning technologies have been explored, few noncontact methods have been reported. In particular, the effect of using glutamate (Glu) is unknown. This study revealed that Glu treatment of whole tubers significantly reduced browning in fresh-cut potatoes. This whole-tuber Glu induction under optimal conditions (1 % Glu for 12 h) produced a brighter colour and better sensory quality than soaking slices in solutions of Glu or ascorbic acid. Notably, Glu induction led to increased jasmonic acid (JA) and jasmonate-isoleucine (JA-Ile) accumulation. The activities of 12-oxophytodienoic acid reductase 3 (OPR3), jasmonate-resistant 1 (JAR1), and coronatine-insensitive 1 (COI1) in the jasmonate synthesis pathway and the expression of their corresponding genes also increased. Additionally, phenylpropane metabolism was upregulated, as evidenced by increased levels of phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL), 4-coumaric acid coenzyme a ligase (4CL), phenolic compounds and flavonoids. Moreover, the reactive oxygen species (ROS)-redox balance improved, the contents of hydrogen peroxide and malondialdehyde (MDA) decreased, and the catalase (CAT) activity and 1,1-diphenyl-2-picryl-hydrazyl radical (DPPH) scavenging capacity increased. Finally, Glu induction increased microbiological safety, resulting in a lower total bacterial count. Thus, Glu induction may modulate jasmonic acid synthesis and signalling, regulate phenylpropane metabolism and the reactive oxygen species (ROS)-redox balance, and ultimately slow browning and improve storage quality in fresh-cut potatoes. This is the first report of a noncontact browning control technique involving Glu, which provides new ideas for the fresh-cut industry.",

      "abstract": "Heat treatment, a form of thermal stress can confer anti-browning properties to potato tubers. However, the effect of delayed cutting after catalytic infrared heat treatment (DC-CIRHT) on browning inhibition remains unexplored. The study optimized catalytic infrared heat treatment conditions (55 °C for 10 min) and delayed cutting time (3 d). DC-CIRHT significantly inhibited the increase of browning index and browning degree and did not affect the quality of potato tubers. The mechanisms underlying browning inhibition involve two aspects: the reduction of phenolic-enzyme catalysis and the enhancement of the defense system. DC-CIRHT inhibits browning by suppressing polyphenol oxidase, peroxidase and phenylalanine ammonia lyase enzyme activity, reducing total phenol and flavonoid content, enhancing antioxidant activity, reducing membrane permeability and MDA, and balancing amino acid metabolism. This method offers a novel strategy for inhibiting browning during the post-harvest storage and processing of fruits and vegetables.",

      "abstract": "This study investigates the combined effects of l-asparaginase pretreatment enzyme (10,000 ASNU/L) with three different frying techniques: deep, microwave, and air frying on acrylamide (AA) formation in French fries. Acrylamide content was analyzed using ultra-high performance liquid chromatography coupled with a Diode Array Detector The study reveals that air-fried potatoes contained the highest AA content among the three frying methods without enzyme pretreatment (963.83 µg/kg). In contrast, microwave-fried potatoes had the lowest (785.31 µg/kg). The enzymatic pretreatment significantly reduced AA levels particularly in microwave-fried potatoes, which recorded 482.28 µg/kg and 475.60 µg/kg after 20 and 30 min of enzyme treatment, respectively. These levels are below the reference threshold of 500 µg/kg as defined by Regulation (EU) 2158/2017. This study demonstrates that combining l-asparaginase treatment with microwave frying can effectively mitigate AA levels in French fries by providing a healthier alternative to conventional frying methods. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: This study highlights the possibility of developing a safer fried potato products through the combined use of l-asparaginase and microwave frying, effectively by reducing acrylamide levels below regulatory limits effectively. This strategy allows the optimization of frying processes, preserving the sensory quality of food and improving its safety. Furthermore, the proposed approach can be applied at both industrial, by offering innovative solutions for safer food preparation. Companies that adopt these techniques can benefit from regulatory compliance and increase the consumer confidence.",

      "abstract": "Sweet potato pulp is a by-product of sweet potato processing with a relatively high content of dietary fiber. However, due to its less-explored functional properties, its development and utilization rate are very low. In this paper, non-fiber components in raw sweet potato dietary fiber were first removed. Subsequently, cellulase treatment, ball milling and extrusion were employed to modify it respectively. The results showed that all properties were significantly improved after removing non-fiber components. On the basis of removing non-fiber components, three groups of samples with cellulase treatment, 0 min ball milling and extrusion at 140 °C could significantly improve the water holding capacity (WHC) and oil holding capacity (OHC) of the samples. The highest WHC could reach 7.21 g/g, 7.52 g/g, and 6.88 g/g respectively, while 5.20 g/g, 5.21 g/g, and 5.61 g/g for OHC. The sample with 0 min ball milling had the highest swelling power, up to 5.40 mL/g. Extrusion at 140 °C could increase the water solubility index, glucose adsorption capacity, and cholesterol adsorption capacity of the sample to the highest, reaching 40.33 %, 44.15 mmol/g, and 26.54 mg/g (pH 7). This study provides a theoretical and experimental basis for improving the processing and functional performance of crude sweet potato dietary fiber.",

Sweet potatoes were treated continuously in an Elea PEF Advantage Belt One system and prepared as SPKC, without peeling and sliced to a thickness of 1.7 mm. The specific energy for PEF application was set to either low (1.5 kJ/kg) or high (3.0 kJ/kg) with a field strength of 1.0 kV/cm and a pulse width of 6 μm. Batches of 500 g unrinsed potato slices were fried in canola oil at 130 °C for 360 s. The oil content in 3.0 g of fried SPKC was 1.39 g or 46.3%, whereas the oil content was 37.9% for high and 37.7% for low PEF-treatment conditions. Acrylamide (AA) in the fried SPKC was quantified by mass spectrometry to be 0.668 μg/g in the non-PEF control and 0.498 μg/g for low and 0.370 μg/g for high PEF treatment. The results of this study support the use of PEF in SPKC processing to reduce oil absorbance during frying by up to 9% and lower AA by up to 45%."

OD-treated and untreated samples were packaged at MAP (0.2% O2 + 12% CO2) and stored at 4, 8, and 12 °C. Color (Browning Index, BI), texture (hardness, Fmax), sensory characteristics (including total sensory quality), and microbial stability (total aerobic and anaerobic counts, Pseudomonas, Entrobacteriaceae, and yeasts/molds) were monitored during storage. After package opening, samples were deep-fried at 180 °C for up to 8 min, and the oil content of fried samples was quantified. Sensory evaluation of raw and fried samples was conducted. Untreated fresh-cut potatoes were characterized by detrimental color degradation starting from the third day of storage at 4 °C and presented microbial growth (total viable counts: 6 log (CFU)/g) on the sixth day, whereas pre-treated potato samples retained their color and microbiological stability after 15 and 18 days of cold storage, respectively. OD pre-treatment reduced the oil uptake during frying (up to 30%)."

The results revealed that AA treatment delayed starch degradation and reducing sugar accumulation while promoting sucrose and fructose accumulation. Scanning electron microscopy and particle size distribution analysis showed that AA treatment slowed starch granule degradation, preserved larger granule sizes, and reduced surface erosion, with minimal effects on starch molecular and crystalline structures. AA treatment primarily regulated changes in carbohydrate composition and content by modulating the activities and gene expression of key enzymes involved in starch and sucrose metabolism. These results suggest that AA treatment may delay wound healing by regulating starch and sucrose metabolism, offering a potential strategy for improving the storage quality of fresh-cut potatoes.",

A potato variety (Qingshu 9) with high Cd and Pb accumulation was used as the test crop, and seven treatments were set up: control (CK), special potato fertilizer (T1), humic acid (T2), special potato fertilizer + humic acid (T3), biochar (T4), calcium magnesium phosphate fertilizer (T5), and biochar + calcium magnesium phosphate fertilizer (T6). The remediation effect of the combined application of different passivators on the accumulation of cadmium and lead in potatoes in the contaminated soil of a mining area was studied. The results showed that, compared with CK, all passivator treatments improved the physical and chemical properties of the soil and reduced the available Cd and Pb content in the soil and in different parts of potatoes. The T6 treatment yielded the most significant reduction in the available Cd and Pb content in the soil, the Cd and Pb content in the potato pulp, and the enrichment factor (BCF) and transfer factor (TF) of the potatoes. Compared with T4 and T5, the content of available Cd in the soil decreased by 1.22% and 4.71%, respectively; the soil available Pb content decreased by 3.13% and 3.02%, respectively; the Cd content in the potato pulp decreased by 68.08% and 31.02%, respectively; and the Pb content decreased by 31.03% and 20.00%, respectively. The results showed that the application of biochar combined with calcium magnesium phosphate fertilizer had a better effect in terms of reducing the available Cd and Pb content in the soil and the Cd and Pb content in the potato flesh compared to their individual application. Biochar and calcium magnesium phosphate fertilizer can synergistically increase the content of soil available nutrients and reduce the activity of heavy metals in the soil to prevent the transfer and accumulation of cadmium and lead to potatoes, as well as improve their yield and quality. The results of this study provide technical support for safe potato planting and agricultural soil management."

Inhibiting QS has gained interest as a sustainable alternative to conventional treatments to control pathogens in agriculture. Here, we investigate the potential of a robust lactonase to inhibit P. atrosepticum virulence in vitro, combining phenotypic and proteomic studies. We report that exogenous lactonase treatment reduced the secretion of pectate lyase, cellulase, and polygalacturonase enzymes, leading to decreased virulence on potato tubers. Major changes in the P. atrosepticum proteome revealed that lactonase affects the abundance of proteins with various functions, including virulence. Taken as a whole, these results suggest that lactonase-mediated disruption of QS in P. atrosepticum is a promising strategy to limit P. atrosepticum infections.",

      "abstract": "Sweet potatoes are extremely vulnerable to mechanical wounds during harvesting and postharvest handling. It is highly necessary to take measures to accelerate wound healing. The effect of 20 g L-1 of ascorbic acid (AA) treatment on the wound healing of sweet potatoes and its mechanisms were studied. The results validated that AA treatment significantly reduced the weight loss rate and disease index. AA treatment effectively enhanced the formation speed of lignin and SPP at the wound sites, decreased the MDA content, and maintained the cell membrane integrity. AA enhanced the activities of PAL, C4H, 4CL, CAD, and POD and increased the contents of chlorogenic acid, caffeic acid, sinapic acid, ferulic acid, cinnamic acid, p-coumaryl alcohol, sinapyl alcohol, coniferyl alcohol, and lignin. Based on a transcriptomic analysis, a total of 1200 genes were differentially expressed at the sweet potato wound sites by the AA treatment, among which 700 genes were upregulated and 500 genes were downregulated. The KEGG pathway analysis showed that the differentially expressed genes were mainly involved in phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan biosynthesis; phenylpropanoid biosynthesis; and other wound healing-related pathways. As verified by a qRT-PCR, the AA treatment significantly upregulated the gene expression levels of IbSKDH, IbADT/PDT, IbPAL, and Ib4CL at the wound sties."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Rice and pasta are recommended as healthier than potatoes on the basis of their glycemic index when eaten alone. OBJECTIVES: The study objective was to evaluate postprandial glycemia (PPG), appetite, and food intake (FI) at meals with potatoes or rice when consumed with either meatballs or their vegetarian substitute. METHODS: In a randomized, single-blinded, crossover design, 26 (13 males and 13 females) healthy adults (age: 18-45 y; body mass index [kg/m2]: 18.5-29.9) consumed isocaloric fixed amounts of either meatballs or vegetarian-substitute balls with ad libitum access to either baked French fries (BFF), instant mashed potatoes (IMPs), or rice (control). FI was measured at the meal and at an ad libitum pizza meal served 120 min later. Blood glucose (BG), appetite, and plasma insulin responses were measured within the meal (0-30 min), postmeal (30-120 min), within pizza meal (120-140 min), and post-pizza (140-170 min). Effects of protein source, carbohydrate (CHO) source, and sex and their interactions were analyzed using analysis of variance followed by Tukey's post hoc test. RESULTS: Participants consumed 23-25% less treatment meal energy (kcal), 32-34% less CHO energy (kcal), and 13-16% less total energy (kcal) after the BFF and IMP than rice meals (P < 0.0001). Postmeal BG was lower after IMP (6.76 ± 0.15; P < 0.0001) and rice (6.92 ± 0.15; P = 0.0012) compared with BFF (7.19 ± 0.15). Post-pizza BG was higher after rice (6.77 ± 0.09) than that after BFF (6.51 ± 0.09; P = 0.0012) and IMP (6.39 ± 0.09; P < 0.0001). Postmeal meaned insulin was higher after BFF (82.16 ± 8.58) and IMP (77.75 ± 8.60) compared with rice (56.44 ± 8.59; P < 0.002). Insulin during pizza meal was lower after BFF (17.14 ± 6.90) compared with both IMP (39.03 ± 6.90; P = 0.0060) and rice (34.21 ± 6.90; P = 0.0336). Meatballs led to lower BG (6.48 ± 0.09; P = 0.0076) and higher insulin (84.54 ± 5.87; P = 0.0406) post-pizza compared with their plant protein substitute (6.64 ± 0.09 and 73.18 ± 5.87, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Adults consuming meatballs or plant-based substitute with ad libitum IMP had lower PPG post-treatment and at a later pizza meal compared with rice. Both IMP and BFF resulted in lower energy intake than after rice. This trial was registered at http://clinicaltrials.gov (https://register.

      "abstract": "In this study, hot water treatment (WT), ultrasonic treatment (UT), ultrasonic-sodium hydroxide treatment (UST), ultrasonic-enzyme treatment (UET), and ultrasonic-microwave treatment (UMT) were used to treat sweet potatoes. The structural, physicochemical, and functional properties of the extracted soluble dietary fibres (SDFs) were named WT-SDF, UT-SDF, UST-SDF, UET-SDF, and UMT-SDF, respectively. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), thermal properties, and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) analysis were employed. The structural results indicated that the UST-SDF exhibited the best thermal stability, highest crystallinity, and maximum specific surface area. Moreover, compared to hot water extraction, ultrasonic extraction, or ultrasonic extraction in combination with other methods, enhanced the physicochemical and functional properties of the SDF, including extraction yield, water-holding capacity (WHC), oil-holding capacity (OHC), glucose adsorption capacity (GAC), glucose dialysis retardation index (GDRI), sodium cholate adsorption capacity (SCAC), cholesterol adsorption capacity (CAC), nitrite ion adsorption capacity (NIAC), and antioxidant properties. Specifically, the UST-SDF and UMT-SDF showed better extraction yield, WHC, OHC, GAC, CAC, SCAC, and NIAC values than the other samples. In summary, these results indicate that UST and UMT could be applied as ideal extraction methods for sweet potato SDF and that UST-SDF and UMT-SDF show enormous potential for use in the functional food industry."

      "abstract": "Late blight, caused by Phytophthora infestans, is a major potato disease globally, leading to significant economic losses of $6.7 billion. To address this issue, we evaluated the antifungal activity of ZnO and CuO nanoparticles (NPs) against P. infestans for the first time in laboratory and greenhouse conditions. Nanoparticles were synthesized via a chemical precipitation method and characterized using various techniques. The XRD results revealed that the synthesized ZnO nanoparticles had a pure hexagonal wurtzite crystalline structure, whereas the CuO NPs had a monoclinic crystalline structure. TEM images confirmed the synthesis of quasi-spherical nanoparticles with an average size of 11.5 nm for ZnO NPs and 24.5 nm for CuO NPs. The UV-Vis Spectral Report showed peaks corresponding to ZnO NPs at 364 nm and 252 nm for CuO NPs.In an in vitro study, both ZnO and CuO NPs significantly (p < 0.05) inhibited the radial growth of P. infestans at all tested concentrations compared to the untreated control. The highest inhibitory effect of 100% was observed with ZnO and CuO NPs at 30 mg/L. A lower inhibition of 60.4% was observed with 10 mg/L CuO NPs. Under greenhouse conditions, 100 mg/L ZnO NPs was the most effective treatment for controlling potato late blight, with an efficacy of 71%. CuO NPs at 100 mg/L followed closely, with an efficacy of 69%. Based on these results, ZnO and CuO NPs are recommended as promising eco-friendly fungicides for the management and control of potato late blight after further research."

      "abstract": "Rapid wound healing is crucial in protecting sweet potatoes (Ipomoea batatas ) against infection, water loss and quality deterioration during storage. The current study investigated how acibenzolar-S-methyl (ASM) treatment influenced wound healing in harvested sweet potatoes by investigating the underlying mechanism. It was found that ASM treatment of wounded sweet potatoes induced a significant accumulation of lignin at the wound sites, which effectively suppressed weight loss. After 4days of healing, the lignin content of ASM-treated sweet potatoes was 41.8% higher than that of untreated ones, and the weight loss rate was 20.4% lower. Moreover, ASM treatment increased the ability of sweet potatoes to defend against wounding stress through enhancing processes such as increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), activation of enzymes involved in the ROS metabolism (peroxidase, superoxide dismutase and catalase) and phenylpropanoid pathway (phenylalanine ammonia lyase, cinnamate-4-hydroxylase, 4-coumarate-CoA ligase and cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase), and intensive synthesis of phenolics and flavonoids. These results suggest that treating harvested sweet potatoes with ASM promotes wound healing through the activation of the ROS metabolism and phenylpropanoid pathway.",

In this study, the effects of trans-2-hexenal (E2H), ascorbic acid (VC), dimethyl dicarbonate (DMDC), and the combined treatment of E2H, VC, and DMDC on quality deterioration in fresh-cut potatoes were investigated. The response surface methodology (RSM) demonstrated that E2H, VC, and DMDC concentrations of 0.010%, 0.65%, and 240 mg/L, respectively, were the optimum conditions for fresh-cut potato preservation. Further analysis showed that the combined treatment of E2H, VC, and DMDC was the most effective method of reducing quality deterioration in potatoes compared to the control and individual treatments. Furthermore, the combined treatment of E2H, VC, and DMDC could decrease the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) via improving antioxidant enzyme activities. Meanwhile, energy-metabolism-related enzyme activities and glutamate decarboxylase (GAD) activity were enhanced, while γ-aminobutyric acid transaminase (GABA-T) activity was reduced via the combined treatment of E2H, VC, and DMDC, which contributed to maintaining high energy levels and GABA content in potatoes. These findings suggested that the combined treatment of E2H, VC, and DMDC could protect membrane integrity through enhancing antioxidant capacity, energy levels, and GABA content to maintain quality in fresh-cut potatoes."

Besides, 30 % glycerol, 5 % calcium chloride, and 3 % ascorbic acid (w/w) were added to the coating solution as additives. The surface color, respiration rate, water vapor transmission rate, visible mold growth, and sensory analysis were assessed after seven days of storage. The inclusion of ascorbic acid and TEO in edible coating demonstrated a more effective delay in browning. The coated potatoes had lower OTR, CTR, and WVTR values for GG concentrations of 0.5 to 1 g/100 mL than the control. Compared to additives, higher concentrations of GG improved response parameters. The WVTR value of coated potatoes was significantly impacted by the interaction between CAEE and TEO with GG. Incorporating CAEE and TEO into the formulations of guar gum led to a reduction in the permeability of the coating to oxygen and water vapor. The seven days of extended shelf life compared to two days of control were observed with the optimized coating formulation. Furthermore, the application of the coating treatment proved effective in preventing enzymatic browning and creating a barrier against moisture and gases, contributing to prolonged freshness during extended storage periods.",

Age, specific preferences, and diminished eating functions have broadened the chewiness requirements for staple foods. Therefore, comprehending the formation mechanism of chewiness in staple foods and exploring approaches to modulate it becomes imperative. This article reviewed the formation mechanisms and quality control methods for chewiness in several of the most common staple foods (rice, noodles, potatoes and bread). It initially summarized the chewiness formation mechanisms under three distinct thermal processing methods: water medium, oil medium, and air medium processing. Subsequently, proposed some effective approaches for regulating chewiness based on mechanistic changes. Optimizing raw material composition, controlling processing conditions, and adopting innovative processing techniques can be utilized. Nonetheless, the precise adjustment of staple foods' chewiness remains a challenge due to their diversity and technical study limitations. Hence, further in-depth exploration of chewiness across different staple foods is warranted.",

The study measured key aspects such as moisture content, dynamic rheological properties, water state, protein secondary structure, color, and sensory assessment. The influence of these factors on the product's quality is analyzed. The findings revealed that the freeze-thaw treatment caused a reduction in water content, freezable water, and deeply bound water, as well as an increase in weakly bound water, β-sheet, random coil, and α-helix, and a decreased β-turn of the potato-oat composite dough. Additionally, the dough treated by freeze-thaw cycles resulted in darker color, and the sensory properties of the product were affected significantly after exceeding three freeze-thaw cycles. Moreover, an increase in the number of freeze-thaw cycles resulted in an upward trend of moisture content for the composite dough, whereas G' initially increased and then decreased. The G″ of the composite dough peaked after the third freeze-thaw cycle. Overall, the composite dough quality significantly deteriorated at the fourth freeze-thaw cycle. There was a significant increase in the freezable water content, the largest modulus of elasticity, and the smallest tan δ. Therefore, the usage of the potato-oat composite dough should not exceed three cycles."

In this study, resistant starch was obtained from purple sweet potato (PSPRS) by the enzymatic isolation method. Then, the structural properties of PSPRS and its protective function in dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis were investigated. The structural characterization results revealed that the crystallinity of PSPRS changed from CA-type to A-type, and the lamellar structure was totally destroyed during enzymatic hydrolysis. Compared to DSS-induced colitis mice, PSPRS administration significantly improved the pathological phenotype and colon inflammation in a dose-dependent manner. ELISA results indicated that DSS-induced colitis mice administered with PSPRS showed higher IL-10 and IgA levels but lower TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 levels. Meanwhile, high doses (300 mg/kg) of PSPRS significantly increased the production of acetate, propionate, and butyrate. 16S rDNA high-throughput sequencing results showed that the ratio of Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes and the potential probiotic bacteria levels were notably increased in the PSPRS treatment group, such as Lactobacillus, Alloprevotella, Lachnospiraceae_NK4A136_group, and Bifidobacterium. Simultaneously, harmful bacteria like Bacteroides, Staphylococcus, and Akkermansia were significantly inhibited by the administration of a high dose of PSPRS (p < 0.05). Therefore, PSPRS has the potential to be a functional food for promoting intestinal health and alleviating UC."

As a result of the characterization of the edible polymers, SHE was selected as the optimal coating material because it had the best moisture and light barrier properties. SHE coating successfully prevented the greening, respiration, and sprouting of potatoes caused by exposure to light and oxygen. Additionally, it reduced weight loss by inhibiting transpiration on the potato surface. While the SHE coating did not exhibit antimicrobial effects, a significant effect was observed when combined with UV-C irradiation. This study suggests the potential of combined treatment of SHE coating and UV-C irradiation in extending the postharvest quality of potatoes."

      "abstract": "(1) Background: Potato is the most important tuber crop in the world that can contribute to food security. However, the crop has been shown to be sensitive to drought and its yields decline significantly during successive periods of stress. Drought triggers a number of responses in potato, ranging from physiological changes to fluctuations in growth rates and yields. In light of global climate change, it is important to understand the effects of thiamethoxam on potato growth and yield under drought conditions. (2) Methods: The objective was to evaluate the impact of thiamethoxam on improving drought resistance and yield of potato under drought conditions. The drought-tolerant and sensitive-genotypes Qingshu No. 9 and Atlantic were used for a two-year pot experiment. Potato seeds were coated with 70% thiamethoxam before sowing (treatment group (T)), with a control group without treatment (NT). Two experimental treatments were applied: normal irrigation (ND) and drought stress (D). (3) Results: The results showed that root length, plant yield, chlorophyll content and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity significantly increased under both genotypes, while malondialdehyde (MDA) and proline (Pro) content were reduced under thiamethoxam under drought stress. The best indicators were obtained in the comprehensive evaluation for the T-D treatment, suggesting that the application of thiamethoxam under drought stress was more effective than normal irrigation. (4) Conclusions: Our results suggest that the application of thiamethoxam improves potato growth, thereby increasing drought tolerance and potato yield. However, thiamethoxam is a neonicotinoid pesticide, and the limitation of this study is that it did not explore the ecological effects of thiamethoxam, which need to be systematically studied in the future. Moreover, considering the potential risks of thiamethoxam to the environment, specific agronomic measures to effectively degrade thiamethoxam residue should be taken when it is applied in agricultural production."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Potatoes, a major economic crop, are significantly impacted by Fusarium dry rot, a prevalent postharvest disease. Despite the broad-spectrum antimicrobial properties of cinnamaldehyde, a naturally-derived plant substance, its efficacy against the causal pathogen of potato dry rot (Fusarium oxysporum) and the underlying mechanisms have not been extensively studied. RESULTS: Our study demonstrates that cinnamaldehyde effectively inhibits the growth of Fusarium oxysporum, the pathogen responsible for potato dry rot, and increases its sensitivity to environmental stress factors such as extreme temperatures and high salt stress. Treatment with cinnamaldehyde results in altered fungal mycelium morphology, compromised cell wall stability, and disrupted cell membrane integrity, thereby reducing spore viability. Specifically, it interferes with the cell membrane and cell wall structures of the fungus, potentially disrupting fungal growth by modulating signaling pathways involved in cell wall maintenance, chitin metabolism, and GPI-anchored protein function. Notably, we show that cinnamaldehyde induces a form of regulated cell death in F. oxysporum, which is characterized not as typical apoptosis, as evidenced by Annexin V negative staining. However, the specific cell death type and underlying mechanism still needed to be further explored. CONCLUSION: Cinnamaldehyde, an environmentally friendly plant-based active compound, exhibits strong inhibitory effects on F. oxysporum, indicating its potential use in the prevention and control strategies for potato dry rot. This research contributes to the understanding of novel antifungal mechanisms and offers promising insights into eco-friendly alternatives for managing this economically significant postharvest disease. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.",

Most of them were involved in different aspects of plant growth and development, while a small number of these peptides were reported to have antimicrobial activity or participate in abiotic stress tolerance. In potato, 18 Snakin/GASA genes were identified and classified into three groups based on phylogenetic analysis. Snakin-1 and Snakin-2 are members of subfamilies I and II, respectively, and were reported to be implicated not only in defense against pathogens but also in plant development. In this work, we present the first in-depth characterization of Snakin-3, a member of the subfamily III within the Snakin/GASA gene family of potato. Transient co-expression of Snakin-3 fused to the green fluorescent protein and organelle markers revealed that it is located in the endoplasmic reticulum. Furthermore, expression analyses via pSnakin-3::GUS transgenic plants showed GUS staining mainly in roots and vascular tissues of the stem. Moreover, GUS expression levels were increased after inoculation with Pseudomonas syringae pv. tabaci or Pectobacterium carotovorum subsp. carotovorum and also after auxin treatment mainly in roots and stems. To gain further insights into the function of Snakin-3 in planta, potato overexpressing lines were challenged against P. carotovorum subsp. carotovorum showing enhanced tolerance to this bacterial pathogen. In sum, here we report the first functional characterization of a Snakin/GASA gene from subfamily III in Solanaceae. Our findings provide experimental evidence on promoter activity and subcellular localization and reveal a role of potato Snakin-3 in plant defense.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Present study investigates the effects of different home pre-treatment processes and cooking techniques on the acrylamide content of fried potatoes. METHODS: Potato sticks were prepared in two different pre-treatment ways (washing and soaking) and cooked with three other techniques (air frying, deep frying, and oven frying). Acrylamide analyses were performed on cooked potatoes using an LC-MS/MS method. RESULTS: The highest acrylamide content was found in potatoes cooked using the air fryer (12.19 ± 7.03 μg/kg). This was followed by deep frying (8.94 ± 9.21 μg/kg) and oven frying (7.43 ± 3.75 μg/kg). However, the difference between the acrylamide contents of the potatoes according to the cooking methods was not statistically significant. The acrylamide content of the potatoes that were subjected to soaking in all three ways was lower than the potatoes that were not soaked and only washed. In the deep-frying method, it was found statistically significant that the soaked potatoes contained less acrylamide (p = 0.029). DISCUSSION: It is important to highlight the relatively low acrylamide levels found in oven-frying, lower than air frying in both washing and soaking groups in the present study. Although air fryers, which have become widely used as an alternative to deep frying in recent years, provide French fries with less oil, their role in the formation of acrylamide should be further investigated."

      "abstract": "During fresh-cut processing, potatoes lose their inherent protective cellular structure, leading to enzymatic browning that compromises sensory and edible quality. Tea polyphenols (TPs), natural preservatives with potent reducing properties, are hypothesized to impact this browning process. However, their influence and regulatory mechanism on the enzymatic browning of fresh-cut potatoes remain poorly understood. This study used the \"Holland Seven\" potato as the research material to explore the effects of a treatment with different TP concentrations (0.1 g L-1, 0.2 g L-1, and 0.3 g L-1) on the browning phenomenon and quality of fresh-cut potatoes during storage. The results showed that appropriate concentrations of TP treatment had a good preservation effect on the appearance and edible quality of fresh-cut potatoes. Furthermore, exogenous TP treatment reduced the content of enzymatic browning substrates (caffeic acid, p-coumaric acid, and ferulic acid) by regulating phenylpropanoid metabolism. Meanwhile, TP treatment augmented the activities of antioxidative enzymes (superoxide dismutase, catalase, ascorbate peroxidase, and glutathione reductase), maintained higher levels of ascorbic acid (Vc), and reduced glutathione (GSH). Consequently, the TP treatment could inhibit enzymatic browning by regulating reactive oxygen species (ROS) metabolism and the Vc-GSH cycle in fresh-cut potatoes."

      "abstract": "Fresh-cut potato browning is a severe problem in the potato processing industry. Ascorbic acid, L-cysteine, hydrogen sulfide (H2S), and nitric oxide (NO) have been reported to reduce the browning in fresh-cut vegetables and fruits. We compared the effect of each food additive at its commonly used concentration on fresh-cut potato browning in order to choose a highly efficient treatment and explore its mechanism. Fresh-cut potato slices were immersed in 0.3 mmol L-1 ascorbic acid, 0.7 mmol L-1 L-cysteine, 0.7 mmol L-1 H2S, or 2.0 mmol L-1 NO for 10 min and stored at 4°C until the measurements finished. Results showed that the ascorbic acid and L-cysteine treatments showed less browning than the control treatment, while the H2S and NO treatments did not. Ascorbic acid increased total phenolic content, polyphenol oxidase (PPO) and peroxidase (POD) activities, while L-cysteine decreased PPO and POD activities with no change in total phenolic content. In addition, these two treatments did not influence respiration rate, weight loss, or rot index. In conclusion, ascorbic acid (0.3 mmol L-1) and L-cysteine (0.7 mmol L-1) can be valuable means to control fresh-cut potato browning. Ascorbic acid inhibits the browning mainly by reducing quinones back to phenolic compounds, but L-cysteine inhibits the browning mainly by decreasing PPO and POD activities."

      "abstract": "Browning discoloration is a critical issue that negatively affects the quality of fresh-cut products and their industrial growth. Although many individual anti-browning technologies have been adopted, very few reports on the combination use of natural product extracts and physical methods exist. This study investigated the use of Flos Sophorae Immaturus extract in conjunction with thermal treatment and discovered that the combination effectively retarded browning in fresh-cut potatoes. Accordingly, the activities of polyphenol oxidase, peroxidase, and phenylalanine ammonia-lyase, as well as phenol accumulation, were effectively regulated. Meanwhile, this combination treatment also allowed for the modulation of nitric oxide synthase, superoxide dismutase, and catalase activities, while also regulating the concentrations of nitric oxide, superoxide anion, and hydrogen peroxide. Furthermore, the duplex treatment also regulated the antioxidant capacity and malondialdehyde concentrations. In addition, 39 phytoactive compounds, including protocatechuic acid, quercetin, (-)-alpha-pinene, and matrine, were identified in the extract, which may function as the anti-browning composition. These findings suggest that the combination technology modulated the dynamic equilibrium of production and clearance of nitric oxide and reactive oxygen species, thereby reducing browning deterioration. This is, to our knowledge, the first report of the combined application of Flos Sophorae Immaturus and thermal treatment, which may offer a novel option for fresh-cut preservation. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: The feasibility of integrating a novel highly efficient, safe, environmentally friendly, and easy-to-operate anti-browning alternative, with the ability to integrate into the existing processing line was investigated. The color of sliced potato chips was significantly improved (73.4%) by dipping them in a 0.01% Flos Sophorae Immaturus solution for 5 min and then in 55°C water for 2 min. In this regard, superior browning alleviation may depend on the regulation of the browning reaction and the NO-ROS network. This method has a promising future for making fresh-cut products more appealing to consumers and may provide guidance for fresh-cut producers and related industries.",

Different spectroscopic techniques, in conjunction with chemometrics, seem to have a considerable potential in direct analysis of raw plant material and foods, without any chemical treatment. RESULTS: Fluorescence spectroscopy and three vibrational spectroscopy techniques were applied to determine total polyphenol content, antioxidant activity and macronutrient levels in red- and purple-fleshed potato varieties. Excitation-emission matrix fluorescence, Fourier transform Raman, attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared and near-infrared spectra were recorded for the freeze-dried samples. Combining spectral data and the results of reference analyses, partial least squares regression models were constructed for each parameter studied. For polyphenols and antioxidant activity, quantification errors found for validation samples amounted to 3.74-5.04% and 4.75-6.35%, respectively, whereas macronutrient analysis gave errors in the 3.45-4.55%, 3.09-5.30% and 5.10-8.58% ranges for starch, protein and sugar determinations, respectively. CONCLUSION: The obtained results demonstrate that different spectroscopic techniques in combination with multivariate modeling allow simultaneous determination of various parameters of plant samples based on a single sample spectrum. They can effectively replace commonly used protocols of food product analysis requiring sample dissolving and extraction of the compounds of interest. © 2023 Society of Chemical Industry.",

Biodegradable mulch films with optimum degradation rates increase crop yield even compared to PE films. However, the mechanisms underlying this yield-increasing effect remains elusive. In this study, three biodegradable film treatments (BFM1, BFM2 and BFM3) and one PE film treatment (PFM) were used to evaluate their effects on soil and winter potatoes, and a partial least squares path model (PLS-PM) was constructed to investigate their relationships. The degradation rates of films under different treatments were ranked as BFM3 > BFM2 >BFM1 > PFM, and presented distinctive effects on soil properties and nutrients, structure of soil bacterial community, and yield traits of winter potatoes. The PLS-PM showed that mulch treatments affected potato yield through effects on soil properties (soil water and temperature) and soil nutrients (TOC, DOC, TN and NO3--N). The disintegration of the biodegradable films decreased soil water content and temperature, and reduced the loss of soil nutrients in the topsoil at the later growth stage of winter potatoes compared to PE films. Additionally, the elevated content of soil TN and NO3--N under treatment BFM1 may play a key role in its yield-increasing effect on potatoes compared to treatments PFM and BFM2. Thus, biodegradable mulch films with proper degradation rates regulate soil TN and NO3--N through their effects on soil water and temperature, and subsequently improve the yield of winter potatoes compared to PE mulch films.",

Prevention strategies demand integrated pest management, including modeling of beneficial microbiomes of agroecosystems combining microorganisms and natural products. Chitooligosaccharides and their derivatives have great potential to be used by agrotechnology due to their ability to elicit plant immune reactions. The effect of combining Bacillus subtilis 26D and 11VM and conjugates of chitin with hydroxycinnamates on late blight pathogenesis was evaluated. Mechanisms for increasing the resistance of potato plants to Phytophthora infestans were associated with the activation of the antioxidant system of plants and an increase in the level of gene transcripts that encode PR proteins: basic protective protein (PR-1), thaumatin-like protein (PR-5), protease inhibitor (PR-6), and peroxidase (PR-9). The revealed activation of the expression of marker genes of systemic acquired resistance and induced systemic resistance under the influence of the combined treatment of plants with B. subtilis and conjugates of chitin with hydroxycinnamates indicates that, in this case, the development of protective reactions in potato plants to late blight proceeds synergistically, where B. subtilis primes protective genes, and chitosan composites act as a trigger for their expression."

Treatment with 1,4-DMN reduced fresh weight loss and controlled the number and length of sprouts comparable to CIPC.

We have previously demonstrated that polyphenol extracts from Andean potato tubers exerted a dose-dependent cytotoxic effect in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells, being skin extracts more potent than flesh ones. In order to gain insight into the bioactivities of potato phenolics, we investigated the composition and the in vitro cytotoxic activity of total extracts and fractions of skin and flesh tubers of three Andean potato cultivars (Santa María, Waicha, and Moradita). Potato total extracts were subjected to liquid-liquid fractionation using ethyl acetate solvent in organic and aqueous fractions. We analyzed both fractions by HPLC-DAD, HPLC-ESI-MS/MS, and HPLC-HRMS. Results corroborated the expected composition of each fraction. Organic fractions were rich in hydroxycinnamic acids (principally chlorogenic acid isomers), whereas aqueous fractions contained mainly polyamines conjugated with phenolic acids, glycoalkaloids, and flavonoids. Aqueous fractions were cytotoxic against SH-SY5Y cells and even more potent than their respective total extracts. Treatment with a combination of both fractions showed a similar cytotoxic response to the corresponding extract. According to correlation studies, it is tempting to speculate that polyamines and glycoalkaloids are crucial in inducing cell death. Our findings indicate that the activity of Andean potato extracts is a combination of various compounds and contribute to the revalorization of potato as a functional food.",

      "abstract": "The current study investigates the feasibility of preparing Arabic bread from wheat flour, sweet potato flour, or peeled sweet potatoes based on the nutritional values, technological characteristics, and sensory properties of the final products. First, we analyzed the proximate, elemental, total and individual phytochemical compositions of the raw materials and bread samples. The analysis showed that potassium, calcium, and phosphorus were higher in peels than pulp, in the same manner to the total phenolics, flavonoids, and anti-radical scavenging activities. Phenolic acids and flavonols were quantified, where p-coumaric, feruloyl-D-glucose, eucomic, gallic, and ferulic acids were measured as major phenolic acids in either peels or pulp flours, and their quantities were higher in the peels. Furthermore, we evaluated the effects of wheat substitution on the properties of the dough blends and their final bakery. The results indicated that the fortified samples' nutritional and rheological properties were significantly improved, while their sensory qualities were comparable to those of the control. Thereby, the fortified dough blends presented higher dough stabilities, indicating a wider range of applications. Additionally, after the heat treatment, the fortified breads maintained significantly higher total phenolic, flavonoid, anthocyanin, and carotenoid contents, and total antioxidant activities, implying their accessibility for humans upon consumption."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Yellow-fleshed potatoes biofortified with iron have been developed through conventional breeding, but the bioavailability of iron is unknown. OBJECTIVES: Our objective was to measure iron absorption from an iron-biofortified yellow-fleshed potato clone in comparison with a nonbiofortified yellow-fleshed potato variety. METHODS: We conducted a single-blinded, randomized, crossover, multiple-meal intervention study. Women (n = 28; mean ± SD plasma ferritin 21.3 ± 3.3 μg/L) consumed 10 meals (460 g) of both potatoes, each meal extrinsically labeled with either 58Fe sulfate (biofortified) or 57Fe sulfate (nonfortified), on consecutive days. Iron absorption was estimated from iron isotopic composition in erythrocytes 14 d after administration of the final meal. RESULTS: Mean ± SD iron, phytic acid, and ascorbic acid concentrations in iron-biofortified and the nonfortified potato meals (mg/per 100 mg) were 0.63 ± 0.01 and 0.31 ± 0.01, 39.34 ± 3.04 and 3.10 ± 1.72, and 7.65 ± 0.34 and 3.74 ± 0.39, respectively (P < 0.01), whereas chlorogenic acid concentrations were 15.14 ± 1.72 and 22.52 ± 3.98, respectively (P < 0.05). Geometric mean (95% CI) fractional iron absorption from the iron-biofortified clone and the nonbiofortified variety were 12.1% (10.3%-14.2%) and 16.6% (14.0%-19.6%), respectively (P < 0.001). Total iron absorption from the iron-biofortified clone and the nonbiofortified variety were 0.35 mg (0.30-0.41 mg) and 0.24 mg (0.20-0.28 mg) per 460 g meal, respectively (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: TIA from iron-biofortified potato meals was 45.8% higher than that from nonbiofortified potato meals, suggesting that iron biofortification of potatoes through conventional breeding is a promising approach to improve iron intake in iron-deficient women.

METHODS: To investigate the phenotypic changes, physiological responses, and internal genes expression of potatoes under enhanced UV-B radiation, two Yunnan native pigmented potatoes varieties named \"Huaxinyangyu\" and \"Jianchuanhong\" were exposed to different UV-B doses during whole growth duration. RESULTS: Pearson correlation analysis and principal component analysis showed that the agronomic characters (i.e. plant height, pitch, stem diameter, and root shoot ratio) of plants treated with low dose ultraviolet (T1) did not change significantly compared with the absence of ultraviolet radiation (CK), even unit yield increased slightly; Similarly, under low UV-B radiation, photosynthetic and physiological parameters (photosynthetic rate, stomatal conductance, respiration rate, and transpiration rate) of leaves were significantly increased. In addition, low-dose UV-B treatment promoted the synthesis of tuber nutrients (e.g. phenols, chlorogenic acids, flavonoids, vitamin C, anthocyanins) and increased the expression of structural genes for anthocyanin synthesis. The number of nutrients and gene expression in tubers raised by the \"Huaxinyangyu\" was the highest at 84 days, and \"Jianchuanhong\" was the highest at 72 days. However, the higher dose of UV-B radiation (T2) will cause greater damage to the pigmented potatoes plants, making the plants reduce the yield, and significantly reduce the tuber nutrients. DISCUSSION: This study showed that proper ultraviolet radiation will not harm pigmented potatoes, but also improve their oxidative stress tolerance, increase the structure genes expression of anthocyanins and continuously synthesize beneficial substances to improve the yield and quality of potato tubers."

      "abstract": "RESEARCH BACKGROUND: Recently, natural plant extracts have been used to increase the nutritional value of food and to potentially reduce the absorbed fat and the formation of acrylamide in fried foods. Literature data on the use of edible polymers with nettle or olive leaf extracts are scarce. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: The effect of novel coatings on colour, fat absorption, phenolic and sugar content, and acrylamide formation in deep-fat-fried fresh-cut potatoes was evaluated. Extracts of olive and nettle leaves were incorporated in carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) and gum arabic, used as coatings for potatoes and applied before frying. This aimed to improve the nutritional quality of deep-fat-fried fresh-cut potatoes. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Enrichment of the edible coatings with extracts resulted in a significant change in the visible colour of the potatoes before frying. Significant effect of the extract amount on the sensory characteristics of potatoes was also observed. Most importantly, the perception of characteristic potato odour and taste was not significantly affected by the coating. Although higher amounts of the extract (1.5%) resulted in higher phenolic mass fraction in fried potatoes, the sensory scores decreased. After frying, fat mass fraction in the coated potatoes was reduced by about 15% compared to the uncoated samples. The type of extract affected the total sugar mass fraction in fried potatoes, which was lower in the samples with coatings enriched with olive leaf than in those with nettle leaf. Only gum arabic coating had a reducing effect on acrylamide mass fraction by 17%. Based on all the obtained results, CMC and gum arabic coatings did not influence sensory properties, so they can be recommended as carriers of functional compounds or as a frying pre-treatment for potatoes with favourable effect on fat and acrylamide content. NOVELTY AND SCIENTIFIC CONTRIBUTION: The knowledge obtained in this study can be exploited for preparation of coatings with functional compounds used as a pre-treatment for fried food with favourable effect on fat and acrylamide content."

      "abstract": "The European Commission requested the EFSA Panel on Plant Health to prepare and deliver a scientific opinion on the efficacy of a postharvest treatment aiming to eradicate all developmental stages of Guatemalan potato tuber moth Tecia solanivora (Lepidoptera: Gelechiidae) in ware potatoes. The Panel evaluated the scientific publication describing the elevated CO2 treatment, which was defined as: 10-day exposure to 30% CO2, 20% O2 and 50% N2 in controlled atmosphere at 17°C on the variety Negra Yema de Huevo (Papas Antiguas de Canarias, PDO potatoes, Solanum chaucha). In the scientific publication, the treatment was applied under semi-commercial and commercial conditions on artificially and field-infested tubers. The effect of the pest developmental stage on the treatment efficacy was investigated with artificial infestation of potato tubers with eggs, neonate and second instar larvae. Pupae and adults were placed in separate containers during the treatment. However, the third and fourth larval instars were not investigated. Further limitations were the sample size in the experiments, the mortality rate in the control group and the unknown level of infestation of the naturally infested potato tubers. It was not possible to evaluate the degree of pest freedom due to incomplete data on the conditions of production, i.e. the infestation level in the field. The Panel was able to conclude that although no surviving insects were observed in the performed experiments, the statistical evaluation of the presented results from the commercial trial indicate that it cannot be excluded that insects would survive the treatment. For example, based on the data provided the 95% confidence interval of the survival rate for eggs was: 0%-0.453%."

Although ultrasound (US) treatment is often used in the preservation of fresh-cut fruits and vegetables, it has limited antibacterial and preservative effects. Here, we used cactus polysaccharides (CP) to enhance the preservative effect of ultrasound treatment and extended the shelf life of fresh-cut potatoes. The results showed that combined treatment (CP + US) exerted better antimicrobial and anti-browning effects than individual treatments (either US or CP alone). In addition, CP + US has no adverse effect on texture and quality properties, as well as reduced the mobility of internal water. Combination treatment not only significantly decreased the activities of polyphenol oxidase and peroxidase (P < 0.05), but also maintained a high level of phenylalanine ammonia lyase activity and total phenol content during storage. It also maintained the integrity of cell membrane and reduced its permeability by inhibiting the peroxidation of membrane lipids. In addition, CP + US treatment significantly inhibited the activity of antioxidant enzymes and maintained a high DPPH scavenging ability. GC-IMS technology was used to evaluate the flavor of fresh-cut potatoes. The results showed that CP + US treatment reduced the production of a peculiar smell during storage and maintained a good flavor by inhibiting the production of aldehydes. Taken together, these results indicate that the effective preservation method of CP + US treatment can be utilized to increase the shelf life of fresh-cut potatoes.",

      "abstract": "Wireworms are primary pests of potatoes in Canada. Presently, the highly toxic organophosphate phorate (i.e., Thimet 20G) is the only effective insecticide in use in Canada. As such, there is an urgent need for novel alternative treatments that provide competitive tuber blemish protection and wireworm reduction with a safer human and environmental portfolio. Herein we evaluated broflanilide, a novel meta-diamide insecticide for both tuber protection and wireworm mortality. When evaluated in field trials in Agassiz, British Columbia over 6 yr, broflanilide applied as a seed piece treatment (SPT) to mother tubers at 1.5-2.0 g AI/100 kg seed (approx. 50 g AI/ha), or as an in-furrow spray (IFS) at 0.23-0.25 g AI/100 m row (approx. 25 g AI/ha) was as effective at reducing blemishes to daughter tubers by wireworms (Agriotes obscurus) as phorate (Thimet 20G at 3230 g AI/ha), bifenthrin (Capture 2EC IFS at 300 g AI/ha) and clothianidin (Titan ST at 312.5 g AI/ha). In addition, broflanilide SPT and IFS applied at the above rates reduced resident wireworms (in the field at the time of planting) by 95.4-99.0% and neonate wireworms (produced from eggs laid during the growing season) by 98.1-100%. Similar results were obtained when broflanilide IFS (nonsystemic) was paired with clothianidin SPT (systemic) for broad-spectrum potato insect pest control. Strategies for the use of broflanilide on wheat (e.g., Teraxxa F4) in rotation with potatoes (Cimegra), both registered in Canada in 2020 are discussed.",

      "abstract": "The in situ chemical immobilization method reduces the activity of heavy metals in soil by adding chemical amendments. It is widely used in farmland soil with moderate and mild heavy metal pollution due to its high efficiency and economy. However, the effects of different materials depend heavily on environmental factors such as soil texture, properties, and pollution levels. Under the influence of lead-zinc ore smelting and soil acidification, Cd is enriched and highly activated in the soils of northwestern Guizhou, China. Potato is an important economic crop in this region, and its absorption of Cd depends on the availability of Cd in the soil and the distribution of Cd within the plant. In this study, pot experiments were used to compare the effects of lime (LM), apatite (AP), calcite (CA), sepiolite (SP), bentonite (BN), and biochar (BC) on Cd accumulation in potatoes. The results showed that the application of LM (0.4%), AP (1.4%), and CA (0.4%) had a positive effect on soil pH and cations, and that they effectively reduced the availability of Cd in the soil. In contrast, the application of SP, BN, and BC had no significant effect on the soil properties and Cd availability. LM, AP, and CA treatment strongly reduced Cd accumulation in the potato tubers by controlling the total 'flux' of Cd into the potato plants. In contrast, the application of SP and BN promoted the migration of Cd from the root to the shoot, while the effect of BC varied by potato genotype. Overall, calcareous materials (LM, CA, and AP) were more applicable in the remediation of Cd-contaminated soils in the study area.",

A new type of safe, non-toxic, and edible antibacterial functional film was developed with sodium alginate (2.5 %), gum arabic (1 %), glycerol (2 %), and natamycin as an antimicrobial agent in this study. The physical and antibacterial properties of films, such as thickness, chromaticity, water vapor permeability, tensile strength, and elongation at break, were studied. Furthermore, the antibacterial film was applied in the preservation of sweet potatoes. The results showed that natamycin emulsion had good compatibility with sodium alginate. Besides reducing the transparency of the composite membrane, the mechanical properties, barrier properties, and thermal stability of the composite film were significantly enhanced by the addition of natamycin prepared by a pH-cycle method. When the concentration of natamycin in the membrane solution reached 40 μg/mL or more, the antibacterial film had a noticeable inhibitory effect on the growth of molds, and yeasts, significantly enhancing the bacteriostatic effect of the base film. During the sweet potatoes storage, the water content, total starch content, Vc content, and flavonoid glycoside content of sweet potato showed a downward trend. However, the treatment of antibacterial film containing natamycin could slow down the physiological and quality changes of sweet potatoes during conventional storage, and the sweet potatoes still had good processing quality after 120 days of storage.",

Consistent with potatoes being rich in micronutrients and resistant starch, we hypothesized that their inclusion in a Dietary Guidelines for Americans (DGA)-based dietary pattern would improve cardiometabolic and gut health in metabolic syndrome (MetS) persons. In a randomized cross-over trial, MetS persons (n = 27; 32.5 ± 1.3 year) consumed a DGA-based diet for 2 weeks containing potatoes (DGA + POTATO; 17.5 g/day resistant starch) or bagels (DGA + BAGEL; 0 g/day resistant starch) prior to completing oral glucose and gut permeability tests. Blood pressure, fasting glucose and insulin, and insulin resistance decreased (p < 0.05) from baseline regardless of treatment without any change in body mass. Oral glucose-induced changes in brachial artery flow-mediated dilation, nitric oxide homeostasis, and lipid peroxidation did not differ between treatment arms. Serum endotoxin AUC0−120 min and urinary lactulose/mannitol, but not urinary sucralose/erythritol, were lower in DGA + POTATO. Fecal microbiome showed limited between-treatment differences, but the proportion of acetate was higher in DGA + POTATO. Thus, short-term consumption of a DGA-based diet decreases cardiometabolic risk, and the incorporation of resistant starch-containing potatoes into a healthy diet reduces small intestinal permeability and postprandial endotoxemia.",

      "abstract": "Processing is one of the most crucial factors affecting polyphenol content in foods. Therefore, the study is aimed at the evaluation of heat treatment effects (microwaving, steaming, baking, and boiling) on the content of chlorogenic acids, total polyphenols, and antioxidant activity of three varieties of sweet potato with different flesh colors (Beauregard—orange-fleshed, O’Henry—white-fleshed, 414-purple—purple-fleshed). According to high performance liquid chromatography analysis, chlorogenic acid was the predominant chlorogenic acid in sweet potatoes. Obtained results also suggested the purple-fleshed variety (414-purple) had significantly (p < 0.05) higher total polyphenol content and thus the highest antioxidant activity. Heat treatment positively influenced the chlorogenic acid content, total polyphenols, and antioxidant activity of sweet potatoes. Among the used methods, steaming had the greatest effect on the chlorogenic acids and total polyphenols, while microwaved samples showed the highest antioxidant activity (DPPH). The content of chlorogenic acids and total polyphenols decreased in the order of steaming > baking > microwaving > boiling > raw. However, the individual varieties differed not only in the flesh color but also in the reaction to the used heat treatment methods. Spearman’s correlation coefficient showed a strong correlation between chlorogenic acid and antioxidant activity.",

      "abstract": "Polyphenol oxidase (PPO) inactivation in five whole and peeled Irish potato cultivars was investigated using high-pressure processing (HPP) at 400 MPa and 600 MPa for 3 min. PPO activity was significantly lower in most of the HPP-treated samples, while the highest PPO inactivation was observed after HPP at 600 MPa. No significant (p > 0.05) changes were observed on the total phenolic content and antioxidant activity of all the HPP-treated potatoes. Regarding individual phenolic acids, chlorogenic acid was decreased significantly (p < 0.05) in all studied varieties with a concomitant increase (p < 0.05) in caffeic and quinic acid. Similarly, ferulic acid was also increased (p < 0.05) in all studied varieties after the HPP treatment, while there was a variation in rutin and 4-coumaric acid levels depending on the cultivar and the sample type. Anthocyanins in the coloured whole potato varieties (i.e., Kerr's Pink and Rooster), tentatively identified as pelargonidin-O-ferulorylrutinoside-O-hexoside and pelargonidin-O-rutinoside-O-hexoside, also exhibited significantly (p < 0.05) higher levels in the HPP-treated samples as opposed to those untreated. Glycaemic indices of the potatoes treated with HPP did not differ with the corresponding untreated cultivars."

      "abstract": "Inhibiting sprouting of potatoes is an interesting subject needed for potato storage and industry. Sprouting degrades the quality of tuber along with releasing α-solanine and α-chaconine, which are harmful for health. Sprout suppressants, available in the market, are either costly or toxic to both health and environment. So, there is a need for developing countries to explore new sprouting suppressant compound which is cheap, non-toxic and reasonably efficient in comparison to commercial ones. We have established that simple maleic acid and L-tartaric acid are effective sprout suppressing agents. Both can hinder sprouting up to 6 weeks and 4 weeks post treatment respectively at room temperature in dark. These do not affect the quality parameters, retain the moisture content and maintain the stout appearance of the tubers along the total storage period. Thus maleic acid and L-tartaric acid would qualify as alternative, cheap, efficient sprout suppressant for potato storage and processing.",

      "abstract": "Purple potato is one of the least known and consumed potato varieties. It is as rich in nutrients, amino acids and starches as the rest of the potato varieties, but it also exhibits a high content of anthocyanins, which confer it with some attractive health-related properties, such as antioxidant, pain-relieving, anti-inflammatory and other promising properties regarding the treatment of certain diseases. A novel methodology based on ultrasound-assisted extraction has been optimized to achieve greater yields of anthocyanins. Optimal extraction values have been established at 70 °C using 20 mL of a 60% MeOH:H2O solution, with a pH of 2.90 and a 0.5 s-1 cycle length at 70% of the maximum amplitude for 15 min. The repeatability and intermediate precision of the extraction method have been proven by its relative standard deviation (RSD) below 5%. The method has been tested on Vitelotte, Double Fun, Highland and Violet Queen potatoes and has demonstrated its suitability for the extraction and quantification of the anthocyanins found in these potato varieties, which exhibit notable content differences. Finally, the antioxidant capacity of these potato varieties has been determined by means of 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DDPH) radical scavenging and the values obtained were similar to those previously reported in the literature."

The present study investigated the effect of a biodegradable nano-polymer urea formulation on soil enzymatic activities and microflora involved in the N cycling of potato (Solanum tuberosum L.). The nano-chitosan-urea composite (NCUC) treatment significantly increased the soil dehydrogenase activity, organic carbon content and available potassium compared to the conventional urea (CU) treatment. The soil ammonical nitrogen (NH4+-N) and nitrate nitrogen (NO3--N) contents and urease activity were significantly decreased in the NCUC-amended soil. The slow urea hydrolysis rate led to low concentrations of NH4+-N and NO3--N in the tested potato soil. Furthermore, these results corroborate the low count of ammonia oxidizer and nitrate reducer populations. Quantitative PCR (q-PCR) studies revealed that the relative abundance of eubacterial (AOB) and archaeal ammonia-oxidizing (AOA) populations was reduced in the NCUC-treated soil compared to CU. The abundance of AOA was particularly lower than AOB, probably due to the more neutral and alkaline conditions of the tested soil. Our results suggest that the biodegradable polymer urea composite had a significant effect on the microbiota associated with soil N dynamics. Therefore, the developed NCUC could be used as a slow N-release fertilizer for enhanced growth and crop yields of potato."

      "abstract": "High temperature (heat) stress reduces tuber yield and quality of potatoes. Screening potatoes for heat tolerance is increasingly important, considering the climate change scenario and expansion of potatoes to countries where heat stress is an issue. In vitro screening for tolerance to abiotic stresses offers several advantages, including quick evaluation of numerous genotypes (clones) in reduced space, controlled environmental conditions (temperature and photoperiod), and free from confounding variables inherent to greenhouse and field conditions. In this study, we explored the feasibility of using a temporary immersion bioreactor system for heat tolerance screening of potatoes. We determined the best hormone-free microtuberizing media for this system (MSG with 8% sucrose) to enhance microtuber number and size. Comparisons of microtubers produced at 30°C as heat treatment, with 16°C as normal condition, allowed to identify heat tolerant and susceptible potato clones. The use of bioreactors allowed distinguishing well-formed (non-deformed) from deformed microtubers. Heat stress increased the total biomass of plant tissues in all the clones. However, the effect of heat stress on microtuber number and weight varied among the clones. Incubation at 30°C decreased the weight and number of non-deformed microtubers in all the clones except for Reveille Russet in which the weight of non-deformed microtubers was significantly increased and the count of non-deformed microtubers was not affected. The potato variety Reveille Russet, which was selected under high-temperature field conditions in Texas, had many non-deformed microtubers per explant and the highest microtuber weight among four clones evaluated under heat stress. We described a faster and reliable in vitro microtuberization system for abiotic stress tolerance screening, identified Reveille Russet as a promising heat-tolerant potato variety, and confirmed Russet Burbank and Atlantic as susceptible heat-tolerant checks."

The four different formulations used were sodium alginate (F1), sodium alginate and potato starch (F2), zein and chitosan (F3), and chitosan, sodium alginate and potato starch (F4), in addition to the control treatment with distilled water. The treated samples were assessed periodically during six months of storage for changes in color, levels of reducing sugars, total phenolics and sensory qualities. The results indicated that the treatment with edible coatings significantly enhanced the chroma value of skin color, especially F1 and F2 formulations. However, these coatings instilled a limited effect on the level of reducing sugars. Moreover, F1 and F4 formulations exerted a significant effect (p < 0.05) on anthocyanin content examined after three months of storage. Alginate-based edible coatings significantly improved sensory evaluation, especially in terms of the color, gloss, and general acceptability of red skin potatoes."

      "abstract": "Surface browning is a vital phenomenon that adversely reduces the quality of fresh-cut potatoes. Although many anti-browning methods have been explored, it is unclear whether exogenous catalase (CAT) treatment influences the enzymatic browning. Our results showed that 0.05% CAT immersion for 5 min alleviated browning during cold storage (4°C, 8 days), which was accompanied by a higher lightness and lower redness; additionally, lower H2 O2 and O2 ·- contents were found. The activities of CAT, ascorbate peroxidase, and glutathione peroxidase and the scavenging efficiency of 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl were also increased. Moreover, CAT treatment inhibited the activities of polyphenol oxidase, peroxidase, and phenylalanine ammonia lyase and reduced phenol accumulation. Treatment with 0.1% hydrogen peroxide (H2 O2 ) achieved the opposite results. This is the first report of CAT application reducing fresh-cut potato browning, providing a safe treatment alternative for enzymatic discoloration and preliminarily revealing the underlying mechanism with insight into antioxidant regulation. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: This research is helpful for fresh-cut potato producers because a novel, safe, easy-to-carry out anti-browning solution was proposed. Dipping in 0.05% catalase solution for 5 min revealed color improvement in the quality of fresh-cut potato slices. The mechanism may rely on enhancing antioxidant ability (ascorbate peroxidase, and glutathione peroxidase, and 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl scavenging), reducing reactive oxygen species (H2 O2 , O2 ·-, malondialdehyde) and controlling enzymatic browning reaction factors (polyphenol oxidase, peroxidase, and phenylalanine ammonia lyase, and phenol accumulation). This method shows promise for better meeting the requirements and demands of consumers for fresh quality products.",

      "abstract": "Ulcerative colitis (UC), a major form of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), is on the rise worldwide. Approximately three million people suffer from IBD in the United States alone, but the current therapeutic options (e.g., corticosteroids) come with adverse side effects including reduced ability to fight infections. Thus, there is a critical need for developing effective, safe and evidence-based food products with anti-inflammatory activity. This study evaluated the antiinflammatory potential of purple-fleshed potato using a dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) murine model of colitis. Mice were randomly assigned to control (AIN-93G diet), P15 (15% purple-fleshed potato diet) and P25 (25% purple-fleshed potato diet) groups. Colitis was induced by 2% DSS administration in drinking water for six days. The results indicated that purple-fleshed potato supplementation suppressed the DSS-induced reduction in body weight and colon length as well as the increase in spleen and liver weights. P15 and P25 diets suppressed the elevation in the intestinal permeability, colonic MPO activity, mRNA expression and protein levels of pro-inflammatory interleukins IL-6 and IL-17, the relative abundance of specific pathogenic bacteria such as Enterobacteriaceae, Escherichia coli (E. coli) and pks+ E. coli, and the increased flagellin levels induced by DSS treatment. P25 alone suppressed the elevated systemic MPO levels in DSS-exposed mice, and elevated the relative abundance of Akkermansia muciniphila (A. muciniphila) as well as attenuated colonic mRNA expression level of IL-17 and the protein levels of IL-6 and IL-1β. Therefore, the purple-fleshed potato has the potential to aid in the amelioration of UC symptoms.",

Aqueous ClO2 treatment was significantly (p < 0.05) effective in reducing Salmonella with a reduction of 2.14 log CFU/cm2 within 20 min compared to 1.44 log CFU/cm2 for water treatment. Similar results were observed for L. monocytogenes with a 1.98 log CFU/cm2 reduction compared to 0.49 log CFU/cm2 reduction observed after 30 min treatment with aqueous ClO2 the water respectively. The maximum reduction in E. coli O157: H7 reached 2.1 Log CFU/cm2 after 20 min of treatment with aqueous ClO2. The level of the pathogens in ClO2 wash solutions, after the treatment, was below the detectable limit. While in the water wash solutions, the pathogens' populations ranged from 3.47 to 4.63 log CFU/mL. Our study indicates that aqueous ClO2 is highly effective in controlling cross-contamination during postharvest washing of sweet potatoes."

      "abstract": "EFSA received from the European Commission a mandate to deliver a reasoned opinion according to Article 43 of Regulation (EC) No 396/2005 on the safety of a proposed temporary maximum residue level (tMRL) for chlorpropham in potatoes to consumers. Sprout inhibitors based on the active substance chlorpropham have been widely used in commercial storage facilities in Europe over multiple seasons. Following the non-renewal of approval of chlorpropham, representatives of potato trade organisations and manufacturers of chlorpropham reported an issue of cross-contamination above the limit of quantification (LOQ) of untreated potatoes stored in facilities with a history of applications of chlorpropham as a post-harvest treatment. The evaluating Member State (EMS) the Netherlands, in accordance with Articles 6(2) and 16 (1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 396/2005, submitted an application for the setting of a tMRL for chlorpropham in potatoes in order to address the cross-contamination in commercial storages. The EMS proposed to set a tMRL for the active substance at a level ranging between 0.3 and 0.5 mg/kg. Based on the assessment of the available data and information with different methodologies, optional tMRL proposals of 0.3, 0.4 and 0.5 mg/kg were derived, and an indicative consumer risk assessment was carried out. The tMRL proposals require further consideration by risk managers, mainly with regard to identified uncertainties, and measures for further reduction of occurrence of chlorpropham residues will also need to be considered. With this prospect, EFSA concluded that the short-term and long-term intake of residues of chlorpropham and 3-chloroaniline resulting from cross-contamination in potatoes is unlikely to present a risk to consumer health."

Using a within-subject, repeated-measures design, 20 participants (age: 70.4 ± 0.6 y) completed, in random order, five treatment conditions: three potato treatments (baked potatoes, mashed potatoes, and French fries), an isocaloric control treatment (white bread), or a fasting condition (meal skipping). Subjective appetite and glycemic response were measured for 120 min using visual analogue scales and capillary blood samples, respectively. Lunch FI was measured with an ad libitum pizza meal at 120 min. Change from baseline subjective appetite (p < 0.001) and lunch FI (p < 0.001) were lower after all test treatments compared with meal skipping (p < 0.001), but did not differ among test treatments. Cumulative FI (test treatment + lunch FI) did not differ among treatment conditions. Blood glucose concentrations were higher after all test treatments compared with meal skipping (p < 0.001), but were not different from each other. In healthy older adults, white potatoes suppressed subjective appetite and lunch FI compared with meal skipping, suggesting white potatoes do not bypass regulatory control mechanisms of FI.",

      "abstract": "The anti-obesity effects of anthocyanin and carotenoid extracts from color-fleshed potatoes were studied with 3T3-L1 cells in vitro and high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obese mice in vivo. Treatment of 3T3-L1 adipocytes with anthocyanin and carotenoid extracts, respectively, after differentiation induction significantly inhibited fat accumulation by 63.1 and 83.5%. Studies of adipogenesis inhibition showed that the anthocyanin extract acts at intermediate stages, whereas the carotenoid extract influences all the stages. The extracts significantly diminished triglyceride (TG) content and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) protein expression during adipogenesis of the intermediate stage. Oral administration of anthocyanin and carotenoid extracts, respectively, to HFD-fed mice significantly reduced weight gain and restored TG levels to normal or lower as compared to the HFD-fed group with improvement of a lipid profile, TG to HDL-C ratio. Histological differences in liver tissues revealed that the extracts protected the liver tissue from adipogenesis by HFD fed. This research presents the first direct demonstration that the two pigment extracts from sweet potato exhibit anti-obesity activities. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Anthocyanins and carotenoids are the main pigments of purple- and orange-fleshed sweet potatoes, respectively, which are highly nutritious foods with antidiabetic and antioxidant properties. Obesity is a rapidly growing health problem that increases major risk factors of several serious diseases including cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and cancer. The results of this research suggest that anthocyanin and carotenoid-rich extracts from color-fleshed sweet potatoes may be useful as supplementary ingredients for the treatment of obesity and related diseases."

The aim of this study was to investigate the acute and sub-acute toxicity of tocosh flour (TF). For sub-acute toxicity, TF was administered orally to rats daily once a day for 28 days at doses of 1000 mg/kg body weight (BW). Animals were observed for general behaviors, mortality, body weight variations, and histological analysis. At the end of treatment, relative organ weights, histopathology, hematological and biochemical parameters were analyzed. For acute toxicity, TF was administered orally to mice at doses of 2000 and 5000 mg/kg BW at a single dose in both sexes. Body weight, mortality, and clinical signs were observed for 14 days after treatment. The results of acute toxicity showed that the median lethal dose (LD50) value of TF is higher than 2000 g/kg BW but less than 5000 mg/Kg BW in mice. Death and toxicological symptoms were not found during the treatment. For sub-acute toxicity, we found that no-observed-adverse-effect levels (NOAEL) of TF in rats up to 1000 g/kg BW. There were statistically significant differences in body weight, and relative organ weight in the stomach and brain. No differences in hematological and biochemical parameters were observed when compared with the control group. For sub-acute toxicity, histopathological studies revealed minor abnormalities in liver and kidney tissues at doses of 5000 mg/Kg. Based on these results, TF is a traditional Peruvian medicine with high safety at up to 1000 mg/kg BW for 28 days in rats."

The urine metabolome was acquired by LC-MS-based untargeted metabolomics. Twenty-two selected metabolites were found for deep-fried potatoes, two for potato intake in general, and one for boiled rice. Fourteen of the 22 selected metabolites were tentatively identified as furan-, pyrrole- and pyrazine-derived compounds indicative of Maillard reactions.

      "abstract": "Chlorpropham is a widely used sprouting inhibitor applied on potatoes during their storage. Currently, severe concerns are raised regarding the potential formation of 3-chloroaniline from chlorpropham during heat treatment. The reactions degrading the molecule in the matrix are quite complex under harsh processing conditions, and a molecular investigation is thus challenging. This study aims to decipher the reaction pathways and to discover new metabolites in typical high-temperature food-processing steps. For this purpose, potatoes were treated with 14C-radiolabeled chlorpropham, stored for up to 6 months, and subjected to the traditional preparation steps of boiling, frying, and baking. A quantification method including an acidic hydrolysis was developed for analysis of free and bound analytes. All conducted processing steps led to a substantial mitigation of chlorpropham residues in the consumable products. Of the residues, 17 ± 6% remained in boiled tubers, while 27 ± 3 and 22 ± 3% remained in the fried and baked products, respectively. Chlorpropham was transferred into the surrounding media (boiling water, frying oil, and air, respectively). 3-Chloroaniline was only (raw tubers) or predominantly (processed tubers) present as a bound analyte and was shown to form during storage but not during processing. Additionally, nonextractable and nonquantified residues were detected in the baked and in the long-term-stored tubers after processing. Future studies will have to balance beneficial (mitigating) and potentially hazardous aspects of these results. By transferring the 14C-food-processing approach to a variety of substances, ingredients, and processes, it will be possible to further understand chemical reactions in food processing, finally leading to safer food.",

Two haplotypes of Lso-A and B-occur in the United States. Lso haplotype B is more virulent than haplotype A, causing greater disease incidence in tubers, more severe symptoms, and greater loss in tuber yield. This study assessed whether tubers from infected plants generate new infected plants the following year. The effects of both Lso haplotypes A and B on tuber resprout were examined on five potato cultivars. When compared with noninfected tubers, overall plant emergence rate from Lso A- or B-infected tubers was lower, plants emerged slower, and plants generated lower daughter tuber yields in weight and quantity. Plants generally emerged poorly from Lso B-infected tubers and produced lower daughter tuber yields than Lso A-infected tubers. Regardless of Lso treatment, all daughter tubers were asymptomatic, and only 0.3% tested positive for Lso in experiments conducted over 2 years. This suggests that plants generated from Lso A- and Lso B-infected seed potatoes with severe ZC symptoms are likely not a significant source of Lso in potato fields.",

To fight against this phenomenon, several treatment methods have been developed, such as bleaching. This led us to investigate the effect of bleaching on the physico-chemical, functional and rheological properties of three irish potato varieties. To achieve our objective, blanched and unbleached irish potatoes flours of three varieties (Cipira, Dosa and Pamela) were produced. The physico-chemical, functional and rheological aspects of the flours were then studied according to standard and developped methods. It appears from this study that treatment and variety significantly influenced (P < 0.05) the nutritional composition of irish potatoes flours. The physical properties with the exception of titratable acidity were affected (P < 0.05) by the treatment and the varieties. Analysis of the functional properties revealed that unbleached flours had a higher swelling rate and water retention capacity than bleached flours. Rheological properties, such as final viscosity, are influenced by the treatment and variety. The main component analysis showed that bleaching affects the properties of the varieties Pamela and Cipira. In view of all this, we can therefore highlight the applicability of each of the flours in a specific industrial field."

The enrichment of minimally processed potatoes with aromatic compounds could represent an interesting method for product innovation. This study was aimed at applying VI with rosemary essential oil on a minimally processed potato product in order to obtain an innovative fresh-cut potato product, and to evaluate its influence on the physico-chemical, sensorial and microbiological properties of potato sticks during refrigerated storage and after frying. A pressure of 60 mbar was applied for 30 min followed by a relaxation time at atmospheric pressure of 30 min to potato sticks immersed in rosemary oil solutions in concentration between 0 and 12%. Prepared samples were packed and stored at 4 °C for 14 days. Analytical determinations were carried out on the fresh and fried product. The weight gain of potatoes promoted by VI was in the range of 6-14%, depending on the concentration of rosemary essential oil. The rosemary essential oil concentration gradients of impregnated potato sticks were detected by GC analysis and sensorial test, evidencing their persistency during storage and after frying. The treatment seemed to improve microbiological stability, not affecting the texture, moisture, but slightly deteriorating the product color. Results obtained in the present study confirm the potentiality of VI for fresh products innovation."

      "abstract": "Potatoes, as a prominent staple food, have exerted diverse intestinal health benefits, but few studies have addressed the gut microecology modulatory effects of consuming potatoes in realistic quantities. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of ingesting potatoes in different doses on body weight gain (BWG), food intake, short chain fatty acids (SCFAs), fecal microbiota, gut hormones, and colon morphology of healthy rats. Male Sprague-Dawley rats of 6-8 weeks old were randomized to five groups and fed AIN-93 G or diets containing graded concentrations of potato powder (low, medium, high, and higher) for 7 weeks. Accordingly, the final body weight was significantly lower for rats fed the high and/or higher potato diets than their control counterparts (P < 0.05). Potato intervention caused a significant dose-dependent increment in full cecum, and SCFAs production. The relative abundance of \"S24-7\" (order Bacteroidales), Bifidobacterium, \"NK3B31\" (family Prevotellaceae), Parasutterella, and Ruminococcus_1 increased in high and higher potato diets. Furthermore, a Spearman's correlation analysis revealed that Parasutterella was negatively correlated with BWG, triglyceride (TG), and low-density lipoproteins (LDL). The maximum number of goblet cells, longest crypt depth, and highest level of PYY were found in the distal colon of rats fed higher potato diets. The results suggested that potato powder could provide the potential for hopeful impact on weight control."

The results indicated that the freezing effects of multi-frequency ultrasound was better than those of single-frequency ultrasound. Multi-frequency ultrasound could significantly increase the freezing rate and preserve the quality of frozen samples better. With increase in the number of ultrasonic frequencies, the freezing effect was more obvious. In addition, scan electron microscopy (SEM) images showed that the ice crystals formed by the multi-frequency ultrasonic treatment were fine and uniformly distributed, which caused less damage to the frozen potato samples. From the analysis of the quality attributes, the nutritional values of the samples after multi-frequency ultrasonic treatment was higher, but attention should be paid to the negative influence of the hydroxyl radical generated by the multi-frequency ultrasound.",

      "abstract": "The study aims to determine drying of sweet potatoes using multifrequency ultrasound (US) pretreatments (20, 40, and 60 kHz) at three different infrared (IR) drying temperatures (60, 70, and 80°C) and evaluate the phytochemical and textural quality of the dried product. Drying time was significantly decreased in moderate US frequency (40 kHz) at 70°C with the increasing drying temperature. Comparing to the fresh samples, the dried samples showed the highest amount of phytochemical contents. The antioxidant activity of the samples increased especially at 60 kHz and 80°C, while US-IR treatments shown a positive impact on total carotenoids contents and β-carotene. For phenolic compounds, Ellagic acid and Rutin were quantified in higher amount while Quercetin-3-rhamnoside and Quercetin 3-β-D-glucoside were two new compounds identified for the first time in sweet potatoes. FTIR spectra showed the successful synthesis of OH group and phenolics in samples treated with the US at 20 kHz. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: This study investigated the effects of multifrequency ultrasound with different infrared drying temperatures. The study provides evidence that infrared drying application in synergy with ultrasonic pretreatments can improve drying efficiency and food quality much better than using each method alone. Total phenolic contents and total flavonoid contents remained stable at US 40 kHz and 60°C conditions. The findings showed that moderate ultrasound frequency (40 kHz) at 60°C improved phytochemical properties while antioxidant activities showed better preservation response at 80°C with 60 kHz. In addition, the samples treated with the same US treatment at 40 kHz showed less cell breakage in SEM analysis.",

      "abstract": "Objective: Short-term studies in adults have shown that white potatoes increase satiety and suppress food intake (FI) compared with several other carbohydrate-containing foods; however, studies are limited in children. The objective was to compare the effects of white potatoes in mixed meals on satiety, FI, and glycemic response in 9-14-year-old children and adolescents.Methods: Using a within-subject, repeated-measures design, 21 children completed five counter-balanced test sessions. After an overnight fast, children consumed one of four isocaloric treatment meals (450 kcal) of French fries, mashed potatoes, or white beans served with a fixed portion of egg omelet (30 g of protein), a control meal with cereal, milk, and bread, or continued to fast (i.e., meal skipping). Subjective appetite was measured using visual analogue scales. FI at an ad libitum pizza meal at 180 min and rest of day diet record were used to measure lunch FI and rest of day energy intake, respectively. Total daily energy intake was calculated by adding the energy intake from the treatment meal, the ad libitum pizza lunch, and rest of day food record. Capillary blood samples were collected to assess glycemic response over 180 min.Results: Change from baseline subjective average appetite scores were lower after mashed potatoes compared with all other treatment conditions (p < 0.001), and higher after French fries compared with white beans (p = 0.04). Lunch FI (kcal) was significantly lower (p < 0.001) after French fries (1010±73) and mashed potatoes (1039±74) compared with the control meal (1257±92) and meal skipping (1235±74). Total daily energy intake (kcal) was lower after French fries compared with the control meal (2228±141 vs. 2624±137; p = 0.04). Change from baseline blood glucose was lower after white beans and French fries compared with mashed potatoes (p < 0.05) and the control meal (p < 0.001).Conclusion: In conclusion, white potatoes with eggs increased satiety, decreased short-term FI, and resulted in similar energy intakes compared with meal skipping.",

      "abstract": "Dietary carbohydrates have been shown to influence cognitive performance and satiety in children. However, it remains unclear whether the carbohydrate source is a primary determinant of cognitive performance and satiety. The objective was to compare the effects of white potatoes and other carbohydrate-containing foods on cognitive performance, glycemic response, and satiety in children. On 6 separate mornings, in random order, children (n = 22) consumed 50 g of available carbohydrates from microwaved mashed potatoes (prepared from fresh potatoes then frozen), deep-fried potato strips (French fries), hash browns, white rice, white beans, or skipped a meal. Cognitive performance, glycemic response, and satiety were measured over 180 min. Cognitive performance was measured using a battery of tests assessing verbal declarative memory, spatial memory, short-term memory, working memory, and information processing speed. Although cognitive performance after the treatment meals did not differ from meal skipping, children recalled more words after French fries (9.1 ± 0.4 words) compared with mashed potatoes (8.2 ± 0.3 words; p = 0.001) and white rice (8.4 ± 0.3 words; p = 0.04) on the verbal declarative memory test. Blood glucose concentrations were higher after white rice compared with white beans, mashed potatoes, and hash browns (p < 0.05). Change from baseline subjective average appetite (mm/kcal) was lower after mashed potatoes compared with all other treatment meals (p < 0.05). In conclusion, verbal declarative memory was higher after French fries and subjective average appetite was lower after mashed potatoes. Future longitudinal studies are needed to confirm these short-term findings and to elucidate the mechanism of action.",

      "abstract": "Potato tubers (Solanum tuberosum L.) are usually stored at low temperature, which can suppress sprouting and control the occurrence of diseases. However, low temperatures lead potatoes to easily suffer from cold-induced sweetening (CIS), which has a negative effect on food processing. The aim of this research was to investigate potential treatments on controlling CIS in potatoes during postharvest storage. \"Atlantic\" potatoes were treated with gibberellin and (S)-carvone, respectively, and stored at 4 °C for 90 days. The results showed that gibberellin can significantly accelerate sprouting and sugar accumulation by regulating expressions of ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase (AGPase), granule-bound starch synthase (GBSS), β-amylase (BAM1/2), UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase (UGPase) and invertase inhibitor (INH1/2) genes. The opposite effects were found in the (S)-carvone treatment group, where CIS was inhibited by modulation of the expressions of GBSS and INH1/2 genes. In summary, gibberellin treatment can promote sugar accumulation while (S)-carvone treatment has some effects on alleviating sugar accumulation. Thus, (S)-carvone can be considered as a potential inhibitor of some of the sugars which are vital in controlling CIS in potatoes. However, the chemical concentration, treatment time, and also the treatment method needs to be optimized before industrial application.",

It is important to justify the identification of the most suitable isolation medium of starch from different colored root tubers. In this study, starches were isolated from root tubers of purple, yellow and white sweet potatoes using four different extraction media, including H₂O, 0.5% Na₂S₂O₅, 0.2% NaOH, and both 0.5% Na₂S₂O₅ and 0.2% NaOH. Their structural and functional properties were investigated and compared among different extraction media. The results showed that the granule size, apparent amylose content, lamellar peak intensity, thermal properties, and pasting properties were different among different-colored sweet potatoes due to their different genotype backgrounds. The four extraction media had no significant effects on starch structural properties, including apparent amylose content, crystalline structure, ordered degree, and lamellar peak intensity, except that the NaOH and Na₂S₂O₅ treatment were able to increase the whiteness of purple and yellow sweet potato starches. The different extraction media had some effects on starch functional properties, including thermal properties, swelling power, water solubility, and pasting properties. The above results indicated that the H₂O was the most suitable extraction medium to simply and fast isolate starch from root tubers of different-colored sweet potatoes.",

Four pigments, namely, Petunin, Paeonin, Malvidin and Pelargonidin, were extracted from potatoes by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Our results showed that the cellular morphology and cell viability were significantly altered in gastric mucosal epithelial cells (GES-1) treated with different hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) concentrations over time (P < 0.05). Paeonin presented the strongest anti-oxidative effects on H2O2-treated cells, in both a dose- and time-dependent manner, determined by ARE-luciferase activity and HO-1 mRNA expression. After pre-treatment with Paeonin in H2O2-exposed cells, Keap1, Nrf2, HO-1 and NQO1 protein expressions were remarkably up-regulated. Furthermore, immunostaining of Nrf2 expression was obviously elevated in the H2O2 + Paeonin group over time. The GSH content in the H2O2 + Paeonin group was notably lower than that in the H2O2 + Paeonin + GSK690693 group. Paeonin promoted cell cycle with augmented Cyclin D1 and p27 protein expressions. Moreover, Paeonin suppressed apoptosis with increased Bcl2, total Caspase3 and total Caspase8 protein expressions and decreased Bax, p-Caspase3 and p-Caspase8 protein expression in H2O2-treated cells. These results suggested that Paeonin might exert an anti-oxidative role by activating Nrf2 signaling pathway with the changes of cell cycle and apoptosis.",

      "abstract": "Black rot caused by Ceratocystis fimbriata is the most damaging postharvest disease among sweet potatoes. Black rot can be controlled by synthetic fungicides, but these synthetic fungicides also have several negative effects. Perillaldehyde (PAE), a major component of the herb perilla, is an effective and eco-friendly method of controlling this disease. The antifungal activity of PAE on the mycelial growth in C. fimbriata was evaluated in vitro. Sweet potatoes at the postharvest stage were surfaced-disinfected with 75% ethanol. Artificially created wounds were inoculated with a C. fimbriata cell suspension, and then, the PAE was spontaneously volatilized inside the residual airspace of the containers at 28°C. Samples were collected at 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, and 21 days from each group, and the tissues around the wounds of the sweet potatoes were collected using a sterilized knife and then homogenized to determine their defense-related enzyme activity and quality parameters. In vitro assays showed that the mycelial growth of C. fimbriata was inhibited by PAE in a dose-dependent manner. An in vivo test demonstrated that 25, 50, and 100 μl/l PAE doses, when applied to sweet potatoes inoculated with C. fimbriata, could remarkable lower lesion diameter as compared to the control. Even though the storage time was prolonged, PAE vapor treatment still drastically inhibited sweet potato decay during storage at 28°C. These PAE vapor treatments also enhanced the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), ascorbate peroxidase (APX), peroxidase (POD), polyphenol oxidase (PPO), and phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL). These treatments remarkably decreased weight loss rates and had minor effects on other fruit quality parameters, such as anthocyanin content and vitamin C content. In our study, the results suggested that the effects of PAE on postharvest sweet potatoes may be attributed to the maintenance of enzymatic activity and fruit quality. In sum, PAE may be a promising approach to controlling C. fimbriata in sweet potatoes."

      "abstract": "Potatoes are generally regarded as high glycemic index (GI) foods. Resistant starch (RS) comprises the starch fraction that is not absorbed in the small intestine, thus controlling the glucose level and improving the intestinal environment. In this study, an analysis of the formation of RS of potato starch samples under different acetic acid-thermal treatment conditions was conducted. Additionally, the relationship between the rates of starch digestion, estimated GI (eGI), and the RS content was evaluated by employing in vitro enzymatic models. Compared with control samples, the RS content in the cold-stored samples after acid-boiling was higher, whereas that of samples after heating at 120 °C with acetic acid was decreased. The eGI was negatively correlated with the RS content in potatoes. Cold store after acid-boiling was effective in increasing the RS content. Furthermore, low eGI values may have resulted from higher levels of RS in potatoes."

      "abstract": "Elicitation of plant defense signaling that results in altered emission of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) offers opportunities for protecting plants against arthropod pests. In this study, we treated potato, Solanum tuberosum L., with the plant defense elicitor cis-jasmone (CJ), which induces the emission of defense VOCs and thus affects the behavior of herbivores. Using chemical analysis, electrophysiological and behavioral assays with the potato-feeding aphid Macrosiphum euphorbiae, we showed that CJ treatment substantially increased the emission of defense VOCs from potatoes compared to no treatment. Coupled GC-electroantennogram (GC-EAG) recordings from the antennae of M. euphorbiae showed robust responses to 14 compounds present in induced VOCs, suggesting their behavioral role in potato/aphid interactions. Plants treated with CJ and then challenged with M. euphorbiae were most repellent to alate M. euphorbiae. Principal component analysis (PCA) of VOC collections suggested that (E)-2-hexenal, (E,E)-4,8,12-trimethyl-1,3,7,11-tridecatetraene (TMTT), (E)-β-farnesene, (E)-4,8-dimethyl-1,3,7-nonatriene (DMNT), methyl salicylate (MeSA), CJ, and methyl benzoate (MeBA) were the main VOCs contributing to aphid behavioral responses, and that production of TMTT, (E)-β-farnesene, CJ, and DMNT correlated most strongly with aphid repellency. Our findings confirm that CJ can enhance potato defense against aphids by inducing production of VOCs involved in aphid-induced signalling.",

      "abstract": "This work provides an evaluation of an ultrasound-assisted, combined extraction, centrifugation and ultrafiltration process for the optimal recovery of polyphenols. A purple sweet potato (PSP) extract has been obtained using ultrasonic circulating extraction equipment at a power of 840 W, a frequency of 59 kHz and using water as solvent. Extract ultrafiltration, using polyethersulfone (PES), was carried out for the recovery of polyphenol, protein and anthocyanin. Pre-treatment, via the centrifugation of purple sweet potato extract at 2500 rpm over 6 min, led to better polyphenol recovery, with satisfactory protein removal (reused for future purposes), than PSP extract filtration without centrifugation. Results showed that anthocyanin was efficiently recovered (99%) from permeate. The exponential model fit well with the experimental ultrafiltration data and led to the calculation of the membrane's fouling coefficient. The optimization of centrifugation conditions showed that, at a centrifugation speed of 4000 rpm (1195× g) and duration of 7.74 min, the optimized polyphenol recovery and fouling coefficient were 34.5% and 29.5 m-1, respectively. The removal of proteins in the centrifugation process means that most of the anthocyanin content (90%) remained after filtration. No significant differences in the intensities of the HPLC-DAD-ESI-MS² peaks were found in the samples taken before and after centrifugation for the main anthocyanins; peonidin-3-feruloylsophoroside-5-glucoside, peonidin-3-caffeoyl-p-hydroxybenzoylsophoroside-5-glucoside, and peonidin-3-caffeoyl-feruloyl sophoroside-5-glucoside. This proves that centrifugation is an efficient method for protein removal without anthocyanin loss. This study considers this process an ultrasound-assisted extraction-centrifugation-ultrafiltration for purple sweet potato valorization in \"green\" technology.",

OBJECTIVE: We conducted a systematic review to evaluate the relation between intake of potatoes and risks of obesity, T2D, and CVD in apparently healthy adults. DESIGN: MEDLINE, Embase, the Web of Science, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched for intervention and prospective observational studies that investigated adults without any known illnesses at baseline, recorded intake of potatoes, and measured adiposity (body weight, body mass index, or waist circumference), cases of T2D, cases of cardiovascular events, or risk markers thereof. RESULTS: In total, 13 studies were deemed eligible; 5 studies were related to obesity, 7 studies were related to T2D, and one study was related to CVD. Only observational studies were identified; there were 3 studies with moderate, 9 studies with serious, and one study with critical risk of bias. The association between potatoes (not including french fries) and adiposity was neutral in 2 studies and was positive in 2 studies. French fries were positively associated with adiposity in 3 of 3 studies. For T2D, 2 studies showed a positive association, whereas 5 studies showed no or a negative association with intake of potatoes and T2D. French fries were positively associated with T2D in 3 of 3 studies that distinguished this relation. For CVD, no association was observed. CONCLUSIONS: The identified studies do not provide convincing evidence to suggest an association between intake of potatoes and risks of obesity, T2D, or CVD. French fries may be associated with increased risks of obesity and T2D although confounding may be present. In this systematic review, only observational studies were identified. These findings underline the need for long-term randomized controlled trials. This trial was registered at the PROSPERO International prospective register of systematic reviews (www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO/) as CRD42015026491.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The bioavailability of potassium should be considered in setting requirements, but to our knowledge, the bioavailability from individual foods has not been determined. Potatoes provide 19-20% of potassium in the American diet. OBJECTIVE: We compared the bioavailability and dose response of potassium from nonfried white potatoes with skin [targeted at 20, 40, and 60 milliequivalents (mEq) K] and French fries (40 mEq K) with potassium gluconate at the same doses when added to a basal diet that contained ∼60 mEq K. DESIGN: Thirty-five healthy, normotensive men and women with a mean ± SD age of 29.7 ± 11.2 y and body mass index (in kg/m(2)) of 24.3 ± 4.4 were enrolled in a single-blind, crossover, randomized controlled trial. Participants were partially randomly assigned to the order of testing for nine 5-d interventions of additional potassium as follows: 0 (control; repeated at phases 1 and 5), 20, 40, and 60 mEq K/d consumed as a potassium gluconate supplement or as unfried potato or 40 mEq K from French fries completed at phase 9. The bioavailability of potassium was determined from the area under the curve (AUC) of serial blood draws and cumulative urinary excretion during a 24-h period and from a kinetic analysis. The effects of the potassium source and dose on the change in blood pressure and augmentation index (AIx) were determined. RESULTS: The serum potassium AUC increased with the dose (P < 0.0001) and did not differ because of the source (P = 0.53). Cumulative 24-h urinary potassium also increased with the dose (P < 0.0001) and was greater with the potato than with the supplement (P < 0.0001). The kinetic analysis showed the absorption efficiency was high across all interventions (>94% ± 12%). There were no significant differences in the change in blood pressure or AIx with the treatment source or dose. CONCLUSIONS: The bioavailability of potassium is as high from potatoes as from potassium gluconate supplements. Future studies that measure the effect of dietary potassium on blood pressure will need to evaluate the effect of various dietary sources on potassium retention and in both normal and hypertensive populations. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT01881295.",

We first showed that 63.7% (for the genotype CIP_311422.016) to 79.0% (for the genotype CIP_311575.003) of the iron is released from the potato tuber matrix during in vitro gastrointestinal digestion and is therefore available at the intestinal level. On average, 32 and 24.5% of the hydrophilic bioactive components, vitamin C and chlorogenic acid, respectively, were also bioaccessible from boiled tubers. Intestinal absorption of intrinsic iron from potato tubers could not be detected using our in vitro Caco-2 cell model. When an extrinsic source of iron (20 μM FeCl3 and 1 mM ascorbic acid) was added to the digestion mixture, iron absorption varied from 1.8 to 8% for the genotypes CIP_311422.016 and CIP_311624.021, respectively, as compared to the reference control. Principal component analysis revealed negative relationships between bioavailable iron values and phenolic concentrations, whereas vitamin C concentrations were positively associated with the ferritin values. Further controlled intervention trials would be needed to conclusively assess the bioavailability of intrinsic iron from potato tubers.",

Because 49.92 ~ 92.43% of total sugars were sucrose, sucrose was the major sugar composition of fresh sweet potatoes. After the baking treatment, the total sugar content of baked sweet potatoes was dramatically increased due to the formation of maltose. The maltose content significantly increased from 0 ~ 0.39% to 8.81 ~ 13.97% on dry weight basis. Therefore, maltose should be included in calculating the total sugar content. Electronic micrographs of fresh sweet potato samples showed that the size of starch granules was generally less than 20 μm. After the baking treatment, starch granules completely gelatinized."

A factorial experiment was done, based on a Randomized Complete Block Design with four replications. The 100 Gy radiation treatments on 10th and 30th days after harvest completely prevented sprouting at both varieties studied but on 50th day only Agria tubers not sprouted. This study indicated that early irradiation and absorbed radiation doses significantly decreased sprouting, percent weight loss and specific gravity of tubers. Reducing sugar content significantly increased by delay in irradiation and lower dose of radiation while non-reducing sugars did not decrease significantly by delay in irradiation and higher dose of radiation. The least increase in reducing sugars (10.2%) and most decrease in non-reducing sugar (-12.75%) were observed in tubers that irradiated on 10th day after harvest. The content of ascorbic acid was decreased by irradiation with higher dose. Although delay in irradiation caused less loss of ascorbic acid (8.5%) but showed greater metabolic changes as sprouting, weight loss, firmness, and sugars contents. Also, more increased delay in irradiation needed higher radiation doses for sprout inhibition."

Protection from wireworm damage was measured by the number of blemishes to daughter tubers, and effects on wireworm populations were measured by sampling soil around seed potatoes and/or by bait traps the following spring. Organophosphates registered for wireworm control in the United States and/or Canada (phorate and chlorpyrifos), significantly reduced blemishes to tubers by, respectively, 92.2 and 90.2%, and populations of large (> or = 9 mm long = 'resident') wireworms by 83.4 and 71.0% relative to controls. Similar reductions in smaller (< 9 mm long = 'neonate') wireworms were also observed. Neonicotinoids (imidacloprid, clothianidin, and thiamethoxam) tested as seed piece treatments at approximately 12.5 g active ingredient/100 kg potato seed reduced blemishes by, respectively, 19.1, 71.6, and 90.6%, but resident wireworms were only reduced by, respectively, 22.0, 29.1, and 51.8%. Significant mortality of neonates was not observed with any neonicotinoid treatment. With the possible exception of thiamethoxam, where significant reduction in resident wireworms occurred, it is likely that the blemish protection provided without significant wireworm mortality with imidacloprid and clothianidin treatments was because of long-term wireworm intoxication followed by population recovery. The phenyl pyrazole, fipronil, applied as an in-furrow spray reduced blemishes by 94.3%, and resident wireworm populations could not be detected in plots the following spring. Neonates were reduced by 93.3%, indicating excellent residual conotrol had occurred with fipronil. These studies indicate that tuber protection by fipronil and currently registered organophosphates is likely because of significant early season mortality of wireworms, whereas neonicotinoids generally provide control through long-term morbidity without high levels of mortality occurring.",

      "abstract": "The use of culled potatoes was investigated in Belgian Blue double-muscled finishing cows, confined in tie stalls. The control diet (Treatment 1) consisted of concentrate and maize silage (50/50 on a dry matter (DM) basis). Potatoes either replaced 60% maize silage (Treatment 2) or 60% concentrate (Treatment 3). Diets were formulated to be isocaloric and isonitrogenous. They were fed ad libitum. Approximately 18 kg potatoes were fed daily in Treatments 2 and 3. Daily gain was not significantly altered; it decreased from 1.09 kg (Treatment 1) to 1.04 kg (Treatment 2) or increased to 1.20 kg (Treatment 3), although potatoes stimulated DM intake by 5% to 8% (P < 0.05). Feed conversion was unaffected in comparison with the control diet, when expressed in terms of DM, but energy efficiency (MJ/kg live weight gain) was substantially lower for Treatment 2 compared with Treatment 1 (89.9 v. 79.0; P = 0.046). Carcass weight, grading and composition were not affected by treatments, but potatoes increased dressing percentage (P = 0.009). Treatment had no significant effect on meat quality parameters. However, potatoes (Treatments 2 and 3) tended to decrease moisture content (P = 0.090) and tended to increase drip loss (P = 0.059) compared with Treatment 1. Because of a better animal performance and a lower feed cost, it is most appropriate to use potatoes as a replacement for concentrate. Feeding large amounts of potatoes besides concentrate may have an adverse effect on the fibrousness of the diet, resulting in a tendency (-5%) for a reduced daily gain and a lower energy efficiency (P < 0.05).",

      "abstract": "A new analytical approach is exploited in the assay of selenium speciation in selenized and not selenium enriched potatoes based on the widely available solid-phase microextraction (SPME) coupled to-GC-triple quadrupole mass spectrometry (SPME-GC-QqQ MS) method. The assay of selenomethionine (SeMet) and selenomethylselenocysteine (SeMeSeCys) in potatoes here reported provides clues to the effectiveness of SPME technique combined with gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, which could be of general use. For the exploitation of the GC method, the selected analytes were converted into their N(O,S)-alkoxycarbonyl alkyl esters derivatives by direct treatment with alkyl chloroformate in aqueous extracts. The performance of five SPME fibers and three chloroformates were tested in univariate mode and the best results were obtained using the divinylbenzene/carboxen/polydimethylsiloxane fiber and propylchloroformate. The variables affecting the efficiency of SPME analysis were optimized by the multivariate approach of design of experiment (DoE) and, in particular, a central composite design (CCD) was applied. Tandem mass spectrometry in selected reaction monitoring (SRM) has allowed the elimination of matrix interferences, providing reconstructed chromatograms with well-resolved peaks and the achievement of very satisfactory detection and quantification limits. Both precision and recovery of the proposed protocol tested at concentration of 8 and 40 μg kg(-1) (dry matter), offered values ranging from 82.3 to 116.3% and from 8.5 to 13.1% for recovery and precision, respectively. The application of the method to commercial samples of selenized and not selenium enriched potatoes proved that the Se fertilization increases significantly the concentration of these bioavailable selenoamino acids.",

      "abstract": "UNLABELLED: After-cooking darkening (ACD) is an inherent and undesirable trait that develops in cooked potatoes. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of sodium acid sulfate (SAS) dip treatments compared to other antigraying treatments and a control to reduce ACD in boiled, Katahdin potatoes. Dip treatments were applied for 3 min prior to boiling and included: 3% SAS, 3% citric acid (CA), 3% sodium acid pyrophosphate (SAPP), along with a distilled water control. SAS- and CA-treated potatoes had slightly, but significantly (P ≤ 0.05) higher b* and chroma values, which indicates a more intense yellow potato color, with less graying, compared to the control. SAS- and CA-treated potatoes also had significantly (P≤ 0.001) lower pH values for inner and outer potato surfaces than the control. No significant (P > 0.05) differences were detected for total phenolic or mineral contents among treatments. CA and SAPP samples had slightly, but significantly (P≤ 0.05) higher moisture contents than the control. Sensory test results showed no significant differences for color, aftertaste, or overall acceptability. However, CA-treated samples were rated significantly (P≤ 0.05) lower for flavor than all other treatments and panelists commented on sour notes. CA- and SAS-treated potatoes were scored slightly, but significantly lower for texture than other treatments due to a waxy outer layer. However, SAS was the most acidic dip treatment, but did not significantly affect flavor. Overall, results suggest that SAS was similarly accepted by consumers in comparison to CA and SAPP, which is the industry standard to reduce ACD. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: After-cooking darkening (ACD) is an undesirable potato trait that occurs after potatoes have been processed. Sodium acid pyrophosphate (SAPP) has been used as the industry standard to reduce ACD. Sodium acid sulfate (SAS) treatments prior to boiling appeared to be comparable to SAPP and citric acid in effectiveness to reduce ACD. SAS did not negatively affect the flavor of boiled potato samples according to sensory results. The SAS treatment may be more beneficial for potatoes intended for potato salad products.",

      "abstract": "Atrial fibrillation (AF) ablation has evolved to the treatment of choice for patients with drug-resistant and symptomatic AF. Pulmonary vein isolation at the ostial or antral level usually is sufficient for treatment of true paroxysmal AF. For persistent AF ablation, drivers and perpetuators outside of the pulmonary veins are responsible for AF maintenance and have to be targeted to achieve satisfying arrhythmia-free success rate. Both complex fractionated atrial electrogram (CFAE) ablation and linear ablation are added to pulmonary vein isolation for persistent AF ablation. Nevertheless, ablation failure and necessity of repeat ablations are still frequent, especially after persistent AF ablation. Pulmonary vein reconduction is the main reason for arrhythmia recurrence after paroxysmal and to a lesser extent after persistent AF ablation. Failure of persistent AF ablation mostly is a consequence of inadequate trigger ablation, substrate modification or incompletely ablated or reconducting linear lesions. In this review we will discuss these points responsible for AF recurrence after ablation and review current possibilities on how to overcome these limitations.",

      "abstract": "The objective of the study was to determine the effectiveness of acidulant dip treatments (with or without aqueous ozone) to reduce enzymatic browning and to extend the shelf life of fresh-cut potato slices during refrigerated storage (4 °C) for 28 d. Potato slices subjected to aqueous ozone (2 ppm) had significantly (P≤ 0.05) higher L-values and lower a-values, but ozone did not appear to have any effect on aerobic plate counts (APCs) or polyphenol oxidase (PPO) activity. NatureSeal (NS) and sodium acid sulfate (SAS) were the most effective acidulant treatments in reducing browning (significantly [P≤ 0.05] higher L-values, lower a-values, and browning index values) regardless of ozone treatment. NS and SAS also had lower PPO activity compared to other treatments on days 0 and 28, and significantly (P≤ 0.05) lower APCs (≤2.00 log CFU/g) over refrigerated storage. Therefore, the SAS treatment was comparable to NS, a commercially available product, and showed promise as an effective antibrowning dip to reduce browning and spoilage in fresh-cut potato products. Practical Application:  A 1% SAS dip treatment which included 1% citric and 1% ascorbic acid was found to be an effective antibrowning dip for fresh-cut potatoes along with NatureSeal®'s PS-10, compared to other treatments. They were both effective in maintaining low microbial counts over refrigerated storage. Additionally, aqueous ozone washes (2 ppm) showed significant benefits to reduce browning; however, ozone did not affect microbial counts or PPO enzyme activity. Therefore, the SAS treatment could have potential use in the fruit and vegetable industry to reduce browning and spoilage in fresh-cut potato products.",

      "abstract": "In 2005, the active substance maleic hydrazide was released on the Belgian market. Maleic hydrazide is authorized in potatoes as foliar treatment for instore sprout suppression and control of volunteers. The mode of action is based on blocking cell division whilst cell elongation is not affected. The product must be applied at once during the growing season, only after at least 80% of the tubers have reached 25 mm diameter and not later than 3 weeks before haulm killing. The first 24 h after application, no meaningful precipitation should occur to insure sufficiently uptake of the product by the crop. Field trials were set up for 4 years (2005-2008) and 4 locations per year with application of maleic hydrazide in four different cultivars (Bintje, Fontane, Asterix and Cilena). After application, the cultivar Asterix showed almost every year a temporarily phytotoxicity (bronze discoloration). On the first place yield was determined. When maleic hydrazide was applied too early (80% tubers % 25mm diameter) yield was negatively affected (3 years on 4) except for the cultivar Cilena (fresh market). Internal quality (dry matter and fry quality) was not influenced by the application of maleic hydrazide. Only Fontane had a slightly lower dry matter content. Maleic hydrazide also influenced appearance of secondary growth. However, the results were very variable depending on cultivar, location and time of application. After harvest, the tubers were kept in storage and assessed monthly on germination. Potatoes treated late in the growing season, showed a shorter dormancy period. A part of the tubers was replanted the following spring to verify volunteer control. Additional trials were set up by the Flemish government for two years (2010-2011). The results of previous trials were confirmed. Additional, the influence of maleic hydrazide on internal germination during storage was examined on the cultivar Innovator. The tests clearly showed a positive effect for this parameter.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The aim of this work was to study the influence of steam cooking on pectin methylesterase (PME) and endogenous α- and β-amylase activities in different tissues (cortex and pith) of raw and heat-treated potatoes cv. Agria. Three different cooking temperatures were chosen (55, 70 and 85 °C). For each cooking trial, time-temperature profiles were recorded and the degree of cooking was expressed in terms of cooking factor. RESULTS: Steam cooking contributed to significantly activate PME at 55 °C and to reduce its activity at the final processing temperature (85 °C), with the highest amount in the cortex (0.3745 ± 0.0007 µmol galacturonic acid (GA) g(-1) fresh weight (FW) min(-1) ) compared with the pith (0.2617 ± 0.0012 µmol GA g(-1) FW min(-1) ). The presence of heat-labile and heat-stable isoforms of PME in the considered potato tissues was also assumed. Heat treatment by steam resulted in a significant decrease in endogenous α- and β-amylase activities in both tissues compared with the raw potato, though without complete deactivation. Starch-degrading enzymes were also found to be differently distributed in the raw tuber. CONCLUSION: Steam cooking affected in different ways the assessed residual enzymatic activity in the considered tissues of potatoes cv. Agria. Further research is needed to confirm the results obtained.",

      "abstract": "During recent growing seasons, a new leaf blight was observed on potatoes (Solanum tuberosum L.) in various production regions in South Africa. Symptoms were observed before early blight, from 50 to 60 days after emergence of the potato plants. Typical leaf symptoms were small, circular, brown lesions, first visible on the abaxial sides of leaves. Lesions resembled those of early blight, but were smaller and did not show concentric rings. During favorable environmental conditions, severe infections were seen as coalesced lesions and blighted leaves and stems. Such severe infections occurred in seasons when high humidity, leaf wetness, and warm temperatures were present. Yield losses as much as 40% were reported on approximately 50 20-ha pivots in various potato-growing regions, particularly Ceres, Eastern Free State, KwaZulu Natal, and Mpumalanga, due to this leaf blight because conventional fungicidal spray programs did not adequately control the disease. Isolations from leaf lesions were made on V8 juice agar under aseptic conditions. The fungus, Alternaria alternata (Fr.) Kreissler, was consistently isolated and preliminarily identified on the basis of morphological characteristics. Dark brown conidia were produced in chains on conidiophores. Conidia had short beaks and ranged from 20 to 60 × 9 to 18 μm. Morphological identification was confirmed by amplification of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region. Primers used were AAF2 (5'-TGCAATCAGCGTCAGTAACAAAT-3') and AAR3 (5'-ATGGATGCTAGACCTTTGCTGAT-3'), specifically designed for identification of A. alternata (4). PCR products were sequenced and the identity of isolates confirmed by a BLAST search on the GenBank database. Koch's postulates were conducted by inoculation of healthy potato leaves of cv. BP1. Spores at a concentration of 106 spores per ml were suspended in an oil/surfactant mixture and sprayed onto leaves until runoff. Control plants were sprayed with a sterile oil/surfactant mixture until runoff. Plants were covered by polyethylene bags for 2 days to achieve high humidity levels and maintained in a greenhouse at 25 ± 2°C. Three days after inoculation, plants were exposed to a moisture regimen simulating that of in-field irrigation. Plants were placed in a fogging chamber twice a week for 1 h at a time. Leaf blight symptoms similar to those observed on diseased potato plants in the field began to develop 3 weeks after inoculation. Isolations made from these lesions consistently yielded A. alternata. Control plants did not develop any symptoms. Five plants were used for each treatment and the experiment was repeated twice. Leaf blight on potatoes caused by A. alternata has previously been reported in Israel, (2), Brazil (1), and North America (3). To our knowledge, this is the first report of A. alternata causing leaf blight on potatoes in South Africa. Future research will focus primarily on management of this disease. References: (1) L. S.
