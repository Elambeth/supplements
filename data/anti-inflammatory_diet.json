      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the effects of an anti-inflammatory diet (AID) combined with Infliximab (IFX) therapy on maternal and neonatal health outcomes in pregnant Chinese patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). METHODS: IBD patients treated with steady IFX maintenance therapy at the time of conception were randomly assigned to either the IBD-AID group (n = 49), which received an anti-inflammatory diet intervention during the third trimester, or the habitual diet group (n = 49). Primary outcomes included assessments of disease activity, inflammatory markers, and neonatal health. Secondary outcomes included health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in patients and functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs) in infants. RESULTS: The IBD-AID intervention significantly reduced disease activity scores in IBD patients at 4 weeks post-intervention and 1 month postpartum compared to the habitual diet group, and also improved HRQoL. Serum C-reactive protein (CRP) and fecal calprotectin (FC) levels were significantly lower in the IBD-AID group at these times, with a trend towards lower levels at 6 months postpartum. Birth weight and Apgar scores were higher in the IBD-AID group but did not reach statistical significance. The incidence of at least one FGID in infants was significantly lower in the IBD-AID group (24.5%) compared to the habitual diet group (46.9%, p = 0.034). CONCLUSION: The IBD-AID intervention combined with IFX therapy significantly improved disease activity, inflammatory markers, and QoL in maternal IBD patients, and was associated with a lower incidence of FGIDs in infants, indicating benefits for both maternal and neonatal health.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The latest evidence highlights that an unhealthy diet and poor nutrition status are some of the modifiable behavioural risk factors responsible for the development of non-communicable diseases (NCDs). Anti-inflammatory diets are important in both the treatment and prevention of disease (e.g. hypertension, obesity, Hashimoto's thyroiditis). The concept of these diets has common core foundations and recommendations. The family environment from early childhood plays a particularly important role in shaping healthy eating patterns of children and youths. Thus, parents' nutritional knowledge, attitudes, and dietary practices are essential in preventing NCD development and improving their children's health as their primary guardians. This study aims to assess parents' awareness of an anti-inflammatory diet. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 325 parents participated in the study. Data for the study were collected anonymously using the CAWI method. The research tool was an original questionnaire about parents' awareness of anti-inflammatory diets. RESULTS: Of the 325 parents participating in the study, 204 (62.8%) admitted that they did not know which products to use in an anti-inflammatory diet. About half of them (165; 50.8%) had unsatisfactory knowledge of the anti-inflammatory diet, 66 (30.3%) had a good level of knowledge, and only 16 (5.5%) respondents had an excellent level of knowledge. CONCLUSIONS: Parental awareness of the use of the anti-inflammatory diet was insufficient in the study group. It seems important to implement appropriate educational activities on the anti-inflammatory diet to expand parents' knowledge of the impact of nutrition on children's development.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: While dietary intervention was an important public health strategy for the prevention and intervention of metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD), the effect of diet-induced inflammation on MAFLD has not been studied in detail. Therefore, we aimed to analyze the relationship between dietary inflammatory index (DII) and MAFLD. METHODS: This study included data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2017-2018. MAFLD was diagnosed based on the presence of hepatic steatosis, as determined by transient elastography, along with evidence of either overweight/obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus, or metabolic dysfunction. DII was calculated using 27 dietary components collected through 24-hour dietary recall questionnaire. Weighted logistic regression was used to analyze the relationship between DII and MAFLD and its main components in three different models. Subgroup analyses were performed by age, sex, and alcohol use. RESULTS: A total of 1991 participants were included, and the MAFLD group had higher DII scores. After adjusting for age, sex, race, physical activity, smoking status, and alcohol use, the highest quartile of DII was associated with increased risk of MAFLD (OR:2.90, 95% CIs: 1.46, 5.75). Overweight/obesity, central obesity, low high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and high C-reactive protein (CRP) also shared the same characteristics in the main components of MAFLD. Results were consistent across subgroups (age, sex, and alcohol use). CONCLUSIONS: A higher DII diet was positively associated with the risk of MAFLD in American adults, particularly as related to overweight/obesity, central obesity, high CRP level, and low HDL-C level.",

The aim of this study is to design a novel anti-inflammatory diet intervention (DI) that is feasible to implement in a first-episode psychosis (FEP) population. METHODS: Eligible FEP Participants are aged 15-30. The DI is currently being refined through a multi-phase process that includes the recruitment of focus groups that provide insight into feasibility of measures and nutritional education, as well as the implementation of the DI. The phases in the study are the Development Phase, Formative Phase, and the Feasibility Phase. RESULTS: The Development phase has resulted in the creation of a flexible DI for FEP based on existing research on nutritional health and informed by providers. This study has just completed the Formative phase, recruiting eligible participants to join focus groups that gleaned information about dietary habits, preferences, and food environments to further refine the DI. CONCLUSION: Findings from earlier phases have advised the current Feasibility Phase in which this novel DI is being administered to a small cohort of FEP participants (N = 12) to determine acceptability of the DI from a lived experience perspective. Naturalistic changes in inflammatory biomarkers, metabolic health, and symptoms will also be measured."

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is a chronic inflammatory condition with complex and heterogenous manifestations. Although a myriad of treatment options including biologic medications are available to alleviate symptoms and slow disease progression, there is currently no cure for this condition. There has been a recent emergence of understanding about the relationship between the gut microbiome and immune-mediated inflammatory diseases. This has generated interest in the potential role of dietary interventions, particularly anti-inflammatory diets, and fecal microbiota transplant (FMT) as novel therapeutic approaches. The purpose of this narrative review is to examine the role of an anti-inflammatory diet and FMT in turn and whether their combination may offer alternate approaches for the management of PsA. METHODS: Our non-systematic narrative review was informed by a literature search using PubMed and Google Scholar using the terms anti-inflammatory diet, FMT, nutrition supplements, and PsA. Preclinical studies and non-English language articles were excluded when synthesizing the narrative review. FINDINGS: Current randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational evidence suggest that a hypocaloric diet or Mediterranean diet can help achieve weight loss among PsA patients who are overweight or obese, which in turn reduces inflammation and improves disease activity. However, there is no strong data to support the beneficial effects of intermittent fasting, vitamin supplements, turmeric supplements, probiotics, or omega-3 fatty acid supplements in PsA. Current evidence on the use of FMT in PsA is limited as only one small RCT has been conducted which did not demonstrate efficacy for improving clinical symptoms. IMPLICATIONS: Clinicians can consider recommending hypocaloric or Mediterranean diets as an adjunct to standard management of PsA, possibly under the guidance of a dietician. Further research is needed to explore the beneficial effects of the synergistic role of combining an anti-inflammatory diet with FMT in PsA.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Chronic inflammation plays a key role in knee osteoarthritis pathophysiology and increases risk of comorbidities, yet most interventions do not typically target inflammation. Our study will investigate if an anti-inflammatory dietary programme is superior to a standard care low-fat dietary programme for improving knee pain, function and quality-of-life in people with knee osteoarthritis. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The eFEct of an Anti-inflammatory diet for knee oSTeoarthritis study is a parallel-group, assessor-blinded, superiority randomised controlled trial. Following baseline assessment, 144 participants aged 45-85 years with symptomatic knee osteoarthritis will be randomly allocated to one of two treatment groups (1:1 ratio). Participants randomised to the anti-inflammatory dietary programme will receive six dietary consultations over 12 weeks (two in-person and four phone/videoconference) and additional educational and behaviour change resources. The consultations and resources emphasise nutrient-dense minimally processed anti-inflammatory foods and discourage proinflammatory processed foods. Participants randomised to the standard care low-fat dietary programme will receive three dietary consultations over 12 weeks (two in-person and one phone/videoconference) consisting of healthy eating advice and education based on the Australian Dietary Guidelines, reflecting usual care in Australia. Adherence will be assessed with 3-day food diaries. Outcomes are assessed at 12 weeks and 6 months. The primary outcome will be change from baseline to 12 weeks in the mean score on four Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS4) subscales: knee pain, symptoms, function in daily activities and knee-related quality of life. Secondary outcomes include change in individual KOOS subscale scores, patient-perceived improvement, health-related quality of life, body mass and composition using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, inflammatory (high-sensitivity C reactive protein, interleukins, tumour necrosis factor-α) and metabolic blood biomarkers (glucose, glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c), insulin, liver function, lipids), lower-limb function and physical activity. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study has received ethics approval from La Trobe University Human Ethics Committee. Results will be presented in peer-reviewed journals and at international conferences.

      "abstract": "RESEARCH QUESTION: What is the feasibility of an anti-inflammatory diet in women diagnosed with endometriosis? DESIGN: Qualitative study using semi-structured focus groups and individual interviews among patients with endometriosis. Transcripts of the focus groups and interviews were thematically analysed using ATLAS.ti 9. To identify and structure the ideas and views from the focus groups and interviews, two behavioural change models were used. The Capability Opportunity Motivation Behaviour (COM-B) model and domains of the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF) helped to identify factors that make adherence to an anti-inflammatory diet more or less feasible for women with endometriosis. RESULTS: The study population consisted of 23 patients with endometriosis. Numerous perceived barriers and facilitators were identified from all COM-B components and 13 out of 15 TDF domains. Knowledge and social influences were the most prominent TDF domains. Key barriers were eating with others; disbelief in a patients' own capability regarding specific dietary guidelines; concerns about taste; lack of knowledge on how to follow the diet; lack of noticeable beneficial effect; and lack of intention to follow the diet to full extent. Key facilitators were receiving social support; general confidence in a participant's own capabilities; knowing how and why to follow the diet; noticing beneficial effect; and belief that the diet would alleviate symptoms. CONCLUSION: Provision of knowledge, stimulating social support and enhancing self-efficacy should be emphasized. Overall, an anti-inflammatory diet in endometriosis patients, especially when identified barriers and facilitators are addressed in an intervention, is feasible.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Rheumatic diseases result in chronic pain (CP) and require treatment with drugs whose prolonged administration is associated with side effects. However, publications in the academic literature have suggested that diet modification and food supplementation can play a crucial role in alleviating the symptoms of inflammatory disease. Thus, it is hoped that the use of an anti-inflammatory diet for pain management might result in improved quality of life. Hence, here we aimed to investigate the effect of anti-inflammatory foods in patients with CP caused by rheumatic diseases. METHODS: After an exhaustive bibliography search, we designed a 13-item anti-inflammatory dietary guide based on a Mediterranean diet without red meat, gluten, or cow's milk (the AnMeD-S). We then conducted a pilot study to evaluate the efficacy of this anti-inflammatory diet in patients with CP. A food consumption score (with a maximum of 156 points) was then applied to evaluate patient adhesion to the proposed diet. Forty-five patients with CP were followed-up for 4 months. Variables related with quality of life (including pain perception, depression status, and sleep satisfaction) were measured using 9 validated questionnaires and anthropometric measurements were recorded before and after the participants followed the anti-inflammatory diet. RESULTS: We found a correlation between increased anti-inflammatory food intake and improved physical characteristics, stress, and pain in the patients we assessed. Moreover, decreased consumption of pro-inflammatory foods was positively correlated with sleep satisfaction. Following the AnMeD-S was associated with improved physical characteristics and quality-of-life in patients with CP. CONCLUSION: The AnMeD-S, includes anti-inflammatory foods and restricts the consumption of certain pro-inflammatory foods (such as those containing gluten). This dietary pattern could provide relief from CP and improve the symptoms of stress and depression, as well as reducing sleep disturbances."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: In the ADIRA (Anti-inflammatory Diet In Rheumatoid arthritis) trial, compliance to the study diets has previously been described primarily with a score based on reported intake of trial foods from telephone interviews. The aim of this study was to evaluate compliance using objective dietary biomarkers for whole grain, fruit and vegetables, margarine and oil, seafood and overall fat quality, as well as reported intake from food records of key components of the study diets. METHODS: Fifty patients with rheumatoid arthritis were randomized to begin with the intervention diet (rich in whole grain, fruit and vegetables, margarine/oil and seafood) or the control diet (rich in meat and high-fat dairy) for 10 weeks, followed by a ~ 4 months wash-out period, and then switched diet. Compliance was evaluated using plasma alkylresorcinols (AR) as biomarkers for intake of whole grain wheat and rye, serum carotenoids for fruit and vegetables, plasma linoleic acid (LA, 18:2 n-6) and -α-linolenic acid (18:3, n-3) for margarine and cooking oil, plasma eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, 20:5 n-3), -docosahexaenoic acid (DHA 22:6, n-3) and -docosapentaenoic acid (22:5 n-3) for seafood, and plasma fatty acid pattern for the overall dietary fat quality. Reported intake of whole grain, fruit, berries and vegetables, seafood, red meat, and fat quality was extracted from 3-d food records. RESULTS: Plasma AR C21:0 and C23:0, LA, EPA, and DHA were higher while total serum carotenoids were lower after the intervention diet period compared to the control diet period (AR and carotenoids: p = <0.05, fatty acids: p = <0.001). Reported intake of whole grain, fruit, berries and vegetables, and seafood was higher and reported intake of red meat was lower during the intervention diet period compared to the control diet period (p = <0.001). Plasma- and reported fatty acid pattern differed as intended between the diet periods. CONCLUSION: This study indicates that the participants in the ADIRA trial were compliant to the study diets regarding intake of whole grain, cooking fat, seafood, and red meat, and the intended overall dietary fat quality. Compliance to instructions on fruit- and vegetable intake remains uncertain. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02941055?term=NCT02941055&draw=2&rank=1, NCT02941055."

      "abstract": "Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common cause of liver disease in children. Following earlier reports on an increase in the prevalence of childhood obesity, NAFLD is now becoming increasingly common in children. Although no definitive cure exists, early management, early diagnosis, and treatment can reduce its complications. This study aims to determine the effectiveness of the combination of ginger and an anti-inflammatory diet (AID) in children with obesity on fatty liver management. This randomized clinical trial was conducted on 160 children with obesity aged 8-11 years, with a mean (SD) weight of 65.01 (9.67) kg, mean (SD) height of 139.87 (7.37) cm, and mean (SD) body mass index of 33.40 (5.59) kg/m2. The study duration was 12 weeks. Children were divided into four groups: ginger (G), AID, ginger plus an AID (GPA), and control. Ginger capsules comprised 1000 mg of ginger, whereas the AID comprised fruits and vegetables, fish, turkey, and chicken (without skin) with lean meat, omega-3 sources, nuts, legumes, probiotic products, and elimination of inflammatory food. Following the intervention, serum fasting blood sugar and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein levels were significantly decreased in the AID (p = .006 and .002, respectively), G (p = .04 and <.001, respectively), and GPA (p <.001 in both cases, respectively) groups. Further, in the G and GPA groups, there was a significant decrease in body mass index (p = .04 in both cases, respectively), waist circumference (p = .009 and .003, respectively), waist-to-height ratio (p = .02 and .005, respectively), alanine aminotransferase (p = .004 and <.001, respectively), total cholesterol (p = .0002 and .0001, respectively) and low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (p < .001 and <.001, respectively). Eventually, serum aspartate aminotransferase was decreased (p < .001) and high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (p = .03) was increased significantly in the GPA group. As a main finding of this study, hepatic steatosis significantly decreased in the G and GPA groups. Ginger supplementation can effectively improve NAFLD in children, and its effectiveness was further increased when combined with an AID."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Chronic inflammation is associated with noncommunicable diseases, including obesity, metabolic syndrome (MetS), and CVDs. The Mediterranean diet has been shown to have strong anti-inflammatory effects, attributed in part to the polyphenol richness of many of its components. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to assess the value of polyphenols as a urinary biomarker of an anti-inflammatory diet and their influence on MetS status. METHODS: A longitudinal analysis was performed in Spain considering 543 participants with high CVD risk in a PREDIMED study. Approximately 52% of the participants were women and 48% were men with a mean age of 67.5 (5.9) y. Total polyphenol excretion (TPE) in urine was determined at baseline and 5 y of intervention using a validated Folin-Ciocalteu spectrophotometric method, and the dietary inflammatory index (DII) was calculated from a validated 137-item food-frequency questionnaire. Three categories were built according to tertiles of change in the DII score. Multivariable linear regression analyses were performed to assess the association of changes in TPE with changes in the DII scores and with MetS status at 5 y. RESULTS: Tertiles 2 and 3 compared with tertile 1 presented a lower anti-inflammatory potential of the diet and were inversely associated with TPE in women [-0.30 mg gallic acid equivalent (GAE)/g creatinine; 95% CI: -0.46, -0.15; P value = 0.006 and -0.29 mg GAE/g creatinine; 95% CI: -0.43, -0.15; P value = 0.005], respectively. The mean changes in TPE were 7.9 (56.1) mg GAE/g creatinine in women and 7.7 (48.2) mg GAE/g creatinine in men. In addition, TPE was inversely associated with changes in MetS status [-0.06 (-0.09; -0.02), P value = 0.009] in both men and women. CONCLUSIONS: Urinary polyphenols may be a potential biomarker of anti-inflammatory diet consumption in women and are prospectively associated with improvement in MetS.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Diet plays a pivotal role in the onset and progression of Crohn's disease (CD). Nutritional interventions revealed effects on intestinal inflammation and gut microbial composition. However, data from well-designed and controlled dietary trials are lacking. Therefore, evidence-based dietary recommendations are still unavailable to patients and physicians. Here, we aim to investigate the effects of an evidence-based anti-inflammatory diet, and an ileocolonic-targeted capsule containing vitamin B2, B3 and C (ColoVit) on patients with CD and their healthy household members. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: In this multicentre, randomised, placebo-controlled, partially blinded nutritional intervention trial, we aim to recruit 255 CD patients with Harvey-Bradshaw Index <8 and a faecal calprotectin (FCal) cut-off of ≥100 µg/g at baseline. Participants will be randomised into two experimental intervention groups and one placebo group. In the experimental groups, participants will either adhere to the Groningen anti-inflammatory diet (GrAID) or ingest an ileocolonic-delivered oral vitamin B2/B3/C capsule (ColoVit). The study consists of a 12-week controlled interventional phase, which proceeds to a 9-month observational follow-up phase in which patients allocated to the GrAID group will be requested to continue the intervention on their own accord. Household members of participating patients will be asked to participate in the trial as healthy subjects and are allocated to the same group as their peer. The primary study outcome for patients is the change in FCal level from baseline. The primary outcome for household members is the change in gut microbial composition, which is set as secondary outcome for patients. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The protocol has been approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Stichting Beoordeling Ethiek Biomedisch Onderzoek in Assen, the Netherlands. Written informed consent will be obtained from all participants. Results will be disseminated through peer-reviewed journals and conference presentations. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT04913467.",

We have seen a surge of disorders that are obesity-related, e.g., insulin resistance (IR), type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), high blood pressure, heart disease, stroke, cancer, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), autoimmune disorders and many more. The mechanisms linking these diseases to excess body weight are related to low-grade inflammation (LGI). Although there is a limited number of studies assessing this immune process in childhood obesity, they indicate its significant importance for the health of future generations. There is a need for more research into the prevention and treatment of low-grade inflammation in childhood. The aim of this review is to present and discuss the process of \"cold\" inflammation, and its impact on health and anti-inflammation nutrition.

      "abstract": "Obesity has consistently been associated with an increased risk of metabolic abnormalities such as diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and cardiovascular diseases, as well as the development of several types of cancer. In recent decades, unfortunately, the rate of overweight/obesity has increased significantly among adults and children. A growing body of evidence shows that there is a relationship between metabolic disorders such as obesity and the composition of the gut microbiota. Additionally, inflammation is considered to be a driving force in the obesity-gut microbiota connection. Therefore, it seems that anti-inflammatory nutrients, foods, and/or diets can play an essential role in the management of obesity by affecting the intestinal flora and controlling inflammatory responses. In this review, we describe the links between the gut microbiota, obesity, and inflammation, and summarize the benefits of anti-inflammatory diets in preventing obesity.",

In a 6-month, open-label, randomized, placebo-controlled trial, adult UC patients in clinical remission were randomized to either an “Anti-inflammatory Diet (AID)” or “Canada’s Food Guide (CFG)”. Menu plans in the AID were designed to increase the dietary intake of dietary fiber, probiotics, antioxidants, and omega-3 fatty acids and to decrease the intake of red meat, processed meat, and added sugar. Stool was collected for fecal calprotectin (FCP) and microbial analysis. Metabolomic analysis was performed on urine, serum, and stool samples at the baseline and study endpoint. In this study, 53 patients were randomized. Five (19.2%) patients in the AID and 8 (29.6%) patients in the CFG experienced a clinical relapse. The subclinical response to the intervention (defined as FCP < 150 µg/g at the endpoint) was significantly higher in the AID group (69.2 vs. 37.0%, p = 0.02). The patients in the AID group had an increased intake of zinc, phosphorus, selenium, yogurt, and seafood versus the control group. Adherence to the AID was associated with significant changes in the metabolome, with decreased fecal acetone and xanthine levels along with increased fecal taurine and urinary carnosine and p-hydroxybenzoic acid levels. The AID subjects also had increases in fecal Bifidobacteriaceae, Lachnospiraceae, and Ruminococcaceae. In this study, we found thatdietary modifications involving the increased intake of anti-inflammatory foods combined with a decreased intake of pro-inflammatory foods were associated with metabolic and microbial changes in UC patients in clinical remission and were effective in preventing subclinical inflammation.",

We aimed to examine the efficacy of multidonor faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) and anti-inflammatory diet in inducing remission followed by long-term maintenance with anti-inflammatory diet in patients with mild-moderate UC. DESIGN: This open-labelled randomised controlled trial (RCT) randomised patients with mild-moderate (Simple Clinical Colitis Activity Index (SCCAI) 3-9) endoscopically active UC (Ulcerative Colitis Endoscopic Index of Severity (UCEIS)>1) on stable baseline medications in 1:1 ratio to FMT and anti-inflammatory diet (FMT-AID) versus optimised standard medical therapy (SMT). The FMT-AID arm received seven weekly colonoscopic infusions of freshly prepared FMT from multiple rural donors(weeks 0-6) with anti-inflammatory diet. Baseline medications were optimised in the SMT arm. Clinical responders (decline in SCCAI>3) at 8 weeks in both arms were followed until 48 weeks on baseline medications (with anti-inflammatory diet in the FMT-AID arm). Primary outcome measures were clinical response and deep remission (clinical-SCCAI <2; and endoscopic-UCEIS <1) at 8 weeks, and deep remission and steroid-free clinical remission at 48 weeks. RESULTS: Of the 113 patients screened, 73 were randomised, and 66 were included in (35-FMT-AID; 31-SMT) modified intention-to-treat analysis (age-35.7±11.1 years; male-60.1%; disease duration-48 (IQR 24-84) months; pancolitis-34.8%; SCCAI-6 (IQR 5-7); UCEIS-4 (IQR 3-5)). Baseline characteristics were comparable. FMT-AID was superior to SMT in inducing clinical response (23/35 (65.7%) vs 11/31 (35.5%), p=0.01, OR 3.5 (95% CI 1.3 to 9.6)), remission (21/35 (60%) vs 10/31 (32.3%), p=0.02, OR 3.2 (95% CI 1.1 to 8.7)) and deep remission (12/33 (36.4%) vs 2/23 (8.7%), p=0.03, OR 6.0 (95% CI 1.2 to 30.2)) at 8 weeks. Anti-inflammatory diet was superior to SMT in maintaining deep remission until 48 weeks (6/24 (25%) vs 0/27, p=0.007). CONCLUSION: Multidonor FMT with anti-inflammatory diet effectively induced deep remission in mild-moderate UC which was sustained with anti-inflammatory diet over 1 year.

Chronic activation of inflammatory pathways results in decreased function and the development of comorbidities, such as loss of lean mass while retaining total body mass. The objective of this report was to assess whether dietary manipulation affects body composition in patients with RA as a secondary outcome. Fifty patients were included in a randomized controlled crossover trial testing a proposed anti-inflammatory Mediterranean-style diet compared to a Western diet. Body composition was measured by bioelectrical impedance spectroscopy in patients without implants (n = 45). Regardless of treatment, fat-free mass increased and fat mass percentage decreased during weight stability, but no differences between intervention and control in the whole group (n = 42, all p > 0.20) were found. Interaction analysis revealed that participants who were non-employed (n = 15) significantly decreased in fat mass (−1.767 kg; 95% CI: −3.060, −0.475, p = 0.012) and fat mass percentage (−1.805%; 95% CI: −3.024, −0.586, p = 0.008) from the intervention compared to the control period.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Knee osteoarthritis has an inflammatory component that is linked to pain and joint pathology, yet common non-surgical and non-pharmacological interventions (e.g., exercise, calorie restricting diets) do not typically target inflammation. We aimed to evaluate the feasibility of a telehealth delivered anti-inflammatory diet intervention for knee osteoarthritis. METHODS: This 9-week single-arm feasibility study recruited participants aged 40-85 years with symptomatic knee osteoarthritis (inclusion criteria: average pain ≥4/10 or maximal pain ≥5/10 during past week). All participants received a telehealth-delivered anti-inflammatory dietary education intervention involving 1:1 consultations at baseline, 3- and 6-week follow-up. The diet emphasised nutrient-dense wholefoods and minimally processed anti-inflammatory foods and discouraged processed foods considered to be pro-inflammatory. The primary outcome of feasibility was assessed via: i) eligibility, recruitment and retention rates; ii) self-reported dietary adherence; iii) adverse events; and iv) treatment satisfaction. Post-intervention interviews evaluated the acceptability of the dietary intervention delivered via telehealth. Secondary outcomes included changes in self-reported body mass, Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), health-related quality of life (EuroQoL-5D), analgesic use and global rating of change. Worthwhile effects were determined by the minimal detectable change (MDC) for all five KOOS-subscales (pain, symptoms, activities of daily living, sport/recreation, quality of life) being contained within the 95% confidence interval. RESULTS: Forty-eight of seventy-three (66%) individuals screened were eligible and 28 enrolled over 2 months (82% female, mean age 66 ± 8 years, body mass index 30.7 ± 4.8 kg.m-2). Six participants withdrew prior to final follow-up (21% drop-out). Of those with final follow-up data, attendance at scheduled telehealth consultations was 99%. Self-reported adherence to diet during the 9-week intervention period: everyday = 27%, most of time = 68% and some of time = 5%. Two minor adverse events were reported. Change scores contained the MDC within the 95% confidence interval for all five KOOS subscales. Suggestions to improve study design and limit drop-out included an initial face-to-face consultation and more comprehensive habitual dietary intake data collection. CONCLUSION: This study supports the feasibility of a full-scale randomised controlled trial to determine the efficacy of a primarily telehealth-delivered anti-inflammatory dietary education intervention in adults with symptomatic knee osteoarthritis.

We examined the effect of flaxseed and anti-inflammatory diet in patients with RA. METHODS: The 12-week intervention was performed on 120 patients with RA who were randomized to three groups of flaxseed (30 g/day) plus anti-inflammatory diet (AIF group), flaxseed (30 g/day) plus regular diet (RF group), and roasted wheat (30 g/day) plus regular diet (RW group). Disease Activity Score 28-joints (DAS28), health assessment questionnaire (HAQ) disability and pain, quality of life, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), rheumatoid factor, and anti-cyclic citrullinated peptides (anti-CCP) were measured before and after trial. Analysis was performed using per-protocol and intention-to-treat (ITT) approaches. RESULTS: One hundred and two patients completed the protocol. Flaxseed decreased DAS28 in RF group compared to RW (- 0.87 ± 1.11 vs. - 0.24 ± 0.78; P = 0.014). Pain severity (P ≤ 0.001), morning stiffness (P < 0.05), and disease feeling (P < 0.01) decreased significantly in AIF and RF groups. HAQ disability and quality of life measurements improved in all 3 groups, with a greater extent in AIF and RF groups (P < 0.001) compared to RW. Between-group differences were significant for DAS28, pain scores, and physical and mental health variables. ESR, CRP, anti-CCP, and rheumatoid factor were not different between groups. Results of ITT analysis did not cause much difference. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, flaxseed may be used as a helpful adjuvant therapy for patients with RA.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) often report impaired health-related quality of life (HrQoL) such as difficulties in daily life, pain, fatigue and an affected social life. Even when lowering disease activity, pharmacological treatment does not always resolve these factors. OBJECTIVE: To investigate if a proposed anti-inflammatory diet improves HrQoL in patients with RA. DESIGN: In this controlled crossover trial, 50 patients were randomized to start with either an intervention diet (anti-inflammatory) or a control diet (usual Swedish intake) for ten weeks followed by a wash out period before switching to the other diet. Participants received food equivalent to ~1100 kcal/day, five days/week, and instructions to consume similarly for the remaining meals. HrQoL was evaluated using Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ), 36-item Short Form Survey (SF-36), Visual Analogue Scales (VAS) for pain, fatigue and morning stiffness, and a time scale for morning stiffness. RESULTS: Forty-seven participants completed ≥1 diet period and were included in the main analyses. No significant difference between intervention and control diet at end of diet periods was observed for any outcome. However, significant improvements were obtained for SF-36 Physical Functioning (mean:5.79, SE: 2.12, 95% CI: 1.58, 10.01) during the intervention diet period. When excluding participants with anti-rheumatic medication changes, the differences between diet periods increased for most outcomes, favoring the intervention diet period, and the difference for SF-36 Physical Functioning became significant (n = 25, mean:7.90, 95% CI:0.56, 15.24, p = 0.036). CONCLUSIONS: In main analyses, the proposed anti-inflammatory diet did not significantly improve HrQoL for patients with RA compared to control diet. In sub-analyses, significant improvements in physical functioning were detected. Larger studies with consistent medication use and in populations more affected by the disease may be needed to obtain conclusive evidence.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: It is unclear to what extent adjuvant dietary intervention can influence inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). OBJECTIVES: The objective was to assess the effects of dietary manipulation on inflammation in patients with RA. METHODS: In a crossover design, participants [n = 50, 78% females, median BMI (in kg/m2) 27, median age 63 y] were randomly assigned to begin with either a 10-wk portfolio diet of proposed anti-inflammatory foods (i.e., a high intake of fatty fish, whole grains, fruits, nuts, and berries) or a control diet resembling a Western diet with a 4-mo washout in between. This report evaluates the secondary outcome markers of inflammation among participants with stable medication. Analyses were performed using a linear mixed ANCOVA model. RESULTS: There were no significant effects on CRP or ESR in the group as a whole. In those with high compliance (n = 29), changes in ESR within the intervention diet period differed significantly compared with changes within the control diet period (mean: -5.490; 95% CI: -10.310, -0.669; P = 0.027). During the intervention diet period, there were lowered serum concentrations of C-X-C motif ligand 1 (CXCL1) (mean: -0.268; 95% CI: -0.452, -0.084;P = 0.006), CXCL5 (mean: -0.278; 95% CI: -0.530, -0.026 P = 0.031), CXCL6 (mean: -0.251; 95% CI: -0.433, -0.069; P = 0.009), and tumor necrosis factor ligand superfamily member 14 (TNFSF14) (mean: -0.139; 95% CI: -0.275, -0.002; P = 0.047) compared with changes within the control diet period. CONCLUSION: A proposed anti-inflammatory diet likely reduced systemic inflammation, as indicated by a decreased ESR in those who completed the study with high compliance (n = 29). These findings warrant further studies to validate our results, and to evaluate the clinical relevance of changes in CXCL1, CXCL5, CXCL6, and TNFSF14 in patients with RA.",

      "abstract": "Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) is an autosomal-dominant hereditary condition associated with germline mutations in the adenomatous polyposis coli gene. Patient management involves prophylactic surgery and intensive life-long endoscopic surveillance. Diet is a major concern for patients with FAP, who are generally free of symptoms before surgery but tend to have issues related to bowel function postoperatively. We hypothesized that a low-inflammatory diet based on the principles and recipes of the Mediterranean diet would reduce markers of local and systemic inflammation. Twenty-eight patients with FAP over 18 years of age who underwent rectum-sparing prophylactic colectomy and were included in our surveillance program participated in a pilot dietary intervention study. Blood and stool samples at baseline (T0), at the end of the dietary intervention (T1, three months), and at the end of the study (T2, six months after T0) were collected. Gastrointestinal inflammation markers including fecal calprotectin, cyclooxygenase-2, and 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase were evaluated. Serum calprotectin, insulin, insulin-like growth factor-1, C-reactive protein, and glycated hemoglobin were also assessed. Significant changes in serum calprotectin, insulin, and insulin-like growth factor-1 levels occurred over time. Borderline significant changes were observed in the neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio. These changes were noticeable immediately at the end of the 3-month active dietary intervention (T1). A significant increase in 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase expression in the normal crypts of matched samples was also observed between T0 and T2. This pilot study supports the hypothesis that a low-inflammatory diet can modulate gastrointestinal markers of inflammation in individuals with FAP. PREVENTION RELEVANCE: Cancer is known to be related to inflammatory conditions. This study suggests that anti-inflammatory dietary intervention may potentially prevent adenomas and cancer in FAP patients by reducing systemic and tissue inflammatory indices.",

The role of nutrition in the respiratory and immune systems has been studied in some studies, and its importance is undeniable. In addition, one of the key findings in this disease is high inflammation that affects almost all patients. This systematic narrative review aims to answer the question, \"Can an anti-inflammatory diet be effective in preventing or treating viral respiratory diseases?\" A systematic review search was used for the articles extraction. All studies published in English from 1999 to 2020 investigating dietary inflammatory conditions and RVI were included. Food items with anti-inflammatory properties were selected based on the definition of the dietary inflammatory index (DII). We used Google Scholar, Pub Med, Scopus, Web of Science, Springer, Science Direct, Directory of Open Access Journals, Elsevier, Taylor and Francis, ProQuest, EBSCO, MEDLINE, and SciELO databases for extracting articles. Keywords were restricted by DII. Based on DII, food items/nutrients are involved in inflammation, some of which have anti-inflammatory and some inflammatory properties. Some foods/nutrients, in addition to their anti-inflammatory properties, have antioxidant, antiviral, and immune-enhancing properties. Considering the immune system's involvement, increased inflammation, and involvement of the pulmonary system in RVI and the remarkable role of the anti-inflammatory foods for counteracting them, it is recommended to use a predominantly anti-inflammatory diet along with prevention/control and treatment protocols. An anti-inflammatory diet (based on DII) includes turmeric, ginger, garlic, onions, saffron, dietary vitamin C, vitamin D, zinc, and omega-3 are recommended to reduce infection symptoms and duration.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Associated with epidemics of obesity, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is becoming the most prevalent liver disease worldwide. The cornerstone of therapy for NAFLD is lifestyle intervention, mainly focused on weight loss. Significant weight loss results from energy-restricted diets, regardless of macronutrient distribution. An anti-inflammatory diet was related to lower odds of NAFLD among daily alcohol drinkers and individuals with metabolic syndrome. This study aims to evaluate the effect of an energy-reduced anti-inflammatory diet on liver status in younger adults with obesity after a 6-month follow-up. METHODS: A two-arm randomized controlled trial surveyed 81 participants' (mean age, 43 years) anthropometric and body composition changes. Metabolic status was determined with glycaemic and lipid status, inflammatory status with hs-CRP, IL-6, and TNF-α, and liver status with liver enzymes, NAFLD-FLS, FLI, and FIB-4 indices. The inflammatory potential of the diet was assessed by the Dietary Inflammatory Index, DII®. RESULTS: Energy-restricted anti-inflammatory diet resulted in significant weight loss (-7.1%, p < 0.001), in reducing the visceral adiposity (-22.3%, p < 0.001), metabolic (HOMA-IR, -15.5%; total cholesterol, -5.3%; LDL-C, -4.6%; triglycerides, -12.2%), and inflammatory biomarkers (hs-CRP, -29.5%; IL-6, -18.2%; TNF-α, -34.2%), with significant improvement of liver parameters (NAFLD-FLS, -143.4%; FLI, -14.3%; FIB-4, -2.5%). CONCLUSION: The study showed the effectiveness of the anti-inflammatory diet with significant improvement of liver parameters in younger adults with obesity, which may reinforce the effectiveness of nutrition-based lifestyle programs, with an anti-inflammatory dietary approach for the treatment and resolution of NAFLD.",

However, prolonged use of anti-inflammatory agents can exert adverse effects on patients. Recently, formulated dietary approach in treating IBD patients is utilized to improve clinical activity scores. An alteration of gastrointestinal microbiota through dietary therapy was found to reduce IBD and is recognized as a promising therapeutic strategy for IBD. One of the recommended formulated diets is an anti-inflammatory diet (AID) that restricts the intake of carbohydrates with modified fatty acids. This diet also contains probiotics and prebiotics that can promote balanced intestinal microbiota composition. However, scientific evidences are limited to support this specific dietary regime in maintaining the remission and prevention relapse of IBD. Therefore, this review aimed to summarize available data from various studies to evaluate the AID diet effectiveness which will be useful for clinicians to manage their IBD patients by application of improved dietary therapy."

We determined changes in body composition and cardiometabolic and inflammatory status of participants with obesity after 24 weeks of a dietary intervention based on an energy-reduced anti-inflammatory diet and examined the relationship of these changes with changes in the inflammatory potential of the diet. The anthropometric and body composition parameters of 81 participants (average age of 43 years, 74 women) were assessed. Metabolic status was determined using the glycemic and lipid statuses, and the cardiometabolic index and inflammatory status were determined using the concentration of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), interleukin 6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α). The inflammatory potential of the diet was assessed using the Dietary Inflammatory Index (DII®). Intervention with an anti-inflammatory diet resulted in a significant reduction in body weight and visceral adipose tissue and caused improvements in the participants' cardiometabolic and inflammatory statuses. The anti-inflammatory diet was shown to be effective regarding obesity management. The study data could advance current scientific knowledge in the field of inflammation and diet, provide guidelines for obesity management, and find its application in routine clinical practice.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Many patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) report symptom relief from certain foods. Earlier research indicates positive effects of food and food components on clinical outcomes in RA, but insufficient evidence exists to provide specific dietary advice. Food components may interact but studies evaluating combined effects are lacking. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to investigate if an anti-inflammatory diet reduces disease activity in patients with RA. METHODS: In this single-blinded crossover trial, 50 patients with RA were randomly assigned to an intervention diet containing a portfolio of suggested anti-inflammatory foods, or a control diet similar to the general dietary intake in Sweden, for 10 wk. After a 4-mo washout period the participants switched diet. Food equivalent to ∼50% of energy requirements was delivered weekly to their homes. For the remaining meals, they were encouraged to consume the same type of foods as the ones provided during each diet. Primary outcome was change in Disease Activity Score in 28 joints-Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (DAS28-ESR). Secondary outcomes were changes in the components of DAS28-ESR (tender and swollen joints, ESR, and visual analog scale for general health) and DAS28-C-reactive protein. RESULTS: In the main analysis, a linear mixed ANCOVA model including the 47 participants completing ≥1 diet period, there was no significant difference in DAS28-ESR between the intervention and control periods (P = 0.116). However, in unadjusted analyses, DAS28-ESR significantly decreased during the intervention period and was significantly lower after the intervention than after the control period in the participants who completed both periods (n = 44; median: 3.05; IQR: 2.41, 3.79 compared with median: 3.27; IQR: 2.69, 4.28; P = 0.04, Wilcoxon's Signed Rank test). No significant differences in the components were observed. CONCLUSIONS: This trial indicates positive effects of a proposed anti-inflammatory diet on disease activity in patients with RA. Additional studies are required to determine if this diet can cause clinically relevant improvements.This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT02941055.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic systemic autoimmune disease that affects synovial joints, leading to inflammation, joint destruction, loss of function, and disability. Although recent pharmaceutical advances have improved treatment of RA, patients with RA often inquire about dietary interventions to improve RA symptoms, as they perceive rapid changes in their symptoms after consumption of certain foods. There is evidence that some ingredients have pro- or anti-inflammatory effects. In addition, recent literature has shown a link between diet and microbiome changes. Both diet and the gut microbiome are linked to circulating metabolites that may modulate inflammation. However, evidence of the effects of an anti-inflammatory and probiotic-rich diet in patients with RA is scarce. There is also a need for biological data to support its anti-inflammatory effects. METHODS: The main goal of this study is to delineate the design process for a diet tailored to our RA population. To achieve this goal, we collected information on diet, supplements, cooking methods, and intake of different ingredients for each patient. Different groups were interviewed, and their feedback was assessed to design a diet that incorporates suggested anti-inflammatory ingredients in a manner that was easy for patients to adopt based on their lifestyles and backgrounds. RESULTS: We designed a diet that includes a high intake of potential anti-inflammatory ingredients. Feedback from highly motivated patients was critical in constructing an anti-inflammatory diet (ITIS diet) with elevated adherence. CONCLUSION: In order to tailor our diet, we surveyed our patients on several different parameters. We obtained important feedback on how feasible our ITIS diet is for RA patients. Using this feedback, we made minor improvements and finalized the design of the ITIS diet. This diet is being used in an on-going pilot study to determine their anti-inflammatory effect in pain and joint swelling in RA patients. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Not applicable."

Dietary patterns have been shown to modulate the inflammatory state, thus highlighting their potential as a therapeutic tool in disorders with an inflammatory basis. Here we conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of current literature addressing whether there is a link between the inflammatory potential of a diet and risk of depression or depressive symptoms. METHODS: A systematic literature search was performed to identify studies that reported an association between the inflammatory potential of the diet and risk of depressive symptoms or diagnosis of depression. Random effect models were used to meta-analyse effect sizes. Quality assessment, publication bias, sensitivity and subgroup analyses were also performed. RESULTS: Eleven studies, with a total of 101,950 participants at baseline (age range: 16-72 years old), were eligible for review. A significant association between a pro-inflammatory diet and increased risk of depression diagnosis or symptoms was evident, relative to those on an anti-inflammatory diet (OR: 1.40, 95% confidence intervals: 1.21-1.62, P < 0.001). No publication bias was detected; however, some study heterogeneity was evident (I2 = 63%, P < 0.001). Subgroup analyses suggested the main source of study heterogeneity was the study design (cross-sectional or longitudinal) and the effect measure used (odds ratio, hazard ratio or relative risk). CONCLUSION: These results provide an association between pro-inflammatory diet and risk of depression. Thus, adopting an anti-inflammatory diet may be an effective intervention or preventative means of reducing depression risk and symptoms.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory disease that affects 0.5-1.0% of the population, and where many patients in spite of modern pharmacological treatment fail to reach remission. This affects physical as well as mental wellbeing and leads to severely reduced quality of life and reduced work capacity, thus yielding high individual as well as societal costs. As a complement to modern pharmacological treatment, lifestyle intervention should be evaluated as a treatment option. Scientific evidence exists for anti-inflammatory effects by single foods on RA, but no study exists where these foods have been combined to obtain maximum effect and thus offer a substantial improvement in patient life quality. The main goal of the randomized cross-over trial ADIRA (Anti-inflammatory Diet In Rheumatoid Arthritis) is to test the hypothesis that an anti-inflammatory diet intervention, compared to a regular diet, will decrease disease activity and improve quality of life in patients with stable established RA. METHODS: In total, 50 RA patients with moderate disease activity are randomized to receive initially either a portfolio diet based on several food items with suggested anti-inflammatory effects or a control diet during 2 × 10 weeks with 3 months wash-out between diets. Food bags are delivered weekly by a home food delivery chain and referred to as the fiber bag and the protein bag, respectively, to partially blind participants. Both groups continue with regular pharmacological treatment. Known food biomarkers will be analyzed to measure intervention compliance. Impact on disease severity (measured by DAS28, a composite score which predicts disability and progression of RA), risk markers for cardiovascular disease and quality of life are evaluated after each diet regimen. Metabolomics will be used to evaluate the potential to predict responders to dietary treatment. A health economic evaluation is also included. DISCUSSION: The nutritional status of patients with RA often is poor and many ask their physician for diet advice. No evidence-based dietary guidelines for patients with RA exist because of the paucity of well-conducted sufficiently large diet intervention trials. ADIRA is an efficacy study and will provide evidence as to whether dietary treatment of RA can reduce disease activity and improve quality of life as well as reduce individual and societal costs.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Obesity and chronic pain are prevalent concerns. Pain is frequently experienced in weight-bearing joints, but is common in other areas of the body as well, suggesting other factors. Poor diet often contributes to obesity and can directly influence the immune system. We have shown that poor diet prolongs recovery from inflammatory injury. Therefore, our goal was to determine whether poor-quality diet-induced consequences could be prevented or reversed by an anti-inflammatory diet (AID). METHODS: A Standard American Diet (SAD) was developed to investigate the effects of poor diet on pain. The SAD includes amounts of refined sugar, carbohydrates and fats that better model the typical American diet, as compared to high-fat diets. We developed an AID to explore whether the effects of the SAD could reverse or whether the AID would enhance recovery prophylactically. The AID was developed using ingredients (epigallocatechin gallate, sulforaphane, resveratrol, curcumin and ginseng) with known anti-inflammatory properties. Following 15 weeks of diet [SAD, AID or regular (REG)] exposure, male and female mice underwent inflammatory injury, at which point some animals had their diets switched for the remainder of the study. RESULTS: Animals who consumed the SAD showed longer recovery compared to the AID- and REG-fed animals. Animals switched off the SAD had faster recovery times, with AID-fed animals recovering as fast as REG-fed animals. CONCLUSIONS: Poor diet prolonged recovery from inflammatory injury. Substitution of SAD with AID or REG promoted faster recovery. These findings suggest diet can be used as a non-pharmacological intervention following injury. SIGNIFICANCE: Obesity may increase susceptibility to chronic pain often due to poor diet. Diet has potential to be used as treatment for pain. This study investigates the use of a novel translatable diet to act as a preventative (i.e. prior to surgery) or an intervention (i.e. following an injury).",

      "abstract": "PROBLEM: To address the complex phenomenon of pediatric obesity, one must understand the physiological mechanisms regulating energy intake and inflammation. The peptide hormones leptin, ghrelin, and adiponectin are involved in both, but their functions are dysregulated in obesity. The purpose of this systematic review is (1) to characterize studies of nutrition interventions for weight management in children who measure these peptides as outcomes, (2) to assess risk of bias in the studies, and (3) to determine the relationships between these peptides and body mass index (BMI). Eligibility Criteria: Peer-reviewed articles written in English, published in 2001-2016, and describing randomized controlled trials of pediatric interventions involving a nutrition component with the outcome measures leptin, ghrelin, and/or adiponectin were included. Articles were excluded if the intervention involved pharmaceuticals, supplements, infant formula, breastfeeding, or surgery. SAMPLE: The 25 international studies represented 2,153 obese children. RESULTS: Ten diets were identified. Successful interventions included both structured exercise and hypocaloric dietary components, with or without counseling, resistance training, or medical components. Direct measures of adiposity were used in 69% of studies. Comparison group designs were disparate. Leptin levels decreased as BMI decreased. Evidence regarding the relationships of ghrelin and adiponectin with BMI was inconclusive. CONCLUSIONS: Despite known effects of maturation on hormones, studies did not consistently differentiate findings by maturational stage. Common anti-inflammatory and disease risk modification diets were missing or underrepresented. Studies that include children with comorbidities are needed. BMI and leptin levels have a positive relationship, but evidence on ghrelin and adiponectin was inconclusive.",

METHODS: During 2001-2002, 3042 healthy adults (1514 men and 1528 women) living in the greater area of Athens were voluntarily recruited to the ATTICA study. In 2011-2012, the 10-year follow-up was performed in 2583 participants (15% of the participants were lost to follow-up). Incidence of fatal or non-fatal CVD event was recorded using WHO-ICD-10 criteria and MetS was defined by the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment panel III (revised) definition. A proxy dietary anti-inflammatory index (D-AII) score computed using participants' diet records. RESULTS: The 10-year fatal or non-fatal CVD event rate was 157 cases/1000 participants. After adjusting for several confounding factors, an anti-inflammatory diet, as expressed by higher DII scores, was borderline associated with 10-year CVD incidence (OR3rd tertile vs. 1st tertile=0.98, 95%CI: 0.96-1.01). This inverse association was also verified among participants without MetS at baseline (OR3rd tertile vs. 1st tertile=0.97, 95%CI: 0.94-0.99), but not among participants with the MetS. CONCLUSIONS: Results of the present work verified the protective effect of an anti-inflammatory diet towards the 10-year CVD incidence among participants without MetS. In contrast, the presence of MetS already at baseline seemed to impede this anti-inflammatory diet protective effect, which underlines the independent importance of MetS on CVD risk.",

METHODS: Forty patients with IBD were consecutively offered the IBD-AID to help treat their disease, and were retrospectively reviewed. Medical records of 11 of those patients underwent further review to determine changes in the Harvey Bradshaw Index (HBI) or Modified Truelove and Witts Severity Index (MTLWSI), before and after the diet. RESULTS: Of the 40 patients with IBD, 13 patients chose not to attempt the diet (33%). Twenty-four patients had either a good or very good response after reaching compliance (60%), and 3 patients' results were mixed (7%). Of those 11 adult patients who underwent further medical record review, 8 with CD, and 3 with UC, the age range was 19-70 years, and they followed the diet for 4 or more weeks. After following the IBD-AID, all (100%) patients were able to discontinue at least one of their prior IBD medications, and all patients had symptom reduction including bowel frequency. The mean baseline HBI was 11 (range 1-20), and the mean follow-up score was 1.5 (range 0-3). The mean baseline MTLWSI was 7 (range 6-8), and the mean follow-up score was 0. The average decrease in the HBI was 9.5 and the average decrease in the MTLWSI was 7. CONCLUSION: This case series indicates potential for the IBD-AID as an adjunct dietary therapy for the treatment of IBD. A randomized clinical trial is warranted.",
