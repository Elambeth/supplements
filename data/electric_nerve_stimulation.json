      "abstract": "This study aimed to evaluate and compare the effectiveness of transcutaneous electric nerve stimulation (TENS) and photobiostimulation using diode LASER, prior to local anaesthesia administration in children undergoing bilateral orthodontic extractions. A split-mouth, parallel arm, Double blinded, randomized clinical trial was conducted on children (12 - 16 yrs) undergoing bilateral orthodontic extractions. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either TENS or PBST. Subjective and Objective parameters for anxiety and pain were assessed, and evaluated for statistical significance (p < 0.05). In this study with 104 patients (mean age 13.59), the TENS group showed significantly lower mean pain scores (WBPRS) for needle insertion (2.30 ± 2.7) versus PBST (5.03 ± 3.1, p < 0.01), LA administration (2.11 ± 2.8 vs. 4.84 ± 2.7, p < 0.01), and extraction (1.92 ± 2.6 vs. 3.23 ± 5.1, p < 0.01). TENS also led to a faster onset of local anesthesia (96.15 s ± 13.9) compared to PBST (155.38 s ± 91, p < 0.05), indicating enhanced efficacy for pain reduction and anesthesia speed. Physiological parameters like pulse rate and salivary pH also showed significant improvements with TENS. Hence TENS and PBST both came out as effective alternatives for topical anesthesia. Both TENS and PBST proved to be effective alternatives to topical anesthesia, TENS therapy with the Synapse Dental Pain Eraser (DPE) demonstrated greater effectiveness in reducing pain and anxiety, reflecting it as a promising option for pediatric patients. However further research is needed to refine and optimize pain management strategies using these alternatives in pediatric dentistry.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We collected data from three databases, PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science, covering the earliest available date to April 2024, with a focus on randomized controlled trials that utilized TENS as an intervention for limb motor dysfunction after stroke, and extracted the main evaluation indicators before and after treatment, including the Fugl-Meyer Assessment for Upper Extremity (FMA-UE), Functional Independence Measure (FIM), and Composite Spasticity Scale (CSS). Meta-analysis was conducted using Review Manager 5.4.1 software. RESULTS: This systematic review included a total of 513 participants from 10 studies. The analysis revealed that TENS was found to be statistically more effective than sham TENS in improving upper limb function, with a standardized mean difference (MD) of 3.58 (95% CI: 0.88, 6.27). CONCLUSION: TENS has shown potential in improving limb motor function in post-stroke patients based on FMA-UE, FIM, and CSS scores. However, variations in stimulation frequency, sites, treatment schedules, and devices make the evidence insufficient for its reliable clinical use. UNLABELLED: Registration: CRD42023421759."

There are different reasons that lead to an episiotomy; however, it is recommended to be performed occasionally and not systematically, since it may produce negative effects such as pain. Different therapies have been described to reduce this pain, including transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS). OBJECTIVE: To conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis about the effects of Transcutaneous Electric Nerve Stimulation (TENS) on pain after episiotomy. METHODS: The databases PubMed, Cochrane, Scopus, Cinhal, PEDro and Web of Science were consulted using the terms \"Episiotomy\" and \"Transcutaneous Electric Nerve Stimulation\". The methodological quality was analyzed with the PEDro scale. A random-effects model was used to carry out the meta-analysis. FINDINGS: 88 studies were obtained and after applying the selection criteria, 6 were included in the systematic review and 5 in the meta-analysis. There were significant positive effects in decreasing the pain for TENS in comparison with pre-intervention (SMD = 1.19 [95 % CI - 0.33 to 2.05]; p < 0.01; I2 = 96 %), control group (SMD = -1.07 [95 % CI - -1.53 to -0.6]; p < 0.01; I2 = 82 %) and placebo group (SMD = -1.33 [95 % CI - -2.32 to -0.34]; p < 0.01; I2 = 86 %). CONCLUSION: TENS appears to have a positive effect in reducing pain after 1 h of an episiotomy. The location of the electrodes does not seem to be relevant in the effects."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Overactive bladder (OAB) is the most prevalent lower urinary tract dysfunction among children. Refractory OAB lacks response to the first line treatments, including anticholinergic, and it is a major clinical challenge. This study aims to compare the efficacy of para-sacral transcutaneous electric nerve stimulation (PS-TENS) in the treatment of primary and refractory OAB among children. METHODS: A prospective, randomized clinical study included 64 children aged 5-12 years with OAB divided equally into two groups: group (1) included 32 children with treatment-naive OAB, while group (2) included 32 children with refractory OAB who failed complete course of anticholinergics. Both groups received PS-TENS three times weekly for 12 weeks. Detailed medical history, voiding diary, ultrasound, and uroflowmetry with EMG were performed at baseline and after 12 weeks of treatment. Filling cystometry was performed for children with refractory OAB before and after PS-TENS. RESULTS: After the end of treatment the number of children with urge incontinence decreased significantly among the two groups: from 25 to 13 and 27 to 15 for the primary and refractory groups, respectively. Micturition frequency per 24 h decreased significantly among children with primary OAB. Bladder capacity increased significantly and the resting detrusor pressure decreased significantly among children with refractory OAB. CONCLUSIONS: PS-TENS is an effective and safe treatment option for children with OAB. The magnitude of improvement is higher among children with primary as compared to refractory OAB.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Oesophagogastroduodenoscopy (OGDS) is the most common diagnostic procedure for upper gastrointestinal diseases. It often causes discomfort and anxiety, which are only mitigated by systemic sedation. However, sedation poses additional risks of adverse cardiopulmonary events, increased medical costs, and prolonged recovery. Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation of acupuncture points (Acu-TENS) is a non-invasive and innovative approach that induces analgesic effect during endoscopy. This trial is the first to be reported in English that explores the potential of Acu-TENS to increase patient tolerance during non-sedated elective diagnostic OGDS. METHODS: A double-blinded randomized controlled trial involving 348 subjects was conducted at a tertiary hospital to evaluate the success rate of OGDS with Acu-TENS. Subjects aged 18-75 years scheduled for their first elective diagnostic OGDS were randomized into the intervention (Acu-TENS) and placebo arms. OGDS success was assessed based on subjects' satisfaction ratings on a Likert scale and procedure's technical adequacy. Secondary measures included subjects' willingness to undergo future OGDS under similar conditions, procedure duration, and the endoscopist's perceived ease of the procedure. RESULTS: OGDS success rates were significantly higher with Acu-TENS (77.8%) than with the placebo (68.0%; odds ratio [OR] 1.64, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.01-2.66, p = 0.043). Subjects who received Acu-TENS expressed higher willingness for future OGDS (78.9%) than those who received the placebo (68.6%; OR 1.71, 95% CI 1.04-2.79, p = 0.031). Procedure duration were significantly shorter in the intervention arm (6.0 min) than in the placebo arm (10.0 min; p = 0.002). No adverse effects were reported, and endoscopists perceived similar procedure ease in both arms. CONCLUSIONS: Acu-TENS improved OGDS success and enhanced patients' experiences during non-sedated OGDS. It demonstrated safety with no side effects and reduced the procedure completion time. It could be used as an adjunct in non-sedated diagnostic OGDS.",

      "abstract": "IMPORTANCE: Office bladder chemodenervation, performed via cystoscopy with intradetrusor onabotulinumtoxinA (BOTOX) injections, is a common treatment for overactive bladder/urge urinary incontinence. Transcutaneous electric nerve stimulation (TENS) has shown to provide analgesia during office hysteroscopy. Adjuvant analgesia using TENS during bladder chemodenervation has not been studied. OBJECTIVE: The primary outcome is a clinically significant (10-mm) difference in pain visual analog scale (VAS) measurements during injections for chemodenervation using active TENS compared with placebo TENS. We hypothesize that active TENS use will significantly change pain VAS scores. Secondary outcomes include 5-point pain Likert scale, satisfaction 10-point scale, and adverse events. STUDY DESIGN: This was a double-blind randomized control trial of men and women with urinary urge incontinence undergoing office chemodenervation performed in an academic and private setting. Participants were randomized into 2 groups: chemodenervation with active TENS or placebo TENS. Power calculation determined 100 patients would be required detect a difference of 10 mm on pain VAS. RESULTS: One hundred one (85 female and 16 male) participants were recruited. No differences were noted in the demographics. Participants in the active TENS group reported a difference of greater than 10 mm in pain VAS scores (48 ± 23 vs 31 ± 23, P = 0.01). Satisfaction index scores were high but no difference was noted between groups (8.6 vs 8.7, P = 0.68). CONCLUSIONS: Most participants were eligible to use TENS units. Transcutaneous electric nerve stimulation is a safe and noninvasive adjuvant analgesia option for patients undergoing this procedure. Lower pain levels and high satisfaction rates suggest that this is an additional analgesic option during outpatient chemodenervation.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Insomnia disorder is a common condition with considerable harmful effects on health. We investigated the therapeutic efficacy and safety of low-frequency transcutaneous electric nerve stimulation (LF-TENS) as an alternative treatment option for insomnia disorder. METHODS: A 4-week, multi-center, randomized controlled study was conducted. A total of 160 individuals aged 40 to 80 years with insomnia disorder were included and randomized to the experimental group receiving active device (n=81) or control group receiving sham device (n=79). Both groups used the device for four weeks, more than five days a week. The participants also completed pre- and post-intervention assessment with questionnaires, sleep diaries, wrist actigraphy, and blood tests. RESULTS: There was no significant between-group difference in the changes of mood and sleep parameters and blood test results among the two study groups. Meanwhile, in the exploratory sub-group analysis of patients aged over 60 years, the experimental group showed better improvement after intervention in the change of Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score (-2.63±3.25 vs. -1.20±2.28, p=0.039; Cohen's d=0.99 vs. 0.45) and blood cortisol level (-1.65±3.37 μg/dL vs. -0.16±3.49 μg/dL, p=0.007; Cohen's d=0.56 vs. 0.05). In addition, no serious adverse reaction occurred during the study period in both groups. CONCLUSION: The effect of LF-TENS was limited to older patients aged over 60 years, which might be related to the modulation of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis activity."

Treating obesity is a task that requires multidisciplinary care; however, in many cases, conventional therapy has no effect, requiring surgical intervention. This, in turn, is not without risks and causes important changes in lung function. Therefore, the aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of electroanalgesia through conventional transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) on the pain and lung function in the postoperative period of bariatric surgery. METHODS: This is a controlled and blinded clinical trial with 66 subjects who underwent bariatric surgery. The participants were randomized into 2 groups as follows: an intervention group treated with TENS (n = 33) and a placebo group (n = 33). The participants underwent 4 TENS sessions, and the effect on pain was assessed using a visual analogue scale (VAS pain). Lung function was measured by spirometry. RESULTS: There were no differences between the 2 groups regarding time of surgery and time of mechanical ventilation. Compared to placebo, TENS reduced pain in the intervention group (p = 0.001). Regarding the effect of electroanalgesia on pulmonary function, the spirometric parameters were similar between the groups. However, regarding muscle strength between the preoperative and postoperative periods, maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP) was maintained in the intervention group and decreased in the placebo group (p = 0.03). Compared with that in the intervention group, the respiratory rate in the placebo group increased during the application of TENS (p = 0.003). CONCLUSION: Electroanalgesia reduces pain in patients who underwent bariatric surgery. Importantly, in these patients, the MIP is maintained between the preoperative and postoperative periods. However, electroanalgesia does not contribute to improvements in spirometric data. This trial is registered with NCT04800640."

Group (A), contains twenty participants who received routine medical care and dressing. As for group (B), includes twenty participants who obtained high-frequency TENS; Frequency (80-120) HZ, Intensity (15 - 30 amp), Pulse duration 250 Micro sec, 60 min per session with routine medical care and dressing. The third group (c) L-TENS, encompasses twenty participants who received low-frequency TENS (1-5) HZ; Intensity (30 -80 amp), Pulse duration 250 Micro sec, 60 min per session with routine medical care and dressing. All the participants were examined before and after two months of intervention; four weeks (post1), then after eight weeks (post2). Participants were examined by using (image j) to measure the ulcer area. Saline was used for measuring the ulcer volume, and a visual analog scale was adopted to evaluate pain. After drawing a comparison among the three groups after four weeks and after eight weeks of treatment, a statistically significant decrease (P <0.05) in wound surface area, wound volume, and pain in favor of L-TENS was noticed. It has been found that L- TENS is more effective than H -TENS and is highly recommended in the treatment protocol for such debilitating conditions."

Due to the nature of nursing work, this problem is often seen in nurses, including those who work in the operating rooms. Depending on the cause, there are various surgical and non-surgical methods to treat LBP. The present study was aimed to compare the effect of two therapeutic methods of back exercises and transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) on the disability and pain of operating room nurses with LBP. METHODS: In this clinical trial forty-four eligible operating room nurses (30 women, 14 men, mean age: 37.86 ± 6.74) with chronic nonspecific LBP were randomly assigned to back exercises (including the strengthening and stretching exercise (n = 22)) or TENS (n = 22) groups by permuted block randomization method. These interventions were performed in both groups three sessions of 15 min per week for 6 weeks. The McGill pain questionnaire for back pain and the Oswestry disability questionnaire for disability assessment were completed immediately before and after the interventions. RESULTS: After 6 weeks, the mean of pain and disability decreased significantly in both groups compared to the baseline. Based on the results, significant decreases in the pain score (mean difference (95% CI): - 8.95 (- 12.77 to - 5.14); P-value < 0.001) and disability score (mean difference (95% CI): - 8.73(- 12.42 to - 5.03); P-value < 0.001) were revealed in the back exercises group after the intervention compared to the baseline. In addition, after the intervention in TENS group, the mean pain intensity and disability showed significant decrease, respectively (mean difference (95% CI): - 16.18 (- 19.81 to - 12.55); P-value < 0.001; mean difference (95% CI): - 15.82 (- 19.24 to - 12.40); P-value < 0.001). After adjusting for the baseline values, the TENS group had a significantly higher pain score reduction than the back exercises group (mean difference (95% CI): - 4.23 (- 8.03 to - 0.44); P-value =0.030; Cohen's d = 0.81). In addition, TENS led to a significant more decrease in the disability scores compared to the back exercises (mean difference (95% CI): - 3.99 (- 7.35 to - 0.64); P-value =0.021; Cohen's d = 0.73). Furthermore, a statistically significant time by group interaction effect on pain and disability score was found (interaction p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Pain and disability were improved in both groups following 18 intervention sessions. However, pain and disability were improved to a greater extent in the TENS group than in the back exercises group.

Nevertheless, though shoulder TENS used for treating adhesive capsulitis could affect vagal tone, its potential impact on heart functions remains unclear. In this study, electrocardiogram (ECG) and heart rate (HR) of subjects in response to sham, right-sided, or left-sided shoulder TENS (TENS-S, TENS-R, and TENS-L, respectively; 5 min) were recorded and analyzed. During the stimulation period, TENS-R constantly and TENS-L transiently decreased the HR of subjects; both TENS-R and TENS-L increased powers of the low- and high-frequency spectra. While TENS-R exhibiting no effect, TENS-L increased the ratio of low/high-frequency power spectrum indicating TENS-R decreased the HR through potentiating cardiac vagal tone. Collectively, these results suggest TENS could be an early and non-invasive therapy for heart failure patients before considering implant devices or devices are not feasible; moreover, therapists/physicians need to carefully monitor the potential adverse events during treatment for patient safety.Trial registration: The study protocol was registered in ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03982472; 11/06/2019).",

We conducted an umbrella review to summarize the evidence and evaluate the effectiveness of ENS for OAB by using an umbrella review methodology from multiple perspectives with sufficient methodological quality. We searched the PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, CINAHL and PsycINFO databases and two Chinese databases (CNKI and CBM) to identify articles written in English or Chinese that were published up to 15 February 2021. Two authors of this review independently selected the studies, assessed their quality, and extracted the data from all the included studies. We performed a quality assessment of eligible reviews using the AMSTAR 2.0 tool and estimated the summary effect size, 95% confidence intervals, 95% prediction intervals and heterogeneity. Ten systematic reviews and meta-analyses covering 89 randomized controlled trials and 16 prospective cohort studies with a total population of 5004 participants that investigated the effect of ENS for OAB in terms of 17 different outcomes were identified. ENS seems effective and safety for OAB, with our results showing weak evidence of clinical efficacy and no evidence of side effects. To recommend ENS as a practical treatment option for OAB, however, more high-quality research is needed.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy of low-level laser therapy (LLLT) with different wavelengths and transcutaneous electric nerve stimulation (TENS) and explore the optimal wavelength range of laser application in the treatment of pain caused by temporomandibular disorders (TMD). METHODS: An electronic search on PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase, Scopus and Web of Science was undertaken to identify the randomised clinical trials (RCTs) published from database inception to 16 April 2021, aiming to compare the effects of LLLT with different wavelengths (632.8-672 nm, 780-904 nm, and 910-1100 nm) or TENS or placebo group on TMD patients pain reduction. In addition, manual search of the studies was performed. The reviewers assessed the risk of bias of individual studies with the Cochrane risk of bias tool and excluded the RCTs with a high risk of bias in any field. Meanwhile, the reviewers, after performing the network meta-analysis, assessed the quality of evidence, which contributed to network estimate via the GRADE framework. RESULTS: Twenty-seven RCTs with 969 patients with TMD were included. In the meta-analysis, all treatment groups showed an overall improvement in pain scores, when compared with the placebo group. LLLT with wavelength ranging from 910 nm to 1100 nm produced more pain relief in the visual analogue scale (VAS) immediately after treatment [mean difference (MD) = 4.68, 95% confidence interval (CI):(3.08,6.28)]. After one-month follow-up, LLLT with wavelength ranging from 910 nm to 1100 nm also showed superior pain-relieving effects [MD = 3.61, 95% CI: (-1.77, 8.99)]. However, no significant difference was observed. Based on the SUCRA ranking, L3 ranked first immediately after treatment and 1 month later. CONCLUSION: The results of the meta-analysis showed the LLLT had better short-term efficacy than TENS in the treatment of pain caused by TMD. Better results can be achieved with higher wavelengths. Therefore, we recommended to treat TMD using LLLT with wavelength ranging from 910 nm to 1100 nm.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Hemiplegic Shoulder pain (HSP) is a common clinical consequence of focal cerebral insult. The study investigated the comparative efficacy of Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (TENS) and Soft Tissue Massage (STM) in the management HSP. METHOD: A total of 50 consenting stroke patients with HSP completed the 8 weeks pretest posttest quasi-experimental study. They were assigned into either TENS or STM groups using simple random sampling. Both TENS and STM treatments were administered on subscapularis, supraspinatus and posterior deltoid muscles for 16 sessions. HSP was evaluated pre and post intervention with visual analog scale. Within and between group differences in HSP were compared using paired and unpaired t-tests respectively with SPSS version 16.0 with probability level of 0.05 to indicate level of significance. RESULTS: The age of patients in the TENS and STM groups was 56±9.26years and 57±7.51years respectively. Duration of stroke was 10±6 months and 9±4 months for TENS and STM groups respectively. There was no significant between group differences in HSP at baseline (TENS=4.76±2.17; STM=5.48±2.06; p>0.05). Within group comparison of HSP scores pre and post intervention in the TENS group indicated a significant reduction (P<0.05); also the same applies to STM group (P<0.05). When the post treatment HPS scores were compared across the groups, there was a significant difference in favor of TENS group (TENS=1.48±0.51; STM=2.12±1.17; p<0.05). CONCLUSION: Both TENS and STM contribute to the modulation of HSP in stroke patients and both could become handy in augmenting other forms of management. However TENS is more effective.",

Most often it leads to individuals avoiding visiting the dentist until physical pain completely impairs the quality of life. OBJECTIVES: Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) is a method of pain relief involving the use of a mild electrical current. The main aim of this study was to examine whether the TENS device affects the reduction of anxiety and fear during dental procedures. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study was conducted on a sample of 125 respondents, aged 9-14 years. Statistical significance of differences between pre- and post-treatment results on all applied measuring instruments was verified by the t-test for dependent samples. The calculation was performed for all respondents and individually for the three observed groups. The Children`s Fear Survey Schedule - Dental Subscale test was used to assess anxiety and fear. RESULTS: The results on the CFSS-DS scale in all subjects did not differ statistically significantly before and after treatment (p > 0.05). The results on the CFSS-DS scale in subjects who received TENS were statistically significantly different before and after treatment (p < 0.01). The results on the CFSS-DS scale in subjects who received local anesthesia were statistically significantly different before and after treatment (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The TENS device had an anxiolytic effect after the first visit."

      "abstract": "In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, we evaluated the role of transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) in the multimodal treatment (nonopioid analgesics and kinesiotherapy) of postoperative pain following open inguinal hernia repair. In total, 80 males participants with elective primary unilateral hernia Lichtenstein repair were randomly allocated to receive TENS or a placebo-TENS procedure. The TENS group received local and segmental conventional TENS on the first and second postoperative days. In the placebo-TENS group, intensity was set at 0 to 0.5mA. Change of pain level at rest, when walking, when standing up from bed, pressure algometry parameters and additional analgesic use were the main outcomes. Reduction of VAS pain score and absolute and relative pain relief were observed in the TENS group following the procedures compared to the placebo-TENS group (P< .001). The pressure pain threshold and maximal tolerable pressure in the hernia side were equal before the TENS procedure in both groups (P= .84), but after the procedure, these were higher in TENS group (P< .001). Additional nonopioid analgesics requirements were lower in the TENS group on the first and second postoperative days (P< .001). TENS is a safe procedure that can reduce postoperative pain and analgesic use after open inguinal hernia repair. The study was registered in the database of clinicaltrials.gov (register number NCT03739060). PERSPECTIVE: This article presents TENS as a safe and effective nonpharmacologic intervention to reduce postoperative pain after open inguinal hernia repair. TENS could be used in daily practice as part of a multimodal postoperative pain treatment, especially for patients suffering from hyperalgesia.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Temporomandibular disorders (TMDs) are a heterogeneous group of pathologies affecting the temporomandibular joint (TMJ), the jaw muscles, or both. Epidemiological studies of TMD reveal a prevalence of 82% in the general population with 48% of them presenting with clinical features of muscle tenderness and difficulty in mouth opening. TMD are considered to be the most common orofacial pain conditions of nondental origin. METHODS: The patients with TMD were randomly divided into two groups, A and B, based on their VAS scale. Group A consists of two subgroups 1 and 2 each consisting of 15 patients. Group B consists of two subgroups 3 and 4 consisting of 15 patients. Patients in Group A were given TENS for twenty minutes, and the frequency is adjusted as follows: (i) subgroup 1: TENS frequency at a range of 0-5 (VAS measuring 1-5) and (ii) subgroup 2: TENS frequency at a range of 5 and above (VAS measuring 6-10). Patients in Group B were given MENS for twenty minutes, and the frequency adjusted as follows: (i) subgroup 3: MENS frequency at range of 0-5 (VAS measuring 1-5) and (ii) subgroup 4: MENS frequency at a range of 5 and above (VAS measuring 6-10). Each patient was recalled for five consecutive days for the treatment, and the same intensity and frequency were maintained throughout the treatment period. RESULTS: The improvement in VAS is seen to be highly significant statistically in MENS subgroup 4 (moderate-to-severe pain). Subgroups 1 and 3 had improvement in VAS which was comparable in both TENS and MENS groups. CONCLUSION: In the present study, it was found that TENS and MENS are equally effective in improving the functional mouth opening. MENS showed better and immediate effect in relief of pain. Microcurrent also has the advantage of being subthreshold, and hence the side effects such as tingling sensation and paresthesia seen to occur in some patients following TENS are absent. TENS and MENS can be considered as the first line of treatment in patients with acute and chronic masticatory muscle pain and also as an effective treatment option in cases of functional mouth opening.",

Twelve men with PE and no prior treatment were enrolled, one was withdrawn and 11 subjects provided data for the main outcome. TPTNS consisted of 30-min sessions of the application of 20 Hz with a pulse amplitude of 200 µsec. The intensity was adjusted based on individual sensibility. The participants received 3 weekly sessions for 12 consecutive weeks. Follow-up continued for 9 months after therapy completion. The main outcome was a threefold increase in the intravaginal ejaculation latency time (IELT) at week 12. Eleven patients completed therapy, and 54.5% (p = 0.037) showed tripled baseline IELT scores at week 12. The IELT increased 4.8-fold, 6.8-fold, and 5.4-fold at weeks 12, 24, and 48, respectively. One episode of constipation was reported, and one patient reported a sensation of heat in the leg during one therapy session. The findings suggest that TPTNS therapy delays ejaculation in patients with lifelong premature ejaculation, with no serious secondary effects. Controlled trials with larger sample sizes are needed to verify these results.",

Methods We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, CENTRAL, CINAHL and PsycINFO (inception to May 2018) for randomised placebo controlled trials. The primary outcome measure was pain relief in the immediate term (within 2-weeks of administration) assessed using the 100 mm visual analogue scale. A mean difference of at least 10 points on the 100-point pain scale was considered clinically significant. Methodological quality of the eligible studies was assessed using the PEDro scale and overall quality assessment rating was assessed using GRADE.

One low quality trial (n = 63) provides low quality evidence that ~30 min treatment with TENS in an emergency-care setting provides clinically worthwhile pain relief for moderate to severe acute LBP in the immediate term compared with sham TENS [Mean Difference (MD) - 28.0 (95% CI - 32.7, -23.3)]. Two other studies which administered a course of TENS over 4-5 weeks, in more usual settings provide inconclusive evidence; MD -2.75 (95% CI -11.63, 6.13). There was limited data on adverse events or long term follow-up. Conclusions The current evidence is insufficient to support or dismiss the use of TENS for acute LBP. Implications There is insufficient evidence to guide the use of TENS for acute LBP. There is low quality evidence of moderate improvements in pain with a short course of TENS (~30 min) during emergency transport of patients to the hospital. Future research should evaluate whether TENS has an opioid sparing role in the management of acute LBP.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: At present, drug therapy for diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-D) has made great progress; however, it does not often produce a satisfying curative effect. Transcutaneous electric nerve stimulation over acupoints (Acu-TENS) might be more effective in improving patient's symptoms and producing fewer side-effects as a result.Although with a great progress of the drug therapy for IBS-D, it is often hard to achieve its satisfactory curative effect. Acu-TENS that may be effective to improve patients' symptoms and fewer side-effects will be sought. There is no systematic review concerning the efficacy of Acu-TENS for IBS-D published. Therefore, this review aims to systematically evaluate the efficacy of Acu-TENS on IBS-D. METHODS: Four English (PubMed, EMBASE, The Cochrane Library, Web of Science) and 4 Chinese electronic databases (Biomedical Literature Database, CNKI, VIP, Wanfang Database) will be searched from their inception to November 26, 2018. Randomized controlled trials that evaluated the effect of Acu-TENS on patients with IBS-D will be included. The primary outcome measures will include average weekly stool frequency, visual analog scale (VAS), and the Bristol scale. The secondary outcome measures will include the MOS 36-item short-form health survey (SF-36), IBS Quality of Life Questionnaire (IBS-QOL), severity of IBS symptoms (IBS-SSS), and rectal perception. Quality evaluation and data extraction will be independently undertaken, respectively. The data from the eligible trials will be analyzed by RevMan5.3. RESULTS: For patients with IBS-D, this systematic review will provide evidences related to the efficacy of Acu-TENS in these evaluation aspects, stool frequency, VAS and the Bristol scale, SF-36, IBS-QOL, IBS-SSS, and rectal perception. CONCLUSION: This evidence may be useful to medical workers with regard to the use of Acu-TENS in the treatment of IBS-D.PROSPERO registration number: PROSPERO CRD442018109294.",

METHODS: Individuals with functional constipation will be randomly allocated to receive either EA or TENS (n = 51, each), 3 times per week for 8 weeks. The primary outcome is the percentage of participants with an average increase from baseline of 1 or more complete spontaneous bowel movements at week 8. The secondary outcome measures are the following: at the time of visits, changes in the number of complete spontaneous bowel movements, number of spontaneous bowel movements, stool character, difficulty in defecation, patients' assessment of quality of life regarding constipation (self-report questionnaire), and use of auxiliary defecation methods. DISCUSSION: The results of this trial should verify whether EA is more efficacious than TENS for relieving symptoms of functional constipation.

There are multiple etiologies, and several types of treatment have been reported. The use of non-invasive and reversible therapies in the treatment of such problems is recommended. The present study evaluated the effect of low-level laser (LLL) therapy and transcutaneous electric nerve stimulation (TENS) on TMDs. Methods: In this single-blind study, 40 patients with temporomandibular disorders were randomly divided into four groups: TENS (TENSTem dental), LLL (diode 810 nm CW), shamTENS, and sham-LLL. All subjects were examined and data on pain and tenderness in the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) and masticatory muscles (using the visual analogue scale) and mouth-opening (distance between incisal edges before feeling pain; mm) were collected before baseline (T1), after each session (T2-T5) and one month after the end of the sessions (T6)), and analyzed using repeated measure analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Bonferroni statistical tests. A P value < 0.05 was considered significant. Results: The decrease in pain (P=0.000), tenderness (P=0.000) and increase in mouth-opening ability (P=0.002) was greater in the TENS and LLL groups than in the placebo groups. At the one-month follow-up, significant decrease in pain and tenderness was recorded in the TENS and LLL groups (P=0.000). There was no significant differences between TENS and LLL and the placebo groups for maximum mouth-opening at the end of the study (P=0.692). Conclusion: Using TENS or LLL therapy can improve TMD symptoms at least for the short term. Although the effects of the placebo played a role in improving symptoms, their effects were less important."

However, there is a lack of well-constructed clinical trials investigating the effect of TENS after total knee arthroplasty (TKA). In addition, previous investigations reported that low- and high-frequency TENSs produced analgesic tolerance after 4 or 5 days of treatment. The aim of this study is to explore the effect of burst TENS on pain during hospitalization after TKA and to investigate whether burst TENS produces analgesic tolerance after 4 or 5 days of treatment. This stratified, triple blind, randomized controlled trial was approved by the University Hospital Brussels. Sixty-eight subjects were screened for eligibility before surgery; 54 were found eligible and 53 were included in the analyses. Patients were allocated to either a burst TENS or sham burst TENS group. TENS was applied daily during continuous passive mobilization. Knee pain intensity, knee range of motion, and analgesic consumption were assessed daily. Patients received burst TENS (N = 25) or sham burst TENS (N = 28). No significant differences in knee pain intensity were found between the groups (p > 0.05). Within the TENS and the sham TENS groups, the difference in knee pain before and after treatment did not evolve over time (p > 0.05). This study found no effects of burst TENS compared with sham burst TENS on pain during hospitalization after TKA.",

PURPOSE: To assess the effectiveness of extraoral transcutaneous electric nerve stimulation (TENS) as a mean of stimulating salivary function in healthy adult subjects; as well as to determine the gender and age-dependent changes in salivary flow rates of unstimulated and stimulated parotid saliva. MATERIALS AND METHOD: Hundred patients were divided into two groups; Group I aged 20-40 and Group II aged ≥ 60 years. The TENS electrode pads were externally placed on the skin overlying the parotid glands. Unstimulated and stimulated parotid saliva was collected for 5 minutes each by using standardized collection techniques. RESULTS: Eighty seven of 100 subjects demonstrated increased salivary flow when stimulated via the TENS unit. Ten experienced no increase and 3 experienced a decrease. The mean unstimulated salivary flow rate was 0.01872 ml/min in Group I and 0.0088 ml/min in Group II. The mean stimulated salivary flow rate was 0.03084 ml/min (SD= 0.01248) in Group I, and 0.01556 ml/min (SD 0.0101) in Group II. After stimulation, the amount of salivary flow increased significantly in both groups (p< 0.001). Statistical comparison of the two groups revealed them to be significantly different (p< 0.001), with Group I producing more saliva. Gender-wise, no statistically significant difference was seen among the subjects in Group I (p = 0.148), and those in Group II (p= 0.448). Out of 12 subjects with 0 baseline flows, 7 continued to have no flow. Five subjects observed side effects, although minimal and transient. CONCLUSION: The TENS unit was effective in increasing parotid gland salivary flow in healthy subjects. There was age-related but no gender-related variability in parotid salivary flow rate."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Chronic low back pain (CLBP) may be treated without opioids through the use of transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS). However, no study has evaluated its clinical effect and economic impact as measured by opioid utilization and costs. The purpose of this study was to evaluate patients who were given TENS for CLBP compared to a matched group without TENS at one-year follow-up, to determine differences between opioid consumption. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Opioid utilization and costs in patients who did and did not receive TENS were extracted from a Medicare supplemental administrative claims database. Patients were selected if they had at least two ICD-9-CM coded claims for low back pain in a three-month period and were then propensity score matched at a 1:1 ratio between patients who received TENS and those who did not. There were 22,913 patients in each group who had a minimum follow-up of one year. There were no significant demographic or comorbidity differences with the exception that TENS patients had more episodes of back pain. RESULTS: Significantly fewer patients in the TENS group required opioids at final follow-up (57.7 vs. 60.3%). TENS patients also had significantly fewer annual per-patient opioid costs compared to non-TENS patients ($169 vs. $192). There were significantly lower event rates in TENS patients compared to non-TENS patients when measured by opioid utilization (characterized by frequency of prescription refills) (3.82 vs. 4.08, respectively) or pharmacy utilization (31.67 vs. 32.25). The TENS group also demonstrated a significantly lower cost of these utilization events ($44 vs. $49) and avoided more opioid events (20.4 events fewer per 100 patients annually). DISCUSSION: Treatment of CLBP with TENS demonstrated significantly fewer patients requiring opioids, fewer events where a patient required an opioid prescription, and lower per-patient costs. Since TENS is both non-invasive and a non-narcotic, it may potentially allow physicians to be more aggressive in treating CLBP patients.",

DESIGN: A randomized, single-blind, controlled study of combination therapy for patients with MPS was performed. METHODS: Ninety-nine patients were randomly assigned to one of four different self-management methods for treatment: NSAID patch (N = 25), NSAID patch + TENS (N = 24), NSAID patch + heating pad (N = 25), and NSAID patch + topical capsaicin (N = 25). The NSAID patch used in this study was a ketoprofen patch. All treatment groups were observed for 2 weeks, and the numeric rating scale (NRS) pain score, cervical active range of motion, pressure pain threshold, and Neck Disability Index were assessed. RESULTS: There was no significant difference between the NSAID patch alone group and the three combination therapy groups with respect to decrease in NRS score from baseline (day 0) to each period of observation. In covariate analysis, although there was no difference among the groups in most of the periods, the data at day 14 indicated a trend (P = 0.057). There were no significant differences in the other variables. CONCLUSIONS: We did not observe a statistical difference in improvements to the clinical variables among the four different methods. However, further studies regarding the effectiveness of a mixture of topical capsaicin and ketoprofen in patients with MPS should be considered.",

DESIGN: A prospective, randomized controlled trial. SETTING: Rehabilitation clinic of a teaching hospital. PARTICIPANTS: Patients with knee osteoarthritis (N=50; aged 51-80y) were randomly assigned to the HA group (n=27) or the TENS group (n=23). INTERVENTIONS: The HA group received intra-articular HA injection into the affected knee once a week for 5 consecutive weeks, and the TENS group received a 20- minute session of TENS 3 times a week for 4 consecutive weeks. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome measures used were the visual analog scale (VAS) for pain and the Lequesne index. The secondary outcome measures were range of motion of the knee, walking time, pain threshold, patient global assessment, and disability in activities of daily living. All subjects were assessed at baseline, and at 2 weeks, 2 months, and 3 months after the treatments were completed. RESULTS: The TENS group exhibited a significantly greater improvement in VAS than the HA group at 2 weeks' follow-up (4.17 ± 1.98 vs 5.31 ± 1.78, respectively; P=.03). In addition, the TENS group also exhibited a significantly greater improvement in the Lequesne index than the HA group at 2 weeks' follow-up (7.78 ± 2.08 vs 9.85 ± 3.54, respectively; P=.01) and at 3 months' follow-up (7.07 ± 2.85 vs 9.24 ± 4.04, respectively; P=.03). CONCLUSIONS: TENS with silver spike point electrodes was observed to be more effective than intra-articular HA injection for patients with knee osteoarthritis in improving the VAS for pain at 2 weeks' follow-up as well as the Lequesne index at 2 weeks' and 3 months' follow-up.",

SEARCH METHODS: The initial review searched The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsychINFO, AMED and PEDRO databases in April 2008. We performed an updated search of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL and PEDRO databases in November 2011. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included only randomised controlled trials (RCTS) investigating the use of TENS for the management of cancer-related pain in adults. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: The search strategy identified a further two studies for possible inclusion. One of the review authors screened each abstract using a study eligibility tool. Where eligibility could not be determined, a second author assessed the full paper. One author used a standardised data extraction sheet to collect information on the studies and independently assess the quality of the studies using the validated five-point Oxford Quality Scale. The small sample sizes and differences in patient study populations of the three included studies (two from the original review and a third included in this update) prevented meta-analysis. For the original review the search strategy identified 37 possible published studies; we divided these between two pairs of review authors who decided on study selection; all four review authors discussed and agreed final scores. MAIN RESULTS: Only one additional RCT met the eligibility criteria (24 participants) for this updated review. Although this was a feasibility study, not designed to investigate intervention effect, it suggested that TENS may improve bone pain on movement in a cancer population. The initial review identified two RCTs (64 participants) therefore this review now includes a total of three RCTs (88 participants). These studies were heterogenous with respect to study population, sample size, study design, methodological quality, mode of TENS, treatment duration, method of administration and outcome measures used. In one RCT, there were no significant differences between TENS and placebo in women with chronic pain secondary to breast cancer treatment. In the other RCT, there were no significant differences between acupuncture-type TENS and sham in palliative care patients; this study was underpowered. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Despite the one additional RCT, the results of this updated systematic review remain inconclusive due to a lack of suitable RCTs. Large multi-centre RCTs are required to assess the value of TENS in the management of cancer-related pain in adults.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Trigeminal neuralgia typically involves nerves supplying teeth, jaws and face of older females. Though the etiology is usually obscure, different treatment modalities have been tried for it viz. medicinal treatment, injection alcohol, peripheral neurectomy, rhizotomy, and microvascular decompression etc. Transcutaneous electric nerve stimulation (TENS) is an emerging and promising option for management of such patients. AIMS AND DESIGN: The present study was designed with an aim to study the efficacy of TENS in management of trigeminal neuralgia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study was conducted on 30 patients of trigeminal neuralgia confirmed by diagnostic nerve block. They were given bursts of TENS for 20-40 days over the path of the affected nerve and subsequently evaluated at 1 month and 3 month intervals by visual analogue scale (VAS), verbal pain scale (VPS), a functional outcome scales for main daily activities like sleep, chewing, talking, or washing face. RESULTS: The results showed that, on VAS, the score decreased from 8.9 (Pre TENS) to 3.1 at 1 month and 1.3 at 3 months, and on VPS, the score decreased from 3.5 (Pre TENS) to 1.2 at 1 month and 0.3 at 3 months. Similarly, a considerable decrease in scores was seen on functional outcome scale for different activities. No side effects like irritation or redness of skin were seen in any of the patients. CONCLUSIONS: Thus, TENS was found to be a safe, easily acceptable, and non-invasive outdoor patient department procedure for management of trigeminal neuralgia."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Diabetes is a common health care problem in western countries. Painful diabetic neuropathy (PDN) might be one of the consequences of long ongoing diabetes; it is estimated that approximately 20% of European diabetic patients suffer from PDN. Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) is often used as additional pain treatment. However, recent studies show inconsistent results. We aimed to assess the effect of micro-TENS in reducing neuropathic pain in patients with PDN in a placebo-controlled, single-blinded, and randomized design. DESIGN/SETTING/PATIENTS/OUTCOME MEASURES: 22 diabetic patients have been treated with a micro-TENS therapy and 19 patients have been treated with a placebo therapy. Treatment duration was 4 weeks with three therapeutical settings per week. Standardized questionnaires (Pain Disability Index [PDI], neuropathic pain score [NPS], Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale [CES-D]) were used to assess pain intensity, pain disability, as well as quality of life at baseline at the end of the treatment period and 4 weeks after treatment termination. RESULTS: Patients with a minimum of 30% reduction in NPS were defined as therapy responders. After 4 weeks of treatment, 6/21 patients in the verum group vs 10/19 patients in the placebo group responded to therapy. The median PDI score after 4 weeks of treatment showed a reduction of 23% in the verum vs 25% in the placebo group. The differences did not reach statistical significance. CONCLUSIONS: The pain reduction with the applied transcutaneous electrotherapy regimen is not superior to a placebo treatment.",

      "abstract": "The benefits of transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) for pain relief have not been reliably established, as most systematic reviews find poor methodological quality in many studies. The paradox within the evidence base for TENS is that despite identified sources of bias that may lead to an overestimation of treatment effects, no benefits for TENS can be clearly demonstrated. Conventional assessments of quality assume a single direction of bias, and little work has been undertaken examining other directions of bias. Our hypothesis was that low fidelity in studies (bias leading to an underestimation of treatment effects) may account for inconclusive findings. We included 38 studies from 3 recently published Cochrane systematic reviews that examined TENS for acute, chronic, and cancer pain. We extracted data relating to treatment allocation, application of TENS and to the assessment of outcomes. We quantified these data and judged this against standardised assessment criteria using a \"traffic light\" approach based on the number of studies reaching the standard. We identified significant sources of potential bias in both directions in relation to study design and implementation fidelity that have not been quantified previously. Suboptimal dosing of TENS and inappropriate outcome assessment were particularly prevalent weaknesses indicating low fidelity. We propose criteria for judging directions of bias in future studies of TENS that may be adapted to assess other trials in which implementation fidelity is important, such as other nonpharmacological interventions for pain. Poor implementation fidelity was identified as a significant source of bias in systematic reviews of TENS studies and might explain lack of consistent treatment effects of TENS in pain. Here, criteria for assessing methodology are proposed for use in designing future clinical trials of TENS.",

METHODS: We performed a systematic literature search of Medline and the Cochrane Library from inception to April 2009. RESULTS: There are conflicting reports of TENS compared to sham TENS in the treatment of chronic low back pain, with 2 Class II studies showing benefit, but 2 Class I studies and another Class II study not showing benefit. Because the Class I studies are stronger evidence, TENS is established as ineffective for the treatment of chronic low back pain (2 Class I studies). TENS is probably effective in treating painful diabetic neuropathy (2 Class II studies). RECOMMENDATIONS: Transcutaneous electric nerve stimulation (TENS) is not recommended for the treatment of chronic low back pain (Level A). TENS should be considered in the treatment of painful diabetic neuropathy (Level B). Further research into the mechanism of action of TENS is needed, as well as more rigorous studies for determination of efficacy.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether repeated administration of modulating frequency transcutaneous electric nerve stimulation (TENS) prevents development of analgesic tolerance. DESIGN: Knee joint inflammation (3% carrageenan and kaolin) was induced in rats. Either mixed or alternating frequency was administered daily (20min) for 2 weeks to the inflamed knee under light halothane anesthesia (1%-2%). SETTING: Laboratory. ANIMALS: Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats (N=36). INTERVENTION: Mixed- (4Hz and 100Hz) or alternating- (4Hz on 1 day; 100Hz on the next day) frequency TENS at sensory intensity and 100micros pulse duration. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Paw and joint withdrawal thresholds to mechanical stimuli were assessed before induction of inflammation, and before and after daily application of TENS. RESULTS: The reduced paw and joint withdrawal thresholds that occur 24 hours after the induction of inflammation were significantly reversed by the first administration of TENS when compared with sham treatment or to the condition before TENS treatment, which was observed through day 9. By the tenth day, repeated daily administration of either mixed- or alternating-frequency TENS did not reverse the decreased paw and joint withdrawal thresholds. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that repeated administration of modulating frequency TENS leads to a development of opioid tolerance. However, this tolerance effect is delayed by approximately 5 days compared with administration of low- or high-frequency TENS independently. Clinically, we can infer that a treatment schedule of repeated daily TENS administration will result in a tolerance effect. Moreover, modulating low and high frequency TENS seems to produce a better analgesic effect and tolerance is slower to develop.",

      "abstract": "UNLABELLED: Transcutaneous electric nerve stimulation (TENS) is a noninvasive treatment used in physiotherapy practice to promote analgesia in acute and chronic inflammatory conditions. The aim of the present study was to investigate the action mechanism of TENS at high (HF: 130 Hz) and low (LF: 10 Hz) frequencies in an inflammation model produced by the injection of carrageenan in rat paws (Cg; 250 microg). After carrageenan administration (0 time), either HF or LF TENS was applied to the inflamed paw of rats for 20 minutes, and hyperalgesia was assessed hourly using the modified Randall-Selitto method (1957). HF and LF TENS inhibited the carrageenan-induced hyperalgesia by 100%. Pretreatment of animals with intraplantar naltrexone (Nx; 50 microg) reversed the analgesic effect of the LF TENS but did not alter the effect of HF TENS. The application of HF and LF TENS to the contralateral paw reversed the hyperalgesia of the inflamed paw similar to that observed when TENS was applied to the inflamed paw. However, LF TENS presented a longer-lasting analgesic effect than HF TENS. Our data demonstrate that HF and LF TENS induced antihyperalgesia. We also report that the antihyperalgesia provoked by LF TENS is partially due to the local release of endogenous opioids. PERSPECTIVE: This study offers important information about physiotherapy practices aimed at pain relieving. TENS is a noninvasive treatment that promotes analgesia in acute and chronic inflammatory conditions. Scientists, patients, and the general population may benefit from this knowledge.",

DESIGN: A single-blind randomized controlled trial with a convenience sample. SETTING: University physiotherapy department. PARTICIPANTS: Sixty-four healthy volunteers (32 men [mean age, 28.1+/-5.9y], 32 women [mean age, 27.7+/-5.6y]) were recruited and randomly divided into 4 groups. INTERVENTIONS: The 4 groups received TENS delivered at (1) 2Hz; (2) 100Hz; (3) 2/100Hz alternating frequency; and (4) no treatment (control group), respectively. Electric stimulation was applied over the anterior aspect of the dominant forearm for 30 minutes. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Mechanical pain thresholds (MPTs) and heat pain thresholds (HPTs) were recorded before, during, and after TENS stimulation. The data were analyzed using linear mixed models, with group treated as a between-subject factor and time a within-subject factor. RESULTS: During and shortly after electric stimulation, HPT increased significantly in the alternating frequency stimulation group (P=.024). MPT increased significantly in both the 100Hz (P=.008) and the alternating frequency groups (P=.012), but the increase was substantially larger in the 100Hz group. CONCLUSIONS: Alternating frequency stimulation produced a greater elevation in the HPT, but a greater increase in the MPT was achieved using 100Hz stimulation.",

We aimed to assess the efficacy of transcutaneous electric nerve stimulation (TENS) in patients with postthoracotomy pain. METHODS: Forty patients scheduled to undergo posterolateral thoracotomy were randomly allocated to receive either TENS or patient-controlled intravenous morphine. Postoperative pain was evaluated using a visual analogue scale (VAS) and the Prince Henry pain scale. Pulmonary function was evaluated and an intergroup comparison was done. RESULTS: On the first three days following surgery, the VAS intensity of the TENS group did not differ significantly from that of the morphine group ( P > 0.05), and on the first two days following thoracotomy, the Prince Henry scale of the TENS group was not statistically significantly different. However, the VAS intensity was significantly lower than that of the control group on the fourth ( P = 0.044), fifth ( P = 0.016), sixth ( P = 0.009), seventh ( P = 0.008), eighth ( P = 0.004), ninth ( P = 0.002), tenth ( P = 0.001), fifteenth ( P = 0.002), thirtieth ( P < 0.001), forty-fifth ( P < 0.001) and sixtieth ( P < 0.001) days. The Prince Henry scale of the TENS group was found to be significantly diminished from the 3rd to the 60th day. TENS significantly reduced the analgesic requirements from day 5 to 60 ( P < 0.01). No noticeable side effect was observed in the TENS group during the study period. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that TENS provided a better pain relief and comfort compared to PCA from the fourth postoperative day onwards, and this pain-reducing effect continued for at least two months postoperatively.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Breast-feeding in the postpartum period is known to induce intense uterine contractions with pain in the lower abdomen. AIMS: The primary aim of this study was to compare the effects of high and low intensity, high frequency Transcutaneous Electric Nerve Stimulation (TENS) on pain and discomfort of postpartum uterine contractions. The secondary aim was to evaluate discomfort experienced from the stimulation itself. METHODS: Twenty-one newly delivered women participated in this single-blind trial, 12 women received high intensity, high-frequency TENS (HI TENS) and 9 women received low intensity, high-frequency TENS (LI TENS). The electrodes were placed abdominally on each side of the uterus. Stimulation was done during one minute. Visual analogue scales were used to evaluate the intensity of the pain before and after stimulation. A verbal scale was used to estimate sensation of discomfort before, during and after stimulation. RESULTS: The median decrease in pain ratings before and after treatment by VAS was larger in the HI TENS group -49 mm (95% CI -66.5--33.2) than in the LI TENS group -21 mm (95% CI -39.0--20.0). The reduction of pain was most pronounced in the HI TENS group (median difference 28 (95% CI was 14.0-53.0). Furthermore, the HI TENS group experienced significantly less discomfort of the uterine contractions after stimulation (p<0.01) but they also experienced more discomfort of the stimulation than women in the LI TENS group (p<0.01). CONCLUSION: The women treated with HI TENS, experienced significantly less postpartum pain and discomfort to those treated with LI TENS even though the discomfort from the stimulation with HI TENS was greater.",

Pain relief by transcutaneous electric nerve stimulation (TENS) with BMWs was tested. Materials and Methods.  Analgesic effects of BMWs and conventional bidirectional pulsed waves on chronic back pain in 28 patients were compared, and effects of repeated TENS using BMWs on chronic back pain were investigated in 21 patients by means of a randomized double-blind, sham-controlled, parallel-group method. Pain intensity was assessed using numerical rating scale (NRS). Results.  There was significant immediate reduction in NRS in patients receiving BMWs, and 60 min after treatment compared to sham TENS. Weekly repeated treatments using massage and TENS with BMWs for 5 weeks resulted in a decrease of NRS, but there were no significant differences between the TENS plus massage and sham TENS plus massage groups. Conclusions.  This study shows that TENS with BMWs significantly inhibits chronic back pain, and treatment effects are attained within a day. The results also suggest that there were no statistically significant long-term effects of TENS with BMW in the repeated treatment."

DESIGN: Prospective randomized allocation of 3 treatments. SETTING: Research laboratory. ANIMALS: Male Sprague-Dawley rats (weight range, 250-350 g). INTERVENTION: Knee joints of rats were inflamed with a mixture of 3% carrageenan and 3% kaolin for 24 hours prior to placement of push-pull cannulae into the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. Push-pull samples were collected in 10-minute intervals before, during, and after treatment with low-frequency TENS (4 Hz), high-frequency TENS (100 Hz), or sham TENS. TENS was applied to the inflamed knee joint for 20 minutes at sensory intensity and 100-mus pulse duration. Push-pull samples were analyzed for serotonin and noradrenaline by high performance liquid chromatography with coulemetric detection. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Spinal concentrations of serotonin and noradrenaline. RESULTS: Low-frequency TENS significantly increased serotonin concentrations during and immediately after treatment. There was no change in serotonin with high-frequency TENS, nor was there a change in noradrenaline with low- or high-frequency TENS. CONCLUSIONS: Low-frequency TENS releases serotonin in the spinal cord to produce antihyperalgesia by activation of serotonin receptors.",

Thirty-three patients (26 women and 7 men) with rheumatoid arthritis (according to modified ACR criteria), and with the duration of the disease 10.7 +/- 8.8 years are investigated. Each subject received ST-TENS (75 Hz) at the selected joint and AL-TENS (4 Hz) at the contralateral joint respectively. No significant difference between left and right side in pre-treatment pain was the main criterion for selecting the treated joint. Treatment was performed during 12 days. The initiation, duration, level of hypolgesia (according to Ritchie's pain assessment scale and VAS), patients' global assessment and possible reduction of dosage of analgetics/antirheumatics were measured. There was a significant reduction in pain level on ST-TENS site (48.6%), and on AL-TENS site (40.8%), measured on VAS. Results of Ritchie's index showed significant difference before and after application (for each type of TENS P < 0.05). There was no statistical difference between both types of TENS regarding the reduction of pain level, as well as the initiation of analgesic effect, whilst it was noted a slightly longer, although statistically not significant, hypoalgesic effect of AL-TENS. Patients' global assessment also did not differ relating to ST-TENS and AL-TENS, as well as their opinion on possible dosage reduction of analgetics/antirheumatics. Side effects for both types of TENS were negligible. The findings showed that ST-TENS and AL-TENS provided hypoalgesic effect in the similar degree in patients with long-standing rheumatoid arthritis.",

DESIGN: A completely randomized experimental design. Two groups of rats received a chronic constriction injury to the right sciatic nerve, and 2 groups did not. The rats were either treated or not treated with TENS. SETTING: Research laboratory. ANIMALS: Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats (150-165g). INTERVENTIONS: TENS was delivered daily for 1 hour to the chronic constriction injury rats or to the uninjured rats through self-adhesive electrodes applied to the skin innervated by the right dorsal rami of lumbar spinal nerves 1 to 6. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Thermal and mechanical pain thresholds were assessed bilaterally in the hind paws of all rats twice before the chronic constriction injury surgery (baseline) and then 12 days after the surgery. An analogous time frame of assessment was used for rats that did not have chronic constriction injury surgery. Thermal and mechanical allodynia were expressed as difference scores between the pain thresholds of the right and left hind paws. These values were normalized to differences that existed between the 2 paws at baseline. The amino acid content of dorsal horn axon terminals was assessed bilaterally with high-pressure liquid chromatography, and values were normalized to wet weight. RESULTS: The mean level of thermal and mechanical allodynia did not differ between the TENS-treated and untreated rats with chronic constriction injury. However, there was a significant relation between the dorsal horn, axon terminal content of glutamate (adjusted R(2)=.45, P<.01) and glycine (adjusted R(2)=.51, P<.005) and the magnitude of mechanical allodynia present in TENS-treated chronic constriction injury rats, but not in any other group. As axon terminal glutamate and glycine decreased in the right dorsal horn and increased in the left, mechanical allodynia was reduced or absent. When this trend was reversed, mechanical allodynia was more severe. Daily TENS also reduced the mean axon terminal content of aspartate, glutamate, and glycine bilaterally in the chronic constriction injury rats from the level observed in untreated neuropathic rats (P<.05). CONCLUSION: The variability in responsiveness of mechanical allodynia to daily TENS treatment in neuropathic rats is related to the axon terminal content of glutamate and glycine in the dorsal horn. These findings may help explain a similar variability in humans when TENS is used to treat neuropathic pain.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of transcutaneous electrical stimulation produced by Han's acupiont nerve stimulator (HANS) in treating obesity. METHODS: Sixteen volunteers with primary obesity were recruited, without any instructions or attempts to control their dietary. The trial started in November 2001 and ended in June 2002. Each obese volunteer received transcutaneous electric nerve stimulation (TENS) at 8 acupoints. The electrical parameters were: frequency at 2 Hz, with pulses width of 0.6 ms; intensity varied depending on individual's sensitivity to electrical stimulation to maintain a comfortable level. The treatment was administered 3 times per week. Body weight was recorded before each TENS treatment. RESULTS: The main value of body weight decreased gradually during the trial, with a net decrease of (2.06 +/- 0.31) kg at the end of 12 weeks' treatment (the first phase), corresponding to a decrease of (2.78 +/- 0.40)% as compared with the initial body weight (P < 0.01). In the interim period of 4 weeks (during the Chinese Spring Festival), a partial recurrence of the body weight occurred. During the second phase of treatment lasting for 15 weeks, there was again a reduction of body weight for (2.81 +/- 0.68) kg, corresponding to a decrease of (3.90 +/- 0.40)% (P < 0.001) as compared with the pretreatment level. CONCLUSION: An open trial of HANS treatment revealed a moderate, but significant effectiveness on weight reduction in a group of people with primary obesity. The therapy remains effective for the second phase of treatment. It is anticipated that a better effect can be achieved if the treatment is accompanied with diet control and appropriate exercise.",

DESIGN: Randomized, double-blind, placebo-control, crossover trial. Patients and staff administered outcome measures blinded. SETTING: Outpatient, university-affiliated Department of Veterans Affairs medical center. PARTICIPANTS: Eleven mild to moderate CTS cases (nerve conduction study, clinical examination) who failed standard medical or surgical treatment for 3 to 30 months. INTERVENTION: Patients received real and sham treatment series (each for 3-4wk), in a randomized order. Real treatments used red-beam laser (continuous wave, 15mW, 632.8nm) on shallow acupuncture points on the affected hand, infrared laser (pulsed, 9.4W, 904nm) on deeper points on upper extremity and cervical paraspinal areas, and microamps TENS on the affected wrist. Devices were painless, noninvasive, and produced no sensation whether they were real or sham. The hand was treated behind a hanging black curtain without the patient knowing if devices were on (real) or off (sham). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: McGill Pain Questionnaire (MPQ) score, sensory and motor latencies, and Phalen and Tinel signs. RESULTS: Significant decreases in MPQ score, median nerve sensory latency, and Phalen and Tinel signs after the real treatment series but not after the sham treatment series. Patients could perform their previous work (computer typist, handyman) and were stable for 1 to 3 years. CONCLUSIONS: This new, conservative treatment was effective in treating CTS pain; larger studies are recommended.",

RESULTS: Significant differences occurred between groups for forearm (P <.0001; repeated-measures analysis of variance) but not fingertip cutaneous blood flow. Post hoc Fisher tests showed a significant increase in forearm blood flow during TENS application in the above-motor-threshold TENS group compared with the other 3 groups. No significant differences between groups for skin temperature data were observed. CONCLUSIONS: The effect of TENS on cutaneous blood flow depends on whether muscle activity is induced. Low-frequency TENS applied above the motor threshold significantly increases local cutaneous blood flow. There were no significant differences between groups for skin temperature.",

DESIGN: Intervention study with and without transcutaneous electric nerve stimulation (TENS). SETTING: Rehabilitation center research laboratory. PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-two stroke patients (mean age, 58.3 +/- 2.5yr; average days since stroke, 83.2d) and 14 age-matched healthy subjects. Stroke patients were subdivided into 3 groups: 6 with spatial neglect and 16 without (8 with left lesion, 8 with right lesion). INTERVENTIONS: All participants were subjected to a dynamic balance task, performed while sitting for 8 seconds on a laterally rocking platform. Seated on this mobile support, they were asked to maintain actively an erect posture, sitting as still as possible. In patients, TENS was applied on the contralesional side of the neck during the postural task. An effective stimulation (intensity corresponding to the threshold of perception, TENS+) was compared with a placebo stimulation (.01 x threshold of perception, TENS-). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Postural performance in each trial was monitored by using 2 criteria: the number of aborted trials caused by loss of balance, and the angular dispersion of the support oscillations in roll. The latter criterion, which increased with body instability, was defined as 2 standard deviations of the angular distribution. RESULTS: Patients showing neglect displayed pronounced postural instability compared with other patients and controls. Although dramatic postural instability in the neglect patients was spectacularly and systematically reduced with TENS, no effect was observed in patients without neglect. CONCLUSION: This is among the first studies to provide clinical evidence supporting the \"postural body scheme\" concept.",

DESIGN: Electric stimulation was delivered with a small stylus electrode pressed against the skin paravertebrally in the radiculopathy group and along the surgical incision in the postthoracotomy neuralgia group. A before-after treatment design was conducted with a verbal pain rating scale. SETTING: Outpatient multidisciplinary pain clinic at a Midwestern Veterans Affairs medical center. PARTICIPANTS: Fourteen consecutive patients with well-documented radiculopathy and 4 consecutive patients with postthoracotomy neuralgia. RESULTS: Statistically significant differences were found in both patient groups, with posttreatment scores reflecting less pain than pretreatment scores for every patient. CONCLUSIONS: Patients reported reduced pain ratings following this stimulation technique. Further study of this inexpensive, noninvasive, outpatient technique is needed.",

In the present open and non-controlled study we investigated the effect on 24-h ambulatory blood pressure of low frequency TENS in a group of hypertensive subjects who do not respond properly to pharmacological treatment. METHOD: Twelve patients were investigated. The patients were treated with TENS at two acupoints on both forearms for 30 min twice daily during 4 weeks. 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring was recorded 1 week before, at start, at the end and finally 1 week after the TENS treatment. RESULTS: The blood pressure did not change significantly during the run-in period. After 4 weeks of TENS, the mean systolic blood pressure decreased by 6.3 mm Hg (P < 0.05) and the mean diastolic blood pressure decreased by 3.7 mm Hg (P < 0.05). The blood pressure reduction remained unchanged 1 week after treatment. There was no change in mean heart rate. CONCLUSION: The present study suggests that continuous TENS may have additional blood pressure-lowering properties in hypertensive patients who do not respond properly to pharmacological treatment. The effect of TENS may also have a prolonged effect. Journal of Human Hypertension (2000) 14, 795-798",

      "abstract": "1. Periarterial nerve electrical stimulation caused a double peaked vasoconstriction in isolated perfused canine splenic arterial preparations. At low frequencies (1-3 Hz), the 1st peak responses were significantly inhibited by alpha,beta-methylene ATP. On the other hand, at high frequencies (8-10 Hz), the responses were not completely inhibited by alpha,beta-methylene ATP but the remaining response was abolished by an additional treatment of prazosin. 2. Concerning the 2nd peak responses, at low frequencies (1-3 Hz), the response was mostly suppressed by alpha,beta-methylene ATP, but at high frequencies (6-10 Hz), the response was not significantly modified by it, although the remaining responses were completely blocked by prazosin. Thus, at high frequencies an adrenergic and purinergic interaction may exist presynaptically, to prevent the inhibition by alpha,beta-methylene ATP. 3. At 1 Hz, rauwolscine, an alpha2-adrenoceptor antagonist, caused a potentiation of electrical stimulation-induced responses (both 1st and 2nd peaked responses) which were inhibited by prazosin, and the remaining ones were abolished by alpha,beta-methylene ATP. On the other hand, at 10 Hz, rauwolscine did not cause any potentiation of the double peaked responses. 4. The biphasic responses at 1 Hz were strongly inhibited by exogenously applied ATP, and its inhibition was reversed in part by a P1 receptor antagonist 8-phenyltheophylline (8-PT). On the other hand, the biphasic vasoconstrictions at 10 Hz were only slightly depressed by ATP, and a subsequent administration of 8-PT produced a partial recovery of the 1st phase response but not that of the 2nd one. 5. From these results, it is concluded that (1) at low frequencies the double peaked responses are mostly mediated via P2X receptor, presynaptic P1 receptors may also modulate the release of ATP, and presynaptic alpha2-adrenergic mechanism may tonically participate in the release of noradrenaline (2) at high frequencies the responses are mostly mediated via alpha1-adrenoceptors and presynaptic P2 receptors may exert its action to inhibit the release of noradrenaline from adrenergic nerve terminals.",

Forty-four patients who had a paretic arm as a consequence of their first stroke were included and randomly assigned to either a treatment group (n = 26) or a control group (n = 18). Patients in both groups received physiotherapy at a day-care center, usually twice a week. The treatment group received, in addition, Low-TENS for 60 min, five days a week for three months. Results showed that motor function increased significantly in the treatment group, compared to controls. The Low-TENS did not decrease either pain or spasticity. It is concluded that stimulation by means of Low-TENS could be a valuable complement to the usual training of arm and hand function in the rehabilitation of stroke patients.",

The motor nerve conduction velocity slowing was prevented or corrected after a course of four and six weeks treatment in EA and TENS group respectively. In the DM and TENS groups the pain threshold was lowered at 6-20 days after injection of STZ, but elevated in EA group, their differences were of significance (P < 0.05).

      "abstract": "In recent years transcutaneous electrical neuromuscular stimulation (TENS) has become increasingly more common in the treatment of functional diseases of the masticatory muscles and currently the practitioner can choose among a variety of stimulators. In an electromyographic study of 17 adults suffering from nocturnal bruxism and of a control group consisting of 18 adults without any functional disturbances of the masticatory muscles, the effect of this kind of neuromuscular stimulation on the temporal and masseter muscle was examined. The myoelectric signals were registered before and after TENS treatment in 3 different positions of the mandible. Each person was treated 3 times with both the Myo-Monitor (Myo-Tronics, Seattle) and the TNS SM2 MF stimulator (schwa-medico, Giessen). The different effects of continuous low frequency and intermittent high frequency muscular stimulation were studied simultaneously. Muscular activity was determined by computer aided integration of the electromyographically measured raw signals. A fourier analysis of the power spectrum yielded information on the frequency behavior of the studied muscles resulting from the TENS treatment. A statistical analysis of the results led to the following significant conclusions: 1. TENS treatment decreased the values of the registered integrated signals on all test persons, however, the treatment increased the median frequency and the mean power frequency (MPF). Since this effect is contrary to muscle fatigue, these electromyographic results can be interpreted as providing objective proof of a relaxation in the treated muscles. 2. The electromyographic changes after TENS treatment were similar when using either the Myo-Monitor or the TNS SM2 MF stimulator. In addition, the 2 different types of stimulation (high or low frequency) showed the same effects. 3. Compared to the persons in the control group, there was no significant increased muscular activity in patients with nocturnal bruxism. Following TENS treatment both groups showed the same alterations in the electromyograms. The results of the study provide further evidence that TENS treatment is an adequate supportive procedure in the treatment of nocturnal bruxism.",

Thirty-one patients were included and randomly selected to be treated 6 weeks with either TENS (90 Hz, 30 min, three times/day) or with a flat occlusal splint (24 h/day. Those selected for the TENS group had one electrode placed over the painful TMJ and another electrode over the anterior temporal muscle. The splint group used a conventional flat occlusal splint with cuspid guidance. Both treatment groups visited the clinic once a week. Symptoms and signs were registered before and after treatment. The intensity of pain was recorded with a visual analogue scale (VAS) and with an electronic pocket-sized recorder (Pain-Track) carried 1 week before and also the last week of treatment for continuous registration of pain. Measured with the VAS, half of the patients treated with splints became pain-free or their TMJ pain improved at least 50% both at rest and with jaw function compared with only 6% in the TENS-treated group. With regard to strictly chewing pain, the VAS-registered pain improved in two-thirds of the splint group, compared with 50% of the TENS group. With the Pain-Track device it was found that in most individuals pain was aggrevated at mealtimes. The conclusion was that flat occlusal splints in several respects are better than TENS in the treatment of symptoms associated with TMJ disk displacement without reduction.",

Pain was diminished after first or second treatment and completely disappeared at the end of the first or second day. Swelling usually disappeared in the interval between the third and seventh day. At the end of the treatment joint movement was significantly improved. In the control group who received only conventional conservative treatment (puncture, immobilization or inactivity, drugs) swelling and pain were still present after the seventh day and these patients needed additional physiotherapy for next seven days. We consider the TENS a method of choice in the treatment of posttraumatic hemarthros providing that treatment starts immediately after the injury and that it is continually applied during 3-5 days. The patients are advised to use crutches. It is a simple, painless method which is not combined with any additional treatment. Proteolytic ointments can increase and stimulate the therapeutic effects.",

Subjects were 11 inpatients at the University of Alabama Hospital Burn Unit. A two-period crossover design was used, and each patient received one experimental treatment consisting of bilateral acupuncture-like transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation to six ear points and one control treatment consisting of a placebo pill. The Visual Analogue Scale was used as a measure of pain and was completed immediately before and after treatments and at 15, 30, and 60 minutes after treatment. A two-factor repeated measures ANOVA indicated significant effects of measurement time (p less than 0.001) and treatment by time (p = 0.002). Post hoc analysis revealed significant differences (p less than 0.05) between experimental and control conditions at all times after treatment but not at pretreatment baseline. These results indicate that auricular acupuncture-like transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation may be an effective pain management technique in patients with burns.",

Therefore, measures which reduce painful experiences may be beneficial for patients' attitudes towards medical interventions. Using conservative dental treatment as a model situation, we studied effects of transcutaneous electric nerve stimulation (TENS) upon acute orofacial pain in three experiments. In the first experiment, pain thresholds (electric tooth stimulation) were found to be increased under TENS. In the second experiment, electric brain potentials (ERP) were evoked by electric tooth stimulation. The ERP amplitude is intensity-dependent and revealed a marked decrease as a consequence of TENS. Finally, TENS was applied during real treatment, and subjective estimates confirm its beneficial effect upon pain and stress.",

The pain was unilateral in 90% of the patients; upper and lower extremities were affected with equal frequency. Tenderness to palpation, extreme hyperesthesia, and dysesthesia were other dominant features. All patients had some evidence of autonomic nervous system dysfunction in the affected extremity (swelling, color change, decreased temperature, and/or hyperhidrosis). The median duration of symptoms prior to referral and diagnosis was 5 months. All children were treated as outpatients with a transcutaneous electric nerve stimulator and home-based physical therapy. With this regimen, seven patients had complete remission within 2 months. Two other patients improved with transcutaneous electric nerve stimulation therapy, and one patient had no response to transcutaneous electric nerve stimulation. Reflex sympathetic dystrophy is frequently underdiagnosed in children. Increased awareness of this syndrome is important because accurate diagnosis is crucial and transcutaneous electric nerve stimulation offers a safe, simple, and effective outpatient therapy for reflex sympathetic dystrophy in children.",

Prior to a clinical study this method was tested in a preliminary examination in 15 healthy volunteers. Clinical and physical data were investigated from which a theoretical maximum value of the quantity of iontophorised non-steroidal antiphlogistics (NSAI) could be calculated. The actual achievable absorption is discussed. Based on these data it is concluded that a good effective tissue concentration of benzydamine and diclofenac can be achieved with iontophoresis by means of TENS.",

      "abstract": "Some aspects in the development of severe tissue damage after an adriamycin extravasation are considered as a sympathetic reflex dystrophy syndrome. In this, a peripheral stimulus (e.g. pain) activates efferent autonomic and motor nerves resulting in vasomotor changes and other \"dystrophic\" changes in soft tissues. A typical state is the Sudeck's dystrophy syndrome. With a transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation it should be possible to interrupt this vicious circle. A case with a good clinical result is reported.",

      "abstract": "Transcutaneous electric nerve stimulation (TENS) is an effective treatment modality for chronic pain. Electrical impulses produced by a portable stimulator are transmitted by cable to electrodes which are attached to specific areas of the body by tape or adhesive. A conductive electrolyte jelly is utilized in order to make good electrical contact with the skin. Several dermatologic complications have been associated with the use of this technic, including allergic and irritant contact dermatitis and micropunctate burns caused by the improper use of poorly conductive lubricant jellies. A patient is reported herein who developed allergic contact dermatitis to propylene glycol in a conductive jelly (Neuromod TENS gel). In an attempt to continue therapy, the patient changed to a poorly conductive surgical lubricant jelly which caused irritation and micropunctate burns. Subsequently, electrodes not utilizing conductive jelly were applied, with excellent results.",
