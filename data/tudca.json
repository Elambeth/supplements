      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND AIMS: In inflammatory bowel disease, protein misfolding in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) potentiates epithelial barrier dysfunction and impairs mucosal healing. Tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA), a naturally occurring bile acid, acts as a chemical chaperone to reduce protein aggregation and colitis severity in preclinical models. We conducted an open label trial evaluating oral TUDCA as therapy in patients with active ulcerative colitis (UC). METHODS: Patients with moderate-to-severely active UC (Mayo score ≥6, endoscopic subscore ≥1) received oral TUDCA at 1.75 or 2 g/day for 6 weeks. Exclusion criteria included known hepatic disorders or change in UC therapy within 60 days. Clinical disease activity questionnaires, endoscopy with biopsy, blood, and stool were collected at enrollment and after 6 weeks. The primary outcome measure was change in ER stress markers while safety, tolerability and change in UC disease activity were secondary outcomes. RESULTS: Thirteen participants completed the study with eleven evaluable for clinical response. TUDCA was well-tolerated with transient dyspepsia being the most common side effect. Mucosal biopsies revealed significant reductions in ER stress and inflammation as well as an increase in markers of epithelial restitution. Clinical, endoscopic, and histologic disease activity were significantly improved at week 6 (mean total Mayo Score: 9 to 4.5, p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Six weeks of oral TUDCA treatment was well-tolerated in patients with active ulcerative colitis and promoted mucosal healing, lessened ER stress, and reduced clinical disease activity. A randomized controlled trial of adjunctive TUDCA therapy in patients with UC is warranted. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04114292)."

      "abstract": "Tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA) increases the influx of primary bile acids into the gut. Results obtained on animal models suggested that Firmicutes and Proteobacteria phyla are more resistant to bile acids in rats. As part of a pilot study investigating the role of probiotics supplementation in elderly people with home enteral nutrition (HEN), a case of a 92-year-old woman with HEN is reported in the present study. She lives in a nursing home and suffers from Alzheimer's disease (AD); the patient had been prescribed TUDCA for lithiasis cholangitis. The aim of this case report is therefore to investigate whether long-term TUDCA administration may play a role in altering the patient's gut microbiota (GM) and the impact of an antibiotic therapy on the diversity of microbial species. Using next generation sequencing (NGS) analysis of the bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene a dominant shift toward Firmicutes and a remodeling in Proteobacteria abundance was observed in the woman's gut microbiota. Considering the patient's age, health status and type of diet, we would have expected to find a GM with a prevalence of Bacteroidetes phylum. This represents the first study investigating the possible TUDCA's effect on human GM.",

      "abstract": "Tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA) is approved for the treatment of liver diseases. However, the antihyperglycemic effects/mechanisms of TUDCA are still less clear. The present study aimed to evaluate the antidiabetic action of TUDCA in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in rats. Fifteen adult Wistar albino male rats were randomly divided into three groups (n = five in each): control, diabetic (STZ), and STZ+TUDCA. The results showed that TUDCA treatment significantly reduced blood glucose, HbA1c%, and HOMA-IR as well as elevated the insulin levels in diabetic rats. TUDCA therapy increased the incretin GLP-1 concentrations, decreased serum ceramide synthase (CS), improved the serum lipid profile, and restored the glycogen content in the liver and skeletal muscles. Furthermore, serum inflammatory parameters (such as TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1ß, and PGE-2) were substantially reduced with TUDCA treatment. In the pancreas, STZ+TUDCA-treated rats underwent an obvious enhancement of enzymatic (CAT and SOD) and non-enzymatic (GSH) antioxidant defense systems and a marked decrease in markers of the lipid peroxidation rate (MDA) and nitrosative stress (NO) compared to STZ-alone. At the molecular level, TUDCA decreased the pancreatic mRNA levels of iNOS and apoptotic-related factors (p53 and caspase-3). In conclusion, TUDCA may be useful for diabetes management and could be able to counteract diabetic disorders via anti-hyperlipidemic, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-apoptotic actions.",

      "abstract": "The accumulation of misfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) within plant cells due to unfavourable conditions leads to ER stress. This activates interconnected pathways involving reactive oxygen species (ROS) and unfolded protein response (UPR), which play vital roles in regulating ER stress. The aim of this study is to investigate the underlying mechanisms of tunicamycin (TM) induced ER stress and explore the potential therapeutic applications of tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA) in mitigating cellular responses to ER stress in Pak choi (Brassica campestris subsp. chinensis). The study revealed that ER stress in Pak choi leads to detrimental effects on plant morphology, ROS levels, cellular membrane integrity, and the antioxidant defence system. However, treatment with TUDCA in TM-induced ER stressed Pak choi improved morphological indices, pigment contents, ROS accumulation, cellular membrane integrity, and antioxidant defence system restoration. Additionally, TUDCA also modulates the transcription levels of ER stress sensors genes, ER chaperone genes, and ER-associated degradation (ERAD) genes during ER stress in Pak choi. Furthermore, TUDCA has demonstrated its ability to alleviate ER stress, stabilize the UPR, reduce oxidative stress, prevent apoptosis, and positively influence plant growth and development. These results collectively comprehend TUDCA as a promising agent for mitigating ER stress-induced damage in Pak choi plants and provide valuable insights for further research and potential applications in crop protection and stress management.",

      "abstract": "Selenoprotein N (SEPN1) is a protein of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) whose inherited defects originate SEPN1-related myopathy (SEPN1-RM). Here, we identify an interaction between SEPN1 and the ER-stress-induced oxidoreductase ERO1A. SEPN1 and ERO1A, both enriched in mitochondria-associated membranes (MAMs), are involved in the redox regulation of proteins. ERO1A depletion in SEPN1 knockout cells restores ER redox, re-equilibrates short-range MAMs, and rescues mitochondrial bioenergetics. ERO1A knockout in a mouse background of SEPN1 loss blunts ER stress and improves multiple MAM functions, including Ca2+ levels and bioenergetics, thus reversing diaphragmatic weakness. The treatment of SEPN1 knockout mice with the ER stress inhibitor tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA) mirrors the results of ERO1A loss. Importantly, muscle biopsies from patients with SEPN1-RM exhibit ERO1A overexpression, and TUDCA-treated SEPN1-RM patient-derived primary myoblasts show improvement in bioenergetics. These findings point to ERO1A as a biomarker and a viable target for intervention and to TUDCA as a pharmacological treatment for SEPN1-RM.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a highly debilitating neurodegenerative condition. Despite recent advancements in understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying ALS, there have been no significant improvements in therapeutic options for ALS patients in recent years. Currently, there is no cure for ALS, and the only approved treatment in Europe is riluzole, which has been shown to slow the disease progression and prolong survival by approximately 3 months. Recently, tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA) has emerged as a promising and effective treatment for neurodegenerative diseases due to its neuroprotective activities. METHODS: The ongoing TUDCA-ALS study is a double-blinded, parallel arms, placebo-controlled, randomized multicenter phase III trial with the aim to assess the efficacy and safety of TUDCA as add-on therapy to riluzole in patients with ALS. The primary outcome measure is the treatment response defined as a minimum of 20% improvement in the ALS Functional Rating Scale-Revised (ALSFRS-R) slope during the randomized treatment period (18 months) compared to the lead-in period (3 months). Randomization will be stratified by country. Primary analysis will be conducted based on the intention-to-treat principle through an unadjusted logistic regression model. Patient recruitment commenced on February 22, 2019, and was closed on December 23, 2021. The database will be locked in September 2023. DISCUSSION: This paper provides a comprehensive description of the statistical analysis plan in order to ensure the reproducibility of the analysis and avoid selective reporting of outcomes and data-driven analysis. Sensitivity analyses have been included in the protocol to assess the impact of intercurrent events related to the coronavirus disease 2019. By focusing on clinically meaningful and robust outcomes, this trial aims to determine whether TUDCA can be effective in slowing the disease progression in patients with ALS.

Increasing evidence suggests that endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress may play a role in the pathogenesis of epilepsy. We aimed to investigate the effects of Tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA) and 4-phenyl-butyric acid (4-PBA), which are known to suppress ER stress, on developed seizures in terms of markers of ER stress, oxidative stress, and apoptosis. The pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) kindling model was induced in Wistar albino rats (n = 48) by administering 35 mg/kg PTZ intraperitoneally (I.P.) every other day for 1 month. TUDCA and 4-PBA were administered via I.P. at a dose of 500 mg/kg dose. ER stress, apoptosis, and oxidative stress were determined in the hippocampus tissues of animals in all groups. Immunohistochemistry, qRT-PCR, ELISA, and Western Blot analyzes were performed to determine the efficacy of treatments. Expressions of ATF4, ATF6, p-JNK1/2, Cleaved-Kaspase3, and Caspase12 significantly increased in PTZ-kindled seizures compared to the control group. Increased NOX2 and MDA activity in the seizures were measured. In addition, stereology analyzes showed an increased neuronal loss in the PTZ-kindled group. qRT-PCR examination showed relative mRNA levels of CHOP. Accordingly, TUDCA and 4-PBA treatment suppressed the expressions of ATF4, ATF6, Cleaved-Caspase3, Kaspase12, NOX2, MDA, and CHOP in TUDCA + PTZ and 4-PBA + PTZ groups. ER stress-induced oxidative stress and apoptosis by reducing neuronal loss and degeneration were also preserved in these groups. Our data show molecularly that TUDCA and 4-PBA treatment can suppress the ER stress process in epileptic seizures.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA) is a naturally produced hydrophilic bile acid that has been used for centuries in Chinese medicine. Numerous recent in vitro and in vivo studies have shown that TUDCA has neuroprotective action in various models of retinal disorders. OBJECTIVE: To systematically review the scientific literature and provide a comprehensive summary on the neuroprotective action and the mechanisms involved in the cytoprotective effects of TUDCA. METHODS: A systematic review was conducted in accordance with the PRISMA (The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines. Systematic literature search of United States National Library of Medicine (PubMed), Web of Science, Embase, Scopus and Cochrane Library was performed, which covered all original articles published up to July 2022. The terms, \"TUDCA\" in combination with \"retina\", \"retinal protection\", \"neuroprotection\" were searched. Possible biases were identified with the adopted SYRCLE's tool. RESULTS: Of the 423 initially gathered studies, 24 articles met inclusion/exclusion criteria for full-text review. Six of them were in vitro experiments, 17 studies reported in vivo data and one study described both in vitro and in vivo data. The results revealed the effect of TUDCA on different retinal diseases, such as retinitis pigmentosa (RP), diabetic retinopathy (DR), retinal degeneration (RD), retinal ganglion cell (RGC) injury, Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON), choroidal neovascularization (CNV), and retinal detachment (RDT). The quality scores of the in vivo studies were ranged from 5 to 7 points (total 10 points), according to SYRCLE's risk of bias tool. Both in vitro and in vivo data suggested that TUDCA could effectively delay degeneration and apoptosis of retinal neurons, preserve retinal structure and function, and its mechanism of actions might be related with inhibiting apoptosis, decreasing inflammation, attenuating oxidative stress, suppressing endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, and reducing angiogenesis. CONCLUSION: This systematic review demonstrated that TUDCA has neuroprotective effect on in vivo and in vitro models of retinal disorders, reinforcing the currently available evidence that TUDCA could be a promising therapeutic agent in retinal diseases treatment. However, well designed clinical trials are necessary to appraise the efficacy of TUDCA in clinical setting.",

      "abstract": "Inflammation and hypoxia have an effect on the molecular mechanism of cardiovascular and respiratory pathologies accompanying seizures. Against this, Tauroursodeoxycholic Acid (TUDCA) can regulate oxidative stress, inflammation and cellular survival by suppressing endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. We evaluated the expression changes of NF-κB p65, TNF-α, HIF1α and Kir6.2 proteins associated with seizures in brain stem, heart and lung tissues representing the autonomous network. Additionally, we examined the protective effects of TUDCA administration against damage caused by seizures in terms of immunohistochemistry and pathology. 4 groups of Wistar Albino male rats (250-300 g, n=32) were formed as control, pentylenetetrazole (PTZ), TUDCA and PTZ+TUDCA. The epilepsy kindling model was created by intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of PTZ chemical (35 mg/kg, every 2 days) for one month. TUDCA (500 mg/kg; every 2 days) treatment was given intraperitoneally 30 minutes before seizures for 1 month. Brain stem, heart (atria, ventricle) and lung tissues of rats were isolated. NF-κB p65, TNF-α, HIF1α and Kir6.2 proteins in the obtained tissues were evaluated by immunohistochemical staining. The immunoreactivity of the investigated proteins in the brainstem heart and lung tissues of rats with chronic PTZ administration was significantly increased. Recurrent seizures led to accumulation of inflammatory cells in tissues, hemorrhage, vasodilation, and apoptosis. Following TUDCA administration, expression of NF-κB p65, TNF-α and Kir6.2 was significantly reduced in all tissues (except the atrium of the heart) compared to control rats. HIF-1α levels were significantly suppressed in ventricular and lung tissues of epileptic rats given TUDCA. However, TUDCA pretreatment improved histopathological changes due to chronic seizures and partially reduced apoptosis. We showed that epileptic seizures may cause tissue damage with the development of inflammatory and hypoxic conditions in the brainstem and organs that represent the autonomic network. TUDCA therapy could be an effective agent in the treatment of cardiac and respiratory problems associated with seizures.",

      "abstract": "Advanced maternal age (≥35 years) is associated with an increased risk of pregnancy complications such as fetal growth restriction and preeclampsia. We previously demonstrated poor pregnancy outcomes (reduced fetal body weight), altered vascular function, and increased expression of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress markers (phospho-eIF2α and CHOP) in mesenteric arteries from a rat model of advanced maternal age. Further, treatment of aged dams during pregnancy with an ER stress inhibitor, tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA) increased fetal body weight (both male and female), tended to improve uterine artery function, and reduced expression of phospho-eIF2α and CHOP in systemic arteries. Placental ER stress has been linked to poor pregnancy outcomes in complicated pregnancies but whether placental ER stress is evident in advanced maternal age is not known. In addition, sex-specific changes in the placental labyrinth and junctional zones from male and female offspring in advanced maternal age have not been investigated. Therefore, the current study aimed to investigate the effect of TUDCA intervention on placental ER stress. We hypothesize that placental ER stress is increased in a rat model of advanced maternal age that is alleviated by TUDCA intervention for both sexes. Placental ER stress markers (GRP78, phospho-eIF2α, ATF-4, CHOP, ATF-6α, and sXBP-1) were quantified by Western blot in placentas from male and female offspring; the labyrinth and junction zones were analyzed separately. In the placental labyrinth zone from male offspring, only GRP78 (p = 0.007) was increased in aged dams compared to young dams; TUDCA treatment reduced the placental expression of GRP78 in aged dams (p = 0.003). In addition, TUDCA reduced the levels of phospho-eIF2α (p = 0.021), ATF-4 (p = 0.016), and CHOP (p = 0.012) in aged dams but no effect was observed in young TUDCA-treated dams. In the placental labyrinth zone from female offspring, an increased level of phospho-eIF2α (p = 0.005) was observed in aged dams compared to young dams, and TUDCA treatment had no effect in both young and aged groups. In the placental junctional zone from male and female offspring, no changes in the expression of GRP78, phospho-eIF2α, ATF-4, CHOP, and ATF-6α was observed with or without TUDCA treatment in both young and aged groups, however, a reduced expression of sXBP-1 protein was observed in from both male (p = 0.001) and female (p = 0.031) placentas from aged-TUDCA treated dams compared to aged control. In conclusion, our data highlight the complexity and sex-specificity of ER stress responses in advanced maternal age with TUDCA treatment maintaining ER stress proteins to basal levels and improving fetal growth in both male and female offspring.",

      "abstract": "Adipose tissue is an organ with metabolic and endocrine activity. White, brown and ectopic adipose tissues have different structure, location, and function. Adipose tissue regulates energy homeostasis, providing energy in nutrient-deficient conditions and storing it in high-supply conditions. To attend to the high demand for energy storage during obesity, the adipose tissue undergoes morphological, functional and molecular changes. Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress has been evidenced as a molecular hallmark of metabolic disorders. In this sense, the ER stress inhibitor tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA), a bile acid conjugated to taurine with chemical chaperone activity, has emerged as a therapeutic strategy to minimize adipose tissue dysfunction and metabolic alterations associated with obesity. In this review, we highlight the effects of TUDCA and receptors TGR5 and FXR on adipose tissue in the setting of obesity. TUDCA has been demonstrated to limit metabolic disturbs associated to obesity by inhibiting ER stress, inflammation, and apoptosis in adipocytes. The beneficial effect of TUDCA on perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) function and adiponectin release may be related to cardiovascular protection in obesity, although more studies are needed to clarify the mechanisms. Therefore, TUDCA has emerged as a potential therapeutic strategy for obesity and comorbidities.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a chronic neurodegenerative rare disease that affects motor neurons in the brain, brainstem, and spinal cord, resulting in progressive weakness and atrophy of voluntary skeletal muscles. Although much has been achieved in understanding the disease pathogenesis, treatment options are limited, and in Europe, riluzole is the only approved drug. Recently, some other drugs showed minor effects. METHODS: The TUDCA-ALS trial is a phase III, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group clinical trial. The study aims to enroll 320 patients in 25 centers across seven countries in Europe. Enrolled patients are randomized to one of two treatment arms: TUDCA or identical placebo by oral route. The study measures disease progression during the treatment period and compares it to natural progression during a no-treatment run-in phase. Clinical data and specific biomarkers are measured during the trial. The study is coordinated by a consortium composed of leading European ALS centers. CONCLUSION: This trial is aimed to determine whether TUDCA has a disease-modifying activity in ALS. Demonstration of TUDCA efficacy, combined with the validation of new biomarkers, could advance ALS patient care. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov, identifier: NCT03800524."

Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress has been linked to adverse pregnancy outcomes in these complicated pregnancies. However, the role of ER stress in advanced maternal age is not known. We hypothesize that increased ER stress contributes to altered vascular function and poor pregnancy outcomes, and that treatment with the ER-stress inhibitor TUDCA will improve pregnancy outcomes. First, young and aged non-pregnant/pregnant rats were used to assess ER stress markers in mesenteric arteries; mesenteric artery phospho-eIF2α and CHOP expression were increased in aged dams compared to young dams. In a second study, young and aged control and TUDCA-treated dams were studied on gestational day (GD) 20 (term = 22 days). TUDCA treatment was provided via the drinking water throughout pregnancy (GD0-GD20; calculated dose of 150 mg/kg/day TUDCA). ER stress markers were quantified in mesenteric arteries, blood pressure was measured, pregnancy outcomes were recorded, mesenteric and main uterine arteries were isolated and vascular function was assessed by wire myography. Aged dams had increased phospho-eIF2α and CHOP expression, reduced fetal weight, reduced litter size, and impaired uterine artery relaxation. In the aged dams, TUDCA treatment reduced phospho-eIF2α and CHOP expression, reduced blood pressure, improved fetal body weight, and tended to improve uterine artery function compared to control-treated aged dams. In conclusion, our data illustrate the role of ER stress, as well as TUDCA as a potential therapeutic that may benefit pregnancy outcomes in advanced maternal age."

      "abstract": "Bile acid tauroursodeoxycholic (TUDCA), formed from the association of ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) with taurine, has already been shown to increase mitochondrial biogenesis and cell survival, in addition to reduce reticulum stress markers in different cell types. However, its mechanism of action upon insulin secretion control in obesity is still unknown. In this sense, we seek to clarify whether taurine, associated with bile acid, could improve the function of the pancreatic β-cells exposed to fatty acids through the regulation of mitochondrial metabolism. To test this idea, insulin-producing cells (INS1-E) were exposed to a fatty acid mix containing 500 μM of each palmitate and oleate for 48 hours treated or not with 300 μM of TUDCA. After that, glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and markers of mitochondrial metabolism were evaluated. Our results showed that the fatty acid mix was efficient in inducing hyperfunction of INS1-E cells as observed by the increase in insulin secretion, protein expression of citrate synthase, and mitochondrial density, without altering cell viability. The treatment with TUDCA normalized insulin secretion, reducing the protein expression of citrate synthase, mitochondrial mass, and the mitochondrial membrane potential. This effect was associated with a decrease in the generation of mitochondrial superoxide and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) protein content. The findings are also consistent with the hypothesis that TUDCA normalizes insulin secretion by improving mitochondrial metabolism and redox balance. Thus, it highlights likely mechanisms of the action of this bile acid on the glycemic homeostasis reestablishment in obesity.",

      "abstract": "The existence of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in neurodegenerative diseases has been well established. Tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA) is a bile acid taurine conjugate derived from ursodeoxycholic acid, which has been reported to exert cytoprotective effects on several types of cells by inhibiting ER stress. The present study explored the effects of TUDCA on primary cultured rat dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons. Cell viability and apoptosis of DRG neurons treated with TUDCA and tunicamycin were detected by CellTiter-Blue assay and TUNEL staining, respectively. The protein levels and phosphorylation of apoptosis and ERS-related signaling pathway molecules were detected by western blot, and the mRNA levels of related genes were assessed by reverse transcription-quantitative PCR. Notably, TUDCA had no significant cytotoxic effect on DRG neurons at concentrations ≤250 µM. In addition, the apoptosis induced by tunicamycin exposure was markedly suppressed by TUDCA, as indicated by the percentage of TUNEL-positive cells, the activities of caspases and the changes in expression levels of critical apoptosis factors. Furthermore, the cytotoxicity of tunicamycin in DRG neurons was accompanied by an increase in malondialdehyde (MDA) content, reactive oxygen species (ROS) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) production, and a decrease in glutathione (GSH) levels. The changes in oxidative stress-related factors (ROS, LDH, MDA and GSH) were reversed by TUDCA. Furthermore, as determined by western blotting, the increase in C/EBP homologous protein, glucose-regulated protein 78 and cleaved caspase-12 expression following tunicamycin treatment suggested the activation of ER stress. Downregulation of ER stress components and unfolded protein response sensors by TUDCA confirmed the implication of ER stress in the effects of TUDCA on DRG neurons. In conclusion, the present study indicated that TUDCA may protect against tunicamycin-induced DRG apoptosis by suppressing the activation of ER stress. The protective effect and the therapeutic value of TUDCA in nervous system injury require further study in animal models."

      "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder and the most common cause of dementia. While cognitive deficits remain the major manifestation of AD, metabolic and non-cognitive abnormalities, such as alterations in food intake, body weight and energy balance are also present, both in AD patients and animal models. In this sense, the tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA) has shown beneficial effects both in reducing the central and cognitive markers of AD, as well as in attenuating the metabolic disorders associated with it. We previously demonstrated that TUDCA improves glucose homeostasis and decreases the main AD neuromarkers in the streptozotocin-induced AD mouse model (Stz). Besides that, TUDCA-treated Stz mice showed lower body weight and adiposity. Here, we investigated the actions of TUDCA involved in the regulation of body weight and adiposity in Stz mice, since the effects of TUDCA in hypothalamic appetite control and energy homeostasis have not yet been explored in an AD mice model. The TUDCA-treated mice (Stz + TUDCA) displayed lower food intake, higher energy expenditure (EE) and respiratory quotient. In addition, we observed in the hypothalamus of the Stz + TUDCA mice reduced fluorescence and gene expression of inflammatory markers, as well as normalization of the orexigenic neuropeptides AgRP and NPY expression. Moreover, leptin-induced p-JAK2 and p-STAT3 signaling in the hypothalamus of Stz + TUDCA mice was improved, accompanied by reduced acute food intake after leptin stimulation. Taken together, we demonstrate that TUDCA treatment restores energy metabolism in Stz mice, a phenomenon that is associated with reduced food intake, increased EE and improved hypothalamic leptin signaling. These findings suggest treatment with TUDCA as a promising therapeutic intervention for the control of energy homeostasis in AD individuals.",

      "abstract": "Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is a group of genetically diverse inherited disorders characterised by the progressive photoreceptors and pigment epithelial cell dysfunction leading to central vision impairment. Although important advances in the understanding of the pathophysiologic pathways involved in RP have been made, drug delivery for the treatment of ocular disorders affecting the posterior segment of the eye is still an unmet clinical need. In the present study, we describe the development of multi-loaded PLGA-microspheres (MSs) incorporating two neuroprotectants agents (glial cell-line-derived neurotrophic factor-GDNF and Tauroursodeoxycholic acid-TUDCA) as a potential therapeutic tool for the treatment of RP. A solid-in-oil-in-water (S/O/W) emulsion solvent extraction-evaporation technique was employed for MS preparation. A combination of PLGA and vitamin E was used to create the microcarriers. The morphology, particle size, encapsulation efficiency and in vitro release profile of the MSs were studied. Encapsulation efficiencies of GDNF and TUDCA for the initial multiloaded MSs, prepared with methylene chloride (MC) as organic solvent and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) solution in the external phase, were 28.53±0.36% and 45.65±8.01% respectively. Different technological parameters to optimise the formulation such as the incorporation of a water-soluble co-solvent ethanol (EtOH) in the internal organic phase, as well as NaCl concentration, and viscosity using a viscosizing agent (hydroxypropyl methylcellulose-HPMC) in the external aqueous phase were considered. EtOH incorporation and external phase viscosity of the emulsion were critical attributes for improving drug loading of both compounds. In such a way, when using a methylene chloride/EtOH ratio 75:25 into the inner organic phase and the viscosity agent HPMC (1% w/v) in the external aqueous phase, GDNF and TUDCA payloads resulted 48.86±1.49% and 78.58±10.40% respectively, and a decrease in the initial release of GDNF was observed (22.03±1.41% compared with 40.86±6.66% of the initial multi-loaded formulation). These optimised microparticles exhibited sustained in vitro releases over 91 days. These results suggest that the microencapsulation procedure optimised in this work presents a promising technological strategy for the development of multi-loaded intraocular drug delivery systems (IODDS).",

      "abstract": "Osteoarthritis (OA) is considered one of the most common arthritic diseases characterized by progressive degradation and abnormal remodeling of articular cartilage. Potential therapeutics for OA aim at restoring proper chondrocyte functioning and inhibiting apoptosis. Previous studies have demonstrated that tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA) showed anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic activity in many models of various diseases, acting mainly via alleviation of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. However, little is known about cytoprotective effects of TUDCA on chondrocyte cells. The present study was designed to evaluate potential effects of TUDCA on interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and tunicamycin (TNC)-stimulated NHAC-kn chondrocytes cultured in normoxic and hypoxic conditions. Our results showed that TUDCA alleviated ER stress in TNC-treated chondrocytes, as demonstrated by reduced CHOP expression; however, it was not effective enough to prevent apoptosis of NHAC-kn cells in either normoxia nor hypoxia. However, co-treatment with TUDCA alleviated inflammatory response induced by IL-1β, as shown by down regulation of Il-1β, Il-6, Il-8 and Cox2, and increased the expression of antioxidant enzyme Sod2. Additionally, TUDCA enhanced Col IIα expression in IL-1β- and TNC-stimulated cells, but only in normoxic conditions. Altogether, these results suggest that although TUDCA may display chondoprotective potential in ER-stressed cells, further analyses are still necessary to fully confirm its possible recommendation as potential candidate in OA therapy.",

      "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive motor disease of unknown etiology. Although neuroprotective ability of endogenous bile acid, tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA), shown in various diseases, including an acute model of PD,the potential therapeutic role of TUDCA in progressive models of PD that exhibit all aspects of PD has not been elucidated. In the present study, mice were assigned to one of four treatment groups: (1) Probenecid (PROB); (2) TUDCA, (3) MPTP + PROB (MPTPp); and (3) TUDCA + MPTPp. Methods: Markers for dopaminergic function, neuroinflammation, oxidative stress and autophagy were assessed using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), immunohistochemistry (IHC) and western blot (WB) methods. Locomotion was measured before and after treatments. Results: MPTPp decreased the expression of dopamine transporters (DAT) and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), indicating dopaminergic damage, and induced microglial and astroglial activation as demonstrated by IHC analysis. MPTPp also decreased DA and its metabolites as demonstrated by HPLC analysis. Further, MPTPp-induced protein oxidation; increased LAMP-1 expression indicated autophagy and the promotion of alpha-synuclein (α-SYN) aggregation. Discussion: Pretreatment with TUDCA protected against dopaminergic neuronal damage, prevented the microglial and astroglial activation, as well as the DA and DOPAC reductions caused by MPTPp. TUDCA by itself did not produce any significant change, with data similar to the negative control group. Pretreatment with TUDCA prevented protein oxidation and autophagy, in addition to inhibiting α-SYN aggregation. Although TUDCA pretreatment did not significantly affect locomotion, only acute treatment effects were measured, indicating more extensive assessments may be necessary to reveal potential therapeutic effects on behavior. Together, these results suggest that autophagy may be involved in the progression of PD and that TUDCA may attenuate these effects. The efficacy of TUDCA as a novel therapy in patients with PD clearly warrants further study.",

      "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder and the major cause of dementia. According to predictions of the World Health Organization, more than 150 million people worldwide will suffer from dementia by 2050. An increasing number of studies have associated AD with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), since most of the features found in T2DM are also observed in AD, such as insulin resistance and glucose intolerance. In this sense, some bile acids have emerged as new therapeutic targets to treat AD and metabolic disorders. The taurine conjugated bile acid, tauroursodeoxycholic (TUDCA), reduces amyloid oligomer accumulation and improves cognition in APP/PS1 mice model of AD, and also improves glucose-insulin homeostasis in obese and type 2 diabetic mice. Herein, we investigated the effect of TUDCA upon glucose metabolism in streptozotocin-induced AD mice model (Stz). The Stz mice that received 300 mg/kg TUDCA during 10 days (Stz + TUDCA), showed improvement in glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity, reduced fasted and fed glycemia, increased islet mass and β-cell area, as well as increased glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, compared with Stz mice that received only PBS. Stz + TUDCA mice also displayed lower neuroinflammation, reduced protein content of amyloid oligomer in the hippocampus, improved memory test and increased protein content of insulin receptor β-subunit in the hippocampus. In conclusion, TUDCA treatment enhanced glucose homeostasis in the streptozotocin-induced Alzheimer's disease mice model, pointing this bile acid as a good strategy to counteract glucose homeostasis disturbance in AD pathology.",

METHODS: ER stress-associated genes and apoptosis-associated genes were measured and apoptosis index was analyzed. Embryo developmental competence was assessed in vitro and in vivo via the inner cell mass (ICM)/trophectoderm (TE) index, pregnancy and implantation rates, and birth rate. RESULTS: The relative mRNA and protein expression of binding immunoglobulin protein (BIP) was significantly higher in the ICSI embryo group without TUDCA treatment (ICSI-C) than in the in vitro fertilization (IVF) group and in the ICSI embryo group with TUDCA treatment (200 μM) (ICSI-T), while TUDCA ameliorated ER stress in ICSI embryos. Embryos in the ICSI-C group showed a higher apoptosis index than those in the IVF group and ICSI-T group, and there was no significant difference between the IVF group and ICSI-T group. TUDCA can significantly improve ICSI embryo developmental competence in vitro and in vivo based on the ICM/TE index, pregnancy and implantation rates, and birth rate. CONCLUSION: ICSI embryos manifested high ER stress and high apoptosis, while TUDCA ameliorated ER stress and reduced apoptosis in ICSI embryos. TUDCA can significantly improve the developmental competence of ICSI embryos in vitro and in vivo. This study provides a new idea for improving the efficiency of ICSI, and it will also have a positive effect on the development of assisted reproduction technologies for humans and other animals.",

Tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA) is a recognized endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) inhibitor which can inhibit cell apoptosis. Recently, intestinal cell apoptosis has been demonstrated to be vital for the pathogenesis of NEC. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the potential of TUDCA in the treatment of NEC and the possible mechanisms in vivo and in vitro. Our results showed that TUDCA reduced mortality rates, prolonged survival times, significantly diminished intestinal damage, and inhibited intestinal inflammation in the mouse model of NEC. The protective effect of TUDCA on the NEC mouse model was realized through inhibiting the expression levels of ERS markers and inhibiting the apoptosis of intestinal cells. In addition, TUDCA increased the expression of phospho-Akt (p-Akt). Furthermore, we confirmed that TUDCA inhibited the apoptosis of intestinal cells by modulating the PERK-eIF2α ERS pathway and the Akt pathway in vitro studies. Besides, TUDCA effects were impaired by AKT specific inhibitor MK2206 in vitro studies. Therefore, these results indicated that TUDCA alleviated intestinal injury in a mouse model of NEC and inhibited ERS-mediated intestinal cell apoptosis by activating the Akt pathway.",

In the last decades, there have been great advances in the understanding of BA physiology, and new insights have emerged regarding the role of BAs in determining cell damage and death in several liver diseases. This new knowledge has helped to better delineate the pathophysiology of cholestasis and the adaptive responses of hepatocytes to cholestatic liver injury as well as of the mechanisms of injury of biliary epithelia. In this context, therapeutic approaches for liver diseases using hydrophilic BA (i.e., ursodeoxycholic acid, tauroursodeoxycholic, and, more recently, norursodeoxycholic acid), have been revamped. In the present review, we summarize current experimental and clinical data regarding these BAs and its role in the treatment of certain liver diseases.",

      "abstract": "Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is characterized by impairment in beta-cell mass and insulin levels, resulting in hyperglycemia and diabetic complications. Since diagnosis, appropriate control of glycaemia in T1D requires insulin administration, which can result in side effects, such as hypoglycemia. In this sense, some bile acids have emerged as new therapeutic targets to treat T1D and T2D, as well as metabolic diseases. The taurine conjugated bile acid, tauroursodeoxycholic (TUDCA) reduces the incidence of T1D development and improves glucose homeostasis in obese and T2D mice. However, its effects in early-stage of T1D have not been well explored. Therefore, we have assessed the effects of TUDCA on the glycemic control of mice with early-stage T1D. To achieve this, C57BL/6 mice received intraperitoneal administration of streptozotocin (STZ, 40 mg/kg) for 5 days. Once diabetes was confirmed in the STZ mice, they received TUDCA treatment (300 mg/kg) or phosphate buffered saline (PBS) for 24 days. After 15 days of treatment, the STZ+TUDCA mice showed a 43% reduction in blood glucose, compared with the STZ group. This reduction was likely due to an increase in insulinemia. This increase in insulinemia may be explained, at least in part, by a reduction in hepatic IDE activity and, consequently, reduction on insulin clearance, as well as an increase in beta-cell mass and a higher beta-cell number per islet. Also, the groups did not present any alterations in insulin sensitivity. All together, these effects contributed to the improvement of glucose metabolism in T1D mice, pointing TUDCA as a potential therapeutic agent for the glycemic control in early-stage of T1D."

      "abstract": "Cholesterol and lipid metabolism are associated with osteoarthritis (OA) in human cartilage. High cholesterol levels in OA chondrocytes leads to decreased membrane fluidity and blocks the signaling cascade associated with the expression of chondrogenic genes. It is known that bile acid plays a role in regulating cholesterol homeostasis and the digestion of fats in the human body. Tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA), as a member of the bile acid family, also aids in the transport of cellular cholesterol. In this study, we hypothesized that TUDCA might be able to promote the restoration of OA cartilage by reducing membrane cholesterol levels in OA chondrocytes and by stimulating the chondrogenic signaling cascade. To assess this hypothesis, we investigated the effects of TUDCA on degenerated chondrocytes isolated from patients with OA. Importantly, treatment with TUDCA at sub-micellar concentrations (2500 μM) significantly increased cell proliferation and Cyclin D1 expression compared with the controls. In addition, the expression of chondrogenic marker genes (SOX9, COL2, and ACAN), proteins (SOX9 and COL2), and glycosaminoglycan (Chondroitin sulfate) was much higher in the TUDCA-treated group compared to the controls. We also found that TUDCA treatment significantly reduced the intracellular cholesterol levels in the chondrocytes and increased membrane fluidity. Furthermore, the stability of TGF receptor 1 and activity of focal adhesion proteins were also increased following TUDCA treatment. Together, these results demonstrated that TUDCA could be used as an alternative treatment for the restoration of OA cartilage.",

In a murine hindlimb ischemia model with CKD, tail vein injection of TUDCA-treated CKD-hMSCs improved the functional recovery, including kidney recovery, limb salvage, blood perfusion ratio, and vessel formation along with restored expression of PrPC in the blood serum of the mice.

      "abstract": "Chronic kidney disease (CKD) leads to the loss of kidney function, as well as the dysfunction of several other organs due to the release of uremic toxins into the system. In a murine CKD model, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress are increased in the hippocampus. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are one of the candidates for cell-based therapy for CKD; however severe pathophysiological conditions can decrease their therapeutic potential. To address these issues, we established tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA)-treated MSCs using MSCs isolated from patients with CKD (CKD-hMSCs) and assessed the survival and ROS generation of neural cell line SH-SY5Y cells by co-culturing with TUDCA-treated CKD-hMSCs. In the presence of the uremic toxin P-cresol, the death of SH-SY5Y cells was induced by ROS-mediated ER stress. Co-culture with TUDCA-treated CKD-hMSCs increased anti-oxidant enzyme activities in SH-SY5Y cells through the upregulation of the cellular prion protein (PrPC) expression. Upregulated PrPC expression in SH-SY5Y cells protected against CKD-mediated ER stress and apoptosis. In an adenine-induced murine CKD model, injection with TUDCA-treated CKD-hMSCs suppressed ROS generation and ER stress in the hippocampus. These results indicate that TUDCA-treated CKD-hMSCs prevent the CKD-mediated cell death of SH-SY5Y cells by inhibiting ER stress. Our study suggests that treatment with TUDCA could be a powerful strategy for developing autologous MSC-based therapeutics for patients with CKD, and that PrPC might be a pivotal target for protecting neural cells from CKD-mediated ER stress.",

METHODS: ETB -deficient and transgenic control rats were placed on normal (0.8% NaCl) or high salt (8% NaCl) diet for 3 weeks, receiving TUDCA (400 mg/kg/d; ip) or vehicle. Histological and biochemical markers of kidney injury, renal cell death and renal inflammation were assessed. RESULTS: In ETB -deficient rats, high salt diet significantly increased glomerular and proximal tubular histological injury, proteinuria, albuminuria, excretion of tubular injury markers KIM-1 and NGAL, renal cortical cell death and renal CD4+ T cell numbers. TUDCA treatment increased proximal tubule megalin expression as well as prevented high salt diet-induced glomerular and tubular damage in ETB -deficient rats, as indicated by reduced kidney injury markers, decreased glomerular permeability and proximal tubule brush border restoration, as well as reduced renal inflammation. However, TUDCA had no significant effect on blood pressure. CONCLUSIONS: TUDCA protects against the development of glomerular and proximal tubular damage, decreases renal cell death and inflammation in the renal cortex in rats with ETB receptor dysfunction on a chronic high salt diet. These results highlight the potential use of TUDCA as a preventive tool against chronic high salt induced renal damage.",

      "abstract": "Chicken gallbladder has long been considered to be worthless and discarded as waste. The main composition of chicken bile is taurochenodeoxycholic acid (TCDCA), which is the isomeride of tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA). TUDCA has been effectively used for treatment of many diseases. In this paper, 7α- and 7β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases (HSDH) were co-immobilised on modified chitosan microspheres, and used as recyclable biocatalyst for the catalysis of chicken bile. The catalytic reaction reached equilibrium within 4 h compared with 1 h using TCDCA as substrate. After four continuous batch reactions, the conversion of TCDCA was lower than 40% and TUDCA yield was about 15% for the catalysis of chicken bile. TUDCA yield was approximately 62% after equilibrium and the content of TUDCA in reaction product was as high as 33.16%. Furthermore, the experiments showed that activity of enzymes were significantly inhibited by bilirubin, Cu2+ and Ca2+ in complex substrate. The research described not only widens the utilization of chicken bile, but also provides a clean way for the preparation of TUDCA."

      "abstract": "Disruption of insulin secretion and clearance both contribute to obesity-induced hyperinsulinemia, though reduced insulin clearance seems to be the main factor. The liver is the major site for insulin degradation, a process mainly coordinated by the insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE). The beneficial effects of taurine conjugated bile acid (TUDCA) on insulin secretion as well as insulin sensitivity have been recently described. However, the possible role of TUDCA in insulin clearance had not yet been explored. Here, we demonstrated that 15 days treatment with TUDCA reestablished plasma insulin to physiological concentrations in high fat diet (HFD) mice, a phenomenon associated with increased insulin clearance and liver IDE expression. TUDCA also increased IDE expression in human hepatic cell line HepG2. This effect was not observed in the presence of an inhibitor of the hepatic membrane bile acid receptor, S1PR2, nor when its downstream proteins were inhibited, including IR, PI3K and Akt. These results indicate that treatment with TUDCA may be helpful to counteract obesity-induced hyperinsulinemia through increasing insulin clearance, likely through enhanced liver IDE expression in a mechanism dependent on S1PR2-Insulin pathway activation.",

      "abstract": "Bile acid transporters and the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor (Nrf-2)-mediated adaptive response play important roles in the development of drug-induced liver injury (DILI). However, little is known about the contribution of the adaptive response to rifampicin (RFP)-induced cell injury. In this study, we found RFP decreased the survival rate of HepG2 cells and increased the levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (AKP), γ-glutamyl-transferase (γ-GT), total bilirubin (TBIL), direct bilirubin (DBIL), indirect bilirubin (IBIL), total bile acid (TBA) and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) in the cell culture supernatants in both a concentration- and a time-dependent manner. RFP increased the expression levels of bile acid transporter proteins and mRNAs, such as bile salt export pump (BSEP), multidrug resistance protein 1 (MDR1), multidrug resistance-associated protein 2 (MRP2), Na+/taurocholate cotransporter (NTCP), organic anion transporting protein 2 (OATP2), organic solute transporter β (OSTβ) and Nrf2. Following the transient knockdown of Nrf2 and treatment with RFP, the expression levels of the BSEP, MDR1, MRP2, NTCP, OATP2 and OSTβ proteins and mRNAs were decreased to different degrees. Moreover, the cell survival was decreased, whereas the LDH level in the cell culture supernatant was increased. Overexpression of the Nrf2 gene produced the opposite effects. Treatment with tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA) increased the expression levels of the bile acid transporters and Nrf2, decreased the expression levels of glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78), PKR-like ER kinase (PERK), activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4), and C/EBP-homologous protein (CHOP), and inhibited RFP-induced oxidative stress. Moreover, TUDCA reduced cell apoptosis, increased cell survival and decreased the levels of LDH, ALT, AST, AKP, γ-GT, TBIL, DBIL, IBIL, TBA and ATP in the cell culture supernatant. Therefore, TUDCA alleviates RFP-induced injury in HepG2 cells by enhancing bile acid transporters expression and the Nrf2-mediated adaptive response.",

TUDCA, unlike PBA, enhances trypsin mediated digestion of BSA. TUDCA activates PERK, an ER-resident kinase that phosphorylates the alpha-subunit of eukaryotic initiation factor2 (eIF2α) and promotes the expression of activated transcription factor 4 (ATF4) in HepG2 cells. In contrast, PBA induced eIF2α phosphorylation is not mediated by PERK activation and results in low ATF4 expression. Neither chaperones promote expression of BiP, an ER chaperone, and CHOP (C/EBP homologous protein), downstream target of eIF2α-ATF4 pathway. Both chaperones mitigate tunicamycin induced PERK-eIF2α-ATF4-CHOP arm of UPR and expression of BiP. TUDCA, unlike PBA does not decrease cell viability and it also mitigates tunicamycin, UV-irradiation and PBA induced PARP (poly ADP-ribose polymerase) cleavage and cell death. These findings therefore suggest that TUDCA's antiapoptotic activity to protect HepG2 cells and PBA's activity that limits tumor cell progression may be important while considering their therapeutic potential.",

      "abstract": "Pressure overload in the heart induces pathological hypertrophy and is associated with cardiac dysfunction. Apoptosis and fibrosis signaling initiated by the endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) is known to contribute to these maladaptive effects. The aim of this study was to investigate whether reduction of ERS by a known chemical chaperone, tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA) can attenuate pressure overload-induced cardiac remodeling in a mouse model of transverse aortic constriction (TAC). Oral administration of TUDCA at a dose of 300 mg/kg body weight (BW) in the TUDCA-TAC group reduced ERS markers (GRP78, p-PERK, and p-eIf2α), compared to the Vehicle (Veh)-TAC group. TUDCA administration, for 4 weeks after TAC significantly reduced cardiac hypertrophy as shown by the reduced heart weight (HW) to BW ratio, and expression of hypertrophic marker genes (ANF, BNP, and α-SKA). Masson's trichrome staining showed that myocardial fibrosis and collagen deposition were also significantly reduced in the TUDCA-TAC group. We also found that TUDCA significantly decreased expression of TGF-β signaling proteins and collagen isoforms. TUDCA administration also reduced cardiac apoptosis and the related proteins in the TUDCA-TAC group. Microarray analysis followed by gene ontology (GO) and pathway analysis demonstrated that extracellular matrix genes responsible for hypertrophy and fibrosis, and mitochondrial genes responsible for apoptosis and fatty acid metabolism were significantly altered in the Veh-TAC group, but the alterations were normalized in the TUDCA-TAC group, suggesting potential of TUDCA in treatment of heart diseases related to pressure-overload.",

      "abstract": "Bile acids are steroid acids found in the bile of mammals. The bile acid conjugate tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA) is neuroprotective in different animal models of stroke and neurological diseases. We have previously shown that TUDCA has anti-inflammatory effects on glial cell cultures and in a mouse model of acute neuroinflammation. We show now that microglial cells (central nervous system resident macrophages) express the G protein-coupled bile acid receptor 1/Takeda G protein-coupled receptor 5 (GPBAR1/TGR5) in vivo and in vitro. TUDCA binding to GPBAR1/TGR5 caused an increase in intracellular cAMP levels in microglia that induced anti-inflammatory markers, while reducing pro-inflammatory ones. This anti-inflammatory effect of TUDCA was inhibited by small interference RNA for GPBAR1/TGR5 receptor, as well as by treatment with a protein kinase A (PKA) inhibitor. In the mouse model of acute neuroinflammation, treating the animals with TUDCA was clearly anti-inflammatory. TUDCA biased the microglial phenotype in vivo and in vitro toward the anti-inflammatory. The bile acid receptor GPBAR1/TGR5 could be a new therapeutic target for pathologies coursing with neuroinflammation and microglia activation, such as traumatic brain injuries, stroke, or neurodegenerative diseases. TUDCA and other GPBAR1/TGR5 agonists need to be further investigated, to determine their potential in attenuating the neuropathologies associated with microglia activation. J. Cell.

To further evaluate the efficacy and safety of TUDCA for primary biliary cholangitis (PBC), we performed this study on Chinese patients. METHODS: 199 PBC patients were randomly assigned to either 250 mg TUDCA plus UDCA placebo or 250 mg UDCA plus TUDCA placebo, 3 times per day for 24 weeks. The primary endpoint was defined as percentage of patients achieving serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) reduction of more than 25% from baseline. RESULTS: At week 24, 75.97% of patients in the TUDCA group and 80.88% of patients in the UDCA group achieved a serum ALP reduction of more than 25% from baseline (P = 0.453). The percentage of patients with serum ALP levels declined more than 40% following 24 weeks of treatment was 55.81% in the TUDCA group and 52.94% in the UDCA group (P = 0.699). Both groups showed similar improvement in serum levels of ALP, aspartate aminotransferase, and total bilirubin (P > 0.05). The proportion of patients with pruritus/scratch increased from 1.43% to 10.00% in UDCA group, while there's no change in TUDCA group (P = 0.023). Both drugs were well tolerated, with comparable adverse event rates between the 2 groups. CONCLUSIONS: TUDCA is safe and as efficacious as UDCA for the treatment of PBC, and may be better to relieve symptoms than UDCA.",

Previous studies have demonstrated the ability of small compounds in preventing and reversing TTR V30M deposition in transgenic mice gastrointestinal (GI) tract as well as lowering biomarkers associated with cellular stress and apoptotic mechanisms. In the present study we aimed to study TTR V30M aggregates effect in autophagy, a cellular mechanism crucial for cell survival that has been implicated in the development of several neurodegenerative diseases. We were able to demonstrate in cell culture that TTR V30M aggregates cause a partial impairment of the autophagic machinery as shown by p62 accumulation, whereas early steps of the autophagic flux remain unaffected as shown by autophagosome number evaluation and LC3 turnover assay. Our studies performed in TTR V30M transgenic animals demonstrated that tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA) and curcumin effectively reverse p62 accumulation in the GI tract pointing to the ability of both compounds to modulate autophagy additionally to mitigate apoptosis. Overall, our in vitro and in vivo studies establish an association between TTR V30M aggregates and autophagy impairment and suggest the use of autophagy modulators as an additional and alternative therapeutic approach for the treatment of TTR V30M-related amyloidosis.",

      "abstract": "Objective. Tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA) has been considered an important regulator of energy metabolism in obesity. However, the mechanism underlying how TUDCA is involved in insulin resistance is not fully understood. We tested the effects of TUDCA on autophagic dysfunction in obese mice. Material and Methods. 500 mg/kg of TUDCA was injected into obese mice, and metabolic parameters, autophagy markers, and insulin signaling molecular were assessed by Western blotting and real-time PCR. Results. The TUDCA injections in the obese mice resulted in a reduced body weight gain, lower blood glucose, and improved insulin sensitivity compared with obese mice that were injected with vehicle. Meanwhile, TUDCA treatment not only reversed autophagic dysfunction and endoplasmic reticulum stress, but also improved the impaired insulin signaling in the liver of obese mice. Additionally, the same results obtained with TUDCA were evident in obese mice treated with the adenoviral Atg7. Conclusions. We found that TUDCA reversed abnormal autophagy, reduced ER stress, and restored insulin sensitivity in the liver of obese mice and that glycolipid metabolism disorder was also improved via the restoration of defective hepatic autophagy."

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: Renewal and elimination of the aged photoreceptor outer segment (POS) by RPE cells is a daily rhythmic process that is important for long-term vision. Phagocytic dysfunction results in photoreceptor cell death. Tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA), an endogenous bile acid, is known to show neuroprotective effects in stroke, neurological diseases, and retinal degeneration models. In this study, we investigated the effects of TUDCA on retinal phagocytosis. METHODS: We used pHrodo-succinimidyl ester (SE), a pH-sensitive fluorescent dye, to label the POS for monitoring phagocytosis. After ingestion, the intensity of pHrodo fluorescence increases because of the pH changes inside the liposome. An RPE cell line, ARPE-19, and primary human RPE cells were used to investigate the hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-induced disruption of phagocytosis in the pH-sensitive fluorescence POS phagocytosis assay. Additionally, we examined whether TUDCA could promote phagocytic function. RESULTS: The intensity of pHrodo light emission increased in a time-dependent manner. Tauroursodeoxycholic acid enhanced phagocytosis of POS and protected against H2O2-induced phagocytic dysfunction. It also promoted phagocytic function via activation of Mer tyrosine kinase receptor (MerTK), which is known to have a key role in the physiological renewal of POS. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that TUDCA activates MerTK, which is important for phagocytosis of POS. Tauroursodeoxycholic acid may represent a new therapeutic option for the treatment of retinal diseases.",

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: Mutations in either retinoid isomerase (RPE65) or lecithin-retinol acyltransferase (LRAT) lead to Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA). By using the Lrat(-/-) mouse model, previous studies have shown that the rapid cone degeneration in LCA was caused by endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress induced by S-opsin aggregation. The purpose of this study is to examine the efficacy of an ER chemical chaperone, tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA), in preserving cones in the Lrat(-/-) model. METHODS: Lrat(-/-) mice were systemically administered with TUDCA and vehicle (0.15 M NaHCO(3)) every 3 days from P9 to P28. Cone cell survival was determined by counting cone cells on flat-mounted retinas. The expression and subcellular localization of cone-specific proteins were analyzed by western blotting and immunohistochemistry, respectively. RESULTS: TUDCA treatment reduced ER stress and apoptosis in Lrat(-/-) retina. It significantly slowed down cone degeneration in Lrat(-/-) mice, resulting in a ∼3-fold increase in cone density in the ventral and central retina as compared with the vehicle-treated mice at P28. Furthermore, TUDCA promoted the degradation of cone membrane-associated proteins by enhancing the ER-associated protein degradation pathway. CONCLUSIONS: Systemic injection of TUDCA is effective in reducing ER stress, preventing apoptosis, and preserving cones in Lrat(-/-) mice. TUDCA has the potential to lead to the development of a new class of therapeutic drugs for treating LCA.",

      "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by accumulation of amyloid-β (Aβ) peptide in the hippocampus and frontal cortex of the brain, leading to progressive cognitive decline. The endogenous bile acid tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA) is a strong neuroprotective agent in several experimental models of disease, including neuronal exposure to Aβ. Nevertheless, the therapeutic role of TUDCA in AD pathology has not yet been ascertained. Here we report that feeding APP/PS1 double-transgenic mice with diet containing 0.4 % TUDCA for 6 months reduced accumulation of Aβ deposits in the brain, markedly ameliorating memory deficits. This was accompanied by reduced glial activation and neuronal integrity loss in TUDCA-fed APP/PS1 mice compared to untreated APP/PS1 mice. Furthermore, TUDCA regulated lipid-metabolism mediators involved in Aβ production and accumulation in the brains of transgenic mice. Overall amyloidogenic APP processing was reduced with TUDCA treatment, in association with, but not limited to, modulation of γ-secretase activity. Consequently, a significant decrease in Aβ(1-40) and Aβ(1-42) levels was observed in both hippocampus and frontal cortex of TUDCA-treated APP/PS1 mice, suggesting that chronic feeding of TUDCA interferes with Aβ production, possibly through the regulation of lipid-metabolism mediators associated with APP processing. These results highlight TUDCA as a potential therapeutic strategy for the prevention and treatment of AD.",

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: To evaluate and compare the protective effect of tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA) on photoreceptor degeneration in different models of retinal degeneration (RD) in mice. METHODS: Bbs(M390R/M390R) mice were injected subcutaneously twice a week, from P40 to P120, and rd10 mice were injected every 3 days from P6 to P38 with TUDCA or vehicle (0.15 M NaHCO(3)). Rd1 and rd16 mice were injected daily from P6 to P30 with TUDCA or vehicle. Retinal structure and function were determined at multiple time points by electroretinography (ERG), optical coherence tomography (OCT), and histology. RESULTS: The amplitude of ERG b-waves was significantly higher in TUDCA-treated Bbs1 and rd10 animals than in controls. Retinal thickness on OCT was slightly greater in treated Bbs1 animals than in the controls. Histologically, outer segments were preserved, and the outer nuclear layer was significantly thicker in the treated Bbs1 and rd10 mice than in the controls. Bbs1(M390R/M390R) mice developed less obesity than the control Bbs1(M390R/M390R) while receiving TUDCA. The Rd1 and rd16 mice showed no improvement with TUDCA treatment, and the rd1 mice did not have normal weight gain during treatment. CONCLUSIONS: TUDCA treatment preserved ERG b-waves and the outer nuclear layer in Bbs1(M390R/M390R) mice, and prevented obesity assessed at P120. TUDCA treatment preserved ERG b-waves and the outer nuclear layer in the rd10 mice to P30. TUDCA is a prime candidate for treatment of humans with retinal degeneration, especially those with Bardet-Biedl syndrome, whom it may help not only with the vision loss, but with the debilitating obesity as well.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Detachment of photoreceptors from the underlying retinal pigment epithelium is seen in various retinal disorders such as retinal detachment and age-related macular degeneration and leads to loss of photoreceptors and vision. Pharmacologic inhibition of photoreceptor cell death may prevent this outcome. This study tests whether systemic administration of tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA) can protect photoreceptors from cell death after experimental retinal detachment in rodents. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Retinal detachment was created in rats by subretinal injection of hyaluronic acid. The animals were treated daily with vehicle or TUDCA (500 mg/kg). TUNEL staining was used to evaluate cell death. Photoreceptor loss was evaluated by measuring the relative thickness of the outer nuclear layer (ONL). Macrophage recruitment, oxidative stress, cytokine levels, and caspase levels were also quantified. Three days after detachment, TUDCA decreased the number of TUNEL-positive cells compared to vehicle (651±68/mm(2) vs. 1314±68/mm(2), P = 0.001) and prevented the reduction of ONL thickness ratio (0.84±0.03 vs. 0.65±0.03, P = 0.002). Similar results were obtained after 5 days of retinal detachment. Macrophage recruitment and expression levels of TNF-a and MCP-1 after retinal detachment were not affected by TUDCA treatment, whereas increases in activity of caspases 3 and 9 as well as carbonyl-protein adducts were almost completely inhibited by TUDCA treatment. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Systemic administration of TUDCA preserved photoreceptors after retinal detachment, and was associated with decreased oxidative stress and caspase activity. TUDCA may be used as a novel therapeutic agent for preventing vision loss in diseases that are characterized by photoreceptor detachment.",

      "abstract": "AIMS: Hyperplasia of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) after blood vessel injury is one of the major pathophysiological mechanisms associated with neointima. Tauroursodeoxycholate (TUDCA) is a cytoprotective agent in a variety of cells including hepatocytes as well as an inducer of apoptosis in cancer cells. In this study, we investigated whether TUDCA could prevent neointimal hyperplasia by suppressing the growth and migration of VSMCs. METHODS AND RESULTS: Transporters of TUDCA uptake in human VSMCs (hVSMCs) were analysed by RT-PCR and western blot. A knock-down experiment using specific si-RNA revealed that TUDCA was incorporated into hVSMCs via organic anion transporter 2 (OATP2). TUDCA reduced the viability of hVSMCs, which were mediated by inhibition of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) by induction of mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase-1 (MKP-1) via protein kinase Cα (PKCα). The anti-proliferative effect of TUDCA was reversed by treatment with 7-hydroxystaurosporine, an inhibitor of PKC, and by the knock-down of MKP-1. In addition, TUDCA suppressed hVSMC migration, which was mediated by reduced matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) expression by ERK inhibition, as well as reduced viability of hVSMCs. Rats with carotid artery balloon injury received oral administration of TUDCA; this reduced the increase in ERK and MMP-9 caused by balloon injury. TUDCA significantly decreased the ratio of intima to media by reducing proliferation and inducing apoptosis of the VSMCs. CONCLUSION: TUDCA inhibits neointimal hyperplasia by reducing proliferation and inducing apoptosis of smooth muscle cells by suppression of ERK via PKCα-mediated MKP-1 induction.",

      "abstract": "Familial Amyloidotic Polyneuropathy (FAP) is a disorder characterized by the extracellular deposition of fibrillar Transthyretin (TTR) amyloid, with a special involvement of the peripheral nerve. We had previously shown that doxycycline administered for 3 months at 40 mg/Kg/ml in the drinking water, was capable of removing TTR amyloid deposits present in stomachs of old TTR-V30M transgenic mice; the removal was accompanied by a decrease in extracellular matrix remodeling proteins that accompany fibrillar deposition, but not of non-fibrillar TTR deposition and/or markers associated with pre-fibrillar deposits. On the other hand, Tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA), a biliary acid, administrated to the same mouse model was shown to be effective at lowering deposited non-fibrillar TTR, as well as the levels of markers associated with pre-fibrillar TTR, but only at young ages. In the present work we evaluated different doxycycline administration schemes, including different periods of treatment, different dosages and different FAP TTR V30M animal models. Evaluation included CR staining, immunohistochemistry for TTR, metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9) and serum amyloid P component (SAP). We determined that a minimum period of 15 days of treatment with a 8 mg/Kg/day dosage resulted in fibril removal. The possibility of intermittent treatments was also assessed and a maximum period of 15 days of suspension was determined to maintain tissues amyloid-free. Combined cycled doxycycline and TUDCA administration to mice with amyloid deposition, using two different concentrations of both drugs, was more effective than either individual doxycycline or TUDCA, in significantly lowering TTR deposition and associated tissue markers. The observed synergistic effect of doxycycline/TUDCA in the range of human tolerable quantities, in the transgenic TTR mice models prompts their application in FAP, particularly in the early stages of disease.",

The reduction of ER stress in islet isolation for transplantation is critical for islet protection. In this study, we investigated whether tauroursodeoxycholate (TUDCA) could inhibit ER stress induced by thapsigargin, and restore the decreased glucose stimulation index of islets. In pig islets, thapsigargin decreased the insulin secretion by high glucose stimulation in a time-dependent manner (1h, 1.35+/-0.16; 2h, 1.21+/-0.13; 4h, 1.17+/-0.16 vs. 0h, 1.81+/-0.15, n=4, p<0.05, respectively). However, the treatment of TUDCA restored the decreased insulin secretion index induced by thapsigargin (thapsigargin, 1.25+/-0.12 vs. thapsigargin+TUDCA, 2.13+/-0.19, n=5, p<0.05). Furthermore, the culture of isolated islets for 24h with TUDCA significantly reduced the rate of islet regression (37.4+/-5.8% vs. 14.5+/-6.4%, n=12, p<0.05). The treatment of TUDCA enhanced ATP contents in islets (27.2+/-3.2pmol/20IEQs vs. 21.7+/-2.8pmol/20IEQs, n=9, p<0.05). The insulin secretion index by high glucose stimulation is also increased by treatment of TUDCA (2.42+/-0.15 vs. 1.92+/-0.12, n=12, p<0.05). Taken together, we suggest that TUDCA could be a useful agent for islet protection in islet isolation for transplantation.",

      "abstract": "Black bear bile has been used in traditional Chinese medicine to treat liver and eye related illnesses for centuries. A major constituent of bile is ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA). Recent analysis of the cellular effects of UDCA and its taurine conjugate tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA) have demonstrated their antiapoptotic properties through regulation of Bcl-2 family and survival signaling proteins (Bax, Bad, phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase). In this study, we tested the hypothesis that TUDCA administered to rats prior to a myocardial infarction (MI) would exhibit anti-apoptotic effects and improve cardiac function. Prior to ligation of the left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery, TUDCA (50 mg/ml, 400 mg/kg, IV) or PBS was administered to rats. Animals were sacrificed 24 hours after ligation for terminal transferase-mediated dUTP-digoxigenin nick end-labeling (TUNEL) and caspase-3 activity to assess apoptosis. Additional TUDCA or PBS treated rats underwent pre-operative,1 and 4 week transthoracic ultrasounds to assess heart function by quantification of shortening fraction (SF) and infarct area. TUNEL labeling of the cardiac tissue revealed a significant reduction in apoptotic cells in rats given TUDCA prior to ischemic injury (p = 0.05). In support of reducing apoptosis, caspase-3 activity in the TUDCA treated animals also decreased (p = 0.02). By 4 weeks, a significantly smaller infarct area was present in the TUDCA group compared to the PBS group (0.05 vs. 0.13 cm(2), p = NS) and there was also an improvement in SF. The results provide evidence for TUDCA as a viable treatment for reducing apoptosis in a model of myocardial infarction. Additional studies will distinguish the functional result of improved cell survival following infarction, suggesting the potential for clinical application of this anti-apoptotic drug in treatment of acute MI.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Combination of the cytoprotective effect of tauro-ursodeoxycholic acid (t-UDCA) with the antiviral effect of interferon may be more effective than interferon alone for treatment of chronic hepatitis C. METHODS: We randomised 106 patients with chronic hepatitis C to interferon 3 MU/m(2)/3 times per week given alone (regimen A, n=51) or in combination with t-UDCA 10 mg/kg/day (regimen B, n=55) for 6 months followed by IFN dose tapering for further 6 months. Control liver biopsies were obtained 6 months after stopping treatment. RESULTS: At the end of the trial a similar proportion of patients had normal serum alanine aminotransferase activity (ALT) levels (41 and 44%) and negative viremia (42 and 43%) with regimens A and B, respectively. The effect on liver histology was also similar, and the Knodell score decreased by 2.9+/-0.4 points with both regimens. During the dose tapering phase, the cumulative interferon dose to maintain ALT activity within the normal range was significantly lower for regimen B (142+/-4 million units, MU) than for regimen A (180+/-12 MU, P<0.005). CONCLUSIONS: Adjuvant t-UDCA exerts an 'interferon sparing effect' that may be of value for patients intolerant to high dose interferon."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To determine whether tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA) would prevent or ameliorate the liver injury in neonates treated with total parenteral nutrition (TPN). STUDY DESIGN: Eligible infants were enrolled after surgery when serum direct bilirubin (DB) was <2 mg/dL. TUDCA (30 mg/kg/day) was given enterally to 22 subjects. A concurrent untreated/placebo group was evaluated for comparison (n = 30). Blood chemistries including alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (AP), conjugated bilirubin (CB), and bile acids (BA) were obtained weekly. RESULTS: There was no difference in peak serum CB, ALT, AP, or BA levels between the TUDCA-treated and control infants. When stratified for birth weight (<1500 g and >1500 g), no differences in peak CB, ALT, AP, or BA were noted. Serum CB levels were similar between TUDCA-treated and control infants after 14, 40, 60, 70, and 120 days of TPN. CONCLUSION: TUDCA appears ineffective in preventing the development or treatment of TPN-associated cholestasis in neonates. Erratic biliary enrichment and prolonged inability to initiate treatment may compromise the utility of enterically administered TUDCA for TPN-treated infants.",

We studied the composition of biliary lipids in a series of 33 patients with radiolucent stones, before and after treatment with TUDCA, 3.5 to 16.6 mg/kg/die for 4-6 weeks. Duodenal bile was collected with the Entero-Test after gallbladder contraction. Cholesterol saturation was 147% + 67 before treatment. TUDCA administration produced the following dose-dependent effects: a) a linear decrease of cholesterol saturation (r = 0.59; p); b) a non-linear increase of the percent of ursodeoxycholate in bile (r = 0.59; p); c) a non-linear increase of the fraction of ursodeoxycholate conjugated with taurine. At the dose of 11 mg/kg per day, cholesterol saturation was 80%, ursodeoxycholic acid represented about 45% of biliary bile acids, and about half of urso was conjugated with taurine. These results can be used as guidelines to assess the required daily dosage of TUDCA.",

All patients were treated with TUDCA (10-13 mg/day) for three months and the determination of PCNA (Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen) expression was used to assess the proliferative activity of hepatocytes at the beginning and at the end of treatment. TUDCA reduced both ALT and Knodell's score in the 5 patients in whom a significant increase of PCNA-LI (p < 0.05) was observed after treatment.

In particular it rises the proportion of highly detergent bile acids with the possible consequence of the manifestation of dyspepsia in a high percentage of patients: this is the well-known post-cholecystectomy syndrome. In this clinical trial we studied the activity and safety of tauroursodeoxycholic acid--TUDCA--(500 mg/die) in the prevention of dyspepsia in cholecystectomized patients, in comparison with no treated group. We enrolled 203 patients (101 TUDCA--group A--and 102 control-group B). The two groups were comparable for age (47.1 years in group A and 50.7 years in group B), sex (m/f: 28/73 and 37/65 in the two groups) and for other characteristics connected to surgical procedures. After operation all patients suffered from dyspepsia symptoms. In patients treated with TUDCA we registered a prompt regression in severity of symptoms when compared with no treated group: in fact we noted a significant difference only at the first control planned after one month from operation. No difference were registered at the other controls (two and three months after operation). Two patients in A and 3 in group B manifested adverse events. In conclusion, the treatment with TUDCA, a new hydrophilic bile acid, seems to contribute to the improvement of clinical course in cholecystectomized patients.",
