      "abstract": "Edible insect-derived proteins have attracted considerable attention in the food industry owing to their excellent nutritional and bio-functional activities. Herein, ethanol (20, 40, 60, and 80 %)-treated Tenebrio molitor protein (ETMP) was prepared, and its structural, techno-functional, and antioxidant properties were assessed. As the ethanol concentration increased, the molecular weight of the ETMP decreased, and α-helix content decreased whereas that of β-sheet increased, affecting the secondary structure. Ethanol treatment also resulted in changes in the techno-functional properties of edible insect proteins. ETMP showed significant 2,2'-Azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) diammonium salt radical-scavenging activity (p < 0.05), and its antioxidant activity effectively increased the viability of Vero cells damaged by oxidative stress; 20 % ethanol treatment induced the highest antioxidant activity. In conclusion, our results suggest that appropriate ethanol treatment (20 %) increases the antioxidant activity of edible insect proteins, suggesting their potential in food as an alternative protein resource and functional food with excellent antioxidant activity.",

      "abstract": "Edible insects are promising future food resources globally. Herein, the structural, physicochemical, and bio-functional properties of edible insect protein isolates (EPIs) extracted from Protaetia brevitarsis larvae were investigated. The results showed that EPIs have a high total essential amino acid content; moreover, β-sheet is the major secondary protein structure. The EPI protein solution was highly soluble and electrically stable and did not aggregate easily. In addition, EPIs exhibited immune-enhancing properties; EPI treatment of macrophages induced the activation of macrophages and consequently promoted the production of pro-inflammatory mediators (NO, TNF-α, and IL-1β). Moreover, macrophage activation of EPIs was confirmed to occur through the MAPK and NF-κB pathways. In conclusion, our results suggest that the isolated P. brevitarsis protein can be fully utilized as a functional food material and alternative protein source in the future food industry."

      "abstract": "The treatment of food waste digestate with high salinity is a big challenge. This paper evaluated the possibility of using black soldier fly larvae for food waste digestate disposal and insect protein production. Results showed that both digestates from hydrogen and methane fermentations were rich in protein and lipid contents, which benefited the BSFL cultivation. The BSFL reared on digestates from hydrogen and methane fermentations of food waste performed better in pre-pupal weight (19.12% and 41.13% higher, respectively), body length (3.62% and 18.21% higher, respectively) and crude protein contents (7.85% and 39.05% higher, respectively) than that reared on raw food waste. In addition, the maximum body weight growth rate (Rm) of BSFL cultivated on both digestates were 28.28% and 47.10% higher than that of BSFL cultivated on raw food waste, respectively. During BSFL cultivation, organic matter reduction between 40.97% and 46.07% were achieved. Digestates from hydrogen and methane fermentations represent favorable feeding substrates for BSFL cultivation. Using BSFL to treat AD digestate not only provides a digestate disposal approach, but also produces insect biomass and organic fertilizer as value-added byproducts, which shows tremendous potential in digestate disposal.",

      "abstract": "In the context of increasing awareness on the dietary supplementation of organic selenium in commercial poultry production and ensuring safe egg production, the present study investigated the effects of selenium on the pharmacokinetics of the therapeutic use of florfenicol and enrofloxacin from perspectives of laying performance, selenium deposition in eggs, and drug residue in plasma, organs, and eggs. A 2 × 3 factorial arrangement with two kinds of drugs (florfenicol vs. enrofloxacin, 200 mg/kg) and three levels of dietary organic selenium SCIP (selenium conjugated to insect protein) (0, 2, and 5 mg/kg) was designed together with a blank control group. Healthy Hy-Line Brown laying hens (n = 252, 40-week-old and 90.0 ± 1.7% of egg production rate) were randomly allocated into one of seven treatments with six replicates and six hens per replicate. The experiment lasted for 42 days and consisted of three periods (adjusted stage, depositional stage, and eliminating stage) of 14 days each. These stages entail feeding of the laying hens with basal diets, addition of drugs and selenium synchronously into the diets, drug withdrawal from diet, and supply of selenium uninterruptedly in the diet. Egg production and feed intake were recorded on daily and weekly bases, respectively. The selenium content in egg yolk, egg white, and whole eggs and the drug residues in eggs, plasma, liver, kidney, and breast muscle were determined on days 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9, 11, and 14 of the depositional and eliminating stages. There was no significant difference (p > 0.05) in egg production among the dietary treatments, but feed intake decreased significantly (p < 0.05) in the drug treatment group compared to other groups. Dietary organic selenium decreased the residue of drugs in tissues and eggs, while the metabolism and deposition of selenium in laying hens were suppressed due to drug effects. The results of the present study are of significance to enrich the knowledge of the pharmacokinetics of florfenicol and enrofloxacin in laying hens and ensure the quality of poultry products."

      "abstract": "The objective of this study was to determine the effects of high pressure to investigate the technical functional properties of the protein solution extracted from an edible insect, Protaetia brevitarsis seulensis. High pressure processing was performed at 0 (control), 100, 200, 300, 400, and 500 MPa at 35°C. The essential amino acid index of the control was lower (p<0.05) than that of the P. brevitarsis seulensis extract treated with 100 MPa. The SDS-PAGE patterns tended to become faint at approximately 75 kDa and thicker at approximately 37 KDa after high pressure treatment. The protein solubility and pH of the protein tended to increase as the hydrostatic pressure levels increased. The instrument color values (redness and yellowness) of the P. brevitarsis seulensis protein treated with high pressure were lower (p<0.05) than those of the control. The forming capacity of the protein solution with P. brevitarsis seulensis treated with high pressure was higher (p<0.05) than that of the control. In conclusion, we confirmed that the technical functional properties of edible insect proteins extracted under high pressure of 200 MPa are improved. Our results indicate that high pressure can improve the technical functional properties of proteins from edible insects."

      "abstract": "We investigated the impact of sonochemical action and the reaction of Hermetia illucens larvae meal protein (HILMP) as regards enzymolysis under varied enzyme concentration and temperature to explain the mechanism and effect of sonication on molecular conformation, limits of kinetics, free-Gibbs energy, and antioxidative capacity. Control treatment was used for comparison. The results showed sonochemical treatment enhanced HILMP-enzymolysis efficiency at various enzyme volume, and temperature. Enzymolysis-kinetics revealed sonochemical treatment increased the rate constant (p < .05) by 17.21%, 25.06%, 26.91%, and 41.38% at 323, 313, 303, and 293 K, respectively. On free-Gibbs, sonochemical treatment reduced the reactants-reactivity energy, enthalpy, and entropy by 30.53%, 35.05%, and 10.71%, respectively (p < .05). Changes in spectra of UV and fluorescence, and micrographic imaging indicated alterations of HILMP by sonochemical treatment. Antioxidative activity of sonochemically-treated HILMP increased, compared to control. Thus, sonochemical treatment may be beneficial in the production of edible insect proteins with smaller molecular weights for different food and/or pharmaceutical applications. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Sonochemical pretreatment of HILMP positively impacted it enzymolysis rate-reaction, stability of reaction products, structure, and bioactivity. Thus, the technique may be beneficial to industry in the processing/development of new (bioactive/pharmaceutical) products involving enzymolysis of edible insects (e.g., Hermetia illucens) protein; particularly at such a time where edible insects are projected to be a source of protein for human nutrition and livestock in the next few years.",

      "abstract": "Hermetia illucens (edible insect) larvae protein, and hydrolysates were prepared using three pretreatment modes (conventional, fixed-frequency ultrasonic, and sweep-frequency). Protein subunit scores, microstructure, antioxidative activity, and techno-functional property of the respective isolates and hydrolysates were investigated. Alkaline protease hydrolysis significantly enhanced protein solubility, but impaired the emulsifying property and foaming stability. Isolates and hydrolysates treated by ultrasound exhibited highest antioxidative effect, and showed excellent solubility and foam expansion over wide (2-12) pH, likened the conventional. Ultrasonic, particularly sweep-frequency, treated hydrolysates overall showed superior solubility, foam, and antioxidative (ABTS, Superoxide scavenging, and Ferric-reducing) capacity than the remaining modes and isolates (p < 0.05). Treatment type influenced microstructure, functional attributes and antioxidative capacity of hydrolysates and isolates. Thus, functional/antioxidative property could be improved or modified for different food applications based on elected treatment. H. illucens isolate and hydrolysate preparations thereof could suitably be used in development of novel food formulations.",

The aim of this study was to investigate the potential effect of insect protein as a dietary supplement to increase muscle hypertrophy and strength gains during prolonged resistance training in young men. Eighteen healthy young men performed resistance training four day/week for eight weeks. Subjects were block randomized into two groups consuming either an insect protein isolate or isocaloric carbohydrate supplementation within 1 h after training and pre-sleep on training days. Strength and body composition were measured before and after intervention to detect adaptions to the resistance training. Three-day weighed dietary records were completed before and during intervention. Fat- and bone- free mass (FBFM) improved significantly in both groups (Mean (95% confidence interval (CI))), control group (Con): (2.5 kg (1.5, 3.5) p < 0.01), protein group (Pro): (2.7 kg (1.6, 3.8) p < 0.01) from pre- to post-. Leg and bench press one repetition maximum (1 RM) improved by Con: (42.0 kg (32.0, 52.0) p < 0.01) and (13.8 kg (10.3, 17.2) p < 0.01), Pro: (36.6 kg (27.3, 45.8) p < 0.01) and (8.1 kg (4.5, 11.8) p < 0.01), respectively. No significant differences in body composition and muscle strength improvements were found between groups. In young healthy men, insect protein supplementation did not improve adaptations to eight weeks of resistance training in comparison to carbohydrate supplementation. A high habitual protein intake in both Con and Pro may partly explain our observation of no superior effect of insect protein supplementation.",
